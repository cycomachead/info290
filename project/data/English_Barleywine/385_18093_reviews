"Drinkability – This is a nice barley wine.  Surprisingly easy to finish a 22oz bottle at 13.2%."

"3000th review! 22 ounce bottle into snifter; 2014 vintage, bottled in late 2013. Pours hazy dark ruby red color with a 1 finger fairly dense khaki head with solid retention, that reduces to a small spotty lace cap that lingers. Slight spotty lacing on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big raisin, plum, fig, caramel, toffee, toast, brown sugar, coconut, vanilla, bourbon, oak, leather, light chocolate, and oak/toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/toasted malt, fruity yeast, and bourbon barrel notes; with good strength. Light-moderate booziness as it warms, but not too bad. Taste of big raisin, plum, fig, caramel, toffee, butterscotch, toast, coconut, brown sugar, molasses, brown bread, bourbon, oak, vanilla, leather, light chocolate, and oak/toasted earthiness. Light oaky bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, plum, fig, caramel, butterscotch, molasses, toffee, toast, coconut, vanilla, brown sugar, bourbon, oak, leather, light chocolate, and oak/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity and robustness of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast, and bourbon barrel flavors; with an awesome malt/yeast/barrel balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very creamy, fairly slick, and slightly syrupy/sticky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light-moderate warming lingering after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic barrel aged English barelywine style. All around awesome complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast, and bourbon barrel flavors; and smooth to sip on for the huge ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."

"2014 vintage.  Poured from fridge temp to a tulip.  Look is a beautiful murky brown with some good carbonation.  Smell is amazing - strong caramel.  Vanilla, sweetness, and a bit of bourbon.  Taste is absolutely incredible and follows the nose.  Plenty of caramel and barrel coming through, with some nice brown sugar.  Truly amazing.  Mouth feel is great.  Overall, this is a phenomenal BA barley wine."
""
"Verdict: A really nice Barrel Aged Barleywine, definitely one of the more complex and balanced takes on the style, though I wish the body had a bit more gusto. Perfect for sipping and sharing, and an excellent beer for a cold winter's night."
"Outstanding beer one of the best barley wine's I've had"

"This is a nice barley wine that was made with skill.  Super, deep brown body.  Thin, mocha head.  Exceptional smell of toffee and caramel.  Tastes of toffee, caramel, molasses, and chocolate.  Viscous mouth feel.  This is a barley wine to look forward to every year.  It is special."

"Bottle: Poured a deep dark cloudy brown color ale with a small dark brown foamy head with light retention and some minimal lacing. Aroma of toffee, residual brown sugar and caramelized malt is pretty awesome. Taste is also dominated by toffee with some brown sugar notes and caramelized malt. All rough edges have been rounded by the bourbon notes with light vanilla notes also noticeable. Body is full with limited filtration and a good amount of carbonation. This beer has so many layers of complexity while retaining such a good amount of drinkability. Really amazing beer that I wish I could try on a regular basis."

"Picked this up in a great trade with Evan! An aggressive pour yields a caramel-colored two finger head with decent retention and great lacing. Dark brown, nearly black pour is probably the darkest Barley Wine I've seen. Rich, bold nose with huge dark fruits, bourbon, and oak along with hints of vanilla, figs, toffee, raisins, and sweet brown bread. The taste follows suit with tons of oak and dark fruits along with hints of vanilla, maple, butterscotch, subtle chocolate, molasses, brown bread, and toffee. The mouthfeel is thick and syrupy, but creamy smooth with a subtle warming finish. The 13.4% ABV is nowhere to be found for this unbelievably drinkable beer. Overall, this is a world class Barley Wine. Bold, flavorful, complex, and extremely drinkable. It's time to start trading for more..."

"O-this is a mans drink. I always let my buddies who aren't into craft beer always try the barleywines and always they look at me like im crazy. Im in love with English style brews as in old ales, stouts and barleywines. This is a spot on english style barleywine. Malt foward with lots of fruit. I was surprised by this brew. I now have to have a side by side with bourbon county barleywine as I feel this has a slight edge for my taste."
"Pours the color of cola with a frothy, loose, tan-colored head that slowly dissipates into a soapy slick. Nose reveals toffee, figs, and burnt sugar. Taste consistent with nose with a light, residual ethanol presence that cuts the sweetness. Mouthfeel is light-medium with an even carbonation. This has been a long-time want of mine and I was not disappointed. Top notch - wish I had more."
""
""
""
""

"Very bourbon dominated. Aroma of strong caramel, soaked oak, slight vanilla, coconut, straight bourbon whiskey. Slighter vinous fruit notes. Taste similarly dominated with bourbon, great rich barrel notes, caramel, booze. Mouthfeel is slick, smother, very low carbonation. Fantastic barrel aged english style barleywine"

"Absolutely fantastic. One of the best English barleywines that I've had. I'm very happy to have procured multiple bottles to enjoy again both soon and as it ages. This is one of an elite few that I would say is truly worth seeking out."

"Overall a fantastic Barrel-Aged English Barleywine. Can stand with the best of them. Too bad places price gouge this quite a bit. I've seen bottles for 30% less than what I paid."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I think this is a really good barleywine. Great? I dunno. I will definitely try this fresh and see the difference it makes. For me, the beer was a little bland which could have been from the age. The aroma is the best thing about it, though the taste left me a little let down given the love for this brew."

"Medium bodied, smooth, with low carbonation. The alcohol is extremely well hidden for a 13.4 % abv beer. This is an outstanding beer."
""
"O: An excellent example of what barrel aging can do to an english style (to me, not supper hoppy) barleywine. If you like Sucaba/Abacus, or Bourbon Angel's Share, you'll like this. One of the best example of the style."
"A nicely complex take. The year of age has mellowed it and made it a worthy investment."
"This is kind of like a night in a bottle. The only reasonable way to drink this is to sip it. It's monstrous, but it's worth it. Maybe this would be a lot better in like 5 years."
""
"Wow as this warms it really starts showing its chocolate and bourbon character, where colder it had showed more fruit, but, and dry oak. On the warmer side the flavor is comparable to something like a BA Speedway chocolate and bourbon character. Awesome."
""
""
"The feel is downright velvety with not a stitch of the high ABV to be felt."
""
"Great stuff, just a fantastic BA barleywine."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Aging this for a year PROPERLY really did a trick."
"This beer is pretty unique to me after having more than a few Bourbon barrel Barleywines. The bourbon flavor is unique, it has a peppery feel but only mixes and does not dominate the flavor. The English yeast only makes it all the better with a great raisiny dark fruit spiced feel."
""
""
""
""
""
"Holy cow, how have I never heard of this beer mentioned when people are talking about the best of the best in Barrel Barleywines, I think this may be it. I rated Central Waters Bourbon Barrel Barleywine a perfect 5 and go through at least a case of it a year. But this is just as good if not better holy cow I am truly thankful for the opportunity to try this beer."
""
""
""
"Overall, the most enjoyable things about this brew were its aroma and flavoring. It is extremely hard to peg a top component for this beer, as everything about it sings beautifully and strictly to style, all while satiating and appeasing the drinker. The aroma is deep, rich, and sweet, and the flavoring follows exactly as it should in those footprints. The booze is heavy but subdued, and neither hot nor harsh at any point. The bourbon is glorious, oaky, and musky, just boasting what a proper barrel aging could do for a beer. The feel is what really takes this beer to other-worldly status, with velvety crush, silky smoothness, and buttery slide across the oropharynx. Even with excessive warmth, the Arctic Devil remains firm to its promises, with the complexity of it all extending this tasting beyond two hours. This is one of the best English barleywines we’ve ever come across, and again, while that is partly due to its impeccable execution of recipe and style, the unique, heavily warming, and rich Alaskan flair makes for an incredible, unforgettable experience that will not soon be forgotten."

"Pours a deep copper color with a decent sized off white head that shows moderate retention. Aromas of dark caramelized sugar, dark pitted fruits, bits of wood, hints of rum and bourbon, light alcohol, no hop aromas. The flavor is sweet with dark sugars, light oak, light fruits, a solid hit of warming alcohol and a touch of earth. Medium to thick body with a moderate to light level of carbonation and a sweet almost sticky mouthfeel. One of my favorite barley wines, I only wish it were a little easier to obtain."
"Pours a nice dark copper color with a beige head. Aroma is of filled with dark fruits, oak, vanilla, bourbon soaked raisins, cherries, caramel, toffee and earthy notes. The flavor follows the nose with nice amounts of barrel character, again lots of oak and vanilla, bourbon soaked raisins, caramel, toffee, earthy notes, cherries and nice sweet notes. The body is full with a silky and slightly sticky mouth feel."

"Overall: This is an all-around outstanding beer. The bourbon comes through in the perfect amount for me, and the other flavors, all of which are delicious, blend together for a fantastic profile. Some beers with a similar profile to this are overly sweet, but this one is just perfect."

" I have had other batches of Arctic Devil, and every one does seem just a bit different, this ""new"" 2012 batch seems to have lost some of the fruity notes from years past... but in their place there is an overwhelming blast of roasted malts and sweet bourbon, leading to a semi-dry finish that is quite a bit more boozy, however it is less so when it opens up (probably should be drank near 50-55 degrees). Maybe MS has ditched some of their port and cabernet barrels for more bourbon, because thats the direction that this vintage is headed for. Mouthfeel on the beer is, as always, velvety and sublime."

"Overall: This is the second best English Barleywine that I have had with first one being a retired gem and probably my favorite Midnight Sun beer period. You get everything you will need when asking for quality. As far as availability is concerned I don't think you will find a better barleywine out there."

"Arctic Devil is aptly named after the wild and vivacious wolverine , for it presents a snarling (but sophisticated) blend of bold flavors in a natural-feeling harmony. This is one of the best offerings from a brewery which has a LOT of fantastic beers. Totally wicked."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"thanks Beership!"
""
"T: Even as it warms, the oak comes through a lot more than I'd like, holding back the other flavors in here. Brown sugar and caramel come through along with a pretty big hit of booze. Some toffee, a slight hint of bourbon, and some more buttery oak on the finish. Definitely way too oak forward for me right now, but I can't wait to revisit this in a year or so."
"O - Rich, chewy, flavorful, leaves you wanting more... Bravo!"
""
""
""
"O: Amazing English Barleywine; one of the best I've had. Not overly sweet. Perfect barrel."
""
"O: Really had high hopes, might have just had a bad bottle, or one that might have been a little too old? Will hopefully have this one again and will rereview if needed."

"O: Oh wow...this is great. Recommended without reservation."
"D - Fantastic barrel aged barley wine. Great overall balance."

"Skol"
"I would be remiss if I did not amend this review having had a bottle of the 2013 with about a year on it. The aging on this beer was stellar. Not only did it retain a lot (more?!?!) of the original hoppiness, but the flavors of booze, barley, and hop melded together seamlessly into a truly superior  product. You should always buy a bottle of this when it comes around, and if you have the discipline, sit on a bottle (or two) to enjoy later."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I've been wanting to try this one for a long time and it didnt disappoint. A great complex barelywine where eveything lines up in an equal order, barrel, sweetness, vanilla, chocolate, awesomeness. Where I have found other BA barleywines (even the highest rated) to be a little thin or lacking in complexity, this one nails it. Rich, chewy, great. I will be buying a couple fresh ones to age."
"O: Overall, this is an excellent barleywine. It doesnt quite make it into my top, elite-BW tier (with MoAS, Sucaba and Old Nuptial), but its not far behind and is still one of the best BWs Ive had. Intoxicating aroma, just a touch too bitter on the tongue. I wish I had another one to cellar and see if that bitterness fades. Either way, still excellent. Glad I was able to try this one. Highly recommend."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-In a word: Delicious. Enjoying a scotch or bourbon now and then perhaps this beer fits my particular niche. But I would presume anyone new to barley's would enjoy this outstanding beer. Another winner from MSB."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Finally the beer ship came in! Poured in to a snifter glass. This beer pours a jet black with a very minimal head. The nose gives deep caramel and toffee. Taste is caramel & toffee with some chocolate, coffee and vanilla. There is a lot going on with this. Some slight tobacco notes are on the finish. Very smooth with some slight bourbon notes! Well done!"
""
"There's definitely a good deal of heat, but this only adds more complexity, in a catalyst sort of way. Sucaba WAS my favorite barleywine, but this flavor/texture monster eclipses it."
""
""
"Received my box from Beership of 6 of these... been wanting to try this one for a while. Poured into Half Acre snifter. Appearance is really dark, much darker than most barleywines. Small rim of tan head dissipates quickly. Nose is rich and full of layers. Notes of caramel, molasses, chocolate, raisin, vanilla, leather, and tobacco. Taste is just as complex as the nose with highlights of molasses, chocolate, and raisins. The bourbon is mellow and melds nicely with everything going on. Mouthfeel is thick with mild carbonation. Overall, incredibly complex barleywine."
""
""
"Pours a dark amber body with fleeting tan head, leaving a sheet of the same. Caramel, vanilla, oak, bourbon, Brandy(?), seafoam, hints of leather and sherry oxidation. Flavor is similar to the nose, but less impressive and there is an alcoholic tinge to the finish. Thin bodied and low carb, the booze is evident on this one and leaves a burn. This is a good beer, but my favorite was the '08, sadly I didn't review back then, but I recall a fuller body and more refined character in the beer. As it stands, I would advise trying this beer, but not really seeking it out particularly hard, unless you're ChadQuest or other peeps that really dig the BA BW's."

"O: Glad I got a few extras to age although it's ready now to drink. This beer is highly recommended!!!"
"Big thanks again to Ed for opening this one. It was damn delicious. I have no other Arctic Devils to compare it to, but holy shit, this was super-drinkable for a 13.2% barleywine. Very sweet and woody all around, such a pleasure to drink."
"Atmosphere is really solid. Decent head, nice effervescence, and some slight lacing. Nose is excellent combination of sweet components. Flavor is lightly pungent, and lightly sweet, nutty and syrupy characterized by caramel, milk chocolate, and maple; but heavily sweet... well done. High alcohol content is well disguised. Overall, this is a great quaff."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark reddish amber. This beer had more of a bitter note to it than many of the other beers opened that night. There is a strong sweet presence to balance things out, but I would have liked the bitterness to be a bit milder. I'm getting some booze, but it's still quite smooth. There is a nice caramel note in the background. The body is thick with smooth carbonation and a dry finish."

"From notes, 12/9/10. Bottle. 2010 version. Among the very best barleywines that I’ve tried. This is sit-down-and-take-a-moment good, and I can imagine it getting better with age. The pour is clear ruby with a tiny head. It’s fairly viscous, though not quite as much as you might expect from a 14% abv beer. All sorts of flavors come out in the aroma and taste. There’s an enormous English caramel/toffee malt flavor marbled with a ton of fruitiness. Lots of raisins, plums, peaches, dates and cherries. On top of that, there are great flavors of vanilla, mint, oak, leather and subtle barrel notes. There’s just a touch of hop bitterness in the finish to pull it back from cloying territory. This is a deeply flavored beer that oozes luxury and craftsmanship. Mouthfeel is full and smooth. It coats the mouth pleasantly, but I’ve had lots of stickier, boozier beers that aren’t nearly the size of this one. Midnight Sun knows their stuff and really hit one out of the park with this beer. I might be scoring this a bit low in anticipation of trying an aged bottle in a few years."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: One of the best barleywines out there. Strong execution all around, and highly recommended. So smooth and complex. I kept going back for more and more pours, even though it's a bad idea at 13% ABV."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is molasses, fresh maple syrup, alcohol and caramel. Soooo smooth and very easy to drink. The malts are rich and have a perfect flow to them. Mouthfeel is rich, but not overly thick or cloying. Wonderful beer...classic even. One of the best barleywines I have had in some time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall this was a good barleywine. Not great, just good. Slightly disappointed here, for the trouble it is to get Anchorage brews I had higher expectations for this one. There are readily available barleywines on the market I can get at a fraction."
""
""
""
""
"Wow. Four years still hasn’t tamed this critter much. I knew from previous experience that this was an aggressive BW and being partial to aged English barleywines, figured with some time to cool off this would be primo stuff. Apparently I need to give the other ones more time. Certainly a quality beer (as always with Midnight Sun), but a bit of a thrash metal mosh pit in the mouth."
"Drink- I enjoyed this. I got a new job yesterday and opened something nice. I was hoping this was some sort of a KH killer that I finally had my hands on. It wasnt. Not to say it wasn't a good beer. Just expected more. Its good, but not great. I think I prefer Abacus to this."
"Overall a decadent bourbony malt bomb, a great sipper of a beer."
""
""
"4.0 D: It's a good beer that just has one fatal flaw. Great flavors, but I need more maltiness when I'm drinking a barleywine. I'll have to try this fresh sometime."
""
""
"A very nice barrel-aged barleywine that falls perhaps a hair short of the best in class. Wish I had been able to try past vintages; also wish I had more than the single bottle to so I could sock a few away for aging."
""
""
""
""
"A bourbon barrel barleywine sipper that I had a hard time sipping. I'd put my money on this against any barleywine, no matter the whale status."
"O- good BA Barleywine but nothing outstanding. If you get a chance definitely worth a try but don't trade your first born for it."
""
""
""
""
"Vey good, was expecting more given it's reputation."
""
"Overall well balanced English barleywine and barrel notes. I don't know if I was looking forward to this more than I should have but it's a small let down even as its at the bottom of the top tier of its style. What?"
"This is a medium bodied brew with a light level of carbonation. It is a bold boozy sipper that is quite enjoyable. I am very appreciative to have the chance to sit down and enjoy a significantly sized pour of this aged beauty. However, just like my initial thoughts of this brew when i had a small sampling some time ago, it lacks just a bit in body. I found the aromatics to be much more complex than the flavor as well. Thanks again Heath!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Glad I got to try this one. Still think Abacus is my favorite English Bwine, but this is not far behind."
""
"O: The whiskey barrel was nicely integrated and a liked the sweetness it entailed. Very happy to have tried this guy."
""
""
""
"Overall - Excellent flavors. The oxidation is nice. The only downfall is the mouthfeel. Too thin in the finish."
"Very glad to have had the chance to try this gem. Thanks so much Matt!"
"A delicious, fruity, liquer-like barleywine. Not quite the best I've had (that title remains with Abacus), but definitely up there. I will most definitely seek this out again."
"O - Tasting this side-by-side with King Henry and MOAS didn't do this one justice at all. That said, it is yet another solid beer from Midnight Sun."
"On the fuller end of medium-bodied with a well integrated barrel character that doesn't overpower the elements of the base beer.  Some nice dry oak along with spicy/sweet whiskey, vanilla and coconut. Soft carbonation adds to the palate and the sweet and leathery notes from the base beer really come through. Hints of toffee, dark fruit, caramel and leathery malts with a slightly dry finish.  Subtle warmth in finish but overall the ABV is very well masked.  Lots of boozy flavor but not a lot of heat.  Can't believe that it's 13.5%!  Really nice. A bit heavy on the barrel/whiskey presence but the characteristics of the base beer come through nicely."

"Review from 11/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a deep red amber, minimal off-white head and no lacing. Aroma of caramel, whiskey, malt and fruit. Starts with malt, whiskey and caramel, finishing with dark fruits, a touch of oak, more whiskey and alcohol. Very complex and rich. Nice heavy body. Would score higher without the big alcohol punch. Hopefully this will mellow with age. Excellent barley wine."
"OVERALL: A solid beer that's easy enough to drink, but somewhat lack luster compared to others in the style. The base beer is a little mild, and the barrel aging a little too restrained perhaps. Something worth checking out if you see it, but nothing earth shattering enough to go out of your way for. I'd have it again, but would most likely pick something else first. Thanks again for the trade Stupac. Much appreciated."

"O- One of my favorite barleywines at the tasting, behind King Henry of course. Would love to grab a few more of these to set down for a bit. Very impressed."
"O - Hmm. I found this got much better as I let it warm. A sipper for sure, and the high ABV really shows."
"I've never given that a ton of credence."
"Also poured from bomber into a tulip glass. Pours a darker red copper color along with another disappearing head though the lacing was stuck on throughout. Same aromatics and flavors as the 2008 vintage but more enhanced probably due to the freshness of the brew. Improved carbonation and mouthfeel. A much better vintage – seems as if the fresher it is the better? I’d probably not cellar this one any more than a couple years if I had multiple bottles."
"O - I'm trying to be critical about this because I've been wanting to try this beer for a while. After fighting with it over 30 minutes, I'll say that it is one of the best of the style that I've had. Deserves more than a 4.0, but there is no 4.25 overall option. The real thing holding it down in the overall is the heat. I think another year in the bottle will bring this thing to another level. Now I need to find another one..."
""
"O - Sweet and carmel and toffee that try and hide the beast of an ABV. A bit hot, but Great!"
"overall: great barleywine"
""
""
""
"Pours a dark, cloudy amber brown color with a thin tan head. Aroma is a decadent blend of roast, oak, bourbon, vanilla, plum, raisin, brown sugar, caramel, and cherry. Extremely creamy and smooth body with a rich flavor similar to the nose; maple, cherry, raisin, plum, vanilla, bourbon and oak dominate the flavor. An all around, smooth, well balanced and complex barleywine."
""
""
""
"D - Overall I really enjoy the freshness and mix of barrels. It creates this multiplicity across the nose and palate that is really unique for the style. Midnight Sun's grasp on this blend is pretty excellent."
"A great beer at this age and one that you can tell will get even better with age."
""
""
""
"This was nice and aged very well, with that oxidation that was present mostly complimenting the other flavors and only got to be mildly distracting in spots. This was very rich and smooth overall though and I was glad that I finally found a proper time to open this guy. Now I just need to find a fresh bottle to compare…"
"O- This is a very solid brew for sure. A good balance of everything and pretty complex as well."
"Beer pours a reddish-brown with a thin white head and nice lacing. Smell is a nice nutty/toffee aroma with a little bit of booze in the background. Flavor is a nicely balanced mix of toffee malts and a little bit of hops with some oak in there. Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied. Overall, this beer is good, but it's not nearly as good as some of the past vintages I've had. Maybe this beer needs some age to be truly great."
""
"O- This is the best barley wine I've tried. Fantastic."
"Half finger tan head, uneven size bubbles, fairly quick dissipation with above average lacing over reddish amber clear body, a few streams of slow rising bubbles. Prominent toasty oak notes, rich malt backbone, Maris Otter?, brown sugar but not overly sweet, some citrus hops, good balance in the nose. Taste is a wee bit on the sweet side but not overly so, light brown sugar. Mouthfeel is a bit on the full side of medium, good effervescence. This brew packs a powerful punch, splitting a bottle multiple ways is highly recommended. A very good example of English style Barleywine, malt-forward and very tasty."
""
"O: I wanted to love this beer, but I think it needs some age. It's big and malty, but it hasn't quite acquired that sweet, ripe fruit flavor that I've come to expect from the style. Good, not great."
"Arctic Devil pours a fairly clear polished mahogany. There's about two fingers of khaki colored foam capping the beer. Head retention is solid, but lacing is fairly spotty. The nose is just a series of wonderful aromas washing over me one, after the next. Port inspired dark fruits, coconut, vanilla, caramel, and nutty sherry-like aromas all take a turn in the spotlight, not to mention a slight smell of alcohol. After all that, the flavor profile has a hard time living up. Darl fruits and a nutty sweetness are the dominant flavors, with vanilla and caramel showing up as well. A lid more presence from the base barleywine would be great, because what's in my glass is tasty, but I think I could come up with something similar just by blending some port and sherry to taste. The slight alcohol warmth creeps in pleasantly for the finish of each sip. The body is pleasantly rich and full, though not as heavy as I might have expected from a 13+% beer. The carbonation is wonderfully understated, doing its job while staying out of the way of the malt and barrel flavors. Arctic Devil is a great brew to have in your glass for a couple hours, I just wish it wasn't so clearly dominated by the barrel aging."
"O: A great barleywine. It kinda sucks that it followed king henry but this guy fought really hard to stand amongst the top of the crop. Great stuff. Nice woody vanilla makes this stuff great, it's an awesome flavor in this. Awesome flavors."
"4, 3.5, 3.5, 4, 4"

"Overall: This beer is ready to be drank fresh. Its in my top 3 favorite BA barleywines. Really solid beer from Midnight Sun Brewing! I recommend drinking this slightly higher than room temperature."
""
"O: This is one of the best English style barleywines I've had - a perfect balance of malt accentuated beer with enough supporting hops to keep it from cloying, and also with some interesting fruitiness that adds more dimensions and complexity."
""
""
""
"Rating: 97/100"
"A well done English barleywine. Definitely one of the top-tier in the example, though I felt the booziness became just a bit harsh at times."
"O: This is a barleywine that's still incredibly young, this certainly needs 2-3 years to dry out and possibly become really good. Right now it's just adequate."
"Easy recommendation."
"650 ml bottle. 2011 vintage. Pours a golden copper with a small tan head that settles to a ring and leaves a decent amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma is big coconut, some brandy and red wine, bourbon, vanilla, and caramel. The initial taste is sweet with coconut and caramel. There is also brandy, oak, bourbon, and toffee. The finish has some light alcohol. Full bodied but not syrupy. Low carbonation. Great beer. Lots of flavors going on and everything comes together quite nicely."
"Overall- for a BW and especially BBBW lover this is a fantastic beer. I bought two cases for a reason and haven't traded a single one. Just the right mix of bourbon, oak barrel and traditional barley wine. Drinkable as all hell for the abv and just the right sweetness. Would recommend this to any BBBW lover."
"O: A huge and complex barleywine for sure. I taste and smell something different every time. The only thing that really detracts is that the bourbon tastes kinda cheap and the appearance is weak (not that that counts for much)."
""
""
""
"Pours a murky brown with a khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots and streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, brown sugar, caramel, toffee, dark fruits, and wood aromas. Taste is the same but there is a more noticeable wood and whisky presence in the flavor. This beer has a very nice mouthfeel with a good crispness and medium body. Overall, this is a very good barleywine with some awesome aromas and flavors."
""
""
"Light body, almost medium. A good heat lingers throughout. The finish is too cheap. Uck."
"O: I don't feel that age has helped Midnight Sun's Arctic Devil, as I can't imagine this is what the brewer intended. If it is, then I must question the hype, as this is about as middle of the road a barleywine as I've ever come across."
"This clearly does not drink like 13.4%, but there is an ethyl alcohol presence that is a bit unappealing at this point. Some age might improve this. The light mouthfeel will most likely not change."
""
""
""
"Overall: Bourbon Soda, and I use that term in a most positive tone."
"Overall – A very good barleywine and one that I could not even taste the alcohol despite it being 13+abv. Glad I have another to lay down."

"This is a great barley wine! Definitely worth the price. This is right up their with King Henry. Excellent."

"O-- Slow sipper. Glad I shared this as would struggle on a whole bottle of this. Can not think of a barleywine that comes close to this in the complexity and depth that this had. First beer I have had in a long time that afterwards I just have an instant longing to have again. Unreal"
"D: I try not to use superlatives for effect, so I'm being sincere when I say this is among the best English barleywines I've ever had. I'd drink it again anytime."

"2010 batch. Not amongst the best. Demoted this year due to thinner mouthfeel, cardboard smell on nose and less flavor than I recall."

"22 oz bomber picked up at Ledgers a year or so ago. Split with buds while watching the Broncos implode. Reddish brown pour with a light tan head. Aromas of oak, caramel, dark fruit and port wine. Flavors of molasses, sweet figs, and vanilla wafers upfront with some whiskey influence on the backside. Smooth and creamy palate with loads of malty sweetness on the finish. Pretty nice overall and a tasty BW."

"O - Obviously this beer has a decent amount of hype behind it (and plenty of good ratings with it), but I've also heard several rather negative experiences with this too. Came into this with high hopes but prepared to be disappointed. Although not the perfect barleywine for me, this trended towards meeting the hype. Really well balanced with sugars and alcohol in control without being disguised to the point that one could down this quickly with unexpected results. For me the highlight of this beer is the well placed and lingering creme brulee effect. I can almost imagine the crunch and crackle of the burnt sugar coating on top of the dessert...really, really nice effect. This absolutely makes this beer for me. The overall balance and complexity are just bonuses - quite like a dessert in a glass for me."

"Overall: Great stuff. This is always a pleasure to drink."
"But will I enjoy this glass? hell yeah."
"Overall: Probably an excellent barleywine that is merely very very good right now."
"O - Good beer, drank a little bit sweeter than I would have liked, but probably to be expected from an English Barleywine with some age on it. Would love to try some other vintages."
"Extremely impressive, extraordinary beer. Glad I tried it again. Many years ago I found it too sweet and boozy, but I was also drinking beer too cold then. I had the wisdom to hang on to one for a while, and now I regret not putting away a few every year when I had the chance."
"O - A excellent English Barleywine. The combo of booze and sweetness is really well-done and I really don't have much bad to say about this beer. Try it!"
"O - have had a few times and this is the worst vintage I've had. That being said it is still an amazing brew. The alcohol is a bit hot but otherwise this is incredible and a great example of the style"
"Big flavors and definitely boozy but I wouldn't have pegged it at 13 percent. Solid barleywine."
"Weird"
"Overall outstanding."
"I'd be happy to revisit to see if I bought a ""off"" bottle but I won't be purchasing another"
"o - Overall I thought this was a fantastic barrel aged barleywine. I personally would have liked a little more bourbon in the nose but the taste was amazing, and I loved the toffee/caramel that came through. Super smooth body, would love to try this again sometime."
"I cannot remember who sent it to me as I kept this one in the cellar for quite some time; thanks to whomever"
"Overall: Nice beer, bit to sharp and unbalanced though."
"Dark brown with a faint white head. Aroma of sweet fruity, caramel. Considering this beer is over 14% abv, it does not have an alcohol-dominated taste. Delicious but not overpowering flavor imparted from the oak. Aftertaste lingers for quite some time, making this one a sipper!"
"More dark fruit comes out as I sample longer with figs and plums. A pretty solid beer that I enjoy a lot, but the nose seemed to promise a little more than the flavor delivered."
"Really nice offering, the complexity of the flavor profile really makes this beer shine, it's got the right amount of big sticky malt flavor and the right amount of hops. I actually would classify this as an American Barleywine, plenty of hops but not overbearing, lots of sugary, sticky goodness. I'd say this guy is too hoppy to be an English style BW and far too sweet to be a DIPA."
"Overall I have had two of the best barleywines in my life back-to-back nights (last night was Mirror Mirror 2009, uninfected version) but I think, no I know, this tops it. Wow, so so so highly recommended and worth trading for."
"From a 2010 vintage. Pours into a snifter a clear dark brown with some red, and larger than expected bubbles. Aroma is some sweet bourbon, plums, a light bitter hop. Flavor is sweet plums and raisins, a nice hot bourbon in the finish, not too big. A touch of a hop throughout thats just out of place. Enjoyed this less than some of the older years, but still pretty good!"
"O: A monster of a beer, Arctic Devil is a meal in a glass. Incredibly robust and complex with a ton of subtle flavors. However, what keeps it from the top tiers is the huge body and alcohol bite towards the middle and end. Age would probably do wonders to this one. Definitely worth trying and older vintages are likely worth their weight in gold!"
"Complex on the level of HotD Adam, mouthfeel of a big CCB beer, and as satisfying as Rochefort 10."
"Overall: As soon as I tasted this one, I forgot all about the alcoholic nose. What an amazing barleywine! Seek this one out!"
"High fives all around for how tremendous this beer was. And a huge thanks to Nate's generosity. This pours a nice sunset amber body with an off white foam. The aroma was unbelievable. There was figs, raisins, caramel, vanilla and I believe I detected a hint of orange zest as well. The taste made me almost cream my pants, this is on par with the best barleywines I've had. The flavors included hints of much of the same as in the nose only with the perfect level of sweetness. It's still got some bite to it on the tongue, but by most estimates the mouthfeel is really rather splendid. I wish I could have this everyday, bathe in it, make love to it. It was an outstanding beer."
"Must have more!!!"
"O - A spectacular malty barleywine with a smooth barrel complexity and mildly warming finish. With some are, there's almost no alcohol to this one. Fantastic!"
"Now that I think about it, though, I'm pretty sure I gave that high five away before this was cracked. Meh, worth it regardless. It (the beer, o' course) pours a cloudy sunset russet-amber topped by a half-finger of dark sandy foam. The nose comprises caramel, vanilla, toffee, mild maple syrup, and butterscotch. The taste holds notes of toffee, chocolate, oak, vanilla, light orange peel, light mandarin orange syrup, and butterscotch. The body is a hefty-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a kinda dry finish. Overall, a very tasty b-wine, one that a few years seems to have done wonders for."
"So this bottle was an 08, and everything had melded so well it was unreal. There was little alcohol heat, but some deep bourbon flavors are still there. Caramel and Toffee had overtaken all others and created a slightly chewy palate coating monster of a BW. There was a resin hop note that is all flavor and no bitter, and a mammoth butterscotch richness. This one is an awesome Barleywine, i will need to track down a bottle."
"-Gfunk"
"O - This is an incredible beer, even while so young. The depth of flavours and variance leaves you wondering how that is even possible. Due to its youth, it is still a touch hot, but in a year or two this beer will be even more mind-blowing. Sure glad I have more..."
"D: I have a feeling I'm catching the Arctic Devil in it's adolescence. He has shaking off some of the youthful edge of barrel-aging but has yet to mellow into a proper English Barleywine. A fascinating sipping beer."
"O: This was a beer that totally lived up to the hype. I could drink a whole bottle myself. Maybe I will one of these days."
"Overall, this is a great barleywine - one of the best I've ever had. However, the huge ABV is very noticeable, and it clearly hinders this beer's drinkability."
"O: Overall an amazing barleywine that I'd love to have again."
"(D)- A fantastic Barleywine. Sweet and rich but so smooth for how boozy this is SUPPOSED to be, but is the opposite. Being around 3 years old, this has even more life left in it for the future. Just amazing stuff that is drinking very well currently."
"Overall I was a huge fan of this beer, something I normally can't say about aged barleywines. An amazing beer that is very much worth a shot. Also worth setting one down for a few years if you're lucky enough to have multiples. As a quick note that was tasted side-by-side with Mother of all Storms and came out on top. Both fantastic beers but it really wasn't even a competition to decide my favorite."
"2010 version. Pours orange, whit head. Smells of apples, green granny smith kind. Tastes the same, with some caramel like what is found in cracker jack. Medium high mouth feel, medium carbonation, drinkability is high. Very enjoyable barley wine, I can't believe I haven't had it before!"
"D: Just a damn stunning barleywine; I find it really hard to give a 'perfect 5' to any strong beer in this category, but this one is sooo very close. I've enjoyed it much fresher (a year or less since bottling), but with 3-4 years of age, Arctic Devil absolutely glows. As of now, perhaps my favorite of the style."
"Cheers!"
"A slight syrup tinge, though surprisingly dry, as we carouse in our delectable fantasy now made real, and I wish that every moment we could be even as we are, in a seductive tumble of flesh, a delectable monstrosity of flavours and colours that overwhelm our senses and recall to our minds through our flesh from our hearts once again... ""I love you. It's true."""
"Pours a dark golden brown with a limited tan head. Smells of hops and malts (someone said freshly threshed grain - I dunno about that, but I was pretty malleable at this point). Faded hops and caramel blend fantastically. This beer is delicious and deserves to be aged for this time period. Best Barleywine I have had other than Gratitude (oddly enough, this tastes more like an American barleywine and Gratitude more like an English Barleywine, and yet their designations are reversed on the site). Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. This was consumed after a fresh Mother of All Storms, which could not compete (though it might be unfair to compare a fresh, barrel-aged barleywine to a two year aged one). The faded hop bitterness limits the drinkability a bit, but not a ton. Otherwise quite drinkable for the ABV."
"Bottom line - I'm not very experienced with barleywines, but I'm not crazy about. I would prefer it to be less syrupy, and have the alcohol more present instead. Guaranteed to get you laid, 100% of the time, every time."
"And that's what I'll continue to cherish the most."
"D - This is a great (albeit unique) barleywine. Full bodied, tasty and smoky, i could easily finish this bomber by myself."
"The warmth from the alcohol and its overall intense flavors make this one a bit of a sipper for me, but I would try it again anytime."
"This beer pours a very opaque, chocolaty brown color with no head at all. The aroma is that of tootsie rolls, honey, hops, and a slight hint of alcohol. A hint of chocolate on the front. The oak from the barrels is quite present. A surprisingly smooth finish. This is, quite possibly, the best barleywine I've ever had!"
"4/4/4.75"
"D-Hard to get ahold of, but worth the trouble. Wish I had another bottle to cellar. It wasn't quite ready."
"Overall? Like this, good beer. Without the dirtiness, this one would rise to a whole 'nuther level for me. So close."
"Thanks Auroracrisis!"
"D: This definitely drinks smoother than the listing on the label advertises. While it is a great barleywine, I believe I would prefer CWBBBW and TPS/MoAS over this. Now I'm interested in how this would be fresh..."
"* = ideas form fellow tasters"
"D--I would drink this all the time if I could, ISO: more Arctic Devil please."
"Overall, a solid beer from Midnight Sun. I don't get to try many of their beers, but this one is right down my alley."
"This is a good beer. I can think of a number of English barleywines that are better, though. Perhaps if I set it aside for a few years, the astringency would dissipate... worth a shot."
"When considering english barleywines. if you divided the relatively low alcohol ones (i.e Anchor OLD Fofhorn defining the style) and the high alcohol ones (Arctic Devil establishing the bar); this barleywine - acrtic devil by Midnigth Sun is the premier high alcohol english style barleywine, in my humble opinion. Wow! smooth and 13% abv don't normally exist in the same sentence, but this wonderous brew manages to pull it off. The full malt/raisen/fig complex is present as is the warmth....but the bite is nowhere to be found (well....maybe at the very back of the taste perameters). A great brew!"
"D: Awesome. Highly drinkable. Best barleywine I've had to date."
"D- one of those beers that u open when u want to really take your time drinking it. I enjoyed sipping on this for about an hour. I was really impressed at the complexity of it. The flavors really transform as the beer warms. A heavenly experience. I have one more left that I will be putting a little time on. I would highly suggest u seek this out."
"Over-rated."
"Thanks again for this one Alex!"
"D: Amazingly drinkable. Just so smooth. I really loved this beer. Deserves to be in the top 100."
"Poured a brown mahoghany in color w/ a skim coat light brown head w/ little to no lacing. Nose was of toffee, caramel, dark fruits, and light tobacco. Taste was the same as the nose w/ a great bitter hop backbone that balances out the brew nicely. Mouthfeel was medium bodied and the tobacco and flavors really hung on the palate. Drinkability was my only drawback on this brew, as the booziness really started to get to me before I was finished w/ my snifter. If the ABV was kicked down a notch or two, I would have rated this brew as world class. Overall, great flavors and aromas, but pretty disappointed at how hot it was at even two years of age."
"D: Easily one of the best barleywines I've had and one of my new favorites."
"D= Not one I would drink too often or in great quantity, but still a very very good English barleywine. The abv never feels as big as it is which makes this a dangerous one for sure!"
"Medium body, some carbonation in the mouth, really sweet up front, lots of flavor. Some liquor like components, raisins, plums, sweetness, lots of fruit. Finishes a little dry. Its a big beer and I'm doing my best to slay it but at 22 ounces and 13.2 % its an uphill battle. It is quite heavy but it hides the alcohol well. The fruitiness of the body makes this a great drinking beer but it is better split two ways. Good barleywine though, probably improve after 2 or 3 years."
"EDIT: Ticked the '07 vintage from the bottle (well, poured into a glass) recently. UN-BE-LIEVABLE. Great -bal character and just so much going on. Nearly the perfect -bal aged barleywine. Just amazing."
"D-this is a big beer, lots of flavors. barrel flavors are present but overpowered by a lot of malty sweetness. still the flavors work well."
"Side note: bottle I'm drinking says 10% abv but is listed at 13.2% on the site. Definitely tastes like the higher side but can't really say for sure."
"(2008 Vintage)"
"2008 vintage. Served from a tumbler @ 50F. Flavor is of dark, chewy caramel, dark toffee, and light molasses. Extremely thick and full-bodied. Surprisingly, finish is dry with the faintest touch of hops. Really fantastic, well-balanced, and robust flavors."
"D - Surprisingly easy to drink for 13.2%, although my resolve started to fade after about 6oz or so. Still, I wish this were available more places, as it'd be one of my go-to barleywines."
"Poured hazy reddish brown color with an average frothy off-white head that mostly lasted with good lacing. Moderate to heavy dark fruit, wood and small alcohol aroma. Medium to full body with a smooth texture and flat carbonation. Moderate to heavy complex sweet flavor with a medium to heavy sweet finish of moderate to long duration. This is another standout beer."
"Overall very nice, improving nicely as it warms."
"Overall a super tasty barlyewine but I'm glad I shared it with some people because I don't know if I could finish the whole thing."
"Thick chewy mouthfeel, mild carbonation and drinkable but would prefer to drink only 12 oz of this at a time due to the high booze percentage."
"All in all, this is a great brew. Interesting for an English barleywine compared to other beers I've tried in this style. Not one of my favorite barleywines, but still a great brew to try for the very unique flavors blended. Worth hunting down for sure and glad I did."
"I poured from a 22 ounce bottle, 2008 vintage, into a snifter. It is a murky caramel color with a very slight tan head, slight lacing. The aroma is full of vanilla, oak, and a balanced amount of whiskey. The flavor follows the nose, with some dark fruit notes added. A very well balanced beer, the whiskey notes add a fullness to the flavor without being overpowering. The finish has a caramel/whiskey sweetness to it. Artic Devil has a very full body and a sticky mouthfeel, very low carbonation. With an ABV of 13% it is a nice sipper. An outstanding beer that I received from Dunt in a recent BIF."
"oh we are fancy men, indeed. to celebrate a successfully brewed monstrous stout a bit early, it was time to ride the snake. we were quickly enveloped in a fire of vanilla, toffee, and caramel. slight whiskey kick, little bit of fruits. it's like floating on a rolling flame over the minions crying below. no hop presence, all malt and sin. really quite outstanding, glad to have shared it with some good men, happy there are a few more bottles of that left. so sumptuous, thick but without too much sweetness, damn nice."
"Pours a dark chestnut brown with a small, tight head. Loads of things going on in the aroma department: bourbon, oak, vanilla, caramel, brown sugar, and bits of dark fruit. Taste is very similar, with the barrel-aging really coming through; love the combo that Midnight Sun has done. Unbelievably lush mouthfeel--super creamy with the perfect tint of alcohol warmth (which was quite necessary waiting out there in line). Great drinkability. One of my all-time favorite barleywines."
"D: Uh . . . this is great. It reached all my expectations and that is saying a lot because I have been wanting this beer for about two years now. The flavors and aroma are just so distinct and present. This is probably the best Midnight Sun brew I have had thus far. Just so well crafted its amazing. Rock on, Midnight Sun. Rock on, Reino."
"Overall this was a fantastic beer, it really displayed the barrel aged characteristics well without being too overwhelming. The maltiness of it came through very well and was complemented by the barrel aging, unlike some I try where it tastes like a shot of bourbon was added to the beer. Really enjoyed this one but now I have to take a nap after drinking the bottle myself."
"D: A very nice English Barleywine... a 22 oz'er got a little slow for me towards the end."
"Overall: Overall it would probably be in my top 5 for the style anyway."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with good steady carbonation. Not overly heavy and ends up being quite a tasty drink. This is a damn tasty barleywine that holds nothing back. A bit on the sweet side but it works and packs a hefty malt punch with a good dose of alcohol to match."
"Overall, this is a pretty good bw, one of my favs. Better than most but remotely as good as the perfect storm, and probably not a top 100 beer."
"D: At 10% (or thereabouts), this is a sipping beer at best. One and done for this sleepytime cowboy."
"Overall, this is a great English barleywine. Lots of smooth malts, fruits and some nice wood character. Midnight Sun has really done a fantastic job with this beer. The only one that I've had that tops this is a 1999 J.W. Lees Harvest Ale. With that being said, I think I'll put another 3-5 years on the next bottle I have in the cellar. Really glad I got to try this. It should be a very enjoyable winter's night tonight."
"My only wish: for it to come in smaller bottles. Or with a hinge cap. Otherwise, it's quite yummy."
"2008 vintage. This poured a slightly hazy ruby color with some tan head. It smelled like raisin and honey wheat and brown sugar, with a bit of copper hops and creamy yeast and alcohol. It tasted like toffee and brown sugar and alcohol, with some raisin and honey wheat. It was oily with a bit of carbonation, and had a bitter metallic aftertaste. Overall this was a solid English barleywine, with nice malty scent and taste and good body. It was still pretty potent even after a year of aging, so this is definitely a sipping beer. Whisky and oak flavors weren't very apparent, which was somewhat disappointing. But this is still a great brew and very enjoyable."
"The body is on the full side of medium. There is definitely a big alcohol presence, so if you are drinking this one with a year or less on it I would definitely recommend splitting it with 2 or 3 other people. A very fine sipping beer, but one that I will age for a few years before cracking again."
"D - A definite cool weather beer, but not too sweet or overwhelming that it would only be a nightcap. Easy to drink a bottle without completely blowing out the palate."
"This was my first MS beer and I was impressed. This one tasted fantastic and still could go for a few more years. It was the perfect beer to have on the stormiest October day in SF in 47 years."
"Thanks to Beerworld-Alex for this generous extra. Poured into my duck rabbit snifter. 2007 Vintage. Pours a murky cherry brown with a thin lacing of head around the edges. Loads of sweet malt, toffee, caramel. Also notice some spice. Awesomely smooth on the tongue with a touch of carbonation. Just a slight bitterness on the finsih which is perfect. Toffee, caramel and mild oak, nutmeg, light cherries on taste. This will warm you up."
"The beer pours dark clear brown without much head. Buckets of hops in the nose with chocolate covered caramels. Some nice cherry as well. This thing has tons of hot alcohol, but there's still plenty of malt and hops. Good stuff, but I'd hoped for better."
"Poured a reddish brown with an modest head that faded to a collar. The aroma was maple syrupy sweet. I loved the smell. The taste was molasses, alcohol and dark fruit (prunes mostly). Feel was heavy bodied, thick, chewy and oily smooth. Drinkability was only above average due to the high ABV and extreme sweetness. I liked A Devil a lot, but 3F Behemoth still my favorite barley wine."
"Overall, an excellent beer worthy of the praise. It's my first Midnight Sun and won't be the last if they are all this good. Would love to try this on tap. Very highly recommend. Rotation: not avail here and had to get thru mail order so this might be my only try of it for awhile. If here, I'd like a bottle a year."
"D - Hot damn! This is without a doubt one of the tastiest, most complex barleywines I've ever had. I was indeed stunned. Simply put, Arctic Devil is a fantastic traditional English style barleywine to say the least. I would even go so far as saying this is the finest of its kind available anywhere."
"This is an excellent barleywine and one hell of an introduction for me to Midnight Sun Brewerey. I must find more...."
"22 ounce bottle acquired in a trade as an extra from urwatuh8, thanks again Richard, drank with Chelsea and Drake last night, poured into my Dogfish Head snifter, color is a dark brown with some dark reddish edges, two inch foamy beige head that stays around about five minutes, some lacing at first, aroma consists of dark fruits, sweet malts, caramel, toffee, sweet brown sugar, booze and very light hops, flavor starts off with a big caramel flavor with some sweetness, some dark ripened fruits in the middle that were mostly berries, pretty big alcohol burn in the finish, more sweet malts and lots of toffee come out towards the end but there is still a good amount of alcohol present, sweet, boozy, malty, and fruity mouthfeel, medium bodied, moderate carbonation for the style, taste lingers pretty well, could drink this bomber probably but alcohol is there, not too sweet or heavy considering though, my bottles said 10% ABV, so it seems this particular year is lighter than past years, believe this was the 2008 vintage, could probably use more age regardless, taste is still a bit hot but it seems like the cellar will really make this a world class barleywine, it is already well on its way, would drink again, recommended"
"A unique and spectacular take on the style. A beer to be sought out by any barleywine lover."
"Pours a hazy translucent empty beer bottle color with a full finger frosted tan collar that fades fairly quickly to surface, leaving negligible spotty patterns of Belgian lacing behind. The smell is amazing and classic. The aroma is HUGE and rich; sweet caramel and butterscotch. Lightly carbonated, the mouth feel is full bodied and has a tangy character from the alcohol and salty notes that compliment the flavors extremely well and linger nicely. Full flavored, the taste mirrors the nose...the caramel character is deep and slightly roasted, but the butterscotch note has the leading role in this play. An AMAZING drinker!! The 13.2% ABV is really well integrated...but be advised...this one needs to be savored...or you'll get stupid!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!! Many thanks to koopa for this opportunity."
"I'm very confused first of all because my bottle says its 10% abv and here its 13%. Probably just different years I'm guessing. Pours virtually black but upon closer inspection its more of a deep, deep, deep mahogany color. Light tan head, 2 finger, with good retention and lacing. Smell is rich of caramel, vanilla, sweet syrup and cream. A bit of booze too. Taste is similar. Very rich flavors of cream, caramel, sweet syrup, vanilla, some light coffee. Very thick and full, you could probably use a spoon with this stuff. Velvety and creamy as it goes down, strong warming sensation too. Overalll a good and complex beer. A little sweeter than I prefer. I think if there were a little more hops present, which I detected none of, this would be a great beer. But for now I'll just say its good."
"Drinkability: exceptional, deserty feel that says drink me faster and faster."
"huh? what is this doing in the top 100, let alone the #1 english BW? or maybe i got a bad bottle?"
"Tried an '08 of this last night, that i had been sitting on since January '09. The color was a garnet brown with just a smidge of head. The nose was sweet with burnt caramel and dark amber syrup. On the palate, a small burst of carbonation followed by sweetness, caramel, burnt toffee, dark fruits, Christmas pudding, treacle, unsulphured molasses, brown sugar and gently cloying long finish. This is a delightful English style barley wine that I look forward to every year!"
"Awesome beer, fresh or aged."
"Good full body with ideal carbonation that's silky smooth and creamish. Good dose of alcohol that never gets in the way and really adds to the delivery of the flavor. This is one barleywine that is as drinkable as they come...it's great now and becomes even greater with some age on it, a must try if you love B-wines!"
"Drinkability: Another skillful release from Midnight Sun. Barleywines are addicting enough on their own, but Arctic Devil takes it to a whole new level of hedonistic indulgence. Overall, an exemplary brew!"
"Drinkability- Reminds me of homemade grain alcohol cut with burnt sugar and cherries that I had at a bachelor party one time (170 proof and tasted like cherry syrup, dangerous stuff). Except this actually tastes good. Extremely smooth, extremely drinkable and probably the best Barleywine I've had since Old Ruffian. Crazy good stuff, mucho recommended. Thanks Chris!"
"22 oz. Cloudy orange/amber pour. Nearly no head, just some swirling cream bubbles. Sticks to the glass. Just looking at this one you know it's going to be full of malty goodness. Brown sugar, malt, toffee, raisin and a fair amount of booze in the aroma. Also hints of piney hops. Taste has an abundance of malt, caramel, vanilla, yellow raisins. Little hop presence, but it is faintly there. Solid sticky body. Gets a little warm as it warms, but the flavors also pop as it warms. This is a meal, not sure how much of this I want to drink, but you could polish off the bomber before you realize it. Top notch Barleywine that has some hints of Old Ale. Unfortunate that so many are going to the hop bomb American style, this is a must try for those who like a barleywine the old English way."
"This sips much nicer than your average bear in the weight class. It has bench strength and depth. Enough hops to intrigue. Excellent."
"2007 vintage. Hazy amber-brown in color with a small tan head. Rich malty aroma, woody with light resin and sherry-like oxidation. Figs, raisins, huge caramel sweetness. Similar on the palate; dark dried fruit, oak, tannins, toffee. Massive body, remarkably viscous. Deep resiny hops in the finish, noticeably faded with age but still packing a punch, and quite tannic too."
"drinkability is great. well balanced. great depth and complexity. the alcohol is still a bit warm, but goddamn i love it anyway. i'll be looking for more of this!"
"Pours a lightly cloudy rusted red, some dark brown highlights as well, thick tan head forms, settles down to a thick ring, some lacing on the glass, real neat. Smell is insane good, sherry and port, toffee, some alcohol, tons of raisin and date, brown sugar, treacle, dark fruit, plums, very rich, very complex. Taste is similar, very intense sweet caramel and raisin, brown sugar, prunes, some alcohol, very earthy, lots of fruit, dates, port, lightly grapey, nicely balanced in the finish, incredibly complex and drinkable. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with low carbonation, some warmth going down. Wow is this stuff good, like a more complex Hardy's, almost as good as the J.W Lee's 97. Amazing, need to get some more! Thanks Greg!"
"D- This is a great barleywine to sip on on a cold day."
"Pours an earthy rosewood with a silky tan head. Fantastic nose of nutty malts, oaky bourbon, dark pitted fruits, vanilla, sweet alcohol and subtle hops. Taste is equally imressive. Again powered by big bready malts, cherries, figs, bourbon, oak, vanilla, caramel, peppery alcohol and light floral hops. Smooth creamy body is delicately carbonated. Fantastic stuff, right up there with the best."
"Yummalisus!"
"Nice sticky, thick mouthfeel. Impressive."
"It's not always about how a beer looks or tastes, it's how you engage with it. Like the mighty stallion, this is something recognizably bigger than ourselves, to whom we treat with gentle praise and respect. You approach and interact with the beer in slow, respectful sips. You both acknowledge and appreciate its power. And, in this case, I must also acknowledge and appreciate the generous BuckeyeNation for providing me with the sample!"
"Taste matches the aroma well, with lots of complex toffee malts and a flavorful boozy liquor presence of brandy and rum. Bread and biscuits lurk in the background with a pinch of earthen hops. Body is smooth to no end (not creamy), with a near-perfect carbonation level and a medium-thick mouthfeel. I really enjoyed this beer, not only a fantastic introduction to Midnight Sun, but a great barleywine as well! Highly recommended."
"Viscous sticky texture. Quite drinkable for what it is."
"d) very drinkable. A spendy beer at $15 a pop so something you bring out for a special treat. Very happy that this beer is very available in Oregon. Tremendous Barley Wine."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and rich with some carbonation."
"Drinkability= @ 10%, along with the sweetish thick mouthfeel, does not make the drinkability that high. With that being said, I finished this beer no problem."
"Purchased: Liquid Solutions"
"poured into my duvel tulip glass, poured a rich thick borwn that cant be seen through, a rich creamy five finger head rises to the top and stays awhile, the smell is rich grain and alchoal with a sweet fig overtone, the flavor is figs, hazelnuts, molasses, honney, sweet malt, a hint of folaral hops then malt for days. this hides the alochal well and is a beer that i would love to get more of"
"D: I could drink this as much as I was physically capable. Great stuff."
"D: In spite of the high ABV, I had no difficulty with this one. A truly exceptional barleywine in my view. Hop lovers may be disappointed. This is the antithesis of a ""San Diego"" beer."
"Pours a murky deep brown with a fast one finger khaki colored head that disappears into almost nothing. Mediocre spotty lacing clings to the sides of the glass. Smell is dominated by the malts. Mostly dark fruits in the nose; dates, raisins, fig, and overripe cherries. Leather and pipe tobacco leaves add an interesting aroma as well. A good dose of booze can be detected in each whiff too. Taste starts off with a strong alcohol sting followed by syrupy caramel malts and earth. Midway, more booze with licorice, molasses, and brown sugar. The finish burns the back of my throat with spice and rich nutty flavors. Malt monster from start to finish lacking the bitterness to balance it out. Big body and a strong sting from, what else, but the alcohol along with a flowing carbonation. The 10% is clearly there, and if I didn't know ahead of time, I would have guessed it was upwards of 15%. Ugh, I gotta go run and get a Zantac..."
"pours up a brown color with amber edges and a small tan head. the nose is lots of malts (the malts smell foreign, maybe German?), mollasses, powdered chocolate. Wooo! A nice big beer! I taste chocolate powder, subtle caramel, very earthy, yeasty, subtle fruit, sweet. Full bodied, low carbo, very smoothe. I do love me some Midnight Sun!"
"Overall, I am extremely gracious that I had the gumption to open this bottle. I have been wanting to try it, but was just afraid of opening it up. Drinking this makes me want to move out west, immediately. Highly recommended."
"07/09/08. - - Courtesy of tpd975. Pours amber with tan head. The aroma is big and inviting with caramel and rich dark fruity esters of grapes, plums and sweet berries before it heats up a bit. The taste is rich and yummy but does have some alcohol welling up. I get creamy caramel candy and some nutty roasty malts. Then the big dark fruitiness comes in and rides into the finish along with a warming alcohol sensation. Leaves a sweet lip smacking feeling behind. <br /><br /> Sampled at the O-Town throwdown. This beer has a nearly opaque copper color with thin tan head. The aroma is pretty big with lots of dark fruitiness and with hints of caramel and sweet malts. There also seems to be some whisky and alcohol in the background. The flavor is delicious barleywine dark and shriveled fruit flavors with a whisky and sweet caramel under currents. It ends sweet, syrupy and rather nice."
"Notes from 4/15/05"
"It pours with about 1 fingers worth of head. The color is a nice dark brown color. Definitely no light coming through it. The smell is a nice sweet licorice. The taste is pretty over powering. You start out with the same licorice taste and then it becomes more sweet almost a brown sugar sweetness taste. There is some bite to the taste showing the alcohol content here. It does leave the brown sugar as an after taste. I really enjoy this particular barleywine and have managed to store another away to age for a little while. I am sure the taste will settle down some more."
"Definitely a sipper by the fireside."
"Tastes wet sweet, nice caramel and buttery with some sherry-like (soured caramel) oxidation. dark fruits heavy in the mouth (fig and brown raisin). Touch of scorch to the toffee. Thick dextrinous mouthfeel, yet dries in the finish. Modest carbonation at best. Yummy."
"Pours a thick, viscous , hazy, dark chestnut with a thin swirly head that disappears to a thin ring. Smells rich, malty, winey, and syrupy with some spicebox notes and yeasty fruitiness. The taste is huge and thick and spicy. Quite sweet up-front, but spicy, tannic, and dry at the finish. Big pine spiciness, some rich cellared fruit, alcohol heat, sweet mat, and a big tannic bitterness. This is a huge, over-the-top beer- and I love it! Mouthfeel is rich and viscous and tannic and hot. Can't drink too much of this stuff!"
"A very unique brew for sure. This is my first English Barley Wine and I have to say it certainly hasn't let me down. With that being said I don't think this is really my type of beer, more of those every once and a while brews. It's huge at around 14%, so after the bomber is done you've got a nice little buzz on. I'd definitely recommend sipping on this one to take the time to enjoy it's flavors."
"Warming reach of brandy-soaked dark fruits up front. Develops some caramel malt sweetness with a vinous edge. Hints of vanilla, sherry, and oak. Rich cookie and caramel malt settle in mid-palate before giving way to warming alcohol and mildly herbal bitter hops. Long finish with lingering caramel, toffee, and fruit. Full-bodied with a thick, lush, creamy feel. Very nice!"
"I thought about trading this one, but I'm glad I didn't. Definitely worth the trouble of acquiring."
"d: This might be the best English barleywine I've tried. $16 a bomber means this will probably be my only bottle, but I don't regret the purchase."
"Cheers"
"D: Pungent alcohol on this one, fairly high, but it's very interesting and unique - one of my new favorites of the style."
"Pours a deep, deep copper with a two-finger buttery head which linger throughout and leaves sporadic lacing. Aroma is big on dark fruits, figs and raisins mainly, and caramel malts. Alcohol burn really comes out as it warms. Taste is big and roasty, with dark fruits dominating. Toffee and caramel malts are present throughout with a definite alcohol burn and a hint of oak in the finish. Mouthfeel is incredible and silky smooth with strong carbonation. This is definitely a sipper and a fantastic barleywine."
"05 bottle sampled at the RBSG 08 Grand Tasting. Big thanks to whoever brought it. Pours golden brown with a tan head that leaves wet spotty lacing. Deep caramel aroma with some leafiness. Tobacco? Hops? Flavor is toffee based, with notes of prune, molasses, berries, and wood. Finish is earthy with some vanilla. Full bodied with a very smooth mouthfeel."
"Thanks to jtrcockchalk...quite possibly one of BA's top 5 finest traders? You are the man, that's the least that can be said!"
"A foam brick of three fingers of rich tan carmel head rises to the top of the glass. Body is of the deepest brown as it settles into the glass almost black. Nose is absolutely delecious in itself with rich toffee malt tones. Carmel honey and vanilla twirl together very well, I could sniff all day. Massive richness soaks the tongue with firest sip. Toasted and almost burnt malts mix with some spiceyness on the front of the palate. A solid dose of carmalized thickness is no surprise. As you continue to drink, you get some dark fruit and crisp apple feel. A dry powdery thick bitterness develops the mouthfeel. Overall I would put this in the catagory of delecious sipper."
"Do I really need to say it? Thanks Frank!"
"Pours a cloudy deep amber/ brown-ish color with a small tannish head. In the aroma, dark fruit, raison, fig, and licorice. In the taste, big licorice and fig, with a small bitterness in the end. A smooth and medium mouthfeel, with a dry syrupy and dark fruit aftertaste. Hides the alcohol in flavor, but can feel the burn, yet a bit syrupy."
"Overall I thought this was an outstanding selection from MS. Really a top notch beer here. Not so much a barley wine as it was a bit bigger then that. Very good though and something that I will look to buy a few to cellar."
"D- I think this is an easy beer to drink. The ABV seems to be quite potent in this brew. Or perhaps I should have just eaten more for lunch."
"D: Extremely good for the style and ABV. I could have enjoyed an entire bomber myself."
"Overall, a very good English Barleywine. This isn't my favorite style - I lean more toward hoppier American Barleywines - but I found this quite enjoyable. I imagine this would age quite well, but it's drinking quite nicely right now."
"Drinkability is moderate, the alcohol presence is hard to avoid in a strong b-wine like this but the flavors and complexity make up for the high abv, nice post-dinner drink that you will want to enjoy slowly and probably wouldn't drink all night long"
"A very solid barleywine. One of my favs."
"Drinks great for the style & this is a great English Barley wine with a bit of a twist, this devil will get to you before you get to him! Great offering, better than this rating! But very few beers/wines or liquors are worth this price (unless bootlegged)"
"$18 for the '08 22-oz bottle. Pours a rich burgandy color with a short lived tan head. Smell is malty, molassesy, with lots of rich chewy, sweet and sticky dried fruits and nuts, along with a noticeable alcohol presence as well. Taste is similarly malty with a dark sweet fruity and nutty flavor. Somewhat prailine like. Really nice flavor aside from the somewhat strong alcohol presence which by the 2nd glass definitely detracts from the beer. Moderate body, to perhaps a bit sticky and syrupy but definitely not overly so. I really loved the unique nutty fruity malty flavor in this and would like it even more if the alcohol tamed down with age. Unique and really nice, but hard to justify the price I paid."
"Drinkability is way to good for a beer I want to forget I have for a couple of years!!! I'm glued to the couch watching the Elite 8 right now after an epic spring powder dump at Mt. Hood today, and can't think of a better choice for melting away my extreme soreness from floating the 2+ ft of freshies. If you like big, fruity English BWs, this is an absolute must try."
"There are hardly better beers to drink in the cold winter months than Barleywines or Russian Imperial Stouts...Midnight Sun are doing right by Alaskans in brewing this sucker."
"Poured into a chalice a nice semi-cloudy dark brown color, some carbonation, nice little fizzy tan head, which leaves som oil slicks and sticky lacing. The nose is malty, some hops, licorice, toffee, some vanilla, alcohol, and caramel. The taste is sweet at first sip, big malts/toffee/alcohol, tones of vanilla and caramel. Medium body, very nice brew, might be a tad too much on the alcohol though, but still very tasty, could turn some people off. Very drinkable, this is the best MS brew for me so far, a very tasty EBWSA. Thanks Brian."
"still very malty sweet, good english barleywine, pricey but will probably age very well, also much stronger than 10%..."
"Really easy to drink. Great sipper on a too cold Saturday night."
"A really interesting barleywine. WAY overpriced. Like, wow. Like... Wow and wow wow overpriced. I'm pissed that I paid so much for it without really noticing. Oh well. Oh. I guess that says how much I liked it, doesn't it? 'Cause, well, I didn't really like it. It's syrupy sweet with little to no bitterness and that alone... Yeah. Only, it's weird. It's not the syrup of a Lee's - it's more like a chocolate syrup. Weird. Only, not really in a good way. Not thrilled with it. Nice and thick. Not opaque enough but really nice head. Too sweet and thick without the bitterness. Well, like an English barleywine. Yawn."
"This barleywine is glorious now. I can't wait to taste it with a little age."
"Pours a two finger light tan head that fades slowly leaving no lace. Cloudy amber/brown color. Light carbonation and heavy bodied. Caramel/alcohol nose. Flavor starts sweet, malty, but the higher ABV (10%) is in your face - leaves an alcohol burn. The difference between this and Avery's Mephistopheles Stout (at 16%) is like night and day. I should have let this age for a few years. Pricey at $15.99 for a 500ml bottle from John's Marketplace Portland, OR."
"I am eager to see how this does with some age."
"Medium body, with low carbonation. I wouold suspect that this will age wonderfully. Very nice."
"definitely one to seek out."
"Still overall it remains smooth and sweet  perfect fit for an English BW. Yum, a real treat, Happy New Year!"
"Arctic devil 2007 vintage. Pours hazy brown, settling in the glass dark almond brown with light haze at the top. Thin ring of head with swirling light carbonation in the center. smell comes of a kind of toasted caramel with slight alcohol tones. Tastes very luxurious and sippable. leaves a sugary residue on the lips, not as strong as JW. Lees but much more syrupy than your average craft brew. taste is very warm and sugary, and not nearly as hoppy as most american brewed barley wines. Goes down smooth, with the exception of a slight alcohol twinge at the finish(very bearable twinge, not like samichlaus or anything) but I suspect the alcohol finish will disappear with age and some of the dark fruit flavors present will increase, with a few years I could see this as one of the top barley wines in america. Reminds me of a darker version of john barleycorn, only more syrupy and sweeter. Great buy!"
"drinking the 07 vintage shortly after it's release. the apperaance is dark at the bottom however the top is hazey caramel colored, with a thin fiml of a head, that sticks just enough to leave that sweet taste on your lip. the smell is warm and caramelish, and the taste is also full of caramel along with some liquor taste on the finish, the mouthfeel is exceptoinal crisp and bitey, however with that heavy liquor taste makes the drinkability(right now) a little rough, but it should improve(and by that i mean mellow) with age"
"Thick and gooey mouthfeel lets you rest you mind and entices the senses on the long finish. Perfect for a cold Ohio night or better yet an Alaskan one."
"Drinkability is great. This is really 10% ABV? Could have fooled me... a classic barley wine. Exceptionally crafted. Smooth, tasty, and with a wonderful warmth while going down the throat. Seek this beer out! It's that good."
"I must admit, I expected good to great things from Arctic Devil Barley Wine, but I didn't expect the magnum opus that is currently occupying my snifter. If you love great beer, do yourself a favor and do anything it takes to acquire a bomber of this outstanding elixir. This is my new gold standard for the English barleywine style."
"Get one if you can! Well worth the effort!"
"This beer was much darker then the other beers, and had something of smokey quality that none of the other beers had. Muted nose, but on the palate one got flavors of cola, caramel, and smoke. The beer was fairly viscuous, and was quite sweet. It ended with a long, smooth finish, with a hint of bitterness at the end. A good beer, but not as fine as I remembered."
"hands down one of the best barleywines I have had.. getting through this bomber will wax me, but hell, I need to get to bed anyway..."
"Aggressive pour shows a small yellowy creamy head that dissipates quickly. Some decent chunkiness and floaties from bottle conditioning. Aroma is a big rich sugary caramel and apple brandy alcohol. Also some dry red wine fruitiness, rich port like aromas. Taste follows with a nice rich maltiness, some coconut alcohol flavor, some nice balancing hop bitterness and a good sized alcohol warmth in the finish. Taste also showed some raisin and caramel in the maltiness. Nice and thick to start, the alcohol seems to become more apparent in the mouthfeel as I get into it. A nice spiciness on the tongue and a sharp bite at the back of the throat. A very nice barleywine, I would definitely say this is much more of an american style than english as it is classified here, easy to drink for its strength, I'd love to have a few of these for the cellar. Thanks Mark."
"Thanks again, Alex!"
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/4"" light brown head above the clear burgundy brew. Head holds on nicely, with heavy, slow-to-fall lace. Aroma is sweetness, dark fruit, and alcohol, all well proportioned. Taste is creamy maltiness upfront, dark fruit and touch of tanned leather in the middle, and massaging alcohol warmth to close. Mouthfeel is wow smooth, and drinkability is scary dangerous for the abv. Seek this one out."
"Beer is good. Happy big bold beering."
"Bomber shared over lunch. Dark brown, bubbly initial head. Although the alcohol isn't very apparent, this is strong and calls for food, It's a sipper. Cinammon and spice and nutty barleywine. Full mouthfeel. Flavorful winter warmer crossover, very good."
"So glad to get to try this one, as I have never really seeked it out...I just may have to after this experience."
"Pours a deep mahogany with reddish hues, A thin one finger tan cap that dissipated into thin lacings. Aroma is sweet caramel and molasses, estery figs, some citrus and floral hops, and a little alcohol. vinous aroma. Explosive rich flavor of figs and molasses, a little tropical fruit, toasted buttery cashews, whiskey, vinous quality, very nice subtle floral and tangerine hop bitterness, undertones of spice and pepper. Alcohol is noticeable with a deep warming effect. Mouthfeel is viscous with a full body, with med-high carbonation, and finishes dry. Exceptional and half-way done with bomber and already feeling good!!! Glad I have a couple more of these cellared."
"22oz bottle that was bottled on November 05. Deep brownish amber with a good sized tan head. Light lacing and good head retention. Aroma is full of sweet ripe dark fruits with some caramel. Molasses and milder notes of bakers chocolate lingering in the back. The flavor starts with more of the ripe fruit notes with sweet caramel. Caramel, toffee and molasses are noted as well. Some earthiness and a nice bitter touch to keep the sweetness in check. Very rich and full flavored. No real signs of alcohol just some warmth as it goes down. Pretty damn thick and smooth as well. Perfectly drinkable to me, big flavor with no harshness at all. Amazing stuff that I wish were available locally."
"Hands down my favorite malty barleywine. Get some."
"Dark ruby. Wonderfully extracted caramel and chocolate malts in the nose, along with the barrel contribution which brings slight aromatics of cocunut, bourbon and wood. Fairly simple aroma but the flavor makes up for it. Chocolate covered raisin flavor with hints of caramel and oak and a touch of hops of the back of tonque. Full, coating flavor. A very good beer."
"Overall, a fine sipping beer with strong character though not a heavy hitter."
"If you see some in your neck of the woods, grab some!!!"
"An exceptional Barleywine."
"Before I review I must say beware of this devil it f*ckin will bite you!Just newly bottled on November 5th this bad boy poured a deep amber with a thin off white head,incredible complexities in the aroma vanilla,oak and kentucky whiskey really hits and hits hard really waking up the senses and quite appetizing.Now I really liked the flavors of this beer but whoo they hit ya,very woody and whiskish (if thats a word) with vanilla and caramel standing out as well.The alcohol burn steals the show it actually burned my nose going down.This beer weighs in at 14% alc although the label says 10% that according to the head brewer at Midnight Sun and it feels like more than that.A very good very complex barley wine but these need to be laid down for awhile thats for sure."
"Flavors that would complement the five star meals served by the two chefs attending Emit and Randy at their long days ends back at their lodge. Complex caramel malts oak flavors swimming in alcolic hopped liquid. Randy, a hophead noted that it was still hoppy thinking that it was this years release - and could use a few more month in the cellar. I did not tell him it was already had a year of aging. I found the hop/malt balance very nice with the bitterness and alcohol countering the sweetness."
"This is one rich beer, almost overpoweringly so, and is dominated by dark fruit flavors. The finish is impressive too. My only complaint is that the sweetness is a bit too much; this brew would be a little more drinkable if the sweetness were a milder. Still, highly recommended."
"Comments  Ms. Skyhand busted out this Barley for her first annual Bring on Da Booze festival, and personally it was the highlight of the evening for me."
"Dark ruddy, muddy, dirty, cola coloured brown with a fizzy, fizzly head that dies out quickly. Aromas are all raisins, dark fruits, plums, residual sugars, and not really a hint of booze. Impressive. Taste follows suit with plenty of malty dark fruit flavors, and candied spicy flavors. Rum raisin cake, maybe? This is really like an old ale, not so much of a barleywine, but hey, who's keepin' score? Mouthfeel is medium bodied and drinkability is pretty good as well. A nice one from AK."
"A better head retention, a touch more complexity, and a little less alcohol would bring this up into world class status! Very nice!"
"Drinkability is really high. Great example of style, incredibly well-balanced."
"Drinkability and Overall: Ok. I absolutely love this beer. One of the more perfect beers in the world. I know it's hard to find, but if you ever come across this beer you have to try it. Honestly a killer beer that is damn near impossible to beat. I bow before this beer."
"Nice one, Midnight Sun!...further into the bottle, prunes are the predominant flavor...not tasted earlier..."
