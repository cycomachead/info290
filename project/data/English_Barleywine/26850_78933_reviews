"O: A nice offering by Against the Grain. The bourbon flavor isn't overpowering. The hoppy profile makes it seem a little closer to an american style barleywine, however."
""
"Nice rich color but a sadly depleted head. Nicely diverse nose of bourbon, pina colada, oranges, some dark fruit, light oak, fudge and caramel. The flavor is perhaps a touch subdued but delicious none the less. Sweet bourbon creme, toffee, caramel, bourbon whiskey, and dry oak wood meet the palate but it ends lightly fruity. This is very thin and the alcohol heat is not hidden but despite this flaw this is a great beer for a nice price."

"A little hoppy for an English Barleywine. Bourbon ads a nice complexity. I wish I would of let this one sit for a while."

"In the end, the light mouthfeel and heat detract from this beer, despite good flavors."

"Had this following White Birch's Ol Cattywhompus. Deeper toffee and caramel flavors with deeper background from the bourbon barrels. Superior to OC but somewhat pricey at $8.50 for a 12 oz. bottle. I have several others I will age. So far the best ATG brew for me."
"Toffee, caramel, red apple, bourbon, vanilla, raisin, brown sugar, light bitterness"

"Flavors are balanced overall, more than most bourbon barrel aged barleywines I've had. For the price are sure buy again and another solid offering from this brewery."

"Overall: first experience with against the grain and I am very impressed. Hits all the checkpoints a great bba english barleywine should."

"Bottle from Hop City when I visited Atlanta. Pours murky brownish amber into my glass with a small yellow khaki head. Nice aroma of sweet fruits, figs, some bron sugar, toffee, vanilla, light booze, and some cardboardyness. Flavor is caramel and fruit, vanilla bourbon, oak, brown sugar. Nice. Medium plus bodied, booze heat, and carbonation that is medium plus (maybe a bit much for the style). Tastes better than it smells. Pretty good stuff with heavy barrel notes."

"Pours a viscous hazy lighter brown color with a light tan head. Smell has has a lot of caramel aromas forward in the nose along with hints of apples bourbon oak and vanilla. Taste follows the nose with sweet caramel and grainy flavors along with apple bourbon toffee tobacco vanilla and oak in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium to thick in body and lightly carbonated."

"Overall: a very well done bba barleywine. great base beer and a good addition of a bourbon character. great vanilla and oak character. Definitely worth a try but has some tough competition in its category."

"Very boozy, sweet, treacle aroma, with toasted oak notes, and hints of raisins. Flavor reveals a very sweet backbone, with huge caramel tones, and a moderately bitter, oaky finish. Bourbon notes and vanilla add complexity. Dates dominate the profile. The oak in the finish provides nice balance. Should age well. I'd like more complex dark fruit character."

"This is quite tasty. It doesn't quite match up to the biggest barrel-aged barleywines that all the kids are talking about, but it's still very good."
""
""
""
"Decadent in finish, the full-bodied taste and texture weighs on the tongue and saturates the tastebuds to utter completion with its piercing booze and understated carbonated lift. Its ""barley liquor"" character numbs the palate and seduces the taste with its boldly laced savory character. Enjoy much more as an after dinner aperitif rather than a drinkable or refresher of a beer."

"From a 12 oz bottle (the first-ever bottle release of this beer) at Bo & Luke Day. Really sweet aroma, and all of the wonderful range of flavors in a barleywine without being so sweet it feels like your teeth are rotting. If this gets out for distribution, don't miss it."

"O- Nice suprise on this one.  Picked it up at Bo & Luke day 2014 from AtG."

"Overall, a very good take on the style. There is just enough barrel aging to impart the vanilla and bourbon characteristics, but without drowning out the base barleywine. The sweetness is pleasant and not cloying, enticing swallow after swallow. I will say that the 80 IBUs surprises me on this one, but perhaps that's the key to preventing a sweet beer from becoming overly so."

"Pours a cloudy, brown color. 1/2 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of alcohol, sweet malt, liquor, wood, yeast, and slight dry hops. Fits the style of an English Barleywine. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of liquor, alcohol, sweet malt, slight hops, sight roasted malt, and slight wood. Overall, good appearance, aroma, body, blend, and complexity."
""
"Overall, the most enjoyable thing about this brew was the quality of the barreling throughout the flavoring. Top notch. The wood added undisputable authenticity of bourbon and heavy, heavy, heavy oakiness, both of which lent a balancing bitterness to the cloy of the malts and residual alcohol sugars. The nose and feel complement the taste well, comfortably marking this beer as a knockout. There are so many layers to the aroma, and it just becomes stickier and stickier with each passing moment. We also loved how it left your mouth both cleanly sweetened and dryly chalked, without offense from either the bitters of the cloy. This is a stellar English barleywine, and should be a foremost example, along with the likes of Artic Devil, of how to properly utilizing barreling."

"Deep, dark chestnut brown under a low, but very sticky, bubbly head. Smooth, sticky dark malt aromas...raisin, wort-like smells, toffee, plum, cherry, and a fairly mellow barrel character with some vanilla creaminess. Smooth caramel, vanilla, oaky spice, dark fruit, black tea, light sherry, nuts, and cherry. Dry with a quick, tidy finish, not cloying in the slightest and the bourbon isn't boozy. Surprising hoppy bitterness in the finish. Heavy and smooth. Not too much barrel or sticky sweetness for its strength. Pretty nice."

"O- Very good beer that I would gladly sip any chance I got. The characteristics of this beer are like a great kindergarten class - it plays well with others and makes even the grumpiest ""grown-up"" smile and reflect on the the amazing simple joys of life. Very well done."

"Must...resist...making...Clash...joke... Whew, that was harder than it should have been... Anyway, this stuff pours a clear garnet topped by a half-finger of off-white foam. The nose comprises sweet caramel, sweet toffee, light oak, light walnut, mild vanilla bean, and a hint of dark fruits in the background. Everything coalesces amiably around a thin core of mild booze. The taste brings in more of the same, with a bit of bourbon, a heightened sense of fruitiness, and some added sweetness from a buttercream character. Damn, this is some tasty shit! The body is a hefty medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, a very nice b-wine, possibly the best AtG has made (at least from the selection we've received here in Chicago thus far). Get some."
"Sweet toffee, caramel, and vanilla in the aroma, sweet with some depth to it. Rich toffee flavor punctuated by an odd sweet candy note like gummy fruit. To be hyper specific: raspberry ""Nordic Sweets Forest Berries"" gummy candy ... strange. Could be the port sweetness coming through possibly. Smooth feel, rich and not overly cloying, but the candy note is ever present. Dry malty finish. Worth a try, though the flavors didn't really coalesce to me."

"O - A solid beer from Against the Grain that makes me want to try to find more of their beers. Has a great smell and a complex flavor profile. I would like it to be just a bit smoother. Like that it takes a strong presence from the bourbon barrel - 4"

"Overall, I really enjoyed this brew. The drinkability is rather high and since the alcohol is well hidden it quickly sneaks up on you. By no means is this a King Henry, but a growler for ~$10, this is awesome. Complexity is very well balanced."
"One other thing. Dear ATG - please bottle this stuff so I can trade it! It's wrong to keep this good a beer entirely within our state."
""
"O: This is a very nice English barleywine. Try it if you get the opportunity."
"O - I've wanted to try a barrel-aged barleywine for a long time, and it was awesome to find this one right in my backyard. Even better, the guys running the place are passionate and doing it for the right reasons. A great brew that I highly recommend."
"Great Job ATG!! My favorite so far there."
