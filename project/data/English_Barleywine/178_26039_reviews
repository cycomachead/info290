"This is what you sip in the middle of winter nestled in a huge, cozy chair in front of the hearth... or spazzing out to your favorite metal band at bone-rattling volume. It will serve both purposes equally well."
"This beer ends up being too one dimensional, the amount of sugar overhelms in the beer, and takes away from any other characteristics."

"Not a beer I was very impressed by especially given the $10 price for a 250ml bottle.  Sweetness that is quite unpleasant and so strong that it detracts from the flavors that are more enjoyable like the vanilla, caramel and oaky barrel notes."
"Opened my first bottle today. Poured into my teku glass. This unassuming little bottle of beer is wonderful.  Unique flavors - earthy, raisins, maybe a little apple. Wished I hadn't waited so long to try it!  So good I went back and got a second bottle."

"BOD 2013.  Pours a hazy medium amber with a dark ruby hue.  Above average head volume, exceptional lacing and retention.  Light nose of sweet fruit (plum), caramel and toasted brown sugar over a light sherry alcohol note.  Medium body with a texture that approaches creamy.  Below normal carbonation with just a hint of effervescence in the finish.  The flavor profile is very intense, very complex and somewhat balanced considering the intensity.  It begins with a malt bomb assault of sweetness that is caramel and toasted brown sugar.   As the sweetness subsides (it never really leaves) notes of plum emerge over a slight note of nuts.  The middle is where the alcohol predominates with a sherry undertone over a sweetness that is honey like.  The finish is a slow fade of sherry like alcohol over a honey like sweetness.  The lack of balance is what holds this one back from being outstanding."
"Overall. Insanely good as I was told it would be. As the bruh that gave it to me will point out, I'm very open to suggestion when it come to beer, but this really is great tasting stuff."

"This was my first JW Lees cask aged beer. Poured the entire bottle into into a tulip glass, which was probably a mistake. Significant amount of yeast ended up floating in the beer. The floating bits were much more distracting than I recall in other beers. It did effect the taste and mouthfeel until everything settled. There is very little carbonation anyway, so a gentle pour wouldn't have any real downside. Taste was surprisingly delicate with no sherry alcohol burn. Caramel sweetness upfront with a lingering sugary sweetness. Heavy soy sauce taste hit the back of the tongue."

"9.3oz bottle. Pours a dark rusted cloudy orange brown with a quickly fading small white head. Aroma of sweet fruit , caramel and toffee notes, with some sweet alcohol esters. Taste same as aroma with some fine notes of aged sherry cask wood flavors with light hops notes and sweet alcohol. Palate is a full body and flavor, smooth and sweet sherry cask notes with mild carbonation. Finishes is sweet, fruity, with some nice caramel and toffee flavors and sweet aged sherry cask woody notes with alcohol lingering awhile. Overall a very good, flavorful brew."

"Slightly hazy deep brown color with a minimal bubbly off white head. Aromas of caramel and brown sugar with bits of fruity esters and a touch of earthy and sherry. The flavor is rich and sweet with caramel maltiness offset with some fruity vinous notes. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation. Decent beer, my first time having the sherry version. I think its either inferior to the regular harvest ale or in a weird aging stage that leaves a bit to be desired before its a stellar brew again. I'm hoping for the later and an opportunity to try this again with some more age."

"An absolutely delicious complex beer."
"Overall - I liked this beer a lot, but it really needs to be shared with a friend or two. Verticals make for interesting comparisons."

"2012 dated bottle from a trip to Hoboken. Pours a deep orange red hue with a tiny ring of white head that fizzes off very quickly. Aroma is big sweetness with lots of sherry, toffee, molasses, maple syrup, and a little hint of fruits. Flavor is surprisingly similar to the Calvados cask. A good bit of bitter hazelnut alongside leather, sweet caramel maple and brown sugar. Sweet but this had a nice balanced bitter and medium level sherry booze and the sherry really accents this nicely. Sweet heavy mouthfeel but with adequate carbonation to keep this from being syrupy. Overall a really nice treatment on this that makes for a beautiful after dinner drink with a nicely complex flavor profile."

"Overall: tasty and extremely drinkable. Bam!"

"Pours a hazy orange-ish to amber color with a light tan head. In the aroma, dark fruits, small hop presence, and an alcohol presence. In the taste, dark fruits, caramel like malt and a small alcohol presence. A small bite and a medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry caramel and alcohol like aftertaste. Big dark fruits, caramel malts, a small hop and a nice amount of alcohol in the flavor."
""
""
"Overall: An interesting brew. The years have taken well to this beer, making in a unique journey for the palate. I was really surprised how pronounced the earthy tones were, a lot of maple, leafy greens, and tobacco."

"O- Excellent barleywine, At 11.5 %, I'm glad I had this 5 year old one instead of fresh. Only aged barley wine I've had and liked more was an '04 Stone Old Guardian tapped at the brewery new years eve 2010."
""
"O: this aged better than the Lagavulin cask edition, retaining some of the barrel flavors and aromas; I knew to be more watchful of the sediment, although I don't know if that matters in any way that affects the flavor/aroma - whatever the sediment was going to impart has been long imparted. A fine drink."
""
"overall - you can taste the contribution of the grapes from the sherry. fruit notes added. great, but just not as good as the normal version when aged."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours an opaque orane color with a creamy, tight-packed head. Not too much of a nose, but a bit boozy and warm. Tastes sweet with caramel hints. The boozyness continues throughout, but it gives it warmth and isn't unpleasant. The beer isn't over-carbonated, and is nice. It's really smooth and I'd enjoy drinking this again. It's a pretty good beer overall."

"P.S. My first review - Please message me if I did something wrong."

"O: Very similar to the port version only this is slightly less sweet and syrupy and far more palatable. It's very nice but not something I'd drink often."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: It's just way too damn sweet for me. I would have liked to try the others, not sure if I want to now. But maybe this is just so sweet from the sherry?"
""
""
"Overall? Good, solid, unique beer. I couldn't name another sherry-aged beer. Now just the Port version to go, & looking forward to it."
""
"Overall - Big beer. A sipper. A sugary sipper. It's complex, though. It's one of those beers you can ponder for a while. Maybe the result of the pondering isn't the best, but the activity of drinking it is nice."

"Note: 2010 vintage"
"Pours a nice hazy orange/reddish colour. I love the aspects of the Harvest Ale base that are present in the smell and taste. There was a really nice amount of carbonation that balances out the sweetness of the base nicely. The sherry cask's contribution to the taste is actually pretty well integrated and pleasant, but I don't love the contribution to the nose. It's just a little overwhelming for me. Everything else about the beer is really enjoyable and I look forward to trying the other versions of this beer."
"A murky, iced tea brown color with no head or lacing. A thin collar surrounds the glass. The nose is full of sweet sherry, tobacco, raisins, cocoa, brown sugar, and molasses. This versions tends to enhance the sweeter characteristics of the base beer. On the palate, raisins and cocoa hit you up front, then a wave of sweet sherry, with molasses, brown sugar, and dry tobacco in tow. The finish is sweet and boozy. Full body, low carbonation. High complexity. This varietal was more enjoyable than the Lagavulin. The sherry flavors/aromas imparted by the aging process seemed much better incorporated and really enhanced some of the other flavors that weren't present in the other version."
""
"O: Honestly not a bad variant. The sherry is very mild but it helps ease some of the ridiculously cloyingly sweet molasses. Not to say that it's NOT ridiculously cloyingly and syrupy sweet, just less so."
"Overall, too sweet for me. Some very nice flavours, but too sweet and sherry is not one of my favourite flavours. Worth checking out but I don't expect I would buy this again."
""
"O: This is a fantastic English barleywine, and may very well be my favorite of J.W. Lees' cask-aged ales. Definitely worth a try."
""
"D - Very drinkable. The Sherry adds a nice complexity to the base beer. Overall nicely bold and fairly balanced."
""
"Pours a murky honey orange with a foamy orange-tan head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, honey, brown sugar, wood, and sherry/alcohol. Taste is much the same with a nice sherry and woody aftertaste. There is a medium amount of bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that features a nice barrel aged treatment."

"o - Overall a decent beer but my least favorite of the variants so far. I like the normal Harvest Ale, and love English barleywine's in general, but for some reason can't get into the variants at all; I really don't think they add anything good to the base beer. This one had some weird clay-like smells and tastes to it. I'd personally rank them the normal Harvest Ale, Calvados, Port, and then Sherry. Wouldn't seek it out again."
""
"D: As I mentioned earlier, it's definitely a sipper. Others have mentioned it's a good nightcap, and that's exactly how I'm drinking it. Not sure if I'm entirely sold on English barleywines, but it's definitely a good beer...just not my particular style of choice"
"O - damn J.W... the whole series is great from what I have had... if you find any of them do your self a favor and make the purchase! This as well as the others are very complex... a bit pricy but well worth it. What is even greater is that you can find bottles as far back as 2005! I will be seeking bottles of this out for years to come."
"overall: Very nice. Better at this age than the Port version I recently had, but also has 2 years age on the 2010 Port version. We'll see what happens as this ages further."
"Cheers!"
"Fantastic; possibly the best I've tried in the style, though I've yet to try any of the other barrel aged versions of this beer."
""
"Pours a hazy mahogany with a thin white head that settles to a slight haze and ring. Moderately sweet aromas of caramel, ripe pear, and toffee with a ton of oak and Sherry character. Taste is right in-line with the nose, the oaky Sherry character definitely overpowers the rest of the beer, and I'm getting a decent amount of oxidation. Mouthfeel is smooth and sticky, with a medium-full body and low carbonation. Overall a decent treatment of J.W. Lees, but Sherry already isn't my preferred taste, so I didn't enjoy this as much as the ""regular"" or Calvados versions I had alongside it."
""
""
"Notes: Darker, sweeter with less sediment than the Port version of cask aged JWL Harvest. This is simply too sweet to enjoy."
"Yep this is a good one. J.W. Lees makes the definitive Barleywines. I really like what the Sherry casks add. Something I would highly recommend."
"Overall this is a great beer to spend an evening sipping on and enjoying its nuances."

"O-An excellent example of how barrel aging can add a new layer to a beer without disrupting its true character."

"(D)- Another interesting take on the JW Lee's Harvest. Perhaps a tad richer than usual, though very smooth and drinkable for the style."

"O - Overall this beer wasnt that bad. Nice appearance, aroma, and mouthfeel. The sherry just doesnt work for me, I prefer the original harvest line."
"O: This is enjoyable, but I'd still give the nod to the Port and Calvados versions out of all the cask treatments."
"Got a pretty nice sample of this one not too long ago at the Bethlehem Speakeasy. They had just gotten a shipment in and the bartenders were trying it and offered some to me and another gentlemen who was sitting at the bar at the time. The beer was poured into a sampling snifter. The beer looked like I remembered it when I had it a few years ago. The smell was very sweet and quite inviting. The taste is also sweet with plenty of flavorful malts and some sherry hints in there. The mouthfeel of this brew is just like the others. Minimal carbonation but had a great thick feel to it. Overall this one's my favorite out of all four. I don't really know what it is but I really enjoy this one."
"overall, i tasty, tasty beer; rich and complex, yet not flawless."
"Overall a great maltbomb. Very fruity and sweet. Intense brown sugar and dark fruit; along with a pleasant woody quality."
"Quite and experiance, a monster of a barleywine, very desert like. Almost like drinking actual sherry."
"mouthfeel - had this the same night as a 98-00 vertical of the regular harvest ale and while the mouthfeel is much nicer and much less cloying its still in the same boat, something id be more than happy to have every night in the winter"
"2003 bottle: Pours an amber color with some red color on the outside with a thin off-white head. Aroma is of sherry, caramel, dark fruits, cherry, and some alcohol. Flavor is basically the same with sherry, cherry, dark fruits and plenty of caramel and sweet malts. Very delicious, but I think I still liked the aged Harvest Ale better."
"Price = $11.99 at Whole Foods NYC"
"Drink- The cask versions are very nice and quite different from a lot of things I have had. I was particularly fond of this blend and I'm hoping the whiskey and port will come through as the best two so far."
"(275ml bottle). Pours cloudy reddish-brown coor with minimal off-white head. It's quite impressive to look at. The aroma is sherry, booze, sweet caramel and chocolate malts. I could smell it the moment I popped the cap. Taste is sweet with roasted-almost burnt-nuts and chocolate. A little sweet wine is present also. Full bodied with a sticky texture and smooth finish. This is one nice beer."
"2006 bottle. Pours brown with floaties and no head. Ehh. Smells like sugar, apple, caramel. Smells pretty good. Taste is very sweet and smooth in the front - very tasty up front, then the finish dries a bit with a touch of smokiness, though it's still sweet. I can't help but notice the ""ham"" flavor in the finish. It drives me nuts as it just lingers. Gross. Sugar just hangs out on the tongue with a heavy mouthfeel and almost no carbonation. Not very drinkable because of the ham, but definitely hides booze well. The ham just kills it for me...Hard to get through."
"2005 Vintage. 9.3oz bottle. Pours a rusty brown color with tons of sediment floating around. Thin layer of head that dissipates rapidly. Kind of smells like a boozey caramel apple. Strong alcohol aroma. Flavors of caramel, sherry, alcohol, apple, and slightly bready. Pretty boozey tasting. Even with this beer being less than 12oz the booziness make this a sipper for certain. Overall it is an alright brew but the price helps make this time probably the only time I will drink it."
"Should probably note that I'm not a big fan of the flavors imparted from cask conditioning in general, but I really love the JW Lees Harvest ale."
"I like J.W. Lees, but I much prefer the Lagavulin version. This one was my least favorite. If you are a fan of Sherry though, I think this one will do you right."
"Drinkability is good. The sherry cask version has all of the complexities that makes J.W. Lees Harvest Ale a great beer. However, it is probably the sweetest of the four variations, which brings down the drinkability half a point. Splitting a bottle with another person is about perfect. I'll probably hang onto my other bottles for awhile before trying it again, but this is surprisingly smooth for only 2 years of age. Definitely worth checking out if you like English barleywines."
"Overall I like it quite a bit. Not my favorite of the Lees cask flavors, but not my least favorite for sure."
"D: In my opinion the weakest of the JW Lee's barrel experiments. Still a good beer, but doesn't reach out and grab you or dazzle with its complexity."
"I'm still impressed that the base beer can be improved upon by soaking up the best characteristics of the barrels it is aged in, but these special editions of Harvest Ale have certainly ""matured"" more than simply ""aged."""
"moderate body, almost syrupy. touch of resins. gentle carbonation for some body, very light tingle and flavor lift."
"I certainly won't be trying this again (unless it's at 50 cents a bottle cause i'll drink it nightly for that!!!)."
"The body is thick but not as syrupy as you might expect with the sweetness, still a chore to drink too quickly. A nice night cap beer, or to sip in a red leather chair while contemplating the finer aspects of life."
"Drinkability: Just a superb English barleywine with incredible complexity"
"Delicious beer yet too expensive. Good for a special occasion."
"THIS is goddamn barleywine."
"D- This quaffable masterpiece is dangerously drinkable. The alcohol is well-hidden... and the 7 years of age has done wonders for it! It's a damn shame I only have one 2003 vintage left in the cellar!!"
"Wow, very thick and full bodied mouthfeel. Sweet and boozy! Caramel like sweetness, heavy malts. Booze warmth slides easily down the throat with a smokey finish. This is an incredible beer!"
"Disapointing version of something I normally like. Big full mouthfeel, but sourish aroma and only average taste. I cellared with for about 20 months and it has a long shelflife. A bit of sherry, but not too complex. Sorry, not finishable. I guess I am not a sherry fan."
"D- Strong. A good sipper. I like this one much more than the whiskey and port cask versions."
"D: Not a quaffing beer, that's for sure. But for what it is -- a cognac-style sipper -- it's nice enough. It would probably take awhile to finish the entire 9+ oz bottle by myself, but as I split it 3 ways, I would've liked to have had a little more."
"Drinkability is pretty good. This is a very solid barleywine overall, although not quite as awesome as the regular and port barrel Harvests in my opinion."
"2004. A little hazy, ruddy brown with a thin collar of beige bubbles and short-lived spotty lace. Tons of caramel and toffee in the aroma, fruity, cherries, bready and malty, sugary, raisins. Rich, malty flavour, almost non-existant bitterness, same character as with the aroma but with a hint of chocolate. Very sweet with a bit of alcohol flavour and warmth in the finish. Lingering dried fruit and earthy sweetness. Low carbonation, heavy body, a bit sticky."
"D: I shared this bottle with a friend. This beer would be undoubtedly cloying if I tried to drink it all myself."
"D: Perfect beer for a cold January night, love the flavors from the sherry casks, this is a huge beer that is not for everyone but it was just right for me."
"D: Not something I'd grab for regularly, but a cold winter day is a good catalyst for grabbing it. It's delightfully intoxicating and great smelling, but the heatness of the alcohol in the finish is displeasing."
"Taste was to complex for my palatte after a few Life and Limbs. Again loads of boozy sherriness"
"Tonight revisiting this beer with a bottle from the 2007 vintage.  Very little seems to have changed in that the flavors are all much as described above.  While there may be a faint hint of oxidations, it is quietly in the background and easily ignored whole enjoying the complexity of this beer.  But I've also discovered that for me there's not enough value added from having cellared this beer for the 5 years since I purchased it."
"O: Great beer, definitely worth the price. Don't poor the bottom!"
"D - For what it is, very tasty and easy down."
"Poured into a chalice a cloudy light brown/pink color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy off-white head, minimal sticky lacing left behind. The nose is very nice, malty, with some sheery/oak notes, slight bourbon, and caramel. The taste is awesome, malty, sweet, very nice woodsy/sherry/oak/bourbon notes, with some nice caramel thrown in. Medium body, the ABV is hidden very well with this brew. Very drinkable, what an awesome brew, highly recommended."
"Beer pours a deep raspberry color and surprisingly pours very clear for a barleywine...I can only imagine that the cask actually helped to clear this beer out. It pours with a thin lacing of head that lingers for a good long time and leave a nice lace on the glass as the beer empties. The smell is amazing. It's much sweeter smelling than the normal JW Lee's. It smells of sweet alcohol, toffee, berries and figs. The taste is much of the same. Its a very sweet, but not annoyingly sweet. Tastes of fermented fruits are up front that fade into the heavy malt taste of the english two row and crystal malts. This beer has a bizzare mouth for me...its buttery and sweet with a moderate feel, but its still seems a big thin for a barleywine....once again I would think the cask thinned this beer out. Overall, a great beer, incredibley complex, just tons of flavors and layers going on. I enjoy the sherry aspect of this beer it adds sweetness and really makes the beer feel unique in your mouth. Delicious!"
"Surprising that this one still poured with a 1 inch head that lasted the whole time. Under the head, a deep amber brown body. Complex aromas include vanilla, leather, dark grapes and unlit tobacco. Not sure if I could pick it out in a blind tasting but I pick up some sherry in the taste. More dark fruits and some molasses are present but not overboard. Since it's been aged about 5 years, I can't tell it's almost 12 percent. No ABV is noticeable is the mouth, not even a tingle. Thick and creamy coating on the tongue. This beer is an explosion of complex flavors, every sip is a taste bud orgasm."
"Obnoxious price does not buy a good review. Disappointing, not recommended. Sure glad I didn't pay for it. Unbelievably overpriced."
"M&D - still exceptionally smooth, a bit thinner than the calvados, but not as thin as the whisky vintage, quite a well crafted beer as all three that i tasted are"
"2007 vintage. This poured a nearly opaque light copper with no head and lots of sediment. It smelled surprisingly similar to the standard Harvest Ale, with lots of sugary caramel and honey wheat and dried apricot, but no real noticeable sherry. It tasted fairly similar to the standard Harvest Ale also, but not as sweet up front. It had more oak character, and had a bit of sherry in the aftertaste. It was a little thicker than the standard Harvest Ale, which was nice. Overall this was an excellent beer, but not terribly distinguished from the other J.W. Lees. I didn't pick up on much sherry flavor or scent, but there was noticeably more oak from the cask aging. This rounded out the beer's flavor, balancing against the sweetness, and hiding the alcohol a bit better. So this was easier to drink and a bit more enjoyable in the end."
"9.3 ounce bottle, brewed in 2006. Served in a snifter, the beer pours a murky copper color with a very small off-white head that went away pretty quickly. Not much lacing, either. The aroma is dark fruit (raisins, figs), sherry, brown sugar and sweet malt. The taste is similar to the aroma, it's very sweet and malty. I can taste brown sugar, toffee, raisins, figs, molasses and sweet malt. Alcohol is also noticable in the taste, but that's a good thing for this beer. Mouthfeel/body is full, it's smooth, thick and oily with low carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's enjoyable to drink but it's a sipping beer for me, anyway. All in all I think this is a pretty good brew. I think I'll have to buy another couple bottles of this and let it age longer and see how it turns out."
"D: This is a wonderful sipper. Somehow even more palatable than J.W. Lee's vintage harvest ale... I didn't think that would be possible."
"Drinkability- A bit too sweet, this could have been a 6 or 8oz beer and satisfied me just as much. Huge flavors, a dessert in it's own."
"Drinkability is low on this one. Do I WANT one? Hell yes! I don't think I could drink more than one at a time, though."
"Exceptional beer."
"D - Not the biggest fan of barleywines, but some of them do taste rather well, and this one was good"
"D- Nice tasty treat. I found it vital to swirl this aggressively around the palette like wine as it gives this the recognition it deserves."
"2005 vintage consumed Dec. 2007. Pours a clear pale copper with white head. The aroma has classic barleywine notes of figs, prunes and raisins mixed with sweet malts and caramel. There's also a nice wood note in the nose mingling with a sense of the ABV. The taste begins with a bolt of carbonation punctuating the figs and sweet cherry notes. Then a malty sweetness mixed with a hint of wood joins mild caramel as the flavor moves to the finish. Smooth. Very nice caramel candy and wood notes linger at length in the after taste along with sweet dark fruity esters."
"Drinkability is good, this is a great brew and I really dig the different cask aging. Still, it's a bit hot in the belly, and not my favorite of the line up, and at the price it commands, not something I will be drinking on any kind of regular basis. Still worth holding on to a few for the long haul, and worth seeking out - I'd certainly never turn one down!"
"Bottle: Poured a deep cloudy amber color ale with a small foamy head with minimal retention and not much lacing. Aroma consists of sweet malt with some distinctive sherry notes. Taste is a mix between some sherry and sweet English barley. Body is full with some average carbonation and no discernable alcohol which is always welcome for those barrel-aged beers. Well balance overall with not too much Sherry and the base beer is not too sweet - well done."
"This is a desert brew and should be treated as such so the 12 oz were more than enough in one sitting. But I will try this one again"
"this will be rating #1000 on Beerpal .... what an amazing beer. Lots of sherry notes with dark fruits ... very sweet and cheeky ... almost no alcohol detected, all the complex flavours worked very well with each other ...one of the most regal and well made cask aged beers around .."
"J. W. Lees Vintage Harvest Ale was reviewed first because I wanted to have a baseline with which to appreciate the cask-aged versions. These special release Harvest Ales will be reviewed in reverse order of my preference for the wine or liquor: Sherry Cask, Port Cask, Calvados Cask, and Lagavulin Whisky Cask. Is it possible that the other are this amazing?"
"Not my fav from JW but still GREAT. Poured a nice brandy color with some sediment floating around. Nose was of of deep english malts, earth tones and sweet smell of sherry. Taste is exactly the same, with dried fruit and perhaps brown suar. There is alot going on here and i like it. This is an easy sipper and one to enjoy for an hour. Very good and one of my fav JW Lees."
"Oh, and the sherry flavor comes through nicely...even strongly. If you don't like sherry, you won't like this. Luckily sherry is one of the few stronger liquors that I like, and also being into barleywines, it seemed a winner before even popping the top. It could've still gone very wrong in the hands of a lesser brewer, but no...this is great stuff for slow sipping and quiet contemplation."
"It was a real treat though to catch at the beginning of the blossom. It packs a mean punch, has started to fruit up, and still has the structure of a big beer. I am always amazed at the staying power of these beers. At year five it was aged enough to enjoy yet still tight enough to command respect."
"A true treat that is a definite sipper. I WILL seek more of these out and buy them on a regular basis."
"Drinkability: I do like the sherry flavor, but unfortunately it doesn't really do enough to buoy the leaden sugars that overwhelm this beer - nor is it interesting enough to warrant those sugars, or the big ABV, for that matter. I suppose this deserves some points for its totally undetectable alcohol, but then again, a little spicy heat might help to fence in its out-of-whack sweetness."
"I think I can safely say this is on of the best barrel-aged beers I've ever tried. Clearly top quality oak was used (I hate the use of oak chips). I'm cellaring one of these for sure. Bravo to J.W. Lees, once again proving why they are one of the world's best breweries."
"A very unique experience, but one I'm probably not going to go to repeat at this price point."
"I am not reviewing this beer as an English Barleywine alone but one aged in a sherry cask (duh). 2006 vintage. Pours a dark orange straw color with little head and no carbonation. Smells intensely like sherry, vanilla, nutty, orange, and alcohol, amazing. Mouthfeel is incredibly smooth and oily. Somewhat sweet with a noticable amount coming from the malts. Not as much sherry in the mouth as in the nose. Taste is still nice and nutty, vanilla(y), and orange. A nice woody aftertaste was my personal favorite sensation of this beer. First sip is a bit of a palate shocker. I would recommend this to anyone who is familiar with or enjoys sherry. May throw some unsuspecting person off track. A wonderful experience that I would like to try again."
"D- This one would be great while reading a book, sitting in front of the fireplace. I would like to try all of the different Harvest Ale casks."
"Overall, I felt this was average or a bit above for me. I don't know what it is, but I am just not overwhelmed by the JW Lee's selections. Personal preference I guess, but this one just falls back with the others for me at least. Not bad if its your thing I guess."
"D = This is really one of the best dessert drinks I have ever tasted. An awesome beer that I would highly recommend."
"Pours a clouded orange/copper hue. The flavor profile on this was nice and sweet with a touch of spice, but there was just no complexity to things here really. It's just a straight-forward sweet tone that delivers no real character. Feel is smooth. It certainly is drinkable, but I remember the port cask version being a much more interesting beer than this. Nice to drink, but lacking some finesse."
"2005 vintage. Pours thich and viscous, a bit hazy, but a nice dried apricot color. Little head even with a hard pour and beyond an initial fizzing, it fades completely. I'm not too concerned given the style and abv. The sherry finish on this beer really lends quite a bit to the style. The sweet malt blends beautifully with the slightly nutty, vinous sherry. This isn't surprising considering that sherry casks have become all the rage for finishing Scotch- especially the slightly sweeter, maltier ones. It works. The sweet malt is up front in both the aroma and taste, followed by the nice sherry notes of almonds, light fruit, and salty caramel. Everything blends harmoniously and the finish and mouthfeel are smooth and rich without being unctuous. The vinous flavors really cut through the malt and make this very drinkable. There is no hint of the high abv. A stellar after dinner sipper."
"One-dimensional but still impressive."
"Overall, this is a drinkable beer. It has a complex taste and sweet demeanor. Kind of heavy, but drinkable nonetheless."
"The vintage I tried was 2003. The color was a bright orange/amber. The beer was poured into a large snifter and I lifted the btl. high above the glass to force a small one inch head. Some patchy lacing at the top of the glass. The nose was sweet dark fruits and a little barnyard mustiness. The taste started off with dark dried plums and raisins with a light sour taste that fades into a sweet honey/vanila finish. The mouthfeel is beyond silky it is down right syrupy! The drinkabilty: A slow sipping desert treat. The alcohol is very present thru-out the journey even with 5 years of aging. This one could be rested several more years."
"The body was a little on the thin side but it had an oily texture. Very drinkable beer in reasonable amounts. Don't see this beer aging much more than it already has though."
"Like all other J.W. Lee's Harevest Ales, this one is also a joy and privilage to drink. On a lazy Saturday night, reading some homebrew books and sipping on this English Barleywine -- It's a good night. The beer begins with the expected malty-sweet aroma with slight hints of hops, ripe (or over-rippened) fruits, and a light peppery / alcohol note in the nose. Aromas are quite similar to 1-year standard Harvest Ales. The flavors follow up on the heavy sweetness, but a tawny port wine-like woodyness, booziness, and mustiness soon follows. None of these sherry notes dominate the beer, but add just a hint of added variety. The hops are still young and over-bearing and will need some time to simmer, but the beer is still sublime. The feel is a weighted sweetness that, at times show syrupy textures, and at others a rich maltiness. The hops add a distracting bitterness, metalic, and bitey feel that will fall out over the next year or so. Overall, the beer is terrific but is still quite young and has some maturing to do."
"Overall: This is an excellent barley wine. The sherry cask aging does not contribute odd or ""gamey"" flavors as sometimes happens with cask-aged beers. Worthy of a place of honor in any collection."
"Overall really tastes more like a Scotch Ale than a EBW to me. Pure malt sweetness, and too strong/sweet for anything more than slow sipping."
"Finally, I have to factor in the price in the over all enjoyment. I doubt this beer will find a spot as a regular in the beer enjoyment line up. As an occasional treat-- perhaps."
"This beer pours a reddish-brown color. The head is very small, an recedes into nothing within seconds. The aroma is of caramel, choke cherries, dates, and brown sugar. The taste is of caramel and brown sugar with strong sour cherry notes in the finish. The mouthfeel is full bodied, velvety smooth, and carbonation is moderate. Overall, this is a nice beer, but I am not overly impressed with its flavor profile. However, it should probably be taken into account that I am not a huge sherry fan. I would drink this beer again, but I would much rather have the port aged version."
"Definitely a sipper, like its calvados-cask aged cousin. This one is, if you can believe, even more sweetly vanilla-y."
"drinkability: just fine"
"The beer pours an impressive, interesting color of cloudy amber brown, with a hint of orange. While there is not much head, what there is lasts and lasts, and the lacing is superb. The beer has a huge nose of honey, brown sugar, cocoa and melon. This beer smells incredibly rich and sweet, with almost a drambuie aroma. Just incredible. The beer tastes every bit as wonderful as it smells, and is very rich and sweet. I get flavors of vanilla, chocolate, melon and bacon fat. Incredibly decadent beer. The beer has a long, lingering finish, and on the palate it is very rich, plush and smooth. The abv. is noticeable, and this beer is definitely a sipper, but the beer is so flavorful, you hardly notice the acohol. The only thing that really detracts from the drinkability is the sweetness. After a while it started to get to me a bit. However, this is one outstanding beer from J.W. Lees."
"I like this beer alot but not for any long term drinking. Amount of RS in this will make it an easy hour and a half sipper. However it has good complexity and really let's you relax."
"Somewhat balanced, though in good English tradition, towards the malt; hops are backseat drivers. Alcohol is a big presence, but for a seven dollar bottle you expect it to go a long way. Fine brew."
"Pretty heavy bodied, didn't really notice any carbonation. Very syrupy as well, lingers in your mouth for a while. While this was very tasty and refreshing, the high alcohol makes this a very 'specific occassion' ale. Almost felt like a waste not being able to share it with others, but I thoroughly enjoyed each sip. Very impressive."
"2003 edition. Pours a brandy colored dark copper with a few small islands of thin head floating on the top. This one needs a snifter and presents well in my Maudite. Smells of super sweet malts, old wood, earthy musk, dark fruit, alcohol. Taste is exactly the same, super sweet just as an English barleywine should be, massive dark fruit, sweet candy, I'm gonna get diabetes from drinking this! Mouthfeel is thick and slick and it is easy to sip slowly on a cool evening. Wish I had a fire going."
"Poured in a snifter this beer boasts a dark red body with such a little tan head that quickly shrinks to nothing. The aroma is of big sticky malts. Huge sweet fruit notes little to no hops present at all. The taste has faint alocohol notes with a huge malt flavor that reminds me of a lifesaver. Pleasant sweet aftertaste with a large amount of residual sweetness and a slight alcohol warming sensation. This is a sipping beer that would pair wonderfully with a big blue cheese (stilton, anyone?)"
"Pours a four finger cream head that fades quickly to a thin layer leaving very little lace. Cloudy amber color. Light carbonation and very heavy bodied. Sweet sherry nose. Flavor is sweet sherry, cloying but easy to drink. Pricey - $6.99 for a 275ml bottle from John's Grocery Iowa City, Ia."
"2004. In the glass, an apple core tannic bite. With sharp vinous notes and a lot of aged raisins and pudding. Somewhat subdued over oak. Pours crystal clear with dispersed carbonation and a rim of creamy white. Flavor is dense, as is the texture. A lot of syrupy cream alights over gentle fusels and a bowl of dark fruits. Not entirely complex. The sugar is too dense and rich. There arent many nuanced notes here. Some plum and pear juices in a rice mixture. Seemingly more confused. After the cloying mixture a brief reprise of light vinous character, a bit of bittered oak resins and then a wash of old hops. This one seems unbalanced. The sugars too abundant, the malt character not forward enough, the barrel character somewhat unpleasent and the hops kind of rotty tasting. A real shame for the price. I appreciate some of the figgy nuts and almonds brought in by the barrel, but I dont think the beer reacted well. Mostly too sticky. Otherwise, clean."
"Pours an orange/reddish color, much lighter than expected. Hardly any head to speak of, but it does seem to have a very slight carbonation. Nose is a wonderfully sweet grain. Just a hint of the oak and sherry cask. Creamy, rich mouthfeel. Wow. Almost chewy. Flavors are more subtle than anticipated. Sweet maple with maybe a touch of vanilla. Pears. So smooth. Thick, full body. Alcohol is extremely well hidden. This was one of the more satisfying and enjoyable beers I have had in some time. Grab one to sip by the fire after a long days work and a hearty meal."
"2004 bottling poured into a snifter. Reddish brown with almost no head. sweet fruit, sherry scents. Flavors are similar lots of sweet caramel, very understated hop bitterness. Sweet flavor predominates. Silky mouthfeel. Alcohol is mostly present as a warming factor but extremely understated in the flavor. I had this beer for dessert tonight and it fills that role perfectly. A true sipping beer, one to savor for as long as possible. If you don't like sweet beers you won't like this one, but I do and this one is exceptional."
"A fireside sipper that should be savored on a winters night. A classic English BW."
"I liked this a lot and will add this to my harvest ales in the beer cellar. I can't wait to see how this improves over time."
"D: The ale weighs in at over 10%, making drinkability difficult. Add to that the sweetness of the malts and the intense alcohol of the sherry and this is a one and done beer."
"Overall: 2004 Sherry  as with the fresher versions of the Harvest Ale and the especially the Calvados, this is just a little too sweet for my own personal taste profile. Nice enough but just a little heavy on the syrupy sugary sweetness"
"Pours a dark amber, with a head that has no staying power. Aromas indicate sweetness -- candi sugar and spice, with a Macallan sherry bite. On the palate, sweet sherry flavors come out first, follwed by figs and sugared pears. Hot alcohol and a dirt/tobacco finish, but not one that's overdone. Mouthfeel is thick and smooth, except for the finish, which runs too hot to be called ""smooth"". Sticky. Overall, a bit too simple compared to the other JW Lees barley wines. The sherry seems to have robbed this beer of some of its complexity. Still, it's a very decent beer."
"This is a great sipping english barley wine, but it very sweet and full of potent rich flavors that may be too much after a glass."
" Tastes of oaked sherry, and vanilla flavored caramel covered biscuits covered with toffee and tobacco. Mouthfeel is thick, viscous, and chewy. Drinkability is as I expect from any JW Lees Harvest Ale."
"The Sherry dominates the aroma but you can smell lots of caramel beneath it. Red tinged amber in color this beer appears vaguely luminescent. There is just a slight filmy white slick of a head in the middle of the glass, but the outer edges are a uniform dime sized thickness. Fore is very sweet with caramel, sugar and cream. There are subtle woody notes in the middle and the finish is again very sweet with rich caramel and candy sugar notes. Im starting to dig English barley Wines."
"Oh, yeah. I forgot to mention . . . beer isn't sherry."
"Okay drinkabilty for the strength, but a few more years of aging are in order IMHO"
"Light rust with pink accents and a small and mostly lasting head of foam. Strangely lighter in color compared to the brown colored original JW Lees Harvest Ale. Deeply malty aroma showing hints of caramel, toffee and toasted bread along with infused sherry barrel aromas (Sherry, vanilla, wood) and a suspicion of honey and strawberries. Rich, full, nutty and caramel laden fruit flavors coat the palate, while the barrel certainly did mellow this out quite a bit providing notes of sherry, vanilla and wood. This really is very elegant and complex and the flavors are so ever changing."
"Mothfeel- A little too tart for my liking, the finish at least. But the gradual build up to the sherry like finish was pretty cool. Very syrupy mouthfeel."
"Drinkability: Man this is fantastic! What a treat. Worth seeking out and enjoying. One of the most enjoyably complex beers I've ever had."
"D - For as nice as this beer is as an after-dinner cordial, the sherry casks add little to the flavor other than huge sweetness as opposed to the Lagavulin casks which added some interesting peat and smoke notes. I am beginning to realize that the JW Lees line of Harvest Ales should be purchased, forgotten about for many years, and then opened up once they're reached a more satisfying level of complexity."
"Overwhelming. Palate overload. Good God, what is this? Is this a barleywine or a bad sherry or a dessert port? Definitely a dessert beer. This is an instance of something that was good product and having what seems like is a great idea, but it backfires. Poured brown with a slight red tinge it to. Slight bubbly head on top. Nose is like a glass of sherry or port wine. Flavor is all the wine with a slight hop kick towards the end. The bittersweetness also provides a slight curl to the taste. Very heavy in the mouth and oily--almost greasy. Definitely a slow sipping dessert beer. Aging in a sherry barrel destroys this as a decent barleywine."
"Pours from the funky old wooden cask, dark and muddy, no head nor lace, seems to have very minimal carbonation. Nose is funky, musty, fruity, wine like. Notes here of figs and raisins, bold and deep, flavorful and complex. World class after dinner or desert sipper. Wine sherry notes present here but team players. Whenever you see a wooden cask on the bar or fest table, get on line and get you sample or two."
"On the handpull at downtown Indy's BW3. Appearance is a nice deep mahogany with a little bit of foam at first that disappears pretty quickly. Smell is...sweet! A few different types of sweetness combine to create a pretty sickeningly sweet smell. Of course the usual JW Lees toffee and caramel smell is very strong in there, and there is a little bit of malty sweetness, but there is also a strong maple syrup type smell and the sherry cask they aged this in must have been an extremely sweet sherry because it has a very strong influence on this beer. There is also a powerful spiced rum smell in there. The smell is very much in your face and powerful, but not appetizing at all to me. Taste is cloyingly sweet, as expected. There is some definitely depth and complexity here, and I'm sure this is probably what the brewers intended to achieve with this combination, but I can hardly stomach it right now. This is more rich and sweet than almost any dessert I've ever tried. Hardly any balancing bitterness in this one. Mouthfeel is nice and full and slippery without any carbonation. Drinkability is not great. I finished my 10oz goblet and decided that I could potentially enjoy it with dessert, but I definitely won't be ordering one again."
"D- This is a very nice barley wine and the slight sherry notes really add a lot of depth to this beer but it didn't taste overly sweet."
"275 ml bottle. This beer pours out a murky brown color with a small head. Sweet caramel aroma with dark fruits and a little bit of sourness. Hugely malty sweet flavor. Lots of dark fruits. Some hop flavor comes through. A little off-tasting sourness. Sweetness becomes cloying. Mouthfeel is full. Low carbonation. There's no hiding the 11.5% abv. This beer is pretty good, but in no way is it in improvement on the original J.W. Lees. The sour aspect is annoying. Make sure to let this one warm up quite a bit. It tastes best near room temp."
"9.3 ounce bottle. $7.75 at Wine Warehouse in Charlottesville, VA. A great beer, worth every penny!"
"On cask at the BW3 in Indy. This beer pours a radioactive red color with a slight showing of a head atop the glass. There is a bit of lacing as well. Aroma was sweet and nutty at first. Then I notice vanilla and a woody component enter. Sherry shows itself along with cherries and finally a little alcohol kick. Really complex aroma. I picked up something new each time I whiffed. Taste is just as complex. I was continually picking up new flavors. There's a main dried fruit aspect to this beer that holds the sherry in and lets it be more noticeable. Apricots and cherry are there. More toasted caramel along with a roasted cashew taste. Alcohol and sherry flavor become more dominant in the finish but neither overbearing. The rich body supports these flavors well. Overall, this is a very enjoyable sipper. Maybe one of the few perfect after dinner drinks imo."
"This specially casked Harvest ale pours a deep auburn body with amber and gold highlights beneath an average sized head of creamy off-white froth. The head retention is limited, but at 11.5% that's to be expected - and it still keeps a decent collar which is unusual for such a high alcohol beer! The nose is loaded with sweet, delicately caramelized malt and notes of sticky-sweet dried dark fruit as well as some leafy and almost herbal hops. There's no particular evidence of either sherry or wood, but it is somehow lighter or less malty than the regular version. In the mouth it's full bodied almost to the point of being syrupy; smooth; and quite creamy. It's rich maltiness dominates the flavor with a sticky, honey-like character that's balanced by herbal, leafy and grassy hops. The sherry comes through midway across the palate with a spritz of fruit-juice and alcohol. The bitterness is low-key, but has enough ballast enough to balance it. The sherry comes through again in the finish, lending it just a little more complexity than the original; but of the four specially ""casked"" versions, this is one of the less interesting (with port being the other - the clavados and Lagavulin were actually interesting)."
"Thanks to Clvand0 for sharing. This beer pours vibrant golden color with a finger of head that falls to a light coat over the brew. Its a very pretty color. The nose is rum-raisin and some vinous grapeyness. Smells nice. The flavor is full. The raisin is more sweet and less like dried fruit. There is also a thick molasses sweetness. The flavors are well rounded and blended well. I enjoy it. No real hint of the alchohol. The feel is incredibly thick, even syrupy. Very oating. Drinkability is okay as well. Smooth and tasty. Its a sipper. Good beer."
"Pours a clear amber color with a small head that falls fast and leaves a little lacing on the glass. The aroma is mostly comprised of a raisin essence, but I don't get much else. The flavor is very smooth. Some slight raisin notes and a little sweetness. The finish is really drying. I don't get much of the sherry flavor in this one. Very tasty, but it doesn't live up to what I wanted it to be. The 1997 vintage is still the best of these that I've had. The body is moderate and the drinkability is just ok."
"Sweet caramel malt, loads of fruit, & lemon rind. Light touch of earthy hops, sweet finish. Medium bodied, very gentle carbonation."
"After trying the other 3 cask aged versions I figured this one could use a little time to sit. I guess that might not have been the case. Fairly clear orange with a light tan head that quickly bubbles down leaving no lacing. Very strong syrupy sweet aromas. Some vinous and buttery notes were there but overpowered for the most part by the sweetness. Taste upon first sip was way too sweet. Light fruitiness and more syrupy sweet flavors follow. Light buttery notes before the sweet finish. Cloying but still drinkable. Mouthfeel is pretty thick and sticky sweet. Drinkability not good at all. It was hard enough drinking this bottle let alone ever wanting another one. Oh well maybe this might have been better earlier."
"Drinkability? Don't go crazy with this one. As with many of the classic big ales, this one is best savored in moderation."
"The mix of nuttiness from the Sherry and vanilla notes is really quite nice. This beer is a nice dessert beer, and even reminds me of a liquor with its alcohol notes in the finish. This beer has some serious malt notes as well, it tastes of toasted malt, caramel, and toffee. This beer, as one would expect is rich and filling, it is quite thick and almost coats my mouth. I really like the extra dimension that the sherry adds to this beer."
"Golden amber liquid wears no head. Oxidized wine aroma where floral undertones come hidden under strong alcoholic suggestions and milder bread ones. Light liquorice and wood hints. Taste contains a mild grape tartness that is overshadowed by a strong dry wood character, sometimes reminiscent of paper. Bitter alcohol finish imparts an appealing though rough cigar-like aftertaste. Mouthfeel is creamy, full bodied."
"Clear and dark golden wit not much head, only a dusting with some swirling, itsy bitsy bubbles in a thin ring at the edge. Wonderful scents of whiskey going on, or maybe rum? Makes me think of drinking a rum and coke. Bit of some dark fruits and maple syrup or dark karo syrup, very nice. Wow! This is so thick and creamy, but not heavy, just smooth and lovely! There is a bit of bite from the carbination. I am surprised by the caramelly sweetness that the sherry brings. Tastes of a cream sherry and oakyness. Blackened toast in the aftertaste. After each taste there is a bit of both the dark and the sweet, -NICE! There is so much wonderful flavor in this. Man, I was scared that this would not live up to what I was hoping it would taste like. I love the taste of cream sherry -yeah, so sue me, it is fun chilled with a wedge of lime every once in a while! Pull out the Harveys! Glad that this turned out to be as good as I wanted it to be. Maybe not a session beer, but a wonderful sit down and relax and sipper. Enjoyed this one alot. -Especially after the crappy birds game today, this really took the edge off!"
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"I may like this one the best of the four barrel-aged Harvest Ales. Its the same gorgeous amber glow with the wispy, white head. The aroma is caramel and alcohol and a bit of oak. The flavor is sugary sweet, just like the rest of them, with a touch of slightly overripe peach supporting it. I can actually taste a bit of the wood from the barrel and a slight wine-like character from the sherry. This flavoring from the barrel is subtle, but not as subtle as the rest. A fine barleywine, but the sweetness, like in the rest, makes it a definite slow sipper."
"I had to gag this down to finish."
"2003 sherry. This is the second one I tried after the calvados. The look and rich thickness were identical. The taste was much different. The alcohol was not as powerful and there was a pleasant dried plum sweetness that makes you forget what you are drinking. The sweetness lingers in a way that can be over the top but it is a very good mind numbing drink. Also 6.99 in NJ."
"Poured into a Rapscallion snifter, formed a 1/8"" head over the clear copper brew, with slight lacing. Slightly sweet malt aroma initially, quickly overpowered by alcohol notes, with some fruity components as well. Taste is of sweet malts, followed by the alcohol warmth, and a tad of fruitiness at the end, I assume from the sherry cask, but hardly noticeable. Mouthfeel and drinkability are good for the style. Not much different than how I would present a rating for regular harvest, not much effect from the sherry cask, in my book."
"I think it gets hurt on drinkablilty though... this is a rare treat, but I couldn't see it as an everyday drinker."
"They managed to make this ale delicate in its flavors rather than just slapping you in the face with barrel taste. It was rather buttery as a side note, but not like a california chard."
"Scorched pecans, hazelnuts and walnuts on the nose fold into concentrated butter, maple and pound cake aromas. On the palate it is sweet and fabulously rich in a viscous, oily-textured way that is not quite accounted for by its evident residual sugar, nor any flavor of alcohol. On the finish it is supported by seed oil-flavored bitterness reminiscent of arsenic-laden apricot and peach pits."
"Overall a stupendous beer. I have 2 of each of these fellows and look forward to trying each of the others to compare. Really the only ""gripe"" (and I hesitate to call it a gripe), I have with this beer is that nuttiness that I was not expecting."
"Backwash: When VENOM first posted these upcoming arrivals, I hustled to the local store that carries a good range of B. Uniteds products. It took some wheedling, but they eventually got it in. Now that Ive opened one (I bought 2 of each variety), Ill have to find more. Id love to find a place that offered this on draught, from the wooden casks."
