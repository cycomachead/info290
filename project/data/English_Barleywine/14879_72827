I poured it a bit warmer – around 50 degrees, and the heat from the alcohol was definitely on the nose, along with some boozy liquor, sweet bread and whiskey. Taste was a lot like the smell, but with even more added complexity. Almost reminiscent of a scotch ale – a little Backwoods Bastard in there somewhere. Sweet, sugary malts, bourbon as well as some vanilla, oak and coconut on the back end. Some burn of alcohol is present, but in the most decadent way possible. This one was a delicious sipper. I'd easily pay $20/bomber on another one of these any day, and that doesn't happen too often.","Lukass","Dec 12, 2014"

Unique aroma with plenty of whiskey, oak, fig, dark fruits, brown sugar as expected, but with some spice and another note that almost seems quad like. I assume the year is the ""Belgian"" influence? Flavor is sweet brown candi sugar, dark fruit, leather, caramel, some oak and dryness, coconut and vanilla finish. Thick body with medium low carbonation, coating the tongue. Definitely different from the standard BA Barleywine, but very nice.","BMMillsy","Nov 07, 2014"

4.52,6.1,4,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"22 ounce bottle into snifter; batch 1, bottled in 8/2011. Pours lightly cloudy ruby red color with a small fairly dense light khaki head with decent retention, that reduces to a thin lace cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big caramel, brown sugar, raisin, prune, pear, apple, molasses, toast, vanilla, toffee, oak, clove, whiskey, herbal, light pepper, light coconut, and oak/yeast earthiness. Incredible aromas with awesome complexity and balance of dark malt, whiskey barrel, and moderate yeast ester notes; with great strength. Taste of big caramel, brown sugar, raisin, prune, pear, apple, molasses, toast, toffee, vanilla, oak, clove, whiskey, herbal, light coconut, and oak/yeast earthiness. Zero bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, brown sugar, molasses, raisin, prune, pear, apple, toast, brown bread, toffee, vanilla, oak, clove, whiskey, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity of dark malt, yeast ester, and whiskey barrel flavors; with a fantastic malt/yeast/barrel balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very creamy, slick, and lightly syrupy mouthfeel that is fantastic. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an insane barrel aged barleywine! All around incredible complexity and balance of dark malt, yeast ester, and whiskey barrel flavors; and extremely smooth to sip on for the big ABV. An extremely amazing offering.","superspak","0"

Deep rich aroma of oak, vanilla, booze, dark fruit, and toffee. Opens with a burst of plum, black cherry, fig, and rich accents of date, joined by vanilla and caramel. Finishes with toffee, booziness, and just a hint of whiskey. Full bodied with a syrupy mouthfeel that coats the inside of the mouth and low to moderate carbonation. Overall, this beer certainly trends on the sweet side, but it never reaches the point of being cloying. I’ve had better “rare” barleywines in the past, but this was a very solid offering.

Very fine narrow lacing around the top of the glass. Caramel and malty aroma. Buttery and a mild oak tinge. Deep raisen like flavors. Caramel and treacle abound. long lingering sticky sweetness. Just enough of the barrel to let you know it is there. Very mild sherry notes. Great toffee like, sticky mouthfeel-ongoing sweetness...Not trace of the alcohol in this one at all. Just a great beer all in. One of the best UK barleywines I have had. I got this in an Xmas trade that was 80% barrel aged stuff so have held off until now. A real treat for sure.

Poured into a glass from the bottle, the ale was a golden color with a slight white head that left lacing along the sides of the glass. The beer had a pleasant boozy, malty aroma with hints of vanilla hidden in the aroma. In the initial taste, one gets a nutty, fruity, citrus sensation with hints of vanilla and dark fruit and vanilla in the background. There is a virtual explosion of taste here because there is so much going on. While one gets the warming sensation from the alcohol, it is well masked. The warming continues into the aftertaste with nutty and fruity sensations continuing. By far, this was the winner at a recent testing and my personal favorite from Hoppin' Frog.","JohnnyHopps","Mar 26, 2013"

The barrel presence is much stronger than the nose suggests with subtle toasted oak, vanilla, coconut and spicy whiskey booziness. For all of the alcohol flavor up front, it's actually not all that hot with lots of sweetness and a complex malt backbone balancing things out. It could actually use some more whiskey flavor and heat to counter all of the sweetness. Slightly leathery but the caramel malt, toffee and vinous dark fruit notes overpower almost everything that would suggest barleywine. Slight bubblegum character with hints of grape, raisin, date and plum. Pretty tasty with a well masked ABV but it's intensely sweet and lacking in balance. Also could use more of a spirit/barrel presence for my liking.","corby112","Mar 10, 2013"

The barleywine style that they claim in their descriptor can be difficult to find sometimes, especially if the drinker is more accustomed to the more common ""American Barleywine"" style. However, as a traditional or ""English barleywine," this beer is a marvelous blending of styles. It incorporates all the malty, caramel-laden, fruity, boozy, silky goodness that we've come to know and love and combines it with even more dark fruits, active carbonation, and spice from the Belgian style. On top of that it throws in whiskey and oak! What else could you want?! The correct answer? Some in your glass and then some in your stomach. Top marks to Hoppin' Frog! What a beautiful bruiser!","SudSavant","Feb 11, 2013"

A finger and a half or so of white foam rises atop the beer before fading pretty quickly. Lacing is a bit on the scant side. I want to score the appearance lower, but the color is just too nice. The nose is wonderful, with aromas of brown sugar, figs, and plums all swimming together with a hint of whiskey. The flavor leads off with a malt profile that's definitely more brown sugar than caramel. The middle portion features some very nice esters from the Belgian and English yeast strains. Lots of fig, and a bit of plum to give it more of a dark fruit edge. The finish features some subtle oak and a bit of straight up whiskey (though it's not hot at all). The mouthfeel starts out fine, with a slightly heavy body and just a bit of carbonation. The carbonation seems to drop off soon after the beer's poured though, and the second half of each glass is just too syrupy (the mouthfeel score is a compromise between how each glass starts and finishes). Sure there are a couple minor technical flaws, but BANE excels where it counts (taste). I'd be lucky to come across another bottle of this brew.","axeman9182","Dec 01, 2012"

A nice sheet of lacing on the way down. The smell is bold and the barrel aging while big, does not distract from the other scents. There is the base beer with all those malts and things, plus some whiskey/bourbon scent along with a plethora of fruits. This is a fruity big ass barleywine. A candi scent from the Belgian yeast. A big basket of fruits. Plums, pears, apricots, and others mashed in as well. English and Belgian yeast varieties. Malts with some bread. Bourbon is on the light end but I can still taste it distinctly. There is some alcohol in this 11 percenter. A very smooth ride with some slight heat in the finish. I gotta say this does have a fruity aftertaste, unlike any barleywine that i've had. Could it be the barrel's, could it be this batch, could it be me, I don't know. It's sweet, but not a cloying mess. above medium in feel and a good amount of carb going for it. I myself would go for a 12ozer if they made it available..

4.29,0.7,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Been looking forward to this one. Cracked it because the Bears were losing to the Packers. Appearance is a deep amber, almost red. No head to speak of. Smells wonderful, banana peal, cognac, port wine, sweet malt. The taste is outstanding for the style. I'm not a huge BW fan but this is great. The wood notes are there but subtle. I do get a small amount of banana and vanilla. Reminds me of bananas foster, honestly, the flavors of brandy, banana, and caramel are all there to me. It's slightly boozy but the sweetness compliments it well. Mouthfeel is heavy but it is drinkable. I didn't think I'd be able to finish the bottle solo after my first couple swigs but I'm down to the last 3-4 ounces and it's still drinking fine. My favorite barley wine to date.","robboyd","Sep 11, 2012"

My mou is blasted with hot alcohol, way too much sugar, and some bourbon, vanilla and toffee. If King Henry represents the ultimate in big, yet smooth, refined and complex BA barleywines, I put this at the opposite end of the spectrum. Just a slap over the head with a bourbon-soaked plank of sugar cane. I also get a note of Dimetapp (or is it robitussIn?). Body is nice for the style - fairly thick and decent carbonation. Overall, I am disappointed by is beer. Super expensive for the quality. Not recommended for those who demand a lot from an expensive BA barleywine.","waltonc","Sep 07, 2012"

It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. I really went into this one blind not knowing what to expect, but what I found was quite pleasant. The sweetness on this one was really nice and made this brew stand out from some of the others from this style I’ve had. It did this all while not destroying a delicate balance of flavors and aromas.

The flavors are more complex. There is plenty of caramel, toffee, vanilla, light oak, cherries, maple syrup, and it finishes with a slight whiskey burn. It loses complexity the further you get through your glass. The cherry really comes out more and more as you drink and gets sweeter and sweeter. It drinks full bodied and syrupy for the style.

Off the bat I am hit in the face with a punch of whiskey, eventually it opens up into a delicious sweet malt base with strong scents of nougat and vanilla/coconut. Upon pouring this into my mouth I see where this goes from a B+ barleywine to being off the charts. Flavors such as vanilla, coconut, wood, nougat, caramel, booze, and sweet cream all meld into one heavenly elixir that graces my palate. Left with a lingering green apple/fresh fruit flavor (maybe the Belgian side of this?) The mouthfeel is nice and coating, not too thick, not too sweet or dense. A good amount of carbonation for the style. Please make more of this Hoppin Frog! This beats Boris Royale in their whiskey barrel aged experiments. I have found a new admiration for this brewery.","GrindFatherBob","Jan 21, 2012"

It definitely is a ""Belgian"" barleywine, as the saccharine flavors almost turn this into a pina colada type flavor. The ripe dark fruit, chocolate, belgian yeast, and whiskey flavors are all touched on correctly, but it has a sweet, cloying quality that is ever so slightly off-putting. Excellently crafted, but not one I would reach for again and again. Would love to see what HF could do with a barrel aged, non-Belgian barleywine.","siege06nd","Jan 12, 2012"

Settling down smoothly and evenly it produced a thick coating of lace all along the sides of the glass. Rich vanilla and woody aromas are being picked up almost immediately. Huge notes of oak and subtle caramel and toffee and truly dominating here for sure. Warming only brings this out further, rich and decadent, sweet aromas just building off each other here. The first sip is divine, subtle, and rich and perfectly carbonated it simply rolls across the tongue with a gentleness that is unheard of. Vanilla and caramel merging with oak like notes and touches of earthy hops all working together seamlessly. I am still not sure how strong this one is, but subtleness is key here as it was barely detectable at all.","mikesgroove","Dec 08, 2011"

The nose is redolent of luscious coconut liquor, pineapple upside-down cake, delectable toffee notes, vibrant oaken vanilla, and buttery richness. As far as the flavor goes, I can add no more to the descriptors, other than to say that it is stunningly delicious, and that there is a modicum of well-placed anise nuance that is not detected aromatically, as well as a trace suggestion of dried golden fruits likely imparted by the yeast.

It pours a clear copper-tawn topped by a finger of light tan foam. The nose comprises maple syrup, light oak, sweet toffee, light mandarin orange syrup, and the slightest hint of whiskey. The taste continues the sweet tradition of the smell, with the toffee really running deep and the heat of the alcohol finally showing through. It's clear this barleywine is still quite young. The body is a stolid medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a syrupy feel. Overall, though young, this is quite the tasty b-wine. I'm sure age will be a boon to it, but it's ready to go now for the adventurous. Good times.","TMoney2591","0"
