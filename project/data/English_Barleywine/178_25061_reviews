"Serving type: bottle."

"D: This was quite the barrel aged beer, with obvious Lagavulin character in the scent and taste, nicely balanced by the sweetness of the barleywine. The finish was a little rough, so it must be sipped. Age would probably only help. This was a great brew."
"O - This beer is an excellent one to have as dessert or a nightcap.  It certainly has its place and is not going to be for everyone.  I personally am a huge fan of Islay scotches so I find the beer quite good.  It is well-balanced, easy to sip, and takes on just enough of the barrel characteristic to make it a beer that I will keep in my repertoire of occasional elite treats."
"Very dry and unpleasant - second bad experience after trying the sherry cask version. Bottles were both a few years old - possibly past their best - both ended their lives down the sink."

"O: this was one of the most fantastic ales in memory when I first had it in Oct 2012 - had it on tap then at the bar in which I worked... the product from this bottle, for whatever of a variety of possible reasons, is showing signs of falling apart - the fresh intensity of its original flavors dying off or in transition... still, for fans of the Harvest Ale and Islay whiskey, this is a dream of a brew"

"Final verdict: novel idea that doesn't work well in this older vintage. The company website says that some bottles have gone for $60, but I'm not seeing it at this point. May have to try some of the other vintages and varieties to get a better representation of Harvest Ale."

"MF –A smooth medium-bodied ale with a semi-dry finish. Warming in the belly. Low carbonation. 4.75"
"O- remarkably drinkable for its age, the slight hint of green apple and lack of smokiness make this beer slightly less enjoyable than expected but it has held up and still has a bouquet of aromas and flavors"

"2012 Bottle from a trip to Hoboken. Shared with beastmaster. Pours orange, mostly clear, with pretty much no head. Aroma is big peaty scotch smells, a bit of the signature nutty JW Lees in the backdrop. But really big smokey peat. Flavor is massive smokey peat, leather, tobacco, very light dry nuts, more peat, a hint of sweet caramel to balance. Whoah. This is like scotch, but without any of the booze burn. Very mellow. Medium plus mouthfeel with more carbonation than I got from the other BA versions of this. This might be my favorite variant, and it is bordering on incredible."

"Not for the faint of heart. Kind of a smoked English Barley-wine. Very unique and worth trying, just be aware and ready for it."

"Overall, pretty good, but the Lagavulin is overpowering and the beer is too sweet. Not the best treatment of the Harvest Ale."
""
""
"Maybe I'm not that into English Barleywines but King Henry is one of my favorite beers, probably not a true English BW. Anyways this beer had a real boozie sweet smell to it and tasted the same. Heavy smokiness, cinnamon, funky spices, caramel, kind of an unpleasant tart taste to it. Overall It tasted like a funky, sweet, syrupy mess. Maybe fresh it tastes a lot better."
""
"O: Was not very impressed - I think the sediment and the thick syrupy texture ruined it for me."

"Poured into a mini-snifter, the beer was a copper color with a modest slight white head. At the front, the aroma was a mild whiskey aroma. While the aroma was enjoyable, it would not make be want to buy the beer again by itself. In the initial taste, one gets sweet malts, nuttiness, amaretto, and a mild sourness. Even with an 11.5%ABV, this beer's alcohol does not leave an abrasive alcohol burn. The thick mouthfeel becomes more apparent in the aftertaste as the aftertaste lingers. I might define the aftertaste as a syrupy sweet alcohol that is masked well enough to be like a girly drink. This is an outstanding barrel aged barleywine."
"Pours a hazy amber color with tons of sediment. The aroma is nice; hints of vanilla, caramel, oak, and toffee are abound. The taste follows well with a sweet blend of all the aforementioned notes, plus a slight whisky burn and an indescribably smooth finish. The lack of burn really masks the alcohol content (11.5%); this one really has the potential to sneak up and dropkick a lot of people. All in all, a very, very good brew."
""
""

"O: had to downgrade some scores, as this did not age as well as I'd hoped - losing the Lagavulin peat and smoke did not improve the taste of the beer, which I found to be far too sugary for my liking, and the appearance of so much sediment was due in part to my pour, but still detracted from the drinking experience I was hoping for."
""
""
""
"Overall: I knew nothing about this beer prior to this tasting, and the smoky, scotch flavors were a surprise -- but a good surprise. The smoke is quite dominant. I enjoyed this beer and think it would best stand alone rather than pairing with any food, although it would be interesting to try it with BBQed pork. I will look for it again."
"Taste is very sweet, a bit spicy, smoky, with dry toast and bread finish, then a whiskyish bitter-spicy aftertaste. It's engaging."

"275 ml bottle into tulip glass, 2005 vintage. Pours very hazy and cloudy reddish copper color with no head and some minimal lacing bubbles sticking to the side. Aromas of big caramel, raisin, prune, fig, toast, toffee, molasses, oak, whiskey, vanilla, peat, light smoke, and dark earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt notes with barrel character. Taste of big caramel, molasses, toffee, toast, raisin, fig, prune, vanilla, oak, whiskey, peat, light smoke, and dark earthiness. Lingering notes of caramel, molasses, toffee, toast, dark fruits, vanilla, oak, whiskey, light smoke, and earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice balance and complexity of malt notes with dark fruits; with a fair amount of barrel character that isn’t overwhelming; and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Minimal carbonation and full bodied; with a creamy, slick, and fairly syrupy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice English barleywine. All around nice balance and complexity of malt and barrel flavors; and very smooth to sip on slowly. A very enjoyable offering."

"O: The Harvest Ale always tends to be fairly sweet but this is a bit much. One of sweetest beers I've had and kind of hard to finish without someone to help. A cigar would be fine compliment to this beer though."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I'm not really digging this. It's strong but not necessarily offensive on the nose, and nearing harsh in the taste, and not just because of the alcohol content. Quite a different take on english barleywines for sure but just not for me."
"D- if I could make three wishes for this beer, they would be more peat, more seaweed, more ""fresh"" smoke. The oceanic pungency that I love about Islay scotch is all but lost in the malt sweetness. The scotches themselves are plenty sweet, but still retain a balance. This one sadly does not. This is a great beer and very monsterous and a must try for anyone that loves this type of scotch, but be aware that the taste is of smoked wood, not smoked barley. Like you over-smoked your BBQ by adding too much oak. I'm glad I found this bottle but I don't think I'll ever buy another one."
""
""
"[O] Normally I find that I rate the aroma and flavor in most beers about the same. For some reason, the nose on this one didn't do it for me - but the flavor sure did. Very nice beer...better than the BA average in my opinion."
"Overall - Enjoyable variation. Better than some of the others. I don't always love a scotch barrel on a beer, but the intensity of the whiskey flavor tends to subdue the sweetness of the base beer."

"overall - great, but I think I prefer the regular version."

"2005 vintage. this is another one of those special beers that in each category cant be scored anything too high, but taken on the whole, are quite amazing. this is one of those for sure. it pours clear whiskey color, with almost no head. there are some dark brown yeast floaters at the bottom, and gentle carbonation. it smells like a barleywine, caramely, english malty, and very very sweet. there is also a mature woody aroma, and a great deal of alcohol. it taste very organic, very old, and very sweet. there is a ton of residual sugar here, and an already sweeter malt profile. no hops at all to speak of, and a punishing alcohol sting. the whiskey barrel adds a touch of charcoal and vanilla flavor, and a smoothness of feel. this thing is velvet, even with the abv what it is. carbonation is really mild, so the sugars sort of stay in the mouth awhile. it is about what i expected when i got this, huge and sweet. its got a richness and a certain refined character that set it apart. worth a try if youve got the bucks."
""
""
"O: Even if I was a fan of Scotch, this would still be a crappy barleywine. Crap appearance, crap body, oxidized, just not good."
"Overall: As a lover of big, sweet English barleywines and of Islay Scotch, things don't get much better than this. I would happily drink one of these everyday for the rest of my life! I will most certainly be attempting to trade for a case in the near future!"
""
""
"I had a very hard time grading this one, the flavors where not necessarily unpleasant, but definitely unexpected and a bit over the top with the scotch. Definitely would not want more than the few ounces I had, and I could see how even that would be a bit much for some people."
"A murky, iced tea brown, with little to no cap or lacing. Just the thinnest of collars around the edge. Big peat, smokey aroma on top of old leather, butterscotch, cocoa powder, toffee, raisins, and oak. Just loads of complexity. The flavor profile follows the nose. Peat and smoke throughout, with tobacco, raisins, toffee, cocoa powder, leather, and raisins. A good shot of fusel alcohol leads to some good warming. The feel is a bit syrupy, full-bodied, with low carbonation. This beer is amazingly complex, albeit dominated by the peat, smokey aroma and flavors. If you're not a fan of peat whiskey, move along."
""
"O: Wow, like drinking an ashtray filled with burnt bandaids. I poured it out after drinking two sips. This beer was so bad that it actually gave me a headache somehow. You MUST love scotch to even attempt this beer."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Probably one of my favorite BA beers. The whisky is wonderfully incorporated and sweetness is spot hot. I haven't had one with this much age and its transcendent. Love. Love. Love"
""
""
"D - Very drinkable. The whisky blends really nicely with the rich bold barleywine base. Nicely complex."
"O: Considering its strength, the alcohol is relatively well hidden from the taste. The interesting smell and taste also make it a nice beer to sip."
"O: Very little alcohol in the smell/taste/mouthfeel which is surprising considering the high ABV."
""

"Had on tap at Max's in Baltimore. Not a big whisky drinker at all, so not sure of the ""Lagavulin"" taste, but this was a damn tasty beer that's for a sipper for sure. Full flavored and full bodied, with a nice woodsy kick to it, would be a great nightcap and is a delicious barleywine. Would be interesting to compare this at the same time with the other whisky casks... although quite dangerous."
"O. This is a great beer. Will need to find it again. At 11.5% ABV, there is a definite warming effect that I enjoyed."
""
""
"Overall, I loved this! I'm a scotch lover and Lagavulin is one of my favorites. If you like scotch, there's a good chance you'll like this beer. The many complimentary tastes work wonderfully in concert and make this a very pleasurable drink."
""
"Serious amount of sediment, like where’s the cheesecloth? Otherwise, bright and clear amber orange coloration with a reddish cast, close to total absence of any head or lacing, even a vigorous swirl gets you nothing, no bubbles visible, looks dead in terms of carbonation. The nose is highly aggressive and gets right in there, beef jerky, leather, pork rinds, candied orange peels, vanilla pudding, very heady and boozy, poached apricots and peaches, honey and licorice, deserves to be allowed to come close to room temperature to truly strut its stuff. Medium-bodied, while heavy in some respects not leaden and certainly moves agilely while it stays aligned with its overall goals. The gamey, leathery qualities persist, it’s like having a smokehouse in your mouth, is this liquid pork? The dried fruit quality peach, apricot, nectarine, apple fruit thick and viscous start to finish. Here the caramel, vanilla, butterscotch, cola bean oak dominant, particularly as it warms. This is a beer meant to be slowly sipped in front of a roaring fire with a cigar in hand. Smoky with its own tobacco and ash qualities. Has to be taken at face value, there’s no great beers, just great bottles of beers. Psyche. (2007 Release)"
"Overall this is really great. Certainly a sipper. The biggest downfall here is a that gritty bitterness that sits on the back of the palate on the finish. The sweetness is certainly the key player here. Worth checking out if you're feeling bold."
"O - Real glad to have had this. The charred oak in the barrel is great. This would go great with a steak. I can't get over how smooth this is. This is whiskey as beer, literally. I think it should be had on cask to see the real transition without the carbonation. Thank you PBW!!"
"This was my first time in the cask series of JW Lee's. While I prefer the original over the Lagavulin, make no mistake that this is delicious beer."
"I wont pick up this beer again and leave the bottle fairly disappointed in how unbalanced the beer and whisky qualities are displayed in the brew."
""
""
"Easy decision = Drain Pour"
"I love Lagavulin and this delivers great flavors from that whiskey. The JW Lees sweetness still carries in but the whiskey use here just rocks."
""
""
"O: A great thick little sipper. Very syrupy and smooth. Alcohol warmth is very mellow. Peat flavors are unique but easy to get used to. Pretty good all around."
"Overall: Good beer with nice complexity, but the bottom line is...its too sweet for me(never thought I could say this about an english barleywine). I really enjoy this beer style alot, but its just a little over the top sweet."
""
""
""
"O: skip this, it's bad on cask at least. It would be fine if I had it with pancakes in the morning alongside an FBS since it tastes like bacon and apples. At $10 for a pour, forget this garbage."
"Poured a copperish body with minimal head on top of a strong whiskey/oak aroma, with a think yeast aroma as well (and touches of honey and sugary sweetness (and black cherry?)). The yeast sediment sticks to the bottom and slowly dissolves every time I take a sip...thick, sticky, has a boozy but not medicinal taste - the sweet malts are great and this is a very sweet and sturdy beer (a great after lunch sipper). Slightly warming as I sip - real nice finish. No dry or bitterness as hops barely noticeable, but a real good sweet and malty beer to relax with."
"This beer really grew on me as it warmed & I moved through it. The unusual whiskey is really nice, the complexities lovely. Really good beer that's licking the boot of excellent; looking forward to the other varietals."
""
"Tastes like big sweet malt up front, sticky toffee pudding and fresh cherries, and then the whisky barrel comes in and builds gradually. The barrel treatment certainly comes through more on the palate than on the nose, mature Scotch with industrial smoke and salty ocean air, nicely restrained and a great complement to the sweet fruity malt. Long, long finish, with the smoke building, becoming almost completely dry with only peat smoke and roasted nuts lingering at the very end, amazing after such a sweet attack. Very tasty stuff, with great balance and complexity."
"This bottle was a Vintage 2013"
""
""
"O. This is a very good barelywine to me. I think 2 years was perfect for this one. Minimal alcohol with a fair amount of barrel really make this a pleasure to drink. You do not taste the 11.5% at all. If this wasn't so spendy, I would have a fridge full of it."
"o: I had to try it, the concept is very cool. I just didn't enjoy the beer though."
""
"So my vertical tasting of all four of these is complete. Like the Rochefort tasting this was a bust. I am glad I did it but won't buy these again."
"O: i enjoyed tasting this beer and differentiating the characteristics, however, its not something that really caught my attention."
"If there's one liquor that works with the uber-sweet Harvest Ale, an islay scotch is it. Great mix of sweet and smoky."
"O - A fine beer. The peat smells and flavors are nothing I've ever seen in a beer before. Very interesting indeed. I enjoyed the earthy sweetness and peat smokiness together. Might drink again."
""

"O: one of the most enjoyable beer experiences I've ever had. I feel privalaged."
"Oh, and I bet this would make a KILLER barbecue sauce..."
""
""
""
""
"O- This is phenominal!!! It's everything I was hoping it would be! It's crazy how many things are going on in this glass! No wonder J.W. Lees is one of the top makers of Barleywine in the world... they really know how to do it! Really looking forward to trying all the variations of this brew."
"o: truly disgusted by this beer. this must be one of those that you either love or hate with no inbetween. the longer i look at this it looks like diarrhea in a glass. smells like a pile of wet half burnt leaves. tastes horrible. not even sure at this point if i want to continue cellaring the bottle i have left. i'm gonna drain pour something i paid a dollar an ounce for after one sip. truly disgusting."
"O - Really, really liked this beer. Love the scotch and it works really well with this style and beer. Would pay the price of this beer."
"Impressive beer still, but the barrel-aging imparts only subtle characteristics. Maybe a bit more spice. And a trace of peat."
"Overall: This may not be to my particular taste but I can still tell that it's an interesting and somewhat special beer. I'd definitely recommend it to someone wanting an intense English BW."
"Generally speaking, I skip these and go for the base beer."
"Overall Drinkability - Possibly the most complex and flavorful beer I've ever had."
"Appearance is probably the worst part of this beer, a muddied redwood brown with a thin wisp of head - no lacing and very little carbonation, almost still. The nose is bright with churned oaky butter, rich toffee and caramel bread pudding, plum qlong with a complex melange of salt, sea and iodine kicking off at the very end. The taste is just the opposite - with the whisky front and center - i could honestly guess this was aged in a lagavulin cask (or ardbeg) classic hallmarks of lagavulin, grainy, red fruit, tons of smoke and peat - and for me very medicinal i get iodine more than anything, but to me thats exactly how lagavulin tastes. The beers finishes very smooth and not overly sweet, a nice touch of slightly sour acidity and oaky tannins pull through the heavy amount of malts. I really, really liked this beer and im not a huge scotch guy much less islays, but it works here. 2010 vintage."
"Price = $11.99 at Whole Foods"
"D/O - Drinkability is moderately high. I would probably rate this as slightly better than the 2000 vintage of the Harvest ale I had recently. The Lagavulin cask really helps to cut the sweetness while adding much more diverse flavors. This is definitely a sipper, but I enjoyed every drop of this beer. I will be seeking out the other cask versions of this beer for sure!"
"A fine dessert beer that has mellowed into a pleasant sipper."
"This one poured out much like the others. The color is a dark orange with a very thin head on top and vanishes quickly. The smell of the beer has a sweet inviting aroma with some boozy qualities on the nose. The taste of the beer has a hefty amount of whiskey notes and sweet malts that are very flavorful. The mouthfeel of the beer is again creamy and smooth. Overall this beer much like the others is quite good, I feel that this one is probably my least favorite though."
"Overall, not very impressed with this; I enjoy the regular version much, much more."
"O: This is hands down one of the best beers I've ever had. Must try."
"D-Overall this is the best beer ive had to date. I set down and thought about this b/c i didn't want to hype up my 100th beer more than it was but this seriously tasted AMAZING. I saw other reviwes of the earlier vintages tasting like BBQ sause and not being pleasing. The 2004 is the Real deal. Get this beer if u can. It's complexity and smoothness was AMAZING. I want to have this again forsure."
"O: considerably better than the Sherry cask version. I still prefer the regular Harvest, but this was a welcome departure for an evening."
"Overall, a very unique beer. One that I am glad is readily available. Tons of earthy notes and dessert like sweetness. Nothing you could drink all night, but a great night cap or sipper."
"O - The Lagavulin version is an interesting yet challenging beer. Just short of world class."
"Taste- Again, all I can saw is damnit. Was so looking forward to this one."
"(275ml bottle-2006 edition). Pours cloudy caramel color with some floaties and no head. Aroma of whisky, caramel malts and some peat. Taste is sweet with a smokiness to it. Dried fruit dipped in sweet alcohol. Medium bodied with slick texture. Smooth finish. While its a sweet beer, its not cloying. The alcohol is well hidden."
"Overall- My overall impression of this beer is good. Good depth of flavor, interesting combination of sweet toffee maltiness, with smokey peated strong whiskey. The dominating character is of the whiskey, would like to see how that changes with time. I have another bottle that I am sitting down for at least 5 years to see how things play out over some time."
"(D)- This definitely drinks more like a liquor. While its not flat, it is very very and sweet that taking drink after drink would just be too much for me. Little sips of this go a long way."
"Pours a hazy brown-ish to orange-ish color, with a tan head. In the aroma, oaky, with a hint of whiskey. In the taste, oaky, whiskey all the way through it and a nice dry malt. A small alcohol like bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry oaky whiskey flavor in the aftertaste. Like drinking whiskey with out the burn, nice big flavor, but nose is lacking a bit."
"So, interesting experiment, happy to try it, unlikely to return to it."
"I'll try a more recent brew if I come across it, but will not want to try the 2007 vintage again. Unfortunately I have another one in my (currently) 5 bottle cellar (deep drawer in a cool part of the house)."
"D: Drinkability is probably where this beer suffers most, as it's pretty sweet and smoky which may turn some people off, not me however. Sometimes rauchbiers can be a little to smokey for me but I found this to be the perfect balance between smokiness and maltiness."
"Thanks to my pal Ron for access to this 2007 vintage bottle. A somewhat murky toffee color with a scant white ring on top and very little lacing. The aroma says nice smoky oak with toffee and ham, even chocolate with a very deep scotch whiskey base. Uniquely beautiful. The flavor comes on with a surprisingly smooth and mellow blend of sweet smoky toffee with pineapple scotch and molasses malt. The sweet smoke that results from this scotch themed ale is so unusual and delicious. So easy to drink despite the obvious alcohol presence. It's near full bodied with fair but light carbonation. One of the better brews of the year, especially for the scotch whiskey lovers out there. Awesome."
"The barrel adds a lot to this one! I love the peaty whiskey. You can taste a TON of smokiness on this one and a lot of earthiness. It adds a lot to the beer I feel"
"Overall it was a fun experience and it makes me want to try the other variants. I'd have this one again too."
"Oh well, at least I will never be tempted to pay $9 for a 12 oz. bottle of this."
"Drink is decent, a bit of warming booze, quite a bit of smoke and mesquite, but drinkable."
"Because this beer doesn't say Harvest Ale ""Ham Cask", I can only give this beer a low grade. It's something better than gross, but ultimately, after the humor dies down, it is really just a disappointment given the cost and potential. Don't buy this unless you love ham."
"2008 ale. No head at pour, very tiny ring around edge of glass. Medium brown color with an Orange tint, very haxy, becomes clearer and a more dark copper color with warmth. Lots of sediment in the bottom of the glass, and that was without pouring all the sludge in the bottle. A little thick looking during the pour. Sweet malt aroma and heavy packed woody toasted aroma from the whisky casks and a roasted note underneath, slight hint of ""bacon"". Very full aroma. Toasted cask flavor hits immediately in the beginning. Very sweet sweet end and lingers on into the finish. Very thick mouthfeel with mild carbonation. Very petey aftertaste. Heavy on the cask flavor. Alcohol hides quite well in this one. This ale may have one of the most cask imparted flavored I've ever had. Glad I got to try this one."
"Don't think I would go for this one again, too boozy."
"This is definitely a sipper. It would go well with rich meats such as ham or pork tenderloin."
"A little on the sweet side, but the alcohol is well integrated, and the taste is decadent."
"This is an amazingly complex beer. I don't know that I like the flavor but something this complex....it's very enjoyable."
"The key to this ""beer"" is that it should be treated like scotch and sipped slowly over a long period of time (i.e., shared). This is a fantastic malty barleywine, and the Lagavulin notes are very strong. At times this tasted more like scotch than beer. Took me 90 minutes to finish this because it's more like drinking three glasses of scotch than one bottle of beer. (Also I had already downed a pint of Rare Vos, a half pour of Hobgoblin, and a pate appetizer before the bottle was cracked. Not the best planning.) I would recommend this to barleywine and single malt fans but not noobs, and it would be wise to share the bottle with a friend."
"Cheers!"
"Either way, between the two of us we really enjoyed it and it was a great treat. I really is designed to be enjoyed on its own, but I am willing to bet it is magnificent with any dense chocolate deserts. If you find a bottle, they are pricey. But hold onto it for a good ten years and it will be priceless."
"All in all I feel j.w took one step further or trekked another path with this barley wine . If you only like traditional english barley wines, and loathe smokiness you may want to pass. But if you'd like to challenge your palette and see a place where barley wines have yet to venture definitely go out and get this one,highly recommended."
"2007 Vintage. Bought for me by my wife as a gift last week, and I'm finally able to give it a try. Pours from the smallish 9.3 ounce bottle a dark golden color, with barely a bit of head. Big smoky, phenolic aromas, along with some caramel, oak and vanilla in the background. On the palate, the smoke again dominates the caramel, butterscotch and alcohol. Very, very good, but it doesn't improve upon the original."
"Brewed in 2008. Another beast from the VDubb directorate. This one pours a cloudy tawny amber with a light wisp of bubbles on top that dies away quickly enough to make me think it may have descended from teflon-drenched ninjas. The nose blasts the 'strils with peat-smoked whiskey goodness. Behind that (I think) are notes of toffee, mild citrus, and graham crackers. Man, that's a lot o' smoke! The taste is significantly different, with sweet toffee, maple syrup, candi sugar and caramel trouncing the taste buds just as the smoke dominated the smell receptors. A light bit of Sunny D-style citrus joins in, along with some o' that Lagavulin in the background, all surreptitious and whatnot. The harsh sweetness and seeming dearth of Lagavulin on my tongue hurt the overall score a bit. The body is a heavy medium, with a very light carbonation and a gooey feel. Overall, I was surprised to find that this version is not as good as the normal Lees b-wine. It also made me long to have a few bottles o' Lagavulin to enjoy..."
"Lagavulin is possibly my favorite single malt scotch, so I'm looking forward to trying a nice vintage bottle of this brew. There is virtually no head or lace on this hazy brown beer. Aromas consist of sweet malt, cherries, apple brandy, and alcohol. The scotch barrel really comes through nicely. Some time in the cellar served this beer very well. I had a very young bottle of this once, and didn't care for it much, as the alcohol presence was overbearing. This beer drinks very smoothly, as I'm sure the aging process mellowed this beast out a bit. This was a tasty beer, and good for sharing several ways. An ounce or two was plenty. I recommend trying this beer, but only after it has spent some years in the cellar."
"Note: Re-visiting the 2009 version with two years of age produces a bit more of a carbonated mouthfeel as well as a much stronger smokey/peaty character - bump the mouthfeel and overall by .5"
"Overall I really enjoyed this, but more for the fact that I love scotch than anything else. That said, the sweetness and smoothness of the ale balanced out the Islay intensity, and made this very drinkable. Recommended."
"Overall, another exceptional Harvest Ale! Possibly the best I have had from J.W. Lees (tried the regular, calvados and port). The Lagavulin casks are very well done and add another nice level of complexity to an already complex beer. An excellent pairing of whisky and beer. I definitely need to buy a few more these to lay down in the cellar."
"This version works much better than the Calvados verison owing to the whiskey and vanilla melding well with the barley wine flavours. Drinking it made me wonder what Thomas Hardy would taste like if someone picked up the recipe and put in different casks. I think the peaty flavours of the Lagavulin came through in the midbody and added a new level of complexity to this already great beer. Love to taste this 5 years onwards"
"Taste is very enjoyable, strong scotch barrel smokiness - similarities abound from the Lagavulin I know and enjoy. Some raisin maltiness and enjoyable mix of vanilla and sherry. Nice medium smooth body, goes down very easy, but you definitely feel the alcohol, particularly as it lingers on the follow through."
"MF is a bit thinner than regular J.W., though not terrible. Still smooth and coating. Drinkability is slowed way down by the flavors, which I find to be fine on their own, but difficult when combined in this fashion. A nice try, though a slight miss in my book, it does make me interested to try the Calvados cask though."
"Pours a flat honey brown color; little to no head. The aroma is of a candied malt, musty, lots of pepper and honey; hints of smoke in the end. The taste is very very sweet. Booze soaked candied white grapes, sugar and honey, lots of pepper. There is a light smokiness from the whisy, which is nice and gives a much needed balance to this beer. Not much else of the whisky flavor comes through which is disappointing. The feel is thick and slick, soft carbonation; finishes very sweet, sticky. A big heavy pale malt brew. Lots of candied flavors, good smoke but not much actualy whisky flavor. Must say that I am disappointed with this beer. I expected a much bigger whisky presence, especially to help offset the very sweet and heavy malt. Sips well I guess."
"D: I have a couple of bottles at home, but not sure if I'll ever get to drink from the cask again. This was a real treat and the highlight of the evening. A very full bodied sipping beer to be broken out on very special occasions."
"Wow...a heck of a lot better than I thought it was going to be. Due to the aroma and appearance, I thought this was going to be one of those raisin overkill beers! It definitely has strong raisin/fig notes but tolerable...especially with the complimentary whisky flavor and therefore booze burn throughout. Thick and full body, low carbonation. A very, very sweet flavored beer...that's for sure. Not my favorite in the JW Lees Harvest series, but very good and glad I got to try this one as well."
"Poured into my Westy chalice a cloudy reddish brown color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy off-white head, with some oil slicks left behind. The nose is malty, with some whiskey/oak notes, some figs, raisins, plums. The taste is sweet, malty, with some very nice whiskey/oak/smoke notes, some dark fruit notes as well. Medium body. Very Drinkable, another awesome Harvest Ale from JW Lees. I might have to just trade for some for a nice little stash."
"The palate opens big and sweet with caramel, honey, bready and breakfast cereal-like sweetness with some creamy and milky character. Excellent. The sweet finish with honey, apple and fruit is quite delightful. Full in body with low carbonation, this is a great beer. The sweetness does reduce the drinkability, though."
"D- big and nearly cloying at times. I do prefer the taste of the Lagavulin cask version over the port cask however."
"03-06-2010 "
"Didn't get much Lagavulin character, will seek out a more recent vintage to re-review."
"Very light carbonation, medium to light mouthfeel."
"D- The alcohol is quick to come and quick to go. Complex, even at 2 years and not overly sweet. I really want to try this at about 10 years, but even now it is outstanding. Well done JW Lees! Now I'm going to have to go wash this down with some Lagavulin."
"9.3 ounce bottle, brewed in 2006. Served in a snifter, the beer pours a cloudy orange/brown color with some floaties and pretty much no head at all. Not much lacing either. I like the aroma of this beer a lot, it smells like smoke, peat, band-aids, raisins, and brown sugar. The taste is similar to the aroma. It tastes like brown sugar, smoke, peat, raisins and figs. Very nice Scotch Whisky scents and tastes in this brew. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick and rich but also seems a little bit thin to me at times too. Drinkability is pretty good, it's smooth and pretty easy to drink. I like this brew a lot, and I'd definitely buy this again. Of course it helps I like smoky Scotch Whisky too."
"This is very interesting. It still does not compare to the original Harvest Ale. If you see it, I would recommend giving it a try just for the experience. It is hard to improve upon a near perfect beer to begin with though."
"Argh, what can I say? Did I get a bad bottle? It was nearly flat and syrupy sugar sweet. Like a liquid candy bar with a weird off-taste. Rancid maple syrup. I think the yeast pitched for bottle conditioning was somehow killed. Undrinkable. One sip, a few minutes to recover, then another to be sure. Straight down the drain :("
"Overall, a fantastic and interesting English style barleywine. If it weren't so cloyingly sweet, I'd have definitely had more. However, it makes a great nightcap in small quantities. Definitely a sipper."
"M, D- The concentrated flavor, sweetness, and viscosity make this one for sipping along with cheeses, as one would a tawny port or sherry. ABV masked and unapparent."
"Notes: A tremendous barrel aged blend. It maintains the richness of the Harvest ale and a clear and disticnt Lagavulin sense without being either."
"D: The weak spot of this beer, for sure. Too much of it would be overbearing, but a bottle to split with a friend is pure joy."
"Mouthfeel is medium to full and mostly flat. Drinkability is low...this tastes OK is just doesn't really suit my palate. The cask aging definitely detracts from the base beer here."
"Taste was syrupy and smoky. I found this to be a strange and not very appealing combination. I realize using scotch barrels is where this came from. Some may like it but I could not get past the incredible sweetness and the smokiness thrown in just didn't do it for me."
"2007 vintage drunk 11-08. The tiny 9oz bottle poured into my DFH 22oz snifter. Apricot colored, lightly hazy with yeast, no head. It's an odd discord, the color vs the smell. When I think about this beer, it should be a murky black brown and purple, instead of the rich orangy-pink that it is. The nose on this thing is alll lagavulin, and that's a great thing. Smokey raisins and a light fusel alcohol burn. Some rich char and sweet honey malts push through the smoke. The flavor follows the aroma, sweet sweet smoke, dried fruits: raisins and figs, candied orange peel, finishes with a nice clean lightly smokey aftertaste. Goes down nice and smooth, lightly coating but not cloying or sticky. I could put these things away until I fell into a drunken coma, but the booze is definitely there. This is the perfect marriage of whisky and barleywine."
"2006. A bit of haze clouded this otherwise orange/amber beer. Not much of a cap appeared, but a very thin collar ringed the glass and produced fine spots of transient lace. Caramel and biscuit aromas were present in the aroma, but had a smoky, peaty character, nearly charcoal, sitting just above them. Slight vanilla and bread. Low bitterness, this is all about sweet malts and scotch. Lots of caramel, a hint of toffee, bread and biscuit, with a bit of smoke and peat that appear towards the finish. Lingering alcohol and Islay character. Full bodied, low carbonation, smooth and just short of sticky. Quite drinkable and tasty."
"Poured brown with lots of suspended yeast and a tiny head that disappeared immediately. Aroma was alcohol and something sweet. The taste was just too sweet for my tastes. Over ripe fruit was there in abundance too. The feel seems heavy because the suspended yeast gives the allusion of drinking a gel. I don't think that drinkability could be that high due to the sweet taste. Overall, the beer had a lot of nice qualities, but I could not get over the sense that I had a mouthful of sugar."
"Drinkability is good as a one and out beer. You could enjoy every sip of this one."
"Overall this is perhaps the most I've ever tasted peat in a beer. Well worth a shot."
"M&D - relatively smooth, a but drier than the others, with some added tartness and a bit more alcohol bite, but darn tasty"
"I won't shed a tear now that this bottle is gone because I know that there are many more in my future. Bottom line: no beer that I've ever tasted has a more perfect combination of Islay Scotch whiskey and classic English barleywine. If you're a fan of both, then what the hell are you waiting for?"
"I am very glad to have tried this beer."
"One of the beers that I will always remember. Spectacular beer - the smokiness hadn't picked up the sausagey quality I've found in the bottle version. In this is was woody and dry and magnificently balancing."
"D: Not great, but not bad. I wouldn't mind sitting down with a bottle or two and sip it as I watch a nice classic movie e.g. The Godfather."
"Drinkability- Boosted up by the mouthfeel. This beer would be top notch if not for the odd smokey flavor. Maybe that's a traditional lagaluvin flavor in the oak?"
"The pour was very, very nice. A rich dark brown in color with a light smattering of reddish tints on the sides and the bottom of the glass. Some light tan head coming up over the top of the brew and settling down after a few minutes into a bare top. The aroma was unmistakeable, like a fine old ale almost. Lots of oak and whiskey, hints of vanilla and toffee coming through very nicely throughout. This was about as tight of beer as I am going to come across tonight thats for damn sure. Rich, super sweet with loads of toffee and caramel flavors. Hints of apples and lots of vanilla are all over this one. The alcohol has all but faded away and left a supremly well defined ale in its place. Super rich and wonderful as the glass warms up to room temperature, it only seems to get better. Lots of toffee and vanilla and soo sweet and syrup like. The word mellow hardly does it justice. Overall I was very, very happy with this one for sure. One of the better beers I have had in the last few months."
"M: its confusing. Full bodied, yet thin bodied. very nice beer and ages well. a little flat, but 5 years would do that. very smooth, slightly creamy."
"Taste: Really sweet. Mellow alcohol doesn't get in the way of the enjoyment, but the alcohol is definitely upfront. Whiskey flavor doesn't dominate as I expected it too. Almost has a bit of smokiness to it because of the barrel aging."
"2006 Note: After enjoying the 2005 so much, I had 2006, which is not nearly as good. WAY too smokey for my taste."
"D: Certainly an interesting beer, I've never had an Islay whisky barrel aged beer before, I'm certainly a fan of the whisky. Not entirely what I expected, but it was fun to try. I now want to try the other J.W. Lee's barrel aged line."
"D - I have been astonished by every variation of JW Lees Harvest Ale that I have had thus far, and while this version is complex and enjoyable, like its siblings, it does not quite live up to the others. The excellence of the base beer shines through in the complex sweetness, but the whiskey cask doesn't seem to have contributed too much to the mix. Combine that with the fact that this is one of the least visually appealing beers I have come across in some time, and your have a beer that is interesting and quite good, but unable to live up to the expectations that its brand has earned."
"2006 vintage. Right off, I love Lagavulin, so I was really looking forward to this one. It did not disappoint. Poured oily copper with a short-lived 1 cm off-white head. No lacing. The peaty, petroleum, salty Lagavulin is up front in the nose. Smokey grain and booze as well. First sip was a little off-putting, just like the cask of the whiskey it was finished in. After that, the beer settles in. Bitter, salty, peaty, smoky goodness. The oak and the sweeter caramel and toffee malts are a nice contrast in the finish. Some cherry and fig flavors come with it, but the star is the grain and malt of the beer balanced against the strength of the Islay malt. Slow but easy drinking without being sticky. Loved this."
"The strange combination of flavors would make this a tough session beer (as well as the high ABV), but I'm not having a hard time sipping away at this. It gets better further into the bottle."
"Good timing as it was really cold that night. I'll definitely dip my toe back in the barley wine waters..."
"Bottle: Poured a cloudy amber color ale with a small foamy head with average retention and minimal lacing. Aroma of sweet English style malt with some whiskey notes. Taste is a complex mix between some sweet English style malt with some distinctive arming notes of whiskey and barley. Full body with limited filtration and average carbonation but no apparent alcohol. Very well done but I still prefer the Port version."
"I didnt like this one at all. Sweet, alcoholic, and not for me. I drank about 4 ounces of mine and gave the rest to my dad, who then finished only about half of the rest. I have the other three but I am not excited about trying them."
"D - Very good beer, wonderful taste"
"D- Quite sweet. I'd definitely reccomnend splitting a bottle with someone. It was very unique to see the immense difference from the 04 to the 07. The color alone makes me believe that there was a recipe alternation between these vintages. (3.5)"
"I'm a huge Lagavulin fan so when I saw this beer at Knightly it was a no brainer. Brewed in 2004 consumed in April 2006. Murky-cloudy amber color. Coaxed out off white head. Nice lacing. Huge sweet fruity (cherries and dates) Barleywine like nose. I can also smell the peat and smokiness from the Lagavulin casks. There is also some hoppiness. My sight and smell senses are telling me this is going to be one full flavored aggressive tasting beer. Just what I like. OK. The taste. Instantly I get hit by the fruit sweetness and in lesser amounts I taste the peat, vanilla, smokiness and then some slight hop notes. Then midway this beer evens out into silky smoothness and finishes very light as compared to how it started. Sure that was only the first sip. As the experience progressed the fruit flavors become more apparent. I taste cherries, plum and dates. This beer is very much like Avery's Samael except for the added peatiness. Excellent tasting beer that leaves a lingering smoky peaty flavor behind. A bit too sweet for my taste. Might need another year or two to peak."
"Drinkability = I'm almost done!"
"pours a very murky apple juice look with a quickly fading white head. the nose is chewy smelling malts, subtle fruit, apricot, burned caramel. Woah! the taste is crazy sweet! cherries, charred oak, caramel, very oaky, I like the oak. medium bodied, subtle whiskey flavor in the finish, very sweet finish, masks the alcohol like crazy, gets better as it breathes."
"Wow. 12 ounce bottle poured into my Delirium Tremens snifter. Pours with very little head, even with an aggressive pour. Head quickly settles to a small ring. Loads of sediment floating around. Has a very alluring deep orange tint. Lots of whiskey in the nose. Amazing flavor profile, extremely complex. Very, very sweet. Smoky, woody flavors abound. This is most definitely a sipper, but it keeps you sipping deeply throughout. Anyone who is a fan of cask or barrel conditioning ought to check this out. Very impressive."
"Sampled 09/22/08. Out of the 275 ml bottle this 1.5% ALC (!) brew was downright murky apple cider brown with lots of sediment floating in it. Thin white head faded quickly to a tiny ring. Moderate lacing in a tight ring. Big and sweet fruit aroma, apples, pears, raisins along with yeast, alcohol esters and an underlying nuttiness. The flavors were a slap across the face. So smoky I could barely believe it. Upon second sample the nearly-cloying sweetness came through first, typical barely wine dark fruit, raisins and dates, followed by the clearly whiskey imparted smoke. Sugar and smoke; reminded of a deep south BBQ sauce. Caramel, toffee and a surprisingly small alcohol nip masked by the complex flavors and aromas. Very soft carbonation makes this like drinking an after dinner snifter. Impressive but punchy. Great example of the style and an amazing marriage of beer and Scotch, if you dig both it's a must-try."
"Glad I tried it to see if I would enjoy a scotch conditioned Barleywine but I will stick to traditional English or American BW's in the future."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable for this level of sweetness and alcohol; in my opnion, these Harvest Ales are better young than old, so drink 'em if you got 'em!"
"Overwhelming alcohol and the syrup is too much. But still holds the nut and rasin/fig flavors as always."
"I LOVE JW LEE""S and LAGAVULIN!! What a match this was. Poured a deep chestnut in color with a tight, creamy tan head. The nose is very sweet, notes of raisins, brandy, sugar and alcohol. Taste is at first intensely sweet. Smoky w/ some vanilla undertones. Lots of peat and a beer to be respected."
"D - One of the most drinkable beers considering the ABV, far surpassing quadrupels as far as I'm concerned. Big and robust, but overall a mild brew. I would drink this forever."
"D - this is a very, very cool beer (and the cask looked awesome) limited in drinkabiltiy somewhat by its strength and sweetness. Really good to have 1 or 2, but wouldn't want to attempt more than that in 1 sitting."
"D- Excellent if you like cask conditioned beer. It is perfect for the style but it you aren't prepared for what's in the bottle you won't like it. I enjoyed this but it is definitely a bottle to split amongst friends. Very much a sipper."
"Drinkability - If your looking for a beer with a scotch feel to it, this is your beer. I'm a huge scotch fan, so I loved this one. The flavor and the cask aging marry well. One to sip on as a night cap and enjoy at the end of the night."
"Drinkability is moderate. Complexity of flavor makes for a great experience, but strength of flavors at this point slows consumption. Alcohol is quite high which definitely limits the consumption of this brew. However, the alcohol is very well hidden. A nice barleywine."
"Outstanding."
"D: This is a pretty high ABV barley wine, and honestly will limit how much you can drink. This is more of a sipping drink, which is what I used it for and how I suggest it be drank to fully enjoy everything it has to offer."
"Definitely a sipper, this one is the last to have in a night."
"2006 vintage. The beer pours a dark amber color with absolutely no head. The whiskey cask bolts through in the aroma with a strong peat smell. Also some malty characteristics. Sweet on the palate, the peat scotch aspect is also there but not as strong as the nose would suggest. The sweetness is fruit and sugar and the whiskey nature appears at the end along with a hint of alcohol. Over all the a good night cap. The whiskey cask definitely imparts a unique characteristic to this one."
"Incredible. A tour de force. Just fabulous stuff."
"This is so amazing, I can't recommend it highly enough! Pick one up as soon as you are able."
"2006 vintage. Pours a juicy amber/orange. Minimal head that is fed by low carbonation. The nose is peaty with some campfire notes. Was hoping for a touch more after having the Sherry Cask but not let down at all. Malty sweetness mingles with tingley smoked/oaked peatiness on the tongue, what an amazing mixture! Aftertaste is lively and full of oak. Silky, velvety mouth feel. Pleasant amounts of heat, very sippable. Amazing, a must try."
"This beer poured a nice orange, copper color with virtually no head at all but rather a small collar of white foam. Lacing was very minimal. The smell was dominated by whiskey and smoke. The taste was extremely smokey sweet. Very similar to cane syrup. Even pulled some cane syrup out and tasted them together. VERY similar. The mouthfeel was syrupy with little to no carbonation. Overall a fantastic brew but I would rather the Calvados cask instead. Still a great brew to sip on after dinner on a cold night."
"Not a bad beer at all, certainly different than what I normally drink. All in all, I don't think I'd be willing to spend seven bucks on this bottle again, but I'm glad I tried it."
"D = This has good drinkability, I would recommend it for an after dinner drink. However, I think it will definitely improve with a little more age."
"The pour is still. I was expecting this and take no exception. There is no sediment in the bottle that moves into the glass. The smell of scotch and root beer co-mingle. The taste is of scotch, root beer and ale. The mouthfeel is silky. The nose is beguilingly alcoholic. If you can rely upon the care of this beer in a cellar I'd buy it and try it."
"Drinks alright despite the dryness. My advice; let this age at least 2 more years"
"d: I am shocked at how easy drinking this is. Its dangerous stuff. A very enjoyable beer, but with the price tag, I won't be enjoying another one for quite some time."
"J.W. Lees Harvest Ale matured in Lagavulin Whisky Casks brewed in 2006 pours a dark, dense, opaque, amber peach with no head. The smell is srong of malts with a prominent whisky aroma in the background. It is truely a phenomenal smell that almost makes me feel like I'm drinking it just by taking large wafts from my glass. Taste is strong and malty with a honey sweet aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium dense, with little to no carbonation. Its silky smooth and easy to hold in my mouth without becoming the slightest bit unpleasant. This is a fine, fine drink. Well worth the money and taking a long time to enjoy."
"Thick, low carbonation. Very chewy mouthfeel. I can't class this as a barleywine or a Scotch ale, but it seems to combine the best of both worlds."
"Final impression: The result definitely makes me want to try the other cask varieties available."
"This beer is a marvel. A classic barleywine, by far one of the most syrupy beers i have ever drank. It feels like you could pour it on pancakes. Be careful in pouring unless you like a lot of lees in your beer. nose is of food, it smells like a resteraunt. no head whatsoever, pours with the texture of watered down olive oil. The taste is very, very, very warm and is almost like a meal in a glass. I dont think i could drink two of these if i tried they are so filling. much more flavor than the port cask version of this beer. despite the soupiness, this is a great beer."
"The base beer is delicious, in fact the 1999 Harvest Ale has been my favorite beer so far. The pour is noticeably different in colour, a bit darker amber, similar to a light burbon and was the haziest of the flight. The base flavors come through similarly to the 2006 Harvest ale, it's just as rich. The nose and taste are lightly overpowered by the Lagavulin characteristics. It's an interesting and complex addition, lending notes of wood, dust, smoke, light ash, like a very smooth burbon. This beer was quite young, and I think a few more years would mellow it out very nicely. I'd love to taste an earlier vintage (or the 2006 in a few years), hopefully the barrel characteristics would fall a bit into a subtle backbone and the sweet notes would smooth together, like noticed in the 99 and 02 vintages. Tasty and flavorful, just a bit unbalanced after one year. Nice sipper, less of a desert than the others."
"Likely my least favorite of the cask-conditioned varieties offered by J.W. Lees. Of course the base-beer is phenominal, and just mature enough. The character that the Lagavulin whisky seemed to work within the framework of the Barleywine but has a few moments where it seems somewhat overbearing. The flavor of peaty Scotch gives the beer a strong ethynol flavor and feel that interferes slightly with the drinakability. The wood character gives the beer a very bold earthy, woodsy, peaty flavor that edges on fresh oak. The smoke flavor and aroma also persists throughout making the beer more campfire-like. When all the flavors come together, the beer turns out good -- not the normal 'great' that you get from J.W. Lee's, but only good this time. It seems that a couple of years is sorely needed to round the beer out and to meld the flavors together. The previous and younger versions seem overbearing with the Scotch flavor and feel but I didn't get the same impression here."
"This beer pours a bright brown color with reddish hues. The head is light tan in color, and one inch in height. It recedes slowly into a nice cap of lacing. The aroma is dominated by the lagavulin. Dusty old wood, disinfectant, Band-Aids, Scotch, caramel, It is a very interesting aroma, which makes me want to explore the beer more. The taste is more beery than the aroma. It is very sweet with caramel, rock candy, and whiskey. The mouthfeel is full bodied, but considerably lighter than that of the version aged in port casks. Carbonation is light with a silky texture. Overall, this is a very interesting beer. I would drink it again."
"I have quite mixed emotions about this beer. Lagavulin used to be my go-to whisky until the price got so high, and I was tremendously inrtigued by this beer. Unfortunately, this beer is somewhat of a mess. The beer is too sweet, and the whisky comes through merely through its powerful peatiness and nothing else. Its like someone watered down the Lagavulin and dumped a bunch of honey in it. The beer is sweet, viscous, and strong, and wildly out of balance. That being said, I think the beer has some real potential. I'm drinking a 2006 vintage. I think this needs about 5 years in the bottle to integrate and mellow. The color is a beautiful burnished orangey copper with no head or lacing. The smell gives you a hint of that wonderful Lagavulin smoke without it overwhelming. I'll review it again in five years. In the meantime, I'll try the others in the series."
"Pours a hazy golden/copper, thin white head, tons of lace, settles to a nice layer. Smell is intense, whiskey, lots of toffee, dates, vanilla, fruit, alcohol, nice. Taste is smoky, vanilla, toffee, bread, sweet malty peat, alcohol, very malty and rich finish. Mouthfeel is full bodied, almost syrupy, with low carbonation, almost silky, has some heat to it. Pretty neat, I would be interested in trying all the others in this series. Thanks Russ!"
"D: The mellow malt tones and unique complexity of flavor make this a rarity. I would highly recommend this to anyone who prefers more malty, English-style barleywines or big, malty beers. This one seems to rise above both categories with its balance and distinct flavor. Aging is also key to enjoying this beer, so if you've been storing one for a few years, crack it open around 3 years and enjoy!"
"drinkability is surprisingly good. like the scotch that it was aged in, it's a sipper, but very nice. the alcohol is balanced well against the malt and sweetness, with the smoke playing a nice role."
"Drinkability - It's a sipper. Being a big fan of barleywines i fully intend on getting another one to put in the cellar to be enjoyed next Christmas season. It's not too early to start planning you know...but i think only one more will fit into my budget. This one almost broke the bank."
"Pours a two finger cream head that fades quickly to a thin layer leaving a little lace. Cloudy amber color. Light carbonation and very heavy bodied. Raisin/rummy nose. Flavor is sweet rum with alcohol overtones sweet cough syrup finish, cloying. Pricey - $6.99 for a 275ml bottle from John's Grocery Iowa City, Ia."
"On the palate this beer was far fruitier than I expected, even after the fruit element in the nose. Smooth, nutty fruits come out first, then an alcoholic burn that is soft like the burn in a good whisky. Pronounced, bright fruitiness that reminds me of apples and strawberries. A blast of smokiness comes through in the finish, which is very long and active. The mouthfeel is heavy but not really thick, and carbonation is quite light. It works, though, as it concentrates the flavors on the tongue extremely well. Overall this is a fabulous barleywine. I love the smokiness that the whisky barrels contribute; the fact that they do so without compromising the fruity aspect of the beer is very welcome. There's great complexity here, and the flavors present are of high quality. This beer is just all around excellent."
" Pours out a hazy orange/yellow with not much head. Looks nice though. Nose is very complex, with overlapping sweet plums, yeast, cinnamon and general spiciness, and alcohol. Taste is great, with a nice sweet breadiness, and none of the sourness seen in many barleywines. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both above average, but look out for the ABV."
"Pours an orange-amber almost thick liquid lacking any head. However, a little lacing remained. The Lagavulin (Scotch) aroma is very good. The aroma is only of scotch and slight malt. The beer completely lacks hop aroma and taste. The mouthfeel is far heavier then expected. This beer is drinkable, but not for the faint of heart. Be prepared for som alcohol. 11.%abv."
"The basics said, I saw this beer and was excited as Lagavulin is my favorite Scotch along with Laphroig's offerings. The price tag of nearly $9 a bottle is steap. So I was kind enough to purchase the bottle and put it in my stocking and told my wife she had bought me a stocking stuffer. Well, it was a bad stocking stuffer and I have myself to blame. So, be fore warned, this is not worth the high price. Maybe if it was aged for 10 years, but don't buy it thinking you are going to get the glorious balance of Lagavulin...think drinking unhopped wort from an export Scottish ale."
"Cheers!"
"Fantastic mahogany color with very little head or carbonation rising to the surface. The smell is an earthy, oaky, smokey, dark fruit aroma, reminds me of mince-meat pie for some reason (the kind with the molasses and currants, not the meat one). The taste is a little sweet for my tastes, very much of the molasses sweetness, with brandy being the predominant lingering taste. It leaves a sweetness on the lips as well. I could use a little more bite up front, although there is something to be said for the smoothness."
"The mouth is syrupy but it somehow works. Great sipper for cold weather."
"The mouthfeel is thick from all of the residual sugars. Very intensely sweet. Not easy to drink. I would like to try some other English barleywines other than JW Lees, but alas I only have access to the four cask versions (04 and 05), plus the regular vintages from 1998-2004, however no other English barleywine in the area."
"drinkability: fine"
"Slàinte!"
"D: This is the best of JW Lee's cask-aged harvest ales. It provides a nice smooth, smoky mouthfeel that doesn't overwhelm the drinker with scotch strength."
"great brew. i'll look for as many as i can get my hands on"
"all in all this was a good barley wine. My expecations were high, so thisin the end left me a little bit flat. I love Lagavulin and was perhaps looking for more of a pronounced Islay feel. This is definitely worth a try for people to see for themselves. I would like to see how this one stands up to age. Mine was only a year+ old"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Syrupy and, once again, smooth like a fine port. Silky, subtle carbonation at first, mellowing further to none at all. I would normally see that as a flaw... but it works tremendously in this beer. I have been sipping and savoring this amazing treat for the better part of an hour now, and realize that beer aged in whisky casks is hit-or-miss... but this must be sampled to be believed. A desert island selection for me."
"Drinkability & Notes  Its amazing, this beer actually seems smokier than whiskey does in my experience, possibly due to the lower alcohol and carbonation. Certainly an interesting beer to give to anyone who loves scotch or if you are looking to start drinking scotch yourself, but I think in this case that the barrel aging reduced the character of this normally spectacular beer. Not sure how they can claim this has the same ABV as the standard, with this much flavor from the spirit some more booze must have made its way into the beer."
"Pours amber in color with a thin white lace on top. Whiskey is very prevalent in the nose along with sweet and smokey malt. Taste is exceptionally smooth and creamy! The Lagavulin Whiskey is definately present in the taste as well as some smokiness and some honey. I am typcally not a huge fan of thick and sweet brews but J.W. Lees really knocks my socks off! Overall, this is an interesting brew that I look forward to having in the future."
"Not an easy drinker to be sure, but a nice sipper. If you don't like whiskey, don't even bother."
"Poured this into a snifter, dark orange brown with little head retention. The nose is sweet with choclate and cider. The taste mimicks the nose, but becomes much sweeter than expected. It finishes with the Lagavulin notes. Smoke, salt, seaweed, fire, all the good stuff. It finishes rather cloying, making this a one and done for me, but something I would like to visit with again."
"This is the first of thw special-cask Lee's harvest ales I have tried, and while it is a novelty, at this age I see nothing exceptional about this beer."
"Just as sweet, if not sweeter than the calvados, this beer has a smoked ham taste if aerated through the mouth. Viscous, with the tropical fruit flavor of the calvados & a touch of rauchbier. It's fascinating how the same beer oaked differently can take on such different and unique flavor characteristics. While Calvados was good, this one has subtler nuanced flavors, and is more enjoyable."
"For me this is a dessert beer and unfortunately it's my first pour of the evening. When the lambic mood strikes, reach for a curious alternative."
"Overall: 2004 Lagavulin Whisky  As with the other Cask aged brews I find that the sweetness of the Harvest Ale overpowers the delicate nuances of the barrel aging. Maybe a little time is needed to scale down the sweetness, like about 5 years judging by the regular Harvest Ale. Might be worth revisiting in 2009."
"The first taste made me think I was drinking some kind of meade. This beer is insanely sweet, more so than the other version JW Lees makes of these beers. I was really straining to taste the Lagavulin notes. Smokey flavors were evident along with some malt. I prefered it actually at a cooler temperature, because as it warmed, it was almost like drinking smoked liquid sugar. Diabetics beware of this one. Overall I would not drink this again. I dont think that its a good representation of a barley wine, but more of a ""neat"" beer to experience."
"The high amount of RS and somewhat thin mouthfeel are making this beer lack rather largely in the mouthfeel and drinkability department. Much prefer JW Lees Vintage ale but can't wait to try the others."
"D - Very interesting and definetly a sipper/apertif kind of drink. One is enough."
"A beverage of certain extremes. A so-so barleywine taste boosted by clear scotch whiskey and wood flavoring, an interest cloudy pour. An aroma that is at the same time beer as it is whiskey. A not so satisfying drinking experience yet smooth. Not a perfect show: Forget it, Jake, it's Chinatown."
"275 ml bottle. Pours out a hazy brown color with almost no head. The aroma is caramel, raisins, and smoke. Sticky, sweet caramel flavor combined with an earthy smokiness. Oddly, a little salty. Mouthfeel is nearly flat and syrupy. Rough alcohol flavor, especially as the beer warms. There are some interesting flavors in this beer, but it is not an improvement on the original Harvest Ale. Certainly worth trying, but I doubt I would get it again, especially at the high price."
"Light copper, much lighter in color than regular Harvest. The aroma, though multi-dimensional, is pretty gentle and wimpy overall with light oak, peaty hints, saffron, cigarette ashtray, caramel and scotch hints. Engaging, but unrefined barrel contribution. Smoky and alcoholic with caramel and scotch flavors. Heavy feel with a lightly creamy texture. Not enjoyable at all and an honest drainpour for me. Harvest and Lagavulin is not a good idea."
"When I first saw these four barley wines lined up next to each other on the shelf at Binny's, I told myself I would try these beers soon. And I of course bought one of each, the same day I bought two bottles of Scaldis Prestige at $42 a bottle!!! But I must give my praises to J.W. Lees Brewery for four very....extremely interesting and thought provoking beers. These beers raised my expectations for all barley wines, American and English. And has really opened my eyes to what can be done to develop the flavor of beer in general. Good job J.W. :)"
"Absolutely one of the best beers I've tried."
"I like scotch whiskey and I like beer; apparently I do not like scotch in my beer (or beer in my scotch). This beer was horrid. It looke good, a glistening khaki colored beer with a thin white head. It al went down hill from there. The smell was an overpowering whiskey, but not a crisp whiskey, but a muddled, milky bready smell. The flavors were overpoweringly of whiskey - the booze would not let the quality english malts to even approach the tongue. It did have a quality mouthfeel. I enjoy english bw and the full malt profile, unfortunatley, this one could not overcome the booze flavors. I have several other of this line (calvados, port, etc). Ihope they don't all stink."
"I really didn't care for the sweetness of this beer. I am hoping a few years in the cellar helps it out, but I will pass on another bottle anytime soon."
"A real treat to enjoy about 1/2 of a pint of this fine sipper from a ""wodden pin"" (mini keg) with a gravity pour at the Blind Tiger in lower NYC. Pours dark dark brown, very cloudy, no carbonation nor lacing to be found. Nose is of whisky. Notes of ripe plums and more whiskey on the palate.Also smoky notes picked up, hints of salami and soggy raisins and figs. Fine, fine brew, strong, rich flavors and quite complex and interesting. Depth of flavors is outstanding. Each sip is intriguing. Long wiskey infused finish. Outstanding."
"Addendum: As I approach the bottom of the glass, it has become apparent that the sugary-sweetness of this beer has taken away from the taste and drinkability, as it has become cloying to the point of detriment. This beer could definitely benefit from many years of aging."
"Thankfully, I purchased more than just a single bottle of this offering, and look forward to enjoying these down the road with a little age on it. I'll be sure to try Port, Sherry, and Calvados versio-- OWW!! I just got bit by a BEE!!!"
"This beer by JW Lee is really one of the best that I've ever had. The lagavulin cask aging adds a tremendous flavour to the English barley wine base and makes for an amazing drinking experience. Very highly recommended. My current favourite beer, and honestly, when it's available, I often think twice about buying a bottle of actual Lagavulin in place of 9 bottles of this stuff...it's really that good."
" The mouthfeel is smooth, with light carbonation and a moderate level of syrupy sweetness. I could easily drink more than five of these in a sitting. I will cellar some of these to go along with my regular Harvest Ales dating back to 1998."
"This is a tremendous beer. I just drank my only bottle so now I'm going to have to see if someone will trade up with me for some more that I can age. I highly recommend this beer."
"drink: I dont like this category or really know what it means. Its 11.5% ABV, no one can drink a lot of it. Not to mention the intense sugar and flavors prohibits mass consumption. But it wasnt intended as a session beer, thats obvious. Theres a reason the bottle is only 9.3 oz. I cant forget however that its 9 bucks a bottle!!! Does that hurt its drinkability? Of course, and my wallet. So whats the rating? Would I want to enjoy this spectacular brew after a meal or with some cheese, nuts, or desert? Any time, any day. Is it so rich that I would actually prefer to split the bottle with someone? Yes. Is that a bad thing? Hell no. So what rating do I give?"
"9.3 ounce bottle. Purchased at Wine Warehouse in Charlottesville, VA for $7.75."
"D-This is a great Barley Wine. It has good complexity but the flavors are not overpowering. Very light for a huge, high ABV drink. Age and Lagavulin casks have done some amazing things to this beer."
"After its repudiation of the 275ml brown bottle, it takes up a short-lived residence in my glass a slightly hazy deep brownish-amber color with an appreciable creamy head that slowly erodes leaving a tight skirt of lace to conceal the glass. Oh my what a nose, where does one start with the honey sweetness or with the unmistakable Lagavulin Whiskey aromas, how about the smoked peat, meaty and fruity what a treat for the senses, start is thickly sweet, nicely malted, the top light to moderate in feel. Finish is gentle in its acidity, the hops pushed aside by the oak and whiskey flavors, dry aftertaste that coats the palate and the noticeable tummy warming adds much to the enjoyment of this ne plus ultra creation of the brewers art."
"The unmistakable, powerful, peat-smoked and salty Islay aroma of the Lagavulin comes through clearly in the nose, and it only gets better from there! It pours a clear (it's been filtered), medium-amber body with a full head of frothy white that drops slowly but leaves little lace. It's creamy and smooth in the mouth with a restrained, fine-bubbled carbonation and full body. The flavor includes a good shot of the Lagavulin as well, and its smokiness and alcohol help to balance and dry the rich, buttered, creamed-honey maltiness... even better, I think, than even the original. It seems lighter, although it's not, because it's more balanced. Yet the intensity of the honeyish Maris Otter malt is still there. And unlike the other versions, the alcohol in this one seems more hidden... hmmm? It's a really interesting take on the already great Harvest Ale! And doubly so for fans of Islay whiskey."
"Alcohol hidden so well it should be carrying a conceal weapon permit. I found even a couple sips overwhelming. I think I'd rather have just a splash in a snifter as the cap of a large meal."
"Just a tight circle of carbonation around the edge. Copper, light ruby hue, crystal clear. Little drizzles of bubbles making their way up. Whisky sweetness present in bouquet, and a good deal of floral notes as well. On the mouth, there is no questioning the whisky presence, as well as some peatiness, smoked character. Very smooth, with the whisky scents remaining in the mouth and nostrils afterwards. Wouldnt have minded if this had been packaged as 12 ozs., but even the small size had the back of my skull tingling. Reminded me of the quote the father said in 28 Days Later  Takes out the fire, but leaves in the warmth."
"Drinkability: This was a great beer, I would love to have regular access to."
"Clear orange, a shade darker than the others apparently, not much head, but at least it tries. Deeply peaty aroma. Finally one of those BA JW Lees lets some uniqueness of character shines through. The vegetal tones Ive met in the others is there as well, but more subdued amongst the smooth earthy scotch-like profile. Sweet leather and almost cheesy hints adds to the richness. More leather and caramel on the tongue. Very earthy and peaty, smoky even with plenty of iodine medicinal character. Like the others, it remains very syrupy, oily and alcoholic, though perhaps not as stale. Flavourful beer without a doubt."
"Pours out amber with about an inch and a half of off white head. It shrinks down but manages to keep a small head through the consumption of this brew. Scatterings of lace were left as well on the glass. Strong smells of smoke rise from the glass accompanied by a malty sweetness and a bit of a woody scent. The alcohol and smoke really start to stand out as this warms. Taste is similar to the aroma as the smokiness and sweetness make up the majority of the flavor. There are notes of alcohol as well, this is quite the warming brew good for a cold rainy day. The sweetness is not cloying here like some of the other cask JWs. Aftertaste is sweet with a slight bite of alcohol. Mouthfeel is syrupy and full. Drinkability was pretty good at first but once it warmed the smokiness and the alcohol were a bit too much. Overall a good brew though."
"I was very happy with the texture and thickness of the beer, but was disappointed by the lack of complexity in the flavor. The smoke was there, but unlike the scotch it wasn't peaty in the sense that the planty and woody flavors weren't mixed in with the smoke. Ultimately the beer manages to get across a Lagavulin feel if not actually the flavor. The achohol taste takes a backseat to the ale flavor, which keeps the beer very drinkable even at 11.5%."
"I was expecting more whiskey in the nose and the flavor here, but this lightly carbonated, sweet honey-colored brew uses the whiskey as more of a note than a blare. The alcohol aroma could easily be coming from the beers own substantial ABV. Honey, sweet caramel malt and alcohol dominate the aroma and flavor with a bit of a clean bitterness finishing up the flavor."
"Edit: As it warmed even further toward RT, smoke and alcohol became much more intense, severely affecting the mouthfeel and drinkability at that point."
"Bound to turn many off, just as Lagavulin scotch turns many off. I only caution, don't dismiss the aging potential of either."
"Drinkability: Mmmm. I am quickly coming to the conclusion that J.W. Lees is the Dogfish analogue for the UK. They're creative, adventurous, and put out consistently high quality beer."
"Utterly repulsive."
"The beer is quite fruity, with notes of concentrated apple, and perhaps a hint of apricot as well. You can taste the alcohol in the finish as well as a bit of tannin, which is probably from the cask conditioning. If I had to guess, I would say that the Scotch adds a heartiness to this beer that compliments it quite well. I really wish I had been able to get more of these so I could age a few and see how they change over time. This is a very well integrated strong ale, just incredibly malty with a nice kiss of hops."
"Poured an almost gold color with a very small head. Aroma of light smokiness and believe it or not, Lavavulin. The taste was like other JW Lees Harvests with the same smokiness of the aroma, in the taste. Warm and smooth. I had to try it alongside the scotch, as I have a bottle on hand. Although young, worth drinking now and once matured. A true gem."
"Okay, being a single malt scotch fan, I just had to break down and try this one despite the sticker shock. I am a particular fan of the Islay Island style of scotch like Lagavulin. This small bottle poured an amber gold color, forming a nice small foamy off white heat that coated the glass with lace as it slowly sudsided. A heavy, slow moving stream of bubbles was the carbonated lure of this one. An aroma of malt, some caramel and the elements that could only be the Lagavulin, but I do not know if it would be detectable by non scotch drinkers. It would definately still be seen as a wiskey aroma. The flavor was of malt, caramel and scotch wiskey. A cramy sweet finish with a warming feel of the alcohol that is definately present in this one. This one would no doubt be better with age."
"Backwash: This expression is certainly primus inter pares amongst the special offerings. In fact, its such a good combination, that I might take a page from Drewbage1847's book and start adding a little whisky to most of my future Harvest Ales. Like the marriage of Port and stout, this one is a real winner. I think Id buy the mixed case of these if I could substitute 3 more Lagavulins for the Calvados. Aged versions of this are likely to provide some serious fireworks."
