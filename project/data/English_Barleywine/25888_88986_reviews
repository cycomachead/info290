"A good representation of an English barleywine. So many barleywines are now the American version and heavily hopped. This was a nice sweet, malty English version through and through."

"From a 750 ml bottle, this beer is a rich brown color with a nice tan head.  Woody scents...heavy on malt and alcohol.  Low on fruit scents, but very earthy.  The taste is intense, but pleasant.  Warming and stong.  Not overly sweet. Not has a sweet spice flavor.  Full mouthfeel.  Great barley wine."
""
"This is another case of a beer that grew on me.  Will definitely have to try this again and expect my rating might rise.  Or maybe the fact ""the next batch is always worse"" will balance that out."

"Poured into a Fremont small snifter. Pours a very dark mahogany brown, appearing nearly opaque black in the glass with a thick khaki cap that dissipates to thin patches with little lacing. Aroma of caramel malt, fresh and dried dark fruit, particularly plums and raisins, concord grape, fruitier than expected for this style, but pleasant. Flavor is similar, dominated by plums, raisins, dates, currents; light red wine notes of oak tannin, caramel malt, earthy. Medium to heavy bodied with light carbonation. Not an American barleywine (little hops) and not a traditional English one either, with more of a dark fruit profile rather than caramel malt. A nice change of pace flavor for a barleywine. Well integrated flavors and moderately complex. Nicely made and different. Each taste surprises me with the fruit flavors, which I'm still not expecting from what is clearly a barleywine. ABV well covered, but this is warming. The carbonation is a bit weak, and that is the only flaw I found in this. I'm hoping to find a second bottle for ageing, since this has such an interesting flavor; usually the malt is the dominating flavor change in aged barleywines, here it will be the other flavors. Intriguing."

"One of the best barley wines I have had in a while, and easily one of the ten best made in the U.S. that I have ever tried. This is one of my favorite styles, one that I enjoyed often when living in Britain. I feel many craft breweries lose the essence of this style looking for innovation, whereas this brew strikes a perfect balance between ambition and tradition. A really satisfying barley wine."

"O: Enjoyable but missing that little something to make it outstanding."

"Pours a hazy reddish-brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, caramel, toffee, and honey aromas. Taste is much the same with toast, caramel, and toffee flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of earth bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with nice caramel, toffee, and honey qualities all around."

"Poured a dark brown body with lace patches stuck to the glass on top of an aroma that is figs and dark fruit along with touches of bourbon and wood, along with some sweetness. The beer is thick/full but smooth and easy to drink thanks to some oakiness (body is chewy at times), and has a real good sweet edge thanks to vanilla/caramel taste notes and possible dark fruits along with figs. I have a sweet tooth and this beer seemed to hit it often and this was complemented by a slightly hot boozy finish. A very enjoyable barleywine."

"Pours mildly translucent. Nice tan head. Very malt-thick nose. Raisin and a mild maple thing is on there also. Seems a bit boozy also, unfortunately. Flavor is pretty decent. Kind of seems a bit too clogged with a mild boozy edge and a whole lot of malty sweetness. A shame really as it exhibits a lot of characteristics you want to see for the style. After 16 months I wouldn't imagine it to be like this though. Maybe it's just not a good barleywine for aging."

"O - To me, the beer is a bit overly sweet. Not something I'd normally go after."

"Quite a neat take on a barleywine and drinks very nicely to match and easily. Great solid brew from these guys."

"Overall (4.0 / 4.0), a really solid barleywine that, if I had my choice, I would drink with about a year on it. I like the added sweetness and the fact that the booze has blended in to create a more cohesive beer. Both are great though--I would encourage anyone who has the opportunity to try them side-by-side. Having tried them both, I will definitely be sitting on my 2013 for a year or so."
"Overall - This would do well in a barrel. Sugar bomb."

"This is a great-off-the shelf Barlywine, a definite go-to for me in the future. It's a bit out of the ordinary for a BWine, but it still nice and refreshing."
"rock solid barleywine ale here, pouring a decadent toffee amber color and sporting over an inch of yellowish fluff. the nose on this is all brown sugar and maple syrup, one sugar layer cuts through the next, deep and rich for sure, with all the grain in your face you could ever want, fresh and strong, wintery, sexy. the flavor is similarly robustly flavored, with more molasses this time around, even honey, i taste a million sweeteners without a ton of residual sugar, tough to do, and in this case done beautifully. the grains are fresh and anywhere from lightly toasted to close to burnt, its also got a strange but enjoyable candied orange peel flavor towards the finish before the booze comes in. i like to taste the alcohol just a bit in my barleywine, and this one has that aspect dialed. long rich finish cleaned away by alcohol. huge body this is a slow sipper, but it improves with warmth so no rush. perennial can do no wrong right now."

"Very nice beer from this ""new to me"" brewery. Thanks Casey!"

"D: This was a great English barleywine, with solid scent and taste, and an excellent body. The finish was smooth, but it was a little hot, so it was better to sip. Age may help mellow. Very nice brew, but pricey."

"O - This is really good. Another high quality brew from Perennial."

"Overall, nice strong brew."

"Very tasty and definitely comparable to many of the old school English Barleywines, no many beer get ""better"" with age ... most just evolve. My guess is that this will do both though it is great to drink right now as well."
""
""
"O: This is interesting, but I'd prefer it to be a little less sweet. As it is, the sweetness clashes with the peatiness a little bit."

"O: 1st offering by Perennial, and this one was just simply weird for its denoted style. i really picked up on a ton of nuts and smokiness in this one which I was never expecting. However, it it is labeled a Winter Ale, so the play on the season is definitely in full effect. I just dont think it is that well balanced for its style."

"Overall-- this is tasty enough to drink another. Part of me wanted to not like this beer... But to be honest, this is worthy of a try. It isn't nearly my favorite English barleywine, but it is a more than acceptable effort."
