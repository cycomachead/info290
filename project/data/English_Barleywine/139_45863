3.56,-2.5,,,,,,"Bottle. This was several years old when I tried it. Poured a ruddy, dark brown with a minimal head. It has clearly oxidized; raisins are huge in the nose. Brown sugar sweetness. The flavor has eaten the alcohol effectively. Just a soft rap of booze. The flavor is very raisiny. Dark fruits and brown sugar. A slight fruity tartness. Body is surprisingly light. Carbonation has clearly fallen off a bit but the softness works here. Pretty cool, after I'd say over five years of age.","VelvetExtract","Oct 23, 2014"

4.42,21.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"OVERALL: This might better be described as an American strong ale, as the chocolate and leather qualities aren't really appropriate to the barleywine style. Either way, whatever you want to call it, this is top notch stuff. At this point in its expired life, it’s very flavorful, well integrated, smooth, complex and enjoyable. The bomber emptied far too quickly. Well balanced between sweet caramel flavors and dark malt character, making this one to pick apart and savor. Glad I got to drink this at this point in its life. Really enjoyed it.","Jeffo","Oct 16, 2014"

Rich amber color, almost copper in hue with a nice touch of cloudiness to it that really gave it a very thick look, nearly opaque at times. No real head though, and it almost looked flat at first pour, not really encouraged right off the bat. The aroma was rich and sweet. Nice notes of bready malts, hints of almost honey like notes and a nice fruit touch toward the finish. The flavor though really perked me up a bit. Sweet, mellow, with all notes of ABV long gone by the wayside. Lots of biscuit like notes, a touch of faded hops and a load of grain all combined to really give quite a nice show overall. Very impressed here with the way it tasted, especially in the finish, which was again very sweet, and nearly perfectly placed.

The retention was unimpressive and the lacing was spotty. The aroma was malty, alcoholic and dry with hints of wood, similar to a barrel-aged whiskey in ways The flavors were bold and similar to the aroma though with better complexity. Right from the start I could taste the 8.% ALC, but as this faded off my tongue I got the dark bready malts elements then the bittering hops followed by a long chocolate malt finish that lingered forever. A jolt at first, but I grew fonder of it as I imbibed. As it warmed I smelled more caramel malt and tasted more of it too. The flavors were very roasty and not really what I think of when I think barley wine. I did enjoy the coffee and slightly spicy notes though.

Goes down very smoothly and even on this hot summer day, is very refreshing for the style. The alcohol is subdued, which is a welcome attribute as barley wines tend to be a bit too heavy on the alcohol. I realize that high APV% is indicative to this style of beer, but I think too many go a bit too far with it at the expense of drinkability. I appreciate beers like Dogfishhead's Olde School with it's 15% APV, but this is a barley-wine that can be appreciated in the warm weather as well as in winter.

The malt, sweet and fruit tones are quite subdued, almost watered down. Alcohol is not strong, drinkability would be quite high if not for the bitter tinge. Lighter bodied than standard.

It has a nice bitterness is enjoyable, unfortunately this beer is full of funky chemical notes that makes it less than convincing and it also has the same sour flavour that I found in the aroma.

It was quite odd to smell these aromas in a Barleywine. The taste was a mix of astringent and roasty flavors, followed by a caramel finish which was again way out of place for the style. The beer also lacked much sweetness, which is what I thought English Barleywines were all about. I feel a little bad rating it this low on the taste,, as I liked the flavors.

Roasty malt, again earthy and wooden. The chocolate really comes through as it warms. There is a resiny bite, but it comes off more like part of a barrel-aged character.

1.95,-46.6,3,3,1.5,1.5,1.5,"Pours flat and black with no head into my Unibroue Trois Pistoles goblet. Grape jelly aroma. Raiseny and port like, too. It's like dark fruit but somehow off. A very strange, bitter taste. Not at all pleasant. I'm wondering if this is a bad beer, yet I press on. Metallic and bitter and a mouthfeel that is simply unpleasant. This beer is a disaster from beginning to end. I have to assume it was spoiled. Down the drain it went. If I ever come accross this brew again, I'll give it another chance if it's free. Otherwise, avoid this mess at all costs.","jim102864","Feb 08, 2009"
3.5,-4.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours on the darker side for a barley wine, a dark, murky mahogoney with a short head to start that fades to nothing. Smells sweet, grainy, roasty and with some piney and earthy hops. There is also a residual yeast smell that smells typically English. A bit roasty for a barley wine, but fine. The taste is less roasty, but quite a bit more hoppy with piney, earthy, and citrusy hops combined with more roastiness, some dark fruit, and quite a bit of lingering bitterness. Smooth, and somewhat thick in the mouth. Thisn wasn't bad, but it didn't really represent the barley wine style that well. I don't mind the extra hops in a barley wine, but I do want some extra sweetness to go with it, and the extra roastiness was a bit out of place. Still, it was enjoyable enough if not remarkable.","Georgiabeer","Feb 02, 2009"
3.68,0.8,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 3/4"" tan head over the clear burgundy brown brew. Dense head lasts well, with heavy sticking lace. Aroma is heavy on malt, plenty of dark fruits. Taste is malty sweet upfont, with roastiness appreciated, slightly tart fruitiness in the middle, light bitter close. Mouthfeel is smooth, and drinkability is alright. The parts just don't come together as well as I would like.","ppoitras","Jan 26, 2009"
3.41,-6.6,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Drinkability: It just never comes together to leave me saying ""man, that was some barleywine!"" I'll politely say it's an acceptable barleywine. Don't wanna start the new week being a Grouch Bug, y'know.","ChainGangGuy","Jan 26, 2009"

3.45,-5.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,2.5,"This one, sad to say, isn't for me. It rolls like a strong-ish brown ale but it's not a barleywine to me. Although not entirely unpleasant, not what we're looking for.","IBUnit63","Jan 13, 2009"
3.45,-5.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Courtesy of fishingnet, thanks Ben. Pours dark brown with garnet edges and dark tan head. The aroma is roasty malts coupled with mild buttery bread. The taste is full on roasted malts from moderate roast, nutty malts and to highly roasted malts. Behind those notes is a level of buttered bread. Nice English interpretation except possibly missing any form of dark fruitiness. One of the most easily sessionable barleywines I have to date. It seems more like an American Strong Ale.","BigMcLargeHuge","Jan 09, 2009"

4.3,17.8,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"This is a creamy beer. It has many of the elements of a superior English Porter. There's a dark chocolate with cherry flavor that has some notes from a barley wine. Still, this is a strong departure from the style. And I like it. I find it very drinkable without too much alcohol.","smcolw","Dec 25, 2008"
3.85,5.5,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Mouthfeel is semi-full and the beer is generally semi-dry. The alcohol definitely emerges and leaves that peppery feel in the late finish. It's okay, but I will never pay that much money for it again.","BretSikkink","Dec 20, 2008"
2.75,-24.7,3.5,3.5,2,3,3,"Pours a really dark brown with ruby highlights when held to the light. Smallish off white head disappears quickly. Smells of chocolate, butter, caramel, toffee. Taste is chocolaty buttery hoppy. Leaves a bitter/astringent taste in my mouth. Body is medium to thin the beer finishes dry. Mouthfeel is oily, carbonation is light. I tried to enjoy this, but I could not. The color is too dark for the style, the flavor profile is all wrong. The astringent taste ruined this one for me. At 1o bucks a bottle never again!","johnnnniee","Dec 20, 2008"
3.93,7.7,4.5,4,4,4,3.5,"22oz bomber from the local Hannaford. Pours a nearly opaque very dark brown with nearly an inch of light tan head that leaves some impressive lacing. Caramel, toffee, chocolate, butterscotch... Chocolate, coffee, caramel, toffee characterize the flavor. Hints of butter here and there, but diacetyl was impressively subdued. On the upper side of medium-bodied with moderate carbonation. Not bad, a solid example of an English Barleywine for sure, being more of a malt bomb with hops playing second fiddle as it were. Not sure it was worth the price - maybe it was... However this has to be about the best Shipyard I have ever tried. Way to go Shipyard!","MrHurmateeowish","Dec 17, 2008"
2.42,-33.7,4,2,2.5,2,2.5,"Poured a deep, deep brown with a reddish tint, light brown head, good carbonation.Nose is umm..off. No real smell to it I thought. Taste was of cocoa powder, roasted malts and a rather obnoxious astringent feel. Mouthfeel is thinner bodied than I wanted. English bwine? I did not see it nor taste it. Alcohol was well hidden but I expected more, heavier, maltier and thicker.","barleywinefiend","Dec 12, 2008"

2.16,-40.8,4,3,1.5,3,1.5,"The aroma is quite hoppy in a grassy way with caramel malt and somewhat chemical. The appearance is dark amber with a nice foamy head. The taste is like the aroma which means it's not good. It's very bitter, grassy, and chemical. There is a little sweet malt but the taste is just bad. The palate is OK for the style and quite smooth. Overall I really don't like this one.","nick76","Dec 02, 2008"
3.18,-12.9,4,3.5,3,3,3,"Starts out promising but I feel that this falls flat in the drinkability department. It may need some aging but I'm troubled by the alcohol heat that just seems to crowd out other flavors. Average at best.","Brad007","Nov 28, 2008"

4,9.6,4,4,4,4,4,"I bought this and the Imperial Porter at Tully's in Wells for $10.50 each. This was the first one I tried, and thought the beer was pretty good. Served in a snifter, the beer was a dark red/brown color with a medium-sized, quickly dissipating, tan head. The aroma was predominately of dark fruit, with a little malt presence. The taste was cherry and raisin, malt first, then some hops. The label said a dry finish, and I would agree. I thought this was a good example of an English barleywine, and would drink it again.","lordofthewiens","Nov 15, 2008"
