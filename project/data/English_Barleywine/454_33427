Easy sipper - the complexities open up as this warms. I feel that with a further year on this it would be even better. Lots of sugar and dried fruit/candied fruit elements here that I would be interested to stack up in a year or so.","Barnoloid","Jan 04, 2015"

I enjoy the insane amount of malt flavor, the slight tanginess, and the warmth in my belly from this one. The feel could maybe use a little work, but the amount of sweetness is spot on -- any more and this beer would be cloying. I'd be very interested in buying another one and cellaring it for about five years or so. The only real flaw I have with this brew is that it could use some more flavor depth... I could find that in the BBA version if I could get my hands on it. Try this one out.","Alextricity","Jan 30, 2014"

4.01,5.2,3.5,4.25,4,3.75,4,"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was its robustness of flavoring. This of course, as we set out to discover, was vastly different across the years of the vintage. The freshest edition was a bit harsh, giving nothing big enough for the booze to hide behind. It came out swinging, mixing with bright chemical phenols, cloying sugars, and plastics, for a curiously imbalanced sip. This improved a great deal with warmth, however, allowing for the inherent sugariness of the malts shine through strongly enough to break the cycle. That said, the 2010 vintage was vastly superior from the first sip and then after. It started with the desired blend, with the booze, actually, hardly noticeable at times. The fruit, malts, and muskiness of it remained clean, and was a single entity by the end. This was an exciting, revealing experience, and it certainly helped us to refine our opinions about cellaring vs. drinking fresh. So, based on our experiment here, we recommend that you sit on the fresh Cereal Killer you have, so as to allow it to calm and blend enough for all of its components, nooks, and crannies to click.","TheBrewo","Aug 25, 2013"

4,5,4,4,4,4,4,"22 ounce bottle into snifter; 3 year cellar aged version released this year, making it a 2010 vintage. Pours lightly hazy dark ruby red color with a small dense cream colored head with decent retention, that reduces to a thin lace cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing on the glass. Aromas of big raisin, fig, apple, caramel, molasses, toast, sherry, brown sugar, light chocolate, light pepper, and earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt/fruity notes; very sweet, but not offensively so. Taste of raisin, fig, apple, caramel, molasses, toast, sherry, brown sugar, light chocolate, light pepper, and earthiness. Lingering notes of dark fruits, caramel, molasses, toast, brown sugar, sherry, light chocolate, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very good balance and complexity of malt and fruity notes; with no cloying sweetness present after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and full bodied; with a creamy and slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice English Barleywine. All around nice balance and complexity of malt and fruity flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Apr 19, 2013"

Arcadia Ales is certainly one brand that stands a bit taller and this beer contributes to their stature.It pours a beautiful reddish brown,with only a small amount of lace. The smell is rather complex and should take a couple whiffs to fully appreciate. There are the usual toffee smells, but also subtle hints of cereal. The taste is sublime, having a mellow sweetness balanced with the aged flavor natural to this type of beer. It then finishes with a touch of bittersweet thickness. Good beer and a good example of the Barleywine Style.","jmendels","Apr 16, 2013"

4,5,4,4,4,4,4,"12 ounce bottle, 2010 vintage. Served in a snifter, the beer pours a murky mahogany brown color with about an inch tan head that sticked around a little while. There's also a good amount of lacing. Aroma is nice, it smells like brown sugar, caramel, toffee, dark fruit (raisins, plums) and bready malt. The taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also the addition of some sherry and a bit of sweet spice. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's coating and a bit creamy with moderate carbonation. I think it's a good overall brew, I'd buy this again in the future and probably age it longer next time.","bluejacket74","0"

It does all the things a barleywine should do, and it does them well; and, it also avoids going beyond the style. It focuses squarely on malt flavors of sweetness, toasted grains, and just a bit of dark fruit along with some yeast. Most of all, everything remains subtle and smooth and blends together well. This is a first class barleywine that is definitely in the top tier of selection available in this style.","Beer_Runner","Oct 27, 2012"

The smell is rich in caramel and dark fruit. Raisins, figs, dried cherries...all present. However, I find it a bit of an odd scent for this style. Maybe it's just me, but I find it to be unique in a little bit of an offputting fashion. The taste resonates with the nose, following quickly in it's footsteps. More raisins (lots), figs, even dates. This is a strange bird. Perhaps when you've been drinking the likes of Abacus, Commander, King Henry, and Bligh's recently, this is destined to seem a bit more ordinary. This is a decent enough beer, however, and I really need to revisit it when I haven't been on a binge of big barley wines. The mouthfeel is on the sweet side. Real sweet. All of those fruits are like...candy. There's a slight tinge of booziness in the finish towards the back of your throat, but all in all the ABV is hidden pretty masterfully. This is a good barleywine. On the grand scheme of things, I consider it average only because of what else I've had. However, if you've never had Patron Anejo, then I can see where 1800 comes across as a decent enough tequila. I'd like to revisit this when I'm not as biased towards some of the premium offerings.","Retail1LO","Jan 13, 2012"

This beer has pretty good drinkability for a Barleywine, it's not too boozy or too bitter, I should have no problem drinking the rest of this bottle. What I liked most about this beer was the taste, It had all the nice flavors I expect out of a malt forward Barleywine and the raisin flavor really stuck out which I liked, the mouthfeel was pretty good also. What I liked least about this beer was the aroma, it wasn't bad it was just very sweet and somewhat similar to a sweet sherry and the head was pretty lackluster. I would pick up a bottle of this again when in the mood for a good malty Barleywine, but for the price I think I will just get a single bottle and stay away from the four packs, I wish it was a little cheaper. I would recommend this this beer to people who like malt forward Barleywines, it does a good job at showcasing some great malty flavors. I was pretty happy with this beer, it was pretty straight forward and it didn't have any off flavors, it was solid. Arcadia did a good job with this beer and I think it would get even better after another year, I also think this would make a great candidate for barrel aging, I think the flavors of the beer would go great with some bourbon or rum barrels.","StoutHunter","Beers"

Nice notes of bready malts, hints of almost honey like notes and a nice fruit touch toward the finish. The flavor though really perked me up a bit. Sweet, mellow, with all notes of ABV long gone by the wayside. Lots of biscuit like notes, a touch of faded hops and a load of grain all combined to really give quite a nice show overall. Very impressed here with the way it tasted, especially in the finish, which was again very sweet, and nearly perfectly placed.

This one I poured in to a weiss glass (not the right style, but whatever). Color is definitely good, it is a light cherry toward the bottom, and gets darker towards the top of the glass. Almost immediately upon pouring I could smell it from a few feet away. Dark fruits such as cherry and berry strike me first, along with some chocolate and alcohol. Honey manages to creep its way in as well....reminds me a bit of a cherry cordial. Taste is very sweet, and not afraid to flex it's alcohol strength. I get some honey and fruit nectar, and a tiny amount of molasses or caramel in the finish. Body is big, viscous and in your face. Drinkability is nice, however be warned that this is a sipping beer for sure that should probably be paired with food. I have only had four or five sips from my glass, and can already feel the strength of this beer. I like this Barleywine.

It's called and English BW and that fits, some. Of course, it could also be an American BW and that would fit some. The problem is that it isn't either of those. It's too sweet and syrupy (not that it's sweet and syrupy) to be American and too hoppy and bitter (not that it's hoppy and bitter) to be English. All things considered, it's probably better off in English because of the aroma and the near syrupy sweetness. I'd like it more less sweet and more bitter. Um. More American.

3.65,-4.2,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Appears a semi-clouded blood orange juice tone with a nicely formed organic brown egg hued head leaves behind thin scattered specks of lacing. Aroma has a deep tart tone with vinous grapes, raisins, with caramel tinged alcohol notes in there as well. Mild earthy tone hints of brandy with a mild herbal woody hop aroma. Flavor is big and malty like most b-wines not overly sweet with a lot of tartness here big raisin, plum soaked in alcohol notes a bit of earthy bark tones with more herbal hops quite the mellow sipping barleywine. Mouthfeel is in the medium to fuller bodied range with moderate easy going carbonation with a syrupy texture that becomes a bit cloying after a whole bomber. Drinkability is on a I'm one and I'm done basis, I need to move on after one of these big brews.","WVbeergeek","Jan 20, 2007"
3.9,2.4,4,4,4,4,3.5,"Comments - Could be evened out a bit more with hops, although I do enjoy sweeter barley wines. Its worth a try, but not something to go out of your way to find.","Jmamay22","Jan 16, 2007"
3.68,-3.4,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"This beer has a very dark mahogany hue to it. Nice big head that eventually fades a lot, but little laces are still present. Big huge predominant fruity nose. Taste is of once again a huge fruit attack (grapes, plums, apples), with a bit of alcohol and a smige of hops at the end. Mouthfeel and drinkability are good. I think this beer is alright, but its too in your face fruit action going on...I wanted some more caramel to come through...possibly with some aging this beer can improve. But as for right now I most likely won't pick this up again in the near future.","RobertDwight","Jan 15, 2007"

4,5,4,4,4,4,4,"Cereal Killer is an excellent barleywine, it is pricy, but you do get what yo pay for. Pours a hazy deep dark amber with reddish streaks shinning through from the light striking through. the aroma is very malty, carmelized malt, slight hint of alcohol. the flavor is very rich and malty, carmelized malt, hopsack, spicy, mineral after-taste. this is a great beer, give it a try.","plaztikjezuz","Jan 06, 2007"
4.15,8.9,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Good appearance. Bloodied mahogany. Thick beige head dissipates quickly and leaves little lace behind. Nice aroma of plums, dates, pineapple, caramel malts, and other tropical fruits. Nice viscous feel in the mouth. Full bodied and adequately carbonated. First impressions are of rich malts, fruits and alcohol. Really a pretty nice combo overall. Tropical sensations mix with caramel malts. One of the better Arcadia brews I've had.","Bighuge","Jan 05, 2007"

3.93,3.1,4.5,4,4,4,3.5,"This beer just came with a great presentation. The colour is something short of purple with a rich redness bleeding out at the edges. The most astonishing feature is the hearty and steadfast head that perches itself atop the glory below. I am generally unaccustomed to seeing such a resilient head on brews of this nature. Nicely coloured in a shade of tan. There are a few streamers of lace left hanging as the consumption activities commence. The nose is commendable in its lack of rotting overtones. As always with my particular nose, I smell appleskins right off the top. Chalky yeast behind it. Dark fruit, black cherry, caramel apple, candy, and a little a little booze float around as well. Way more pungent as it warms up in my sweaty little mit. The taste is, most notably to me, quite sour on the first impression. A fair bit of sweetness to her also. Makes me think much of cherries and caramel. This is dangerously close to reaching the no no land of cloy. It might be. I haven't yet decided. The mouthfeel is slick but sticky. There is a trail left behind as this brew slides down the hatch. This trail provides seconds of additional enjoyment on every sip. Very nice. The drinkability might be slipping now as I am starting to dwell on whether this thing is starting to get its cloy on. The first pint is gone. What will the rest reveal? After pouring the second glass, which has been exposed to ambient temperature for the duration of the first glass, the taste seems quite easy to deal with again. This is a pretty solid brew. It is quite rich. I don't think serial glasses of this are indicated. The aftertaste gets to be a bit overwhelming. Split this bomber and things should go smoothly. Besides, that would be most advocatory of you. This is surely a one cup affair. A pretty good one at that.","SupaCelt","Dec 10, 2006"
3.38,-11.3,4,3.5,3.5,3,3,"Poured into a chalice. Color is deep mahogany with an awesome looking billowy tan head that dissipates slowly as the glass sits for a while. Smells sweet like brown sugar or bubblegum, which may be the alcohol - there's also some citrus here. Very nice scent - intriguing. Tastes like a lemon flavored bubblegum and finishes sour with slight bitterness. Mouthfeel is Ok, but nothing spectacular - it is a little harsh, but again could be the alcohol. By no means is this a poor beer, actually, it's one of the better Arcadia offerings not quite as good as Hopmouth. Worth a shot.","montageman","Beers"

4.32,13.4,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Pours a rich mahogany with a substantial head for a beer of this strength. An amazing aroma of cantaloupe and malt. Very nuanced flavor with some esters, thick malt with a support of alcohol. Some fine hop bitterness that shows up at the end, with just a bit of slickness. Full bodied and assertive; I poured half a bomber into a glass, that's about enough for one sitting.","CH3CH2OH","Dec 07, 2006"
4.03,5.8,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Tried Arcadia's Big Dick's Olde Ale and this back-to-back. This beer is the better of the two, however, like the former beer there isn't much distinctive character. I would recommend this beer however.","BelgianAleSlut","Dec 06, 2006"
3.53,-7.3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Cola brown edges around a reddish body. Small, ringy, light khaki head. Mild aroma of caramel, pears, tropical fruit, and herbal hops. Sweet brown sugar and buttery malt up front. Toasted, caramelized edge to it. Stays sweet throughout. Candy apple. Alcohol is noticeable and a bit hot. Slightly astringent hop finish is no match for the sweetness and the heatness. Medium-bodied, with a mellow, flat feel. A very malty sweet, buttery, warming barley wine that gets better as it warms.","alexgash","Dec 04, 2006"
3.84,0.8,4.5,3,4,4.5,4,"Ok, so this is not quite the cereal that one might expect to pour in their bowl(glass) for a Barleywine, but as an example of the English style, and not the American, which I favor, this is quite solid. Malty rich and favorable for malt lovers alike. Too bad the aroma did nearly nothing for me.","tavernjef","Dec 04, 2006"
3.63,-4.7,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Pours a ruddy cola brown to dark copper and amber, somewhat murky/cloudy, with a one finger light tan head. Aroma is ripe fruitiness, ripe berries and some alcohol , also some raisiny and caramel aroma. Flavor shows more ripe berry and prune flavor mixed with a sweet malty and caramel breadiness, cereal, followed by a good dose of alcohol mixed with a decent amount of hop bitterness. Medium in body, somewhat sticky sweet although it seems to thin as it sits in the glass, a peppery spiciness cuts the body along with an alcohol and hop dryness in the finish. Nice beer, maybe somewhat hoppy for an english example of a bw, definitely belongs in the big beer series, alcohol is very present throughout.","hoppymeal","Dec 02, 2006"
4.6,20.7,4,4,5,4,5,"This beer pours a dark amber color with a tall head that falls quickly and leaves some lacing on the glass. The aroma is very malty with not much hoppiness. Also some caramel, some toffee. Nice. The flavor is very malty with quite a bit of bitterness, but not much hop flavor. This beer is right up my alley. Lots of caramel and toffee flavors make this very enjoyable. The alcohol is very well hidden by the malt sweetness and it drinks very well. The body is moderate. This has to be one of the better barleywines I've had in a long time.","clvand0","Nov 20, 2006"
