"Overall: This is a very tasty barley wine, I think that it could have stayed in the cellar for another year or two. However, the beer presents well on the palate and very drinkable. A good English Barleywine."

"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, strong kick, good representation of style, although there are better alternatives in the style, this is a solid stronger beer to drink for a while."

"I tried this fresh and thought it was a bit hot so I held on to a couple of bottles to see how they developed. Pours a deep copper color with a decent off white head that shows moderate retention and lace. Smells of bready caramel and toffee with a bit of earth and alcohol. The flavor is sweet with bready caramel and toffee with a bit of ethanol to cut through the sweetness. Medium body with a light level of carbonation and a sweet sticky mouthfeel. After two years the alcohol is still a bit hot, but that is the only thing providing any balance against a really sweet syrupy maltiness. OK barleywine, definitely a sipper."

"Half finger off white head on a clear copper and crimson body. Aroma of candied orange, caramel malts, a little boozy and brown sugar. Carmel malts and sugars dominate the flavor which is slightly more boozy than average for the style. Toffee and oak woody notes. Fairly sweet. Creamy body and light to moderate carbonation. Overall I felt this one was a touch more boozy than other barleywines BUT still very drinkable and smooth. No one quality in the flavor stood out."
"O: Considering its strength, this beer is quite drinkable because the alcohol is well hidden from the taste, although the taste is complex enough for it to be slowly sipped while still keeping the interest of your taste buds."

"o - Overall I thought this was a really good barleywine. Not sure how it is fresh but very good with a year on it. Lots of caramel and great mouthfeel, would have it again."
"O: tonight is barleywine night apparently, as this is my 2nd of a possible 3 (let's see how I feel after this one's gone, eh?) - this is an excellent barleywine, being directly compared to Uinta's Anniversary Barleywine Ale - I'd say the Harpoon Leviathan is a tad sweeter and lacks the barrel-aged oakiness, but presents a more sweet malt character with some more notes of flavor (the pine and citrus, for example) - Harpoon's is more similar to other barleywines I've had, but still establishes a dry character that I especially enjoy. This is a good night for barleywine in my house."
""
""
"It's not too sweet, but it is a sticky, resinous beer with a solid body to it... I could see this being a hint thicker while dryer around the edges for less of a coat. Still, a very enjoyable barleywine that would pair well with any number of robust dishes (I'm just enjoying this with some aged local cheddar)."

"This poured out as a beautiful shade of red with a white colored head on top. There were some specks of stuff floating in this one but it didn't bother me at all. The smell of the beer is sweet and a little on the boozy side. The taste of the beer has some nice sharp bitter hops in there with some big amounts of malt. The mouthfeel is pretty good, it's got some weight to it but it's not overly thick at all. Overall this beer was pretty tasty i thought. I enjoyed having it."
"O - A good barleywine. I wish there was more of a malt presence in the nose and taste. Drinks pretty smooth and easy for a double digit ABV."
""
""
"Overall, quite drinkable but not really very good. I like the flavors in the beer but nothing really stands out for me and that puts it in pretty low standing"

"Other than a small bite in the aftertaste (which is not big enough to enough discount the beer too much) this is a solid barleywine with the classic strong aroma you come to expect from the brew. I can’t say that it ranks with the best of the bunch in its kind, but I enjoyed all 12 oz. of the bottle I purchased the other night."

"overall - nice and tasty."
"My first review on the newer updated BA.Poured into an imperial nonic a rich clear amber bronze with a 1/2 finger head atop that left a a broken ring of lace as it settled pretty quickly.Deeply fruity in the nose along with caramle malts,alot of sweet alcohol as well.Sweeter and alcoholic on the palate,somewhat hot it takes a little while to get used to,after awhile some fruity notes and leather-like flavors com in to play but it's still an acoholic monster.It looks great,feels great,and has alot going for it but it's hot and on the sweet side for my taste."
""

"The 2010 vintage was 1000 times better, especially when warm. Caramel and sweet toffee created something wonderful. If you have this beer - age it! From the small sample of this that I had it would probably rate around a ""4.0"" easy."
""
"Overall I am glad I tried this and even like it. It's a fair price too since it's a better value than most Barleywines in a bombers with a nice 12oz size for a one and done sitting. Good beer."

"O-A decent barleywine, nothing too offputing however the flavors could be stronger but it is well balanced."
"Pours a clear garnet/ruby color with some dark brown, mahogany hues. About an inch of light tan head develops, leaving minimal lacing upon dissolution. The aroma is of grape juice, faint plum, some raisin, a bit of toffee, some english malt, and faint vanilla. A strange “Capri Sun” essence to the nose that also carries over into the taste. More grape greets the tongue along with some alcohol bite, caramel, toffee, and faint vanilla. Grape and alcohol dominate. Mouthfeel is average; amply carbonated, but an alcohol bite predominates. Overall, a barleywine with potential, but there are improvements to be made."

"12oz bottle from the leviathan series, can't wait to see the behemoth series...alright a very deep ruby amber that gave a 1 finger head that faded to a thin layer with a ring around the edges and this one shows decent lace. the aroma is of dark fruits, caramel and fresh barley, wait is that vanilla? what?!?!?! the taste is of plums, a little red box that contained raisins, maybe some cherries but the black guys with a caramel malt, and vanilla. there has to be vanilla in this beer i need to talk to someone important from harpoon asap! i love vanilla it is my kryptonite when done right and its like i have a fucking tractor beam. you like apples?!?!?! there is definite alcohol in the end some hops. i don't get much of an english presence at all, maybe because this isn't my first brew i dunno nor do i care. anyway the mouth feel is heavy and carbonated a bit more than i would prefer but on a micro scale. this is a big beer and its not here to quench your thirst michael! go get some lemon-lime, YA KIKE! overall i enjoyed this brew and much more than the dipa. its well done a bit rough right now but has some serious underrated potential. its the carbonation and bermuda triangle storm but i can see through that nonsense and im going to age some of this and its going to turn out fanfuckingtastic! i know this. drink it ya kike!"

"Served from tap into a sampler tumbler. Poured red-orange with a minimal off-white head. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, caramel, wheat, and corn. The flavor was of sweet malt, caramel, wheat, wood, and sweet alcohol. It had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a good brew. The aroma on this one really didn't do much for me. I honestly had the wheat and corn aroma you would expect off of an adjunct lager. However, the flavor didn't follow suit here and went to a more traditional and solid barleywine. A definite must try if you are a fan of the barleywine or curious alike."
"This is a bit on the thin side for a Barley malt, but not in a negative way. It’s just not as slick and only as many within the style range."
"O: i can never really decide if i like barley wines r not, i'm pretty sure my mind changes daily but this one was pretty nice, a bit aggressive but i think that character really fits the style"
"O - This is the best harpoon brew I have ever had, it is a pretty good english barleywine. The alcohol is one of the most prominent character that makes one of these beers really nice to have, but that is about all you can have. I would definitely get this beer again sometime."

"Bottle from October 2010- been cellaring since. Poured from bottle into DFH snifter. Pours a rich dark amber color, with a creamy off white head that stands on top of the beer. No receding. Some lacing stays on the side of the glass. A terrific looking beer. Smell- toffee, mocha, some grainy aromas, caramel. What I would expect from the style, very appetizing aroma. Taste- creamy mouthfeel, a rich sweet blast of dark fruits like prunes, raisins, dark cherries. Very little hop presence or bitterness, this is just a super smooth and drinkable barleywine. And, no heat whatsoever from the ABV- it is well hidden in the creamy sweetness that the beer offers. I enjoyed this one, will seek out again."
"The beer pours a nice dark caramel, chestnut brown color with wonderfully resilient ring of foam. It looks as it should in the snifter. The aroma is a appetizing mixture of caramel, dates, figs, and alcohol. Very smooth, borderline creamy, on the palate. The malt is well developed with caramel, fruity and earthy components all overlapping in coherent form. A whisper of alcohol at the end binds it together. A nice sipping beer. It is not sweet and not too hot."
""
"O: The taste on this is very weak to me. It has a lot of good qualities and hopefully with age it will take a lot better. I remember liking this more the last time I had it."
""
"Overall: This is a decent barley, I've certainly had better but I would drink this again, it's moderately priced, and I think I got what I paid for."

"Overall: Over the past year I have become accustomed to barleywines and the many different breweries that produce them. Will be having more of these in the future."
"Pours a hazy dark orange-brown with a 1 inch fizzy orange-white head that settles to a film on the top of the beer. Random streaks and spots of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of sweet malt, brown sugar, caramel, citrus fruits, and citrus zest. Taste is of bready/biscuit malt, brown sugar/caramel, with an herbal/citrus zest hop finish. A very mild bitterness sits on the tongue after each sip, which then fades to a honey aftertaste. This beer has a low level of tiny bubbles for a smooth and slightly sticky mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good barleywine with a very nice set of flavors and a good balance between the malt and the hops used."
"Poured into my 13 oz tulip. Very attractive red-orange, beautiful 2 inch white head, some lacing. Smell is so English BW, that turns me off for some reason. A breadyness, with some cinnamon, fig, and candy apple. Taste all that, too sweet for me. Very easy 10%, abv hidden very well. I miss the100 barrel American BW. Plenty of carbonation & o.k mouthfeel, just very sweet and lacking the hop presence I love."
"O: Maybe it's all the trash beers I've had lately, but I thought this was pretty good."
"This is a surprisingly strong beer and has a nice complexity to it. I appreciate it from Harpoon and would gladly try it again."
"Overall. a very enjoyable barleywine. Would be nice if this was available in Ontario, because I am sure I would purchase it often."
"Pours a bright, clear reddish-amber color with a very thin off-white head that quickly recedes to a half-cap with a thin collar of bubbles. The nose brings some light cherry and other fruits. Flavor is moderately-sweet with some bread and light brown sugar plus a light amount of caramel. Malt dominates, though it's not too integrated. Alcohol is impressively integrated. Medium body and average carbonation for the style. Pretty good."
"Overall, this is a good Barleywine, though I feel that the carbonation is a bit excessive, the sugars are slightly heavy, and the hops overly dominate the end of the mouthful. The beer doesn't--at least for me--match up to the excellent levels of Harpoon's other Leviathan beers. Don't get me wrong: this is still a good beer, but of the Leviathan beers that I've tried (which is all but one of them), this is towards the bottom of the rankings."
"O- Damn close to perfect! Just missing a few things in my opinion that would kick each catagory up another point!!! Wish it was just a bit more honey/caramel/maple sticky on the tongue! Barrel ageing could make this one of the greatest Barleywines EVER!!!"
"A strong, flavorful Barleywines that lacks some of the smoothness of other examples. Decent and might even improve with some age. Sadly, the alcohol really gets strong halfway."
"O: Very good offering by Harpoon, I can't wait to age some of these and come back to them later when they've mellowed out!"
"D: Easy for a 10%. Not complex, pretty well put together."
"Overall, a pretty nice barleywine. However, it was a little too alcoholic for me. Rather intrusive."
"Smell - The aroma was loaded down with caramel. Lots of spices in the nose here as well. Hints of raisins and figs, light earthy, roasted malts and a good touch of alcohol. Very complex nose, and unique for the style. Rich tastes of oak and vanilla, hints of roasted malts and caramel. Very tight and nicely done. A bit of alcohol, just enough to thicken it up a bit. A really nice and very full barley wine. Finish was strong, with a healthy dose of d spice lingering in the mouth for what seemed like forever."
"Overall this is a tasty brew that's true to the English Barleywine style, really one of the best styles of beer on the planet if you ask me. Top notch barleywines are is all about balance and that is what this beer delivers. Not sure if this is my first from the Leviathan series but this is the first one I can recommend."
"Yeah, I'm a huge Harpoon homer but this is good stuff even without the hometown bias."
"o: Nothing off, I just kept hoping for a little more. When I stopped trying and just enjoyed this, I found myself enjoying it quite a bit. Definitely recommended."
"D - Pretty drinkable, especially considering the 10% abv. The hops are a nice surprise. The overall flavors are nicely balanced and develop nicely, especially as the beer warms up a bit."
"Overall: A sipper but and enjoyable one. The hops do come out more than some other English barleywines that I have had. One of the better Leviathan beers I have had, yet there are others in the style I would go to first. A nice offering."
"D - Not a bad bottle of beer; for a barleywine I expected a bit more flavor, actually kind of weak in that department, but otherwise a solid beer; I've had better"
"Notes: Good if unremarkable offering from the Leviathan series... Sure enough these are relatively heftier brews like a Harpoon rep suggested to me once, but not that particularly hefty or most importantly stimulating. Luckily most of them remain quality. The 100 barrel series are typically more nuanced by design, again the rep defended, but I think I´d rather stick to those instead if I had to choose."
"Notes: Very solid. Has everything you're looking for in the style, plus a little extra thanks to the American hops. Drinks great fresh, but I'm still curious to see what time would do for it. Dangerously drinkable for the style, alcohol doesn't have much of an impact. Another solid entry in the Leviathan series."
"O - Pretty hot with the alcohol burning. I think this one might improve after a couple years in the cellar."
"O-Overall not too bad. Definitely need to take your time this one. The 10% ABV is very evident."
"O/D: It's satisfying, a tad sweet, not the easiest to drink. I think I'm done after one, but a decent barleywine."
"Enjoyed it but I don't think I could drink more than one of these in a sitting- the flavors are too strong and the ABV too potent."
"The brew was tasty and I will give it another go on tap."
"D: I partially answered this already; however, this is more of a one-and-done deal for me. I'd much rather seek out other English barleywines than this; however, I wasn't disappointed with this either. The ABV isn't as masked as I hoped it would be."
"CORRECTION-after checking, what i thought might be saaz was probably tettnang hops. close."
"D - Easy to drink, the 10% is really only just noticeable. Drinks like an 8%. Aroma and flavor are a bit lacking, but it is still easy to drink, especially for the ABV."
"D - Very good drinkability. Alcohol comes through but doesn't take away from the beer. You're not going to pound through these, but you can easily get through a bottle enjoying it the entire way."
"The beer pours a deep amber color with a thick frothy off-white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a rich, malty scent that boasts of burnt toffee and caramel. It's mildly bitter with touch of alcohol warmth. The taste is good as well. It has a smooth, well balanced flavor that's bitter up front with an excellent malt flavor following. It's rich and flavorful with a delicate caramel/toffee feel and a moderate alcohol warmth. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a tasty brew that's true to style and easy drinking; another winner from the Leviathan series."
"Bitterness steps in a bit on the taste but not enough to offset the sweet onslaught of maltiness. Pretty smooth though, even with a notable alcohol bite at the end. Despite the lack of hop presence, I think this one would get better with age and some oxidation might add some needed complexity to the malts. Not bad, worthy of a four-pack purchase if you are into sweet English B-wines."
"D: The flavors are nice, but the alcohol is a little bit too unmasked and the texture is a little too syrupy to make this too incredibly drinkable."
"D - for a barleywine this is very drinkable; it could stand up to some cellaring, but doesn't need it"
"D-This is one of the most drinkable English barleywines I've ever had. Most have a cloying malt sweetness that makes drinking more than one a chore. This is a winner!"
"The beer pours a reddish-amber color with a white head. The aroma is heavy on the brown sugar with some caramel malt and piney hops mixed in. The flavor is more of the same. I get a lot of sugar as well as some pine and orange notes. While there is some hop flavor, there is very little bitterness resulting in the beer being very sweet. The alcohol is barely detectable. Very easy to drink. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Very nice overall."
"D - pretty darn good for the style."
"Deep clear brown pour with good head. Decent smell, mostly hops. Taste is also hoppy, also slightly sweet and malty with alcohol coming through in the middle of the swallow. Nice finish, but overall a little harsh. This beer is one that requires an open mind to enjoy."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into dimpled mug. Aroma of malt, slight alcohol, light dark ripe fruit, and some toasted sugars. Poured copper/amber in color with a small, tan head that diminished but lasted throughout as a film on top of the beer. Clear. Sparkling. Flavor is light to medium sweet and lightly bitter. Tastes of malt, light alcohol, light caramel, hops, slight toasting, slight brown sugar, and yeast. Medium body. Oily, then lightly dry and slightly sticky texture. Average carbonation. Malt, toasted sugar, hop, and caramel finish is lightly dry. 10%ABV is quite obvious in the flavor, and noticeable in the aroma. Can't say I was a big fan of this beer however."
"Cheers"
"Pairs well with spicy foods: Vindaloos and hearty meaty spicy stews of the western variety, as well."
"Drinkability- A good barley wine, maybe it should be aged to mellow it out but i enjoyed it and it left me wanting more after every sip."
"This is a very good beer. It has great complex flavor, lots to taste, also dangerously easy to drink."
"peace in the middle east."
"Not really too keen on this one."
"Drink is meh, pretty boozy overall, drinks hotter than 10% it seems, that long bitter herbal taste at the end doesn't help either, and then leaves a sticky almost icky feel in the mouth."
"not especially good for a barley wine, disappointment overall, especially in relation to the other beers in the Leviathan series"
"Sip after sip this beer grows on me more and more. Sure you could probably cellar this beer but it is drinking great now."
"D-I can see why others say to age this beer, but even right now it is pretty decent. Flavors are balanced nicely and the alcohol is not overwhelming"
"drinks ok. alcohol hidden rather well for being 10%. suits the style relatively well, but does nothing to compare itself to the elite. falls short, but its not bad."
"This is quite potent brew, as is par normal with the Leviathan series. It has a strong malty taste that rounds off quite nice on the tongue. This is one of the better beers in the leviathan series, which is saying something considering the caliber of this whole line. It does have a very strong alcohol flavor to it that I have not noticed quite so much in the rest of the series, but they still round this one out for an all around good beer."
"D: Harpoon's Leviathan beers are usually reliably good, but this barleywine is definitely not up to snuff."
"This tastes almost too strong to be an English barleywine. It has the right characteristics for the Americanized style."
"D - This is a nice beer, enjoyable to drink, but not quite what I am looking for in a barleywine."
"Clear, coppery chestnut with a thin skim of fine beige bubbles and a modest collar. Sticky, spotty lacing. The aroma is a bit overboard with ripe fruits, banana, strawberries, alcohol. Some grain and caramel in the background. It sort of grew on my, but was odd at first. The flavour was a combination of (burnt) sugary sweetness and alcohol, banana and other ripe fruits, with bitterness more apparent in the finish, which was oddly dry and quite warm. Moderate carbonation, full body, slightly creamy in texture. Decent overall, but the fruity character was a little too much for my liking."
"12oz. bottle served in my Old Stock snifter. Pours a translucent amber/caramel with a loose, quarter inch, tan-colored head that quickly disperses towards the edges into a thin, bubbly band. Nose expresses candied fruits (perhaps figs, prunes and/or raisins) and a light ethanol character. Taste consistent with nose; however, fruit character is a bit more subdued than anticipated, as is the alcohol. There's also a noticeable hops presence (closer to an American than an English barleywine in my opinion) and perhaps a slightly medicinal quality. Mouthfeel is medium-light, with an assertive carbonation and some residual alcohol heat/astringency detectable towards the back. Definitely not my favorite from this series - a little dull for the style. It might improve slightly with age; particularly in the mouthfeel department, but I don't see this as becoming overly stellar with age."
"I enjoyed drinking the glass in front of me. This is another good addition to the Leviathan series, but probably not quite on par with Triticus. Lacks the complexity need to bring it into the A range. Still a tasty beer though and worth checking out if you see it around."
"Drinkabiility is great. One or two and you're done as it's a powerful 10%, but that's fine, as you'll be cherishing this Barleywine (who knew!) as a great sipping beer."
"An aggressive, 'Bigfoot-like' hop burst hits the palate first, laying down bitter layers of pine sap and hop oils. The English inspired malt bill shows up nicely with a toasted toffee and near-medicinal grain character. Alcohol is present and breathy in the finish, but nowhere near hot considering the greenness of this beer. Mouthfeel is spot-on in terms of viscosity and carbonation level, allowing the hops to linger but not overwhelm the palate. Overall, a tasty interpretation of the style and a fitting contribution to the Leviathan lineup. Worth seeking out, as this barleywine should age interestingly..."
"I liked it a lot better from the growler. I'd really like to see what it's like out of a cask, maybe that would mellow it out a lot."
"There are a couple of Leviathan beers from Harpoon that I have really liked, but there have also been some pretty bad ones. This is closer to the later. I probably will not revisit this one."
"D - this was a rough one, i had hoped this would improve as it warmed up but it had the opposite affect. This beer should be drank ice cold so you can't taste it."
"Very drinkable, which is scary, and let it warm up a bit to really enjoy. This is what Saint Arnold Brewing wants the DR10 to taste like in a year or so. Great job."
"I love the Leviathan series of beers, they're absolutely amazing. In the series, this one has to be my second favorite next to the Imperial IPA. I would love to see Harpoon offer this one on a regular basis and I bet this would really be good with a few years on it. Very, very nice!"
"D: I enjoyed this beer. I will cellar a bottle or two just to see what happens but it is quite nice and a nice deal around $10 for a 4 pack. The nose is kind of a mystery to me but the taste is nice. Still saying American Barleywine though."
"12oz bottle. Pours a dark mahogany with a nice frothy head. Good lacinng. I'm picking up on an aroma of bubble gum. Also some sweetness along with the boozey smell. This beer is somewhat watery with a warming alcohol taste. Only hints of the bubble gum in the flavor but it does have an overall sweetness to it. Decent barleywine, worth a second look but not in that first tier of the great ones like Old Ruffian."
"taste is about spot on with the nose. Very sweet, with a strong brown sugary molasses flavor. Alcohol on the finish is definitely there, but the burn is not too bad due to the hops and the sweet making it pretty smooth. Makes me wonder what this would do in the cellar... a little thin for my tastes, as the barleywines I have been liking lately have been pretty thick. But, overall not too bad an attempt."
"medium bodied mouthfeel with medium carbonation. pretty drinkable considering a 10% ABV. triticus is my personal favorite from the leviathan series, but this is a close second. (3.5/4.0)"
"Cheers"
"Pours a three fingered cream head that slowly fades to a thin layer, leaving a good lace. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Expecting a dark fruit nose but it is sweet malt. Color is crystal clear amber. Flavor is malty sweet with a good hop backbone. Some lingering hoppiness. High ABV is hidden. $3.00 for a 12oz bottle from Bert's Better Beers Hooksett, NH."
