You would think you were sniffing Alaskan Amber at first. Surprisingly, the nose on this beer doesn't grow. After it warms, it still smells malty and grainy. Taste is much different. Sweet vanilla and bourbon. Lovely oak flavors. This beer tastes delicious, just really lacks in the nose. Overall, not much complexity to this one. It has depth... but only when you're searching for it. No puns with the ""sea theme""... just not a great beer. A tasty beer at best.","DovaliHops","Mar 06, 2013"

Aromas of caramel, raisin, toast, brown sugar, light roast, brown bread, floral, light pine, and herbal earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance, strength, and complexity. Taste of caramel, toast, brown sugar, raisin, brown bread, light toffee, floral, light pine, light roast, and herbal earthiness. Minimal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, brown bread, brown sugar, raisin, light roast, light toffee, floral, and herbal earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice flavor balance and complexity; though it is not as robust as I would expect for the style; with zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a fairly creamy and slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish; very smooth to sip on.

Detectable booziness plays with the other flavors to give off an imitation bourbon like note underneath it all. Lots of jammy dark fruits. Well concentrated flavors that kind of present themselves all together. They all kind of work together too.

Mouthfeel is very very light and watery. Not the creamy sticky feeling I'm used to from barleywines. Overly carbonated. Not because it is actually overly carbonated, but because the carbonation is overpowering to the mouthfeel and the overall flavors of the beer.

To my nose the heavy barley and fruit nose weren't as pronounced and at ten percent I expected my nose to sense the the alcohol beneath it. As far as taste goes, its not that I didn't like the flavor it just wasn't what I hope for in a Barley Wine. I want my pallet to be full, it doesn't need to be excessive, but the flavor should be strong and bold. I found this barley wine balanced and quaffable, for a BW I want bold and reprehensible in strenth and stature. I taste the fruit, but I want it to hit me in the face, and I want to almost have to chew the barley taste. Not as heavy in the mouth as I would like.

Clean liquid, if as much dark brown as any red or orange amber, multiple beads of strong tiny bubbles. The nose is sweet even for the category, molasses, caramel, maple syrup, butterscotch, milk chocolate, spiced orange reduction, it's boozy but not overpoweringly so, peach, apricot and pear close to a dried fruit character, the barley, oats and sweeter grains almost an afterthought. Full-bodied, all credit to the carbonation for trying but not quite tough enough to take the chunkiness out of the whole, has a leaden feel. Still, no lack of cocoa, chocolate, caramel, toffee and maple with a fruitcake to challah bread element as well. Here, a light hoppy bitterness comes through, a welcome addition. Brings sour orange with some lemon. The spiciness is there but without clearly distinct flavors. Wears you down by the end of the glass.","farrago","Mar 05, 2011"

It has a tawny red/brown color that is very pretty. It looks a lot like port. The head is a thin layer of tan foam that has settled quickly to a skim. As a swirl the glass around, a good coat is left behind. The beer is translucent and I can make out a healthy amount of carbonation rising within. The aroma also reminds of a glass of port. There is warming quality. It smells alcoholic, but also of plums, raisins and oak. The beer has a strong English malt flavor. It is slightly bready, but also full of toffee, plum and caramel. Of course, there is also a lot of alcohol. The sweet coat that is left behind burns off of my mouth like the residue rubbing alcohol leaves behind. It turns into a detectable vapor that is strong but not off-putting. It doesn't have as heavy of a body as I expected; in fact, it is slightly watery. This surprising lightness is tempered by the strong alcohol burn. I like this sensation, but I can see if affecting the drinkabilty of this beer for many consumers. I'm glad I have a couple bottles still left in my cellar; I will left them sit for a while before opening them. This beer is pretty enjoyable now, but I think some age will really improve it.","ToasterChef","Jun 25, 2010"

The taste is very similar with the exception that I picked up much more on the malt and less on the cherry. There was a clear booze bite as its going down, but not overpowering.

It tastes like grain, figs, bread, caramel and booze. There's also a slight bitter finish. The alcohol heat is noticable, but not overpowering. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's coating and a bit creamy with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is OK, it's not hard to drink at all.

A slightly heavy alcohol smell with a good base of sweet malts - caramel, honey, syrup - also something woody in there as well. A good hop presence as well. A rather thick-bodied beer, it packs a malty punch on the first sip with the sweet malts kicking in gear but balanced with a dryness from some hops and oak or some wood. Not perfectly balanced, but a sweetness is there as well as the alcohol (hidden for the most part) and hops for a good beer.

Thick, low attenuation with carbonation on the low side made for a texture that was a bit of a mess.

Toasted malts and caramel flavors upfront, followed by malto dextrin taste and and nice blend of soft citrusy american hops (Amarillo?)and herbal fuggle hop flavor. Aftertaste is a little slick with the dextrins lingering and showing signs of cidery booze, then slowly dries out with english hop biterness. This demonstrates the balanaced profile of an English-style Barley Wine fairly well. The carbonation is light but seems appropriate given the full-body and rich dextrinous texture. Finishes borderline cloying and certainly residual, lots of toasty caramel and apparent estery alcohol. The english hops really hold on and slowly put the flavor back in check to secure a respectable drinkability.

I chose a Duvel tulip for the primal tasting, and the beer came of amber brown in color, and clear. The head was small at first and disintegrated to a ring of bubbles shortly thereafter. The looks were typical for the style, but that is rarely the point of a Barleywine anyway. The smell was loaded with a plethora of fruits which were hard to characterize into individual types. There was also a salty air about this beer, which was appropriate considering the maritime theme on the label. The taste was punchy and not well melded. There was an odd clash sweet and sharp flavors in each sip with alcohol trying to play a spicy (but unsuccessful) mediator. Thick bodied, but not soft, this seemed to lack a lot of polished qualities at the time of release. I think a couple of years in the cellars will smooth out the rough edges, and bring the favorable qualities more to the forefront. At this time though, this was a little too harsh and aggravating.

Solid caramel and toasty British malt with a little alcohol interaction in there that gives it a bit of a chemically flavor. This all fades to a solid earthy and piney hop and a very solid toastyness. This one is a bit drying, sucking all the moisture from the sides of my tongue. Burps are slightly fruity as well. The apparent alcohol is a little detracting. There may even be a little smokey phenols in there. Feel is thick, with a light to moderate carbonation. Very solid feel to this one. Drinkability is pretty good. I just checked the ABV, so its not a surprise, at 11%, that it comes through a little in the flavor.

Body was sufficient and nothing special. Drinkability wasnt bad as in it went down easy enough. The lack of any real flavor and aroma depth will keep me away from my other bottles for awhile in hopes of something happening with them. Not a bad beer but about as average as it gets.","meathookjones","Feb 16, 2006"
4.1,12.9,4,4,4,4,4.5,"It's been a good year for the Heavy Seas line -- first a very good imperial pilsner, and then two nice ipa's. Their Peg Leg imperial stout, although tasy, is not quite up to the style. Had it been labeled an imperial brown ale I think it would have been very well received. Which brings us to Below Decks, which is getting only fair to poor reviews. I can't quite understand why -- this is a very pleasing dark brew with very nice vanilla carmel notes and is amazing drinkable for 11% abv. (It's also a good deal -- I paid $7.50 for a 4 pack). Perhaps it should have been labeled a strong dark ale rather than a barleywine. Regardless, Below Decks is quite delicious.","ABV","Feb 15, 2006"
3.2,-11.8,3,3,3,3,4,"Not much to say. Light aroma, flavor, and body. High carbonation. Would never guess it is a Barleywine. It is very easy to drink and the ABV is barely noticeable. Just dont expect anything aggressive, which is one reason to drink a barleywine.","sacfly","Feb 11, 2006"

2.93,-19.3,3.5,3,3,3,2.5,"A clean brown beer with amber highlights. Has a good creamy off white head. Very light aroma, some malt sweetness, hop bitterness and a disturbing corn note in the background. No real distinct flavors. Again some malt sweetness, a light hop bite on the finish, that nagging little corn note in the back and the alcohol burn. Maybe it will blossom next year but it doesn't have alot to work with.","ybnorml","Jan 17, 2006"
3.18,-12.4,3.5,3,3,3.5,3.5,"Amber, with golden highlights, but minimal head and carbonation. Hoppy and vineous to the nose, alchohol takes the drivers seat on the tastebuds. A bit bland overall, no real flavor, unfortunatly. Fairly easy to drink, apart from the lack of taste. A bit light and thin.","hustlemuscle","Jan 04, 2006"

3.96,9.1,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,"12 oz bottle, poured into a snifter, this is a very dark clear amber with a surprisingly thick finger of head, decent retention, and some pretty nice lacing. Nose is very muted, a slightly sweet malt, some spicey hops, a hint of alcohol. Taste is a light fruity malt, tropical and citrus fruits, slowly giving way to a nice piney hops presense leaving a nice bitter aftertaste awash slightly with alcohol. Mouthfeel is medium with a fairly smooth slick taste. Alcohol stays fairly well hidden, never more than just a hint in the finish. I find most Barleywines to be unbalanced--American ones are great hopmonsters while English ones tend to be very sweet to the point of cloying. This is a very well-balanced alternative, maybe lacking in some of the intensity of flavor a lot of Barleywines have, but a pretty good attempt from Clipper City at the style.","cubedbee","Dec 19, 2005"
3.95,8.8,4,4,4,3.5,4,"I tried it both cold and at near room temperature. The warmer sample had a much spicier and complex flavor. (forgive me I am still learning to match words with what I taste) But both were very smooth and drinkable. You don't realize the amount of alcohol that is there. I haven't tried it out of the bottle yet but was overall very happy with it.","ScarletLady","Dec 15, 2005"
4.27,17.6,3.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Smooth, yet average, mouthfeel. Goes down quickly and easily. The high ABV is extremely well hidden--there wasn't any overtly boozy flavor or any mouth warming properties. The run of the mill, balanced flavor is spot on for an English Barleywine and reminds me of several I had while in England. Since it isn't the boozy hopmonster that American Barleywines are, I found it to be highly drinkable. Drank two before dinner just last night. Some interesting things may come about as it ages too.","Dithyramb","Dec 13, 2005"

2.78,-23.4,3.5,3,2.5,2.5,3,"The apperance is pretty nice a solid depp amber with a whitish head but no lacing and the head leaves the party very fast. The smell is muted, there is a presence of piney hops and alcohol and some maltyness, but everything is dulled. A confused brew, the alcohol shines through and the hops give a decent bite but the malt seems too lax and isn't up to the challenge of containing the alcohol. The body is almost no-exsistant, too watery for style and really hurt the flavor. Best to see if this improves any, I will see another bottle in a few months.","Higravity","Dec 12, 2005"
3.23,-11,4,3.5,3,3.5,3,"High ABV and the average flavor will help limit me at one. Just an average barleywine at this point. We'll see how it ages and my opinion may change.","MaltyGoodness","Dec 10, 2005"
3.63,0,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"This beer poured a clear medium amber color with little carbonation present. It formed an off white foamy head that left circular lace as it subsided. An aroma of malts, hops, caramel and slightly burnt butterscotch aspect to it. The flavor was of malt, hops, wood(?pine) with a touch of caramel. The body was a bit thinner than usual for style and the finish had a stlight astrigent, yet burnt aspect to it. As with all barleywines, this one may just be young and improve with age. Will try a bottle later in the season and see if it improves.","Wildman","Dec 07, 2005"
