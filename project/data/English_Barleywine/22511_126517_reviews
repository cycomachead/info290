"A massive let down....red fruits, cloyingly sweet, brown sugar, huge residual sugars and next to no barrel presence. As a barleywine it's disappointing..as a Hill Farmstead barrel aged barleywine it's a huge disappointment. Understanding taste is subjective I can't help but feel that too many people are tasting the rare here. There is nothing special about this beer."
"While this beer has the hype it doesn't live up. Overall, just too sweet with no barrel. This beer fell short mostly on the taste and feel, it was almost long the lines of Fun Dip or Pixie Sticks. A fun try and I love their beer normally, just not this one apparently."
"Not sure I've ever experienced so much rich bourbon flavor without tasting ""boozy"".  Rich caramel flavors dominate.  Really nice.  Want more."
"Overall this was very good. It has a lot of dark fruits to it, so if you like that characteristic in your barleywines, you'll love this one. Well worth checking out."

"Solid barleywine. Leon definitely beat it though for me. Tasted similar to great."

"The beer is clean, subtle, and refined, just as expected. It could explode with more richness, but still one of the better bourbon barrel barleywines out there."

"Overall: a top notch beer as its reputation claims. great balance between a malty and sweet barleywine and a rich bourbon aged beer. love the balance on this one."

"O - Easily the best barleywine I have had. Spot on in all the right places. Essentially perfect. Not just one of the best barleywines, but one of the best beers I have had."

"It's kind of rare nowadays to find a barleywine that hasn't been gobbled up by barrels and their corresponding flavors, so that makes this particular brew extra enjoyable. It's a gem for sure."

"A little curious. Very sweet, but not heavy. Lot of apple, hard to believe this is just bourbon barrels. Could use more carbonation."

"Would love to have this one again."

"O~ this could be my favorite BA Barley Wine but i'm totally biased since i'm not too into the style. i'm very seasonal with this style but this one i could actually drink year around. super surprised by how smooth and refreshing it is! I NEED MORE!!!!"

"O-Not a bourbon bomb at all, more of a balanced english barleywine.  The flavors are not mind blowing, but the balance is so dialed in."

"Overall - This is a really fantastic beer."

"Just about one of the best barleywines I've ever had. Real nice for a brewery's first barleywine."

"I am not typically a barley wine drinker but the sweetness of this beer is so well offset by the vanilla oak presence I am left longing for the next sip. This beer just transcends style and showcases the HF BA program. Yet again impressed."
"Big thanks to Ineedabeerhere (thanks Joe) for the chance to try this amazing beer.  Pours slightly darker than mahogany with no head,just a soapy slick.  Nose is booze and sugary with some toffee notes.  Taste is amazing!  Everything an English Barleywine should be -  sugary figs and maple syrup.  Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with an almost still carbonation.  This is just an amazing barleywine, one of the best, if not the best I've had to date."

"O- huge complex beer with tons of flavor and booze. Maybe a bit too boozy but I'm not complaining. Going to ask the wife to hide the three bottles in the basement so I'm not tempted to pop another one open before next year."

"keith really appreciate it!"
