3.79,-6.4,4,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,"BOD 2013.  Pours a hazy medium amber with a dark ruby hue.  Above average head volume, exceptional lacing and retention.  Light nose of sweet fruit (plum), caramel and toasted brown sugar over a light sherry alcohol note.  Medium body with a texture that approaches creamy.  Below normal carbonation with just a hint of effervescence in the finish.  The flavor profile is very intense, very complex and somewhat balanced considering the intensity.  It begins with a malt bomb assault of sweetness that is caramel and toasted brown sugar.   As the sweetness subsides (it never really leaves) notes of plum emerge over a slight note of nuts.  The middle is where the alcohol predominates with a sherry undertone over a sweetness that is honey like.  The finish is a slow fade of sherry like alcohol over a honey like sweetness.  The lack of balance is what holds this one back from being outstanding.","tillmac62","Nov 26, 2014"

Significant amount of yeast ended up floating in the beer. The floating bits were much more distracting than I recall in other beers. It did effect the taste and mouthfeel until everything settled. There is very little carbonation anyway, so a gentle pour wouldn't have any real downside. Taste was surprisingly delicate with no sherry alcohol burn. Caramel sweetness upfront with a lingering sugary sweetness. Heavy soy sauce taste hit the back of the tongue.","msquared36","Oct 04, 2014"

I think its either inferior to the regular harvest ale or in a weird aging stage that leaves a bit to be desired before its a stellar brew again.

Aroma is big sweetness with lots of sherry, toffee, molasses, maple syrup, and a little hint of fruits. Flavor is surprisingly similar to the Calvados cask. A good bit of bitter hazelnut alongside leather, sweet caramel maple and brown sugar. Sweet but this had a nice balanced bitter and medium level sherry booze and the sherry really accents this nicely. Sweet heavy mouthfeel but with adequate carbonation to keep this from being syrupy.

The beer looked like I remembered it when I had it a few years ago. The smell was very sweet and quite inviting. The taste is also sweet with plenty of flavorful malts and some sherry hints in there.

Tastes of fermented fruits are up front that fade into the heavy malt taste of the english two row and crystal malts.

More dark fruits and some molasses are present but not overboard. Since it's been aged about 5 years, I can't tell it's almost 12 percent. No ABV is noticeable is the mouth, not even a tingle.

It tasted fairly similar to the standard Harvest Ale also, but not as sweet up front. It had more oak character, and had a bit of sherry in the aftertaste. It was a little thicker than the standard Harvest Ale, which was nice. Overall this was an excellent beer, but not terribly distinguished from the other J.W. Lees. I didn't pick up on much sherry flavor or scent, but there was noticeably more oak from the cask aging. This rounded out the beer's flavor, balancing against the sweetness, and hiding the alcohol a bit better. So this was easier to drink and a bit more enjoyable in the end.","Pencible","Mar 22, 2009"

I can taste brown sugar, toffee, raisins, figs, molasses and sweet malt. Alcohol is also noticable in the taste, but that's a good thing for this beer. Mouthfeel/body is full, it's smooth, thick and oily with low carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's enjoyable to drink but it's a sipping beer for me, anyway.

I'm not too concerned given the style and abv. The sherry finish on this beer really lends quite a bit to the style. The sweet malt blends beautifully with the slightly nutty, vinous sherry. This isn't surprising considering that sherry casks have become all the rage for finishing Scotch- especially the slightly sweeter, maltier ones. It works. The sweet malt is up front in both the aroma and taste, followed by the nice sherry notes of almonds, light fruit, and salty caramel. Everything blends harmoniously and the finish and mouthfeel are smooth and rich without being unctuous. The vinous flavors really cut through the malt and make this very drinkable.

On a lazy Saturday night, reading some homebrew books and sipping on this English Barleywine -- It's a good night. The beer begins with the expected malty-sweet aroma with slight hints of hops, ripe (or over-rippened) fruits, and a light peppery / alcohol note in the nose. Aromas are quite similar to 1-year standard Harvest Ales. The flavors follow up on the heavy sweetness, but a tawny port wine-like woodyness, booziness, and mustiness soon follows. None of these sherry notes dominate the beer, but add just a hint of added variety. The hops are still young and over-bearing and will need some time to simmer, but the beer is still sublime. The feel is a weighted sweetness that, at times show syrupy textures, and at others a rich maltiness. The hops add a distracting bitterness, metalic, and bitey feel that will fall out over the next year or so. Overall, the beer is terrific but is still quite young and has some maturing to do.","BEERchitect","Nov 10, 2007"

I get flavors of vanilla, chocolate, melon and bacon fat. Incredibly decadent beer. The beer has a long, lingering finish, and on the palate it is very rich, plush and smooth. The abv. is noticeable, and this beer is definitely a sipper, but the beer is so flavorful, you hardly notice the acohol. The only thing that really detracts from the drinkability is the sweetness.

Not entirely complex. The sugar is too dense and rich. There arent many nuanced notes here. Some plum and pear juices in a rice mixture. Seemingly more confused. After the cloying mixture a brief reprise of light vinous character, a bit of bittered oak resins and then a wash of old hops. This one seems unbalanced. The sugars too abundant, the malt character not forward enough, the barrel character somewhat unpleasent and the hops kind of rotty tasting. A real shame for the price.

Mouthfeel is thick and smooth, except for the finish, which runs too hot to be called "smooth". Sticky. Overall, a bit too simple compared to the other JW Lees barley wines.

Nose is like a glass of sherry or port wine. Flavor is all the wine with a slight hop kick towards the end. The bittersweetness also provides a slight curl to the taste.

A few different types of sweetness combine to create a pretty sickeningly sweet smell. Of course the usual JW Lees toffee and caramel smell is very strong in there, and there is a little bit of malty sweetness, but there is also a strong maple syrup type smell and the sherry cask they aged this in must have been an extremely sweet sherry because it has a very strong influence on this beer. There is also a powerful spiced rum smell in there. The smell is very much in your face and powerful, but not appetizing at all to me. Taste is cloyingly sweet, as expected. There is some definitely depth and complexity here, and I'm sure this is probably what the brewers intended to achieve with this combination, but I can hardly stomach it right now. This is more rich and sweet than almost any dessert I've ever tried. Hardly any balancing bitterness in this one. Mouthfeel is nice and full and slippery without any carbonation.

I picked up something new each time I whiffed. Taste is just as complex. I was continually picking up new flavors. There's a main dried fruit aspect to this beer that holds the sherry in and lets it be more noticeable. Apricots and cherry are there. More toasted caramel along with a roasted cashew taste.

The head retention is limited, but at 11.5% that's to be expected - and it still keeps a decent collar which is unusual for such a high alcohol beer! The nose is loaded with sweet, delicately caramelized malt and notes of sticky-sweet dried dark fruit as well as some leafy and almost herbal hops. There's no particular evidence of either sherry or wood, but it is somehow lighter or less malty than the regular version. In the mouth it's full bodied almost to the point of being syrupy; smooth; and quite creamy. It's rich maltiness dominates the flavor with a sticky, honey-like character that's balanced by herbal, leafy and grassy hops. The sherry comes through midway across the palate with a spritz of fruit-juice and alcohol. The bitterness is low-key, but has enough ballast enough to balance it. The sherry comes through again in the finish, lending it just a little more complexity than the original; but of the four specially "casked" versions, this is one of the less interesting (with port being the other - the clavados and Lagavulin were actually interesting).","NeroFiddled","Jun 12, 2005"
