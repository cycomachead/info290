4.32,0.7,3.75,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.25,"Picked this up in a great trade with Mike.  2012 vintage.  Dark amber-orange pour with a quickly fading two finger beige head with decent lacing.  The nose is bold and complex with tons of buttery toffee and caramel along with hints of oak, vanilla, coconut, and subtle dark fruits.  The taste mirrors the nose with huge caramel and molasses up front along with hints of vanilla, toffee, brown sugar, toasted coconut, booze, tobacco, and oak.  The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a nice creaminess and smooth, but warming finish.  It gets crazy drinkable as it warms.  Overall, this is a bold and flavorful beer that just kept improving as I drank it.","beerdrifter","Dec 16, 2014"

Aromas of caramel, brown and caramelized sugar with lots of juicy pitted fruit. Vanilla with a hint of woodiness. The flavor is sweet sugary malt with hints of oak and vanilla and a somewhat overly present alcohol heat. Hints of pitted fruits and a light smoked toffee round the flavor out. Thick body light carbonation, sticky syrupy with an alcohol burn. Very flavorful but shows all of the12% abv. could use a bit of time to mellow but I wouldn't hesitate to pick up another given half a chance.","johnnnniee","Nov 09, 2014"

4.37,1.9,3.75,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.5,"a wonderful showcase of the bourbon barrel here. different than all the stouts and thick sticky blends they do, this is a lighter (in color and in roastiness) malt bill than a lot of their big barreled beers. i think it lets the wood and the bourbon flavors really present themselves well. english sort of grain profile to this, sweet and sappy, caramel like, and full bodied. the beer looks about right for what it claims to be, toffee colored beer with bronzed amber edges. not much head from the tap, or at least it settles down pretty quickly. tons and tons of sweet vanilla on the nose, this has very obviously spent a great deal of time resting on bourbon. a sturdy char on the barrel too helps to add depth and mellow what i cant believe isnt hot alcohol. its so well hidden here. there is even some hops in the finish of this one, more than just the requisite english bittering hops, i get a dried straw and corn husk character from them, in addition to just enough bitterness to balance some of the left over sugars in the finish of this. complex and woody, this is a great example of firestone walkers ability to barrel age beers. tons of the whiskey character comes through, and i like the coppery sweet caramel malt. a real treat to drink, it warms up well, and i think its different than what we usually expect from barleywine.","StonedTrippin","Jul 20, 2014"

Firestone Walker beers are rarely available outside of the West Coast, much less a reserve series like the Double DBA, so you may only ever get one chance to taste it barring a move to California (though it’d probably be worth the move). All of the flavors in this beer work in perfect harmony to create a drink that sips like a liquid dessert, but without being too sweet or overbearing. Drink it when the air outside is chilly, and let the warm, roasted flavors wrap you up like a blanket.","Louisville-Beer-Reviews","Jun 20, 2014"

There’s a strong, bright glow to the orange to light brown hued liquid, needed given the high level of particulate floating about inside (bottle stood up for weeks), plenty of widely dispersed bubbles as well, looks like a lot of activity in the glass. The nose is balanced and does not betray excessive alcohol presence, a good underlying roastiness stiffens its nostril presence so it’s not overly sugary, still no lack of molasses, caramelized brown sugar, butterscotch, at the same time you get green apple, fig, golden raisin, spiced orange peel and a heavy floral musk, you get more lightly metallic earthiness at it warms, easy as she goes. In the mouth it’s medium-bodied and likewise smooth and flows effortlessly, not looking to make a huge display of itself. More leafy herbal qualities here, bready like challah bread or breakfast rolls. Fruitier with apricot, peach, cherry mixed in with the fig, raisin, date base. Chocolate truffle, toffee, butterscotch, cream soda give it the desired appeal, no sugar bomb. The carbonation could be considered mildly on the high side for the style, not obvious but rock steady and adds to its overall freshness. More for those who want a food friendly version of the style than an experience unto itself. (Proprietor's Reserve Series #002, 2013)","farrago","Feb 16, 2014"

The mouth feel, butter pecan ice cream melting slowly in a porcelain bowl. Coconut spreads across the mouth, the booze warms the tongue, imaginary nuts, shelled and crushed , delicately rise to the surface. Orange toffee desert surfaces at the finish of the swallow.

Although the barrel smells and tastes are fairly forward, they don't overwhelm to make it too boozy. For a 12 percenter, this goes down so smoothly and easy.

They took their flagship beer, DBA(Double Barrel Ale), doubled the recipe and aged in a mix of neutral oak and mixed spirit barrels. What comes out of these barrels, is a bit of an anomaly; Im not sure how Firestone managed to take a 12.5% 'Imperial Special Bitter' and still have it drink like a heavy ESB, with out it even verging into English Barleywine territory. This beer isn't their most complex Barrel Aged beer, but it certainly drinks the easiest. The low profile malts really allow the barrels to shine. I can't say I've had something quite like this.

I had a bottle of this when it was released...eh? Few times has aging a beer resulted in such beneficial returns. The appearance is a lovely garnet color, and rather clear. Some lacing is left by the rather light tan head. Aroma is interesting, the barrel has faded almost completely and what is left is a port like quality. Kind of fig like dried fruit thing. The flavor pops. Smooth. There is still barrel in the flavor. Fruity, caramel, toffee, all of the great flavors you would expect from an English strong ale. Oh wait this is an American strong ale? Who listed it as such? The surprise of this beer is that it is soft, balanced, and meshes with itself. Not cloying, not sweet, really great. This beer is full on the palate, it does not burn, it is not cloying. Remember this ale is around a year old now.","pmlondrigan","0"

There's some apricot, coconut, sugar cane, almonds and cotton candy. The taste is sweet and luxurious. It's pretty much a delicious barleywine with light barrel notes. I'm mostly getting vanilla and a light woodiness from the barrel-aging. There's some fairly subtle bourbon in the background, but it meshes into the other notes quite nicely. Some booze in the aroma, but it mostly just warms up the palate once you take a sip. The mouthfeel is smooth and thick, but it never got cloying for me. This is one of the best barrel-aged beers that I've had from FW, probably my second favorite after Sticky Monkey (? - one of the barleywines that was used in a recent FW anniversary beer).

4.42,3,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"My vote would be to call this a ""Quadruple Barrel Ale", as ""Double Double"" sounds either redundant or too close to a Jeopardy! bonus. This stuff pours a clear sunrise garnet topped by a finger of light khaki foam. The nose comprises vanilla, light oak, light molasses, fig, brown sugar, a touch of wheated bourbon, maple syrup, and sweet toffee. Yup, malts are the name of the game here, and they're out in full regalia. The taste follows very closely in lock-step, but the fig seems to have dropped out a bit, and the oak has gotten bulkier. Still, an awesome complexity reigns. The body is a stolid medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a smooth feel. Overall, a damn fine brew, one that comes across similarly t a mild oloroso or muscatel sherry. Gotta say, I was more than pleasantly surprised with how well this sat with me...","TMoney2591","Oct 23, 2012"

Medium bodied with a silky, creamy mouth feel. This is an interesting take on a strong ale, with the malt body noticeable lighter than a barrel aged barleywine or stout, but the malt sits in the background just enough to showcase the other great flavors. Another ale that needs caution because it so pleasant to sip, but packs a punch. Another Firestone Walker gem.

Dry toasted oak/earthy wood along with silky vanilla and toasted coconut flavors tone down the spicy bourbon heat but there's still plenty of sweet spirit flavor. Again, I'm not picking up much hop bitterness but there's a substantial malt backbone underneath the strong barrel flavors. Sweet caramel malt along with toffee, nut, bread, biscuit and subtle light fruit notes. At first there's some strong warmth/alcohol heat in the finish but once the palate adjust, the high ABV is decently masked, making this complex sipper easier to drink than expected.","corby112","Sep 17, 2012"

Two fingers or so of bone colored foam crown the beer, and both head retention and lacing are just average. The nose is beyond spectacular. Aromas of butterscotch, burnt sugar, vanilla, oak, and coconut are bolstered by just a hint of bourbon. That boozy bourbon is a little more front and center for the favor profile. There's still a strong foundation of caramel, vanilla, and burnt sugar in the opening of each sip, but some of the nice secondary notes from the nose are drowned out, at least partially, by the lightly alcoholic bourbon finish. The finish is full and a little rich, but without crossing the line and becoming syrupy. I've come to expect excellence from Firestone Walker, especially in their lineup of bottle releases. Double Double Barrel Ale, while drinking just a little hot right now is a worthy addition to the set. I'll be laying a few down to age for sure.","axeman9182","Beers"

A nice scent of oak/whiskey with warming. A beautiful nose. Taste wise, this delivers, in small sips, it's a huge beer. Pretty simple cold, with deep caramel, toffee, toasted malt, warming brings out the whiskey/oak and coconut. The English appeal is large and in charge. Feel is smooth and just a bit of booze shows towards the end. Carbonation is barely there, if at all.

The head, like all FW brews, subsides nearly immediately. Vibrant notes of coconut, honey, caramel, and bourbon comprise the aroma. The mouthfeel is so soft, creamy, and full that it takes on a life of its own. There's just enough scrubbiness on the top to balance. The mouthfeel is so complimentary to the gestalt of the beer. The flavor, while easily describable, does not lend itself to words for adequate appraisal of how good it really is. A flawlessly engineered combination of bourbon oak, caramel, and honey causes one to be thankful to have had the good fortune to experience it. It finishes with the most perfectly smooth coconut and butter, and, finally, just a hint of alcohol warmth. This may be the best beer I've ever had.","DocJitsu","Jul 26, 2012"

4.09,-4.7,3.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Pours a slightly murky dark brown with a foamy beige head that settles to small dots of foam on top of the beer. Small dots of lace also form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, brown sugar, caramel, vanilla, wood, and bourbon. Taste is much the same with the bourbon really coming through in the aftertaste. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with a great smell but I think it needs to sit for a little while for the flavors to mesh together a bit better.","UCLABrewN84","Jul 23, 2012"

3.61,-15.9,4,3,4,3.5,3.5,"Poured from a bomber into a pint glass, the beer pours with a thick, foamy, dense, off-white head and a crystal clear ruby-copper coloring that is infested with bubbles, a sign of the high carbonation. The beer has caramel sweet aromas, mixed with cut grass and semi-sour notes. Also, slightly toasted characteristics are present. The flavors are toasted, both caramel malty sweet and a hint of bitter hops. Everything has a toasted feel to it. There is also a hint of dark chocolate buried way in the background. The beer itself is dry and crisp in mouth, and the aftertaste is slightly sour and dry. The finish is quick, and there is little to no linger in mouth, making this an easy one to continue to drink. Flavors lack a little body and staying power, and there are other Strong Ales I would lean towards.","GarthDanielson","Jan 03, 2011"

4.21,-1.9,4,4.25,4.25,4,4.25,"I think I prefer the garden variety version of this one; Double Double Barrel is taking a good, sessionable beer and kicking it up in ABV. Which sort of ruins its sessionability. On second thought, this is more or less a barleywine (and not really an ""imperial special bitter", as the label asserts), so why not? Fine piece of work from Firestone.","charlzm","0"
4.2,-2.1,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Pours a lightly cloudy dark orange/brown, decently thick off white head forms, quickly settles to a thin ring around the glass, some lace spots stick. Smell is nice, very malty, caramel and raisin, dark fruit, oak and bourbon, some vanilla, earthy, almost herbal hoppiness to it, some alcohol but decently hidden. Taste is similar, huge and malty, toffee, raisins, alcohol, bourbon, oak and vanilla, nice dark fruit, again an herbal bitterness that makes me think of this as more an imperial ESB than a barleywine, nicely balanced in the finish. Mouthfeel is full bodied with low to medium carbonation, a sipper but pretty smooth considering whats going on in it. I liked this one.","Viggo","Aug 15, 2009"
