"Overall, the beer is a pretty interesting barleywine that was definitely worth its cost. Highly recommended."
"Gorgeous turbid port hued amber. thin head.Aroma of plums, nuts, rich yeast. Complex flavor of dark fruit, wood, vanilla with some hot booziness. Soft mouthfeel with some carbonation. Overall, a very tasty Barleywine."

"not a style of beer i usually gravitate towards, but this one is supreme in its class, maybe the best i have had since sucaba, no joke. thanks to thebrewo for procuring this one and bringing it out to me here in colorado. looks the part, super hazy and thick, short khaki foam head settles in a couple minutes, and the aroma just blows my mind. its not the least bit hot, which for this strength is insane, and the bourbon on it is enormous. the vanilla is there, and there is a maple sort of sweetness, but its not over the top. the grain is layered in there beautifully, like some of their other strong beers, it comes in waves and its different in taste and feel from any other. melting toffee, warm vanilla custard, sweet oak, maple candy, golden raisin, dried date, and buttery crumb topping. this beer is amazing, with the bourbon finishing it long and mellow. usually big barleywines arent my thing, but this one is really remarkable. cant say enough about it, and how they continue to impress me each and every time i have a new beer from them. one of the best breweries in the country i have always said, and this is further reinforcement of that notion."
"Poured from a 750ml bottle during a bottle share.  Pours a deep brown purplish color with a full finger of dense creamy tan head. which dissipated quickly leaving a thick out lacing ring throughout the drink.  Aromas of booze, citrus (maybe apple?), bourbon, vanilla and oak.  A nose full.  More like wine than beer.  Tastes of vanilla, oak, caramelized sugars, oak but finishes sweet and boozy.  Definitely apples.  It is dry like a wine.  Very light in the mouth - thin.  Medium carbonation.  Little too dry for my liking but It grew on me.  I only had about 2-3 ounces since it was a bottle share.  Would have liked a full glass to savor and see how it changed as it warmed up.  This one was about 6 months old, aged in a refrigerator.  I would assume it gets better with age but not much.  It was a steep price.  I want to say $22.00 or maybe $23.00.  However, well worth trying."

"Big, boozy and badass...  Just the way I like my English Barleywines....  Lots of bourbon and toffee...  Sticky and sweet...  Loaded with boozy fruits...  Bourbon is big and up front...  F#*king delicious...  Steep price but worth every damn penny...  A sipper that rocks on a cold blustery day...  Might warrant a 5....  Incredibly delicious..."

"Smells of sweet malt/barley, bourbon, some booze and metallic. Tastes of earthy and floral hops, sweet malts, cane sugar, a little bready and dried dark fruits. Excellent beer."

"O - definitely a bit too dry and thin. Ripe apples are slightly less than desireable. Good sweetness, still pretty hot. Was trying to decide if I should go back for more (grabbed two) I think I'm going to sit on the other for 18-24 months and restrain from buying more. Worth trying"

"Bottle from Hop City in Atlanta. Corked and caged 750 ml with the label BQE Q3 2014 on the back. Also see ""Blend #2"" below the barcode. Pours murky amber orange brown with a one finger off-white head with some orange hue that dissipates relatively quickly. Aroma of bourbon, oak, sweet caramel and toffee, and maybe a hint of green apple that makes me wonder if this thing got some bad bacteria in it.Flavor is sweet caramel vanilla bourbon, toasted marshmallow, toffee, molasses, and just a hint of green flavor that still makes me worry this might turn a little sour at some point. Body is big and rich and bordering on syrupy with very low carbonation. A little more carb would probably help this. Overall a nice barleywine with big sweet characteristics and very smooth bourbon. Nicely done overall, with only small qualms here."

"Big thanks to MrKennedy for this lil number, pours a chestnut hue with little carbonation almost flat almost but nice for style and what u expect for an english style, smell straight out bourbon mixed with butterscotch candy I love heaven hill barrels they do amazing things,mouthfeel thick and chewy with minimal carb, tastes start off sweet but the more u get into it fades a little with heaps of butterscotch candy, toffee and caramel and I know it sounds funny but the bittersweet bourbon really adds a touch of balance to the already sweet foundation,overall glad I had now as probably only sweeten with time and thats not my thing very enjoyable cheers."

"Top 5 best barrel-aged English-style Barleywines."
"Overall: I highly recommend the beer. First impressions from looking and smelling the beer might be a bit underwhelming, but after tasting the beer it is clear that this is a gem. The key words I would use to describe this beer are ""smooth"" and ""balanced."" Although it has a strong bourbon flavor, it has a beer to match its intensity. The drinking experience is not hampered by either the presence of a spirit in the beer (via the bourbon barrels) or the fact that it is over 13% ABV. I would buy this again and I recommend it."

"Excellent flavor, but relatively expensive."

"    Best barleywine I've had hands down. In its style as good as East End Gratitude. Goes down way to easy and demands to be sipped and savored. Lush and lovely."
""

"D: Overall, a very solid brew.  I think it lives up to the hype.  A nice example of style.  The soft sweetness, decent complexity, and lack of overdone boozy bite really sold me. (4.25)"
""
""
"D: This was a nice barrel aged barleywine.  It was more sour than I was hoping for, at first, but that faded as it warmed. The scent and taste were delicate and complex, and the body was fantastic. The finish was fairly smooth, but alcohol was notable, so it was better to sip. Would probably age well, but still enjoyable fresh."
""
"Overall: A really good take on an English style Barleywine. Good toasty and fruity malt flavors with just enough bourbon to add a nice kick."

"O:  Wonderful barleywine. Nice flavors and aroma.  Alcohol is very well hidden, and sweetness is controlled and balanced.  A bit expensive, but very enjoyable."

"Beautiful warming effect while the 13.3% remains well hidden. Very sweet, pleasant, and decadent. An excellent Barleywine! My only complaint is the price."

"Tasted exactly what you'd expect a big boozy English Barleywine aged in bourbon barrels to taste like...and that is a very good thing.  Doesn't reinvent the wheel, but it's solid.  Big caramel, fig, dark fruits, vanilla, oak and booze."
"Pours a one-finger dark creme head that fades quickly leaving no lace. Murky brown color. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Bourbon nose and flavor is bourbon, vanilla and alcohol. Nice barleywine. Expensive. $21.99 for a caged & corked 750ml bottle from Big Deal Irving Spofford, NH."

"O: The layered nature of this brew is very nice and it's unbelievable that the alcohol doesn't come through more than a slight bit in the finish. The malts and barrel compliment each other extremely well and makes the drinkability even that much greater. It takes some patience not to drink this down quickly, but you might find yourself on your ass quickly if you don't take your time and sip on it. Very well done by Brooklyn. A truly stand-out beer that will likely slide under the radar. If you're on the edge because of the $20 price point, don't hesitate. This is one purchase you won't regret"
"D: overall this beer is really exceptional and worth seeking out if you are a fan of Brooklyn, a fan of English barleywines, and especially if you like the added complexity brought by aging in used bourbon barrels. like most of Brooklyn's barrel aged stuff, this one is not one note in any sense and the complexity is fantastic."
"O: Big, big and super boozy barleywine. Very malty, very sweet but the huge alcohol burn really cuts it down and keeps it from being overpowering. Somehow this actually improves drinkability. Otherwise pretty much what you'd expect from a bourbon-barrel english barleywine. Lots of sweet caramel and breadiness everywhere."
"O: Overall, very good.  I was afraid it might be infected due to that off tart-like aroma, but luckily it was not.  Quite tasty, and definitely worth a try.  4.25"

"Pours a slightly hazy red Amber color with light off-white foam. Wonderful aroma: alcohol, butter, faint citrus, some notes of oak. Taste is rich and creamy. Warming. Alcohol evaporates on the tongue. A touch of fruitiness. This is a very nice barleywine, and this is a young bottle so it will be interesting to compare a 1 or 2 year old version."

"O: Overall, Great.  Its been a while since I have found a beer that really surprised me and that was partially because it did surprise me to find this after not keeping up with the beer scene recently, and being completely preoccupied with work and a newborn to even know this had been released.  What a great surprise on a Friday night and even more so after tasting !"
""
"O: perhaps a bit too sweet but a fine sipper nonetheless."
"A keeper."
""
"Pours into a snifter a hazed murky kind of brown and orange with a creamy off white half finger head atop.The aromas are not huge but some dark fruit and bourbon start to come into play more as it warms.A nice near chewy feel is great for the style.Dark fruit and bourbon/vanilla at the onset with an ever so slight lactic note in the finish,a fruit cake- like element stands out.English to the hilt and a very good sipping barleywine,Great job and congrats to Garret Oliver!"

"One of the best barleywines I've had, just a tad too sweet, couldn't taste the alcohol"
""

"A sweet yet smooth barrel aged barley wine.  Nice caramel and toffee notes.  The bourbon is light.  The barrel does provide vanilla and a bit of oak.  Could use a year of aging to smooth out the heat."
""
""
"Alcohol very well-hidden, so be careful with this one."
""
"Overall: Good brew but has room for improvement. I will say it's definitely beyond worth buying. I know it's sounds crazy but it is what it is. Spilt it with a friend and enjoy. Salud!"

"A very winey nose with spice, bourbon and vanilla. Pours deep, bright ruby tinted chestnut with a very finely bubbled light tan tinted white foam cap. A big creamy, malty, bourbon palate with traces of vanilla, wine and a light spicy fruitcake sweetness that leaves a little stickiness on the lips. Finishes with a balance between the alcohol, bit malt, bourbon and hop bitterness."
""
""
""
"Balance is maintained with this beer as it avoids being a  boozy or sugary mess and while I give way to hyperbole I must say that this is a well-crafted barleywine that has everything clicking."
""

"O: excellent work with this English-style barleywine - easily the finest offering I've had from Brooklyn Brewing, and as far as my palate memory serves, every bit as enjoyable as King Henry was a couple of years ago. Probably a $20 bottle in these parts, but worth every penny."
"Hand and Seal is a great barrel-aged barleywine, a better example of its style than Black Ops. It's pricey at $20+, but I'm glad I picked up a bottle."
""

"Overall a very good BA Barleywine. Another great beer from the guys up in Brooklyn."
""

"Hand & Seal picks up where Monster left off. An amped up English barleywine base with the added benefit of some time spent in barrels. Some of the best work I've had from Brooklyn."

"D:  Highly drinkable considering the 13%+ ABV. This brew reminds me very much of Firestone Walker Double DBA. Very similar flavor profile, but not as sweet, and a better price point. The flavors are delicious and offer a nice BBA profile with other delicious notes of vanilla and fig. Not complex. Just straightforward flavors that pack a delicious punch."
"25.4oz bottle. Pours a murky dark brownish red with a 1/4 inch of head. Minimal lacing. Big whiff of bourbon along with butterscotch, vanilla, and oak. Smells great. The taste is much like the aroma. Butterscotch, vanilla and bourbon upfront. A nice oakiness throughout. Lots of alcohol warmth but not overly hot. Some dark cherry notes with maybe a hint of cinnamon. Finishes with the bourbon and oak. Malty with a hint of sweetness. Thick, syrupy mouthfeel. This one was pretty pricey, but really good. I look forward to aging one as well. Overall, fantastic."
"I thought this was an amazing barleywine. The pour was a deep hazel/amber with a tan head that sticks to the glass. The smell was full of heavy flavors. Caramel and dark chocolate and then the alcohol and the wood from the casks shine through in the finish. The taste was forcefull to say the least with flavors of alcohol strong in the beginning and then other flavors like the wood and the hops come through in the end to make a surprisingly refreshing barleywine. Would highly recommend."
"Its long and savory finish is suggestive of port and sherry in its intense flavors and warming effects. As it overwhelms the senses and the mind, a dessert-like satisfaction sets in and begs for strong stilton cheese and walnuts in accompaniment."
