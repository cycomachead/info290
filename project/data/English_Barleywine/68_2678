The aroma and flavour are very sweet and fruity, with a subtle hop character that has probably faded somewhat. The bitterness is pitch-perfect. Lovely body - silky smooth. My only complaint is that it's perhaps a bit too sweet, but without a fresh bottle to compare it to I can't judge the extent of the aging process. Nonetheless, a big beer that commands your attention - worth sampling if you have the chance.","jazzyjeff13","Feb 09, 2014"

Taste is very sweet from the candy sugars, definitely some sweet malts that seem to be malt forward but as many barlywines it is pretty sweet. Mouthfeel is medium thin or maybe a tiny bit thicker.

Pours very hazy dark reddish brown color with a small cream colored head with good retention, that reduces to a thin lace cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of caramel, molasses, toffee, toast, raisin, prune, biscuit, light chocolate, light roast, floral, and toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark malt and fruity notes; with good strength. Taste of caramel, molasses, toast, toffee, biscuit, nuttiness, raisin, prune, chocolate, light roast, floral, light pepper, and toasted earthiness. Minimal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, molasses, toast, toffee, biscuit, nuttiness, chocolate, raisin, prune, light roast, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Awesome complexity and balance of dark malt and fruity notes; with zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very creamy and slick mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent barleywine! Great complexity and balance of dark malt and fruity flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Aug 19, 2013"

I will go with a good taste here - lots of intricacies in the flavour and nose, but hard to drink. It would be like biting into a beautiful filet mignon and tasting smoked baby backs.

4.12,7.3,4,4.5,4,4,4,"2008 vintage. 7oz bottle poured into a snifter. Thanks! Brown and opaque with reddish highlights near the edges. A finger of tan froth lingers for a minute. In the nose I find a blend of toffee and caramel with a whisper of chocolate. There's some brown sugar and earthy hop character. On the whole, it's well balanced and not overly aggressive. As the label states, there is a bit of licorice, which is an unusual attribute for the style. The malt profile is rich, complex, and inviting. There's a bit of umami character and light oxidation. The quality of the flavor mirrors that of the aroma, though bitterness is a bit stronger than the nose suggests. Dark toffee blends with dried date, caramel, brown sugar, and a lower moderate bitterness that attacks the back of my tongue. Alcohol is restrained, considering it's above 10%. The beer is upper medium in body with upper medium carbonation. The mouthfeel is smooth and sticky with pleasant alcohol warming on the palate. All told, a nice American Barleywine that displays balance and graceful aging.","HopHead84","Jul 29, 2012"

A nice latticework of lace forms around the glass on the drink down. Smell is very malty with some subtle caramel/toffee aromas and alcohol. Taste is of malt, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, and citrus zest on the finish. There is a very mild citrus zest bitterness on the palate that quickly fades after each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel.

4.18,8.9,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"MOREY’S BOTTOM LINE: Probably the most balanced Barleywine that I’ve ever had. They can be too sweet, too thin, too hoppy, medicinal, and often times too heavy on the alcohol. Horn Dog has just the right amount of sweetness and you can’t taste the ABV at all. It’s easy to see why this one continues to win medals. This and Raging Bitch are easily my two favorite beers from Flying Dog. Get some.","Morey","Apr 28, 2012"

Taste follows with caramel malt, dark fruit, well integrated. Finish is smooth, but with faded hops and a distinct alcohol burn. Medium bodied. Hops I noted in the earlier review are faded. A decent English stiyle barleywine, but this 2 year old bottle has faded in flavor, but not mitigated the alcohol flavor. I think I prefer this one fresh.

Taste is very full, with lots of raisins, figs, and pears. Is this really 10% ABV? Not hot at all, could drink this all night long, for better or worse. I have to say this is one of the better barleywines that I have tried. Flying Dog brews some good beers, but this is my favorite. I have had the 2010 and 2011 vintages, but sitting in the cellar for over two years has really done this brew good.

The beer poured out as a deep amber color with a light yellowish colored head. The lacing was pretty thick at first, then it died off. The smell was sweet, hoppy and had a hefty amount of booze on the nose. The taste was of sweet roasted caramel and alcohol up front that faded into a bitter hop aftertaste. The mouthfeel was pretty thick which is fine by me. The overall outlook I have on this is that it's a pretty decent barley wine.

Finishes with a lingering biter booziness. The high ABV of this beer is definitely apparent and there are some bold tastes in this one, but overall it's pretty enjoyable.

Only a subtle tinge of hops - mostly malt, alcohol, and Sweeet! Poured rm temp into a chalice it looks beautiful. The head dissipates quickly leaving an 1/8 inch bit of bubbles on top that stays there for the rest of the drink. Solid lacing. Smells like weak Sambuca (weak on licorice - not alcohol!) and cocoa butter, like it says on the bottle. The taste is surprisingly sweet - a mainstream barley-wine. Unlike it says on the bottle, it is not big or robust. It is tame on taste, straight-forward on complexity, and sweet! I mean, it's not a sugar bomb, but it's sweet for the style. It tastes like liquid alcoholic candy, not a bad thing for some - not what I was hoping for from the makers of Raging Bitch. Maybe I should try some at a lower temp. Has a touch of spice as it lingers in the back of my throat. As a side note, the carbonation is spot on. I love the mouth feel.

3.55,-7.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Another Flying Dog revisit, though I can barely even remember drinking it the first time. It pours a clear dark ruby topped by a finger of dirty off-white foam. The nose comprises buttery biscuit, caramel, light leek, and a generally mild mix of pine and cilantro. The taste holds notes of caramel, orange peel, dark greens, and raisins. The light spiciness of the greens doesn't seem to meld entirely well with the much stronger sweetness. The body is a hefty medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a chunky-ish feel. Overall, a nice b-wine, though I'm not sure the elements really come together all that successfully. I don't dislike this beer, but I'm pretty sure I'm not gonna be seeking out very often in the future.","TMoney2591","Apr 12, 2011"

Warm chocolate & dry nuts notes in mouth, overall presence of alcohol. A litte burning sensation hidden by dry sweet bitterness. Rum, dark fruits on the aftertaste, caramel & molasses too.

Huge malt bomb of a nose - figs, prunes, molasses, brown sugar and a distinct bready quality. Taste consistent with nose; however, a slight candied quality also comes out in the flavor profile.

Head is large from a semi-aggressive pour, recedes slowly into a thick ring 'round the entire glass. Nice lacing present, though it slowly sinks down into the brew. Smell on this is a bit on the alcoholic side. Very malty and sweet scent. Surely not something I'm used to, but is not entirely unpleasant. Taste is strange on this one. Has a sort of bittersweetness to it, followed up swiftly with an alcoholic overtone. I suppose there could be hints of chocolate and black licorice, though it is difficult for my palate to discern. Horn Dog has a surprisingly light feel about it, for such a ""heavy"" brew. Just right with the carbonation, has a slick feel that goes down maybe too easily. Good drinkability for a good brew.","BabyBastard","Apr 12, 2010"

Very malty sweet aroma nearly orange-like with licorice notes and alcohol. Taking a sip it has a big alcohol presence in the front, malt sweetness cross the middle and finishes quite crisp, bitter and warming. Lingering taste of molasses and slight bit of hops. The hop character is noticable, not dominating by any means. Medium mouthfeel with this one, lightly carbed.","stakem","Sep 30, 2009"

No, it wasn't heavily hopped, not at all. But it tasted pretty good with molasses dominating. Poured medium brown with red tints, one finger head and minimal retention. The aroma was sweetish.

Color is dark and rosy, with just a small amount of white laced heading. Some brandy whiffs come up first, along with some chocolate and stone fruit, none of which are very pronounced. Plum, molasses, bitter hops and alcohol come through in the taste. This beer does not seem to be trying to hide the fact that it is a bit hot and heavy. This beer took me the better part of an hour to finish, which is the way it should be with a beer this size. Put this one with some heavy blue cheese, or simply have it as an after dinner treat.

Taste is a hint of sweet malt up front, an earthy, oaky middle, and a dry finish with a hint of alcohol burn. Mouthfeel is rich, low carbonation. This is a very good English Barleywine, it isn't a hop bomb assault like some American styles (not that there is anything wrong with either style). The drinkability is good, though with such high alcohol it does come through in the taste a bit and makes this a slow sipper. Definitely worth trying for fans of malty beers.","tronester","Aug 28, 2009"

The aroma called to mind the smell of sweet wort, with potent dark fruit and citrus, underscored by a hint of alcohol potency. However the taste didn't underscore the alcoholic potency at all. The flavor was syrupy sweet, but not with an annoyingly potent finish, like in most barleywines. The texture was certainly thick, but normal for this style.

Then the alcohol flavors and warmth kicks in and it finishes somewhat bitter while still maintaining the sweetness from the caramel malts and some of the fig, raisin flavors. The mouthfeel is a bit thick and sticky sweet, but the carbonation in the beer makes in creamy and smooth. Pretty good mouthfeel.

The result is not bad at all - slick and enticingly fruitiness balanced by a thick and rich dark malty base. But for a strong ale at this calibre, with this level of density, and a semi-full sweetness, it'd better be sipped in small quantity like a dessert (barley) wine, otherwise the alcoholic effect can easily and quickly makes its presence felt.","wl0307","Jul 26, 2009"

Tastes were complex - toasted grains, bready, caramel, chocolate, and anise with notes of vanilla, some faint citrus hoppiness and white pepper on the finish. Mouth-feel was creamy and rather thick.

There are many after hits of the malt notes after you swallow which is actually the best flavor. This is a nice factor because you feel and taste the malt notes instead of hop based bitterness.

For a second I thought I was drinking a super mild Angel's Share. The first one I had of this batch seemed to have a higher sugar content. This bottle is really mellow and mildly carbonated. This is for sure an English style BW because it's super mellow compared to it's american, mostly west coast, counterparts. Very little, if not, any hops. I am really pleased with this beer. Although it's American brewed, it has made me want to search for authentic English BWs. Aging these 12oz bottles could do wonders and I recommend doing so.","100floods","Sep 28, 2008"

If you like thick, heavy drinks then you'll enjoy it. If not, you might not be able to take much more after one of these. It is, however, a little less heavy/dense than say Weyerbacher's blithering idiot. If you're a fan of the style, then its good. If you're not familiar with the style this may be an ok introduction.

The hell with this I thought, unless this beer is awesome, I'm just going to pour it out and move on. And then I looked at the glass. Beautiful craggy head, more at home on a stout than a barley wine. The clour is also lovely red and deep brown. So I tasted it, and there it was, everything I love about a barley wine, malty and sweet, but still with a sting of hops. And alcoholic in a very tasty way as well. The mouth feel is full and pleasant, like a melty caramel. The only thing I didn't like was the aroma, kind of wort smelling in not a good way.

Mouthfeel was thick and syrupy. Very satisfying for a cold and rainy night. Drinkability was excellent. The label on the back of the bottle stated an ABV of 10.3 percent, but damned if I could detect it. The alcohol is hidden very well with this beer.

The alcohol is pretty apparent, and once again, not hidden as well as others. This is not a big problem, as it lets me know what I'm getting myself into. Mouth-feel is light to medium bodied.

Every bit of that 10.5% ABV is out there asserting itself. It's pretty bad. Hang in there, the rewards are coming. You get more sweet raisin bread and vinous overtones and less alcohol with every degree of warming. The alcoholic aspect never really goes away, though. We've all seen 10% concealed much better than this. Sweet and sticky, but not overarchingly so - I'm definitely getting *some* earthy hop bittering action keeping the sweetness of the strong malt bill under relative control. Somewhat odd thin feel for such a substantial beer. Hate to be a broken record, but I concur with others when I want to say that this barleywine skates on the edges of brilliance without ever really crossing the line.

It's a mellow mix of sweet malts, lots of banana, dark ripe fruits with little to no hop presence which is fine for style. Compared to other EBWs, this one doesn't get cloying, but rather the alcohol seems to keep it in balance along with the smooth complexity of malts.

Average body with some medium-low carbonation. Definitely not something that I feel the need to revisit anytime soon.","Phyl21ca","May 30, 2007"

Big caramel/toffee aroma with significant fruit character and a touch of bready yeast and some alcohol. Hops are muted and seem to be more earthy and floral at this point, with just a hint of orange. Wow, this is thick and heavy. Hop bitterness seems weaker than it is due to the strong malt sweetness. There's a lot of caramel, with milder notes of toffee, freshly ground grain, and hints of chocolate. Fruity flavour is more attenuated, mostly prunes and a little raisin. Hop flavour provides some depth, but is definitely not the star of the show. Low carbonation and just short of sticky. Mild alcohol warmth. This is certainly in the English BW camp. Solid malting makes this a good offering. The alcohol is tamed by the sweetness, making for a fairly drinkable barleywine. I enjoyed this and would recommend it to those seeking something more in the English style.","DrJay","Feb 10, 2007"

This beer is quite deceptive because the flavor does a good job of hiding the high alcohol content in the taste buds (but it does do a good job of warming your insides)..

The beer's body, when not backlit, appears a mysterious deep ruby-brow. This is a very dark ale, and a light behind penetrates just enough to produce a fiery glow. Deep and rich malt greets the nose, as well as juicy cherries, molasses, and toffee. The taste is somewhat raisiny, with port coming through, and a whole slew of dark fruits, as well. Very sweet, and quite alcoholic. I can't comment on hop flavor or bitterness, but I imagine they are here, keeping the malt from absudity. Somewhat dry at the very start of the sip, but this doesn't last. Carbonation is almost non-existent, and the huge body leads to a syrupy thick mouthfeel.

Taste is cherry yogurt, brandy soaked raisins, over caramel malt with a light herbal hop finish. Mouthfeel is creamy and luxurious yet not chewy enough to bog you down. The alcohol is there, but there's enough complexity in the nose and palate to balance it out.

Flavor is similar with dark malt notes dominating, flavors of currant, plum, blackberry and grape with a sweet background of caramel and molasses, followed by a floral and mineraly hops flavor that quickly segues into a sweet and alcohol ridden finish. Mouthfeel is adequate though slightly light for the style and the alcohol is very noticeable. And drinkability is average.

Lacing was very good, although the carbonation was quite limited. The aroma was typically English. Restrained, earthy, and spicy hops in the nose were tempered by fig, and vanilla scents. The taste was malt driven, and was primarily sweet and buttery. Dry fruit flavors of fig, raisins, and a bit of toffee, was mixed in with soy saltiness, and a chalky mineral dryness. The hop bitterness was not match for the sweet palette, but did provide a decent backdrop at the end of each sip.

4.35,13.3,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Quite possibly the best beer from Flying Dog, Horn Dog barleywine offers a deep mahogany body capped by a short head of creamy ivory foam. The head retention is limited, probably due at least in part to its 10.5% abv, and it leaves little lace about the glass. The nose delivers a soft blend of yeasty, berry-like fruitiness and caramelish (even chocolatey) malt. It's soft and lightly creamy in the mouth with a very fine, moderate carbonation and medium-full body. In keeping with the English barleywine style, malt dominates the flavor profile; accented by hop flavors and anchored by bitterness. Its malt is caramelish and subtly chocolatey, and even has a cusp of roastiness to it. Yeasty fruitiness and some leafy, subtly piney, and fruity hops help to round it and give it depth while a firm bitterness grounds it and leads to a dry, lingering finish. What's so nice about this barleywine, however, is that it's not overdone - although the alcohol is a bit high for the style and does become apparent halfway through the bottle.

Yeah, it's a barleywine... and I like barleywine alot, but either the hops or the alcohol are out of control, in my opinion, though. If you're a hophead, then you might enjoy this. Me, I like a balance between my mad malt and mad hops. There's some vinous, fruity malt character, and then the hops kick in, just overwhelming the palate.

Head hung around for a reasonable amount of time, and laced ok. Aroma is kind of busy with a malty, somewhat fruity, definitely alcohol-y. Makes things interesting for the nose. Taste is sweetly malty, then fades into a boozy warmth that carries through the mouth and down the gullet. Mouthfeel is extremely smooth for a barleywine, which scares me, and drinkability is excellent, from both a multiple serving and interest-piquing viewpoint. The best Flying Dog I've had, by far. Not sure if that's saying much, but this was a good brew.","ppoitras","Jun 21, 2004"

Smells of fruit sweetness with a bit of alcohol and a touch of hops, fairly pleasant smelling overall. The sweetness starts the taste out here before a hop bitterness and alcohol kicked in for the finish. This is defiantly a thick barley wine with a great mouthfeel.

It starts with a light hop kick followed by a quick surge of malt sweetness, then it ends with another hop kick followed by a light alchohol burn.

Aroma is of subdued malts rendering some fairly heavy molasses tones mixed with some plum and raisin and bits of smokey-like toffee. Warmth subsides within as some brandy-like alcohol seeps into the nose. Taste has more of the same with a slightly weakened front end but fills up with a dark fruity malty presence across the palate where plum, molasses, and toffee leak into a substraining mix of lightly textured chocolate spices and sugared candy caramel towards the finish. The chocolate tones are light and late with a nice little effective dryness thats favorable and welcomed. Flavors need to be bolder, heavier, richer, what have you, there's not much happening and it's length is tempered. It's feel is comparable with a good medium body and texture and has just enough edge in what could be justified as a hop profile of somekind and its warming of alcohol is sufficiently present within bigger gulps with a slight stinging twinge. A bit tame by my standards, but not bad.","tavernjef","Feb 27, 2004"

Mouthfeel: Full bodied so very full great to sip don't try to handle to much big ol' mouthfeel.

Pronounced butterscotch along with burnt toffee hit the nose upfront, then are ensued by pungent, earthy hop and searing ethanol heat. Mellow cocoa notes and bubblegum esters surface as the beer breathes. Buttery brittle and caramelized flavors are the dominant malt components. Permeating alcohol presence melds with residual sweetness to lend a black licorice and pepper undertone. Mild hop bitterness and singed biscuit surface mid palate and attempt dryness, but are readily overrun by rich, sugary caramel. Understated earthy, woody hop combines with static alcohol lending a burning, ozone like sensation. Full bodied, with a viscous, creamy, luscious mouthfeel. Sour plum esters arise late and add a sublt tart contrast. Finishes with palate enveloping ethanol heat, buttery and oaky bourbon notes and dryish unsweetened baker's chocolate. A unique, raw barleywine with assertive sweetness and marginal hop bitterness. Heavy on the palate and a true belly warmer.

Dark reddish-brown body. Big smell of coffee malts, raisin and plum flavors, very chewy, with a subtle hop balance.

Aromas are of alcohol-soaked dark fruit and something else...tough to identify. For some reason, ""murky"" comes to mind. Almost an earthen-""dusty"" scent. It wasn't unpleasant, just a strange combination of aromas. Flavor is rather uninspired. Starts out with a good dose of dark fruits mixed with the medicinal alcohol flavor but began to break down. Almost a gritty...chalky flavor sets in. Not a hoppy bitterness, though. Finished with a semi-sourness that unfortunately lingered on the palate. Mouthfeel was very thin for the style. Low-medium body. Drinkability is decent. Alcohol is present, but not oppressive. A nice beer to drink on this cold winter's night.

Taste is not as sweet as the aroma would indicate, and has plenty of fruit and woody qualities. Blackberries, oak, plum, etc. Finish is sweet with a hint of hops.

I've had lighter bodies on some. Nice fruity flavors, big malt, copious hopping, and a great smooth carbonation. Almost silky, and i think the six months I've held on to this beer has helped.

Hops are there as well, but not in hop head lover's quantities. It's very complex, and the mouthfeel was quite hearty, but not cloying.

Their is also some slight fruity tartness in the taste and the brew finishes with lingering sweetness and some slight alcohol that warms you throughout.  The brew is very creamy and has some somewhat chewy qualities to it as well which make it very drinkable and leaves the mouth wanting more after each sip.
