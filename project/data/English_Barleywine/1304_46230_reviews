"Overall: For its age, I'm amazed how well it help up. Nice and mellow but still have some pronounced alcohol in there. Very good beer."

"Pours a deep mahogany color with a thin fizzy head that dissipated immediately; no lacing.  The nose was so complex, big grain nose, toasted malt, brown sugar and dried dark fruit (plums, raisins), molasses.  The taste seemed to be falling apart for me, maybe a sign of the again and reminded me mostly of overripe fruits, maybe even rotting a bit. with lots of plums, brown bread dough, molasses, treacle.  Lots of boozy bourbon but smooth with almost no alcohol.  I would like to try this beer fresh."

"22 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 12/3/2013. Pours nearly opaque dark brown color with a 1 finger fairly dense tan head with poor retention, that reduces to a thin ring pretty quickly. Some minimal spotty lacing on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of raisin, prune, fig, date, caramel, molasses, toffee, toast, brown bread, bourbon, oak, light vanilla, light tobacco, and oak/toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast, and oak barrel notes; with good strength. Taste of big caramel, molasses, toffee, toast, brown bread, raisin, prune, fig, date, bourbon, oak, leather, tobacco, light vanilla, light chocolate, and oak/toasted earthiness. Slight oaky bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toffee, toast, molasses, brown bread, raisin, prune, fig, date, bourbon, oak, leather, tobacco, and oak/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Outstanding complexity and balance of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast, and oak barrel flavors; with zero cloying sweetness present after the finish. Light carbonation and full bodied; with a very creamy, fairly slick, and lightly syrupy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with a small-moderate warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome barrel aged English barelywine style. All around great complexity and balance of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast, and oak barrel flavors; and fairly smooth to sip on for the huge ABV. A highly enjoyable offering, but I feel that the base beer is more impressive than this one."
"Overall, this is quite an impressive beer.  I quite honestly cannot remember the last time that I have enjoyed a beer this much.  This is a very complex and killer brew.  You really have to sit down, sip, and savor this one.  With a 14% bill, sipping and relishing should probably be part of the option anyway.  The Pelican is a heck of a brewery, and this is way more than a heck of a brew.  Can't wait to taste my other bottle in a couple of years or so and compare the difference."

"Tastes of bready, toffeeish, slightly creamy malts, with a very clean mouthfeel to it, until the Bourbon enters the scene, bringing a wooden, slightly dry alcohol bite with it, as well as a vanilla note, mingling with molasses, nougat and stale, oakie coffee. The boozy Bourbon bite is teeth numbing dominant, while getting toned down by glazed toffee and honey, building up a great balance between wooden booziness and caramelized sweetness. Due to the surprisingly convenient balance, there are many subtle flavors detectable, such as an acrid coffee tang, resulting from the rich Bourbon, paired against toasty, glazed vanilla, getting accompanied by hazelnuts. Has a hot dryness to it during the finish, enveloping the dried fruits, sweet malts, with molasses providing a long lasting aftertaste among the leathery, wooden Bourbon."
""
"2014 vintage poured into snifter. No head at all. Smells of dark fruits dipped in bourbon. More of a bourbon than a beer. Too boozy for my taste, had to drain pour half the bottle but still a world class beer. I wish it had just a tad bit more carbonation and the alcohol wasn't as apparent."
""
""
""
"2012 Vintage, never tried fresh but this is still pretty boozy (which I don't normally mind).  Still very good."
""
"I'd love to try a '12 or '13 of this, or try a '14 in a few years. Now, it's slightly too hot, and needs a bit of time to mellow out. However, even at this stage, its still delicious and clearly well-crafted."
"An incredible balance of malts and oak barrels.  I could curl up with this on a cold night and be happy all night.  I have always loved this, and just a treat to drink again."

"O: I appreciate this beer for it's bold qualities throughout. I am not a barleywine guy, but I love bourbon. This delivers the best of the beer and bourbon world, making a barleywine that I find highly drinkable."
""
"This beer is just a tad too sweet"
"The beer was Way to sweet."
"Smelled of dried dog food and didn't taste much better.  Perhaps I'm missing something here, or I had a bad bottle.  Nevertheless, I certainly prefer others."
""
""
"Thick, meaty, sweet, delicious, perfect barleywine. Waaaaaay better than expected when ordered on draft at Belmont Station."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Thanks to Brian for the tasting!  This beer is exceptional.  From its dark color and perfectly sweet aroma to its complex flavor profile and balanced finish, it is a winner.  I look forward to many more opportunities to sample the Mother of all Storms!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A good barley wine but one that is heavy on the hops.  I would give it a higher score were it more balanced."
""
""
""
""
"Consumed fresh on release in 2013 and 2014. I'm waiting to see how the 2013 will be with some more age on it. More like an old ale along the lines of HOTD Adam except bigger, tastier and more complex with the bba and a nice dry finish. Takes the best of stout characteristics, fruityness of a barleywine and oxidized characteristic of a barrel aged old ale. Evaporates on the tun. Full review to follow."

"Mother Of All Storms is a top tier barrel aged English barleywine. This one is well worth a hunt/chase. Very glad that I procurred multiples."

"Nietzsches_Horse really nails it: a dessert beer if ever there was one, this beer is so intensely sweet that it teeters between being undrinkably sweet and thoroughly delicious. Sipper, sipper, sipper."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"More, perhaps, than any other beer I've yet tried, this one manages to walk the fine line between being utterly undrinkable (on account, mostly, of its intense sweetness) and being utterly delicious (on account of its rich, malty flavors).  A memorable offering, but if you have it in a bottle, plan on sharing that bottle one or two ways if you can."

"I think the shining aspect of this beer is how easy it drinks. Beguilingly smooth. I have to say, I think my local Marble barleywine gives this a run for it's money. Either way, I look forward to aging a couple for future consumption."
""
""
"Dark reddish-black, head quickly faded to a ring.  Smells of molasses, vanilla, oak, and a little boozy.  Tastes how I anticipated from the smell, but better.  Same flavors as in the aroma, with some dark dried fruits in there as well.  Sweet, but not overly sweet.  Exceptionally smooth, hides its alcohol well (though clearly a sipper).  Lived up to the hype and then some."

"Overall, this is an amazing beer. Though, it looses points in my mind for the texture. It's too viscous for me, though I understand developing this sort of flavor profile has its drawbacks. I can't imagine how much grain went into making this!"

"This was an absolute standout at last night's beer share, and as a result I still vividly remember the flavour the next morning.  It is full of toasted coconut and quite a bit of roastiness for a BW, and breaks to a big salted toffee back end.  Smell was vanilla, coconut, and general sweetness. This was almost cloyingly sweet, but still delicious."
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a decidedly, smooth, rich, balanced, well-crafted, English Barley-wine that is perched atop the barley-wine food chain. It is easy drinking and dangerous. I have not had a comparable barley-wine."

"Mouthfeel: Medium-full mouthfeel, appropriate carbonation, sticky with residual sugars. Again, good. Overall, this probably would have been better a year ago, but still has retained much of its quality. A bit oxidized, but does not affect the beer too much overall. I have a 2011 that I will open very soon and hope it has faded a bit less than this."

"O-one of the benchmarks for the style, a great sipper which will mellow nicely over time"
""

"Overall, this is the mother of all mothers of beer, and the anticipation and excitement levels were obviously through the roof. Contrasting against some of these whales that may taste the same as its top-tiered brethren stylistically, this is a sure standout for barleywines. As soon as you open the bottle, the aromas hit the room from corner to corner, enticing you with every breath. The flavoring is extremely pure and full, with absolutely nothing offensive about it. There is almost no aftertaste, due in part to the thick coating of sugar left around the mouth, but more so due to the fact that the blend is so utterly perfected. If you’ve had Westy 12 you’ll know what we mean when we say that this should be the basic prototype for the style. There are no bells or whistles you’re not expecting, but rather you are presented with something so pure and unabashed. We keep using the word “pure”, but there really isn’t any other way to put it. This is one of the most palpably slow drinkers in recent memory. You don’t want to guzzle or pound because the flavoring is so amazing, but rather you want to finesse this one, and perhaps take it out for a nice seafood dinner, by candlelight, followed by a romantic ride in a horse-drawn carriage. Oh, yes. You want this experience to last forever."

"Mouthfeel is creamy and viscous, but heavy and domineering; would be near impossible to crush this one in a solo op (however I'm tempted to try it if I can land another bottle). To repeat: a monstrous, decadent beast…and one of the finest barleywines I've had."

"This is a 2012 vintage I'm drinking. Very deep brown and when the light hits it a deep red garnet color created. Initially a reddish deep brown head is formed and fades away, a thin ring remains around the class. Not surprising given the alcohol content. Aroma is jammy, with raisins. Alcohol is rather present even after two years. Some barrel presence remains. Port like. Flavor is heavy on the booze, port and sherry like flavors waft in and become heavy and prominant. Burnt caramel, raisins, and toffee mingle with the sherry and port flavors. Complex flavor, really it is, way beyond a barrel bomb. Slick, oily mouthfeel. Thick. Not cloying however. The alcohol creates a sharp and clearly burn like quality. There is no doubt this is an exceptional ale. Downsides, the alcohol keeps coming back and reminding me it is there, the burnt caramel flavor is rather strong and can be off putting, the palate is left muddy."

"OVERALL: This was infinitely better than the 2011 I had a while back. Much less alcohol and burn, which allows the interesting flavor profile to come though. Perhaps some more time in the cellar will allow it to mellow out a bit more and take some of the heat out of the equation. That and a less prickly feel would make this one a real winner. Thanks again ScottO. Was a pleasure."

"Overall: I didn't like it as much as the first time (that 4.75 rating) but this is still a great beer. I enjoyed it more than Sucaba... drinks rather well for such a huge beer. Slighty one-dimensional perhaps, and a tad too filling, but it makes for a lovely sipper. Definitely would buy and enjoy again."

"Dark brown/ruby shade with ring of tan foam. Aroma is heavy on dark, sticky fruits, adding wisps of chocolate, smoke and a lighter-than-expected bourbon presence. Taste is brimming with sticky toffee and barrel influence. Hint of anise spiciness in the finish. Thick mouthfeel with no real trace of heat. I think I’ve had more complex barleywines, but few as delicious and easy to drink. A superb example."

"Rich and complex, drinkable for it's ABV. They don't overdo it with the barrel aging either. I can see why this beer is so renowned. If you have a 2012 around drink it now, mine was already oxidizing and I think a bit past its prime."
""
""
""
"O - I'm not sure with the ""whale"" factor plays a role in the high rating here. But, the beer is overly sweet in nature, which is a huge turnoff for me."

"I'd love to revisit this one a few years down the road, shes a big ass boozy sipper and If I had a second bottle I'd sit on it for ages. Its a great beer don't me wrong I just don't think its built to be drank fresh, and by fresh I mean a little over a year old."

"Immense barleywine that is easier to drink than the 2011 Stormwatchers that preceded it on the evening, but also lacks a bit of complexity. Would be interested to see whether it opens up with 5+ years of age."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Some may consider the malt, hop & alcohol balance a 'perfect storm'... and it is indeed impressive for a brew of this strength. Personally, I could do with a bit less alcohol and residual sweetness, and some more American hops! Though perhaps I was just expecting a more hop-forward brew like most of their lineup. This is seriously good (and improves as it warms)."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
"Verdict: An incredible Barrel Aged Barleywine from Pelican Pub and certainly one of my all time favorite barrel aged beers. A masterclass in complexity and balance, not too sweet, not too roasty, not too boozy, everything in harmony. This beer is aging superbly well and is worthy of any and all accolades."
""
""
"This beer has some hype. And it lives up to it. This is a great, great English Barleywine. This is only a year old, and I imagine more aging will only make it more awesome. This is great."
"This is one hell of a bourbon barrel barleywine. Layers of malt sweetness completely enhanced by the bourbon barrel. A ton of complexity. Well worth the fight to track down."

"Pours a solid dark brown with the faintest of ruby highlights when held to light and a smallish off white head that dissipates quickly to a ring on top. Huge brown sugary caramel malty aroma with lots of deep dark fruits and bits of vanilla. coconut and wood. Sweet sugary malt flavor with a solid hit of alcohol. Dark fruits caramel prunes wood and vanilla are all there in the flavor. Hints of bourbon oak and oak tannin round out the flavor. Medium to thick body with a light level of carbonation and a sweet almost syrupy mouthfeel. I've had this before and remember enjoying it a bit more. Its a nice barleywine, but I feel the alcohol is a bit too present and may need a bit of time to mellow out."
""
""
""
"O - Outstanding. Love the dark fruits with coconut. Complex flavors keep you guessing. Levels on levels on levels. Does warm the tummy quite a bit. But at 14 ABV - concealed very well. Unlike 'King Henry' this is NOT a extremely overly thick syrup. Thickness is excellent. I do think it could be more frothy. Thus far: #1 Sucaba. #2. Mother of All Storms. #3 Straight jacket."

"651mL 2011 ed thanks to dreadnaught33. Pours a clear, deep amber with yellowish/golden foam. Weak formation and retention. Nose is golden raisin, rum, brown sugar, tomato, Twizzlers. Taste is paper, cardboard, harsh acid, butyric/stomach bile. Palate has paper, oil, peppercorn. 8/4/6/3/14=3.5"

"Limited tan/khaki colored bubbles that don't even make a thin head across the surface. Deep burgundy colored body with yellowish/tan outlines in the glass. Good coating of the glass. Smell is inviting with some bourbon on the nose and dark fruitiness. The taste is deep. Ripe/overripe fruits creating a candy/brown sugar sweetness that enhances the oak and minor vanilla. Very, very smooth with a slick mouthfeel that is full bodied without too much heat. Great beer. Comparable to the best BA barleywines I've tasted. The key is having the body to stand up to the flavor and round out the drinking experience and this beer delivers that."

"Overall- A/A+. A thoroughly enjoyable beer. It was definitely worth 25 bucks. I would purchase again. Will be ticked as a 4.75 but slightly lower than that."

"So this is it, my personal white whale finally slain. After years of navigating the high seas of the craft beer world, the great beast lies dormant in my belly. It possesses everything I hoped it would: balanced flavors, ample bourbon, readily noticeable vanilla, and all that English Barleywine goodness that I crave. Ultimately, this is one of the best I've had, and while the ethanol is still slightly pronounced in this most recent batch, I'm hopeful that it would have mellowed with a bit more time."

"Probably waited a bit too long on this one. Still pretty good, but I'd prefer more heat and less sweetness. Will be drinking any future ones closer to fresh."

"This is up there with the best. Haven't had Sucaba recently enough to say which I prefer, but this is in the same league. Among the top barleywines I've had. Fantastic."
""
""
""
""
"Served in an oversized snifter - muddy garnet body, light cream lace. Pungent aroma fills the room - bourbon, spice, dark fruits. This is a monster of a beer - a rich array of barrel influences dominated by bourbon and oak. Brown sugar, raisins, dates, syrupy booze, thick malt. Very good - i think I favor Central Waters though, for the style."
""
""
"Overall I'm impressed. This is an unapologetically big bold beer."
""
""
""
""
"O: This is big and malty and ultra sweet. Pretty much exactly what you'd expect from a 14% bourbon barrel english barleywine. Wonderful beer, the only real fault I could find is when the bourbon stands alone in the aftertaste, it tastes kinda like cheapish bourbon. I'm guessing evan williams like previous vintages. Regardless, not nearly as hot as you'd expect for a fresh 14% barrel-aged barleywine, hell this bottle is barely 3 months old. Honestly, sucaba has nothing on this beer, this should be #1 handily."
""
"Bottle: Poured a lightly cloudy dark brown color ale with a medium size head with good retention and some light lacing. Aroma of light whisky notes with some brown sugar, toffee and some pretty robust caramelized malt notes. Taste is a great mix between some toffee notes with some brown sugar and caramelized malt with some whisky notes which kinds of round off the rough edge. Body is quite full with good carbonation and no real apparent alcohol. Very well done but I would have like the residual sugar to be more subtle which would have provide more space for the malt backbone to shine."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - all I can say is, I'm glad I have another one. I'm looking forward to seeing how this beer develops. It's a damn fine barleywine...maybe the best BW I've had to this point. It's got so many different flavors, the perfect amount of sweetness, an awesome ABV....a sipping man's BW. I'll be working towards a case next year Pelican!"
""
""
"Vintage 2012: Big thanks tojzeilinger for opening this beast. This poured out as a deep brown color, there was a thin bubbly head on top that didn't last too long. The retention faded and there really wasn't any lacing either but there was some viscosity on the glass after each sip. The smell of the beer wasn't as potent as I was expecting or hoping for. The beer smells sweet and earthy with some subtle booze on the nose. The taste is sweet, there is a touch of maple in there with some earthy peat but it's very hidden. The bitterness is low just a touch of it in the finish but for the most part this beer is very malty and for the right reasons. The mouthfeel is smooth, it's slick and very mellow. Not much carbonation here but just enough. Overall it was a good brew, holds up well to the style, I found it to be enjoyable."

"O: One of but no the best Barleywine. I like King Henry, 2010 Bourbon BA Old Guardian, and Abacus more, but this is one of the elite barleywines."
""
""
"O - Mother of all Storms is a quintessential barrel-aged barleywine, showcasing exceptional malt flavor and layers of complexity with bready notes, chocolate nuances, and bourbon wamth. Sip gingerly, soaking in the uniqueness and depth of this one-of-a-kind beer, and share with others, for it's a heavy hitter begging to be split and savored."
""

"O: I will be honest, I enjoyed this beer but I was slightly underwhelmed by it. Do not read that as this not being a good beer, it absolutely is. I also realize that my excessive expectations are not the fault of the beer, but I feel like this was just a step below some of the other top barrel aged barleywines (e.g., King Henry, BB Monster 29), for my palate at least."
"O - Fantastic, the mouth feel of this could not be any better, complex and the flavors are damn near perfectly blended with one another. Will definitely hang on to a few of these for a nice dinner."

"2012 vintage. Pours dark brown with little to no head. Aroma is so amazingly strong you can smell it as you pour. Bourbon, molasses,raisons, leather, bourbon, bourbon barrel, bourbon and more bourbon. Flavor is bourbon, caramel, dried fruit, chocolate with just a slight amount of booze. Heavy without being oily. Light/medium carbonation with lingering finish. An absolute perfect barrel aged barley wine that will only improve with age."

"Overall: This beer exceeded my high expectations and is an excellent version of a BA Barleywine. So many flavors, and they balance very well together. Definitely a beer to sip and enjoy as it opens up over time. I highly recommend this brew."

"Poured into a Maudite snifter. Pours a very dark russet brown with only a thin light tan head that dissipated to a ring around the glass. There appears to be active carbonation, but the bubbles don't stick around. Classic English barleywine aroma of caramel malt and dark fruit with nice bourbon and oak notes. Flavor follows with caramel malt, brown sugar, bourbon, dark dried fruit, a hint of cherry and chocolate. Finishes somewhat dry with oak and light hops. Medium bodied. Alcohol is covered but still hot and warming. A really nice English barleywine that was worth waiting for. Will lay a few bottles away for ageing, I think this will score even higher when the alcohol mellows and the flavors balance out over time."
""
"Overall - I have had different vintages of this beer from 2010 to 2012 and all of them have had the same off-putting aftertaste. It's not awful, but it could be so much better. Not sure if it's a nutty malt or an oaky flavor, but it keeps this from being the perfect BA barleywine. That said, it's still incredible."

"Overall: Mother of all storms is a fantastic barrel aged barleywine and one I hope to have again in the future."

"Overall: This is my first time have MOAS and I wish I had never read any reviews on previous years. It's hard to think this one compares."

"A nice beer for sure. This and Sucaba are up there as my favorite English Barley Wines I have had. Luckily I have several more bottles of this to age and see how it mellows out."
"I had this right after trying Bligh's and they are completely different. This is not nearly as sweet and has chocolate and bitter/dark fruits. Maybe some time really helps this beer out, but right now I don't think it is the league of exceptional English Barleywines."
""
""
"It's been quite a few years since I was an ardent fan of the barleywine style, but this one absolutely blew me away, even fresh. I can only imagine what a few years of aging might achieve."
""
"O: Glad this is distributed, because I definitely don’t need more than one and it would've bee a long drive to Pacific City to be nonplussed. Needs a ton more bourbon, otherwise it doesn’t justify the cost increase over the Stormwatcher's Winterfest or even the Wee Heavy. *Sigh* 2009 seems so long ago, though this is better than the 2011/2010 vintages when they were fresh."
""
""
"T: Opens with some burnt raisin skin and bourbon. Then leads into some great flavors of vanilla, toffee, butterscotch, toasted oak and a dry and warming finish with a touch of booze. Fantastic young, but I definitely can't wait to try an older bottle really soon."
"O: Originally I gave this a cut above average. I c have changed my mind. After afting the first runs, vintages and fresh I still believe this beer is thin, hot and off balanced. The tannins on this beer just a killer for me. In no way is this a true to style English Bwine and I feel by taste, experience and BJCP standards this is a poor showing."
""
"Overall this brew is doing quite well after a year of mellowing out in my wine cooler. Bourbon heat is just right compared to a year ago. Definitely would recommend the splurge if you have the cash!"
"Fantastic beer worthy of a spot on the top 100. Thanks Evan!"
"O: I think I much refer fresh Abacus/Sucaba over this, but it was pretty solid. Too sweet for me though."
"Can't wait to try this next year after its aged a little"
""
"Overall it's a very good beer but not quite as good as I had anticipated. I have traded away a few and put off the chance to try this and am finally trying it. Maybe I set my hopes a little too high? Some say it's better fresher??"

"This pours a deep ruby red color with a small off-white head. Its` nose contains caramel, brown sugar and quite a bit of bourbon. The smell is very fragrant, but those who enjoy bourbon from time to time, it is quite nice. Sipping on this and I taste vanilla, toffee, more bourbon and some oak. And that bourbon really continues to shine it the taste. Mouthfeel is rich, but finishes smooth, a rich, sweet texture lingers on your palate afterwords. Wow, this was a very tasty English barleywine, an excellent beer."

"Overall: An amazing English Barleywine. A big, big beer that would be great to share with some friends on a chilly night."
"Superb stuff."
""

"O: So as I was drinking this, I kept trying to compare it to Sucaba, as that's the next highest rated/most hyped English barleywine I've had to date.  And if I remember right, I enjoyed the first part of Sucaba better than the first part of MoAS, however, as I continued to drink (I drank whole bombers of each, as I like to do that when trying a beer for the first time/rating a beer) MoAS seemed to grow on me with every sip, whereas Sucaba became somewhat cloying as I approached the end of the second glass from the bomber.  So as far as which one I liked more, well it's a really tough call, but I think I'd lean towards MoAS.  I think a combination of the two ( with MoAS's insane drinkability combined with more of a bourbon presence and a thicker mouthfeel similar to Sucaba), would be the perfect Barleywine.  Maybe that's what King Henry is like....  That being said, this was excellent, and I will certainly seek it out again.  "
"M - Full body, somewhat viscous. Light carbonation."
"O: a god beer, overall. I'd like to try it witb a bit more age, though."
""
"O: excellent beer, probably just behind KH in barley wines. Would no doubt have again."
""
""
""
""
"O: A good English Barleywine. Personally, I would choose Abacus over this. Even though it's rated higher. Might had been a bad batch or something. It was good but the odd after taste killed it a little."
""
""
"O: I really like this beer, probably my favorite barleywine. I usually like my barleywines a bit hoppier, but this was my favorite (so far anyway). I will do my best to age a few."
"Pours with ruby red edges and head that fluffs up and drops quickly. A smooth body with some heat. Lots of malt, dates & figs. Lighter than expected body. Minimal bourbon notes. Nice, though nothing super special & not worth the hype."
""
""
""
"O: This beer is very well balanced between toffee and dark fruit sweetness and hop bitterness. The bourbon is very well integrated. Probably my favorite Barleywine, definitely more balanced than most of the style."
"O-- Gone before I knew it and was sad. Really well done beer and enough notes of the base beer to keep it interesting even with the very forward barrel notes. Alcohol was well hidden until the end and it hit like a hammer. Then again you just need one of these for the night."
""
"Poured into a Westy chalice a very nice dark brown color, very nice carbonation, nice fizzy almost one-finger dark tan head, with some little oil slicks left behind. The nose is very nice malty, with some nice sweetness, lots of dark fruits, with a nice little bourbon note. The taste is exceptional, malty, very sweet, with lots of figs, raisins, plums, nice little touch of bourbon, caramel, slight chocolate note, vanilla. Full/Medium body, ABV hidden very well, a true sipper though. This has got to be the best BW I've had to date, definitely the best English BW. Finally I'm getting a chance to try this brew. Really enjoying this one, thanks David!"
""
"O - Amazing right off the shelf without any time in the cellar at all."
"O: Drinking this next to Abacus I would have to rate it just below because of the weird after taste, if it weren't for that the complexity of flavor was better. King Henry is in a league of his own. This was a really good beer, def something I would want to sip around a campfire."
""
""
""
""
"O - A great barleywine, that is a definite sipper at 13.5%. Glad I got to try and that I have one more bottle."
"well, I'm impressed. Not as smooth as Abacus (sucaba), not as complex as King Henry, and boozier than both, but should be included in the conversation with the best barleywines out there. I'll be seeking more of these out. wonder what more age will do."
""
"O- Very outstanding beer for sure. I really enjoyed this one. Not as complex as some of the others but every thing comes together so nice."

"O: This is definitely one of those beers that lived up to the hype. While I had this on my list for probably two years, I was actually very glad to have finally tried this and it lived up to my expectations. I imagine with a few years age on it, it would do well and possibly lose some of the sweetness. Very impressed here."
"Pours a cherry leather with a rim of dark tan foam. Smells nougat, bourbon, raisins, chocolate and chewy caramel. Aromas of cake and sugar - a sincerely exquisite nose. Mmmm, cherry, tawny, sweet vanilla cake, rich mousse and caramels. Goddam, this is a good beer. Full bodied for the style with just a hare more carb than I prefer with a good, sticky and chewy finish. This is a truly excellent beer. I think I prefer this to KH, which is a great beer."
""
"2011 Vintage. Pours a beautiful dark brown with a ruby-red hue. Medium sized tan head with a hint of red that goes down slowly. Scent is outstanding! Great toffee and brown sugar notes...nice sweet bourbon booze. You can definitely smell the barrel in this beer...sweet oak and bourbon with some nice dark fruits, toffee, and vanilla. Taste is just as it smell...more complex than I was expecting. All the flavors in the nose are present in the taste and equally distributed, except I get a bit of chocolate in the taste. For such a high ABV beer, this gem is not overly sweet, nor is it too hot and boozy. Well crafted. Mouthfeel is full bodied and a bit sticky. Drinkability is high, as this is a delicious sipper. Overall, I haven't been this impressed about a barrel aged BW since King Henry. Would love to try these guys side by side. I got plenty of love for Sucaba, but KH and this are rightfully powering over it. Fantastic beer!"
"For me, this sits right behind King Henry in my favorite bourbon barrel aged Barleywine list. This had so much flavor, all working so well together. Balance is key and this is quite the achievement."
"O: There is a nice complexity in the flavor and aroma of this beer but there is a heavy sweetness and some alcohol presence. This beer is a definite sipping beer and a very nice one at that... Glad to try this and hope to get another vintage at some point in the future."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not as bad as I might make it out to be. It's a good dessert beer. A definite sipper. The aroma and flavors were above average by far. Very good beer."
"O - I remember when I had this beer for the first time. It was a 2009 bottle, consumed in early 2010, and it was the #10 overall beer in the world. At the time I thought that was WAY too high. I have had it twice since then and it is still very good, but the best I have ever had? No way."

"O: Very delicious. One of the heavier English barleywines out there, it was very complex and the ABV was pretty well hidden save for a slight throat warming that was more than welcome. A must try for any English Barleywine fan."
"The 2012 is a clear departure from previous vintages of MoaS, and I like what they've done with the place. Excited to see how this develops with age."
""
"Shared with the wife in the comfort of our home, this one was decanted into a Klokke Roeland globe for myself (a Cascade stem glass for her). Deep and dark, yet still eerily translucent, dark brown color mixed with a glistening bloody maroon, topped with a rocky beige head that retained for a surprisingly long time, and left some soapy lacing on the glass. Complex and tantalizing aroma of dark malty sugars, molasses, juicy dark fruits, and chocolate-covered cherries. Rarely do I give ""5" ratings for taste, but I can't really bring myself to rate this beer anything less. Caramel, toffee, thick malts, molasses and milk chocolate up front, a segue of almonds leading to a mid-palate cascade of raisins, figs, black cherries, sherry, brandy, red grapes, and finishing off with flavors of cigar-grade tobacco, vanilla-tinged, wood-soaked bourbon, and a deep-seated earthiness. If that weren't enough, the mouthfeel was intensely creamy and velvety smooth, full-bodied, almost too drinkable, though pretty hot from the alcohol, but you have to expect that from a beer like this. I have a few more bottles of this that I'm going to let age for a while. I'm sure they'll prove to be interesting in a few years."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- An awesome beer, one of the better barleywines I've had in a long time, I'm struck by the similarities between this beer and King Henry, if you liked one you should definitely try the other. Definitely a great beer for cold, stormy nights."
"Pelican's Mother of All Storms pours almost stout-like. The body of the beer appears to be all black, but some backlighting reveals scant cherry highlights. Nearly three fingers of foam come together to crown the beer. Head retention is somewhat fleeting though, and lacing is basically nonexistent. The nose is a little weak at first, but really starts to pop as the beer finishes warming. Strong notes of smooth bourbon and caramelized sugar are supported by a secondary aroma of vanilla. The bourbon, while still present, takes more of a back seat role in the flavor profile. Some creamy milk chocolate emerges to join the vanilla and burnt sugar hinted at in the nose. The mouthfeel is spot on, with a full, sturdy body that stops short of being syrupy. The carbonation is just enough to cut through all the malty goodness and let me know it's there, and I wouldn't want any more for it. English barleywines, and their barrel aged brethren, are some of my favorite beers, and Mother of All Storms is on of the best takes on the style I've had."
"D: I hate to blaspheme, but I'm not blown away by this beer. I think it's solid but no more. I've had it a handful of times since it came out last year, and each time I am less and less taken with it."
"O: The absolute standard for the English Barleywine style. A spectacular beer from start to finish, worthy of every accolade it has received. Thank you, Pelican, for this creation."
""
""
""
"Very good brew. Amazing actually nice dark fruit notes with toffee and tons of Bourbon and sweetness that isn't too intense. This is a great brew."
"This beer is thick, and delightfully messy. The body is coating, syrupy, and quite sticky. The carbonation is subtle at best but is definitely doing a lot of work in the background. The mouthfeel is slick, sticky, and syrupy but matches the taste perfectly."
"O: Rough, but the composite parts are excellent. The bourbon is a little too overwhelming. I hope with some age, the flavors will mellow slightly and come together. I'll save my second bomber for a year or two and re-review!"
"A good beer. A little too much heat. But still nice. Solid beer. Might taste better with age."
""
"An enjoyable beer with which to celebrate review #3,000. Thanks a bunch Hopluva1!"
""
"O- This is a really tasty BA barleywine, but with the huge amount of hype built up around it I thought it fell wayyy short...especially when directly compared to King Henry and BA Hi Fi. Hopefully some age can mellow out my other bottle."
""
"Rich coating feel, viscous yet dry and not overly sweet. Big bourbon notes of brown sugar and vanilla, nutty malts, toffee, and spun sugar. Finish is pretty dry, and the abv is felt but doesn't seem close to what it is in reality. Masterfully aged, though a bit more depth would be nice."
""
"The smell, once again one of the most potent flavor was that of raisins/dark fruit. I let my glass warm for a good bit before I drank it, so it may have different notes when onsumes colder. I also get some notes of bourbon. This was still really hot, I'd like to get a bottle of this age for a while then try it in two years once it has mellowed. While it was very aggressive when I tried it, I thing it would come out very smoothly with some age. Mouthfeel id relatively thick, with mild carbonation. If you enjoy a boozy beer and you like those sweet dark fruit notes, give this a try."
""
"Poured from bomber (2011 vintage – 4th release from this brewery) into tulip glass. This is the brewery’s Stormwatchers Winterfest 2010 aged in Heaven Hill bourbon barrels. Pours brown reddish hue with off-white medium head that dissipates to thin but a livery lace that lasts throughout. Gosh, I can smell the barley wine without bringing it close to my nose. Dark fruits, vanilla, and caramel in the nose. Light bourbon is detected. Flavors of dark cherries and oak vanilla. Bit of a bitter back finish. The bourbon brings out in it’s own quite smoothly. There is some toffee picked up late along with caramel. Good carbonation; sticky medium mouthfeel. A very well-made barley wine!"
""
""
"Overall: This is a delicious and complex beer, one that lots of other barleywines should try to emulate. It's a really good beer."
"quite an exceptional BA barleywine, among the best ive ever tasted. nuts and dark fruits kind of take center stage while the bourbon barrel seems very well integrated with the rest of the flavors. this kind of reminds me of hebrew 15:15 combined with founders- backwoods bastard. i cant wait to see what wonders age will do to my remaining bottle."
""
"Taste is really well balanced, a bit sweet and hoppy. The Mouthfeel is thick and creamy with a crisp choppy finish."
"O: Fantastic. This is one of the best BA Barleywines that I've ever had. The fruity and nutty characteristics were unexpected but very enjoyable and the barrel aged on this beer was done to perfection. It's just right."
""
"O: A great BBBW. I feel it is a notch below King Henry, but still among the best I have tried."
""
""
""
""
"- Can't say that I am raving about this beer. The hype, and price would make one think that this has to be one of the best special release beers around. For me, it isn't. It's solid, well made, and great quality.. just doesn't touch some of my favorites like Midnight Suns, and Southern Oregon Brewings'."
"Overall: Great barleywine and to date the best I have had"
"Big bourbon, roasted malts, caramel, molasses, dark fruits, and hop notes all balanced with a dose of warming booziness. I would be hard pressed to think of a tastier beer on a cold day."
""
"O : It’s amazing to me how the aroma is decadent bourbon/vanilla and yet the taste contains a fairly hardcore, big raisin/date barley wine flavor. Very impressive beer."

"O: I'm so glad I have more bottles, because I think the 2011's are still too fresh. I just couldn't wait any longer!"
""
""
"O: Not for the faint of heart, this is a really complex barleywine."

"The beer pours a dark reddish brown with a tan head about a finger thick that quickly fades to a thin ring and patchy lacing. The first aroma that I pick up on is oak and bourbon followed by toffee, caramel, dates, and raisins, with just a noticeable alcoholic smell. Despite the alcohol aroma the finish is barely noticeable. The taste is best described as a combination of dark fruit, a hint or chocolate, fresh oak, bourbon and molasses. The mouthfeel is chewy with low carbonation. This is a spectacular beer and one that I would definitely seek out again."
""
"Pours a clear dark brown with a khaki head that settles to a thin film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, brown sugar, caramel, toffee, toasted coconut, bourbon, and wood. Taste is the same with the bourbon flavor sticking around as the aftertaste. This beer has a pretty good level of carbonation with a light crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good barleywine and the bourbon barrel aging is very nice on this beer."
"O: Well put together and definitely worth seeking out. I think this beer can be enjoyed now or cellared for many years to come."

"Awesome balance of flavor. Once I'm done with King Henry the scores will come through, what is the true king of bourbon barley wines. Can't compare them in retrospect. A truly balanced master craft."

"Great beer, but not mind-blowing for me. Really nice level of bourbon presence, lets the barleywine really shine through."
""
"This was really tasty and I'm glad I got to try it, but it didn't quite live up to the hype."

"Overall - this is worth every penny, and every ounce of praise. I can't wait to try this again sometime with some age on it - it will only get better, I am sure of that."

"O - Just a bit all over the board. a little time would fix this, wonderfully. I would love to try this beer again with some age on it 2-4 years would be amazing!!! This beer did not let me down one bit. Super glad I finally got to try this one. Thanks to an awesome trader Dsgolovin, thanks David!"
"Overall I was kind of dissapointed, it is a good barleywine but nothing about it stuck out except for that odd cotton candy thing. That being said its still a good barleywine worth seeking out."

"SCORE!!! Very well done!!! Once my most appreciated style of beer, this barleywine is taking me back to the complex characteristics that I admire most in memorable ales. I highly recommend it. Actually...now that I think about it...this is ONE OF THE BEST beers that i've considered in 2011."
""
"O- This is one of the best barleywines/barrel-aged beers I've ever had. Immensely big and complex. Definitely a sipper, though."
"O - This is a very bold barley wine, next time, I will most likely split the bottle as it is a little intense to drink all 22 oz in one sitting! Bottom line, this is an awesome beer and well worth it if you're lucky enough to get some."
"D and O: Well, this is my second bottle of the 2011 MoAS. Extremely pleased. It's a truly great beer. Has alot of personality, and I feel like it's true to style. Great drying qualities, with a huge body, full of flavor. A really nice treat."
"Masterly crafted. It has just the right amount of barrel flavor without being overwhelmingly alcoholic. Perfect brew for this Christmas eve."
""
"Full body, decent carbonation, sticky, lingering and chewy on the palate. Holy crap this is a big beer - insanely delicious and satisfying but a definite sipper. I've had the 09 before and I think this was better."

"Pours a dark brown color with a really nice one finger cocoa head. Amazing head for a 13.5% beer. Good lacing on the side of my tulip glass. I get toffee, bourbon, coffee, vanilla, caramel, and some alcohol in the nose. Really balanced, and just about perfect nose. The taste is outstanding! The same profile as the nose, except better. Very balanced, and smooth, and amazingly drinkable. Feel is medium full with a tiny bit of dryness, and a smooth/bitter finish. Overall, this is a world class English Barleywine. Really glad I got to try this one. Cheers!"
""
"O: Delicious, top class English-style barleywine. I've never had a barleywine with so much cinnamon from the oak, but it works with the other flavors."
""

""
"O: One pretty damn good barleywine and relatively local to me too (even though it was a bitch to get a hold of!). Great barrel aging on this one, it's not over the top but you know it's there which in my book is the mark of a great barrel aged beer. Color is really nice and wish I had seen it in daylight. The dark crystal clear garnet hues look amazing! The aroma and taste share many similarities and this is deceptively drinkable. You will not be disappointed! Is it worth the price? To try for the first time: yes. To buy a case of? I'm not sure...you be the judge of that :)"

""
""

"D/O: Amazing. Love this beer, all the way around. Wish it wasn't quite so expensive though."
""

"Overall – A delicious barleywine. I can’t wait to see how this ages. The alcohol is surprisingly well hidden, and after the first few sips you don’t so much taste it as feel it. Not sure what I was thinking when I opened this by myself tonight. Looks like I’ll be nursing this the next couple of hours. A very nice sipper on this cold Midwest night."

"A sipping beer to be sure. Nice dessert beer methinks."
"Probably not as good as Abacus (the standard), this one, if there is a complaint, was just a tad too dominate by the bourbon. But yet, it wasn't hot for 13.5% so what can ya do?"
"Overall: A very tasty beer, but I wasn't as blown away as I expected to be. Great depth of flavors and I will seek it out again, but I do think I have had some barleywines I enjoy just a bit more."
"O. Very good and complex. Remarkably drinkable barrel aged Barleywine. I recommend seeking this out."
"This beer pours a nice reddish brown color with a thin but present head. the smell is a big sweet bourbony nose with hints of caramel oak and vanilla. the taste follows the smell with a bit of a burn in the finish, i think aging for a few years would definitely help this beer out. the burn was the only think i could find to deduct for. i think at a 2-3 year mark this beer would be a 5 the mouthfeel is very full and overall and amazing brew."
"This is my favorite barleywine, ousting Abacus. The smell and taste are complex and amazing. Get your hands on this if you can!"
"Thanks again Matt!"
"O- This beer is fantastic, worthy of all the hype that I’ve heard, easy drinking, and complex. Highly recommend this bad boy."
"A really enjoyable barleywine with very well integrated bourbon barrel aging. Definitely deserving of the high praises it receives."
"Overall: A boozy delight. It makes no attempt to hide its identity - thick, sweet, boozy, and delicious."
"O: Aroma and appearance are excellent, alcohol takes over in taste, unique and interesting"
"Overall this despite being 13.5% alcohol, it is surprisingly drinkable in small quantities. Definitely a sharing beer to be sipped and savored and a good one to contemplate the world with, if that makes any sense. I wonder if newer versions are equally as strong or if they are toned down a little. Glad I have two to find out down the road."
"O-This was a great beer, a real sipper. The bourbon flavor was very nice and it was almost like you are chewing thick bourbon than drinking a beer. My only complaint with some BBBWs is that they just don't have enough carbonation. I would drink this again but I am mostly glad to have ticked it off of my list."
"Narrative: All of the brackish land lovers said that this take was too ambitious. Sure, there was a school of marlin right off the coast heading for warmer currents, but, for gods sake, did you look at the meterology reports? They didn’t want to end up like the crew of the S.S. Stone Tea, rest in peace, who lost every member in this modern age refusing to deliver tea by protocol. No; no. There was a much more insidious secret that no crew member beyond the first mate could be made aware of. This marlin galleon was commanded by none other than a pelican. To be fair, he was a completely able captain with a curse placed upon him by a Portland witch who converted his form to the omnipresent visage of fertility, well knowing that he was impotent. That, my friends, is a story for another day. Sure there was a cool pressure from one direction and another front with conflicting warm pressures and, wait, who is manning the sextant? Oh that’s right, a pelican. Their cargo of 1200 barrels of bourbon and figs might never make it to port but one thing was certain, with this capta- BGLUB GLUB:::GURBLE::COPYRIGHTGURBLE"
"2010 bottle courtesy of the extremely generous Beerzebub. I have had this beer several times in several vintages, all outstanding, but this is the first bottle that I've owned. The brew pours a deep mahogany hue and is capped with a short-lived tan froth that recedes to an encircling wisp. Both the flavor and aroma are just delicious; they are fully redolent of buttery vanilla notes, sweet oak, almond, caramel-toffee, brown rice syrup, toasted coconut, molasses and a hint of fudge. The feel is creamy, smooth, and softly effervescent. Overall, it may get better with age, but it is drinking absolutely fantastic by any measure right now."
"revisited this review with the 2011 vintage and was pretty blown away. firing on all cylinders. i envision that my first taste was more in the swarm of a ton of beers, but this is a fantastic barleywine. looks smell taste and feel...probably would give it 4.5s across the board today. great nutmeg caramel malts and the barrel adds a really nice element. just as good as the other big boys. vanilla, toffee, and caramel wonderfulness."
"O: Totally worth the hype. This is definitely meant for sharing."
"Was lucky enough to get this. I think I understand now why there is a differentiation between English and American Barleywines basically the hop presence on the American side. This beer pours an opaque red. No head. First sip you know you have something special. The vanilla starts out and then comes the bourbon wallop! My only regret is that I don't have another one for aging (yet)!"
"(Sampled at Dak’s Memorial Day tasting. Courtesy of Dak!!). I almost passed on this because it was getting late in the day and I have a bottle at home. That would have been a major mistake. This beer is unbelievable!! Pours a clear mahogany with no head. Aroma of bourbon, vanilla, coconut and caramel dominate. Taste follow suit with a sweet blend of bourbon, coconut and vanilla. Did I mention coconut?? Medium bodied wit ha slick texture. Super smooth. This is a kick ass beer!!"
"Overall: An excellent barleywine. There are only two slight disappointments. The first is the lack of carbonation. The second is that the taste isn't quite as good as the incredible aroma."
"Overall an amazing beer, so good."
"The Reveal: A bit at a loss for what this could be I know its had a barrel treatment. Strong ale or Barley Wine? Pelican Pub and Brewery 2010 Mother of All Storms. Barrel aged barleywine. This was on my wants list! Thanks Phelps for yet another great beer drinking experience."
"Bottle generously shared by an advocate at Hill Farmstead Gathering. Rich aroma of bourbon, vanilla, molasses and old hops. Sweet flavors of maple, brown sugar, cherries. Full bodied with low carbonation. Overall a good beer, the flavors were nicely melded together but could have been more intense."
"O - Of all the barleywines that I've had to date, this has been by far my favorite. Hoping to land a few more of the highly regarded barleywines to see how this compares."
"O- A perfect storm indeed. This thing smells awesome and tastes just as great. What a pleasure to drink."
"4.0 D: This is a good beer, but it doesn't quite live up to the hype (at least not this vintage). I think this will be vastly improved in a few years after it is allowed to cool down a bit."
"D: definitely a sipper, it's good and has a very unique flavor profile."
"Consumed on 11-19-2010"
"D/O - Drinkability is high. This beer is very easy to drink, if not for the flavor and smell alone, but the insane transformation it takes as it sits in the glass and the lack of alcohol. While it's a sipper for sure and a bottle will last you well over an hour, it's worth it to taste it at intervals and witness the changes. I found myself drawn back to the snifter time and time again and wasn't disappointed."
"O: this is very sweet and full of flavored, for what it is, I would say it has decent balance, the heat is a little heavy going down"
"Edit: I've now had this beer several times since the tasting at DLD and each bottle has been equally superb. I'm confident in saying that it's my all time favorite beer and I cannot get enough of it."
"If you’re into bourbon (we’ve been doing shots of Maker’s Mark lately) you have to get your hands on this, whatever the cost in trade or dollars."
"This is thick chewy barelywhine. Smooth body with soft carbonation but it's bit sticky. Overall, this is great. I want more. It's a little warm going down but I'm glad to sip on this."
"This just about met my expectations. Very good wooden notes; a nice complex sipper."
"22oz bottle courtesy of Jerriko, thanks a million man! I split this with a friend and 11 ounces is too much for me but your mileage may vary. This beer is a monster. Dark brown/black like cola. Smells like whiskey barrels, caramel, pretty good. The flavor is nice but intense whiskey barrel, caramel, barleywine, and then oddly enough a cola flavor. This is a good beer but it is hot and for sipping only."
"Finally an English Barleywine comes to the party. It only took us the whole time. This pours a beautiful dark golden color with a nice head to garnish. The aroma is beautiful. A mix of golden raisin and vanilla, that I would love to spritz on my girlfriend so I could smell it all night long. The taste has that dark fruit flavor too it. There is a butterscotch, vanilla, raisin and fig flavor that can typically be found in all good barleywines. The mouthfeel actually felt a bit rough to me. As if it wasn't finished. The palate has a almost a barley husked tannin-like quality to the finish that is slightly undesireable. Overall this is still a very good beer and I would probably never turn it down."
"-Gfunk"
"2010 edition, so you know we ain't steppin' on George and Marky-Mark's toes. It pours a somewhat murky ruby-brown topped by a short-lived half-finger of dirty tan foam. The nose comprises dark toffee, dark candi sugar, light cocoa, and light roasted malts. The taste holds notes of hot caramel, roasted malts, oak, vanilla, toffee, and a healthy amount of brown sugar and cinnamon. So much spicy maltiness, so much enjoyment. The body is a hefty medium, with a moderate carbonation and a syrupy feel. Overall, a very good barleywine, which deftly focuses on dropping a malt-bomb on all of us in a very pleasant way. Get some!"
"Pours a dark caramel with little to no head. Smells like candy, boozy candy, booze, dark fruits, phenomanal.  Taste dark fruits, some caramel, boozy, good.  Mouthfeel is sticky, drinkability is high for the ABV, delicious. Man, I need to get a few bottles of this. World class."
"Special beer indeed. I will be trading for this again. Back on the Want List for this one!!!"
"Overall this was the second time I’ve had this beer and it lived up to its memory. A nearly perfectly well balanced English barleywine with nice notes of barrels. Well worth a shot."
"Drink- This was one of the best beers I have had. The strong qualities were matched by its subtle flavor directions and how well each sip played on the last one. Would love to have one a week. Just a great beer."
"Period."
"This is a medium to full bodied brew with a lighter level of carbonation but not too low. This is an exceptional brew. The abv is fitting and not distracting with all the other flavors. A very solid sipper with a toasted quality that only evolves as it warms. Fantastic brew that satisfies the sweet tooth."
"This is a really terrific beer and one can tell how carefully one like this is crafted compared to other barleywines. A must try."
"I enjoyed it."
"overall - this brew made me wonder why there are not more breweries that barrel aging Bwines - it also reminded me quite a bit of founders backwoods bastard"
"Glad I got a chance to sample, but now really looking forward to sampling the base beer(Stormwatcher's Winterfest)."
"Really enjoyed drinking this, just like the first time around. Thanks again for packing this one up with you Alex, a shame we didn't get to it while you were still here. Great beer."
"Pours a deep reddish brown with very little head. The aroma is wonderfully complex with some toffee, some cherry, some pecan, lots and lots of bourbon, & the booziness while present is very mild. The flavor is plenty of the vanilla and bourbon thing but not in an insanely overbearing way, this is well balanced with a very nutty and roasty character. The beer has some great candy sweetness, some resiny notes and a bit of coffee. The palate is very full and luxurious."
"Yay, 1000 reviews! Release the balloons and confetti, just don't let them fall in my awesome beer. Thanks to all the awesome traders who helped me get here, and more in the future. Can't wait to try more awesome beers, and wish I could just sip beer all day and never have to work, but I gotta pay for the beer somehow. And now I'm enjoying this with a little bit of dark chocolate and it's so transcending, they accent each other so well, I'm in heaven."
"D - Cmon, palatte killer and will put you on the floor."
"This beer really comes into its own with time. In order to enjoy all its complexities, definitely let this one warm up to cellar temperature before serving. For a barleywine of such magnitude, The Perfect Strom is a unique and enjoyable sipper."
"Drinkability: A definite sipper and quite enjoyable. I was first introduced to this gem under it's former name ""the perfect storm"" and this one doesn't miss a beat. Next year I'll be stocking up on this one."
"Overall impression: Incredibly good barleywine. I can't imagine how it could get better, but I'm glad I've got a few bottles in the cellar just in case it does."
"Overall this is a great tasting beer but it is a bit hot and harsh. If I had another bottle I would hold on to it for at least a full year before opening it. If you decide to open one, this is still pretty young so be prepared to taste the alcohol heat. All that said, my friend and I finished our glasses very easily and enjoyed it all the way."
"Mother of All Storms packs incredible flavors into an alcohol-soaked whole. It's great for how fresh it is, but a year in the cellar will make this beer phenomenal."
"The mouthfeel is on the heavier side, with carbonation being moderate for the style. Drinkability is very good, I really loved the flavors to it. The barleywine flavors were very good, the dark fruits and malty sweet flavors were especially nice in it. The barrel aging was also done very well. It added some nice depth and complexity, but still allowed the beer to shine through. Fantastic beer overall."
"Pours a nice brownish red color with minimal head and lacing. I got a lot of sweet toffee and bourbon on the nose which i thoroughly enjoy those flavors. Tastes of oak, vanilla, maltiness and bourbon. Little carbonation and a sweet mouthfeel finish. Definitely a sipper and probably will be a very good bottle to age."
"M/D: Medium to full bodied with a good carbonation, balanced very well. There is a slight alcohol burn, but not a problem at all, and expected. Overall, I found this beer to be really good. Very complex flavor profile with a lot going on."
"D-drinkable. Especially considering the abv. Nice."
"Pours a very reddish brown. Not very dark. A decent amount of head. Dissipates quickly. No real lacing. Smells very bourbon heavy. Tastes strongly of bourbon with lots of malt presence. Thick sweet mouthfeel. Too potent to be that drinkable. Vry overwhelming but also quite good! Needs some age before it will settle into it's prime"
"D. A bit hot, but very drinkable."
"Nice silky tan head, light lace over a dark woody mahogany. Notes of bourbon, oak, vanilla, dark pitted fruits, candy, malts and pecans. A bit boozy, but should age well. Full body, great finish. This will age very well for years to come. Wish I could get more!"
"D: This is a nice sipper, extremely high ABV, but it is quite enjoyable. The taste has an alcohol presense because of the bourbon, but it is not a hot alcohol taste."
"Pours a hazy dak amber to brown-ish color with a small tan head. In the aroma, oaky bourbon, caramel, and dark fruits. In the taste, bourbon stands out, with some dry dark fruit and a sticky caramel. A smooth and big bodied mouthfeel, with a lingering bourbon and caramel like sweetness. A sipper for sure, big bourbon and quite nice."
"I enjoy Barleywine very much and this beer really set the standard for the style (at least for barrel aged). The flavors were bold yet well balanced, a true sipping beer, not because you want to but because you have to."
"Drinkability - This has scary good drinkablilty for 13.5% this is hands down my favorite English Barley wine that I have ever had."
"The CPJ"
"Drinkability - good."
"EDIT: Fourth bottle opened December, 2011. This has become fairly muddled and one-note. Will update with last bottle."
"Glad I got to try this but the ~$34 it cost for us to acquire it was a bit steep."
"Drinkable for a barleywine for sure."
"Good, but this beer didn't wow me in any respect. I will definitely revisit it if I get a chance to!"
"D: This is my second time enjoying this beer. The wait between tastings was almost a year. I really hope I don't have to wait that long to try it again."
"EDIT: Had an opportunity to try another 2010 bottle in September 2010 it is not aging gracefully. The big, bright excessive bourbon flavor which was both hot, but tasty has lost some of the positive edge to it and instead has gotten more abrasive. Review above adjusted accordingly (-1 for taste)."
"Quite an amazing barleywine. Decadent, balanced and incredibly tasty - great to sit down with and slowly enjoy (but I won't do that)."
"Shared at Beachwood BBQ during the Bruery RS Post-Party (can't remember who brought it, but BM me so I can give you proper credit). 2009 Vintage! Served from bottle into a goblet. Poured red-brown with a minimal off-white head. There was no lacing evident throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, caramel, chocolate, and slight alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, caramel, chocolate, cream, and alcohol. It had a medium feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. The flavor and aroma were quite complex and all aspects seemed to work quite well together. Not really a whole lot could be added to make it better. This is an absolute must try."
"M/D - A true sipper. You can tell by some of the alcohol heat that this is a young beer and is a perfect candidate for aging. I am glad I have a few to compare over the years to see how it develops, I am betting on fantastic!"
"(D)- This is just a wonderful example of a barleywine despite how fresh it is still. Smooth despite its ABV. My review does not do it justice; rich and dynamic with really the perfect body for the style. I so want to just give this perfect 5s, but this really cannot be too drinkable since it just needs to be sipped and savored to fully appreciate just how good this really is in my opinion."
"I have had 2 vintages of this beer and they both were let downs. There are definitely better barrel aged barleywines around. Anyone want one in trade?"
"Drinkability is good. This is a great sipper, especially on a cold night. I love the nose and the flavor is almost there as well. Probably my third favorite barleywine right behind Midnight Sun's Arctic Devil and J.W. Lee's Harvest Ale. The beer seems a little hot at the moment and I'd like to see the light hop presence die out a little bit. So needless to say, I'm excited to revisit this beer with a few years on it. Really glad I've got a case to age. One of the best English barleywines out there. Nice work Pelican."
"Tastes decently sweet but with a decently strong bitterness and an almost savory bread-like slightly salty umami that would I think lend well to aging. Caramel and some warm date rolled in as well. Mouthfeel is just slightly abrasive with a tingly small carbonation, otherwise medium-bodied. Pretty drinkable for a fresh-ish English Barleywine, very sip-able. Very excited to see where this one goes with aging."
"Bottle. Mother of All Storms. Poured into a tulip glass a dark mahogany brown color wih reddish highlights. Minimal head but given the abv, I am not really surprised. Strong aroma of bourbon, oak, and molasses. Nice rich blended flavors of bourbon, malt, oak, some bitterness, caramel, and dark fruit. Very rich but very good. Nice sipper. Solid barrel aged beer and glad I got to try this. I shared this among several non craft drinkers and they all enjoyed it."
"D: Alcohol is evident but far from overwhelming...it's a sipper, but it's extremely drinkable for its ABV and style."
"Just, you know... good luck finding a bottle."
"D: Again, I want to see how this beer ages. I have high hopes. A very tasty beer, I'm glad I was afforded the opportunity to try it."
"Overall- Good, but a bit one-dimensional to make it elite. Bourbon treatment is well done, but needs a bit more depth. Don't trade your cellar for one, but it's worth getting, especially if you're a bourbon fan."
"D: This beer is still a bit hot. In a year or two, it would be perfect. I still loved this brew and wish I had 2 cases (if only I could afford that). I think this is a pretty even match to Flossmoor Wooden Hell."
"D: So happy that pelican let's you order this by mail! Also, excited to try the 2009 perfect storm that I have sitting in my cellar at some point."
"D - The taste of this beer is outstanding. I love it. That being said, it is really hot. Ton of booze. The alcohol burn limits the drinkability, but this is still an outstanding beer."
"d - I thought this was a really good barleywine; one of the better ones I've had. I loved the nose and think for the ABV, it is pretty drinkable. Glad I've got some more of this, looking forward to holding onto most of them."
"Air and some time in the glass really improves flavors to rich roasted grains, big black chocolate and coffee that goes to big black licorice nose and flavor profile. Black bitter coffee/espresso goes to an assertive licorice finish as one sips it."
"It is a little warm at the lead off but overall its a medium bodied beer with sweetness and alcohol at the front. The palate opens up in the middle with oakiness and more sweetness, from the bourbon. The finish of the beer is clean and a little dry but it doesn't dry out my palate. It's big but the alcohol is balanced well with the flavors of the malt and the barrel character. It's very drinkable, although it is a sipper."
"Third bottle, from memory, amidst multiple elite barrel aged barley wines. This was also a 2009 bottle. Basically a bit more muddled with age, more chocolate and oxidation going on. Not even in the same ballpark as Wooden Hell, which was also involved. Too much barrel, too muddled, not much intersting nuance anymore. Fine, but not world class."
"D. This is intense. 22 ounces never looked like so much, but this is a perfect beer to sip on for hours and wait out a storm..."
" Wonderful example of what the barrel offers."
"After having the regular Stormwatcher's I can say that the barrel has done wonders here. The harsh licorice and roasted flavors are smoothed out and the beer greatly improves."
"This did not disappoint. A masterpiece that I'm intensely happy I've been able to sample, & now I'm really looking forward to the new batch of Mother of All Storms!"
"I sipped these 22oz for the better part of 4 hours, and still at the end it was exciting to raise the snifter to my lips. incredible. i'm a harsh reviewer, but i'm strongly considering all 5s...next bottle(someday)will decide."
"A very intense brew. Bourbon lovers rejoice. I felt like it was on the edge of being a tad too boozy for me though."
"d: This absolutely lives up the hype. Thanks Ed, for advising me to wait until this had a year on it. It was worth it."
"All in all, this brew is good, but did not blow me away. I would definitely try it again if I got the chance, but I have to say, from the hype, I am a little disappointed. Definitely try this if you like your beers boozy, BIG, and sweet, but if you don't like that, then don't worry about this one. I'm definitely a BIG beer person, so I do definitely think this is solid, but not mind blowing."
"Thanks again Eric... pretty happy I got a chance to try this one relatively fresh."
"Cheers!"
"Nothing subtle about this beer. If you are going to name a beer ""The Perfect Storm," it better live up to it, and Pelican without a doubt came through. Beer geeks, hunt this one down."
"D-very solid beer, good balance of malts and a great mouthfeel. very solid beer!"
"Flavor is great! -but potent! Wow, tons of booze in this one. I would imagine with a couple years, this would mellow out great! A sipper in current condition for me. Loads of bourbon, big over ripe fruits like raisins and figs. Taste overall is very sweet with a strong sharpness due to the 13.5% abv. Medium to full body, low carbonation...heat from the ABV, which is noticable on the lips too after each sip. A great beer, and definitely stoked I got the chance to try this beer!"
"D - ive had 2 glasses and although i would like to drink more at 13.50% i probably shouldnt"
"Poured a dark brown with mahogany highlights with a thin head that left good sticky lacing on the glass. Big caramel aromas up front with a good amount of bourbon that also had vanilla accents and slight oakiness. The flavor was big on the caramel as well with vanilla accents and large bourbon notes busting through that made the taste a little heavier alongside slight oak and raisins. The beer was full bodied with a low amount of carbonation that had a swet silky boozy finish. Very good barleywine and was very happy to try out at least once. The drinkability was pretty good considering the ABV on the brew."
"Rich deep dark mahogany brown with zero head. Some carbonation is seeping through. This beer just looks boozy and mean. Well sh*t. Another over the top bourbon mess in the aroma. Sweet bourbon, molasses, brown sugar, boozy soaked prune and dates. The flavor delivers a tad more. Wow, one boozy beer beer. The alcohol is far from hidden. Starts with a great in depth complex barleywine style and is followed by some bourbon integration, but the finish is just so sweet and hot. My belly is just filled with alcohol. I can see how many people would love this beer, but it's far from being a finessful drinkable beer."
"D: Fantastic for the style. It integrates the alcohol very well with the varieties of flavour. The carbonation is very accommodating as well. A storm I would gladly weather when reaching for a big brew such as this. Delicious."
"Overall I'm glad I'm sharing this one. It's super heavy and I would not be able to drink alot. Tasty though."
"Drinkability: This is one you want to share but it really blends all the flavor elements together in a much more subtle fashion than most other bourbon barrel beers"
"Pours dark brown, with moderate head. In a word, well integrated bourbon, this is a knochout punch of dangerously seductive alcohol. I am not the biggest fan of bourbon, but it is good for what it is. Some coconut from the barraling. The English barlewyine takes a secondary role to the bolder bourbon.Thanks Augustgarage."
"Overall, I'm very happy to have gotten the chance to try this amazing barleywine. One of the best I have ever had. Very much worth the Darkness I gave up to get it in trade."
"Full bodied, rich, creamy, with a surprisingly high amount of carbonation. At the very least, the carbonation is higher than I expected it to be. This is a nice, drinkable Barleywine, which I am glad I had the chance to try."
"D- Moderate but oh-so-tasty. I am really impressed, this is deserved of all its praise. A world-class barleywine. I'm not the biggest bal-aged advocate but when done this well it's a no-brainer. I like my beers hot if done well, and this one is perfection. Awesome stuff."
"Drinkability: Boozy mess (didn't notice bourbon), too sweet and too much oak. I don't get what I am missing that makes others like this one so."
"This luscious brew was served up by none other than Gillard! Thanks Ryan. Pours clear deep mahogany with thin tan head. The aroma is full of dark fruitiness heading into solid boozy nose searing heat at the end of the draw. The taste is smooth and sweet with prunes, ripe plums and raisins. By midway solid heat like booze tries to take over the flavor right into the finish. Very nice stuff that could use a few years of aging to bring it into perfection."
"A real sipper and not one that I would seek out again. Big props to Duane for the opportunity, but this didn't meet the hype."
"Thank you Grant!"
"O- This beer is huge. Lots of flavor through all its complexities. The alcohol is just enough to be noticed and not too much to be overpowering. A 10oz pour out me back, defiantly a beer to share. Will be seeking out more."
"This is exactly what I look for in a good sipping beer. Everything is there, not too boozy. To have this be a memorable experience from an event like DLD says a lot. Well done."
"Kudos, Pelican. I'll still be savoring this two hours from now, no doubt. A slow-sipper, one to be taken slowly and respectfully. Simply one of the best beers I've ever had, and I'm far from a bourbon aficionado. I was hoping the bourbon wouldn't overtake what was one of my favorite barleywines, and it doesn't. And I would've easily believed this was in the 9-10% range, judging by what's going on in the flavor. Uh, hey Brian, you have 10 more of these to send my way? :)"
"Warm and almost too boozy, but this is one incredible smooth beer. Not harsh by any stretch of the imagination. I would love to have another shot at this a year or two down the road, because this is filled with potential."
"A very impressive barleywine, british style as I prefer, need to get myself more of this. An excellent sipper."
"D - Shockingly drinkable with the high ABV. It's still a bit of a sipper, but it's something you can down easily all things considered."
"Less almond-like, more hazelnut like, with a simpler, brown sugar/ toffee aroma. Oxidation is starting to take a hold here, lending some sherry notes that work well with the nutty booziness. Booze is dying down, bringing out the malt a little bit more. A touch flabby on the finish. Solid stuff."
"This is an exceptional beer, from an exceptional brewer. The deep roasted malts, bourbon and oak flavors come through in every sip. The finish delights with a hint of vanilla. This beer is an absolute delight! I strongly recommend this beer to all in search of high quality beers."
"D - While this is a very good barleywine in its own right, I am perplexed that this is a top ten beer and (at the time of my review) the highest rated barleywine on BA. I can think of several others that were more enjoyable. Some that come to mind are: Midnight Sun Arctic Devil, Cambridge Blunderbus, and Bullfrog Whiskey BA Old Toad."
"The body is medium-plus, low but peppery carbonation. This beer is massive, glad to have the chance to try it."
"D: Number 10 (as of right now)? Really? Give me JW Lee's Harvest Ale or Gratitude any time of this. Too messy, I just can't get into it."
"it takes you to a mystical land, a dream world of murky depths and heavenly summits. pours dark red and a bit murky, pungeant, bourbon, vanilla, sweet malt, caramel, dates, and figs. its aroma is surpassed by the flavorful assault. the sweet malt and bourbon ride in first, flanked by vanilla. the fruit flavor and caramel then storm to the sides, capturing your entire match in ecstasy. it finishes with just the right bourbon bite and malt sweetness, leaving you desirious for more."
"D - Good, but I couldn't drink a whole bottle of this...and I've drank many 22's of Abyss all alone!"
"Drinkability: This is a beer to savor, and this is so for two primary reasons: 1) it's 13.5% abv, and anything that's 13.5% abv is something to savor, or else you'll end up on your ass; and 2) there's too much going on here for even a 22 oz. bottle spread over 3+ hours to expose. The drinkability of this one surely gets knocks for the abv% - and also for what is, relatively speaking, a pretty large amount of free sweetness - but these can't stand in the way of what is truly a remarkably complex and amazing brew. In many ways, this reminds me of Bourbon Barrel Angel's Share - boundless intricacies in a spirit-infused package (only, with carbonation). This one's worth seeking out."
"Drinkability: It is a rare occasion that I give a beer with a 13.5% ABV anything above a 4. Why is this? Because, I don't care how well the alcohol is hidden for the ABV percentage, at some point, you usually are still going to be tasting quite a bit of alcohol, and the drinkability will consequently be hampered quite a bit regardless of relative ABV and style considerations. I make an exception, today, for The Perfect Storm, because, well, The Perfect Storm is EXTREMELY drinkable for its ABV, with little to no alcohol heat (and on top of that, tastes delicious). I want to drink this one all night, and extremely glad to be splitting this one with CrellMoset, who is almost certainly saving me from drinking to excess this evening. Pick this up by any means necessary. As a side note, this one pairs well with an extra sharp cheddar (due to the strength of the cheese) but I've also got some creamier cheeses out (havarti and fontina) which more than hold their own with this brew. Excellent."
"Going to hold on to my last couple until I know whether or not I can get more next year..."
"Thanks be to my Oregon friend Fred."
"D: Whew. The alcohol bit is big, but so is the flavor."
"drinkability is great. nicely balanced, hiding much of its 13.5% abv. great depth. excellent complexity. the barrel is perhaps a little more heavy-handed than i would like, but it works pretty well."
"Wowza, what a massive Barleywine. The barrels must have been very wet for this one. Loads of bourbon and very strong in nature. Truly a boozy, chewy winter sipper if there ever was one."
"Pours dark toffee brown with a paltry sized head with no retention noted. Aromas of brown sugar, cat food, maple, and bourbon booziness dominate. Did I just say cat food? Yes, yes I did and apparently I am the only one to pick up on this but I don't get much enjoyment out of the aroma. The taste loads up on sugary sweets, treacle, toffee, with a maple and earthiness to it, and a big bourbon bite that I enjoy. I do like this, though as far as bourbon barrel barleywines go, this is fairly typical in taste. The thick body and properly light carbonation for the style, are, however, spot on, and this is a nice beer. I would recommend this, however, no more than any other bourbon barleywine I have enjoyed."
"Drinkability- This is just a solid f'n beer. SO much bourbon and wood. I'd say this is the biggest, tastiest barrel aged beer that I've had since Wooden Hell. It doesn't quite have the oak that WH had and it's a tad warmer but I think it may be slightly less sweet. In a year or two this thing is going to come together nicely and be absolutely amazing-er. Thanks much Tyler you generous son-of-a-gun!"
"D - Fantastic. Wished I had more. This is by far the best English style barleywine I've had. Not a pretender, definitely a top beer."
"Drinkability: English barleywine is certainly not my favorite style, but I can see why this one stands out. I think the sweetness would overwhelm me after a while, but as ~4oz. sample this was great."
"D: This is the king of barleywines. Incredibly balanced with a mouthfeel to match and integrate the complexity that is this beer. Seek it out. The hype is well-deserved here. A joy to have and one I'll definitely be seeking out in the future."
"Give this one at least three years and maybe it will be worthy of its BA rating."
"J"
"Shared by jedwards and served in my 25cl Allagash tulip. Poured a deep brown with red highlights that were revealed from each angle and rotation of the glass. Loose, white head quickly dissipates into barely a swirl. Incredible nose - malty, sugary sweet, toffee, butterscotch, a little booze, molasses, prunes and perhaps a little breadiness. Taste follows nose - sugary sweet with the addition of some caramel, vanilla and coconut. Mouthfeel is medium with a lively carbonation. Definitely a little booziness in this, but a big, bold and delicious beer. However, closer to an American Strong than an English barleywine in my humble opinion."
"2009 bottle. Deep mahogany pour with bright ruby highlights and no head. The aroma is Musty bourbon and caramelized dates rounded out with a hint of vanilla and charred oak. The flavor is awesome rich, buttery caramel with notes of fig, vanilla, an accent of char and smoke, and milk chocolate. It finishes with a nice little alcohol kick. The body is sticky and full with low carbonation."
"Given time, I know this beer will mature into something amazing. but for now, it is only exceptional."
"Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with low carbonation, some big warmth going down but I would expect no less. This stuff is serious, huge rich malts in the one, amazing. Thanks Alex!"
"I am glad I got to try this beer and am lucky I have a good WA BA friend who gave me another to age. Thanks!"
"All told, Perfect Storm is a really great barleywine, perhaps near Midnight Sun Arctic Devil for among the best I've tried. I think some age would have bumped it to #1, as about all I can ding the beer for is a little harshness in taste and feel from the alcohol/bourbon flavors."
"2009 vintage. Pours brown with a very small tan head. Aroma is strong oak and bourbon. The flavor is complex, with vanilla, bourbon, chocolate and roasted malt. Medium mouthfeel and very drinkable. This beer didn't disappoint."
"Edit from 11/14.  The newest version is more of the same, but the barrel aging and whiskey barrel flavor is more prominent than in previous versions.  For me, this just makes the beer even more impressive and enjoyable.  Excellent stuff...."
"Worth seeking out for fans of English barleywines."
"my head."
"D: This was a hard one to put down; sip after sip news things are developing. Would love to try this down the line with some more age on it."
"I've not been the hugest barleywine fan in the past, but this beer has changed my perception of the style. Absolutely fantastic."
"Overall, a fantastic b-wine. One of the best in the style. A little hot. I think this one will get better with age on it and then I will reevaluate the score. I can't wait to try it again"
"D: A damn fine brew, one I could sip on for hours."
"D--Do to its rarity, does it matter? What I can say is this is a sipper to be enjoyed for its complex flavors and smell. Hated to see it go."
"Really nice full body and extremely smooth, very drinkable almost no alcohol presence. This is hands down the best barleywine I have ever had."
"Full body with a smooth mouthfeel, only ever so slightly boozy but very warming. Drinkability is high because it's just so damn good. Overall, this is easily one of the best barleywines I've ever tried."
"Thanks to ipafool for this. Pours ruby/dark brown in color with an interesting tan head that recedes to nonexistence. Smells and tastes amazing - tons of bourbon, vanilla, toffee, raisins, dark fruits, wood, and alcoholic heat. This really is liquid toffee. Reminds me a bit of FW Abacus or FW 10. An amazing wood-aged barleywine. Body is super thick, but the carbonation slices through it to prevent syrupification. I started out the gate strong in downing this, but am hitting a wall as I near the end of the bottle, so drinkability takes a bit of a hit. Not sure why this is sold in bombers rather than 12 oz bottles, but quite a tasty brew."
"Overall, I'm not a barleyfine at ALL! But this great beers may just change my mind, or just is it this beer? This beer is tasty, complex and has the best mouthfeel I've ever had. I would recommend this beer up and down all day."
"Overall this was just incredible. I had heard this was one of the best out there, but very seldom does that hold true, here it does with flying colors. One of the best, hands down I has ever had."
"This easily is one of the best beers I've ever had and being the rich, intensely flavorful beer that it is, it's definitely a sipper. That being said, the light carbonation keeps it playful and the smoothness made me crave sip after sip. I went into this thinking that it would be pretty good but would most likely not live up to the hype, and I was absolutely wrong. It's exceptional and I only wish I had more."
"Too hot and too intense to be very drinkable, this one is complex and tasty enough to keep me thirsty for more...to a point."
"Bottle brought down by Joel from the pub. Super dark red color with a small beige head. The aroma has a lot of bourbon influence and barrel character, like this spent some quality time on wood. Dark burnt sugars, charred oak, burnt vanilla, caramel, alcohol and old wood. The flavor is very hot with lots of bourbon, dark caramel, bunt fruit and charred wood. The finish is almost pure alcohol and very rich. The mouthfeel is very hot and alcoholic, full, and has a modest amount of prickly carbonation. A very big beer that is not very smooth at this point and could use a lot of time to mellow out. Dark and burnt for a barleywine. They really went for it with maximum barrel extraction, but it looks like its going to take a lot of time to really mellow back out."
"Bottle courtesy Joel. Pours a gorgeous shimmering copper color with a fading beige head. Aroma is sharp bourbon, lots of heat here, charred oak, vanilla. This is more bourbony than any barrel-aged beer I've had. Over the top. Flavor is caramel and bourbon, vanilla, leather, and wood. I don't know if I'm drinking beer or if a plane dropped a barrel on my face. Needs a lot of age to gain a modicum of drinkability. Also rather thin from the spirit influence."
"Overall: A little less body and more heat than I had hoped. Still delicious. I'm sure heat and drink will improve w/cellaring."
"Nice soft carbonation up front with a medium body that's on the fuller end. Promient oaky tannis and a huge vanilla character from the oak aging. The bourbon is ore prominent in the flavor than in the aroma but again it isn't overpowering but rather is a nice compliment to the other complex flavors. There's also a bit of dark fruit, especially raisin, fig and date balancing out the earthy leathery malt notes. The bourbon presence provides a bit of alcohol warmth but this beer is dangerously drinkable considering how well the high ABV is masked. Extremely smooth and if I didn't share this bottle with some other BAs I would have probably killed myself by drinking it too fast. This is one of the best beers I've ever had and I can't recommend it and higher!"
"This definitely lived up to the hype...incredibly complex barleywine that will certainly improve with age."
"D: This is one to share without a doubt. The tiniest of sips was all that was needed to get a mouthful of flavor."
" This years TPS is sublime. The base beer, 08 Stormwatchers, is a lot better than the previous. Thus giving the ale a wonderful creaminess and balance it didn't have before (I didn't realize this until I did a side-by-side tasting). Big notes of vanilla, caramel , prunes, raisins, and a little bourbon makes this years batch worth every drop. I have to give a standing ovation to Pelican for taking TPS up a notch. They have been producing some amazing beers under the radar and TPS is the cream of the crop. Great World Class Beer!!!"
"This is definitely a sipper, it has a thick boozy mouthfeel and the warming sensation in the stomach starts almost instantly with this brew. The carbonation is light, but spot on for the style, and adds just enough to make the beer more complex. The finish is incredible and surprisingly dry, not sweet and boozy at all. As the beer warms the raisin and vanilla come out a bit more, making the flavors more interesting indeed."
"Update: This has become my favorite Barleywine over the years. I look forward to buying a case each year. This is the ONLY beer I buy by the case!! I'm drinking my last 2012 as the leaves fall and thunderstorms roll in. This is why I drink beer. Perfection!"
"This is a great beer. Didn't rate it the highest because I don't think this is a traditional barleywine but extremely enjoyable."
"Parts of this beer reminds me of the Central Waters bourbon barrel barleywine but more complex, brewed in my state. If I could find another bottle of this, I'd love to do a side by side tasting with that."
"World class - that's for sure. Lives up to the hype and belongs where it is now. I wish I had more of this than the 3 bottle I have left because I can only imagine how this is going to taste in a year or two."
"D: Immensely drinkable. Easily the best barleywine available. Looking forward to trying this each year."
"I love this beer."
"Perhaps the best English barleywine I have had the pleasure of drinking."
"Drinkability: I think it drinks right around the ABV. Side-by-side with the other barrel-aged classics though, it just didn't stand out to me in the same way. Then again, give this a year or two to mellow out some boozy sweetness and I could easily see this sliding into that tier."
"D: Was expecting this to be boozy and sweet with alot of heat. Surprisingly it was very well balanced and complex but never cloying. Kinda reminds me of Bourbon Barrel Angel's Share but chewier and actually carbonated. A definite sipper, but what a fantastic beer. One of the best barreled barleywines I've had."
"Chewy, thick mouthfeel. Quite an achievement. Considering the ABV, very drinkable."
"Drinkability is good for a 13.5% barleywine. While it's very rich, it's not especially cloying and the complexity keeps it interesting throughout."
"M/D - There really isn't much of an alcohol presence, but I also enjoy a glass of good bourbon. The mouthfeel is awesome; oily and coats your whole mouth with light carbonation. It's a sipper, but one I seriously can't put down."
"A overall great beer that should be seeked out by any barleywine lover."
"D - I keep sipping this one. It's very mellow considering the ABV. That said, the aftertaste does get a touch fatiguing - I don't think I'd ever have more than a bottle in one sitting. I think I like Abacus a little more, but this didn't disappoint either."
"At 13.7%, drinkablilty suffers... but you don't go through your stash of this beer willy-nilly. You savor this, sip by mother loving sip. Standing effing ovation, Pelican!"
"Bottle shared by Eric. Thanks! Pours dark amber with off white color. Aroma is oak, booze, and rubbing alcohol. Viscous mouthfeel. Flavor was dark fruit, vanilla, oak, bourbon, and finished with a rubbing alcohol aftertaste. This beer might be too green at this point. It was just hard to sip because of the rubbing alcohol aftertaste. It was tough. Shared originally Sept. 1, 2009."
"This was a great beer, but I keep on thinking afterwards that I've had some that are better. Namely the Abyss, Berserker, Canadain Breakfast Stout, Cherry Adam, Matt etc. This is definitely a beer that should remain in the top 25-50 brews available world wide."
"Mouthfeel is heavy and oily with a small bite of carbonation."
"This is an exceptional beer."
"I wasn't sure what to expect on this one. I saw everyone raving about it but just figured it wouldn't live up to the hype. Well, it lives up to the hype. It's a wonderful beer that drinks fairly easily for the high ABV. The bourbon is strong right now and I think this one becomes even better with time. Superb."
"This beer is going to be near perfect with a couple of years in the cellar."
"D - Very enjoyable but a sipper for sure."
"D- Extremely drinkable for a beer this big. So well rounded. The strong and complex malt presence complemented perfectly by an equal wave of bourbon on the back end."
"Much of the same as the last year, but more vanilla/marshmellow flavor and smell. I'd say this years is better and one of the best beers out there. So I am giving a 5. The drinkability is insane consider the ABV."
"The beer opens sweet with strong vanilla, toffee, and caramel notes. Oak adds a touch of spiciness. Bitterness is at a medium level with that same earthy quality I found in the flavor. Bourbon is well integrated, providing complexity while not dominating. Alcohol heat hints at a beer below 10%, rather than the high 13.5%. The fruit component is reminiscent of dates. The beer finishes refreshingly dry with some noticeable heat and a whisper of soy sauce and sherry. The beer has a low level of carbonation that works very well. This is a top notch -bal aged English Barleywine. I can't recommend it enough. This beer is a prime candidate for aging, too."
"1998 Evan Williams Bourbon barrels and Pelican Stormwatchers Winterfest barleywine is truly is a perfect storm."
"I really wanted to give this beer straight 5's....the only reason I docked any points was because of the weak head. Is that fair? I don't know. Everything else about the look was fantastic...but I'm just trying to be consistent with my other reviews. When I crack another one of these in the future, I will see if I still feel the same way about it as I do right now. Because right now this is on an extremely short list of the best tasting beers I've ever had. Get it now!"
"Man am I ever glad that I took the time out of my day to run down to Pelican and pick up a couple cases of this stuff. Not only is it a beautiful place, but this beer is just phenomenal. The smell is all various bourbon notes, with the vanilla and oak that you expect. Taste is more of the same with a wonderful malty backbone just behind it. The only BA beer that I've ever had that took this much flavor off the barrels is Bourbon County Stout, but this one is a little less sweet, and yet still seems to have more flavor."
"This beer is the real deal, and is easily among the best beers I have had the pleasure of enjoying. If you enjoy this style, then The Perfect Storm should be on your short list of beers to seek out."
"Outstanding."
"The buzz around this beer seems to be picking up. It's no longer a NW secret, and it shouldn't be because this is an absolutely fantastic barrel-aged barleywine. It's a keeper."
"Drinkability: Amazing in every aspect, but it's definitely a sipper. Not to mention the rarity of something like this would make me want to sit back and savor every last drop. I feel kind of honored just to have had it."
"Moderate drinkability at best, as with most of this style. It definitely has the potential for masquerading as a highly-drinkable beer due to the excellent flavors and smooth drink. Gotta be careful with this one."
"D: Incredible beer here. I wouldn't be greedy and drink a bottle by myself even though I fantasize about it. Definitely worth the hype IMHO."
"D: Drinks very well for such a huge beer. Fantastic beer."
"Poured a deeper brown color with a small sized off white head. Aromas of caramel, dark fruits (raisins), and toffee. Tastes of dark fruits, caramel, nutty, and toffee. Some alcohol in the finish (but not 13%)."
"This beer is going to give Pelican one of the greatest reputations in the country. The last sip made me shudder in oral-gasm. My belly is warm, my soul content."
"Overall, this is honestly one of the best beers I have ever had. The only beer that can even hold a candle to it is a 2002 De Dolle Oerbier Reserva I have had recently. This beer will put Pelican on the maps. Bravo!!!"
"Best barleywine I have ever except for a certain one from Midnight Sun, this beer is outstanding, has everything a barrel aged beer should, talk about an introduction to a brewery, wow, I plan on buying two different vintages of Stormwatcher soon and comparing them to this beautiful BA version, Evan Williams Single Barrel is my favorite whiskey and this certainly made this beer unforgettable, wish this stuff was more attainable but according to several people there was not much of it made and it sold out pretty quickly, one of the top beers of 2009 for me, I want more now, cannot recommend this enough"
"What a great beer!"
"This is one of those few beers that I have had that make me question if the other beers I have really loved were really that good. I can see why Pelican has decided to charge $20 per bomber. It is still a great deal, even at that price."
"Drinkability is dangerously high for such a hefty barleywine, super tasty and a real momentum builder. I kept having to remind myself of the hefty price tag and extremely limited availability so that I really savored the aftertaste of every sip, rather then compulsively chase it with another! Good enough in fact to let them slide for the condofication of Pacific City. The price though, is prohibitive, and really the biggest knock on this beer."
"May 22, '09 edit: I have no bottles left at this point. If you're trying to find some, I think it's well worth the effort to keep looking."
