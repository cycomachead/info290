"O-  I've had my fair share of aged beers.  While this wasn't terrible, for the style it could be doing a lot better.  I've had beers aged 5x longer that have held up much better.  While it was definitely worth the $5 to try, it's not something I'll be going back to try anytime soon."

"2012 edition, big beer, and probably not the best choice on the first real hot morning of summer, but whatever, it was next in line. this beer is dark amber in color like good maple syrup, and happens to both look and taste a lot like molasses. some yeast particles, and still showing a nice rich cream head. aromas of burnt sugar and slightly stale caramel malt. plenty of sugar, and plenty of booze. almost has an oak aged mellowness to it, and the alcohol never really shows up, which is possibly a product of its age. its a little too sweet for me in taste, lost in the zone between english and american styles with a strange and out of place hop profile too, which was likely more intense when this was fresh. baking spices in the finish, very autumnal, we probably should have saved this one until fall. big body that just gets impassable as it warms up. cloying sweetness and an interesting high gravity ale yeast. it didn't really hold up super well though, as the grains are a bit skunked out. not a bad brew, but not the crown jewel of the cellar by any measure either."

"I am a fan, I need to get some more and start the aging process."
""
"Taste is similar, with more dried dark fruit and sweet malty notes, and the hops have been muted, relaxed, and tempered with age. Even the alcohol content is slightly subdued. Enjoyable."
"overall - the aroma is quite a bit better than the taste."

"O - I have had this on tap at Mac's before at a band gig and was quite impressed. This does not disappoint. Would like to pick up another to hold for the winter holidays, as this would be a great winter warmer."

"Overrall: Honestly i don't see the knock on this beer, I feel like this is one of Heavy Seas best brews delivering incredible flavor and a huge punch. Too bad this is a seasonal, I picked this up a few months ago and honestly would love to have it again. Grab a glas and drink up....Salud!"
""
""
""
"A thick and rich full-medium body isn't too filling but offers the support needed for a big brew. It's got enough crispness to be lively without biting too hard for a malt-heavy beer and enough smoothness to make for good drinking."
""
""
"taste is sweet biscuit malt with lots of sweet dried fruit, caramel, and molasses with a hint of tobacco bitterness. this is very very sweet...but still pleasant and the (assuming) noble hops really balance the sweetness with a nice bitter finish without an overpowering hop flavor or aroma. Its a big beer for sure...and just what I was in the mood for on this chilly rainy day."
""
"O: Aside from the aroma, this one is average. I can't complain about it being overly sweet, as it's a pure dessert beer...I can complain about its lack of depth and middling feel, though. In addendum, the one I drank this with REALLY enjoyed it - then again, he isn't a fan of barleywines. Take that however you like."
""
""
""
"O- Pretty good barleywine. Nothing spectacular, but I enjoyed this one as much, if not more than the variants."
""
""
""
"O - For a $6 bomber of a very traditional English BW this is pretty solid stuff. Its also held up very well to two years of age (unlike their stout...)"

"2012 vintage. Interesting beer I have on my hands here. The nose is nothing to point a stick at... very normal. Malty with some hops. You would think you were sniffing Alaskan Amber at first. Surprisingly, the nose on this beer doesn't grow. After it warms, it still smells malty and grainy. Taste is much different. Sweet vanilla and bourbon. Lovely oak flavors. This beer tastes delicious, just really lacks in the nose. Overall, not much complexity to this one. It has depth... but only when you're searching for it. No puns with the ""sea theme""... just not a great beer. A tasty beer at best."

"This is somewhat disappointing compared to the two barrel aged versions. This one is very malty which I loved, but the bready malts dominate and the caramel adds more to the sticky mouthfeel than it does to the flavor. The dark fruit notes are there, but they're subtle. I did enjoy this beer, but I think their are better versions of it out there."
"22 ounce bottle into snifter, Fall 2011 bottling. Pours slightly hazy reddish brown color with a 1 finger dense cream colored head with great retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of caramel, raisin, toast, brown sugar, light roast, brown bread, floral, light pine, and herbal earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance, strength, and complexity. Taste of caramel, toast, brown sugar, raisin, brown bread, light toffee, floral, light pine, light roast, and herbal earthiness. Minimal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, brown bread, brown sugar, raisin, light roast, light toffee, floral, and herbal earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice flavor balance and complexity; though it is not as robust as I would expect for the style; with zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a fairly creamy and slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish; very smooth to sip on. Overall this is a very nice barelywine. Good balance and complexity; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering."

"If it was a woman, and you accidentally got her pregnant, you would be marrying-up, and certainly be doing your gene pool a favor. Don't really care if it is true to its EBW labeling because it just too damn good to matter."
""
"Deep amber brew with a small creamy head that quickly fades; the lacing is thick and sticky. The nose is malty, hints of black cherries and some wood are present. The taste follows suit, and the beer is a bit boozy... but hell, it should be. The mouthfeel is oily, really nice. This is a very well concieved brew, grab some if you get a chance; on cask if you can find it."
"Take some time with this one. Savor it."
""

"Drink- I think this one needs a bit of time. I am anxious to try the 2007 I have at home now. This was #2 of the day behind the bourbon and in front of the Cabernet."
"O: A really enjoyable Barley Wine that is balanced yet potent. Definitely carries the monicker well of the English rendition as opposed to the dried up and occasionally hoppy taste of BW's from the Northwest US. Find a cold night and a warm fireplace to enjoy the warming and sweet goodness. Or find a stormy lake, a pewter stein and get wrecked below decks with the crew."
""
""
""
"O: A pretty good English Barleywine sure to take the chill of on a damp December evening. There is a decent amount of bitterness but it still ends up being a bit sweet for my liking however it's well with in style."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Great aged brew!"
"Overall this was a pretty solid English-style barleywine. Not up to the top class examples of English or American styles; there is nothing inherently wrong or bad with it, it just lacks a pop to make is special or something I want to revisit again and again. I wouldn't refuse it but I won't be seeking it out anytime soon. Definitely some bonus points for the low price tag and abundant availability."

"O: Decent barley wine. Drinkable but not amazing. Nothing I'd seek out again."
""
""
""
"O/D-Interesting take on this beer. Very rich and full bodied. I only had this as a part of a beer flight, and the small glass was more than enough. Too syrupy and boozy to warrant more than a small glass in my opinion."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I remember liking the 2009 & 2010 bottles a bit more."
""
""
"Dark fruit bowl flavors stay present through out and some tasting notes of an oak aged beer oddly enough. Certainly vanilla, as well as oak or something like it. Detectable booziness plays with the other flavors to give off an imitation bourbon like note underneath it all. Lots of jammy dark fruits. Well concentrated flavors that kind of present themselves all together. They all kind of work together too. The booziness hurts the beer a little as well as the fruitiness as its a big too fruity and can be cloying at times. Not bad though and good value for the price."

"Appearance is a murky orange, short, light brown head. The nose has dark fruit, bread malts, some caramel. Below Decks has a taste of raisins, malts, caramel and salt. The mouthfeel leans towards full with a rather dry finish. A pretty good barleywine, but nothing special imho."
"O: This was pretty average overall. Just nothing special, price was $5 for the bottle, so I'd say pick it up and try it for yourself. Don't expect much more than what you pay for!"
""
""
"O - This beer is very good and I hope to get more of this. The flavors and ingredients come through each savoring taste without being overpowering. if this beer is purchased as recently bottled it would a good idea to let it age as this bottle is close to 2 years old."
""
""
"O: Not a beer you are going to break out on a special occasion, but not bad for after a long day when you want to relax."
"Off tap at Hop Heads this beer was a ruddy copper color with one finger of white head. The retention was not very good and it left scant lacing. The aroma was a blend of caramel malt, figs, a little honey and general sweet malt. The flavors were rather blas√© for a big beer. The caramel and sweet malts were present along with a touch of wood and some balancing citrus and herbal hops. Very middle-of-the-road. The mouthfeel was a bit slick, the body full and the carbonation light."
""
""
"O- Although a fairly decent Barleywine, Clipper City did nothing special. This is textbook and good, but not outstanding."
""
""
""
""
""
"I got one more vintage, hopefully that one will be better. Where is that Malt back bone. I guess it didn't survive the time."
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability ‚Äì This was a rare treat as EBAs are very difficult to come by. I enjoyed it as is but, exactly like it says on the Clipper City website, although approachable upon release this one will benefit from aging. A year in the cellar would sweeten this up just a tad, it‚Äôs borderline undersweetened for the style, and open up the malts a bit more."
""
"I would drink this again and again if in my area. Looking forward to the BBA and Cab versions."
""
"O: Considering the strength of this beer, it goes down very easily."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I have a feeling the hops used to be much bigger in the one but the age has mellowed them dramatically. I would love to try this one again fresh."

"It poured almost a cola color with a head that dissipated quickly to a ring and some lacing. The nose had a nice malt and toffee smell, but I also caught hints of the ethanol. The taste was pure English-style barley wine: with no hops and lots of caramel, honey (and hint of chocolate in my opinion). It had a pretty heavy mouthfeel with very subdued carbonation. It was almost syrupy compared to the Full Sail Boardhead sampled immediately before."
"A nice aged Barleywine, I will be sure to add some notes from a fresher bottle but this one held up nicely and I have a nice feel for the beer."
"Pours with almost no head. Dark red color. Smells like sugar. Light dark fruit smell as well. Tastes extremely watered down. It's like a barleywine was made, and then 5 gallons of water got added to it. Resembles a barleywine though. Slight dark fruit and fig flavor. Sweet and sugary. Mouthfeel is very very light and watery. Not the creamy sticky feeling I'm used to from barleywines. Overly carbonated. Not because it is actually overly carbonated, but because the carbonation is overpowering to the mouthfeel and the overall flavors of the beer. Overall, flavors aren't very good, and there's no balance. Kind of a mess."
"This is a solid example of an English barleywine but probably a little to cloyingly sweet with less complexity than I would expect."
"Still, it is a decent fare, despite that criticism, and well-worth the effort to find and sip. Especially if you prefer, say, ice wines to red wines, this would be a good choice; indeed, it would make an excellent dessert beer."
"O: For me it was a little above average. Didn't really enjoy the extreme alcohol in the beer. Could use some more hop to balance out the sweetness. Still pretty good."
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, strong kick, good representation of style, it may not be the absolute best EBW that I‚Äôve had but it‚Äôs still a solid beer."
"o - Overall this is an above average barleywine. Little bit of heat in the taste, but could be even better with more time on it. Have bottles of the bourbon and cabernet versions; think I'll sit on them a bit longer and interested to see how they are."
"Still, it was an enjoyable beer."
"Very good barleywine. I was scarred by my first encounter with Clipper City, & now have had back-to-back positive experiences. Glad to have rec'd this as an extra to further dispel my youthful doubts about this brewery!"
"Right of the bat I thought this Barley wine appeared a little thin, a little light. To my nose the heavy barley and fruit nose weren't as pronounced and at ten percent I expected my nose to sense the the alcohol beneath it. As far as taste goes, its not that I didn't like the flavor it just wasn't what I hope for in a Barley Wine. I want my pallet to be full, it doesn't need to be excessive, but the flavor should be strong and bold. I found this barley wine balanced and quaffable, for a BW I want bold and reprehensible in strenth and stature. I taste the fruit, but I want it to hit me in the face, and I want to almost have to chew the barley taste. Not as heavy in the mouth as I would like. I will drink it but there are others, if available by belly would put first."
"A little less than a full finger of light tan foam, smaller bubbles on the whole, lacing forms broad sheets yet with little stickiness. Clean liquid, if as much dark brown as any red or orange amber, multiple beads of strong tiny bubbles. The nose is sweet even for the category, molasses, caramel, maple syrup, butterscotch, milk chocolate, spiced orange reduction, it's boozy but not overpoweringly so, peach, apricot and pear close to a dried fruit character, the barley, oats and sweeter grains almost an afterthought. Full-bodied, all credit to the carbonation for trying but not quite tough enough to take the chunkiness out of the whole, has a leaden feel. Still, no lack of cocoa, chocolate, caramel, toffee and maple with a fruitcake to challah bread element as well. Here, a light hoppy bitterness comes through, a welcome addition. Brings sour orange with some lemon. The spiciness is there but without clearly distinct flavors. Wears you down by the end of the glass."
"Split a bottle with a friend last week, is supprisingly smooth, we split it while having sushi. It poured dark brown with little foam. Taste was smokey bitter sweet. It reminded me of wood in the finish. It was pretty good at hiding alcohol burn for a high octane beer. It was very sudsy. It was fairly good drinkability. I'd recomend it if you want something darker."
"This beer will get heavy rotation at my house!"
"Pretty tasty and flavorful. I'm in the unfortunate situation of having had the bourbon barrel version of the tap before trying this, so it's not as good as that. But it's pretty good. Good sipper."
"Not sure how to categorize its drinkability. It is pretty enjoyable as a sipper. Would be hard to want more than one in the same night. I would tend to want this beer at this age in small doses. With no comparison to more recent vintages it's hard to say if it improves with age. Still a pretty nice brew."
"A quite sweet barleywine bordering on cloying. Not bad, but pretty one-noted."
"1300"
"D: Quite drinkable, but not particularly memorable."
"The aroma is dusty with caramel malt, hops, and a strange off element. The appearance is brown with a large head. The taste is like the aroma. The palate is smooth. The beer is overall not bad but there are problems with it that make it hard to drink at times. I am not really a fan."
"The feel of this beer is big but not overbearing. There is not too much to this beer where is claims control and tosses you aside. It goes down pretty easy for a beer with this high and ABV and was pretty smooth going down."
"drinkability: Very nice, an easy sipper. Got 2 of these. Let's see what some time does to this."
"Poured from a brown 22 oz. bottle. Has a dark brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is rather mild, some sweetness. Taste is good, malts, dark fruits, some alcohol and a touch sweet, good complexity. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall a fine quality brew."
"Drinkability - enjoyable, great for after dinner"
"Aroma is fairly strong and malty with a tasty woody overtone and a bit of spice. It pours a dark, coppery amber with a thin off-white head. Flavor is woody and a little malty, with quite the alcohol bite. Texture is fairly smooth, but has a good alcohol nip - which should be fine for a barleywine! Definitely for barleywine nuts - I hope they give it a good high rating!"
"Pours a deep mahogany with minimal off-white head, yet leaves behind generous amounts of lacing. As far as taste and aroma, I can only compare this to soy sauce. Smelled of salty burnt toffee. Taste was overtly salty. I really don't have much good to say about this one. Not at all barleywine-esque. I don't want to degrade the brewery as I've had many other good beers from Clipper City, but this one just didn't do it for me."
"Poured a slow to emerge 2"" head which slowly dissipated to 1/8"". Very dark and clear, kind of like a cola, and with lots of slow tiny bubble action characteristic of a thick barleywine. Yet this sample is lighter in body than others I tried. Smells of barley and malt, and has some caramel, burnt sugar, and sourdough tastes. Goes down easy and I had a lot of fun with it. I'd made a note to myself that it feels like a B but tastes like an A so I'm shooting for a happy median of a B+."
"D - pretty drinkable for a barley-wine, i just don't think it would be worth going out of my way to purchase another one."
"D - Even though the alcohol is well hidden it is still a sipper. It is a filling and substantial beer. One of the earthiest beers I have tasted."
"D- Slight burn from boozy high alcohol. A bit too sweet. Delicious but rich. A definite sipper."
"I'm normally a hoppy beer guy, and this is one barley wine I can see me stealing again."
"First barelywine! Had an awesome server, Steve, who brought out multiple samples. Tried this one and had to get it, especially since it was on cask. It was very nice, indeed. Had a lot of similarities to the belgian quads that i've been feeling lately. Plus, being on cask, it wasn't served ice cold, which let all the complexities of the beer come through without numbing your tastebuds. Paired with a beer brat, this brew was delicious!"
"Poured into a snifter. Color is moderate copper with a thin white head that remains for a bit. Nose brings a good dose of sweet malt along with some light fruits and caramel. The taste is a bit too sweet without enough accompanying fruit presence. Feel is a bit cloying. Drinks well enough overall, but is just too sweet."
"Drinkability: The ABV is hidden decently enough in the taste but this was a night with three beers at least as strong as this one and even just this pint left me buzzin. Got a little to sweet for me towards the end but nothing a had a problem with"
"M: thick and rich"
"Vintage 2008. Served from bottle into a Lucifer snifter. Poured a hazy deep brown with a hint of red hue with an off-white head that was only present around the edges of the glass. Maintained decent lacing throughout. The aroma was comprised of malt, alcohol, sour note, nutty, and a subtle hop aspect. The flavor was comprised of malt, a nutty note, and subtle alcohol. It had a medium feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall I was glad this one tasted much better than it smelled. The flavors were really nice and had the right intensity. While the alcohol could be tasted, it was not at all overwhelming. Very nice Barleywine. Looking forward to trying the BA versions in the future for comparison."
"D- Nice, could be a bit smoother, and the grapejuice taste can get irritating when you're looking for a beer."
"D - Not bad for a barleywine, also not good for a 10% abv beer. This one didn't do a whole lot for me, so I doubt I'll be buying it again. I'd say it's probably worth a try though if you're a fan of barleywines."
"Clear, scarlet tinted amber with a finger of fluffy nougat colored foam that melts slowly and leaves some craggy lace on the glass. The aroma is rich and inviting.. hot buttered rum, black strap molasses and minty hops. Sweet and sticky malt flavors with an herbal tobacco leaf hop flavor in the warmingly alcoholic finish. Medium bodied with mild carbonation. This beer isn't for everyone, the alcohol is hot and in your face and is certainly on the hoppier end of the spectrum. I dig it."
"Poured a 2009 bottle into a Guinness Pint Glass. It poured very smoothly with almost no head, the head that did exist laced the glass and continued dissipating. It smelled sweet and overly boozy. The alcohol definitely took over. The taste was average, very sweet and very alcohol laden. Their was almost a metallic tint to it. The mouthfeel was excellent though. It was very, very smooth. The carbonation had almost disappeared in just eight or so months. I don't find this one very drinkable, right now. I've had it fresher and it was a little better. The Bourbon Barrel version is the way to go."
"Between the complex lush character and the lush mouthfeel and palate that lean towards drinkable this is no doubt a beer to seek out."
"Overall, it was a good ""bang for your buck"" coming in at 10% ABV, but in the line of taste, it was lacking something special."
"Poured from a cellar temperature bottle into a tulip glass. There is no date on the bottle, but I believe this is from the winter of 2009-2010. It has a tawny red/brown color that is very pretty. It looks a lot like port. The head is a thin layer of tan foam that has settled quickly to a skim. As a swirl the glass around, a good coat is left behind. The beer is translucent and I can make out a healthy amount of carbonation rising within. The aroma also reminds of a glass of port. There is warming quality. It smells alcoholic, but also of plums, raisins and oak. The beer has a strong English malt flavor. It is slightly bready, but also full of toffee, plum and caramel. Of course, there is also a lot of alcohol. The sweet coat that is left behind burns off of my mouth like the residue rubbing alcohol leaves behind. It turns into a detectable vapor that is strong but not off-putting. It doesn't have as heavy of a body as I expected; in fact, it is slightly watery. This surprising lightness is tempered by the strong alcohol burn. I like this sensation, but I can see if affecting the drinkabilty of this beer for many consumers. I'm glad I have a couple bottles still left in my cellar; I will left them sit for a while before opening them. This beer is pretty enjoyable now, but I think some age will really improve it."
"D: Another excellent offering from Clipper City. This one was great to sip."
"This barleywine is a sipper and becomes more complex as it warms. I really dig barleywines, but I think this one is a tad too sweet overall or is it that I haven't had this style of beer in a long time?"
"taste was excellent with lingering dry fruit possibly black currants on the tongue. Nice smooth texture. Very drinkable. Hides the big alcohol in a complex taste."
"Sk√ÖL!"
"Pours a clear mahogany color with less than a one finger head that leaves quickly and leaves some lacing. The smell is strong of grapes and raisons with a big malty note and some alcohol. The amount of malt kind of reminds me of a dopplebock. The taste is very similar with the exception that I picked up much more on the malt and less on the cherry. There was a clear booze bite as its going down, but not overpowering. There is a hop bitterness, but not nearly as strong as many other traditional barleywines that ive had. The mouthfeel is very smooth and enjoyable, causing it to be a very drinkable brew. A good beer from a good brewery."
"Drinkability: While I was able to finish this one, it didn't take me even the first half of the beer to decide I was not interested in a second this evening (and not because of the ABV ‚ò∫). I'll have another bottle fairly soon and revisit this review. Then I'll cellar a couple for next year to see what I think then. I'm hoping it will improve with some bottle age, but I'm not expecting I'll be buying this one again. There are several other English style Barleywines more readily available."
"D - An average at best English Barleywine... There are some redeeming qualities in this Heavy Seas offering, but they are not enough to overcome the solventy finish on the palette and the much less than stellar mouthfeel... It's not a drainpour by any stretch, but there are much much better English Barleywines out there..."
"For a barleywine, it is surprisingly of light body with a grassy mouthfeel. Hard to really define as belonging to this style since it is sweet and light enough to pass for something else. Great brewery; okay beer."
"I seem to recall not caring for this beer when I first tried it a year or so ago & it doesn't seem to be much improved with age. Still, even in the face of less-than-stellar qualities, this beer somehow manages to save itself from utter disappointment. It becomes more tolerable as it warms, though this could result from being several ounces in on a 10% abv beer. I don't imagine I'll be returning to this one."
"I¬¥d say A 3.5, S 3.5, T 4, M 4, D 4."
"I'm a big fan of barley wines, and while Below Decks doesn't fair well against the great American barley wines, it is one of the better English ones I have sampled."
"Mouthfeel is chewy, and this one is surpringly drinkable for the style."
"I was pretty pumped walking in to this new beer bar in DC on 14th street and they had this barleywine on cask. There was a nice two finger head that pumped out along with a nice malty dark base. The smell was roasty, toasty, chocolaty aroma and the taste to boot. I really liked this barleywine's mouthfeel and drinkability although take care with this one's 10% ABV. There's a slight hoppy finish as you put down the snifter and enjoy the complex flavors."
"D- Okay, this is where this beer shines. I could sell this beer to someone who thinks michelob amber bock is a real beer. You take a drink and think ""not great but pretty darn good."" Then you drink a couple more and fall off the barstool. The 10% alcohol in this beer must have been encrypted by interpol."
"All in all, this is not a great brew if you're looking for a good English Barleywine. Not a good example at all. I'd say avoid this one all around, it does not offer much."
"Drinkability: Again, this is a ho-hum barleywine. Its got the alcohol, but nothing else about it is ""big"". Its an OK smelling, OK tasting beer with little complexity or character. Clipper City in general is hit or miss, but this is somewhere in between. Not a bad beer, but not even close to a good barleywine. On the upside, its affordable and available at my grocery store. I'll cellar the last of my four-pack, but I doubt I'll buy this again."
"Ahh let it snow!"
"A rich, sweet beer. Heavy body with a light amount of carbonation. Interestingly, the alcohol is muted, perhaps due to the extreme nature of the sugar. This finishes like a Port."
"drinkability: ok"
"Try this beer. It's a great example of a Barleywine Style Ale. Some older vintages are still available. If you ask your local beer shop they may be able to dig some up for you. Great way to see what a little age can do for a great brew without having to age it yourself."
"Drinkable, but the sweetness and alcohol will hold me to 1 per night!"
"Pours a clear copper color underneath a thin lacy head. A grainy malt aroma with dark fruit esters flow up out from the brew. The drink is very caramely with fruit esters, predominately prune flavors. There is good balance but no hop presence and the drink is surprisingly viscous for the body which is only moderately heavy, but the low levels of carbonation allow it to flow much slower and fuller. The finish is sweet and malty and fades relatively quickly with a subtle warming at the end."
"D- More drinkable than I thought given the ABV. This is my first barleywine and I'm looking forward to exploring this style more."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is decent for 10% but still not something I can drink that much of. This was ok to drink one of but nothing fantastic I would seek out again."
"Good, but a bit thinner than I want in a barley wine. I don't see this improving with more age."
"single from TW, Newport News"
"Not very drinkable would not recomend this style by heavy sea."
"Extremely drinkable, I have never been the biggest fan of the Heavy Seas line but this one was enjoyable and my favorite thus far. While I have not had this fresh with at least a year on it is drinking well."
"12 ounce bottle from 2008. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours a copper/orange color with about a half inch off-white head that went away pretty quickly. Lacing is average. Aroma is sweet malt, grain, caramel, apples, and also a bit of an unpleasant aroma that I can't identify. Also, the aroma is light. It tastes like grain, figs, bread, caramel and booze. There's also a slight bitter finish. The alcohol heat is noticable, but not overpowering. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's coating and a bit creamy with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is OK, it's not hard to drink at all. This isn't one of the better barleywines I've tried, but I'd certainly try this again in the future. I think it's a decent overall brew."
"It's drinkable because I'm ready to move on to the next one. But seriously, there's not a lot of complexity going on here, so it's easier to drink than other barleywines. The 10% it's hiding creeps up on you. While I'm never disappointed that I tried a new beer, I honestly wouldn't get this one again."
"D - Big ABV, but still pretty tasty!"
"Pours from the 12 oz. bottle a medium copper color with a slightly off white one finger head that settles into a thick collar. Medium carbonation. Aroma is of malt, brown sugar, & sweet dark fruit. 1st sip is malty & slightly sweet, with a surprisingly balanced hop bitterness. Some more of the dark fruit (date? fig?) sweetness comes through with a VERY slight alcohol burn. Almost TOO slight for a 10% abv beer. Mouthfeel is slightly tingly from the carbonation. Drinkability is almost too high for a beer this potent. This is definetly a beer that could sneak up on you & bite you in the ass if you're not careful!!! All in all excellent beer, but one to be sipped slowly & carefully!"
"D: 10% ABV hidden well until approaching room temperature. When served cool (40s), there is nothing that makes you think this is anything but a good crisp ESB, as it warms up, more flavors develop and the alcohol shows."
"D - Oh my ... if it weren't for the ABV, I could imagine sitting with bottles of this all day long. Rich and fulfilling, somewhat heavy, this is an extremely enjoyable brew."
"The ABV is high, but that's to style, so overall, it's quite drinkable, but I wouldn't be reaching for a second in the same sitting."
"Excellent beer. I'm going to get a few more and see how they taste with some more age on them."
"My first beer of what I believe was a 4-pack, I didn't think I'd give this beer much of a chance, but now that I'm on my last bottle of it, I'm liking it more then I did one my first. However this beer is rather dark, I'm tempted to say ""big"" but I don't think that would be the correct word. Maybe it's the alcohol or just the style itself, I couldn't drink many of these in one sitting, but never drinking it again...well I think I quite very well might now."
"pour is deep red amber. with a head of cream. some what of a large head even. smell is nothing but unsalted crackers and wood pulp and an undertone of apple malt. i would say average but really something i wouldn't expect. one of doughest barley wines i've had. subtle fruity malt character. neutral hop quality. somewhat warm but well hidden alcohol."
"To be fair, barleywine is not my favorite style, but I've been trying all the Clipper City offerings after having the Loose Cannon, which is by far the best of the line. I've been a bit disappointed with the others, and this is no exception."
"Though it's aroma is fine style-wise, it's not a personal favorite and would keep me from drinking this one again."
"D. Could only drink a couple of these. Strong flavor and Alcohol."
"When Pearl Jam's ""Vitalogy"" came out, I bought it without hearing anything about the album. I just bought it because of the quality of the previous two albums. After listening to it, I thought it was basically a piece of crap. Well this beer was a similar experience. I bought a case, knowing that I have loved other Clipper City Heavy Seas offerings. Boy that was a mistake. Now I'm stuck with a barleywine that left me VERY disappointed. Flat looking, bland smelling, dusty-cardboard tasting.... this is a sub-par beer. I guess cellaring it like the label suggests might help, but I doubt it would help much. My advice is to avoid this beer... not worth the price."
"D Not that great. One or two only but I think that the style calls for that level of drinkability."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and smooth with a nice amount of carbonation."
"I agree with another review that this is the best in the ""bang-for-your-buck"" category. I found a 12-pack of Heavy Seas assortment pack for only $15.95 in the Columbia, SC area. The 6-packs go for $8.95.... you do the math."
"Final Thoughts - I was impressed by Heavy Seas Barleywine. I love extreme beers but this was not over the top. Definitely a good way to introduce people to barleywine or a way for more knowledgeable individuals to enjoy an easier drinking one."
"For the money, you won't find a better 12 oz bottle of brew IMO. Clipper City's $35 Heavy Seas assortment pack is the best case in the ""bang-for-your-buck"" category. Very well done!"
"2008 Vintage on Label"
"Pours a cloudy, copper color. Lots of suspended yeast are present. 1/3 inch head of an off-white color. Poor retention and poor lacing. Smells of sweet malt, alcohol, some yeast cleanliness, and some strong biscuit aromas. Fits the style of an English Barleywine. Mouth feel is smooth and slightly thick with a low carbonation level. Tastes strongly of alcohol, biscuit flavors next, sweet malt background, some very slight hops, with an alcohol finish. Not a real great blend overall, too light in body besides the alcohol."
"First review of a beer ever, let me know how I did and how I can improve."
"Below Decks isn't the best Heavy Seas brew, but it's an enjoyable little sipper if you aren't expecting the moon and the stars. With easy access, I'd probably grab a single now and again. Thanks to SkinnyElvis for coming through after I dropped my first bottle on my basement floor."
"This will be my last beer of the night after a good dinner out, sort of a nightcap. Appearance is a nice rose color, with about half a finger of white head. Good nose of sweet stone fruit, honey, caramel, little bit of chocolate. Taste has some honey sweetness, some sherry or perhaps port characteristics, raisins, tiny alcohol burn. Chewier mouthfeel than I was anticipating, with the malt riding shotgun to the hops. One is enough as far as drinking this beer, but it is still a tasty treat. Clipper City did a nice job with this beer. It certainly seems to stand as a unique brew not only because of its style, but also for its interesting traits. Cheers"
"D: Honestly, it's a bit green and lacking in the complexity I prefer in a huge abv barleywine. It does however get a bit more approachable as it warms."
"Wow, this was an unexpected treat. I've not had it fresh, but this bottle would seem to indicate that giving it some time to sit around brings out the best. Very nice English-style Barleywine!"
"The beer is surprisingly lighter bodied, with light carbonation. All of these factors blend together into one of the best drinking barleywines I have had to date. The hoppiness makes this one a bit more american in style. Definitely one I recommend."
"This is not a bad barleywine, but in an increasingly crowded niche, this one does not stand out."
"Overall, I don't know. Not bad, but nothing else. Try it, if for no other reason that to get drunk."
"d - it was good to get one on the way out. i would not want two a little to strong. but still i would want one."
"Nice looking pour with a crystal clear amber color and thin off white head. Healthy aroma of caramel, dark fruit candy and hints of alcohol. The flavor is just like the aroma with plum, date and cherry flavored hard candy. Beyond that are mild caramelized malts and caramel candy flavors. Near the end there seems to be a faint toffee note. This could probably use a bit more age."
"This is definitely a good example of its' style. It's smooth,drinkable and proof that barleywines don't always need to be aged to be enjoyed."
"Tastes better than it smells. Heavy malt, sweet and sugary with nodes of fine wood, bourbon, campfires, and pixie sticks, along with medium hops, generic tasting and lightly bitter. Nothing remarkable. Even if it's old, I expect a BW to age better than this. Still, not bad."
"Feel is in the normal range for a BW, standard. Thats is what this beer says to me, solid but certainly not trying to push any boundaries."
"Purchased a single at Liquor World in Porter Sq. Poured into my bulbous DFH snifter. Reddish brown color. Less head that I would like to see on a barleywine. Erratic lacing on the glass. Smells a bit fruity, but also very boozy. Taste was pretty straightforward. Lots of hops, dried raisins, some pear, and molasses were on my palate. Somewhat slick i.e. oily coating on the back on my throat. High abv is definitely present. A decent barleywine, but a bit harsh going down. Worth a try, but not something I'm buying again."
"Drinkabillity- Strong, this is a fireside sipper."
"Thick feel, syrup left on the palate. Middling carbonation, it does provide some prickliness that coincides nicely with the slight spice kick."
"Didn't enjoy this one in the mouth much. As an English barleywine, I was expecting a heavily malty (but balanced) brew. This is just too much cloying caramel sticky sweetness. There's some brown sugar and general maltiness as well, but the caramel dominates to the point of distraction. A tiny bit of bitterness in the background if you search for it. Mouthfeel is good if you can ignore all the sweetness, but I had to drainpour the last couple of ounces. All that sweetness really limits the drinkability."
"Drinkability: One of the more disappointing Heavy Seas brews, in my opinion. This one's just a little too green, too estery and medicinal in its fruity notes, and slightly too hot. Maybe with a little age on it (and a little more malt substance to counteract the yeast activity), this would be a great English Barleywine. I may pick up another to age for a little while."
"Much more fruity than perhaps is the norm or even really desirable for a barleywine, but easily quaffable -- perhaps a bit too much so, as this 10% ABV bomb comes back to haunt the head a few minutes later. Not as much of a warmer as barleywines tend to be, but perhaps a bit of aging might do this one some justice."
"Could benefit from some more complexity in the malt character. Bring in some sherry-like oxidation notes and perhaps a more varied ester profile and this would drink even better. None the less, I am curious to see what my last bottle will taste like when I get around to cracking it open in the next few years."
"Overall, this is not a great barleywine. It is definitely warming me up on this cold Penn State night, but not one I will reach for again."
"Between the slight sweetness and the 10%ABV, which is very well masked, BTW, this would be hard to put down more than a couple in a sitting. Very good flavor, but it would lay you out, if you gave it the chance."
"Drinkability is high. I really dig this barleywine, and it has huge sentimental value in terms of reminding me of my childhood in Baltimore, and my early adult years in Pittsburgh, where I first discovered (and purchased this particular) beer. Factor in that it's a great value, and you've got a real winner. Sadly I can't get it on any type of regular basis any more, oh well. The good news is I still have friends in town who I will surely hit up for a resupply! While I haven't had this fresh, I'm sure it should be aged at least as long as the two years I did, it certainly didn't taste like it was getting to old, but very well rounded."
"D- tasty with an interesting aroma, but i think one is enough. got it in a multi pack so the other two will go in the cellar!"
"For my first barleywine, I really enjoyed this beer. I would like to compare it to more recent vintages to see the effect that aging had on it."
"The feel is medium with a touch of slickness. Alcohol noticeable making it a sipper to be sure, but for alcohol level and style it is certainly drinkable - and enjoyable too."
"A year spent in a cool, dark place does this ale just right. Delightful for a night cap with some fruit cake cookies."
"edit- with almost three years on it, the heat has faded completely. Very easy drinking beer now."
"Overall this is basically straight up average. Nothing exceptional about it, a very blah barleywine. I won't get it again."
"D: This one goes down surprisingly easily. It could stand to be a bit more robust and aggressive, but it tastes good and packs a wallop nonetheless."
"12oz bottle thanks to vwcraig. Nice ruby color with an oily smattering of a head. This smells like cherries and egg-nog, Christmas oddly. Tastes like more malt candy, hmm. This was a little thin but I am always game for a barleywine. Thanks again for the trade Craig!"
"D: This is a mixed bag of a beer. I wouldn't call it undrinkable, but it wouldn't be my first choice."
"Mouthfeel-malty sweey with the dried fruit flavors really dominating; fig and raisin. the alcohol is present but warming. had this been drank fresh it would have been hot. A froth on the palate heightens the fruit and alcohol and the flavors stay consistant. The finish leaves a very faint bitterness-the hops were once here but have mellowed-very English. This one aged nicely and was agreat finish to the Thanksgiving Day festivities."
"Pours a dark amber color with foamy white head. Very hoppy aroma with hints of dark fruit and sweet alochol. Very hoppy, balancing out the dark fruit and alcohiol sweetness quite nicely. Sweet with nice alcohol warmth in the finish."
"price point makes me want to pick up a bottle or two to see how some time on it would be."
"An average Barley Wine from a brewery I've come to expect above average products from. I was a little disappointed."
"What this beer lacks in appearance and aroma, it makes up for in great taste and drinkability. Smells of just alcohol and isn't a very appealing pour, but it has a nice hoppy taste with an slight alcohol warming kick. It finishes clean and smooth as well. One of the better barley wines I've had."
"D: Outstanding - I continue to want more sips as the last one lingers and teases."
"D - Outstanding beer. Not the best I've had, but damn close. This is definitely hanging close to that highest echelon of good beer. This is however, more drinkable than some more aggressive barleywines, and I could probably drink two or three, though I'd be a little bit tipsy after more than one."
"Poured a ruby color with a decent head that retained fairly well. Aromas of fruits galore; cherries, figs, pie filling, apples, lots of sweet malts. Tastes of more fruity malty goodness. Lots of apples, cherries, plums, etc going on in here with a good dose of hoppiness. Alcohol was definitely detected but less hot than a fresh batch. Fairly warming going down. Mouthfeel was pretty velvety but not as rich as a lot of barleywines, not too much carbonation, and slick. Not a bad example here from Clipper City. Not the greatest of BW's but very palatable and enjoyable."
"Thanks to CrazyMacHarris99 for the bottle."
"D: A formidable beer. Could have been a little thicker on the mouthfeel, but the taste was pretty good. While the alcohol was warming, you could not really taste it at all, which I find to be a good thing. Overall, a pretty good barleywine and worth a try if you come across it."
"D - A good, if somewhat one-dimensional barleywine. This strattles an interesting line between American and English interpretations of the style. Not as smooth as I'd like, but still a great beer. Wouldn't mind having this again."
"Got this one cause I've been fairly impressed with the Clipper City stuff I've had so far. Good price, fairly solid beer (although the imperial stout was a disappointment). This one is more of the same, in my book. A surprisingly hoppy barley wine, especially one pretending (in my book) to be English (which in my experience are usually a lot maltier). This one would seem to be almost a malty IPA. A lot of malt flavor, to be sure - quite fruity, but that hops really dominates. Fairly straightforward in both the smells and tastes, with a strong caramel malt and strong(er) fruity hops, throughout. Definitely alcohol presence in there, but it's not bad. Solid beer, overall."
"Poured a dark caramel color with almost no head or caronation. Nose was of malts and some caramel. Taste was roasty caramel flavor is what you get at the beginning and there is not much to say for the mid palate and aftertaste. Not Mouthfeel was smooth but not that appealing."
"Great drinkability for the ABV & style. Damn good English BW"
"d: Pretty nice barleywine overall. I should try one fresh for comparison purposes, this was the 2007 bottling."
"Decent enough barleywine which could be better balanced. I like the dark fruit flavor but the all-too-noticable ABV causes the drinkability to suffer."
"Exceptionally smooth with nice carbonation. Nice drinkability for the style."
"A sweeter barleywine than I'm used too. Not bad, but all the sweetness makes it less of a drinker for me."
"this 2006 barley wine pours a nice clear red color with an off white head that fades to a thin film. the aroma is very malty, not quite enough hops to really stand out. the taste on the other hand is very nice with a lot of malt character and a dry hoppy finish. the mouthfeel is a little heavy for me, but the warmth makes up for that."
"Worth a shot, but better barleywines are out there."
"I wanna try a younger bottle"
"Well 18 months certainly did this bottle good. I'll definitely be looking for this one again. Maybe even do a vertical tasting with it. Heed the label, and stay below decks if your planning a night with this contemplative baby."
"Drinkability: I bought a six pack of this awhile ago and remember not being impressed... aging has done this one some good... 2005 on the label... 5313 on the bottom... so about 2.5 years... I'm very impressed, I must locate my other 3 or 4 bottles."
"It's not very heavy on the tongue; I'd certainly call it medium-bodied. The carbonation is about right for the style. This is one of the more approachable barleywines, although it can lull one into a false sense of security soon with that 10%ABV."
"A mahogany colored brew with amber tints, good carbonation keeps the two-finger around for a minute and left some lacings down the mug. A slightly heavy alcohol smell with a good base of sweet malts - caramel, honey, syrup - also something woody in there as well. A good hop presence as well. A rather thick-bodied beer, it packs a malty punch on the first sip with the sweet malts kicking in gear but balanced with a dryness from some hops and oak or some wood. Not perfectly balanced, but a sweetness is there as well as the alcohol (hidden for the most part) and hops for a good beer. This is a good beer, I just couldn't session it if I wanted to."
"Toasted biscuit malts up front give way to sweet toffee and caramel. Some sugary fruits as well. Singed, almost roasted quality turns into herbal hop bitterness. Gets a little boozy and rummy in the finish. A little bit hot. Full-bodied with a smooth, creamy feel. Not too bad. A little rough around the edges."
" A wonderful sipper."
"Drinkablity: given the abv(10%), this isn't that bad. went through one pretty easy, and I wish I had another to keep the 1st one company."
"D: If you haven't tried Clipper city brews you need to. The Heavy Seas line is outstanding, and this one is no different. 10% packs a punch so don't have too many. But an excellent English barleywine."
"This barleywine is a pretty clear copper color with a medium light tan head and blanketing lace. It has a beautiful aroma of nutty malt and mild fruit nougat hops. The taste is malty and creamy with a grassy back. I pick up horshound/root beer hints, sweet with good alcohol but not too heavy. Even carbonation and reasonably drinkable for a barley wine. Very nice."
"Pours a deep chestnut brown and isjust a little lighter around the edges. The tan white head dissipates quickly leaving a thin white filmy ring that clings to the glass pretty well. Smells of a dull wine with a sweet tinge to it. Tastes pretty much like I would expect a decent barleywine to taste. A little sweet with an earthy malt and sweet bread finish. Mouthfeel is a little thinck as the alcohol hits first and really doesn't let go too easily. It's somewhat drinkable for a barleywine. I really don't think one should make a night out of drinking barleywine unless you want a seriously bad morning."
"D : It's a good barleywine that definitely is worth having more than one"
"this is a good beer, at 10% its easy drinking. its a more mellow barley wine. but very good just the same."
"12oz bottle purchased from Bauer Wines in Boston. Pours a clear dark ruby. The aroma is sweet. Too sweet. I'm scared before the first sip. First taste is not AS sweet as I was worried about (phew) though it still has a good wallop of sweetness, which isn't really my thing. I think it is ""sherry"" flavours that this beer has, but I'm not sure because I never drink sherry. But it's one of those flavours that used to make me think I didn't like barley wines."
"Pours a dark copper hue, with little to mention about the head. Smells of Apples, prunes, raisins, and yet nothing to powerful. The palate actually is quite light, really the nose completely dominates everything leaving the palate feel left out. The alcohol shows at the finish in a way thats very clean and not offensive. A very drinkable barley wine, although very simplistic."
"Cheers"
"D: The beer gets bigger as it gets warmer with some boozy alcohol coming through making this a big, warming barleywine style with moderate good drinkability."
"...and it does not disappoint. First taste is very strong malt sweetness followed by alcohol bitterness. Dark, dried fruit and candied oranges come to mind. The high alcohol content consistently comes into play. Its almost brandy-like in some ways. Overall, its a very, very flavorful, full-bodied and voluptuous beer."
"Thanks, vwcraig, for the chance to try the 2008 version, which tastes pretty similar although the hops are more prominent as it has not aged as long as my previous tasting"
"Eric"
"D- Goes down extremely smooth and easy- almost too smooth to be called a barleywine. This sweet tasty offering disguises its alcohol content better than most."
"This poured a dark clear copper with off-white head. It smelled like honey wheat with a bit of sourness. It tasted like hops and wheat mixed with some honey but not too sweet. It was moderately thick with a little carbonation and a bitter aftertaste. Overall this wasn't easy to drink, but not overly powerful either. One of the more enjoyable barleywines I've had, since it kept its flavor in moderation."
"An exceptionally bland and tasteless barleywine. Surprisingly the 10% alcohol is hardly noticeable. That being said, this beer is good for one thing and one thing only... Getting DRUNK. Forget the 30 of Natty, funnel 6 of these puppies and you'll be felching fatties in no time."
"This is a good but fairly straightforward barleywine. There are certainly better ones around. Yet this is worth having, and definitely enjoyable. Recommended."
"A representative example of the English style Barleywine. There is no super hoppiness like in American styles and a lighter bitterness, but still a nice sipping beer."
"D = This is a pleasant beer, but there are so many other English barleywines I like better, I do not know how often I will have it."
"Definitely not the best barleywine I've tried, but this one was still a solid and enjoyable sample that is certainly worth a try..."
"I wasn't really into this on the first couple tries, but it's winning me over slowly. Maybe my preferences for the aggressive U.S. versions kept me from appreciating its more subtle take on the style. Because of its thickness and higher ABV, and also because if I'm going to choose a barleywine I'd choose many others over this, drinkability is merely okay. All in all, absolutely worth a try. Give it a few chances, it's kind of a grower."
"D - This is a pretty good barleywine. Very well balanced and not overpowering."
"O: i'm a bit new at barley-wines but i've had several and i like this one a lot. i think the subtlety of the flavours rounds out the intensity of the alcohol impressively. a very big beer hiding under a small table. or something. either way i recommend it."
"Overall not half bad at all. I will admit that I have had better barleywines over the years, there is no doubt regarding this, but this was still a solid offering and really well done. One of the more mellow ones out there and if you are just looking to get into the style this might be a good place to start. Definitly worth a try!"
"Pours a clear chestnut red color with little head to speak of. Big malt aroma with hints of dark fruit. Taste is malty, figs, dates, brown sugar - those were the things that came to mind as i was drinking it. Hops are barely present. A bit sweet, but not cloying, mouthfeel is on the medium side. Not an overly complex beer, but worth a try. Would I buy this one again? Probably not just because there are better barleywines to be had, but I'm glad I tried it."
"Pours a deep almost burgundy color with one finger of light tan head the receeds cleanly off the side of teh glass. Aroma is alcoholy. Some sweet caramel and toffee. Taste is alright. It is sweet, alcoholy, some caramel notes. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and slightly syrupy. Drinkability is good, but at 10% ABV it can overwhelm."
"I thought this beer would mellow out with over a year under its belt, but it seems to have gotten stronger. It's slightly above average."
"Drinkability: Being at 10%/abv I doubt I would have more than one of these in a sitting, but then again never say never. I would recommend this beer to anyone."
"Drinkability: For a barleywine, this is pretty smooth. Lack of alcoholic character helps it out quite a bit."
"Pours a nice dark golden color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy tan head, which leaves some nice small islands and sticky lacing. The nose is malty, slightly sweet, some toffee/caramel. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, spicy, and toffee/caramel. The alcohol is hidden pretty well with this one, as in not over-powering. Medium body. Very drinkable, this is a treat for sure, thanks Joe."
"Heavy Seas - Below Decks (Barley Wine Style Ale) pours a dark brown that appears orange when held up to the light. It has a thin off white head and came in a twelve ounce bottle. Caramel malt and some fruity esters are noticeable in the aroma. The flavor is pleasant enough, caramel malt being the biggest flavor, and once again fruity/estery flavors are also present. This is a pleasant enough beer, but it's a bit wimpy by barley wine standards. By the way, this is definitely an English stlye barley wine as the hops really aren't noticeable. I enjoyed it, it's worth a try."
"I made myself sit and finish in hopes that it would open from warming and time, but the taste did not change."
"D - One of the best balanced and barleywine's I've had. Rich, tasty and drinkable."
"Notes: This reminded me of a cross between an oak-aged strong ale and a barleywine, as I really got a pretty strong sense of wood. I prefer my barleywines to have a bit more of a hoppy presence -- American hops -- so I didn't love this one. It wasn't bad, just not my personal preference for the style."
"There's a nice balance for the style. A nice interpretation of an English-style Barleywine, with a touch more fruitiness. Alcohol noticeable making it a sipper to be sure, but for alcohol level and style it is certainly drinkable - and enjoyable too."
"12 oz brown bottle part of the Heavy Seas variety pack. Pours a deep mahogany/copper with a thin tan head. Not much head retention. Aroma is of sweet dark fruits (raisons, figs) and alcohol. Taste is sweet with a just hint of bitter hops. A slight alcohol burn at the finish. Mouthfeel is a little on the thin side. Personally, I preferred their ""Hang Ten"" Weisenbock to this."
"BK III"
"This is a pretty good brew, with a smooth finish and a decent amount of complexity. It's a good break from the dominant American Barley Wines found here in the U.S. After a year or two this one settles down nicely to become smooth and malty. Recommended fresh or aged."
"D- This is just kind of a beast with some alcohol burn. There is a surprising lack of hop presence. I will not be getting this again."
"Label on bottle reads 2006. Pours a clear but dark brown. No head. Nose is kind of a roasted thing going on with some fruits in there as well. It¬ís fairly mild. Flavor has a big zing to it. Noticeable alcohol and an almost meaty texture to it. Feel has a good carbonation to it. Overall this was okay. I feel like it is either way too tight and needs to sleep for a lot longer, or it is just lacking and will never show an interesting side. Nice to try, but probably should have waited at least 2 or 3 more years (or more) to see it at its best (if it can get to that point at all)."
"D- pretty solid but doesnt quite have the kick of an old guardian or Y2k catastrophe ale, but it is pretty malt driven example as opposed to hops and works quite well on that front"
"I think this is a drinkable beer if it were a Scottish ale, but it's lacking a little bit of everything a barleywine needs. Goes down quick because of the light body, at 10%, which I have a hard time believing, this is really a way you could drink quite a bit of alcohol without feeling weighed-down."
"I've had a lot of barley wines, both english and american, and this is quite possibly the tamest one I've ever had. It's like a typical ""micro-brew"" pale ale, but just up a notch slightly. I wouldn't even know it's barely wine if I hadn't read the label. It's not bad in any way at all, just very tame."
"Pours a brown-ish, deep amber color with a light tan head. In the aroma, sugary dark fruit. In the taste, a small licorice and sugary dark fruit. A mainly smooth, with small bite in the mouthfeel and a dry licorice aftertaste. Sweet nose to a dry taste. Nice smooth flavors, while hiding the alcohol very well."
"Feels thick and heavy. Syrupy. Good texture (too bad the taste doesn't quite live up). Not at all bad, but not something I'd crave. Decent, not fantastic."
"Mouthfeel is very soft and full bodied. Not syrupy but still thick and velvety. Very nice English style barleywine."
"D: This is an ok beer but not one of their best, drinkable but not very memorable. Worth trying if you get a deal or someone else is buying."
"M/D: Carbonation is tad high, body is full but could use some bolstering. Drinkability is lower than expected after first look and smell. The taste is just so off."
"A nice example of the style, nothing earthshattering, but still quite worthy. I cellared this bottle for over a year and it does seem to have helped it."
"This one is decent - no off flavors, nothing overpowering. I'd prefer to see it... With less residual sweetness. Like an old ale. A sweet one, that is!"
"This beer has a nice dark camber color with a short white head with a copper tint. The beer smells alot like brew made from malt extract. It has a fruity/winey aroma. The taste is pretty good with a sweet hint of barley malt. It has a real fruity flavor like a wine would have. The high alcohol is not readily detectable until later on in the aftertaste. It has a really high carbonation for a beer of this body, but it really does it justice in disguising the high alcohol. It is failry drinkable and probably no more than 1 or 2 because of the high content and very strong flavor. Worth a try."
"This brew pours a dark orange/brown color with a medium thick and foamy light tan head. Aroma of malt and dark fruits. Medium body with a bready malt character. Weak on the hops side for a Barley Wine, and has some biting alcohol and fruity flavors thrown in. The finish is dry and mildly bitter. Overall this beer seems kind of disjointed, not sure I would bother with it again."
"Drinkability: let this brew warm up and calm down. Alcohol at 10% is very noticeable. I'll drink the next one as a nightcap at the end of a special day, maybe a year from now."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a Delirium Tremens tulip glass. The appearance was nice, burgandy colored, clear, with a thin white ring of head. The smell wasn't too bad either, sweet and malty with hints of Old Nick or Bigfoot. But everything went to Hell once I tasted it, bleck. The alcohol was really apparent, not masked or anything. And the flavor was intensely bitter in a biting and unappealing way. Just not good at all, maybe I had a bad bottle but I won't likely try it ever again."
"Pours a four finger light tan head that fades slowly leaving some lace. Nice clear amber/mahogany color. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Sweet woody, maybe caramel nose. Flavor has some caramel with hints of the higher ABV then noticeable alcohol finish. $2.20 for a 12oz bottle from Tully's Beer and Wine Wells, ME."
"Pours a deep copper with a thin tan head. Not much retention,but a decent lacing. Aroma is of sweet dark fruits,and alchol.Body is thick with some carbonation. Taste is sweet with a little hint of bitter hops.the alchol burns nicely in the finish. Just a hint of an after taste lowered my rating a bit. Worth a try."
"Relatively average mouthfeel with a sweet, full-bodied finish."
"Coming up to temperature the beer improves, but doesn't salvage the whole experience. Not a great barleywine. This was simple bottled too soon -- I don't have hope that it's worth the space in my cellar."
"Pours a clear caramel body leaving a thin off-white head. The nose is fruity, apple, grass, earthy notes. The taste starts malty upfront, displaying a citrus bitterness that helps to balance this beer. The finish is smooth, boozey, and traditional English style. Overall this is a nice barleywine one that brings a little old world flavor on the palate."
"Drinkability - Great considering the alcohol content. Im impressed."
"Not too thick or heavy in the mouth, carbonation is light. This will hopefully do much better in a year or more. Gonna save the other two until then."
"Seems like a good example of the style, but nothing I'll seek out again."
"Dark red translucent body with a quarter inch of off-white head. Smells like caramel malt with strong hints of alcohol. Tastes sweet, with biscuit and caramel malts playing a strong role. Slightly alcoholic on the finish, as well as having a slight hint of hops. Syrupy and creamy in its thickness. Predictably not as drinkable as many other beers, but more drinkable than some other examples of the style. A pretty solid beer, and a decent barley wine."
"Overall a pretty decent beer. Alcohol burn may be a little harsh for some people. As with most barley wines, I am looking forward to what cellaring will do to the character. Certainly worth a try."
"Beer poured a hazy amber color into my tulip glass. Looked lika glass of iced tea, very little head, just a slight ring on the edge of the glass. The aroma was sweet and citrusy. Slight hints of the high abv. The taste was malty sweet upfront with some citrus notes rounding things out. The high abv is evident but it does not hit you over the head."
"D: Lacks balance and has some real undesirable aspects to it. I can¬ít get this dirty flavor out of my mouth. I¬íd pass on this one."
"This one is better than the overall rating suggests so I felt it necessary to put my two cents in. This is a barley wine with the consistency of a stout and the sweetness of certain Belgian Dubbels I have had. It is a bit too sweet for long term drinking but has a very nice strong malt taste with a bite of alcohol at the end. This one should probably be aged for about a year to get its full potential."
"This amber/orange beer poured pretty clear with a light beige foam that quickly fell to a ring and left behind a bit of fine lace. Pleasant enough aroma, oranges and caramel with a hint of vanilla. But it also had a bit of mustiness and vegetal character to it. The flavour was thin, especially for a barleywine. It was sticky sweet, fruity (think tangerine or orange character from hops), with a little alcohol warmth. Thick, low attenuation with carbonation on the low side made for a texture that was a bit of a mess. It wasn't offensive at all, but just not what I consider a good, or even passable, English barleywine. The flavour that was present fell away by the finish and it had little in the way of complexity."
"Drinkability: I enjoyed this over the course of about three hours, so it's definately a sipping beer. It became more complex as it warmed, but the roasted coffee flavor was front and center. This might age well, so I think I'll squirrel a few away for about two years."
"The beers pours a beautiful amber mahogany color, with excellent head retention and very good lacing. On the nose there is a huge blast of citrus from the hops, along with some undeerelying malty sweetness. On the palate one gets a lot of sweet malt again, but with an excellent citrus back drop from the hops. Flavors included cherry cough drop, almonds, citrus and some addtional nuttiness. The beer has a very nice soft mouthfeel and is suprisingly smooth. The beer is also surprisingly drinkable, and the abv. not all that noticeable. The beer finishes with a long, lingering, hoppy finish. Quite a good beer."
"Pours a dark brownish amber color with an off-white head. The malty aroma displays some caramel flavors as well as some phenols. The taste starts out with some smooth malts flavors and ends with the hops bringing up the dry finish. Overall, this is a pretty decent barley wine but it doesn't really stand out in any way to make it worthy of a repeat purchase."
"red to crimson with some floaties in there and a soft pillowy head. Sticky hop odor, some cherries, prominent alcohol smell. Taste is a fruity ethanol flavor, harsh in its attack. Some maltiness, but mostly just a cherry and ethanol punch that's not all that enjoyable. sticky and thick and not all that great. definitely my least favorite of an otherwise darn good series of beers."
"Don't drink and review."
"This is probably the highest alcohol beer I have yet to drink that is able to completely hide the alcohol content.While I was sharing the bottle with fellow BA mtanji, I checked the alcohol content, and neither one of us could believe it."
"overall a good beer to have, wish i would have stored it. i'll try to get another."
"This stuff is really good and really enjoyable.I was expecting a totally different taste but wow was I wrong.I wanna drink it fast but I know the alcohol will catch up with me so I must sip and enjoy it."
"Drinkability: On par with Brooklyn's Monster I think (as I'm a fan of that also), but I would indeed like to see how this ages, especially since it's fairly balanced for the semi-green stage currently. A nice sipper that's pleasant, and one that's not too harsh, though it lacks what many people may be looking for in the style, which is the complexity (which I like to think will come out even more with the aging)."
"D - Very tasty, but wicked. Nice blend of malts and mellow presence at first. Shows it strength eventually. Nicely balanced with a display of vigor."
"Yeah, somewhat a plain Jane, but drinkable and enjoyable never-the-less."
"I really liked this brewery's imperial stout Peg Leg (even though other reviewers didn't seem to so much), but I think I agree with everyone else as far as this brew goes. I have another bottle though, so I'll see what it tastes like a year or two down the road. But that's just out of curiosity, as I wouldn't really expect it to improve at all."
"(2005 vintage) Bottle courtesy of Sammy: Poured a light amber color ale with small foamy head with minimal retention and lacing. Aroma of dry malt is quiet weak compared to what I was expecting. Taste is strong on cardboard which is probably due to oxidation (makes me wonder about that label mentioning that this will aged with the best of them). I couldn¬ít notice any hops and malt was slightly watery with no sweetness at all. Definitely not something I would go back for in the future."
"Rather bland mouthfeel and flavor profile with muted dark fruit overtones, hot alcohol, and not much else. With the exception of the gorgeous appearance, and I can't really recommend this one."
"D - Worth a try but I wouldn't recommend it for a Barleywine. May have been too early to drink."
"Pours a nice dark amber with off whit head and nice sticky lacing. First note from the bottle was alcohol with minimal sweetness. Not what I expected from an English Barleywine. Not as sweet as it should be, not as hoppy as an American Barleywine. In all, it's not as sweet as it should be and a little too hoppy. Amost fits better as a weak American BW. Mouthfeel is a little thin and watery. Easy to drink as it is well balanced, which an English Barleywine shouldn't be."
"The pour into my La Moneuse glass raises a one finger light tan head over a deep, hazy garnet body with a lot of suspended yeast particles. The head falls lazily leaving pretty sticky lacing in its wake. Really nice for the ABV. The nose has a strong citrus hop character, but in close balance with a sweet caramel aroma. Kind of simple, though. The taste is medium-sweet, caramely, and without much hop bitterness. Very balanced and talented at hiding the high ABV. The mouth is medium-thick, with very light, fine carbonation. This would make a good intro into barleywines for novices, and would also impress many for its mellow taste and high alcohol."
"I was highly unimpressed with this beer when first released. However, I think we have a whole new ballgame. Nice, copper color with a sizeable (for a barleywine) head. Mellow aroma-very malty and sweet, treacle like. Flavor is all about the malt-big malt taste to it. Minimal bitterness. Great caramel and treacle flavors. Faint, faint smokiness. Reads like a classic UK barleywine. Good body. Very drinkable. Higher abv then a UK barleywine but this sucker is major league smooth. Very impressive. I have 1 from last year I will explore again but the harshness and low points from the first release are gone."
"Poured into a pint glass with a thin off white head that was mostly diminishing. Aroma was very malty, it had a good sweetness to it. The taste on the other hand was WAY too bitter, even for a barley wine. The alcohol was not hidden at all, fully showing it's 11% volume. Far from the top of my list when it comes to barley wines, but I'm still going to age a couple and see if they improve."
"A nicely balanced barleywind. Strong but not overpowering. Neither cloyingly sweet nor a hop bomb - eminently drinkable."
"Cheers."
"Had this as part of a blind tasting. At least I figured it out was a Barley Wine. Reddish hues with a thin wisp of lacing. Constant carbonation, but nothing out of the ordinary appearance-wise. Smells of currants, a bit hoppy fragrance as well. Medium body and not as hot, considering the alcohol content. Not one of my favorites for the style, but average."
"D - Nice flavors, and I'm glad I tried it. Saying that, I probably won't try another, but it's a good call in my book."
"Cheers!"
"Not my favorite Barleywine....yet."
"Mouthfeel- Had the warmth, just lacked the depth of flavor to make my palate say ahhh."
"Pours a clear red-amber with a two finger head of dense, pale-biege soap bubbles. Decent retention and weak spotty lacing. Lots of crystal malt and Fuggles in the nose, along with slight apple-ester and buiscuity malt aromas. Toasted malts and caramel flavors upfront, followed by malto dextrin taste and and nice blend of soft citrusy american hops (Amarillo?)and herbal fuggle hop flavor. Aftertaste is a little slick with the dextrins lingering and showing signs of cidery booze, then slowly dries out with english hop biterness. This demonstrates the balanaced profile of an English-style Barley Wine fairly well. The carbonation is light but seems appropriate given the full-body and rich dextrinous texture. Finishes borderline cloying and certainly residual, lots of toasty caramel and apparent estery alcohol. The english hops really hold on and slowly put the flavor back in check to secure a respectable drinkability. Flawed by the one-dimensiaonal malt and ester, but this is a welcome change from Clipper City's underwhelming ""Heavy Seas"" line-up."
"drinkable?: it sure is, even though its not that good."
"-Oelergud"
"Pours a clear ruby red with a large tan foamy head. The head is OK,not much lacing, but the color is lighter than other b/w's. The smell is very ""bisquity"" with dark fruit and alcohol aromas. Nice smell ,not too strong,but very pronounced. The taste is like the smell, alot of bready yeast, some dark fruit, and alcohol. it's not bad,but the m/f is thinner and not as bold compared to most b/w's. A good tasting beer,but not up to b/w styles. It's too thin and weak,although this does a good job of hiding the alcohol. I like it, I just think it could be more."
"Tastes sweet with a tangy orange. Fruity esters of apricot tempered by a mild pepper on the tongue. Sweet shows a brief appearance and then the beer finishes quite dry. A bit of light woody. Alcohol is present, but nearly slips by, as it is quite clean of fusels. Mouthfeel is thick, holding the sweet on the tongue a bit longer than usual, which is a good thing in this case. Carbonation is much too strong for the style and way to soda-pop like."
"Flavor is okay. I prefer the american barleywines, but for an english, I suppose this is pretty much right on style. Malty, soil and dirt flavors, minimal hops if any. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied. Nice carbonation gives this beer a nice mouthfeel. Alcohol is certainly noticeable and makes this a one bottle type beer. A nice english BW, but I prefer the american version."
"I won't be getting this one again."
"D- It is pretty good. It is a decent barley wine but nothing to go crazy about."
"Overall a good beer that I recommend."
"I could drink a few of these at a time but I would have to be 'cared' for."
"Poured a pretty reddish/amber color with a large 2 inch head that took a while to subside. I didn't expect such a lively head for a beer of this strength. Aroma was fruity and malty with some hints of grape and prunes in the nose. Taste was quite fruity and malty sweet, reminding me of maple syrup and ripe fruit. Some alcoholic warmth was noted as the beer warmed to room temperature. Mouthfeel was kind of light for such as strong beer. Overall, not much going on here except for a lot of sweet flavors and alcohol. Perhaps a little bit of cellaring is in order? Not a bad attempt at a barleywine, but a little boring in my opinion."
"English style Barleywines in general have been more of a hit and miss proposition for me than their American style counterparts, nonetheless when a new one shows up on the store shelves, I am pretty much set on trying it; and such was the case when I noticed, and immediately brought home, a 4-pack of Below Decks from clipper city. I chose a Duvel tulip for the primal tasting, and the beer came of amber brown in color, and clear. The head was small at first and disintegrated to a ring of bubbles shortly thereafter. The looks were typical for the style, but that is rarely the point of a Barleywine anyway. The smell was loaded with a plethora of fruits which were hard to characterize into individual types. There was also a salty air about this beer, which was appropriate considering the maritime theme on the label. The taste was punchy and not well melded. There was an odd clash sweet and sharp flavors in each sip with alcohol trying to play a spicy (but unsuccessful) mediator. Thick bodied, but not soft, this seemed to lack a lot of polished qualities at the time of release. I think a couple of years in the cellars will smooth out the rough edges, and bring the favorable qualities more to the forefront. At this time though, this was a little too harsh and aggravating. Pick up if you have some storage space for it to mature."
"This isn't the most complex barleywine you'll find, but it struck me as being very well rounded, with nice depth of malt and fruit flavors, not overly sweet and potent without being overpowering. Flavorful and drinkable seem a rare combination in this category. Predominant caramel malt and raw cane sugar, with raisin and prune. Alcohol lent some black pepper notes at the end. One of the few barlewines I've wanted more than one of in a sitting, although this might be ill-advised."
"Nice...intoxicating, but nice."
"This one wasn't bad, but wasn't overly impressive. Sort of a middle of the road barleywine. No real flaws (save for a very mild aroma) but no attributes really stick out either."
"Thanks to kmpitz2 for the taste."
"It's sweet with a touch of savory. The aroma is a bit thin dimensionally, but once it hits the lips, all is well. It's decently drinkable, almost in spite of an ABV that's meaty and does its best to put a damper on things. Below deck, above deck, whatever deck, this one is worth a try by the side of the fire."
"Drinkability: By no means an exceptional beer, or even one that is complex or distinguishing. Just a vague sweetness and some alcohol."
"Served at nearly room temperature, in a snifter, from a twelve ounce bottle. Poured a deep brownish red color, with very little bubbly white head. Left very little lace on the glass. Not a very strong smell coming from my glass. Smelled very faintly of brown sugar , whiskey , and some alcohol. Smoothly tasted of cheap whisky, dark dried fruits (mostly cherry), and very well hidden hops. Had a warming alcohol finish. Pretty drinkable , full-bodied barleywine. Worth a shot."
"The taste wasn't what I figured on though after accouple ( at 11%, not at once) the acctual taste grew on me. Sweet malts, pine, rum like alcohol warms this full bodied beer. I like a good Strong beer, thisone is, though I think its balanced with alcohol more than hops. Hops are not a big player here, though the beer isn't to sweet to drink. It is balanced enough to aid the drinkability well. The mouth is left alittle dry but warmed. A smooth brew to be had. Worth the 4-pack price of $9."
"Terrific beer. Full of malts, hops, alcohol, and flavor. Starts off with a burgundy hue and terrific off-white head retention. Flavors of strong fruits, sweet malts, and rum. Strong fruit flavors of figs, cherries dates, raisons and prunes. All fruits seem fresh and strong, like fruitcake. Malts, though strong, don't seem too syrupy or cloying. Hopping knoks the brew out of the English Barleywine range, but makes for a good American Barleywine. Citursy and piney deep into the finsih. Alcohols are a bit too hot and harsh, but is a quick reminder of the 'kick' that the brew has. Finishes sweet and strong, with a lingering alcohol and hop character."
"Thinnish mouthfeel for the style, I like these a bit heavier and slick. Carbonation wasn't as evident as I thought it was going to be. Overall good drinkability. This one is way to easy to put down for its ABV level. Aroma and taste aren't overly spectactular, but the easy of drinking helps this out a lot."
"ALways good to see people brew the English style BW although they are rarely so freaking strong. Good looking beer with sublte alcohol and malt on the nose. Buried deep underneath both was a maple sweetness. Surprsing it was very easy to drink with great balance and mouthfeel. Not sure why this was retired but I would buy more and sit on it for at least a year. Well done CCB."
"12 ouncer recently purchased in Fairfield Ct. No freshness indication. Pours clear bright brandy hued amber, with just a slight tan head and leaving minimal lacing. Nose of some brandy and alcohol. notes here of smoky malts, more rum/brandy. Overly sweet in the finish, with some ""hot"" alcohol notes. Another reviewer mentioned ""plastic"" flavor notes and this is a good description of what is going on here. Kind of thin in the body and lacking in the flavor and complexity departments. BWines that are not that great really are a waste of brain cells and not very enjoyable to even sip. Glad I only picked up a single bottle"
"($7.99 / 4-pack)"
"Very thin on the palate and in the flavor profile. Nothing bad to speak of (aside from the plastic aftertaste) but absolutely nothing stands out. Some woody characteristics and brown sugary malt, and then booze. And then plastic. Carbonation is low is barely stings the tip of the tongue. Hops? Complexity? Nay! This is more ADV (alcohol delivery vehicle) than delicious barleywine."
"Not what I want in a barleywine. Simplistic, which can be fine, but this is in the same area as an amber ale. Generalized caramel sweetness, mild overall, and a bit cloying. There is some bitterness, but it's so incredibly sweet right up front that I found myself gulping sips at the end, to spare myself the sugary feeling sitting on the tip of my tongue. I like to sit and enjoy beers of this strength, not try to get rid of them. Maybe good for someone testing the waters of big beer, not quite ready for the flavor explosion yet."
"D - high, one could easily pound this beer, sweet with just enough bitter to keep it honest, a great b-wine"
"I've always enjoyed this beer in bottles; last night I had it on tap and was even more impressed. It starts out with a surprisingly large head, mellow but promising aroma, and great mouthfeel. The flavor is wonderfully malty. Hops are subtle but present. The high alcohol content is not at all apparent due to the overall smoothness of the beer. This almost reminds me of a Belgian strong dark, but as an English barleywine, it is supposed to have that sweetness to it. I'd say this is another success by Hugh, creating another unique take on a classic style that is both complex and incredibly drinkable. An aside: I once had this in firken, dry hopped, and its character was completely different, but also wonderful."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" beige head above the slightly hazy copper brew. Meringey head lasts nicely, with average to good lacing. Aroma is so sedate that I really don't pick up anything. Taste is overly sweet, with bitterness present as well later, and a lingering alcoholic bitter close. Mouthfeel is just too harsh for the usually mellow English style, and drinkability is just not there for me. Not my favorite Heavy Seas brew, for sure."
"Overall.... not bad, but far from great."
"Poured clear but dulled copper with a white one finger head after a hard pour,aromas are really bland for lack of another word some sweet alcohol with drier malt just nothing going on but not bad like I said bland.As with the aromas somewhat bland but a little more character sweet alcohol is prevalent along with some caramel malt finishing with just a tinge of pine but not enough to get excited about.This beer could be alot better it has some good points but not enough to search out."
"12 oz bottle. Pours a very right amber color with a finger of ivory head that maintains very well. Clarity is excellent and a moderate cascade of bubbles make their way to the top helping the head keep its form. Nose is fairly fruity, with a solid caramel and toasty character. A moderate piney hop and a puff of alcohol are in the backgroud as well. Flavor is right there with the aroma. Solid caramel and toasty British malt with a little alcohol interaction in there that gives it a bit of a chemically flavor. This all fades to a solid earthy and piney hop and a very solid toastyness. This one is a bit drying, sucking all the moisture from the sides of my tongue. Burps are slightly fruity as well. The apparent alcohol is a little detracting. There may even be a little smokey phenols in there. Feel is thick, with a light to moderate carbonation. Very solid feel to this one. Drinkability is pretty good. I just checked the ABV, so its not a surprise, at 11%, that it comes through a little in the flavor. I like the flavor, especially the toastyness that comes through on the finish. Overall, a nice English barleywine. I think some time would mellow it out a bit."
"The beer pours an amber color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a warm, malty scent that boasts of pale and crystal malts along with a dry and slightly bitter hop aroma. It seems to have some breadlike qualities. The taste is good. It has a rich, malty flavor that goes down easy and finishes a bit hoppy and warm. This is a damn good brew that drinks well. It has a breadlike/toasted character that is quite outstanding. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good barley wine. I love the taste of this one; an easy drinker for a big beer."
"Either way, another brew from CC worth trying...for me, there are many others in the style I prefer."
"Wine pours a dark caramel with a slight quick to hide head or pure white. not much going on in the nose of this one, just a tad of roasty malt. This is a rather dissapointing barley wine I had high expectations for. A roasty caramel flavor is what you get at the beginning and there is not much to say for the mid palate and aftertaste. Not very complex at all. Very generous hops. Overall an average brew."
"I've enjoyed the Heavy Seas line, but this was a disappointment overall. Not a terrible beer, but one that does not come together. It's just too small, barleywines should be big. Try the other Heavy Seas beers, but look elsewhere for a barleywine."
"For 11%, and as an english barleywine, it is very drinkable and not too heavy. Overall a little light in flavor, but for a reasonably priced domestic BW, its a nice beer to pick up."
"12 ounce bottle."
"Overall the beer is okay and I am impressed with how well hidden the 11% abv is. But it is not very deep in flavor or nose. It is fairly easy to drink if you just wanted to get drukn on 2-3 bottles."
"All in all a drinkable barleywine but nothing that'll leave a lasting impression. It does leave you wanting 'more' of something: malt or hops would have been good choices."
"Unfortunately, that's about as excited as I can get over this beer, which provides easy, simple malt character in the nose and on the palate, but not much else. This clear amber-colored BW drinks suspiciously easy for the ABV, but in the final analysis I felt that it simply did not have enough flavor for my tastebuds to explore."
"Drinkability and Overall: I love barleywines. I love Clipper City (mostly). This one just didn't work out. Next..."
"I hate to join the haters but I didn't care for this one either appears caramel amber ruby hued with an off white cream head leaves ample lacing. Aroma has a deep pine cone scented hops touch of alcohol with some fruity highlights touch of caramel malts it tickles my nose hairs. Taste, I think thiis is where the tide turns flavor is discombobulated noncohesive throws me piney hops, tart fruit lighter malt body slight acidity just doesn't combine well alcohol is well hidden just stay away from big beers they proved that with the Peg Leg, to be fair I liked the Uber Pils, both DIPAs, and the Saison. Mouthfeel is medium bodied fuller carbonation lacks smooth texture. Drinkability, this just isn't the barleywine I'm looking for let's just move on and grab an Ol' Ho."
"Pours out a murky dark red with a quick to fade white head. Little lace or foam left on the glass. Very light fruit notes with some malt sweetness in the nose. Some light medicinal alcohol notes. Light sweet malt flavors with more medicine like notes popping up. Some light fruit and dirty earthy notes are about all else that stick out. Body was sufficient and nothing special. Drinkability wasn¬ít bad as in it went down easy enough. The lack of any real flavor and aroma depth will keep me away from my other bottles for awhile in hopes of something happening with them. Not a bad beer but about as average as it gets."
"It's been a good year for the Heavy Seas line -- first a very good imperial pilsner, and then two nice ipa's. Their Peg Leg imperial stout, although tasy, is not quite up to the style. Had it been labeled an imperial brown ale I think it would have been very well received. Which brings us to Below Decks, which is getting only fair to poor reviews. I can't quite understand why -- this is a very pleasing dark brew with very nice vanilla carmel notes and is amazing drinkable for 11% abv. (It's also a good deal -- I paid $7.50 for a 4 pack). Perhaps it should have been labeled a strong dark ale rather than a barleywine. Regardless, Below Decks is quite delicious."
"Not much to say. Light aroma, flavor, and body. High carbonation. Would never guess it is a Barleywine. It is very easy to drink and the ABV is barely noticeable. Just don¬ít expect anything aggressive, which is one reason to drink a barleywine."
"One year of aging didn't really help this beer. I preferred it fresh."
"Beer is good. Happy small barelywine beering."
"Overall, a dissappointing barleywine."
"Plain and simple...this is not a pleasant tasting barleywine. The flavors are bland and reminiscent of chemicals. One to avoid and made to walk the plank."
"A clean brown beer with amber highlights. Has a good creamy off white head. Very light aroma, some malt sweetness, hop bitterness and a disturbing corn note in the background. No real distinct flavors. Again some malt sweetness, a light hop bite on the finish, that nagging little corn note in the back and the alcohol burn. Maybe it will blossom next year but it doesn't have alot to work with."
"Amber, with golden highlights, but minimal head and carbonation. Hoppy and vineous to the nose, alchohol takes the drivers seat on the tastebuds. A bit bland overall, no real flavor, unfortunatly. Fairly easy to drink, apart from the lack of taste. A bit light and thin."
"I'm gonna lay a bottle or two done for a few months to see if age improves the character of this barleywine. I will re-review the beer then."
"Drinkability - a very drinkable beer, but not going to be my first choice in barleywines. Two would fill you up (not to mention put you under the table)."
"12 oz bottle, poured into a snifter, this is a very dark clear amber with a surprisingly thick finger of head, decent retention, and some pretty nice lacing. Nose is very muted, a slightly sweet malt, some spicey hops, a hint of alcohol. Taste is a light fruity malt, tropical and citrus fruits, slowly giving way to a nice piney hops presense leaving a nice bitter aftertaste awash slightly with alcohol. Mouthfeel is medium with a fairly smooth slick taste. Alcohol stays fairly well hidden, never more than just a hint in the finish. I find most Barleywines to be unbalanced--American ones are great hopmonsters while English ones tend to be very sweet to the point of cloying. This is a very well-balanced alternative, maybe lacking in some of the intensity of flavor a lot of Barleywines have, but a pretty good attempt from Clipper City at the style."
"I tried it both cold and at near room temperature. The warmer sample had a much spicier and complex flavor. (forgive me I am still learning to match words with what I taste) But both were very smooth and drinkable. You don't realize the amount of alcohol that is there. I haven't tried it out of the bottle yet but was overall very happy with it."
"Smooth, yet average, mouthfeel. Goes down quickly and easily. The high ABV is extremely well hidden--there wasn't any overtly boozy flavor or any mouth warming properties. The run of the mill, balanced flavor is spot on for an English Barleywine and reminds me of several I had while in England. Since it isn't the boozy hopmonster that American Barleywines are, I found it to be highly drinkable. Drank two before dinner just last night. Some interesting things may come about as it ages too."
"I guess its a good thing that this beer only comes in a 4 pack. I cant imagine anyone would want more than that."
"The apperance is pretty nice a solid depp amber with a whitish head but no lacing and the head leaves the party very fast. The smell is muted, there is a presence of piney hops and alcohol and some maltyness, but everything is dulled. A confused brew, the alcohol shines through and the hops give a decent bite but the malt seems too lax and isn't up to the challenge of containing the alcohol. The body is almost no-exsistant, too watery for style and really hurt the flavor. Best to see if this improves any, I will see another bottle in a few months."
"High ABV and the average flavor will help limit me at one. Just an average barleywine at this point. We'll see how it ages and my opinion may change."
"This beer poured a clear medium amber color with little carbonation present. It formed an off white foamy head that left circular lace as it subsided. An aroma of malts, hops, caramel and slightly burnt butterscotch aspect to it. The flavor was of malt, hops, wood(?pine) with a touch of caramel. The body was a bit thinner than usual for style and the finish had a stlight astrigent, yet burnt aspect to it. As with all barleywines, this one may just be young and improve with age. Will try a bottle later in the season and see if it improves."
