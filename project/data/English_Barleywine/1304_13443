The first thought that comes to mind is a fresh opened box of cheese-it crackers.  I know this sounds off putting but it is very inviting and really makes you anticipate the first sip.  The flavor is big and bold with tons of cracker like toasted grain tones.  The hops that are usually so prevalent in a Barley wine ale play only as a balancer here.  Rich and spicy on the palate and it reminds me a bit of a old ale.  I had this beer on my wants list for a long time.

4.42,6.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"22 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 12/17/2012. Pours hazy nearly opaque dark reddish brown color with a 1 finger fairly dense tan head with decent retention, that reduces to a ring of lace that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of huge raisin, prune, fig, pear, apple, caramel, molasses, toffee, toast, brown bread, light chocolate, tobacco, leather, herbal, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Incredible aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/bready malt and fruity yeast ester notes; with great strength. Taste of big raisin, prune, fig, pear, apple, caramel, molasses, toffee, toast, brown bread, light chocolate, tobacco, leather, herbal, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of raisin, prune, fig, pear, apple, caramel, molasses, toast, toffee, brown bread, light chocolate, tobacco, leather, herbal, light pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity of dark/bready malt and fruity/earthy yeast ester flavors; with an awesome malt/yeast balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and very full bodied; with a very creamy, slick, and lightly syrupy mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming present after the finish. Overall this is an insane English Barleywine. All around incredible complexity and balance of dark/bready malt and fruity yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. An extremely amazing offering.","superspak","Feb 02, 2014"

The high ABV makes it a bit hot. A satisfactory Engilsh barleywine, but the lack of carbonation detracts from the drinking experience.

Maybe it is deteriorating as well... Unfortunately, I am going to compare this and all Barleywines going forward to the Arctic Devil that I had a couple weeks back.

4.37,5.3,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"I'm a sucker for a great English barleywine and that's exactly what this is. The sweetness is dominant but with a hop profile that makes things more complex and a completely massive mouthfeel. A fantastic dessert beer.","gford217","Jun 15, 2009"

4.32,4.1,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This was a 2006 bottle from my cellar. Pours a cloudy reddish brown with a medium head. The beer smells like Thomas Hardy with all the old fruit and burnt sugar. This is a splendid barley wine with all the big evolved mouthfeel ( 2-3 years in the cellar seem to transform the beer from young hoppy and sweetish to dry and rounded.) As with all Pelican beers this is very drinkable and balanced to a T.","canucklehead","Nov 07, 2008"
4,-3.6,4,4,4,4,4,"2006 Vintage. Pours a slightly ruddy brown, some haziness and a decent sized butterscotch yellow head that slowly recedes. Aroma is a nice sweet caramel maltiness, some fruit sweetness, strawberry, malted milk, bread and raisins. Taste follows with more sweet maltiness and dark and ripe fruit, raisins, prunes, dates, dried strawberries like a fruit roll-up, a hint of citrus hoppiness blends with the malty sweetness. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy, creamy and chewy maltiness, hint of pepperiness, some warmth and a small bite from the alcohol which is otherwise very well hidden. Delicious barleywine, drinking good at this age, would love to try a fresh version sometime, but this beer seems though it could easily go longer. Thank you Paul for the opportunity.","hoppymeal","Nov 06, 2008"

The smell is sour and barleywine. The taste is considerably on the sour side, it is intentional. Primarily it tastes like an average barleywine.Somewhat disapointing for a barleywine with some ageing. Mt. Hood hops. 31 IBU.","Sammy","Jun 12, 2008"
4.15,0,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"d: This was very close to being an outstanding barleywine. Without that lingering charred flavor, this would have been world class. As it was though, I did enjoy it quite a bit.","DIM","Apr 27, 2008"
4.16,0.2,3,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,"2006 vintage bought from John' Grocery in Portland a while ago. Doesn't look like much- pours`a hazy dark brown with little head. . From there it gets much better. Lovely aromas of caramel toffee, spice, sassafras, some roastiness and sweet. Nice. The taste has similar components, but there is also quite a bit of herbal tang, more spice, and a good deal of sweet malt, but all with a very bitter citrus and pine hop finish. All big flavors, but they balance each other rather than conflict. The mouthfeel is a bit sharp and full. Huge and spicy and very high alcohol make this one a sipper.","Georgiabeer","Jan 01, 2008"
4.36,5.1,5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"12/28/09 edit. Stopped by again today, and was able to taste the 2004 through 2009 side by side, along with the 2009 perfect storm. While all were excellent (and once again, the 2005 was the standout), all of these beers were quite different as well. So I think it's kind of sad that this beer is not entered into the data base by vintage, as each vintage was noticeably different. In any event, regardless of the vintage, winterstorm is an excellent beer, one worth sampling and enjoying. The winter storm flight, at $10 for 5 beers, was an especially good value IMHO (not exactly something Pelican Brewing is known for). Definitely try the flight if you happen to have the chance.","John_M","Dec 29, 2007"
4.22,1.7,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Drinkability is very good. It's not an overwhelming powerhouse of flavor. But the subtle warm flavors make this a very nice Barleywine to sip. This tastes more like a English Barleywine to me.","flexabull","Nov 04, 2007"
4.67,12.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,4.5,"WOW!, caught me a little offguard there on my first sip thinking it was just another winter type ale that turned into a barleywine ale. This 2006 bottle pours a cloudy dark brown that you can tell has some viscosity to it that carries a thin head. Smell is rich in malt, honey liqueur, dark fruits and alchohol. Taste is what is expected from a barleywine big and bold with a good alchohol bite, with a thick and rich mouthfeel. Now that my palate is in tune to what I am really tasting and letting it warm a bit, I can get the true style of this beer and really appreciate it's warming effect.","Bookseeb","Nov 02, 2007"
4.47,7.7,4.5,5,4.5,4,4,"On par with most of the Pelican beers I've tried (most of them on tap at the brewpub), and that means it's a superb bit of craftsmanship. It's survived a year in the bottle quite well. Could use even more aging, no doubt. So I'm sipping this on a brisk, sunny, beautiful autumn afternoon, with nothing but fall's colors around...and I'm wishing I were standing on the beach in a mighty wind watching a storm off the pacific coast in Pacific City. It happens. Wish I could find this beer without travelling cross-country to get it.","Metalmonk","Beers"
4.2,1.2,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Vintage 2006, poured from the bomber into two pint glasses. Dark, ruby red in color with muted carbonation and lace. The aroma is a pleasant blend of caramel, malt, molasses, cherry, and hops. The tasteÂ…. is huge. This stuff could probably sit another six months, or a year, or more. Flavors follow the aroma perfectly, except for a substantial, but reasonable, alcohol bite on the end. Very, very tasty. Mouthfeel is fairly full, and would likely soften and get even fuller with time. One of the best American barley wines IÂ’ve had.","grumpy","0"
4.45,7.2,4,4,4.5,4.5,5,"Pours a very dark burgundy/mahogany color with an adequate roasted marshmallow head that recedes steadily while leaving zero lacing. And yes, this glass is beer clean. The yulesmith I just drank out of one of it's kin left a nice thick layer. Anyway, the aroma is malty. Kinda bready and nutty at the same time. The taste reveals more depth. I get hints of caramel, alcohol, butterscotch, various nuts, fig and other flavors I'm unable to identify. Upon warming, the alcohol really comes out. First sip was at proper serving temp, but the alcohol was almost non-existent. I wondered if this was really as big as advertised. But now I know. It definitely is. I initially criticized the mouthfeel for a lack of carbonation, but soon became aware of the thick syrupy body that I love so much with these huge barley wines. This is well-crafted and all the components seem to be enjoying a nice harmony. I can't knock it. It got better with each sip until I realized I now need to go purchase a few more before the shelf is empty. Considering its strength, this brew is off the charts as far as drinkability is concerned. This beer should be spectacular for years.","jakon","Jun 18, 2007"

3.35,-19.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3,"Sampled at the 2003 Holiday Ale Festival, Portland, OR. A dark reddish cider color, hardly-there head. Lots of malts but hops are there from the beginning. Supposedly this beer employed 2 kinds of unusual hopping techniques: mash hopping and first wort hopping. This creates a subtle yet indelible hop flavor that is there from the very beginning. Some smokiness, and a smooth non-carbonated mouthfeel. This beer is pretty good but in the end it's a bit flat and cloying.","Thrasher","Beers"
