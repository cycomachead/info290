"Overall, this barleywine is dark smokey treat. Definitely an English version."

"Bottle. This was several years old when I tried it. Poured a ruddy, dark brown with a minimal head. It has clearly oxidized; raisins are huge in the nose. Brown sugar sweetness. The flavor has eaten the alcohol effectively. Just a soft rap of booze. The flavor is very raisiny. Dark fruits and brown sugar. A slight fruity tartness. Body is surprisingly light. Carbonation has clearly fallen off a bit but the softness works here. Pretty cool, after I'd say over five years of age."
""
"OVERALL: This might better be described as an American strong ale, as the chocolate and leather qualities aren't really appropriate to the barleywine style. Either way, whatever you want to call it, this is top notch stuff. At this point in its expired life, it’s very flavorful, well integrated, smooth, complex and enjoyable. The bomber emptied far too quickly. Well balanced between sweet caramel flavors and dark malt character, making this one to pick apart and savor. Glad I got to drink this at this point in its life. Really enjoyed it."

"OKay, this disappointed me. Not that it was bad, no sir, still on my 10 ten Barley's, but I did not find the smoothness in flavor or ""texture"" I would have expected. Bit harsh - would have better labeled it an aged IPA. I still like it and would recommend it to any strong IPA lover. Just needed to explain by bias and view point. Great beer/ale, just missed my expectations."

"Carbonation's a bit high, but it slows down. Unfortunately, it can only do that by flattening out a little on the end. It's crisp until then, and it's got some smoothness to the medium body."
"The taste has an array of sweet malts, raisins, brown sugar, dark fruit, and quite subtle hops. This beer definitely got better with age and I am glad I had the patience to wait."
""
""
"Overall, nice brew that was enjoyable, but confusing. This beer drank almost like a black and tan of imperial stout and barleywine. This needs to be reclassified as an American Strong Ale."
""
"Overall, this is not what I expected. I'll start brinking more barleywines of the English style rather than the American style if they're all like this. Tastes great, goes down easy, hidden alcohol content. Not much to improve upon."
""
""
"Taste is lots of fruit and a smooth cache of unsweetened chocolate and brown bread maltiness. Im somewhat impressed with this - I like the varied take on the style, it is something like a quad meets barleywine. Hides the ABV well and really is pretty smooth. I could stand to grab another 1 or 2 of these...seems like it would age fairly well for a year or so."

"Cask pour in a shaker pint, the beer is a hazy, yellow-brown coloring witth a chunky, frothy, white coating of head. Aromas of biscuit, lemony sweet, rich toffee, and a wet, cedar hops presence. Smells balanced and tasty. Flavors are smooth, with a toffee and apple sweetness quickly cleaned by a bitter, dry ribbon of hops. Slight smoking and oaky character, too. Very dynamic, with a bitter, resiny aftertaste. Clean, smooth finish of a very robust bodied brew. Tasty, and surprisingly drinkable."
""
"O - A good English barley wine!"
"O - Very dry. I must admit i am fairly new to the barely wine game. Maybe this is exactly how an 'English' barley wine should taste. I was expecting something much sweeter."

"A decent English barley wine. Wouldn't have minded a bit more hops, but the bitterness does seem to work alright with unsweetened chocolate and ashy notes. Malt has a bit of char and roasty character and is a bit aggressive at time with the fruitiness trying to offer balance. Has some issues but a respectable beer."
"A decent beer, brought in to the LCBO for a decent price of $8. Not what I expect from an English barleywine, very bitter finish, dark bodied, chocolate malts. Let’s see how my aged bottle from Maine holds up over the years.Above average carbonation. Good ingredients, but Not as drinkable as it could be."
""
"M - Medium body. Creamy. Light carbonation."
""
"A barleywine that lacks the concentration and complexity of the style is simply not worth drinking. There's nothing inherently unpleasant about Shipyard Barley Wine, but the problem is that there's virtually nothing to it at all. It's far from a fine effort and given the other beers in the Pugsley's Signature Series, we know this brewery is capable of much better."
""

""

"O - It's an okay beer. Nothing to brag about with the muddled flavors that seem to be all over the place."
"O - a great tasting brew, although i would like to see them raise the bar on the alcohol for this style just a bit, the result is a ridiculously drinkable barley wine that i would definitely like to try again"
"O - A complex brew with loads of flavour and a nice cocoa malt undertone that complements the style nicely. One of my favourites from this brewer to date and a worthy ale indeed."
"Deep brown-near black colour with some ruby in there as well, one finer of tan head, some lace as well. Smell is big and malty, some caramel and toffee, a bit of hop, chocolatey, dark fruit and bread as well. Taste follows the nose with big malt on the palate, dark fruits, fairly substantial bitterness mid palate, caramel and chocolate, toffee, finishes a little smokey as well. Light-medium carbonation, med-full body with a bit of a thicker feel. This would be a good intro to Barleywine, not as rich and flavourfull as some but still decent and pretty drinkable with just a hint of the ABV present."
""
"Light to medium body, good carbonation, sticky on the lips."
"Dark brown with chestnut highlights. Mocha brown head, good density with solid lace/retention. Nose has a bit of chocolate, caramel and dark malts as well. A bit bready. Taste of dark toffee malts, dark fruits, light bitterness and a bit more chocolate and toasted malt character. Earthy with warmth. Light metallic at first, but this fades. Sweet but mildly drying finish. Full body, and alcohol comes across stronger than it should. Not bad, but not really that good either."
""
"Interesting take on the style."
"Overall, fairly good. I doubt I would look to have it again, but a pretty decent beer."

"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, strong kick, decent representation of style, it’s a solid beer but there are better choices within the style."
"overall - good, sort of a cross between an American and English style barleywine."
""
"as authentic a barleywine as you can find in the states these days. english in origin and true to character. pours darker than expected, quad colored, with a quarter inch light brown head. smell is bourbon barrel and vanilla, with some chocolate malt and booze poking through. flavor is amazingly complex on the malty front, with caramunich and chocolate malts putting the final one, two combo on you. booze creeps in slowly as it warms, tons of wood and dark red dried fruits to this as well. mouthfeel works, less carbonated than a normal brew, but more carbonated than a lot of american barleywines, tons of heavy malts in the body too. a great bomber if you are only having one. this is a true to its heritage barleywine, worthy of any fine cuisine."
"O: not bad, there seemed to be a lot of different flavors going on. I liked this and am pretty sure I'd have this again."
""
""
""
"O: Not bad, but the acrid bitterness in the taste obscures and distracts from the malt profile."
""
""
"Review from 4/2011 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a very dark red brown amber. Two finger head and lots of lacing. Aroma of malt and roasted malt; faint dark fruits. Taste is dominated by malt. Slight dark fruits and roasted malt, hint of sweet caramel. Dry moderate hop finish, pleasant. Medium bodied. Not a typical barley wine, but interesting and nice to drink. Worth trying again."
""
""
""
"Very dark. Not much of a head. Slight metallic aroma, little fruity and some toffee-coffee scents in there. Not a great flavor here. Drinkable, but somewhat disappointing. Nah, now that I take another sip, it's really not for me. Bitterness is vegetal, very little sweetness to balance it. Too thin for the style. This was a drain pour. I have limited experience with this style, but it isn't in the same class as Young's Old Nick. I'll cleanse with an Arrogant Bastard. I'll be fine, if a wee sad."
""
"D - Pretty easy to drink. Not really challenging and the ABV is pretty well hidden."
"This barley wine is better with a meal. I consumed it from a Dogfish Head snifter after cellaring for about one year."
""
""
"While the beer was a perfectly fine purchase from Happy Harry's in Grand Forks, the meld of the flavors doesn't blend well. Not unhappy with the beer, but won't be trying another one."
"This is a medium-bodied Barleywine with just a bit of oily slickness to the mouthfeel. It tastes a little stronger than the 8.5% ABV listed. Maybe it will keep folks (me) from pounding it down like a fool."
""
""
""
"O: The variety of the six different malts used to make this beer add some complexity to the taste and makes this a little more interesting to drink compared to others in the style."
""
""
""
"Still glad I tried it."
"The dark, nearly roasted malts in Shipyard’s barleywine make it an interesting offshoot. At a year old, it’s developing interesting complexity. I might grab an extra bottle or two just to see what it does in another year."
"Over all not to bad, but not that great. I'd try it if I saw it on tap but won't be seeking out another bottle."
"Pours a clear super dark brown with a 2 inch foamy khaki head that fades to a small cap. Thin rings of foamy lace cling to the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, nuts, brown sugar, toffee, and caramel. There is a fruity smell that I am getting as well. Taste is of toasted malt, roasted nuts, coffee beans, and some burnt sugar flavors. I am also getting some cocoa powder as the beer warms. A medium roasty bitterness lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a nice level of carbonation with a crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a great barleywine that is much darker and more roasty than I was expecting."
"Ya know, this is a better barleywine than the scores lead on. Maybe one day I'll try it fresh and enjoy the hoppiness the label proclaims."
"Overall: I enjoyed this one and kind of wish I had picked up one while I was in New Hampshire, I guess I'll have to next time I'm up there."
"O: Not bad. This one doesn't break my list of favorite barleywines, but it's a fine ale."
"Glad to have a couple more aging in cellar, enjoy!"
"Drinkability: I was surprised by this on the whole, because to me it's more of a hybrid style -- I would've guessed, from all the English versions, that this is pretty much distinctively an American version. Complex, not insanely alcoholic, and worth your time sipping. Nice job, Pugsley."
"I held onto this one since last year, bought as a Signature Series pack.  This blurs the line for me for what a barleywine should be, but it was so damn good.  I was pleasantly surprised, I'll be buying this again for sure."
"Drinkability - excellent brew for fireside. No English butteriness that I was wondering about, just great flavors from the malt and hops."
"The pour was decent, though a bit lifeless for me. Rich amber color, almost copper in hue with a nice touch of cloudiness to it that really gave it a very thick look, nearly opaque at times. No real head though, and it almost looked flat at first pour, not really encouraged right off the bat. The aroma was rich and sweet. Nice notes of bready malts, hints of almost honey like notes and a nice fruit touch toward the finish. The flavor though really perked me up a bit. Sweet, mellow, with all notes of ABV long gone by the wayside. Lots of biscuit like notes, a touch of faded hops and a load of grain all combined to really give quite a nice show overall. Very impressed here with the way it tasted, especially in the finish, which was again very sweet, and nearly perfectly placed. An easy sipper I almost went through this one too quickly as it had mellowed to the point of being equally rich and subtle."
"M,O: Drinkable for the style, nice start but the overall appeal for me is lost towards the end of the drink. There is a sharpness that takes away from the feel of this beer. A fair offering for the style."
"Edit: As an earlier review notes, let this beer warm a bit before reviewing - it changes greatly."
"D - Drinks great for a night/dessert beer, very unique flavor and different for the average barleywines out there. Over all I enjoy it, but not my favorite."
"Future outlook: Nah. Even if it were available here, no need to have again."
"Notes: Interesting barelywine. Plenty of dark malt that overshadows the hops. Some citrus and tea hop flavors come out but it is definitely a malt forward barleywine. Not horrible, but nothing I would be really excited about drinking. Maybe a hoppy porter? Worth a try if you can get a good price."
"The hops kinda threw me off. Moderately hopped for an English Barleywine. I didn't mind too much though. Drinks good. I would buy this again if it was cheaper."
"Dark, coffee-brown with a dense sand colored head that leaves fine lace on the glass. Chocolate and dark fruit in the aroma. Chocolate covered cherry and deep roasty malt flavors with a mild herbal hop flavor in the finish. Shipyard BSA tastes and feels like a hybrid Barley Wine/Stout to me and is not what I expected but is not bad at all..it just doesn't seem to fit the given style. An easy drinker at 8+ ABV, the alcohol is barely detectable. Good beer but a bit overpriced."
"Picked this one up at a tobacco shop, on the outskirts of Old Town, in San Diego. Poured a robust reddish-brown color, with a good tan head. Aromas of chocolate, caramel, dried fruit and light brown sugar. Medium bodied, flavors of caramel, dried fruit, leather and light hops. Nothing special, but drinkable."
"Enjoyed it nonetheless. For the most part the beers in the Shipyard Signature Series are a good value."
"This is not a barley wine....more like a crossover barely wine/stout or something...akin to the GM Aztek car/minivan/whatever monstrosity...even the 8.5ABV indicates something may be amiss. Whatever this is....I wish they would call it something other than barely wine."
"Overall, this was a little bland, but not bad. At $10/22oz., I wouldn't purchase it again."
"Deep brown/amber body with a huge offwhite foamy head. Big boozy aroma. Reminds me of almost a blended scotch whiskey. Burns the nosehairs even though this one is just 8.5% abv. Slightly burnt malt/caramel aroma too. Big caramel/toffee malts dominate the palate. Very grainy, sweet, and sticky. Booze is actually well hidden (despite the nose). Slight yeasty spiciness as well. Chewy, creamy body with moderate carbonation. Not the best barleywine I've ever had, but still solid."
"While the aroma is quite interesting and enjoyable to explore, the flavor of this is just not very appealing. I wonder if a lot more age will turn this into a really funky old ale? The carbonation is already getting a bit excessive though and I would worry about the integrity of the bottle after a few more years of age."
"Body is mild compared to the strong flavor profile. Still goes down smooth, but leaves an acidic/charcoal after taste. I don't mind that at all."
"It looks like Imperial Porter is the best of the four Pugsley's Signature Series beers. XXXX IPA, Smashed Pumpkin, and now Barley Wine Style Ale are merely better than average. Given the $10 price tag... not recommended unless you're a big fan of the style or the brewery."
"Drinks easy once a bit of up front astringency passes. Stays true to the style, maybe the best beer from these guys I've had..."
"This beer poured well into sifter. There was a lot of head and lace. The body was deep amber with a reddish hue. The aroma and the flavor were both rich. It was not as hopped as most barley wines which I appreciated. There was a warm like chocolate alcohol presents in the flavor. This is a sweet after dinner or late evening beer. There is a very heavy mouthfeel."
"D - God taste and feel, I could probably drink this for a while. HOwever this would not fall under the old standy beer category."
"by the way, i've never had a barleywine form a bottle with a screwcap"
"Respect to Shipyard for sticking to their guns, in their true manner of sticking with English styles and not jumping on the Extreme Beer wagon. A job well done with a less respected and underrated beer style."
"Overall, I really severly underwhelmed by this beer. It was one note and overly burnt, not to mention it missed out on all the complexity and great flavors that go along with this style. I thought this was closer to a porter with a decent hop note than a barleywine. Not my cup of tea."
"Overall great barleywine that is not too sickly sweet like some other ones are. This is a job well done and definitely recommend for others to try."
"Glad to see Shipyard putting some of their bigger brews on the shelves here in Oklahoma. Give us more!"
"drinkability is nice. pretty good balance. a nice english bw."
"The mouthfeel is above medium bodied but probably on the lighter side for the style. Carbonation is a bit high for my tastes in barleywines as well. Drinkability isn't bad, it had some nice flavors to it overall and was nice to sip on this evening. Decent beer overall."
"d: Decidedly different and significantly underrated. I thoroughly enjoyed this offering."
"All in all, the brewery messed up. This is not by any means a barley wine. This is a stout or a porter stretch, but not a barley wine. I rated this as a barley wine because that is what it is labeled to be. As far as barley wines go, this is not good. Avoid!"
"Big thanks goes out to jerz on this one."
"Drinkability: A crescendo of flavor, complex and sippable reminiscent of a good whiskey"
"Taste is sweet, boozy, and sharp carbonation, the body is very light and sweet. Drinkability is very harsh and quite tame."
"Shipyard Barley Wine is a dark ruby ale with a brown sugar colored head that has excellent retention and lacing. It has a very wooden aroma. It smells resiny and smokey with some sweetness and warmth. It's full bodied and smooth with a chewy finish. It tastes very smokey and resiny with lots of roastiness. It has a whiskey barrel quality. It's mature with some nice complexity. It's a nice late night sipper."
"Drink: I won't pick one up again but it certainly wasn't a drainpour."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, a bit light for the style, with low carbonation. Pretty drinkable stuff, and the ABV is well hidden, but its just a little too light for the style for me. Thanks Eric!"
"Out of a bomber bottle this beer was a nearly opaque brown color with a thin head of tan bubbles that quickly became an even thinner skim. It looked like a porter! The retention was unimpressive and the lacing was spotty. The aroma was malty, alcoholic and dry with hints of wood, similar to a barrel-aged whiskey in ways The flavors were bold and similar to the aroma though with better complexity. Right from the start I could taste the 8.% ALC, but as this faded off my tongue I got the dark bready malts elements then the bittering hops followed by a long chocolate malt finish that lingered forever. A jolt at first, but I grew fonder of it as I imbibed. As it warmed I smelled more caramel malt and tasted more of it too. The flavors were very roasty and not really what I think of when I think barley wine. I did enjoy the coffee and slightly spicy notes though. The mouthfeel was smooth, the body full and the carbonation appropriate. An odd version of a barley wine but still an enjoyable one."
"Good drinkability but also kind of boring. A nice mild flavored beer but it could be more exciting."
"Cheers Eric!"
"This is a very good barly-wine, if not too traditional. It tastes a lot like a porter with the addition of the chocolate malt. Goes down very smoothly and even on this hot summer day, is very refreshing for the style. The alcohol is subdued, which is a welcome attribute as barley wines tend to be a bit too heavy on the alcohol. I realize that high APV% is indicative to this style of beer, but I think too many go a bit too far with it at the expense of drinkability. I appreciate beers like Dogfishhead's Olde School with it's 15% APV, but this is a barley-wine that can be appreciated in the warm weather as well as in winter. By far the best beer I've had yet from Shipyard."
"Drinkability is pretty good, more in what I would I would call an old ale due to the darker malts. Not worth going to far out of your way for, but certainly worth trying if you get a chance. Probably could have used more cellar time to tame the bite."
"Overall, very good! i really like it. I would love another. I highly recommend it. great beer and the cellar aging I am sure helped the smoothness of the beer."
"F: Lingering syrupy sweetness, some bitterness lingers with some fruit. A little smoke comes out on the finish as well. Pretty chewy finish too, and sticks to the mouth."
"This was nice a good beer to have on occasion not my favorite BW but an enjoyable one."
"Clearly not the biggest barleywine at 8.5%, this is on the more subdued end of the barleywine spectrum, and a decent try at the style. Has some redeeming qualities, and for $5.99 a bomber, it's not a bad deal. But probably not one I'll remember with extraordinary fondness."
"The mouthfeel is thinner then expected, still has some oily viscosity to it, similar to a Quad, but doesn't have that sweet sticky syrupy mouthfeel i normally associate with BWs. very smooth with a somewhat dry finish, which makes this one quite an easy bomber to finish,and the respectively lower alcohol percentage doesn't hurt the drinkability either."
"Decent barleywine, nothing overly special, but a solid american version of an american barleywine."
"Drinkability: Overall, a very nice effort that brings nice complexity to the style"
"A well rounded, flavorful and balanced beer with just enough heft to take the chill off."
"D- bleh. Just wasn't impressed very much by this one."
"Roasty aftertaste medium heavy body. Very nice Shipyard does well with there pugsley series. Will drink this again!"
"D - Not the most drinkable beer on earth. Bitterness beats me over the head one too many times. The ABV will sneak up on you - obviously not a session beer. A bit filling."
"3/3/3.5/4/3.5"
"Drinkability is not so great. Barleywines are usually a sipper, but for a bomber of this, I was wishing it didnt have so much ash flavor in it to make it more drinkable."
"The carbonation is good but its a little too thin. The alcohol is well hidden and this one finishes nice and clean that keeps the sips in quick succession."
"D - Good. This beer will taste much better in one year from now."
"22 oz. Nice, rather dark brown, cloudy pour. Just a little off white head that recedes to a ring. Subtle malt, molasses, toffee aromas. Taste has the malt and toffee, but a very prevelent bitter note. A little ashy, sourness. Finishes with this bitter fruit or bitter nut note. The malt, sweet and fruit tones are quite subdued, almost watered down. Alcohol is not strong, drinkability would be quite high if not for the bitter tinge. Lighter bodied than standard. OK, but just not that meal I expect an English barleywine to be. The sour/smoke is a bit of a turn off as well."
"Even mouthfeel, a bit slick, but finishes tingly. Decent beer, worth trying, but perhaps not earthshaking."
"I love barleywine, and I'll come back to this one, but it didn't fulfill my nostalgic desire for a true English barleywine."
"I'm looking forward to finishing the rest of this bomber with my pepperoni pizza. If I ever see this beer again, I will gladly snap up a pint or bottle!"
"Pours a very nice very deep red color, nice carbonation, nice little creamy tan head, with some nice sticky lacing/oil slicks left behind. The nose is a different one to a English Barleywine, very malty, with some chocolate, roast notes, some hops, slightly fruity (dark). The taste is very nice, malty, with some nice chocolate notes, roasty, slight hoppy, also picking up some figs, raisins, plums. Medium body, slightly dry finish. Drinkable, I really like this one, quite complex."
"Drinkability is good spot on for the style, with extra dose of hops."
"Ruby colour, beige head that leaves lots of lacing on the glass. Aroma is very sweet and malty, but there is also some hops in the nose. It has a funky acidic quality that makes it less pleasurable and there is also dark fruit in there. Flavour is surprisingly watery for a beer with as high ABV like this has. It has a nice bitterness is enjoyable, unfortunately this beer is full of funky chemical notes that makes it less than convincing and it also has the same sour flavour that I found in the aroma. It has some malts in it that makes it acceptable to drink but not more. Mouthfeel is just plain average. This is a bad example of the style, I will avoid it in the future."
"Nice, reddish-black color with small bubbles and creamy, deep tan head. Chocolate and bourbon are very prevalent, with touches of mahogony and earthiness. Has a surprisingly thin body despite the strong flavors and dark color, but there is a lot of alcohol hidden behind it. A slight bitterness, but the ""sour mash"" of the bourbon comes through in the end, reducing the beer's drinkability. The carbonation also doesn't hold very well with the thin body."
"Overall, for the style they were going for they (english barleywine) it's not bad, but it never quite engages you. Dark and mellow, more suitable for a winter warmer that should be a much better price.(Think Avery Old Jubilation)"
"The beer was a dark brown color, and looked clear. I didn't see any yeast or cloudiness, but it was so opaque it was hard to tell. I smelled small malt and fruit. The taste was much hoppier than I like for a barleywine. The hops almost dominated. I could pick up some raisin and fig, but it was mainly hops. The beer had an interesting creamy texture, and there was no alcohol burn."
"Very tasty, but this is just not a barleywine. A strong ale, perhaps. Still, it's the tastiest offering from Shipyard I've ever sipped and I'm not going to penalize it any style points."
"This is awesome. A truly great English Barleywine. There are lots of complexities. Something I highly recommend."
"Taste nearly like a oaked aged porter with smoked malts. Finishes dry and with a slight alcohol bite at the end. Very unique and not similar to any barleywines i've ever had."
"The beer sat deep red in the wine glass, and if the light struck it the right way, looked almost black. The head atop was quite large for the style, looming at nearly three finger thick. The smell was roasty with coffee and dark fruit, which was very nice, had this been a Stout. It was quite odd to smell these aromas in a Barleywine. The taste was a mix of astringent and roasty flavors, followed by a caramel finish which was again way out of place for the style. The beer also lacked much sweetness, which is what I thought English Barleywines were all about. I feel a little bad rating it this low on the taste,, as I liked the flavors. The mouthfeel was thin and displayed none of the velvety characteristics and syrupy viscosity I was expecting. And at only 8.5%, no warmth to speak of either. What were you smoking when you wrote the recipe Mr. Pugsley?"
"Conclusion: This is definitely an end of the night beer...the alcohol gets a little hot after a bit, but this is big, bold, and seductive, as a barleywine should be."
"The flavour it has is pretty good and it is not one-dimensional, but the flaovurs are a bit thin and subdued while the alcoholic heat and bitterness are a bit too strong. It gets smoother but also more bland over time."
"An interesting Barley Wine for sure. Tasted like figs, prunes, and raisins with a nice coffee-flavored kick. Not too alcoholic tasting, but just very odd. A great and enjoyable sipper that gives a fresh take on a style that I am still learning about."
"Bottle: Poured a deep clear burgundy color ale with a large off-white foamy head with good retention and minimal lacing. Aroma of sweet malt with some dry English hops also noticeable. Taste is a mix between some sweet malt with light biscuit notes with some dry English hops. Malts are lacking in complexity with no dry fruit or any other characteristics. Body is a bit light with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol."
"The beer pours a dark brown color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a complex malt aroma that leans more to the roasted/chocolate side. It dry with a light hop aroma. The taste is decent. It has a moderate burnt toffee flavor that goes down easy and finishes dry and warm with a nice hop character. The mouthfeel is decent as well. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a nice barleywine. I love the aroma and it's got pretty nice malt character. The Pugsley series is turning out to be the class of their lineup."
"Drinkability- Ate a full dinner and have quite a buzz after this one measley 8.5% beer. Feels like a 11% one. Feels much more like an american style B'wine than an english. Not bad by any means, just out of style. Still perfectly fine, tasty and quaffable."
"The appearance is a dark redish brown with a nice 2 finger tan head. Leaves a flaky lacing on the glass. The scent is complicated and gets better as it gets warmer. Mostly fruity and not a lot of other wine like characteristics. Other barley wines have been very much like a wine. Didn't enjoy them so much. The flavor is mostly fruit as well, but there is some bitterness that bites the tongue. Its a full body beer that makes for drinking a bomber pretty easy."
"Pours a nice, one finger, light tan head. Pretty deep, red and brown color, more like garnet. Nice lacing for a barelywine.Fruit cake with a good splash of mandarin and blood orange rinds in the aroma. Taste starts with some dark fruits. Plums, maraschino like black cherries, and some apricots. Rum cakey and dry peppermint hop spice. The alcohol is elusive, its there,jus behind the scenes. Helping the other flavors stand out. Good, smooth, dry sipper."
"D- This beer is very smooth to drink but with nice complexity and new layers of flavor as the beer warms. This is a great English style barley wine that is big but shows depth aswell. I don't think I would age this one as it might lose some of its complexity."
"Very drinkable. No boozy aftertaste. This is something I would drink OFTEN."
"Not blown away by any means. Nice barleywne for the $6.99 price I paid."
"Poured dark brown, nearly black, with mahogany edges and a thick tan head. Creamy looking. Thick, sticky lacing. Never seen a barleywine look like this; more like a cream stout or imperial porter. Earthy, wooden malt with a chunk of cocoa powder and hops in the nose. Equally creamy mouthfeel; very unexpected. Roasty malt, again earthy and wooden. The chocolate really comes through as it warms. There is a resiny bite, but it comes off more like part of a barrel-aged character. It was very nice, but the density and heft of the beer made it a bit unwieldly in terms of drinkability. I had wished someone was there to help me finish the bomber."
"Mild carbonation with some fluff to the mouthfeel, a medium dose of alcohol and a medium full body add goodness to the drinkability of this brew. Not a bad English style BW at all...rather authentic and definetely worth a go."
"Comments: I did enjoy the rather fast onset of the beer buzz, but the off flavor was rather irritating, so after the first few pulls, I finished the brew quickly. I must say that the other qualities of the beer do warrant me trying this brew again in case I just got a bad bottle. (it does happen, even with fine brews)."
"Poured a deep brownish red with some tan foam and a nice amount of lace on the side of the glass. The smell was of roasted malts and a hint of coffee. The taste was very bitter for me and a style of a stout. The flavor was better as it got warmer. The taste of bitter hops, roasted malts, coffee and a hint of prune is what I could taste. But, for me, it was to bitter and that is what took away a lot of the different flavors. Wait for it to warm up, the flavor will be more complex."
"A super dark black brown ale with a ring of light tan big bubbles on top. Good lacing follows. The aroma is deep rootbeer evergreen with bountiful molasses malt and fig/raisin. Thick and bountiful. And wow, what flavor. Again a thick melange of coffee malted milk with more dark fruits and a touch of spruce. Just a beautiful mouthful of deep blended grains and figs. This is medium to full bodied with a very smooth but somewhat resinous feel. Carbonation is minor but perfectly adequate for such a flavorful brew. Outstanding stuff that deserves a slow appreciation."
"Not too bad. Surprising amount of leafy hop, balanced with generous malty brown sugar sweetness."
"A pretty decent barelywine, with flavors bold enough that they even cover the flavors of the Ringwood yeast nicely."
"Overall I really like this one, it bridges the divide between English and American barleywines. If I saw this one again I would probably grab one to have and one to lay down."
"Pours a three finger light tan head that leaves a good lace. Almost black color some mahogany highlights. Slight malty nose. Light carbonation and medium-heavy bodied. Flavor is some sweet maltiness but lacks the seriousness of a good barleywine, musty bitterness at finish. There are better barleywines like Southern Tier's Backburner. Pricey for Shipyard, $10.15 for a 22 oz bottle from Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, Me."
"Not a bad brew to drink, but this brew misses the style pretty easily."
"Over all: Though different from others that I've had it is still an enjoyable barleywine. Not too over powering."
"D, notes: A perfectly fine barleywine. I would have liked more character on the malt side of things and actually a little more sweetness."
"Pours flat and black with no head into my Unibroue Trois Pistoles goblet. Grape jelly aroma. Raiseny and port like, too. It's like dark fruit but somehow off. A very strange, bitter taste. Not at all pleasant. I'm wondering if this is a bad beer, yet I press on. Metallic and bitter and a mouthfeel that is simply unpleasant. This beer is a disaster from beginning to end. I have to assume it was spoiled. Down the drain it went. If I ever come accross this brew again, I'll give it another chance if it's free. Otherwise, avoid this mess at all costs."
"Pours on the darker side for a barley wine, a dark, murky mahogoney with a short head to start that fades to nothing. Smells sweet, grainy, roasty and with some piney and earthy hops. There is also a residual yeast smell that smells typically English. A bit roasty for a barley wine, but fine. The taste is less roasty, but quite a bit more hoppy with piney, earthy, and citrusy hops combined with more roastiness, some dark fruit, and quite a bit of lingering bitterness. Smooth, and somewhat thick in the mouth. Thisn wasn't bad, but it didn't really represent the barley wine style that well. I don't mind the extra hops in a barley wine, but I do want some extra sweetness to go with it, and the extra roastiness was a bit out of place. Still, it was enjoyable enough if not remarkable."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 3/4"" tan head over the clear burgundy brown brew. Dense head lasts well, with heavy sticking lace. Aroma is heavy on malt, plenty of dark fruits. Taste is malty sweet upfont, with roastiness appreciated, slightly tart fruitiness in the middle, light bitter close. Mouthfeel is smooth, and drinkability is alright. The parts just don't come together as well as I would like."
"Drinkability: It just never comes together to leave me saying ""man, that was some barleywine!"" I'll politely say it's an acceptable barleywine. Don't wanna start the new week being a Grouch Bug, y'know."
"D - This is a pretty good tasting brew and relatively easy-drinking for a barleywine."
"Taste: hop, malt & fruits all donate subtle flavors in this complex beer. None dominates."
"Drinkability: Drinkable, but the bitterness is a little overbearing. Not quite what I expected."
"Not really a barleywine so that goes against it, but it tastes decent and goes down easy."
"This one, sad to say, isn't for me. It rolls like a strong-ish brown ale but it's not a barleywine to me. Although not entirely unpleasant, not what we're looking for."
"Courtesy of fishingnet, thanks Ben. Pours dark brown with garnet edges and dark tan head. The aroma is roasty malts coupled with mild buttery bread. The taste is full on roasted malts from moderate roast, nutty malts and to highly roasted malts. Behind those notes is a level of buttered bread. Nice English interpretation except possibly missing any form of dark fruitiness. One of the most easily sessionable barleywines I have to date. It seems more like an American Strong Ale."

"D- Overall, this is a pretty solid barleywine that I wouldn't mind having again. Worth a shot."
"I'm not usually a big barley wine fan but this one was good. A nice strong brew, plenty of oomph without being obnoxious."
"This is a creamy beer. It has many of the elements of a superior English Porter. There's a dark chocolate with cherry flavor that has some notes from a barley wine. Still, this is a strong departure from the style. And I like it. I find it very drinkable without too much alcohol."
"Mouthfeel is semi-full and the beer is generally semi-dry. The alcohol definitely emerges and leaves that peppery feel in the late finish. It's okay, but I will never pay that much money for it again."
"Pours a really dark brown with ruby highlights when held to the light. Smallish off white head disappears quickly. Smells of chocolate, butter, caramel, toffee. Taste is chocolaty buttery hoppy. Leaves a bitter/astringent taste in my mouth. Body is medium to thin the beer finishes dry. Mouthfeel is oily, carbonation is light. I tried to enjoy this, but I could not. The color is too dark for the style, the flavor profile is all wrong. The astringent taste ruined this one for me. At 1o bucks a bottle never again!"
"22oz bomber from the local Hannaford. Pours a nearly opaque very dark brown with nearly an inch of light tan head that leaves some impressive lacing. Caramel, toffee, chocolate, butterscotch... Chocolate, coffee, caramel, toffee characterize the flavor. Hints of butter here and there, but diacetyl was impressively subdued. On the upper side of medium-bodied with moderate carbonation. Not bad, a solid example of an English Barleywine for sure, being more of a malt bomb with hops playing second fiddle as it were. Not sure it was worth the price - maybe it was... However this has to be about the best Shipyard I have ever tried. Way to go Shipyard!"
"Poured a deep, deep brown with a reddish tint, light brown head, good carbonation.Nose is umm..off. No real smell to it I thought. Taste was of cocoa powder, roasted malts and a rather obnoxious astringent feel. Mouthfeel is thinner bodied than I wanted. English bwine? I did not see it nor taste it. Alcohol was well hidden but I expected more, heavier, maltier and thicker."
"for more of my reviews, please check out my beer blog at joshsbeerblog.blogspot.com."
" Interesting, fairly complex flavor. Maybe a tad raw at this time."
"The aroma is quite hoppy in a grassy way with caramel malt and somewhat chemical. The appearance is dark amber with a nice foamy head. The taste is like the aroma which means it's not good. It's very bitter, grassy, and chemical. There is a little sweet malt but the taste is just bad. The palate is OK for the style and quite smooth. Overall I really don't like this one."
"Starts out promising but I feel that this falls flat in the drinkability department. It may need some aging but I'm troubled by the alcohol heat that just seems to crowd out other flavors. Average at best."
" My fiance really liked this, but she doesn't care for the ""heavy"" Barleywine's and I do."
"D - slightly distracting with the burnt / roasted notes."
"I bought this and the Imperial Porter at Tully's in Wells for $10.50 each. This was the first one I tried, and thought the beer was pretty good. Served in a snifter, the beer was a dark red/brown color with a medium-sized, quickly dissipating, tan head. The aroma was predominately of dark fruit, with a little malt presence. The taste was cherry and raisin, malt first, then some hops. The label said a dry finish, and I would agree. I thought this was a good example of an English barleywine, and would drink it again."
