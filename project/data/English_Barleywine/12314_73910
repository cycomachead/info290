Very sweet with an almost syrupy characteristic beyond what I would ever want.  Very sad about this as I really like their vanilla porter.  Pours a hazy red-orange.  Smells of bourbon, sweet malts and booze.  Dominant sweet bourbon flavor, caramel, sweet malts.  Sweet heavy body with med/light carbonation.  Not as obnoxiously sweet as it warmed but still too much for me.","GregJ","Dec 19, 2014"

Big toffee, caramel, light coconut, a hint of vanilla, somewhat nutty, figs, raisins, spicy oak, and almonds in the aroma. Taste is big figs, dark fruits, with a touch of spice, hints of cinnamon, and coconut through the middle, with lighter notes of sweet caramel and brown sugar, ending with a light alcoholic bite on the backend. Slick mouthfeel with almost no carbonation throughout. Overall, a very solid barleywine that was not overpowered by the barrel treatment, This was too tough for me to come by to seek this out again.","CuriousMonk","Jul 22, 2013"

Medium thick, chewy body with strong strong carbonation and a hot alcohol finish. Whiskey, vanilla, coconut, dry oak and raisin dominate the flavor. This is a nice take on the style, but the body is a little odd and it is very barrel forward this fresh. Sampling this immediately after King Henry amplified these flaws, but regardless this is well worth trying.","yourefragile","Dec 19, 2011"

Flavor carries a nice bit of bourbon and oak with caramel there as well. Not too many characters but a great combination. Quite well done, but not an amazing bourbon barrel barleywine, though that includes the best of the best.","Thorpe429","Dec 18, 2011"

There is a bit of whiskey and vanilla on the back end. Sweet caramel and brown sugar add to the cloyingness. The flavor is also intensely sweet. Heavy on the brown sugar, caramel, and toffee notes.

Smell is of malt, brown sugar, toffee, fruit, vanilla, toasted coconut, oak, and some subdued whisky aromas. Taste is pretty much spot on with the smell. A slight bitterness accompanies each sip and there is an alcohol warmth in the back of the throat as well. This beer has a low level of carbonation with a slightly flat and smooth mouthfeel.
