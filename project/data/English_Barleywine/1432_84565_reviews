"A well made barleywine that's solid. Not overly complex. A good base beer to throw in barrels and build off of."
""
""
"O: Nice example of an english barleywine. Loads of maltiness, typical caramel, bread and cocoa flavors. Light bits of noble hops I'd say. Well balanced. Smooth and easy drinking."
""
""
""
"Overall:  A very decent barleywine but lacks some depth and complexity"
"This is a fine example of an English barleywine. It is not overtly sweet as some are. I think this would be better with some age."
"Deep brown with ruby edges in the light. Small tan head with rather tight bubbles. Deep, serious malt presence. Toffee and dark fruit, with some faint yeasty esters. Palate of sticky toffee, warming alcohol, strong malt backbone, some spicy hop notes to balance. Def some darker malts in here. So smooth and balanced. Velvet on the tongue. Lingering goodness in the form of sweet, sticky deliciousness. Favorite new Barleywine. Damn J O's!"
"Pours brown/amber with a small  creamy head.  Smells of sweet malt and raisins or prunes.  Tastes of sweet malts, raisins and prunes, lots of different flavors, complex.  Has a syrupy mouthfeel with a nice finish, hops are in the background.  Overall, a very good English style barleywine"

"Burnt brown sugar and toffee here, but not too sweet."

"O- a nice malt bomb, as an English barleywine should be, still drinking a bit hot though"

"Overall, it's a decent beer and a fun try, but like most of my experiences with Jackie O's..the promise isn't quite delivered."
"Brick Kiln is a solid, basic English barleywine. No bells or whistles but it's spot on for the style. I'm relatively certain that this would age quite well. Too bad I only had one..."

"A very standard effort that’s below the grade of the Jackie O’s stuff that I’ve been sampling recently. Bad? Certainly not. Good? Certainly not. Just beer."

"Overall - Really love this brew, fantastic."

"Caramel malt, hint of dark fruits, dry, not sweet at all for an English Barleywine. Kind of a short clean finish with a touch more hop character than I was expecting."
"375 ml bottle into snifter, 2014 vintage bottling. Pours moderately hazy/cloudy nearly opaque dark brown color with a 1 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of big caramel, toffee, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, raisin, plum, fig, cocoa, light coffee, light nuttiness, herbal, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roast/bready malt and fruity/earthy yeast notes; with good strength. Taste of big caramel, toffee, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, raisin, plum, fig, cocoa, light coffee, light nuttiness, herbal, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Fair amount of herbal/roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toffee, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, dark fruit, cocoa, and light coffee/nuttiness on the finish for a while. Very nice complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malts and fruity/earthy yeast flavors; with a nice bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and full bodied; with a very smooth, moderately creamy/slick, and slightly bready/chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent English barelywine style. All around great complexity, balance, and robustness of dark/roast/bready malts and fruity/earthy yeast flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A very enjoyable offering."

"wow. in my limited exposure to this brewery i am very very impressed, and this barleywine is definitely something special. its darker than most, looks like an old ale, richer deep brown complexion and not much head on it. plenty of viscosity to the feel, slippery and thick, with just a prickle of carbonation. flavors range in grain from dark and roasty to sweet and coppery, then tangy even and a hint smoky, which is to say that its very complex at its base. there is a lingering molasses or honey sweetness to this, and a mineral presence unique to the style. definitely not hoppy, so maybe more in the english tradition, although i dont get much yeast character in here either. i love the slick feel, the lack of alcohol presence which is insane for how big this is, and i love that the grain comes in waves, one after the next so its never muddled or messy. impressive take on the style, i like the darker complexion of this, and think it suits the season well. so cool too to see this pouring in colorado. i enjoyed one at jakes brew bar in littleton last night. go drink it up!"

"O: While not an amazing beer it's pretty fair and true to style where this beer shines is the mouthfeel, if you see it on tap treat yourself don't search for it though."

"The Brick Kiln packs a wallop! This beer is big....yet tasty. The beer poured a opaque brown with ecru head that is not leaving a lace. The scent carries a peat caramel type flare. The taste was a nice malt balance that had scotch/peat like base with subtle dark fruit on top. The mouthfeel was full in body with subtle carbonation. Overall this is a decent barley wine and I would recommend it."

"Overall - Tasty, but not very complex and too bitter to be exemplary."

"Ever since Thomas Hardy's bit the dust I have been looking for the next favorite barley wine, and while this is very close to a few aged ones I have had it deserves to be laid down for a few years to mature. An A PLUS!"

"Overall, I'm happy with this complex ale going on here. A really nice barleywine in the heart of Ohio's Appalachia!!!"
""
"The alcohol overpowers the flavor just a bit. It is still outstanding though. It has a real barrel quality though there is no mention of. I think this beer is just a hair away from being a world class barleywine. Very true to the English style, so if you enjoy that, it is worth the price of admission. I would love to have a bourbon barrel version of this."

"375 ml bottle, 2014 vintage. Served in a DFH snifter, the beer pours dark brown with a half inch tan head. Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is nice, the brew smells like caramel, brown sugar, raisins/dark fruit, dark bread and a bit of chocolate. It tastes like caramel, toffee, brown sugar, dark fruit (raisins, cherries), bready malt, and some nuttiness. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's slick and syrupy with moderate carbonation. I think it's a good English Style barleywine, I should have bought some more. Definitely worth trying if you're never had it before. $5.99 a bottle."

"O: Nice barleywine from Jackie O's. The bottle may seem a bit pricy, but if it comes down to about the price of a pint of craft beer at the bar and it's this good, well worth the purchase."

"Had on tap at chappys in dayton. Served in tulip glass. Nice dark color, could not see if it was black or dark brown. Nice smell for the style. Nice a malty tastes, little to no taste of hops. Had an awesome creamy feeling. As the beer warmed it got better. I would say it maybe was served too cold to begin with. Awesome beer from a awesome brewery, can't wait to see more of their stuff in cans, and hopefully some day in bottles too."

"On tap at Jackie O’s. Served in a sampler glass. Pours a moderately-dark brown color. Nose has sweet malt with a bit of caramel and a bit of darker malt. Flavor has a bit too much alcohol, but that’s balanced a good bit by the sweetness. Probably also tasted a bit boozy after just having had the ultra-smooth Dark Apparition on cask. Medium, full body. A slow sipper."

"Pours a murky brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, brown sugar, caramel, and a slight coffee aroma. Taste is much the same with an alcohol kick on the finish. There is a medium bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty but pretty strong."

"4.5 D: Good integration of flavors, easy to drink, great mouthfeel, and well balanced. I never thought I'd like a nitro version of anything so much better, but in this case I do."
