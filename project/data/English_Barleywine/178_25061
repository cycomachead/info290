Aroma is big peaty scotch smells, a bit of the signature nutty JW Lees in the backdrop. But really big smokey peat. Flavor is massive smokey peat, leather, tobacco, very light dry nuts, more peat, a hint of sweet caramel to balance. Whoah. This is like scotch, but without any of the booze burn. Very mellow. Medium plus mouthfeel with more carbonation than I got from the other BA versions of this. This might be my favorite variant, and it is bordering on incredible.","BMMillsy","Mar 27, 2014"

4.6,17.3,4.5,4.5,4.75,4.5,4.5,"Poured into a mini-snifter, the beer was a copper color with a modest slight white head. At the front, the aroma was a mild whiskey aroma. While the aroma was enjoyable, it would not make be want to buy the beer again by itself. In the initial taste, one gets sweet malts, nuttiness, amaretto, and a mild sourness. Even with an 11.5%ABV, this beer's alcohol does not leave an abrasive alcohol burn. The thick mouthfeel becomes more apparent in the aftertaste as the aftertaste lingers. I might define the aftertaste as a syrupy sweet alcohol that is masked well enough to be like a girly drink. This is an outstanding barrel aged barleywine.","JohnnyHopps","Jun 06, 2013"

The taste follows well with a sweet blend of all the aforementioned notes, plus a slight whisky burn and an indescribably smooth finish.

3.94,0.5,3,4,4,4,4,"275 ml bottle into tulip glass, 2005 vintage. Pours very hazy and cloudy reddish copper color with no head and some minimal lacing bubbles sticking to the side.

Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt notes with barrel character. Taste of big caramel, molasses, toffee, toast, raisin, fig, prune, vanilla, oak, whiskey, peat, light smoke, and dark earthiness. Lingering notes of caramel, molasses, toffee, toast, dark fruits, vanilla, oak, whiskey, light smoke, and earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice balance and complexity of malt notes with dark fruits; with a fair amount of barrel character that isnâ€™t overwhelming; and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Minimal carbonation and full bodied; with a creamy, slick, and fairly syrupy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice English barleywine. All around nice balance and complexity of malt and barrel flavors; and very smooth to sip on slowly.

The oceanic pungency that I love about Islay scotch is all but lost in the malt sweetness. The scotches themselves are plenty sweet, but still retain a balance. This one sadly does not. This is a great beer and very monsterous and a must try for anyone that loves this type of scotch, but be aware that the taste is of smoked wood, not smoked barley.

Took me 90 minutes to finish this because it's more like drinking three glasses of scotch than one bottle of beer.

This one pours a cloudy tawny amber with a light wisp of bubbles on top that dies away quickly enough to make me think it may have descended from teflon-drenched ninjas. The nose blasts the 'strils with peat-smoked whiskey goodness. Behind that (I think) are notes of toffee, mild citrus, and graham crackers. Man, that's a lot o' smoke! The taste is significantly different, with sweet toffee, maple syrup, candi sugar and caramel trouncing the taste buds just as the smoke dominated the smell receptors. A light bit of Sunny D-style citrus joins in, along with some o' that Lagavulin in the background, all surreptitious and whatnot. The harsh sweetness and seeming dearth of Lagavulin on my tongue hurt the overall score a bit. The body is a heavy medium, with a very light carbonation and a gooey feel.

There is virtually no head or lace on this hazy brown beer. Aromas consist of sweet malt, cherries, apple brandy, and alcohol. The scotch barrel really comes through nicely. Some time in the cellar served this beer very well. I had a very young bottle of this once, and didn't care for it much, as the alcohol presence was overbearing. This beer drinks very smoothly, as I'm sure the aging process mellowed this beast out a bit. This was a tasty beer, and good for sharing several ways. An ounce or two was plenty. I recommend trying this beer, but only after it has spent some years in the cellar.","Huhzubendah","Jun 26, 2010"

Booze soaked candied white grapes, sugar and honey, lots of pepper. There is a light smokiness from the whisy, which is nice and gives a much needed balance to this beer. Not much else of the whisky flavor comes through which is disappointing. The feel is thick and slick, soft carbonation; finishes very sweet, sticky. A big heavy pale malt brew. Lots of candied flavors, good smoke but not much actualy whisky flavor. Must say that I am disappointed with this beer.

When I think about this beer, it should be a murky black brown and purple, instead of the rich orangy-pink that it is. The nose on this thing is alll lagavulin, and that's a great thing. Smokey raisins and a light fusel alcohol burn. Some rich char and sweet honey malts push through the smoke. The flavor follows the aroma, sweet sweet smoke, dried fruits: raisins and figs, candied orange peel, finishes with a nice clean lightly smokey aftertaste. Goes down nice and smooth, lightly coating but not cloying or sticky. I could put these things away until I fell into a drunken coma, but the booze is definitely there.

Caramel and biscuit aromas were present in the aroma, but had a smoky, peaty character, nearly charcoal, sitting just above them. Slight vanilla and bread. Low bitterness, this is all about sweet malts and scotch. Lots of caramel, a hint of toffee, bread and biscuit, with a bit of smoke and peat that appear towards the finish. Lingering alcohol and Islay character. Full bodied, low carbonation, smooth and just short of sticky. Quite drinkable and tasty.","kegger22","Beers"

Rich, super sweet with loads of toffee and caramel flavors. Hints of apples and lots of vanilla are all over this one. The alcohol has all but faded away and left a supremly well defined ale in its place. Super rich and wonderful as the glass warms up to room temperature, it only seems to get better.

The excellence of the base beer shines through in the complex sweetness, but the whiskey cask doesn't seem to have contributed too much to the mix.

No lacing. The peaty, petroleum, salty Lagavulin is up front in the nose. Smokey grain and booze as well. First sip was a little off-putting, just like the cask of the whiskey it was finished in. After that, the beer settles in. Bitter, salty, peaty, smoky goodness. The oak and the sweeter caramel and toffee malts are a nice contrast in the finish. Some cherry and fig flavors come with it, but the star is the grain and malt of the beer balanced against the strength of the Islay malt. Slow but easy drinking without being sticky.

My sight and smell senses are telling me this is going to be one full flavored aggressive tasting beer. Just what I like. OK. The taste. Instantly I get hit by the fruit sweetness and in lesser amounts I taste the peat, vanilla, smokiness and then some slight hop notes. Then midway this beer evens out into silky smoothness and finishes very light as compared to how it started. Sure that was only the first sip. As the experience progressed the fruit flavors become more apparent. I taste cherries, plum and dates. This beer is very much like Avery's Samael except for the added peatiness.

The flavors were a slap across the face. So smoky I could barely believe it. Upon second sample the nearly-cloying sweetness came through first, typical barely wine dark fruit, raisins and dates, followed by the clearly whiskey imparted smoke. Sugar and smoke; reminded of a deep south BBQ sauce. Caramel, toffee and a surprisingly small alcohol nip masked by the complex flavors and aromas.

4.28,9.2,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"The base beer is delicious, in fact the 1999 Harvest Ale has been my favorite beer so far. The pour is noticeably different in colour, a bit darker amber, similar to a light burbon and was the haziest of the flight. The base flavors come through similarly to the 2006 Harvest ale, it's just as rich. The nose and taste are lightly overpowered by the Lagavulin characteristics. It's an interesting and complex addition, lending notes of wood, dust, smoke, light ash, like a very smooth burbon. This beer was quite young, and I think a few more years would mellow it out very nicely. I'd love to taste an earlier vintage (or the 2006 in a few years), hopefully the barrel characteristics would fall a bit into a subtle backbone and the sweet notes would smooth together, like noticed in the 99 and 02 vintages. Tasty and flavorful, just a bit unbalanced after one year. Nice sipper, less of a desert than the others.","BiereBlanche","Oct 09, 2007"
4.32,10.2,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Likely my least favorite of the cask-conditioned varieties offered by J.W. Lees. Of course the base-beer is phenominal, and just mature enough. The character that the Lagavulin whisky seemed to work within the framework of the Barleywine but has a few moments where it seems somewhat overbearing. The flavor of peaty Scotch gives the beer a strong ethynol flavor and feel that interferes slightly with the drinakability. The wood character gives the beer a very bold earthy, woodsy, peaty flavor that edges on fresh oak. The smoke flavor and aroma also persists throughout making the beer more campfire-like. When all the flavors come together, the beer turns out good -- not the normal 'great' that you get from J.W. Lee's, but only good this time. It seems that a couple of years is sorely needed to round the beer out and to meld the flavors together. The previous and younger versions seem overbearing with the Scotch flavor and feel but I didn't get the same impression here.","BEERchitect","Sep 30, 2007"

The taste is more beery than the aroma. It is very sweet with caramel, rock candy, and whiskey. The mouthfeel is full bodied, but considerably lighter than that of the version aged in port casks.

Unfortunately, this beer is somewhat of a mess. The beer is too sweet, and the whisky comes through merely through its powerful peatiness and nothing else. Its like someone watered down the Lagavulin and dumped a bunch of honey in it. The beer is sweet, viscous, and strong, and wildly out of balance. That being said, I think the beer has some real potential. I'm drinking a 2006 vintage. I think this needs about 5 years in the bottle to integrate and mellow. The color is a beautiful burnished orangey copper with no head or lacing. The smell gives you a hint of that wonderful Lagavulin smoke without it overwhelming. I'll review it again in five years.

A blast of smokiness comes through in the finish, which is very long and active. The mouthfeel is heavy but not really thick, and carbonation is quite light. It works, though, as it concentrates the flavors on the tongue extremely well. Overall this is a fabulous barleywine. I love the smokiness that the whisky barrels contribute; the fact that they do so without compromising the fruity aspect of the beer is very welcome.

3.82,-2.6,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Clear orange, a shade darker than the others apparently, not much head, but at least it tries. Deeply peaty aroma. Finally one of those BA JW Lees lets some uniqueness of character shines through. The vegetal tones IÂ’ve met in the others is there as well, but more subdued amongst the smooth earthy scotch-like profile. Sweet leather and almost cheesy hints adds to the richness. More leather and caramel on the tongue. Very earthy and peaty, smoky even with plenty of iodine medicinal character. Like the others, it remains very syrupy, oily and alcoholic, though perhaps not as stale. Flavourful beer without a doubt.","Rastacouere","Aug 26, 2004"
3.83,-2.3,4,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,"Pours out amber with about an inch and a half of off white head. It shrinks down but manages to keep a small head through the consumption of this brew. Scatterings of lace were left as well on the glass. Strong smells of smoke rise from the glass accompanied by a malty sweetness and a bit of a woody scent. The alcohol and smoke really start to stand out as this warms. Taste is similar to the aroma as the smokiness and sweetness make up the majority of the flavor. There are notes of alcohol as well, this is quite the warming brew good for a cold rainy day. The sweetness is not cloying here like some of the other cask JWÂ’s. Aftertaste is sweet with a slight bite of alcohol. Mouthfeel is syrupy and full. Drinkability was pretty good at first but once it warmed the smokiness and the alcohol were a bit too much. Overall a good brew though.","meathookjones","Aug 23, 2004"
3.94,0.5,3,4,4,4,4,"I was very happy with the texture and thickness of the beer, but was disappointed by the lack of complexity in the flavor. The smoke was there, but unlike the scotch it wasn't peaty in the sense that the planty and woody flavors weren't mixed in with the smoke. Ultimately the beer manages to get across a Lagavulin feel if not actually the flavor. The achohol taste takes a backseat to the ale flavor, which keeps the beer very drinkable even at 11.5%.","StuFox","Aug 11, 2004"
3.87,-1.3,3.5,4,4,4,3.5,"I was expecting more whiskey in the nose and the flavor here, but this lightly carbonated, sweet honey-colored brew uses the whiskey as more of a note than a blare. The alcohol aroma could easily be coming from the beers own substantial ABV. Honey, sweet caramel malt and alcohol dominate the aroma and flavor with a bit of a clean bitterness finishing up the flavor.","aracauna","Jul 28, 2004"
3.57,-8.9,3.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Edit: As it warmed even further toward RT, smoke and alcohol became much more intense, severely affecting the mouthfeel and drinkability at that point.","ppoitras","Jul 25, 2004"
4.82,23,4.5,5,5,4.5,4.5,"Bound to turn many off, just as Lagavulin scotch turns many off. I only caution, don't dismiss the aging potential of either.","putnam","Jul 03, 2004"
4.74,20.9,4,5,5,4,4.5,"Drinkability: Mmmm. I am quickly coming to the conclusion that J.W. Lees is the Dogfish analogue for the UK. They're creative, adventurous, and put out consistently high quality beer.","Afterburner","Jun 12, 2004"

4.62,17.9,4,4.5,5,4,4.5,"The beer is quite fruity, with notes of concentrated apple, and perhaps a hint of apricot as well. You can taste the alcohol in the finish as well as a bit of tannin, which is probably from the cask conditioning. If I had to guess, I would say that the Scotch adds a heartiness to this beer that compliments it quite well. I really wish I had been able to get more of these so I could age a few and see how they change over time. This is a very well integrated strong ale, just incredibly malty with a nice kiss of hops.","Gueuzedude","May 23, 2004"
4.77,21.7,4.5,5,4.5,5,5,"Poured an almost gold color with a very small head. Aroma of light smokiness and believe it or not, Lavavulin. The taste was like other JW Lees Harvests with the same smokiness of the aroma, in the taste. Warm and smooth. I had to try it alongside the scotch, as I have a bottle on hand. Although young, worth drinking now and once matured. A true gem.","Eyedrinkale","May 07, 2004"
4.4,12.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Okay, being a single malt scotch fan, I just had to break down and try this one despite the sticker shock. I am a particular fan of the Islay Island style of scotch like Lagavulin. This small bottle poured an amber gold color, forming a nice small foamy off white heat that coated the glass with lace as it slowly sudsided. A heavy, slow moving stream of bubbles was the carbonated lure of this one. An aroma of malt, some caramel and the elements that could only be the Lagavulin, but I do not know if it would be detectable by non scotch drinkers. It would definately still be seen as a wiskey aroma. The flavor was of malt, caramel and scotch wiskey. A cramy sweet finish with a warming feel of the alcohol that is definately present in this one. This one would no doubt be better with age.","Wildman","Beers"
4.77,21.7,4,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Backwash: This expression is certainly Â“primus inter paresÂ” amongst the special offerings. In fact, itÂ’s such a good combination, that I might take a page from Drewbage1847's book and start adding a little whisky to most of my future Harvest Ales. Like the marriage of Port and stout, this one is a real winner. I think IÂ’d buy the mixed case of these if I could substitute 3 more Lagavulins for the Calvados. Aged versions of this are likely to provide some serious fireworks.","Dantes","0"
