"Poured into a snifter. Pours orange red with a nice fluffy head. Smells of berries, slight grape, and sweet light grain. Tastes of berries, molasses, and slight alcohol. Beer is full bodied good carbonation. Overall, a very good beer."

"Poured a beautiful cloudy ruddy-brown with a thin tan head that burns off almost immediately. The aroma is pretty mild, with hints of hops and malt sweetness. The taste is a little more robust, with some nice dark fruit notes. The body has a nice fullness on the palate and a smooth finish."
"I'm forced to review this after having poured a glass with a flat head—I think I got unlucky and got one that had just lost some of its carbonation or something. That said, it still pours a deep reddish brown and tastes wonderful. It's kind of nutty and simultaneously smooth and robust. Fantastic beer."
"O- This is a good beer but it's not a barleywine.  It's a hoppy imperial red ale.  If it was labelled as such, I might've scored it higher."
""

"Overall:  This is a very nice barleywine.  Lots of good, bready, malty flavors melded with lots of toffee, dried stone fruit, candied sugar and nicely balanced hoppy bitterness.  Very, very tasty!"

"Overall - Bottle says best before 2013, not sure how far out they date their bottles.  This one seems like a little past its prime.  Some odd metallic/medicinal flavour and a little oxidized.  Had higher hopes for this one."

"Poured a reddish brown body with some decent head and lace retention. Aroma is a little boozy but nothing bad and there is both some dark fruit and sweet malts coming through. Beer is medium bodied, smoth, not only a touch of dark fruits (I'm thinking figs) there is a caramel and toffee, even almost candi sugar sweetness, that pokes through at times. The alcohol holds things in balance from being too sweet and there is a good malt base that keeps it held together. An interesting and enjoyable barleywine."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Verdict: An unfortunate disaster. Overly simple, but not refined in any way, too bitter, too astringent and just unpleasant. Perhaps the high levels of carbonation are a sign of slight infection? I can't quite say, the flavors don't appear to be ""off"" other than they just aren't that good."

"Pours a ruby red with a soapy head that leaves plenty of lace. Aroma of booze soaked fruit and rich malts. In the taste, caramel, toffee, nuts, raw chocolate and citrus. Full bodied, very flavorful beer. Overall this was a good barleywine, big fruit and sugar, little hint of alcohol. I'd love to age a bottle of this."
"O: Where did this come from? All I know about Duck-Rabbit is that they only brew dark beers - and that they struggle with infection problems. This, thankfully, isn't infected, just damn tasty. One of the better non-barreled barleywines I've had in a while."
""
""
""
" This is a very tasty and reasonably priced barleywine. If you like barleywines with a dark fruit flavour I'd recommend this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – Not too bad, but a little messy at the end of the taste as the bitter and sweet sorta collide with the booziness leaving a slightly off flavor in the mouth. Not one I would necessarily frequent."
""
""
""
"Overall: A very interesting barleywine. So many characteristics and still a tasty beer."
""
""
""
"O: A pretty simple barleywine but I really liked the toasted bread notes. They really come through strong and sharp. Tastes like you're drinking alcoholic liquid bread. The raisin is just enough to add another layer in with some raisin bread quality. Surprisingly tasty."

"overall, a very nice barleywine. decent complexity, and i like the hop-forward profile. if it was distributed around here, i would have a few more in the cellar, but wouldnt go out of my way to trade for it."

"Mouth feel is medium bodied with a nice amount of oily and boozy touch. Warmth from alcohol is somewhat strong. Low to moderate carbonation."
"Big thanks to Illudium for the sample!"
""
""
"Overall - aged amazingly well, though the tartness at the end gets lengthy after a while, approaching cough syrup like flavor at times. Overall, a successful aging experiment in my book."
"O: pretty decent. liked the fruity character. i love the body of most barleywines, but this one was a little thin for me. there's a lot of confused malty character that has potential. could be developed with aging?"
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"-Overall 4.25: Excellent brew. Complex, big and delicious. The 11% (!) ABV is completely invisible in the hazy swirl of hops, malt and yummy goodness. The dry-hopping was stroke of genius as was the added level of CO2. Excellent beer."

"O: Compared to Weyerbacher Insanity which I recently reviewed, this beer looked way better - beautiful to behold. The nose was comparable, but I didn't like the taste of this beer quite as much as the Weyerbacher. Really good English Barleywine, but I think I like the Weyerbacher better."
""
""
"Overall: I very solid English Barleywine. I do wish this one was available here in Utah."
"Drinkable barleywine with a signature all its own. Spicy, fruity, sweet, and sherried. Delightful."
""
""
""
""
"M: very full mouthfeel, very, very, drinkable, incredible rich and moreish"
""
""
"I enjoyed this beer when I tasted it at the ACBF. Lighter carbonation, complex but not overwhelming taste. It was pleasant to sip on while the flavors sorted themselves out. All in all, an interesting beer, one of my fonder memories from that (somewhat blurry) night."
""
""
"Duck Rabbit Barleywine Ale pours a color that's something between amber and mahogany, with no visibility through the glass possible. Maybe two fingers of cream colored foam top the beer and hang around for just a bit before fading. Lacing is spotty. The nose features aromas of caramel, fig, and alcohol. There's also a background fruitiness that's just... odd, and a little out of place. The flavor opens with a healthy swirl of caramel. Just as a little bit of bitterness is coming into the picture, what certainly tastes like an infection comes into the picture. There's a slight medicinal twang to it, and a lime fruitiness that just clashes with everything that came before it. The infection hasn't impacted the mouthfeel too badly yet. The body is a little bit lighter than it should be, but the carbonation isn't too active yet. I've had other vintages of Duck Rabbit's barleywine that were pretty nice, but something definitely went wrong with at least part of this batch."
"Pours like a barleywine. Muddy amber brown with a quickly fading light tan head. Smells like cherry, leather, sherry, gently smoked fine meats, cardboard and bread. Slightly oxidized as expected but I'll be damned, it doesn't taste awful. Chewy and leathery body with delicate and thoughtful carbonation. Less fruity than the nose, more malt forward and proper British. Hell of a lot more enjoyable than the 2008 DR Baltic Porter I threw out my window. But seriously, what jerkoff ages Duck Rabbit beers?"
""
""
""
"O-This one didn't age as well as I had hoped. The pleasant complex sweetness that seemed to develop over time was overwhelmed by the strong alcohol after-taste. If that could be masked some how this would be an excellent ager."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I am intrigued, yet put off after the first 1/2. It becomes astringently sour--must be some sort of infection, unless they add an odd fruit they do not disclose."
""
""
"OVERALL: This is clearly not what others have tasted. Something is wrong and I hate that this is my first review for these guys. I've had some of their other beers in the past and thoroughly enjoyed them, just a shame they let this slip out."
""
"Appearance was normal. Everything else was not. Horribly infected, taste awful. Deserves a zero. Don't have much experience with Duck Rabbit, but the two beers that I was sent as extras were both infected. This does not make me want to really give their beers another try, seeing as they have such poor quality control standards."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The bottle should read ""Enjoy by Never"". This wasn't a terrible infection, but it was definitely present. There was some rays of hope in the nose with some of the intended flavors of the beer, but the flavor profile was downright bad in the taste. Cannot recommend."
""
""
""
"Overall: don't know what the problem was but if it werent for the nose and finish of sourness, this would have been an interesting and well balance barleywine...bummer."
"O: Very tasty, goes down dangerously easily, not too filling, very strong kick, good representation of style, this is a very good stronger beer to drink for as long as you can handle it."
"Very unique for a barley wine. alcohol is not apparent at all, very easy to drink. Definitely a sipper though. citrusy, grapefruity, hoppy and a tad sweet. Citrus flavor is quite intense. Very unique and another quality offering from the Duck Rabbit."
"Thanks crunkchiggin2002 for extraing me this one!"
""
"Big, boozy, piney, with a bit of sour cherry and strong malt backbone. Appearance is a slight red color with not much head retention or lacing. Aroma is pie cherry, bready, with citrus notes. Taste is of strong malt backbone but not sweet, generally dry, perhaps a bit over-attenuated, with wonderful sour cherry notes that go well with the malt and surprisingly well with the piney citrus hops. Infected? No. Metallic? Certainly not. Sour? A bit, but very interesting in the style, and very enjoyable. I would say that the malt and hops carry through to make this a true barleywine but the sour edge gives it a unique twist."
""
""
""
"Overall: very drinkable for the style and hides the alcohol well but this one is strange and may be infected especially considering the recent reviews describing this though I suspected it before reading those reviews."
"D - Weird, this almost seems like a sour with the level of acidity and the odd, yeasty notes. I'm really conflicted about whether this is infected or not, it has some really strange characteristics and it is oddly dry for an English barleywine. The smoky character is really odd for the style and almost to the level that it would be unpleasant. Not something that I would drink again except to confirm that it is supposed to taste like this."
"I'll be honest though, I don't find this beer utterly undrinkable. After the initial shock, one could muscle through it if one was so inclined to look for it's alcohol effect. But sadly, I'll be drain-pouring this bottle in search of something else."
""
""
""
"Poured out promisingly enough, with a garnet color and decent head. Classic barleywine aromas of raisin, honey, and cherry, although this was a bit cold to really get a good sense of it. Unfortunately, all changed when I tasted it and got a mouthful of one of the foulest metallic brews I have ever encountered. Completely undrinkable. Gave it 30 minutes to see if warming up would help at all and regretted going back for another sip. Drain poured the rest."
""
"The beer pours a dark red color with an off-white head. The aroma has a lot of piney hops in it, as well as some heavy caramel and brown sugar notes. There is also some alcohol in the aroma. The flavor is similar. There are some pine and orange notes in the flavor which go well with the heavy caramel malt backbone. There is also some brown sugar-like sweetness. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
""
""
""
""
"thanks redliner8!!!"
"O: Wow, incredibly disappointed. This is clearly infected. If this is the brewer's intention, I have to say that I hate this. Brett and tartness in a barleywine just don't work for me."
""
"330ml bottle. Snifter glass. Enjoyed on dec´11. Dark ruby in color, orangish to the light. Close & dense crown, yellowish color, small bubbled with good retention. Caramel malt & sweet toasted malt aromas, notes of prune & raisin. Sweet bitter upfront then moderate flavor of malts & gentle warming alcohol.Hues of spices & cask-wood. Full body, medium carbonation. Overwhelmed molasses in the middle lingers into a kind sugary finish. Ripe fruits on the aftertaste. No bothering high ABV."
"Poured into a Mad Elf tulip glass after letting it sit about an hour or so out of the fridge. Aroma is very much like an IPA, which could fool you if you didn't know which beer was in front of you (but how often does that happen). Definitely much more full budied than Old Horizontal or the Appalachian Brewing Co. barleywine I've had (those are the only other two I've tried). Definitely a sipper but also incredibly drinkable for a beer of this style. A nice 6-ounce glass (or a whole 12-ounce bottle if you're me) make for a perfect aperitif before fish or chicken."
""
""
"The sourness of this one really threw me off, also very lightweight for a barley. Doesn't taste like 11% but you can feel it. Not a bad beer but I've had much better barleys. I wish it wasn't so sour."
""
"This is a very good brew! I admit was surprised at the smoothness and drinkability having expected more of bite, but found none. The aroma had hints of caramel, citrus, and even cinnamon and molasses. It was very drinkable, not overwhelming in the least with a pleasant aftertaste and none the “heavier” beer note at all. A thoroughly enjoyable beverage, one for my favorites list!"
"Drink-  A very tasty beer. Has a large flavor profile. Complex, tasty and sweet. Classic BW flavors and the ABV is well hidden"
""
""

"Overall I've NEVER had a barleywine that tasted like this, it's real impressive, but perhaps not one I would go nuts over. Great beer."
"O: Highly recommended. I'm not incredibly familiar with the style and thus can't speak to how well this brew adheres to its tenets, but I know a good beer when I taste one. I love The Duck Rabbit's offerings, and this is my favorite beer of theirs. This could become my new go-to ""good"" beer."
"This is a good beer. It's a sipper but it's highly drinkable. It's balanced, hoppy, and a little sweet. I think a little age would mellow it out more, but it's good as is. The citrus quality is intense and may not be for everyone, but I liked it."

"This beer pours a medium bodied dirty, cloudy copper with a one finger soapy off white head. The nose is surprisingly oaky and dry. The matinees is sweet with sme cherry and toffee. The flavors too are pretty woody, especially for a beer that isn't advertised to be barrel aged otherwise it follows the nose with candied sugar and cherry. It drinks between light and medium in body and isn't overly sticky. It finishes dry fr the style if anything. This is an interesting barley wine. Its worth a try and is a nice change of pace for the style."
"Mouthfeel and drinkability are really good. Well balanced and well blended. Full bodied with a good carbonation level. Slight warmth from the alcohol, almost a burn to the point where it's slightly hotter than you want it to be, but makes it a nice sipper. All in all a nice barleywine, very tasty!"
"***picked this beer up at a local restaurant/bar that was having a ""vintage beer"" sale. Not sure when this beer was produced, but the ""drink by"" date was Feb 2012. Drank on Jan 27 2012. I would have expected a barleywine like this one to have aged better. Decent beer, but not what I was expecting."
""
"O: This is about on par for the correct style. Huge hop presence makes this kinda hard to drink though."
""
""
""
"C = Doesn't particularly offend, but nothing here to make me revisit this, when there's so many better options out there."
"Overall, its really good. I like my Barleywines malty and this is a good one."
""
""
"O- This is a solid beer, nothing more nothing less, I enjoyed it, above average beer but not mind blowing."
""
""
"A solid English barleywine that i feel is a bit above average."
""
"O: This is decent. Nothing to write home about. I found it all right."
"O: I'm pretty amazed, actually. I wish I knew when this was brewed rather than when it's ""best by""...cause I'd say this sucker is perfectly aged. Not that Duck Rabbit makes bad (or even average)beers, but this was surprisingly good. Might have to go drink the other one I bought right after this one. Thick, sweet, but not overly so...complex, challenging and oh so tasty. One of Duck Rabbit's best regulars."
""
""
"O: Nice beer. Flavor a little off. would like a little thinner in the body."
""
""
"D/O - Drinkability is moderate. This is definitely on the sweeter side of the barleywine spectrum, but the taste does counteract this a bit with the hops. The biggest grievance I have against this beer is the somewhat hot alcohol burn in the flavor. While bold, the rest of the flavors have a tough time compensating for this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Some flaws, but overall this is a worthwhile barleywine. Would love to try it on draft."
"If you like barleywines, check it out, otherwise, its probably a 50/50 chance you dig it or don't."
"O: it is a good one to sip over a long period of time. But it is just warming enough to not be an everyday barleywine if there is such a thing."
"O - It's not horrible beer, but the taste is a letdown from what is a pretty good smelling beer. The heat isn't helping, but this isn't horrible."
"What can I say. A very nice barleywine - sweet, fruity, and potent, with nice dimension of flavor. Nothing mindblowing, but I'm okay with that. I don't find it boozy at all; in fact, if I hadn't looked at the label first, I'd be quite surprised it's as strong as it is."
"D - This is a pretty good barleywine. However, I think this was still pretty dang hot and boozy. I could see this really coming into its own in a couple of years. Recommended now, and I am sure 10 years from now."
"Mouthfeel is thick and rich with chewy malt throughout. Definitely a warming sipper of a barleywine that leaves a bit of a heat trail as it goes down. Glad to have tried it...would be great on a cold night maybe even with a nice cigar."
"A decent showing. Definitely be better to have on a cold night instead of this relatively warm one. I like my barleywines with a little more ""fruit"" presence but this is still enjoyable. A nice extra, but wouldn't trade for it."
"O- Pretty decent in a barleywine. I really like the unfiltered look. The flavors were strong, but not standout. Great to be introduced to barleywines with this."
"O: The flavour has an unpleasant kick in the tail. 3.5"
"O: Super light feeling. Drinkability is insane."
"O: pretty good barleywine. I wouldn't search it out again, but have wanted to try it."
"O - I'm surprised by how much I liked this beer, it's held up surprisingly well for its age. I'm kinda wishing I bought more to see what further aging could do!"
"O- This was a nice drinking barleywine. Nothing over the top but a nice sipping beer on long winter nights. The ABV is a little on the high side and it shows up a lot but adds a light secondary flavor. Overall would love to get my hands on some more of these bottles."
"Thick, syrupy, and smooth. Nicely balanced and tasty."
"This barley win pours out as a murky looking brown color, the head is an off white color and leaves a pretty good lacing also. The smell of the beer has a good hoppiness to it, there are some boozey aromas coming off of it also. The taste of this has a good malt base with some pine nots in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is pretty good here, it's got a nice thickness about it. Overall it's not a bad barley wine at all. Found it to be pretty enjoyable."
"Overall this stays true to an English Barleywine. Strong and hoppy with the malt character taking a backseat. It's robust and flavorful, but ultimately unrefined. I would love to get my hands on a few more bottles to stick in the cellar."
"Pours a clear dark orange with one finger cream colored head that settles slowly to a quarter inch and leaves splotchy rings of lace down the glass. Smell: a ton of caramelized sugars, faded pine and earthy hopping, date, a little apple skin. Taste: again lots of caramel atop toasted grain, piney and earthiness, red plum with skin. Medium bodied, sugary, very earthy and drying finish. Pretty good. Notched as best by 12... 2012?"
"O: I think it's solid throughout and a very good barlewyine. This is my first beer from Duck-Rabbit and I thought it was satisfying and a very enjoyable treat. I'll be sure to pick up a couple bottles if I'm ever somewhere this is sold."
"decent beer, but the flavors are just a bit off for me."
"Served from bottle into a Duck-Rabbit snifter. Poured red-orange with a one finger off-white head that subsided to half a finger slowly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, dark fruit, caramel, cream, and sweet alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, dark fruit, and sweet alcohol. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a very good brew. Nicely well balanced flavor going on in this one that you never would get tired of. Also has an excellent aroma going on to match it. A definite must try!"
"Overall due to case laws I have not found a place that has Duck Rabbit six packs. Singles run between 3-4 dollars so I could easily throw 10-12 dollars on a four pack. Definitely a fine barleywine."
"o - overall, this is a pretty big beer. it is good. nothing crazy."
"O - I loved everything about this beer. Simply delicious. A sipper for sure, but a great treat. A little to heavy for an everyday drinker, but excellent overall."
"O - Not a very interesting beer, and I love English BW but this one falls a bit off the wagon. Weird metallic taste and a bit of a messy taste, unbalanced."
"Nice balance of flavors, very rich."
"overall just too sweet and that overwhelmed everything else."
"O - I tend to forget that there IS a difference between American and English Barleywines, and drank about 1/4"" of this not knowing what was happening, then I remembered that this is an English barleywine. Given that, I'd say it's a pretty nifty representation of the style, but just a tad more in the alcohol area than others I've had. Not for drinking after two or three other beers but as a nice aperitif, I think it works pretty well with all the sweet cherry tastes going on."
"D: not very impressed with this one. just not sweet enough for an english barleywine. even if it was mislabeled here on BA, i still wouldn't classify it as a good example of american barleywine."
"January 2009 bottle. Pours a perfect brown that pops red held up in front of a light, with two fingers of tan head. This looks dead on. Smell is sweet and fruity, but not too sweet. A twinge of faded hops. Smells very good. The taste is not as good as the appearance or the nose. A faded hop bitterness starts things out and dries the palette. This gives way to a bit of sweetness that pokes its head out and then falls back away. The taste is all drying dead hops. What a let down. This is one to open after a few more years or fresh, I would guess. In this bottle, the hops suppress the malt flavor almost entirely, but taste dead themselves. Mouthfeel is a bit bigger than medium with that drying in the mouth. Solid carbonation. Overall, this beer is a big letdown. It just doesn't taste very good. Never had an English Barleywine that was bland, dry and with little to no sweetness. Maybe this is just a dead period in the aging."
"Overall, a good barleywine that doesn't show too boozy. Thanks for the opportunity!"
"If you're looking for a crazily malty beer, this is a good one. Drinkable as a sipper, definitely don't want to be sessioning this stuff."
"O- A fantastic beer. I'd have another."
"Taste starts sweet, lightly fruity in the middle, then goes all tannins and alcohol at the close. Leathery lingering. Mouthfeel is soft over the tongue, not quite as smooth as I would hope, and drinkability is pretty good. Not as exciting as I hoped."
"Overall this beer does not remind me of an English Barleywine. There are way too many hops and no sweetness. Seems to be unbalanced"
"12oz bottle: This one pours a cloudy orangish dark amber color. There was a small off white head on it that leaves some lacing. Piney and citrus hops to the nose, but not overly done. Some caramel and mustiness also. The taste is good. Subdued bitterness, with lots of citrus and some hop flavors. fair amount of caramel malt, with the sweetness masked and balanced by the hops. Somewhat dry finish. Not bad at all."
"This should age quite nicely. The pine and caramel notes are in a bit of conflict right now, but some age should round those flavors out and cut some of the heat off the finish. My guess is that, with a couple of years on it, this will become quite extraordinary. As it is, this is well worth a try, especially if you like your Barleywines to be just one step away from being a DIPA."
"Interested to taste these with some age."
"D: A very well-balanced barleywine, especially for 11%. Goes down easily and doesn't leave me feeling like I'm about to get diabetes like some. The alcohol is definitely present, but without being too hot."
"All in all, this is an ok brew. I've had many better balance barleywines. This one seems more like a booze bomb blended with a very dry taste blended in. Maybe try if you like DR, but if you're looking for a good example of the style, this is not it."
"Comes off as more of an American barleywine, but it's pretty good. Could use more malt presence but it has some nice stuff going on."
"Rich golden brown beer with a clean head with some retention. Really classic English malt profiles, rich caramel, toasted brown sugar, raisin, molasses, hints of cocoa, toast. Light citric hopping which provides a light bitterness and drying in the finish. Hides the ABV real well, very full flavored. Just so tasty."
"D: Not easy to put down by any means for the style. However, this brew is flavorful enough and lacks any taste of alcohol to add to its drinkability considering its style."
"D: This had a nice scent and taste, with well balanced elements. Not dissimilar from something like Old Ruffian or even a fresh Gratitude, but not quite as bold or complex as either of those. The alcohol was quite noticeable in the scent, not as much in the taste, so it was fairly easy to drink. This will probably improve with age, as it's still a bit rough around the edges. Fresh, this beer was good, but it was only reminiscent of the truly great barleywines."
"As good as this is now, I could see some age doing wonders for this beer. I might just have to convince the wife we need a whole six pack in addition to the two singles I bought."
"Final Thoughts - I didn't go into this beer with high expectations but I finished this beer very impressed and am sorry that I don't have another. Well Done!"
"The mouthfeel is on the heavier side with carbonation being about average for the style. It has a bit of a rich and creamy feel to it as well. Drinkability is pretty good, it had a nice rich malty flavor to it but also didn't become too sweet. Pretty good version of the style and an enjoyable beer to sip on this evening."
"D: If this wasn't listed as a barleywine, I might have a hard time telling considering how drinkable it is. A bit of warmth from the alcohol peeks through, and sweetness may be just a tad overpronounced, but even saying that is nitpicking."
"D: I like this one quite a bit. If they can cut down on the residual sugars and get this down a bit more they will have a real winner on their hands."
"Wow, really well crafted. Not cloying at all. Wraps all the classic barley malt inside a fuzzy edged hoppiness."
"(71st)"
"I like."
"D - OK, but this beer is obviously a little hot right now. I'm not sure how old (or young) this bottle is, but it could probably benefit from a few more months in the cellar, if not a year."
"All in all, before I had my first Duck Rabbit beer, I was ridiculously excited about this brewery. While there have been some exceptions (Milk Stout is very good, Schwarzbier is aboe average) for the most part I've been disappointed. For a dark beer specialist, their specialty is rather unrefined."
"Comes out of the tap an opaque light reddish chocolate-brown with a fine-bubbled, pale yellowish tan head. Strong, malty, fruity-sweet aroma is rather inviting. Flavor is strongly fruity and, like a proper barleywine, has a fierce alcohol bite. Texture is lively, edgy and tingly."
"Tasted very nice, follows the nose, some oak in there as well. A bit hot in alcohol, but I am very much enjoying this beer. Medium body, slight funk in the aftertaste, but you get used to it pretty quick. Nice beer."
"Quite the enjoyable barleywine. The hops are a bit aggressive right now (especially given the style) so if you have one of these I'd recommend waiting a few months to let it mellow out a bit. A bit of age should really bring out the malt flavors and could make this an excellent beer going forward. As it is now it's good, just not great. Recommended."
"D - Decent, not the best but I think I'll give the other bottle a few years and revisit it then. 3.5"
"A nice fall/winter brew. I'll update my scores upon trying this one fresh. Not exactly what I look for in a barleywine, but I'd like to try it 1) fresh and 2) with a couple of years on it. Not the best, but not the worst, of the DR seasonals."
"D: OK, at 11%, this isn't one I'm going to have too many of, even more so as it was a single of a beer not distributed in my state, but I certainly wouldn't mind having another."
"Poured into a snifter. Body is a moderate copper color with a very small white head. Some legs on the side of the glass. The nose is some brown sugar, a bit of fruit, booze, and caramel. Taste is pretty good with some sweet bread and fruit plus a bit of booze and caramel. Feel is slightly boozy but the flavors combine and have a nice body. Drinks well but could use some age."
"Notes: Hmmm, I haven't had much stuff from The Duck-Rabbit but when I have the quality has been pretty commendable and worth repeating. This brew adds to that conclusion."
"D: Great all the way around."
"D: An odd outlier of a barleywine with some different and not cohesive, fruity aspects combined with a very bready, toasty malt profile produces a weird mix of flavors that don't quite add up."
"D - Nice drinkability. I could drink about a pint or two bottles a night. Its boozy but at 11% it's kind of expected. I enjoy it though and am glad I got to try it."
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a snifter. It pours a deep copper with a nice sticky 2 inch white head. The aroma is sweet and has a ton of bready notes. Lots of sweet toffee and caramel with a pleasant,warming alcohol finish. Definitely a full bodied sipper. An enjoyable barleywine."
"DB- A strong Barleywine with big dark fruit profile. Aggressive but I enjoy that in this style. This would probably age pretty well if the malt came forward a bit more."
"Mouthfeel is full and creamy, low to medium carbonation."
"Nice! I'd tried this once before and remembered it being pretty enjoyable. It held up similarly well blind; definitely would like to drink more of this as well as DR's other stuff."
"D: I purposely let this beer age a little bit before drinking it because of hearing about the alcohol strength. Even with several months on it, I still find the beer to be on the harsh side."
"Nicely drinkable, but not for me. Very well made though."
"Great way to end the day. Slowing doing to enjoy and savor one of the finer barley wines."
"MF/D: an initial sizzle of carbonation but leaves a dry heat in the back of the mouth. certainly a new take on the barleywine, but i'm glad i shared the bottle."
"Thin head, covers the surface, just, eggshell white, some larger bubbles form an island to the side, zero lacing. Murky liquid, mix of muddy brown to orange rust to sand yellow, completely opaque, no clear sign of any floating matter inside. Richly layered nose of fruitcake, rum raisin ice cream, walnuts, fig, golden raisin, apricot, peach and pineapple, slides in white and pink grapefruit, mandarin orange before the honey and molasses sweetness catches, cuts a sharp enough profile that you can only rarely catch scents of chocolate or cocoa. Full-bodied, drier than expected, however, this doesn't impede its ability to cover the whole palate. Pine and orange, lemon, grapefruit citrus appear first, certainly has the hops to challenge the malts. Maple syrup, brown sugar are moderate and, while boozy, there's little burn. The fruit fresher here, less raisin, fig and more peach, apricot, pear, red cherry. Lowkey nuttiness and breadiness, just parts of a whole. You sense that the carbonation is trying hard but still unable to break up the density. Keeps your mind engaged but a bit tiring to drink."
"Balance is the charm here, and even within balance there can be complexity. The 11 percent is definitely there, though not within the first couple of sips. A lovely sipper to be had."
"Overall, a very drinkbable english bwine. I like all the fruit flavors in this beer. For 11%, this drinks amazing. Nicely done."
"Drank it out of a bruery tulip glass. The first thing that you notice is the intense malt presence, which obviously goes with the style. The mouthfeel was lighter than most barleywines while still maintaining a respectable level of booziness. The taste was most of what you would expect out of a barleywine with some nice toffee notes thrown in."
"What a jaunty little cap. This brew pours a translucent burnt amber topped by a finger of off-white foam. The nose comprises caramel, toffee, booze, rye bread crust, and a bit of medicinal aromas. The taste also carries that medicinal astringency, along with some sharp citrus hops, toffee, and maple syrup. The body is a heavy medium, with a moderate carbonation and a gooey feel. Overall, I think this is the least of the Duck-Rabbit brews I've yet had. It seems as though something went awry, I just can't put my finger on it."
"Drinkability is very high, dispite the ABV."
"I can see a 5 year old bottle of this being incredible."
"at 11%, i'm not sure i'll be having another."
"D: I would definitely get this one again. Not one you could throw back a few of, but a nice sipper. Tasty, toasty, malty and delicious."
"Blech. I don't really understand why this isn't classified as an American-style barleywine - the hops are much more dominant than the malts. Regardless of which category it belongs in, this is a poor beer. I have a few more of these which I will age, but I'm not expecting great things. A very disappointing beer from a brewery I usually enjoy."
"D: I'm going to have to put some age on these beers. Hopefully that will mellow that alcohol out. if it works i think this will be a pretty good beer but at the moment its a little to strong"
"D - Delicious, slow sipping beer. A little too heavy-handed with the alcohol, but otherwise very nice."
"Pours a very hazy carmel color into tulip with fine carbonation and slight head which coats with an oily sheen. Smells sweet and fruity with malt and alcohol. Tastes of carmel, malt, resiny sweetness, figs and raisins. A bit boozy. Nice grain and citrus notes also. Slightly spicy with a hoppy bitterness in finish and a lingering dryness. Mouthfeel is rich and full. First Barleywine review for me and was well pleased overall. A strong ale and one is plenty. Thanks Grant."
"Drinkability: Very decent for my first barleywine and does go down well almost reminded me of a stout. Load of sweetness and i didn't mind it too much. Cheers!"
"Flavor is decent, not the best barleywine, and not the best Duck Rabbit beer. Sharp, creamy, mild quick fruit notes...leading way to malts and hops which last the majority of the flavor. Slightly dry on the back side. Mouthfeel is medium body, medium carbonation. The booze definitely has quite a bite in this one. A very good barleywine, but again, not the best."
"D- The booziness gets to me after a while. This is still a good beer though."
"Pours a dark brown with a great looking garnet hue when held to light, tightly bubbled off white head peaks out but retreats under the bed with the cats. Smells mostly of sweet dark fruit with a touch of alcohol. Cherries prunes and a bit of brown sugar in there. Taste follows the smell. Alcohol soaked cherries rolled in brown sugar and lightly caramelized sums it up pretty well. Finish is rather dry with a lingering almost sweet and sour fruit. Thick body, light carbonation, sweet sticky mouthfeel. I really liked this one. Its a nice take on an English style barleywine, I wish I could get my hands on some more to lay down..."
"Drinkability: ""Can't stand the heat? Get yourself from out the kitchen."" That's how I'm feelin right now. Alcohol dominates and steals all my candy. Bummer. I finished this beer without a problem, but it was only enjoyable because of the buzz it produced."
"D - This is a let down, it smelled good but the taste is just too bitter for me. I wish more of the other flavors could come through, but it isn't terrible either. Worth a try."
"For a 11% barleywine this is actually quite drinkable. I'm not sure I'd want more than one, but I had no problem taking this down."
"Drinkability is moderate at best, but overall it is pretty balanced and smooth for the style."
"Overall, an ok beer which I would not mind having again sometime. Smell and appearance are by far the highlights."
"Appears reddish orange in color with a small tan head with a nice ring. Smells of caramel, rich malt, fruit, bready. The taste is big caramel, deep fruit, butter, nutty. The body is medium and the carbonation is smooth! A very tasty BW."
"'08 vintage courtesy of RomanW70. Poured a deep caramel/toffee color with a thin slick of foam and a semi-hazy clarity. Some spots of lacing exposed during the tasting, but no adhesion. Nose reveals toffee, raisins, figs, candy and alcohol. Taste is buttery and sugary with dark fruits making up the backbone (figs and raisins). Mouthfeel was medium-light (lighter than anticipated) with an mild carbonation. An easy drinking, well-balanced barleywine. I've yet to be disappointed by this brewer."
"D:"
"D: Fairly easy drinker, alcohol burn is very minimal for such a high abv. Think this one may need a bit of time to mellow out the hoppiness."
"Pours a beautiful mahogany color with a thick and frothy tan head. The aroma is a little hoppier than you would expect from an English BW, with big floral and citrusy notes, along with some caramel, toffee, molasses and some dark fruit. The flavor has some fig and plum notes initially, along with caramel and toffee, floral hops, green apple, rum raisins, and a little sourness. The mouthfeel is full and rich, and drinkability is pretty good for the style. A really solid english barleywine, much better than Brooklyn's Monster Ale...fairly idiosyncratic as it's hoppier than you would expect and has a little sourness to it that adds complexity."
"D: I'm liking this Barleywine a lot more than some others I've tried, it has a nice showcase of sweetness and balance, and the alcohol is well hidden"
"Overall, this is the best smelling bw I've had. If they could lose the alcohol in the taste that would be a top 100."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a pint glass. Dark amber, brown in color with only abundant head. This beer has a strong hop taste up front, lots of malts along with candied fruits, dried plums, grapes. An overly sweet, juicey citrus bite from the hops. Very strong boozey smell, not very well hidden at all. Mouthfeel is heavy and chewy, this one is a sipper with limited drinkability."
"Not their best offering, but still good and fairly refreshing for a barleywine."
"D: it was a good offering and I could drink more of this."
"D-this is a little bit of a mess, its kind of all over there in the taste and really hoppy for an english barleywine. The booze is quite strong throughout and not something I would want to drink frequently."
"Good drinkability, with the alcohol being well-concealed in the smell and taste. Delicious smelling and tasting beer!"
"More of American bareywime because it was really hoppy. Nice caramel sweeness but not overpwering at all. Loads of citrus from the hops and beer smelled similar to what is tastes like. Body was light for a BW and I really liked this beer and was extremely impressed. Nice job! D-R"
"This is a damn good beer...incredibly drinkable. It has a great body, it's fruity, with hints of bitter hops. The finish is dry, which opens the beer up and gives"
"I think one bottle is enough for a nice sipper on a cool NC night."
"Pours a dark copper brown, almost black, but clear, and with a solid tan head. Smells like brown sugar, sweet malt, candied fruit. A lot of alcohol on the nose, and a hint of coffee and cigarettes. The first taste is powerful, with a strong alcohol bite, but follows up with lots of malt, sugar, and waves of toffee, caramel, honey, and raisins. It's surprisingly smooth, and after the first taste it's increasingly drinkable -- and at 11% alcohol, perhaps dangerously so."
"The palate, unfortunately, doesn't live up to the nose. A grainy astringency is very strong, husky and palate-wrecking. It even covers up the sweetness to a good extent. Once my palate has had a chance to get used to it, I notice a blend of fruit - dates, raisins and a little stone fruit (peach? apricot?) coupled with a solid sweetness with flavors of caramel, honey and some toffee. Sweet and astringent on the finish, there's lingering flavors of honey and some astringency. Full in body with moderate carbonation, this is decent on the palate. A bit of a sipper, not necessarily something I'd go out to seek."
"The Achilles heel of this body, you just can't embrace it. How dark are barleywines anyway? Why are the self-proclaimed ""dark beer specialists"" making a barleywine? Though respectably true to style, it's okay at best."
"Would I buy more of it? - Absolutely, I love this and all of the other beers that Duck-Rabbit produces."
" D- This beer has a rich malt with a slightly sweet flavor and a dry finish with just enough hops to support the malt."
"D - This wasn't tops on my barleywine list, but it was decent. The strange tartness in the nose and the amount of carbonation didn't ruin the experience, but didn't help either."
"Taste is Fairly decent, nice fruitiness with a light burn from the high abv. Mouthfeel is creamy and rich. Light carbonation and thick feel make it quite drinkable for such a big beer."
"Full body is well carbonated. Not sure on the age, but this has aged pretty well. At leats a couple years old."
"4/4/4.5/4.5/4.5"
"Drinkability- Definitely one of the better Barleywines I've ever tasted. Its super smooth and easy drinking and amazing that it's 11% because its hidden very well. It's got that nice balance between sweet/bitter-malty/hoppy. It's the beer I was expecting without any disappointment. Great beer, thanks Jeff!"
"Hit first with a kind of sharp liquerise flavor with the raisin present too. Towards the back end the heat turns up and the flavor mellows and becomes a little sweeter, which is nice. The mouth feel is thick and a bit chewy which helps coat the mouth with flavor. Pretty good, I look forward to more of these in the winter hopefully."
"D - Pretty good for the style."
"Overall, I was impressed. Duck Rabbit does some good things and this is not an exception."
"Sweet aroma, strong flavor, warm booziness. It's good, but holy crap it's strong. This is definitely a sipping beer. Enjoy it on a cool fall night."
"Drink is not to hot. A bit too much warmness and not enough balance to make this sessionable.But then again what barleywine really is sessionable."
"A 12 ounce bottle, freshest by 12/09. Poured into my Adnams Imperial pint tumbler. The ale appears a hazed crimson copper color with about a finger of ecru foam. The head leaves only minimal traces of lace behind. Nose and flavor consist of caramel, brown sugar, pine, tangerine, lemon, apples, sourdough bread, grass, raisins, sweet smelling, bitter tasting. Nicely carbonated with a medium to full body. Not much alcohol burn to speak of. Quite drinkable fresh while the hops are still abundant."
"Drinkability is great I like it but only one a night!"
"Tastes surprisingly sweet, given its style and aroma. The malt is thick and it cuts into your tongue like a chainsaw through jello, but the long caramel sweetness is balanced nicely by the bitter spice of european hops."
"A very nice Barleywine, done in true Duck Rabbit fashion. Deep mohogany color with brilliant clarity. Off white head persists for the duration while leaving ample lacing and legging behind. A classic look. Strong barley flavors take over from there with a sukist grain taste and aroma that completely dominates the beer. Molassas, maple syrup, sorgum, nuttiness and plump grain flavors combine with plumbs, raisons, grapes, dates, figs, and nuts for a rich and complexly flavored ale. Hop flavor gives an herbal, grassy note without interferring with the barley taste. No phenolics or unnecessary alcohols to detract. Very nice malt texture sets the stage for the mouthfeel while a light syrup feel reminds us of a beer that isn't quite dry. Sweet without cloying, rich without sticky, and full without thickening, the beer has a bold but delicate texture. Perhaps the hop rates here are a bit high compared to J.W. Lees or Tom Hardy's but the toasted barley gives a bit more complexity than lighter Barleywines. Another world class beer by Duck Rabbit."
"Overall:"
"Drinkability: Nicely balanced flavor profile makes this a solid barleywine, although I would place it in the American rather than English category"
"Very very good offering. It's one to relax and think about. Again, a stogie would play famously here. Something that would go nice with a bourbon in the sidecar. Nicely done."
"D - Too hot to really have more than one bottle. Otherwise it's pretty easy to drink - the aftertaste isn't too strong. I suspect this will be good well beyond December."
"Great frothey mouthfeel, but pretty hot beer that could use some quiet time."
"A hearty carmel cream colored head nearly reaches two fingers than starts to crackle away. Body is a robust mahogany in color. Nose is nicely sweet with some vanilla oak and dark fruit sweetness. Includes a sappy hop character as well. Enters the mouth with an initially creamy smoothness, yeasty sweet caramelized malt, tangy dark fruit and burnt graham cracker. Hop profile adds perfect balance and a bit of sappy, piney, marmalade notes. Warms the belly ice but otherwise well hidden alcohol. Mouthfeel is very pleasant and resin like sweet. A super drinkable barleywine. This is a solid brewery."
"D- Bleh. The finish and mouthfeel and strong alcohol make this tough to get through."
"Pleasantly surprised with this one, will seek out more."
"D: Pretty smooth for a barleywine. Mine cost $3, it's a pretty cheap buzz."
"not bad at all, even with all the citrusy/piney american hopping. the fact that it was comparatively restrained while still solidly malty is what puts it somewhat between american and english in style. anyway, it certainly helped to get rid of the taste from those wretched bottles of 1996 gales old ale that i just had to endure prior to this..."
"This one came as a gift from some friends going to Philly, many thanks. Pour reveals a copper colored beer, with less than a finger of white head. Smell is of sweet brown breads, a bit of metallic aroma, dark fruit and alcohol. Taste is initially sweet upfront. I get sweet molasses, alcohol, more dark fruit, and just a little hint of caramel. Body is heavy, though there is little carbonation, which makes it feel bigger than it really is. This is more of a sipper than anything else. Overall a good beer, though one that might benefit from a tiny boost of carbonation. This is my second beer from Duck Rabbit, and while their stuff is certainly respectable so far, both offerings have left a bit to be desired. Cheers"
"D- Very drinkable which is dangerous. I felt the alcohol half way through my chalice. Im not big on barleywines in general so I really don't know what im looking for in one, but I throughly enjoyed this one. One and done and a bottle or two in the cellar. I think this is past it's ""best by"" date but who cares, maybe they just have to put that on there."
"I had this bottle poured into a Duck Rabbit snifter. The beer is dark reddish copper color, transparent, almost no head. The beer smells sweet and malty, sort of sugary too. I think this favors the American barley wine category more than the English variety, a bit strong and sweet. The taste is likewise sweet with a little burn in the aftertaste. A lingering boozy quality. A very well done interpretation of a style I generally don't favor."
"A good barleywine, but on my rare forays into barleywine country, I'd pick up something else."
"Smells of oak, cashews, metal, bourbon, and earth. Mouthfeel is nice and crisp. A great pop from the medium to high amount of carbonation. Flavor profile is like the smell, earthy. It's got a dull bitterness going on. Nothing sharp like high hops would give, but bitter anyways. Alcohol is noted but more subtle than I thought an 11% brew would have. As the beer warms I get a sense of citrus in the finish. Like an orange rind. This is a decent brew. I think this may be my first English BW, but I will explore this genre again."
"D: Not bad. It seems more like an American Barleywine but even for that style it's average at best."
"The carbonation is right on and coats the tongue very nicely kind of sticky. I'm finding this stuff goes down nice and easy I could put away a few on these in a sitting."
"A nice barleywine not super but good I could easily drink this again, and would not turn it down. It gets much better as it warms and the head lasted the whole time. I have not been disappointed with one of their brews. I would love to see them move closer or distribute in the area"
" Very boozy, and an early spring cold night seems so right for it. Pours a dirty blond with fantastic splattering of lace. Smells and taste like a boozy barleywine, drinkable after all.A bit of substance to the mouthfeel."
"Drinkability: It's 11%."
"Wow, this stuff is great! Copper. Strong aroma and flavor of dark caramel and dark English toffee, with some mellow medium dark fruit, balanced by a pretty stiff herbal hops bitterness. Really kind of shockingly drinkable for a big barleywine."
"Leaves a burning alcohol residue down your throat. Cant' say enough about this beer even if it was on performance enhancing drugs."
"Poured into my duck-rabbit tumbler glass. Poured a small but decent head that left thick light brown lacing. The color is very dark, on the edges has a very dark maroon color to it. The smell is has a bit of friutfulness to it, detected a touch of alchohol. Taste has a up front fruity sweetness to it. Alcohol is fairly hidden in here but you can still in the end of it. Then backed up with a nice bit of hops at the end without much bitterness. Mouthfeel is very thick but smooth. Overall this is a decent barelywine."
"its good, but this doesnt hide the alcohol very well"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation, but it's not quite smooth enough."
"This isn't my idea of the ideal barleywine but that's not to say it doesn't still make for a good one. I'm still not entirely sure of just how much I like (or love) the beer but I had this same conundrum with this brewery's Imperial Stout. Like the drawing on their labels after which the brewery is named, this too can be seen as two different things: a good (what I think) or great (maybe to some) barleywine. Either way, there isn't any wrong answer."
"D: This is a pretty damned nice beer. This beer is good or better in all categories. The smell and taste are all solid, and this beer truly shines in the feel department. For a barleywine, this is pretty drinkable for the style. I have noticed that this one went down much easier and quicker than previous barleywines I have had. DUCK RABBIT RULES!!!"
"D - While it is a good beer, one could only have one to two during a session due to its high alcohol content."
"This beer poured a stunning clear deep copper with 3 inch fluffy tan head. It has a sweet aroma of candied cherries, plums and dates that have been beaten with a mallet and allowed to soak in alcohol. I also get a note of sweet caramel. The first impression of the flavor is that it tastes like an English style barleywine. There's a medley of fruit such as dark dark cherries, sweet black grape juice, dates, raisins and cranberries. I also get a cherry cough drop quality."
"D - A decent enough beer but I was hoping for something a little bolder. Were the alcohol tamed down a bit I think this brew would really shine. Big blatant alcohol detracts."
"Was definitely expecting more from this rather local barleywine...overall, i wish the taste matched the pour..."
"I really enjoyed this barleywine, even more so than a year aged bigfoot. It was very smooth and pretty tasty, although being from down east I may be a little biased. I think this is one of my favorite barleywines so far...and very drinkable."
"Overall I was impressed with how good this was fresh. The older version was certainly more balanced, but the flavors in the fresh bottle were still impressive. Worth a shot."
"Over all a great brew. Only downside could be carbonation level. As far as an English BW, this is an excellent example. Would def have again."
"The aroma is full of caramel, syrup, fruit, grain husks, and hops. The appearance is mahogany with a super thin head. The flavor is like the aroma with some muskiness and soapiness. The palate is typical for the style. Overall its better than average but that's all."
"Very good - surprising. Nice pour, nice head and amber straw color. Not a ton of aroma, but sweet and thick. Taste is very good. I never would've guessed that it was 11% alcohol. Very, very smooth and sweet. Nothing too bitter or burnt - it may have been better with those qualities, but it was good. Feel is great - good carbonation and it goes down smooth and silky. I'd drink several of these easily, and with this alcohol content I'd certainly feel great afterward. I'm going to try to get some more of this for sure."
"SIDE NOTE: I was informed at the brewery that between the 2006 and 2007 season, the recipe for the barleywine changed. The 2006 was UBER-sweet. The 2007 (aged one year) was balanced, and the 2008 was very hoppy. If you are a hop worshipper, then you might really like this barleywine. Otherwise, you're going to want to set this aside for a year."
"6/4/5/3/12 (3.0/5)"
"Lovely red-bronze colour with a beige coloured head. Smell is terrific. Very sweet and malty; actually reminds me of breakfast cereal like sugar smacks or something. I like my barleywine to be bereft of any hop bitterness whatsoever, and this one, I'm afraid, wraps up its sweet malty opening with a little bit of a bitter hoppy finish. Still good, though. Mouthfeel is pretty heavy, as it should be, and the 11% is disguised well. A good attempt by an American brewery to replicate one of my favourite English styles."
"Too bad; maybe a bad bottle? The run-up to the actual tasting was great, but ultimately this beer doesn't hold up it's end of the bargain."
"D- easy to finish, this is one of the better english barleywines that ive tried. the booze is somewhat present, but i could see it sneaking up on you if you have a couple. 3 bottles split between 2 people would be perfect."
"Even though I am not big on darker beers I thuroughly enjoyed this, I have had other English Barleywine selections and wanted to give the local guys a whirl. I tried this for the first time at the Greensboro Brewfest a few months back and picked up a few bottles at the local shop a few weeks ago. I want to try other offerings from them, in my quest to support local flavor, and if this is any indication of the quality of their other stuff I can't wait."
"D- Very drinkable. I would love to see how this is fresh and compare what these two years have done to this in retrospect. But this 06 bottle is drinking very well!"
"Bottom line: I think this is a great representation of the English Barleywine Style Ale where Malt is King and the hops are only used to balance things out. I thoroughly enjoyed it."
"The body is moderate to big. So sure this is a year old, but it actually is pretty tasty. I would have liked a bit more complexity in the malt but overall good."
"D: Nothing short of great. The most complex barleywine Ive had in a while, not necessarily the single best but like a rubix cube of flavors. The alcohol brings down drinkability some. Not hot, just powerful. Very powerful. Get your hands on this beer."
"I've had this brew before while within its ""best by"" range, and I can honestly profess that there isn't much difference. It's good either way!"
"D - A very good winter beer, warming and sweet. High alcohol presence is noticeable, but not detracting."
"Flavor is sweet malt up front, with a bitter follow that brings to mind cherries and dark chocolate. Then Mr. Alcohol introduces himself with an authoritative but not overbearing presence. Warmly welcoming. This stuff is perfect for a winter nightcap, but by no means out of place on a warm fall evening."
"Looks nice. Hazy, gold/brown with red tinges. Small sand-colored head and solid lacing. Smell is quite sweet. Heavy honey, sugarplums, molasses. Taste is deep roasted malts balanced with dark fruits, and an alcohol finish. Doesn't have the sourness or bitterness found in many barleywines. On warming, alcohol becomes more apparent, and fits the beer well. Mouthfeel is pretty good, feels like a barleywine."
"Drinkability: What a great beer. One of the few Duck Rabbits I haven't tried, and it's a shame I hadn't before now. This is a complex, balanced, interesting, fruity barleywine, and another very impressive offering from what is, in my opinion, the best brewery in North Carolina (and that's saying a lot). Recommended, along with all their other offerings!"
"D- Really easy to drink. Went down way to fast. Highly recommended on this one."
"Nice beer, not really necessarily spot on for the style, but interesting."
"Medium bodied with good carbonation. Feels heavy on the stomach. Bitter and slightly burning aftertaste. It will be interesting to see this one change over time. Right now, though, due to the bitterness and the abv, one is enough. This is a tasty sipper, so don't get me wrong."
"This beer is pretty good, but I don't love it. It's too bitter. A sipper for sure, and worth a try."
"I could not even drink four ounces of this stuff and I moved on to another beer shortly after, my dad did not even want it when I gave it to him, worst I have had from Duck Rabbit, will not drink this again, not recommended"
"Pours a dark ruby red/purple with 1 finger of creamy khaki colored head into a snifter. Good retention and nice lacing rings. Smells of caramel, toffee, dark fruits, bread malt, floral hops, and booze. Tastes of hops up front then sweet malt, caramel, and toffee with a finish of raisins, cherries, grapes, and figs and a hammering punch of alcohol. Medium in body with good carbonation. Nice and sticky with a dry bitterness in the finish mixed with booze. Mostly sweet but the hops do show up. A good barleywine with some English styling."
"Poured a deep orange color with a small head. Nose was of hops, citrus fruit,dried fruit and caramelly malts. Taste was malty,some fruits present and small hop dash.Hops were much more noticeable in the nose than in the taste as the bitterness was quite low. Mouthfeel was medium and left a syrupy feeling in the back of the throat. This beer could materialize if aged but still a good bwine."
"After a few oz.s definite alcohol warmth in chest, mellowed by the maltiness. hops are present throughout as an underlying note. Malts become very strong by bottom of the glass."
"I loved this beer from when I first smelled it. I had another barley wine that was of the American variety, but it had way too much hops for me, and I didn't like the way the flavors went together. This was way better, and I thought it was more balanced. I wish I knew how old exactly this beer is, it only has 12/08 notched on the bottle. It is supposed to be released in winter time, so this beer might be a bit different from when it is fresh."
"The first barleywine I ever had was English-style, and despite having really developed a love for extreme American styles since then, I really enjoy this. Is is smooth and not at all difficult to drink, warming but not biting. Not an everyday beer, but one I could happily drink often if it was available locally."
"This is my second sampling of the D-R barleywine and I am a bit more pleased this time around. Not the best English-style, in fact I would have to argue that it tastes a lot more like an American barleywine with the sort of hop profile it has, but an enjoyable version that caps off a night perfectly."
"D = Good drinkability, definitely a barleywine worth drinking."
"D: Sweet and hoppy. This would make a great after dinner drink. Will be interesting to try after it has some age."
"Courtesy of gford217: Poured a medium color ale with a nice light brown foamy head with good retention and good lacing. Aroma of sweet barley malt is pleasant. Taste is a mix between some sweet malt with light dry fruits notes. Great carbonation with an average full body and no apparent alcohol. Hops presence is quite low but I didn't mind since I prefer English style barleywine usually. Not the most complex offering but still very enjoyable."
"easy to drink, although it is a sipper."
"Overall: Well-rounded for sure. This is one to cellar in bulk! Drinking this makes me long for winter -- seated in front of a roaring fire with my D-R Barleywine in one hand and a nice cavendish pipe in the other. Wearing a wool waistcoat, to be sure."
"drinkability is great. excellent balance. nice depth. i can't get enough of the malt in this one. this is a beer that i could get into trouble with - great balance hiding the alcohol well, and so good you just want to pour another as soon as the bottle is done. thanks again dan!"
"Packaging - A classy label that Hints at the complexity and robustness of the beer. The label deserves a second look from anyone who doesn't immediately get the duck-rabbit. As should this beer."
"D: This is a decent English Barleywine, though I would definitely term it a sipper."
"Drinkability: Nice barleywine. High ABV may limit what you can drink, as may the heaviness. Good beer and nice example of the style."
"Drinkability: In all honesty, I've had better and worse bottles of Duck-Rabbit Barleywine. This one was pretty decent. Overall, I've found the majority of them to be kicked up with sweetness and just a bit thin (for me) in the body department."
"D: Pretty easy to drink for an 11% BW. A good night cap."
"Pours a hazy dark red, some orange highlights, thin light brown head forms, settles to a thin ring and a layer, few lace spots on the glass. Smell is nice, very rich, toffee, sweet sugary goodness, alcohol, sherry, almost wine like, bread, bit of toast, pretty neat. Taste is super sweet and bready, caramel, wine, brandy, alcohol, toast, very sweet middle and finish, iron, sherry in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation, very warm, but pretty drinkable. Different kind of barleywine, but interesting. Thanks Dan!"
"I was impressed by this - quite well balanced and drinkable for a barleywine, with good flavor."
"Ruby brown body with a khaki-colored creamy head. Leaves decent, but sporadic lacing all the way down. Smells of rich bready malts with faint fruitiness that is swept away by an aggressive hop aroma. Some alcohol picked up. Tastes is rich maltiness balanced by a strong bittering hop profile that is reminiscent of the west coast barleywine style. Outrageously drinkable for an 11% ABV. Alcohol is never dominant, hidden within the polar balance of rich malts and heavy hops. A true hopheads barleywine. This is my favorite way to enjoy barleywines...young but balanced."
"Duck-Rabbit deserves some slack since most of their lineup is solid, if unspectacular. Porter and Wee Heavy Scotch Style Ale are the best so far, with only Rabid Duck Russian Imperial Stout to go. I wish the brewers much better luck with the second batch of Barleywine Ale."
"D - a little too sweet for me, one and done."
"Appearance, pours out from the 12 oz. bottle into my Gulden Draak chalice. Fine stream of beige leather bubbles cascade through the deep Sangria like blood orange body, murky with yeast particles suspended bringing out quite the colloid. Head forms thick and stands up with resilience, lacing is fine even and intricate what a beautiful glass of barleywine lies in front of me. Aromatics deliver with deep over ripened raisin and plums reduced and caramelized in brandy, touch of pear drizzled with light syrup. All that malt is balanced with pine cone and herbal minty fresh hop doses, also alcohol is also evident with vapors tickling the nose and an earthy wood like accent finishes the party. Flavors flood well together drinking sweet right now but guaranteed not to be too cloying upfront sweet citric, caramel richness barrages my senses. Slightly burnt brown sugar really coats the palate, with alcohol soothing the back of the throat like a mild anesthetic. Bitterness streaks through with piney, citrus peel, and herbal mint qualities really impressive flow going on this is real barleywine. Alcohol is evident but maybe I have a high threshold I'm not tasting 11%, that's a good thing no instant headaches here or fusel alcohol, ethanol is just another well coordinated aspect of the brew. Mouthfeel is soothing with residual sugars coating the palate on each sip strong even bitterness is left on the palate carbonation is ample but not overdone body is medium to full in the spectrum of things. Overall drinkability is really great, I like this barleywine from the front to the back in every way a great beer I find it more impressive than the Baltic Porter or standard Porter I've had from them. What an up and coming brewery thanks jcdiflorio for the opportunity to sample this one. I also agree that this beer will only get better with age if your able to hold on to one for that long, because it's drinking pretty good right now and that friggin' red eyed duck with the derby on won't stop staring at me when I open the fridge I had to sample this one."
"Thick and cloying with wine-like dryness. Was a bit rough to be real drinkable. Some aging would really do this beer some justice."
"M&D: Mouthfeel is rather heavy, which is to be expected and is well matched to the brew. However I found the strong alcohol taste a bit distracting. The carbonation is very light, but persistent. Although the taste on the front end of the drink is quite good, the alcohol linger is distracting to me. I enjoyed the drink, but don't know if I would want to drink more than one at a time."
"Thick, syrupy mouthfeel. Coats the entire mouth in that sticky bittersweetness. Drinkability suffers a bit from the boisterous levels of alcohol, but this is still an excellent sipper."
"Drinkability: Decent drinkability. The eleven percent ABV and huge sweetness knock it down a few points. A sipper in my opinion. A pretty good beer overall."
"Overall, not one of my favorite barleywines when young. I think I'll lay down a couple and see how they taste in 6-12 months. There seems to be good potential for aging in this beer."
"Definitely better as the beer warms, this is a fine sipping beer. Not one I could drink all night because of the potency but a nice one to try from time to time."
"D: This one is a huge barley wine that I have been enjoying for over an hour just sipping and enjoying the flavors get even more pronounced as it warms. No more than one at a time for me please, but a definite one to recommend to others for a taste treat."
"Glad to have Duck-Rabbit down the road in Farmville!"
"D: The high abv and intense sweetness is limiting me to one glass. This is not the best that Duck Rabbit has taken to market."
"Poured a clear ruby red with little to no head but a nice ring stuck around. Smelled of sweet malts with a hint of hops and some alcohol. There was a very sweet malt taste and what seems like pure sugar. There is a lot of hot alcohol which detracts from the sweetness and some sour hops in the finish. The mouthfeel was oily and the alcohol burned down the gullet. This one didn't impress me but I would like to see what it would be like after sitting for awhile downstairs."
"Overall- As BW's go, this one is just OK. I have had better from other US breweries, but it is not bad. I think a few years in the cellar and it will be where it needs to be for sure."
"Drinks good, between the boozeyness & the dryness, slows you down a bit. This BW has some American traits that detract a little, but this will only improve with age"
"Cheers."
"D - Pretty darn drinkable, particularly for something this potent. This is a darn good barleywine. I think I would classify this as a in between American and English Barleywine. Great seasonal release from Duck Rabbit who is now in Georgia!"
"This new arrival in Georgia was picked up at Green's on Buford Highway today. As I poured the beer into an over sized wine glass, I was surprised at the level of carbonation and head retention in this 11% ABV brew. The body was burnished copper in color, and clear. The aforementioned head was a good three fingers thick, and was creamy enough to form a volcano cone above the rim of the glass. The smell was soft caramel dipped fruit. The spicy hops were also quite strongly evident in the smell. The taste was wondrously earthy sour, and my fears of confronting any cloying sweetness dissolved away as the warmth of the alcohol seared down my throat. The dryness was like sipping on some fine sherry. There were some lingering dry fruits in the finish. The body felt a little small, but it made this fine beer all the more drinkable. All of the ingredients felt a little bit disjointed at this young age, but I can clearly see the greatness this beer will achieve with a few years of aging. Welcome to our state Duck-Rabbit."
"D - incredible! My notes from the pub say ""should be illegal!"" and that's probably about right. Duck Rabbit can do no wrong and I'm proud to have met the brewers tonight!"
"d: Thanks to barleywinebrewer for the chance to try this tasty barleywine."
"drinkability - Nice beer, I'm glad i tried this, since I hear a lot about Duck Rabbit. Hope to try them all from this company."
"Mouthfeel is thick and syrupy with a bland finish. Overall this one leaves me wanting more. The flavors are one dimensional and I still can't get past the overcarbonation that makes it impossible to pour."
"Sweet ass caramel malty barley wine brew. Even a pop of RIS dark fruit in the background. Sticky in the throat, must be 1/8 inch thick malt paint in there. Of course, NO hint of a wallop packing 11%. Drinks Way to easy, a hammer wolf in session lambs clothes."
"Sticky and sweet with a lot of fruit going on. Medium to full body. Once the carbonation settled down, things seemed to be ok. Very complex."
"D: The amount of carbonation is kind of annoying but this is a very drinkable beer beyond that."
"Pours a rusty amber in color, a slight haze but mainly clear, a good sized buttery cream head very slowy recedes lacing as it does. Nice sugary sweet aroma with strong citrus notes, like citrus candy, caramel and breadiness and alcohol in the aroma as well. Taste is very similar with a major dose of sugary caramel maltiness and strong citrus flavor. Mouthfeel is soft and creamy, yet big and thick and sugary chewiness, cut in the finish with some alcohol heat. alcohol is very well balanced in all aspects for its size. Unique and tasty beer, some barleywine characteristics but for me more like an very large imperial red or malty strong ale. Either way, a very good sipper, love to see what some age will do."
"It was an enjoyable beer but its very high ABV and sweetness leaves this beer only decently drinkable. That having been said, I still applaud the take on the style and the attempt by DR; still an excellent local NC brewery."
"Very nice, somewhat pale ruby color with a decent head on top. Fruity and toffeeish aroma. Great malty flavor with a nice flavor of dried fruits and rasiens. This has English barleywine all over it for sure. Slight bitterness to it but balanced against a considerable amount of sweetness. I was expecting a slight alcohol harshness for 11% but none here. Great body for the style. Not overly syrupy. Simply a great example. Quite the sipper for sure. Best US version of an English Barleywine I have had."
"This is certainly not a bad beer, but it just seems a bit weird to my taste buds. It definitely hides the 11% alcohol quite well."
"Duck-Rabbit's barleywine pours a clear, ruby-accented dark chestnut body beneath a short head of creamy tan foam. The rich aroma rises up at you: malty, fruity, hoppy - it's English in nature, but with more fruitiness than you'd normally expect. The head drops steadily to an average collar, but walls of spotty lace are left behind - it's kind of nice... almost like polka dots. The flavor bears out what the nose suggests, and it's malty with a healthy cereal characteristic and lots of sweetish caramelized sugar. There's a touch of toffee and nuttiness to it as well; and the yeast has left a small puddle of reddish fruit juice and lots of dark-skinned fruit as its calling card. The alcohol is kept in check, but it helps to dry things along with a very moderate astringency and solid bitterness. It finishes dry and a bit spicy and earthy or mineralish with a combination of lingering hops (leafy, grassy, floral) and dark skinned fruit. It's well-balanced, well rounded, and well polished, yet all of its components remain able to shine on their own. Very nicely done!!! Certainly worth trying."
"I'm a big fan of the other Duck Rabbit big beers, so I was really looking forward to trying this one. Unfortunately, this beer is out of whack and in my opinion not at all in the same caliber as their other beers. Next time I'll try it again from the bottle and let it age some and see if it improves. Pours dark amber with a big head that lasts surprisingly long given the high abv. The smell is surprisingly light and has a vegetal note to it, (tomato?) that is a little offputting. The taste has more tomato and on top of that is way too sweet. Strong, alcoholic sugar water with a tomato tinge? No thanks! The flavor is just bizarre. I would put this down to the keg being off if it hadn't been served to me by the brewery at the Hickory Hops fest. The mouthfeel is creamy, but also a little too slick. This one is not utterly bad, but its got some flavors going on that I just don't find that palatable. I'm not sure what went wrong here, but I think this beer probably doesn't belong on draft."
"D- Its just not my kind of flavors. Really strange blend of flavors. Looks good though!"
"This is a great beer right now, unlike last year's beer which needed six months or so to mature. It comes very close to being an American barleywine instead of an English one."
"Well I like this beer. Mouthfeel may be bigger and bolder than anything I remember trying. Just a huge round chewy monster of a barley wine somewhat discombobulated with complex flavors lingering on every tastebud of my tongue. First and foremost are a huge thick syrupy caramel, toffee malt. Slight milk chocolate with a fig reduction sauce type flavor. Alcohol plays a large role but doesn't interfere with anything, a nice burn in the chest. White raisin, and maple syrup help round things out with the slightest bit of vanilla bean on the long finish. Such a big beer this is a hard drink but I love the style and could drink a few before passing out."
"Crystal clear burnt orange topped by a generous beige head. Good retention and nice lacing, especially given the gravity. Looks pretty viscous, bubbles rise very slowly through the beer. Citrusy aroma, some tangerine, a little fruity, slight banana, caramel, light alcohol. Very sweet, lots of residual sugar makes this pretty thick. Alcohol is well controlled, bitterness is very restrained. Orange hop flavour throughout, with pine resin backing this up. Malt is a little crackery. Fairly low carbonation, sticky, some warmth. This is a really strange barleywine. It doesn't quite fit my expectations for the style, but it's pretty good and is an easy drinker."
"Poured into a chalice a deep dark clean/clear reddish color, nice carbonation, huge creamy tannish head, tons of sticky lacing afterwards. The nose is of malts, cherries, a tangyness, some caramel. The taste is sweet, slightly tangy, a good dose of cherries, some caramel. The finish is slightly dry. The alcohol is hidden very well. Medium body. Very drinkable, I really like this one, very different from an american barleywine, there's a nice sweetness to it, dark fruits, very enjoyable. Highly recommended."
"Drinkability - I experienced an immediate warmth from the 11% ABV, but it wasn't distracting. An interesting combination. I'd like to know more about what's going on. Complex, but not compelling."
"EDIT: After reading another review I agree. The smell and taste is somewhat of overcooked vegetables. Not pleasant at all."
" Drinkability - an easy to drink brew, nothing to complex, lots of alcohol but fairly well hidden."
"Firey orange color. Big head. The nose doesnt offer anything of distinction...just a very light smell. Flavor brings some super sweet malt and some unusual fruit flavors. Some nice elements in the flavor, such as the caramel-like finish, but for the most part this is weird and below average."
"Not even close to disappointing or unsatisfying, but it does lack some balance, and maybe it's still too young. It's sweet, that's for sure. Should be interesting to see what more age does to this...and as a self-proclaimed ""dark beer specialist"" with a great track record, I bet Duck-Rabbit will only improve on this initial recipe."
"Poured into my trusty Red Oak nonic a deep auburn with a tight formed 2 finger of white head that left spotty lacing as it settled slowly.Brown sugar and almost cinnamon-like spice hit upfront in the nose also quite floral with hints of minty leaf hoppiness.A bit thinner than expected for such a big beer ,not big and chewey like I would have liked still not a major flaw,dark fruit and alcohol warnth standout after the first few sips along with some honey sweetness with decent herbal smack of hops showing thru late.I detected quite an alcohol zip thruout from beginning to end making it a one and done for me for sure still its got good flavors and well it should be a sipper anyways."
"12 oz bottle received in a trade with leftmindedrighty. The pour was red-brown with a very nice sized white head. The smell was dark fruits and alcohol. The taste was the same with an added medicinal quality as well as cherry cough syrup. I was really let down by this as I have loved DR's porter and baltic. Oh well, it was worth a try."
"Poured golden-yellow-red...almost brown, from a 12oz bottle. Almost no head, slight floral smell. Tasted slightly bitter with obvious high alcohol content. Virtually no lacing. Not the most drinkable beer but I like the kick. If this is your session beeryou are an alcoholic."
"This is definately an enjoyable barleywine. Not all malt like a lot of English Barleywines but the dark fruits and maltiness do dominate. Nice mild hop finish. Quality brew from Duck-Rabbit. This is my first bottle from them and I'm looking forward to trying some others."
"It's good, but honestly, I find myself a bit underwhelmed...will sit on the other to see if this one mellows a bit."
"Pours a clear golden amber with a head that is quick to disappear. No lacing. Smells super sweet, no hops apparent. Taste is super sweet, dark fruits, prunes, raisins, caramel, with slightly fizzy, super tiny bubbled carbonation. Very true to the style, hops are almost non-existent and malts dominate. Very smooth and drinkable. Well done example of the style."
"Deep, round flavor with a very sweet finish and enough fruit flavor to somewhat coat the intense alcohol. Mouthfeel is velvety smooth and thick with just enough carbonation to keep it from turning to a solid. Some balance but could stand a bit more hop. I suspect this would age well as it has old ale characteristics. This is another fine example of the style and another brilliant effort from DR."
"Vigorous pour yields a quickly diminishing head. Some nice laceing. Clear mahogony color. Typical Barleywine smell, I detect some carmel apple and malt, Sweet malt taste hits the palete first followed by citrus hops and warming from the alcohol. I really enjoy barleywines don't find them that complex but great for sipping and relaxing. Another winner from Duck Rabbit."
"The Duck-Rabbit Barleywine pours from the 12oz bottle into my snifter a dark amber color with a head like cappuccino foam that is just off white. This head refuses to dissipate as it laces down the side of the glass while the beer slowly disappears down my throat. The aroma is dominated by sweetness with a strong presence of toasted malts. This is complemented by the alcohol, some dark fruits and a vinous bouquet. The taste is up front with sweetness, similar to the smell. This is chased by some bitterness without a strong hop presence. There is also a bit of a dark fruitiness in there that is akin to the type found in a Belgium beer, without all of the wheat and yeast of course. The beer has a slightly fuller than medium body with an expected low carbonation due to the alcohol. There is also a bit of dryness on the finish. Overall, the Duck-Rabbit Barleywine is a decent, but certainly falls more along the lines of an English barley wine, without the strong hop presence that consumers have come accustomed to in their American counterparts. Its a nice warming barley wine, but the strong sweetness will keep you from reaching for it night after night, even when the thermometer drops below freezing."
"This is by far one of the stranger feeling beers I've had in a while; the carbonation and the thick texture combine to form almost a cotton-y mouthfeel. It's not unpleasant per se, but it is a little odd. Still, I really like the taste of this barleywine and I hardly detect the formidable ABV. This is an absolute keeper."
"Not a bad barley wine. Pretty interesting but could use a little more balance."
"Taste: Sweet, piney hops, orange. Kind of tart. Alcohol wasnt that noticeable so very smooth. I like the extra hoppiness in this. Good mouthfeel. A little sweet but well within paramaters for the style. A good solid choice."
"Thanks a lot for this one mikegroove!"
"M&D - slick mouthcoat that soothes and warms on the way down, a highly dichotomous beer, warming/soothing, bitter/sweet, its wonderfully balanced and blended, a great barleywine, a nice way to start enjoying a breweries beers, the high ABV darws the drinkability down a bit, but thats it"
"Drinkability: This is tasty beer. Only downside is that it's 11% abv - which I didn't realize when I opened it, whoops!"
"Poured a dark amber-ruby with a large head and plenty of sticky retention. Very nice nose with citrusy fruits as well as more smooth, less pungent fruits. A nice smoky apple on the front. A damn smooth taste with well-hidden alcohol and warm, spicy undertones. A smoky cinnamon apple flavor with a dark, ever so slightly bitter aftertase. Very enjoyable. A chewy mouthfeel initially that becomes smooth and light on the finish. Very drinkable, especially for the style. Very impressive."
"I have to admit, I have only recently gained an appreciation for barley wines. This is one of the first that I really enjoyed. Last year, when I tried several barley wines such as SN Bigfoot and Anchor Old Foghorn, I could barely finish a glass as the taste would diminish with each passing sip. That was not the case with this! Maybe it's just my growingly intelligent palate, but I found so much complexity to this beer. The alcohol is well hidden, yet still has great warming effect that is perfect on a cold January night. The subtle hops provide a great accent to the subtle fruitiness. I will be putting away and entire six pack and look forward to seeing how well this beer ages."
"drinkability: eh"
"Taste is definately not my favorite style...caramel and tobacco...hard to put a real finger on. It's complex, but really just mediocre in its flavor. Mouthfeel is light and crisp up front but kind of lacks a strong finish...is my mouth warming as I take a gulp? weird. Drinkability is okay, I can drink this for a while, surprisingly. Goes great with meat & cheese."
"Difficult to classify as American or English, but a prime example why Duck-Rabbit has emerged as one of the premier craft breweries in the Southern United States. Very well done!"
"Overall I wouldn't consider this to be very true to the style, but it's still a good barleywine."
"Drinkability is ok, not something I would run out and buy more of until I find out how it ages."
"This is certainly an interesting and different barleywine. Very potent to say the least, but it needs a lot more malt, which comes as a shock to me seeing as Duck Rabbit usually puts out some supremely malty beers. If they tweak it just a little bit, this has the potential to be fantastic."
"Definately not an American Barleywine, but not really an English one either."
"Poured a deep ruby red with a small head that faded to a long lasting lace down the glass. Smells very sweet, with a hint of citrus. The taste is very rich, this seems odd, but almost tastes like a toffee or candy flavors. Very intresting flavor, I have never tasted this in a beer before. Very nice feel going down, not too thick and just the right carbonation. This is an odd one. I can't really describe the taste, but I cannot put it down either. Gonna have to come back to this, but overall this was definatly good."
"Body is a bit lacking. It tastes big, but doesn't feel so. I need a little more body in my big ales. Inspite of this slight shortcoming, this is a very tastey BW that will make an interesting cellaring candidate."
"12oz brown bottle with a best before date of 12/07. Pours a medium amber with a 1 finger head with nice longevity and very nice lace. Not you typical barleywine smells. Mostly a fresh hop presence with a fruity sourness mixed in. Very unique as barlywines go. Very fruity and has a nice hop flavor with mild bitterness. Caramel, brown sugar and slight pine notes as well. Alcohol is well hidden especially at 11%. A different but tasty beer. Give it a try."
"I'd prefer a bit stronger malt profile. I think this may cellar well but hard to say. That said I'd easily put a few in the cellar for a tasting every 6-12 months to see how it matures."
"Overall, I'm disappointed in this brew. Compared to some of the classic barleywines, this one seems out of balance and rough. Perhaps some aging will help. I guess I'll find out, as I have 5 other bottles to stash away in the fridge."
"Flavor is quite nice. Never one of my favorite styles because I usually find the hops under-reaching or the malts a bit over the top. Here though the malts are sweet to the point of being tart but then quickly rounded off with a citrusy, candy hops. The hops remind me of another beer. I cannot recall which one but I was to say it is from Victory. I will have to look around a bit. Alcohol is camoflaged nicely behind the flavors. Full body that raps around the mouth just a bit too much. Can really enjoy this beer."
"12 ounce bottle."
"Poured an attractive orange amber color with a massive head. I didn't expect such a large head for a beer of this strength. Aroma was of leafy hops, citrus fruit and caramelly malts. Taste was malty sweet with notes of toffee, cherry and some winelike notes. The beer became more winey as it warmed. Hops were much more noticeable in the aroma than in the taste as the bitterness was quite low. Mouthfeel was medium and left a syrupy feeling in the back of the throat. Alcohol was well hidden, but this beer could definitely benefit from some time in the cellar as it seemed a little bland to me. This is my first disappointment from Duck Rabbit."
"Not up to par with the other Duck-Rabbit seasonal releases. Might need to revisit and revise later. (resampled on Dec. 21)"
"Nice body here as well. Full bodied with nice carbonation."
