"Nice oaky buttery smell. Taste complex With the bourbon up front and a beautiful Carmel finish"

""

""
""
"Really tasty, surprisingly nice. Drank our of a goblet shared 1/2 of 22oz bottle"
""
"As it warms, A hint of vanilla and oak shine. I can only assume this is the bourbon barrels. As a normal barleywine doesn't have this level of complexity. This is by a long shot, one of the best barleywines I've ever had. Thanks FW crew!"
""
""
""
"Too strong for my liking"
"o: my impression is that drinking this fresh (as i am) i can tell this beer is extremely well-made, and on its own its really good.  very nice base flavors in here that are harmonized well.  also the fact that this is 13.3% and drinks as well is it does is super-impressive.  well done.  i would definitely recommend getting one and sitting on it for at least 1 year.  if allowed to blend in the bottle further, this will be something extremely special"
""

""

"Mediocre at best. Just seemed to lack the big barleywine flavor"

"Not a fan of Barleywines, so rating is biased"

"Draft.  Really disappointed.  Poured a light opaque brown with head that dissipated very quickly.  Little lacing.  Smells of coconut, vanilla, dried fruit, caramelized sugars, malts and a few other things I couldn't identify.  Tasted thin in the mouth like most barley wines.  Flavors are as above but it didn't knock my socks off.  Over hyped before drinking maybe?  After taste is vanilla, dried fruit and Barley.  Good but not out of this world good."
""
"Easily the best barleywine I've ever had.  Can't imagine a better one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A remarkable Barleywine. Great color, aroman, and flavor. Head dissipates quickly, no lingering foam. Flavour follows the wonderful aroma. Hints of honey, Madeira, whiskey, and toffee. Sweet, malty, and smooth. Enjoyed the 2013."
""
""
"Murky mohagoney beer with a thin head. Boozy sweet, mint leaves, pear, green apple, molasses."
""
"I stopped by a neighborhood friend's house today to drop off some Ballast Point Sculpin Grapefruit (would recommend this brand also) and boy did he treat me to Sucaba!  The bottle looks really neat and the barley wine inside was yummy!  Smooth, great scent and wonderful taste!  I am very appreciative to have been treated to such a top-notch beer!!"

"On tap at Beer Authority 2/25/15."
""
"On draft at Simzy’s LB poured into tulip. Nearly opaque chocolate brown with a tan ring that revives with a swirl of the glass. Aroma is of coconut, dried fruit, bourbon, caramel, brown sugar, and vanilla. Taste is outstanding with strong fruit and caramel sweetness and mild barrel wood bitterness. Full body, silky texture, surprisingly moderate carbonation, and a sweet boozy finish. Excellent!"

"The cherry with a touch of vanilla is what stands out for me."
""
""
""
""

"Strong alcohol, almost a Chambord taste. There's a slightly burnt flavor to the swallow. Rich body with a diminished carbonation. Think brandy with carbonation."
""
""
""
"Can't wait for the next one"
""
"This we ok after reading the reviews and the bottle I was expecting a little more. Overall a good tasting beer started and finished well I just didn't like the feel"

""
"O: What more to say about Firestones barrel program? Masterful. My favorite BBA Barleywine behind Great."
""
""
""
"Overall, this beer certainly lives up to the hype.  Even after a solid two to three years maturing in our cellar, this 2012 stock retains its intense buttery woodiness, dense caramel sugariness, and warming bourbon booziness.  Aside from these obvious necessities, you get ever shade of complexity to fill in the gaps across the nose and palate.  Although we don’t have a great base of comparison, if seems that nothing has faded or taken to the top.  The balance remains supreme.  We tackled this as part of our recent “Whale Hunt”.  Our cellar space is being dramatically reduced in the upcoming months, so we’re systematically going through the “drink now” beers we’ve been aging.  This beer, more or less, is helping to kick that off.  In this vein, it was nice reading about the history of this beer.  It seems that this was one of, if not the, genesis beer of their “Reserve Series”, and it fits so well.  We’ve obviously not sampled them according to their order of release, but it meets that same quality of barrel-aged wonder that the rest of them have attained.  §ucaba is a phenomenal beer, and something every true BeerAdvocate should seek out for reference point and blissful enjoyment."

"One of the best Barleywines I've ever tasted. Smell of toasted coconut, caramel, cherry, vanilla and bourbon. Taste: Brown sugar, vanilla, roasted coconut, light chocolate and coffee tones. No alcohol detected, really drinkable.  Amazing beer."
""
""
""
"Overall:  I this this is a wonderful beer, but it's booziness is just a little too much for me.  Perhaps I will buy another of these and cellar it for a year to see if that edge wears down a little."
""
""
""
"Look: is a light orange cola color. smell:  Orange, molasses,  tons of vanilla, soy sauce , Marzipan Taste: sweet, caramel, brown sugar, a mild hop bitterness it is ever so mild, it balances the sweetness and richness. Little bit of oak tannin. Nice and smooth low to medium body big alcohol but not  overwhelming. It is the best barleywine I have ever had. So good. If you don't like barley wine this is the barley wine for you."
""
""
""
""
""
"First try of a fresh batch and it delivered! Damn just really nice. Started a bit carbed, and too cold (my fault) but as it warmed some the flavor came out perfectly. I have a few of precious years stashed away - they may be coming out sooner than I had planned! Amazing smell outta the bottle, mmm, like boozy candy. Beautiful color in the glass. Amazing stuff.  Get some if you can."

"Fairly boozy, but very complex. Would love to procure one to age. Definitely a sipper."

""
""
"One of my favorite barleywines. Smells of cherries, pipe tobacco, leather, burnt toffee, wood. Tastes of vanilla, tobacco, caramel, slight cherry, coconut, alcohol sweetness. Smooth, delicious."
""
"I thought this beer was pretty good."
""
""
""
"It pours a thick, auburn color with a very thin mocha colored head. The smell is amazing. I get heavy almond upfront followed by toffee, coconut, vanilla, mild earthy hops with just a hint of alcohol. The flavor follows the nose pretty closely with a bigger emphasis on the toffee caramel flavors. There is a bit of booziness, but it is quite welcoming and subtle. This is interesting because it is the first time that I've had a bourbon barrel aged beer where the booze melds with the beer so perfectly that it's hard to tell where one ends and the other begins."
""
""
"Overall: Noticeably sweet with overtones of coconut, bourbon and oak. Big complexity. Absolutely delicious."

"2014 vintage, bomber into a snifter at cellar temp. Still a fair amount of alcohol heat, but the big surprise was the relative dominance of bitter flavors over sweet. All the standard FW flavors are there, though oak and toffee are at the fore. Very nice mouthfeel. Doesn't strike me as obviously better than fresh, though the barrel influence may have mellowed a bit."
""
""

"Perfect mouth feel."

"A finger's of tightly packed crisp rich velvety light khaki colored head...  Limited retention gives way to an ultra inviting full perfectly uniform veil of lacing which ultimately turns a bit splotchy with a small collar...  The color is a deep slightly brooding garnet...  A light to moderate bit of carbonation rises at a slightly sluggish pace towards the top of the glass...  The nose is deep, rich and inviting...  Loaded with warm bready malts...  Vanilla...  Brown sugar...  Light oak notes...  Fig...  Raisins...  Sweet plums...  Well rounded...  Deep and complex...  The palate is not nearly as deep nor complex...  It is loaded with oak and booze...  Both of which slightly overwhelm the barleywine beneath which I'm fairly certain is trying to shine...  Medium bodied...  Sturdy...  Light yet sharply carbonated...  A touch of lushness to start before a wave of dryness overcomes and lasts throughout...  An astringent booziness rises on the finish...  A solid English Barleywine (though if given a blind taste test I would have considered this either an American Barleywine or American Strong Ale)...  Given all the praise for this brew, I expected world class but this one falls a bit short...  Perhaps more time in the bottle would do this justice and the barrel aging seems to obscure the base brew...  As is, the end result is a bit less than the sum of its parts..."
""
""
""
""
""
"If you're looking for a really deep, bourbon like ale than Firestone Sucaba/Abacus would be a strong choice. If you're not a fan of strong alcoholic beverages that taste like bourbon and wood I'd stay away."
"First try not my favorite.  I would try it again."
""
""
""

"While I am not a huge barleywine fan, I do enjoy them from time to time and I can appreciate the style. This one is head and shoulders above the rest. Hell, it's head and shoulders above anything I've had."
"#2 2012 is tight and needs to be aged more."

"Overall: the bar was set extremely high here with the top ratings and being a staple of FW's barrel aging program. I think it met those expectations. Perhaps the most complex beer I've had. There's a significant amount of barrel influence in the nose and taste from bourbon, whiskey and oak. And there's a lot of sweetness along with a smoky tobacco flavor that I assume comes from the barrel aging. They all mesh together excellently. This is the top barley wine I've had. FW continues to astound with their skill."
""
"It was amazing when I got it and even better A year later."
"Not nearly as hot as it was when I bought it; wow, this beer tastes wonderful right now."

"I love barleywines. I've never had a bad beer from FW. I thoroughly enjoy BA beers, and bourbon in general. All of this comes together about as you'd expect: this is an amazing beer, and I will continue to pick a couple up each year. I suggest you do the same."

"Pours a dark amber color  with an off-white head.  Aroma of dark and dried fruits, alcohol, sherry.  Big raisin and dark fruit notes. Sight woody dryness and solid char. This is a big ale with noticeable alcohol. A hell of a beer."

""

"Brown, small head. Very sweet. Very intense. Lots of vanilla, sugar cane."

"Mouthfeel's good, certainly full bodied with a nice lingering flavor.  The carbonation is low, which works very well for it.  Fairly smooth when I expected it to be a little gritty.  Since it's so full flavored it starts of big and sweet, gets slightly bitter in the middle, then goes to a dry bitter finish like a red wine.  The one thing is it's a little hotter than I prefer, but gets much easier the more you drink.  Speaking of which, it's really drinkable.  Really good overall beer.  Firestone Walker really continually produces amazing products, and probably the best barrel aging program out there."

"O: Fantastic BA Barley Wine, The barrel is up front with tons of character from the bourbon left over. The alcohol is there, but not offensive or difficult to drink. This beer aged perfectly. I would like to try a fresh version to compare, but as it stands this was superb."

"I'm not much of a barley wine drinker. Sucaba definitely makes an exception. It has a strong nose on it, pour a nice dark color. Has a a strong flavor profile and still goes down smooth. It pours a dark color with a tan head that doesn't last long. It has aromas or fruits, malts, sweetness and alcohol of course. It has strong notes of spices, dates, figs, caramel, wood-aged. It is strong but is very smooth on the palate. This is my first one, 2014 edition and will be buying more of these in the future!!"

"2013 Vintage.  Poured into a snifter, the beer is a dark, cloudy, opaque, caramel-toffee coloring with a sparse coating of light tan head that recedes into a halo. Nose of rich caramel, molasses, apples, toffee, booze, roasted nuts, date and fig, wood spice, and earthy notes.  Some highlights of raw honey and sugar candy, too. Wow! Flavors of rich sweetness, layered indefinitely, with notes of caramel, honey, toffee, sugar candy, roasted notes, butterscotch, booze, and earthy highlights. Quickly warming in mouth, with a dose of hops bitterness to keep some semblance of balance. Heavy and big. The body is robust and smooth, with an underlying dryness. The aftertaste is almost like candy, with a heavy dose of old world fruit and booze. Tangy and richly sweet linger on a smooth, drawn out finish. Very solid brew."
""
""
"Overall: Not my favorite English Barleywine, but it was up there. Felt it could be a tad bit more sweet and intense in favor, but the aroma was spot on. I would be interested to see how more aging would affect this beer, but honestly, since it was more mellow than I expected, now was probably a better time to drink it. One of the few big ABV over 12oz bottles I would recommend not sharing. This beer has a extremely long development time, unless you drink it super slow you miss out on more than the usual brew."

"O - A great barrel-aged beer. Whereas most of the barrel-aged beers tend to taste more like bourbon, the English-inspired malts in this barleywine lend a more Scotch whiskey flavor. Worth checking out, even thought it is expensive."

"O - At first I was quite disappointed, however this beer definitely benefits from time spent in the glass. The most relatable beer I've had to Sucaba lately was Fremont's Bourbon Abominable, which for me, was clearly the superior beer. This was malty, sweet and sherry-like with nice tobacco notes, but I wanted more bourbon, coconut, vanilla, oak and spice. Sadly it did not live up to expectation."

"Pours a caramel color beer, dark. I don't remember any carbonation, maybe a light foam around the edges of the glass. I smelled some oak, some brandy, but all very faint, and the beer doesn't really lead you anywhere. Taste reveals a sweet barleywine, very light, not heady, not strong, but very tasty. Not many notes picked up. Body is medium, not a light bodied beer."

"A well-done take on the barley wine style. Rich, deeply complex flavors, and great sensory experiences with aroma and mouthfeel. This beer was tried two years+ after it's release date and seemed to age well, still packing plenty of punch and delivering exceptional flavors."

""

"Overall: ehhh. I think the bourbon English barley wine has a lot more potential. The bourbon seems to clash with the malts rather than adding to. I think it would be a little better with some age though"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- the longer I sip this beer, the more flavor and aromas come out, the complexity is unlike any other beer. It drinks pretty hot, but actually is needed for such a big beer. I can't wait to try one with some age on it to see how it changes"
""
""
""
""
""
"This is the gem that opened my eyes to barley wines. Why can't they all be this good. The chocolate, bourbon, and coconut notes are a real joy. 13% abc not a chance by the taste! but wow how good you feel once you polish that bottle off. Wish this was more readily available!!!"

"Some time ago I would have put barleywines at the bottom of my go-to list. I find beers like Bigfoot and Old Guardian somewhat of a chore to drink. Barrel-aging completely changed my opinion, and I look forward to Firestone's annual release of this incredible beverage."

"I had been looking for this beer for some time and was very happy to finally get ahold of a bottle. It lives up to the expectations. This is a lovely beer. The barrel effect is flavourful and adds a great deal, but does not overpower the base beer, which is terrific. Caramel, bread, bourbon, oak, vanilla and light fruits/berries. The flavour is big, but not the overpowering intensity that I expected - this is a good thing. It is remarkable how drinkable this beer is given its potency. First rate stuff - now I just have to try and find more. A lot more."

"Overall, it's yet another BA take on a style that I'm quickly falling in love with. Were it not for the unconventionally unique take on the style that GI released in 2013, this would be the benchmark. Heck, it probably still is, especially as they continue to release it every year when BCBW will likely be a one time thing. I will have to make a point of getting my hands on this as often as I can."

"Pours muddy and with no head. Looks still. Smell is dark fruit, vanilla, and soy sauce in a this Chinese restaurant uses way too much sauce, kind of way. Taste is sweet and dark fruits and soy sauce with a quick finish. At least the booze is hidden very well, but with the lack of almost any carbonation, cloying nature of it and the soy sauce flavor, it was a big disappointment."

"22 oz bottle, first time in a bottle after several times on tap. The pour is a dark brown, with a solid head at the beginning that fades pretty quickly. The smell is sweet caramel with light vanilla and oak. Surprisingly little alcohol for the ABV. The taste is similar, lots of caramel, minimal booze. I find this a lot less sweet than similar beers of this style (say Bourbon County Barleywine). This is really easy drinking due to the low sweetness and despite the ABV. Definitely my favorite barrel-aged barleywine."

"Firestone's Sucaba (Abacus) came in 6th in my recent beer tasting of Firestone Walker's top beers. Out of the seven BA guys we had at the tasting, Sucaba (Abacus) got and average review score of 4.00 for look, smell, taste, mouthfeel and overall. I was surprised by the low scores and thought it would have finished at least in 3rd place."

"O: Fantastic. The smell and flavor of this beer are still fresh in my mind after a week. I drank two bottles this year and am aging another two. I'm excited to see how a bit of age affects this masterpiece. I wasn't too interested in barleywines before I tried this, but they have my attention now. Thank you, Firestone Walker, for another amazing offering."

"I did want to say that as amazing as it is a beer less expensive still retains the top spot for me for English Barleywines. Our Finest Regards by Pretty Things Brewing while not barrel aged represents the top of this style for me to date."

"O: Not very complex, but what's there is quite tasty."
""
"Overall, this is an amazing beer. There's nothing else I can compare it to except Bourbon County Brand Barleywine. In a head-to-head, I think I'd choose this one right now. The BCBBW is so unbelievably rich, it's difficult to drink. This one is also rich and intensely flavored, but much more smooth, refined, and balanced. With a little age, BCBBW might be more like this one, but right now it is not and I have to give a tip of the cap to this beer; my own personal champion of English-style Barleywines."

"The beer pours some off-white head that dissipates very quickly but still leaves a ring around the inside of the glass. The beer itself is an opaque dark plum color. The beer has notes of very dark purple with black that strongly resemble plum. The smell is fairly complex with chocolate and caramel notes. Dark fruit smell that resembles plums with a bit of oak and a very concealed note of alcohol with a bit of barely smell. The strong notes are definitely the dark fruits. The taste is similar to the smell. Caramel and plum notes dominate the taste. The alcohol and oak make an appearance and compliment the stronger notes very well and end up creating a nice caramel taste in some places. Notes of vanilla from the barrel also appear. The beer is heavy bodied but very smooth to the point where it feels silky. Overall, a fantastic barleywine and one that I'll go looking for each year."
"O: I had my doubts that this beer would live up to the hype, but it definitely did and then some. If it weren't for the price and availability I would be drinking this every day."

For me it's a little heavy, so not an every evening type of beer, but I feel very lucky I tried it, and cannot wait for the second one to age a few years.

Overall, not a barleywine fan from my limited experience but quite enjoyed this one a lot. Not sure I care to bother with more barleywines, but would definitely drink this one again."

"Well - this certainly warrants a formal review. Abacus/Sucaba is an extremely high end barrel aged barleywine - possibly the best. I regard FW as the gold standard in barrel aging and it really shows in this one. Extremely sophisticated barrel presence - lots of oak, dark cherries, chocolate, stinging bourbon finish. Wonderful"

"I had a bottle of 2013 §ucaba that had been aged for exactly one year. After missing out on the 2014 §ucaba release at my go-to liquor stores, I consoled myself by breaking out the 2013 version from my cellar. §ucaba pours a deep ruby brown with a tan head that dissapates relatively quickly. The smell had notes of toffee, caramel, bourbon, vanilla, and oak. The taste was fantastic combination of sweet decadent caramelized malts and bourbon barrel notes. Burnt caramel, toffee, butterscotch, caramelized brown sugar, bourbon, charred oak, vanilla, coconut, dark sweet cherries, and subtle chocolate/coffee flavors. §ucaba has a pronounced barrel character that compliments the sweet malts beautifully without feeling too boozy. I thought the bourbon notes were quite smooth without the type of heat that you might expect from a 12.5% ABV barleywine. I think one year of aging may have been the perfect cellaring period. The mouthfeel was remarkably smooth, velvety, and drinkable for the ABV. This beer was truly a pleasure to drink. Firestone Walker has blown me away again once again with their bourbon barrel-aged releases. If I have to choose my favorite barleywine of all-time, it is a close call between §ucaba and Bourbon County Barleywine, but I think I would have to give a slight edge to §ucaba. Simply fantastic."

"Overall, this very well could be my new favorite barleywine with the only other possibility being Stickee Monkey, another from Firestone. I am absolutely giddy looking forward to trying the 2014 Sucaba release."

"Pour is dark cola brown with a dark tan head. Nose is wood, light bourbon, cooked brown sugar, lightly roasted malt and a touch of ash. Taste is strong barrel and bourbon, chocolate and brown sugar, slightly burnt. A bit of green hops in back. A hint too much sugar. Full bodied, thins in finish, strong carb, a hint slick."

"2000th review! Got in a trade with cyde. 22 ounce bottle into snifter; 2013 vintage, bottled on 1/9/2013. Pours lightly cloudy dark ruby brown color with a small dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin lace cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of big vanilla, molasses, toffee, caramel, raisin, toast, chocolate, coconut, oak, bourbon, tobacco, clove, and toast/oak earthiness. Incredible aromas with fantastic complexity and balance of malt and barrel notes; with great strength. Taste of huge molasses, vanilla, raisin, caramel, toffee, toast, coconut, chocolate, oak, bourbon, tobacco, light clove, and toast/oak earthiness. No bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of molasses, vanilla, raisin, toast, caramel, toffee, coconut, chocolate, oak, bourbon, tobacco, and toast/oak earthiness on the finish for a while. Insane complexity of malt and bourbon barrel flavors; with a perfect malt/barrel flavor balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and full bodied; with an very creamy, slick, and slightly syrupy mouthfeel that is amazing. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an absolutely insane BA English Barelywine style. All around insane complexity and balance of malt and bourbon barrel flavors; and extremely smooth to sip on for the high ABV. Absolutely unbelievable stuff, Wow."

"This is such an amazing beer. Firestone's barrell projects are getting better and better. You get so much from the barrel. Coconut, charcoal, bourbon, just amazing. Nice body of this beer, front of the mouth caramel and coconut, middle and back of the mouth lots of bourbon. A little boozy but this is a big beer!! I would have given this a 5 but I think with proper aging this beer will only get better."

"D: Definitely a good beer but not quite a favorite for me. English in style and almost too much going on to the point where flavors start to get a bit muddled.

"Picked this up in a great trade with Mike! Beautifyul clear mahogany pour with an off-white two finger head with decent retention and great lacing. Boozy, woody nose with hints of dark fruit, butterscotch, oak, vanilla, caramel, and subtle bourbon. The taste is also dominated by booze and wood along with hints of toffee, dark fruits, caramel, vanilla, oak, butterscotch, maple, bourbon, and some subtle chocolate. The mouthfeel is initially a bit on the hot and boozy side, but as it warmed it became quite smooth and creamy. Overall, this is another world class offering from Firestone Walker. I have a couple in the cellar and can't wait to try them."

"O- A great beer but I have to say the big alcohol presence was a bit of a turn off and unexpected. I was assuming I'd get something a bit smoother. Had this a few days after having Goose Island's BCBW and that was one of the best beers I've ever and may ever have. And this kind of paled in comparison to be honest. And BCBW is 12.1% and Sucaba is 12.5% but the alcohol prescence would lead me to believe it is more like 15% and a could barely detect the ABV in BCBW. Also the bourbon barrel presence is there but at a medium level compared to other big BA beers I've had. Barelywines and Old Ales along with Scotch Ales are my favorite beer styles and hope to see more barrel aged ones."

"Really want to love this beer. I have tried a few vintages and I am a huge fan of Firestone and barley wines. I just don't think this is a superior beer. The booze is all there in the tasting. I think actually to much of the booze comes through in the flavor and that is the real problem with this beer. Behemoth is still my staple for barley wine."
"Poured into a large snifter after about 20 minutes out of the ice bucket. Deep reddish brown with a fair amount of tan, creamy head. Good lacing, and the collar was thick at the edge of the glass. Aroma of toffee, caramel, some woody earthiness, sweet medium roasted malt too. Taste is of toffee/caramel, leather, woody-earthy, very lightly smokey (perhaps because of the campfire). So damn good. Mouthfeel is all that barleywines should be. Appropriately carbonated, medium creamy body. I could drink this til the cows come home; too bad I have to trade for it."
""
""
""
". Pours a dark, reddish black beer with a small, off white, creamy head on top. Aroma has/gives massive wood, vanilla, bourbon, caramel and touches of chocolate. Flavor is sweet, bourbon vanilla characteristics combined with a chocolate, malty backbone. Big wood presence in the flavors as well, making it very complex and a great sipper. Very well balanced and an awesome beer!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, there's a reason this is the standard by which barleywine is held to. Just a fantastic sipper that is warming and delicious."
"Overall, another incredibly complex and awesome beer from Firestone Walker. I had both this and Parabola with about a year of age on them, and I'm not sure they could get better. Mellow and smooth, yet bold and distinctive; Firestone Walker just gets barrel aging beer."

"The beer has a curious and medium bodied mouthfeel. It begin with a good amount of carbonation, but finishes with a slick almost oily feel. The oily feel is very brief and unfavorable, but I'm really only nitpicking here. Just something I have not experienced before. The taste begins with a warming impression of strong malt flavor that fades to the dark fruit that was strong in the nose consisting of prunes and raisins. Just a hint of vanilla on the finish with a slight reemergence of the alcohol. Very consistent to the English barley wine style with then barrel aging providing layers of complexity. Very good beer and wonderfully done blending and using the various barrels."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - excellent complexity, but it's overly sweet and the bourbon runs the show here"
"O - 4.25 - It's good. Given its reputation, I had for some reason expected a bolder complexity in terms of layering. But like some other English-style barleywines I've had, and like a lot of English and English-style beers in general, its subtlety makes its complexity something you have to work for, in this case at least beyond the sherry notes, which are themselves pretty bold and nice to have. There in the center is a mildness where I want something more. Style considerations aside, if I could magically alter it for the better, I'd put a puff of spice in it for that extra sense of layering and altitude, give it a buttery viscosity to play against the bitter/dry ending, and add something unmistakeably earthy to give it some additional depth and counterpoint to the sweet elements. Take me down low. It's still a very nice beer and well made. The potency of the alcohol in it leaves you dreamy warm and relaxed. To me it's an ideal slow, no-hurry, contemplative sipper for when the weather cools. Great brewery."

"Toasted malt and toasted coconut up front. Caramel and rummy fruit melange follow. Hints of brown sugar and toffee in the mix. Nice sweetness level--not too cloying.

Smooth and not too hot. Full-bodied, creamy feel. A beautifully put together beer. Too drinkable for its strength. Well done."

"O-a great Barleywine, one of the standards by which others should be judged"

"Pours seal brown with mahogany highlights and a thin khaki head. I don't recall the aroma, but I'd love to have it again and investigate further. Flavor tastes of dark fruit, oak, vanilla, mild milk chocolate, and booze. Without messing around, let's just say this is probably one of the ten best beers I've ever had. It's luxurious, balanced, complex, and way more drinkable than a 13% ABV beer has any right to be. It was outstanding from the first sip to the last, and only prudence prevented me from having a second glass. I can find no fault with it."

"One of the best aromas I've ever smelled from a beer. Complexity is an over-used word but this is complex. The transitions of aroma, taste, and feel over the course of the bottle are incredible. Full barrel flavors the meld beautifully. Don't know how this could get any better with age."

"this is as good as a barleywine can get for me, a style of beer I don't always rush to score because of the heavy fusel alcohols and mess of grains usually accompanying American versions. this however, is a masterpiece! thanks to claystation for hooking it up. 2013 release. it pours a deep mahogany color, dense but not particularly cloudy, with a tall and fairly long lasting off white head. the nose is very complex, but also mellow. I definitely get red wine, charcoal, bourbon, rye malt, caramel, and alcohol. the different barrel blends really come out in the nose and the taste, giving a lot of layers to this monster. the flavor features some vanilla and some toffee, brown sugar, but its not too sweet, and some dried fruits in the date or fig range. again, the complexity is stunning. furthermore, the alcohol content of this beer in not caustic or hot like I expected it to be. its in fact quite tame, just warming, appropriate. this is also oddly drinkable for its magnitude. its soft in feel, but very well carbonated, and the body is full but not filling per se. I cant say enough about this one, everything is dialed in, and its a beer only firestone walker could pull off. its got their signature all over it. I was hesitant and skeptical to see a barleywine so high in the BA rankings, but this makes perfect sense now that ive had it. I will look forward to my next bottle with great enthusiasm! a must try. this is pretty much the end all and be all of the style for me."

"Taste has a very malt mixed with dark fruity raisin-y flavor going on, sweetness in the aftertaste but nothing too cloying, body is nice and full, carbonation is soft but active which lends a hand with the full body, the boozy alcohol burn is present but surprisingly is really only hits the back of the throat and not so much in the mouth which is nice, a very nice sipper indeed."

"O: There's a reason this has such a strong reputation. It has the impressive ability to meld together a smooth drinkability with an amazingly complex taste, and is truly a unique drinking experience. I have a 2011 bottle sitting around too...I'll have to see how that's drinking soon."

"On-tap as part of a Firestone tap takeover. Pour is a dark chestnut brown. Very barrel-forward in the nose and in the beginning. Lots of vanilla is present. Mouthfeel is amazing, i can drink this all day. Warming towards the end, I would love to see this after a year."

"However, having this aged from 2012 on tap at Brouwerij Lane, I prefer this fresh. With age, the booze mellows, but as does the big bold flavors. It becomes less complex and bold. Not that it is not still amazing, but I just prefer the wide range of flavors that the fresh one has."
""
""

"Overall- Solid A with inclinations toward A+. This is a must try and a steal at the price. I will not hesitate to pick 2 or 3 or however many I can afford next year."

"Wow!! I knew people were head over heels in love with this thing, but now after having it I see why. This transcends the barleywine style as we know it, integrating the best of brandy, bourbon, and American white oak flavors, as well as incorporating a British malty goodness with a West Coast hop grassy profile at the finish. Undeniably complex, and I'm kicking myself for not buying a bottle or two extra to see how a vintage this great would end up tasting in a year or two. Not an everyday beer, but undeniably delicious. Can't wait to try Parabola and DDBA as well, and immerse myself with FW's incredible barrel program! This is pivotal for sure. Every fan of barleywines and barrel-aged beers must check it out."

"The Sucaba I had on tap was delicious. Very strong bourbon notes, vanilla.. appearance was a very dark black, but not opaque. Thin lacing of head, and smelled very similar to BCS which I had on the side. The taste is spectacular, probably my favorite barleywine, but I don't typically drink this style of beer. Out of a bottle, it is not so complex, a little thinner, but the flavor is there. It is also quite boozy in comparison to the tap. Makes me think the Sucaba on tap was from a year or more ago. Definitely excited to try the other bottles I have in the cellar."

"O: I quite enjoyed this, despite typically not liking barleywines very much. The barrel aged character of this beer imparted wonderful flavors that balanced beautifully with the beer, although they did seem to take over the beer and mostly use it as a vehicle for barrel deliciousness delivery. I was glad that I was able to split this bottle 5 ways, because with that size of pour I am left excited to revisit another bottle in 6 months or a year. I definitely could not have enjoyed it as much had I finished a bottle by myself, even if the alcohol content was not an issue. Another great barrel-aged offering from Firestone Walker that I would advocate anyone trying."

"This beer is exquisite."
"Overall, I'd say between 0-1 years is best for this beer. It gets a bit sweet with two years."

"Deep darker amber pour, with a small beige head that retained as a thin ringlet. Nice sugary nose, toffee and brown sugar, raisins, bourbon, and surprisingly, quite a bit of the wood/barrel profile remained even after aging for a couple years. The aroma was reflected in the taste, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, hint of vanilla, bourbon barrel, raisins, herbal and earthy hops in the distance. Chewy mouthfeel, full body. A great barleywine overall. I have a few bottles of other vintages that I'm looking forward to sampling soon."
"O: This is outstanding. Remember this review is based on a beer that is pushing 6-8months old. Huge drinkable, layered barrel aged barley wine. Drink one fresh, save one for later. Trust me, it's worth it."

"Overall - The more barrel-aged beers I try, the more I realize I'm just not that into them. I'm not a fan of hard liquor, because I don't much like the taste, and I don't like that drying 'alcohol burn' sensation. I can understand why this beer has a 100 score on here; it's phenomenally crafted. Clean, well-attuned layers of flavor. At the end of the day, though, it's just not my bag. Too much alcohol burn for me to truly enjoy."
""

"Aged 1 year. Pours darkish brown with decent head. Maybe the best smelling beer of all time. A bit of malty bourbon that reall complements the barley wine notes. Kind of a syrup smell too. This is as smooth as smooth gets for a bourbon aged barley wine. Best in class in the bourbon barrel aged beers. This lives up to the hype and would definitely seek this out. Can't say enough positives about the beer."

"Easily the best barleywine I have had."

""
""
""
""
""
"O- Very good Barley wine that was very easy to drink and satisfied the pallet for long periods between sips."
"O: 4.75 - definitely one of the best if not the best barrel-aged English barleywines that I have ever tasted; there is so much (almost too much!) going on in the nose and mouth; it definitely lives up to the hype and is worth trading for and aging to try in a vertical tasting; my only complaint is that it can be expensive ($15.99-$21.99 in the greater D.C. area)"

"O- An excellent beer, no doubt about it. The maltiness plays off the sweet barrel flavors very nicely. Lots of complexity and great depth."

"Suuucaaabaaa. Me oh my, I love love love this beer. Ironic because I'm not really a Barleywine fan. But this is far more than just a BW, it's like dessert in a glass. It has pretty much every wonderful aroma and flavor mixed into it, and each time I have it, it never disappoints. If you haven't tried it yet, I'd strongly suggest seeking it out. Simply sublime."
""
"O: (hardly) arguably one of the top 3 American barleywines I've had - worth the extra effort on their part....very nice - highly recommended, for yourself or as a gift"
""
""
""
""
"D: glad this thing has gotten as low as it has (attenuation wise) otherwise it may be tough to drink. otherwise, super big. dark flavors. dark chocolate, bitter dark grains, black cherries, complex, more boozy than I would like. I wouldn't have mind it if I aged this for another couple years just to smooth it out a bit more. however, still super drinkable now."

""
""
""

"With that in mind, this is a big, cuddly and loveable brew. Flavours I love and the development of the palate is superb. If not for that slight overheated booze on the back, this would have been held in wonderful balance."
"Overall: 93-94 = A"
""
"I've been wanting to try this beer for a while. Did it live up to its hype? It did for me. I would have liked more bourbon and oak aromas and taste, but that's probably due to this beer's young age. I would love to age a bottle to see how it will taste in the future, but I only scored one bottle. So sad!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is very good beer, and I suspect with aging it will become even better. However, as young as my bottle is, the bourbon notes simply overpower many of the flavors, making the mouthful not nearly as mouthwatering as the aroma, and giving the beer a very strong Jack-and-Coke overtone. If I buy a second bottle of this—and I likely will—I’m going to cellar it for a good two years."
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
"Overall: One of the best barleywines I've ever had. Incredibly complex and insanely smooth. Seek out a bottle to drink now and a few more to age."
"Overall: A pretty good barrel-aged barleywine. This one has a whole lot of heat to it however which can always bring some mixed reactions. I don't think it kills it, but adds some interesting character."
"O- I am not the biggest Barelywine fan, but I am a big fan of this beer. Very well done and easy to drink for 12.5% ABV. Can't wait to pick up another bottle or two."
"2013. Pours dark amber with a quickly fading eggshell head. Aroma is of caramel and bourbon barrel. Flavor is sweet with bourbon notes that finishes with wood and smoke. Some fusel alcohol on the back end. Palate is a bit thin for such a big beer. Light carbonation. Overall, this is one of the finest English-style barleywines I've ever had!"
""
"An outstanding barley wine. Excellent balance between barrel, bourbon and caramelly malty goodness. I tend to like the hoppy barley wines (Hog Heaven, Behemoth, etc) but this is fantastic. Another must try offering from Firestone Walker."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: great beer good example of an English style barley malt forward and the barrel aging is slightly hinted on this years"
""
"Wow! SOOO close to a perfect score from me, but I had to knock off a few ticks for the thin mouthfeel and muted aroma. Otherwise, this brew is out of this world. Pours a deep ruby color with a moderate 1-finger head. Smells of sweet malt with bourbon and vanilla overtones. The typical mellow oakiness is also present from the barrel aging. Overall, the flavors are perfectly balanced without any single one overpowering the others. A tad heavy on the sweetness, but absolutely nothing offensive. The 12.5% ABV is present, but fits into the overall flavor profile like the last piece of a jigsaw puzzle. The sweet heat and bite is a welcomed finale to each outstanding sip. A solid A+ for this brew, nothing less. Easily worth the $15/bomber and I'll be looking to stock up on this each and every release."
""
""
"Pours a crimson brown with a little bit of head that quickly faded away into nothing. The smell is extrodinary with a lot of toffee, vanilla, bourbon and I want to say cinnomon but, it might just be a spiceness. The taste of this beer is other worldly, it is another absolutly fantastic addition to FW's Rep. It is sweet but not too sweet. Bourbon and wine barrells really mellowed this beer. Not a lot of taste from the wine barrells which I like. Overall an excellent beer that I will enjoy from time to time. Not trading this one."
"Overall this stuff is pretty good, but I'm a bit let down after trying parabola last weekend. This really needs to lie down for a while, should really improve with some age. I have three more in my cellar, I'll return with a re-review in a year or two"

"I've waited a long time to try Sucaba and it didn't let me down! This is such a complex brew, and the bourbon really stands out and makes a grand presence. It's a heavier version of Founders Backwoods Bastard in my opinion, and that's one of my favorite beers."

"Deep amber, clear in appearance with a very creamy half finger tan head. Spots cling to the glass sparingly. Lots of caramel with toffee candy, rich chocolate, vanilla, and strong oak (not overpowering). Toasted wheat bread is also prevalent. Caramel and vanilla dominate the palate with dark chocolate, candied sugar, and lot of booze to end. Feel is slightly viscous with a dry finish. Great, but I can't have more than a snifter since it's so sweet."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - really great beer. Super easy drinking, hides the ABV no problem. Could drink this every night. Only gripe would be a little lack of depth in the flavor profile, but overall an A/A+ beer"
""
"Overall - This is truly one of the best beers I have ever had. Firestone Walker is quickly becoming one of my favorite breweries, in that their line is so varied and robust. This is an exceptional beer. I thought it was a stout at first, and put it on line with BCBS. I wasn't until I reviewed it that I learned it was considered an English Barleywine. You need to go get this brew as soon as possible."
"O - Amazing. Everything a person is looking for in an english barelywine. If i really had to pick out a downfall (and im nit picking) is a more potent scent."

"Overall I really love this one. I will probably grab the 2013 and maybe try to age it longer than I did this one."

"If you can find it, but as much of it as you can. Don't settle for just one, like me."

""
""
"O - I'm a stout guy/BA stout guy. That being said, this is one of the greatest and most balanced, complex beers (of any style) that I've ever consumed. The glory of this beer is the balance of the bourbon and additional flavors. They compliment one another perfectly. This is, by far, the best barleywine I've ever tried...and it's not even close."
"Overall: Firestone Walker's barrel program makes some of the best barrel aged beers. The level of complexity on this beer is amazing. Tons of bourbon."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer pours a dark murky red, but when you put it in the light it glows a gorgeous ruby. The beer’s body seems clean, but surprisingly full of carbonation bubbles. The beer pours with a decent sized white head that seems to be turning khaki colored. It mellows down to a half of a finger’s width as the beer sits in the glass. It features nice legs of alcohol as you swirl it in the glass, and leaves little dots of thin slippery lacing on the glass wall. On the nose, the beer smells big and boozy with wonderfully complex notes of plum fruit, toffee, slight raisin and bourbon sweet notes, and even some brown sugar notes. On the tongue, the beer tastes wonderfully sweet and complex with boozy alcohol and lovely mellow toffee and oak notes. The beer begins with caramelly malt that moves into toffee, light bourbon and then explodes into a medley of all those flavors, adding coconut, light oak, very faint char, raisins, dates, and brown sugar. The finish is a little harsh with booze, but also features a maple syrup sweet taste that travels into the sticky aftertaste. You can definitely feel this travelling down the back of your throat, but I think with a bit of age it could be beautifully mellowed, and as is I find the flavors wonderfully mellow while still being big and complex. As it warms up, this beer definitely builds in booziness. On the mouth, the beer feels thick and chewy, but soft and very mellow almost fluffy with the carbonation, almost syrupy. Its body sits on the mellower side of heavy. The mouth is left slightly dry with alcohol and sticky dry saliva. Overall, I’m definitely a fan of this beer. This is one of my favorite Barleywines right now, and I would love to find another bottle and set it away for a couple years. This stuff is thick, boozy, and complex, and definitely a sipper. You should try this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - One of the best BWs I've ever had; the complexity of the flavors, ease of consumption, and generally booze-soaked sweet notes are all pulled off without being even a tad overbearing; I'd say this is the best FW beer I've had, but I still have a Parabola and Sucaba 12, along with 15 sitting in the cellar. GREAT work here FW."

"Better and better every year, mmm mmm great Barleywine!"

"aged in refrigerated cellar ar 53deg, aged 1.5years. pours a nice dark walnut shell; almost pitch-black atop and towards the bottom of the pour it is much lighter looking with the brown tones much more apparent. Head is still there and seems to have settled slightly however still very active. Lacing is spotty, big-pica-dot pattern left on the glass here, possibly the best looking beer/barley wine for sure I have come across to date. Smell is toffee, high quality dark cocoa, pecan. Taste is Dark chocolate first then toffee, then some ripe pear, chestnut, hazelnut, cashew, then a little roast, red wine and some bourbon with definite oak detected in the finish, with the barrel lending it's impression on this beer. heat from the abc lingers, and adds to the layers of flavor, that go well here (such as adding wine or cognac or vodka in to lend complexity, which may add to complexity and refinement). Sweet but not too sweet, medium bodied, and the malt profile here is impressive. Overall, do yourself a favor and serve this closer to room temp than not. Still and will always probably be my favorite barley wines. Merit is off the charts here. Food that pairs with chutneys, and a rich flavor complex. Nutty cheeses such as aged gouda. Black truffle is going to be a top notch match for this beer. Heavily browned or buttered, and earthy/spice-ful dishes. dried herbs vs fresh herbs; smoked or grilled vs. seared. Something that can stand up to one of the most tasty and complex beers in the world."

"Another big thanks to jzeilinger for cracking a bottle of this brew for us to try. This was one I've wanted to try for a while and I'm honored to say that I finally had it. The beer poured out as a deep amber color with some brown hues to it. The head was white and actually stuck around for a little while. There was a light lacing on the glass too. The smell of the beer is sweet and earthy, lots of caramel and toffee notes along with some hops too that I am a bit surprised to pick up. The barrel aging also comes in on the nose too. The taste of this beer is awesome. I can't even explain the kind of flavors I experienced here. There is some serious complexity here. The mouthfeel is very good too, it's super smooth with a nice subtle carbonation to it,. Overall this was great, There is no doubt that I will buy this for myself one day to have it again.

"A: Wispy head which drops quickly, little activity in terms of carbonation, muddy brown with a hint of burgundy and rust - 4.00, S: Initial whiffs of watered down whisky (not meant as a slight), a hint of caramel and candied figs, noticeable oak on the nose - 4.00, T: Alcohol soaked fruit cake, golden raisins and dates, a significant shot of vanilla and oak, the caramel on the nose comes through on the palate, nice tasting - 4.25, M: Mouthfeel is a little flacid and slightly runny, the lack of effervescence detracts a little - 3.50, O: 2013 Reserve Series No. 003. As a big fan of Firestone Walker and their work with barrel aging, I was excited to try the Abacus beer. Though a very solid beer all around I personally found a couple of undesirables that lessened it loftiness not the least the $16.99 price tag. Barrel aging can be finicky and I may have drank this early than the peak date but I will likely stick with other Firestone Walker beers - 4.00"

"Overall: Definitely a unique Barleywine that I'm glad I could try. Be forewarned that it's indeed boozy and probably doesn't hide it as well as some others in its class. This is last year's bottle, so I'll definitely seek out a fresh one in a few months to compare. This company has yet to let me down and are one of the best out there."

"O – I’ve got to say I was disappointed by this beer. I was looking for a big, rich, malty beer but what I got was basically weaker, carbonated bourbon. While I do like bourbon, and I do like bourbon-barrel aged beers, I don’t like my beers to taste only like bourbon. The malt and hops are there somewhat but they are completely overshadowed by the taste and aroma of bourbon and oak. The only reason why this isn’t getting a lower score is because this is what can happen with English barleywines if they’re aged long enough. They lose some of the malt and hop characteristics and take on a more sherry-like or port-like quality. However, while I can understand losing some hops, they should not lose this much malt character. I’m not quite sure what the hype is all about with this beer, but I’ve had better barleywines."

"O- great beer. It is my favorite barley wine"
""
""

"Overall: A massively complex beer. Huge dark fruit notes covered in bourbon and sweet toffee. Just enough carbonation and tannins to clear the palate and make you want to come back for more. Expertly balanced between huge sweet notes and strong bourbon and heat but it remains extremely smooth even as it warms."

"Overall: Paired with a piece of sharp cheddar cheese this beer is great. As far as (English) Barleywines are concerned this brew is up on top of the food chain but still not on the level of what I reviewed last night. I don't really like mentioning other beers within a review but not too hard to look up. If you see, you buy! and enjoy what quality is supposed to be about. Salud!"

"Bottle: Poured a medium clear amber color ale with a small foamy head with good retention and light lacing. Aroma of bourbon and corn is very deep with some sweet caramelized malt notes. Taste is a very rich mix between some bourbon notes with light corn ester and some deep caramelize sugar. Bourbon is intense though not too much too ruin the balanced though vanilla notes are harder to distinguish. Residual sugar is also not too overwhelming and some attenuation remains to keep some kind of balance into this big beer. Well done and something I would have again."

"O: A very nice Barleywine. The barrel-aging really rounds this one out quite a bit, adding complexity without the alcohol harshness. To think this is a 13% ABV beer is amazing."
""
"O: A sweet, great tasting Barleywine. Not overly complex, but well balanced and delicious. The bourbon really shines here without adding a bunch of harsh booziness."

"651mL thanks to peteinsd. Pours a flattish clear deep mahogany. Yellow bubbles. Looks like FW10, FW11. Nose is big maple, toasted coconut, toffee maltiness. As it warms it exhibits more savoriness/umami with rich coconut. Taste is rich, big coconut bourbon, lovely dessert profile with mild heat. Not too much sugar, beautiful coconut. Very beautiful palate- not too sticky with a nice fruit juicy character and mild sugar. Super yummy dessert beer. Similar to FW11. Shame it doesn’t pour with a head. Moderate alcohol heat is not distracting at all. Still, Parabola is the Cuvee de Firestone. 11/17/2011 8/2/8/4/16=3.8"

"Pours a deep dark brown with faint ruby highlights when held to light and a smallish off white head that quickly dissipates. The smell is really amazing. A little smoky, a bit of brown sugar, some vanilla and oak, cherries and raisins, coconut, no harsh ethanol, wow I could stick my nose under this all night. The flavor follows the aroma quite well but comes in waves of flavor. Sweet sugary malts up front, a bit of oaky bourbon next, some dark fruits wash in then some earth and sweetness then a bit of warming comes in before a semi sweet lingering finish. Medium to thick body with a light to moderate level of carbonation and a sweet almost ashy or chalky mouthfeel. This one is a sipper that's for sure, but I'm going to spend the rest of the night enjoying the shit out of this."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I'm mixed on it, do I like this? sure. Am I wowed or really impressed? no, not really. A bit too big, a bit too sweet and a bit too boozy. As I take more sips however I am a little bit more interested in it and finally subtle other flavors. Solid, but not my 'wow' beer."
"D - Very drinkable. Great barleywine with really nice Bourbon coming through. Amazing overall balance."

"Real thick malts on the nose of this one. Figs are in there as well, but as an accent. Flavor is nice. Smooth and fairly sweet with a bit of a boozy thing to it. Maple seems evident on here as well. Smooth, certainly. But as it's a 2011, it could probably use some age to harness some complexity. As it stands now though, it's quite good. Few barleywines are able to get to this point so fresh. And that is worth noting. After several beers before this, and drinking them ""too fast," I wanted a sipper. This is that. Something to relax with, savor, and enjoy. A notable beer."
"Overall: Wow. This is damn good. The best barleywine I've ever had and up there on the list of best beer period."

""
""
""

"Pours deep ruby with a thin brownish head. Smell is huge bourbon, vanilla, caramel with a slight hint of alcohol. Tastes just as the nose let's on with burbon first that smooths out to a very pleasant sweetness almost like a toasted marshmellow. Mouthfeel and carbonation are just about as perfect as I can sk for with a barleywine. Overall very good beer. I have had this beer a few times in the last 6 months and always loved it...I have no idea why this sits around in stores."
""
""
"o- delicious beer. great stuff from FW."
"Abacus bottle, not sure of the vintage probably 2010. Clear mahogany pour with slightly yellowish white foam. Aroma is typical of a good barleywine, lots of rich toasted malt, toffee, caramel, piney hops, a touch of oak, very subtle though, a hint of vanilla. Taste is rich and boozy, sweet, slightly roasty, cherry, some chocolate. Palate is rich, boozy, alcohol definitely present. Nice barleywine, slightly too boozy though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Pours a clear, Dark brown and a quickly fading head. The smell is chocolate with hints of oak and Alcohol upfront. Taste is chewy, chocolate, vanilla with alcohol, almost too hot. This one was difficult to rate, very complex. I could not figure out this beer but I really enjoyed this as a scotch type sipper. I’ll let the Sucaba bottle age for a year or so and then try it again."
""
""
""
""
""
"M&D - smooth, rich, velvety, sweet, powerful; this beer is all those. I am headed to get some more of this. Want to put some age on one. This beer hides a 12.5% punch very well, and behind some incredible flavors. Find it. Buy it. Try it."
"O: A fantastic English Barleywine. I would actually rate it higher than MoaS."
""
"This is nice and full bodied, with smooth carbonation. Really tasty. I will get more at a later date."
"Full chewy feel with soft carbonation. Overall this one is solid. Simply a well done barely wine with lots of great flavors that are well balanced."

"Overall this is a true work of brewing art, and the best Barrel-Aged Barely Wine I have ever had the pleasure of tasting. The fact that this is so balanced and clean while still so fresh is astounding. I opened this one at around 45 degrees, and it is now most likely around 55 and it is just perfect. This is now almost six months old and is damn near perfect; I don't see anything more then a year on this bottle being beneficial. This is highly recommended to any fan of Barley Wines or barrel-aged beers. Thanks again TJ, I owe you for this one. Cheers!"

""
"Overall this is a top notch BBBW! I am convinced that this is as close to King Henry as you can get without drinking it. I have a few bottles left and plan on seeking out somemore!"
""
"Verdict: This is a sexy beer, rich, voluptuous and doesn't get too sweet even though the alcohol is definitely apparent through the drinking experience. The rich flavors are in great harmony and the bourbon adds a great touch to this Barleywine. This is a home run from Firestone Walker, one of the best barrel aged Barleywines on the market and an anchor in the Proprietor's Reserve Series."
"Overall really enjoyable very nice nose and body "

"This is a good brew. It is very complex, yet dry with a faint bitterness. The flavor comes and leave fast."

"The two vintages look nearly identical, a dark reddish-brown with a small white head. The smell is where things start to diverge: the 2012 aroma is fantastic, full of oak and bourbon combined with brown sugar and maybe even some dark fruits. The 2011 aroma is nice, but not nearly as impressive. The bourbon and oak are more subdued and instead it's got more of the standard English barleywine aroma of raisins standing out. The 2012 gets a 4.5, the 2011 gets a 4. The flavor follows the nose in both cases. The 2012 had much brighter flavors with the oak and bourbon mixing in very nicely with the dark fruits and malts of the barleywine, while the bourbon and oak really have faded to the background in the 2011. 2011 tastes more like a standard English barleywine with a little bit of age on it, much mellower and more subtle. Again, I'd give the 2012 a 4.5, the 2011 a 4. Mouthfeel is largely the same in both cases, medium-to-full bodied with decent carbonation. Overall, I think the 2012 really stands out as the superior beer here, while the 2011 is merely good, not outstanding. I had the 2011 fresh and loved it, and the beer just has really fallen off over time. I guess the lesson learned here is not to age this beer - drink it fresh!"
""
""

"O - This beer is so complex and wraps around your palate like a warm blanket. Among the finest Barleywines I've tried and would make an awesome gift in the winter. Glad to share this with Vince."
"Overall: Tons of flavor here. Peeled off new layers as I went along and felt like the bourbon added a ton to the already delicious flavor. Not too boozy for the abv. Grab a few bottles of this one."

"Overall a fantastic barleywine. An easy drink with huge character. "

"Overall: My God! So smooth. Elegant in its simplicity and so well made. This ended up being my 100th review by accident. I had gotten it to celebrate the end of a major project at work - and it just so happened to coincide with completing my first century."
""
"Overall: This is close to being outstanding. Despite the heat and burning, its really damn good. Probably needs a year or three."
"O: I thought this beer was excellent. Very well balanced and the complexity was perfect. The only thing that is holding this one back from all 5s is the noticeable alcohol. However, some aging should do the trick with this one. And since KH is retired, this one will make a pretty damn good substitute."
"overall - a great beer, just wish it was cheaper."

"O: A special treat beer that befits its limited release status. This thing is well worth whatever you've saved it for. It's complex, but drinkable, and has some truly beautiful flavors that occur in perfect harmony. As it warms, it just gets more mellow and tasty. This one is the real deal."
""

"I've had Abacus (and now Sucaba) a number of times each, and I never understand why these receive so much praise. There are MANY superior barleywines out there; don't waste your liver capacity on this one."

"Pours a very deep mahogany brown with a one finger, tan head. Goes quickly. Aroma of dark fruits and cherries predominately. Also a bit of vanilla and booze. Absolutely delicious flavor. Awesome amounts of dark fruits, figs and great cherry kicks. Moves flawlessly into smooth caramel, mocha and vanilla notes. Bourbon and molasses too. Really great flavor, showcases nearly all the wonderful aspects of a barleywine flavor profile while integrating them seamlessly. The alcohol flavor is hidden and this beer does not need any aging. Smooth, sweet and delicious. Top notch for the style."

"o - overall, a solid offering, but not as wonderful as i remembered, but still an amazing beer. since last year's batch many other big players have emerged in the barrel aged barleywine space and although i'm sure this one still holds a spot in the top 5 or 10, it is not the top spot. granted this is a different year and there will always be variation from year to year. i look forward to trying this side-by-side with last years."

For me this one finished in the middle of the pack. Still a damn good beer and I will drink this every chance I get."
""
"O - Very enjoyable barleywine. Very smooth and creamy feeling, well balanced, not too boozy but enough to let you know its there. Definitely one of the better barleywines out there."
""
"O- This was a very good Barleywine. I like Barleywines, but they've never been my favorite. Like most Barleywines this beer was a little bit too sweet and syrupy for my liking. That aside, this beer had a great taste and smell. The alcohol was very well hidden and mixed well with the beer. In a lot of barleywines the alcohol has too much of a burning taste that ruins the flavor, this is not the case in abacus. One of the best barleywines I've had, definitely recommended if you are a barleywine fan."
""
""
""
"Poured from a bomber into a duvel tulip. Pours a dark ruby brown with a finger length beige head that shrinks to nothing. Average lacing. Aroma is dark fruit. Raisins, figs, plums, and malt. Taste is more of the same. Raisin, plum, toffee, caramel, and slight citrus notes. Mouthfeel is sticky and chewy. Amazing beer, can't wait till i try a cellared one."
""
""
"Maybe KH has raised my standard for this style, but I thought this was awful. A hot boozy."
""
"O: What can I say, I'm a sucker for barleywines, and I love this one.  If you like the style, go get this, now.  If you don't like the style, or dislike bourbon, it may be  best to stay away cause this is one big,bourbon heavy, barleywine.  Awesome brew.  Again, a big thanks to MarkVegas for talking me into expanding our trade to include this.  "

"O: King Henry is one of my favorite beers and let me tell you I'll take Sucaba as a decent substitute for the never brewed again King. This has shot to the top of my list of all time favorite sipping beers, but it is so hard to just sip this one."
"Overall - loved this beer, their barrels are magical. Only complaint was the boozyness that came through on a couple of sips, it was probably imagined."
""
""
""
"22oz bomber. Reserve Series No. 002. Pours a dark brownish black color with a small amount of tan head. Aromas of booze, cherries, malts and vanilla. Taste is a nice oaky bourbon up front with vanilla and cherry. Some malts and dark fruits as well. Nice warming alcohol burn. Certainly can taste the 12.5% Abv. Boozey oak finish. Creamy mouthfeel. Lightly carbonated. The flavors really come to life as it warms. Outstanding barleywine. Glad i got a chance to try it."
""
"Poured into a 8 oz tulip glass. Pours a magnificent mahogany with a half inch of white head, with a little lace. Smell is French vanilla, carmel, oak, and bourbon. Taste is tons of vanilla in the start and bourbon and oak finish. Body is medium large, perfect carbonation for the style, not dry, and very drinkable. This is the best barleywine I have had so far. The barrel aging with this company is crazy good. Wow"
""
""
""
"O: While I could not drink this very often I thoroughly enjoyed it. A nice beer to split with a good friend. Can't wait to try my King Henry now."
"Poured a dark brown, almost black body with minimal lace patches. I pick up figs, barley, roasted malt at first sniff for some reason, a woodiness as well (I guess oak really), some sweet sugary and chocolatey malts as well as a pinch of dark fruit. A plethora of maltiness in as much as this is a thicker, fuller body that borders on syrupy stickiness at times. A bready/woodiness and some roasted malts balance real well with chocolate, careamel, vanilla even a touch of toffee (I think). Can't really say any hop or fruit notes come out, so it's more of just a malt beer so to say. Perhaps the stunner was the 12+ ABV% b/c they really hide it well other than that nice high and dry finish. A little pricey and def a sipper but worth a try by anyone."
""
"Pours a deep ruby amber with a half-finger off-white head that quickly reduces to a very thin foam ring. Aromas of sweet dark fruit especially black cherry, oak, bourbon booziness, and toffee rises from the glass. Bourbon greets the tastebuds joined by a bit of sweet fig, plum, and caramel, finishing with tones of bourbon warmth and oak. Wonderful mouthfeel. Full syrupy body coats the mouth with silky smoothness. One of the top barrel-aged English barleywines available. A ""must purchase"" annually."
""
""
""
"O - Nice depth and complexity, sweet and boozy, the next bomber will be shared with a friend, 22 oz of this goodness is too much for one person."
"O - The aroma doesn't show much, if anything, of the barrel. Instead it provides a lot of malts. The flavor is mellow and nice, but lacks complexity until the finish. The finish is still a little bit hot. If you have some left, drink it."
""
"O: Hands down the best barley wine I've had. I loved it and I would be surprised if you don't. I have one sleeping in the box, in my basement, taking a long nap until I wake her up in a year or so. I cannot wait to see how she develops."
"Overall one of the best barleywines I've tasted. It's easy for this style to get out of control, but this was a very drinkable beer."

"NOTE 6/13/13: I aged a 2012 for a year and it's much less hot and boozy now. The aging did wonders for it. Awesome!"

"This beer is pretty amazing and complex, all things considered. Smooth but prickly, sweet and yet dry, boozy and yet balanced in its own way. Even a touch fruity. This is the kind of beer that makes me want to brew a barleywine and barrel age it. This beer is huge and not for all, but if you appreciate a good whiskey, bourbon or even scotch, then give this a shot. Its definitely one of the best barleywines I've had. I wish I had bought at least two bottles, leaving one to age and see what it would be like in a year or two. But I couldn't imagine it being much better than it is now. Great beer, pick at least two bottles up if you see it!"
""
""
""
""
""
"To date, the best barleywine I've had. Looking forward to drinking a few other bottles I have on deck to compare to it (King Henry, Mother of All Storms), but if they're better than this, I will be thoroughly impressed. I don't generally like barrel-aged beers, but I could drink this stuff for days (if it weren't 13%... is it really 13%? I get no alcohol burn at all). I need to get myself some more of this."
"o: fantastic. delicious. incredibly drinkable. so well balanced - it doesn't drink hot at all, which given the aroma is impressive. two thumbs up."

"Review from 3/2011 notes. Poured into a Nostradamus flute glass. Pours a very dark red brown with a light head and minimal lacing. Very nice aroma of bourbon, malt and oak. Flavor follows with malts, dark fruit, bourbon, vanilla, oaky middle and boozy oaky bourbon finish that melds all the flavors together. Very nicely done. The booze is a little assertive, but I think this will be superb if aging tones down the alcohol. Still delicious and very well made."
""
""
"This is an excellent barrel aged barleywine. Huge flavors and aromas that are intertwined so that nothing becomes overwhelming and nothing gets lost in the shuffle. Everything seems carefully balanced. I felt the same way about the original bottle (Abacus) when fresh and not so much a couple weeks ago when I had a second bottle. After having this fresh again so close to the aged bottle it makes me realize that the balance is so good when fresh that aging it might not do it any good."
""
"O: Wow, is all I can say. This is a big bourbon and malt extravaganza. It's boozy, sweet, complex yet surprisingly balanced. I thought the bourbon would overpower it from the smell but it does not, it just compliments all the flavors nicely. By far the best english barleywine I've had."
"O: great beer overall, and the barrel aging no doubt added to the beer. I'm curious to see how it ages even though the consensus is that one should drink it fresh. ~$15 per bottle."
""
""
"O: Great beer. Had a hard time finishing the whole bottle even with the help of a friend. I want to try it again and this time with an open mind and with a better idea of what to expect."

"Overall/Drinkability- this is overall probably one of the best beers I have had in an extremely long time, its just so incredible balanced even with out any age, the oak has been masterfully integrated into a delicious and smooth ale of high abv. but amazingly drinkable, well worth seeking out I find this to be a master piece, as well as this is rated i find it underrated, seek it and horde it good stuff, almost reviewed this just under perfect but said to myself for the style how could this be better my answer was it couldnt be , this is perfect if not best beer i have ever had in my top 5 and certainly the best of they style, incredible, this beer made me forget the world around me and smile when something can do that its brilliance : )"
"§ucaba (Abacus) is a respectable English Barleywine style ale, but it definitely does not live up to the hype surrounding it. Perhaps a bit more aging would help smooth out some of its rough edges."

"2012 Scuba Steve edition. 22oz bottle served in a snifter. Poured a clear reddish brown with a quickly dissipating head. Lots of chocolate and vanilla in the aroma along with a bit of alcohol and some hops. Really complex flavor with more chocolate and a bit of bourbon from the barrels. Not as boozy as the nose might suggest. Medium bodied without much carbonation. Really long finish of chocolate. Way to easy drinking for 12.5 ABV! Fantastic."
""
"MF- Creamy feel to a nice full body. Carbonation is moderate and there is a definite alcohol warmth."

" Overall this is a homerun in my eyes! Awesome beer,very balenced and not to sweet slight bit of alchohol heat. I hear this is best fresh I can only imagine how awesome if this is true!"
"O- at this point I would have to say this is THE BEST barrel aged barleywine I have ever drank."
"O/D-This is an excellent big beer. Incredibly rich, incredibly complex, and incredibly flavorful. One of the best beers I have had in recent memory. Perhaps the best Barleywine I have ever had."

"This is an awesome sipping beer. The booze is on the strong side, but the beer has more than enought character to counteract it."

"O: Wow this is one beer that takes the stage and does not dissapoint. Beautiful on every level, i could only imagine how this masterpiece ages. If you find a bottle, do not hesitate to buy and enjoy."
"O: This beer has an inviting aroma and is delicious as well as incredibly smooth - it gets better with each sip and I was just hoping the glass would never end. Super easy to drink and hides the alcohol well, I could sip on this all day long and never tire of it....hmmmm, maybe that should be my plan."
"Overall a totally impressive beer."
"O: This is a great beer to sip because it continually keeps your taste buds interested due to its complex flavors. It definitely tastes quite strong but the alcohol does not detract from the taste."
"Abacus is nicely balanced, with some nice sweetness, wood, alcohol, and cooked malts. It's not exactly what I want in a barleywine, but for the English style, it's great."
"A really well done English barleywine. Definitely quite bourbon and barrel forward. With that said though, the bourbon is not overly hot or over-whelming."
""
""
"Overall this is good if you like the fresh heat and very prominent bourbon taste. Look forward to stashing one for a year or two"
""
""
""
"Firestone Walker sure knows their barrels. This is a great beer."
"Pours a cloudy, dark red brown with a root beer head, which attenuates quickly. Oak bourbon, toffee, and coconut aroma. Silky, creamy mouthfeel and just a flood of magnificent flavor. Alternating chocolate, toffee, and coconut with overarching bourbon. Finishes with a little alcohol warmth, but it's not unappealing. This is a pricy beer, but it is worth it to try."
"O-A great barrel aged barley wine. FW does it right and does it again. Good job. Will try and pick up another bottle for cellaring. I think the booze may very well drop off and the barrel aging shine through. Hope to have one again soon."
""
""
"Feel slightly guilty for reviewing this based on such a small sample, as I needed a lot more to break down the flavours, but have previously enjoyed a bottle 0f 2011 Abacus with others and this certainly aligned with my memory. A barleywine with fantastic flavours that is very good fresh."
""
""
"O: Very good stuff, I like it a lot and only have one bottle left, I doubt it will last very long"
"Overall: A very well-crafted take on the style. The barrels really highlight the malts and allow the sweetness to blend with with flavors produced by the barrels. Very solid and clean."
"The barrel program at FSW is absolutely incredible. Both Abacus and Parabola are immensely delicious. Very glad to have tried this offering from them. It's definitely up there as one of my favorite barleywines."

"Overall this is a solid brew, i look forward to trying batch 001 with a year behing it!"

"O- Great great beer, awesome mouthfeel, appearance, smell, and taste were all there and blended perfectly together"
"Overall, this is a beer that every craft beer fan should try if given the opportunity. Firestone Walker really sets the bar with their barrel fermenting/aging profile, and they are certainly masters of their craft."
"O. It's doesnt eclipse Mother of All Storms and I wont do it the disservice of comparing it to King Henry, which is really a stout as opposed to a barleywine, but Sucaba is one of the very best barleywines out there. It is hot and rife with barrel out of the box, but I am eager to see what age does to this. Excellent now, could be ridiculous later. One of my very favorites."

"D: A very well balanced and enjoyable brew. A quality brew, perfect for a relaxing evening of sipping and reading or just getting lost in thought."

""
"UPDATE 09/27/2011: Bottles are continuously falling off. Gone is the rich vanilla and dark fruit character, leaving a general sweetness with some bourbon, while the heat remains. This beer was awesome when it came out. It fell off a cliff. I will only buy 1 or 2 of the next batch, and drink those quickly."
""
""
"O- Overall, this is perhaps one of the best beers I have had, period. The craft to make this beer is truly something that needs to be appreciated. It is definitely worth a try and comes highly recommended. Cheers!!!"
""
"Drinkability: I think you need to judge each beer in the context of its style, so a high drinkability score for a barleywine doesn’t mean you can knock down a half dozen of them and then operate heavy machinery (or, perhaps, stand up). I will say, however, that this is a quite drinkable beer (and I am not typically a big fan of barleywines)."
""
""
"The body was pleasantly full, as you'd expect for the style, but managed to not be heavy or sticky. Drinkability was dangerously good, this the rare barleywine I could drink all night. Overall, an excellent example of the style. A must try if you see it and worth some effort to get."
""
"Easily the best bourbon barrel aged barleywine I've had thus far, but just a touch hotter than I remember the original Abacus being. Also quite a bit hoppier than most English barleywines, but FW once again shows their prowess at mixing classic English brewing with American creativity and flavors. I really want to try my bottle in a year or so with a good cigar, a great beer to celebrate with or just enjoy a cold night."
""
"It pours a dark brown color that reminds me of rootbeer, a thin cream/off-white colored head the leaves a little lacing. A lot of bourbon in the nose followed by wisps of vanilla, oak, caramel, and smoke. Just like in the nose bourbon is up front on the taste and with the bourbon flavor is a little alcohol heat not terrible but maybe with some aging the heat will subside a little. There is also a good caramel flavor with vanilla, and some sweet dark fruits. The mouthfeel is very thick and a coats my entire mouth and it seems to stay on my tongue after each drink. Overall I feel that is is a good beer one that I would like to revisit some time in the future."

"OVERALL: Good thing this one came in a box. An enjoyable beer, and the base beer was still able to play a role in the flavor profile despite the big barrel presence. However, this one is till too hot to be top class in my books, being much hotter than the Parabola 002 we drank immediately afterwards. Moreover, the head on this one was just atrocious, reminding me of Rice Krispies doused in Coke. Noisy and obnoxious stuff. While this was an enjoyable beer I’d drink again if it were convenient, for me, Parabola 002 was the superiorly crafted beer in a box. Thanks again for sharing Doops. Good times! As far as the $ucuba 002 goes, it's a solid brew, but nothing worth going nuts over. I would probably still score it the same, though the scores for look and feel would be reversed. Cheers!"
"Overall: A very good BA Barleywine. No longer in my Top 5 with newer BA Barleywines like King Henry, BA Naked Evil and MOAS 2011. But still a very solid beer I'd happily come back to enjoy."

"Abacus is a beer for bourbon-barrel lovers. In a way, it exceeds any descriptions I can give of it. In another, more accurate way, it is a sublime blend of rich barleywine and proud Kentucky Bourbon. There's more flavor here in the aftertaste than most beers have in their entirety. This definitely rivals the best American barrel-aged brews. Thanks Sam!"
""
""
""
"Pouring reddish brown with a thin tan head that recedes rapidly, this looks decent. The nose is great. Brown sugar, vanilla, toffee, bourbon, rich leather and a little tobacco, this is beautifully balanced all the way through. The alcohol is shockingly well-hidden, I find it hard to believe this is 13%. Some oak appears as it warms up. The palate opens mildly sweet with bourbon and brown sugar along with toffee. Mildly nutty without the associated astringency, this shows beautiful balance and complexity. Leather and pipe tobacco are present, especially on the finish. Some oak with nice tannins to balance the sweetness on the finish. The barrel is remarkably well-integrated here, it's a very harmonious beer. Surprisingly refreshing for a 13% barleywine, this is easily the best fresh barleywine I've had."
""
""
""
"Pours a dark cola-esque brown that lets some light through. A brief head diminishes with some medium sized bubbles. Smell is heavy on the booze, a strong overwhelming dose of bourbon. First impression is a strong sweetness upfront, but not sickly sweet. If finishes with bourbon, but very smoothly. Mouthfeel is creamy and perfect for this beer. Lightly hopped, they take a backseat to the sweetness and bourbon."
"Very tasty; a little sweet and boozy but the flavors are definitely there! Gets a little smoother as it warms."

"A unique and worthy English Barleywine, I would recommend trying this one. Curious to see how it ages, probably pretty nicely in my opinion."
""
" This is the newest version, 2012 Sucaba. Earlier review was Abacus and there is a difference...to me at least. This version was just thinner all the way around. The caramel and vanilla didn't come alive and laid somewhat dormant. This is tough to rate b/c it's still a great beer, but I feel it has lost something that aging in the bottle just won't improve."

"O: This beer really is close to perfect, leans towards a perfect English style barleywine with barrel notes on top. Quite impressive."

"O: One of the most enjoyable Barleywines I've had to date."
""
""
"D/O- Well hidden alcohol, doesn't drink its 13%abv. Top tier barleywine although I've had better. Worth a try if you can get it!"
""
"Pretty much full bodied; fairly coating, too. Decent shot of carbonation keeps the beer from becoming tiresome. Finishes sugary with a touch of vanilla and oak."
""
""
""
"Overall: An absolutely stunning beer, one of my all time favorites. I will have to make a concerted effort to get a whole lot more of this!"
""
"Full bodied, low carbonation, chewy, and the alcohol is well hidden for 13.00 %. A nice solid Barleywine."

"O - Overall a nice sweet Barleywine that has some BA aspects, especially the spicyness that shines through. A nice offering from Firestone walker and excited to try a few more by them."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - overall, pretty good, but not amazing. Extremely drinkable. Ranked 2 out of 6 in our blind tasting."
""
""
"D - pretty solid barrel aged barleywine. A lot of the flavors are masked by the vanilla bourbon barrel aging, which is good and bad. Good thing I bought a couple of these for aging as there still was a decent amount of heat. Recommended!"
"Overall: This is not one of those beers that has nearly infinite separate components; it is a relatively simple beer that is made impressively well. The bourbon really accentuates the wonderful flavors and adds some complexity itself."
""
""
""
" Body is rich but still a little thin for such a strong beer. The flavor is carried pretty well, but the super strong brew goes down a little too easy without a robust mouthfeel. Still, this is a thoroughly enjoyable offering, and I highly recommend seeking it out."
""
"O - This beer is very much a booze bomb. Its one of the hottest beers I've ever had, but it works the same that a fine bourbon or scotch works. You just sip and enjoy the deep complexity. Its very english with a strong and chewy toffee aroma and flavor that seems to meld right into strong bourbon barrel notes. This remains to be a top three barleywine for me."

"Far from ""fallen off"" this is as good as it was 8 months ago when I had it last."
"Awesome and amazing. Deep earth brownish red, almost garnet. Tiny, tiny carb bubbles rise to the top. Loose carbonation makes an apperance but eventually retreats leaving the surface unblemished. Sweet bourbon, rich burnt caramel, crystal malts and toasted oak assault your nose in a great way. Just a great woody, malty bourbon bomb. As expected the taste is in lock step with the nose. Wood (oak), sweet malty caramel, brown sugar bourbon, hit of vanilla, tasting a touch of booze, good times. Pretty full bodied and lightly syrupy. Slightly sweet at the end. Great. So, so, sad I don't have any more of these gems to see how they are in a year or so."

"O: I enjoyed this, but it was very sweet. It is incredibly complex, but unfortunately it doesn't live up to the hype I heard about it. I would love to try this again."

"Overall: This is my kind of beer. Lots of great barleywine (I would guess the base beer is delicious on its own) and oak bourbon barrel flavors. Hope I don't miss the 2012 version in February."
""
""
""
"O: This is really a brilliant beer. Truth be told, I forgot that this was a bourbon-barrel aged beer until I got a whiff of the aroma...and I was a little bummed. I don't seem to have the appreciation for bourbon-barrel aged beers that some others do. But it was so complimentary to the other flavors that were going on in this beer, that I didn't find it at all offensive as I normally do. In fact, this may have changed my opinion on bourbon-barrel aged beers. One of few beers that have opened my eyes recently. A fun take on a Barleywine."

"Top notch oak aged barleywine from FW. Very balanced, great flavor and an even better mouthfeel."

"Overall: This is an excellent beer. But, following up a Pelican MoaS, it really fell short of that bar. That speaks more to the MoaS than it does to the Abacus though. A touch on the boozy side for my liking, and we're about 7 months old at this point. I also had a bottle fresh and don't notice a discernible difference to my memory."

"2012 vintage (enjoyed June 2014): Some of the flavors have mellowed/receded, esp. the richness that you get fresh. Consequently, the sweetness comes out a bit more, but the booze has mellowed as well. This is still delicious and even more drinkable."
""
"6/9/2011"
"Life is good when one of these are at hand."
"(D)- Age has done some very interesting things to this. Still rich, sweet, and powerful, but far more smoother, balanced and integrated from what I remember on tap. I look forward to what further time does to this, though I think this was at its best, fresh and on tap."

"Bottle @ home, courtesy of foppa78 into my new Cigar City snifter, courtesy of markwise. Thanks guys! 2011 vintage. Very deep brown/ruby appearance with a tiny tin head that dissipates in no time. Really a nice, smooth, tobacco, fig, plum, caramel-toffee malty, somewhat sweet aroma that’s exquisite. Tobacco, date, plum, fig, dark fruity, moderate toffee, lighter caramel, fairly malty, bourbon, somewhat woody flavor. Dark fruity, cherry, plum, toffee aftertaste. No hint of the 13% booze- are you kidding me??? In a way, it kind of reminds me of HOTD Matt in its complexity. Simply unbelievable."
"O-- Thought much better fresher when I first had it. The barrel notes far more obvious in the nose then. Just starting to develop the jam like qualities that barlewines have. Careful cellaring might be really good for the beer, though I preferred the fresher version much more. Odd balance of strawberry and bourbon now than not sure I really like."
"I'm glad I have some more of this. A top 5 brew for me, in my book."
"D - Check please!"
"Notes: Usually I detest bourbon barreled barleywines, but this one is stellar. The integration, the marriage of wood and beer, is just perfect. I think this is better than Parabola (shhh....) Well done FW."
"This is an elite english style barleywine, my preferred style of barleywine. Large toffee notes with loads of sweetness and some nice dryness from the oak."
"O: Quite the enjoyable beer. Big, boozy, sweet... Some of my most enjoyable characteristics of beers that get it right. FW delivers yet another winner. If these bottles ever get up to Portland, I'll be buying some more. I'd recommend anybody who see's these to buy, buy,buy. 4.5/5"
"O. Excellent, #1 or #2 Barrel aged Barley wine in my book, can't get enough of it and have plenty of this in the cellar."
"O- What a treat it is to drink this beer. A skillfully crafted beer this is very complex and a pleasure to sip on throughout the night. Glad I have a few more to try for the long Chicago winter ahead of me."
"Overall, one of the most enjoyable beers I've ever had. A shining example of the level of flavor that can be achieved through the use of bourbon barrels. Delicious."
"O= Overall, I would say this is a very good barleywine and was perfect for a cold Oct. night. This is definitely a sipping beer and gets better as it warms up."
"O- Pretty exceptional beer."
"Pours a deep amber to black in color with a light tan head. In the aroma, bourbon, vanilla, and oak. In the taste, mellow bourbon, and notes of dark fruit, oak, vanilla, and alcohol. A small bite, however mainly smooth, with a medium to bigger bodied mouthfeel, and a dryer alcohol and oaky aftertaste. Big bourbon, although the aftertaste is lacking, but fantastic otherwise."
"Overall a really good barleywine. Really sweet, great for slow sipping on a cold October night."
"A bottle to share a beer to savor. A treat any time you have the chance."
"Dark mahogany color. Strong nose. Lots of vanilla and caramel, bourbon, alcohol. Tastes very good. Vanilla and carmel, quite a bit of bourbon. Nice balance. The bourbon doesn't dominate to dissipate the flavors from the barleywine. Very creamy and full. Slightly carbonated, possibly over carbonated IMO. Overall this was very good. I love that it is balanced and that the bourbon doesn't dominate. My main quarrel with BA barleywines is that the oak and bourbon take away from the flavors of the beer itself. This is nice."
"I poured from a bomber into a snifter, dark black pour with a slight white head, light lacing. The aroma has notes of oak , and vanilla, and a ton of dark fruit. The beer was definitely fruity(figs and dates), oak, vanilla, and a pleasant amount of booziness. It has a lingering fruity finish. The beer is full bodied, nice carbonatin and easy drinking for the ABV. An exceptional brew."
"O - A slight let down. The nose is pretty one dimensional, and the alcohol is detected pretty easily. Definitely not the best BA English Barleywine, but pretty good."
"Taste is amazing, smooth and crisp, not boozy at all, butterscotch all day on the finish, it's rich and complex, dark fruits and candidate sugar flavors, oaky vanilla notes as well, very good."
"Overall this is a fantastic beer, defiantly the best barleywine I've had to date."
"O - Definitely a amazing sipper. Im not a Hard Liquor guy, but if I ever was, this would be my go to beer. I'm gonna cellar one of these as well, however I don't think i'll make it till then. Get you hands on one of these! They're amazing. Top 5 beer for sure! Cheers!"
"Easily the best barleywine I've had to date, and another fantastic offering from FW. I'd suggest pciking it up while you can (still see some bottles floating around in SE PA)... cheers"
"Abacus is a barrel aged Barley Wine. Four barrels in total were selected for the blend. The base of this year’s offering was aged in Heaven Hill bourbon barrels for 3 years! The resulting beer is strong yet extremely elegant and smooth. Big boozy bourbon and American oak aromas combined with soft chocolate malty undertones. Complex malt flavors framed in oak, with hints of dark chocolate, vanilla, tobacco, coconut and just a touch of dark cherry. This is definitely a sipping beer and one of my favorite barleywines next to Old Numbskull."
"this was a delicious barleywine, much better than i anticipated."
"I suppose you can't judge a beer by its nose. What at first seemed like a potential letdown turned out to be an excellent barleywine. Though they're obviously quite different styles of beer, Abacus and Parabola are both very barrel-dominant - I think this is the more successful of the two, as the imparted flavors complement the base beer very well. I'll be curious to see if this improves down the road."
"Overall very good."
"This beer ranged from a let down to quite good. I had very high hopes for this one though, and it turns out that it didn't quite live up to them. Still though, this is an enjoyable beer."
"O: A fantastic barrel aged barley wine that was very much enjoyed. Would love to come back to it with a little bit of age. The alcohol was strong, but that is to be expected. One of the better barrel aged barley wines I have had."
"This one pours a nice and rich cherried wood in color with a light and fizzy khaki colored head which quickly dissipated. The aromas consist of sweet and ripe dark fruits, figs, light bourbon, oak, vanilla, raisins, and port. It smells pretty good but I could use more bourbon. The flavors are almost exactly what I was looking for tonight. You get a lot of buttery biscuity malt (yet not as intense as a California Chardonnay), light bourbon, oak, vanilla, raisins, figs, and it has a rich and resonating after taste. The bourbon is a little more mellow than I anticipated but it's fine. Overall this is a fine beer and a pretty spectacular barrel aged barleywine. It's an instant favorite and probably my second favorite of the style to only the Mother of All Storms."
"Overall: A delicious barleywine that I was glad to have shared with a couple of friends. At 13%, it would have admittedly been a challenge to finish by myself. I can see why so many BA's rave about this one, and look forward to trying it again after it's been laid down for 3 or so more years."
"The mouthfeel is on the heavier side with carbonation being below average. It has a creaminess to it that really works well for it. Overall it was a fantastic beer, and probably the best of the style I've had. MOAS was great, but I liked this one a little more. It was so flavorful, smooth, and everything just works so well together. Fantastic beer overall, I loved it."
"Overall, this is a good beer but I think it may have spent a little too much time in the barrel for my personal tastes. I look for a spirit barrel to be part of a beer, not take it over. And unfortunately for me, that was not the case here. If you like you bal aged beers to be bal forward, this is your stuff."
"Overall, a very tasty beer - sweet and boozy, but not overwhelmingly so. A lovely slow sipper."
"O: So glad I traded for a 2nd bottle. Now I have another one to try somewhere down the road."
" Pours a brilliant brown w/ orange highlights and a sliver of a chocolate head. Very little carbonation or lacing, which is expected at a 13% ABV beer. Excellent for the style. Very port-like in appearance. Nose is nothing short of amazing! Malt, chocolate, toffee, some faint fruit, and very mild alcohol smell, oak. bourbon. There's no way the nose gets any better than it is. Wow. Taste is very similar profile. Unbelievable! It's so smooth and drinkable I can't believe it's a 13% beer. Alcohol is almost completely masked in the taste. This is truly one of the best beers I've ever had the privilege of tasting. If you have the opportunity to try this, RUN, don't walk, and pick up as much as you can fit in your car. Undoubtedly a world class beer, and I'm glad I had the opportunity to try it. Cheers!"
"O: This lived up to my expectations indeed. I've read the threads about this fading and I just laughed as I was drinking this. To me it was great and the combination of flavors, especially the barrel qualities, really did this for me. I'm glad I've got some more in the cellar."
"Started strong, but faded a bit as it warmed; still a keeper"
"O: This is one of those beers that I didn’t really expect to love; big, boozy, sugar-bombs (i.e., DFH 120 Minute, Founders Devil Dancer, GI Night Stalker) just don’t sit well with me. This beer, though, has such a delicate approach to those flavors – I could really drink it all day. It isn’t my absolute favorite brew, or anything that I think I'd be craving, but it really is a gorgeous beer. Great job, Firestone-Walker – this is an incredible barleywine!"
"It's so dense and sweet, but the sweetness doesn't ruin it like it does some brews. A truly exceptional beer and one I wish I had regular access to."
"Mouthfeel/Overall: Body is between medium and full, and gets exponentially smoother as the beer warms towards room temperature. I have heard several people mention that there is a lot of variation in Abacus bottles; I will agree with this. I have had one other bottle before this and was not nearly as impressed. Interested to see how the others I have turn out. Overall though, this is an exemplary barrel aged barleywine. Very complex and well integrated flavors."
"O: If I could get my hands on another bottle, I would see if aging it would help with the heat v.s. sweetness battle that seemed to be raging on my tongue, but it sure was a treat to have this one to drink just the way it was."
"Sweet enough to land you in a bathtub by the end of the night."
"SkÅL!"
"It pours deep brown, almost black as you watch it come out of the bottle, and it develops about a centimeter of cream/white head that consists of large bubbles. There is little retention, which is not surprising given the alcohol content. It smells wonderfully of caramel, toffee, toasted malt, some dark fruits (raisin, date), bourbon, and some faintly bitter hops. Very good first impression. The taste is great: hazelnut, toffee, toasted malt, caramel, and bourbon dominate. Some alcohol is detectable, as are some oak flavors and some muddled, floral hops. Mouthfeel is very smooth, albeit thick, and the carbonation helps it slide off the tongue. There is a lingering warmness from the alcohol. Overall, an amazing barleywine that easily ranks amongst my all-time favorites."
"O- This well blended beer has some rich malt notes and bourbon notes that come through when it opens up but everything takes on a 1 dimensional character. It is a nice barleywine."
"Tried this again in 2012, somehow improved and delicious!"
"O- Fired up to have finally cracked this bottle, need to get more."
"Lots of reviewers I trust like this beer, and it sounds like something I'd love, a bourbon heavy barleywine. Oh well. At least I didn't trade for a case. (I have two more that are sitting in the cellar for at least 3 years.)"
"Overall, I really enjoyed this beer, my first try from Firestone Walker. I am excited that there are two more of these sitting in my closet to age."
"O - Good beer. Doesn't seem to be too bad, but I haven't had it fresher, so, no way of knowing."
"Overall - The best barleywine I've had. Bourbon is the bacon of beer. It makes everything better."
"Appearance 3/5; Aroma 3.5/5; Taste 3.5/5; Mouthfeel 3.5/5; Overall 4/5"
"Pours a nice dark brown color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy light tan head, with sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, bourbon, slight chocolate/toffee. The taste is malty, slightly sweet, lots of bourbon, chocolate/toffee. Medium Body. OK, this is not an English Barleywine, since when do barleywines have bourbon in it."
"O - Great beer, this and Bourbon Angels Share are neck and neck for me."
"O- I am really impressed with this brew, all the good reviews I’ve heard have been true, well balanced, big complex flavors, every sip is a delicious and different, I cannot wait to age this bad boy and see the difference down the road."
"Overall a really nice experience. I can only imagine the way I'll feel at the end of this goblet!"
"O: Overall, this is what a Barley Wine should taste like in my opinion. World Class!"
"O - I actually am not a big barleywine fan but have tried to appreciate the quality types (like Old Ruffian). This is about the best I've had. I am finding FW to be a personal favorite brewery."
"Overall, I love this and it's the best barleywine I've ever had. If it was easier to find I would buy it by the case even at $15 a bottle. Can't wait to see what a bit of age does to this"
"I'm thinking my second bottle will need about a year on it before I consider a revisit. It is very well blended but I'd like to see mellowing out of the alcohol particularly on the finish. Great stuff, so far it's my #1 in this style."
"Appearance is a dark copper color with an off-white head, not very tall. Taking in the nose of this barleywine is something else, there is quite a bit going on, all of it quite pleasant. I noticed coconut, cherry, vanilla, bourbon and caramel. Taking a sip and I taste brown sugar, caramel, more vanilla, brandy and well toasted marshmallow. MF is fairly creamy with an aftertaste of alcohol, ie some brandy and bourbon. If you come across this in bottle or on-tap, this is a fantastic barleywine."
"Overall, this was an experience to say the least. Crazy complex Barley Wine that I can't compare to anything I have ever had because it was so unique. Definitely delicious and well recommended if you like barley wines and/or bourbon. Bourbon barrel definitely plays a significant role but it is so well integrated that boozy is not a fair term. This is meant to be sipped and savored (and more appropriately shared, even though for my first time around here I did not)."
"O - Really enjoyed this one for the first time. Would love to see what a couple of years does to this one. Lower alcohol burn would definitely give this one higher marks in my opinion."
"O: What can I say? Firestone's Reserve Series should be crowned! Get this beer!!! I'm out!"
"O: Just an amazingly rich and bold beer with complex and well integrated flavors. I enjoyed this whole bottle over the course of a couple hours and savored every sip!"
"O: Amazingly good!"
"O- This is like drinking a lower abv Gentlemans Jack Daniels. There's still enough elements to to remind you that this is beer. I let this sit for three months and couldn't wait. I say if you love bourbon, drink right away. If you want that flavor to mellow and tasteore like a beer, let it sit for at least six months. Still, this is an excellent barleywine."
"O - What a great beer. Delicious, rich, and bold, another top-notch beer from Firestone Walker."
"O- This is perfect! Absolutely perfect! I can't imagine a Bourbon Barrel Barleywine topping this... but I'll be sure to try all that I can get my hands on! This is Heaven and Hell in a glass... Sin and seduction, Beauty and the Beast!!! Every taste that you smell becomes history ... and every smell that you taste becomes a memory... I will remember this forever!"
"Overall is probably the best Barley Wine I've ever had. Quickly becoming my new favorite brewery."
"This was the first of the I had tried by this brewery so it's fairly new in Philadelphia. I didn't know much about them ahead of time so basically just bought this out of curiosity. This beer poured black with a thin white head. The aroma was very sweet with notes of vanilla, plum, and burnt sugar. The taste was a little more mellow than expected, not as cloyingly sweet as I thought it would be after smelling the beer. The mouthfeel was very creamy and woody with a nice alcohol burn on the finish. The wood masked some of the assertiveness seen in most barleywines and instead added a lot of complexity to it. I couldn't imagine drinking more than one since my palate was totally exhausted when I was done. This beer was a bit pricey, but it was worth every penny. It was definitely one of the best barleywines I've ever had and I can't wait to try more from this brewery."
"mouthfeel - incredibly smooth. for such a fresh barleywine its drinking so well. tasty little fellow"
"O: One of the best two or three beers I have tried this year. It is different than FW Anniversary 14 but just as enjoyable. I don't tell myself to go out and buy too many $15.99 bombers, but this is one I am going to try to find a couple more of to lay down for 4-5 years. A superb barrel-aged beer. Nice job FW. Highly recommended."
"Note: I love this beer, but I prefer it on tap vs bottle. I think it should also be served around 40-45 degrees and slowly sipped as it warms up. The spectrum of flavor is amazing !"
"O - An amazing brew. Hand down one of my all time favorites. If anyone wants some, let me know. I believe everyone should try Sucaba at some point in their life. Beyond recommended."
"One of the best barrel aged barleywines I have ever tried. Top 5 for sure. Just a great beer."
"Medium body, lighter carbonation. Some warmth, but not overly hot. Great range of flavors here. What a fantastic beer."
"Overall: One of the best barleywines that i have had! Firestone Walker does an impressive job with barrell aged beers!"
"O: aside from this brew being a touch on the hot side, it is an excellent pairing of Barleywine and bourbon barrel. The malt holds up to barrel character and the hints of smoke make for a unique experience."
"3.5 D: Totally disappointed. I loved the hell out of Parabola and thought this would be the barleywine version of that. It isn't. Not quite sure how this is getting the scores it does. Maybe bottle variation. Who knows? Not confident this will age well, but I have another bottle and I'm going to give it a go."
"O - A really nice beer. The barrel doesn't dominate but makes its presence known. Crazy smooth for the ABV. I mean 13% really? I would never know. A really nice BA Barleywine for sure. Not the very top of its class but does belong near the top."
"-GFunk"
"Cheers..."
"A great sipping/dessert beer. Bravo."
"Narrative: Tyler Folsom was a nice person. Sure he was a 4 sport athlete, donated time on weekends to explicitly blind orphans, adopted 5 shelter cats, ran makeshift sickle cell anemia cure test centers in his garage, and had a laundry list of acceptance letters to a litany of schools, but, he was a nice guy. Some would say that he had too much on his plate. He never knew what was going on with Pretty Little Liars, his record collection was woefully wanting for a 17 year old guy, but somehow, his rough translations from Aramaic to Latin to hexidecimal for a new kernel that he was debugging made it all worth it. “Oh sure, we could run scripts under English syntax, if you want spaghetti loops in your DLLs!” He exclaimed in a rare moment of tension while nursing a Koala deftly. “But ultimately, if the kids don’t eat, I don’t eat.” He meant this literally. He had adopted Peter Singer’s theory of ethics and regularly starved himself for days on end, still outperforming all other student athletes. “It’s basically just about being a NICE GUY.” He noted as he put the finishing touches on his double fermented 4Loko batch that was 0 calorie and 0 carb, a gift for his friends for an upcoming soiree against teen inebriation."
"Overall this beer was worth the wait. I am very happy that I have another one to cellar for awhile. I am sure that it will only grow in complexity over time. Everyone should do whatever they can to get ahold of one or better two, or three...you get the idea. Thanks to matttYCE for picking this up for me before it was sold out."
"The hops dont really show up anywhere and this is driven by the malt profile. I enjoy it and wish I had a 2nd bottle for aging."
"D: This was a fantastic barleywine with huge bourbon influence, but great hops and malts too. The scent and taste were clean, bold, and complex while the body was wonderfully huge. The alcohol was hidden decently for its strength, so I had to use some restraint to sip instead of gulping this treat. It could age well, I'm sure, but it was excellent fresh. A top beer that meets the hype."
"Pours a clouded deep amber brown with a light, thin head. Aromas of vanilla, oak barrel, sweet caramel, biscuit, dark fruits and moderately phenolic. Flavor is sweet toast, toffee, caramel, dark fruits, oak barrel, vanilla and significantly phenolic. Mouthfeel is chunky and thick with moderate to light carbonation. Overall barrel plays a big factor here in a very nice beer."
"Overall a very flavorful experience. Intensely fruity and boozy. Dark fruit, oak, and alcohol heat come on strong. A wonderful beer."
"Thanks to my local beer bar 38 degrees for having this on tap!"
"Good, so much, almost to big and complex."
"Now, to conclude, let's talk about balance. This beer is still relatively fresh. Bourbon and alcohol heat this recent from the barrel should be more overpowering. It's pretty mellow. one year, maybe a year and 1/2 should be about the perfect age I'd imagine with this. Well done FW. You've nailed the Barrel aging program above all else I'd say. (Although I've yet to open my BCBSRare) but until then, I'll give you the nod. Well freaking done!"
"An incredible barrel aged barleywine. The aroma is one of a kind and out of this world, while the flavor is close behind! Bravo!"
"Overall - I can count on this beer at all times..."
"O- Absolutely amazing beer! The flavors come alive and have a beautiful blend that can only be described as wow. Can't wait to see what this tastes like in a year or two."
"O: Pretty good. Not outstanding, but instead a solid beer."
"O: I think this is a nearly exceptional barley wine. I might pick up a few more just to age them, but I have less than high expectations for this to continue to excel. It will either thin out and fail to build the smooth feel I really appreciate from good BW's, but then again, you never know. I'm nearly on the fence with this. It's good, but not terrific."
"O: Very tasty overall beer. I thoroughly enjoyed this and wish it wasn't $18 a bottle and extremely rare. Glad I got to try it on my birthday."
"O: I'm drinking this side by side with Parabola, and I have to say, I think I like it better. But maybe not. Great beer regardless."
"If tasting this blind, I probably would not say ""barleywine", but never mind. This is a treat."
"O - This to me is an amazing barleywine. Great job of kicking the tastes up to extreme levels yet keeping the body restrained a bit to account for the barleywine. This beer is coming in a little hot right now, and should be amazing with about 1-2 years on this, but I for one welcome that bourbon. Love the lingering taste and complexity."
"Wow what can I say? A beautiful tawny brown, garnet highlights, and a slight beige head that lifted exceptional aromas of figs, currants, a heavy caramel back, and vanilla. Touch of woodiness is apparent in the background but the vanilla is all over the palate. A very balanced mix of dark fruits and malt complements the sweet vanilla. Carbonation is perfect; it melds the rich body of the beer and the sweetness into a smooth and velvety feel. A strong sipper that renders the unwary into a head trip. Delicious."
"O: I liked this one a lot more when it warms up. Lots of different flavors intermixing that make this one a fun evening."
"Overall -- Pretty damn good. The flavors seemed well-integrated, but man is this beer hot right now. Give this a few years and I'm sure this will be drinking magnificently."
"12/18/11 this beer has lost some richness of caramel flavors and toffee, the heat has not faded out at all, and lost some depth. This one was best fresh, Fo Sho. I still have 3 more bottle to drink, will report any further changes."
"Overall: I love barral aged beers, and this one ranks up there with the best. Firestone Walker does some amazing stuff with barrals."
"All pretentious beer reviewing aside, here's my plain old opinion: I go with barelywines in the fall almost as a rule just because of the intense alcohol and full bodied flavor. I'm almost afraid of when the 13% catches up to me because frankly I don't taste it. This is just a fantastic brew hands down. Highly recommended to even those who aren't into the ""bourbon aging"" or ""barleywine"" scene."
" Overall just superb!"
"The taste was an incredibly balanced blend rich toffee, caramel, molasses, slight cherry and bourbon laden toasty malt. This is definitely one of the most well-rounded barrel aged barleywines I've ever sampled. The mouthfeel was exceptionally smooth and creamy, full bodied with light carbonation. The 13% ABV provides a hearty warmth to the finish, but it is by no means overpowering or out of place. Overall, this is an incredible brew."
"O- Had this BadBoy twice with different results. The first time, the smell and taste completely blew me away. It was a perfectly crafted beer. I had this again a few days later and it was totally different. The smell was the same but the taste was dominated with alcohol and it only intensified as the beer warmed. I'm going to try this again in the future and re-review it. As of now, this is still a must drink beer if you haven't tried it yet."
"9/3/11: 4/4/4.5/4.5/4.5"
"O: I’m glad I got this review out of the way. I’ve got several more bottles of this that I can now sit back and enjoy and share with others, but I’ll probably wait till the cooler months. Can’t wait!"
"Overall, Firestone Walker always impresses me with their brews. Another offering that I just love. This one will definitely age with the best of them. I can only see this beer gaining in complexity over time."
"I suppose this is the only bottled ""Abacus"" we'll ever see. Looking forward to what it's called next year."
"O- A really outstanding beer, I've never really had anything like this. There's enough going on to keep the bottle changing and interesting the entire time. I bought two bottles and can't wait to break out the second one in a few years."
"O: Very good barleywine, which tatses less than the actual ABV, but leaves you feeling nice once the glass is finished. overall a good specimen, would definately try again!"
"Overall, this is a fine, fine beer, no doubt. It's a great example in my mind of how bourbon barrels can enhance rather than overshadow a good base beer. That said, for the price I'd probably rather buy a 6 pack of Bell's Third Coast Old Ale. But as an occasional splurge, this is pretty great."
"O: One of the best bourbon barrel barleywines out there."
"Big thanks goes out to mikesgroove for sharing this one during Hobo Tasting #9! Served from bottle into a Duck-Rabbit snifter. Poured a deep dark brown with a half finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, caramel, and booze. The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus, caramel, dark chocolate, and alcohol. It had a heavy feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. The booziness on this one definitely started to show its face as it warmed up. A very nice flavor on this one. I was worried I wouldn't like this one as much based on the aroma alone, but the flavor was very nice in comparison. Really glad I got the opportunity to tick this one!"
"Thanks given2flybrewing!"
"T: There's so much going on. I'm speechless. Great, rich mouthfeel with notes of vanilla, caramel, coconut, toffee and butterscotch. There's a slight warmness, but this hides the alcohol pretty well. By far the best barleywine I've ever had and one of the best beers I've had, period. Absolutely worth a try if you can find it."
"O - Fantastic barleywine, probably best I've had so far. Strong flavor that is not too offensive."
"O: It's hard to describe how much I'm enjoying this beer. A great beer from Firestone. I'm glad they finally bottled it. I'm going to be searching for more."
"O: I had high hopes for this beer and while it gets a good rating, I was hoping for just a touch more sweetness and a little less bourbon. By comparison, Alpine Great blows this away in terms of sweetness and complexity."
"Overall this is one of the best tasting and and well balanced beers I've had up to this point. The barrel aging takes it to another dimension. As opposed to dominating, the bourbon serves as the ultimate compliant. Rich, smooth and absolutely delectable. Simply stunning on every level."
"Truly impressed by this beer."
"O: delicious and complex, i'd love to come back to this one in say 10 years."
"O- very nice complex beer. Nise and taste is big and is very nice."
"Overall/notes - I can't be a Jedi, because tonight I experienced a love so passionate that I can't describe it. Lovely beer all around, with only one or two equaling it, and none surpassing. This goes well a good, dark cigar that sweats. Recommended on those special days where you feel as if your life is going in the perfect direction. My God."
"This is a bold fruity alcohol forward barleywine that is hurt a bit in drinkability. It is medium bodied and modestly carbonated. Clearly a decent representation of the American style with it's modest hop inclusion. The alcohol is not hiding in this brew at all, it is forward in both flavor and warming factor. It is a solid brew but I was let down a bit. Perhaps my anticipation and hype built this brew up to something more magnificent than it ever could be. Oh well. I have wanted to try this beer for some 2+ years since I first heard about it. Along the way I got to try a small draft sample and that just didnt satisfy my curiosity. I just about gave up hope of ever getting a real taste (since it was at the time draft only.) Then the announcement came that it was going to be bottled. Perhaps a bit fresh at the moment, I intend to revisit this one with some age."
"Overal this has got to be the best barleywine that I have had to date, the mouthful is so creamy and wonderful!"
"This beer keeps getting better with age. Very complex, very impressed!!!"
"A good BA barleywine but I've definitely had better. This is the second time I've had it (first time I've had it as the first beer of the night) and I think it could definitely benefit from a little aging. As it is now, one person would definitely have some work to do to make it through the whole bottle. Even sharing this with someone else is taking awhile to drink. Not really readily available but I managed to get a few bottles from downtown."
"Pours a very attractive deep brown color with a medium sized tan/brown head. A wonderful nose of barrel, caramel, vanilla, maple syrup, candy sweet malts and a gentle waft of alcohol. Full bodied, creamy and incredibly easy to drink for its size. Worth the hype, absolutely. Easily my new favorite in the barrel aged BW style."
"D/O - Drinkability is moderately high. This beer is interesting as the bourbon doesn't punch you in the face, but the 13% at the end sort of does. While the fruits really take this to a new level, the combination of them with the solvent alcohol burn at the end is a bit of a turnoff. Still, it's a great beer that has a nice barrel-aged profile, but don't be surprised when this beer bites back."
"Overall- This is a very good beer. A great winter weather sipper. I assume it will get thicker and sweeter as it ages. I guess I will find out, though. Firestone Walker does it again. 4.5"
"pours a dark brown, not glass or shine to it, a little ugly, a light beige head, good retention and lacing... the aroma is decent, not as good as I as expecting, can’t really tell it was barrel-aged at all, molasses mostly, a hint of hops... again can’t really tell this is barrel-aged, a little bourbon, lots of chocolate, caramel, and vanilla, hoppy bourbon finish... good not the greatness I was expecting"
"O: This is a monster of a Barleywine. The alcohol is there but really pretty subdued. Great to be able to buy this off the shelf in the Chi!"
"If this is what Firestone can do with a barrel-aged barleywine, then my anticipation for Parabola is spiking into the stratosphere. I enjoy the anniversary blends, but I think beers like this really showcase this brewery's mastery of the barrels."
"A brown liquid with a reddish tint. Less than half a finger of slightly off white head. Nose is malty with caramel and toffee notes. Obviously it's a barleywine so carbonation is non existent. Taste is right on with the smell. Big toffee and caramel notes. Almost like a coconut on the finish. Basically a tasty damn liquid candy bar. Very happy to try this."
"This beer is very dark and has a minimal head. It leaves no lacing or legs. Not that impressive, but who the hell cares how this beer looks. The aroma is great, dark fruits, caramel, toffee, coffee, chocolate, and oak. There is a slight alcohol burn, but it is not too apparent. The taste too is great. Surprisingly light and nuanced for such a big beer. Great oak / bourbon presence. Good chocolate, caramel, molasses, and toffee flavor. Firestone Walker really knows how to use -bal aging to enhance a beer instead of taking it over. Mouthfeel is smooth and approximately medium bodied. Mild sweetness, but nothing that overwhelms the palate. Drinking a whole bomber of this by myself was not as difficult as I thought it might be. Does not get heavy or cloying. Really well made beer."
"Not bad. Aromas were wonderful, taste was a bit too hot and one sided, but still pretty good."
"drinkability: love beers that blow you away liek this, what a treat!"
"O - Very complex and unique. I could not stop from going back for more."
"Overall, really awesome beer. Very impressed with this one as it did live up to the hype. Pretty drinkable as well. A very tasty treat."
"an outstanding ba barleywine for sure!"
"Overall an interesting beer that stretches the barleywine style. Flavors are very strong and make you notice them. The alcohol takes away from the experience and definitely needs to be toned down."
"At The Lark having a beer sampler my favorite is Firestone Walker Abacus.  13% ABV really good with caramel taste and aroma.  Dark color with a creamy white head. An excellent barleywine. Unexpectedly good taste, flavor, mouthfeel, and aroma. Who would of thought I would have liked a barleywine style beer."
"O - Excellent barleywine, in my book. The smooth alcohol, sugars, and sweetness were just right for me. I can't believe how smooth this is right out of the gate. Looking forward to seeing how this one ages. Recommend."
"I’m very torn on this one. I usually like a challenging barleywine and this is so smooth and easy, especially for a beer with 13% abv. There’s a very strong warming but it’s very pleasant without a trace of burning. The flavor is strong and clear all the way to the end but it’s hard to call it really complex. It’s not a chore to finish nor difficult aside from the abv but it did get almost boring. Fantastic as a single glass so the bottle is definitely something to share. It certainly wasn’t as deep or dark as “Black Swan” (my movie pairing of choice) but it is certainly as mentally debilitating."
"Wow what a great beer. Pours a dark tawny port with the faintest wisp of a head which quickly departs, poured this gem at about 55 degrees into a tulip. The nose hits you with a complex mix of rum soaked raisins, figs, buttery caramel, rich toffee, slightly smoked oaky vanilla with a classic fortified wine oxidized/rancio note, really impressed. The taste brings a mouthfilling richness with almond roca, toasted coconut candy, dark caramel and finishes with a satisifying mouthcoating oilyness and just enough carbonation. There is a slight note of alcohol at the end but for being 13% it is barely perceptible at that degree. I really wanted to like this beer before i opened it and often i think i set myself up for failure with such high expectations, abacus though did not let me down."
"Overall:I really enjoyed this beer, it's really well balanced, and a great sipper. It reminds me a lot of sipping on a nice bourbon. I believe this one should age really well."
"O: One of the best barleywines ever, this is absolutely fantastic!"
"Overall: Solid beer. Not quite sure why there is all the hype around this beer, its not bad but not the best barleywine I have had by any stretch of the imagination. Given the ingredients and the taste this should certainly be classified as an English Barleywine. I can have a good quantity of a lot of different beers but there is no way in hell I would be able to finish a whole bomber of this one in one sitting."
"Overall: I bought some bottles, I can't wait to compare. I wish I could have bought a whole glass."
"O: This one is tough to rate. The nose and taste are amazing...2nd only to MoaS in my experience. The carbonation issues detract from the beer slightly though. I also think this is more of an English Barleywine than American...unless the barrel aging has significantly muted the hops. Still damn tasty and I'm glad I have a few more to drink over the next year."
"Aging a few, can't wait to try the next!"
"Edit from 3/14. Bier Stein recently had a 4 year vertical in honor of the 2014 release. The best of the bunch was easiiy the 2011, though none of the years were exactly awful. The current rating is based on my review of that vintage, now that it's 4 years old."
"O: This will be great with age. Said the same about FW 14th, we'll see about that. Looking forward to having a bottle in 2 years or so."
"O: A good beer, really enjoyed it on the second run and I'm looking forward to my next chance to have it. Very solid, get this one if you can (easier now with expanded production). (originally 4.0)"
"Mouthfeel is smooth and slick with a bit of coating left in the mouth after sips. Body is between medium and full and is just enough to hold up the taste. Drinkability is fine, but the finish is so rich and fully flavored that it gets tough to down after a bit. Still, great beer."
"O - Firestone continues to impress with their Reserve series. Parabola was and still is one of my favorite beers, and this one is almost that good. Certainly one of the best barleywines that I've ever had. Another reason that I wish I still lived on the west coast."
"O- One of the top beers I have ever had. Amazing beer worth the hype and praise. Also worthy of its price. Have four stored away for aging and special occasions that I am looking very forward to. Cheers"
"love this amazing Barleywine."
"Absolutely stunning beer. Without a doubt my favorite Barleywine. The flavor shows amazing complexity and integration. There is a bit of warming booziness but it adds more character opposed to becoming abrasive. Very smooth overall, a definite sipper. Flat out awesome beer, great work FW."
"O - Very good brew. Perfect balance between booziness and drinkability. Highly recommend."
"This tastes fantastic, but one for sipping and sharing. I could see it with creamier cheeses (brie) and raspberry. Could also pair with steak."
"Pours a clear yellowish brown. Not much head. Noth really special appearance. Smells bourbony and boozy. Lacking on the nose. Tastes sweet and bourbon heavy. Definitely too boozy at this Point. I would like to see it at 2-3 years. Mouthfeel is dry and a bit lacking as well. Overall is good but not great"
"Overall, possibly the best barleywine I've ever had. Incredible balance and great integration of the barrel really set this beer apart. I only wish I had a couple more bottles."
"Overall: Fairly pricey but I can't remember being this impressed with any other Barleywine I've had recently. I'm glad I bought two so that I can see what some age does this one."
"Overall: Excellent brew. Well worth the asking price. This should be savoured like a fine cognac and should be shared with great friends. Recommended!"
"Just amazing mouthfeel, pick up all the tasting notes, but also, a slickness, glides off the palate, comes and goes without an aftertaste backlash. This stuff is excellent now, makes me a little leery about aging it. Can it really get any better?"
"D: for a 13% beer the alcohol is very well hidden. a little heat, but nothing another 6 months cant cure. Very impressed overall."
"It drinks like a high end bourbon. Very smooth and complex. The high abv is prevalent but necessary in a drink like this. It's a sipper. Take your time and enjoy."
"Cheers"
"Overall I messed up not picking up more bottles of this gem of a beer. Can only imagine with another year what this will taste like. Does not taste like any barleywine's I have had, but who cares with this symphony of taste and smell this beer makes work."
"On tap at Cloverleaf. What a BW. Pours a dark murky brown color with a caramel colored head. Has an aroma of bourbon, dark fruit, caramel, and perhaps some earthiness. Has a sweet dark fruit taste with notes of caramel and chocolate. A nice hop layer. Creamy mouthfeel. Excellent."
"Medium bodied, with a hint of soft carbonation, enough to prevent this beer from being a sticky mess on your tongue. The finish goes on forever, mainly the barrel characteristics and a touch of toffee. For such a big barleywine, this beer is not overly sweet at this point, so the blend is meant to be enjoyed soon after release."
"Overall, an excellent beer. I can really tell that this was a base for 10, on it's on it stands tall. This is a delicious beer, you just have to like sweet booziness."
"Pours a dark crimson red/dark brown with a very, very small tan head that fades to nothing. The head came out very fizzy, much like a soda. No lacing whatsoever on the drink down. The smell coming off this beer is absolutely fantastic. Caramel, toffee, butterscotch, brown sugar, cherry, coconut, earthy woods all come out of the glass. I spent about 5 minutes just smelling this beer before I even took a sip. Not surprisingly the taste is out of this world. The first taste that I get is toasted coconut. This is followed by sweet caramel/toffee, candied cherries, and very subtle hints of chocolate. There is an aftertaste of some woody notes from the barrels. This beer has a good level of carbonation which I think helps it from being too thick and cloying. This is by far the best barleywine I have ever had. The 13% ABV is really not noticeable at all. The aromas and flavors mesh together amazingly well. I have 2 more of these in my cellar and I can't wait to see how these age. I am going to seek more of these out for sure."
"O - For a barrel aged beer, this one is pretty smooth and properly balanced. Im not a whiskey fan but I wasnt overpowered by the ammonia-like whiskey bite. A nice smooth mellowed dark beer."
"Overall: An exceptional bourbon barrel aged Barleywine."
"D: This is a sipper, but that's what BWs are for"
"- Overall this is a killer barleywine. Has a wonderful array of flavors and a desert-like quality that can be rare in such a style. Overall not the prettiest beer, but is quite nice and a bomber worth sharing with some fellow beer advocates!"
"O - Very good beer. It is still pretty hot at the moment but it is still a very easy drinking barrel aged barleywine. I am really glad I made the long trek down to Capone's to try it."
"O- I tried very hard to give this a honest review, being I'm a huge ran of Firestone. I was able to have a glass on tap at the tasting room, but this is a review from the bottle I got. I'm glad I have a few more and will be able to let this age! Can't wait to have this again in 2012."
"Edit - Updated scores and notes after having on tap at the Flying Saucer anniversary party on 5/1/2011."
"D: drank really well considering how hot it was at the moment and would welcome some of this brew anytime. Good job firestone."
"D - Not much needs to be said about this beer other than it's great; very easy to drink and enjoy (in sips); fantastic; I love this stuff; please give me another!"
"This one is definately a sipper. Sticky thick mouthfeel that coats the entire mouth with every drink. The high alcohol is definately subdued and I was able to finish the entire bottle by myself. Selfish? Maybe a little bit! This beer was definately one of the best beers that I have drank in awhile."
"D-o- A slow sipper, not something to take lightly, 13% is alot and it shows. FW knows their way around a barrel. 3 years is insane yet this remains a balanced beer and not a booze bomb."
"Tried this on tap the first go round and went out immediately and bought 2 bottles. A very good brew for an evening sipper round the fireplace or just in front of the TV. Very worthy brew. Worth treating yourself to this one. comments from others are on the mark. First barleywine I've ever tried...I need to seek more!"
"Abacus pours surprisingly dark for the style, it's almost stout black. One or two cherry spots do shine through when the beer is held to light though. The khaki colored head is thin and disappears quickly without a trace. The nose is heavy on bourbon (albeit good, smooth bourbon), with toffee and vanilla in the background. Each sip brings forth a fantastic blend of toffee, milk chocolate, vanilla, toasted coconut, and bourbon. No one flavor consistently dominates, every time I bring the glass to my lips any one of these flavors is liable to steal though. If I had to nitpick though I'd say that the bourbon is just a little too boozy right now. The body is full and rich and creamy, without becoming over the top or lending a cloying sensation to the beer. That may be at least in part thanks to a surprisingly active carbonation that feels quite fine on my tongue. It helps give a life to the beer that is lacking any other opposition to malty goodness. Bottled Abacus is quite good at this still young point in time, but it doesn't quite reach the subtle excellence of both the draft version and what I think bottles will turn into in a few years."
"If there were more I'd go get it. There is not... so I will wait until I can get some and when it's here... I'll rush to it."
"Overall: I never expected this to be so disgustingly good. They say it is a barleywine... hardly. But whatever it is, oh dear god it is delicious! Smooth and outrageously drinkable, enticing and engaging, just rightly sweet. Woodsy, bourbon-y, beautiful. Seriously, for a 13% brew, this is immensely poundable and delicious. Need. More!"
"O - This is a phenomenal brew. Thanks Eric. I want more."
"I'm stuck in that unique, but welcome hell that is having a beer that's so fantastic, so age-able, so already-open, and so finite. Guess it's time to enjoy. We definitely stopped what we were doing a few times to marvel about it. Bounce back tastes and try and pin things down - the bourbon, the chocolate, the vanilla, the dark fruit, the balance of all of these working together, captured with just the right gravity. An amazing beer that happily made me eat my words. Now if they can just fix the typos all over that brown box..."
"(O) The alcohol is masked very well. You can get a hint of the booze in the nose but you can't really taste it. I expected it to be a heavily hopped, boozy mess but it was well constructed and balanced and extremely good."
"Not quite as ready to go out of the literal box as Parabola was, the heat on this needs time to cool down but this still ehas traces of the typical FW balance and deliciousness of their BA beers."
"Well this beer sure looks the best of all of the other barleywines set before us. Hopefully it's a sign of things to come. This beer pours a clear dark mahogany color with an ecru finger surfacing this pretty beer. The aromatics are oak barrel, caramel, fig and raisin. It was actually pretty weak on all those fronts as well. Because the smells were so good is the reason it gets the rating it does. The flavor matches the same with the nose. It good mellow, sweet and has all the characteristics you'd look for in a quality barleywine, but it feels so standard. I think it could have been smoother, but it was still really easy to drink. Overall this was a very excellent beer, but it felt like something was missing from making it world class."
"It drinks a little on the sweet side, but it is a smooth ride if you don't mind the river of fire flowing through it. Is this tasty! Good mouthfeel even with the low carbonation, very full and enriching to my life. The caramel coats the tongue and inside the cheeks, plunging into the spots between teeth, seeking all the places to hide forever. And I, willing participant, allow it. I do allow it."
"M/D: Good carbonation and medium bodied. It was overall too sweet and too boozy for me. Tasty and there is a lot going on, but I could have used less booze and more hops to even this out."
"Firestone maintains it's standard of excellence for barrel-aged brews. This is one fine BA barleywine. Glad to have a couple more & very interested to see how this stacks up after a little time in the cellar to cool it off a bit."
"I had this on tap as well and it was about the same, in fact I was hoping the bottle would be better. I was looking forward to this beer for some time but it's kind of a disappointment. I'm not sure age would really help either as the flavors are fairly mellow as it is underneath the hot bourbon."
"I haven't busted out an abacus since seventh grade math class. Let's hope this beer tops those memories (not much of a challenge, really). It pours a dark garnet-brown topped by a finger of dirty off-white foam. The nose comprises sharp caramel, mild cocoa, graham crackers, and butterscotch. The taste reunites all of these elements, while simultaneously introducing them to a few newbies: ruby red grapefruit, orange peel, and mandarin orange flesh. The body is a solid medium, with a light moderate carbonation and an oily, sorta syrupy feel. Overall, a more-than-solid b-wine, though I'm not sure it deserves all of the praise it gets. Don't get me wrong: this is some tasty stuff, but there are many better barleywines more readily available."
"O: Compared to Parabola (which I realize is a different style), this offering from Firestone Walker is overall a big dissapointment. So hot that the alcohol seems to cover everything in the nose, taste, and feel. I recommend sitting on this one for a very long time. There's a great beer behind that heat somewhere..."
"Superb. Very creamy and an excellent delivery system for the high ABV. This is a sipper but a great one at that."
"Pours a dark color, only noticing the deep mahogany hues when held against a light, nice cap of tan colored head with good retention and lacing. Scent brings wonderul notes of fine burbon, oak, warm vanilla sugar, rich dark chocolate, ripe black cherry, coconut, leather. While beers with this nose tend to be harsh and warm, it was nothing but smooth... all of the flavors blend perfectly. The barrel againg is the star and FW has this method down. While a fantastic malt profile is the base of the beer, I cant get beyond the oak, warmn vanilla sugar, cocount an burbon. While most barelywines seem to go for clean and bright malts, this definitely brings in some from the darker side - chocolate, char, earth and spice present themselves. Body is full, smooth and creamy, no lingering tastes on the palate, moderate carbonation. Fantastic beer which I would love to secure another bottle of and let sit for a while."
"This is a fantastic BA barleywine, one of the best I've had in a long time. FW certainly knows their way around barrel aging. World class."
"Notes: Not the 14th Anniversary but who would complaint when something is this extraordinary. Sure enough, one needs to be into barrel aged, complex, and boozy brews but this is another highlight… I'll keep a bottle, maybe two for the aging, if I can. But it'll be difficult."
"There's no doubt in my mind now that this is one you absolutely need to seek out. I feel honored that FW is finally in the Philadelphia market, because it will be hard to keep my hands off this stuff. If you want a barrel aged Barleywine done right, look no further - Abacus is your answer."
"O - My first Abacus, and I'm blown away! To me, this brew is like The Abyss of the barleywines! So deep, so complex. I am very glad I bought 2 of these, and if there's anymore on the shelf when I go back, I might buy 2 more! Great, amazing barrel aged barleywine!"
"Full syrupy body, milder carbonation, sticky velvet smoothness which wraps around the tongue. Surprisingly drinkable for the alcohol content (I ended up having multiple glasses bc I simply couldn't get enough). Excellent flavor, awesome bourbon barrel usage. One of the best barleywines or barrel aged beers I've ever had - Truly remarkable."
"One of the best barleywines I have had, I have no doubt this will age wonderfully (if I can let it)."
"This one's worthy of the hype. It's one of, if not the best American Barleywine I've had the pleasure of drinking."
"Lighting was somewhat pour but beer was very dark. Minimal head. Smell was sweet with a light bourbon hint. Taste was similar with hints of vanilla, bourbon, molasses, dark fruit. Very smooth and refined, the mouthfeel was medium bodied. Alcohol presence was very well hidden and almost no warming sensation. Overall, this was a fantastic brew and I was quite surprised how well rounded it was."
"Medium bodied with the perfect balance of earthy barrel character, boozy bourbon, sweet malt and alcohol heat. Very similar to the aroma with a prominent barrel presence up front. Earthy oak that is slightly toasted with sweet bourbon flavor that is prominent but not overly hot. Although the bourbon flavor is strong, it's not overpowering and the other flavors are able to stand out. There are also notes of vanilla and toasted coconut from the barrel, mellowing things out. Slightly hot with some nice burning warmth in the finish but the ABV is pretty well masked at 13%. Underneath there is a nice blend of earthy/leathery and sweet malt flavor. Slightly earthy barleywine flavor with hints of sweet caramel toffee, rye and faint cocoa. Vinous with dark fruit flavor, especially dark cherry as well as some grape, plum, raisin and fig. More heat toward the end of the swallow but this beer is excellently balanced, delicious and dangerously drinkable. One of the best barrel aged beers I've ever had. Amazing!"
"O- I'm totally digging this brew and I had been hoping for good thing and this far exceeded my expectations. One of the best ba bw I've come across. Its super easy to drink yet at the same time you could spend all day picking it to pieces."
"22 oz bottle. 2011 release. Pours a cola brown with a very small light tan head that leaves small spots of lacing around the glass. The aroma is wonderful. Caramel, toasted coconut, light oxidation, vanilla, brandy (not sure if any of this was brandy barrel aged, but I get it in the aroma), some light cherry notes, a decent amount of bourbon, some light alcohol, a light leather note, and a bit of oak. The barrels certainly come through in the aroma. All of the different aromas work quite nicely together. The initial taste is sweet with caramel, brown sugar, coconut, and vanilla. Then a little brandy and a light oxidation comes through as well. Bourbon and a bit of leather on the finish with a light bitterness. A light alcohol heat, but much less than you would expect for a 13% beer. Medium-heavy body. Very smooth mouthfeel. Manages to be sweet without being syrupy. Low carbonation works very well for the beer. Overall, a great beer. Probably the best barley wine I have had so far. The barrels certainly dominate the nose and taste, which I quite enjoy. I found myself not wanting to finish my glass just so I could continue to enjoy the aroma for a few extra minutes."
"If you get the chance, Abacus is absolutely worth the try. The barrel aging makes this beer amazing. I would love the chance to try this with 3 years of age!"
"Overall, impressed and looking forward to tasting improvements with my cellared bottle. Nice bourbon presence that isn't too in-your-face."
"O - A really good beer and barleywine, the 13% is felt in the buzz, but you don't really notice it while you're drinking. Not as good as I was hoping for, but still a great beer."
"D: Smooth, rich, HUGE, and so drinkable for 13 percent. This is a tasty beer."
"As it warmed the whiskey notes really became more evident."
"On the front of the tongue this tastes like candy, then there's chocolate further back in the mouth and cherry in the finish. This is very, very smooth and not at all cloying. It should be sipped slowly, but it's hard not to drink it faster than an 13% beer ought to be."
"(Update: had it on draft last week, and it's even better. All of the flavors were amplified, especially the sweetbread, toffee, and strawberries; my inspiration had led me to conclude this ranks with Parabola as FSW's top specialty-release)"
"O - Wow, this is a great beer! So smooth and delicious. I know that this beer is pretty fresh but I am so glad that I have a few bottles to age because I know it is going to get better. Considering the high ABV I am just downing this beer. Great, just great!"
"O) Another great beer from Firestone Walker and yet another reason to do my beer shopping other than in Connecticut!"
"Drinkability: I was a little underwhelmed by this beer. It's no Parabola - it's hotter, more astringent, and a little less flavorful. And at 13.0%, it's going to kick your ass if you're not careful ... and maybe even if you are. Drink this one with food (specifically, with dessert), and don't drink it alone if you can help it. I think this beer could be a lot more if they became a little more focused with the barrel aging, and maybe even a little more focused with the baseline malts and hop profile ... thinking back on the ""big picture"" of this beer makes it even a little more hazy. Regardless, on the whole it's definitely an above average brew, one I'm glad to have tried, though I question its price tag."
"O: Overall I'm glad I was able to find several of these to lay down in the cellar as I really feel this will get better with age. Definitely one of the better bourbon barrel barleywines out there."
"Overall, this beer is what I would hope and expect a Harry Potter Butterbeer tastes like. It is sweet, nutty, and buttery. I had no idea that this beer would be this good. It is far better than Mother of All Storms and is much more on par with my favorites, Kuhnhenn BBBW and Central Waters BBBW. The EtOH burn is prominent in this one, but I would love to drink a bottle or two with Hermoine Granger and see where the night takes us. Excellent brew."
"2011 vintage on-tap at Track 84. Served in a tulip. Pours the color of mahogany with ruby highlights around the the base. Half-inch head is frothy, tan-colored and embedded with pinpricks. Head eventually dissipates into a swirl of foam that coalesces around the edges. Thick swaths of lacing are exposed during the tasting. Nose is incredible - sweet and malty with brown sugar, a dominant toffee character and vanilla notes. Taste follows nose - a little alcohol acridness pleasantly breaks up the sweetness. There's also a hint of cocoa or milk chocolate and perhaps a nuttiness quality (hazelnuts?) as well as a rum or whiskey character. Mouthfeel is medium-light with a lively effervescence that is slightly too assertive for the style and abv. There's also a slight viscosity and some residual alcohol heat at the finish. This is a dangerously drinkable beer at 13% abv. Possibly my favorite example of the style. Definitely a beer that has great cellaring potential. I'd love to see how this beer rounds out with perhaps three years on it."
"Beer is the most drinkable beer I think I've ever had. I'm not the biggest barleywine fan out there, but this is an incredible beer. Sweet, not a dry finish, great liquor character, nice body, creamy smooth, you can hold the beer in your mouth for a long time without any alcohol bite or any heat. Wonderful, truly wonderful."
"I hate to be that guy, but Abacus is even better from the tap being granted a cherry sweetness I didn't much pick up in the bottle. Incredible."
"Overall I think its a great Barleywine that deserves a try, very complex with lots of layers to the flavor."
"Overall this is pretty dang good, but I wish it wasn't so prickly and carbonated. Very chocolaty I must say. It's excellent but I am not blown away by it."
"Thick and chewy with a bit of a boozy kick to it. Overall, another excellent example of barrel aged beers from the guys (and gals) are Firestone Walker."
"Incredible barleywine with beautiful dark chocolate, cognac, pitted fruit and unpitted fruit skins, tobacco, leather, subtle bourbon (well integrated) cardamom, clove, and surprisingly dryish in the remarkably lengthy finish. Impeccable balance from sniff to aftertaste. Simply one of the most amazingly sophisticated barleywines I've ever tasted. In another six months when the heat has subsided, this will be a true masterpiece. Edit: After only a few days resting, the heat has almost totally vanished, the carbonation is softer, and the flavors are already more married. Kudos, Firestone!"
"D: Tasty, goes down dangerously easy, slightly filling, very strong kick, good representation of style, for a high-gravity sipper this is a good beer to drink for as long as you're able to handle it."
"Another excellent beer from a really impressive brewery."
"4.5"
"Overall, a terrific beer and a stellar example of a barrel-aged barleywine. Highly recommended."
"ethereal stuff! and double cheers to Beer Rev for charging their usual price. $6 for a 12oz pour."
"M & D - sipper. Can't drink a lot. Syrupy and chewy. Creamy."
"Aroma is very complex and the initial smell is more that of good bourbon than beer. It is followed by a leathery, tobacco smell that fades of to that of a slight bitterness. The appearance is a darker amber/red color with a khaki head. The taste is just as complex as the aroma. The initial taste is sweet bourbon that is followed by a slight bitterness that is quickly beaten into submission by the malt flavor. Great beer with not too much bourbon flavor"
"pour is copper with and off brown head. Nose of tofffe, coconut, almond, caramel, wood, toasty biscuit, soy sauce. Palate is intensely english barley wine, sesame seed, vanilla, heat, honey, lamb meat, pineapple, fig flesh,and brown sugar. This was my experience. But it may be different for you. With that said i can see this beer being a bit over accessible, as in this beer is so broad and hides the abv so well that its a slow approach which in turn makes it a success in that it must be drank slowly. Carbonation is better as it sits."
"O - An incredible beer already. This will just get better after a few years in the cellar."
"very good beer. pretty complex, very tasty. gets better as it warms."
"I would drink this again and again, though probably only one a night if I want to wake up the next day. It is truly a world class beer, one of the few 5.0s to a style I have seen. Judged as an English Barleywine, I cannot find a flaw."
"O - This is one fantastic beer. Liked it a lot in the bottle. Loved it on-tap. Seek this out!"
"O - Great AB. Probably top 5 in my book. Its good to see a AB that is malt heavy and the barrel aging adds to the sweet side."
"22oz bottle from Beerdy, thanks a lot man! Dark chocolate color with a good little head at first. Smells a little oaky, woody, boozy, shredded coconut, good. Taste is like nice chocolates, hardly a hint of the alcohol, very well done. Overall, this is probably the second best firestone beer i've had after FW11."
"D - Complex, interesting, and intense. This beer is very drinkable for done thing of this strength, though it really should be served in a small snifter. I imagine that this is the sort of beer that would continue to improve for years, though it didn't seem to need any age when I had it."
"O - This is a good barleywine, would be even better if judged as an English style, but it is a bit lacking as an American style in the hop category. Definitely a barelywine to be tried by all loves of the strong style."
"Overall this beer is one of the best barleywines on the planet for sure. Right up there with The Perfect Storm '09 and Central Waters Bourbon Barrel Barleywine '09 competing for the status of the best to ever cross my lips."
"All in all, this is a very good barleywine. Great for the style if you get the chance to try. So definitely try if you have the chance."
"Verdict: A touch below stuff like Xantus, but still top tier. If you can find it, try it..."
"MF- A nice smooth body that's about moderate to just about full."
"Drinkability- Definitely a tasty brewski but it might need a touch more time. At this point it's slightly too sweet and I don't find it as complex (or delicious) as PS or WH. Maybe that's an unfair comparison but that's what it's up against in my mind (right?). It's just not quite there yet. Thanks much Corey!"
"Edit: as this warms the booze really comes out of this. The nose is strong with alcohol... lowered my rating of the smell."
"This is way too drinkable and dangerous. It's an eager sipper. Mouthfeel is great and it goes down smooth. This is an outstanding beer. Cheers"
"An exceptional barely wine. Proud to have this be my first review."
"O: Great barley wine, but for me, it needs some time to mellow out, as I also got what I would describe as a spice, or cinamon note in there, which was a bit off putting to me. No one elses at the tasting got that in this, so maybe it's just my palate, but it was subtle, so hopefully that note will fade out, and the other notes will have more promience. I Have three bottles in the cellar, so will what some age does to it."
"d - I thought this was an amazing barleywine. Lots of caramel and oak, mixing with some sweet vanill and bourbon, especially in the taste. The mouthfeel was great and this was scary drinkable for 13%. Can't wait to get bottles of this one when it comes to VA."
"Drinkability is OK. High alcohol level and the whiskey taste make this on a little problematic in the drinkability department. To bad this isn't in 7oz bottles."
"Overall, yeah, this is awesome. At $15 per bottle, there isn't much to complain about here. I wish it were easier to find, but that isn't the beer's fault. World class stuff."
"Cheers!"
"Overall: The bourbon aroma coming off the top of this beer is outstanding! Though one could argue that the aroma is rather one-dimensional and you do have to look for the other aroma characteristics. But that's really being picky. Flavor and mouthfeel are balanced. The alcohol is a little hot, but this will tone down nicely with age. An excellent barleywine."
"overall? world class, no question. just an amazing beer. well worth the cost IMO."
"Drinkability - This is one of the best barlywine's I've ever had. Incredibly smooth and tasty. Another hit from FW and I'm glad I have plenty of bottles."
"M: Very thick and creamy but very drinkable at the same time, especially with the high ABV. The alcohol is noticeable but not overpowering. This was quite a treat. After having it on tap, I must get my hands on a couple bottles to age."
"A great whisky barrel aged barleywine. Beer is dark brown with no head. Heavy warm whisky and sweet malt notes. Bought a bottle to age. The beer changed a lot as it warmed up. Very fruity notes as it warmed versus the more whisky type aroma at the colder temperature. An excellent beer."
"this beer is absolutely phenomenal. the beer pours a copperish color with light ruby hues and a decent white head. the smell is sweet bourbon and malts. the flavor is sweet and complex the bourbon is evident up front followed by a wonderfully complex malt and hop flavors. the mouthfeel is full, a little fuller than I was expecting bnut not a bad thing. overall this beer is definitely the best barley wine i have ever sampled by far. I will definitlely be stocking up on some bottles for aging."
"Overall: an extremely well blended English barleywine and an exceptionally well crafted barrel aging masterpiece. My favorite barleywine. Great both on draft and in bottle. Wow! Cellaring should do wonders."
"Pours cola brown with thim head that recedes quickly. Nose is impressive with a hint of toasted coconut, dark rum booziness, and rum cake. Toasted coconut is there on palate too with some raisin jam flavors, minerals, roasted malty flavors, and rum infused dessert flavors at the end. A bit hot too."
"I really do enjoy this, and am very thankful for being able to try this. Though there are other barrel aged Firestone Walker beers that I prefer. Still very much worth a try."
"Drink- This was big, flavorful and very stout like. I have a couple more of these to sit on and I am very glad I picked the extras up. This was flavorful and powerful and I think it can only get better with age."
"Overall great, cross between old ale and barleywine. Very soft, delicate and tasty."
"I grabbed this bottle at Yankee Spirits in Stubridge today. I tried this last weekend at EBF, and was impressed, so lets see how it hold up from the bottle. It pours out a rosewood color, with half a finger of whitish heading. The color is nice, here; a mix of red and brown. Lots of caramel and alcohol come through in the nose, along with just a little bit of dark fruit. More of the same from the taste, but the alcohol is much more in the forefront than in the smell. The mouthfeel is thick, creamy and chewy all at the same time. The ABV on the bottle is listed as 13% as opposed to the 12% I see above. In any event, the alcohol is pretty hot on this one right now. I am thinking this beer tastes great now, but will do even better with some age to it. This is a beer to buy two of; one to drink now and one to cellar for a while."
"O - This is a really good barleywine. Delicious on tap."
"Overall an amazing beer. Glad I grabbed a few to age. Get some for sure. It's going to age very well."
"2011 Vintage/13%ABV. I was SO EXCITED to try this one, considering every time I've gone to the brewery, they've never had it on tap. Pours a dark amber-reddish color with almost no head at all. Almost like some cherry cola after the carbonation has settled. Scent is OAK...and lots of it. The oak and bourbon flavors are absolutely lovely and predominant in the aroma. The description on the box doesn't specify which barrels were used, but some of the barrels definitely left some amazing bourbon notes behind. Taste definitely has that oak flavor as well, along with delicious cherry and vanilla notes. There are also hints of chocolate and dark fruits. Bourbon is blended in very nicely with all these flavors. Absolutely phenomenal! Mouthfeel is full bodied and smooth with such amazing complexity. Drinkability is high for a 13% barleywine."
"Overall, this is a fantastic beer that will only get better and better with age. One customer remarked that he thought this could be kept for 5+ years and I can't disagree. This is going to be a beast and I'm glad that I caught a taste of it before it goes back into hiding."
"Abacus was a successfully blended barrel-aged brew. The taste was excellent, but I found a lack of uniqueness among these barrel-aged beers. Nevertheless I enjoyed sipping Abacus because it gave me the enjoyment of tasting a recherche and tasty beverage."
"D: High ABV will limit drinkability of this."
"D-Love it."
"Overall, I am excited to get some bottles of this and enjoy over time. Nice work on this one!"
"one of my favorite barleywines."
"D - For being 13% this is a masterpiece, I think this and Parabola are great examples from Firestone. I could drink this all the time."
"The vanillin and coconut notes are nice in this beer and it is well accentuated by the malt sweetness, but this is too hot and too Bourbon dominated in the end. If you really like Bourbon then I can see this being quite the enjoyable tipple, but it is perhaps a bit too much for me."
"On-tap at City Beer Store. Good barleywine aromas, creamy mouthfeel, A tad of creamy off-white head on brown. Carbonation was a tad fizzy. Decent drinkability, I could have much more in a meal. A decent barleywine,British in character though not exceptional on this day."
"Edit 9/7/12: I don't know if the beer changed or my palate, but this beer has been a lot boozier when I've tried it since my review. It's still quite good, just a bit much. A small taste is all I really want at once."
"D- Insane, so easy to drink very lucky to have tried it. I would go after this one like crazy to have another glass."
"Amber colored beverage with some burgundy highlights and almost no head to be found. The aroma consists of molasses, maple syrup, candy and light malt. The taste is boozy with the alcohol on the forefront and a medicine-like aftertaste. Reminds me of a port wine. Slight burn on the swallow and a tummy warming sensation as well. It has a numbing effect on the teeth and tongue. As Mr. Furley would say ""Smoooth."" A definite sipper beer that would go well as an after dinner drink or with a nice cigar. Nice work on this creation."
"If anyone gets the chance to taste this beer I hope you enjoy this beer as much as i did."
"Black opaque, but when held up to the light, some deep browns and rubies are noticeable. Aromas are HUGE: fig, currant, vanilla, and some unmistakable vinous qualities. Lots of anise, too. Flavors are similar, with the anise and vanilla really dominating. A bit of dark rum and sugar in there as well. Plenty of heat on this very strong beer. Mouthfeel is a little thinner than I expected, and the carbonation is nice and mellow. I'd want to lay this batch down for about a year and see what happens to the dark fruit flavors. I couldn't drink very much of this at once, but I can see myself sipping on a small snifter of this beer after dinner."
"Heavy flavors and ABV, but so luscious...nearly impossible to put down the glass."
"Had this on tap at GABF '09, and finally getting around to entering it here. Pours a very dark brown, mocha color, with just a hint of stone colored head. A very aggressive nose, with bourbon, oak and dark fruit (raisins, plums). Taking the first sip creates an explosion of incredible flavors--loads of bourbon, dark malts, oak, vanilla, dark fruit and maybe just a touch of chocolate. Alcohol is definitely present and noticeable, but adds to, rather than distracts from, the pleasure I get from drinking this one. An absolutely perfect example of bourbon barrel aging."
"This beer does not resemble a barleywine in my opinion, but what a treat anyways! Thanks to the guys at Spuyten Duyvil!"
"This is a Barleywine? I feel like I've been missing a lot with the others I've drunk, but everything works here. Much more drinkable."
"D: Normally you don't associate barleywines with easy drinking, but this one is so smooth and delicious that it's easy to keep going back for more. I can't wait until this is bottled."
"I'm not a huge fan of barleywines, mainly due to the overly sweet and sticky properties so many of them seem to have. This Abacus however was nothing like that at all. Easily one of the best, if not the best barleywine I've ever had. If you happen to see it anywhere, it's definitely worth a try."
"D - Great overall. Not that I would want to session it, but ya know."
"This definitely lived up to the hype and exceeded my expectations. Very nuanced and drinkable big barleywine. I look forward to Firestone bottling this later this year."
"Palate creamy with low carbonation. Slight booze, but not much for 12% ABV. Drinkability is not awesome, but it's pretty high for what the beer is."
"Cellared keg from 2008, enjoyed on draught at Beachwood BBQ. Pours exceptionally dark in color, which could easily confuse it for an imperial stout. Compact and dense dark tan head is under a centimeter tall. Aromas of toffee, brandy, and spicy hops come through. Tastes of toffee, raw sugar, brandy, leather, and maple. Finish is increasingly spicy, with a floral, almost phenolic finish. Heavy in body, chewy and smooth, yet with prickly medium carbonation that makes for a perfect barleywine feel. One of the best barrel aged barleywines on the planet. Exceptional flavor that can be savored for extended periods of time."
"Wow, didn't think the taste would be better than the aroma but it was. Bold toast flavor, chocolate, raisins, toffee, almonds, flaked toasted coconut in the finish with vanilla and oak. Notes of bakers chocolate. This beer was delicious. A low carbonation helped to bring a creaminess to the beer, making it run down smoothly down the tongue. I could have easily had another one of these if we didn't have to leave so early. Will have to try harder to make it to any bar that has this one next time."
"D: mouthfeel draws you back for more more easily than it should be to drink this rich viscous liquid. So points for that but overall not very drinkable."
"This is the second beer I've had at this event that has simply floored me with its silky rich yummy goodness. Pours deep amber to near dark brown and micro thin tan head. Wow! Another knee buckler aroma with a smooth blended mixture of wood, molasses, rich dark fruity esters and more rich molasses. The wood notes become mildly brighter upon further inspection. The taste is just amazing with some smooth bourbon flowing into deep rich dark fruity esters accented with well rounded smooth wood notes. Just a smooth beer that gets almost velvety for a while. It dries out a tad into the finish."
"off the tap at 555 haight"
"Had this on-tap at Toronado in San Francisco during their anniversary celebration this August. Served in a small Port wine glass. Poured black with little head, very dark stout-like color. Smells sweet, rich and fruity with prunes. brown sugar, dates, slightly roasty and almost tar like on the finish. More tar flavors in the taste, some roastiness, quite bitter- almost quinine like, followed by vinous qualities that are fruity and strong, almost reminiscent of Port wine. On the finish there is a hit of unsweetened black licorice. Strong and thick in the mouth, this beer bears more than a passing resemblance to an Imperial Stout, but with some rich sweet notes of an American Strong as well. I wouldn't really call this a Barley Wine, but whatever it is it's mighty tasty."
"D - It's a slow sipper, and at 12% it can quickly wear down my sobriety, just as fast as the intense flavor wears down my palate. Just a touch less drinkable than the awesome 10, as this batch seemed a little younger and hotter."
"Overall: Exceptional. I tried this @Toronado 22nd party mostly because I saw it won the Toronado BW fest earlier this year. Definitely solid and 12%abv not noticeable. Very dangerous! Similar to Older Viscosity or Bourbon AS. Technically a BW but could almost pass as an old ale, strong ale, or even stout."
"About a 10 ounce pour in a plastic cup at Darklord day 2009. Body is a blackish brown mocha tone that hosts only a rim of skim tan head. Nose is brilliant with tones of bourbon and candied, dark fruit based malts. There is a soft rustic hint of a hop profile there also. Loads of bourbon initially flood the tongue. This is quickly followed by a very sweet malt character with tones of dark fruit like raisins and plums. All the time keeping a well balanced background hop character that adds nice zing and balance. Lots of vanilla and even some cordial chocolate show up. Mouthfeel is thick and desert like, very nice. Super smooth and attractively drinkable. This is one of the best Barleywines I have had. Firestone Walker, please bottle this one."
"Drinkability= Very Drinkable. I could drink this all day. As a matter of fact, I'm on my 6th glass and not looking back. Alcohol is hidden very well in the taste. Very dangerous elixir! Bottle this already..."
"This is one excellent barleywine. Very bourbon-oriented and has all elements you would expect from it. Firestone rocks."
"D: Quite drinkable, as the alcohol is hidden, but not too much."
"Big thick monstrous barley wine with decent hopping on the finish. Hints of RS with a boubony middle and vanilla toasty oak induced middle-finish. Dried fruits and a hint of currant. Caramel and date with mollasses and chocolate. Delicious."
"Overall: Wow! And this is the stuff that comprised (at least I believe) 40% or so of Firestone 10. A really beautiful beer and a top five barleywine for me as well. Seek this beer out and enjoy. Cheers!"
"Mouthfeel is lighter for a barrel aged brew like this, but I think it adds to the experience. Nice level of carbonation and not too syrupy leads to an amazing drinkability factor. I highly recommend making an effort to try this one."
"D: Another outstanding barrel aged product from Firestone, they've certainly found a niche they excel at."
"Fantastic, and a must have."
"Good feel and the drinkability is extravagant given the potency, as the alcohol is present on the nose but not on the tongue."
"Tap @ O'Briens. Poured hazy copper-brown with a flat ring of white bubbles. No lacing. Earthy caramel and bread dough aroma with vanilla, oak, and whiskey. Boozy. Viscous, non-carbonated mouthfeel gave it the character of a liquer. Strong caramel and cherry flavors up front, then moves into the earthy, alcoholic oaken malt flavors. Somewhat of a mix between whiskey and cognac in the background. Long, sticky finish that tastes resiny, but without the bite. Definitely a sipper, but a great one at that."
"Good drinkability, and an overall awesome treat. Firestone Walker's big beers are second to none. Now if I could only get my hands on some Parabola..."
"Firestone's barrel aged program is showing why it is one of the best in the country, their three blends thus far have been fantastic and same with every beer that makes those up, I just went out to grab a beer after a rough day at work and stumbled upon this masterpiece, wish I knew it about it before because I would have been there when they opened and had several more of these, this beer is going to create some serious hype as it circulates through the state, I cannot wait to have more, highly recommended"
"M - not too heavy, good body and feel to it."
"Draught, Boulder Strong Ale Festival. Ruby colored beer. Nose lacks depth, but shows some malt and barrel elements of caramel, toast, toffee. Upon tasting, not a lot from the original beer. Sweet, fruity, barrel accented, but not complex or concentrated. One of the weaker examples of barrel aged strong ale at the fest."
"This is definitely one of the best barleywines that I have had and look forward to future availability. Firestone (although seemingly focused on pale ales based on their website) needs to either bottle this or produce/distribute more of this and the Parabola. They're definitely on to something here."
"Pours a dark woody brown with a nice tan head. The nose has bready malts, oak, bourbon, vanilla and subtle flowery hops. Flavor also has a nice whiskey and oak presence over sweet fruity malts and again quiet hops. Full body is well carbonated and drinks easy. Another great brew from Firestone."
"Wiseman Justin: A (4.40)"
"I was blown away when I tried this, I heard it placed second in the SF Barleywine festival and it deserves it. Firestone is making some fantastic special releases."
"On tap at City Beer Store. Joey Schlitz had the last glass in the keg. Awesome barleywine. One of the best I've had. Sweet carmel, toffee, and malt flavors. Not a ton of hops. The flavor is not the least bit abrasive. One could accidentally drink enough of these that it would be necessary to call in sick to work the next day. Why doesn't Firestone bottle this?"
"A different type of barleywine than the sugary high alcohol set (although this one ain't no session beer). Just an awesome beer. Would drink it every night if I could."
"D - As drinakble at a 11% ABV barleywine could be. Definitely a nice sipping beer, great way to finish off a meal."
"Draught at The Red in Santa Cruz. Dark brown with some red, and a small head with no lace. Rich, malty, salty, and woody aroma with plenty of alcohol. Dark, alcoholic fruit and a little dark chocolate. Pretty low carbonation, and an oily, slick body. The alcohol component is pretty strong, and the roasted chocolate flavor almost suggests an irish coffee, but this is far better. Pretty dark barley wine, but interesting. A good sipper."
"Mouthfeel is too low on carbonation but the viscosity is spot-on for a big bad barleywine and the finish is shockingly dry on the tongue."
"A superb barleywine that exhibits a wonderful spirit barrel character. From my understanding, this was a blend from several different barrels."
