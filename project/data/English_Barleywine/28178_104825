Taste follows the nose with rich toffee fig caramel and tons of vanilla, bourbon, and oak.  This is like dessert in a glass.

Such a rich and heavy beer, and I think some of that robust body doesn't allow any nuances to shine through.  The front is very inviting and complex, but once those malt and bourbon characteristics really pick up this gets a little too heavy.  Overall though, very enjoyable.","KFBR392","Sep 08, 2014"
4.33,1.2,,,,,,"Wow, what an amazing beer. I open this and take a smell and it's a kick right in the nose of bourbon. The taste is very much the same with Bourbon with also a nice amount of sweetness from the malt. This beer gets more boozy the more it warms up. I feel like this beer would be amazing aged.","gtermi","Sep 08, 2014"

Aftertaste lingers nicely, bits of fried plantain in caramel syrup and earthy tobacco woodiness. Rich and full bodied, this is surely a slow sipper. Much improved over the base barleywine, in my opinion. Recommended.","emerge077","Apr 26, 2014"

Taste is a bit hot on the first sip, then it smooths out and continues to as it warms. Rich, dark fruits with toffee, brown sugar, and definitely vanilla. Plenty of bourbon notes in this. It is not hiding the barrel. Really well done BA BW. It's just a bit short of GI BCBW, so that's pretty elite company.","PHBoiler","Jan 06, 2014"

4,-6.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a murky amber capped by a beige one and a quarter finger head. Great retention considering this brew was barrel-aged, hints of lacing. Brown sugar, toffee, dark fruit, general booziness; perhaps a very slight more specific hint of bourbon, and some light oak. Opens with dates, toffee and caramel, brown sugar, ripe plums, and dried dark fruit. Big vanilla notes midpalate; the oak and bourbon really show up on the finish and complement the other diverse flavors. Full-bodied, syrupy and silky. Lower level of carbonation. Thoroughly enjoyable, however would have liked to see just a bit more richness in the flavors. Regardless, a great choice for one of the first three BA offerings from Pipeworks.","chanokokoro","Dec 30, 2013"
