4.72,11.6,4,4.5,5,5,4.5,"375 ml bottle into snifter, 2014 vintage bottling. Pours hazy opaque dark brown color with a 1 finger dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings around the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of big raisin, plum, caramel, toffee, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, coconut, butterscotch, vanilla, bourbon, oak, light chocolate, and oak/toasted earthiness. Incredible aromas with fantastic complexity and balance of dark/bready malt and bourbon barrel notes; with great strength. Taste of big raisin, plum, caramel, toffee, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, coconut, butterscotch, bourbon, oak, light chocolate, and oak/toasted earthiness. Light oak bitterness and bourbon spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, plum, caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, brown bread, coconut, butterscotch, bourbon, oak, light chocolate, and oak/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Absolutely insane complexity and perfect balance of dark/bready malt and bourbon barrel flavors; with an awesome malt/barrel spice balance zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very smooth, creamy, and fairly slick mouthfeel that is incredible. Alcohol is well hidden with a light-moderate warmth lingering after the finish; but not boozy at all. Overall this is a world class BA English Barelywine style. Pretty much perfect balance and complexity of dark/bready malt and bourbon barrel flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. An absolutely mind blowing offering all around.","superspak","Mar 20, 2015"

Enters into the mouth with smooth and silky feel.  Carmel and bourbon are meet with a lingering hop character that shows this was a hoppy Barley-wine to start.  Lovely and rich in flavor with tons of sweetness and toffee that really define this beer.

Head retention is decent, and there's a good amount of lacing.  Aroma is nice, the brew smells like vanilla, bourbon, caramel, toffee, brown sugar and dark fruit.  I think the taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also the addition of some wood, molasses and dark bread.  Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's syrupy and coating with low/moderate carbonation.  It's a pretty tasty brew, might have to pick up some more of this!  It was either $11.99 or $12.99 a bottle, I forget which.  Regardless of the price, it's worth trying at least once.","bluejacket74","Dec 23, 2014"

I think the bourbon flavor, while very good, is just a hair on the hot side like BB Dark Apparition. To me, that is the only difference between this beer and the elite bourbon barrel barleys. It just isnt as smooth and balanced as a Sucaba or Bourbon County, or even their own Black Maple for example. Still, an outstanding beer.

This was definitely more on the ""hit"" side. I actually enjoyed it more than the AleSmith BA Old Numbskull - the big ol' ""popular"" and highly acclaimed BA barley wine that I was expecting to like more. Like settling for the slightly less appealing assistant captain cheerleader then finding out her parents are millionaires.","tectactoe","Jun 16, 2013"

Smell is of malt, brown sugar, caramel, bourbon, and wood aromas. Taste is much the same with bourbon and wood flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of woody bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with a nice bourbon presence in the aroma and flavor.","UCLABrewN84","Apr 13, 2013"

The first sip tells me that this is a really well made and tasty beer. Caramel and toasted oak, vanilla and bourbon with some alcoholic heat and faint tannins. I feel the heat in my chest more than on my palate. Silky smooth, mildly carbonated and a little sticky. This beer is awesome fresh and will only get more polished with age.","biggred1","Dec 16, 2012"
