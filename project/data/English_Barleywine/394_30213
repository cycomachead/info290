Noticeably drier than the norm, this allows the earthy hops and subtle vinous fruity esters to be highlighted rather than big sweet malts and boozy burn. Not tasting any traces of whiskey flavors, as this is said to have been aged 7 months in a barrel - perhaps some wood. It may drink clean and easy, but it left me wanting some more malt body and just a lil more sugar.

3.43,-6.8,4,3.5,3,3.5,4,"On tap at Als of Hampden served in a pint glass. Pours a hazy dark amber brown color with minimal white lace coating the surface of the brew. Nose reminds me of fruits with a minimal amount of malt/grain aroma but includes hints of a dry acsic quality almost like a combination of pear meets green apple. Trace amounts of hops are evident in the scent as well. Taste is slightly bitter upfront but transforms to a very dry fruit character just like on the aroma. Pears and apples with minimal hop impact and a decent alcohol punch. Slight touch of sour apple in the finish with a unique slightly tart character. Warmth and taste of the alcohol lingers in the mouth. Medium feel with a moderately high level of carbonation. Overall a little confused by their take on the style. The acidic quality threw me for a loop along with the dryness instead of malt backing.","stakem","Mar 14, 2010"
3.81,3.5,4.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"First time having a non-barrel aged version of this beer (geez, that 3 year vertical last summer was great). Color is a deep clear mahogany with a two finger light tan head that is supported by a steady stream of bubbles and leaves nice lacing and has great retention. Aroma is mild, lacking any hops, primarily toasted malt, slight sweet and caramel, also some dark fruits. Flavor is predominantly toasted malt and plum, raisin and grape dark fruit bittersweetness. Some remnants of citrus hops in the finish, but very little hop or alcohol presence. Finish also has a mild lingering sourness. Medium-full bodied with very soft carbonation resulting in a chewy.

This goes with my new years resolution to try more Barleywines because honestly, I really don't like the style. Ok on to the review. The beer pours a brownish amber with a huge off white head that dissipates into a thin layer around the outside of the glass. The smell is average. Nothing spectacular. There are hints of the malt backbone, but nothing really is overwhelming. Hints of raisins, pepper and wheat husks. The taste mirrors the smell unfortunately. The burnt grain husk taste is actually over powering the malt backbone to this beer. Also it kind of makes my tongue numb. The mouthfeel is full and think. Think a good Dimetapp in how it coats your mouth. I don't think I will seek this beer out again, but if you do like barleywines, give this baby a try.

Taste is defenitey american barleywine, just seems toned down to me. decent smooth mouthfeel and very good drinkability, but lacking in flavor, especially when catagorized as english BW.

3.8,3.3,4,4,3.5,4,4,"D: The abv is high and you can feel it mid-way through a dinner bottle. The grain flavors are strong and nicely define the ale. Good for a cold night.","akorsak","Jan 22, 2008"
4.3,16.8,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"This is a great American Style Barleywine with an assertive hop presence that seems to come out even more on cask. Get this at the brewpub while you can.","Kegatron","Feb 23, 2007"
4.25,15.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"D - A fine cask ale w/ nice smoothness and easy to imbibe characteristices. The cask conditioning improved the flavor w/ subtleties over the oak barrel version for my taste.","Slatetank","Jan 28, 2007"

4,8.7,4,4,4,4,4,"Past draft at Bocktown Beer and Grill, since the Burgh didn't receive any bottles I was thrilled to see this tap handle instead. Appears a cloudy ruby amber brown, and it forms with a large cream hued head that leaves thick lacing all around my chalice. Aromatics contain vanilla and oak notes with herbal pine and citrus fruit along with a mild spicy tartness that's kind of hard to nail down completely. Flavor is somewhat mild compared to other Barleywines out there, everything blended pretty well mild alcohol with a mix of ripe fruit and deep herbal citrus hop edges brings it all together no cloying malt sweetness but sturdy stand up caramel malt edges were nice. Mouthfeel is medium bodied not cloying or syrupy yet enough body to get it done, moderate carbonation allows this beer to flow well. Drinkability takes a few to get this beer after you get it though beware it's hard to stay away from good barleywine draft offering from the folks in Adamstown, PA.","WVbeergeek","Dec 15, 2006"

4.17,13.3,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Mouthfeel is smooth with light syrup...the smoothest barleywine that I remember having, especially being this young. Overall, it's a nice tasting, slightly sweet brew with an oakiness that seems to take over the brew.","weeare138","Apr 30, 2006"
