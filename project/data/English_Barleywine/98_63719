Pours a deep copper color with a decent off white head that shows moderate retention and lace. Smells of bready caramel and toffee with a bit of earth and alcohol. The flavor is sweet with bready caramel and toffee with a bit of ethanol to cut through the sweetness. Medium body with a light level of carbonation and a sweet sticky mouthfeel. After two years the alcohol is still a bit hot, but that is the only thing providing any balance against a really sweet syrupy maltiness.

Overall I felt this one was a touch more boozy than other barleywines BUT still very drinkable and smooth. No one quality in the flavor stood out.","kylehay2004","Jun 07, 2012"
3.85,1,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"O: Considering its strength, this beer is quite drinkable because the alcohol is well hidden from the taste, although the taste is complex enough for it to be slowly sipped while still keeping the interest of your taste buds.","metter98","Jun 04, 2012"

The aroma is of grape juice, faint plum, some raisin, a bit of toffee, some english malt, and faint vanilla. A strange “Capri Sun” essence to the nose that also carries over into the taste. More grape greets the tongue along with some alcohol bite, caramel, toffee, and faint vanilla. Grape and alcohol dominate. Mouthfeel is average; amply carbonated, but an alcohol bite predominates.

Overall this was a good brew. The aroma on this one really didn't do much for me. I honestly had the wheat and corn aroma you would expect off of an adjunct lager.

Smell- toffee, mocha, some grainy aromas, caramel. What I would expect from the style, very appetizing aroma. Taste- creamy mouthfeel, a rich sweet blast of dark fruits like prunes, raisins, dark cherries. Very little hop presence or bitterness, this is just a super smooth and drinkable barleywine.

Taste is of bready/biscuit malt, brown sugar/caramel, with an herbal/citrus zest hop finish. A very mild bitterness sits on the tongue after each sip, which then fades to a honey aftertaste.

The beer doesn't--at least for me--match up to the excellent levels of Harpoon's other Leviathan beers. Don't get me wrong: this is still a good beer, but of the Leviathan beers that I've tried (which is all but one of them), this is towards the bottom of the rankings.","jondeelee","Jul 30, 2011"

4,5,4,4,4,4,4,"Smell - The aroma was loaded down with caramel. Lots of spices in the nose here as well. Hints of raisins and figs, light earthy, roasted malts and a good touch of alcohol. Very complex nose, and unique for the style. Rich tastes of oak and vanilla, hints of roasted malts and caramel. Very tight and nicely done. A bit of alcohol, just enough to thicken it up a bit. A really nice and very full barley wine. Finish was strong, with a healthy dose of d spice lingering in the mouth for what seemed like forever.","mikesgroove","May 30, 2011"

Sure enough these are relatively heftier brews like a Harpoon rep suggested to me once, but not that particularly hefty or most importantly stimulating. Luckily most of them remain quality. The 100 barrel series are typically more nuanced by design, again the rep defended, but I think I´d rather stick to those instead if I had to choose.","Daniellobo","Apr 13, 2011"

4.12,8.1,4,4.5,4,4,4,"The beer pours a deep amber color with a thick frothy off-white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a rich, malty scent that boasts of burnt toffee and caramel. It's mildly bitter with touch of alcohol warmth. The taste is good as well. It has a smooth, well balanced flavor that's bitter up front with an excellent malt flavor following. It's rich and flavorful with a delicate caramel/toffee feel and a moderate alcohol warmth. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a tasty brew that's true to style and easy drinking; another winner from the Leviathan series.","WesWes","Mar 03, 2011"
3.59,-5.8,5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Bitterness steps in a bit on the taste but not enough to offset the sweet onslaught of maltiness. Pretty smooth though, even with a notable alcohol bite at the end. Despite the lack of hop presence, I think this one would get better with age and some oxidation might add some needed complexity to the malts. Not bad, worthy of a four-pack purchase if you are into sweet English B-wines.","twiggamortis420","Feb 27, 2011"

I get a lot of sugar as well as some pine and orange notes. While there is some hop flavor, there is very little bitterness resulting in the beer being very sweet. The alcohol is barely detectable.

Tastes of malt, light alcohol, light caramel, hops, slight toasting, slight brown sugar, and yeast. Medium body. Oily, then lightly dry and slightly sticky texture. Average carbonation. Malt, toasted sugar, hop, and caramel finish is lightly dry. 10%ABV is quite obvious in the flavor, and noticeable in the aroma.

3.11,-18.4,4,3,3,3.5,3,"Clear, coppery chestnut with a thin skim of fine beige bubbles and a modest collar. Sticky, spotty lacing. The aroma is a bit overboard with ripe fruits, banana, strawberries, alcohol. Some grain and caramel in the background. It sort of grew on my, but was odd at first. The flavour was a combination of (burnt) sugary sweetness and alcohol, banana and other ripe fruits, with bitterness more apparent in the finish, which was oddly dry and quite warm. Moderate carbonation, full body, slightly creamy in texture. Decent overall, but the fruity character was a little too much for my liking.","DrJay","Dec 14, 2010"
3.65,-4.2,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"12oz. bottle served in my Old Stock snifter. Pours a translucent amber/caramel with a loose, quarter inch, tan-colored head that quickly disperses towards the edges into a thin, bubbly band. Nose expresses candied fruits (perhaps figs, prunes and/or raisins) and a light ethanol character. Taste consistent with nose; however, fruit character is a bit more subdued than anticipated, as is the alcohol. There's also a noticeable hops presence (closer to an American than an English barleywine in my opinion) and perhaps a slightly medicinal quality. Mouthfeel is medium-light, with an assertive carbonation and some residual alcohol heat/astringency detectable towards the back. Definitely not my favorite from this series - a little dull for the style. It might improve slightly with age; particularly in the mouthfeel department, but I don't see this as becoming overly stellar with age.","Jwale73","Dec 12, 2010"

3.86,1.3,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,"An aggressive, 'Bigfoot-like' hop burst hits the palate first, laying down bitter layers of pine sap and hop oils. The English inspired malt bill shows up nicely with a toasted toffee and near-medicinal grain character. Alcohol is present and breathy in the finish, but nowhere near hot considering the greenness of this beer. Mouthfeel is spot-on in terms of viscosity and carbonation level, allowing the hops to linger but not overwhelm the palate.
