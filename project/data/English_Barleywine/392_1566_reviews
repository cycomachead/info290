review_text
"This was easily the WORST thing i have EVER drank. It was like someone took a cheap red wine and mixed it with a cheap American lager (ala bud light). I bought a pack weeks ago and can't even get drunk enough to stomach it. Just. Frigging. Terrible."
""
"This beer has good taste from being to end. I'd buy it again"
""

"Overall I thought this was a nice beer and I thought it was it a nice example of an English Style Barleywine, but In the end it didn't turn out as great as some of the better ones I've had, it just lacked the complexity and big mouthfeel that some of that better ones seem to have and it left me wanting more.  This beer has nice drinkability, it's fairly smooth, not too cloying, slightly crisp, a little filling and the taste did a nice job at holding my attention, I think one is a good amount for me, I don't really have the urge to drink another one in a row.  What I like the most about this beer was how true to style it was, besides lacking it complexity it had pretty much all the things that I look for in the style.  What I like the least about this beer is the lack of complexity, that aspect could use some work.  I would buy this beer again, but I'm not going to go out of my way to stock up on it and I would say it worth a try if you are a fan of the style.  All in all I liked this beer, but I didn't love, it needs a little work, but I think it has potential.  IT's not a favorite Weyerbacher beer and it's right about average for the style.  Nice job guys, but I think with a little more work this could be a very nice Barleywine."

"So good! Tried it for the first time today just to get a high percentage in. Very pleasantly surprised."

"Awesome beer...little boozy, not more than one an evening for me..."
"The oxidation and higher alcohols definitely ruin this for me.  Not a very good or very well brewed beer.  I definitely wouldn't buy this again.  Drain pour. Blithering indeed,"
"Overall, this pours well and smells halfway decent, but the flavor and mouthfeel are rather bizarre and off-putting."
"Looked good. Had some interesting aromas (some sort of spicy hop or yeast note that was interesting), along with some bready maltiness. Fell apart on the taste and mouthfeel. Really muddy, nothing distinct or stand out shining through. Would not recommend. Still haven't found a decent Weyerbacher brew."

"A little light on the nose, and slightly dry for my tastes. But overall a great barley wine.  The newer batches must be much better then the old."

"Overall - People have compared this to cough syrup, and I have to agree that to an extent it does have a cherry cough syrup. Very little balance, no depth, and really just kind of a big ol' mess. Maybe it would age to something better, but I won't be the one to try it."

"Young for a barleywine. Give new batches some age."
""
""
"This is a pretty good beer(best served not too cold), and I usually love big hop finishes, but something about this beer just didn't sit quite right with me, which is a bit of a bummer."
""
""
""
"Overall:  This is a very, very, good barleywine!  Excellent, in fact!  It has great flavors of malt, brown sugar and maple syrup-like sweetness, dried stone fruit and a touch of hops.  The only thing keeping this barleywine from being world-class is the slightly less than perfect mouthfeel.  If it had a chewier mouthfeel, it would be world-class."
"A good representative of the style, though I think cellar aging could improve this by allowing the alcohol to settle down with the rest of the flavors.  I'll give this one another look in a year or so."

"Pure joy in my mouth!"

"Ok, a beer worth trying but probably never drinking again"
""
""
""
""
"Had to finish off Weyerbacher's locally available at some point, I guess trudging through brews like this is inevitable, wouldn't ever go near this again."
"Looked & smelled great, but went all down hill from there. Couldn't get past the strong cough syrup flavor. This one definitely needs to be aged, otherwise it's damn near undrinkable."
""
""
"Overall this is an intense version of the style, and one I would drink again, as I appreciate the occasional big bad malt bomb. However, I prefer to share it, as the syrupy sweetness can become a bit much."

"Poured a cloudy ruby-tinted copper with a barely-there white head. No lacing whatsoever. The aroma is light, but does have some nice caramel and dark fruit notes (I'm thinking dried figs). The taste is a little bit more robust, with a little more depth to the fruit and sugars and a nice warming effect from the alcohol. The body has a nice thickness to it and a little tingle to it on the finish."
""
""
""
"(I just read that this is an English Barleywine, which apposed to American Barleywines which are super hopped, these are more fruity. Makes sense, today I learned.)"

"Blithering Idiot is a good barleywine.  I found it to be quite drinkable.  Saying that, I should also say I am not a huge fan of barleywines, so keep that in mind."
"Pours a brown color with a big light brown foam head. Not much retention. A little bit of lacing. Nothing too out there in the aroma. Sweet caramel and bready malts. Slight hint of toffee. A bit of booze. Taste is a little underwhelming-- some dark fruits, most notably cherry and fig. Sweet malts. A ton of booze. Very poorly masked. A little bit of bitterness give it a sort of candy-like taste. Can't get over the alcohol, though. It is very offsetting compared to the slightly more subdued taste. Not a good combo. Not much carbonation. Easier to drink than you'd expect, but still not the most pleasant experience. Overall, not super impressed by my first entry into the English Barley Wine realm. Hopefully not a sign of the style as a whole."

"O: Better beer than what previous rankings give it credit for. If you wanted a barleywine than I would recommend Third Coast Old Ale by Bell's Brewery, which is great. Even though it is an American barleywine and Blithering Idiot is English, I think the styles are similar enough. Worth trying, especially if you are interested in this kind of brew"

"Take this review with a grain of salt..."
"Overall, didn't really enjoy this. I haven't tried it for some time, and it was really my gateway beer into higher alcohol and barleywine style beers. I remember enjoying it at the time, but I guess since then, I've found so much better options in both English and American style. Still a fondness for it, and you can't beat the name."

"O: In the mood for a barleywine from Weyerbacher? Get Insanity instead. The barrel aging takes the edge off of...well, pretty much everything about this one. I wouldn't even think about touching this again unless I knew it had at least a year on it - four months hasn't exactly done the trick. Weyerbacher's worst offering as far as I'm concerned."

"Not the most balanced barleywine, the fruitiness feels a bit chaotic, gets a bit too sweet and boozy close to the finish. Careful with this one or you'll end up talking like a ""blithering idiot""."

"I did not enjoy this beer. Smelled like a ripe banana after popping the cap ... even more so in the glass. Probably the strangest smelling/tasting beer I've ever had. I like the lack of hops, but I can't seem to like anything else. Again I'm reminded to do a more detailed analysis before I make a blind purchase."

"Overall this is a fairly nice barelywine that I have loved for quite some time. It could use a little more time in the bottle to get rid of a little bit of the sweetness but it is not bad in any way. Really this tastes like a small barleywine that could be a little thicker and more robust for the style. I love the beer and would love to drink it plenty but it just isn't a true barleywine as I have drank. It's a little thin and just not robust as I would expect. Still a great beer. For the ABV it certainly doesn't taste that strong. It tastes like it could be 8ABV instead of 11ABV so it does mask the alcohol and seems like a beer I could drink all day but certainly not a session beer due to the high ABV."

"Overall: I have quite a sweet spot for a decent barleywine - this one falls a little short of the mark though. It is a bit one-dimensional, but still a worthwhile drink every now and then."

"Appearance is a brownish copper with a half finger of head. The head dissipated rather quickly. The nose had the slight hint of sweetness. The malt flavors are not nearly as hearty as they should be considering the style. The lightness of the malt makes the alcohol tastes strong and intrusive. The only real highlight of this offering is the trace of dark fruits in the flavor."

"Had this with dinner at Brass Rail in Hoboken. Pours a deep beautiful red color, clear, with a nice creamy half finger head on top. Aroma is subdued with toffee, caramel, sweet brown sugar, some dark fruit. Flavor is big time malts: toffee, caramel, molasses maybe, some sweet sweet dark fruits like plums and figs. Very sweet brown sugar, heavy thick mouthfeel with low carbonation. Very solid barleywine and now looking forward to trying some Insanity."

"o: definitely a tasty English Barleywine. i would have liked the fruits in here to pop a little more, but for an 11+% beer, this drinks incredibly smooth. this is definitely a sweet beer that is a sipper. i think its worth picking up (i love sweet beers, and the English style barleywines)"
""
""
""
""
"Overall, the best thing about this brew is its aroma. This aspect of it is actually rather boastful, with each component taking a big stand, looking for all the attention. It was, however, disproportionate when followed by that flavoring, with huge booziness in the nose that was extremely dampened in the finished product on the palate. Perhaps this was to its benefit, hoping cloy would be more appealing to people than harshness. So that said, nothing was really offensive about this beer, it just came across as quite simple and light to the touch. Perhaps the nearly three years we put on it was to its detriment, but according to the brewer, they are confident that it improves up to five years in the bottle. We’d have to do a vertical to find out, but that just doesn’t seem very appealing at present. On a happy/interesting/mostly unrelated note, this is our first review since getting engaged earlier this week, so huzzah!!"

"Overall 3.00: This is an OK beer regarding its taste. However, that is probably not why people buy it. Regardless, this is a pretty good beer that is not recommended for sessioning, as the 11+% ABV will take you down the wobbly path to the village of Puke-Town, where you will be introduced to their leader, Mayor McToiletbowl."

"This isn't an amazing English Barleywine. To me it lacks a complex rich, toffee malt character. Instead it is just underattenuated malt."

"Overall: Conforming to style, yet not an impressive example. I will drink again, but only because I bought a 4-pack..."

"OK version. should have held my attension fermally yet failed."

"Full bodied, warming from the first sip. Not refreshing but not expecting it to be. A sipping brew, for certain. Finish is a bit bitter, a little rough. Overall, a nice brew, though."

"O - an enjoyable beer, though I wonder if would get more complex with age. More of a fan of the bourbon aged offering from them, but I would still recommend this for fans of the English barley wine style."

""
""
"Great English barley wine. I think Weyerbacher did a pretty good job on this one. English style barley wine is one of my favorite styles."
""
""
"Overall this beer was pretty average. My hope is that because this bottle might have malfunctioned the quality of this beer went down. I hope I get another chance to try thing one somewhere down the road."
""
"D: definitely a sipper. could use a bit of refinement. hot, age could help. this thing can do a lot better with some bourbon and since they do that (see Insanity) go try that version. it is exceptional."

"a mediocre english style barley wine. i like american styles better so admittingly my scores may be lower. served from a bottle into a snifter with a fingers worth of head that dissipated very quickly. dark brownish red color. smells of dark rum soaked fruits, raisins, dates and fairly hot alchohol. taste follows the nose well with hardly any hop prescence with a medium fairly heavy mouthfeel. not a horrible english style bw but weyerbacher , i feel needs to use more hops to cut the sweetness. i'm sure a few years in the cellar would do this beer good"

"This is a very solid English barleywine. It's worth checking out. This one ages extremely well too."
""
"O: Interesting take on a a barleywine – It went down smooth an easy."
"O- With all its pitfalls, this is a very drinkable barleywine. Not as incredible as Insanity, but it holds its own."
"O/D - There are good things about this beer. You can really tell it's 11% though, and not in a subtle way. The body is odd too. Not a bad barleywine, but probably needs time. Has potential, just needs to mellow out the boozy character. Lacked complexity for its ABV and style."

"Overall: coming into this beer, I was surprised by the alcohol content. A little intimated was another feeling also. Opening and pouring were normal, but the flavors and mouthfeel were slightly disappointing. The mild flavors were not impressive. I doubt I would try again, but would recommend only if someone wanted low hops and high ABV. Cheers!"
"O: Overall, I quite enjoyed this one. I think the palate profile is very similar to many Belgian Quads Ive had, but the taste and aroma are both real nice. The mouthfeel leaves a bit to be desired, but this is still a beer I would gladly drink again. Seems like a pretty nice base beer for barrel aging. Insanity is up next."

"Overall: Good beer but in my opinion not a step above good. If you want to get buzzed quick I guess it works but I want more than just that. Definitely needs tweaking but still worth a try. Salud!"
""
"Overall - not overly complex to me, but an unbelievably drinkable beer. If I sip 'er slow I could do another one or two 12-ouncers."
""
"The taste is mesmerizing. I can't properly convey what the taste is in words. The constituent parts wouldn't properly explain anything. What they are isn't important. It's how they come together in the perfect amounts that creates perfection. Or maybe it's just brewed with immense amounts of love. It's hard to say. Anyway, it has the intensity, smoothness, and complexity of a very old, aged whiskey. Which is not to say it tastes like one. There's no whiskey flavour. It's very strong. The alcohol is up front for sure, along with the smooth sweetness. It's a very sweet beer. But there's a lot going on in the background for you analysis connoisseurs. I'm not good with this part of the review, but it's definitely spicy. That apple flavour present in the nose is definitely there. Not green apples, but sweet apples. The hops are mostly spice hops, but there's some astringency on the finish as well. There's a bit of that apricot I detected on the nose in there as well, with about of that straw flavour. The rest is all malt complexity. It's too complex for me to understand, but there must have been several malts used in this. All I can say is they are all excellent and used in perfect proportion. Now I'm going to stop annoying myself by trying to analyze this for this review and sit back and enjoy this perfection, because that's what this beer is. It's pure perfection. You don't have to be a blithering idiot to appreciate it. But you'd have to be one not to give it a try. Beware the bite though. This stuff bites like 19th century cough medicine. So be warned, but if you're into that sort of thing, enjoy the hell out of it. I know I will."
""
"Overall-while I haven't had many barleywines I've had enough to see that this fails to compete with any of them. As I'm sipping this I keep thinking I'm drinking a strong dunkel not a barleywine. It's not very boozy for an 11% abv beer, so it has that going for it, but that is all. 3.25"
"A very average barleywine that runs off the track."
"Thanks to buschbeer for the trade!"
""
""
""
"A powerful beer. Full bodied. My first barley wine, so I can't compare to the other types. But it has a powerful approach with strong alcoholic push that is followed by a smooth and calm wash. Its very smooth. It will get you there quickly and you'll enjoy the ride. I took my time with it. So I had a chance to drink it cold and warm. Its actually better at room temperature if you plan to drink it slowly. Good stuff, especially in winter."
""
"Overall slighty disappointed with this beer, could use slightly more carbonation but it does hide its abv very well. It's like drink a red wine more than a beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"While this isn't Bigfoot, it's not half-bad. Certainly nowhere near a ""Poor"" rating, as the Bros have it. Maybe the recipe has changed since 2001, I don't know. But as it stands in 2013, it's not a bad brew at all. A bit on the weak side, flavor-wise, it pours with little head and not much aroma beyond the caramel sweetness. Taste is more of the same, with a substantially sweet viscous mouthfeel and decent carbonation. I'll give Weyerbacher credit for producing an 11.1% ABV brew with almost no detectable alcohol. It's certainly not my favorite barleywine, but it does fit the style fairly well and tastes halfway decent. More of a ""beginner's"" barleywine, lacking some substance and hop balance. There are better barleywines out there for the price, to be sure. But I'm glad I tried this at least. A solid B or B+ rating from me."
""
""
""
""
"O- I have to admit, that any high alcohol brew intimidates me to a degree, but I give this beer full marks! It is a highly smooth brew, with lots of rich, sweet malty goodness and the alcohol is so well hidden that you really don't realize that this sits at just over 11%. Very highly drinkable, I could easily put back a couple of these with relative ease, and would enjoy the feeling that I'm sure would eventually come along with these! I highly recommend this one and think anyone who really enjoys this style or is getting into it will appreciate it too! I will now enjoy the rest of this fine ale with a dinner of smoked sausage, sauerkraut, and perogies....this should pair up very well!"

"O- This was a pretty smooth and easy drinker, unlike a lot of barleywines, especially for the beefy ABV. With that being said, however, I thought this was one of the least complex barleywines I have had. My head wasn't spinning trying to track all of the aromas and flavors, like others have done."

""

"Overall, there was much in the aroma that promised a full, sugary, rounded Barleywine, but on the tongue the 11.1% ABV simply overpowered everything, giving the beer a heavy liqueur overtone. Were this actually a liqueur, it would be delicious—but for a Barleywine, it comes across as overly strong and not very finely nuanced. Admittedly, I'm drinking this fairly fresh off the bottling line, so I'm going to put the rest of the four-pack in the cellar for a year or so and hope that the beer calms down."

"O: A good barley wine. The taste of the graps is a bit too strong, which makes it harder to drink it after the first glass; but I don't expect anything else from a barley wine."

"Let's call a spade a spade: they named this beer well."

"D: An ok example of the style, but not great. There is something to think about, but it is not very complex. Probably worth trying if you like the style, but I won't purchase again."
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- It's fairly plain for a barleywine, but pleasant nonetheless. I don't know how old it is, but the hopping is subtle. I probably wouldn't seek this one out, but I wouldn't pass it up either. At $2 for the bottle I definitely don't regret the purchase."
"Overall – Not bad.. I expected a little more sweetness. It's a little bit thin. I've got a few more to age so maybe the booze will tone down a bit. A decent beer but not something I'd buy again with so many world class BW's to choose from."
""
""
""
"Overall - doesnt look, smell, or feel that bad, its just the taste that makes me want to enjoy other examples of the style. The lack of hops are glaring in this; coupled with the almost autolyzed yeast character, I don't see me enjoying this again. Which is surprising as I am a big fan of other Weyerbacher beers."
""
"O: Very strong beer. Not much to look at, but the cherries and toast was nice. Good winter ale."
""
""
""
""
""
"this is an interesting beer, suitable for holiday time. the pours is a copper to red color, mostly clear but with some yeast floaters hanging around under a short white head. the aroma is heavy on the honey, with notes of dried cherries, english caramel malt, and a touch of holiday spice. the alcohol is toxic in this beer though, its at the forefront in the nose and taste, and really burns through any subtle flavors that might make this a better beer. one bottle is more than enough of this one i though. the body is full and the bubbles are plentiful, but its just not something anyone could handle too much of. my least favorite of the weyerbacher big beers case, i just thought the alcohol potency overshadowed the intended flavor profile."
"12 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 5/10/2012. Pours lightly cloudy reddish orange color with a nice 1 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of big cherry, raisin, prune, fig, caramel, molasses, toast, banana, light clove, bread, earth, and light herbal spiciness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of maltiness. Taste of cherry, raisin, molasses, caramel, toast, fig, bread, herbal, clove, earth, and banana. No bitterness at all on the finish; with lingering notes of cherry, dark fruits, molasses, caramel, toast, banana, light clove, bread, earth, and herbal on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of malty flavors; with zero cloying sweetness present on the finish. Light-medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a creamy and very slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Definitely a sipper at 11.1%. Overall this is a very nice English Barleywine style. Very nice flavor complexity and balance of malt sweetness; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering. I enjoyed this much more than my first rating; not sure what went wrong with that bottle."

""
"Overall: Just not that excited by this beer; would have preferred a bit more hop elements even though I recognize that this is in the English barleywine style"
"a very nice beer overall, very sweet, yet has a subtle bitterness.. a nice alcohol warmth and the boozy flavor wears off after the first sip. very complex beer and very fulfilling."
""
"Overall, a decent English barleywine. Nice and creamy bit a bit one dimensional."
""
"Pours a cloudy copper. Aroma is extremely inviting with rich malt, rum raisins, and toffee. Tons going on here. Brown sugar, banana, raisins, toffee, even a hint of bubble gum. Plenty of the requisite malt, too. Amazingly, the alcohol only shows up warmth and dryness in the finish. And at a giant 11.1% ABV, that is quite a task! I see where the name came from. It is dangerously smooth, complex, and tasty. Deceptively potent"
""
"Pours copper with a khaki head. Aroma shows plenty of caramel, light molasses, nuts, and a touch of alcohol. Flavor shows the same with additional notes of raisins, brown sugar covered grapefruit, dates, and some earthy hops. Overall body is moderate to full, somewhat sweet, and finishes with a hint of warming alcohol."

"Overall - Well not really one I enjoyed as much as I was hoping. A little too much rum booze and a somewhat off bitter finish which prevented me from finding it anything I would want to go back to again."
""
""
""
"Full mouth that commands one to sip, rather than gulp this one down. Flavors of sweet candied malts, figs, raisins, and hoppy syrup (is that a thing?). Tart fruit-like character on the finish. A little boozy, but not as detectable as anticipated. This was a decent offering, but given its richness as well as its sweetness, it became a bit tiring as the 12oz went along. Not sure I'd sit down with this one again."
""
"O- nit bad, but not the greatest.... its already been put away for 7 months, and it def not s boozey as it was before but I still don't see not complexity or layering on the beer.... lost cause? I really hope not...."
"Overall: I like barleywine; I was disappointed."
"Pretty good barleywine, definitely enjoyable, might try aging the next one I get. Enjoyed big foot more, this one appears a bit tired in comparison, slightly sour and tart hops here. Although I won't rush to get this again, its not bad."
""
"O - I bought this one and a Weyerbacher Insanity. I really hope the Insanity fares better than this subpar offering."

"This was a solid Barley-Wine Ale with some of the typical qualities one would expect. I was a little disappointed with the lack of hop character - probably due to the English theam. I guess SN Bigfoot has me spoiled."
""

""
""
"O: Overall; MALT. This beer warms up nicely and winds up with a nice caramel/brown sugar, fruity flavor. Still some room for improvement. However a very good beer regardless."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I found this to be quite enjoyable. Nice taste profile, and the bready malt, dark fruit, and sweetness all mesh well together. There's some heat from the 11.1 ABV, but it's not over-powering. A really nice interpretation of an English Barleywine."
""
"This is a nicely flavored beer. The alcohol is present and slows down the drinking a bit. Otherwise, it is a really decent offering with a solid body and good, malty flavor."

""
"D/O- Well I didn't think this was hitting me as hard as it now has getting to the end of the review. Appearance/Aroma/Flavors didn't really do a whole hell of a lot for me and now I why its rated the way it is. Pass on this one for just about any other English Barleywine."
""

""
""
""
""
"O- Nice Barleywine, nothing really stands out, but well-rounded and tasty."
""
""
""
""
"O: I have to say that at first sip it is very, very harsh. You have to take a few sips and let it linger to acclimate yourself to the high alcohol. I think this one needs to be room temperature also. It's actually pretty good once you make it past the initial shock. Still the alcohol could be scaled back to say 9% to make it more drinkable from the start. But it's unique in it's own right and they have their own niche with this one."

"A bit of strong alcohol presence lowers my experience of the mouthfeel overall. Not the best barley wine I've had but I could envision some improvement with age and a better blending of the flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: this is a beer that just happens to suit my taste. It doesn't have the crazy complexity of, say, a JW Lees vintage ale, but it has the big, face-crushing malt you might find in two of my favorite styles: tripel and wee heavy."
""
"O: A pretty out of whack English barleywine here from Weyerbacher. Although they are never ones to shy away from high ABVs, I think this 11.1% whomper is one that could've been scaled back a bit in the name of balance and not just ""boozy, hot mess."""

"O: This beer is a just a hint to sweet for me to consider it an easy to drink beer. Also, the high ABV makes this a sipping beer and definitely not a session beer (there is no way that I could have more than one of these in a session). There is just a hint of too much alcohol presence for me to really enjoy."
"12 Oz bottle poured into Stone Old Guardian glass. Appearance is a tawny color with a mild haze. Dense tan head retains nicely and leaves thick layer of lacing. The smell is malt forwards with caramel and molasses along with dark fruits and earthy character. The taste is rather fruity with candied grapes and cherries, the taste is similar to a BSDA. Candi sugar is present as well. The finish is incredibly sweet with little hop character to keep the sweetness in check. The mouth feel is a medium body with high carbonation. Overall, this beer seems to be out of the parameter for an English Barleywine, however it does have some good flavors working."

"O: Decent now, I think this would age extremely well. Only knocking this down below 4 because of the large alcohol presence, which would of course get subdued by aging. Definitely along the lines of most of the English barleywines I've had, which seems to be difficult for American breweries to pull off, with all the hopping, barrel-aging, etc. going on. Again, certainly good now, but I'll let time take care of the other few bottles I have"

"O: simply because this beer was so unremarkable, I had to give it an average mark. This is my 2nd Weyerbacher, and my 4th (or 5th?) English barleywine, but I have been loving the barleywines I've been drinking so much (even though it seems the majority are considered American barleywines) that this beer simply underwhelmed me."
"I'm used to big american barleywines with crazy high IBU's, and the ability to strip paint off walls. And I like that but, this is a good change."

"Pours a copper orange color, lightly hazed, little cap of cream colored head, light ring with little lacing. Scent brings big notes of dark dried fruit such as prune and raisin, strong notes of brown sugar, quite bready and yeasty when the strong scents calm down, light grassy and earthy hop aroma. Taste brings light caramel and brown sugar in unison with dark dried fruit, despite its age, the warm alcohol touches on solvency, hops are grassy and struggle to find a place. Medium bodied, low carbonation yest still thin for the style. Overall, some good strong flavor and scent notes, but nothing jumps out as world class."
"Pours a slightly murky orange-brown with a 1/2 inch foamy tan head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots and streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, brown sugar, and some metallic aromas. Taste is of malt, metal, and burnt brown sugar. This beer has a low level of carbonation with an almost flat mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty poor beer with some off aromas and flavors."
""
"Thin half finger head on a garnet and crimson murky body with excellent lacing. Nice sweet aroma with mostly bubblegum, plum, grapes and vanilla. Flavor is malty with citrus, pine, molasses and figs. Medium body and moderate carbonation. Overall a mild barley wine which isn't as sharp or difficult to get used to as many which helps its drinkability however the flavors are understated slightly effecting it's complexity."
""
""
""
"Drink- A tad bit diferent but not as bad as everyone says. Its bold and big. Id have it again"
"O: I was excited to try this one after the pour but I knew from the first sip this was going to be a drain pour. An overly boozy, watery mess here. Oh the difference barrel aging can make. I can't believe Insanity is made from the same base beer."
"This isn't the best barleywine I've had, but it isn't the worst (that nod goes to Boulder Beer's Killer Penguin). I'm not a big Weyerbacher fan in general but this one is worth a few dollars to try."

"Medium body, somewhat syrupy. Alcohol in the finish, quite nice and warming. I certainly wouldn't say no to another, but I wouldn't seek it out."
"O: Slightly too sweet for my liking. I like my English Barleywines a little thicker, a little more malty and with a more of a dark fruit flavor."
""
"D - Love BWs. THis one is a little messy, but fun."
"Drinkability: Good beer overall. Enjoyable to drink, goes down very smooth. Goes well with steak."
"Love the name and pours a murky brown amber hue which leaves a wispy one finger head that doesnt stay and leaves very little lacing almost flat looking but not and the smell is boozy sweet alcohol,barley sugar,marzipan and xmas pudding,the mouthfeel is medium bodied and a tad syrupy with tastes of fruit cake,marzipan,caramel candy,candied figs and finished with a overdose of toffee sweetness and overall its only above average with a weak mouthfeel that doesnt suit and to be honest it be nice with dessert due to the massive sweetness but other than that i would not revisit or pay good money for as it really is sweetbomb that is far from balanced cheers."
""
""
"O- I found this barley-wine to be very overly sweet. A rare disappointment from Wyerbacher. Not necessarily bad but definitely not my kind of barley wine. I found it to be kind of bland in the sense that it didn't have the bready profile that most English barley wines have. Kind of light really. Definitely wouldn't spend my money on this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Seems like a typical average barley wine. Nothing that makes it stand out over any others. Would drink it again, but not on the top of the list."

"Good barleywine. B+, which seems to be where I've ranked all the Weyerbacher beers I've ever had."
""
""
""
"OVERALL: This was quite good. Surprisingly enjoyed it, as I'm not normally a big barleywine fan. Good flavor profile with enough bitterness to balance the sweet malty flavor, and a really nice feel to support it all. A quality brew and worth checking out if you get the chance. Recommended."
""
""
"Poured a murky darkened amber into dimpled mug with no head whatsoever to speak of. Smells of malt, dried fruits like plum and raisin, maybe a little cherry with zero hop at all, as an English type Barleywine typically is more malty sweetness. Wow, blast of sweetness with a velvety thick finish without any carbonation at all. Mouthfeel is sweet malty velvet that coats the tongue with the aforementioned plum and raisin and a good strong alcohol presence that warms and makes this the perfect winter weather sipper. Another good one from Weyerbacher."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a good beer for a cold winter night; it has a 'warming' effect which just might be due to all the alchohol. This brew would be better with a few more hops and spices to mask the strong alchohol taste."
""
""
""
"O - Overall nothing too special. Taste and smell don't have a ton of character and the lingering alcohol potency is probably a bit strong."
""
"Beer is medium in body, chewy, sweet, it is fine, decent barleywine. Not a whole lot going on here. It is a little bitter on the end, a little boozy on the front, the body is sweet and syrupy. I might have it again if there was nothing else."
""
""
""
""
"Overall i really like this beer, going to have to pick up some more to cellar."
"Full bodied with excellent carbonation, this beer could definitely be more than just a sipper if not for the 11.1% ABV. The body coats your mouth well and has a bit of a sticky quality to it. The carbonation is slightly fizzy but is definitely needed to help keep the body from becoming syrupy."
"O-Although it is an English Barleywine a little more in the way of hops would have done this beer some good. It just seemed to be missing a little in the way of hops."
""
"Some Weyerbacher beers are as uninspiring as the labels that adorn them."
""
"O- just an average barleywine with a too sweet syrup profile"
""

"3, 4, 4, 4, 3.5"

"Overall, a very nice barleywine style ale that's not as heavy as others."
""
"Overall-I like this beer, I like it a lot. I purchased a 4 pack at the store after eyeing it put for several weeks. I am sipping on now and have decieded to put the other three away in my beer Cellar. There is a lot of alcohol present as some did mention. It is a Barleywine so I expected that. I am very interested to see how it matures over time."
""
""
""
""
"O: A good beer. They could have stepped back the alcohol a bit, but the alcohol doesn't destroy the other flavors, but doesn't exactly enhance them either. Definitely worth a look."
"O - Good. Would have liked more complexity, and more flavor in general. Not something I'll come back to in a hurry, but not something I'd turn down either. Probably very dangerous - super drinkable per its ABV."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O-This calls for more fruit notes. Since high alcohol looking forward to how it is in five years. Hops would have done this good as well. Not a bad brew, just overly Sweet."
""
""
"Overall, one the best balanced, smooth and easy drinking barleywines I've ever had."
""
""
""
"O- good English Barleywine . Not real complex but has nice sweet taste and dark fruit notes that complement each other well."
"Right now this beer seems like a sweet mess, but it has more potential than any beer I have tasted. Obviously, it is nothing compared to its barrel aged cousin, but an enjoyable sipper nonetheless. What throws me, though, is the belgian-ness of the beer. It reminds me more of a tripel or quadruple than a barleywine."

""
""
""

""
"I love Insanity that much better and Idiot's Drool even more so. Weyerbacher rocks. Most people cannot handle the abv but I can and enjoy all their brews."

"O: A nice barleywine. Nothing wild or crazy, just a very solid traditional barleywine. Not much of a barleywine drinker, but I am glad I bought a 4 pack of this beer and will enjoy it next time I have one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Low complexity but the flavors are true. Quite drinkable and glad I tried it. Wouldn't mind having another. Age might help this one-- I might cellar one for a year and see what that yields."
"Overall: A nice barleywine I can check off as good. Nicely impressed by this beer and it was still good for till sometime in 2016. Could only imagine how an older one would taste. AS most barleywines, they get better with age. Alcohol will most likely be more well hidden as the beer gets older."
""
"One thin finger of light tan froth top a muddy brown body; not a lot of duration and lacing, not surprisingly for the style. Subtle smells of toasted malt, and some rum-soaked cherries. Good taste, a bit boozy, loaded with boozy cherries, berry, and hazelnut. Smooth, easy-going despite the 11% ABV, Blithering Idiot is a nice representative of the style which isn't one of my favorites. I certainly prefer the more hopped-up versions, especially in American Barleywines. This, however, is pretty good, and worth a try."
""
"Not bad but nothing spectacular. Easy drinking for an 11% abv. So yeah, a few of these would make you a blithering idiot."
""
"Overall this beer took a little time to grow on me. It helped when the beer warmed more."
""
""
"Poured into a tulip. Deep reddish caramel color with a thin white head, not much retention. Smell sweet of cherries and burned sugar and caramel. Faint alcohol on the nose as well. Taste doesn't have much up front but hits sweet and balanced on the finish. Has a very faint metallic off-taste that I've picked up in some of my homebrews, but barely there. Pretty good but not as robust as I'd expect from a big barleywine. The alcohol is not well hidden. Pretty drinkable, but again, that's not what I really expect from an 11.1% barleywine."
""
""
""
"Drink and overall: Ahh, it's drinkable. It's a solid beer. I wouldn't buy another six pack, honestly."
""
"This is a better brew when it's matured. Drink it young, and it's not so swell. Let this age a few years, and it pays off. Very good when it's properly matured a few years. When it;s consumed shortly after bottling, it's rather mediocre and unbalanced."
""
"overall - if i had this close to me id probably pick some up regurarly"
""
""
""
"Not what I expected for a barelywine. I haven't had many, but I would not say I would have this for a first experience. One to sip on considering the higher ABV. Maybe one I would start with and migrate from quickly during an evening out. But good none the less."

"O - As much as I love Weyerbacher, I have had this beer many times and am still slightly underwhelmed by it. Insanity on the other hand is an amazing beer. This one is a nice go to barleywine that I can find anytime."
"Like It? Have Had Better"
"O: A fairly good barleywine that is tasty and easy enough to drink, though it lacks depth and complexity, intensity, and could use a little more sweetness for the style (a little too much carbonation too)."
"Not bad."
"Again, 1 year later: big ass. Booze died down a bit. Just pummeled black-ass overripe fruit."
"O: Lots of strong flavors are present in this beer, but they are drowned out by the burn of alcohol, which lingers in the back of the throat. As the bros warned, this beer needs to sit and age until the alcohol mellows."
"o - very yummy beer. quite drinkable for the 11.1%. i would buy this again for sure"
"I don't understand the low ratings here; it's a perfectly acceptable, strong barleywine-style, albeit not refined"
"Meh."
"O: I liked this beer a lot. A real sipper at 11.1%, although the alcohol isn't as overwhelming as the percent would dictate."
"Pours a deep amber color w/ a nice one finger cocoa head. Good carbonation and lacing on my snifter glass. Somewhat cloudy in appearance as well. Nose is a little underwhelming to me. Some cherry, fig, alcohol, sweetness. Very understated, and not as aromatic as I'd like. Definitely not up to the best for this style. Taste is smooth, but same as the nose. I'm just not feeling this beer, and I really like most of this breweries offerings. It just doesn't have the punch, character or complexity as a good English Barleywine has. Feel is alright, sweet and somewhat light and syrupy. A fairly simplistic feel for this style. Overall, this is a little bit of a let down. Weyerbacher makes some great brews overall... Unfortunately, this one is slightly better than mediocre for the style."
"Not to bad overall I'd like to try one with a few years on it for sure."
"The low rating is probably based on fresh tastings, and it should be aged a bit."
"O: This is a great barleywine. Not sure what people are crying about who give it Bs and Cs, I've had barleywines FAR worse than this one."
"The taste is a full malty blend of toasted caramel and is augmented by some slight creamy tinges which are accented by a slight cinnnamon-like woodiness which transitions to an alcohol flavor which brings a warmth and dryness on the throat + carries on to the belly with some subtle toffee that lingers after the swallow. There is a mild pine that emerges as it ners cellar temp with the fusel in the tertiary taste. Overall mot a great barleywine, but better than some in the style. I give thos props fo the aroma and taste but there is more fusel alcohol in this than I prefer for my personal taste."
"D - not awful by any means, but the high alcohol is probably the culprit here in the negative points. the flavors, head, and body are muted in favor of pure diesel power. however, would definitely be a good stepping stone beer to get into more complex brews as a beginner"
"O-Overall, I had my questions, but it turned out to be a pretty good interpretation of the style. Good beer!"
"The taste itself is much, much more bland. Where did those flavors go that came through in the nose? It's not bad... it's even somewhat smooth... but the flavor just isn't there. I won't drain pour the rest of this, but I'm not dying to take more sips. I think it's about time to break out the rum and make some hurricanes!"
"Drinkability – An alright English barleywine, although the flavor profile seems a bit lacking in complexity. It starts off on a good not, but the dark fruit fizzle into a generically sweet finish. Worth purchasing a bottle to try. I enjoyed it."
"The mouth is definitely the best part, packing a silky smooth texture. Time has obviously taken away some of the offending elements, but it still feels incomplete and I think a few more years wouldn't hurt. It definitely has its moments, but compared to Abacus and Gratitude, it's underdeveloped."
"It's not nearly as good as insanity, and I wouldn't seek it out again, although if you're a die-hard barleywine fan you'll probably like this one."
"overall, a decent english BW, but insanity (bourbon barrel aged version) was so much better. it almost tastes like a completely different beer. i would definatly recommend insanity over this. maybe this would fare a little better with some age?"
"Overall: Big, boisterous- yet smooth barleywine. Just a tad over the top. Despite the big taste profile, sip this and enjoy the complexities."
"With about 1.5 years on it, Blithering Idiot is a MUCH better beer. The alcohol content is still formidable, but the sweetness is tempered, allowing the wonderful maltiness of this brew to shine through. Huge notes of toffee, dates and bourbon, even though this stuff ain't barrel-aged. Definitely let this one sit for a while before drinking. Upping this to a ""B" from a ""C". Cheers!"
"overall not a bad barleywine very enjoyable and balanced"
"This is just a great beer. I was a little surprised at how good this beer is, from the reviews that I had read. I love it though. At $12 for a four pack, I think this is a real good deal."
"o-def a good beer for colder weather. has a nice warming touch at the end which it welcome when the temps drop."
"Overall this surprised me I was expecting a disaster but this turned out alright. Certainly not the best I've had though."
"Overall - Really sweet and smooth. This one is for sure occasional drink, as its just too sweet. You would become a blithering idiot of not careful from its 11% alcohol and as easy it is to drink. Would like to try this one age a few years to maybe lesson the sugars?"
"Overall, this was a very soilid beer. Easily one that should be sought out as it was readily available and somewhat affordable. I would have no issue in trying this one again any day."
"O- A really well built English BW. Very available, and I wish I could afford to drink this daily. You can definately get where Insanity gets its backbone from before the barrel aging. I can't wait to try some with a few years on it!"
"The tastes begin with the sweet caramel malts again and sweet fruitiness. Dates, figs, orange, and lesser plums. As it opens up more you get a great deal of toffee and complex maltiness; lesser brown sugar notes. Slight earthy, maybe a little citrus hop flavors and bitterness but it stays true to it's English style. The mouthfeel is full with adequate carbonation. More carbonation than most which makes the ABV less detectable, and raises the drinkability for me. Overall a great English Barleywine, and remains under-appreciated in my opinion. Weyerbacher continues to deliver great beer after great beer."
"The only negative being it's english is hardly no hop bitterness but it's forgiven since the alcohol is well concealed. A very nice beer."
"Cheers!"
"-JH-"
"M. Medium bodied but sticky going down. Slightly drying at the end. The alcohol provides just a little hint of bite if you take a big sip."
"Overall, this is quite a tasty barleywine. I'm looking forward to the Insanity I have in the fridge..."
"O - Ok, but a little too rich and sweet for me. Lingering caramelly malt flavors are just over the top."
"Drinkability is similarly just okay, good I guess for the gravity, but I feel like I'd need to revisit it when the bottle has more age just to see if anything more can be pulled out of it. I would lean towards saying no. The main flaw (mouthfeel) can't really be corrected with age."
"Nose is loaded with sweet toffee and bready malt, real boquet of floral esters. Taste offers a sweet bread malt, toffee, dark fruits, strong ethanol in the finish bordering on solvent, brown sugar, raisins, bit of earth, some dryness in the finish. Proper flavors but the booze is overbearing, especially considering the body is a little thin for the ABV. Nice smooth carb, decent beer but simply too boozy and solventy for any more than a bottle."
"Overall, slightly different than the past blithering's i've had from this past year; biggest difference was the yeast in suspension and the slightly cloying flavors."
"D: Not my favorite barleywine. Not much sweetness to it. The complexity was there, but not the good kind. Go get Old Horizontal or Bigfoot."
"O: Decent, but very alcoholic, barleywine. 3.5"
"Pours a deep reddish orange with a big thick fluffy white head that sticks and laces itself to the sides of the glass. Smells is very raisiny, very deep fig like, dark fruit indeed, nice sugary malts with a spicy kick to it. Big hot alcohol plums can be found when smelling around the glass also. Pale sugary malt taste fills the mouth, alcohol sting, sweet hops, alcohol, little chocolates and other dark sweets can be found. This is medium to full bodied sugary candy blast. It leaves the mouth dry with a lot of resin on the tongue and teeth. I had alot of problems with the feel of this beer, it was very creamy but also seemed to be almost flat at times, not very enjoyable and killed the experience of the beer for me. This beer has alot of issues that i dont think ill try again to see if they figured it out."
"I picked this bottle up in Florida a couple weeks ago. It pours a medium bodied, cloudy dark orange on the verge of amber. It looks kind of thick and syrupy. It smells of some serious sweet carmel malts, pale malts, and seriously faded hops. It's a let down from that perspective. For a barleywine this sure hasn't held up well, even over the past five or six months. It tastes of pale malts, syrup, brown sugar, carmel malts, and honey. It is a malt BOMB! There is ZERO hop presence. It drinks pretty syrupy and is overly sweet and leaves the sweetness behind in the aftertaste. Booo! This beer is not a good representation of the style. It's just malty syrup. Drainpour...."
"This beer pours a deep brown color, with a white head. The aroma is sweet smelling with some piney hops in the mix. The flavors are there but not in the biggest way. It's a bit watery on the mouthfeel. This beer could be a lot better, I know a lot of people who love this beer for it's strength. Whenever I talk to people about strong beers they ask me about this one. It's a decent barley wine but it's not the greatest. I think people from around here like it so much because It's local and that cool to show support for the home team."
"Just after I finish the beer; I stand up too quickly and I get light headed. I have become the idiot."
"overall a bit strong, I'm gonna cellar the rest to see if the heat dies down and the flavors blend a bit better."
"Delicious....but don't expect to down a 6-pk by yourself!"
"I poured this into a pint glass, it has a dark copper body and very little head to it. The smell is sweet and malty, with a little fruit hops coming threw. The taste is like medicine and bubble gum flavored, with a hint of barley on the back of the tongue. The mouth feel is hard and not smooth. I really didn't enjoy this beer."
"Overall: How is this terrible beer the base beer for Weyerbacher's infinitely better Insanity?"
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability - A very unpleasant, musky and old tasting beer. Wheat and fruit domiinate the taste, but are combined poorly. Overall a very dissapointing barleywine."
"D: Very tasty. 4 pack gone."
"D: This is good and shows very little alcohol."
"D: I have poured this beer out. Trash."
"The mouthfeel is on the heavier side with carbonation being a bit below average. Drinkability was not bad, it was a pretty good beer overall. Not an outstanding beer of the style, but a good one at the least."
"Overall a fantastic Barleywine Ale with an abundance of flavor that does an awesome job of concealing the high alcohol content."
"All in all, this is a great drinker (sipper if you will) and a strong ass beer. A little misrepresented style wise, but every Brewery has a different scope of view. I had no problem with my 12oz."
"Deep and cloudy amber hue with a quickly diminishing head leaving a little bit of lacing on the glass as you drink. Nothing huge bursts out of me with the smell but I can smell some dried fruit and alcohol. Big, inviting, creamy mouthfeel that balances out some of the alcohol taste, which is strong but not as overbearing as some 11 percent beers I've had. Alcohol tends to linger on the back of the throat though and may deter some. I would drink another one, but not too many. Probably wouldn't buy a 6 pack of it though."
"Pours a dark copper color with a good white head. Starts out with two fingers and fades down into a moderately-sized collar with some film on top. The nose is fairly sweet with a bit of dark fruits. Quite a bit of sweetness coming through along with some cherries. Taste is mildly sweet with a bit of malt and caramel. A bit of yeastiness comes through as well. Difficult to pin down. The yeast reminds me of Harpoon's house ale yeast. Drinks pretty well, though there's nothing too noteworthy about it. I don't get much other than the yeast, though that portion is distinctively American."
"D: Alcohol is fairly noticeable. A good sipping beer."
"Pours a nice looking medium to deep copper with a fluffy off white head. Aroma is of dried fruits, some caramel and a hint of alcohol. Taste is sweet, fruity, more malty than hoppy. Some alcohol is definitely present in the taste. Mouthfeel is thick, sweet, and a bit sticky. Carbonation is low, but adequate. Not my favorite barleywine, definitely could benefit from a bit of hop presence."
"considerably warm and fuzzy. the alcohol seems to come out a lot in this one. right amount of carbonation and slight bitterness makes this a decent tasting and drinkable beer. However the burn seems to catch up with you, hindering the experience."
"M&D: The alcohol content on this one is everpresent and you are reminded of it on every exhale. I, for one, kinda like this as it's also relatively low on bitter hops. The carbonation is slight, making it easy to drink. It's a very dangerous beer as it's so tasty without bitterness, you could easily wind up the buffoon pictured on the bottle... a blithering idiot."
"D: Considering its strength, this beer is not that difficult to drink, although there's no way I could have more than one of these at a time."
"d: it's not horrible, but i wouldn't drink more than one in a sitting."
"D: Jesus this was bad. I have no desire to try this again."
"Often, this is pretty decent. Like most in the style, it's best relatively warm(er). A little confusion/clashing of flavors and/or sensations, but this is a mostly flavorful decent interpretation of the style. Needs a little refining or age, though."
"Overall, this is a fairly good barley wine, worth a try. I am also aging one bottle hoping that it gets even better with time."
"D/M: a bit intense at first, complexity is very nice, slight alcohol burn is not overwhelming, little to no carbonation tingle, sits smooth on the palate and suprisingly light in the stomach"
"This beer poured a ruby like amber color, that was very hazy, and small amounts of head, typical of a barleywine. There was a strong alchool smell. The taste was similar to a red wine; a strong grape like flavor, a good but not overpowering kick from the alchool. Nicely carbonated. Overall a good beer, not the best barleywine, but drinkable and enjoyable."
"D - Rated a bit lower because of the strong ABV is good nonetheless and would have again."
"12 oz bottle. Pours clear orange with a thick, creamy off-white head. Aroma is of piney hops, caramel malt and ripe fruit (some cherry and pear). Full, smooth, creamy body. Piney hops, caramel malt, ripe fruit and brown sugar are perfectly balanced on a palate. Long, bitter-sweet finish. I enjoyed this brew a lot by the fireplace."
"not sure if my palate has drastically changed or if the beer has, but what i'm drinking now is nowhere near as good as what i noted in the above review. hugely malty / boozy and not too complex. not doing much for me at all; a shell of the beer those comments described."
"This one simultaneously begs me to sip it slower and drink it faster. One of the better beers in it's style that I've tried. I think it's scores are a bit lower because it's not an American hop-monster barleywine. Don't buy it if you're looking for another Bigfoot or Old Guardian, but if you're looking for a nice malty English-style barleywine, this one might suit you well."
"A slow sipper for sure. A good solid English Barleywine. Flavorful and warming."
"For some reason I remember hearing nothing but good things about this beer, honestly im a bit disappointed. I was hoping for more of a tongue punch but I just get a super sweet malt bomb. WHERE ARE THE HOPS?"
"D: Very drinkable but if you are able to store and save for a year its very much worth the time and wait but awesome drinker as you buy it as well."
"I'll finish the 12 oz. bottle, but it misses the mark on many notes. Not a very drinkable beer. Hard to kick back on a winter night tasting your wife's nail polish remover."
"D. Drinkable Barleywine without a doubt. No real alcohol presence at all in this one. Not an overly complex beer in terms of flavor, but a very solid offering nonetheless."
"Drink ability is okay despite the high alcohol content. This is another sipper, though, with a medium body it isn't too filling."
"An adequate beer. This would have fit my preferred style back when I first started drinking craft beer- it is a pretty simple beer- sweet, a bit of spice, and a load of alcohol that is well hidden."
"d- not my style exactly but it's not terrible, i suppose it's one of the better barleywines i've had but thats not saying too much."
"D - It's a big beer and it's not afraid to let you know it. The alcohol will definitely slow you down."
"D - Excellent to sip. Wasn't difficult to finish by myself in two six ounce pours. Would be excellent to share with another. Absolutely going to be one of my annual pick ups, one pack to drink, one to age."
"Drinkability: It's not bad, and I certainly wouldn't turn one down, but it's not likely something I'll seek out again in the near future. The smell and flavors are solid enough, but the body hurts it, and the high ABV prevents more than one being put down in a night. Worth trying, not sure if I would actually pick this up to age as the body isn't likely to improve."
"D: Not bad, and definitely drinkable for the ABV, just nothing special."
"Overall, not very impressive, however if I just wanted to get messed up, not a bad call as easy to drink."
"D - it is a strong zipper but its a damn tasty one. Very little alcohol makes this amazingly easy to drink and the flavors are awesome. Very tasty barelywine."
"D: Pretty low. Its damn boozy, malty and sweet."
"This brew has a great taste. It does down pretty well, but is a very filling brew. It also has a nice punch as well. A wonderful representation of the style, but a person who doesn't drink barleywines very often might have a hard time with this brew. I enjoyed it to the very end. I am also glad I purchased a 4 pack so I can enjoy the rest."
"Poured from bottle into a mini imperial pint. Hazy burnt orange liquid with a creamy off white head that fades quickly to a ring at the edge of the glass. Smell is a nice balance of fruity hops and sweet malt, some alcohol in there as well. Taste is very sweet cherries, tropical fruit, some hop bitterness, alcohol warmth, bitter finish. Mouthfeel is a heavy body with a medium/light carbonation - maybe a bit more carbonation then the style usually gets but I found it helped the finish be a bit cleaner rather then sweet and sticky. Drinkability is good, not my favorite barleywine, but a decent example of the style."
"A very drinkable high alcohol content barley wine that i was content with drinking. I'm no expert on the physics involved with deciphering specific ingredients, but for an 11%'er it was damn good, with a grapey flavor to it almost. Reminded me of a belgian style ale, minus the bavarian yeast and booziness. The best i've had thus far from this brewing company. Not a big fan of barley wines, but highly recommend trying one of these bad boys."
"D: I'm not a big Weyerbacher fan. However, this one really works for me, I don't taste ANY alcohol in it, and find it ""gulpable," especially for a Barleywine. I'll go out on a limb here and say it's Weyerbacher's best beer..."
"I enjoyed this quite a bit. Great value, and fairly easy to find."
"Otherwise - top notch."
"D: I liked this brew, but I liked Insanity (the barrel-aged version) more for its complexity and mellow greatness. I still think this is underrated and will look forward to trying this from the cellar in years to come."
"I poured into a snifter to one finger of tan head. The beer is a murky orangish brown. The aroma reminds me of spiced cider. It has a fruitiness and alcohol is in there as well. The taste is alcohol, spice and sweet caramel malt. The mouthfeel is quite viscous. This is a definite sipper."
"Taste is really mellow. Got some sweetness and malt with some some apricot and hops. The mouth feel is really creamy. There is a strong fruit and caramel aftertaste which is quite appealing. Overall an especially easy strong beer to drink."
"This is a tasty barleywine, not the most flavorful but good and goes down really easy. Good stuff, just not complex as I would like."
"Blithering Idiot is not the best barleywine I have ever had, but it's not the worst either. It's great as a digestif, but could use some time in the cellar to straighten out its complexities. I'll stick one in the cellar and re-review in a year or so."
"This one is a bit too intense to have more than one of in a sitting, and its not one of my top barelywines, but I'm happy to have tried it nonetheless."
"Pours a pretty dark burnt orange hue. Cream colored head was not substantial, but remained as a tightly packed veil. Lots of dark dried fruits in the aroma (figs, plums, and cherries.) There's also some apple. Some sweet booziness to it, but pretty faint. Not a lot of hops in the taste. The fruits really come through. Cherries, apples, plums. There's a bit of caramel and a slight bitter chocolate in the finish. Feels slick in your mouth and has a bit of viscosity. Goes down really easy for such a high ABV. I just didn't notice the alcohol that much. The alcohol taste that was present seemed to match well with the overall taste."
"Pours a hazy light amberish color. When held to the light, it looks a murky copper color. Keeps a nice little layer of head with some suds clinging to the sides of my snifter. Lots of complex aromas: rock candy, vanilla, banana, plum, caramel, raisins, fig. Oddly though, the hops don't seem to be evident. Really has a syrup-like complexion. Very sweet tasting. It's like dipping your tongue into a can of malt extract. Wish it had more hops to balance out the sweetness of the malt sugars. It has a rather thick, full tasting mouthfeel. This is one to sip for a nightcap. Not bad, but overall I wish they added more hop character."
"I knew I was in for a surprise when I saw the color. It is a reddish brown and comes the closest to a 22 on the SRM chart, but it has a little more red than the sample. The pour resulted an a two finger head that started small, then built and then settled to a wispy lace. Smells like fruit. I can smell cranberry, prune, date, raisin, apricot, and brown sugar. The taste throws me back! A sweet mixture of flavors all shouting to be in the front! Currant, date, and prune are in the forefront of the battle, with brown sugar, raisin, and fig trying to keep up. There is a washing of alcohol in the mixture that makes me take notice to the kick this brew is going to give me. Somewhat average feeling in my mouth, some tingle on my soft palate. I don't think I would like to drink more than one of these at a sitting, just too sweet for my liking...good flavor, but just too sweet. I think a few of these would give my a bad headache."
"D- Its boozy. Its great for dessert. It could use some age though. Ill give it a year and I expect it will be pretty awesome to pair with dessert."
"This a really nice big beer. I can't believe that this is the first time Weyerbacher won a GABF medal. Some of their beers are pretty impressive."
"Fairly drinkable, with 12 oz. just right. Needs some age and some character flaws hurt this one. A bit raw. I still dug this one. At 11%, it still goes down ok."
"Pours a thick reddish color with minimal head (It might have been the waitress, however). It smells very fruity, especially of figs and a bit of orange and grape. The taste is a bit off. It has a fruity, grape and orange like taste to it, and the carbonation overwhelms the palate. It is definitely a bit boozy, with the alcohol taste omnipresent through out the taste. A bit of hop bitterness comes out in the aftertaste. The carbonation really does sort of overwhelm the taste of the beer. All in all its not a terrible brew, but I came away a tad bit disappointed in this one."
"D-this is a strong boozy brew. 1 and done for me"
"a cherry amber color and the head fades into a collar rather quickly. nose is strong in cherry and light in alcohol. Taste follows with cherry, which it seems like i always get in an english barley wine but this one is less like cherry nyquil then others ive had which is nice, and alcohol that difused in toffee. Im diggin it all around it's enjoyable, but probally not going to setup for it in any trades."
"Drinkability: This one goes down fairly smooth, but the drinkability is severely hindered by the overwhelming taste of alcohol. The beer almost tastes and smells as if someone dropped a shot of alcohol into a barley wine."
"A bit hard to drink. The flavor isn't that interesting either."
"I miss having Weyerbacher readily available. This offering pours a mostly clear amber ruby topped by a short-lived finger or so of off-white foam. The nose comprises caramel, mandarin oranges (in syrup), and some fairly pronounced alcohol. The taste is very similar, though some toffee and biscuits sneak their way in as well without really subduing the oranges (but the alcohol seems diminished a touch). The body is a fairly hefty medium, with a light carbonation and a kinda syrupy feel. Overall, a solid b-wine, a bit on the boozy side, but not too bad at all."
"D: Goes down ok, good kick, ok representation of style, slightly boozy on this one even with a bit of age. I would opt for others of the style."
"12oz. bottle served in my Old Stock snifter. Pours a dull, semi-translucent plum with a loose, half inch, tan-colored head that quickly disperses towards the shoulders. Nose reveals dark fruit - raisins, prunes, and a slightly vinous quality, as well as a hint of alcohol in the mix. Taste consistent with nose, with the addition of pleasant malty backbone (toffee), as well as a light bittering at the finish. Mouthfeel is medium-light, with a carbonation that falls short of lively. There's also a slightly oily character to the mouthfeel. An easy drinking barleywine, perhaps a little closer in character to an American than an English, with a very well-hidden abv. A pleasant and accessible sipper."
"Notes: A bit short of magnificent but pretty pleasing."
"D - You don't really taste the alcohol content but its there. I would have maybe one or two but a few will get you toasty."
"something i saved from 2007. clearing out the cellar for the next cross country move. it definitely mellowed out,but still really good. looks like a barley wine snowglobe in my glass. lots of sweet malt flavor, caramel, juicy hops, happy i found it before i moved."
"D-seems quite straight forward and simple, flavors are burnt and rotten with no hop presence to balance. not a prefered choice."
"Note: Updating this after reading some other reviews. I just wanted to comment that I didn't taste any alcohol burn that others describe. I'm guessing I got a bottle with some age on it because it came from a shop without much traffic. This was probably the most mellow 11% beer I have ever had."
"Very drinkable for 11%. An enjoyable BW. Would drink again."
"Notes: My 2nd stab at barleywines and I gotta say I like them. I stand up after reviewing this and discover where the alcohol is."
"D - at 11.1% abv its not a beer you can easily drink a lot it literally is a punch in the face but it is awesome"
"D - 11.1%??? Wow! I cannot taste that much booze in this beer. Usually barleywine seems rather hot and boozy but this one is done nicely. A surprise favorite for me."
"D: I dislike the alcohol burn of this one, it does detract from its drinkability. A sipper, for sure. I don't think I would buy this one again."
"Pours a medium to dark red, with a finger of off white head. Smells like alcohol, prunes, raisins and molasses. Tastes like it smells, dark fruits, malty, some caramel and brown sugar, pretty good. Not as complex as I'd like to taste in a barleywine, but still pretty damn good, and I'm glad it was in a 12 oz bottle instead of a bomber! Good stuff!"
"D - one of those ""good"" beers, all around. nothing stands out, though everything is done well, makes it a good example of the style for newbies. my girlfriend loves this stuff, i dont mind."
"D: Excellent balance and very nice complexity make this an easy drinker."
"d 3.5 not an unpleasant sipper. a beverage to fall back on once you or i have lost most of our brain cells."
"Poured a dark red with a two finger tan head. Fruity aroma. Malty with brown sugar and figs. Slight alcohol finish which is more prominent as it warms. You just gotta love the name of this one. Overall another really great beer from the Weyerbacher Brewery."
"I don't hate this beer--but it definitely isn't something I'm crazy about. It's worth a try though."
"Bottle. Pours a clean reddish tan color with a nice head. Smells of dark fruits including raisin. Sweet smell of malts. Light to medium mouthfeel. The taste is similiar to the aromas in that you get dark fruits. Not as hoppy as I thought it would be for a BW. Not too bad."
"SkÅL!"
"Overall pretty nice. Perhaps a bit underwhelming but still a good beer."
"Taste is sweet and slightly fruity, kind of British feeling but alcohol is more powerful than any English Barleywine from across the pond I have had. Dark rum soaked raisins come to mind. Sticky and sweet, but not cloying. Carbonation is nice, definitely low and does not get in the way. ABV feels high, but not 11% high. Not bad...not great either and I dont think it would get any better with more age."
"D- This was a good brew, but had no hops which was really disappointing. I understand English Barleywines don't have as many hops as American BW, but there's got to be some bitter in there some where. The brew was good. It has some great flavors, but it was just a tad sweet without the hops."
"The pour is pretty standard for a barleywine, red to brown and cloudy in color with a white to tan head that diminished in a minute or two. The nose was pears and sweet malt. The first taste put the nail in the coffin for me though; red cherries and butterscotch rule this beer. And the sweet to syrupy full mouthfeel makes sure that the taste lingers eventually giving way to a small amount of fusals on the end. I could see someone enjoying this beer, but that person isn't me."
"Granted, I don't know a great deal about the barley wine style, but I'm very surprised that this isn't rated higher. I have a couple I'm aging as well, so it will be interesting to see how this beer changes."
"Overall, this beer is worth trying, but is just sorta average. I'll probably purchase it again in the future and age it a bit longer. It isn't bad by any means, just not exceptional."
"This is a sipper, a little on the sweet side for me."
"Taste is quite nice, it's very sweet and fruity but the mouthfeel is so thick and creamy that it's really very pleasant. Smooth and a bit syrupy, carbonation is light and sharp. Overall quite tasty and the alcohol isn't too in your face for the abv."
"Overall, not a bad English bwine, especially for the price. Slowing sipping this one. Drinkability is very similar to the other Weyerbacher beers I have had. Some what drinkable. Not very hoppy, but fits the style."
"very drinklable at such a high abv"
"Drinkability: Nice sipper when a malty shot of alcohol is desired. Speaking of alcohol, at 11.1%, it is remarkably well hidden, making this brew somewhat dangerous."
"D- Definitely a slow sipper. The chalice sat with me for about an hour and as it warmed the flavors became so much richer."
"D - Lacks a little complexity for my personal liking, but I think this falls within style parameters. The heavy sweetness and higher ABV make this a one and done, but sipping it is enjoyable."
"Pours from the 12 oz bottle a hazy, deep, dark copper color, with a minimal amount of off-white foam. Aromas are a little off-putting here, with dark fruit, fusel alcohol and sweet malt. On the palate, this one is extremely sweet, with hints of caramel, toffee and alcohol. Not bad, but not nearly as good as Insanity."
"D: Still a weird category for me. I really like this beer so I'd rate it high, but if you were brought up on super-hoppy beers this might take some getting used to."
"I think I might have gone into this with high hopes. I love Insanity a lot, but these two beers are totally different animals."
"D - While the 11.1% ABV can be detected both the nose and palette, it is still a highly drinkable offering... One of the better American produced English Barleywines due to the fact that it never becomes cloying... Anyone who welcomes this into their glass and enjoys it is far from a Blithering Idiot themselves..."
"pours a copper-amber color with a bit of head and some light lacing. lots of carbonation. the alcoholi thought was well hidden and made for a very tastey beer. a bit of a light wine taste followed by a slightly bitter finish. not anything to write home about, but still a pretty good beer."
"D: thickness and high alcohol make for more of a sipper yet is really easy to drink."
"D - very drinkable barleywine"
"D: I thought it was pretty good, but I enjoy Insanity more. The reversal of serving sizes confuses me, though. Shouldn't this be in a bomber and Insanity in a 12oz?"
"D: Not a bad English barleywine, and certainly drinkable."
"Pours a reddish brown with amber edges, thin white head with spotty lace. Smell: caramel, plum, artificial-ish cherry, slight booze. Taste: lots of caramel, red grape skin, cherry-coke-ish flavor, a little heat. Ehh, seems like a misstep for the Weyerbachers."
"D: One of the better English barleywines I've had, although I haven't had many. Would love this after dinner, but this one's a little hot to have multiples."
"(D)- A rather bizarre barleywine for the style that is almost devoid of maltiness, but replaced by a big sour fruitiness. Bitter too, but not in a normal/good way."
"Decent brew but a big alcohol bomb. I like it."
"1/4 finger white head quick dissipation minimal if any lacing. Dark amber body medium thin layer of head retained on top. Nose is of alcohol and little else, some floral hops shoved into background. Taste is equally boozy, some hops in finish. Mouthfeel is fairly flat, not well carbonated, a bit sticky. Too boozy to have a whole bottle. My least favorite beer of the tasting."
"D- a cooler weather brew (doesn't have to be winter)- but heavy to have more than one or two."
"I dont really recommend this one, I have had better from this brewery."
" ~ This is a great beer! It has all qualities I find appealing in a barleywine. I can also see why they call it Blithering Idiot. I'm sitting here after having a quarter glass and my mind is reeling. What a great 'head'!"
"Complex taste, sweet with a malty backbone. It has a lot of alcohol and the taste doesn't due much to mask the high ABV. Not a bad beer, but not sure if I would pick it up again as long as there is Bigfoot on the shelves."
"Overall: It's a good beer, but nothing more. A decently made barley wine...'nuff said. I'd recommend it for those fearing their first barley wine, nothing too extreme going on here. At least it has a high alcohol content. If you like English brown ales though - I would recommend it. Might tickle your fancy."
"D- Again, a classic example of a good, English Barleywine that hides the high ABV very well."
"d - Wasn't the biggest fan of this barleywine. Decent dark fruit smell and taste, but it was overpowered by a lot of booze. This one might be a little better served cellaring for a bit. Have one bottle left I'll be holding onto for a bit."
"The body and drinkability were also average for the style, good but not great, and certainly not terrible. Overall, an average Barleywine, give it a shot if you see it."
"Overall, i enjoyed this beer. Its very complex and a great sipping beer. I had it with a slice of apple cake and it was quite enjoyable. I will probably pick up another bottle of this again."
"When you think 11% alcohal you think fusal, solvent type flavors dominating a sub-par Barley Wine. However, that is not the case with B.I. Granted that first sip punches you in the throat and kicks you in the stomach but it gets much better from there. Hops are minimal at best but not really expected. HUGE malt flavors and aromas carry you through to a slightly dry finish but it is NOT overly dry. There is a nice balance between the sweetness and the alcohol. Not bad at all, give this one a shot."
"D - A better drinking barleywine than most, it's mellow across the board. I wonder if this is aged cause it seems like it. This barleywine crosses the border from sipper into decently drinkable."
"Morey's Bottom Line: This is a winter beer that you want to bust out when the flakes are falling from the sky. If you're in the mood for a high alcohol beer, Blithering Idiot won't disappoint."
"Overall, I'd have to say that the alcohol plays a little too much of a role in the flavor profile: it dominates both the smell and the taste. That's not to say this beer completely misses it's mark - the dark fruit undertones are there, but they are just overshadowed. If the alcohol presence was subordinated just a little bit, this beer would be great. But for now it's just ok. Bottom line: I'd drink it if you gave it to me, but wouldn't order one intentionally."
"D: However that same too-thin feeling makes it exceedingly drinkable and easy going."
"Nice medium body, a bit viscous. Comes on strong and overwhelming at first but again it seems to mellow out as the beer sits and warms a little. While quite a complex beer, the various elements seem to be a bit jumbled up at this point."
"I'm a barleywine fan, and while this one isn't a bad one, there are others that are far superior."
"Drinkability/Overall - Awful, just, awful"
"drinkability: an ok beer, just lacked power."
"Based on the facts that I'm not much of a barleywine drinker, and I haven't been impressed with some of the Weyerbacher selections I've tried in the past, I didn't have high hopes for this one. I was pleasantly surprised, though, and thoroughly enjoyed the Idiot, although I have a feeling that I would score it a bit lower if had not let it mellow for so many months."
"Cellar time would almost certainly do wonders for this one, but curiosity got the best of me. A seductive sipper, that is pretty smooth despite the booze. I can only imagine what a couple of years would do to this??? I may have to ship some home for the cellar. Quite complex and tasty, it is a solid example of the style."
"3.5/4/4/3.5/4"
"Poured from 12 oz. bottle into pint glass. Deep amber with a thick white head, good retention. Some hop notes an alcohol in the nose. A bit of raspberry flavor, lots of alcohol. Medium body with decent amount of carbonation. Not my favorite in this style, but not bad."
"Pours a cloudy dark amber with a very small head that disappeared very quickly to just a thin ring. Minimal spotty lacing is left on the glass. Average looking at best. Things pick up in the aroma department. This barleywine showcases the malt which is a bit rare since most are hop bombs. Hints of brandy and figs with the 11% ABV very much making its status known. The flavor is pleasant as well despite the strong boozy component. Hints of the dark fruit makes this enjoyable. The hops do not make any contribution that I could detect. Full bodied with smooth carbonantion. Not the easiest drinking beer with its big ABV but the alcohol does not overpower or makes things unpleasant."
"Drinkability is pretty low in my opinion. The solvent-like alcohol really detracts from the beer and makes it one-dimensional. Could not finish the whole bottle, just not worthy in my opinion."
"Overall impression: Not too interesting, but a good example of an American barley wine. Greatly enjoyed in the low 50s F."
"D: Higher in ABV and you know it when you drink it. I don't suggest it."
"All in all, this is not a great brew. It's ok to try once, but not one to return to. My suggestion is to try an Olde School or something of higher taste value if you're trying to get into barleywines."
"Overall impression: Can't recommend this one."
"Pours to a cloudy brown, one-finger head that didn't disappear until the end of the glass.alcoholic smell with what seems like cherry or raspberry notes, with a bit of nutmeg. Taste is like a dry wine but pleasant with fruity notes. Mouthfeel is heavy and coating. No real aftertaste. A slightly bitter finish, but not bad."
"This brew poured out dark reddish, cloudy with a decent size head that retained until the middle of my glass. I noticed strong brown sugar aromas up front with a huge wave of alcohol and following behind were hints of raisins, plums and nutmeg. Upon first taste, I figured out why this beer was called the ""Blithering Idiot."" Alcohol seemed to mask pretty much all of the characteristics of this brew, though I did notice the fermented brown sugar tastes with what seemed to be a strong malty backbone and a fierce, spicy finish. Even with the high ABV, this beer went down somewhat smooth and was a definite enjoyment overall."
"D- Very drinkable due to the light mouthfeel and subdued hop profile. Be careful as this one is quite enjoyable, but could probably lead to a crappy morning the next day. Overall, not exactly what I think of when the style is mentioned, but is pleasant and worth checking out if one has the chance."
"Mouthfeel is rich, would be even richer without the alcohol presence. Drinkability is pretty good. Two of these would be plenty. Probably a candidate for aging. Still pretty good fresh."
"Overall definately a great beer that definately defines the english barleywine style but doesn't seem to actually DEFINE the style but definately deserves respect. For the price, alcohol content, and availablility (being about an hour and a half from the brewery) i would definately buy it again to enjoy a beer at the end of the day"
"M/D - Medium bodied and rather sticky. Alcohol burn is a little too strong."
"A very nice interpretation of the Barleywine. Very easy on the palate, not at all chewy like most of the category. At 11% ABV the beer is deceivingly light to the taste. Very full-bodied and complex but exceptionally smooth tasting at the same time. Holds a very nice head when poured."
"D: This beer is more drinkable now then it was fresh, but still a bit to alcoholic to be very drinkable."
"D- i liked this one alot. the time in the cellar did it some good comparing my notes to other reviews on here. the strength makes it a one and done type beer, but its something id like to be able to have on a regular basis. too bad weyerbacher doesnt ship to chicago."
"This goes down smooth and fast. A big beer that drinks like a session."
"D: Nice, but the alcohol really hits about mid-way through the bottle."
"The flavors are very much rounded out on the back end, to the point where it is difficult to tell what kind of flavors there are, as they do not carry through to the end, despite the nice mouthfeel and great drinkability of this beer. Alcohol, however, does come through at the end after a few sips. Let it warm up and it comes through even more."
"overall a let down..."
"To find out, Insanity is Blithering Idiot aged in oak barrels that had previously held bourbon. Amazing what this process can do to a beer as Insanity is perhaps my new favorite barleywine."
"This is way to boozy to be anything other than a sipper. I like the smell and flavor but the alcohol is too distracting."
"Pours a nice rum-raisin color with little or no head, minimal lacing. Smell is good with some raisin, alcohol, lightly toasted malt, molasses, and figs coming through. Taste definitely follows the nose--this is a pretty good EB in my opinion. Big, robust flavors of molasses, rum-raisin, figs, some light malt... tasty for sure. A bit sweet, though. A bit sticky on the MF, and drinkability is pretty high. Even with it being a little hot, this one goes down smooth. A good sipper."
"Beer pours a deep copper/raisin color with light lacing around the glass, no head or carbonation. Smells of dates, intense malts, maybe a little spice. The taste is warm, sweet malt, fruit, and has a boozy aromatic warmness as it goes down. Has a medium/heavy body and is best enjoyed while sipped in a snifter. I just discovered this beer this past year and have grown to really enjoy this one. Hurray that it's brewed all year around. Good job, Weyerbacher!"
"Viscous body with some lush toffee/caramel flavors, spicy rum, and dried fruit. Oxidized and bready like some Euro beers. Alcohol seems somewhat tamed yet still perceptible. Rich and sticky. Low carbonation, full bodied. A nice late evening sipper. Thanks Mark!"
"Poured a cloudy, medium brown with a skimpy head that quickly settled to a collar. The aroma was just plain sweet and boozy for me. The taste was thick, sweet, cloying and a big alcohol presence. I was getting a sour taste from somewhere, maybe cherries? Not sure. The feel was heavy bodied with little carbonation. Drinkability was reasonable for a high ABV, I could probably have had another 12 oz. The odd sour taste kept it from being one of the top of it's style. I enjoyed Idiot, but am a fan of barleywines, so take it for what it's worth."
"The barley beer is a reall good one. Hats off to Weyerbacher."
"Pours a cloudy, copper color with lighter orange along the bottom of the glass. 1/4 inch head of a pale tan color. Slight retention and poor lacing. Smells of alcohol, sweet malt, and slight caramel. Fits the style of an English Barleywine. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. The alcohol does not dominate and the hops are relatively low. Tastes of sweet malt up front, then alcohol, sweetness (toffee) and slight hop. A much more balanced barleywine than others I've tried, though not as complex."
"Poured copper brown, with a finger of tan head, which didn't last very long, but did lace well. The smell was a sweet, sweet mix of rhubarb, tart cherry, blood orange, caramel, woodiness, and raisins...not a bad mix, but overridingly sweet. The flavor was annoyingly sweet and harsh, begging the question as to whether or not this beer would better with age. The mouthfeel was thick and syrupy; a struggle to get down the throat. As such, I had trouble finishing one of these."
"D- It's a good beer but the ABV will set the limits for you"
"12oz bottle via trade with crizay of RB fame. This is one of those nights I was feeling like a blithering idiot. Pours a clear copper with inch high bubbly tan head. The aroma is a bit light and doesn't really hide the big ABV. I get plums, raisins, a hint of hay, pale malts (oddly enough) and some alcohol. The flavor starts with cherries, raisins, dates and plum fruitiness. This was followed by lightly roasted to pale malts. Throughout the experience there's an under tone of alcohol and hotness. Into the aftertaste each of the flavor components lingers for a good while with sweet dark fruitiness cut with alcohol and pale maltiness. Maybe this could use a couple more years to mellow."
"This really is a chore to drink, and I'm not going to bother."
"Review from notes taken on: 9/9/09"
"Poured a deep, cloudy orange color, with a small white head, good carbonation, some bubbles and sediment. Nose bubble gum, fruits, candy. Taste is candied and dried fruit, bubble gum, brown sugar, maple and very sweet. Nice alcohol bite and warming. Mouthfeel is sticky and sweet. Phenom!!!"
"Overall I thought this was a solid beer that hit all the right flavors but they weren't quite large enough to be great. Worth a shot."
"Overall, an average barleywine. This was my last beer of the night, and it was a long night, so I lived up to the name and was a real life blithering idiot after this."
"drinkability is good. this is a nicely composed barleywine with a drinkable character and well masked alcohol. cheers!"
"D: A decent beer, but out of balance and not one of Weyerbacher's finer offerings. Of course, barleywines are supposed to be high in alcohol, but this one is really showcasing it. I guess the word ""rough"" could be used to describe this one. I imagine a little age could help it out, but I don't think age is going to resolve all of this beers problems."
"Seriously underwhelmed by this barleywine. It was sweet and alcoholic, but so is a Harvey Wallbanger. Heavy malts and a lot of stickiness undifferentiated by distinctive flavoring or mouthfeel. Fragrance -- mere sweetness, nothing that stands out. Not something I'd bother with again."
"D - Alcohol is high at 11.1%. Feels harsh hot/cold going down. Think this could probably use a little more aging. Flavors and alcohol are a little much for me, even in a barleywine. Has potential, but think it needs to mellow a little with some age."
"12 ounce bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours an amber/copper color with about an inch tan head. Head retention is excellent, lacing is good. Aroma is fruity and malty, it smells like brandy, cherries, plums, raisins, brown sugar and bready malt. Taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes like brown sugar, raisins, bready malt and caramel. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's rich and a bit syrupy and coating with average carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's very smooth and easy to drink but it's also a sipper because of the high alcohol. If you like English Barleywines, then you would probably like this brew. I thought it was good."
"From a brown 12 oz. bottle. Pours a brownish/red color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, slightly sweet. Taste is mostly of alcohol, some maltiness , and finishes sour. Feels creamy in the mouth. Definatly not a beer I could spend the evening drinking. Overall not really to my liking."
"The mouth feel is a bit heavy at first but lightens up a bit after the first contact of the flavor hits the tongue. Goes down well especially on a hot day like this when I tried it. Anything would go down well tonight."
"M/D - Creamy with a slight bite from the alcohol. An enjoyable sweetness in your mouth with a great taste that lingers. I haven't drank too many barleywines but this seems to be a fine example."
"Light tan brown head, mixture of bubble sizes, the razor thin lacing holds on admirably before sliding down into the liquid below. Muddy brown orange in hue, pretty damn murky although the orange tones brighten the rims and bottom of the glass. Fruity nose of raisin bread, plum, cherry, black grapes and banana, however, doesn't come across as über-sweet, no lack of malts, mocha, brown sugar, toffee and the usuals, something close to pine resin there, relaxed hops and even the barley content to stay par of the chorus. Full-bodied, more sluggish than heavy, releases up off the tongue decently. The alcoholic booziness more apparent here, slight burn to it. Again, not as overtly sweet as many others, smoky brown sugar and caramel, mocha powder, light charred edge. More fresher cherry, plum, grape, apple than raisin, prune or date. Slightly elevated hoppiness here, particularly near the finish. Carbonation could have more verve. Gets a little smoother as it warms, curious this be."
"D: Not so good. It took me about an hour and a half to drink a 12 oz bottle. I've had bombers of beer approaching this ABV that I finished more quickly."
"Aroma is not strong but is pleasantly malty with hints of apple brandy and caramel. It pours a clear, dark mahogany with a thin and not too persistent head. Flavor is somewhat malty with touches of caramel and cloves and a strong but not overwhelming brandy-like bite. Texture is smooth, a little edgy and hardly fizzy."
"Future outlook: Mediocre. Other barleywines out there that I prefer over this one....not much reason to revisit."
"D: If you like highly alcoholic malt bombs, you should probably stock up. Otherwise, you might want to split the bottle with someone. I wonder how this would age. Would it round out and become more complex or would it become even more sickeningly sweet? I suspect the latter."
"Pours a murky, reddish orange with a khaki-colored head. Aroma consists of caramel, fruit and a touch of cherry. The mouthfeel is thick - smooth and full-bodied. Taste is pretty straight forward for a barleywine. There's a blend of malt and hop bitterness throughout. This is a sipper that unfolds nicely at room temperature. Great beer to have by your side on a cold winter night."
"Weyerbacher Blithering Idiot is a cloudy, deep amber ale with a small, dense, khaki head that has good retention and lacing. It has a slightly sweet, malty aroma with notes of spicy green hops, juniper and black pepper. It is full bodied, creamy and very smooth; almost flat with a slightly gritty finish. It's pretty well balanced. The malt is a little sweet and the hops taste very green. It's very drinkable, even at 11.1% ABV."
"Very dark reddish amber color. I can tell before I even take a sip that this will be uber-malty. Very sweet smelling with some fruity tones. At first sip this is definitely malty malty malty. Probably the sweetest barleywine you will ever drink. High ABV is definitely apparent. This isn't one you want to drink more than one of."
"i won't be buying this again."
"Mouthfeel is medium heavy bodied and smooth with a small amount of carbonation."
"D- The 11% ABV is way to present.. the smell and taste just isn't here."
"Dr. Very nice after dinner with a chocolate truffle. I think it's a ""one only"" beer."
"Served on tap at Novare Res into my Uprising Chalice. Had a great dark amber color and lots of head as it was handed to me. After a few minutes, the head reduced to a few centimeters in height. The taste was slightly sweet with a strong (but not bad) alcohol aftertaste. There was an average amount of carbonation. Definitely a strong beer, worth having at least one pour of if it's available to you."
"D Not real good since it is such a big beer. This apertif plays its role real nice though. One and done."
"Drinkability: This is more drinkable than I remember from the last one I had. It goes down easily and I am enjoying it."
"Pours cloudy orange-brown with little head retention at all. A bit of fruit and nutmeg on the nose. Taste is over the top. Big alcohol, big sweet malts, big yeast...did I mention big alcohol? Good sippin' brew. Layers of flavor...cloves, caramel, maple syrup, butter, waffles (just kidding). No smoke; little hops to speak of. Syrupy heavy mouthfeel. Although I tend to love more intense beers like this, Blithering Idiot is almost too much."
"Very heavy with the alcohol coming through a bit too much for my taste. I didn't really enjoy drinking this beer, and it felt almost like a chore as a result."
"12 oz. Orange/amber pour with a light beige head. Slightly boozy aroma with malt, caramel, raisin and a hint of citrusy hops. Malty caramel/toffee layers with some red fruits, citrus hint of pine and booze. Sticky medium body, maybe just a hint watery. Pretty warm, drinkability is just slightly better than ok. Definetely a malt inclined barleywine, which I like. One of the better I've had from Weyerbacher."
"Pours a orange brown color with a slight head. The smell is sweet without the smell of alcohol to it. The taste is excellent. It doesn't have an overly alcohol taste like some other barely wines. The taste is slightly sweet. There is a good mouthfeel, with very little carbonation. The drinkability is great. It is very smooth."
"I am very surprised at how this one turned out. I remeber this tasting and was kind of displeased but after a little while of cellaring this turned out to be superb.The look is the same and the aroma is a bit toned down of that ripe darkened fruit aroma. But the taste has totally changed.There is no more heavy hot boozey kick which totally throws you for a loop it has mellowed out and all of the flavors have bind together and work in perfect harmony.Still a bit heavy and syrupy on the palate but a bit easier drinking this one. Now I will wait another few months on the two year anniversary to taste this again."
"Amber colored beer with a slowly fading head.Aroma reminds me of cherry lifesavers I used to eat as a kid.Taste is black chery,caramel,sugar cane with a little alcohol.Overall pretty smooth and enjoyable,I think this should be tried at least once,as for me I would purchase again!!"
"Pours a nice orangish color that produces a nice full head that retains well and leaves a nice lacing. The nose is interesting, being sweet and slightly fruity, no hops due to the style. The flavor profile is less malty than the nose suggested, but still delicious. Malts, toffee, molasses, and dark fruit comprise the flavor, along with a few other notes."
"Overall, not bad. Very drinkable for 11.1, and the alcohol is masked pretty well. I like a little more toffee and breadiness to my Bwines though."
"D- A solid but not exceptional offering. I like this beer but think it would probably a 1 or 2 then done due to +11% ABV."
"This feels like the English equivalent of a classic German beer, if that makes any sense. Like the Weihenstephan of British Barleywines. A no-nonsense, not crazy experimental, well balanced beer."
"Drinkability- Obvious marks off drinkability for the high ABV, but the sweet and sticky taste and texture make me want to go back for a few more. God knows I'd be out of commission before long."
"can't help but love Weyerbacher"
"Weyerbacher does it again!"
"D- Good to drink."
"I enjoyed this beer - a good example of the style. The style is one though that is hard to reach for repeatedly."
"The body is more on the fuller side with some sugary aftertaste. Carbonation is a bit high (and really high for style). Noticeable warming form the alcohol and a bit of a bite from the heat. Overall this is a bit of a disappointment for English style Barleywines. Would like more distinct English malt and hop flavors. Some minor yeast issues and noticeable alcohol really leave this one a bit on the short end."
""
"3.0 D: I haven't had a barleywine that was very drinkable. It's just the way they are."
"Drinkability: You can taste the alcohol here, which makes it about average for a barleywine."
"Overall its fairly easy to drink. The alcohol level is def. there. But its nice if you enjoy a sweet beer now and then. It seems to be one of those barleywines which makes you wonder how all barleywines are one category, considering the amount of variation that one finds in the style.."
"I definitely prefer English Barleywines over their American counterparts. While this was obviously no J.W. Lees, it was some damn good stuff."
"Drinkability- A tasty beer that enjoy and will look for once in a while again, very high alcohol which for the most part is pretty well hidden, but not one that you should be polishing a pack off of in a nite, a good nite cap and beer to end your evening"
"Pours a ruby brown with an off white head and not much lacing. Smells sweet malt, nutty, with a fuitty hints. Tastes like everything in the book: fruitty start with a nice citrus hoppiness to it, figs, raisins, rich velvety smooth finish. Very nice well rounded brew, very drinkable for barleywine. Nicely done, not the greatest bw, but a solid offering that's for sure."
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a snifter. It pours a hazy amber with minimal head. The aroma is full of dark fruits soaked in rum. The taste follows the nose, but the alcohol is more prominent. The finish liners a bit and is of sweet alcohol. The beer is creamy, medium bodied and light carbonation. The beer is a slow sipper, because if you drink it too fast, its 11% abv will make you a blithering idiot."
"Drink ability is good, for 11 percent abv the alcohol isnt too apparent. Could drink acouple of these at a time but then i'd have to lie down after that."
"Out of a bottle this promising offering was a cloudy amber color with lots of sediment. The one-finger head of tan bubbles displayed moderate retention as a skim and decent lacing. The aroma was big and very sweet, pineapple, peaches and spices all atop pungent alcohol. The flavors were luckily not as sweet as the aroma. I still got the caramel, tropical fruits and brown sugar out of it that one would expect but along with that I got oak, vanilla and some alcohol bite similar to a cognac that helped it be less-than-cloying. The heat was well-concealed but as it warmed I began to taste the punch. In many ways it was what one would expect from a barleywine but it did lack hops presence and needed finesse. Still, for a compact uppercut, it had the biceps and delivery."
"Tasty but drinkability suffers from very assertive alcohol."
"D - ehh...it was an alright beer. It just had wayyy too much alcohol in it."
"d: while overall I thought it was a good barley wine, the alcohol content was a little much. I would recommend having two a the most in one sitting, unless you are looking to get lit up big time."
"Drinkability: Due to the high alcohol content, you probably only want one in a sitting. To me this is a slightly above average barleywine. I will probably pick up another single at some point--not a full pack"
"Dark coppery color with a creamy compact tan head. Aroma is sweet and very English, with rummy dark fruits and lots of caramel. Flavor has some overripe apple to go along with the raisin/fig. Very sweet but there's enough variety in the ester notes to keep me interested. Thick mouthfeel, not overly alcoholic."
"Overall a decent barleywine, I'm not sure I would pick this up over Anchor or Sierra Nevada but still a nice beer."
"Not bad at all but could be better. It's possible that another couple years of age would smooth this out, but I'm tempted to suggest that Weyerbacher drop the ABV by a couple points."
"Pours a hazy burnt orange with a thick, foamy head that seems will stick around for a bit. Nose is piney with a hint of citrus and brown sugar. Some tobacco there too. Taste is immediately hot with alcohol that burns the back of the throat when it goes down. finish is all brown sugar, a bit cloying. some notes of dark fruits in the front and then a hoppy bitterness comes and try to balance the sweetness. This one seems like it be great in the glass after a couple of years, but fresh seems to be a bit hot. Mouthfeel is a bit syrupy and chewy, but with plenty of carbonation."
"A decent barleywine for the money. Definitely opens up as it warms. Started drinking this around 55 degrees and finished it around 65. Much better at the warmer temp."
"HV"
"Drinkability - Very good now, probably better in two years or so."
"A delicious, well rounded and fortifying beer. Like drinking a banana split with lots of caramel."
"unbelievably smooth and refined, with an aged taste. Great sticky caramel taste feel all the way through. Light fruit accents, in addition to some darker grapes that add some sweetness. Honey. Very clean taste, but a little hot on the end."
"Pours an ugly, cloudy, dull orange/brown. Smells fruity with alcohol notes present in the nose with no hop aroma whatsoever. First sip is sweet fruits, pears and plums, that quickly morphs into a heavy bitterness. Surprisingly light bodied considering the high ABV. Good and easy to drink just not great."
"Overall-an ok barleywine, flavor is take it or leave it but it fulfills its purpose, an ok sipper."
"This offering is a sipper and pretty bold. A bit unbalanced though it's interesting enough to enjoy. On the pricey side of things and I think I am going to age one to see if it rights the ship."
"Overall: Sad part is someone suggested this. Nice to try, but wouldnt buy again as it is a poor ambassador for a barleywine."
"D-The alcohol overpowers all, could think of a lot of beers around the same abv where there is no alcohol to be sensed. This beer has promise, it just needs to store for a few years. Friend of mine shared a bottle with me and he could not finish his half so it ended up down the drain. I pushed through and it is fair to say this isn't a repeat selection."
"Overall: I'm sure this barley wine would age well, but I don't cellar beer so it's lost on me. As it is, alcohol is too pervasive and overwhelming, killing what might otherwise be a very good brew. Worth a try."
"It's heaviness and heavy sweetness make this a great occasional choice with a cigar or as a nightcap, but also preclude it from a spot in a more regular rotation. Similarly, the price (at least here in WI) doesn't help, at roughly $15 per 4-pack. I'm glad to have it as an option, but I don't foresee buying it very often."
"Great drinkability....for anything weighing in at 11%. About as drinkable as your average barleywine."
"Picked this up over in Wiscoland, I wasn't sure if this was an American style or English style barleywine. It definitely goes to the English side as I didn't get much for hop flavor. But it was quite tasty and worth a try."
"D: A great winter warmer sipper, but very big alcohol burn going down that makes its presence known may limit its drinkability."
"A very nice barley wine, but nothing that I will remember forever or buy again."
" Drinkability improved as the beer warmed and the alcohol took effect."
"Drinkability: A hot, hot, hot beer, with lots of alcohol that's not well-hidden. That being said, a lot of what's here is good, and if it could be allowed to come through, it'd probably be pretty enjoyable. Give it a shot, but let this one age a year ... or a decade. Or something."
"I just didn't find this particularly enjoyable to drink, went down harshly, and the flavors seemed out of balance, with the sweetness dominating the whole brew over the hops and malt. Found it hard getting this one down."
"D: While I love barleywines and think this one is fine as is - I'm definitely going to lay a few bottles down for a couple of years."
"Tastes far mellower than I would have anticipated given what I've heard. Sweet malt comes through foremost with a mild sourness, like the aforementioned grapefruit. Little hop profile to speak of, alcohol doesn't really come through until the finish, where it lingers in the throat thereafter. Big alcohol taste there, but it really doesn't stop me from drinking more. Mouthfeel is syrupy and coating. I don't really think I could have more than one of these per night, but I'd be damned if I didn't try. If anything, it would be the sticky and cloying mouthfeel rather than the big booze presence preventing me from doing so, which is surprising to me."
"For being 11.1% ABV, this one goes down really well. I was lucky enough to get this as an extra in a trade a few months ago (can't remember from whom), but I'm really enjoying this one tonight. We get Weyerbacher here in Cincinnati but I rarely see the Blithering Idiot out - I'll certainly keep my eyes open, as this is one of the more sessionable (if that is even possible for this style) barleywines I've ever had, and I look forward to enjoying this one again in the future."
"Pours a cloudy brown with a creamy tan head. Aroma sweet fruit, plum and raisin, malty and some caramel. Flavor is sweet, dark fruit and some cherry. Finishes long and smoewhat sweet with some alcohol warming. A very powerful beer that will no doubt age well."
"D - Easy to drink and mostly enjoyable to drink. Nice and malty which is hard to find."
"D - Drinkable would be stretching it a bit for a beer this big and thick, but it is pretty enjoyable. The malt complexity is excellent, and the beer is very smooth for something so strong, but I don't know if it quite manages to justify its extraordinary price."
"Overall this is a very nice beer and another winner from Wayerbacher. Just don't drink more than two -- even that many may be a little too much."
"The 11% is not that noticeable, until you stand up!"
"Almost clear deep golden orange body. Thick finger of dense, whipped, light khaki head. Good lacing. Nose of rich toffee, caramel, and tropical fruits. A little booze, vanilla, and slight herbal touch as well. Taste starts toasted malts and a flash of herbal bitterness. Big sweet (almost cloying) malt wave follows. Toffee and caramel mix with boozy fruits and marshmallows. Alcohol is noticeable near the finish, and has a slight rocket fuel flavor. Yep, fusels methinks. Alcohol and herbal hops in the finish provide some counterpoint to the big time maltiness of this beer. Full-bodied with a sticky feel. A little too warming for me--glad it's not a bomber!"
"Fantastic looking Barleywine. Rich amber color with a creamy tan head. The nose has some sweet fruits, candy, light hops and young alcohols. The taste isquiet sweet and fruity with again just a tad of hops. Young for sure, but still damn good. The mouthfeel is a bit thick. Definately a sipper."
"Despite being a little hot, it is very smooth which makes it pretty drinkable for a 11.1% abv."
"Eric"
"Whoa, this is a big strong, beer for sure. The first I've had from this brewery and I found it to be an above average barleywine. It's no Bigfoot or Old Horizontal for sure, but it's pretty damn good. Does have a little too much of an alcohol flavor and not enough of a ""beer"" taste to balance it out for me. This affects the drinkability but overall its a good beer and worth a try."
"I dont think I would buy this beer again but I did have the BA aged version and I liked it alot more.Sorry Weyerbacher I wanted to like it."
"I really enjoyed this beer, and would recommend it highly. I bought this 4-pack from Discount Liquor shortly after it came into the state of WI."
"I'm still learning the style, and so far liked the Old Ruffian better than this, but will definitely try this one again."
"So far I am very impressed with Weyerbacher, look forward to many more."
"Enjoy carefully."
"Not a beer i would care to drink several of, but an excellent nightcap. one of my favorite beers for sure."
"Clear amber color with a off-white head that settles down to small patches and a thin ring around the glass. Aroma is caramel, woody with some alcohol surfacing. Much of the same in the flavor with the addition of sweet malts, toffee and some spiciness. Some alcohol shows towards the finish, although not as alcoholic as I was expecting. A solid barleywine."
"D - This would be a beautiful beer if not for the nearly intolerable alcohol presence. The strength and prevalance of the alcohol make this one tough to stomach."
"Blithering Idiot pours a brownish orange with a thin off white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is sweet with some fruit. The flavor is also fruity, sugar - either brown or candy seems quite strong. Alcohol is lurking in the background. This beer was very carbonated and I kept thinking to myself when I was drinking this that it tastes like a mediocre Belgian beer, the problem being it's supposed to be a barleywine. Not bad, not great, it's probably worth a try."
"Wow, I'm sure glad I finally decided to try this offering. Poured into Brandy snifters, left no distinguisable head. Beautiful burnt orange color. My brother and I drank the whole six-pack in one sitting! The smell is of brown sugar,dates, and caramel. The mouth feel,devine. The taste is ambrosia. I have found that all the barleywines I have had the pleasure of tasting lately, I have been very satisfied with all my selections. Don't you be a ""Blithering Idiot", give this gem a try!"
"overall, wow i really like this, the malty flavor really sticks out and is not discuised by a hop bomb like other barleywines"
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Pours a deep, amber brownish color with a quarter-inch head. No lacing on the glass. Smells like dried fruit and brown sugar. Taste is interesting. Starts off with brown sugar, figs, dried fruit, and becomes a sort of musty taste for lack of a better word. Alot of alcohol in the taste. Overall, not a bad barleywine. It's not my favorite, but it's certainly not a bad example of one."
"Well, it's been a few months since I've posted a review and figured its time to get off my ass and put down a few meaningful words, hopefully the end result being that someone will take my advice. I am very familiar with Blithering Idiot and was surprised to see that I hadn't yet reviewed it. I poured a 12 oz. bottle straight from the fridge into my tasting snifter. Right off I can tell I should have let it set on the counter to warm a bit, a cold beer will never release the aroma you're looking for when first poured. The color is almost a dark, rusty orange; it kind of reminds me of a glass of apple cider. The small opaque head disappears almost as soon as the entire beer is poured. The aroma is a reminiscent or other Barleywine I've had in the past. It's got a heavy does of hops and fruit, along with a little citrus. The taste is awesome...not too hot and not overly boozy. There is a pleasant after taste, but it is dismissed largely due to the cigarette that I'm enjoying as well. Overall this is a great beer from a brewery in my home state of Pennsylvania...one of these days I'm going to have to take the long haul out to the Weyerbacher Brewery in Easton and get a fresh growler full. Cheers!"
"Drinkability is good. This is an easy drinking barleywine that is tasty enough to be worth drinking again. I wouldn't make a huge effort to track it down, but I'd be pleased to have a bottle of this again some time."
"D. As drinkable as 11.1% beer can be. I'm at home and I'm not going anywhere. Its obviously a big beer, and this big guy likes it."
"Overall this is a tasty beer. I prefer the super hoppy American barleywines, but this is a very nice beer."
"I was expecting cider sweet with overpowering alcohol, what I got was sooo much more. This poured a nice amber color typical of an ale with a thin head up front which soon dissipated as should be expected. The aroma was bursting almost like a well placed bouquet. The flavor is what floored me, for as strong as this is there was no doubt that first and foremost this is an ale. Wonderful flavor and the very strong alcohol doesn't make it's presence known until you have swallowed. This reminds me of drinking scotch, not in the taste but in the effect. Well done Weyerbacher, I only hope my favorite store continues to stock your product."
"Drinkability: A predominately sweet, malty barleywine that I enjoyed fairly well. I have a few older bottles lurking the cellar that I'll be sure to check on."
"The apricot colored body of this beer was slightly hazy, and was topped with a very small head. The smell was fruity and bready with a nice layering, revealing nuances depending on how deeply the vapor was inhaled. The taste was quite sweet with figs and cherries coming to mind immediately. The amount of sugar here was quite high, and would have been cloying but for the mouth drying effects of the otherwise well hidden alcohol. Richly drizzled mouthfeel was the highlight of the session. Unashamedly English in its approach, and should cellar very well."
"Prosit , MK"
"Nice caramel color and flavor with white lacing. Worth trying but I'll only have 1 this evening."
"Bless Weyerbacher. One of my favorite breweries."
"Easy to drink despite the high abv. Overall this is a sweet beer with big alchohol."
"12oz bottle poured into a snifter. Pours a dark reddish amber with a nice off-white head. The aroma is malt with dark fruits, spice and alcohol. The taste starts out sweet and malty with dark fruits and a long warming finish from the high ABV. As sweet as this beer is from all the malt, I feel that it could use some more hops to help balance things out. I find that the high ABV and the cloying taste limits the drinkability quite a bit. Worth a shot, but I am not a huge fan of Blithering Idiot and would not likely purchase again. This one definitely needs a couple years of aging to mellow out a bit."
"D- This one will kick your ass if you try to drink 3. This is just a sipping beer and not to be guzzled, but meant to be enjoyed."
"D: at 11% one is my limit on this one, but a very nice barleywine."
"D: This is a sipper, and not something I want a lot of in one night. But I'd buy it again and share."
"This one was smooth going down and easy drinking, but, at 11% ABV, too strong for an immediate second. Definitely worth returning to another time."
"Overall impression: Nicely done. This reminds me of a ""poor man's Thomas Hardy"". Lovely balance of malt and alcohol. It's dangerously hidden. This would make for a great reduction sauce to put over some free-range duck. Probably not the best choice for a Memorial Day cookout but I could see sipping this by the fireside in about 5 months. Nice job here."
"Pours a nice looking medium to deep copper with a fluffy off white head. Aroma is of dried fruits, some caramel and a hint of alcohol. Taste is sweet, fruity, more malty than hoppy. Some alcohol is definitely present in the taste. Mouthfeel is thick, sweet, and a bit sticky. Carbonation is low, but adequate. Not my favorite barleywine, definitely could benefit from a bit of hop presence."
"Mouthfeel is somewhat syrupy. Carbonation is light and adds some interest keeping the feel from being too sticky. Not what I would call drinkable, but its an enjoyable single bottle. The oak aged version, Insanity, is a completely different animal."
"Pours a nice burgundy color with a little head to begin with but then none, some lacing in strings now and then. The aroma isn't the least bit shy, nor the alcohol, which seems to seep into everything. There are figs and raisins and plums here, as with the taste, and some faint toffee. The mouth is kinda hot, not exactly smooth but good enough, almost puckers up from bittering toward the end and a dry finish. Pretty good English style barley wine I must say. I can appreciate this beer, its actually pretty good, but in the end I just don't exactly like it."
"This one could use some time in the cellar but I don't know how much that will help. It's a popular beer but I just can't get behind this one. Try it for yourself and see what you find."
"D: Heftier ABV, again, as per the norm. Might become a bit heavy, almost even cloying towards the end of the bottle. One at a time for me, I'd say."
"D : Real easy to drink. Not as hoppy as most American barleywines which I really enjoy"
"Definitely a good one to sip."
"Pretty good and my favorite Weyerbacher offering so far."
"A much better beer on-tap than in the bottle."
"Smooth and oily texture, broken up and made more palatable by a fine tingle of carbonation; abv limits how many of these one can drink, but the character of the brew is neither heavy nor over the top. Not my favorite, but certainly not at all bad."
"An interesting beer. Worth a try. Less of a hop kick than an American Barleywine, but some interesting flavors nevertheless."
"This poured a hazy brown with very little head. It smelled of malt and fall spices, like pumpkin, with a bit of hops. It had a spicy malt flavor with a heavy taste like a brown ale. It wasn't very bitter, and the aftertaste was smooth, making the beer easy to drink. The texture was nice too, but not very carbonated. Overall this was an enjoyable drink, but nothing unique for a barleywine."
"Almost too easy to drink, but one is enough since the ABV does sneak up on you."
"This one typifies the Weyerbacher attempts at attacking beers. You get what you come for."
"I picked up several smells taking a whiff, including caramel, cinnamon, honey, something like liquor (bourbon?), pepper and some mild citric notes. A great tasting beer that was a little spicy yet also sugary and went down very smooth. Bubblegum and honey are in the taste, but caramel came through the most in this full-bodied brew, and maybe that's why this beer has a little stickiness to it. Though the ABV is hidden well, still a sipping beer because of the sweetness. And with those two reasons I could see having one of these at a time, but I couldn't have a couple in one sitting."
"Pours a light transluscent amber color with a moderatly lasting beige head. Smell is light, and fruity with notes of peaches, apricot and lemon. Taste is a tingly, prickly, sweet and mainly alcoholic flavor much like vodka. Light bodied for the style, I thought, and definitely a bit hotter and thinner flavored than I like my barley wines."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's full bodied. Definitely a sipping beer. Carbonation is good. It's definitely strong at 11.1%. It goes down easy, but I wouldn't drink more than one personally. Overall, this is a pretty impressive barleywine."
"Weyerbacher never seems to dissapoint me, aggressive as always."
"I posted a 2.0 for the appearance because it's a bottle conditioned beer and gives one alot of sedement...ugh."
"D: This is dangerous! This is a real treat, tons of personality and some serious kick. It obviously has earned its name!"
"This is a sipper very easy to drink but the high abv will get you. This is one to end the evening with"
"Drinkability: This is quite complex but not as over-the-top as some barleywines. It finishes relatively smooth."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, slightly filling, strong kick, good representation of style, this is a nice beer to drink a couple of and relax with, but I would to drink too much more than that in one night."
"Barley wine style. Definitely. Blithering Idiot is deceptive in that it is quite sweet in both nose and mouth and manages to hide that serious kick with the exception of some enjoyable warming at the end. Awesome. And that color! Almost like a ruby colored port. So long as you aren't put off by the sweet profile, you will probably like this. Recommended."
"This is not bad, but it is not great. I wish I had aged this longer than six months. But it is cold outside and thought this would be a good treat. This would be a good treat if the alcohol was a bit more subtle."
"Certainly nor a bad beer, but not one I'd make a great effort to find."
"Big bodied and noticeably viscous. Lightly carbonated. This beer is a nice sipper for a cold windy winter night. It's not 7pm yet and surely this will be my nightcap today."
"D, notes: A good sipping smooth barley wine. It is probably overly sweet and would improve with age but I had no problem drinking it fresh."
"D = A good drinkable American made barley wine, not outstanding, but definitely something I will try again."
"D: Very good. I enjoyed this beer."
"If you buy six of these I would recommend inviting five friends over to help out."
"D: Very tasty and not a bad B.W., but rough around the edges and the alcohol is too present. I have to say it's average overall. A couple of these really will make you a Blithering Idiot."
"As a final note, and not to bash this creation of Weyerbacher in any way, but all I can think of when drinking this is that its like an American macro on steroids."
"As like many Weyerbacher brews, this was over-the-top, very eccentric, and really a sipper... the hefty 11.1% ABV must be treated with caution... it will sneak up on you without a doubt... appearance was appealing... ruby-red, copper appearance with minimal frothy head... smell was thick, with strong nutty, toffe aroma... very, very rich, thick, creamy toffee, caramel, brown sugar taste that is really strong and powerful... this brew is certainly one to be reckoned with... malty, full of dark, brown Belgian sugars and creamy flavors... a dominating and powerful brew that you have to take easily... interesting brew... worth a try and typical of many Weyerbacher samples..."
"Reddish copper in color, impressive head with incredible retention and massive lacing down the sides of my pub glass. The on-tap version seems to be much better than the the bottled version. Aroma is typical of a barley wine, woody, musky and kind of citrusy. Taste is perfect; I would not change a thing. Plenty of barley and a nice hop/yeast balance. You must try this one."
"I can feel the warmth of this beer. Unfortunately, this decreases the drinkability as I can make out the alcohol and it is sometimes difficult to complete even the 12oz bottle. The barrel aged version is much better as it adds a few levels of complexity that masks the heat."
"D-- i will buy this again or try it again as i did enjoy it...but i dont think i could have more than one or else i would become a blithering idiot...11.1abv is definetly noticeable after the first half of the glass"
"12 ouncer, allowed to warm up near room temp. Pours a nice warm honey almond, clear, under a puffy medium tan head, showing respectable retention and then leaving thick sticky sheeting. Intense nose of fruit, alcohol, and clearly cherries and banana peels. Warming, rich, buttery with notes of more fruit, leather, butter. Intense and bold brew. Fine quality night capper/sipper. I put a bottle of this nectar away to let it soften up a bit. Well worth a try."
"Pours a fully clouded brown that has orange/red hues. Nose is definitely fruit-like. Minor cherries mostly. Flavor is influenced by alcohol. I can tell that right off the bat, but it does stay mild enough so as to not ruin the whole thing. Mild fruity edge. Mild raisins on the end as it warms. Not a lot of complexity, but definitely full bodied. Feel is typical. This is very drinkable since it is so smooth. But like I said, not a whole lot of complexity at this point."
"Murky brown amber body hossts a light tan head that fades down to a half inch of skim joam in just a minute or so. Nose is creamy sweet with hints of vanilla bean ice cream, spicey fruit, and yeast doughnuts. Very sweet mix of yeasty spice and rich maltieness dominates the tongue on first sip. Sweet candied alchol warms the belly and tingles the tongue when mingled with the zesty spice. Nice dark fruit notes twords the end of the palate. Mouthfeel is almost taffy like. Overall sweetness does hurt the drinkability a little."
"Drinkability: If I knew when this bottle was packaged, I would be able to guage how long I should age it.... I believe that this may mellow with time.... right now... it's a little tough to take. I would recommend letting this cellar for a year or three."
"Maybe I'll keep a few bottles for a year or two to see if that edge goes away. I'm sure it will. Until then... It's just not very good."
"Blithering Idiot undoubtedly is a description of someone who drinks too many of this 11% ABV brew. I have only one 12 ounce bottle so that shouldn't be any more of a description of me than usual. It's a beautiful ruby orange color in the glass with moderate lacing left at the end. The aroma is malty sweetness. There is little hops influence and mostly malt in the flavor, which favors orange, dates and toffee. There is a noticeable alcohol warming, mellow in character, that I don't mind on a December night of 12 degrees. This is my first barleywine - I enjoyed the style and definitely would drink this version again"
"Full bodied beer that goes down very smooth. Pretty good beer, but also kind of average."
"Incredibly smooth and creamy. This beer feels rich. A slight fizziness on the tongue followed by this really creamy texture makes this really balanced and drinkable."
"Overall: Not the best Barleywine but far from the worse. I would call it middle of the road. If you like alcohol burn and tons of malt, you may rate this one a bit highter."
"d: A pretty good example of an English style barleywine, but there are better."
"A super malty, super boozy barleywine that does not hide its booze well? Yeah, as a late-night-front-of-a-fire-in-the-dead-of-winter-sipper its outstanding. And if that's all you're using it for, then it's a 5. But it's not. As a whole, this is a beer you only want to/can afford to have one of. Which is fine, barley wine's aren't sessionable by any stretch of the imagination. But this one takes some effort. However, since this beer eventually becomes Insanity it gets a load of respect; you need a good base, and this is it. It just needs to be aged in oak before its great. And that may very well be this beer's most noteworthy and interesting fact. It's always fun to imagine with big beers what they will be like when aged awhile; it's why so many people cellar. This beer is unique because it's probably one of the only examples we have of beers that can be sampled both fresh and aged, commercially produced that is. And it's a beer that you can drink and realize why beer should, in some cases be cellared. This beer almost proves a point more than anything. It's kind of like listening to Kid A, and then hearing OK Computer for the first time. You knew that when you listened to Kid A that Radiohead was unique; OK Computer showed you how they got there. This is the OK Computer of beers. I like that."
"I picked up this single bottle at Total Wine in Greensboro, NC just over a week ago. It pours a nice translucent amber into a pint glass. The head didn't last long even though it began with a nice set of dense off-white bubbles. I was reminded of strong Belgian ales as I took a deep sniff; scents of brown sugar, raisons, and strong caramel malts. The flavor is intense, and the alcohol sets in rather quickly. I detected flavors of caramel, ripe dark fruits, and warming alcohol. Some hops are certainly present at the finish and lingering aftertaste. I like the silky mouthfeel of this brew; it's not overly carbonated. This is a very good barleywine-style ale. It's probably my second favorite behind Olde School by Dogfish Head."
"This isn't hard to drink, but definetly a sipper because of the high alcohol content."
"Drinkability- Wondering why on earth this one doesn't get a 4 or better average. This was one of the better English style barleywines I have ever had. Maybe it ages very well and a fresh version isn't quite as good? At any rate, this was an excellent beer."
"Overall this is a pretty decent barley wine in my opinion."
"I was very happy to receive this as an extra in a trade with VWCraig, thanks! The pour was a nice dark orange with a frothy head that died pretty quick. The smell was candy and caramel and sugars, yum. The taste was also like candied fruits and was pretty delicious. The alcohol was not overt but I could easily tell this beer was a powerhouse. Excellent brew from Weyerbacher and restores my faith after that raspberry imperial stout mess I had two nights ago. While I definitely prefer American style Barleywines (especially West Coast) this was a winner."
"Mouthfeel is full bodied, and it's quite creamy. Drinkability is hurt by the high abv but more so by how noticeable and burning the alcohol is. Overall, this is a tasty brew, but it's a sipper for sure."
"Tastes of fruits ( dates and prunes come to mind), caramel, malts and a huge warming alcohol. A solid EBW and I am glad I bought a six pack."
"This beer pours a dark ruby with off-white head. The aroma smells like a concentrated cherry and fruit punch mix. The flavor starts with a big sweet, light caramel candy taste. The flavor is balanced a bit by earthy hops, but the malts dominate. Overall, this beer is tasty, but not that complex and the alcohol heat catches up with you as it warms. Still worth trying if you're into English barleywines."
"Drinkability: I figured there was a reason I had to like Insanity so much, and it makes sense given that Blithering Idiot is the forefront. A wonderfully complex English Barley Wine, and I do say that I'm more of a fan of this style than some of the more greener and raucous American Barley Wines. Not so much hops that it's assaulting, and wonderful fruity characteristics abound. Keep it up, Weyerbacher."
"Good stuff. It poured out smooth, although with very little head (normal with barleywine) and absolutely no lacing as I drank it. BI has a very nice deep brown/copper color. It had an excellent scent, strongly hoppy and for some reason it reminded me of raison-walnut pie. For such a high ABV beer, it went down smooth, although it was a little rough in the mouth. It had an excellent strong flavor, not as bitter as I would have thought. A nice balance of bitter and sweetness."
"Drank like a 11%+ abv barley wine, maybe this ages gracefully? Not impressed"
"As solid looking brew, pours a very hazy orangish brown with an OK head that soon leaves only a lace around the ring of my snifter. Aroma is very sweet, brown sugar and caramel and those characteristics carry over to the taste, mixed in with some run, raisins and prunes. Some big alcohol backing up this brew, but the sweetness helps this brew become more drinkable. Goes down fairly smooth with the alcohol not becoming too overpowering."
"Drinkability: Have a few on a wintery day, or if you have to go shovel snow. It will certainly be more enjoyable. This beer would do well with more complexity in the taste department, which I think Insanity provides, through oak aging. However, it is an afforable barleywine that could seal the deal with 2 or 3 in one night. Nicely done."
"This shocked me when I first drank it. The smell was very strong. I was able to get used to it and the typical barley wine drinker would probably too. However, this is not the faint of heart. I felt its thickness and sharp, ultra-malty taste was welcomed but very strong during first sips. One or two bottles of this drink is far enough due to its strong alcohol volume. More than that will probably make you into an idiot."
"Taste is very malty and sweet. The alcohol can be tasted and leaves a nice warmth in my throat. Bitterness just succeeds to balance the sweetness and develops during the glass. In the end it is a bit sharp and raw, but not in a bad way. I can also taste some citrus in here, probably the hops. The yeast leaves a nice fruity taste and reminds me of an English yeast strain. Although I feel this is a nice brew, I found it to be a little too sweet, which made it a bit one-dimensional and inhibited the drinkability."
"Bottom line: This one has potential to be a really good BWSA. From what I sampled, it's just a tad too ""hot""."
"Pours a clean deep amber, with a light tan head, that did not last. Aromas of alcohol and a dry fruit. Tastes of dry dark fruit, with an alcohol end. A dry alcohol aftertaste, also a fruit presence is left behind as well. Big alcohol, another big beer, yet a great sipper, better as it warms up by not being so abrasive."
"This is a powerful beer that is deceptive because of the flavor profile. The balance is the most attractive part of this offering--most barley wines are overpoweringly sweet or alcohol-laden. This beer lands like a nice double bock, ale style."
"Pours a viscous amber-brown with a tight, but thin off-white head. Rich, complex aromas of dark, dried fruits, raisin bread, molasses, caramel and toasted malts along with a definitve red wine character. Mouthfeel is pleasingly full, round, smooth and chewy. An explosion of complex flavors greet the tongue; figs, raisin, dark rum, brown sugar, dark caramel and malt. The alcohol nicely accentuates the array of flavors and the BWs complexity. Finishes long and sweet with just a touch of hoppy bitterness at the very end. A big brew made to sip and enjoy slowly"
"A lot of bbbles, very minimal head, big bubbles though. Murky, cloudy opaque amber-brown color. Possibly apricot in the flavor? Good mouthfeel, slight alcohol afterburn. Alcohol is hidden quite well though for its content. Also a distinct malt-sweetness, fruity taste. Good brew but nothing to get all that excited about."
"D: Pretty drinkable despite the high alcohol content. The sweet, malty taste does a good job of shielding your palette from the large amount of alcohol. The only downside is that it is kind of filling."
"Good beer."
"Weyerbacker Blithering Idiot pours a ruby red with a nice creamy head that lingers. Aroma is dark fruity esters and plenty of sweetness. Flavor is malt sweetness with tons more dark fruit flavors. Caramel and toffee give way to a sharp, slightly hot alcohol flavor with mild bitterness. The abundance of alcohol detracts from the beers drinkability, but it is delicious none the less. I was waiting for a cool summer night so I could pretend it was winter and enjoy a nice barley wine."
"Very good beer overall."
"Drinkability- A very relaxing sipping beer. It has a lot of class like a cognac or brandy."
"Thanks to Eyedrinkale for this bottle."
"D- The alcohol is not well hidden (which I expected) but this is still an enjoyable brew. This is a breakthrough brew for me because I was turned off completely to barley wine by a different brew. I would have this again and am now open to trying other barley wines. Nice job Weyerbacher."
"D: The alcohol is huge in this beer; just sitting here I can feel the effects of it. The malts don't disappoint and there is a surprisingly strong hop body midway through. Having had a fresh bottle, I realize that my previous review was of an old bottle that sat in the bottle shop too long."
"The taste hits the tongue a runnin': a plethora of piney hops, alcohol, sweet caramel malts, and more alcohol. There's a little too much going on here...but I am ""warming up"" to the barleywine style and this beer definately has helped that process. A crisp, sharp mouthfeel with a fantastic bitter hop finish ensues. All in all, this brew is complex enough for 5 beers; it's tasty and packs quite a punch as far as ABV goes. I doubt I could have more than one of these in any 24 hour period, but it's something I'd surely look for again."
"I wish I had taken detailed notes on this beer, but instead I'm relying on my 6th sense of beer perception. I bought a Blithering Idiot - first time ever - at Bocktown outside of Pittsburgh. I had remembered hearing good things about the brew on BeerAdvocate so I figured I'd give it a shot. I was impressed. Big, smooth, a nice hoppy balance, and quite drinkable for a n 11 percent beer. Next time I hope to document my tongue's impression a bit better. Nevertheless, this is a really nice beer."
"Drinkable - sort of :) Unlike the tremendously drinkable Bigfoot (imho), this one is much more a sipper...and one seems more than enough."
"Final Thought: Quite simply a solid barley wine from Weyerbacher."
"D: Not really...Too much punch to drink more than 1. I had higher expectations due to all the hype. What did Public Enemy say ? Don't believe the...oh well. Weyerbacher always seems to do everything too big. Too much spice or too much alcohol."
"A 12oz bottle poured into a snifter, this is an attractive beer. Red/orange color, small head, nicely carbonated. It had a dark fruit, malty aroma. The taste showed a strong malt presence, with little, if any, hops . This was a mild beer, not at all aggressive. I thought it to be very drinkable, even at 11% ABV."
"Note 2: This beer is the reason that I got this mixed case, I was listening to the Basic Brewing Radio podcast and they were talking about barley wine so I went down to the distributor and found this case. I am glad that I enjoyed the other beers in the case more because at this point this one is a disappointment. I still have a two bottles of this left in a dark corner of my cellar so I will allow them to age further hopefully that will curb the alcohol and allow this one to shine. I think that it really could (of course this is the only Barley Wine I've had to date so maybe I'm completely off base)."
"Drinkability: Take it slow. First sip's a doozie. Likely, you'll only want one, but it does taste better as you go along."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and full bodied. Pretty easy to drink, though more than a couple would be tough, due to the ABV. I haven't had many barley wines to compare this to, but I definately like this beer."
"Drinkability - I have to admit I was a bit of late-comer to the Barley Wines, but this is the 2nd one in a month that I've enjoyed immensely (both English style). I had a bottle of this when I first got my case and wasn't a huge fan, but I let this sit for about 4/5 months and the results were fantastic!!! Give this brew a try (but maybe let it sit for a while), you won't be disappointed."
"Drinkability: Well, it's a big, bad barleywine. You're not going to pound several of these (unless you're me several years ago - see above). That said, it's a fairly enjoyable sipper."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a snifter glass. Cellared for about six months. Appears a dark reddish-amber color with about a finger of dense off-white foam. Smells of sweet malts, stewed fruits, and alcohol. Tastes of sugary caramel malts, plums/prunes, and maybe a touch of dried cherry. Full bodied and creamy in the mouth with medium carbonation. This is a tasty barley wine. Recommended."
"From the bottle into a snifter, this poured a shiny, dark copper with purple hues and no head whatsoever. The smell was the best part of the beer, bringing in some complexities, but dominated by the alcohol presence to go along with fruity flavors, primarily an acidic red grape. The taste was also alcohol dominant combined with a sharp turn to the carbonation with a slightly bitter finish. This tastes more like a wine or a cognac than a barleywine. Lots of complexities, just not well-mixed. Maybe I'll give this another try as I am a big fan of the style and the brewery, just not the brew in front of me."
"Oddly, this tastes pretty darn close to Insanity. I would not have expected this much vanilla flavor from an un-oak-aged barley wine. The alcohol is very prevalent in this fresh. I think this may be the one Weyerbacher brew that I prefer with some oak aging. This is decent, but not as nice as the Insanity. Either way, I love weyerbacher and everything they do.... I'll happily buy this again."
"D - for what it is, its almost perfect."
"Thanks to Aprilluvsbeer for sharing this one with me. Poured a semi-cloudy bronze orange colour with an offwhite foamy cap that faded away in a matter of seconds. A patch work of frost still remains on the top. Smell is sweet malts, cooked fruit, and alcohol. Lots of alcohol. Taste is the same, almost reminding me of a Belgian Tripel with its cooked fruit note. This is a good beer, but it's far from an English Barley Wine. Any English Barley Wine I've ever had, anyway. Mouthfeel is nice and thick; a solid, full-bodied ale. Drinkability is a 3.0 at best due to its 11%+abv. Not bad."
"All physical components of this beer such as color, pour, aroma, etc. were well crafted. However, my enjoyment of this beer was set back by its high alcohol content, which made this beer hard for me to get through. The flavor was great, but hope for more of it to balance out the alcohol."
"I really liked this departure from some of the other barleywnes on the market- sweeter but still very drinkable. Poured hazy dark, dark amber with sticky head and lacing. Ripe fruits, very sugary malt aromas with a spicy alcoholic whiff. Molasses- pure and simple. Thick, slick fruity molasses but still smooth and not overly sweet. Finished with an almost roasted character and a slight piney hop punch. I can hardly taste the big alcohol, though the bottle is more than a few months old. Highly recommended."
"A very nice barley wine style from a vastly underrated brewery."
"I finally took the leap and purchased this wonderfully-nomenclatured beverage at a local beer purveyor, not because Im any type of Barleywine lover, but because I love Weyerbacher and I love the name. It poured a rusty brown, with the visual luster of African pond water, and hardly any head. The flavor was characteristic for a barleywine ... stinging and alcoholy, caramel and malty. On the first swallow, I must say, I was not floored the way I expected to be. This was relatively mellow, although warming in my throat. The 11% is more than evident, but well balanced within a fig cookie, a prune shake, a sugarplum. If I need to cozy up to the fire this February with a barleywine, this will top my list. (#2678, 2/3/07)"
"The appearance was a cooper, rust, orange color, Really didn't pick up much of a smell, a little piney, and some sweet malt. Initial taste was a nice warm malt with quality hop character. Even thought it didn't pour with much of a head it did have a nice mouth feel. Not the best of the Barleywine style but it is a nice balanced warming beer that I really did enjoy."
"The beer has a complex taste, malty, but the hops are noticable... as is the alcohol. This beer isn't the best barleywine i've ever had, but it serves its purpose. Its good to sip on during a cold night, maybe after dinner."
"Poured into a chalice a nice dark golden amber color, nice carbonation, a nice creamy tan head appears with some nice islands and sticky lacing around the edges. The nose is of sweet malts, hops, bubblegum, pineapple, and caramel. The taste is sweet/malty, slight alcohol warming effect, nice slight bitter clean finish. Medium body, well rounded brew. Very drinkable, I really like this one, some what different than other BWSA I've had in taste. Highly recommended."
"I dont know how to improve this beer except it could use a little more filtration. All that yeast weighs down this great beer."
"Drinkability is pretty good, definitely a sipper as its kind of 'hot', though I think if you had more than a couple of these, in short time you'd be much like this beer's namesake."
"D - Really suffers from the fact that this brew is all alcohol. Maybe some age would help the flavors pull together."
"This is a wonderfully delicious brew."
"D- This beer has a smooth flavor with good depth and makes a big beer very drinkable."
"This is a raw one. I didn't mind the high abv - expected for style - but it's too sharp to really enjoy and there is some flavor, but not enough to cover the persistant alcohol. An ok slow-sipper, but not as rich and complex as other barleywines out there."
"Overall I really enjoy this one and will always pick up if I see it. A good representation of the style without going way off in left field with strange flavors."
"A flavorful, high octaine barleywine. A sipping ale to be enjoyed with friends in the colder months, or by yourself in the dead of summer. Either way, a delicious offering!"
"Drinkability is not terrible. It's just slow. I enjoyed the flavor enough to want to finish the bottle, and the enjoyed the alcoholic bite. A real winter warmer, and I think I'll find another one to cellar for a couple of years. This one needs time to blend and mellow into perfection. I had a lot of sediment by the time I got to the bottom of the glass -enough to make a tornado of it while swirling the glass- and this beer was made to soak in that a while longer."
"Blithering Idiot wins in the first round by TKO. The alcohol beat me into submission. Right now this one is rather unbalanced. I don't know if that is necessarily bad, but I'm going to cellar a few of these to see what becomes of them. With any luck this badass will mellow out a little bit. I look forward to encountering it again."
"High ABV, savor this at the end of your day by the fire!"
"Cheers."
"Opened up this bottle after having aged it for two years. Still a strong beer witha nice light head from the poor, and a great smell in the nose. Lots of dark fruit, raisins, and caramel. Musty, old ale smell with the strong alcohol rising up to grab you. But the taste is a bit oxidized and doesn't improve the beer. I really liked it fresh (same batch of bottles), but the aging didn't improve this one. Head somewhere else for something to cellar."
"Yet another barleywine with an entertaining name, this one is as fun to drink as it is to say. The ABV is heavy duty and in your face, and it's also very warm, maybe even hot, but it doesn't distract so much as it joins in making the whole presentation seem big. It drinks cautiously but well. It seems blithering like an idiot can indeed be a good thing."
"M/D- Extremely complex, and changing all the time...many flavors in a thick hearty ale....a beer I enjoy and at an extremely reasonable price $2.99 for 12 oz at my local store."
"pours a one finger tan color head which fades quickly very little lacing and a slightly cloudy amber color. smell sweet, fruity, you can smell the alcohol you know you have some serious beer here. taste is sweet of ripe peaches with rum or brandy other fruity taste there. mouthfeel is medium, syrupy but enjoyable. this is my first time for this type of beer and i enjoyed it but i would not drink to many at one sitting."
"No doubt about it, this is a beer to be savored, one to drink slowly. It's very drinkable for its strength, to the point I almost forgot it was such a strong brew. Creamy and smooth, I could put away a couple of these on a cold winter's night... and I think I'd be quite satisfied after that."
"D: Good barleywine, a little too bitter for me in the taste catergory though"
"d: I had a great time enjoying this drink and hope to enjoy it again. Gave me some odd flashbacks of Robo-tripping. ha!! Have 1 to many though and I may become the blithering idiot!!"
"Had a rough time finishing one beer,not a beer I would care to drink again."
"Cheers2Beers"
"This beer pours a translucent amber with a small fizzy head that holds little leaving little lace. The smell is sweet caramel with other malty aromas. Very little hops are present in the smell. The taste is very sweet with a bit of almost tea like flavor providing some bitterness. Again very little hops appear in the beer. The mouthfeel is almost a full body with nice carbonation. Overall its a decent barley wine but it does not approach the complexity and superiority that an American Barley Wine offers."
"Notes: I love this barleywine. Big malt and fruity flavors with that nice, warming alcohol. Pretty easy to drink as well, for a barleywine. Probably has something to do with the low hopping rate. Gotta give props for the clever name as well."
"I am interested in having this again, just not quickly. Not a bad beer, but I would like to try some more BW before this again."
"The taste is simply outstanding - richer perhaps than Samichlaus for gawsh sakes; I'd say the Sami is a tad smoother, though. Right now, my top 3 favorites are Samichlaus Bier, Dogfish Head 120 Minute IPA and this Weyerbacher Blithering Idiot. Perhaps I like the Barley wine style, but this one is special."
"Overall, this is a good, if somewhat unsurprising barleywine. Very sweet, very strong, and fairly smooth overall."
"A beautiful looking beer, hazed cherry coloured with just enough clarity to see a blurred finger through the other side. Little bits of yeast cling to the sides of the bottom of the tulip glass. Lovely. Responsive carbonation, bubbles rise to the top then sizzle out. A bourbon like aroma, full of alcohol and sweet sherry-like notes. Very sweet. A candy malt to the extreme. Mouthfeel is spotlessly smooth. A dense presence of malt that fades ever so gently. Like a gentle giant - too gently maybe considering how bold its flavour is. Big upfront malt flavour with no depth or resonance. Alcohol easily noticeable but not in the least distracting - drinkability is more than fair. This has some great features, I would surely recommend, but it honestly failed to get me going in ways other barleywines have."
"Pours like a belgian dubble, great lacing but minimal head. Aroma and taste is mascerated fruit, and rum. Boozy and big, but in a good way. You can taste the alcohol, but it's not obtrusive. Mouthfeel is okay, not great but not bad. A good example of the style, but not a home run hitter."
"drinkability on this one would probably be good with a little age, but right now it's still a little hot. i can see the potential though, so i'm going to add it back onto my wants and see if i can lay one down for a while."
"D- It warms you up, but be careful."
"Cheers, Jeff!"
"D- It is very good. I would definitely say it is a sipper. Maybe a little better at hiding the alcohol and this beer would be very good. Would buy this again if I had it available."
"Enjoy if you can get it, cellar it for sure!"
"You know, maybe this one needs to age some or something - I don't think I'd go for this in lieu of more flavorful 'wines. The alcohol's just too strong and too prominent - if it mellowed a bit, I think it'd be a different experience."
"Had this at an Oktoberfest and glad that i did cause i dont think i would have tried it anywhere else. Poured a deep chocolate color with hints of red in it. Dont quote me on this though, i had a few beers in me at the time. Not being a big barley wine person i was amazed on how smooth and good this beer was. Would definetly try again."
"All four beers I've tried from Weyerbacher have been fantastic, and Blithering Idiot is no different. Tried at the Charlotte Oktoberfest and though my brother disliked it, it was his first barley wine. I would like to review it further with a bigger sample, but it was worth saying to spend the money if you see it out there."
"Blithering Idiot is right, at least after more than one of these. It's a very tasty and I would want more in the future, but there's no way I would want to do more than one in a sitting. I'm feeling very happy and complete after just one."
"Opinion: I am really impressed with this Barley Wine. It is really easy to drink and has a drinkable hop balance. It is really balanced for this styleespecially for an American version. The whole thing comes across as a tad heavy, but what can you expect from a beer that is strong and tastes this mild. This is a really good barley wine, and I would definitely drink it again."
"Other notes- Not bad, but will probably get better with some age. I'll lay aside the rest of them for a year or so."
" blithering idiot "
"This bottle comes from the same variety case as my previous review. After over a year in the cellar, we have some nice changes. The beer forms a half finger light tan head in my snifter, which fades quickly to a ring of large bubbles over a murky ruby-brown body filled with yeast sediment. The nose is still highly alcoholic, with sugar, caramel, and strong malt. The taste has mild caramel, and is mildly fruity. It's mellowed a lot, and hides the alcohol much better. The mouthfeel is on the lighter side, with low carbonation. It should be chewier. A nice, easy BW."
"Pours an inviting medium brown and copper color and clear with a small cream colored head which fades back quickly. Great aroma of dried cherries, a little bit of sweet grape, toasted coconut with marshmallow, and a little pineapple juice. A very rich barleywine aroma with nice complexity, one you can't stop sniffing. The taste wasn't quite as complex but was still enjoyable and had some malty breadiness and caramel flavors. Decent alcohol presence in the taste and nice drying finish. Also a decent amount of hop bitterness for the style. Enjoyable barleywine."
"D- Really like this one. I like alcohol warmth and fruit sweetness so this is right up my alley. Along with Bells Third Coast Old Ale this is a very, very nice barleywine."
"Overall. Quite enjoyable. A sipper for me, but still quite drinkable."
"Pours a pretty dark coppery orange with a nice white head. Very sweet aroma with some fruit notes - apples and oranges. Very sweet malt flavor with some citrusy and spicy hops that leave a lingering bitterness - nicely balanced. Alcohol is also noticable. Heavy mouthfeel and very carbonated, perhaps a bit too carbonated. Pretty drinkable for the alcohol content"
"Deep copper amber with an off-white head that dissolves to clingy lace. Easy drinker despite the high ABV. Very well concealed strength. Flavor and aroma are largely one dimensional and port like. That port quality consists largely of booze soaked dark fruits and spices that tend to indicate high alcohol presence. Hops are much lighter than expected indicating that this barley wine follows the English tradition rather than the American. Mouthfeel is rather warming and light for a barley wine. Flavor and aroma greatly improve as the beer warms to room temp but it remains rather dull and lacking in complexity. Still very drinkable and in fact dangerously easy to gulp down. Many thanks to expatsteve for the sample."
"The smell is strong, with hefty malt and alcohol. The taste is also powerful. Dark malt dominates with some caramel flavor. Alcohol comes through while hops are lightly present in the finish. The mouthfeel is solid and full. Drinkability is very good, especially considering the alcohol content."
"Thanks to BeerBeing for another fine brew."
"Overall an excellent representation of the class. I do prefer a bit more hops in my BW, but a still an excellent example."
"D: Yet another mediocre brew from Weyerbacher. Drinkable, but there are too many other good barleywines to buy this one again."
"D - This one is slightly hard to drink due to the booze flavor."
"Bravo, bravo, bravo. A wonderful beverage!"
"If you dont like the taste of booze stay away, go try a soda or something,.. the flavor to balance in here is good, I agree with some that a year or so may make this a Gem, for now it is just a very solid BW that could use a touch of smoothing."
"D: This is a good, straight forward version of an English Barleywine. Malts definately run the show it this beer, the hops play second fiddle."
"Very smooth with no bite at all in the finish. Overall a very nice barley wine. I'm beginning to enjoy this style more and more. I'll have to get a fresh one of these soon to compare and see how this one aged. Another solid offering from Weyerbacher."
"Drinkability: I could be persuaded to drink another one, but only after a while. Be careful with this one because if you drink two or more of these in a sitting you will become a Blithering Idiot! A nice Barley wine!"
"The beer is very rich in unusual malt flavors, but the bitterness balances it nicely."
"Drinkability/Overall: Against a lineup of true competition, this one just didn't hold up as well. Needs more complexity, be it in the malts or hops to compete with the almost oppressive booze that, when compared to Viking's Berserk, isn't well hidden at all."
"-UF"
"Drinkability  Wellthose huge dominant characteristics just burn too much. Not that balanced and not that easy to down."
"Drinkability: As a strong barleywine, I'd probably stick to one or two, and was glad to split this bottle with Golden2wenty1 and DaPeculierDane. Nicely balanced, with a good solid flavor. Definitely something I'd return to in colder months."
"It's a bit too sugary tasting and the alcohol could be hidden quite a bit better. It's not bad but definitely not my favorite English barley wine. I might get another one of these and sit it down for a year or four."
"Tastes vanilla and caramel, toffee, and sherry oxidation. A bit hot in the alcohol, but it's a clean burn. The alcohol is covered by a wet fruity and sweet. Actually, there are quite a few dark fruit flavors in here like I find in St Bernardus Abt 12. Chocolate covered plum and raisin with a touch of cherry sour. Thick mouthfeel and mild carbonation. Consumed cellar temp and allowed to warm.This was a deliciousmalty treat."
"This beer pours a dark reddish orange with a small white head. Not bad for a barleywine,but nothing really special. The smell is lighter than other barleywines with only a small aroma of dark fruit and alcohol present. The taste is creamy with dark fruit and alcohol,this beer packs a punch, and leaves your mouth with a slightly bitter hop aftertaste. The m/f is heavy with all the flavors mixing OK,but the alcohol taste does dominate this beer making this less complex than other barleywines. A decent beer,but I really expected more."
"Tastes of rich malt and oaky vanilla. Lots of alcohol, overpowers the other flavors a bit. Some biting hops in the finish as it warms. Lightly sticky mouth. Big beer. Some hops linger, builds as you get further down the pint. This could use a bit of age, it's a little hot right now. Loads of potential though."
"The taste is astringent at first, and numbing, but not puckering. However, this barleywine provides its own salve by way of a huge caramel malt backbone that is crafted like a spun sugar sculpture: Beautiful. Dark spots of charred grains are reminiscent of wood and tannin, and toasted peanut brittle. There are pithy pits of cherry and peaches. This is sticky and fragrant like a local, and strange, honey, and like a homemade fruit cordial. This is 100% barley wine."
"I love the ultra-hopped US barley wines, they're almost worth dying for, but it's nice to experience something different, with more balance. But drink it too fast and it'll knock your socks off just the same."
"Overall- a nice ""light"" barlywine. This one doesn't cause you to pucker your mouth or whip your head about. Nice and mild. A good choice!"
"Pours a murky deep amber with a very nice tan head that retains well for an 11%. The aroma is a rich amalgam of dark fruits (fig, plum, cherry, grape), caramel, toffee, toasted bread, esters, floral hops and alcohol...very british and very appealing. The taste has intense notes of caramel, toffee, dark fruits (fig, plum, cherry, grape), floral hops, esters, toasted bread and ethanol. The mouthfeel is full and rich, while carbonation is light and drinkability is good for the style. A very nice interpretation of an english barleywine, structured like J.W. Lees with a sweet finish this is a definite winner."
"Okay to good drinkability. Maybe a tad to bitter for a Barley Wine."
"A really like this brew, however at 11% it is quite strong so sipping is recommended."
"Received in a trade from Fish113d. Deep cloudy, dark copper and amber mix. The head is short but is nice and swirly with good retention. Subtle streaming carbonation is also visible. The aroma is fairly strong, mostly malty, with a nose of raisin and sugar, and a hint of alcohol. Reminiscent of a Wee Heavy or perhaps even a Doppelbock. The taste leans heavily on the malt side also, with cinnamon raisin dominating. The bitterness remains low and there isn't much hop balance to go with. The alcohol is well disguised. Mouthfeel is slightly buttery and smooth. The carbonation is again mild, but adequate. This brew had alot of flavor but seemed very one-dimensional for me, decreasing the drinkablility significantly. Worth a try..."
"Drinkability is good enjoyed every sip. A big alcohol presence but it feels right at home in this one."
"Overall a well-balanced example of the style."
"Sometimes I am inspired by the Weyerbacher beers, and sometimes I am not. Their Blithering Idiot barleywine-style left me somewhere in the middle. Nice pour. Rich, burnt-orange copper color. Head dissipated quickly, with little to no lace. Hearty aroma. Hints of plum, molasses, prunes. Spicy scent too, which was nice. A very settling flavor. Considering the high ABV, this wasn't an overpowering barleywine. I could see myself having two of these before realizing the alcohol content. Nice mouthfeel. Sturdy, but not too malty, not too syrupy (which many barleywines can be). Nice, clean finish. The Weyerbacher Quad is a bit strong for my tastes, but I'd come back to the Blithering Idiot for seconds."
"Bottom line: It's not quite at Old Guardian's level, but it's right there with Old Ruffian, Hog Heaven, and their ilk. Much better than the Old Foghorn '05. A fine, fine barleywine ale."
"Above average BW."
"Six years has added some sophistication and complexities that are a great surprise."
"The mouthfeel was textured with a moderate carbonation. On the palate notes of creme sherry, caramel/toffee, piney resin, and fig. It fades in a long finish of toasted brown sugar and grahm cracker with a subtle hop structure that looses some balance to the maltiness."
"This beer poured a hazy darkish amber color with a very small head. Aroma was very sweet smelling and winey. Taste was very sweet also with notes of syrup, wine and alcohol and some caramelly notes. Hop bitterness was subdued in the finish. This beer is way too sweet and tasted like extract was used in the brewing process. Drinkability is low due to the high alcohol and overwhelming sweet taste. I like English style barleywines, notably Old Nick and Hardys, but this one was a disappointment. Perhaps this brew requires a year or 2 of aging in order to round out."
"I really enjoyed slowly sipping this one and would purchase again."
"D - Good drinkability. I like E.B.W.'s and this was a good one. Well done. Thanks to Maltygoodness and BIF Across America for this one. I am ready for BIFAA part 2!"
"Drinkability: Too big a beer for continuous consumption, but not bad at all. Packs a rich milieu of flavor, and goes down rather easy. Fairly well-balanced, and the alcohol doesn't really smack you across the face despite expectations. A winner in my book."
"12 Oz bottle provided by Thaichile."
"I could imagine drinking this on a cold fall day, or in the middle of winter after the driveway has been shoveled. What makes this stand out is that it is balanced better than many other Barley Wines, but this may be personal choice. Some may prefer certain flavors to stand out moreso than others."
"Dark maroon body, lack of a very large head. Alcohol and sweet fruits in the nose, small hoppiness, toffee. Taste is sweet and alcoholic, the two seem to define the beer. The lack of a huge hops presence easily identifies this one as English style. Not my favorite style of beer, but not a bad beer versus others in the style."
"Pours a brownish red. Very thin head,with no retention,and only a bit of lace. Smell sweet, molasses, suryp, and alchol dominate. Body is thick,and not much carbonation. Taste is sweet like the smell from start to finish. This beer is a little sweeter than the other barleywines I've tried. For me it's a bit to sweet to drink on a regular basis, but still a very good beer."
"D - a good apertif, in a small glass with a sweet molasses based dessert, like shoo-fly pie."
"-Oelergud"
"I say this ale is perfect for Shakespeare, Christmas, Dickens, and Monty Python."
"Very rich and vibrant aroma, which hints of brandy soaked malts and loads of fruits, cherries, grapes, along with wine, caramel anc chocolate. Just a great, refined malt aroma. Perfect dark red color. Monstrous body, which seems to elevate all the juicy malt flavors. Doughy, pastry like malt flavors initially, which on the mid-palate transform into rich layers of vinous fruits, which hints of blueberries, plums, figs and cherries. On the finish, another complete transformation comes into play and toffee, caramel, vanilla and more vinous fruit flavors linger. Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wowwowwowowowowowow. What balance. One of the best barley wines Ive ever had and without a doubt, the best English barley wine ever."
"Overall, I'd say this is average for the style. I just wish it was balanced more evenly."
"Not my usual Barleywine but it was an interesting experience."
"I must say I really enjoy this barley wine. I am a wine lover first and this has some very tawny port similarities. Woodsy notes with molasses, maple syrup, choclate, and caramel in the mouth. One of the better noses on a brew I can remember. Would love to try it on draft."
"I've spoken poorly of weyerbacher before, but I take it back, or at least will give them another try after trying this beer. Although nothing overly original, a note for note, almost perfect example of a textbook english style barleywine. Very nice."
"I really liked the oak characteristics of this beer. The dryness just added to the dynamics and made this a hands down delicious beer."
"Im a Dirty Martini girl (absolute up, Extra dry, extra garbage incase any of you ever run into me and care to get me a drink lol) so the obvious alcohol flovors for me were welcome. I love a beer that I know can kick me in the rear if I dont treat it right. This is certainly not a beverage for the beginner. Really great representation of this style."
"Drinkability is good. I could easily bludgeon my brain with a few glasses of this one. It is not a lightweight. I could also imagine how this one earned its name when I consider the drinkability here. Not bad at all."
"One of the best Barley Wines out there. Strong alcohol and thinly sweet malts throughout. From the onset, gives the sensation of warming and lightly fusal, yet pleasant. Boldly sweet with syrup, molassas, and brown sugar. Hopped for balance and light bittering. Moderately thick and silky to the palate. Finishes with a light sweetness, light drying, and palate clensing bitterness. I will be drinking quite a bit more of these. It's certainly an Enlish Barley Wine with a subtle American twist."
"Rich full mouth feel that coats the mouth. The flavors are complex and start syruppy sweet and ends with a little hop bitterness. Full bodied and strong with strong alcoholic backbone."
"Overall, very very drinkable. Two guests who drank with me had the same opinion."
"mouthfeel is nice and big. fun to gnaw on"
"Opaque mohogany color with a small amount of head that didn't last long. Aroma is of caramel, coffee, fruit, chocolate, and a hint of alcohol. Sweet caramel taste with some almods, raisins, toffee, and a little brown sugar. Well carbonated with a medium body. Pretty easy to drink for its strength, I had to pace myself with this one."
"Overall = I don't have much experience with Barley wines. This one isn't recommended and I'd never try it again as it's too overwhelming and there's many other extreme beers I'd chose over this."
"Overall, I'm glad that the variety pack comes with a couple of these. Not sure I'd buy a whole case unless I was expecting some company."
"This is my first barleywine and I'm impressed. This one made a fine dessert beer. Now I really want to try an American styled one."
"12 oz bottle, not dated, poured into a snifter. Pours a dark plum-brown with a finger of off-white head that quickly settles to a thin cap. Moderate amount of lacing on the glass. Nose is dark and alcoholic-laced fruit--cherry, fig, prune, some sweet brown sugar, no hops. Taste has a nice big malt backbone, highlighted with the same fruits from the nose, some caramel notes, a slight alcholic bite considering the ABV. This is definitely on the sweet side, just a slight hop bite, but the sweetness never becomes cloying. Full bodied with a low carbonation, this has a slightly syrupy mouthfeel. This is a pretty nice barleywine, packing a punch but easy to drink for the style, althought not nearly hoppy enough for this hophead."
"The aroma is more powerful than the flavor in this barleywine - perhaps a bit too vinous for my taste. Of course it is quite high in alcohol (as the not so subtle name might suggest) - I imagine it could smooth out quite a bit with time. Very much an intense, rich, malty beverage. Sip with caution..."
"This Weyerbacher offering is one of the better examples of an English barleywine that I've run across. I will never like malt-dominant versions of the style as much as I like balanced or (especially) hop-dominant versions, but I've had a good time with this one. It's solid all the way around. Thanks to blitheringidiot for the Blithering Idiot."
"Dark brown and purple-ish with a small head that fades to nothing. Nose is dark fruits like crazy, sweet caramel alcohol, and a faint balancing roasted nuttiness. Taste is packed full of purple fruits with an alcohol punch to the face. A few of these and I'll definitely be pacified. Overall mellow and full of various fruit. The bitterness is countered by thick grape sweetness. Low carbonation lends itself to the mellow sweetness. Drinkable, but you need to takes your time with this."
"Drinkable for a Barley Wine indeed. Especially on those cold Pennsylvania winter nights. Sit by the fireside with this one. You won't be disappointed."
"Cheers!"
"A little too sweet to enjoy more than one in a sitting."
"drinkability: for the style, quite"
"Deep orange, clear except for a few yeast flecks floating around. Short beige head composed of small bubbles that produced a bit off lace. Malt and alcohol dominate the aroma. It's also a bit vinous, with some prune character, which gives it a kind of rum raisin smell. Alcohol is apparent in the flavour from the start. Moderate bitterness with a big vinous, caramel malt taste. Some toffee and ripe fruit kick in mid-point, leading to a caramel sweet finish. Dry and slightly astringent, the texture is fair and the carbonation is on the light side. An interesting barleywine. If the alcohol wasn't quite so forward (read ""hot and solvent-like"" in the flavour and aroma), it would be a lot more enjoyable. I can't rate it down too far though, because the rest of the character is actually quite nice. Maybe some aging would do this some good."
"This beer looked thick almost like really cold country apple cider but darker. There debris floating throughout the beer with it being more concentrated at the bottom. Smell was sweet, fruity, yeasty and some alcohol aroma. Fruit aroma of dates. Taste was much like it smelled, but the alcohol got much stronger as the beer sat and also seemed to get sweeter as it sat which gave it a more complex dark fruit flavor. A mild fresh grass hop flavor was also present. Mouthfeel was really thick with low carbonation, but this is my first barley wine, so I don't know how it compares to others. I don't think I could drink more than one of these and still enjoy it."
"I'm not sure how ""drinkable"" this beer is, but it sure is good. Very well made English barleywine. It's more balanced between malt and hops, compared to American barleywines. Delicious, ass-kicking, and yummy. What a combination!"
"D - definilty not a session beer, A little of for its desired target."
"Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, very nice. Overall a very drinkable beer considering alcohol content- I'd get it again."
"Some beers are very hard to judge objectivley when you can't get out of your mind what you paid for it. This overall is not a bad BW, but in no way would I seek it out again."
"Side note: When I first saw the bottle, I thought the jester was giving me the finger! Upon closer inspection, I realized I was wrong."
"Pours a clear orange/brown/red, small white head forms, lots of lace and legs. Smell is alcohol, some citrus, acetone, some raisin and prune character. Taste is caramel, lots of alcohol, raisin and some chocolate. Mouthfeel is full bodied, medium carbonation, very hot going down. Extremely unbalanced in a not so good way, pretty rough on the senses."
" The taste is sweet and loaded with caramel malt and some fruits. There are a lot of sugars running around, and some light hops are felt at the back of the tongue. The mouthfeel is very lightly carbonated. Not as unrefined as the taste and nose. I give a low score for drinkability, only because I intend to age the rest of my bottles for at least a year."
"Very enjoyable."
"Notes: very STRONG beer, just watch out if you want to get more thn one"
"Deep ruby red amber, foamy tan head. Heavy malt nose, very nutty, rich caramel, dusty hops, sticky sweet. Modest carbonation, good body. Alcohol is there, sure, this is over 11% after all, but it doesnt get in the way. This is a smooth, malt driven barleywine, like a brown ale on steroids. Some toast, cocoa, and touch of pepper, Aftertaste of a brown ale. This drinks better fresh now than it ever has before. I think we have the larger capacity and the better boil of the new brew house to thank for that. This is a barleywine that I turn to several times a week. Good stufff."
"Boozy whiskey great aroma. Taste sharp whiskey and then mellowed by the barley. Very finishable. Fig date licorice chocolate malt essence and sharp sour plum soaked for a while. Wow, 11% warming. A 55 degree room temperature offering. Amber ruby colour."
"Thanks to Steelreign for the trade, I will pick up some of this again if I come across it."
"The first taste I notice is of course the sweet malt. Then comes the ethanol...not too assertive, but definately noticeable. Very light hints of tobacco are present, along with some of the banana and tree fruits that were also present in the nose. Notes of old leather and wood are present (in a good, earthy way). Finish with a perfect amount of hop bitterness on the tongue shadowed by a lingering dark sweetness. Excellent beer."
"The beer poured an amber or orange color, somewhat cloudy, with very little head. What head was there was not too thick and left quite quickly. The scent was citrus, sticky, fruity and somewhat harsh. The taste was the same, quite malty, somewhat hoppy and there was the taste of citrus and dark fruits. The alcohol does bite, so beware. Overall a nice flavor. Quite bold."
"A decent barleywine, though I'm not sure I'll try it again."
"reviewed 12-29-04 after being cellared for 9 months. Review taken from notes. Pour is of a cloudy amber to brown with a small head and lots of sediment, non-filtered ? Rich caramel malty nose with a hint of yeasty winey-ness. Syrupy sweet flavor with thick syrupy body. Finish is long and caramel like. Very warming beverage."
"Pours a dark brown almost black with a very thin off white head. The smell of hazelnut and fruit are present. With a deep sip and sniff i taste strong hazelnut and slight tast of almond. It has some smoke presents to it too. It does have a medium body to it. The finish is very citrus but not sweet at all. Just accents of it. No feel of alcohol until the finish and it is just for a split second. WOW! just looked at the abv. is is 11%. No signs of this. I will be drinking loads of this."
"Another terrific effort by Weyerbacher. The more I drink their beers, the more I like them. Quick story...I was buying 2 6-packs of the Idiot from Ronnie's. Ronnie doesn't have the widest isles in front of the micros and I was juggling one trying to pull the second off the shelf. Well, it turns out I was the Blithering Idiot by dropping the second 6-er and smashing it on the concrete floor. I only broke 3 of them, but that's when I realized what a great nose this beer has....and the color was a hazy amber, laying in a puddle. Although tempted to do a dog impression, I waited until I got home to drink. It didn't disappoint."
"Bottle: Poured a deep amber looking ale with a medium head that disappeared quickly. Aroma is quite sweet with some great malt also noticeable. Taste is very warming which is probably due to the high content of alcohol, which is not easily discernable. Quite sweet throughout with some caramel and light bitterness at the end. Overall, this is very pleasant stuff and looking forward to try the Insanity."
"A slightly hazy dark copper colored beer. Has asmall beige head. Has the standard alcohol laden aroma with hints of fruit and hops. Ther taste starts with a light hint of sweetness that quickly becomes a bitter coffee and tabacco character. The finish is a prickly combo from the burn of the alcohol and some hops."
"The appearance of this brew is about top notch. Very nice clear mahogony with a 1/4"" head that hangs around and provides good lacing. Aroma is heavy the fruit, with peaches, grapes, and a good whiff of alcohol. Actually reminds meof westy12 a bit, to be honest. The similarities don't end there, suprisingly!! Grape taste along with apple, pears - just alot of fruit. The malt is more of an afterthought to this onslaught of great hoppy fruit flavors!! This suprised the hell outta me. Mouthfeel is not to thick, with a light foamy ness that makes for a great drinkability. The best barleywine I've ever had...hands down."
"I am sampling a 12 oz bottle bought at the brewery. Pouring into a snifter at cellar temp. The beer pours a clear amber color with a tightly packed creamy eggshell white head. The head fades quickly to an edge layer. ARoma is caramel and red grapes mixing with mild piney hops and a hint of ripe pears. Overall I dig the nose. First sip reveals gentle rolling carbonation with a thick syrupy body that leaves a pleasant coating on my tongue. Flavor is malty sweet with toffee, pears and maple syrup, some caramel and general fruitiness as well. A fairly sweet barleywine that I enjoy. It is very easy and smooth to drink."
"I am typically a big fan of Weyerbacher brews, but this one is just not wowing me...I'll let the other age and try it in a year or two."
"Pouring into a tulip glass at room temp, it pours a cherry color w/ 1/2 inch of white, frothy that dissipates to a slight surface layer and a difinitive edge layer. Aroma is mainly of berries and alcohol. Slight carmelized malts found also, but not overly complex. Great aroma however! Taste is cherries on the sip and a feel of smooth vanilla. Full bodied, some sweet chocolate if found on the finish. Carbonation is minimal, but the alcohol whacks ya good on the finish along with the chocolate taste. makes for a slightly dry experience. I'd really like to age this one a year or two to get more out of it. Great brew!"
"Drinkability  the alcohol doesnt overwhelm; light warming close; pleasant"
"insanity is the essentially the same beer with more flavor, and its worth the money. wont be buying this again, but ill have one if you give it to me."
"Pours an orangey copper color with a quick-fading off-white head. A fair amount of fruity esters ranging from melon to fresh fig to plum. Lightly biscuity malt profile, fusel alcohols are at a moderate level. Some flowery hops. Delicately carbonated. Initially sweet on the palate, it has an odd scorchy flavor (like raisins sautéed in rum) in the middle and finishes a little dry from the alcohol burn at the end. Certainly not a bad barleywine, just not my favorite. I seem to recall liking this a bit more when it first came out."
"Im making it a barleywine evening tonight. Next on the list is Blithering Idiot, picked up in MD while I was on the East Coast for the holidays. When I crack the bottle my nose is greeted by rum like notes of alcohol. The body of this beer is visually dense and hazy and a garnet/ruby brown. A hearty eggshell head forms upon pouring but receds to a thin frosting on top with a crusting around the outer rim of the pint. Taking a whiff of this beer I get the impression that this is more of an English style barleywine than American. Some hoppiness is in the nose, but it is dominated by rum-soaked raisons, and a vinous aroma. The English Orientation of this beer is confirmed upon tasting, tell-tale flavors of rum-soaked fruit, and grape-skin alongside the typical malt flavors of toffee and caramel . Bitterness levels are solid for the style, the hop flavors are a bit more subtle though I do pick up on some levels of piney and grapefruit hop flavors. The mouthfeel is great, perfectly coating. A great barleywine, which I think will come together even more with age. Im anxious to try the oak-aged version now."
"Lemon and orangey citrus zests provide a nice tartness to counter the malty sweetness. Warming golden rum-like alcohol bathes the throat and beyond. A peppery spiciness is noticed throughout, but more so in the finish."
"I had about five in two hours. Great flavor makes this beer deadly drinkable. My favorite of the barleywines i've had so far."
"I've seen this one many times and finally picked one up. Pours an amber color with a very small head that dies off quickly and doesn't leave much lacing on the glass. The aroma is sweet from dark fruits and a hint of alcohol. The flavor gets most of its character from the dark fruits, but there is a lot of alcohol in there. It could use a little more aging (at least the one I had). Good beer, but the drinkability suffers from the unmasked alcohol."
"This beer has a lot of potential, and I feel that with a little tinkering, it could be great. Of course, that may just be the Insanity I had a couple days ago talking."
"This beer pours a nice ruby color with a small head that rings the beer. The nose is dark fruit and sweet cherry. Very rich and full. The flavor is a blast of alcohol up front, mellowing out to be a bit of fig. This beer is a bit hot. The feel is thick, almost a bit syrupy. Drinkability suffers from the alcohol on the beer. After having the Insanity, this is much less mellow than the aged version. Not a bad beer at all, but the Insanity is much better."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"--I urge any lovers of barleywine to pursue this one. Buy a whole case (about $35-40 in PA) and cellar them. Drink a few every winter and enjoy with patience. This bottle was nearly 6 years old was the best I've had. I would say it's at it's peak, but could still go a few years too. Cheers!"
"This offering poured with a light brown body that could be considered as having a slight tint of orange. The head is not much more than a thin layer of film on top, and even that disappears fairly quickly. The nose is intriguing and tempting; caramel, clove, and a candy sweet aroma perk the senses. The taste has a quite a few intermingling flavors. I'd say the overall tone is set by a brandy-like quality, but it is surrounded by licorice and caramel notes. The mouthfeel is certainly full bodied but very smooth. My favorite part of the beer is the finish. All those pronounced flavors transform into almost a full cocoa feel and for a split second its almost like you're drinking some chocolate milk. Love that! Everything is tied up nicely with a small amount of bitterness at the very end. Love this barleywine, highly recommended!"
"This beer pours a VERY murky and dirty looking light brown, tough to see through. Smells like wine, very alcoholic and fruity with some noticable sweet malts. Something about this taste definately says English style, rather than American barley wine. Very sweet and complex with lots of flavors... brandy, dried fruits. Definate alcohol taste. I know a lot of people frown upon this in beers but I don't really find anything wrong with alcohol taste in an alcoholic beverage, it only makes sense. This beer could use more of a hop kick, that would make it great. As of now it's just passing as good. Smooth and sticky in the mouth. Not as drinkable because of the ABV and alcoholic taste, but a fine ""put me to bed on a slow Thursday"" beer. Night night folks."
"Ruby brown body, no head, decent carbonation. Cinnamon and spice smell, but very faint. Flavor is malty up front with a red wine finish, a little caramel in the middle. Drinkability is average. The red wine charactoristics are interesting, have yet to experience that flavor in a barleywine berfore."
"The aroma is much like a red wine with a fruity background. There are small amounts of alcohol in the smell as well. The taste is at first, like wine and fairly fruity. There is a bit of apple spice and a mild alcoholic taste as well. The label did not give an abv %, but you could definitely tell it was there."
"Pours a hazy medium copper with a quickly fading light tan head. Sweet candy and spice dominate this rich smelling beer. Very inviting. Malty sweetness quite strong also. Lots of malt and spice control the palate. Surprisingly light finish. Mouthfeel is not as thick as I was expecting. Somewhat disappointing. Wish this was thicker and richer than it is. Smelled like it would be much more flavorful. No need to try this one."
"Deep amber, clear with a rather generous head, off-white and with decent lacing, but dissipating after a couple of seconds. Mostly malty sweet nose, but not as rich as most barley wines Ive had. It consists mainly of brown sugar and vinous fruits (plums, grapes) with notes of vanilla and an obvious if not overwhelming alcohol presence. Thin-Medium bodied, quite smooth, with a tad more carbonation than usual in the style, but somehow, there are peaks where it seems a little boring, too easy going and just not particularly captivating."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" light tan head above a murky, orangey-amber brew. Head is not particularly long-lasting, and lacing is minimal, but not so out of line with the style. Aroma is of sweet malt and strong alcohol notes. Taste is all about the sweet malts, with strong alcohol at the outset. However, even the strong alcohol notes in this case aren't overpowering, even for such a high abv. Mouthfeel and drinkability are good for the style. Worth a try for a barleywine, the English interpretation gives a more approachable product in this case."
"I'm just not feelin' it with many of these American barley wines. I definitely like the more delicate and understated English versions better. And I know this is classified as ""English"" style, but it's not like the ones that I've had. This pours a nice maroon color with a thin wispy head, and it smells incredibly vinous and fruity -- almost like raspberry wine. The taste just whacks you over the head with a fruitiness that I just don't like. It's sweet and juicy, and the actual malt sweetness seems lost. The hops are strong, no doubt, and hit your palate on the way down, leaving more bitterness than flavor. Drinkability suffers, even as a sipping beverage. Maybe this is better in the bottles, and maybe it needs to be at room temperature, but this just isn't for me."
"Mouthfeel is good with a nice full body and good consistency. Drinkability is good as well, but after a few of these you'll end up looking like the joker on the label. I think this one could've used some more time in the cellar...but it's good fresh if you're looking for a hoppier taste. Check this one out if you like barleywines. Thanks to, ironically enough, blitheringidiot himself for the chance to partake."
"Opaque burnt orange color with chunklets suspended. Thick and fine beige head rises up a full inch and sinks every so slowly. Aroma rises up from the glass before I'm even done pouring. It's thick and rich and sweet, smelling of rich malts and honey, plus pear and apple. Very inviting. Mouthfeel is a little watery, but gives way to a wallop of pungent flavor. Pine and citrus with sweet malts and fruit riding beneath. Finish is an alochol burn followed by a lingering tingle. That full 11% makes itself known, and probably hides many other interesting flavors that would normally surface."
"A great example of barleywine for those who've never had one before. Poors a very deep, rusty color with hardly any head. The nose is fruity and sweet with a hint of toffee but smells mainly of liquor, which is definitly acceptable consider the alcohol content. The taste is out of this world. Ridiculously complex with tastes of prunes, raisens, toffee, caramel and so much more. Incredibly smooth for how potent it is. The mouthfeel is very thick and syrupy but not at all in a bad way. And as for the drinkability, I could drink this all day. A sipping beer that will get you tanked. :-) Enjoy."
"What an appropriate name for a barley wine, definitely fits the description of my disposition after too much of the style. This pours out a deep amber color with a tall off white head that quickly collapses to a covering of foam and bubbles. The aroma is filled with the scent of sweet ripe fruit joined by a sharp but not overpowering scent of alcohol. Sweet malts greet the tongue first with fruit flavors and molasses. The finish is a bit tongue numbing with alcohol and slightly sweet. Mouthfeel is full and syrupy will sufficient carbonation. This takes a hit on drinkability from the alcohol taste that numbs my tongue, I dare not have another one or I might not be able to feel my tongue at all. Fresh I dont care too much for it but I will have to age a bottle of this and see how it turns out. If the alcohol mellows this could turn into something much better."
"Pours a dark copper with little to no head. Smell is fairly sweet and malty with notes. Toffee and liquor soaked dark fruits are also on the nose. Taste is a bit thin for something this potent. Rich malt and toffee, with more brandied fruits on the tongue. Alcohol is disguised well. Mouthfeel is a bit sticky however with almost a cotton candy type feeling. Drinkability isnt bad, however I can think of several other barleywines I would rather have a go at."
"I like this....very easy drinking for the ABV..deliciously sweet...earthy...very nice...best of the Weyerbachers I've had..."
"Not a bad barley wine, but not something i would make a habit of buying."
"Definitely a brew with great cellar potential - it's nice to have one now, to see a fresh sample, but I'll be waiting until winter before reaching for the next one in the 6pack, and I'm looking forward to it already."
"This was one of the guest taps at 5 Seasons in Atlanta for the July 1 celebration (yay bigger beer!) A very nice barleywine and one that I think is better for the style than the wimpy for style Old Heathen. This is on the dark side of the brown specturm wiht an ok head. Its got that big barleywine fruitiness in the aroma backed up with a healthy does of sweet malt and leafy, grassy hops. The caramel-like malt is sweet, but not cloying and blends nicely with the dates and fig fruitiness."
"Note: I think this one needs some time to mature (at least I hope that's the explanation). I've set aside a few, and will review again at a later point."
"I liked this one a LOT."
"This barley wine is not one of my favorites. I have had it several times, but I decided to wait to review a bottle from last winter that has had time to sit. It is more mature but still not great. The appearance is a brown cloudy mix with a thin, tan head. The nose is very fruity, likes raisins and dates. The taste is pretty much raisins and dates. That is the only way I can describe this. The only other way is to say that it is like drinking a fig newton. The alcohol is strong. But it isn't very drinkable. Definitey a one-dimensional barley wine."
"Pours a nice reddish amber color with a thin head that dissipated very quickly. Very little carbonation present. Smell is kind of winey with dark fruit in the nose. Perhaps it would benefit from more aging, I found it to be too sweet. Hops are hardly present, leaning towards a big malty taste. Not a bad barleywine, but at the price of $15 for a 6 pack, I found it somewhat disappointing. Hard to drink more than one of these due to the sweetness which I found to be rather overbearing. Cheers!"
"Bought this as part of a mixed case from the brewery. This is definately a high power brew. Pours a clear brownish red with a thin light brown head. Smell is fruity malt and alcohol, but its not overpowering. Taste is like dark dried fruit with very sweet malt and very warm alcohol. Has just enough hops to balance the sweetness. Flavors are very ripe and agressive. Definately a sipping beer. I'd like to try this one with a little age."
"This has a big malty backbone with a faint plum flavor that quickly gives way to an astringent flavor that leaves a nice dry mouth and little after taste. Each sip is a little warming and although there is a little alcohol flavor, its not overpowering. But this could sit down in the cellar pretty well, and hopefully tame down some of the tannic qualities. Overall this isnt a bad barley wine by any means, not as complex as Ive had, but this is pretty green."
"Pours out a hazy orangish color and yeast floaties are in there as well and eventually settle at the bottom of the glass, a medium off white head almost tan and thins out. Aroma is of alcohol, raisons, alcohol, some weak malt, alcohol, figs, alcohol, a bit of spicey hops and did I mention the alcohol. Taste is pretty much the same alcohol and more alcohol and very little of all else. Very chewy and full bodied also cause of the noticeable alcohol there is a warming everytime you take a sip. This could with out a doubt sit in a dark corner for at least a year to develop into a less alcohol more flavorful beer, at least I believe with a year on the bench it can mellow out a little."
"Pours with a two-finger light brown head that fades very slowly and leaves a gobs of lace. Cloudy amber color. Good carbonation. Nose is alcohol; Starts with a good balance of malts and hops, finishes fairly smooth but the alcohol is there in the background. $2.75 for a 12oz bottle."
"The beer pours a dark amber color with a thin off-white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has an intense malty scent that seems to scream pale, crystal, and roasted malts. There is little hop aroma here. The taste is good. It has a rich, thick malt flavor that warms on the way down. It is very flavorful and smooth. There seems to be little hop qualities to it, but the malt complexity makes up for any lacking. The mouthfeel is good. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is as smooth a barleywine as I've had. It warms you up, but it also leaves behind a very good malt palate aftertaste. This drinks very well."
"Redish pour, slight head. Hops are pretty much just background noise. I only bought a single, the price being a little steep. A good barleywine, but not one that ""jumps"" out at you. More mild than wild, a good drinking beer, except for the ABV."
"Pours a deep ruby red color, and is topped by a creamy tan head. Smells of sticky malts with a bit of candy type sweetness to it. There is some alcohol in the nose as well as a bit of hop aromatics up front. This Barley Wine has a nice, thick, and creamy mouthfeel to it. This beer is sweetish but it has a nice balancing hop flavor that is subtle for an American, but it is pronounced enough that it is quite pleasing. The alcohol is not as evident in the taste, which is good. There is a bit of astringency in the finish, some fermentation by products (esters, higher alcohols, etc). These really don't take away from this beer though. This is a nice, easy drinking Barley Wine, that has a bunch of subtle competing flavors that keep this interesting."
"thanks to blitheringidiot for sending me this (along with a 750 of golden monkey)."
"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a medium ruby red color with two fingers of head. There is a little lacing left on the glass. The smell is very well balanced between sweet malt and juicy hops. There is a hint of alcohol in the smell as well. The taste starts malty, with some caramel and honey in there. The finish ends with snappy hops and a touch of ethanol. A fairly well balanced barley wine. The mouthfeel is very thick, yet smooth on the tongue. The drinkability is a little low, mainly due to the high alcohol. This beer can only get better with age."
"Thanks to beerluvr and pbrian for sending me some to sample and age."
"12oz bottle no Freshness date. Clear copper colored with a thick head that reduces to a thin film. Some lacing. Aroma of sweet malt, fresh barley, some fruit and noticable alcohol. Nice smooth full body. Flavor is malty and sweet with lots of fruit. Unfortunately alcohol adds an unpleasant tatse. Warm finish and overall a good Barley Wine. I just wish the alcohol were masked better. This is its only fault in my opinion."
"This could be a good beer if it is aged properly for a year or 2. It is a cloudy reddish brown. The aroma has a lot of fruit in the nose. It is complex but the alcohol takes control of your mouth. There is an excessive pepperiness to it. It definitley needs to mellow for some time and then maybe it will be more enjoyable."
"The flavor is a warm balance of alcohol, spices and a complex array of fruits. Parts of it have a taste I attribute to scotch. This beer remains beautifully uncarbonated and brings out the smooth, thick body of this beer. The complex flavors do a good job both hiding the high ABV and supporting the enjoyable moments of alcohol taste."
"Strong brew ...no doubt...coppery appearance with a nice head. Smell was malty with some definite fruity presence. Sweet initially..with a mid-taste kick in of alcohol...very wine-like at the finish. A definite sipper...high alcohol presence that wasn't mellowed affected drinkability and mouthfeel."
"I've always felt this was an average-tasting barleywine, having little of the hop complexity and fine malt of other British-styled barleywines (Old Horizontal, Millenium, etc.). Compared to the scions of the style, like J.W. Lees or Bigfoot, you can understand why I say average. The kind you can shut your brain off to its shallow but decent sweetness."
"A fine example of an American Style Barleywine."
"Somewhat hazy ruby in color with a thin, light tan head. Aroma is *very* sweet, with a bit of figgy fruitiness. Taste is nice -- malty sweet at the start, with a fruity flavor that seems almost tropical light, despite the dark tones suggested by the aroma. A bit of brown sugar and big spicy alcohol finish. Well hopped enough to avoid being cloying, with a nicely roasty aftertaste. A little harsh at first, but goes down nicely after the alcohol numbs the tastebuds a bit."
"Full bodied, a different kind of session beer, in that I could sip one, savoring it as it warms and grows in complexity. Two of these warming brews could make a nightime session. Half this sixer is going in my cellar. Weyerbacher just started showing up around here, and it's becoming a favorite brewer of mine."
"A fellow BA (John) treated me to one of these potent puppies at the Rochester BA gathering this past weekend, held at the intown MacGregor's Grill and Tap Room (see beerfly review). This was the perfect brew to cap off an evening of warm comraderie before we all headed out into the deep sub-zero chill of an upstate New York winter night. It poured a glistening deep amber with a thin white head, and as soon as I imbibed its powerful and sweet aroma, I knew I would be deliciously sipping this for a while. And I was right. The alcohol content is not equivocal, but it did not oppress the nutty malts and the floral esters. An hour later, I was still happily meandering my way through this barley wine, content to enjoy any excuse to hang out and talk beer (hence: high drinkability)."
"Update – I can’t believe that it’s been seven years since I last had this BW, but now that I’ve moved back to the Midwest I was able to find it in a local beer store. It’s a lot less sugary than I noted on my original review and I thought the alcohol was a bit more prominent but otherwise a terrific sipper."
"Pours a burgandy amber with a minimalist caramel colored head. Quickly recedes to a small ring around the edge of the chalice. Smells quite smoky and medicinal. The tatse is a big rush of leathery malt with a bit of that smoky afterhue. Definitely has some grape and unripened apple that borders on the cusp of an acidic twang. Ends quite medicinally with a hint of that alcohol half-masked by the malt. Not really balanced. Not really great. I have another that I'll let sit until next winter. Time can only help this one."
"Not my favorite, but it ain't tooo bad, but it is still has some way to go"
"Overall drinkability is I want another one but I know I shouldn't have one."
"The taste is sweet malty flavor with a fruity feel. The alcohol is quite noticable and could maybe be too present, it outweighs any other aspect of the brew. The mouthfeel isn;t very pleasant. A good beer to start the night out with as long as you plan on going all the way."
"The alcohol is not masked very well and that hurts the drinkability but the flavor is quite good. This doesn't top my list of barleywines (bigfoot, Avery Hog Heaven), but it's pretty tasty."
"Deep clear amber; nice head. Smell is malty, sweet, with hints of banana and blatantly obvious alcohol. Burnt flavor with plenty of alcohol, a bit sweet. Almost makes your tongue numb -- and certainly does the same to the rest of your body if you choose to have more than a couple."
"Drinkability: A less hoppy barleywine is a refreshing change."
"It has kind of a weird mouthfeel. You expected a really heavy, creamy texture, but I find it thin with not enough body. It is a very strong beer that reminds you of that from beginning to end. I find this maybe the weakest effort from the brewer of what I've tried. It could be a beer before its time since the carbonation was so low."
"Looking back it was definitely worth the money. I should be able to find it cheaper around here in South Jersey. The brewery is only 1.5 hours away."
"Big thanks to TwelveVoltMan for the bottle!"
"I'd surely like to try it again, and thank jcalbi for my first taste!"
"Thanks to TwelveVoltMan for this one."
"Color is very opaque chestnut brown, dark with barely a glow, fluffy finger high head of light tan hue which slowly fades down to a thin haze on top and a thick sticky ring around the edge, lace is in thin sheets. Aroma is mostly dark and fruity with plum, raisin, melon, banana, starfruit and toffee. Slight alcoholic note. Taste follows suit with slight dark fruit senses of raisin, plum, and a touch of banana, malts are chewy in the toffee with slight dark caramel. Quite smooth and creamy all the way through with some nicely done, slight piney and dried hop bitterness that enters in very subtle just after the midway point and gains some depth into the finish with some added malty thick depth as well. Feel is medium bodied, smooth and creamy with a couple hollow areas, some uneven texured velevtyness and not quite as hefty or strongly flavored as I like. The alcohol in this starts to hit pretty quick though so its a major sipper, and a good one at that. Aging this may help, we will see as I acquired a few bottles from Pabobcat; whom I thank greatly for the bottles!"
"Had this on tap at the Spring House Drafting Room,poured a medium brown with some amber tones with a light but somewhat creamy head,aroma was of burnt fruit and alcohol.Taste was very rasiny and of dried fruit definently sweet and chewy and gets better as it warms.A pretty nice brew I think the best I have had from Weyerbacher."
"This is a solid barleywine, though the fact that it's pretty moderate in all aspects of its barelywine-ness, leaves me with little impression besides that it's less than impressive."
"Awesome stuff, and worth the $12 I paid for a sixer. What a great name for a beer. I'd like this much more if the alcohol was toned down a bit, and not turned all the way up to 11."
"It's hard to make a dreadful barleywine (though perhaps I've just not tried enough of them!). This is a solid and respectable example of the style."
"Taste: it's a nice, simple straightforward (if there is such a thing) barleywine. It has a nice flavor, but it doesn't try to be over the top. It was enjoyable"
"Carbonation gives a little bite at first, and it then dies to make the mouthfeel smooth and rich. Very sweet flavors of fruits and caramel. There is some bitterness, but well below the level I would expect. The body is all there, just a little bit below what I would call full. The flavor is big, but just unproportioned with a lot of sweets. It is a nice drinkable brew, but I want a barley wine to punch me in the face with aroma and flavor. I guess, in the end, it is a good beer, but could use some work as far as being a barley-wine."
"This brew is dark amber with a medium thick off-white head. Thin lacing in patches all the way down the side of the glass. Strong caramel aroma with a little fruit. Rich body, with a lot of caramel and malt in the flavor. It is pretty hard to hide that high an ABV, but this beer does a pretty good job. The alcohol flavor is not very strong. The alcohol is sweet up front and gets progressively more spicey throughout. This is a very good beer."
"As I discovered when trying the beer again, it was totally unbalanced. The word best used to describe it would be raw. I have a couple that I am going to age and see if anything turns out different."
"This year's batch, so I'm probably sampling this too young, but I can't resist any longer. More mellow than I expected under the circumstances. Fruity esters riding on bright caramel malt flavors. A bit sweet at the front, but the hops and alcohol flavors collide at the finish in an effort at reigning the sweetness in. Quite smooth, a very nice nightcap."
"-F"
"Carbonation? I think not! The pour was reminiscent of mud, or dirty dirty thick water at the least. That is to say it looked nice. No head due to the extreme lack of carbonation. Wonderful aroma of dark fruits and candy. Candy-like sweetness in the flavor as well...very malty, chocolate, cherry...and a mildly hoppy finish balances this brew out well. The 11% abv is nearly hidden completely. Alcohol is only slightly detectable in the flavor. Great, smooth mouthfeel with a dry finish. A sweet, candylike treat of a barleywine."
"All in all, the Blithering Idiot was fair, but nothing much to write home about. Perhaps it could mature into something good, but at this point, I probably wouldn't have another."
"Brilliant copper color topped by a tan head, an impressive head for a barleywine. Wonderful malty aroma, sweet and beautiful. Very sweet taste, thick caramel, strong dark fruits. Finished off by a nice hoppiness. This is an exceptional fresh barleywine. The mouthfeel is thick as expected, but it is also creamy, with the carbonation lightening the load on the tongue and sweeping away the sweetness on the finish. The drinkability is good, good enough to turn you into a blithering idiot in short order. I am impressed by this beer."
"This beer poured a nice dark red amber color and formed a huge foamy off white head that left circular lace as it subsided. Some carbonation is present. An aroma of malt, caramel and grapes with a slight wine aspect to it. A flavor of malt, caramel and chocolate. A warming aspect of the alcohol present is apparent in the medium body smooth finish. This beer could use some aging, but is not a bad barley wine."
"Cheers to the BA Victory Beer Exchange for the sample!"
"2002 Vintage (Not sure if they track vintages). A bit of a reddish color. Pours with no head. Had this sitting for a couple of months in my basement befor I chilled it and tasted it. It could have aged some more, as it was a bit harsh. Very fruity, a bit of alchohol in the nose and the taste. Didn't do it for me. I let it sit for a few more months before I chill a second. Re-rate: Let the bottle sit about 7 months after purchase. It has mellowed immensly. It is much better now! The nose actually has a hint of scotch to it. It has become a very good barley wine!"
"Pours an impressive deep mahogany tone complemented by a very thin cream toned head. Very deep color, musky almost opaque, I would dare to say this one is unfiltered. In the aroma I am getting burst of brown sugar along with a rediculous amount of malt followed by plums, raisins, and other pleasant fruit tones. The taste is one huge malty plum brany like flavor, a wonderful malt monster that brings joy with it's full but not overly sweet profile. As it warms the sweetness becomes a little more domineering. Big robust mouthfeel, beefy if you will provides a creamy texture in this one full bodied beer. Drinkability well this beer is desireable for me again in the future, but coudn't handle more than two of these in a week I consider this a great representation of a barleywine, but I prefer more hops."
"Gets smoother and smoother with time. Less alcohol, less sweet. Increasing drinkability from 3.5 to 4.0."
"This beer pours a slightly hazy medium dark brownish red color with a smallish off white head. The mouthfeel is resinous and oily. The smell is cookie like and piney. The taste is syrupy sweetness, piney-resiny to a peppery alcohol warmness. This is a pleasant relatively mild drinkable barleywine. I think it would be a good introduction point for people new to the style."
"(source: PremierGourmet; Buffalo, NY)"
"Summary: A good sweet barleywine that is very drinkable. Hops are not very noticeable like in other barleywines. I hope I can get my hands on another bottle someday soon!"
"479"
"beer....wine....beer.....wine....when you can't decide have some of this!! Pours a nice garnet color. First smell is of a fruity wine. I think someone spiked my beer! Very nice taste. The alcohol smell is somewhat deceiving. It is very smooth and easy to drink. I think the name is perfect as you can easily put a few of these down and become a ""blithering idiot""."
"A very tasty brew, well worth seeking out, but judging by some of the other reviews it is best to age for a year or two before drinking."
"Pours a short lived tan head over a light yeast hazed garnet colored, gently carbonated liquid. Nose is a heady mixture of brown sugar, bananas, dark fruit, sugary-sweet malt. Taste is first malty with roasted toasted grain dryness, some malt sweetness and a good dose of hoppiness to help balance the boat. Not nearly as heavy bodied/cloying as one might expect from a beer of such majestic gravity. Finishes up bittersweet, with the alcohol coming thru loud & clear! A very powerful ale, treat with respect! Also it's a great choice for cellaring."
"In the glass it had a dark copper/ ruby color.  It had a nice head of foam, but it did not last. Good carbonation.   The aroma was intising, it reflected hints of nuts, spices, whiskey (like Jack D).  The taste reflected the aroma with flavors hazelnut, cinnamon, oak (which would explain the J.D. refrence), and slight fruit.   The one thing I noticed as the brew gained temp. the fruit became more pronounced.  Pleasant surprise."
"The pour a very dark brown, nice light chocolate head that dissipates quickly, leaving a fair to midlin lace. Nose a over ripe Banana, joined by the malts. Start is malt sweet, the middle creamy and a medium body, the finish dry, somewhat tart, pleasantly hopped, benignly acidic. Quite good and well worth a sample."
"Clear deep amber/ruby color. No head or lace to speak of. Ripe cherry, apple and apricot aroma. Candy sweet initial flavor is abruptly interupted by a syrupy alcohol flavor. Warms the throat and belly. Sticky, big and malty. Some raisins emerge as it warms. Hops poke through momentarily, but are quickly canceled out. A nice sipper for the late innings of game 2 of the 2002 World Series. I'm pulling for the Angels, they've got a good, young, hard working club. Play ball (and drink beer)! Cheers."
"Deep garnet / light brown hue w/ excellent clarity.  Tan head recedes into a thin, dense layer than manages spotty lace.  Assertive yeast esters comprised of ripe plum, figs and banana upfront in aroma, ensued by dark, sugary, treacle sweetness, butterscotch and light biscuit malt.  Not unlike a buttery fruitcake aromawise.  One dimensional caramel malt sweetness is perceived first, then widens into a combination of notes of roasted nuts and caramelized fruit sweetness that is somewhat datelike.  Mellow diacetyl persists as a constant undertone.  Moderate hop bitterness then offsets the strong malt sweetness well enough to prevent it from becoming cloying, but the overall character abounds in sweetness.  Subdued earthy Fuggles hop flavor.  Moderately bodied and agreeablely smooth in mouthfeel.  Finishes w/ a bittersweet combination of honey and hop bitters quickly fading.  Blithering Idiot is a tasty barleywine, but its sweetness is a touch overbearing, and perhaps masked any inherent nuances.  Nonetheless, it's an enjoyable brew."
"Aroma was ripe fruit & alcohol - sweet apple, figs, plums, and fumes of alcohol.  Started out with a big fruity malt assault - the same three as above, with caramel & toffee-like sweetness joining the fray. Somewhere way in the background a hop raised its hand for recognition by the chairman, but it was never recognized by the floor so it left the meeting with reserved bitterness. The alcohol remained well in check until it hit mid sip and bellowed loudly but briefly. The finish was sweet, sugary, alcoholic, but not at all cloying, with a lingering toffee apple aftertaste. Hugely drinkable for its potency after aging."
"Nice dark copper color with a good head that fades fast.  Good carbonation. Nuts and whiskey like flavors dominate the nose.   Lots of flavor entice the taste buds, but I could only identify a few easily (hazelnuts, slight cinamon, wood).    Fruit flavors really start to come out as the beer approaches room temperature. Alcohol has a nice warming quality and adds to the mouthfeel but not does not dominate the flavor profile.  Overall a nice and interesting barley wine."
"Pours a reddish  copper color, with a tan head. On the nose huge, sweet aromas of raisons, figs, brown sugar, and of course alcohol. On the palate the aromas can be tasted, figs, alcohol, spice, sweetness, caramel, and dark fruit. There is a warming in the gut. I think the alcohol is a bit out of control on this oneits possible I need to let one age. Overall not bad for a style that I dont care for much."
"Pours a slightly hazy ruby/amber with a nice looking creamy tan head that faded to a nice lasting film on top of the brew.  Nice creamy malt aromas are accompanied by some spicy alcohol smelss as well.  Sweet caramel maltiness is mixed well with some subtle fruity flavors and nice vinous qualities.  The brew gets a little woody towards the end before the spicy alcohol picks up the flavor.  The alcohol is rather subtle but provides some nice background flavor as more grape/raisin flavors finish the brew.  The brew is smooth but a little thinner than I like a BW to be.  For the alcohol content this is one damn drinkable brew.  I was pleasantly surprised when drinking this one.  The reviews up until recently had not been very good but I definintely liked this on."
"Even older bottles of this seem to pour hazy. I'm not sure of the year since they don't mark them, but this is the older label (burgundy w/ gold letters... just letters, no jester) so it must be at least a year old, maybe two. It's aged well; no defects. The color has a nice organge cast to it and the aroma is pretty bold. Very full, sweet, caramelish malt. No hops in the aroma, but that's expected for an English-style barleywine. The flavor, however, is much more restrained than the malt suggests. Alot of drinkers view this in a negative light, but I feel it's perfectly acceptable. It's not as malty or hoppy as most American versions, but keep in mind that this is based on British barleywines, many of which are more along these lines. The flavor that is here is very well balanced, and very drinkable, rounding up the usual suspects: malty, toffee, brown sugar, dark fruits, alcohol. Not alot of hop flavor or bitterness, but just enough to balance very well. I think this is also a beer best served English-style - at a cellar temperature of 50 - 55 F - as more of its character is revealed. A bit of an underdog in the barleywine race, but still an excellent beer!"
"Thanks to Davo for the sample. (The tides are turning in favor of Weyerbacher.)"
"Based on reading the other reviews, I'm inclined to believe that I've drawn a bad six-pack.  The bottles pour like wet trub rather than beer....nearly saturated with yeast and, I believe, flecks of hop petals.  Zero head and zero carbonation.  Smells intensely of alcohol.  Tastes of syrupy sweet malt and yeast.  Alcohol presence is dominating.  The bottles I bought are irrevocably flawed.  However, I'd be willing to try this beer again in the hopes that this was a one-time quality control oversight."
"Sweet mother of pearl, this is a sweet beer (and by sweet, I mean sweet). Ruby brown color, with almost no appreciable head. Smells and tastes of brown sugar, dates, figs, prunes, and alcohol. Strong alcohol finish. Reminds me somewhat of a less refined version of some of the better English barley wines (Thomas Hardy's Ale, for instance). Not bad, though not a beer you can drink more than one of, for sure."
"Upon further research and palate refinement I have to downgrade this beer. Six months in the cellar and a steady diet of Victory and Sierra Nevada barleywines lessened my enthusiasm for Blithering Idiot. Way too sweet and lacking the complexity of the best of the style."
"So-so for a barleywine, but nevertheless, it is still a quality beer.  I would consider it a barleywine that is not quite ready to drink, but could be good in time."
"Notes: Not aged enough to quell the huge alcohol character, hops are lost. Alcohol seems a bit out of control. This is still a fun beer to drink and it shows you that it is a strong brew without a doubt. If you have a bottle of this don’t drink it yet, wait another year or so."
"A darn good barley-wine.  I would be head-over-heels for this if I had never tasted Smuttynose Barley-Wine, but this ale can hold its own.  Perhaps a little too fruity, to be picky.  You should drink this ale in a comfortable chair - as you certainly won't be going anywhere soon."
