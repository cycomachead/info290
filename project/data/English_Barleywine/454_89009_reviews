"I have no idea what this beer was like fresh. I only scored one bottle and I sat on it a couple years before drinking it. I was very impressed, though the feel was a bit thin for my liking and after two years it still provided a good blast of alcohol burn on the finish. Bourbon barrel aging is perfect for an English barleywine and this one shows all the wonderful qualities you'd look for. I rate this one slightly above Insanity, yet far, far behind Sucaba and BCBW. If I ever got another bottle, I'd age it a little bit longer before drinking (3 years minimum)."

"Aged very well."

"Overall - Really impressive. Kinda simple, but there's no excess sugar and it isn't too boozy."

"O - This barley wine absorbs a lot of bourbon characteristics. It is sweet but not overtly so. It is an enjoyable tasting experience."

"Bottle from trade. Looks like it says 2012 on the bottle, poured 4/1/14. Pours murky brown with a bit of purple and red, and a small creamy yellowish brown head. Smells like vanilla, caramel, marshmallow, toffee, fig, bourbon. Beautiful. Flavor is gifs and bourbon, a blast of vanilla on the finish, slight oxidization but not bad. Mouthfeel starts rich and thick, but with very low carbonation that seems to make this feel a little thin. Some more carb would help the mouthfeel. Very nice beer that I would like to try fresh."

"Tastes more of the same. This stands out as one my all time favorite barleywine experiences. Very malt forward, with no real hop presence, which is expected of the style. The booze is covered up very nicely. Cereal Killer is my go to barleywine and the bourbon takes it to the next level. Can't for them to brew some more. Highly recommend."

"Sip on this and then hit the gym, my children. Y'all getting fat."
"Nothing really notable going on here, a rather routinely pretty good barrel-aged barleywine, if such a beast exists this side of the river Styx."

"O: I was searching this one out for awhile, and I wasn't disapointed. Yes, the mouthfeel could be fuller, and it is a barrel forward beer, which I don't mind, but I find it complex enough. It's doing all the right things for the style, so I don't really agree with some of the BA reviewers on this one. But to each his own. On that note, seek this one out if you think you can dig it. Looking forward to BA Shipwreck!"

"12 ounce wax capped bottle, 12/18/12 stamped on the bottle. Served in a DFH snifter, the beer pours a dark reddish/mahogany brown color with about a quarter inch tan head that didn't stay around for too long. There's also a small amount of lacing. The aroma is rich and malty, the brew smells like bourbon, caramel, brown sugar, toffee, oak, and a bit of booze. Taste is similar to the aroma, but with the addition of some molasses and raisins. There's also a surprising amount of bitterness in this brew, although the sweet malty flavors are stronger. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's slick and easy enough to drink for a 12% ABV brew. Moderate carbonation. I thought this was a good brew, hopefully I can pick up another bottle in the future. $7.99 a bottle."

"O: Not as baller rich and complex as some, but definitely better than most. Thanks again, jbck109."

"I have read several other reviews that comment on strong alcohol qualities. Mine sat in my ""cellar"" aka dark closet for 4 months. This must have taken the edge off as I could not be more impressed with with the smoothness and ease."

"M: Big medium to full."

"o - Overall I had high hopes for this one, especially after smelling it, but the taste just has too much alcohol up front at the moment. It gets considerably better as it warms up, but it is very strong. It's a little overcarbonated but the nose is great. I'd rank this slightly behind the BA stout, and way behind the BA porter, though I could see this being much better with more time on it. Will hold onto my other bottle for a while, at least a year."
"O- Something is off, but it has the potential. It just falls flat. Did not get much bourbon presence as I had hoped, but was happy with that because I found what taste to be strange. It was just too dry for my liking and had a strange after taste. Maybe I had a bad bottle, but I was not impressed. Maybe I'll try it again because it is reasonably priced."
"B"
"Good but not exceptional. For the most part the alcohol feels like that of a much stronger beer, 15-18% would have been my expectation. I'd have to try another regular Cereal Killer to get an accurate idea of what the barrel is really adding here, but it isn't anything super obvious. A little more body a less alcohol would make a big improvement in my perception of this beer."

"O - I don't get this one.. but I'm not confused as to why others enjoyed this. I would like to revisit at some point, but not holding my breath for it. Still, I'm glad I tried it."

"o - home run. slam dunk. really wonderful BA barleywine. if anything, maybe a bit on the heavy side, but it comes in a 12oz serving :)"
"This is ok. It isnt great, but it wasnt a drainpour. Worth trying but not trading for."
""
"Overall a good beer, not great, and I'm not sure worth $8 for a 12oz."

"Overall I thought this was a good beer and a good example of the style, it had almost all the aspects that I expect from the style with lots of malt, bourbon Barrel and warming alcohol and it's a great beer for a cold winter night like tonight. This beer had ok drinkability, it was fairly smooth and the flavors held my attention, but the high amount of sweetness and warming alcohol would prevent me from having another, one 12oz bottle is the perfect amount and it's a great format for this beer. What I liked the most about this beer was the aroma and the balance in the taste, they were both pretty good and worked well with this beer. What I liked the least about this beer was the mouthfeel, it wasn't bad, but the body was just too thin for the style and it needs to be thicker and chewier. I would buy this beer again, if they choose to release it again, it's already gone in my area for the year, but I made sure to grab two extra bottles to throw in the cellar and I will be interested to see how it ages and I'll try and update this review, but the price is on the steep side, if it was anymore than $7.49 I don't think I would buy it, but I would recommend this to anyone who likes bourbon barrel aged beers. All in all I was happy with this beer, it didn't blow my mind and I think I like the Barrel aged Shipwreck Porter a little more, but this was still a good beer that I enjoyed drinking and it was a nice sipper and it's a good cold night treat. Good job Arcadia, thanks for bottling this beer, it's nice to have a tasty barrel aged Barleywine while I wait for the next release of Shipwreck Porter, I think 22 months is the perfect amount of time for this beer to sit in the barrel and it's worth the wait, keep up the good work guys.. 2014 EDIT, just tried one from my cellar that's year old, it got very smooth, almost as smooth as the three year old special edition, the bourbon barrel is toned down a little but it still comes through with some great toffee, caramel, and dark fruit flavors, It aged well and I like that it's smoother, but I think I prefer the fresh bottle since the barrel aspect was more apparent. still got one left that I might wait a year to try."

"Pours a hazy dark brown with a foamy tan head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, brown sugar, caramel, bourbon, and wood. Taste is much the same with an alcohol kick on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty but has a better smell in my opinion."

"O- just like thier barrel aged stout, this beer is very good, just not worth 8 $ I payed for it"
""
"Overall a very well balanced barleywine. Surprisingly not very boozy for being aged 22 months like it's imperial stout counterpart."
