"This is a very unique brew.  Pours to a deep mahogany brown body.  Head is biscuity khaki in color.  The nose is very odd but attractive.  The first thought that comes to mind is a fresh opened box of cheese-it crackers.  I know this sounds off putting but it is very inviting and really makes you anticipate the first sip.  The flavor is big and bold with tons of cracker like toasted grain tones.  The hops that are usually so prevalent in a Barley wine ale play only as a balancer here.  Rich and spicy on the palate and it reminds me a bit of a old ale.  I had this beer on my wants list for a long time.  It was a real pleasure to enjoy this spectacular brew."
"O:  Very nice barleywine. Maybe one day I will get a chance to try MOAS, but this was a solid brew."

"O: great. Big. Barleywine. Solid. Strong. It's a sipper. Will buy again."
"There may not be enough deprivation in our lives to properly enjoy this properly. Imagine the old sods slogging down the muddy lane to the drafty pub who would have thanked God for this one while the smell of damp woolens wafted from the smoky fireplace. From the 22 oz bottle"

"O - I am a big fan of English style barley wines. This one could have used a little more integration of the flavors. It was good to try but will not be repeated."
"An extremely well done English Barleywine. It's been a long time sense I've visited this one and it definitely motivates me to pick up a few more bottles."
"Overall this is a bold and extremely flavorful sipper. Meant to be enjoyed at a slow pace and in moderation. This is one hell of a beer!!"
"22 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 12/17/2012. Pours hazy nearly opaque dark reddish brown color with a 1 finger fairly dense tan head with decent retention, that reduces to a ring of lace that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of huge raisin, prune, fig, pear, apple, caramel, molasses, toffee, toast, brown bread, light chocolate, tobacco, leather, herbal, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Incredible aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/bready malt and fruity yeast ester notes; with great strength. Taste of big raisin, prune, fig, pear, apple, caramel, molasses, toffee, toast, brown bread, light chocolate, tobacco, leather, herbal, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of raisin, prune, fig, pear, apple, caramel, molasses, toast, toffee, brown bread, light chocolate, tobacco, leather, herbal, light pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity of dark/bready malt and fruity/earthy yeast ester flavors; with an awesome malt/yeast balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and very full bodied; with a very creamy, slick, and lightly syrupy mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming present after the finish. Overall this is an insane English Barleywine. All around incredible complexity and balance of dark/bready malt and fruity yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. An extremely amazing offering."

"O: Extremely enjoyable. Never had this fresh before but this beer is pretty fantastic with 4 years on it"

"Awesome in its stature alone. Somewhat one-dimensional owing to the minimal sweeteness. Never thought I'd be wishing for a Barleywine to be sweeter."
""
""
"Absolutely tremendous berry profile...blackberry, blueberry, marionberry , boysenberry, and lingonberry. Thereâ€™s also some fig, raisin, rhubarb, and a reasonably hefty helping of very floral hops to dry out the finish. The body is slightly syrupy, but not overly so. I like this even more than Mother of all Storms."

"Overall probably one of the best, most intense non-barrel-aged English barleywines I've had yet, and it gives some of those a run for their money as well. Outstanding."
"Pours a dark amber and mahogany color capped with light brown foam. Aroma is a mix of molasses, black cherry, raisins and tobacco. The flavor starts with a hefty dose of brown sugar, toffee and cherry liqueur followed by some date, plum and grape juice notes. There is some chocolate, fig and currant in the background as well. Mouthfeel is thick and syrupy with soft carbonation and more malt and booze in the finish. Overall, a sweet and potent English-style barleywine with a unique blend of dark fruit and malt flavors. Want more of this especially on a cold winter day!"
"O: $14 for this beer? I was dooped."
"Overall- I have had much better barleywines in my lifetime but this one isn't bad. It doesn't try to achieve too much and remains a solidly good beer. I would give it a B+."

"Pours a deep amber brown with a smallish off white head that dissipates quickly. Smells of brown sugar and toffee with a hint of smoke and chocolate. Light earthy herbal aroma rounds out the nose nicely. The flavor is sweet with sugary malts hints of cherry and toffee with some light earth and smoke. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet slick mouthfeel. Hard to believe this is 13% but maybe the barrel aged stouts before this numbed my palette a bit. Nice English style barleywine that I'd like to revisit one day."
"O: An incredible rich barleywine that impressed. It was interesting to have this to after MOAS, which definitely adds another component with the barrel."
""
"Overall: The parts of this beer that I liked, I really liked, but the oddly sour/bitter flavor was off putting. The beer is also much thinner than I would have liked, especially for the style."
""
"Overall quite a nice beer. I'm a fan of English Barleywines, especially when aged a couple years, so this should have been pretty good unless they screwed it up, and they didn't. Lots of malts that are nice, mostly toffee and nutty flavors, nice caramel and toasted malts as well, and a molasses and biscotti like flavors in there too. Nice light bitterness mostly on the back end, and soft aged malts. Booze is hidden fairly well, and it will get me buzzed quickly."

"One of my absolutely favorite (non barrel-aged) barleywines."
""
"A good malty barleywine, though the sweetness is high enough that it's on the downslope (less would be better, more would definitely be worse)."
""

""

"overall: an english barleywine for the sipping - worth a try if you stumble across it"
"Overall: I'm actually pleasantly surprised by the slight bitterness in the finish, and I welcome it. Most of the times barleywines are too sweet for my taste, but this one was good. I enjoyed it. Wish it looked more appealing though."
"Pours a murky dark brown with a tan head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. No lacing on this one. Smell is of malt, brown sugar, caramel/toffee, and some slight hop aromas. Taste is the same with a medium bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good barleywine but I prefer Mother Of All Storms over this one."
"EDIT: 2007 vintage consumed Jan 2013. Definitely tasting its age. Very drinkable but past its prime."
"Overall - A really nice barleywine in terms of flavor. Just the finish that makes it a bit harsh. I've been waiting to drink this before I tried MoAS. If a bit of barreling can chip away at that finish, I would be most pleased."
""
"Overall- Very boozy. Very sweet. Even after this long it is too much for me. Still too hot and syrupy. 3"
"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a very dark red brown amber, almost black, no head and light carbonation. Aroma of sweet and caramel malt, faint dark fruits. Fortunately, the flavor is richer, sweet, caramel and toasted malt, dark fruits. Finishes somewhat dry and quickly, with a bit of a hops kick. Medium body with some creaminess. The high ABV makes it a bit hot. A satisfactory Engilsh barleywine, but the lack of carbonation detracts from the drinking experience. Other reviews seem to have good carbonation, so I'll try this again."
""
"Overall: Nice mouthfeel but I'm not really digging the flavor."
"Cheers!"
""
""
"Having had MoAS this summer, I'm not sure which I prefer because I found the bourbon note in MoAS to overpower the majority of the base beer but I don't recall it having the medicinal finish that Stormwatcher's does."
""
""
"One finger brown head, quick dissipation with absolutely no lacing over dark brown body with small trails of small bubbles visible rising up near sides of glass. Nose is really sweet, some caramel malt, and floral and woody hops. Taste mirrors the nose's sweetness, cloying, soy sauce, turbinado, woody hop character. Mouthfeel medium, sticky, good effervescence. Not my cup of, err, tea, the sweetness overwhelmed any nuances this beer might have had."

"O - A good beer, I suspect the age has smoothed it out a little bit as this was very good and easy to drink."
"O - Really nice with the age on this one. The booze is super smooth and the sweetness is not overdone. This is the reason why MoaS is such a great beer...the age adds another dimension."
"One of the best domestic examples of the style...happy to sample this first before cracking one of barrel aged versions. Perfectly suited for the environment it was produced in...takes me right back to the Oregon coast."
"O: Nowhere near as good as Perfect Storm, but not many barleywines are."
"(O) Very nicely done barleywine. I can definitely see this being a great base for Mother of All Storms....which I want to try."
"Another great job by Pelican Pub. Awesome work folks!!"
"Overall a top top notch English style barleywine. I had really really high expectations for this based on this being the backbone for their Barrel-Aged Mother of All Storms, so I was mildly disappointed by the outcome. It was very very good don't get me wrong, but for a 4 year old barleywine their is still some alcohol heat which is surprising (but I guess it is 13% ABV) and although the flavor profile is very good, it's not mind-blowing or complex (really just caramel and toffee with no supporting dark fruitiness). Maybe it is deteriorating as well... Unfortunately, I am going to compare this and all Barleywines going forward to the Arctic Devil that I had a couple weeks back. I can see how this will be a good canvas for the MaoS that I have yet to sample (but I have a couple cellaring)."
"I've wanted to try this since having it's big brother Mother of all Storms. It's definitely a bit more harsh on the palate than MoaS but still good."
"(D)- What a great Barleywine. Rich and sweet without being too cloying, thick, or boozy. Really a great profile for the style. I can definitely see how this becomes Mother of All Storms; possibly the greatest Barleywine I have ever had!"
"Overall a smooth very drinkable nicely balanced Barleywine."
"D - It's a sipper, but a good one. Looking forward to cracking my 2007 bottle sometime with the wife (as this is her favorite style). Worth seeking out if you love The Perfect Storm."
"D - Best Barleywine I have had hands down. (thanks Evan) Pelican is no joke and they know what they are delivering to those that seek out their beers...GREAT job!!! (from one of the few lucky bastards in Indiana who actually may get to try this beer!!!) Have a Perfect Storm waiting....also 2008"
"Sexy ruby with low low carb. Raisins, caramel, toffee, earthen pots, and alcohol wisp into the air. Big maltiness, big sexiness, and I'm gonna steal from the review below me, but the alcohol kick is certainly reminiscent of a high quality smooth rum. It's damn good, viscous, chewy. This is how life begins. With moments like these."
"Tasty beer, but I don't think it will hold up in the cellar as well as it's big brother ""The Perfect Storm"". The malt is on the edge of oxidation and there are zero hops throughout the bottle to help it along."
"Overall this is one of the best barleywines I've drank, it is no surprise that this holds up so well to barrel aging and morphs into the perfect storm."
"2009 vintage. Having recently had East End Gratitude, this beer is in for a difficult challenge. It pours a very dark brown color and smells almost as good - again, that characteristic toffee, caramel flavor, coupled with a bit of booze. Pelican's offering brings that flavor, but in a bit more muddled fashion. There is also some slightly unpleasant booziness (slight!). I am enjoying it and would probably like it more if I didn't just have the knockout of the style in Gratitude."
"Great barleywine overall. Had this side-by-side with Perfect Storm '09 and it was tough to pick a winner."
"4/4/4/4.5/4"
"Drinkability: This is no Perfect Storm, in name or in flavor. I think part of that's in my head, what with the increased harshness/bitterness from the alcohol, but also from the lack of balance that the barrel aging contributes. Regardless, I'm still pretty impressed by this beer - it's a well-made barleywine, with tons of complexity and flavor, with tons of dark leafy hop notes and dark, steely malts, and with tons of sweeter, fruitier, lighter notes. This one has the potential to be beautiful with a year or two of age on it - if you got it, sit on it, and if you got two, sit on one and send me the other. Cheers!"
"drinkability - this one is flavorful but meant to be sipped, too much and it fatigues very quickly"
"I didn't know the alc% when we drank it and I'm not surprised it's listed at 13.3%, another bottle shared by presario at hoser's British Open Sunday tasting"
"- Overall it's heavy. Super sweet... sticky... and a mess. It's really not that good... and I'd take a real barleywine over this molasses and honey mess any day. I honestly can't see and taste what people are thinking here with this brew.."
"Drinkability: Really drinking nicely now, with great balance between the elements"
"D: Sure, the alcohol heat is evident ~ Bah, so what...it's a straight-up delicious barleywine that requires plenty of time to sip and someone to enjoy it with. Could stand a little more time in the cellar to fully calm down; still, it's damn fine right now."
"Similar to Anchor Old Foghorn, but slightly richer."
"all of these were individually excellent and it was amazing luck to be able to have this on tap. not what i was expecting from such a small town brewery."
"I'm a sucker for a great English barleywine and that's exactly what this is. The sweetness is dominant but with a hop profile that makes things more complex and a completely massive mouthfeel. A fantastic dessert beer."
"Mouthfeel is heavy, dense and oily with a big bite adding to the bittersweet flavor, wonderful."
"Drinkability- Not a bad barleywine, but not really English style IMO. Worth trying though...interesting mix of flavors."
"The beer is full bodied with low-medium carbonation. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. This is a quality English Barleywine."
"Overall impression: BIG English barleywine that seems like it could hold up for a long time in the cellar. Could be great in a few years."
"I'd have this again, if I aged it a few years. And I'd split it with a friend."
"This was a 2006 bottle from my cellar. Pours a cloudy reddish brown with a medium head. The beer smells like Thomas Hardy with all the old fruit and burnt sugar. This is a splendid barley wine with all the big evolved mouthfeel ( 2-3 years in the cellar seem to transform the beer from young hoppy and sweetish to dry and rounded.) As with all Pelican beers this is very drinkable and balanced to a T."
"2006 Vintage. Pours a slightly ruddy brown, some haziness and a decent sized butterscotch yellow head that slowly recedes. Aroma is a nice sweet caramel maltiness, some fruit sweetness, strawberry, malted milk, bread and raisins. Taste follows with more sweet maltiness and dark and ripe fruit, raisins, prunes, dates, dried strawberries like a fruit roll-up, a hint of citrus hoppiness blends with the malty sweetness. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy, creamy and chewy maltiness, hint of pepperiness, some warmth and a small bite from the alcohol which is otherwise very well hidden. Delicious barleywine, drinking good at this age, would love to try a fresh version sometime, but this beer seems though it could easily go longer. Thank you Paul for the opportunity."
"D: I still find the alcohol quite harsh."
"Thank you for bringing to our barleywine night, Derek. 2006 is entered on the label. Big off-white head with a cheese appearance and bubbles. Some lace seen. The smell is sour and barleywine. The taste is considerably on the sour side, it is intentional. Primarily it tastes like an average barleywine.Somewhat disapointing for a barleywine with some ageing. Mt. Hood hops. 31 IBU."
"d: This was very close to being an outstanding barleywine. Without that lingering charred flavor, this would have been world class. As it was though, I did enjoy it quite a bit."
"2006 vintage bought from John' Grocery in Portland a while ago. Doesn't look like much- pours`a hazy dark brown with little head. . From there it gets much better. Lovely aromas of caramel toffee, spice, sassafras, some roastiness and sweet. Nice. The taste has similar components, but there is also quite a bit of herbal tang, more spice, and a good deal of sweet malt, but all with a very bitter citrus and pine hop finish. All big flavors, but they balance each other rather than conflict. The mouthfeel is a bit sharp and full. Huge and spicy and very high alcohol make this one a sipper."
"12/28/09 edit. Stopped by again today, and was able to taste the 2004 through 2009 side by side, along with the 2009 perfect storm. While all were excellent (and once again, the 2005 was the standout), all of these beers were quite different as well. So I think it's kind of sad that this beer is not entered into the data base by vintage, as each vintage was noticeably different. In any event, regardless of the vintage, winterstorm is an excellent beer, one worth sampling and enjoying. The winter storm flight, at $10 for 5 beers, was an especially good value IMHO (not exactly something Pelican Brewing is known for). Definitely try the flight if you happen to have the chance."
"Drinkability is very good. It's not an overwhelming powerhouse of flavor. But the subtle warm flavors make this a very nice Barleywine to sip. This tastes more like a English Barleywine to me."
"WOW!, caught me a little offguard there on my first sip thinking it was just another winter type ale that turned into a barleywine ale. This 2006 bottle pours a cloudy dark brown that you can tell has some viscosity to it that carries a thin head. Smell is rich in malt, honey liqueur, dark fruits and alchohol. Taste is what is expected from a barleywine big and bold with a good alchohol bite, with a thick and rich mouthfeel. Now that my palate is in tune to what I am really tasting and letting it warm a bit, I can get the true style of this beer and really appreciate it's warming effect."
"On par with most of the Pelican beers I've tried (most of them on tap at the brewpub), and that means it's a superb bit of craftsmanship. It's survived a year in the bottle quite well. Could use even more aging, no doubt. So I'm sipping this on a brisk, sunny, beautiful autumn afternoon, with nothing but fall's colors around...and I'm wishing I were standing on the beach in a mighty wind watching a storm off the pacific coast in Pacific City. It happens. Wish I could find this beer without travelling cross-country to get it."
"Vintage 2006, poured from the bomber into two pint glasses. Dark, ruby red in color with muted carbonation and lace. The aroma is a pleasant blend of caramel, malt, molasses, cherry, and hops. The tasteÂ…. is huge. This stuff could probably sit another six months, or a year, or more. Flavors follow the aroma perfectly, except for a substantial, but reasonable, alcohol bite on the end. Very, very tasty. Mouthfeel is fairly full, and would likely soften and get even fuller with time. One of the best American barley wines IÂ’ve had."
"Pours a very dark burgundy/mahogany color with an adequate roasted marshmallow head that recedes steadily while leaving zero lacing. And yes, this glass is beer clean. The yulesmith I just drank out of one of it's kin left a nice thick layer. Anyway, the aroma is malty. Kinda bready and nutty at the same time. The taste reveals more depth. I get hints of caramel, alcohol, butterscotch, various nuts, fig and other flavors I'm unable to identify. Upon warming, the alcohol really comes out. First sip was at proper serving temp, but the alcohol was almost non-existent. I wondered if this was really as big as advertised. But now I know. It definitely is. I initially criticized the mouthfeel for a lack of carbonation, but soon became aware of the thick syrupy body that I love so much with these huge barley wines. This is well-crafted and all the components seem to be enjoying a nice harmony. I can't knock it. It got better with each sip until I realized I now need to go purchase a few more before the shelf is empty. Considering its strength, this brew is off the charts as far as drinkability is concerned. This beer should be spectacular for years."
"A fine choice for my 200th review, I'm really glad I have another one of these in the stash, I bet it'll keep maturing for years. We'll see just how patient I can actually be!"
"Really nice complex and huge barley wine. Drinkable but in the long savoring way that a great barley wine should be. Very highly recommended, need to get more!"
"What a pleasant surprize to try this on a winter day in Alaska!"
"Sampled at the 2003 Holiday Ale Festival, Portland, OR. A dark reddish cider color, hardly-there head. Lots of malts but hops are there from the beginning. Supposedly this beer employed 2 kinds of unusual hopping techniques: mash hopping and first wort hopping. This creates a subtle yet indelible hop flavor that is there from the very beginning. Some smokiness, and a smooth non-carbonated mouthfeel. This beer is pretty good but in the end it's a bit flat and cloying."
"Its taste explodes with a huge bananna and nut flavor with a big alcohol bite. This is a great example of a strong ale -- American style."
