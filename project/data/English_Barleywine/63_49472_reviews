"O:  A real nice beer.  Scratch that, a great beer.  Nice complexity, fairly easy drinking and just a great sipping beer to enjoy and warm your belly (and heart).  This is a terrific barley wine that I'm so glad I finally got to enjoy.  Drink this and love it."
""
"Overall, a fairly good and unique beer. Even though the beer is closer to a DIPA instead of  a barleywine, the beer still manages to have a nice malt presence that turn the hops into the carriers of the fruity notes traditionally found in barleywines. Highly recommend."
""
"22 ounce bottle into snifter, best after 2/24/2015. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy dark ruby red color with a 2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, brown bread, molasses, light nuttiness, raisin, plum, fig, apple, date, light licorice, herbal, light oak/vanilla, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Incredible aromas with awesome complexity and balance of dark/bready malts, fruity/earthy yeast, and light-moderate oak barrel notes; with great strength. Taste of big caramel, toffee, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, molasses, light nuttiness, raisin, plum, fig, apple, date, vanilla, light licorice, herbal, light oak, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Slight tannic/oak bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, brown bread, molasses, light nuttiness, raisin, plum, fig, apple, date, vanilla, light licorice, herbal, light oak, and yeast/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity and robustness of dark/bready malt, fruity/earthy yeast, and light-moderate oak barrel flavors; with a fantastic malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very smooth, creamy, and lightly slick/sticky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming lingering after the finish. Overall this is an absolutely incredible English barleywine style. All around outstanding complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready malt, fruity/earthy yeast, and light-moderate oak barrel flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. An insanely delicious offering."
"O - I'm glad I finally pulled it off the wall and drank it.  A little hot on the finish and would like a bit more complexity from the wine barrels.  However,  very good brew that surprisingly is still sitting on a lot of store shelves in my area.  Prost!"

"Looks like a liquid tootsie roll, smells of port wine, tastes super smooth with not much alcohol BAM for a beer that's 11%.  Overall terrific.  Opened on my b-day, March 22, 2015."

"Pours a hazy reddish brown with a small, thin off white head. One of the more opaque barleywines I've seen.  Smell is lovely, lemony hops and rich honey, sweet malt and caramel, subtle earth tones. You can really smell the age, and history that this beer has. Taste is absolutely sublime, perfectly complex and robust, but with no overwhelmingly distracting flavors.  Brown sugar, bitter chocolate, fig, plum, some notes of aged Tawny Port. Myriad of different flavors to enjoy that subtly change as the beer warms. Feel is full bodied, low carbonation: slick and smooth, but not super sticky. No booziness but some subtle warmth in the gut. Overall, this is absolutely fantastic, the qualities all combine to give this an ancient and timeless presence. One of my new favorites and worth the wait to cellar."

"Damn good. SF beer week from a tap. I was surprised. I almost went with something else, but I'm glad i chose this one. Delicious till the last drop. Complex and bold. Would order again in a heartbeat."
""
"Kind of surprised but I loved this beer."
""
""

"Sweetness, and little else. Honey?"

"Overall-  this is not quite the bcbwine, but getting there.  It doesn't come together quite as well."
"2014 release. Excellent barleywine, get this if your a barleywine fanatic like myself.I give it a solid 9.6 out of 10"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Really nice barleywine. I think they found a good ratio between the barrel aged and non barrel aged component, as any more would have overwhelmed the base beer characteristics. If they release this again, I'll definitely pick up another."
""
"Overall: been dying to try this for months. So worth the wait."
""
"O:Flavor explosion.. This was a fantastic balance of barley wine and the wine character. the hop presence seemed to pickup as my pallet adjusted to all the different flavors - one things for sure this was complex. and delicious"
""
""
""
"O- This beer is just as delicious as it is drinkable which equals dangerous.  So well-balanced between the malt sweetness, barrel character and alcohol content.  Also, the mouthfeel is pretty spot-on.  I think I like this at least as much as Sucaba, if not more.   I know they use different barrels but it's the only other BA English Barleywine I've had that comes close to being as good."

"Beautiful Amber color with a little fizz poured n2 a red wine glass! It is a barley WINE! Right. Great smell. Flavor nice and smooth. Not 2 sweet like u expect from a barley wine.  Paired it with Perez Carrillo La Historia cigar that's spicy.  I'm n flavor heaven. Will grab another and revisit this in 2017!!"
"Overall - This is what barleywine should be!  How did they get it so right?"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"sweet carmel notes and little head"
""
""
"O- Solid English barleywine that doesn't really deliver any of the red wine barrel characteristics, but if you like American barleywines, this is a reasonably hoppy barleywine. I think the English Barleywine designation on this site is definitely a misnomer."
""
"Slightly sweet.  Great deal of flavor and some effervescence."
""
""
"Overall: One of the better barleywines I've had recently. Very well balanced and not over the top. I was worried that the wine character was going to overwhelm the rest of the beer, but it felt like a natural component. I'd love to get another one to cellar for a year or 2"

"Overall: I have had Bigfoot several times, it reminds of Bigfoot with a year or two on it, for an English barley wine it seems a little too bitter. I've had other English barley wines that were really smoother. I drank it before the best after date, don't know if that matters, but I was expecting more wine barrel aromas, still really smooth, easy drinking beer, worth a try and money."

"O: this is an English Barleywine!? It's so far from one it's mind boggling it's pure Hops and it's good with the bourbon but not English"
""
""
""
""
"I liked this beer quite a bit...  In error, I did not let this one fully open up before I started in on it but as it sat and warmed, it really got to be excellent...  An excellent effort from Deschutes here...  Glad that they are in KY so I can make a short jaunt up to sample their products without having to trade for them...  I can't remember what I paid for this but, at this point, it was well worth every penny...  simply amazing and very enjoyable..."
""
""
""
""
"Eye-popping and palate pleasing to the hilt! Chewy and boozy, loaded with strong malt sweetness yet very fitting for the style. Huge depth and complexity in the flavor department and well-balanced throughout. This would have been very interesting to try past its ""BEST AFTER"" date yet delivers a huge pallet of goodness right now. A barleywine 'must-try'..."

"Just an awesome barleywine, which you know if you've been lucky enough to score a bottle. Aroma was raisins, wine, tart cherries, chocolate, brown sugar, hazelnut and pomegranate. The color was very pretty, a very deep ruby brown, opaque, with a nice beige head. It was a full bodied beer with a heavy mouthfeel that left it sticky. The taste was plums, raisins, cherries, vanilla, dark brown sugar, wine, chocolate and a little booze, but it's wine so whatever, right? This is a big complex barleywine that's just begging to be explored, and luckily it's delicious so you'll want to. Incredible now but I imagine it will benefit nicely from additional aging."

"O 4 - excellent English Barleywine with some uniqueness with the wine barrel aging. I wasn't sure how well it would meld, but it works well. Although this is really good, it is a  high priced bomber and I'm not quite sure it lives up to expectations, therefore I won't be buying it again."

"Pours amberish marron with a dirty cream colored head. Aroma and flavor mirror each other; bready and veering towards doughy, red wine tannins and its barrel, caramel and some caramelized pitted dark fruits  mixed with some brown sugar. Medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, I really am not a barleywine fan but I had to give this a try given the rave reviews it has. Plus,I was able to try it on tap and didn't have to commit to a full bottle. Ultimately, not really my thing but a good beer for what it is. I will stick with Firestone Walkers Sucuba if I ever have a craving for another barleywine. At the least I prefer the use of bourbon barrel over wine barrel when paired with a barleywine."

"Dark amber body. Good amount of head for 11% booze. Grainy alcohol sweet smell. Just got done with a CW BBBW, and this one isn't quit as sweet. Still very sweet with some hoppy fruit flavors. Easily 2nd best BW I've had."

"Goodbeer, but it should be under American Barleywine. A bit too heavy on the hoppy side for it to be an English Barleywine."

"Finally, a good English style barley wine that can hold up to what I am looking for in the style from Deschutes Brewery. Ale pouts a thick brown molasses color with off white foam that has very light clinging lacing. Nose of raisin, plum, caramel, sweet cherries, and light oak. Taste....WOW...I have been looking FOR YOU! Sweet caramel notes up front, golden raisins, and brown sugar to the back with a plum and brandy like quality on the aftertaste. FANTASTIC. Nice silk smooth, yet lightly syrupy mouthfeel, with easy drinkability makes this one beast of a great brew. CHEERS. I have FINALLY found a decent substitute for Thomas Hardy's...reminiscent of some of the early 90's Thomas Hardy's I have tried aged 10 years or so. AWESOME!"

"Overall - Really tasty and smooth for being 11%. Loads of complex flavor, and the barrel age wine aspect didn't sour or bitter this all to hell. A really nice beer, and one of the best from Deschutes. A must try even if not a fan of the style."
""

""

"Overall, I say this was a great beer well worth a superb night cap. Would I have it again, hell yeah."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Very tasty. Needed to do some warming to get the wine barrel out of it."
"A very alcoholic, fruit-forward, tannic, bitter barleywine. Not hoppy, and quite sweet up front, but has the alcohol bite in the back brings it down."

"O: Nice barleywine. Good combination of fruitiness and heavy bready malts. Super sweet and mildly bitter and dry. I enjoyed it quite a bit. Didn't really get any noticeable wine influence that I notice but I feel it may have contributed to the heavy dark fruit character up front anyway."

"Overall: perhaps I'm rating this a bit harsh because of the best after date. Deschutes is hit and miss to me. This reminds me of an aged stone barleywine with a bit more tannin character. Ive got one in the cellar. But disappointed by the expectations set from a waxed bottle."

"Reddish brown in color. Thick head leaves a decent lacing. The aroma and flavor of this beer have a great deal of variation and layers of complexity. Wood, caramel and toffee, brown sugar soaked hops on the nose, a hint of wine. Lots off toffee maltiness and hops mixed with some dark/tart fruits in the taste. Wood and vanilla on the finish. Moderately warming, hot in the mouth. Very much full bodied. Excellent beer overall, although a tad hoppy for an english barleywine IMO. Would love to age one of these for about 5 years to tame the alcohol and hops a bit. Who knows when I'll see it again though."
"I found this barleywine to be very enjoyable, quite drinkable and a thoroughly pleasant surprise."
""
"22 oz bottle. This a solid beer all around. It pours a dark caramel color with decent a moderate head and lacing. The smell is strong grapes followed by oak and caramel. The taste is really well-balanced, with grapes at the beginning followed by a smooth and sweet finish. This has a great texture and is not overly thick or boozy. I'm really impressed with this one."
"O: awesome aged barleywine that is not overpowering with the aged part, which is something i hate when the aged part just completely overpowers the actual beer. I would recommend getting as much of this as you can find to age and enjoy down the road."
""
""
""
""
""
"A great Barleywine, and spot on for an English example of the style. It is a bit on the pricy side, but a great treat every once in a while. Another highly recommended offering from Deschutes."

"Overall: A very good take on a Barleywine. Good bready caramel and toffee notes with a nice balanced wine barrel presence."
"C+"
"My description and review would be almost verbatim from @homebrew311 below me, except my ratings are a little higher. I am not a wine person, but the red ? wine barrel works really well in balancing this beer. Very sweet and malt driven with a nice tartness. The only knock on it would be that it had a little bit of a hoppy bite or finish for an english style. In fairness, it does have a ""best after"" date on it. That should take care of the very slight bitterness. It is a fantastic version of the style though. Completely enjoyable from day 1. Cant wait to try the others in 1,2, and 3 year increments. This comes in just behind Goose Island Bourbon County, along with Billionaire, for the best BA English so far. $15 each is what I paid for this."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: 4.25 This is a very good English barleywine with a lot of good flavors and aromas. There could be a bit less hops in my opinion, but maybe in a year or two it will mellow out and be more balanced (the bottle does recommend drinking after 2/24/15). Hopefully it will improve with age."

"Pours a slightly cloudy tawny/reddish/amber with almost no head. The nose is an absolute malt bomb. You get plenty of the expected notes from a big English barleywine including bread, raisins, toffee, caramel, molasses, and a hint of red wine sneaks through in the background. The hops are tame in this as they really allow the big sweet malts shine. A touch of oak is present as well. The taste is malt forward and sweet with an emphasis on the caramel, molasses, and dark fruit character. The red wine character seems to tie this beer together as it adds a hint of acidity and tames down the sweetness of the beer. Mouthfeel is fully bodied and low in the carbonation department. Overall, a very nice Barleywine."

"Overall, a truly excellent barrel aged BW and one I'm glad I splurged on. However, with a big and boozy (in a good way) beer like this, I find myself wishing it was 30 degrees colder outside and snowing while I sip it by the fire. Guess I'll have to track down another bottle and set it aside for next winter."
"Overall, just a wonderful BA barleywine, and the use of wine barrels makes for a completely different take on the style. I have yet to sample the FW barleywine of barrel-aged fame, but if it's better than this fantastic take, I'm going to be in for a treat. I have another couple bottles and will really enjoy seeing how this one evolves with some age."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - It's good. $16 good? I don't think so. It's doubtful I'd buy it again, not even for aging, though I enjoyed drinking it. There are few brews in the world worth that price. This simply isn't one of them."

"I was a bit confused by this beer. It is classified as an English barleywine, but the hop profile reminds me of an American barleywine. I appreciated the nice, almost ruby red beer as it sat in my tulip. The beer had a very malty entry. Lots of intense plummy, raisiny fruitiness immediately following upon entering the palate. A tad too sweet for me. I also appreciated how well the alcohol was masked. It was only after sipping for a while that I felt the overall warming effects of this 11+% brew. I enjoyed the cooked caramel, molasses?, dark chocolate, and grainy/bready flavors that swirled along my palate. The hops threw me off. For an English b-wine I was expecting a more toned down English, noble hop profile. Instead what I perceived was a big citrus notes along with (and welcomed) spicy, earthiness from the hops. The hops reminded me more of an American b-wine. The hops were more ""bitey"" as the beer warmed. The big citrus hoppiness overpowered any wine nuances that were supposed to be evident. I love lightly carbonated beers, which is what this beer is. I would also prefer a fuller bodied beer. This beer was a bit on the thin side for me. I have a second bottle. I will retry in a year or so, the hoppiness should be more mellow by then. This is a solid b-wine. It's not as great as the hype would have you believe. I love all b-wines. If you do as well, this is a must try."

"O: a good barrel aged barleywine. A very pleasant brew. Very balanced. I look forward to trying this after some time. Edit from 20 minutes later: tastes REALLY good when it gets a little warm."

"O - A little harsh for an English barely wine. Drinkable, but not up to the level of hype that it has received. For something aged in wine barrels the wine character is lost amongst the hops. Might as well use bourbon barrels."

"This was a very good Barley wine. I purchased two bottles of this, one to try now and one to age after the best after date of 2/25/15. It will be hard to keep this bottle to find out how well it ages. It is a very smooth sipping beer with just a touch of the wine barrel notes in the after taste."

"This is an excellent barleywine with a nice change up of wine barrel aging instead of the standard bourbon.  Complex flavors.  This is my 2nd bottle.  The first I drank fresh and enjoyed but I see definite improvement in this 2nd bottle which has been aged not quite a year and was opened about 1 week past the best after date.  I have a 3rd bottle which I look forward to in the future."

"O: Well-executed, right up there with some of the best English-style Barleywines I've tasted. Great stuff."

"Been waiting about 4 years now to try this bad boy. Overall, a nice barleywine but rather looking forward to an well-aged version to round out the hop bitter edges. Guessing this will shine like fine port at around its peak."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is such an amazing beer. I'm so glad Deschutes brought it back. As far as English barley wines go, this is near (if not at) the top of my list. It is up there with FW Sucaba."
""
""
"My oh my - this has been one of my white whales for this brewery (the Abyss having slipped thorough my fingers too many times as well) - and now I have it. Memories of sitting in front of the Mirror Pond in Bend on a Sunday evening, on another brewery's patio are now eclipsed by the headiness of this offering. For a west-coast bred brew of the given style, I am surprised at the accuracy, if not the veracity of the aplomb evident here. I bristle at calling this 'young' seeming, since I was admonished at first from even going down that road - oh well, this is still freaking awesome."
""
"Very nice barley wine here, The oak notes are plentiful on the taste which is great. I bought 2 bottles and am excited to see how it does with age."
"Overall, this exemplifies the art of brewing. Wanna be a master at something? Drink beer, then drink this, and you'll see what level I'm talking about. Needless to say, this is a must-try before you die."
"Looked great poured Into a teku. Smelled similar to other BA barley wines.Tasted ok, a bad representation of something like firestone walkers sucaba. Very thin for something barrel aged. Might be a lot better with a couple years on it. I have a few more and will review again each year. Highly disappointed by this beer."

"Overall a fantastic example of the style, intense with delicate flavor notes. If it lacks anything, it would be an aroma as distinctive as the flavor. I'd love to see what proper aging brings out in this one... I suspect it only gets better with a few years in a cool cellar."

"Overall another stellar offering by Deschutes. My gripe with their Reserve line of beers lately has been that they pretty much limit the barrel aging to about 50% of the beer yet the price reflects a 100% barrel aged beer. I don't necessarily think they are doing it to produce a lesser quality product but it certainly helps profits. Yet the 50/50 ratio is pretty clever in that it avoids heavy barrel presence which can be ""cloying"" if overdone but maintains a great level of complexity otherwise maybe not achieved through standard non-barrel aging practices."

"O: a good beer, overall. I'd like a little more presence from the barrels, but it's enjoyable and quite srinkable for a barrel-aged barleywine."

"It was ok at best. This is my first Deschutes that has been a disappointment."

"O- milder BA Barleywine. Has nice sweet malts and dark fruit notes."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: If you're lucky enough to find it in the store, buy it. I doubt it's out there any more. Though I've heard they're going to release it again. I don't know if the guy who shared this with me is on BeerAdvocate, but Larry, if you're reading this, thank you sooo much. This is a great beer."
""
""
"O - Pretty sweet on the palate, but a solid, flavorful, and creamy barleywine that I would gladly visit again."
""
""
""
"muddled chestnut brown with a thin, loose off-white head. Caramel sweetness > wine barrel in the nose. Noticeable hoppy bitterness with vinous flavors cutting through the beer's barley sweetness. Full bodied, sweet, well carbonated, subtle wine barrel, and a slightly off-putting bitterness in the finish. Would recommend letting this batch hangout for a bit, hop profile is too much at the moment."

"Overall I am both happy and sad that we drank this beer. We drank one of these around 2 years ago, and to be honest I don't remember exactly what it tasted like then, so if this bottle does have an infection issue that lead to the tartness I described above, then so be it. As a whole I really don't taste or smell or see any signs of infection and I am really enjoying this fantastic beer. I believe this bottle is around 3 years old and it is drinking great. I am sad because this was the last bottle I had, and since I don't think it is infected, I could have saved it a little longer, but when would be a better time to crack it than this cool monsoon evening in Payson, AZ."
""
""
""
""
"pours amber with some creamy foam atop. Smells of nougat, vanilla, caramel and toasted sugars. Flavor is nicely rounded with sweet malts: toffee, caramel, brown sugar and nougat with a good hint of bitterness to complement. Medium bodied with moderate carb and slick finish. Really like how this one has matured."
""
""
""
"O: To their credit, Deschutes sent me a very nice handwritten note explaining the infection issues and apologizing (they also reimbursed me for the bottle). They definitely were on top of their game in solving customer service issues related to the infection. That said, I would never trade for the 2009 vintage again."
""
"Overall: See above... not too bad, even with the infection, but could be sooo much better. Que sera sera. Better luck next time, I guess."
""
"O: Really well balanced barley wine. 3 years was definitely a nice age, but I am sad I don't have anymore bottles. I'll be sure to grab a couple bottles next time Deschutes releases this. Highly recommended. Thanks again, Scott!"
""
""
""
"O- The infection killed what would have abviously been a great brew. I would have loved to review this without having this issue, but I cannot get myself to track another bottle down. Drain pour."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Deschutes doing it again. Glad this one wasn't infected like some others. Delicious easy drinking barley wine that ages wonderfully.   "
""
"O: I’ve liked most Deschutes products I’ve tried in my life, but this was a big disappointment….. boring even. I guess, if sugar cubes infused with pure grain alcohol is your thing, then knock yourself out."
"O- I had this shortly after release and was able to find this bottle, now nearly 2 1/2 years later. Age did well on this. Very complex and solid barleywine."
"O: this is a very good, very complex barleywine style ale. Nice subtleties amidst some strong characteristics. Not sure what the deet flavor/smell is going on, but overall it's good. Highly recommend."
""
""
"D: I was really worried this would be infected like my '09 Abyss, so I waited a couple years to open it. Now I wish I had tried it fresh. However, it was pretty delicious after 2.5 years anyway. I'd place it somewhere between Old Ruffian and Gratitude, or call it a caramel mimosa. Great scent and taste with solid body. Alcohol in finish made it more of a sipper, but a very enjoyable one at that. So curious how this was fresh, but lovely now. Could maybe age longer? I'm so happy this wasn't spoiled."
""
"Becomes more sweet as it warms up."
"Pours a cloudy, dark, ruddy amber. Lots of fine particles noted in the bottom of my glass. Thankfully, no large chunks. A small sheet of lace tops it off. The nose is rich with molasses, dark fruits, light booze character, wet wood. Very nice aroma. The body has not been hurt by time in the cellar at all. This one is hefty and filling. Carbonation level is moderate. Tasty beer with fig, plum, faint vanilla, toffee. Excellent beer. The flavors meld so well together. This is one of my favorite aged-Barleywines I have had. To those that are still sitting on some of these, the forecast looks good!"
"Overall, an interesting and complex barleywine. I was able to have this on tap about a year and a half ago at a local bar and I don't remember it being this good or this complex. That said, I also don't think this is the gold standard of all the barleywines I've had. And for being a partially barrel aged barleywine, I think I expected a little bit more of a barrel appearance. Take if for what it's worth."
""
""
"Overall Impression- Like the Abyss, I recommend sharing this with a friend (or ANYONE for this matter!). Very strong and put me under the table. Enjoyed thoroughly and while never seeing this before, had to order! I am very lucky I had such good luck finding a 2009 Reserve."
""
"D – This is a great example of an amazingly crafted barley wine. Its so drinkable even at this high an ABV. I found myself enjoying the entire bottle by myself throughout the course of the night. I regret not trying it fresh to see what the age did to it. I was hugely turned off of barley wines at that time though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm loving this barleywine. Great stuff."
"The body is smooth with soft carbonation. A little bit on the sticky side. Overall, this one is drinking like a champ. A little hoppier than I had imagined it to be, but this is a real treat."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"M: very drinkable, well-rounded beer slight cloying and aging with 2+ years on it"
""
"The beer is copper/orange hued with a thin, off white head that leaves sparse lacing on the tulip. The aroma offers brettanomyces, alcohol, oak, vanilla, and candied malt. The beer is just ok, and unorthodox for the style. An odd mix of sweet and sour. I don't dislike the beer, per se, but this hardly resembles a barleywine of any sort. Deschutes needs to fix these quality control issues and stop releasing infected beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a seemingly average barleywine which I do not think improved with cellaring."
""
"D - Very drinkable. I really like the richness of the brown sugar and malts alongside the barrel elements. The light dark fruit actually works well."
""
""
""
""
"O - Highly recommended Barleywine. Description says that it is English, I would float this one more towards American due to the citrus-like character. Do not expect hops like a Great Divide Old Ruffian, think more like Green Flash's Barleywine. Big malt character, vanilla and lingering bourbon provide a myriad of flavors. This is a reflection beer, expect to block some time out for this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a really nice sipping beer - rich, complex, and delicious. Glad I've got one more to cellar for a while."
""
""
""
"Overall: Pretty damn great. You gotta love a sweet beer though. I wish I would have had one fresh too. I don't think this one needs any more age, its smoothed out quite a bit I assume."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Awesome. I love a good English BW, and this one takes the cake for sure. Little oxidized, but what do you expect from a 6 year old beer? Big malts, smooth, alcohol is nice, bitterness isn't tongue scraping. Oakiness is present but not dominant. Another score for Deschutes."

"O: One of the best barleywines I have had the pleasure of trying. The barrels have smoothed this one out and yet the oak remains subtle and pleasing. Cheers to Deschutes for such a remarkable brew."
"I want to try a bottle as they intended because I can see this being a great beer, take a shot at it if you can if you like funk you wont be disappointed either way"
"Well done Deschutes, really pleased I got to try this beer not infected (or at least kept refrigerated long enough to keep the infection at bay.)"
"Very nice treat. Great balance of age for this one and would love to get another non infected bottle of this one."
"Had this one aging for two years and finally tried it. Pours a red/brown with a quarter inch of head. Smells fruity and a little bit sour. Tastes fruity like a barleywine should, but as I work my way through it, it loses complexity and turns out to be unremarkable. Carbonation is fine, but this is nothing special, especially for the $13 a bottle I paid for it."
"O - Good beer, pretty easy to drink, even at 11%. Has aged just fine, and I can see this getting even better over the next two years. Would drink again."
"Overall: Very impressed with this offering and I wish the TABC would approve the labels so we could get it in Texas."
"Pours medium copper with a small white head. Smells of big malts upfront with some oak and fig and rasin scents, a small amount of piney hops. Taste is amazing sweet caramel and oak flavors with some amazing malt backbone. Mouthfeel and carbonation are perfect for the style. Overall one of the best barleywines I have ever had, big shoutout to G311 for hooking me up with his last bottle of this...Thanks Vince"
"It seems, with the sour apple notes, this one may have had an inkling of the infection, but it hadn't taken over and dominated yet. It was still very well received and, had I known no better, I would have assumed the apple was intentional."
"O: It is one of the best Barleywines I have ever had. Over two year and a half years, it has gained a lot of sweet barley and caramel, with a bunch of dark fruit. It is an amazing Barleywine, it is not infected whatsoever!!!!"
"Flavor & Balance: If you are tempted to say you don't like barley-wines, I recommend letting this one sit a good 45 minutes before your first sip. The flavor changes dramatically as it warms. This brew is totally unique, it's like Celebrator meets Rodenbach Grand Cru meets Pliny the Elder. The cacophonous hoppy-sour tones ricochet around your mouth and tongue, but the oak intervenes just in time to develop a deliciously balanced melody. The flavors are ever evolving, mimicking it's aromas and adding cider, oats, nuts, Belgian malt, and slight cocoa powder. Quite outstanding, I want more!"
"My attitude toward barleywine has changed lately, and this beer really helped change my mind along with Hair of the Dog's Fred. Overall, I think this is a great beer from someone well-known as Deschutes Brewery."
"Pours a hazy honey orange-brown with a 1 inch orange-tan head that settles to a film on the top of the beer. Broken rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of brown sugar, caramel, toffee, apricot, peach, and citrus juices and citrus zests. Very nice smells on this one. Taste is of brown sugar, caramel/toffee, apricot/peach, and sweetened citrus juices. Surprisingly mild bitterness on the palate after each sip, with more of an acidic citrus juice quality than any real hop bitterness. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a medium body and smooth mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good barleywine with some very nice and complex smells and flavors. After perhaps 2 or so years in the bottle this has aged wonderfully."
"A solid barleywine but not at all what I expected for the style. Tastes almost like an aged IIPA with all the citrus and cane sugar notes that come to the forefront. Nice, but it doesn't have the flavor profile that I want from a barleywine."
"T: There's a lot going on here, but I'm not sure it's really doing it for me. Oak, plum and some port with a heavy oak finish. Some caramel malts as well on the end. A solid beer, but definitely not my favorite from deschutes."
"O - I really enjoyed it, but the sweetness was a bit much for a 85 degree day in Portland."
"Should continue to age gracefully through the years, hopefully without infection. I think this needs more aging."
"Beer is thin and burns on the back of the palate, very tart on the back end and vinegar throughout. SHAME on you Deschutes."
"O-After having mixed experiences with Barleywines, I was a little worried (fresh DFH Olde School was a turn off) the two years of age made this one great. Well balanced a great choice for the 4th of July."
"Narrative: “Yeah yeah, more bagpipes on the secondary, add in the Deadmaus sample, then crescendo to a 165 bpm, then cut it with classical guitar on the close” In the European scene, DJ Venestraus was the hottest thing to hit trilingual audiences. It was a series of cacophonous pangs and knocks that seemed to ebb and flow without any rhyme or reason. “Yeah, just like that, now extend into the 17:00 mark with goat bleating for a solid 4 minutes of flanger pedal.” The studio techs never questioned his genius and the underground media just assumed that his works would appreciate with age, however, even the most remotely old works still were incomprehensible to music discographers. “Alright and when I ask for syncopated plate and knife scratching, at least try and get resonant bleeks!” The studio tech shrugged and added more autotune to MIC4."
"My initial impression of this beer two years ago was this needs time. Nothing has changed. This beer seems to have remained static and neither improved nor regressed. As is, this isn't a great barleywine."
"you get a little of the oak, slightly smokey... this brew would go excellent with a chorizo sausage, some pickles and strong cheddar. drink this beer at a lighthouse with a pairing knife a red onion and some rye bread while a storm is blowing in -- THIS IS A GOD-DAMN GOOD ALE! ENJOY!... get me a pastrami on rye and some dijon mustard, STAT."
"Quite simply an outstanding barley wine and part of Deschutes Reserve Series. Aged in oak barrels, Mirror Mirror is actually a doubled up version of their Mirror Pond Pale Ale. It pours a dark amber color and there’s notes of sweet caramel and vanilla in the nose. There’s a lot going on in the taste, as the sweet caramel and vanilla are complimented by dark fruit and Cascade hops, with a bourbon like backbone from the oak barrels. Mirror Mirror has a warming, almost candy like feel to it as well, and goes down quite smoothly for a beer with an 11% alcohol content."
"D - 4.0 Closer to an American Barleywine than an English Barelywine in my opinion due to the assertiveness of the hops character. Decent, but not earth shattering; however, much better than the infected version."
"A sweet, delicious, complex, interesting sipper. A real treat! I wish i had bottles and bottles of this--this beer seems like it needs exploring!"
"Pours a nice hazy orange. A nice bit of white head that hangs out for a while. Smells mildly hoppy with a significant booziness on the nose. A great aroma but smells a bit harsh. Tastes dry and strongly boozy. The hops are subtle but very solid. This beer needs even more time i think. Pretty darn solid though"
"Overall - Solid overall, but doesn't knock my socks off."
"O- This was a real treat. No signs of infection that I noticed. Im surprised I was able to still find a few bottles on the shelves. I will definitely have more bottles of this in the near future."
"Non-blind comments: Heh, I really thought this was a wild ale of some sort. Apparently I was yet another victim of brett infection, but the unintentional sour ended up being pleasant. I'd still like to try unadulterated Mirror Mirror, though..."
"Definetly NOT infected, yeah. An amber/red/orange which is slightly transparent. A nice tight head appears and then retreats but some carb always stays afloat. When I sip some lacing is left behind. A very fruity and sticky hop aroma, some cherry and sappy pine with caramalized english malts. Strong caramalized malts fruity sappy hops. Bitter across the mid-palate. Just a hint of barrel towards the finish, little bit sticky with some honey on the finish. In the end this is awesome, but could use just a bit more barrel, although I appreciate the intricate nature of this beer."
"D: actually was drinking wonderful and enjoyed it by a bonfire next to lake casitas during homebrew fest. Good shit"
"This beer pours an orange body, very light foam on the head. This beer smells as if some brett funk has gotten into it. There is some clementine on the nose as well, but the musty brett smell is actually working pretty well with this beer. The taste has brett in it, but it comes out like a caramelized saison. I rather enjoy the level of funk that comes with this beer, I thought that it meant that I wouldn't enjoy it. I was pleasantly surprised by this mistake and would definitely have it again if I could be promised this level of brett in the beer, to which I found much delight."
"O: FANTASTIC. That sums it up rather well..."
"Overall this beer is a gem. I have patiently waited for some time. It was well worth it! This bottle was definitely not infected with brett as others have reported!"
"Infected rating: 4 - 3.5 - 3.5 - 3.5 - 4."
"Overall, yet another deschutes disaster. I look forward to Deschutes hopefully turning it around this year with the Black Butte XXIII release."
"O- Awesome. Looks great, tastes great and feels even better. There might be a little funk in here but I'm really glad i kept this one... Wouldnt mind more of this to let sit."
"I know this isn't the beer that Deschutes envisioned, but it turned out pretty good. The sourness and the hop bitterness are almost in a battle with each other, and the other flavors fill in the holes. It would be nice to see a brewery attempt a sour barley wine..."
"I will resist the urge to make the Snow White reference here...but not the urge to mention it. So there. Anyway, this stuff pours a murky ruby-amber topped by about a half-finger or so of off-white foam. The nose comprises vague horse blanket brett, ruby reg grapefruit, orange zest, and a healthy dose of caramel. The taste holds notes of brett (now more spider-webby than horse blankety), orange flesh, mashed potatoes, parsley, and caramel. Gotta say, this was not a very pleasant flavor combination here. The body is a hefty-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, I was in no way impressed with this brew. It wasn't entirely bad, per se, but I do not feel like partaking again in the near future."
"Shared during a small Charlotte BA tasting with marine1975, caSSino, CarolinaKevin, and GehenHerzog. I picked this one up while out in Cali for the Bruery RS Party, so I have to thank womencantsail for shipping it over to me! 2009 Vintage! Served from bottle into a Cigar City snifter. Poured red-orange with a half finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, caramel, wood, and a sour note (uh oh...). The flavor was of sweet malt, caramel, slight sour (at least it was only slight), wood, and peat. It had a light feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was okay, but it definitely had some sort of infection in it. The sour aspect did fade slightly upon warming up but was definitely still present. The aroma and flavors were decent, but definitely not awe-inspiring. Would love to try one that isn't infected/off in the future for comparison."
"Drinking this was like eating a meal. When I had it, it was the best barleywine I had ever had. Currently, it is still at the top of that list. It's complex and extremely heavy, but all of the flavors work well together."
"o - Overall, in the handful of Deschutes beers that I've been fortunate enough to sample, I have noticed a consistent vanilla caramel twist or flavor on everything that they do...and I dig it. It adds a nice touch of class to the beer and is a flavor that is very pleasant to me. Mirror mirror is another beer to solidify my thoughts that Deschutes is a world class brewery. Every beer wreaks of quality. This is a fantastic barleywine and it is nice to taste a barleywine with a big vanilla and oak dominance. Another winner."
"Overall, one of the better barley wines out there. Great balance, well masked heat, and layered flavors notes. It has cellared well, and looks as though it will continue too, glad I still have another bottle."
"D - Drinkability is impressive given the abv and obvious infection. Expectations were on the low side and I must say I'm shocked at how much I enjoyed this brew. At 11%, it's a one and done beer. I'd definitely give this another try though. I think Deschutes is onto something here (even though it wasn't intentional). Barrel aged wild barleywine."
"D: This is an excellent barleywine. The flavors are extremely well balanced, while the alcohol is well masked outside of the warmth it brings to the body. The aging made for a very smooth and easy drinking nightcap."
"I regret not jumping on this bottle earlier. But, I must say that it's impressive for an infected beer. The funky flavor works surprisingly well with the English Barleywine elements. I'd love to try a fresh, non-infected bottle for comparison. Speaking for this infected release, don't shy away from it. It's surprisingly good."
"Even though Mirror Mirror Reserve 2009 doesn't rise the stratospheric heights of their finest ales, Deschutes has done a great job with this primarily pale-malted American barleywine. Here's hoping Reserve 2012 is in the works at this very moment."
"This beer would have been amazing but the slight oxidization leaves a lingering aftertaste that is slightly metallic/sour/cardboard like. It is very faint right now but I can see this beer becoming awful if it develops much further. It's only slightly evident up front but as I go through the bomber the aftertaste becomes more displeasing. Considering it's faults this beer still tastes pretty good but I would recommend drinking your '09s sooner rather than later."
"D - solid all-around, though maybe i cracked this a little too soon, fearing the worst. the flavors and especially scents are still a bit muddled and struggling to be noticed."
"'Tis a sipper, for sure, but a very special tasty one. Heaps of complexity. Pretty well balanced. I'm glad I've got a few of this batch aging."
"D: Adequate carbonation make this pretty drinkable for a slower drinking style. I had no problem finishing a bomber and would have had no problem polishing off another."
"The being said, I think people are attributing the wine barrel-aging characteristics to infection, when it's actually intended by the brewers. Brett infection will lead to overcarbonation and gushing (as the brettanomyces converts residual sugars to CO2), as well as off-flavors (band-aids, horse, cheese), and a thinned out body - none of those were observed here."
"I cracked this one the very same day I found out about a possible infection. I couldn't detect anything that would be indicative of any sourness. This dark red to brownish beer has a decent sized head on it that dissipated after a few minutes. The nose and taste go hand in hand (or I guess it would be mouth and nose!). Lots of sweetness on both the nose and palate, with candied sugar hanging out at the back. Dark fruits, vanilla, and distinct woodiness to it lends to a nice strong mouthfeel. You almost feel like you have to work at this beer, like it is challenging you to conquer it. Awesome beer, can't really say much else."
" While it seems a tad thin at times, considering it's been conditioning and attenuating for sometime now, it's just fine. Some tannic notes are felt that might be lent by oak - good, and cleansing, and never harsh. Very easy and nice drinking ale for its magnitude and in general. It would suck to have missed its glory because of infection issues. I can't say what age could do to it but because Deschutes has acknowledged infection, I suggest, drink it now!"
"D - I feel like this could verge on the sticky, sweet hop mess type barleywines but then the oak comes in and rounds it out perfectly. Very nice."
"While the beer has definite flaws, I can't say I'm disappointed by my first taste of Deschutes beer. Despite how hung up I am on the aftertaste, there's really tons of beautiful flavor here, a (mostly) great mouthfeel, and a world class aroma. It's obvious that these guys know how to make good stuff, and I'm even more excited to try my bottle of Abyss."
"I've had this vintage before, approximately a year ago, and thought it simply ""good."" The flavors have since become richer, more pronounced, and more complex -- a huge improvement, from average to delicious. The finish was still a bit too dry for me; I was hoping for a fruitier, sweeter backend, but I think the bottle could've used another year or two of age on it. That being said, it's a solid barleywine and a joy to drink. However, if you've got some laying around still, I would recommend keeping it in the cellar for awhile longer."
"Easy drinking and bordering a barleywine/old ale blend, not enough thick caramel to make it a straight up b-wine. Hides its ABV superbly, brown sugar and malt heavy character, raisins and earth, hints of fruits, not overly thick body, not sticky and there's a nice light hop bite in the finish to cut the sweetness. Easy drinking, the years have done it well and it drinks like a charm. Aside from the hop varieties, little to label this as American, more akin to its English brethren."
"SkÅL!"
"Drink- A very good beer. I loved it. Drink it if you can find it. A 4.5 only because not everyone will get to try it."
"D: Had this fresh and it was way too hot. This is a completely different beer that has aged incredibly well. Similar to an old ale. Just a great beer all around. If you're aging one, you're still safe to sit on it for a while, but man is it drinking great right now!"
"2009 vintage bomber- appearance- muddy orange/tangerine, minimal head, close to zero lacing. Nose- vinous, almost kind of funky. A truly odd nose to this beer, wet funky wood. Taste- sweet caramel, followed by that same odd funk. Not infected but the astrigency from the hops and wood interplay strangely with the very sweet malts. Finish is bitter and boozy, with hop bitterness coming through in the end. Fairly thick mouthfeel. Drinkability is not great. I had higher expectations for this beer. Perhaps one to drink fresh and not cellar?"
"Wonderful flavors and one of the easiest-drinking barleywines I've sampled. Two more bottles remain in the cellar and it will be hard to ignore them!"
"Truly phenomenal. Its an American barleywine that smells like an English barleywine and tastes like an English old ale. All you need to know is that its worth every cent. Cheers Eric!"
"D: While tasty I don't think I could drink this one all the time. It is a nice change of pace from the usual stouts or porters I typically drink."
"D-Pretty heavy and, I am guessing, pretty high ABV. I think one of these would do just fine."
"Drinkability: I think the best days for this barleywine are ahead of it as it still has a bit of harsh character that limits the drinkability; otherwise, there is a lot to like and considerable complexity"
"This is hands down the best english barleywine I have had so far. Wish I could have found more while in Denver!"
"D: For an American Barleywine, the strong hops can be expected and the hidden alcohol make this a wonderful drinker."
"Drinkability: Very good, but very strong."
"D- I think a bomber of this is the perfect amount. It may be a little on the sweet side but pretty solid all around. Another good winter beer."
"Fantastic beer. I may have received this bottle in its prime. Though Mirror Mirror is higher in alcohol, the bite has largely faded. The strength is in the simplicity. Each individual flavor is allowed to shine rather than compete for dominance. A pleasure to drink, a remarkable beer."
"D: How much could I drink this beer in one night? Well one bottle was enough to sip over a couple of hours. Would I drink this beer again? Certainly. I enjoyed the flavors but wished I had let is sit longer and mature/mellow some more."
"Overall impression: Quite good now, with potential to be great. Excellent subtle use of barrel aging. Could be quite surprising in another year or so."
"Too bad it was my only bottle."
"Verdict: Awesome and worth every penny of your paycheck. Must find."
"Syrupy, honey malts provide lots of sweetness and the hops are holding on pretty well in the taste. Still a big beer as it finishes with a light alcohol burn. Hop flavors remind me a bit of Mirror Pond. About as sweet as you can get without being cloying. Very drinkable for a barleywine with a full mouthfeel...quite tasty."
"Mild herbal hops and toasted malts up front. Big pudding, toffee, and sugary malt notes follow and swell. Notes of oak, vanilla, caramel, and brown sugar weave in and out. Herbal, slightly piny, tannic hop bitterness fills in and balances some of the malty, warming goodness. Finish is a nice mix of this moderate bitterness and lingering toffee, fruit, and oak. Full-bodied, with a mostly creamy feel. A very nice tasting barleywine, with a nice blend of flavors. The oak adds a nice, but not overpowering dimension too."
"Bottle. Pours a clear reddish with a pretty large head. Aroma is sweet raisins and a really pronounced burned cashew thing that is really off-putting. Bad. Sweet and pretty creamy in the mouth, some nice dark fruit presence shines. But a heavy bittering element really clashes here. Not sure whether this is supposed to be a hoppy expression or not. Too sweet, not balanced, and the burned nut thing going on is just bad in my opinion. On a positive note it's not all that hot for an 11% beer."
"Decently drinkable and delicious."
"Pours a nice red-brown color with a light tan head and a bit of lacing. Moderate retention in my snifter. The nose is quite complex, bringing in a good dose of citrus and pine hops along with some really nice malt--good notes of caramel, sweet bread, cherries, dark fruits, and a bit of brown sugar. The taste isn't quite as out there and this relatively fresh (about four months old when consumed) bottle had a bit of booze. Good body with some booze and a nice sweetness, this was really nice fresh and I'm looking forward to seeing what some age does to it."
"This seems like an almost bizarre take on the style. It isn't superb but I don't dislike it. Rather, I imagine it would be an ideal barleywine to age for various intervals. Presently, it seems to be in an awkward phase. I would like to revisit this at some point."
"The mouthfeel is on the heavier side with carbonation being moderate for the style. Drinkability is very good, it had some great flavors and was very complex. The barrel aging added a great complexity to it without overpowering it. Excellent beer overall and very drinkable for the abv% and style."
"Could I drink a couple of these? Sure. I have. But the point is that I'd rather order something else next time as it becomes a bit monotonous and overbearing. With this potency of flavor I'd expect more than just punchy caramel and malt, but it lacks complexity and distinctive character. Some time would surely help. For now: Not great. Not my favorite. Not better in bottle."
"Drinkability is really nice for what it is. Drinks much lower than 11% and smooth finish with just a touch of lingering sweetness and no sticky feel. Hops are manageable too."
"Mirror Mirror pours somewhere between a deep marron and a rich amber, depending on how well it's lit. Three fingers of creamy beige head rise up, but it doesn't last long. There's a spot of lacing, but not really all that much. Nose is a blast of caramel, with some resiny hop notes thrown in there as well. The nose was good, but Mirror Mirror tastes even better. Like the nose promised, lots of caramel, but the malty flavors coming through are quite complex. I also find a bit of biscuit and even some fruits (apricots and figs) that I wasn't expecting. A noticeable, but somewhat tame wave of hop bitterness flows through next, and the same resinous hoppy note from the nose comes back to close out each sip. The body is rich, and slick enough that if it weren't for the moderate carbonation it would be a bit too syrupy. Overall though, it works (though not spectacularly). 11% ABV and no alcohol? Well done Deschutes. That, the subdued hop bite thanks to a year of aging, and a great malty flavor make this extremely drinkable. I have a hard time remembering any barleywine, English or American, that was disappearing from my glass so quickly."
"D-For the ABV it's pretty amazing. I kept sipping on til it was gone."
"I can see how aging this in pinot noir barrels would enhance the beer, though it is quite satisfying on its own and will likely to continue to develop with age. Stock up."
"Very nice beer from Deschutes. Highly recommended."
"D-Extremely drinkable for an 11% ABV that is barely evident, but welcome in the taste. This is the third of Deschutes' Reserve Series beers I have had, after The Abyss and Black Butte XXI. I just wish they were more affordable compared to Stone's comparable offerings, and compared to how their year round beers are so affordable, at least in Salem, Oregon."
"D: a fantastic Barleywine in my opinion, far and away the best one I've ever had (though that might be because it doesn't much taste like a traditional Barleywine). I really liked the Belgian sour yeast thing it had going on. A subtle complexity that I really appreciate as well as an outstanding balance--a characteristic of all the Deschutes beers I've tried so far. I would (and will) happily drink this again."
"Overall, a really good fruity barleywine. I prefer the hoppy ones myself but if I was going for fruity then this would be near the top of the short list. Another great offering from Deschutes. Highly recommend. Not avail here in TX so got from Roberts. Rotation - I prefer the hoppy ones so probably wouldn't seek out another bottle but would try again on tap or if a friend had one to share. [N;O]"
"M- Soft carbonation, creamy body. Bitterness is low, alcohol is warm but very manageable."
"drinkability: relatively nice"
"Quite an enjoyable barleywine. I don't know whether it was the year of age or how the beer was brewed, but the hops (both taste and aroma) were very muted for an American Barleywine. I've been hoping to try Mirror Mirror for a while now and even after tasting it blind, it didn't disappoint. Very solid."
"Great job by Deschutes!"
"2009 Vintage. Pours a clear reddish-amber color with a minimal off-white head. Scent is TONS of sweet malts, molasses, dark fruits, no alcohol whatsoever. Taste is initially lots of caramel and candy sugar. Lots of molasses and such complex dark fruit flavors. The alcohol/booziness is very much there once this beer starts to warm up. Lot's of cheery flavor at the end. The mouthfeel is VERY NICE! Not to syrupy at all. The drinkability is fairly high."
"Mouthfeel is on the thicker side of medium. Drinkability is a little down. This beer is still a little young. Its still drinking hot. I would love to see how it develops over the next year."
"Sweetness and a little alcohol warmth finish this brew off. Remarkably drinkable. This is in the top three barleywines I have had. Very strong contender."
"One of the best barleywines out there! Pouring this beer you would first notice the color, but instead the smell hit me first! A blast of sweet malts, caramel, some honey, and a hint of alcohol washed over me. Before noticing the color I had already got an indication of what it would look like just by the smell. The color was a dark amber with a little off white head which turned into a thin lacing. The taste was wonderful. It totally matched the smell of this beer. The mouthfeel was a little syrupy. This is definitly a sipper. I am thankful that I have a few bottles left for me to enjoy!"
"D - This is beer is great. I'd rank this above Behemoth, and Old Guardian, but I don't think it's quite on the level of Olde School from DFH."
"Pours a clear reddish amber color with one finger of head that settled to a thin cap. Just a few spots of lacing is left on the glass. The aroma is rich and intoxicating. Hints of caramel, figs, a good dose of alcohol. Just a faint hint of oak and vanilla that I would probably miss if I did not read the label on the bottle. The flavor does not let me down after the outstanding aroma. Thick and chewy caramel and toffee. A little dark fruit as well. Alcohol makes its presence know but it is not overly hot or harsh. Bitterness is moderate but I do not pick up any hop flavor. The body is certainly thick enough and has a nice low carbonation. It coats the mouth nicely. This beer is a sipper and probably should be shaired. I should buy another bottle and let it age for awhile."
"Thanks to my buddy Jeremy for bringing this one over. Poured a golden amber with a dime thick head. A malt bomb with a sweet vanilla nose. We drank this one with a Cuban in hand and it was a perfect pair. Just the right amount of oak for a mild cigar."
"D- Wasn't sure what I was getting into with a barleywine, but was very pleased with my first. Surprisingly smooth with great balance throughout the beer. Thanks to my Scott for setting me up with this very nice beer!"
"I'll Say that this is either the 2nd or 3rd best barleywine I've ever had, similar in quality to FFF's Behemoth."
"Smooth in the finish, but sticky on the palate. The texture and flavors (especially that slight spiciness) gives Mirror Mirror a warming characteristic in the absence of alcoholic aroma or tastes. Looking forward to drinking my other bottle a year or two down the road."
"Impression: Every time I try this beer I like it more. Get it if you can, superb, delicious"
"Taste is nice and sweet, very rich and complex sweet and surprisingly drinkable, quite tasty. Carbonation is light which is perfect"
"22oz 2009 bomber poured into a snifter. It appeared a clear dark amber color with a finger of creamy brownish yellow stained head that has very good retension and laces in a spotty film around the glassware. Sweet aroma includes vanilla, hops, a bit of a mineral and metallic twang and a rush of alcohol. Taste is bitter upfront from the hops and the alcohol heat helps to exaggerate it. Slight mineral/metallic character incorporated in the body along with the bitter hop flavoring. Some sweet caramel and vanilla flavors are evident in the taste and throughout the body before a slight dry woodsy bitter presence rounds out the warming finish. Medium feel with a moderate level of carbonation. There is a lingering flavor of oak and hop bitterness left in the mouth that has some drying quality about it that encourages the next sip before your palate even as a chance to take in everything that is going on. The next sip returns the mixture of sweet/bitter/drying mesh off flavor. Overall this was very good and I could see this brew getting even bette with some more age. The best after date was a month ago: 4/20/10 and honestly it should be even later than that. Once the beer fully warms there are notes of dark brown sugar that is a bit residual if you can taste beyond the alcohol heat. Barleywine fans: this is a must try."
"The is easily one of the best American BWs that I've had so far. Ever so complex yet balanced(the key word for any Deschutes beer IMHO) The feel and body are near perfect. The bottle is already 1 year old, i can only dream of what it will become with more time. I better go to the bottle shop...now!"
"The mouthfeel is supurb, its a medium viscosity with a fine light and tight carbination, and doesn't leave your mouth feeling like you ate a spoonful of sugar. I am drinking this bomber solo and will slowly sip and enjoy this till the end."
"D - Overall, not my favorite Deschutes (or BW), but still damn good. The inconsistency between olfactory and gustatory is detracting."
"Overall, this is my first Deschutes beer, and I'm lucky to have it. This isn't your normal American Barley Wine, it's like a smooth, malt driven, cousin of it. An excellent treat that's good to the last drop."
"Drinkability is well above average for a barleywine due to the smooth texture. Of course, one bomber is plenty but it went down with ease."
"Drinkability - I did wait until the prescribed ""best after 4/30/10"" - really enjoyable barleywine that I would definitely have again- 4.5/5.0"
"Best after 4-20-10 opened early June 10.Burnt orange color. This beer has notes of cherry, candied orange, dark candy sugar, new oak, candied nuts, caramelized pineapple, booze, brown sugar, and molasses. It's sweet is what I'm saying. Medium-full bodied with a slightly syrupy texture. Pretty solid stuff. Almost too sweet for my taste."
"Very drinkable, one of the best American barleywines I have yet to encounter."
"D: A hell of a drinker for its weight."
"Drinkability: Really strong and not very drinkable. I know the ABV is very high, but this one hits you right away in a way that some stronger beers don't."
"Pours a nice coppery orange color with an amazingly creamy off white head, leaving nice sheets of lacing. Smell is a multitude of ingredients - dried and candied figs, prunes, apples, toffee and carmel, touches of vanilla, oak, earth and orange liqour. Taste is complex and well blended, the dried and candied fruits from the sscent are all pleasent, a sweet toffee and carmely taste and great sweet bready background and a nice floral hop presence, as well as vanilla and oak from the aging all combine to make a truly special beer. A slight boozy burn present at room temps. Full bodied and creamy smooth, only a touch of alcohol burn. Amazed at how easy it went down for an 11%. The craftsmanship screams belgian abbey quad."
"I loved this beer fresh, but it's better now. I recall a more astringent hop flavor a year ago, and I'm glad it has given way to more complexity."
"This beer tastes very hoppy, but in an aged not very tasty kinda way. The hop presence is mostly just bitter without contributing positively to the flavor profile. I don't see how any more age could improve this one."
"Overall a wonderful barley wine. Super easy drinking and so flavorful. I'm so glad I have a handful of bottles left. I look forward to what a couple years does for this stuff."
"The beer is a cloudy amber brown color with a nice tan head. Nice rich aroma of dark fruit, leather, oak, and some nice caramel malt notes. The flavor is of sweet caramel and oaky notes, with rich fig flavors with a warming slightly boozy feeling. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, with a nice malty, yet oily mouth coating. This is a fairly enjoyable and drinkable barelywine, though I wish I was able to try this a bit fresher, and hopefully I can pick up some more to try later on."
"(D)- A great barleywine that I have been looking forward to trying for some time. It has aged well and still will benefit for a good year yet. Has everything you would expect from the style; sweet & rich, but in a delicate, almost buttery way. Has a warmth that fits it. Thanks again for the generous Beerwolf77 for opening this one!"
"D - Good drinkability coming from the smooth mouthfeel and solid flavor profile. Dangerously drinkable at 11% and very well brewed. This is a pretty awesome barleywine. I've been looking forward to trying this and it didn't disappoint. Thanks again Todd!"
"Pretty darn drinkable for 11%, some hotter alcohols, growing on me as it gets closer to room temp."
"Drinkability: very tasty and surprisingly non-intense. It's smooth and extremely drinkable for a heady 11% brew. I don't have any more of this anymore, but if I did, I'd gladly drink it now."
"Poured into a chalice dark amber with a one finger white head. No lacing. Not much of a scent that my weak nose can tell. The taste is a strong carmel taste with a little bit of oak dryness. The mouthfeel is perfect for a Barleywine, and even better the alcohol is not even noticeable. Thanks to the aging. This is a very drinkable Barleywine, too bad it's so limited."
"Overall this was a really tasty American Barleywine that was fairly complex and easy to drink. Thanks again Esther! Recommended."
"D: This is a great beer overall. I think it will do pretty well aging, and would be a great beer for converting wine drinkers. Just a superbly drinkable barleywine, interesting enough for the hardest BA, but accessible for a novice."
"Drinkability: Excellent Barleywine overall, with some nice added complexity from the oak aging."
"(D) Was very satisfied with this beer. It was exceptional and I can't wait to try it again. The alcohol is very hidden and it's just an overall GREAT beer."
"D- Pretty well balanced and great tasting brew. I really enjoyed this one and if you get a chance go for it."
"Overall I was very impressed by this bad boy - I picked up a bottle while in LA last year and after tasting this I wish I'd picked up a few more as it will age nicely. Well worth a shot if you see it around."
"A decent beer. Not much more than that. For the price and pedigree, not what I was looking for."
"Mouthfeel is thick, malty, and syrupy, with a typical American barleywine level of carbonation. I opened this bomber all by myself for some reason. Not ideal, but manageable."
"Drinkability - Still a little bit hot after a year (damn, I wonder how this would have tasted a year ago...probably hot as hell). I have one more left and will most likely age it for at least another six months or until it starts to cool back down at nights here in Southern California. I haven't had a BW in a while but this one is pretty good."
"Pours a deep dark reddish hued brown with a fine head that has retained a nice lacing on top of the glass as it sits still magically untouched by my lips. What am I thinking sitting here waiting? I've been anticipating this moment for months! I opened one back in December... or was January? Either way, it was pretty darn tasty then, and I expect the best now. Citrus and floral scents rise to my nostrils with a hint of some fresh cut wood. Upon first taste I gain a nice juicy orange and spicy flower fading into a sweet hint of bourbon. Wow! Very nice! I can feel the carbonation bite my tounge a little and that lovely caramelized bourbon taste brings itself forward a bit more as I take my next swig. The 11% it claims on the bottle is not even noticed. This is sweet and refreshing! All too often I find barley wines to end up bitter and sour at the end, but this knows exactly how to maintain itself. This is much smoother than it was even a few months ago. You owe it to yourself to try a bottle of this. Buy one to try now, and buy another to age for another year and try again later, and hey, buy a third to age two years! I'm sure this will only get better with time!"
"d - I really liked this barleywine and think with a little more time on it it could have been even better. It's 11% ABV, but I barely tasted any and smelled none, so I think with another 6 months-1 year on it it could have been even better. Great caramel malt and oak smell and taste and would have again. Going to try and pick up another bottle to hold onto for a bit."
"Pours an amber color with a decent size tan head. Smell is lots of dark fruits, and caramel malt. Taste is sweet caramel malt, dark fruits, figs, raisons, plums, some oakiness, with a slight hop bitterness. Pushing full bodied mouthfeel. Overall a very well balanced barleywine."
"D- Had no problem drinking the bomber, but I wouldn't drink another one if I had one."
"Overall, a fine example of an American Barleywine from Deschutes. Do they ever produce anything that is bad? At least nothing I have sampled! Looking forward to sampling the 2005 vintage I have in the near future to see if age brings the malts more into the forefront."
"Overall, a very pleasant drinking experience. Sweet, figgy flavor balanced by slight hop bitterness, with very good color and presentation. I recommend trying it at least once."
"Pours amber and garnet red. Smells like caramel, toffee and a lot of sweet alcohol. Tastes sweet, with caramel and a little oakiness, with a sweet, quick alcohol burn finish. Perfect amount of carbonation and thick. Drinkability is good for a barley-wine, but it's definitely a sipper!"
"D= Not bad for the age. I was honestly expecting hell. I've had a few BWs with the one year on them and they have all been weird and bad. Two years is usually the minimum time for them for me. This wasn't bad. Too bad they took so long to come to MN I woulda loved to try this fresh. We'll see how it does with some more time."
"I'd get this again, but a little pricey."
"Overall, it is drinkable considering the ABV. Pretty nice."
"All in all, I am super glad that I got to try this beer. Perfect 5 year anniversary brew. Awesome balance of hops and malts! Definitely hunt this brew down whether you enjoy hops and / or malts. This is a very mass appealing brew. Definitely worth the hype."
"Overall, this is a good beer, a damn good one, but no where near the top of the class. If Gratitude is the CEO of the Barleywine Corporation, this beer is upper middle management. I'll drink again in a few months and see if anything magical happens on 4/20."
"Very nice beer over all, I am looking forward to getting a few more and aging them."
"The beer was very full bodied and had a large amount of carbonation which was too much for my personal preference. I really didn't find this particular example very drinkable mostly due to the huge amount of sweetness. I just felt really full after eight or so ounces."
"Overall - Barleywines aren't my favorite style but I'm thankful to have tried this its one of the better ones if tried"
"Drinkability: A delicious companion, and an interesting counterpart to other barleywines."
"Medium bodied, nicely carbonated, smooth and a pleasure to drink. I am glad to have Deschutes in Minnesota, and very happy they brought some Mirror Mirror into the State. I could drink this on a regular basis easily."
"D-this is not hot at all and not boozy at all. Big flavors and very well done. The 35% oak is very faint but hints of it showed up. The balance is tremendous as the hops have a definite place in this beer but it is still malt forward. The texture is so generous, rich, and creamy that it feels like dessert in my mouth."
"One of the best drinking barleywines I've had so far. Alcohol is very well-concealed. Excellent beer."
"D: Big beer. Alcohol is matched well with a wide range of bold flavor."
"D - Alchohol is very well hidden. Although 'thin', the complex flavor profile really help this one stand out."
"Must try! I am excited Deschuts is now in MN I really hope to see this as one of the beers in MN."
"A thick body for a clear brew and low carbonation. I cannot describe it as syrupy, but there is definitely more than a Medium mouthfeel to this Barleywine. I hesitated to think that it is an American Barleywine as there is not an overwhelming amount of bitterness, but a pleasant hop presence that you may forget is there with the strong malt backbone and barrel presence."
"Over all a solid BW. I enjoyed this one very much with it's malty sweetness that isn't too sweet. Solid"
"Expensive, but well worth the price!!!!"
"Notes: Bottle says 'best after' date which is about a year away, but I disagree. I think this is spot on now, and a year might actually dull the hops down a bit too much, especially since it's already on the sweeter side of things. Guess I'll have to hoard one and find out. Overall, this is kind of an odd barleywine for coming from the hop-head world of the west coast. This is more in line with an English Barleywine than an American one."
"Medium bodied, with very light carbonation, soft and creamy on the tongue. Flavor begins with mild oaky and woody notes before the strong malt backbone provides a strong sweet body. Lots of caramel and biscuit with the ripe fruits and figs from the aroma. Mild citrus and hop flavor in the finish, along with sweet booziness, but a year seems to have smoothed out any bitterness or alcohol burn. The oak provides a nice subtle flourish to this, without being distracting. Very complex and nicely balanced, a pleasant sipping barleywine."
"I was not impressed by this Reserve beer from Deschutes but that is a first. I had this back in December and did not review it but remembered it fondly. Revisiting it I was excited but ultimately let down. For $12 there is very little value in this offering and I will recommend everyone to avoid it. I have had better $4 bombers of Barley wine that I enjoyed more. Deschutes is still top notch in my eyes but perhaps the best after April 2010 date was a little misguided."
"Poured a nice deep amber color, good carbonation with a small white head. Nose is malty, caramel and bown sugar. Taste is sweet-brown sugar, well hopped, ABV is disguised, has a very smooth, sherry like feel, so smooth and balanced. Mouthfeel is exceptional and medium bodied but very good overall. Mouthfeel is well balanaced and tasty. EXCEPTIONAL barleylywine!"
"D - A tasty NW barleywine - I am really jazzed that I got to try this. I was in Washington a few years ago but missed having this. The barleywine is drinkable as it can be for 11%, but not something I would drink in repeated servings with almost 1 year on this bottle it was a pleasure to taste - one of the best I have had in the style."
"A barleywine that doesn't really taste as heavy nor as strong as barleywines usually taste... Don't worry though, that's a good thing!! A nice aroma coming from the inch of head from my small tulip glass. Feels awesome going down and tastes wonderful. I couldn't drink too many of these as they do pack a punch..."
"D: I've got a few more bottles of this; I'm just going to age them long-term (several years) and see where they go. Right now they're not doing all that well. I liked the beer substantially better fresh."
"I'll be honest, I was pretty excited for this beer and it dissapointed me in almost every way. I can't help but wonder if I got a bad bottle? It just doesn't seem right. Alas..."
"This is a great Barleywine and ranks among the best I've had. However, I regret opening this bottle very much. After I popped the cap I noticed a small stamp on the side of the label that says, ""Best after 4/20/10", I'm two months early. I would have loved to try it later in the summer after it has a chance to mellow a little more but my anticipation of trying this was just too tempting. Oh well, next time I purchase multiple bottles and age them."
"I didn't wait until 4/20/10 as recommended but it was still very nice."
"Rich on the palate with impeccable balance and class. A touch sweet with some tree fruit and fig flavors persisting on the long finish. Wonderful finish and balance. The bottle went way too quickly."
"I remember loving this beer when I first sipped it, but I couldn't have told you why (and at the time, I was mostly only able to handle very light, citrusy, summery beers). Now that I've tasted it again, I definitely LOVE this brew. It's complex and drinkable. Sweet and delicate, yet it's still a beast. Mmmm!"
"This is a very complex and well brewed beer. (It's amazing the difference between their year round releases and their reserve releases! Hey they can make B+ish year round beers all they like if they keep making beer of this stature!!) Good job !"
"Overall I have to admit I was a little let down by this one. I was hoping for something truly memorable but it left me kind of lacking. Maybe some time will bring it around."
"D. Extremely drinkable. Very smooth. One of the best Barley wines I have had. Might be even better with some more age."
"D- Pretty high. Really enjoyed this one.. can't really find any faults in it... great all the way around. Very excellent barleywine."
"I forgot how good this beer was. Maybe it tastes better when you're drinking with Deschutes Larry."
"D-Harsh beer,needs time to mature and damn will that be great?!!?"
"...and the walls stand straight up and down and beer is all there is. (Charles Bukowski)."
"A really great barleywine, not too cloying with a lot of great flavors melded together. I was hoping for some more hops, but this may have been an older bottle. I'm very curious as to how this will age, but i think its terrific already. I still havn't had a beer from Deschutes i didn't like."
"D- went down easier than any barleywine i've ever tasted (old guarduan, bigfoot, old crustacean, etc.)"
"o: smooth and balanced (but not a typical balance, unique and refined), alcohol roughens as it warms, generally slightly worse at room temp, initial impression better than final, hops are mild, alc is young and rough, balance lost with warmth, alaskan and bigfoot are better, maybe a bit young"
"The beer poured a deep, slightly hazey reddish amber with creamy tan head. Rich aroma of citrus, sweet malt, fragrant fruity hops, notes of oak, caramel, and dark fruits. The taste is intense with dark fruitiness, hints of chocolate, caramelized malts in the background and alcohol up front. After-taste is a mix of sweetness and hops bitterness. Mouthfeel is velvety smooth and crisp with medium body and medium carbonation. Great brew from Deschutes Brewery. Very tasty and easy to drink."
"D - This is rich and meant to be consumed slowly, but I'd love to have this one around instead of just once or twice a year."
"drinkability is good. it's very well balanced and hides its alcohol incredibly well. quite tasty, but didn't have quite as much depth as i expected. i'll have to keep my eye out for an earlier vintage or one i can stash away in the cellar for a while to see how it changes."
"Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with low carbonation, some warmth going down, but pretty damn smooth considering the ABV. Nice stuff, glad I have another bottle."
"A very balanced Barleywine. I'd prefer a blend which favored a larger barrel percentage, but there's plenty of subtle comlexities here. I can't really see this one improving much in the cellar though. Some of traces of the barrel aging will probably fade as will the hops."
"2009 bomber poured into a Portsmouth Tulip. Pours a rich brownish red color with a thin off white head. Smells very sweet, candied yams, brown sugar etc. Taste is not as sweet- the beer has some teeth, but malty sugar dominates. But is is not cloying sweet. The sweetness helps the beer become much more drinkable. Just a silky smooth mouthfeel with a bit of alcohol touch to warm me up. A wonderfully put together barleywine- probably the easiest drinking one I have ever had."
"Bottle: Poured a deep amber color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and minimal lacing. Aroma of sweet malt with deep caramel malt notes and some hoppy grassy notes as well. Taste is also dominated by loads of sweet malt with a nice caramel touch and some hoppy notes with light citrus notes and a grassy feels. Body is above average with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Very well done though a bit more hoppy then what I usually like in my barley wine."
"2009 vintage. Pours with a one cm head which fades quickly. Smells fairly sweet. Dark amber in color. Taste is a nice mix of sweet, malt, and hops. Still a little boozy which should settle with tme. Reminds me of a less sweet Old Guardian. I have another two bottles which I will age & I am curious how this will settle in time."
"22oz. wax sealed bottle. 2009 vintage. Bottle conditioned. Served in a snifter. Pours a deep amber with a thin off white head. Piney hop aroma with some carmelized sugar and dark fruit as it warms. Full bodied and warming. Definitely on the malty side. Fair amount of malt sweetness, but the hops provide some balance. Hop bitterness comes out as it warms. Very drinkable for the ABV."
"M/D - very smooth & creamy, by far the easiest drinking barleywine i've had. all around a great tasting beer"
"D- Very drinkable for the style. Have a couple more sitting in the cellar for later dates. Everything came together vary nicely in this BW. Would recommend to anyone."
"2009 vintage. Pours dark amber with a white head. Aroma is caramel, dark fruit, alcohol and some oak character. The flavor is strong caramel malt with some alcohol. A very sweet tasting beer. You get some hop bitterness but not enough to cut the sweetness. Very smooth drinking with a medium mouthfeel."
"an awesome beer of a style i've yet to come to love - one of the best i've had"
"-again, it is pretty good, but i was expecting more from a deschutes specialty series and i feel like i gave it a fair chance"
"D: The 11% ABV is hidden very well, but makes this less drinkable than most brews."
"Highly recommended."
"D- Very easy to drink and balanced but not quite as interesting as I was expecting."
"overall, this isn't a great barleywine and probably one I would skip unless you're a huge abw fan."
"Very nice. Definitely worth a try."
"Dark amber body minimal head. Sweetish nose with noticeable alcohol. Very well balanced, the prolonged barrel aging has really mellowed the hop presence. Vanilla up front, a bit of chocolate, and a pretty malty profile. Smooth mouthfeel, A truly great example of the style, and what prolonged barrel aging can contribute to beers. While a bit potent for everyday consumption, quite drinkable for style. Very highly recommended."
"Overall- Although I prefer more hops in my barleywines, I think this one would benefit from some laying down time."
"Drinkability - I love a barleywine that tastes great fresh and aged. This one was superb, looking forward to trying one of these in '11 or '12."
"D - Although not fully matured (at least that's what the bottle indicated), this proved to be quite a drinkable English-style barleywine."
"Mouthfeel is pretty voluptuous and slinky with perfect amount of carbonation. Phenomenal beer here. Best barleywine in a long time. Deschutes is making some of the best beers and I wish I had better access to them. Highly recommended."
"Overall a good beer, but seems to be clearly not ready, as the brewers indicate with the ""Best after"" date on the bottle. Young, good, but shows signs of great potential."
"D: As big as the barleywine tastes, it doesn't feel like an 11% or so ale. That's good and bad. Good for one glass but bad if I'm trying to get through more than one."
"22 oz. 2009. Cloudy brown pour, just some light cream colored head. Malty, fig and caramel, ash aromas, just a hint of pine and bourbon. Taste is nice malty caramel, toffee, vanilla and oak. Scattered around are molasses, yellow raisin, charcoal and pine. Finish is some bitter hops and charry oak barrel. I just can't go quite above 4 on the taste yet. A few years should make this even more interesting. Smooth mouth, good carbonation. Drinkability is fine for such a large beer, but this is pretty warm yet. Maybe a little closer to English style."
"This beer pours a copper color with a small head that falls quickly and doesn't leave much lacing on the glass. The aroma has a moderate US hop character, but it's not overpowering. It also smells of caramel malts and alcohol. The flavors are a mix of alcohol, bready malts and a touch of US hops. Again, the hops aren't the star here. The finish is pretty sweet and there isn't a ton of bitterness in there. This is a pretty nice beer."
"D - Too big to session, but I would try. Delightfully surprised by this beer!"
"Overall, a very solid barleywine at a great pricepoint. Not as good as my favorite barleywine so far (Gratitude) but much more accessible and reasonably priced. Picked it up if you get the chance."
"The drinkability of this brew suffers slightly due to its incredibly sweet nature, though the luscious mouthfeel makes you want more. I imagine it might tone down and gain a more refined edge with some aging, but right out of the gate it makes for a fine brew."
"Overall, a nice barlywine. I would really like to age this one and see what happens to it. I really enjoyed the added oak flavors to the style."
"D- Fresh and at 11% ABV this baby is a bruiser! Has all of the great young barleywine flavors with enough alcohol to really stand some aging. Its too bad I don't have another one..."
"Overall: This beer is a great one. Worht the price. I will but it again if I see it."
"The body is closer to full than moderate but there is a nice chewiness that helps that out. Would like a bit more complexity but is ok (and should see after some time). Carbonation is good. Overall a good beer now with the fruity notes, but the hop character is missing. So I guess I will have to see this review again in three years."
"D - This is a pretty good barleywine. I don't know if it lives up to the hype. I'd like to try one that has aged a little longer."
"Bottle courtesy of tpd975. Pours clear copper with gold edges and off white head. The aroma is yummy sweetness with malts, some caramel and a mild level of dark fruity esters. A big draw brings up malt stickiness, grassy hops and a hint of booze heat. The taste is caramel, malts, some mild spice, earthiness and grassy hops. The maltiness and caramel sweetness grow to midway before hop bitterness and a light sense of booze help bring this to closure. Interesting interpretation without the solid dark fruitiness of an English BW or the hoppy bite of an American BW. Should age nicely."
"Drinks easy for the style & ABV, another winner from Deschutes. If tour looking for a hoppy in your face barley wine, this ain't it, but I love the malt backbone & balance on this"
"The body is as expected for the style, perhaps a little fuller. Drinkabilty is very good for the style. I suggest drinking this now, I don't anticipate this version improving with age. Try it now."
"Two bottles in the cellar waiting to find out..."
"D=good enjoyable beverage with nice smell, taste and aromas"
"Overall this is a great, but not perfect, barley wine. I'll have to do another review after I age this for awhile and see how it improves."
"overall impression- disappointed, i almost think the beer is flat even though it was just purchased, very mediocre. i've had this beer at barleywine festivals and had a different opinion...maybe it doesn't translate in the bottle."
"D: Very nice considering how young it is. I'd love to revisit this after the ""Best After"" date. It will only get better with time."
"This beer is good, but not great. I like a good balanced barleywine, and this fits the bill , but the booze is too disjointed. I don't mind a big alcohol flavor but when it blends well. This is too separate from the rest of the flavors. I don't taste the alcohol instill the end of the finish and that that point its just too much."
"Drinkability is good for the style. It's not thick and dehydrating, but there are others more interesting that you will gulp down much faster. A great beer and I'm loving it now...will try again after 4-20-10 to see what the brewer's recommendation tastes like. Cheers!"
"D: easy to drink but better to share"
"Nice burgundy amber color. Moderate head with a bit of frothy ret and spotty lace. Nice alcoholic malts, not too heavy. Plenty of controled dark fruits, not too potent. Some spicy yeast in the back. Not much barrel. Nice malt complexity with plenty of the fruits mixed in. Some hop presence but controlled like and English version. Body is medium full with subdued carbo. Pretty drinkable for 11% and will age nicely."
"A true sipper that you have to let warmup. Good beer."
"Drink ability is above average. I really like the flavors the barrel aging imparts to this beer. On the other hand the carbonation took away from the beer, and the lack of head retention did too. This beer is good but I have had abunch of other barleywines that were better. That being said, I am looking forward to cellaring one for a year and seeing how it progresses."
"This BW should definitely be drunk at a warmer temperature to allow the ingredients ample time to shock and amaze. Some cellaring may do this some good and luckily I have one left so we'll see what happens over time."
"Pours a lighter ice tea color with a stiff two finger light tan foamy head that fades fairly quickly, leaving partial sheets of Belgian lacing behind. It lacks the visual substance of my favorite BWs. The smell is unique and unexpected...a little on the timid side and...corn (maybe?). I'm confused, but anyway there is a suggestion of a sweet attempt at butterscotch, but it doesn't get there. Some what less typical to style. The mouth feel is tangy with 11% ABV, but the heat isn't the main thing here. While there is a little peppery ""burn", it does come off with a smoothness...a couple of notches less than creamy. Full flavored, its all about being sweet with a peppery character. I get a malty 'white birthday cake' thing and slivers of caramel, but not the classic American Barleywine expression. A little disappointing to be honest. go for it bros. Quite 'drinkable for being 11%"". This is not a community 'shocker' by any means."
"This is unquestionably one fine barleywine. I wanted to save it until the recommended consumption date, but without trying it fresh there would be no point for reference. I will definitely have to grab another bottle now and lay on it for a while!"
"Deschutes is a hell of a brewery, that is climbing my 'personal faves' list fairly quickly."
"The beer is well carbonated and pretty approachable for such a heavy bodied barley wine. The alcohol heat makes it a sipper, but a very pleasant sipper. I am happy to have another bottle of this in the cellar to see what it's like a in a year or two."
"Drinkability is good, not amazing, but very respectable for the style. A slow sipper that doesn't wear overly on the palate. A bit hot still, but not too bad in the grand scheme of things."
"D: You wouldn't normally think of a barleywine as drinkable, but this beer is just so complex and delicious."
"Deschutes released the 2009 Reserve Mirror Mirror this passed week. This very age worthy barley wine was born of a double batch of Deschutes popular Mirror Pond Pale Ale. On the bottle it says ""Best after 04/20/2010"" and they are right it definitely needs to settle down in order to get the full experience. When I drank this 11% ABV monster my mouth was filled with flavors of caramely hops which leads into a enormous malty base with hints of citrus and oak both on the nose and on the palate. If you can keep your hands off of it defintely wait and age this beer and with the ungodly amount of wax covering it may take you a year to open it."
"Drinkability: Hot damn. A stellar brew, and one that - even though I wasn't sure I was going to be in the mood for it tonight - near 'bout floored me. Complex - with a solid foundation, an inspired hop profile, and nuanced and well-integrated barrel components - but still accessible. There's not too much wrong with this one, and though it is 11% abv (and I'm growing near tipsy as I finish this one up at 1:45 am), the alcohol is warm, never hot, and well-blended, never distracting or ""laying atop"" the brew, as it were. Another winner from a brewery that rarely disappoints, a fine and fitting addition to the Reserve series, and one I'd be glad to have again and again (perhaps with a pungent chunk of Roquefort or Stilton). Stellar."
"It was almost blasphemy to drink it this young, but I'm glad I bought more than one. It pours a rich mahogany, almost garnet in color, with a nice creamy head that clings to the walls of the glass. Aromas are citrusy, resinous hops, followed by massive amounts of brown sugar, fig, a bit of pineapple, and toffee. Flavors are immense. Beginning with fruity, floral hop characters, an onslaught of malt notes come through. Caramel, fig, candi sugar, pineapple, citrus, you name it, and it's there. The beer finishes just slightly oaky, balanced out with a bitter hop note. MM has one of the best mouthfeels I have experienced in a barleywine. Full bodied, resinous, and downright sexy. For it's strength and body, it's very drinkable. It wouldn't be hard for me to enjoy a couple bombers in one night."
"This Barleywine is too good to pass up. I would drink this beer any chance I get regardless of the season. Its that damn good. Deschutes, my hats off to you! Cheers!"
"Nice flavors, big date, fig, caramel, toffee. Prune on the finish, very bitter earthy hops at the end with some tannic oak. Not overly complex. Does show some wood and whiskey."
"Deep copper color with a reddish tint and a fuzzy off white head that sticks around forever. Toffee, caramel, brown sugar and a touch of citrus in the nose. Smells like it will be sweet but as I press the glass to my lips it isn't. The citrus hop and alcohol bite definitely keep the sweetness in check. Still some brown sugar, toffee, caramel pierce through. The taste is incredible, I'm glad I bought more than one of these. Light carbonation, medium to thin body, sticky, oily mouthfeel. About the only thing I could fault is a bit of lack of body, but I could live with that. Great Barley Wine."
"Notes: With a little oxidation, this one will be absolutely epic. I can see myself sitting on this for a long time."
"D: Very drinkable, especially for the style.  A solid offering and one I return to on a regular basis. (4.25)"
"Beer is very drinkable especially for a barlywine with the punch this has. Very enjoyable"
"For an 11%er this isn't bad at all. I wouldn't rate it too high as far as wanting another bottle right after finishing this one though."
"D: To date this is my favorite barleywine. Very easy to drink with a nice punch. #180."
"Despite being paired with the best pretzel I ever had and my first visit to Stone's bistro, I can't give this any higher marks. Perhaps it was the more restrained approach to the style. I will have to revisit eventually."
"D- Would drink again, however, at the hefty price tag and richness it's best enjoyed on a special occasion."
"I really enjoyed this beer as, even relatively fresh, had a solid but not overpowering hop presence that deferred to the big sweet malt and fruit backbone. Very drinkable for the ABV."
"Sweet (but not too), thick, and just perfectly balanced. Indulgent, yet refined. Like a posh library."
"Would additional cellar time help this beer? It will surely smooth the flavor a bit, but a good offering right now nonetheless."
"/// Ehhh... I'm not wowed by this one. Over-hyped? I'd say so. Rusty and kinda boring. Underdone hop profile. Not worth the money. 3.0"
"Pours a thick, viscous orange with a tiny head to start that fades to nothing. Nice aromas of sweet malt, lots of bitter citrus, and a nice accent of oak- but the oak is not overdone. Similar flavors as the aroma. Nice honeyed malt with balnced citrus and pine bitterness and just enough oak to provide a nice base. Smooth, obviously big, but easy to drink. Lovely"
"This is an excellent brew for sipping. The alcohol level is quite pronounced and seems even higher than advertised. This brew almost lives up to the fable rhyme it's name suggests and is one of the great contemporary craft beers."
"I was not sure how this beer would be. It is a barleywine, so I expected an alcohol bomb. I was very surprised that it wasn't! Fresh: This is a good beer, but I can't wait to see how it tastes in a year!"
"Reviewed on 06/21/2009. Bottle. This beer pours a clear brown with a small head. The aroma is of raisin, caramel, toffee, and sweet malt. The flavor is of sweet caramel malt. The flavor is decent but the palate is too sticky and sweet. This was just ok for me."
"I had this beer at the Beer fest in Seattle. The beer was excellent, I had four ounces of it, the taste was good, I liked the way it looked, I could actually picture myself drinking it, which was good. Also the mouth feel was good, it was a little odd in the mouth taste, but I think that might have been from the way it was served."
"Deschutes Mirror Mirror is a very clear, dense, red ale with a thin, dense, light khaki head that shows great retention and lacing. It has a woodsy, piny aroma. The hops are stronger than the malt in the nose. There's a light note of toffee. It's full bodied, smooth and fluffy until the dry, astringent finish comes. It tastes pretty sweet, but it's well balanced with a wooden, resiny, oaken bitterness. It's quite drinkable."
"22 ounce black wax dipped bottle purchased at Beverage Warehouse for $12.99 a few days ago, 2009 vintage, have also tried the 2005 in the past, currently drinking from my Grottenbier goblet, color is a very deep copper with some ruby red tint, 1 ½ inch frothy tan head that stays around for almost ten minutes, great lacing at first but none later, aroma consists of oak, peaches, sweet malts, mild whiskey, alcohol, grassy accents, mellow spice, caramel, toffee, floral accents, and raisins, flavor starts off with caramel and other rich malts right off the bat, some honey and grassy flavors in the middle, some hoppiness in the finish but is mostly oak and warmth from the booze that you get, creamy, boozy, malty, and rich mouthfeel, medium to full bodied, pretty mellow carbonation, taste lingers long, I will probably polish off this bottle myself, it is lighter for a barleywine, has a nice hop presence to balance the malts and rich alcohol, has a nice smoothness, especially as it continues to warm up, good drinkability, will drink more of this in the future, although it is not along the lines of Abyss, it is one of Deschutes' better beers, recommended"
"Had this on tap at the Bier Stein as well as from a bottle poured into a glass goblet. Wow. You can smell this thing from a foot away. It pours out with a deep reddish-brown color and a nice foamy white head. The smell is earthy and oaky, but at the same time fruity, as of cherries or cranberries. The taste is amazing...so many different types of malts, but it's ultimately very fruity and mainly I taste cherry...though there is a sweeter and deeper undertone there as well. You can barely taste the alcohol, making this one of the most drinkable barelywines I've ever encountered. None of that gagging, pure ethanol, or overwhelming ripe fruit taste going on here that one can often get with a barelywine. I'd even drink this in a season that's not winter, that's how good it is. Great great stuff."
"All in all a very good beer that I'm hoping will improve with age. I have a couple others stashed, & no one will be touching them until the ""best after"" date."
"D: Flavorful and interesting. Goes to 11 (% abv) makes it a good beer to share."
"A basic, error free Barleywine that is wonderfully balanced on all fronts. A huge malt foundation lays the ground work with strong toffee, caramel, and molassas flaovrs. The texture rides the fence of sweet-syrupy and dry-malty. Fruity esters bring out juicy plumbs, dates, grapes, figs and dried fruits of prunes and raisons. With the malt sweetness the fruits take on a fruitcake taste and complexity. Rum-like alcohols give an aggressive power to the beer but never dominates with fusal or harshness. Hop flavor has a mild herbal taste, but ultimately is used as a bittering agent against the malts. The malt, fruit, and hop character gives the same impression from nose to finish with a long, lingering malt taste. A supurb Barleywine that should age well from years."
"4.5 D: This is by far the most drinkable barleywine. It is jam packed with flavor, but doesn't have that cloying sensation like many other barleywines."
"D: Very tasty. Very balanced. A bit warm, but this should mellow wonderfully with age. Well done Deschutes."
"Taste is fairly creamy, soft carbonation, good malt backbone with hints of oak and vanilla, the heat isn't as strong as it was in the aroma but I can imagine with that additional year on this it would be even better."
"Had a snifter of the 2005 in early May, and it was transcendent. Is this younger version equally awesome? Oh yeah, definitely...it tastes simply excellent now, but I guess it'll be excellent in a different way after April 20, 2010."
"M/D: the brew is smooth but feels sugary on the tongue and coats the mouth. Although sweet it is more drinkable than normal barleywines."
"D. A very tasty beer, but at $12 a bomber my drinkability score cannot go above a 4. At 11% abv. this is definately a good choice for sharing. A beer I would definately recommend to try."
"D: Give it a year and I imagine it could be something out of this world. Would like to trade so that I might be able to rerate this beer again."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with good carbonation."
"d: Wow, and they say this is best after april 2010? I'm glad I have a couple of bottles for the cellar. One of the best b-wines I've had in a long time."
"09 and feelin fine! What a lame way to start a review. Pours clear and dar ruby in color, rocky off-white head. Good retention and lacing. Smell is a very sweet, boozy, citric, and fruity bonanza. Very complex and unique. Taste is a blend of booze, pineapple, pear, apple, sweet malt, and some candi sugar. Again, incredible intense and complicated. A very smooth warming effect as it goes down. Slightly fuller body, but not too bad. Overall an amazing beer. The alcohol, though present, is a great aspect of this beer. I'm curious to see how my other bottle tastes in a year or two."
"M + D: A richer body, thick and even a little 'clinging' without being syrupy. The alcohol warms the throat more as the beer itself is given time to warm, and makes for a very pleasing drinking experience. Considering the content, iit's amazingly smooth and easy to drink. Quite an exceptional beer from an exceptional brewery. Very nicely done, and I hope I can come across more of it."
"J"
"Pours a beautiful deep amber color with a hint of brown that is brilliant in clarity. Not much head is built up nor retained. Appears to have very low carbonation. Hint of chocolate on the aroma, maybe a hint of cherry. Flavors of fig, plum and chocolate. Wonderful flavor and well balanced. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy, a bit of astringency on the finish. With age this is going to be magnificent. Very good, highly recommended."
"Although this beer is somewhat hot right now, it is still quite drinkable. Strong and alcoholic right now, this should mellow quite beautifully with a little age. SO happy to have quite a few more of these on hand."
"Drinkability: Take this one slow, because the alcohol will sneak up on you. A great selection to share with some friends after dinner."
"Bomber. Ugh, the annoying waxed cap. Pours a warm mahogany with a frothy tan head. Thick lacing. Caramel and candied fruits in the nose. A bit of port and wood, along with boozy sugar. Heavy, full mouthfeel with nearly no carbonation. Long, sticky finish. Very sweet and boozy taste. Sugary, caramel/molasses flavors dominate. Background of oak and candy. A piney hop flavor comes in the finish. Was rough at first, but smoothed out as it warmed. The 11% is as masked as it can be, but you do feel the full brunt of the alcohol early on."
"Whew. What a beer. I've barely made a dent in the glass and already I'm overwhelmed by it. Big and rich, heavy and boozy. This needs to be sipped from a port glass or a snifter, there's no go to be drinking this by the pint. Very rich, very heavy, very sweet, very boozy. You have been warned."
"Thanks to fishdawg71 for hooking me up with this one in a trade. I poured from a 22 ounce 2009 vintage bomber into a snifter. It pours a deep caramel with red highlights, slight white head, minimal lacing. The aroma is of dark, candied fruit. The flavor is very sweet, dark fruit hints predominate, minimal bitterness. The alcohol is there but is well hidden. It is a medium bodied beer that is meant to be sipped. The brewer recomends cellaring it for a year, but I think it is pretty tasty now."
"overall I would definately recommend as a solid barley wine."
"Pours deep ruby amber with tan head. Nose is delightful mix of chocolate candied oranges at Christmas, miscellaneous dark fruit, and soft malt. Alcohol is somewhat masked on the palate, and the body is very smooth/creamy, as it brings forth a rich malt sweetness with dessert-like hoppy candy flavors to balance it out. This one is on the sweeter, softer side - which is what I prefer."
"This is an odd review, to be sure. Cheers!"
"Overall, very nice though a bit young - looking forward to this in a year or five."
"Not overly malty, not overly hoppy, not even all that intense, but damn near the realm of Baby Bear's porridge of just right, one of the smoothest and enjoyable Barleywines I've tasted, it tends to pack a whollap more in hindsight than at the present time. I can't necessarily say that this is worth the hefty price tag, but that cash has already been laid down, and I enjoyed the ride all the same."
"A very slight tan head disintegrates quickly leaving a bubbly lace and a thin, transparent covering on top of the dark brown brew. Closer inspection reveals some orange and cherry red hues. Smells of very sweet malts mixed with sweet and sour cherries, earthen pine, grain and hops in the background. Tastes of more sweet malts and cherries with a profound and invigorating alcohol heat enveloping it all. Moving on we get some subtle hops, candy (licorice, red-hots, butterschotch), and a grain and pine base. The sweeter notes are prevalent, but work themselves into the mix well. Lies medium to heavy and goes down a bit rocky. The Barleywine is quickly becoming my favorite style, almost trumping the Tripel (but not quite yet) and this is one more exceptional example to add to the ""file under darn good Barleywine"" list."
"D - yes, very drinkable, i could go another..."
"Best bottle presentation- this and DBA. Pours a nice amber with some nice head that fades to a great lace. Smell is sweet, floral and surprisingly light for a barleywine. The oak is definitely there as well. Taste is exceptional! Smooth caramel, sweet, and floral fading to an easy hop with lots of oak. I pick up on the smoke as well. Extremely smooth! Fades to an easy hop and crisp toffee. So smooth. Most drinkable barleywine I've had. Not a ton of hops but extremely flavorful. Alcohol is well hidden. Just a great beer- can't wait to have one with time on it!"
"Mouthfeel is dense and slightly sticky. Surprising mellowness but full body make it very drinkable brew. Very enjoyable!"
"Body is great, finishes hot. Not quite harsh, but not quite drinkable. Pretty nice."
"D: This beer is so complex, and dangerously good. I look forward to cracking open my bottles in a year or so."
"Another awesome addition to the Deschutes Reserve Series. I can't wait to see how this evolves over the course of a year or two."
"overall this is a beautiful beer. I am very happy to have a few to cellar. worth every penny."
"D- good beer overall but i refuse to go beyond these ratings because this beer has so much growing to do. it needs time on it but a damn fine barleywine to say the least. bravo deschutes!"
"Excellent, excellent, excellent!"
"overall a very decent barleywine, needs a little more in the noise, but well made none the less."
"Overall a very nice, clean, american barleywine from deschutes. I remember the 2005 one being a bit better, but this is still a fine beer. I think this beer would be AMAZING on cask. Prime cask candidate if you ask me. Anyway, pick some up, its a very enjoyable barleywine."
"Pours a brilliant burgandy that glows in the snifter with a fine white head that laces the glass beautifully. Aroma has dried fruit (figs, apricots, raisins), some earthy hops and a touch of booze and oak. The flavor has tart dried fruit, brown sugar and hints of oak with a earthy bitterness that lasts. Its medium-bodied and very sticky. Coats your mouth with every sip and extremely enjoyable. Very balanced for being such a young Barleywine."
"Most of the hops have broken down in the 2005, leaving a barleywine of heightened sweetness whose concealment of its 11.5% ABV makes it dangerously drinkable. I'd urge anyone to get as much of the 2005 as they can. The 2009 however, still needs time."
"'09 in May '09 4.5/4/4.5/4.5/4"
"Drinkability- I'll finish this bomber myself, but it'd be better shared at this point. There's nothing really wrong with MM, but it's just boring and unrefined right now. I shouldn't have any trouble leaving my bottles in the cellar alone for a few years."
"D: hard to compare to the bottle I had week ago (I know I shouldn't). I really think the bottle of '09 exuded many fresher flavors, mostly in the hop category. The '09 is not as cloying sweet and rich, it has a better hop-cutter flavor in the mix. Don't get me wrong; both are great, I just found myself wishing for a bigger hop presence in the '05. In any event this is just absolute top notch stuff"
"The beer is medium bodied with good carbonation (on tap of course). I have a few bottles of this and I can't wait to watch the hops fade and the malt become more complex as this big beer ages."
"This is a phenomenal barleywine that will get even better with age. While bourbon and brandy barrel aging might be the hot new thing in barleywines (among other styles), I prefer Mirror Mirror's classic barleywine flavors and clean, unflavored oak subtleties. Apologies for a fairly gushing review and this final comment, but Mirror Mirror is the fairest barleywine of all for me. Time to go buy a case before it's all gone."
"Drinkability overall is good right now, it's the style of beer meant to be aged and savored over time however if you have access to it right now I would suggest getting some baseline data for your experimentation. The only way to age a beer is to periodically sample it and this is the type of beer that you shell out for the whole case and think about it at a later date. Great young barleywine that will bring out more depth in the next few years."
"The pine bitterness is a bit acrid, and could do with some mellowing. If they're going to go the uberhopped american barleywine route, I would have preferred a more balanced hop profile."
"Glad I got a full case plus one of the first batch left."
"Bottle says ""Best After 4/20/10."" I'm not sure if I'll ever get the chance to try this again, and while I'd love to age it, I want to try it now. Pours a nice dark amber color with a small off-white head that was about a half inch in height, but receded quickly to a thin film, but left some spotty lacing. Aroma is boozy, reminiscent of brandy, a hint of woodiness some dark and ripe fruits, very sweet smelling but also very well balanced by the piney smelling hops. This smells fantastic. Flavor is loaded with caramel malts, brown sugar coated apples, over-ripe fruit, some buttery oak, brandy, a touch of bubblegum on the finish, and loads of warming alcohol. Yeah, this probably would do well with some age on it, but it's damn delicious as it is. Hop bitterness is perfectly balanced with the sweetness. Not overly sweet, and not overly bitter. Just right for a barleywine. Everything is integrated seamlessly. Medium mouthfeel, leaning on syrupy, but not quite there, lots of warming alcohol all the way down the throat. This is a fantastic version of a barleywine. Perfectly balanced and yummy. I do think this will really be a grand slam with a year of age on it, but I will savor every last drop of this fresh bottle. Thanks go out to washburnkid for sending this one my way!"
"This is a nice BW. Can't decide if this would be better in the spring or winter. Either way, darn fine"
"Inventory issues aside, this version of Mirror Mirror spent an extra year in the oak, and has picked up WAY more of the wood's ashy, vinous qualities. The flavor is intense -- I get hints of cigarettes and a bit of balsamic in nose that makes me think this one's seen the first signs of infection. The hops are all but gone, replaced by sweet, fruity malt: port, white wine, blackberry syrup, prunes. Medium carbonation in a gloriously creamy body. It's smooth and pretty complex, but the flavor's heavy and syrupy."
"A very pleasant sipper. Nice touch of sweetness. Getting some of that smoky, oak flavor. I could see myself getting this again. It really does feel like I'm sipping on some cognac or some type of liqueur, just not quite as alcoholic and with more carbonation."
"D- This is a perfect sipping beer and very drinkable for its abv, richness and fullness."
"D: For a barleywine the drinkability is very good. The palate isn't bombarded with hops creating a smoother drink. This is quite good now, but could be amazing in 5 years when the sweetness concentrates and the hops die down a bit. It could rival an aged JW Lee's in my opinion, which is saying something."
"I don't know what I was expecting, but this isn't it. Anyway, I'm a sucker for any kind of peach and apricot flavors, the peachiness in this meshes very well with the oak, I'm enjoying it, and I look forward to trying it aged."
"Overall: A great beer...not crazy good. Cheers!"
"D - Not bad. Still needs a year or two of cellaring to minimize the hop bitterness."
"Clear reddish brown liquid served with no foam filled up to the brim of a little 8oz shaker pint glass. Can't catch a whole lot of aroma because the glasses Stone uses suck but I did get that barleywine malty sweetness. A little bit of fruit in the aroma. Thick malty body with a really nice flavor. Minor bitterness over the tongue is very gentle, not abrasive. I thought this was barrel aged though I wasn't sure at the time, but I couldn't really find any noticeable oak aging/wood character in it. I'm sure it rounded out the flavor profile because it was very smooth."
"Clear copper color as it pours from the bottle and copper brown in the glass with a light tan head that dissipates quickly. Smell is leather, bread, molasses, and alcohol. Taste is bready and even a little buttery and savory--surprising and interesting and definitely less sweet than I expected, with just a bit of peppery spice in the finish. (A touch of toffee, maybe?) Mouthfeel is smooth and dry with very little carbonation. This is a rich and complex brew, good for sharing and sipping."
"22oz bottle $11 at the local. Beautiful ruby red or is it orange, I cannot tell. This definitely needs some time to mellow but wow, delicious citrus, brown sugar, oaky, complex, raisins, delicious! This is an excellent barleywine and something I will be buying more to cellar. Hopefully Deschutes starts making this annually...."
"Great to try but not exceptionally better than a bigfoot, old gaurdian, etc."
"As has become expected in Deschutes' Reserve Series, this is a big, complex, delicious monster of a beer. With a ""best after"" date of 2010, I can only imagine the wonderful things that will happen to this beer with some time in my cellar. Highly recommended!"
"This reminded me a bit of FFF Alpha Kong, but not quite as boozy."
"I enjoyed my first bottle of Mirror Mirror (I bought two), but maybe this should be aged. Though I'm not even sure that would help what I feel is the issue: the oak. It is really overwhelming. If you love oak flavors, this is your beer. I found the oak a bit overwhelming. The bottle claims 35% oak aged. I would love to try this at 25% as the oak really overwhelms a lot of the complexity that is still perceptible. It reminds me of Southern Tier's Oak Aged Unearthly, though I've only had that one once. I'll let the other bottle age and see if it makes a difference, but again, I'm not sure that will help. It is the oak, not the alcohol that makes this one fall short of amazing. I should note that I generally love oak aged beers. It's just that the oak flavor shouldn't be THIS dominant, IMO."
"A must have for anyone who digs a strong Barley wine."
"Pours a rusty brown with a silky tan head. The nose has fruity hops, sweet bready malts and peppery alcohol with hints of oak and vanilla. The barrel aging is more evident in the taste as the wood plays a much larger role. Nutty malts are well balanced by ripe pitted fruits, subtle piney hops and spicy alcohol. Smooth medium body is nicely carbonated and compliments the ale quite well. Would call this more of an English than American as the hops play a minor role. Really opens up as it warms."
"Overall impression: I had this on tap last week at the Owl Club in Roseville...let me tell you- it was phenomenal on draft. There's a reason the bottle says ""Best after 4/20/10"". This beer definitely needs time to age and mellow out the sharp alcohol character, but having aged the Abyss and Black Butte XX, I know my remaining 11 bottles will be well worth the wait."
"Drinkability is exceptional. The more I drink this, the more it reminds me of Arctic Devil from Midnight Sun. This is an excellent and very nicely aged barleywine. It's very smooth, and easy to sip, maybe one of the easiest in the style. (fits more in the British Style) I'm curious what this one tastes like fresh, and thanks to Deschutes, this excellent brew will be back shortly. Very good stuff!"
"of course I love to try barleywines. I had this on my wish list but noted as never going to wander my way. What did you say? You snagged me a bottle. MH you're a barleywine mad man! Thoroughly enjoyed last night as a cap to a milestone. oak, an almost whiskey character and sublime malt notes. Yup, this one has aged well. Lucky are those witha few still sitting in their beer cellars!"
"Nicely balanced with perfect carbonation and a big chewy body that coats the tongue. Super drinkability for a large potent brew, it lived up to my expectations and I must thank travisd13 for the opportunity and his generosity. A wonderfull Barleywine!"
"Taste & mouthfeel: A big malty character hits the palate immediately, chewy and rich but thankfully not cloying and syrupy. Too often I find barleywines sweet in an overbearing way, with no nuance or subtlety. That's not the case here, as Mirror Mirror shows quite a bit of depth and a subtle mix of flavors instead of merely beating you over the heat with residual sugars. All the same, there's plenty of toffee sweetness to balance the notes of tannic oak, toasted grain, dried fruit, red wine and tobacco. Alcohol is only faintly noticed, this is far from hot for weighing in at a hefty 11.5%. Nice firm bitterness in the finish along with a touch of drying oak. Very enjoyable stuff, dynamic on the palate and perfectly balanced. Looking forward to bottles of this."
"Very smooth sipper. I would have pegged this as an English rather than American barleywine. Very smooth and sweet."
"Overall a nicely complex barleywine, and one of my favorite offerings from Deschutes. I have not seen this in bottles, and I would love to find some and cellar it for a year or two to see how it smoothes out."
"Drinkability is great, the new pub is really pulling out all the stops with vintages offerings like this one! Very tasty and rich, I really enjoy the citric sweetness, which is probably hops as much as esters, either way, time has done a fantastic job of smoothing the edges without letting the bottom fall out."
"I really like this beer. Well done again, Deschutes. Give this beer a try if you can get the opportunity."
"As always, this beer is terrific. I think it could use a couple of years to soften some of the sharp edges, but it's a very fine beer nonetheless. Impressive."
"I was very happy to have tried this."
"I'd like to see this one make a comeback. Deschutes...new batch please."
"D: Great drinkability for a barleywine but with some lasting burn."
"D: Incredibly drinkable. We drank a few really good barley wines that night and the General Lafayette 275 and this stood out ahead of the pack. Wonderful beer."
"Pours a beautiful,slightly hazy(chill haze possibly?) copper color, thin head that settles fairly quickly, leaving a fine lacing. Aroma is lightly fruity with hints of apricot, grapes. Taste is also amazing. Age has truly done this beer well. All the flavors are very mellow and smooth. Hints of oak, grape, along with a nice mellow malty sweetness. Mouthfeel is very smooth. No detectable harshness, which is surprising due to the almost 12% abv. A very smooth, very mellow, HIGHLY drinkable american barleywine. This one was definitely worth the wait. I only wish i was able to get some bottles of this to have at a later time. Deschutes, PLEASE bottle this again!"
"Pours a nice slightly cloudy orange/amber color, nice carbonation, nice fizzy/creamy head, which then leaves some nice islands and sticky lacing throughout the drink. The nose is sweet malts, hops, nice oakey/woodys scent, and some caramel. The taste is sweet, malty, nice hop balance, and a slight woodys after taste. Medium body. Very drinkable, a very nice barleywine from Deschutes, highly recommended."
"D: Very tasty, not very filling, easy-to-drink for a beer with this high of an ABV, this one is an excellent representation of style and a very good beer. I could stick with this one for a whole evening, but the evening would be over pretty quick with the 11.50% ABV."
"Overall impression: Well balanced barley wine. Nothing overpowering in any one area, but everything meshes well and its an enjoyable beer."
"Overall, it has kind of a harsh flavor. I remember this being smoother when I had it fresh which is kind of odd. It's not bad though and goes down surprisingly easily."
"Pours a two finger cream head that fades slowly leaving a good lace. Almost clear amber color. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Malty nose. Starts sweet-brown sugar, but hops are balancing, high ABV is hidden, mellow smooth finish. Decent barleywine. $6.95 for a 22oz bottle from John's Market Tigard, Or. Label has the ABV at 9.86%."
"Flavor is very smooth and rich. Nice tannins coming from the wood provide a taste-quality to this beer that is very mellowing and rich. Some slight fruits flavors like apples, cherries and peaches.Nice molasses and maple syrupe sweetness from the malts. Hops give it a very mild bitterness that is kind of like winterfresh gum. Very refreshing. Alcohol is wonderfully masked behind it all. Medium to full body that makes quite a palate pleaser. Does not overwhelm. Great dessert beer."
"D: Very nice to sip. Smooth and warm - I'll hope this one ages nicely, as Deschutes seems to have a real winner with this one."
"This is a nice contrast to some of the more brash barleywines out there (and for the record Im very fond of many beers that resemble that description). Id be happy to see this offered more often, but I suppose I should be happy they bottled it at all. Hopefully, the good folks at Deschutes will make this an annual tradition."
"This drinks very well, probably owing to the mellow flavors and warming affect. It's hard to know if I'll feel the same after the second glass, but it's nice so far."
"The beer poured a deep, slightly hazey reddish amber. A nice finger of head came and went quickly and left a single ring of fine lacing. The nose featured a sweet, sweet maltiness along with a underlying slight oakiness. The beers flavor provided a surprising, quick dry hop bitterness with a sweet malty finish along with a nice, oak created vanilla. An excellent aftertaste lingers on the tongue like the touch from a beautiful woman; the malts slowly mellow there. The beer improves with warmth, and there the oak aging slowly peaks up more and more. This is a darn fine barley wine, and one that is surpisingly drinkable. drinkable."
"Deep amber reddish color body with a smallish tan head. Little to no lace was left. Some sweet fruits came out in the aroma with a bit of a hoppy edge. Some woody notes lingered in the back. Some sweet figs and raisons with a strong oak flavor. Some bitter hops cut through the sweetness to finish it off. Light alcohol comes through as well. Could use a bit of beefing up the mouthfeel. A nice sipper that was solid all around but nothing spectacular."
"2005 vintage, ""aged in french oak barrels"". Pours into my pint glass a fairly bright and clear brown hue, topped by an inch or so of creamy tan head. Rich aroma of sweet malt and fragrant fruity hops, accented by notes of oak, sweet bread, and a wisp of alcohol. Palate is pleasantly sweet up front, with bready, caramel malt holding the bitterness of the hops at bay. Sweet fruit (plum or maybe apricot), treacle, and a moderate alcohol presence also make their contributions. Body is reasonably thick, a tad syrupy, but not over the top. Some serious warming on the finish from the alcohol. Overall, a good barleywine, if a bit young. I hope Deschutes continues to make this each year."
"Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed a thick 1"" tan head above the slightly murky burgundy brew. Plenty of sticky lacing, a surprise for a brew that has style and barrel working against the lace. Aroma is sweet dark fruits, with light oaky alcohol notes. Taste has everything working together, the sweetness tempered by the wood and vanilla, dark fruit lurking about, a nice package. Mouthfeel is smooth and lingering, in a good way, and drinkability is ncie as well, in that ""you want more even though it'll kick your ass"" kind of way. Overall, I enjoyed this brew a lot, but it just left me waiting for something more, I'm not sure what. Nonetheless, a very nice brew."
"D- Oh Baby! Sip this one, I could certainly sip this one all night long. This is one of the ""New American"" craft beers, not a tread but more of what American taste is about. It paired great with some baked Brie cheese stuffed with raspberries."
"Dark and dirty copper color topped only briefly by a tan colored head. The nosr reminds me of an Old Arogant Bastard I had this weekend. Really. Had a chance to drink a 3 year old 3 liter of DB, but that is another story. Strong citrus aroma. Lots of sherry, even bourbon. This is one of the rare oak aged barley wines Ive had where that character comes across. The flavor is very soft. Dates, vanilla, sherry with a touch of citrus bitterness on the finish. Bitterness is there but really softened. Nice mouth feel, a bit of heat, but really soft and drinkable. Im really pleasantly surprised by this beer."
"Drinkability? Like with the 2005, this is dangerously drinkable or more appropriately, dangerously sippable. A wonderful brew."
"Incredibly drinkable - I would never think of drinking a whole bomber of barleywine in one sitting, but I couldn't help sipping my way right through this one! It's very, very, very, VERY mellow but flavorful - it doesn't need a day of aging."
"The oak character was done perfectly in this beer, it is nice and subtle, adding to the complexity and not taking anything away from the beer with the often harsh notes that one finds in oak aged beers. Having said all that the rest of the beer does not quite live up to this perfect use of oak. It is quite good though, and ,while I was not expecting such subtle hop character, the focus on malt in this Barley wine is quite nice, and in fact makes it that much better when mixed with the oak notes."
"Obtained March 2006 and consumed that same evening. Pours a cloudy amber orange with a one finger fine yellow head. Smells absolutely delicious as I write the appearance. To the nose its orange candy-like with piney hops and a flat, almost chalky, malt character. Not a robust oak character, like I find in many oak aged beers. Green raisins and a hint of cherry sour. This is a really enticing beer. Tastes pretty good, but the mouthfeel is to die for. Smooth and thick with a fine carb froth when the liquid is sloshed around in the mouth. Taste is caramel, oranges, touch of alcohol burn (but the alcohol is clean of any rough fusel character). Mildly vinous or brandy-like. A bit of cherry. Oak is really faint, and I only found it after looking for it. As I have ready access to Oak Yeti (by Great Divide Brewing), I'm used to a real oak whallop. This definitely has the more subtle oak character and I wonder if these barrels had been used a few times such that the flavor is even more subtle. Hop bitterness is fine for an american barley wine. A bit of hop oil on the flat of the tongue works well with the orange hop flavor. Overall, the hops could be decribed as a 'minnie-me' of Bigfoot. I find Bigfoot to be too brutally hopped, but this to be well done. I see this beer doing well with time in the cellar, but I don't see it as a 10-year beer. Drink it now, it's quite enjoyable and I had no problem finishing the bomber right here during the review."
"I don't see it as too drinkable, as the flavor is so robust that one is certainly enough. That doesn't mean I wouldn't be down to drink another tomorrow. Great stuff! Props to Deschutes for this one. They're on top of their game right now."
"D: Perfect balance of sweet and high potency bitterness on the tongue. Very well done!!"
"Aroma is sweet, oaky, and slightly vinous at first, becoming more delicate and fruity and the beer breathes and warms, Im getting a lot of pear after a bit. Taste seems quite hoppy with a bit of oak bite at first, but this too rounds out quite nicely as the beer equilibrates near room temperature. As such, the Mirror takes on more subtly fruity and malty sweet flavors, with drunken raisins dancing with heady plums. Finish is sweet, and just oaky and bitter enough to dry it out a bit. Body is nicely full without being too thick, and this beer, though a sipper, drinks quite nicely for what is still a relatively young barleywine. Id say delicious to drink now, but very worthy of some cellar time as well. I need to find some more of this beauty."
"Thumbs up, says I. Wish I had a case of the stuff, alas."
"Drinkability  I know it doesnt sound like it, but this ale goes down quite well. It has some extreme flavors that cancel each other out pretty well and that make this a smooth ride."
"This MASSIVE barley wine was aged in French oak wine barrels to give it that added complexity and finesse. It pours dark amber in color with a medium lacey head that falls quickly, which is not uncommon for a beer at 10%. The aroma is big and fruity, orange and cherry dominate with a big sweet sugary, malt underlay. The aromas carry over into the flavor along with some caramel, raisin and oak tones. The big slick mouth-feel is offset by the light fruity hop flavor that pervades the whole profile and cuts the sweetness. Its a big beautiful barley wine that should age well. Admit ably the flavor profile is quite different than any other barley wine Ive had, but in the best possible way. Most rely on a big caramel malt flavor or an 80+ IBU bitterness but this barley wine is all about assertive well integrated flavors of sweet malt (but not big caramel) and the pervasive hop flavor (but not big bitter). Buy some now for the drinkin and some to stash away as I do not expect this beer to be available long and should be a great addition to any beer cellar."
"No cpmparison IMO. The mouthfeel is fairly similar, but a bit watery in the bottled version. It lacks body and the charcater that the '05 version had. Needs some backbone. I do, however, think this can turn out to be an excellent brew once a few years of aging come on. Will buy another and compare a few years down the line. This years would get about a 3.8 overall from me. Good, but nothing compared to the outstanding '05."
"Deschutes' new barley wine pours a deep bronzed amber with a decent sized head for a beer of this strength (I believe around 12-13%). The head quickly dwindles and disappears. The aroma is a bit funky, with strong berry and cherry flavors and some fruitiness from the port and pinot casks. It tastes incredibly sweet to me, very much like sherry with a sort of austere preserved fruit flavor, mixed in with the toffeeish malt. There's also a bourbonish element from the Jack Daniels casks, but no sourness, and I didn't detect any oak or vanilla flavors that one usually finds in cask-aged beers. I was surprised at the lack of hoppiness, both in aroma and bitterness, although I should admit I just had a Randall-ized Full Sail Wreck the Halls just before trying this, so perhaps my hop receptors were shot. Still, for a U.S. barley wine, particularly a West Coast one, the hops were subdued, almost invisible. As I slowly worked through the half-pint, more funky aromas and flavors became evident, particularly a strong sense of Parmesan cheese."
