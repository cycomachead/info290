4.21,4.5,4,4.25,4.25,4,4.25,"Grabbed this one at a pub in Paddington. Thin beige cap over a bronze, clear beer. Decent retention with some clinging bubbles. Super fruity aroma, dried fruit like raisins and figs, along with a nearly tropical character and sturdy biscuit malt base. Solid bitterness didn't get in the way of fruity and malty flavors, as well as a bit of alcohol. Nicely balanced between hops, malt and yeast. A bit bready, biscuit, slight caramel, dried fruit. Full bodied with low carbonation, a bit drying, malty texture. I enjoyed this quite a bit. I'd love it if this was easier to get on the other side of the pond.","DrJay","Jul 01, 2014"

Nose has rich caramel notes, a sligth breadiness and some dried darker fruit notes. Taste is similar and offers a bit more complexity - dried fruits and caramel notes dominate and establish a really solid and quite English malt profile. Modest sweetness and a subtle dryness and bitterness in the finish. A bit of alcohol is interwoven within the flavour, and adds some complexity. Excellent mouthfeel and completely smooth on the palate. An excellent English strong ale, and I'd certainly have this again. Tremendously disappointed that I passed on this when bottles were available at the LCBO.","liamt07","Apr 06, 2012"

The lacing was also thin. The flavour is big, with complex malts upfront and a good balance of bitters. At 8.5% ABV, this is not a wimpy beer. Yes, I do believe I will have another. Later.","Conrad","Dec 12, 2011"

4,-0.7,4,4,4,4,4,"Reddish copper colour, collar of white head with touches of lace. Smell is quite fruity followed by rich malts and sweet caramel scents, getting some raisin and dried fruits, light alcohol scents and toffee. Taste is quite rich and malty, mild hop bitterness, fruity with nice berry flavours in the finish, caramel and toffee sweetness as well. Lightly syrupy, light-med carbonation, fairly full bodied. Solid drinking, strong and flavourful, a very pleasant beer.","peensteen","Dec 08, 2011"

4.27,6,3.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a clear copper colour into an English pint. Thin but creamy off-white head with a long-lasting cap that laces well. Smells very sweet, mostly of toffee and subtle hints of fruit and nuts. Sweet toffee and bready malt flavours up front, which are quickly overtaken by the alcoholic warmth which plays off of the faint bitterness. The alcohol fades into a slight warming finish that's accented by dark fruit and nuts. Soft and creamy carbonation, decent slightly oily body. A delicious sipper that straddles the boundary between English strong ales and barleywines.","MattyV","Nov 29, 2011"
4.42,9.7,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"For those who want a bit more out of their pale ales, but don't want to go too far into barleywine territory, this is the ticket.

4.39,8.9,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"D: A bridge between strong ales and barleywines, bursting with complex, fruit-forward flavours while keeping a well-balanced medium body. Seek it out, let it warm, and sip it slowly.","Kartoffeln","Nov 19, 2011"

4.33,7.4,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Overall, Golden Pride is a delectable, nuanced cross between an English Strong Ale and barley wine.

4.1,1.7,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Despite classed as English Strong Ale here this a Barleywine and rated like that. In short: an English Barleywine with strong and complex maltiness, fruitiness and orange-like aroma/flavor. (Best before 12-08-2011, into tulip)","crnipeter","Sep 25, 2011"
4.15,3,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"As far as I can remember, this is my first time tasting an English strong ale. So far, I think I can say I like this style and this beer in particular.

4.05,0.5,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Overall: A nice beer. Nothing to complain about really. Given its strength I'm surprised it doesn't cost more. I'd drink it alone to reward myself, or on a nice, not too hectic evening with friends, and maybe a steady meat dish.","stjaernstoft","Beers"
4.22,4.7,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Instead, you get an elegant, sexily sweet malt driven sipper. Almost like melted toffee. Carbonation is nice and low helping this puppy slide down nice and smooth. Alcohol is nicely in check too. What's not to like?","juju7","0"

4.25,5.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Picked this up at the biggest beer store in the UK, Beers of Europe Ltd. Cear copper-amber pour with quickly fading two finger head and minimal lacing. Very unique nose for a British beer. It was typically malty, but also had a strong aroma of dark fruit and alcohol as well as hints of biscuits and tea. The taste is complex, full bodied and rich. Tons of oak and vanilla, with hints of caramel, toffee, grape skins, rum, and a touch of orange peel. Incredibly smooth and drinkable for a big beer. I'm kicking myself for only grabbing one of these. This is everything the Fuller's Vintage should be and isn't for less than half the price.

3.94,-2.2,3,4,4,4,4,"Not golden, as it turns out - more of a nectarine skin-amber brown. Its parchment head is not very impressive in terms of size or retention, but the nose is lovely: plenty of caramel/toffee malts to anchor more volatile, spicy notes of ginger, lemon, brandy, and a little bit of leafy/piney hops. Sweet on the palate with a nice, sticky, lush (and a bit syrupy) body, nicely balanced by a punch of fresh, citric hops and warm alcohol spice. Vanilla, rum, and perfumey floral notes lend a festive feel to a sweet, mellow, fruity barleywine base. Quite drinkable despite its strength; a good "fireplace beer," but I can imagine this could even be refreshing if served chilled. It's also nice with fried fish, especially with a bit of lemon.","soulgrowl","Apr 29, 2009"

4.43,9.9,4.5,4,4.5,4,5,"Had to have one of these when I saw it in the fridge in a Fuller's in North Greenwich - this is one of the best English beers i've ever had. Pours a rich goldy-red, a wonderfully vivid colour, with minimal head. Smell is not hugely strong, but sweet and fruity. It was perhaps a bit too cold (i've never quite discovered the best temperature to serve this beer at), but there are a lot of fruit flavours in here, with the satisfying alcoholic kick coming in towards the finish. Superbly well-balanced for a beer of its strength, nowhere near as heavy as most barley wines. And dangerously drinkable - you'll find it an effort of will to go back to a weaker beer after this...","Sage","Apr 11, 2008"
4.15,3,4,4,4.5,3.5,4,"Fullers Golden Pride is a very good example that strong ales can be smooth and highly drinkable. The taste is very malty but with a kick of hops and to my suprise not a heavy ale. This is one of my prefered Barley Wines and it's so easy to forget how strong they are and have a few to many. Well done Fullers.","blamoe","Jan 03, 2008"
4.18,3.7,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"D: Tasty, goes down very easy, not too filling, good kick, nice representation of style, this is a very good beer that I could stick with for the duration of the evening.","TheManiacalOne","Nov 18, 2007"
4.23,5,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Pazzo's took the Ole Winter Ale off tap for a few hours to share this treasure of a beer with their patrons. Certainly glad I was there. This beer is quite special, reminding me of the Vintage Ales, with a more subdued alcohol complex and power in the flavors. The first sip delivers a plethera of complexity, tons of flavors, and spicy character. Certainly rests on a foundation, built on malts. Shows a lot of cotton-candy sweetness, berries, cherries, dates, figs, plumbs, nuts, caramel, and lightly toasted breads. Balanced by firm, pungent hops with a faint herbal tone. Alcohols are warming, but weave nicely into the complex malts until they are hardly noticed. Finishes sweet, but balanced and with a long sherry-like lingering.","BEERchitect","Nov 02, 2007"
3.61,-10.4,4,3,4.5,3.5,2.5,"Drinkability - A powerful and complex beer, rich and satisfying. However, its strength and richness makes this beer not for all occasions. Perhaps as an digestif or as a winter warmer to combat cold conditions. This inflexibility marks it down in my personal tastes.","DaveUK","Jan 11, 2007"
3.79,-6,3.5,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,"This is a clearly well crafted beer; balanced, matured and all. But I just dont appreciate the style enough to give it a higher grade. And in fact, I prefer the Strong Ale from Swedish brewery Slottskällans.","bark","Jul 03, 2006"
4.12,2.2,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,4,"Oxidation is mildly apparent with a wet cardboard aftertaste, and freshers days have since passed, but all in all, she held up pretty damn good.","brewandbbq","Dec 06, 2005"

4.28,6.2,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"M: very rich yet smooth on the palate, thankfully not too sharp for its high alc. strength; 100% body, no more no less, while the rich flavour is tuned quite nicely to make it rather easy to sip!! An impressive beer by the Fuller's. It used to be available only in 330ml bottles around four years ago as I remember it, and now it comes in bigger bottles, maybe due to higher popularity I reckon? But this beer is best to be shared b/w buddies over a fireside chat, otherwise it could trick people to consume too much without even feeling the strength!!","wl0307","Mar 22, 2005"
4.42,9.7,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Acquired at Sainsbury's Vauxhall, a supermarket, in London last May. Been in the fridge ever since. Pours a beautiful reddish brown, belying the "golden" on the label. then again, I didn't think this was going to be a pale beer. Aroma is sweet with slight caramels and a "Dry smell" that I'm attributing to the hops. Big caramel and toffee with very bitter earthy hops in there. Huge. Almost like a proper English version of Arrogant Bastard. Call him a Rough Yob. Kind of like drinking candy. Sweet and malty and yum and yum and yum. Balanced with the hops, but not like the licorice taste of 1845. Mouthfeel is lightly carbonated and proper, and drinkability goes through the roof with its lovely English character.","twilight","Mar 01, 2005"

3.9,-3.2,4,4,4,4,3.5,"330 ml bottle, at The Beehive, Brentford, London. Copper coloured, moderate head. Malty sweet aroma with hints of dried fruits, oak and sherry. Flavour is malty sweet with oak, dried figs and dusty hops. Interesting beer. Warming mouthfeel, as expected from an 8.5% ABV beer.","Sigmund","Nov 30, 2004"
4.1,1.7,4,4,4.5,4,3.5,"A very good strong ale, as far as it being a scotch wee heavy, methinks not, more a strong ale or barely wine, very potent alcohol on the breath, not something you'd want to even touch if your driving","cypressbob","Aug 27, 2004"
3.65,-9.4,4,4,4,2.5,3,"This is a "big" beer that has a great taste. Sadly i think the alcohol is way to overwhelming but its nice to sit and sip on this one.","stjarnflikka","Jul 07, 2004"
3.93,-2.5,4.5,4,4,4,3.5,"The mouthfeel is very smooth with medium amounts of carbonation. The drinkability is fine but a bit encumbered by a spicy alcohol aftertaste. Over all a very great beer, though not as great as the label claims, that goes for Fuller's ESB.","CAMRAhardliner","Mar 23, 2004"
3.73,-7.4,4.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"The smell is strong - mostly honey, with some hints of hops as well. The taste is sweet, thick and doughy, with a pleasant tingly, hoppy aftertaste. Not much depth to this, but otherwise a nice beer.","jahred","Dec 16, 2003"
4.05,0.5,4,4,4,4.5,4,"What a lovely colour this beer has. It pours a amber colour into the glass, with a medium thick head. That disappear quickly, leaving a thin lacing on the glass. It has a big fruity smell with hints of caramel and fudge. It has a rich bittreness in the taste and also some fruity taste. Some hints of orange??? Even some caramel in the after taste. It is a strong beer but you only feel the warmth of the alcohol. This is a very nice beer and like the name says it is pride of Fullers.","anders36","Beers"
4.38,8.7,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Don't confuse with a scotch heavy ale after all my talk of caramel malt. This is much lighter in colour and texture. Someone mentioned golden syrup, and that does seem a fairly good analogue. Just with a little more depth of flavour than the aforementioned syrup. It's very good, I like it.","the42ndtourist","0"
