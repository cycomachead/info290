review_text
"22 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 12/3/2013. Pours fairly hazy/cloudy deep orange/copper color with a 2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of big raisin, apricot, plum, fig, pear, apple, orange zest, caramel, toffee, toast, biscuit, oak, herbal, grass, light pine, light vanilla, and herbal/yeast/oak earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of and balance of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast, earthy hops, and oak barrel notes; with great strength. Taste of big raisin, apricot, plum, fig, pear, apple, orange zest, caramel, toffee, toast, biscuit, oak, herbal, grass, light pine, light vanilla, and herbal/yeast/oak earthiness. Light herbal/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, apricot, plum, fig, pear, apple, orange zest, caramel, toffee, toast, biscuit, oak, light pine, light vanilla, and herbal/yeast/oak earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice robustness and complexity of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast, earthy hops, and oak barrel flavors; with a great malt/yeast/hop/oak balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth, creamy, and lightly slick/bready mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent oak aged English barelywine style. All around great robustness, complexity, and balance of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast, earthy hops, and oak barrel flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A very enjoyable offering."

"I had this on tap at the Pint Room in Carmel on Left Hand night. Pretty good barleywine. Orange-copper color, surprisingly translucent. Taste has fruit, some malt, and pucker. The mouthfeel is a bit harsh, but not too bad."
""
""
"Amber / copper body with a small khaki head. Aromas of alcohol, malt, candied fruit. Sweet and boozy. Cotton candy, hard candies. A hint of bitterness in the finish. This is ok. A small sample is plenty."
""
"Well done aged barley wine. Just enough sweetness balanced with hop bitterness. Mild oak flavor lingers."

"Smooth.  Been awhile since I've had a barleywine and this one hits the spot.  It's not overpowering in any way ... just crisp, smooth, and satisfying.  I doesn't rock my world but I'm sure glad I gave it a try."

"O: Like I said, this is a six-year-old bottle, and man, is it smooth and oaky and fruity and malty; I like this a lot more than I did when I tried the fresher version"

"Oak Aged Widdershins isn't bad at all but doesn't quite come together. I'm surprised by how harsh the alcohol seems given that I drink stronger brews on a regular basis. Perhaps some age would do this good but I didn't detect enough of what I look for in either American or English barleywines to spend any more money here."

"Mouthfeel is thick, a little sticky, not unpleasant. This is pretty good."

"This beer starts in England and ends with an American finish. In the nose, peat overwhelms the senses with dried fruits and burnt sugar lingering behind. The palate is similar with flavors akin to that of an English barley wine, only with overtones of peat. It finishes abruptly with a sharp drying bitterness. Overall this beer has allot of bold flavors but just doesn't seem to harmonize maybe some age would help."
"O: There's just not a lot to the beer on any level, except for the high alcohol content. This would be a decent beer for drinking with a heavy meal--an ""easy drinking"" barleywine, if you will."
""
""
"Overall: Not really into this style of beer, but this was good. That little but of cinnamon in the taste profile made a huge difference."
""

""
""
"O: I really like this barleywine--not too sweet or cloying, with a light bitterness at the end to round things off. This was a 2013 bottle (22 oz) and I have two more in the cellar. I'll look forward to trying another in about a year"

"I think the 2007 is over the hill, but I do think the 2013 could well improve well with a few years on it. It drinks quite well right now. An unexpectedly enjoyable barleywine. Review rating is for the fresh Widdershins; the aged one would grade about a half point lower on taste because of the thin finish and effects of oxidation. The appearance gets a few decimals extra because the aged one has such a creamy, good looking head."
""

"O: While this isn't horrible, the proportion of peated malt is much too high and obscures the other elements of the beer."

"Pours a moderate copper color with a very thin off-white head and not much in the way of lacing. The nose carries oak, oak, and more oak. As it warms, I get a bit more oak. Other than that, a touch of semi-sweet malt. It's not terrible, just horribly one-dimensional. Other than the oak, there was a touch of caramel and sweetness. I'd rather not have this again."
""
""
"The nose is heavy citrus up front, grapefruit, orange, lots of sugar and malt too.  A little woody, with bourbon notes tying together with the malt sweetness, you can smell the alcohol.  The flavor is a little spice, citrus hops, bourbon and vanilla, honey and caramel.  Very sticky and a bit all over the place.  This may get better with age, but right now a bit too boozy for the flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a very nice offering. Not as complex as some similar brews, but still a beer that I would revisit. The bitter finish could probably withstand a year or two of aging, but it would be a loss to age too long and lose that."

"mouthfeel - carbonation is great for an aged barleywine thats been thru some tough cellaring. body is thick but not too thick. no cloying"
"Overall pretty good beer but I don't see it going anywhere with more time in the cellar."
"D: Alright. Really dry and watery yet boozy body."
"O: A decent beer, well rounded and balanced while offering a range of flavors and warming the tongue. However something is off with this beer. The hops are all gone and the characteristic barleywine heat is missing. As for the oak aging, I’m getting some “wood” out of it, but not that tell-tale vanilla-oakiness. 3.5"
"I was getting ready to knock this beer for a lot of flaws when I was sampling it fresh out of the fridge, but I have to say warming it up has really let a rather good beer come out. The oak impact is minimal and I believe it is mellowing the hops a bit and possibly fusing the flavors together a bit while adding some tannins and a light but of nutty/earthy over tones in the back ground. Or I’m just crazy and read that in another review and stole it. I’m honestly not sure as this beer has me somewhat perplexed. I saw some Arrogant Bastard like comments, and I have to say I get that. This beer getting near or past 2 years (I just have a 2009 year on here, no month that I see) the hops most likely have faded from sight so this isn’t Bastard, but the malt profile and the presence of the hops certainly does remind me of it in ways though certainly different experiences to drink."
"This beer pours a hazy orange amber color with a finger if off white head with a bit of lacing and decent head retention. The aroma is amazing... Big bits of matly caramel and some earthy hops are apparent. The taste is slighty off however... It starts with some roasted malt and strong caramel and then hits you strong with cardboard. The mouthfeel is velvety and slightly carbonated and finishes smooth. Overall worth a try and it has a Tom of potential."
"Sure, for an almost four-year-old oak-aged barleywine, this ain't what should be (really, where is the oak??) But it is still good and enjoyable."
"D- Nothing awesome about this beer but certainly don't turn it down if offered."
"It poured a cloudy orange-amber which can be expected if it had been shaken due to bottle conditioning, but it had not. The head was very slight and did not hang around long enough to make the walk from the kitchen to the living room. There were some hints of malt in the aroma, but they were overpowered by the smell of soured washcloth, dirt (not to be confused with earthiness), and mildew. All of the smells came through in the taste, but the malt gained a little bit of an edge and competed with the sourness. Little if any of the oak came through in the flavor, but there was a touch of hop bitterness, (not what one would expect even from a year old barleywine). The mouthfeel was and astringent and had a slight burn from the alcohol which was not pleasant with the thin body. In my years of drinking, I have only drain-poured two beers, and had I had more than a 4 oz. sample, this would have been a third. I might be willing to try it again in the future if someone else pays."
"D - Can't drink this, it tastes horrible."
"Another crappy beer from Left Hand, not a surprise to me. Avoid this mess."
"M&D- Feel is above medium with some rough patches and heat. Kinda chewy and coating on the mouth. It's drinkable but I struggled through my glass. Would not be my 1st choice for a barley wine. Truthfully, I think the hop bill is kinda skewed here, they just don't mesh right."
"Pours a crystal clear deep amber, with a perfect light tan colored whipped cream head. One of the best looking beers I have ever seen. I was amazed at the clarity of the beer considering its bottle conditioned. Smell is some raw brown sugar and charred wood. Taste is a hint of ripe bananas up front, with a creamy toffee middle, and a dry woody finish. The oak aging is nice, often times it is overdone. There is also a hint of flowery hops in the finish, just enough to balance. Mouthfeel is very creamy, nice low carbonation. Drinkability is very good, I would certainly get this again. The alcohol is nearly imperceptible, which is difficult to do in beers of this gravity."
"D- This was split four ways and the small amount we each had to drink was hard. Each person had trouble finishing this with two of the people sending it down the drain. Enough said."
"D - When a beer becomes a chore to drink, it isn't all that good. Not very good drinkability at all in fact. It's not much of a barleywine, honestly, and it's not much of a barrel aged beer."
"Overall by far the clunker of the tasting. I'm not sure if this one was off or what. I actually had to drain pour my last few sips. Simply nothing I would ever seek out again."
"(D)- Very malty and sugary sweet even for the style. Has an obvious boozy warmth even for it being this old. Not bad, just a little too sugary sweet and malty for my tastes; not much balance."
"Not bad, but I was hoping for something a little more obviously lush and ""aged."" This still packs some real kick. Maybe the aggressive bottle conditioning and hopping helped preserve this much better than I would have thought. This must have been a real beast fresh. Seriously, I think this could easily go another 3-5 years - I think I opened this too early."
"22 oz. bomber, 2009 batch. Pours a nice hazy amber color, with maybe a finger of ecru head. Seems to me that this one would fall into the English style barley wine category, with aromas of caramel, chocolate malt and a little bit of citrusy hops. I didn't get a whole lot of oak out of this one, which was a little disappointing. Dark fruit, brown sugar and caramel dominate on the palate. Ok, but a bit of a letdown."
"D: I have a half growler of this and will definitely polish it off. Pretty impressive. Glad to have found this at Party Town in Florence, KY on Growler."
"Had this over the weekend,a stiff price tag of $12.99.Poured into an imperial nonic a slight hazed aber infused with burnt orange,a nice tight formed one finger white ehad atop that settled very slowly leaving broken globs of lace bhind as it settled slowly.A mix of dark fruit,smoke,and vanilla tinged oak in the nose,definently malt driven.Flavors may be a little to infused with that oak,vanilla tinged with dark fruit,alcohol sweetness seems to become more prominent as it warms,it has a little of the smokiness like the un-oaked beer.Its good but not good for the price tag."
"Overall it might be a tad hoppy with the finish. While you will have that with an American BW, it feels just a tad out of balance with the malt."
"Poured a deep orange color with good carbonation and a nicw hite head. Nose is oak, musty, horse blanket.Taste is citrus, apricot, earthy, caramel, oak, must. Mouthfeel is light boozze, earthy, oak, musty. Drinkability is good and unique overall. Musty try."
"This one is worth a try. It's a bit different than your typlical American Barleywine, but still has plenty of interesting flavors to go around. This is my first Brandy barrel aged beer and I must say it's a nice departure from the whiskey barrel aged beers I typically encounter. The oak character is smoother and more delicate, not the onslaught of raw oakiness and booze that whiskey cask aged beers can be."
"taste - I really thought I was gonna love this but it's not up to expectations. Not bad by any means but I love barleywine and oakaged...I expected to be better"
"Brownish with cloudy burnt-orange hues. A little over one finger of tan head results from an explosion of carbonation, sticks around and then quickly disappears. A few small fingers and sheets of lace are left behind. Smells a bit chocolaty up front with some earthiness in the middle and some sweet cherries lingering toward the end. Tastes initially sweet and malty with a good hoppy backbone and an oakiness around the edges. Some light and dark fruits wind there way through from time to time. A hint of booziness is noted, but not much to speak of. Brew goes down medium with an airiness to it. Pretty complex brew that could use a little bolder approach in some areas, but nothing to bitch about."
"Easy to drink without a doubt, and the general presentation is fairly nice. On the whole, though, my thoughts are that this one is all over the map, and just a little over the top in that direction to have it be a good thing. Don't get me wrong, I'm not into one-trick ponies either, but this finished product combines so many different melodies that it just can't quite carry a tune."
"D - Certainly a sipper, but an easy drinker. I'm happy to have it on hand as the Ohio winter grows increasingly cold."
"Refreshing lighter offering that didn't disappoint. I'd have it again."
"This was a treat--my first from Left Hand. Pours a nice caramel color with about an inch of tan head that laces nicely as the brew goes along. Smell is a bit lacking, boozy, with some caramel and sweetness. Taste, however, is great, big oaky notes coupled with some grassy hops, sweet caramel, and a bit of booze (but it works in this case). Nice piney burps following... gotta love that. MF is a bit lacking in the creamy department, full bodied and oily, but I would like some more creaminess. I moved through the bomber pretty quick, definitely a nice, enjoyable OA barleywine. Definitely will revisit this."
"This is one fantastic beer that lives just behind the Oak Aged Bastard in terms of quality."
"I was expecting a ton of sweetness with this for some reason. I'm not sure if I noticed that its listed as an American Barleywine but I was expecting much more in line with English. The aroma hints at this, as well. A lot of malt, much more than anything, with raisin and a fig-like character that was reminiscient of doppelbocks. The pour is very nice, a somewhat-cloudy red-orange (the red was surprisingly nice). The flavor is much more bitter than expected, not that theres a tno of hop, but its definitely not just all malt. The wood character is also quite-present and even imparts sort of a dry feeling to the mouth, which is otherwise moderately-bodied. Overall its certainly decent, not the most incredible and I almost wish the flavor would tilt a little more in either direction, either more hop or more malt. The balance between the two allows the oak to take over a little too much."
"Drinkability- A really easy drinking barleywine as well as a nice change of pace beer. Not your tradtional barleywine."
"M/D: Medium to full body, carbonation is slightly prickly on the tongue. Drinkability is fair. Overall a solid beer, but I could really use some more malt character."
"Drinkability is good. It's on the milder end of the spectrum as far as hops and bitterness go. It's not an all out assault on your palate, but there's just enough of all the good stuff to make this quite enjoyable. I'd buy this again!"
"Mouthfeel is a bit more thick and creamy, mild carbonation. Very good beer,"
"The taste is pretty good. Sweet, a bit of citrus and a lot of citrus bitterness. Prolly a decent I2PA. Actually, OKish, at this point, as an American bwine but... But the color and smell are just so wrong."
"Drinkability is moderate. I'll finish the 750, but not quickly (good, I guess, what with the 10% abv ...)"
"Courtesy of Gillard. 2007 vintage poured hazy copper with gold edges and thin white head. The aroma is peach and tangelo followed by some chewy malt sweetness, wood notes and just a bit of booze. The taste has bold notes of oak but not too much. Next to the wood are chewy sticky malts, solid pine hop flavor and pine hop bitterness. Yum. The varied notes are well matched creating a pleasing experience. This should only get better with age."
"D: Tasty, but a bit to cloying to drink a lot of. Worth trying and sharing."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with good carbonation."
"D - This is a good tasting barleywine, but is a bit much to handle in terms of drinkability."
"Drinkability is good for a beer of this strength and strong taste."
"Drinkability is low, way to oaky and astringent, it makes it seem like it's about 4% stronger. I'm not really sure though why the oak aged version would actually be weaker then the orginal. This was a real struggle to work through, and generally unpleasant. Warming up made no difference. I wasn't really concerned with drinking beer tonight, so I patiently powered through the first 1/2 for a few hours. I got used to it, sort of, but it just wasn't worth the pain, and I dumped the rest. One of the worst made brews I've had in a long time, I don't think I've liked any of the beers I've had from Left Hand."
"Found several bottles of the 2004 Vintage stocked in Albuquerque, NM for $3.99 each. This happened on 12/18/08 so that $1 per year- what a deal! Out of the caged bottle this beer was a very cloudy copper color with a tan head. Retained as a skim and laced quite well. The aroma was incredibly pungent and notably sweet, lots of ripe peaches, pears and figs, alcohol esters and heat, hints of wood, and lots of caramel malt. The flavors were smooth, complex and well rounded. It started with a biscuity malt flavor before becoming more rich and sweet, caramel malt, ripened fruit, hints of spices, a slight citrus tanginess and a warming alcohol pleasantness towards the end. The sugars had been well tempered by the wood and age. The carbonation was very soft, partly the age again, the body medium/full and the mouthfeel smooth but a little watery. The years had truly done this one well, it was balanced, smooth, quaffable and rewarding with the punchy alcohol well blended in. Bravo!"
"A drinkable and very average barley wine. Aroma was so so. Hints of vanilla, oak and sweet malt. Pour was a nice deep murky brown with a thin tan ring for a head. Taste was subdued for a barley wine. Sweet hot malt, with just a hint of oak and a moderate alcohol burn. Decent carbonation. As it warmed a little caramel and toffee came out with the alcohol dominating. Average at best."
"D - golden warmth. smooth sipping, mellow and sublime. This is a great example of what an aged barleywine can be!"
"D: Very for the style."
"The drink is medium in body and light on the carbonation, light on oak, light on flavor, and light on my drinkability scale. Pretty disappointing; skip it."
"D: i expected this to be a chore to drink but was rewarded with a smooth and easy drinking barleywine that's big on flavor. The alcohol flavor, while noticable, was relatively well contained."
"Oh, its good but not unique..."
"Pours a hazy orange amber color with a HUGE stiff light yellow head that resists fading. A reasonable amount of lacing left behind. The smell has a really nice complexity to it. Initially I got an earthiness that i wanted to equate to smoky, but as it warms up there is a unique fragrant fruity apricot nature. Visibly effervescent, the mouth feel is medium-full bodied with a very dry finish. Full flavored, the sweet malty caramel character is secondary to the piny resin hoppiness which lingers on with an earthy smoky texture. An interesting drink with a lot to consider. Recommended."
"Taste was similar, floral and malty with a spiciness. I probably could have stuck with these all night, but they would have been peeling me off the bathroom floor. Very intriguing and unique brew, hope to find it again."
"Had on tap at the Union Brewhouse. Great surprise to find on tap! Poured into a 10 tumbler- hazy orange/amber color with an extremely fluffy white head. Very aromatic for a barleywine- I get some smoke flavor, oak, and alcohol. Tastes as it smells- you get a lot of the oaky flavor. Very sweet malt presence. Slick mouthfeel. You have to watch out drinkin these bombs!"
"When colder, the beer is quite refreshing and tasty. However, when the beer warmed up, the complexity could be truly experienced. Both have advantages. I loved the way the colder beer felt. I could drink it cold all night, and it was great for a hot day. The warmer beer tasted much more complex and interesting, but I could not drink much more than a glass this way."
"These barleywine blends are interesting because you get the sharp hops that develop up front along with the duller hops that have been around for a while. This isn't a vanilla bomb since it's a blend. Some of the more complex notes you find in an aged beer are in there as well. It's a pretty solid and interesting beer. Recommended."
"2007 Vintage. 750 ml bottle, corked and caged. Served in a snifter. Bottle conditioned. I had a tough time getting the cork out for some reason. Poured a hazy, reddish gold with a couple of fingers of white bubbled head. Pretty good amount of carbonation. Great aroma, lots of fresh piney/citrusy hops. Also some burnt sugar. I didn't get much oak from this. There was a pronounced smokey note. Medium bodied with good amount of hop bitterness. Long, hoppy finish with a little pucker. A little overpriced in my opinion."
"Pretty impressive after the initial pour. Two finhger frothy, light amber head but recedes after about five minutes after pouring. Before I take my first sip. Pretty good for a barleywine though. Good bubbling too. Very toasted malt nose. Brown sugar with notes of light and dark fruits mixed with a dash of molasses. Great nose that develops more as it warms. The taste is just like the aroma. Complexity increases with warmth. Hints of toasted pears mix with herbal hnts of tobacco and light maraschino cherries. The mouthfeel is pretty wamr, but not overpowering. Just lets you know that tis beer need to be sipped."
"drinkability - Not a bad tasting beer, interesting taste I think."
"Overall, it's just an odd combination of flavors and doesn't work for me."
"The beer pours a dark amber/brown color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a very nice oak scent laid over a malt bill of pale and crystal malts. The hops are well promounced in the aroma also. The oak scent is mild, yet it blends in well. The taste is decent. It has a toned down flavor. It's not overly malty. The hop bitterness is pronounced as well as the oak character. It's quite dry with a lingering oak taste in the finish. The mouthfeel is decent also. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. I love the concept of using oak casks. It can really enhance the complexity of certain beer styles. I like the oak in this one, but I'm not in love with the lack of malt presence in the taste. It's seems a little bland and dumbed down. Overall, this is a good drinker, but not my favorite barleywine."
"Alcohol is fairly well masked in this one, and this has to be one of the better oaked beers I've sampled. The oak elevates the beer here, it doesn't dominate it, as it does in so many other oaked beers."
" stu"
"I found this beer to be out of balance and not very pleasant to finish."
