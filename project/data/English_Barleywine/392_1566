I bought a pack weeks ago and can't even get drunk enough to stomach it. Just. Frigging. Terrible.","xtavior","Yesterday at 01:48 PM"

3.52,-3.6,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Overall I thought this was a nice beer and I thought it was it a nice example of an English Style Barleywine, but In the end it didn't turn out as great as some of the better ones I've had, it just lacked the complexity and big mouthfeel that some of that better ones seem to have and it left me wanting more.  This beer has nice drinkability, it's fairly smooth, not too cloying, slightly crisp, a little filling and the taste did a nice job at holding my attention, I think one is a good amount for me, I don't really have the urge to drink another one in a row.  What I like the most about this beer was how true to style it was, besides lacking it complexity it had pretty much all the things that I look for in the style.  What I like the least about this beer is the lack of complexity, that aspect could use some work.  I would buy this beer again, but I'm not going to go out of my way to stock up on it and I would say it worth a try if you are a fan of the style.  All in all I liked this beer, but I didn't love, it needs a little work, but I think it has potential.  IT's not a favorite Weyerbacher beer and it's right about average for the style.  Nice job guys, but I think with a little more work this could be a very nice Barleywine.","StoutHunter","Mar 31, 2015"

Slight hint of toffee. A bit of booze. Taste is a little underwhelming-- some dark fruits, most notably cherry and fig. Sweet malts. A ton of booze. Very poorly masked. A little bit of bitterness give it a sort of candy-like taste. Can't get over the alcohol, though. It is very offsetting compared to the slightly more subdued taste. Not a good combo. Not much carbonation. Easier to drink than you'd expect, but still not the most pleasant experience. Overall, not super impressed by my first entry into the English Barley Wine realm. Hopefully not a sign of the style as a whole.","majorbase2","Sep 20, 2014"

It could use a little more time in the bottle to get rid of a little bit of the sweetness but it is not bad in any way. Really this tastes like a small barleywine that could be a little thicker and more robust for the style. I love the beer and would love to drink it plenty but it just isn't a true barleywine as I have drank. It's a little thin and just not robust as I would expect. Still a great beer. For the ABV it certainly doesn't taste that strong. It tastes like it could be 8ABV instead of 11ABV so it does mask the alcohol and seems like a beer I could drink all day but certainly not a session beer due to the high ABV.","TheBeerDrinker","Apr 05, 2014"

Aroma is subdued with toffee, caramel, sweet brown sugar, some dark fruit. Flavor is big time malts: toffee, caramel, molasses maybe, some sweet sweet dark fruits like plums and figs. Very sweet brown sugar, heavy thick mouthfeel with low carbonation. Very solid barleywine and now looking forward to trying some Insanity.","BMMillsy","Dec 31, 2013"

3.71,1.6,4,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Overall, the best thing about this brew is its aroma. This aspect of it is actually rather boastful, with each component taking a big stand, looking for all the attention. It was, however, disproportionate when followed by that flavoring, with huge booziness in the nose that was extremely dampened in the finished product on the palate. Perhaps this was to its benefit, hoping cloy would be more appealing to people than harshness. So that said, nothing was really offensive about this beer, it just came across as quite simple and light to the touch. Perhaps the nearly three years we put on it was to its detriment, but according to the brewer, they are confident that it improves up to five years in the bottle. We’d have to do a vertical to find out, but that just doesn’t seem very appealing at present. On a happy/interesting/mostly unrelated note, this is our first review since getting engaged earlier this week, so huzzah!!","TheBrewo","Dec 22, 2013"

5,37,5,5,5,5,5,"The taste is mesmerizing. I can't properly convey what the taste is in words. The constituent parts wouldn't properly explain anything. What they are isn't important. It's how they come together in the perfect amounts that creates perfection. Or maybe it's just brewed with immense amounts of love. It's hard to say. Anyway, it has the intensity, smoothness, and complexity of a very old, aged whiskey. Which is not to say it tastes like one. There's no whiskey flavour. It's very strong. The alcohol is up front for sure, along with the smooth sweetness. It's a very sweet beer. But there's a lot going on in the background for you analysis connoisseurs. I'm not good with this part of the review, but it's definitely spicy. That apple flavour present in the nose is definitely there. Not green apples, but sweet apples. The hops are mostly spice hops, but there's some astringency on the finish as well. There's a bit of that apricot I detected on the nose in there as well, with about of that straw flavour. The rest is all malt complexity. It's too complex for me to understand, but there must have been several malts used in this. All I can say is they are all excellent and used in perfect proportion. Now I'm going to stop annoying myself by trying to analyze this for this review and sit back and enjoy this perfection, because that's what this beer is. It's pure perfection. You don't have to be a blithering idiot to appreciate it. But you'd have to be one not to give it a try. Beware the bite though. This stuff bites like 19th century cough medicine. So be warned, but if you're into that sort of thing, enjoy the hell out of it. I know I will.","ElCommodoro","Apr 11, 2013"

But as it stands in 2013, it's not a bad brew at all. A bit on the weak side, flavor-wise, it pours with little head and not much aroma beyond the caramel sweetness. Taste is more of the same, with a substantially sweet viscous mouthfeel and decent carbonation. I'll give Weyerbacher credit for producing an 11.1% ABV brew with almost no detectable alcohol. It's certainly not my favorite barleywine, but it does fit the style fairly well and tastes halfway decent. More of a ""beginner's"" barleywine, lacking some substance and hop balance. There are better barleywines out there for the price, to be sure. But I'm glad I tried this at least. A solid B or B+ rating from me.","DrewV","Mar 23, 2013"

Very highly drinkable, I could easily put back a couple of these with relative ease, and would enjoy the feeling that I'm sure would eventually come along with these! I highly recommend this one and think anyone who really enjoys this style or is getting into it will appreciate it too!

3.9,6.8,4,4,4,4,3.5,"12 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 5/10/2012. Pours lightly cloudy reddish orange color with a nice 1 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of big cherry, raisin, prune, fig, caramel, molasses, toast, banana, light clove, bread, earth, and light herbal spiciness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of maltiness. Taste of cherry, raisin, molasses, caramel, toast, fig, bread, herbal, clove, earth, and banana. No bitterness at all on the finish; with lingering notes of cherry, dark fruits, molasses, caramel, toast, banana, light clove, bread, earth, and herbal on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of malty flavors; with zero cloying sweetness present on the finish. Light-medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a creamy and very slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Definitely a sipper at 11.1%. Overall this is a very nice English Barleywine style. Very nice flavor complexity and balance of malt sweetness; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering. I enjoyed this much more than my first rating; not sure what went wrong with that bottle.","superspak","Dec 08, 2012"

The smell is malt forwards with caramel and molasses along with dark fruits and earthy character. The taste is rather fruity with candied grapes and cherries, the taste is similar to a BSDA. Candi sugar is present as well. The finish is incredibly sweet with little hop character to keep the sweetness in check. The mouth feel is a medium body with high carbonation.

Taste brings light caramel and brown sugar in unison with dark dried fruit, despite its age, the warm alcohol touches on solvency, hops are grassy and struggle to find a place.

Wow, blast of sweetness with a velvety thick finish without any carbonation at all. Mouthfeel is sweet malty velvet that coats the tongue with the aforementioned plum and raisin and a good strong alcohol presence that warms and makes this the perfect winter weather sipper.

Taste is smooth, but same as the nose. I'm just not feeling this beer, and I really like most of this breweries offerings. It just doesn't have the punch, character or complexity as a good English Barleywine has. Feel is alright, sweet and somewhat light and syrupy. A fairly simplistic feel for this style.

There is a mild pine that emerges as it ners cellar temp with the fusel in the tertiary taste. Overall mot a great barleywine, but better than some in the style.

Slight earthy, maybe a little citrus hop flavors and bitterness but it stays true to it's English style. The mouthfeel is full with adequate carbonation.

For a barleywine this sure hasn't held up well, even over the past five or six months. It tastes of pale malts, syrup, brown sugar, carmel malts, and honey. It is a malt BOMB!

Mouthfeel is a heavy body with a medium/light carbonation - maybe a bit more carbonation then the style usually gets but I found it helped the finish be a bit cleaner rather then sweet and sticky.

The fruits really come through. Cherries, apples, plums. There's a bit of caramel and a slight bitter chocolate in the finish. Feels slick in your mouth and has a bit of viscosity.

Oddly though, the hops don't seem to be evident. Really has a syrup-like complexion. Very sweet tasting. It's like dipping your tongue into a can of malt extract. Wish it had more hops to balance out the sweetness of the malt sugars. It has a rather thick, full tasting mouthfeel. This is one to sip for a nightcap.

The pour resulted an a two finger head that started small, then built and then settled to a wispy lace. Smells like fruit. I can smell cranberry, prune, date, raisin, apricot, and brown sugar. The taste throws me back! A sweet mixture of flavors all shouting to be in the front! Currant, date, and prune are in the forefront of the battle, with brown sugar, raisin, and fig trying to keep up. There is a washing of alcohol in the mixture that makes me take notice to the kick this brew is going to give me. Somewhat average feeling in my mouth, some tingle on my soft palate. I don't think I would like to drink more than one of these at a sitting, just too sweet for my liking...good flavor, but just too sweet.

It is definitely a bit boozy, with the alcohol taste omnipresent through out the taste. A bit of hop bitterness comes out in the aftertaste.

Nose reveals dark fruit - raisins, prunes, and a slightly vinous quality, as well as a hint of alcohol in the mix. Taste consistent with nose, with the addition of pleasant malty backbone (toffee), as well as a light bittering at the finish. Mouthfeel is medium-light, with a carbonation that falls short of lively. There's also a slightly oily character to the mouthfeel.

I am very familiar with Blithering Idiot and was surprised to see that I hadn't yet reviewed it. I poured a 12 oz. bottle straight from the fridge into my tasting snifter. Right off I can tell I should have let it set on the counter to warm a bit, a cold beer will never release the aroma you're looking for when first poured. The color is almost a dark, rusty orange; it kind of reminds me of a glass of apple cider. The small opaque head disappears almost as soon as the entire beer is poured. The aroma is a reminiscent or other Barleywine I've had in the past. It's got a heavy does of hops and fruit, along with a little citrus. The taste is awesome...not too hot and not overly boozy. There is a pleasant after taste, but it is dismissed largely due to the cigarette that I'm enjoying as well. Overall this is a great beer from a brewery in my home state of Pennsylvania...one of these days I'm going to have to take the long haul out to the Weyerbacher Brewery in Easton and get a fresh growler full.

Which is fine, barley wine's aren't sessionable by any stretch of the imagination. But this one takes some effort. However, since this beer eventually becomes Insanity it gets a load of respect; you need a good base, and this is it. It just needs to be aged in oak before its great. And that may very well be this beer's most noteworthy and interesting fact. It's always fun to imagine with big beers what they will be like when aged awhile; it's why so many people cellar. This beer is unique because it's probably one of the only examples we have of beers that can be sampled both fresh and aged, commercially produced that is. And it's a beer that you can drink and realize why beer should, in some cases be cellared. This beer almost proves a point more than anything. It's kind of like listening to Kid A, and then hearing OK Computer for the first time. You knew that when you listened to Kid A that Radiohead was unique; OK Computer showed you how they got there.

I detected flavors of caramel, ripe dark fruits, and warming alcohol. Some hops are certainly present at the finish and lingering aftertaste.

It had an excellent scent, strongly hoppy and for some reason it reminded me of raison-walnut pie. For such a high ABV beer, it went down smooth, although it was a little rough in the mouth.

The yeast leaves a nice fruity taste and reminds me of an English yeast strain.

The taste was also alcohol dominant combined with a sharp turn to the carbonation with a slightly bitter finish. This tastes more like a wine or a cognac than a barleywine.

On the first swallow, I must say, I was not floored the way I expected to be. This was relatively mellow, although warming in my throat. The 11% is more than evident, but well balanced within a fig cookie, a prune shake, a sugarplum. If I need to cozy up to the fire this February with a barleywine, this will top my list.

The nose is still highly alcoholic, with sugar, caramel, and strong malt. The taste has mild caramel, and is mildly fruity. It's mellowed a lot, and hides the alcohol much better.

Hops are much lighter than expected indicating that this barley wine follows the English tradition rather than the American. Mouthfeel is rather warming and light for a barley wine.

Reminiscent of a Wee Heavy or perhaps even a Doppelbock. The taste leans heavily on the malt side also, with cinnamon raisin dominating. The bitterness remains low and there isn't much hop balance to go with. The alcohol is well disguised. Mouthfeel is slightly buttery and smooth. The carbonation is again mild, but adequate.

Considering the high ABV, this wasn't an overpowering barleywine. I could see myself having two of these before realizing the alcohol content. Nice mouthfeel.

Taste has a nice big malt backbone, highlighted with the same fruits from the nose, some caramel notes, a slight alcholic bite considering the ABV. This is definitely on the sweet side, just a slight hop bite, but the sweetness never becomes cloying. Full bodied with a low carbonation, this has a slightly syrupy mouthfeel.

3.6,-1.4,4,4,3.5,4,3,"Deep orange, clear except for a few yeast flecks floating around. Short beige head composed of small bubbles that produced a bit off lace. Malt and alcohol dominate the aroma. It's also a bit vinous, with some prune character, which gives it a kind of rum raisin smell. Alcohol is apparent in the flavour from the start. Moderate bitterness with a big vinous, caramel malt taste. Some toffee and ripe fruit kick in mid-point, leading to a caramel sweet finish. Dry and slightly astringent, the texture is fair and the carbonation is on the light side. An interesting barleywine. If the alcohol wasn't quite so forward (read ""hot and solvent-like"" in the flavour and aroma), it would be a lot more enjoyable. I can't rate it down too far though, because the rest of the character is actually quite nice. Maybe some aging would do this some good.","DrJay","Nov 02, 2005"

Taste was much like it smelled, but the alcohol got much stronger as the beer sat and also seemed to get sweeter as it sat which gave it a more complex dark fruit flavor. A mild fresh grass hop flavor was also present. Mouthfeel was really thick with low carbonation, but this is my first barley wine, so I don't know how it compares to others.

Grape taste along with apple, pears - just alot of fruit. The malt is more of an afterthought to this onslaught of great hoppy fruit flavors!! This suprised the hell outta me.

When I crack the bottle my nose is greeted by rum like notes of alcohol. The body of this beer is visually dense and hazy and a garnet/ruby brown. A hearty eggshell head forms upon pouring but receds to a thin frosting on top with a crusting around the outer rim of the pint. Taking a whiff of this beer I get the impression that this is more of an English style barleywine than American. Some hoppiness is in the nose, but it is dominated by rum-soaked raisons, and a vinous aroma. The English Orientation of this beer is confirmed upon tasting, tell-tale flavors of rum-soaked fruit, and grape-skin alongside the typical malt flavors of toffee and caramel . Bitterness levels are solid for the style, the hop flavors are a bit more subtle though I do pick up on some levels of piney and grapefruit hop flavors. The mouthfeel is great, perfectly coating.

The taste has a quite a few intermingling flavors. I'd say the overall tone is set by a brandy-like quality, but it is surrounded by licorice and caramel notes. The mouthfeel is certainly full bodied but very smooth. My favorite part of the beer is the finish. All those pronounced flavors transform into almost a full cocoa feel and for a split second its almost like you're drinking some chocolate milk. Love that!

I know a lot of people frown upon this in beers but I don't really find anything wrong with alcohol taste in an alcoholic beverage, it only makes sense. This beer could use more of a hop kick, that would make it great. As of now it's just passing as good. Smooth and sticky in the mouth.

Taste is all about the sweet malts, with strong alcohol at the outset. However, even the strong alcohol notes in this case aren't overpowering, even for such a high abv.

This pours a nice maroon color with a thin wispy head, and it smells incredibly vinous and fruity -- almost like raspberry wine. The taste just whacks you over the head with a fruitiness that I just don't like. It's sweet and juicy, and the actual malt sweetness seems lost. The hops are strong, no doubt, and hit your palate on the way down, leaving more bitterness than flavor. Drinkability suffers, even as a sipping beverage.

Mouthfeel is a little watery, but gives way to a wallop of pungent flavor. Pine and citrus with sweet malts and fruit riding beneath. Finish is an alochol burn followed by a lingering tingle.

The finish is a bit tongue numbing with alcohol and slightly sweet. Mouthfeel is full and syrupy will sufficient carbonation. This takes a hit on drinkability from the alcohol taste that numbs my tongue, I dare not have another one or I might not be able to feel my tongue at all.

Not a bad barleywine, but at the price of $15 for a 6 pack, I found it somewhat disappointing. Hard to drink more than one of these due to the sweetness which I found to be rather overbearing.

Smell is fruity malt and alcohol, but its not overpowering. Taste is like dark dried fruit with very sweet malt and very warm alcohol. Has just enough hops to balance the sweetness. Flavors are very ripe and agressive. Definately a sipping beer. I'd like to try this one with a little age.","yeagerbm","May 16, 2004"

But this could sit down in the cellar pretty well, and hopefully tame down some of the tannic qualities.

Taste is pretty much the same alcohol and more alcohol and very little of all else. Very chewy and full bodied also cause of the noticeable alcohol there is a warming everytime you take a sip.

This beer is sweetish but it has a nice balancing hop flavor that is subtle for an American, but it is pronounced enough that it is quite pleasing. The alcohol is not as evident in the taste, which is good. There is a bit of astringency in the finish, some fermentation by products (esters, higher alcohols, etc).

It poured a glistening deep amber with a thin white head, and as soon as I imbibed its powerful and sweet aroma, I knew I would be deliciously sipping this for a while. And I was right. The alcohol content is not equivocal, but it did not oppress the nutty malts and the floral esters.

Taste follows suit with slight dark fruit senses of raisin, plum, and a touch of banana, malts are chewy in the toffee with slight dark caramel. Quite smooth and creamy all the way through with some nicely done, slight piney and dried hop bitterness that enters in very subtle just after the midway point and gains some depth into the finish with some added malty thick depth as well. Feel is medium bodied, smooth and creamy with a couple hollow areas, some uneven texured velevtyness and not quite as hefty or strongly flavored as I like.

Assertive yeast esters comprised of ripe plum, figs and banana upfront in aroma, ensued by dark, sugary, treacle sweetness, butterscotch and light biscuit malt.  Not unlike a buttery fruitcake aromawise.  One dimensional caramel malt sweetness is perceived first, then widens into a combination of notes of roasted nuts and caramelized fruit sweetness that is somewhat datelike.  Mellow diacetyl persists as a constant undertone.  Moderate hop bitterness then offsets the strong malt sweetness well enough to prevent it from becoming cloying, but the overall character abounds in sweetness.  Subdued earthy Fuggles hop flavor.  Moderately bodied and agreeablely smooth in mouthfeel.  Finishes w/ a bittersweet combination of honey and hop bitters quickly fading.

Somewhere way in the background a hop raised its hand for recognition by the chairman, but it was never recognized by the floor so it left the meeting with reserved bitterness.

4.05,11,4,4,4,3.5,4.5,"Pours a slightly hazy ruby/amber with a nice looking creamy tan head that faded to a nice lasting film on top of the brew.  Nice creamy malt aromas are accompanied by some spicy alcohol smelss as well.  Sweet caramel maltiness is mixed well with some subtle fruity flavors and nice vinous qualities.  The brew gets a little woody towards the end before the spicy alcohol picks up the flavor.  The alcohol is rather subtle but provides some nice background flavor as more grape/raisin flavors finish the brew.  The brew is smooth but a little thinner than I like a BW to be.  For the alcohol content this is one damn drinkable brew.  I was pleasantly surprised when drinking this one.  The reviews up until recently had not been very good but I definintely liked this on.","Murph","Jul 28, 2002"
4.19,14.8,3.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Even older bottles of this seem to pour hazy. I'm not sure of the year since they don't mark them, but this is the older label (burgundy w/ gold letters... just letters, no jester) so it must be at least a year old, maybe two. It's aged well; no defects. The color has a nice organge cast to it and the aroma is pretty bold. Very full, sweet, caramelish malt. No hops in the aroma, but that's expected for an English-style barleywine. The flavor, however, is much more restrained than the malt suggests. Alot of drinkers view this in a negative light, but I feel it's perfectly acceptable. It's not as malty or hoppy as most American versions, but keep in mind that this is based on British barleywines, many of which are more along these lines. The flavor that is here is very well balanced, and very drinkable, rounding up the usual suspects: malty, toffee, brown sugar, dark fruits, alcohol. Not alot of hop flavor or bitterness, but just enough to balance very well. I think this is also a beer best served English-style - at a cellar temperature of 50 - 55 F - as more of its character is revealed. A bit of an underdog in the barleywine race, but still an excellent beer!","NeroFiddled","Jul 18, 2002"

2.04,-44.1,1,2,2.5,2,1.5,"Based on reading the other reviews, I'm inclined to believe that I've drawn a bad six-pack.  The bottles pour like wet trub rather than beer....nearly saturated with yeast and, I believe, flecks of hop petals.  Zero head and zero carbonation.  Smells intensely of alcohol.  Tastes of syrupy sweet malt and yeast.  Alcohol presence is dominating.  The bottles I bought are irrevocably flawed.  However, I'd be willing to try this beer again in the hopes that this was a one-time quality control oversight.","Suds","May 31, 2002"
3.82,4.7,3,3.5,4.5,4,3,"Sweet mother of pearl, this is a sweet beer (and by sweet, I mean sweet). Ruby brown color, with almost no appreciable head. Smells and tastes of brown sugar, dates, figs, prunes, and alcohol. Strong alcohol finish. Reminds me somewhat of a less refined version of some of the better English barley wines (Thomas Hardy's Ale, for instance). Not bad, though not a beer you can drink more than one of, for sure.","mophie","Mar 28, 2002"
2.86,-21.6,4,3,3,3,2,"Upon further research and palate refinement I have to downgrade this beer. Six months in the cellar and a steady diet of Victory and Sierra Nevada barleywines lessened my enthusiasm for Blithering Idiot. Way too sweet and lacking the complexity of the best of the style.","QXSTER1","Mar 17, 2002"
3.06,-16.2,4,3,3,3,3,"So-so for a barleywine, but nevertheless, it is still a quality beer.  I would consider it a barleywine that is not quite ready to drink, but could be good in time.","mmthompson33","Oct 22, 2001"
2.74,-24.9,2,3,3,3,2,"Notes: Not aged enough to quell the huge alcohol character, hops are lost. Alcohol seems a bit out of control. This is still a fun beer to drink and it shows you that it is a strong brew without a doubt. If you have a bottle of this don’t drink it yet, wait another year or so.","Jason","Oct 22, 2001"
4,9.6,4,4,4,4,4,"A darn good barley-wine.  I would be head-over-heels for this if I had never tasted Smuttynose Barley-Wine, but this ale can hold its own.  Perhaps a little too fruity, to be picky.  You should drink this ale in a comfortable chair - as you certainly won't be going anywhere soon.","marble","Sep 20, 2001"
