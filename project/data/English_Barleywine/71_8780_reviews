"Grabbed this one at a pub in Paddington. Thin beige cap over a bronze, clear beer. Decent retention with some clinging bubbles. Super fruity aroma, dried fruit like raisins and figs, along with a nearly tropical character and sturdy biscuit malt base. Solid bitterness didn't get in the way of fruity and malty flavors, as well as a bit of alcohol. Nicely balanced between hops, malt and yeast. A bit bready, biscuit, slight caramel, dried fruit. Full bodied with low carbonation, a bit drying, malty texture. I enjoyed this quite a bit. I'd love it if this was easier to get on the other side of the pond."

"Overall... a very nice strong ale, bitterness is present but in a perfect combination with malt and alcohol. One of my favourites, definitely a great English ale in his section (strongs ales) ."

"O: An English strong ale which is exceedingly smooth and well balanced."
""

"B G Score 97/100."
"O: Excellent drinkability. Another great Fuller's specimens. Highly recommended :)"
""
"An excellent beer and one that really packs a punch with a well hidden alcohol content for the most part and well balanced, complimentary flavours. A great beer for sipping away at."

"From an Aus perspective, almost a dead ringer for Coopers Vintage."
"O- Not a stormer for sure. Just a nicely balanced, quite refreshing strong ale which almost feels like a session ale"
"Reddish copper body with an offwhite head. Minimal lacing and only some modest retention. Nose has rich caramel notes, a sligth breadiness and some dried darker fruit notes. Taste is similar and offers a bit more complexity - dried fruits and caramel notes dominate and establish a really solid and quite English malt profile. Modest sweetness and a subtle dryness and bitterness in the finish. A bit of alcohol is interwoven within the flavour, and adds some complexity. Excellent mouthfeel and completely smooth on the palate. An excellent English strong ale, and I'd certainly have this again. Tremendously disappointed that I passed on this when bottles were available at the LCBO."

"Overall: would be a great fall beer, bringing to mind thoughts of pumpkin or sweet potato pie; very well balanced"
""
"Bottle: Poured a deep amber color ale with a nice foamy head with good retention and some light lacing notes. Aroma of caramelized malt with light dry malt notes. Taste is a solid mix between some caramelized malt notes with a somewhat dry finish. Body is about average with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Nice malt forward English strong ale with well balanced sweetness level though some limited complexity."
"Fuller's Golden Pride contradicts the official line that traditional British (not to mention big brand-name) beers must be ordinary and plain. This is inspired despite retaining its classic features. I've said it before but I've never said it with more confidence than now having tried this: there may be no better brewery in Britain, perhaps the world, than Fuller."
""
"O: I've wondered why they call it Golden Pride, but this just might be the Gold standard for an English strong ale... and even a big industrial brewer should take pride in that."
""
""
"O - A tasty ale that is relatively complex and flavourful while still being quite drinkable. Would definitely get again."
"Not a beer style I'd choose often, but think this is a good example thereof."
"Notes - Good medium mouthfeel. One of the beers I brought home from the brewery. I wish I could find it locally."
"I concur with the other reviews, except for a few points: the head did not last in my standard British pint glass. It fizzed out in less than 5 minutes. The lacing was also thin. The flavour is big, with complex malts upfront and a good balance of bitters. At 8.5% ABV, this is not a wimpy beer. Yes, I do believe I will have another. Later."
"Overall, another very nice beer from Fullers. I am pretty impressed by the consistency of this brewery. A tasty beer that is remarkably drinkable despite the strength."
"O/D - Really easy drinking. Not overly complex like you'd find in a lot of strong ales, but it sure does the trick. I could drink this all day. Worth a shot. Keeping with Fuller's quality standards."
"Reddish copper colour, collar of white head with touches of lace. Smell is quite fruity followed by rich malts and sweet caramel scents, getting some raisin and dried fruits, light alcohol scents and toffee. Taste is quite rich and malty, mild hop bitterness, fruity with nice berry flavours in the finish, caramel and toffee sweetness as well. Lightly syrupy, light-med carbonation, fairly full bodied. Solid drinking, strong and flavourful, a very pleasant beer."
"Another tremendously drinkable Fuller's ale that should be bought whenever it is available."
"Overall – This is basically a barleywine.. great full flavour and perfect to drink as a winter warmer. I'm glad I had the chance to try it.. and I didn't have to go far to get it, which is a bonus."
"Pours a clear copper colour into an English pint. Thin but creamy off-white head with a long-lasting cap that laces well. Smells very sweet, mostly of toffee and subtle hints of fruit and nuts. Sweet toffee and bready malt flavours up front, which are quickly overtaken by the alcoholic warmth which plays off of the faint bitterness. The alcohol fades into a slight warming finish that's accented by dark fruit and nuts. Soft and creamy carbonation, decent slightly oily body. A delicious sipper that straddles the boundary between English strong ales and barleywines."
"For those who want a bit more out of their pale ales, but don't want to go too far into barleywine territory, this is the ticket. Another fine brew from Fullers, and definitely among the better strong ales I've come across. Making this one a Christmas brew for sure!"
"D: A bridge between strong ales and barleywines, bursting with complex, fruit-forward flavours while keeping a well-balanced medium body. Seek it out, let it warm, and sip it slowly."
"D - Good drink; great first beer in the UK; I really like the taste in this beer, its well balanced and has a very traditional barley-wine taste; could have had more body"
"Overall, Golden Pride is a delectable, nuanced cross between an English Strong Ale and barley wine. It packs all the flavours of the latter style with the drinkability of the former. Just a beauty of a beer; I hope the LCBO re-stocks this limited release so I can grab more bottles."
"Despite classed as English Strong Ale here this a Barleywine and rated like that. In short: an English Barleywine with strong and complex maltiness, fruitiness and orange-like aroma/flavor. (Best before 12-08-2011, into tulip)"
"As far as I can remember, this is my first time tasting an English strong ale. So far, I think I can say I like this style and this beer in particular. It's kind of like a ""light"" barleywine--and I mean this in a good way. Lot's of nice malty, fruity flavor, but lighter body and a bit smoother drinking. Definitely worth trying."
"Overall a really nice English barleywine / old ale / strong ale. Can't deny its quality. Distinct from 1845 which had more toffee qualities and bittering hops. This is its big, less subtle brother."
"Overall: A nice beer. Nothing to complain about really. Given its strength I'm surprised it doesn't cost more. I'd drink it alone to reward myself, or on a nice, not too hectic evening with friends, and maybe a steady meat dish."
"Instead, you get an elegant, sexily sweet malt driven sipper. Almost like melted toffee. Carbonation is nice and low helping this puppy slide down nice and smooth. Alcohol is nicely in check too. What's not to like?"
"Still it's a good, warming beer."
"Picked this up at the biggest beer store in the UK, Beers of Europe Ltd. Cear copper-amber pour with quickly fading two finger head and minimal lacing. Very unique nose for a British beer. It was typically malty, but also had a strong aroma of dark fruit and alcohol as well as hints of biscuits and tea. The taste is complex, full bodied and rich. Tons of oak and vanilla, with hints of caramel, toffee, grape skins, rum, and a touch of orange peel. Incredibly smooth and drinkable for a big beer. I'm kicking myself for only grabbing one of these. This is everything the Fuller's Vintage should be and isn't for less than half the price. Can't wait for my next visit to the UK!"
"Soft carbonation could be higher."
"Quite impressed by the head retention here. I think it causes confusion with more potent headless barley wines like Thomas Hardy's Ale but this is most definitely a barley wine. And a good introduction to the English style as well. Very fine."
"Drinkability : a very good beer in the style English Strong Ale (near Barley Wine style, 8,5% ABV)"
"This was a real ale cask, a bit past it's prime."
"You can feel the heaviness in your mouth, both from flavours, as from the alcohol. The stomach positively feels warm and glows while drinking this brew. If one is used to beers you can drink one after another, you have to stop and reconsider here. This is a one for the winter night fireplace beer only."
"Notes: Best before 01/01/11. A solid beer that is a good example of an English Strong Ale. A touch on the sweet side, but it has enough to counterbalance that. Dangerously easy to drink given the ABV. It didn't necessarily blow me away, but it is definitely worth getting a deserve a place near the top as far as English Strong Ales are concerned."
"Not a bad strong ale. (I agree with an earlier reviewer that this is almost a barley wine)"
"On cask at bar Volo. Pours copper to amber with a thick creamy head. The nose is floral, with a touch of herbs, lots of bright fruits, mild biscuit and a touch of vinegar. Tastes of apricots, little bready, some grassy undertones, sweet and caramel tones. A touch of whiskey. It's a heavy mouthfeel. Nice and thick, a little chewy, full bodied, and the alcohol isn't too brash. Very balanced in the cask."
"A pretty damn good beer from Fullers, whatever style it is (pssst.... its a barley wine)."
"Over all, a great beer that surprised me as it was really cheap here in Sweden, and the last time I tried it, I have a hazy memory of me almost pouring it down the drain due to being too sickish and cloyingy sweet."
"Reminds me greatly of a one to two year old Bigfoot, however as this is more than likely more traditional, maybe it should be the other way around."
"Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with low carbonation, pretty damn smooth for the ABV and works great on cask. Good work Ralph getting firkins of this stuff."
"Much better in the bottle 2 years later, and that is the rerate. Good caramel and sweetness."
"There are few beers in the world better than a well made English Strong Ale and this is up there with the best, I take my hat off to Fuller's, this is one well crafted beer and well worth the extra couple of pence I paid for it."
"This is a beer that is meant to be savoured, like a fine brandy or whiskey. Even though I feel that some more variations in taste are left to be desired, it is still a fine brew."
"OVERALL: Certainly a very enjoyable beer. It was tasty and surprisingly drinkable for the ABV, with only the rough and aggressive palate holding it back in the ratings for me. The back of the bottle reads, ""This is the finest example of our brewers' art," and I'd certainly like to commend them on their fine masterpiece. Recommended."
"D - Quite nice but something to sip on over the course of an hour or so."
"D: This is a perfect beer for sitting down and talking with your boys - a ""Talk-beer"""
"Good but not great. I would buy Golden Pride again, as it makes a fine winter night's sipper. The rest of the time, its (alcoholic) strength is its greatest weakness."
"Not golden, as it turns out - more of a nectarine skin-amber brown. Its parchment head is not very impressive in terms of size or retention, but the nose is lovely: plenty of caramel/toffee malts to anchor more volatile, spicy notes of ginger, lemon, brandy, and a little bit of leafy/piney hops. Sweet on the palate with a nice, sticky, lush (and a bit syrupy) body, nicely balanced by a punch of fresh, citric hops and warm alcohol spice. Vanilla, rum, and perfumey floral notes lend a festive feel to a sweet, mellow, fruity barleywine base. Quite drinkable despite its strength; a good ""fireplace beer," but I can imagine this could even be refreshing if served chilled. It's also nice with fried fish, especially with a bit of lemon."
"In general, a good strong ale from Fuller's, and quite some value for the money around since it costs only 17.90 SEK which is slightly less than 2 USD."
"Alcohol is not covered well. The malty complexity quickly turns bitter in the finish (too quickly). I'm thinking aging would help to bring things together, but that's just a guess. As it is it is sweet and boozy turning quickly to a bitter aftertaste. Still, it is an interesting brew with some nice malty complexities going on."
"Drinkability: Drinkable? You freaking bet, it's full in character resounding in smell and taste, and plenty of it will knock ya of yer boots - what more could you ask for?"
"D: A good beer, but nothing spectacular. It's slightly too focused on sweet flavors. The alcohol isn't really that overly prominent, but still it doesn't feel totally integrated with the other flavors. I liked it, but I think there are better strong ales out there."
"Small white head, amber colour, some lacing. Aroma is sweet, malty, jam, oranges, solvents, alcohol. Flavour is sweet, jam, sugar,almonds, oranges and some hops in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is very smooth, small bubbles. I have been told that this is supposed to be similar to a barleywine in character, but it wasn't to me, good beer though."
"In the mouth, you get slapped with a big body and kick of booze. Once you get passed that, it's great. Strong nutty flavor, Toasted grain with caramel and toffee notes make this a stronger pale ale to my taste, but a well constructed one. Some fruity undertones beneath. The stomach warms up the further I go along. This is just a damn good ale."
"Being used to beer which one can just drink and drink again I had to adjust my sights a little.Personally, bearing in mind the sheer amount of flavour packed into the brew, I regard it more as a barley wine rather than a beer.Semantics? Perhaps but that's how I see it."
"Mouthfeel was smooth. Overall a fairly complex and strong warming earthy brew."
"Had to have one of these when I saw it in the fridge in a Fuller's in North Greenwich - this is one of the best English beers i've ever had. Pours a rich goldy-red, a wonderfully vivid colour, with minimal head. Smell is not hugely strong, but sweet and fruity. It was perhaps a bit too cold (i've never quite discovered the best temperature to serve this beer at), but there are a lot of fruit flavours in here, with the satisfying alcoholic kick coming in towards the finish. Superbly well-balanced for a beer of its strength, nowhere near as heavy as most barley wines. And dangerously drinkable - you'll find it an effort of will to go back to a weaker beer after this..."
"Fullers Golden Pride is a very good example that strong ales can be smooth and highly drinkable. The taste is very malty but with a kick of hops and to my suprise not a heavy ale. This is one of my prefered Barley Wines and it's so easy to forget how strong they are and have a few to many. Well done Fullers."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easy, not too filling, good kick, nice representation of style, this is a very good beer that I could stick with for the duration of the evening."
"Pazzo's took the Ole Winter Ale off tap for a few hours to share this treasure of a beer with their patrons. Certainly glad I was there. This beer is quite special, reminding me of the Vintage Ales, with a more subdued alcohol complex and power in the flavors. The first sip delivers a plethera of complexity, tons of flavors, and spicy character. Certainly rests on a foundation, built on malts. Shows a lot of cotton-candy sweetness, berries, cherries, dates, figs, plumbs, nuts, caramel, and lightly toasted breads. Balanced by firm, pungent hops with a faint herbal tone. Alcohols are warming, but weave nicely into the complex malts until they are hardly noticed. Finishes sweet, but balanced and with a long sherry-like lingering."
"Drinkability - A powerful and complex beer, rich and satisfying. However, its strength and richness makes this beer not for all occasions. Perhaps as an digestif or as a winter warmer to combat cold conditions. This inflexibility marks it down in my personal tastes."
"This is a clearly well crafted beer; balanced, matured and all. But I just dont appreciate the style enough to give it a higher grade. And in fact, I prefer the Strong Ale from Swedish brewery Slottskällans."
"Oxidation is mildly apparent with a wet cardboard aftertaste, and freshers days have since passed, but all in all, she held up pretty damn good."
"Overall - A nice warming brew for sipping... an excellent example of the style... recommended..."
"M: very rich yet smooth on the palate, thankfully not too sharp for its high alc. strength; 100% body, no more no less, while the rich flavour is tuned quite nicely to make it rather easy to sip!! An impressive beer by the Fuller's. It used to be available only in 330ml bottles around four years ago as I remember it, and now it comes in bigger bottles, maybe due to higher popularity I reckon? But this beer is best to be shared b/w buddies over a fireside chat, otherwise it could trick people to consume too much without even feeling the strength!!"
"Acquired at Sainsbury's Vauxhall, a supermarket, in London last May. Been in the fridge ever since. Pours a beautiful reddish brown, belying the ""golden"" on the label. then again, I didn't think this was going to be a pale beer. Aroma is sweet with slight caramels and a ""Dry smell"" that I'm attributing to the hops. Big caramel and toffee with very bitter earthy hops in there. Huge. Almost like a proper English version of Arrogant Bastard. Call him a Rough Yob. Kind of like drinking candy. Sweet and malty and yum and yum and yum. Balanced with the hops, but not like the licorice taste of 1845. Mouthfeel is lightly carbonated and proper, and drinkability goes through the roof with its lovely English character."
"Pretty scrumptious beer!"
"330 ml bottle, at The Beehive, Brentford, London. Copper coloured, moderate head. Malty sweet aroma with hints of dried fruits, oak and sherry. Flavour is malty sweet with oak, dried figs and dusty hops. Interesting beer. Warming mouthfeel, as expected from an 8.5% ABV beer."
"A very good strong ale, as far as it being a scotch wee heavy, methinks not, more a strong ale or barely wine, very potent alcohol on the breath, not something you'd want to even touch if your driving"
"This is a ""big"" beer that has a great taste. Sadly i think the alcohol is way to overwhelming but its nice to sit and sip on this one."
"The mouthfeel is very smooth with medium amounts of carbonation. The drinkability is fine but a bit encumbered by a spicy alcohol aftertaste. Over all a very great beer, though not as great as the label claims, that goes for Fuller's ESB."
"The smell is strong - mostly honey, with some hints of hops as well. The taste is sweet, thick and doughy, with a pleasant tingly, hoppy aftertaste. Not much depth to this, but otherwise a nice beer."
"What a lovely colour this beer has. It pours a amber colour into the glass, with a medium thick head. That disappear quickly, leaving a thin lacing on the glass. It has a big fruity smell with hints of caramel and fudge. It has a rich bittreness in the taste and also some fruity taste. Some hints of orange??? Even some caramel in the after taste. It is a strong beer but you only feel the warmth of the alcohol. This is a very nice beer and like the name says it is pride of Fullers."
"Don't confuse with a scotch heavy ale after all my talk of caramel malt. This is much lighter in colour and texture. Someone mentioned golden syrup, and that does seem a fairly good analogue. Just with a little more depth of flavour than the aforementioned syrup. It's very good, I like it."
