"Bam, Bam, Bam, and more Bam! But not really much after that."
"O: got very little hop profile in either the nose or the flavor;"

"Taste:  A nice combination of bitter and sweet toffee with tons of fig.  Dark sweet bread with hot alcohol at the end."

"22 ounce bottle into snifter; no bottle dating, but likely from the January 2011 initial release(282 10 bottle manufacture code). Pours hazy deep reddish copper color with a 2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big caramel, toffee, toast, brown bread, biscuit, nuttiness, light chocolate, raisin, plum, fig, pear, apple, cherry, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast ester, and earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of big caramel, toffee, toast, brown bread, biscuit, nuttiness, light chocolate, raisin, plum, fig, pear, apple, cherry, herbal, grass, pepper, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Fair amount of earthy/spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toffee, toast, brown bread, biscuit, nuttiness, light chocolate, raisin, plum, fig, pear, apple, cherry, herbal, grass, pepper, and yeast/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and fruity yeast ester flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very smooth, creamy, and fairly slick/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice English barelywine style. All around good complexity, balance, and robustness of dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and fruit yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A very enjoyable offering."

"Huge toffee and toasted caramel aroma, with fruity esters and higher alcohol. Flavor is less sweet than aroma indicates. Fruity character overwhelms somewhat."

"22oz. bottle: This one pours a slightly hazy amber color. There was about a finger of a frothy tan head that leaves a bit of lacing. It has a nice nose. It has a subdued sweetness. Some caramel, toffee, a touch of chocolate, perhaps even a bit of smokiness. The taste is good. Just a bit of sweetness. Some caramel, dark fruits, breadiness, faint chocolate, raisin. I get a little something new with each sip. I would definitely buy again!"

"Overall: I like this style and this one is about average as to what I have had. Very malty, but nothing really jumps out like others I have had in the style. I will pass on this in the future."
"Big malty, spicy, boozy entry. Moderate sweetness. Big caramel and Burnt/charred brown sugar. Fruity, plumy/figiness (from malts). Firm citrus- grapefruit, orange, slight tangerine notes. Bold black pepper spiciness. Woody, earthy dampness noted from hops. Pale muted malts lie in the background. Decent amount of smokiness detected. Hoppy clean bitterness. Minimal hoppy resins stick to the palate. Slight cereal graininess in the finish. Carbonation is adequate, non contributory. Alcohol warms as it travels. Overall, the booziness, bittering hoppy qualities, and increased spiciness make this beer a little too high octane for the average craft beer drinker, especially for an English beer. The beer definitely has it's moments, just won't be appreciated by most. To me, it's as if an English brewer was asked to make an American Barleywine. Interesting. I'll have another."

"Pour into wide mouth clear pint beer glass ... nice color, great aroma, nice small bubble head .. first taste .. OMGosh, one word: Freak'n Awesome .. continued sipping, enjoying the aroma, the bitter but smooth hoppiness .. reminded me of a Barley Wine. I let it sit for a while, and warm up .. and it just got better, topping in flavor well into the high 50's, low 60's .. never got bad.. good from the 1st sip to the last. Now on my top 10, no, top 5!"
"NOTE: bottle was from 2012, aged about 16 months."
"Taste is rich, full of brandied, candied fruits, caramelised bread, spicy raisiny character, some woody-peppery bitterness & bite supporting a rich sweetness. Feel is full, not too oily or thick, a bit lively, lots of rich toast in aftertaste."
""
" The taste has a a woody hop flavor mixed with a honey/caramel taste from the malt which is sweet but not cloying, a bit of yeast fruitiness comes through but alcohol flavor soon takes over with some oxidation present in the taste. I liked this for the most part, it is not very cohesive and kind of hits you randomly with hops adding a spiced impact yet a nice dose of malt sweetness is present. Iike the concept more than the actual flavor"

"O - Eh not really good, just too much of everything, the bourbon barrel version of this is much better."
""
""
""
""
""
"This one's pretty atrocious, honestly. Don't buy it."
""
""
""
"Hot damn this is a great, full flavored sipping barleywine. I will certainly look for this again, as I feel like I paid ~$8 for the 22 oz bottle. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a new barleywine to try."
""
""
""
""
"In general an excellent beer. Perhaps other reviewers served it too cold or in a glass which doesn't enhance the English Barley Wine consistency."

"Overall – A sweet but enjoyable barley wine. A nice slow sipper and worth a try."

"Pours a clear dark orange with a foamy khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, caramel, and some fruity aromas. Taste is much the same with a fruity finish. There is a mild bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with some nice aromas and flavors."
""
""
""
"This beer excels at maintaning its British roots while taking on American boldness. A very good strong ale."
""
"O- Taking the style into consideration not bad at all, but this is a very aggressive ESB that could use some more balance to it. Worth a try I suppose."
""
"A pretty good high ABV malt bomb. I certainly got the ""warming malty finish"" described on the bottle label, but not any ""spicy hop aroma"". Still, there is plenty of good stuff going on with this beer. Definitely not a session brew, but does go down well while watching some Sunday football..."

"22 ounce bottle. I know I've had this beer a little while, but I just don't remember exactly how long so I have no idea how old it is (no date on the bottle). Served in a snifter, the beer pours a hazy dark copper color with an inch tan head. Head retention is decent, and there's a lot of lacing left behind on the glass. Aroma is nice and malty, the brew smells like caramel, toffee, butterscotch, dark fruit and some bready malt. The taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also the addition of some booze, nuts, and a bit of spice. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's creamy and slick with a good amount of carbonation. I think it's a good overall brew. I'd like to try this fresher in the future, but I definitely liked this beer with some age on it."
""
""
""
"It has potential, this one, but does not really deliver. A bit to much bitterness and stickyness."
""
"O- It's a good beer, but would be better classified as an old aie."
""
""
"O: this thing is a beast, not only will I be drinking water after this, but my palate feels wrecked. Oh well, no big deal. Just curious, I wonder if this is more of a barleywine? I'd probably only have this again on special occasions or see if I could find it on tap somewhere."
""
""
"O: This really doubles the style guidelines for this beer, so its hard to really judge it based on the style, but the alcohol taste is a little too overwhelming. I would really consider this much closer to an English Barleywine."
""
"Considering its strength (which I love) the beer isn't that difficult to drink because the alcohol is well hidden from the taste."
"(originally reviewed: 07-12-2011)"
"This probably should come in a smaller bottle. I know 22's are meant to share, but why can't we get a 7oz of this instead?"
"Bit weird, a bit odd but there's plenty of salvageable material here, and I wish I just warmed to this more readily."
""
"Overall, this is a beer of contrasts. There are some really interesting things to it, and some things that just don't work at all. I like the really strong English bitterness, but I feel as though that would have been better utilised in a beer half its strength."

"This beer is a light chestnut color with a thin white head. It's a glassy-clear liquid, essentially still, a malt and hop aroma. Dark grain, ethanol, toasted wood, and spicy hops. The spiciness carries over to the flavor, which is unfortunately disjointed. It's a jumble of sweetness, nearly independent of the malt, and alcoholic hotness. Fresh and sharp bitterness is a fleeting sensation. The finish is lingering, sweet, and warm. It's full in body and very intense."
"Overall – interesting brew. Tastes a bit like a strong beer mixed with scotch or whisky. It’s a good mix though. Good-tasting and interesting to think about."
"Been in the cellar for about 8 months and I wish I had tried it sooner because I love it. Beautiful orange and amber color. The smell is sweet and boozey with some biscuit and sweet fruit. The taste is by no way balanced yet flows pretty well and is interesting. It goes from quick biscuit to fruit with a (in my opinion) smooth hop and a nice boozey finish. The mouth feel is slick and comforting and the finish lingers long enough but doesn't over stay its welcome. Over all if i saw it on a menu or in a store I would make the purchase without hesitation."

"As a friend out it, ""It's just too...double, and not enough thumper."""

""
""

"Overall: Less ""thump"" than I was hoping for. Unless they're referring to the sound you make when you hit the ground."
""
""
""
""
""
"O-Overall this a very good brew. I dig the smell and taste of the beer. I know this is an amped up version of the Old Thumper Ale, but I thought this was more close to the Export Ale. I think this would pair well with some BBQ."
""
""
""
""
"Absolutely formidable, intense, and amazing. So rich, so complex, so round, so fully packed. Bright, fierce, indomitable. Mmmm. I like this. Ought to pick up more for the winter months. It's coming. Gonna need a big, wooly, warming ale like this."
"O-nice flavors and suprisingly easy drinking high alcohol beer"
"O: Overall, this is a nice beer and one that would work nicely both for fans of barleywine, and those who favor bitters, ESB's, and brown ales but want something a little bigger."
"Drinkability: This, to me, doesn't feel like a brew with this power. I've never had the original, so maybe that makes me not as much of an expert as I should be? I think balance is the key, and as much as I'm enjoying this, this isn't the case. Still, check it out."
"I find it hard to believe this beer scored so low in other's ratings. It's both beautiful and scrumptious. It poured like a thick barley wine with a slow to emerge beige 1"" head. In masstone it's a burnt sienna brown but held to the light there's a pretty hazy reddish tint. Smell is great with rich malt, caramel, and hops but not a slap in the face amount of them. Taste is delicious, kind of like candied hops. Rich, sweet, with caramel, toffee, and barley wine attributes. I don't always drink sweet or bold beers but I find this Old Thumper very appealing. And the 11.2% alcohol is well hidden, not a boozy burning mess in my opinion. I say nice job Shipyard."
"Taste is syrupy sweet to start, strong pine prickling in the middle, and a warm alcohol close than intensifies over time. Mouthfeel is pretty smooth, and drinkability is okay as well. Seems like everything in this brew is intensified from the original Old Thumper, for better or worse."
"Overall: Certainly not your everyday beer, This one tries to accomplish many tastes with a heavy alcohol content."
"Hops and toastiness start to dominate after awhile and may benefit from some aging. It is an amazingly drinkable beer for 10%, not too heavy feel and little alcohol in taste and warming. I really don’t think it’s worth the expense at this point but possibly in a year or 2."
"D - Quite a big, heavy beer. The sugar character is as cloying as one would expect with some oddly strong, spicy notes that further enhance the effect and make it even more of a sipping beer. Not a drain pour, but not particularly enjoyable either, about what I have come to expect from Shipyard."
"The alcohol is quite present in the taste. Also, there is a bittering hop that I didn't notice in the smell. The swallow and aftertaste is very warming. I think it is too much of a ""good"" thing. I would not categorize this as an ESB. I think it is far too potent. Barley Wine is a better description. The body matches this well: Rich mouthfeel with enough carbonation to prevent it from being cloy. In the end, there's too much alcohol to make this work."
"overall this is not a bad brew at all; i can see where it wouldn't appeal to some but IMO it's certainly worth i try."
"Old Thumper is a beer that I really enjoy,having it on cask in Kennebunkport was a thrill,I just wonder why this beer was made,but I actually kinda liked it.Poured into an imperial nonic a rich copper color with a thinner but well retained head.The ringwood yeast brings the big buttery notes along with gummy fruit esters and sweet alcohol,flavors are buttery caramel and big sweet alcohol,the hops are really subdued.To me this is a ringwood yeast dominated English Barleywine with its big sweetness and alcohol.I like this beer as a sipper but its not overly complex in nature,Iam glad I tried it."
"Overall, it's OK, and certainly interesting; worth trying, but I wouldn't want to have it all that often. It's kind of a harsh beer, and would probably be best in fairly small portions."
"Overall-This is not an everyday beer, and I don't want to drink more then maybe 8 oz at a time.(I couldn't finish the 11oz that I poured) A creative beer but not very drinkable."
"This is an average extreme beer from Shipyard. I don't enjoy it as much as Smashed Pumpkin or some members of Pugsley's Signature Series. Double Thumper won't replace regular Old Thumper for me, especially when its on cask at the Great Lost Bear."
"Pours an attractive clear coppery red-brown with a fairly thick and somewhat persistent pale coppery-tan head that leaves a bit of lacing. Strong aroma is malty and a little yeasty with a firm overtone of apple brandy. Sharp, malty flavor has a strong brandy tang and hints of hoppy bitterness and caramel, with just a whisper of fruity sweetness. Ragged texture is fairly fizzy and leaves behind a mild but persistent tingle."
"This is a slightly sweet, dense scone slathered in a sweet, but tangy apricot jam. This is delicious and exceeds my expectations, especially for its high ABV, it is immensely drinkable."
"Overall: A ghastly brew that's downright hard to drink. Instead of a Double Thumper, I'd rather have had two Thumpers. I was a bit leery of this one once I saw the ABV listing, but thought to myself, ""How bad could it be?"" Pretty bad, apparently."
"Poured a clear amber, faintly reddish with about an inch and a half of head. The aroma has a dark sweetness. An earthy must with some prunes and red grapes. The taste has a lot of dark fruity malts a large amount of sweetness and an alcohol bite on the finish. Dry and slightly sour for the finish but overall very sweet and dark."
"I'm glad to have tried this beer. It's not really my style of beer, but it's something I'd drink again."
"Reading about this one on a Beer Advocate forum, I was very excited to try it. I got the opportunity when I saw it on the shelf at BevMo in San Diego. Wow! To be completely honest, this beer was terrible. Aromas of sweet malt, butter and alcohol. Similar on the palate, medium bodied and loaded with diacetyl. The alcohol kept me going on the bottle, but it wasnt fun."
"Overall I'd say that this beer was worth trying and I'd probably also try it on draft if i see it but I won't see it out."
"O- By the time I finished this, I wasn’t so sure about the vinous qualities I initially picked up on in the mouthfeel. Once the hops kick in, it feels much heavier and drier, but there are occasional traces of the initial mouthfeel, probably attributable to the high Alcohol By Volume. The finish is bitter and lingering. This one’s a mixed bag."
" This one is a beastie beer that is WAY to easy to drink !"
"Cheers!"
"Not an easy drinker here - lots to handle here, and the last few ounces are a struggle. A little pricy for what you get - just my take."
"Finish carries through with the pine bitter character. This could perhaps be a sipper but not all that appealing. Do not see with food."
"Poured into a snifter. Hazy golden amber in appearance. Good lacing but faint head. Aroma is of mainly yeast. Not impressive. Some citrus, some hops, but mainly yeast. Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Taste is boozy and yeasty. There is some citrusy hops, some nuttiness. Yeast flavor just is overbearing. I had this on tap before the bottle and on tap it was a pretty good beer. From the bottle, it is almost a completely different brew."
"Drinkability is good. This does lack a little in the complexity department but it's a good beer."
"The mouthfeel was decent, but honestly seemed a little light bodied for the style. This was one of the better characteristics however. Overall, this is not something I enjoyed drinking, and I considered pouring it for a while. I was very disappointed in the brew, and most certainly will not purchase another..."
"D - Maybe not my style?"
"O: Bitterness and high alcohol make this an interesting beer, but I don't think I'd want to drink more than one."
"Notes: I'm rarely overpowered by a beer and love my big beers, but this one and its unrestrained boozy bitterness almost did me in. Unfortunately it wasn't particularly in a good way with a near nil drinkability and at $7.50/22oz."
"Not sure if Double Old Thumper is really any better than the regular version since I haven't really cared for either. If I'm picking up Shipyard, it's going to be Prelude."
"Very solid beer. Has the malt ive been looking for and with the increase in everything this yeast strain really takes on a different character. This beer does not drink like an 11 percent beer. Dangerously quaffable and enjoyable. Someone else said more like an barleywine and would like to see how it ages. I would too, I dont think it will get too much better but why the hell not?"
"Finally found it! 22oz bomber purchased at McKinnon's in Salem. Pours a crystal-clear amber-red body with pretty much no head to speak of. Nut, butter, bread, and just a touch of booze in the aroma. Bready, fruity, with nut, touch of butter, and just a hint of alcohol, though it's more of a warming than a flavor. Full bodied bordering on viscous, with low carbonation. A meal of a beer. A sipper for sure. This reminds me more of an English barleywine than an ESB. I'd be interested to see if/how this ages."
"This beer is simply overwhelming. While I like big beers, this tastes like a beer cocktail. I'm halfway through this monster, and I'm not sure I'll be finishing it."
"O- Tough to finish one and the unpleasant bitterness makes me reticent to revisit this one. It's more than other ESBs as this is more astringent than other bitters..."
"Final thought - Shipyard, please try lowering your prices. I might want to drink your beer more often"
"D- Overall, I'm not a huge fan of this beer. It will be difficult to drink this entire bottle without dumping some down the drain."
"D: With this being my first of the style I liked it. Will try more in this style and this one again."
"d: There is some novelty value here, but overall this is a miss for me. I think calling this an ESB is a misleading mistake. To be fair though, they don't call it an ESB on their website. I think American strong ale or barleywine would be much more apt."
"Surprisingly the mouthfeel was not bad at all. It would have been a 4.5 or 5.0 if it wasn't for the slightly excessive alcohol heat. The appearance was great. Nice caramel color and very clear."
"D: To say this beer has characteristics of spicy hops is an understatement. This is seriously spicy throughout with a very bitter aftertaste. This is a good beer, but the spice is what really is throwing me off. I am a big fan of Old Thumper and was looking forward to the double, but sadly, I think I enjoy Old Thumper quite a bit more."
"D: Considering its strength, the beer isn't that difficult to drink because the alcohol is well hidden from the taste."
"Worth a try if you liked the other imperial offerings from Shipyard. I enjoyed Smashed Pumpkin and ditto on this offering."
"D-A big bruiser of a beer that one must drink with some respect. I really enjoyed the fruity notes combined with the malt sweetness. An enjoyable sipper for sure. Well done Shipyard ramping Old Thumper up to an eleven!"
"Drinkability- Once is enough for this one."
"The bomber at one sitting was more than enough. Still, would drink it again."
"Drinkabilty is piss poor."
"Pours a one finger off-white head that fades very slowly, leaving a good lace. Nice crystal clear amber color. Medium carbonation and medium-bodied. light piney hop nose and flavor is slight caramel, piney hops and more malty than expected. Light bitter aftertaste. High ABV is hidden but is warming. $7.99 for a 22oz bottle from Northend Superette Manchester, NH."
"All this being said, I think Shipyard slugged a homerun with this one. My wife loves the Smashed Pumpkin and hated this one. Me, I really loved this one and while I still enjoy the Smashed Pumpkin, I'd much rather be sipping this mac daddy. I picked up a bottle this past week (at Shipyard) while on business in Maine because I really wanted to try this one. I'm back up there in a few weeks and I'll be stopping by again to get more bottles and cellar a few to see where they go. Big beers like this often get better with age and this one is already good when it's young. A very interesting observation is the bottled version seems to be far hoppier than the tap version. Definitely prefer the bottle which I can't say about very many beers."
"Note: Bonus points in that this is highly reminiscent of the original Old Thumper, which is an old favorite of mine from when I lived in Beantown : )"
"i found it very strong starting in my mouth but finished smooth in down the throat.at first i was a little nervous thiking that it might be to powering but was surprised how is it ws to drink. its something i would drink slow to savory the taste.i would drink it again"
"D-This beer has good drinkability but the hop bitterness starts to accumulate in the back of the mouth. This is fine because at 11-2% ABV, you wouldn't be drinking more than one (bomber) of this anyway."
"I need to put this side-by-side with Old Thumper IMO, this, with the exception that it is 11% ABV, is maybe more accessible than the original."
"D-Not high in the drinkability category. Too boozy. Would like some more balance perhaps with a stronger hop profile. Took me forever to drink."
"From the 22 fl. oz. bottle. It pours a nice handsome copper-amber with a nice inch or so head. Good clarity. The aroma is malty with noticeable Ringwood yeasts. The body comes in at about medium. Unlike the original Old Thumper the Ringwood yeasts are not quite as obvious but they do touch the nose. The taste has a nice malty characteristic with a muted hoppy ending. The double-digit ABV is barely noticeable."
"D- At 11.2% it maybe too drinkable. I would buy it again but I would split it with a friend. Not a bad English barley wine."
"D- Scary drinkable at 11.2%. Wish I was trying it with food. The label says it pairs well with ribs, lamb, hearty stews and casseroles. Would probably be great to cook with as well."
