"Overall an amazing beer. Nose is potentially the best of a barleywine I've ever had. Just love the huge dark fruits, bourbon but also chocolate and caramel. Best of both worlds."

""
""
""
""
"Great beer, all time great"
""
""
""
"I enjoy barleywines but tend to be more of a fan of stouts. This really blew me away. Poured, 6 months after bottling)  dark as night, virtually no head. Smell was pleasent but mild. Taste sweet with big burbon notes and raisin."

"Bottle. Dark brown pour with a kaki head. Dark fruit and barrel aromas. Big bourbon, dark fruit, brown sugar, caramel notes dominate. Vanilla, and oaky low lights. Average body. Very good mouthfeel. Doesn’t drink like a 15%er. A little time in the bottle might help this beer."

"Overall - Can't think of many other beers of this style I would rank ahead of this.  Maybe J.W. Lee's off the top of my head but this is an excellent representation of the barleywine style.  If you find it, don't pay attention to the price just buy it.  I promise it will be worth it."

"O - Lives up to the hype, and pretty much perfection. Certainly the best barleywine ever to grace my lips. 5/5."
"Every stat,perfect 5.2013 vintage.decedent,bold flavor"
""
""
""
"Really good, but really sweet.  Could only drink one even if I wanted more but would get it again."
"Barleywine is not my favorite style of beer."
"This was amazing! it tasted similar to BCBS. The best Barley wine I've ever had."
""
""
"Lives up to the hype. I consider this to be a pretty well balanced example of the style. Bourbon is present but not overpowering. I would think for someone that is looking for a ""starter"" bourbon barrel barleywine is would be a nice one to try."
""
""
""
""
""
"A very balanced and tasty Barleywine"
""
""
"This was rated a 5 at first at a beer share. Now I dropped it because the flavor is too sweet to drink an entire bottle. Amazing beer though however."
""
""
""
""
"O: Absolutely amazing. Usually I prefer this beer with a year or two on it but the freshness of the base beer coupled with the hands-down best bourbon barrel technique has this beer in a class of its own. Sucuba, sit back down."
""
"The chocolate and barrel flavor combine for a bit of a port wine vibe. Exceptional beer. A sipper for sure! Enjoyed it on tap."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a growler, hop head trying to expand my horizons.  Was overpowering the first glass, second glass was much more smooth."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I was very lucky to taste a growler a week ago.  I know this had a great smooth feel, great smell and very unique (first time) taste to me but this style is too sweet for me."

"2014 release. Appearance- dark and deep ruby color, no head retention, has don't legs to it. Smell- beautiful and blended smells of vanilla, oak, bourbon, toffee, more dark fruits as it warms, and caramel, reminds me of its stout brother. Taste- wow, just wow. For a bottle with no age on it, it blends so well with some alcohol presence. Starts with a smooth vanilla and caramel which gives way to plenty of malt, oak, tobacco, dark fruits and bourbon, finishes with a nice hop presence temporarily which gives way to a creamy and boozy finish. Mouthfeel- holy crap, this is one of the best if not the best mouthfeels I've ever had with a beer. So syrupy and creamy, very dangerous, I really think I could session this with ease which is surprising given what it is. Overall- an amazing experience. I'm really surprised, I like this way better than bcbs, and I'm more of a stout guy. This lives up to the billing."

"Rich, malty, dark, dried fruity flavor with traces of vanilla, bourbon, and oak. Consistency was delightful."
""
""

""

""
""
""
""
"I love bourbon but once again I just don't enjoy a BCBS product."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I'm glad I had a chance to try this. In many ways it was like other bourbon barrel aged beers. But what sets it apart were the nuances (for example, the hint of caramelized dried dark fruits) and the full, deep body."
"T: Has a mellow character bordering on blasé. Moments of molasses. Some dark bready malts. Dried plums, grapes. Some oxidated metallic, Definition of balance. Would pair very well with cheese. A very mature beer."
""
""
""
"While 2013 has a bit more ""port"" warmth, thinner body, earthy grain taste, and more bourbon compared to 2014 which had more plum/port fruit and fig sweetness to it. I'd be curious to see if it translated in to a side by side bottle comparison."
""
""
""
""
""
"I like this, it is pretty good."
""
""
""
""
"Excellent! Great mouth feel and taste. Slightly sweeter than Bourbon County Brand Stout."
"Overall, my favorite barleywine to date."
""
"Excellente! King Henry and BCBW are the same, both super premium to enjoy, highly recommended all the time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Tasted a '14 that wasn't as boozy and ""hot"" as I was expecting. A lot of dark fruit, dark sugar sweetness. Zero head and lacing with an oily mouthfeel. It was very good but drinks more like liquor than a beer."
""
""
"Overall, this barleywine is fantastic. This beer has the right notes in the right places in the right degrees."
""
""
""
"Excuse me! Why are they still selling this as if it wasn't the best of the whole collection! I was able to get one of all the bourbon county release and this by far has the most flavor of the collection!! By the way I don't noally like barley wines!  Thank your bourbon county! My wait n line was well worth it!!"
""
""
""
"Draft 1/12/15 @ Harry's Hofbrau RWC.  Pours dark brown with limited caramel colored head.  Some lacing present.  Aroma of bourbon, raisins, figs, and a bit of vanilla.  Good mouthfeel, although a little thinner than the other BC offerings.  Taste is dark fruits, bourbon, oak, vanilla, and possibly a hint of chocolate.  Solid bourbon barrel aged barleywine."
""
"2014 release.... I think this will be even better once it has a little age on it"
""
"Overall, I was very fortunate to be able to track this down in East Tennessee after years of wanting to try it. This beer does not disappoint as there is just so much going on. Truly world-class."
"It pours a beautiful dark brown, nearly black, with a one finger head of caramel colored foam that slowly breaks away. The aroma is strong, boozy with vanilla and oak notes. Taste is unexpectedly as smooth as it is complex. It's boozy and very sweet. The bourbon barrels really come through again with those same oak and vanilla notes. There is also an element of dark dried fruit (raisins/figs). As it warms, the bourbon aspect becomes even more prominent. The feel is absolutely perfect, it's creamy and full-bodied, and it sticks to your mouth. Carbonation is perfect. Honestly, this whole experience borders on perfect. It's hard to imagine improving this beer, I just wish I could get more of it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, it's an excellent beer and I definitely enjoyed it.  I'm looking forward to seeing how it ages."
""
"Solid barrel-aged barelywine."
""
"Great vanilla notes but far too sweet and cloying for my taste. Not bad, but not balanced in the ways I wish it were."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A bold and complex beer. Flavors of Carmel, Toffee, Vanilla, Leather, and an alcohol burn. Takes on the consistency and flavor of a fine bourbon as it warms. Definitely recommend sharing a bottle as this beer is heavy.  Look forward to aging a couple over the next five years as it develops."
"Gross!!!!  How do people find this palatable?"

"Deep, dark brown color.  Despite the solid hiss when prying off the cap, it pours with an almost still look, only a slim tan head forming before quickly dissolving to a fine collar.  Smells highly oaky right out of the gate before giving way to brown bread, molasses, dates, nuts, and raisins.  The wood mellows out a bit as it warms, developing more sticky breadiness, cherry, and slight oxidation. Flavor is less wooden, which is a definite improvement.  Rich, malty flavors like figs, dates, toffee, raisin bread, tobacco, and chocolate coated in coconut and vanilla Bourbon notes.  Sweet, but complex and layered.  Amazingly silky, oily feel that is chewy, if not super thick (which is fine by me).  Not a huge fan of the aggressive barrel in the nose, but the flavor and mouthfeel are excellent.  Accomplishes being rich and decadent without being cloying or hot.  Excellent!"
""
"Overall- An incredible treat, so sweet and delicatable. Creamy vanilla notes play wonderfully off the rich malts and fruits. Barrel characteristics shine and mix in a nice dryness. Drinks incredibly smooth, but very sweet. Mellow yet intense like a fine port, but very sweet."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I can see why this beer is world class. amazing barely wine"
"O: A very good barleywine. It was a little too sweet for me; although the sugary taste did calm over time as it warmed. I'd drink this again however next time I would drink it substantially warmer."
"Amazing if you like Barleywine's this is a must"
"Mouthfeel is smooth and mild. Overall, very good."
""
"Overall, this is an amazing beer, and should be experienced by all those interested"
"O: Good barleywine, although I was a little bit underwhelmed on the hype. Through the duration of drinking this I could not shake the strong sugar cane sweetness that was a bit overpowering. Personally I think the Uinta Anniversary barleywine is a more balanced example of the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O – An incredibly well-constructed, complex beer. However, I would like to revisit after additional aging.  There is a bit of a bite that I didn’t get in the ’13 vintage that should smooth out over time.  Still, quite fantastic as is."
""
""
"O:  Great beer.  Liked it slightly more than BCBS"
""
""
""
"2014 version. Pours a dark cola with a light, tan ring of a head.  Aroma of big bourbon booze, vanilla, damp wood, and a touch of coconut.  Taste is much like other BC ales that smack you around with the intense sweetness unlike many others.  Syrupy with dark fruits, toffee, caramels, and more oaky-vanilla notes.  Feel is creamy, somewhat boozy, and silky smooth.  Obviously, a very solid BA barleywine.  Right there with Sucaba, but a step or 2 below Straight Jacket for me."
""
""
""
""
"One of the best beers you will ever have."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: My favorite BCBS variant so far. And one of the best beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Got lucky and stumbled upon this one.  Definitely glad I  grabbed one and had to see what all the hype was about. Deep color and strong smooth taste. Smells great with an even better after taste."
""
"This is a truly delicious beer. Maybe it's unfair to compare, as they are completely different beers, but it's not quite on the level of BCBS for me. This drinks like a port wine and makes an excellent digestif."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Definitely the best Barleywine available imho."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"One of the best barleywines I have consumed. I was very impressed with how well the alcohol was masked. This brew was not over-sweetened which really brought out the best flavors in the malts. A must have year after year."
""
""
""
"O: This is a fantastic beer. From my experience, this is the most complex Bourbon County beer I have had (compared to BCBS and BCBCS), and borderline my favorite, though I'm a sucker for stouts. In my mind this had always been the younger brother of the two yearly bigs BCBS and BCBCS, but this has earned a big deal of respect from me. Utterly fantastic."

"I also made sure I wasn't eating anything during the tasting, wanted my palate clean. This was one of those ales where you just want it to never leave your mouth. It's that delectable. For my first Bourbon County beer, this one greatly exceeded my expectations."
""
"Overall: A really great Barleywine that lives up to the hype. Great complex mix of bourbon, malt, and dark fruit flavors. It’s a big sipper but still manages to be smooth considering its size."

"O: Truly a great example of a Bourbon Barrel Aged Barleywine, a style that sometimes is just too sweet for my palate to enjoy but this is one I would gladly drink over and over again. Wonderful complexity and balance to the flavors."

"O  Bizarre palate. Bourbon came through at first, followed by malts– an experience comparable to the first sip of a mixed drink. Then tobacco came through, out of nowhere! Prunes and a woody aroma followed. Not something I'd drink frequently, but certainly enjoyable and bewildering. Also, much preferred over Goose Island's 2014 Bourbon County Coffee Stout."

"Truly a complex beverage, there's so much to enjoy at every point, and nothing is too overpowering. ABV is well hidden and the mouthfeel is just right. It's thick, but has enough carbonation to prevent it from being cloying."

"This is a really nice beer, it is a touch on the boozy side, but full of flavor, and hides the ABV well. It is a bit easier to drink than regular BCS, and a worthy member of the Bourbon County family."

"Sticky toffee, vanilla, bourbon, and stone fruit. Aroma mimics taste almost to a T, and I would consider the mouthfeel to be perfect. Very very very good, but not my favorite. This is the 2014 version however and I have a few 2013 to review, I just wanted to try it fresh first. According to style, this is damn near perfect though, I highly recommend."

"All Bourbon County beers all a tour de force of flavor yielding into the sublime."
""
""
""
"O:  An enjoyable beer, overall.  I'd like it if it weren't quite so sweet and if it were a bit smoother, but it's not so cloying and boozy as the BCBS line."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A+ beer. One of the best beers ive had in 2014."
"My 1000th review! Words cannot describe this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O:  A real treat.  It's hard to understand why this variant always seems to be the red headed stepchild of the BC lineup. Perhaps it's because the stouts are so damn good as well.  All I know is that King Henry is quickly rising up my list of must-try beers.  If it's markedly better than this, then I'm bound to love it."

"All politics of business aside, this is an outstanding brew.  Too bad I will never pay for it."
"overall-a near perfect beer. extremely delicious, drinks dangerously smooth yet is very warming and satisfying."
""
"Enjoyed a 2013 release today (14 months old) with my brothers. Pours a dark ruby translucent color. Thin film of head. Smells of boozy bourbon with notes of dark fruits and malts. Flavor is not near as boozy as the smell. Lots of great dark fruit notes with a mild alcohol burn. Very conolex flavors. Definitely a sipper. Although this is not my favorite style, I did enjoy this beer. Definitely some unique, rich flavors. Worth the price to pick one up if you can get it. I imagine drinking a fresh one would be entirely too boozy for my palate."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I just had a 2013 bottle and I must say I did not care for this variant at all.  The bourbon flavor over powers the stout and it was too much."
"epic--- bourbon, molasses, caramel, fudge, sweet but not cloying."
""
""
""
"The best Barleywine I've ever had.  Unbelievable.  Aged 1 year.  Sorry but I'm not gonna say more than that.  Stop analyzing, just savor it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Had this at FoBAB randalled in coffee. It was amazing."
""
"TOTAL - 45/50"
"Bottle: Poured a deep murky brown color ale with a medium size foamy head with medium retention and limited lacing. Aroma of toffee, heavy caramelized malt notes and some vanilla and bourbon notes. Taste is also dominated by loads of toffee and caramelized notes with a healthy dose of residual sugar notes with some nice bourbon and vanilla notes. Body is quite full with a good amount of carbonation with light warming alcohol notes. Very well brewed with nice balanced with the barrel-aging notes. Maybe a tad too much residual sugars."

"Others speak better than I do on this, but I will add that this is like sipping on Commandaria St. John."

"OVERALL: This was really good. Surprisingly enough, I enjoyed this one just as much as King Henry, and I wasn’t sure that would be the case. To be sure, people have said that KH has fallen off a cliff, but the bottle we opened was still in excellent shape and we enjoyed it immensely. Compared to the King, this one has more oak and toffee in the flavor, while it is also smoother and creamier in the feel. KH in a bit sharper in the barrel and alcohol flavors at this point and there is a hint of bitter pure chocolate that lends some nice balance. In any case, this is a quality barleywine and I wish Goose Island could somehow produce their stout with the same creamy feel that they’ve pulled off here. Good stuff, and would gladly drink more. Cheers Doops!"
"Overall, this is an intense, rich, complex, and extremely flavorful beer. It's very, very sweet with a nice boozy kick. This is a pretty good beer to sip and enjoy. Take your time with this one. I'm glad I bought a 4 pack of this when I saw it."
""
""
"It took me a while to chew through this, but I savored every bite."
""
""
""

"The beer is a masterpiece of blending diverse aromas and taste. In contrast to other beers in the style, it stands out as an exceptional brew. Perhaps I will find another bottle to cellar."

"O - Delicious and super complex.  Not the prettiest looking beer, but damn good."
""
""
""
"Pours out murky and brown with no head.  Bourbon, wood, and vanilla are the strongest aromas.  Not getting a whole lot of the base beer.  The bourbon barrel works better in the flavor than with the imperial stout.  I'm getting a lot of vanilla and wood.  Brown sugar from the barleywine base.  Hints of roasty malts from the stout that was in the barrels before this?  Mouthfeel is sticky, thick, and soft.  Tasty bourbon barrel aged barleywine."

" Overall: Another great barrel aged brew from goose island. Loving the huge vanilla, bourbon, and dark fruit notes. They are all separate but make for big beer that has no business being this ridiculously tasty. A perfect desert sipper to celebrate a special occasion. Another world class barrel aged beer from Goose Island."

"Bottle, 2013 release. Thanks, Chris. A syrupy dark brown with a dense, foamy head with excellent retention and minimal lacing, this beer has nice legs. The nose is big, boozy, sweet and decadent. Leather, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, molasses, jaggery - all kinds of sweetness - is present. Bourbon character is shockingly mellow given this beers siblings. Vanilla and rum; a little bit of oak and char are present. Moderately fruity with plums and raisins present. Yum. The palate opens with a big sweetness and a moderate heat. In the vein of an English BW, Thankfully, not as prune-heavy as King Henry was. Caramel, toffee, brown sugar, a little bit of burnt sugar, a little earth and leather are noticeable, along with a blend of raisins and dates deglazed with rum. Vanilla, a little oak, some rum and bourbon character are present. A dusting of cocoa is present, particularly in the way the roasted malt flavors play off the fruity and sweet flavors. Full in body with a soft carbonation, this beer has a long, sweet finish with caramel and toffee dominating. Excellent stuff"

"Bourbon County Brand Barleywine Ale is an intense, bourbon-forward beer that would make for a perfect after dinner sipper on a cold winter night. Even though the barrels used to age this beer had previously aged two beers before it, they still lent an immense amount of bourbon flavor and complexity. I looking forward to seeing how this beer evolves with time."

"This is a wonderful English Barleywine! Incredible! It's a great ""sipping"" beer to say the least.  The long finish lingered in a pleasant for hours after my 8 oz. drink was done.  It's somewhat like a softly carbonated liqueur for beer drinkers! Sweet, but not sticky. An amazingly rich, great example of an English-style Barleywine!"

"12 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 9/17/2013. Pours hazy/cloudy very dark brown color with a small tan head with poor retention, that reduces to a ring of lacing. Slight spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a light amount of streaming carbonation retaining a bit of a cap. Aromas of big raisin, prune, fig, caramel, toffee, toast, brown sugar, molasses, vanilla, coconut, oak, bourbon, light tobacco, and toast/oak earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark malt, fruitiness, and bourbon barrel notes; with good strength. Taste of big raisin, prune, fig, chocolate, caramel, molasses, toast, brown sugar, toffee, vanilla, oak, bourbon, coconut, light tobacco, and toast/oak earthiness. Light earthy oak bitterness/spice on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, prune, fig, chocolate, caramel, molasses, toast, brown sugar, toffee, vanilla, oak, bourbon, coconut, light tobacco, and toast/oak earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity and big robustness of dark malt, fruitiness, and bourbon barrel flavors; with a fantastic malt/barrel balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light carbonation and very full bodied; with a very creamy, slick, and fairly syrupy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an outstanding barrel aged barleywine. All around awesome complexity, robustness, and balance of dark malt, fruitiness, and bourbon barrel flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."

"This one is beyond good. An easy drinking brew with a sweet dark fruit taste. Very limited carbonation.  I could drink this and still wonder if it contained alcohol even though it was laid to rest in a bourbon barrel. If you like barleywines this is it!"

"Pours rich mahogany with a minimal cream colored head that dissipates quickly. Thick and unfiltered look. Sep 24 2013 bottling date. Nose is malt, caramel, whiskey and cigar with background notes of brown sugary sweetness. Taste follows the nose..slow and sweet with just a little heat. Flavor is buttery and rich. Mouthfeel thick and gratifying. Overall, an outstanding barleywine with a lot to offer for the style."

"Overall: The was the opener for the afternoon and I have to say I like it the best! All three (this one, the cherry rye, and the coffee) of the goose island specialties were spectacular, but for me, this one took the cake. I would be interested to see how this beer develops, however it would be a tough task considering it was so epic at this stage. One of my favorite beers I have had the pleasure to try this year."

"Another outstanding brew from Goose Island. What it lacks in appearance it makes up for in taste, twofold. Barleywines, nowadays, seem to lack that barley presence in favor of the coffee/chocolate tastes. This is not one of those. The head lacing are virtually nonexistent. So what? If you have no fear of the dark you will feel right at home here."

"Poured aggressively into a tulip. Looked like I was pouring a Pepsi. Lots of fizz that disappeared quick into nothing. Definitely smell the bourbon barrel asking with vanilla and dark fruit. Taste is so damn smooth. Dark chocolate, cherries, vanilla and a boozy aftertaste. Not overpowering though. After the pour, thought the carb would be too much, but not the case. Very smooth and tantalizes the palate. Delicious!"

"Poured into a wine glass. This is just amazing... pour is pitch brown, low carbonation. Once swirled, a short lived head forms to release the aroma. The booze is well hidden in both the aroma and taste. I smell dark fruit, strong sweet licorice, vanilla. Taste is licorice, oak, with a lasting raisin on the mouth. Mouthful is full, slightly sticky. Overall this beer is perfect! Bought 3 4-packs and am cellaring 2 packs, can't wait. I also plan on doing a side by side with other barleywines."

"Pours black/gold with a slight head. Aroma is amazing, rich, sweet and dark. Taste is dense with lush caramel, dates, etc. Simply a fine example of an English barleywine. The taste and the name fit perfectly as this tastes exactly what a barleywined BCS would taste like. Wish I had a Barleywine machine to put a few beers through."

"Everything about this beer is perfect. Intense vanilla aromas and taste; I really don't see the point in aging this beer, it is great how it is. Very smooth; the bourbon barrel contributes significantly to the vanilla notes. Some slightly floral hops on the nose make this thing even more complex. Definitely seek out, and drink fresh, IMO"

"O. Had this alongside a King Henry and it held its own, though KH is starting to show its sherry-like oxidation notes, so it may not be an entirely fair comparison.The barrel on KH is certainly more ""alive"". It has more character and is surprisingly boozy after 2.5 years. BCBW is a bit better rounded, though. I guess that's a roundabout way of saying that BCBW is every ounce the beer that KH is. GI has become shockingly good at this game, and I hope they continue to play in this sandbox. BCBW isn't just one of the best releases of 2013, it's one of the best English BW's ever made. If you missed out on this in 2013, make sure you don't sleep on it this fall. Standing ovation."

"10/1/14-had it on tap in NYC last night and it was very tasty, complex and quite enjoyable again. Looks were much nicer on tap with a head that actually stuck around for a while, leading to strong boozy complex nose and rich, sweet flavors that were so complicated that each sip was slightly different. The heat was ever present again, making for a real nice slow sipper."

"Overall I thought this was a great beer and I thought it was a great example of the style, it had everything that I look for in the style plus a little more and it didn't leave me disappointed in the slightest. This beer had good drinkability, it was fairly smooth, rich, a little sticky, almost slightly cloying, a little filling and the taste did a great job at holding my attention, I could drink a bottle by myself with no problem and it tastes so good that I would be pretty tempted to drink a couple of these in a row and If I had a lot I might do that. I think it makes for a great fall and winter time beer, it feels like it would keep me warm in the cold weather. What I like the most about this beer was how good the taste and aroma were and the great mouthfeel helped take this beer to a whole new level. What I like the least about this beer was appearance, it wasn't bad and I liked the color, but the head, lacing and retention were disappointing. I would for sure buy this beer again if I ever saw it and I hope it shows up at some of my local beer stores next year. I would recommend this beer to just about anyone, it's just one of those beers that you just have to try. All in all I was very happy with this beer and I was also a little impressed, I was already expecting this beer to be great and it ended up exceeding my expectations. I am really happy I decided to seek this beer out, this Bourbon County series has all been great. This is now my favorite Bourbon Barrel Barleywine, it's that damn good and it's up there as one of the better goose Island beers I've had, I still think I liked the regular and the coffee version slightly more, but that doesn't take away how great of beer this is and as it stands it's pretty much my ideal Bourbon Barrel Barleywine. Goose Island is really bringing the heat when it comes to these limited releases. Awesome job guys, this was one great beer, keep up the great work."

"Tons of credit to this beer for its super smooth flavor and lack of alcohol for 12%. One thing that I find a bit off-putting is the coca-cola/soy sauce hints that come and go. Great fresh whiskey and oak vanilla sweetness atop thick caramel and raisin."
""
""
"This pours a dark almost reddish brown, with a head that recedes quickly. The nose is greeted with aromas of spice, butterscotch, vanilla, brown sugar, subtle chocolate, & hints of soy sauce. The taste is sweet with rich raisins and dark fruit. The palate is a bit sticky, medium bodied, and moderately smooth. The finish is warmed by the high ABV, slightly dry, and pleasantly bitter."
""
""
""
""
""
"Fantastic, one of the best barleywine I've had. IMO, Alesmith BA Old Numbskull night edge this out, but this is so wonderful to sip"

"I feel like I'm trashing this beer by not giving it lights-out ratings. But it's not a lights-out beer. Not like Sucaba, or Arctic Devil, or King Henry, or MoAS. Biggest flaw is the imperfect integration of the base and the barrel. It's good, not great."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"The nose is fantastic. Huge vanilla notes, along with bourbon, slightly burnt caramel, brown sugar and smoke. Tastes outrageously good, with the heavy malts beautifully balanced by the bourbon finish. This is outstanding."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D - It's not up to snuff with the other 2013 variants, but it's worthy of your time. The palate isn't hitting quite as heavily as I'd anticipated. I'd be lying if I said I didn't find this a bit boring compared to a staple like Sucaba."
""
""
""

"Bottle thanks to Tommy. Pours a dark muddy brown with low head, not particularly impressive. Very different from your standard barleywine. There is some old caramel-toffee (aroma) and candy (taste) that is commonly associated to barleywines but it ends there. The barrel presence is very strong with bourbon and vanilla, then mollasses and anise from the regular BCS. The final result reminds me of american strong ales or old ales with tobacco, figs and graham cracker. Obviously very sweet along but also bitter. Rich and low carbonation. A decadent american strong ale. 4.1-4.2"

"Really good mouthfeel, probably the best part. Certainly full bodied with a strong lingering flavor that lasts. The alcohol has a nice warming effect but it's not too boozy and has a nice carbonation level. Silky smooth with a nice warming and slightly bitter finish. Nice drinkability and a slow sipper. Great beer, thanks BBG for sharing. You're the man and you'll always be the BBG on some level to me."

"Sadly I only got one of these bottles because this beer is underrated even though it's in the top 25. I will definitely need to get a few more bottles and try to age them, but I might not be able to keep my hands off of them. My only knock on this beer is it's ever so slightly under carbonated."

Taste is that of barleywine, coconut smoothness and bourbon. Quite an incredible combination and hopefully will be present next year as variant."
"bottled on 9.24.13"

"I do wish I'd have been able to taste the base beer in this one. Without that, I'm tasting tons of bourbon barrel effect over some kind of barley-wine that's not showing itself. What it is, though, is very tasty. It's the perfect beer for right now, my last of the night. Good way to go out."

""
""
""

"O- While the aroma is way too heavy on the raisin (maybe some more age would mellow that out?), the rest of the beer checks out just fine. A complex, aggressive yet very drinkable barleywine that belongs in the top rankings."
""
""
"At the end of my glass, I felt like a relived my first moment with Bourbon County Stout. A thick, succulent big beer that I fear cannot get much better than it stands. At this stage, only Old Ruffian and J.W. Lee's Harvest Ale can compete with this monster of a barleywine. As a bonus, this becomes my favorite new beer of 2014. Amazing!"
""

""

"O: A great beer but perhaps not as balanced and complex as some of the competitors."
""
""
"O - again, I can see why BW lovers wouldn't like this as much as they should. I get it. At the end of the day though take it for what it is: A shining example of a BA barleywine that maybe found too much influence from the beer that was previously housed in the same barrels."

"It's too bad that I don't have more of these - I'd love to see how this would develop over time and witness how the barrel character would probably shine through. The fruits are just at the right sweet spot at this point, although I'd imagine as they fade and taste drier that they will compliment the earthier barrel flavors even better as it ages. Nevertheless, in terms of something that I could have more often (of the recent GI releases), this is by far my favorite. Whether it will evolve over time as well as regular BCBS is up to others to decide, but it melds together what I love so much about English barleywines and bourbon aged beers and melds it intriguingly balanced and wonderful results. Don't pass this by just because it isn't regular BCBS - this is a genuinely beautiful beer."

I find it hard to believe that there will be better BW's made in the future that will rival them. If anything comes a long, it will probably only equal it as you can't beat it."

"The feel of this beer is big as expected and feels like it needs to be handled with two hands. This beer is meant to sipped and not rushed through. There is some nice smooth feel to this beer but still heavy and is best enjoyed being sipped and savored. Character is the best name for this beer. It will stay with you for some time and you'll be enjoying it even after the beer is gone."

"This is the second time I've sampled this beer, and I can now confirm that the rest of these bottles are going deep in my cellar, for at least two years. It tastes too sweet, too young for a barleywine. But it tastes like potential. While I doubt it will somehow evolve into something akin to King Henry II, I think my scores will go up when I update this review in approximately 2018."

"O: Quite good, probably not the very best. It's been a while since I had King Henry...think I still have 4-5 sitting around the cellar...probably time to open one up to compare."
"Overall - Kinda undeniably tasty, the barrels previously containing Bourbon County Stout definitely made a difference/make this unique. Sweetness+booze is a little tolling, 6 oz. was a good serving size."

"O: Overall words can merely describe the beautiful ,rich . sweet chocolate burbon beast that this is. Dangerously smooth, 12%abv?, hardly any indications that this is above 7-8% at any moment. So dangerously easy to drink, at $20 a liter this is worthy its weight in gold. Sharply fined toned, extremely polished in flavor with a beautiful flow of rich, dark sweet flavors that just pleasure the tongue into a state of ecstacy. The craftmenship of the brewing here is world class, from start to finish, an awe-insprining drink that the world needs more of."

"Overall very nice, delicious with great malts, great dark fruits, nice warming booze that fits well, great bourbon and barrel, great overall beer, but not quite as orgasmic as most people make it out to be. I really think it will age quite well though and I can't wait to try it in a couple years."

"An outstanding beer, and one I like a little better every time I have it. Pours a bit murky, but clears up as it sits- very little head. Very nice aromas- extremely well integrated aromas of bourbon with brown sugar, vanilla, and slight woody notes combined with a subtle nuttiness and a rounded maltiness. Very nice. The taste is even better with supremely integrated flavors of whiskey and sweet malt, brown sugar and some light bitterness. great depth, and a long finish. Very nice indeed! I'll also say that this seems to improve a bit after at least a couple of months in the bottle."

"Pours a murky deep deep amber capped by a two finger fluffy beige head. Excellent retention, splotchy lacing here and there. Boozy aroma of vanilla, light oak, and rich toffee. Opens with dates, dried black cherries and hints of prune joined by caramel, toffee, vanilla. Finishes with oak, light wisps of bourbon, and general booziness. Slick mouthfeel with some creaminess on the edges. Lighter side of fully bodied. Moderate carbonation, more than expected for a barrel-aged brew. An excellent BA English barleywine, but frankly lacks some depth of flavor displayed by other BA English barleywines that I've rated more highly."

"An amazing beer. Malty, caramel, toffee tastes. Amazing aromas of fruits, sweetness. Just the right amount of bourbon flavors and smells. So easy drinking for a big beer. Complex and balanced, this smells like . . . like happiness. I was blown away by the first sip. And I was wanting more at the last. This is the epitome of what drinkers of so-so beer are missing. There's nothing I don't like about this beer or that I can think of that would make it better. This is the kind of thing that makes craft beer my passion."

"2013. Served at a little cooler than room temp. Pours a very dark, purplish, ruby-brown color with a small, tan head. Scent is boozy, with sweet bourbon, vanilla, and oak. A whole lot of molasses too with black cherries and other dark fruits. Smells very sweet and delicious. Taste is immediately cherry-forward...almost like chocolate covered cherries. Very sweet and boozy. Tons of bourbon heat to it, but sweet vanilla and cherry balance. A chocolatey backbone with a hint of oak molasses. Pretty complex. Mouthfeel is nicely carbonated for this style...not too much...not too little. Drinkability is fairly high, although the heat could use some time to settle. Overall, world-class English-style Barleywine. IMO, drink this beer at room-temp. I had it straight out of the fridge about 2 months ago, and I got SO MUCH more aroma and flavor this time around."
""
""
"O: A great beer in its own right. The base beer is a delicious example of a barley wine (english style im guessing) but I would have liked to get more of the barrel flavor out of it. Glad I got to try it, but I wouldn't raise hell to get another."
"Overall: Another fantastic BA brew. Worthy of the Bourbon County name."

"Pour is dark mahogany with red edges and a tight camel head. Nose is meaty and big, barrel is lighter than I expected with some cherry sweetness and a fair bit of grain depth. Taste is very similar, a bit more wood and barrel, some malt presence up front and the cherry sweetness in back. A fair bit of heat but not in a bad way and a full body with strong carbonation and a silky but slightly slick feel."

"Hmm, this is a review of the 2014.  It is a bit weak in it's maltiness.  A nice bourbon barrel character but doesn't really have the beer to back it up.  Wow, really a disappointment after last years."
"O - the smell on this is definitely amazing, all of the flavors you would expect but balanced all so well. You get a lot of the sweetness that comes with a fresh bourbon county stout. you get a lot of black cherry, and plum flavors. I am not a big barley wine fan but I have to say that I really really enjoyed this. Phone fully the sweetness will fall off with some age, I can only imagine it will get even better"

"As awesome as it was to find this beer and as girly as it sounds, I am happy to have split one 3 ways. It was far to rich to have had an entire 12oz myself. Not to mention the buzz and the mouth taste the next morning. A worthy adversary, but I'm still not certain who won that battle."
""
""
""

"If available, you must try this."
"O - an amazing beer. Tastes that rival most barrel aged stouts. A bit of a ""one note"" (but what an amazing note it is) beer when compared to some barrel aged stouts. The first barrel aged barley wine (and one of the only regular barley wines) have had so I can't compare it to others of the style. A truly great and enjoyable beer to drink that is only slightly hampered by the heat from the alcohol/barrel"
"worthy of all the high praise, this is a social barleywine with a great bourbon complexion and so much body it drinks like syrup. the looks are the only part that didn't really turn me on, dark mahogany in color with almost no head, and even a vigorous twirl of the glass can't arouse one. thick and dense and viscous. the nose is very sweet, tons of layers of grain and sugar, but also a great deep char and vanilla aspect from the barrel, not unnecessarily complex, but dynamic to say the least. i feared a sugar bomb that would be close to undrinkable, and almost immediately wished i had shared the bottle, but after the first sip it eased up a bit, temperature helped it unfold, and by the bottom of the glass i was wishing for more. a toffee style sweetness starts off a long flavor journey that bounces from toasted marshmallow to vanilla extract to charcoal and rum raisin cake. some spice to this, classic english ale yeast, a bunch of residual sugar, and not much hops at all. the finish is long and smooth, and while the alcohol is there, it adds a layer rather than distracts. more body than i thought possible, almost gelatinous, slippery and slick, but chewy too. mild carbonation is all it needs. i like this at least as much as the stout, if not more. its a world class beer that showcases the barrel very neatly. id like to have one with some age on it just to compare."

"Vigorous pour into a large snifter yielded third of an inch of medium tan head. The head faded within 30 seconds to a thin collar. Some remnants of tan head at the surface of the beer. Lacing is pretty decent, but not great. Aroma is deep caramel, toffee, some earthy chocolate-like aromas too. Taste is toffee forward, some really woody-earthy tones. Some bitter chocolate is enjoyable. I get quite a bit of the stout-like character in this brew. Less boozey than I remember from the first time I had it. Full, thick body and medium carbonation."

"Overall: I've raved enough. This is a masterpiece beer, as well thought out as it is executed. If you like English barleywines or barrel aged beer, get your hands on some of this. The stout-ish twist is great, but it's only a 1 element in a beer with uncountably many virtues."
""
"Deep brown, sort of a caramel colour, with a thin cap that settled quickly to a modest collar and wisps of fine bubbles on the surface of the beer. Sweet, malty aroma, notes of caramel and toffee, balanced by barrel character - woody and slightly boozy, not quite cheesy. Pretty nice overall. Sweetness, wood, and booze fight it out in the flavour too, but now there's a solid bitterness that plays counterpoint throughout. Sugary sweetness, bitterness mid-palate, alcohol warmth, woody astringency, toffee. Low carbonation, full (fairly heavy) body. There's a lot of character here from the barrel aging -- booze and tannins mostly -- balanced nicely by a solid barleywine. Definitely worth trying - more than once."
"Bourbon County Brand Barleywine pours a dark brownish color with a swirling small head. There is a strong oaky and earthy aroma, with a sharp malt bite. The taste is similar, good sharp malt backbone, with bold oaky flavors. Very drinkable, and bold great flavors, and very drinkable. Overall WOW"

"Poured on tap into a snifter. Pours reddish black with little head, but not that surprising. Smells of raisins and a little of red wine, pretty much perfect. Beer tastes of raisins and almost a licorice, very nice balance. Beer is full bodied but has very little harshness, goes down really nice. This beer lives up to its billing, a superb beer."

"o: I love this beer and I'm both happy and relieved that I got some. So this barleywine has some pronounced stout characteristics which makes me wonder to what extent this is thanks to the BCBS previously in these barrels and how much is thanks to the base barleywine's recipie. It would be inteteresting to know how ""stouty"" this was before the barrel. How significant could BCBS's flavor contribution be after a relatively short time in the barrel? No matter, the beer is stellar."

"Pours a turbid dark brown, zero head, zero lacing, leggy but no stained glass left behind. Meh. Smell: bourbon, unripe nectarine, vinous, slightly doughy yeast wonk. Taste: booze soaked peaches in a ton of brown sugar, fleetingly nutty, caramel and toasted brown bread, then earthy with a respite from the sweet, hit with twin splashes of bourbon and vanilla, and finally drying out into a sticky peach and date filled finish. Drinking this fairly warm and the nose is really not doing much. But it's extremely tasty. It's not in stout territory as I've heard suggested. Nice fruit + sweet forward barleywine. 2013."

"On a side note, I basically reviewed this as a stout and not a barleywine. I'm not sure why they throw barleywine into the title when clearly, this is NOT a representation of a barleywine whatsoever. As a beer in general, this is out of this fucking world. As for a barleywine, why call it that? It's like trying to say a woman's anus is different from a man's. No, it's not."

"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was its taste. Everything about this guy is just so, so rich and complex, with layers upon layers upon layers, as you would expect from the BC brand. The first big noticeable difference stylistically is how damn dark it is. It’s like black barleywine status, a la the Sierra Nevada black barleywine from a few years back. While each sip begins and peaks with bright sweetness, much like the standard bourbon county stout, it is through the end and aftertaste of the sip where this beer really begins to take its own unique form. The malts sweeten up with warmth, helping to create some cracks in the darkness of themselves, allowing for the fruit and inherent bitterness of booze and wood to shine through. This is where the true complexity of the beer lies, once it all begins to fall into place. The aroma, while intensely rich, roasty, and robust, and hinting at the darkness of the beer, doesn’t quite come to that same level of glory as the flavoring. Again, this is just a treat all around, and although it isn’t quite as sticky, dank, and “forever” as King Henry, we are extremely happy to have been able to track down and consume this beer, especially since we thought it was gone forever."

"Very barrel forward with strong presence of bourbon. Still has reasonable balance with malt aspect of the barleywine base. Detectable hops presence offer contrast to other flavours. Not sure if truly lives up to hype, but still enjoyable offering. I imagine some age in the bottle version would improve the overall experience."

"An aggressive pour into my Darkness tulip. This ruby, fig, purple, brown Barleywine has a brown sugar foam head that fades quickly and slides away into the abyss. Not a hint of carbonation which is how I like my BBA English BW's. Insane, sticky and drippy legs as it swirls around the glass. Dried figs, raisins, vanilla beans, bourbon, caramel covered cherries, mulled winter spices and honey. Picking up lovely stout notes and hints of banana. Deep, dark, naughty fruit! Uplifting vanilla and honey sweetness. Sweet bourbon, charred malt, and a hint of tangerine/nectarine citrus. Tastes of cherries, figs, and vanilla beans dredged in caramel covered semi-sweet chocolate. Subtle notes of tangy citrus peel, oak, cocoa, coffee and even more dried fruit. The bourbon pokes in and out between each sip and the finish. Sticky honey sweet! It runs down, and coats your throat with each sip. So thick and delicious!!! GI has definately perfected the English Barleywine!!! It's may not be KH, but it's one hell of an attempt!!! Damn near perfection!!!"
""
""
""
"Overall - Solid brew, but honestly, it left me wanting regular BCBS or one of the stout variants. One of my least favorite variants, yet still good enough to warrant a solid 4/5."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer pours a deep dark brown with an inch of foamy tan head that sticks around through drinking in the form of a thin halo settling neatly around the perimeter. I'm impressed by the depth of color, head retention, and near-oily lacing. The nose is a prominent boozy brown sugar/caramel vanilla bourbon woodiness. The taste brings the same notes/flavors full force, moving towards a nice balance between sugary sweetness and booze as it warms. I notice a bit of pruney dark fruit and chocolate in the taste compared to the nose. The mouthfeel is big, full bodied as expected with a great sweetness tamed only by the biting booze and the slightly tannic bitterness. I'd say this beer is worth a try, which is profound considering how I generally feel about the style and the steep $/oz ratio. However, I'll probably pass on it in the future."

"O - The beer is a solid offering but nowhere near a home run. The third use barrels don't quite give it the hotness or booziness fans of big bourbon barrel barley wines will be used to. While this isn't' by any means a deal breaker, it does introduce an interesting flavor profile that is satisfying."
""
"D: This was simply delicious. The scent and taste were complex but well integrated. The body was fantastic, and the alcohol was hidden amazingly well. It had a crazy smooth finish too, so it was easy to drink even though it must be sipped. Would age forever, but doesn't need it. Meets the hype, as a top notch brew."

"O - 4.5 - Sometimes a barleywine starts off fine but then hangs a turn in my mouth and goes somewhere I don't want, either flat and dead, or too sherry, or bitter in an unpleasant way. This one doesn't. It stays on track. There's some activity, and it gets right to the edge of where it would veer off, but it keeps on track. That's very nice and welcome, and tantalizing at the same time. It's hard to even really compare this with other barleywines because it seems like such a different animal. I like it much better."
""

""

"The beer pours a dark, ruby-brown with a fluffy off-white/nearly tan head of large, soda-like bubbles. The head is surprisingly large, but quickly fizzles away to a nice fat scrim that is continuously fed by carbonation from the bottom of the glass. In the glass, the beer looks pretty much like a stout or imperial porter, the light reddish hue is the only thing that really sets it apart. In body the beer is a very deep, clear ruby that is a few touches away from being opaque. On the nose, the beer is rich and decadent. Spicy bourbon, rich oak tannin, vanilla, coconut, and then thick fudge, molasses bread, plum pudding, and toffee play across the nose. The barrel is strong, but not the overriding character in the nose, which I quite like. With a bit of age the nose of this beer alone could really develop into something quite amazing. As is, the nose is intriguing, boozy, and rich. On the tongue, the beer tastes decadently sweet with a touch of acidity that gives a pop. The finish is rich alcohol that becomes only a touch hot and solvent-like in closing, but does dry out. Very soft bitterness from both tannins and herbal hops can be felt in the middle and finish of the sip some of the sweetness. In flavor, the beer begins as spicy wood, blooming into rich bourbon soaked molasses bread, brown sugar, fudge with bits of toffee in it, and plum pudding. Touches of dry raisins float across the palate and the bourbon flavors definitely suggest soft vanilla, as well. The finish bring rich dark fruits, a touch of banana, and fudge beside spicy alcohol and just a touch of solvent. The beer is decadent, boozy, and delicious. I wish there was a little less booze, but I think age would definitely help with that problem. In the mouth, the beer feels full, and oozingly smooth. Little to no carbonation can be sensed, and the mouth is left tingly with booze but still wet in the cheeks, though the tongue feels a bit dry. Overall, I am quite surprised by this beer. I like bourbon barrel aged barleywines, but they aren’t really my favorite thing. This one, however, is rich and full of malt character that I really enjoy. The bourbon flavors are light and perfectly complement the other flavors. With a little more age, this beer will be delicious. This beer is worthy of a try for sure."

"O - This is a phenomenal beer. A slow sipper with rich and complex flavor. Outstanding."
"Poured a dark mahogany with minimal head into a snifter. It smells of dates, raisins, vanilla, coconut, molasses and bourbon, with the taste matches the smell. It has that almost sour bite that you experience as an aftertaste with a lot of Bourbons. Wow. This is a big beer, and a true sipper"
""
"Pours a hazy deep tawny brown color with a smallish off white head that shows little retention. Sweet bourbon with a soft woodsy aroma atop the caramel brown sugar and vanilla contained within. Light plum and cherry fruits with a hint of earth and ethanol round out the nose. The flavor is brown sugar toffee and caramel maltiness upfront before the sweet bourbon and a twinge of ethanol remind you this is one serious brew. Light vanilla and hints of pitted fruits round out the flavor nicely. Medium to thick body with a light level of carbonation and a sweet sticky mouthfeel. That is a really nice barleywine right there!"

"D: Hands down one of the best Barley Wines I have had to date. Rich and incredibly complex with the Bourbon notes incorporated so nicely. Loads of toffee, vanilla, and dark berry. Stoked to have tried this. Closest I will probably ever get to King Henry."

"Overall this is an INCREDIBLE beer. I am glad I have three more to see what some age does to them (though it is going to be hard to resist). I actually prefer this to BCBS which says a lot."

"12/30/2014-  updated the ""taste"" rating, as I sampled a bottle I aged for 1 year, the bourbon character is absolutely fantastic with some aging.  The sweetness falls back just enough to let the barrel through."

"I enjoyed a few of these bottles over the holiday break at Duckworths (Ballantyne). This is a very large and rich BW that lands very heavy on the barrel side and finishes sticky-sweet. The finish was actually very similar to the Coffee varietal - just entirely too sweet in my opinion. There aren't many other bad things to say about this beer - smooth and a pretty optimal booziness, rich caramel malt, sticky caramelized brown sugar. Very good stuff, but my first reaction was that there are plenty of peers in this class, with Central Waters BBBW remaining the breadwinner in my opinion (and at half the price)."
"I love bourbon county stout so I was really excited for this beer. I poured the beer do find a dark brown beer with little head that faded quickly, the beer was slightly hazy as well. The aroma was subtle, malty, some vanilla and dark fruits. Nothing spectacular or out of the ordinary for a barrel aged beer so far. This beer tasted plain. It was syrupy and strong but really lacked complexity. Over all I would have to say this was a disappointing beer. I am not sure if I had to high of expectations or if it really is just meh, but I can say there are several much better barrel aged beers out there."

"Notes: the closest I have been to beer perfection"
"Had this again on 2/7/14, from tap at Roast House pub in Frederick, MD (after visiting Flying Dog brewery for BA Gonzo release), and I do hereby reaffirm all dat shit I said herein above. BCBBW is da bomb!"
""
""
"Overall it is very intriguing. Not nearly the bourbon barrel character of BCBS, but I think I get equal amounts of the barrel and base beer of BCBS in this one. I also noticed the alcohol in this one seems smoother at first, but lingers longer than BCBS. Barleywines aren't my favorite, but I don't see how this could be a better one. The lingering sweetness truly makes it, as it works so well."

"A positively outstanding example of a bourbon barrel aged English styled barleywine. Goose Island using previously used Bourbon County Brand Stout barrels was a fabulous idea because this barleywine really picked up on some of the rich, chocolatey and coffee notes of the stout. I dont think I've as of yet had a barleywine with such a creamy mouthfeel. Highly, highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
"12oz bottle into a snifter. Pours a maroon color with minimal head/lacing. The smell is sweet with toffee and vanilla. The taste is even sweeter with strong caramel, vanilla, prunes, and oak. The sweetness is perfectly balanced by the bourbon. The mouthfeel is excellent, much smoother and lighter than I'd expect from the style and the ABV. Overall I really enjoyed this beer and thought it was a great execution of the style."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Very good BA barleywine. A bit of a slow sipper, but not at all overbearing. Alcohol, although definitely noticeable, does not overpower. Bourbon barrel definitely enhances the beer. Without the bite of the bourbon, this might come across as too sweet and sugary. Still this is very smooth and a great after dinner/dessert beer."

"Sometimes I feel price dictates ratings...in this case it kinda does. Its a pricey hyped 12oz bottle. While it is good, there is no doubting that, I feel people may rate this higher cuse of the cost, or lack of tasting other barleywines..."

"Picked this up in a great trade with Mike and Evan! Dark mahogany pour with a beige one finger head that quickly fades but with really nice lacing. The nose is heavenly for a Barleywine lover like myself Lots of dark fruits, bourbon, and oak along with hints of figs, toffee, raisins, and sweet brown bread. The taste is just as amazing and mirrors the nose. Oak, dark fruits, vanilla, molasses, black cherries, maple, toffee, with some subtle chocolate and licorice notes. The mouthfeel is thick and syrupy and velvety smooth with a nice subtle warming finish. It's amazingly not hot or boozy for a 12% ABV beer, but I'm still going to cellar a couple of these and see what happens. Overall, this may not be quite in the same league as King Henry, but it's pretty damn close and way more available. Another classic offering from Goose Island!"
""
""

"O: outstanding on draft. Compared to the bottle, this is night and day. an A+ barleywine. If any bars advertise having this on draft, absolutely check it out."
""
""
""

""
"O: Well, if you're looking for a top-of-the-line barrel-aged english barleywine, this pretty much stands at the top along with Sucaba. Thick, heavy, viscous, and super sweet. Bourbon cuts it just enough to help the drinkability, but doesn't overpower the great maltiness. Drink this one warm."
"This beer was really good if not great. I will certainly buy it again if Goose Island makes it again. It just fell short of the high expectations they have set from their other Bourbon County offerings."

"Mildly hazy dark brown color. Thin khaki head. Big bourbon, light vanilla, dark fruit, alcohol warmth in the nose. Smooth, lighter carbonation, bigger body, lightly dry finish.

"Is this for real right now?  Poured a beautiful burgundy color, the smells of BCBS hit first, followed by dates, figs, vanilla, soft oak, brown sugar, and molasses waft through the glass.  First sip is a carnival of flavors, so many crazy things going on, yet somehow all seemingly in place and doing exactly what they should.  The initial sip introduces the slightest hint of the bourbon county stout, followed by an sweetness of dried fruits and toffee.  Continuing down the road as the beer warmed up, I found the oak and vanilla to come forward, with some fig preserves and brown sugar coming through as well.  For the price of 5 bucks for a 12 ouncer, I can say I’d buy a case of it easy.  13% is well hidden, so well in fact that I didn’t detect any alcohol.  This is certainly a sweet rich beer, and I’m excited to see what a few years of age will do."

"O- An awesome addition to the line up. A very similar taste to the regular stout from the barrels and the barley wine base is a great one to build off of."
""
"I am not a fan of barleywines, rarely like what I try (even those well regarded). I do like this quite a bit, as the characteristics I tend to hate about BW's aren't present (overly sweet, caramel / butterscotch, abundance of hops). I could drink this on occasion, and glad I was able to try it!"
"Overall, the best barleywine I have ever tried. Quite delicious but to me also seems really similar to a quality quad, at least right now in the early going."

"I was prepared to be let down & now I'm all grinny. Not a chink in its armor, this is a masterpiece. If I'd have known, I'd have been hunting this one down with an elephant gun. Wow. Off to enjoy."
"I am a big fan of bourbon-barrel-aged English barleywines. In fact, I might even like them more than bourbon-barrel-aged imperial stouts. The combination of sweet, toffee-like malt and rich bourbon is hard to beat. Unfortunately, very few breweries that I have access to produce them so I've only had a couple of them. The bottom line is that they do not compare to this one. This is one of those beers where you think to yourself ``I wish Michael Jackson, the beer hunter, could have tried this. What would he think of it?'' I think I know what he'd say - that this is simply a masterpiece of the brewer's art."
""
"O: While I love every beer I've had in the BCBS line, this is at the bottom of the list. That being said, I guessed this would be the case just due to the nature of barleywines. Delicious, yet I'm comparing it to the original."

"T: Heavy sticky caramel right off the bat. Milk chocolate, burnt raisin, charred wood, toasted coconut. Finish of bourbon, burnt brown sugar and oak. A very good barleywine, but I don't think it's in the same class as Sucaba or Mother of All Storms."

"Pours a clear dark orange-brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, bourbon, and alcohol aromas. Taste is much the same with vanilla, caramel, brown sugar, and bourbon flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of woody bitterness and an alcohol kick on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with a great bourbon presence even though the barrels were third use for the barrel aging process."

"An excellent barleywine that is intensely and syrupy sweet. Not for everybody, but for those who like thick barleywines as meals, you'll love it."

"O - A great entry into the BC family. Doesn't present the barrel as much as the other variants, but remains a pinnacle of the style and supremely drinkable over a nice drawn out period. As with most of the series, drinking it over time really is the way to enjoy its complexities as the glass warms. I think my personal tastes still prefer the stout, but this is equal in terms of execution."

""
""

"O: I may be in the minority here, but this was just too much for me. As with everything in the Bourbon County series, this beer has a massive malt body. However, there is no attempt at balance, and the malt sweetness is allowed to run amok. It builds to near sickly, cloying levels. At times it feels as though I'm drinking straight molasses. Even a bourbon barrel is no match, and it slowly drowns in all the sweetness. I was ready to be done halfway through the bottle. Not worth the hype or the price tag at all."

"12oz bottle with a Bottled On date of 24Sep13. Pours a murky dark brownish color with no head. The aroma is a big whiff of bourbon with some dark fruits, earth, dark cherries, and maybe a hint of vanilla. The taste is bourbon upfront that mellows a bit and gives way to the dark cherries and earth. Plums, raisins and malts. Almost has a faint cola taste in the background, maybe even Cherry Coke. Warming alcohol with earth and dark cherries at the end. This one wasn't as boozey as I expected it to be, but there is certainly a big alcohol presence. Slick but heavy mouthfeel. When I heard there was going to be a Bourbon County Barleywine I was pumped. It did not disappoint. Overall, amazing."

" This is seriously complex! whew, I knew it wood be good -har har, but the rich toffee flavor with some vanilla notes of the barrel combine to bring a really delicious full flavor which leads to a tangy yeast fruitiness again bringing a fig-like richness to mind with a toasted oak goodness rounding out the taste with slight cocoa with gentle nutty creaminess toward the end. There is a slight alcohol taste but nowhere near 12%, it is hidden very well and halfway in it is not showing any heat or bourbon taste, yet the barrel influence is apparent. Overall I was not sure what to expect except the stout that previously resided in the barrels may have added to the flavor. I recommend this to anyone who considers themselves a fan of the style...I only wish I had purchased more - Kudos on a phenomenal beer that exceeded my expectations Goose Island!"

""

"Overall, I'm just blown away by this beer. I've had the standard BCBS before, but never any of the variants. The third-use bourbon barrels impart some characteristics of the stout and really bring a fascinating and wonderful dimension to this beer. It's one of those that you try and are so blown away by the experience that can't wait to share the details. Would be ecstatic to somehow get my hands on a bottle of this."

"O: My first impression was if the beer taste half as good as it smells it's going to be pretty awesome and it is. Hovering somewhere in that land between Barleywine and stout the dark malt brings a nice chocolate character to the beer. It's a sweet beer but not enough to keep me from enjoying two in an sitting; the abv will do that for me."

"Pitch perfect this shit is. The best beer I've had, and the first 5 I've ever issued (although Heady would have got one if it wasn't so ugly). I've heard GI Zombies say ""yeah, it's good, but it's no King Henry"". Not sure how King Henry could improve much on this....but the possibility that it does sure is appealing."
"Overall, a really tasty bourbon barrel barleywine. The barrel presence is strong but there is also a bit of a stout finish. The barrel flavors are great, but the base beer is a bit thin and feels like it could use more body and substance, but that's only nitpicking. This is pretty spot on."
""
""
""
""
""

"O - Lighter and fruitier than the stout, this is a monster beer but not stupefying. Might be my favorite of the Goose Island Bourbon County beers. Definitely my favorite European style barleywine by a mile."
""
"Overall: this is a good and complex beer. i like the use of older barrels to give the barleywine some room to shine. overall i'd say the alcohol is a bit too strong and it takes away from the beer. I would certainly buy it again but i am not gonna be goose hunting for this"
""

"Pick as much up as you can if you find it. It is worth a premium and competes with FW Sucaba for BBBWs."

"O - World class nose with an outstandingly complex flavor profile. At this level of quality the less significant (nitpicky) aspects of the brew start coming into play, and the BCB Barelywine comes up a little short of perfect. There's a distracting, abrupt transition early in the flavor profile that I'd prefer to have smoothed out, and on net the sweetness is just a shade past ideal. That said the flavor is still outstanding, and the mouthfeel is outrageous, particularly for the ABV."
"O: I’m impressed with this beer more than I’ve been with BCBS recently, especially because the aroma of dark, fruity sugars that instantly started emanated from the glass reminded me of one of my all-time favorites: DFH’s Raison D’Extra. Hope they continue this one for many years – and hey, how about a chocolate/coffee variant next year? A man can dream…"
"Pours a murky dark brown with small, quickly fading head. Not much lacing. This is the darkest barleywine I've ever seen. The best word to describe the aroma is wow! Raisin, molasses, bourbon, licorice, with a hint of chocolate and tobacco. This smells amazing. This is one sweet barleywine. Raisins and molasses hit the palate first giving way to bourbon notes with a sweet chocolate finish. The sweetness mutes the 12% ABV, this beer is definitely a sipper! Full bodied with moderate carbonation. Overall, this is a very well crafted English Barleywine. Great job Goose Island. Very well worth chasing down."
""
""
"O-another superb world class offering"
""
"O: Though this is a really good barleywine I still prefer normal BCBS. I think I was expecting this to be a bit better since I love BC and it did not live quite up to my expectations.

"12oz. bottle served in my Duck-Rabbit snifter. Pours the color and clarity of cola with a consistent, half-inch, tan-colored head that sizzles and dissipates towards the shoulders forming a creamy ring. Some lacing present, but no retention. Nose expresses vanilla, butterscotch and ethanol. Taste consistent with nose; however, a bit more sugary and flavorful than suggested by the aromas in the nose. Mouthfeel is medium-light in body, but comes off a little thin for the style. Texture is slightly oily and carbonation, while light and even, could be a little less assertive. Overall, a very good English Barleywine; however, I'm not sure it warrants a 100 rating (as of this review). That said, I'll throw a bottle in the cellar to see how it develops."

"Pours a dark, opaque near black with a thick but quickly fading dark yellow/khaki head; not much lace or retention. Balanced, restrained nose of oak, burnt sugar, caramel, toffee and molasses. Flavor is overly sweet; barrel heavy with vanilla, brown sugar and syrupy caramel combining with a sticky, malty English BW base. On its own this was interesting but next to a well aged King Henry seemed comically simple and boring. Body is pleasantly viscous and slick with minimal heat in the finish. Not sure this needs much age, but hopefully some time will rejigger these flavors into a more interesting combination. For price and difficulty in obtaining bottles, just go blow your money of BB4D or Central Waters or something."
"0- Very well done, wish I could have bought more than one bottle. Really feel this is a beer worth aging."

"What a beer. It's amazing how much bourbon is in this beer considering its a third use barrel. When i say this beer is alcoholic or boozey, I mean that in the best way possible. Just as good as king Henry. I kind of fail to find any bourbon county flavors (as I did with king Henry) other than the bourbon, but I'm sure it's just adding to the overall complexity."

"Poured into Half Acre snifter. Pours a deep hazy brown with minimal head and no retention. The nose is delightful. Starts with notes of bourbon soaked raisins, figs, heavy caramel, and notes of BCS peaking through which brings some fudge to the party. Taste starts with caramel and large BCS influence. The bourbon melds vary nicely with the base beer. Tons of complexity in the way of dark fruits, caramel, and chocolate. The finish leans towards the sweet side and has a nice bitter cocoa note on the end. Mouthfeel is big, viscous, and mildly carbonated. Overall, this is right there with King Henry. Granted, it has been a while since my last taste of King Henry, but I enjoy this as much as I remember enjoying King Henry. It's nice to see that Goose brought back the King in a way, I must say that I am well satisfied. I'm also a big fan of this being in 12 oz bottles. It's not everyday that I want to go crack a bomber of a 12% barleywine, but 12 ounces is way more manageable. Delicious!"

"This is a seriously amazing barleywine. A huge beer with tons and tons of flavor. Pours a very deep mahogany; dark brown with some reddish tinge. Thin khaki color head with little retention. Huge aroma of bourbon, molasses, red oak, caramel, tobacco, cocoa and wine just to name a few. As the beer warms it goes through several phases with different detectable aromas. Taste is wonderful! Sweet bourbon and oak upfront, vanilla, cherries, banana, and the aftertaste reminds me of a fortified port and sherry. Wonderfully complex. Mouthfeel is heavy and rich. Some moderate carbonation brings some of the lighter flavors to life. Not much booze on the palette but you can feel it in your nose and stomach. Very warming on a winter night! Overall, this might be my new favorite barleywine, but I'd have to compare this and Firestone's Stickee Monkey side-by-side. Superb brew!"
""
"o; Takes barleywine to a new level with added flavor and at first at least particularly well-covered high ABV. Curious that, unlike the BCB Stout, there is not much in the way of bourbon aroma or flavor considering this was aged in bourbon barrels. Perhaps it's because the barrels are ""third use"" with BCBS having already absorbed much of the bourbon in the wood."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall, this is a delicious beer, I just wish the nose was as rich as the flavour. I bet age is going to make this wonderful. Not overly sweet this has so much going for it. Tons of upside here."
""
""
""
""
"This is almost completely black and you can start to smell it from a foot away. Lots of chocolate, vanilla, dark caramel and spices. A similar flavor profile with less roast /chocolate and more dark sugar. A bit of alcoholic warmth in huge finish and lots of vanilla and whiskey character. It smells great, though the bourbon is almost too much and really tends to overwhelm everything else, especially in the flavor."
""
""
""
"This pours a dark brown color with little to no head. The aroma is full of barley and bourbon scents. The taste is sweet and has a thick volume to it that you have come to expect with the bourbon county label. Among the molasses and sweet flavor is just the right amount of rye flavor with hints of vanilla. Very delicious and very drinkable."
""
""
""
"Thick, lightly carbonated, and definitely a sipper that should be a prime candidate for any cellar."
"O - It is no KH so people can stop with that, it is however a really nice BA barleywine. It has everything I love in a BA Barleywine and it was still fairly easy to finish. I am going to need to get a few bottles of this before its all gone."
"GI knocked it out of the park again. Wish I could've landed more. Hopefully I can trade for some without sacrificing children or appendages."
"O- Just an intense beer. An extremely enjoyable experience to drink. The aroma, flavor and feel are just incredible. Really different than anything I have had. Hard to compare it to the great barleywines out there since this one drinks somewhat like a stout. Extremely well done."

"D - A beer that is surprisingly tame (and I mean this in a very good way) given it's high ABV and bourbon barrel aging... Near perfect in all facets... A bit more impressive appearance and a bit more of potent nose could make this a ""perfect 5"" across the board... I can't recommend highly enough as a limited release, English Barleywine, or bourbon barrel aged offering... I have a hard time believing that any self respecting BA could find fault with this offering..."
""
"O - the Bourbon County series sometimes gets a tad overhyped but I must say, this one is superbly blended. The only criticism is perhaps a little too thick and frothy but overall, well done."
""
""
"O: seems to be more of a light colored imperial stout, but that's fine with me. I love this beer. The smell and taste of the BCBS barrels is unmistakeable. I've seen many beers called the perfect winter warmer, but I think this one really is."
"A wonderful addition to the Bourbon County line. One of the best barrel aged barleywines."
"O - Rich and flavorful."
""
""
"Overall: Nothing like any other Barleywine I have had, as aging it in barrels that once held Bourbon County Stout (that of course held Bourbon before that) as done sublime things to the base beer. Extraordinary, and I will likely never have it again."
""
""
"O- This is great, lots of decadence, lots of flavor that you can really sit on for a bit and may still not have a full read on all this brew has to offer. Look forward to seeing how it ages"
""
""
"Big, sticky and sweet. Nicely warming and complex."
"(O)- Absolutely superb. It is literally King Henry Jr. A superb barleywine with superb barrel aging. King Henry is still better, but this is an excellent replacement."
""
""
"Deep amber almost brown body with highlights around the glass that catch the light in the room. There are limited cream colored bubbles that require agitation. The smell is dark fruits, toffee, caramel, oak, and light booze. This beer is quite complex. You get all the flavors from the nose. Some candi sugar as well. It is not cloying sweet. There is some bourbon with a few notes of BCBS like vanilla and roast. Mostly toffee and dark fruits. The mouthfeel is rich and satisfying. Top notch brew. Can't wait until my next one."

"Wonderful dessert like flavors mixed with a subtle, sweet boozey character. Great example of a barrel aged English barleywine. Glad I got a bit of this to age, I only see it improving."

"Nice job, Goose Island/ABI. This is a beer that is worth fighting in line over on Black Friday, although I wasn't in a place where they did the Black Friday release. Marvelous barleywine that I really enjoyed. Nowhere near King Henry level- no other barleywine is ever going to match that- but this is still pretty good. I don't see any point in aging this- this beer is ready to drink fresh."

"Overall a real unique tasting barleywine that hints almost into large dark fruit territory, but is sort of not what I expected or look for in this style. It is however a very unique tasting brew and memorable, a mix of classic Goose Island Stout barrel aging and Fruit Barleywine character, not unlike King Henry."

"Certainly deserving of the Bourbon County brand, this barleywine rivals its imperial stout sibling. Definitely worth seeking out"

"O - This is probably the 3rd best barleywine I've had. The K13 and then Aged KH second. Want infinitely more of this."
""
""
"Single finger off white head on a very deep dark amber brown body with excellent lacing. Aroma is a bit light with notes if dark fruit, caramel, some coffee and the bourbon but mild. Flavor follows with more dark fruit mostly raisin, dark grapes and strawberry follows buy caramel malts coffee and brown sugar rounded off at the end by the bourbon finish. This one is unapologetically boozy. Medium to full body and light carbonation. Although I have had better barleywines, few compare to this one."

"o - Overall I thought this was awesome; exactly what I was hoping for. Tons of delicious bourbon, fruits, and caramel to it, and there it is not too hot. Love that it is coming in 12 oz. bottles too. Reminds me a bit of King Henry, though a bit more dark fruits. Well worth it, glad to have a few bottles and really hope they make this year round."
""
""
""
"This is a medium to fuller bodied brew with a moderate amount of carbonation. A boozy sipper that is quite complex and certainly worth seeking out. Considering the amount of bourbon county stout that was/is made, I hope this means this brew will see greater volume/distribution in the future. This offering comes out with the bar set unreasonably high falling in the wake of King Henry...I wont draw any comparisons to that brew but wow is this good and everything I hoped it would be. Damn, I would like more of this."

"OVERALL: I suppose I should have expected the unexpected from a beer aged in barrels that had previously aged BCBS that had originally been Bourbon barrels. That said, I was surprised by quite a few aspects of this beer. This is quite a tasty treat, but I will be looking forward to seeing how it does in a year or two."

"Overall: Well this didn't disappoint. Super complex and flavorful and goes down smooth as hell. This is absolutely worthy of the Bourbon County label."

"Goose Island Bourbon County Brand Barleywine Ale ---4.5/5"

"I was extremely impressed with this offering - it brings this style to a whole new level, a definite one-up from other barrel aged barleywines I've tried.

"Very deep, chestnut brown color. Very dark though appears somewhat muddy looking. Not much carbonation going on here. Vinuous aroma of treacle, burnt sugars and a whole lot of bready malt. The intense bourbon has faded somewhat as it has warmed. Mellow oakiness with the underlying bourbon. Thick, caramel flavors with a nice highlight of bourbon. Oak and vanilla, somewhat of a sherry tinge. The bourbon tends to linger on the palate. Smooth and sticky mouthfeel with a slight booziness. Just a great beer all in. Really was afraid the bourbon would be too much but it all is balanced exceptionally well. And I thought the stout would be hard to top-this almost comes close."

"Verdict: A knockout barleywine from Goose Island. It's not quite as rounded and balanced as King Henry, but it's wonderful and showcases the barleywine qualities nicely. The old stout is expressed well, but doesn't dominate, and the raisin quality is really pleasant. No surprises here, just artfully crafter beer."

"Outstanding. Another impressive notch in the belt of GIs barrel aged portfolio."

"O- A great beer, I'm just sad I could only find one bottle of the stuff. Next year will be a different story though you can bet on that. Old Ales/Barleywines are easily my favorite style and this one reminded me of Bell's Third Coast Old Reserve which is aged in spent Black Note barrels, similar to this beer. Would really love to try the base beer of this sometime."
""
""
""
"O: overall this is a very tasty beer but I am so turned off by the prices some of these breweries charge now for a brewery that is focused on efficiency and was just bought by InBev that this will be the last time that I try to seek this out. They will have tons of this stuff left over once InBev gets their hands around the brewers throats and I just won't pay that much for a four pack. What a joke to see shops holding back on selling a 4 pack to someone based on their familiarity with the shopper. Craft beer is dying and I'm tired of this hipster selling practice."

"O: Before BCBBW, I thought Wulver was the pinnacle of what (bourbon) barrel-aging could do for a beer. I've now had the two side by side, and I really can't decide which I like better. This is a truly marvelous beer, and the chocolate flavors really take this English-style barley wine to a new level."

"Rich like Warren Buffett, smooth as Lou Rawls' voice. Full bodied, minimal effervescence. A sipping beer for sure. This reminds me of the Sam Adams Triple Bock I had in 1999, thick, boozy, warming, delicious. Better warm (room temperature for this one). A bit syrupy at the swallow is the only knock against it. If you can, you better or you'll hate yourself later. I'm glad I have a 4 pack sitting at home."

"Pours a murky dark brown color with a thin mocha colored head that leaves behind a very thin ring of lacing. Smells of tons of toffee and carmel, some chocolate, hint of coffee, oak, some vanilla, molasses, bourbon goodness, slight dark fruit. Very complex aroma. Taste is just as complex. Starts with the typical toffee/carmel, as well as dark fruit and molasses. The middle then brings in the outstanding barrel qualities. Oak, vanilla, and bourbon meld into the toffee, carmel, molasses, and dark fruits. The finish is heavenly. Big sweetness from the carmel, toffee, and molasses, along with dark fruits like raisins, vanilla, bittering hops, oak, and a good amount of bourbon. Getting a butterscotch note in there too. Also get bcbs qualities from the barrel, which stands this beer out in terms of ba barleywines. Get some chocolate and roastiness that go really well with all the other sweet flavors. Warming sensation going down, but not really ""hot."" Full body with a creamy and sticky feel to it. Just the right amount of carbonation. I did not think it would, but this definitely lived up to the hype. Glad I was able to pick up a lot of this. An extremely complex and outstanding beer."
"Overall: I had a bottle of King Henry about two weeks ago and the experience is still fairly fresh in my mind because King Henry is still kicking ass if you cellared your bottle properly. I think that Bourbon County Barleywine has a little weaker barrel presence in nose and flavor profile than King Henry, but the mouthfeel seems better than King Henry did fresh. Bourbon County Barleywine is a bit more fruity than King Henry; it seems as though more of the base beer comes through in Bourbon County Barleywine. It also seems that King Henry is a little more barrel forward of an English Barleywine than Bourbon County Barleywine. With all that said... Great effort on this beer and I will gladly seek out more of this beer! Thank you Goose Island for putting a great English Barleywine into a small format bottle and in 4 packs to boot! I dont know of many barrel aged English Barleywines that come in single serve bottles that are at this high of quality! I think that this will also be a good beer to sit on, it should age well. Welcome to the ""Bourbon County"" family Bourbon County Barleywine...hoping that you become a yearly release!"
"A great addition to the Bourbon County line and a fantastic BA BW worth seeking out."
"This long-awaited treasure actually showed up in mid-Missouri, much to my surprise, and a 4-pk set me back about $18.00. Figured I’d try one fresh and age the rest. The bottled-on date here shows September 24th, 2013. An elevated pour into my Duvel tulip shows a dark walnut beer, crowned with a tan cap which, on account of the pour and the nucleation in the tulip, actually shows a bit better retention than I was expecting. BCB is almost completely opaque, though there are a few garnet highlights at the bottom of the tulip when held to the light. A riot of red and dark fruit notes emerges first, and these are followed by some toasty brown malt notes, a hint of nuttiness, and faint notes of whiskey and wood. Perhaps a ghostly note of burnt molasses as this approaches room temperature, possibly from the BCBS contribution. On the palate, this shows strong notes of booze up front. The booze stops just short of being hot and, if it weren’t for the intense flavors and significant sweetness, this might seem a bit over-the-top in terms of alcoholic strength. The flavors are a bit muddled at this point, but there’s sweet, sticky dark caramel, some dark red fruits, just a bit of toasted nuttiness, and just the slightest hint of something I’m not entirely enamored with…perhaps just a slightly metallic edge to the molasses flavors (something readily apparent in many high-octane imperial stouts, including BCBS, when young) but I’m guessing that this will mellow with age. Rich, thick, boozy mouthfeel. Rich almost beyond description. Is it King Henry? Not quite. But this is a damn fine English-style barleywine, and one which I have no doubt will improve"

"O- This was a fantastic barleywine that is easily up there with the best. It's still fairly hot right now, but I think it will be perfect with a year or two on it. I've found that I love barleywines that are used in third use barrels after holding high quality bourbon and a stout, I feel like the stout adds an additional complexity to the barleywine bringing out more dark fruits. Overall I'm glad I joined the masses searching for this on Black Friday, I just wish I could have found more then three bottles!"
""
"O: Overall, a very good beer. For some reason, I think I actually preferred this one to King Henry, though I'll admit I drank KH some time ago and have had many, many beers in the interim. Never-the-less, this one should be much easier to find while still worth the search."

"O/D-A decadent Barleywine. A solid addition to the Bourbon County lineup. Definitely worth a bottle if you stumble upon it. Somewhere between very good and excellent."

"I was able to get a bottle of this before black Friday, $5.99. Color is super dark brown, head died quick fast. Aroma is whiskey, sweet, fruity. Flavor is fruity, boozy, and might even have a touch of bourbon county stout but maybe that is the power of suggestion. Overall, pretty solid bourbon barrel barleywine but to me not as good as Bligh's or Abacus. I never had the original King Henry either so I can't speak to that one. Still, glad I bought a couple bottles."

I've been lucky enough to have this repeatedly over the year and it is amazing. It has changed but not dramatically like some barley wines. I don't know how they did it but the 3 use barrel aging must be the way to go. Hats off."

"This great idea by Goose Island pours a rich and full bodied dark, dark charred rosewood in color with a one finger, very creamy one finger beige head. As the beer pools in the glass it actually comes just short of being black. If you saw it from a distance you could easily mistake it for an imperial stout. It fully coats the glass and possesses a good amount of residual sugar. The nose is actually very similar to Bourbon County. It is a touch sweeter and and lacks the complete richness that accompanies Bourbon County but I can say that it certainly doesn't smell too much like any other barleywines out there (King Henry excluded of course). The stout influence is impressive. The beer is big and rich. It features big, sweet malt with candied sugars, chocolate, and a touch of roast and drinks like it is half Bourbon County. It has a lot of flavor. I love how much the Bourbon County influence shows itself in the aftertaste as well, resonating for a few minutes. It drinks full bodied and is very smooth. It isn't hot at all (unlike King Henry when it was released). This is a very well rounded, and polished, beer from Goose Island. I'm very impressed. I'm sure this will be all that most people could imagine a Barleywine could be."
"O - This is a great Barleywine and one that is definitely worth seeking out. It reminds me of King Henry without the butterscotch from the PVW barrels. This really shows to me that the second use BCBS barrels (3rd use overall barrels as they like to call it) helps adds the distinctive chocolate flavor and smoothness in this Barleywine."
"I definitely plan on aging more of these and hope this isn't a one off from them. Overall a great addition to the bourbon county brand. Would highly recommend this to all barleywine fans, all bcbs fans and all beer drinkers."

"Toffee and caramel in spades, bourbon-soaked wood, vanilla, plum, malty bread crust in the aftertaste and dry wood. Full bodied and smooth, though the bourbon is fully present, it's more of a warming feeling. Very rich but drinkable, with some nice complexity from both the barrel and base beer. Different from King Henry obviously, but not a bad substitute by any means."
