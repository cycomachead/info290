"One of a large number of samples I had at the Extreme Beer Fest in Boston 3/21/32014. Sweet and fruity with a hint of alcohol."

"Candy/dessert/syrup-like but I enjoy."

"Gorgeous dark amber/ruby body with a frothy off-white head that lingers around. Aroma is sweet, sugary bourbon, figs, with a dash or earthiness and oak. Flavor is fantastic, with candied sugar coming through in big ways. Some dried fig flavors come through too, along with a hint of woody maple. Feel is thick and syrupy with a lingering sugary sweetness and low carbonation. Overall this is a tremendous beer that is rich and satisfying. Lots of candied sugar flavor."
"Got in a BIF from ZebraCakez. 500 ml bottle into snifter, bottled on 9/12/2014. Pours slightly hazy dark ruby red color with a 1 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings around the glass, with a light amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big caramel, toffee, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, raisin, prune, fig, date, vanilla, bourbon, oak, and oak/toasted earthiness. Fantastic aromas with awesome complexity and balance of dark/bready malt, dark fruit, and bourbon barrel notes; with good strength. Taste of huge caramel, brown sugar, toffee, toast, brown bread, raisin, prune, fig, date, vanilla, bourbon, oak, and oak/toasted earthiness. Slight oaky bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, brown bread, raisin, prune, fig, date, vanilla, bourbon, oak, and oak/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Absolutely insane complexity and robustness of dark/bready malt, dark fruit, and bourbon barrel flavors; with an amazing malt/barrel balance and no cloying sweetness after the finish. Light carbonation and very full bodied; with a very creamy, slick, and lightly syrupy mouthfeel that is amazing. Alcohol is extremely well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an absolutely world class barrel aged barleywine style. All around insane complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready malt, dark fruit, and bourbon barrel flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the huge ABV. An absolutely mind blowing offering."

"This beer is astounding. And, while it is a sipper, it is so deceptively smooth that you may find yourself drinking it too fast. God bless you, Jack's Abby!"

"Phenomenal beer.  Maybe my favorite from the brewery.  Taste is vanilla, bourbon, caramel, and oak.  A sipper due to the complexity of flavors that unravel with each sip.  This is right up there with Firestone Walker's English barleywines for being the king in a really good style.  Well done Jack's Abby."

"Caramel, vanilla, toffee, and oak. Good amount of sweetness. So smooth. No alcohol heat at all. Delicious."
""
"A lot of malt and caramel.  Not my favorite offering by them, but not the worst."
"dark caramel color.  very malty.  the sweetness lingers for a long time.  i liked it a lot but should have shared this with a buddy.  2 glasses might be an overload of malt flavor.  that being said, can't wait to try this again in 2 years.  it should mellow out and develop nicely."

"Not my favorite jacks Abby offering. This brew is very sweet with too much carmel for my tastes."

"Pours lushly with a deep amber that is blushing a touch of red.  The color of brick orange.  Softly hazy from it's depths rather than from any actual haze .  It's simply dappled with golden hues and not thin so it has a lovely glow to it .  I poured into a small tasting glass , so no head but I do have bubbles that refresh on each tip, spots that cling with alcohol legs and a very thin ring.  My first impression of the nose was almond with the skin of the almond.   Nutty, honey, molasses.  Sweet grain and a lazy bourbon scent.  A touch of vanilla and some decadent  dried dark fruits.  Taste is sumptuous. Not cloying but has an actual lip smacking stickiness to it.  There is caramel and toffee, a honey sweetness over the top of nuts. dried dark fruits give it gaiety and it's like a rich sticky bread with days of sweetness in it.  No heat from alcohol at all this finishes soft and without much carbonation. Positively seductive."

"The aroma lead me on to the lager wine aspect of the beer while I found more complexity from the barrels, malts and yeast in the flavor. For 13% this is borderline insane but in the end a huge sweetness keeps it from truly being amazing. In the end it's great minus the sweets and one must be reminded it's a lager; keep it up Jacks Abby"

"Framinghammer gets a lot of publicity from Jack's Abbey but this beer is right up there with the best of them. Awesome from the nose to the taste to the way it goes down. Definitely worth seeking out."
"Seriously?  I thought this was awful.  Just too damn hot, boozy, and cloyingly sweet.  Maybe I don't know WTF I am talking about, but I've had plenty of barley wines that I've enjoyed before.  Sadly, this was not one of them.  Blech!"
"I did not know at first that this was a barrel aged beer, the aroma suggested barrel aging, the taste confirmed. Though it is a subtle barrel presence. Very deep garnet colored with very little to no head. Some spots cling to the glass. Aroma of stewed fruits, caramel, toffee, vanilla, cherry and a good bit of prunes, brown sugar also presents itself. Taste, sweet, maybe a little too sweet, bordering on cloying. Tastes of cherry and vanilla, toasted oak, and toffee. A little burn on the finish. Slick oily, thick, as stated kind cloying. In the end I would like this a little dryer, perhaps aging this one would be proper. If I see it again, I'd pick one up and cellar it."

"This lager pours a reddish brown with zero head or lacing to speak of. Aromas of caramel, toffee, marshmallows,  and hints of bourbon. Flavors are more pronounced with a blend of vanilla, toffee, caramel,  black cherries, candy sugar, and bourbon.  Mouthfeel is sticky and syrupy. Low carbonation which lends itself well to the beer. Really an excellent alternative to a barleywine."

"Way too sweet.sweetest beer I've ever had."
"Pours very dark with minimal very thin head. Smells and taste of both carmel and bourbon. The bourbon perfect, not overpowering. Overall great barrel aged beer from JA."
"Overall - Incredible, seek this brew out immediately"

"Overall I'm am blown away by this. What a category destroyer! While not my favorite ""barleywine", it definitely can hang with the big boys. Jack's Abby really knocked this outta da Paaaak!"

"As someone who recently had a taste of 2011 Utopias, i can see a lot of similarities between the two. This is almost like a less boozy version. very sweet in both taste and aroma. Alot of vanilla, toffee and caramel which is brought out even moreso with the bourbon."
"Jacks Abby continues in the Vanguard of American Lager Craft Brewers."

"This is a great example of the style, but far too sweet for my tastes. The first lagered barley wine I've had. Lots of deep, rich flavors, yet light,. But it's so sweet and syrupy, and boozy, that after the first few sips it took effort for me to finish this brew,"

"This is definitely a top-tier barleywine, and possibly the best thing Jack's Abby has ever made."

"Bottle. Had Baby Maker at a beerfest, it did not resonate with me. Of course I puke up $10 for a 500ml again. I'm an advocate. It pours a deep, dark Amber color with a head that only manifests itself as an outer halo of tan bubbles. Refuses to lace. Nose is strong. Lots of oak and a boozy, wet, cereal aroma. Loads of toffee and caramel. Some dried hay. The flavor is sneakily very approachable. Boozy, oaky and slick. Sweet, dark, ripe fruit. Oaky and sweet, sugary grain and cereal. Raisin and dried apricot. The body is very full. Mild carbonation. Hot, hot heat and a dry finish. Impressed by how quickly the immense sweetness disperses off my palate. Might have to buy another $10 500ml and throw it in my bag of cellar tricks."

"O- This, despite the change in recipe, will be compared to babymaker due to the name. Good for this beer though, as it is very drinkable fresh compared to BM, not nearly as boozy. I also look forward to how this ages as it is very reminiscent of a well done english barleywine, just with lager yeast instead of traditional ale."
