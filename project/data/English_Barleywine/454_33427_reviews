"The bottle I had was a 2010 Vintage."
""
"I prefer my barleywines on the maltier side, and this certainly did not disappoint in that regard.  There is oodles of complex sweetness to enjoy, and the appearance and mouthfeel complement it admirably.  The instability of the taste toward the middle is an unusual detractor, but it didnâ€™t prevent me from enjoying the bigger picture."

"This bottle had a year on it when opened - pours a golden, toffee color. The aroma is slightly oaky, with a sherry like nose. Easy sipper - the complexities open up as this warms. I feel that with a further year on this it would be even better. Lots of sugar and dried fruit/candied fruit elements here that I would be interested to stack up in a year or so."
"Overall: Pleasant enough at first, but lacking enough strength to make a lasting impression. The astringent cherry character becomes more and more cloying, and the beer would be hard to finish if it weren't for the light, yet detectable balance brought on by earthy hops and buttery melanoidins."
""
""
"Bottle: Poured a deep brown color ale with a nice foamy head. Aroma of caramelized cereal notes with some toffee. Taste is also dominated by some caramelized sugar notes with some toffee and light butter notes. Finish is dryer then I would have expected. Body is full enough for style with good amount of carbonation. Nice beer but I thought it fell a bit short on the drinkability and smoothness."

"O - Very decent barley wine. Would prefer a little less hops and more sweetness. Still very drinkable."

"I wasn't the hugest fan of Barleywines (which is why I went so long without buying one), but now I think I'm changing my stance. I enjoy the insane amount of malt flavor, the slight tanginess, and the warmth in my belly from this one. The feel could maybe use a little work, but the amount of sweetness is spot on -- any more and this beer would be cloying. I'd be very interested in buying another one and cellaring it for about five years or so. The only real flaw I have with this brew is that it could use some more flavor depth... I could find that in the BBA version if I could get my hands on it. Try this one out."

"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was its robustness of flavoring. This of course, as we set out to discover, was vastly different across the years of the vintage. The freshest edition was a bit harsh, giving nothing big enough for the booze to hide behind. It came out swinging, mixing with bright chemical phenols, cloying sugars, and plastics, for a curiously imbalanced sip. This improved a great deal with warmth, however, allowing for the inherent sugariness of the malts shine through strongly enough to break the cycle. That said, the 2010 vintage was vastly superior from the first sip and then after. It started with the desired blend, with the booze, actually, hardly noticeable at times. The fruit, malts, and muskiness of it remained clean, and was a single entity by the end. This was an exciting, revealing experience, and it certainly helped us to refine our opinions about cellaring vs. drinking fresh. So, based on our experiment here, we recommend that you sit on the fresh Cereal Killer you have, so as to allow it to calm and blend enough for all of its components, nooks, and crannies to click."

"While there's a richness to this beer, the body is medium rather than full, and it works. It supports a flowing creaminess."

"22 ounce bottle into snifter; 3 year cellar aged version released this year, making it a 2010 vintage. Pours lightly hazy dark ruby red color with a small dense cream colored head with decent retention, that reduces to a thin lace cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing on the glass. Aromas of big raisin, fig, apple, caramel, molasses, toast, sherry, brown sugar, light chocolate, light pepper, and earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt/fruity notes; very sweet, but not offensively so. Taste of raisin, fig, apple, caramel, molasses, toast, sherry, brown sugar, light chocolate, light pepper, and earthiness. Lingering notes of dark fruits, caramel, molasses, toast, brown sugar, sherry, light chocolate, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very good balance and complexity of malt and fruity notes; with no cloying sweetness present after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and full bodied; with a creamy and slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice English Barleywine. All around nice balance and complexity of malt and fruity flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering."

"Overall a fantastic beer and even better with a couple years of age on it"
"I've been on a journey to try Michigan beers lately. Arcadia Ales is certainly one brand that stands a bit taller and this beer contributes to their stature.It pours a beautiful reddish brown,with only a small amount of lace. The smell is rather complex and should take a couple whiffs to fully appreciate. There are the usual toffee smells, but also subtle hints of cereal. The taste is sublime, having a mellow sweetness balanced with the aged flavor natural to this type of beer. It then finishes with a touch of bittersweet thickness. Good beer and a good example of the Barleywine Style."

"Deep murky brown with some ruby at the edges, light ring of off white head at the edges, no lace. Smell is a nice mix of fruit and malts, cherry and darker fruit, some dark sugars as well here, a bit of earthy hops as well as raisin. Taste has big malty flavours, cherry raisin and dark fruit are all present, fruity/earthy hop bill make for a nice restrained bitterness, mild caramel and toffee sweetness, aftertaste of fruit in dark sugar. Lightly carbonated, medium body. A solid and serviceable barleywine, a very enjoyable slow sipper."
"O - Being relatively new the style, I could definitely tell it fits the description of barleywine, but Cereal Killer has fallen short of the others I've tried (Founders Bolt Cutter, DFH Olde School). However, the complexity of the style may have me coming back to this one in the future."

"O- I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this beer. I like barleywines, but I have never had one on cask. This beer was very well balanced and the high ABV was hardly noticeable."
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: doesn't do it for me. the hoppiness is a little overdone and takes to much away from the malts. the alcohol is too overbearing as well"
""
""
""
""
"O - Haven't had this fresh, but it is nice with a few years on it. I wish the alcohol were toned down just a bit, but this is tasty English barleywine."
""
""
""
"O - Very pleasant beer, a nice example of the genre. I'm impressed with how the sweetness of the initial flavour, which is considerable, is balanced by the bitterness on the end. I bought a single bottle of this with a contingency for a four-pack, and I think I'll have to follow through on it. At 10% abv, I feel this beer would age well."
""
""
""
""
"O - This one is a pretty decent sipping barley wine which has developed really well since 09. If you can age one this long the alcohol dies off and is not detectable. Worth picking up if you like a sipper that has the typical barley wine malty flavors. Note the hops have died on this one. Cheers!"
"O- I would of rated this much higher if it weren't for that sour fruit. Nicely spiced, nice oily mouthfeel. I had higher hopes for this. I'd like to have some of this to age and see what becomes of it."
""
""
"Overall nothing really to run out again get again (especially since I got this in Ohio) but a very well crafted barleywine."
"12 ounce bottle, 2010 vintage. Served in a snifter, the beer pours a murky mahogany brown color with about an inch tan head that sticked around a little while. There's also a good amount of lacing. Aroma is nice, it smells like brown sugar, caramel, toffee, dark fruit (raisins, plums) and bready malt. The taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also the addition of some sherry and a bit of sweet spice. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's coating and a bit creamy with moderate carbonation. I think it's a good overall brew, I'd buy this again in the future and probably age it longer next time."
"O: This is a classic barleywine, and it would make a great first introduction when introducing friends to this style of beer. It does all the things a barleywine should do, and it does them well; and, it also avoids going beyond the style. It focuses squarely on malt flavors of sweetness, toasted grains, and just a bit of dark fruit along with some yeast. Most of all, everything remains subtle and smooth and blends together well. This is a first class barleywine that is definitely in the top tier of selection available in this style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a crystal clear dark brown with ruby highlights and a smallish off white head that slowly dissipates to a cap. Smells of dark brown sugar, raisins, prunes, and plums, and a bit of alcohol. The flavor is filled with lots of dark and brown sugars, a bit of non descript fruit and a healthy dose of ethanol. Medium to thick body with a light level of carbonation and a sweet almost syrupy mouthfeel. Decent barleywine, but a bit on the hot side. I enjoyed this, but I would be curious to see how a little age might affect this brew."
""
""
"O. Not the best barley wine I've had, but I like it. Very drinkable, I wouldnt mind aging a few in the cellar. I would recommend this beer to a friend."
""
""
"Big and sweet with a lot of dark fruit (mostly prune & dates), molasses and leather. The booze is pretty well hidden."
"Cereal Killer is not as complex as some Barleywines I have drunk. If you like your Barleywines with a boozy bite Cereal Killer is for youâ€¦.Iâ€™ll have another."
"O: Nice barleywine that is quite drinkable. Worth a try."
""
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with good flavors and aromas."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I've been exploring this style more, but always come back to this. Compared to other barleywines, this one goes on forever in depth. A lot to enjoy in a small bottle, may need to grab a 750ml next time"
""
"Not really great. Some weird flavors for a barleywine and way too sweet even while cold. After warming became almost cloying. Probably won't be buying this again."
""
"O: this beer may not have been stored properly since it's already partially oxidized. It's not very good, though. Not undrinkable, but not appetizing either."
"O: I don't know how this beer is fresh, but this four year old bottle gave me nothing but raisons and booze. If the smell hadn't been so overwhelming it probably would have been easier to drink. As it was, I couldn't finish the bottle. I'll be holding off trying another barleywine for a long time."
""
"Overall: Solid offering here would like a little more sweetness from the malt profile. That would make this beer really tasty."
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm not sure what this beer tastes like fresh, but it's very enjoyable with 2 years on it."

""
""
"O- very enjoyable"
""
"A nice sipping beer that improves dramatically with warmth. This one aged two years in the cellar."
"Read the other reviews for a taste profile. On tap this was a perfect beer for me. Went out while vacationing in Detroit (!) and bought a 6 pack to bring back the goodness to Florida. Not nearly as good from the bottle. Much more hops. Quite bitter (which is fine for hop heads) but for me it was a bit less balanced than when it was on tap. Still good, but a notch down from great."
""
""
"Hadn't had a barleywine since a Bell's Old Third Coast like, a year ago! What the hell was I thinking... time to dive back in."
"O: A might fine barley wine. Its a heavy hitter at 10%, but drinks better than that. Enjoy this one. Its worth a try."
""
""
"Pours a ruddy reddish/brown, almost garnet color with a nice finger and half worth of foamy head which dissipates quickly with marginal lacing/adhesion to the side of the glass. The smell is rich in caramel and dark fruit. Raisins, figs, dried cherries...all present. However, I find it a bit of an odd scent for this style. Maybe it's just me, but I find it to be unique in a little bit of an offputting fashion. The taste resonates with the nose, following quickly in it's footsteps. More raisins (lots), figs, even dates. This is a strange bird. Perhaps when you've been drinking the likes of Abacus, Commander, King Henry, and Bligh's recently, this is destined to seem a bit more ordinary. This is a decent enough beer, however, and I really need to revisit it when I haven't been on a binge of big barley wines. The mouthfeel is on the sweet side. Real sweet. All of those fruits are like...candy. There's a slight tinge of booziness in the finish towards the back of your throat, but all in all the ABV is hidden pretty masterfully. This is a good barleywine. On the grand scheme of things, I consider it average only because of what else I've had. However, if you've never had Patron Anejo, then I can see where 1800 comes across as a decent enough tequila. I'd like to revisit this when I'm not as biased towards some of the premium offerings."
" Overall a nice treat"

"**As a follow up consumed later at a room temperature and vastly improved overall drinking experience moving overall up to 3.5 and taste to 4. In future, will drink Barley Wines at 50' to 65'."
"Very much surprised and impressed with this less noticed barleywine. I would definately purchase this again."
"This was a sledgehammer of a beer, and I'm not sure what to make of it yet. It packed an overwhelming amount of booze,sugars, malt, and whuppass. At times I had a tough time choking a sip down, at other times I found the whole thing fabulous. I like barleywines, but I haven't figured out yet if this was incredibly good or incredibly not good. Best bet is to give it medium marks (yes, you BA gurus, a B is a medium mark. I know where you come from it is a high mark, but on earth, B is a medium mark), and encourage the reader to try for themselves."
""
""
"Overall: Easy to drink Barley wine at careful speed. Can barely feel the high content of alcohol in the beverage. Very good when fresh(this review made while drinking a fresh bottle ['11]); but this beer can definitely be laid down to add more complex flavors to it."
""
"O - I can see this being a good after-dinner beer or something like that, but it's a lot to handle, personally."
""
"Overall I thought that this was a good English Barleywine. It had all tho flavors that you would expect from an English Barleywine, no added tricks like some of the American ones, just a straight forward and malty Barleywine. This beer has pretty good drinkability for a Barleywine, it's not too boozy or too bitter, I should have no problem drinking the rest of this bottle. What I liked most about this beer was the taste, It had all the nice flavors I expect out of a malt forward Barleywine and the raisin flavor really stuck out which I liked, the mouthfeel was pretty good also. What I liked least about this beer was the aroma, it wasn't bad it was just very sweet and somewhat similar to a sweet sherry and the head was pretty lackluster. I would pick up a bottle of this again when in the mood for a good malty Barleywine, but for the price I think I will just get a single bottle and stay away from the four packs, I wish it was a little cheaper. I would recommend this this beer to people who like malt forward Barleywines, it does a good job at showcasing some great malty flavors. I was pretty happy with this beer, it was pretty straight forward and it didn't have any off flavors, it was solid. Arcadia did a good job with this beer and I think it would get even better after another year, I also think this would make a great candidate for barrel aging, I think the flavors of the beer would go great with some bourbon or rum barrels."
"This beer pours a nice slightly cloudy dark brown color. It has a fluffy 2-finger off-white head resting on top. The head has good retention, and leaves a nice bit of lace behind on the glass. The nose has a nice bit of toasted and caramel malt. There are also some aromas of dark fruit such as plug, fig, raisin, and cherry. There is also quite a bit of booze coming through as well. The taste pretty much follows the nose. The taste pretty much follows the nose. It starts off with some sweet bready maltiness. There is a nice toasty flavor, as well as some caramel and all the dark fruit notes that were present in the nose. There is a good bit of booziness here as well. The finish leaves some lingering sweetness, toasted maltiness, and booziness. This has a medium body and good carbonation. It goes down easy and has a really smooth feel to it. There is some sweetness and a toasted malt bitterness. The finish leaves some boozy warmth lingering in the mouth and throat. There is good drinkability here. It goes down easy and the flavor is really nice. It is a bit of a sipper, but I could definitely do a few glasses of this in a night. Overall, I really enjoyed this one and I think it is a really nice barleywine. I recommend checking this one out. I would buy it again for sure."

"Nice to see some heavy-hitters on the Bliss docket this week. This one pours a kinda murky amber-brown topped by a half-finger of khaki foam. The nose comprises sweet caramel, acetone, buttery toffee, light biscuit, and light vanilla. I'm sure there could have been more, but the acetone singed my nostrils a bit... The taste holds notes of buttery biscuits, deep caramel, butterscotch, vanilla, nutmeg, booze, dark fruit, and light honey. Yeah, the booze is still pretty strong here, but not as o'erwhelming a force as the one that met my nose. The body is a strong medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta dry finish. Overall, this b-wine is something of a challenge to really get into, but it's not all that unenjoyable, surprisingly. I can't really explain it, but I felt generally good about this beer after drinking it despite my general distaste for some of its constituent parts. Odd..."
"O- Thought this was a pretty good barleywine, at least better than it's rated."
"It seems better balanced than most, and a bit easier to drink. It is boozy tasting. I would buy this again if I were looking for a full fledged barleywine that is ready to drink."
"This beer poured out as a dark amber color, the head was tan and was a little fizzy. The lacing and retention were minimal. The smell of the beer gives off a boozy sweetness along with some fermented dark fruits in the mix. The taste of the beer was pretty good, a little sweet upfront and then it fades into a dry hoppy bitterness. The mouthfeel was a little thick which wasn't too bad. Overall I found this to be a pretty good brew."
"O: I wouldn't pour this in my cereal..."
"I was blown away by this one. Pours a nice hazy red/orange color. not much head aside from a thin layer that quickly dissipated. Flavors come off as having notes of dark fruits and apple with spices blended in subtly. It reminds me of an apple cider more than anything. Hops provide a light bitterness that works with the malts beautifully. I realize that taste is subjective but this is the best barley wine I have ever had. Very impressed and I'll be buying this again."
"O - This is a barleywine to be enjoyed by those who do not like the hoppy American style. Lots of malt with almost zero hop taste."
"At about over a year since bottled, this has been tamed but the flavors don't jive well for me. Not insanely hot, the English ingredients namely the yeast is what gets in the way. Also, why is this stuff so damn expensive?"
"O: Overall, pretty good English-style barleywine. Easy to drink but not much complexity."
"O- A decent barleywine. I don't know whether this got better from the years, but I'd speculate that it's best fresh. It seemed very tame for a barleywine. On the other hand, the alcohol was far from sight, and it's drinkability was very solid. It drinks quite smooth, but I can't say that's something I personally look for."
"O- decent barleywine but nothing really stood out to me."
"This bottle was from 2008. I don't think it ages well."
"O - I really enjoyed this beer. Arcadia does a fine job with their specialty beers just as they do with their 'everyday drinkers'."
"O: Overall this is a solid barley wine, one that ages well and is drinking very well right now at about four years in."
"o - overall nice example of an english barleywine. pretty even tempered but i like a bit more of a kick and thickness to an english barleywine. pretty non-offensive and nice gateway english barleywine."
"I've never had cereal killer fresh but aged 4 years, this beer is absolutely perfect. Amazing mouthfeel with one of the most balanced, robust, and pleasantly malty flavor profiles of any barleywine. Really a joy. Thanks again Mike!"
"Pours a very hazy moderate brown collar with a thin collar. A few bubbles on the sides of the glass forming a very thin collar. The nose brings a bit of caramel and toffee plus some light bread and malt sweetness. Flavor has some caramel and light cherry plus brown-sugar sweetness. Medium body with low carbonation and a pleasing sweetness in the finish. Pretty good overall."
"Cheers!"
"Bottle courtesy of wbc. This beer pours a reddish, very cloudy, copper in color with a light off white head. It smells of biscuity malts, molasses, honey, and has a berry sweetness to it. It's odd and too sweet. It tastes of sweet malt, honey, and molasses. It's far too sweet for my liking. It drinks light and isn't overly sticky, which is surprising considering the amount of sugar you get from this beer. Overall, this beer didn't bring anything notable to the table. It was average and overly sweet."
"O - Really enjoyable. Can't say it's amazing (could use more character, maybe too drinkable), but pretty perfect for winter nights or when you're wishing for them."
"Overall: It's a good barleywine, with the malts and bite of alcohol. However, it's a little heavy for summertime, and would be much better suited during winter."
"A solid barleywine to be sure, I think this would probably benefit from some age. While I definitely think the flavor would become more complex with age, the body is already on the thin end of the barleywine spectrum, so I would worry about it becoming even thinner. Still, I think that 3 to 5 years out this could be a fantastic beverage."
"Warming to the palate, full in body, not much carbonation. Very boozy."
"O: It's not bad, but I don't think that it is a very strong representation of the style."
"Rich amber color, almost copper in hue with a nice touch of cloudiness to it that really gave it a very thick look, nearly opaque at times. No real head though, and it almost looked flat at first pour, not really encouraged right off the bat. The aroma was rich and sweet. Nice notes of bready malts, hints of almost honey like notes and a nice fruit touch toward the finish. The flavor though really perked me up a bit. Sweet, mellow, with all notes of ABV long gone by the wayside. Lots of biscuit like notes, a touch of faded hops and a load of grain all combined to really give quite a nice show overall. Very impressed here with the way it tasted, especially in the finish, which was again very sweet, and nearly perfectly placed. An easy sipper I almost went through this one too quickly as it had mellowed to the point of being equally rich and subtle."
"O - to me, this is a fantastic barleywine. probably a little pricey ($4/bottle - didn't realize it until I was checking out) but I think this will be one I go for again."
"O: Pretty good, not overly thick and easy drinking for 10%. Have not had it fresh, but certainly a beer that ages well."
"not much changed. sort of an off aftertaste. not as syrupy as before."
"The best way I can describe it is liquid Frosted Flakes in taste. Seriously, this is a delicious barleywine that is deceptive in its alcohol content. I had this beer in a half-pint glass at Arcadia's pub in Battle Creek, Michigan, and I was very impressed. A lovely deep orange beer, it is super-sweet and delicious, with a great mouthfeel and overall experience. Highly recommended."
"D: An easy drinking barleywine for its abv, yet it is still a barleywine. 1 or 2 is usually the norm. Great flavor from the malts and yeast, but it remains a one and done type of beer."
"Sweeter than the smell indicates, although the finish is dry. Playing second fiddle is the light hop and mild alcohol warmth. The body is similar to a typical barleywine."
"D-Hot, but not as bad as some hot beers"
"I will definitely make this beer an annual winter drinking experience."
"Just a cloying and sweet mess. Not one of Arcadia's better offerings. Arcadia's Big Dick's Olde Ale is one that is superior in just about every way. I would not recommend this."
"Drinkability: This is a very enjoyable beer, but I do feel that I need to find a fresh one at some point to make sure the drinkability is there for this one in general, or if it takes this much time to get to this point in being drinkable. Wonderfully sweet and well balanced flavors and a very robust nose make this one very enticing, but the ABV will definitely take a toll at 10%. Great for a cold night such as this, but not something I'd tackle in the warmer months."
"D/O- Not a bad barleywine. Doesn't hid the the alcohol too great but that's okay. Drinkability suffers per usul with the style. Was actually pleasantly surprised with this offering due to its $5 price. Would buy again at the price point."
"D: All night if I had more. Yeah it's high but this one is fantastic if you can find a 2006."
"Age has been kind to this one as it comes across as rich and leaning more towards the English side of barleywines. Sweet and doughy, good blend of fruit and finishing bitterness. Nice brew, straightforward and has plenty of flavor."
"Flavor is complex, but again, not overwhelming. Sweetness throughout, fruit (raisin? plum?) pervade. Extremely smooth. Arcadia, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship."
"D/M: Its a very heavy beer that coats the palate. Great creamy head and texture that really brings out the flavors. I was able to find a bottle from 2008 which probably made it a little stronger."
"D - This is a fine example of an English style barley wine. With its strength and richness you only want one, but that one is very nice."
"My bottle was a 2008 vintage."
"D- meh, im not sure if id be that quick to go out and grab any more of these. not the worst beer ive ever had, but in a style that i consider to be one of my favorites, this one ranks pretty low."
"Drinkability: Arcadia's Cereal Killer is a very drinkable beer considering how strong it is. The great taste and pleasant mouthfeel certainly add to the drinkability. I would certainly have this one again."
"Mouthfeel: Light carbonation."
"Pours a deep copper to amber color with a light tan head. In the aroma, dark fruit, fig, plum, and alcohol. In the taste, raisin, fig, licorice, and a small alcohol presence. A smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a semi dry fig and raisin like aftertaste. Hides alcohol somewhat, nice dry fruit presence and quite smooth."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, strong kick, good representation of style, it might not be the best EBW out there but it's still a very solid beer that is drinking for a while and also worth cellaring for a while."
"drinks well. booze is present, but not overbearing. sweetness is there too, as well as some hoppiness, but everything remains in balance quite nicely. Not my favorite, but a solid, solid representation of a balance between english-style barleywines and their hopped-up american relatives."
"M- Full, smooth and soft."
"Enjoyable brew. Not one that you could drink a 6-pack of obviously, but one you could enjoy one or two of at a sitting. Great flavors and decent overall experience."
"Overall, a decent barleywine, but not among my favorites in this style."
"Overall, I loved it and I think I might have to get another."
"Nothing to complain about with this one, as long as you keep in mind this is an English, not an American Barleywine."
"Pours a clear, dark amber color. 1/3 inch head of a pale tan color. Decent retention and poor lacing. Smells of alcohol, sweet malt, dark citrus, and slight hop. Fits the style of an English Barleywine. Mouth feel is slightly smooth and savory. Average carbonation level. Tastes of alcohol, sweet malt, dark citrus, hops, slight tartness, and a wood flavor. Overall, good body and blend, with a great mouth feel."
"D: nice balance, very malt forward, rich- difficult to make it through a glass. Nothing about this beer really stood out for me."
"D: Either it became less drinkable as it warmed, or I just started to get tired of it, but by the end of the 12 oz. it was not nearly as good as at the start."
"Overall, this is a pretty average barleywine. Not too much to it. Don't think I'd go for this one again with such better options out there."
"The high 10% abv keeps this from being any kind of a guzzling beer, but I found it quite enjoyable one sip at a time."
"Notes: not sure of the vintage of this bottle. My guess is that it's been in my cellar for a couple years, which would make it an '08 or, more likely, an '07. . . . It aged fairly well; a nice sipper. . . ."
"All in all, this was a very good brew. Glad I got to try it. Interesting for an English barleywine. Could cross styles with an old ale. Definitely try if you like malty big beers."
"F: Semi sweet finish with the syrupy taste and feel lingering a bit. Not bad but a little on the sweet side. Also somewhat bitter and earthy. The syrupy maple and brown sugar flavors seem to stick around for a while, and the hops just add a slight touch of bitterness. It almost has a velvety mouth and finish which adds a really nice touch. This is actually better than I thought for a beer."
"D - Ya I am glad I didn't buy more than a bottle of this, just really different and not in a good way, have no clue what that bitterness is but it sucks. The carbonation is unappealing too."
"A deep dark red color pour with a big lasting fluffy white head leaving lots of sticky lacing , medium carbonation . Aroma of dark caramel , rasins , molasis, spicy hops and maybe cherries. Flavor is of sweet brown shugar , caramel , molasis,spicy floral hops, dates,rasins ,wood ,light alcohaol in the tail end , nice warming effect . Full body with a thick creamy mouthfeel , medium level of bitterness long sweet finish . Quite drinkable and went down good dispite the sweetness . A very good offering from a great brewery Nice ."
"D-good but not really drikable with its high abv and not very well hidden alcohol presence but i could still have a few of these in a sitting"
"D- Nice malty, English barleywine. Great sipping beer to go with a nice blue cheese."
"D-doesn't have the complexity I would have like to see; but big bold flavors that are blended very well together. The alcohol is a little too present in the middle; but not overpoweringly so."
"I could drink the rest of this bomber, then it is time for a milder beer. The sweetness is sure to get to me."
"Notes: the aroma is very enticing but the flavor seemed to lack a little even for an English style. still decent though"
"(D)- This is perhaps too old. Nothing is really impressing me about it. At this stage, its just syrupy boozy burnt raisins & figs. I will certainly re-review this when I find one in better condition & fresher."
"Overall, this is a different take to a barleywine than what I had become acquainted with. It's maltier, more bitter, and has a much sharper, more pointed aftertaste. A definite try, but not one of my most favorites in the category."
"D- Sooo happy that this isn't nearly the disappointment I thought it would be based on others reviews. It works OK for the style. I would definitely say it's a slightly better than passable English barleywine."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and creamy. Good carbonation and not overly heavy or syrupy at all which is nice. This is definitely a malt bomb and fits the English Barleywine category quite well. I think the age has worked nicely on this one too. A tasty, deep fruity barleywine worth checking out."
"Overall: The mouth feel is warming, smooth, and chewy. The body of the beer is thick and the finish is medium. This beer is awesome. The age on it gave away to fantastic tasting barleywine. The flavor profiles are complex but simple. The alcohol is warming and not harsh this beer is wonderful."
"drinkability - not good BW#2 drain pour of the night"
"Conclusion: This is definitely one of the better English-style Barleywines I've had (which I generally prefer to their American-style counterparts). This is wonderfully balanced, rich, and makes a great cold weather, late-night beer. Split with the Old Man after cellaring for a year or so."
"I will not be going back to try this beer again."
"This beer is sweet with a dry finish, and somehow syrupy as well. Honestly reminds me of my home brew when i used all extract. Like cheap champ this beer has its time and place. Like Candyman it's forgettable."
"I go through trends of sticking to certain styles depending on the time of year, and in this case, it has all been about hoppy beers and Barleywines. This one I poured in to a weiss glass (not the right style, but whatever). Color is definitely good, it is a light cherry toward the bottom, and gets darker towards the top of the glass. Almost immediately upon pouring I could smell it from a few feet away. Dark fruits such as cherry and berry strike me first, along with some chocolate and alcohol. Honey manages to creep its way in as well....reminds me a bit of a cherry cordial. Taste is very sweet, and not afraid to flex it's alcohol strength. I get some honey and fruit nectar, and a tiny amount of molasses or caramel in the finish. Body is big, viscous and in your face. Drinkability is nice, however be warned that this is a sipping beer for sure that should probably be paired with food. I have only had four or five sips from my glass, and can already feel the strength of this beer. I like this Barleywine. Not one of the best I have ever tried, but I would certainly recommend it to anybody who sees it in their area. Cheers"
"Ultimately, I'm not completely sold on this. It's just a little too thick and sweet and feels unbalanced, with the hops too far in the background to really integrate with the flavors. It's definitely delicious and lip-smacking, and would be a great beer to share with others on a cool evening. I think it would match spectacularly with some warm bread and cheese - which, unfortunately, I didn't have on hand."
"Not very eay to drink at all its very much a sipper. Just to sweet"
"I would like to try a fresh one so I can judge the changes it has made. With a couple of years it has definitely sweetened up and dulled the hop profile. Good but I doubt I'll age another one."
"Pours deep amber with a thin off-white head that drops to no lacing. Aroma is syrupy and malty. Flavor is overripe and sweet with strong but indistinct hops. Raisin, plum, sourness and toffee. Mouthfeel very thick and gooey. The finish is quite heavy and sour. Feel like I need to brush my teeth."
"Still pretty boozy. Could use some more aging."
"It was the perfect beer to end on. It pairs very well with dried dates."
"D: Suggary sweet and often unbalanced. Would have liked a little more malt charachter or a touch less sugar to balance out the flavors."
"2008 vintage. This poured a nearly opaque dark garnet with moderate tan head. It smelled like dark fruit (fig and raisin and prune) with honey wheat and roasted barley and some molasses. It tasted like raisins and prunes and honey wheat, with copper hops and caramel and molasses malts. It was fairly thick with a bit of carbonation, and had a bittersweet aftertaste. Overall this had a very deep, rich flavor and great body. I could already really sense age on this beer with only 1 year on it, and I could foresee it continuing to improve for another year or two. Nice clean flavors that were balanced quite well and hid the alcohol nicely, so this was easy to drink but much better to sip. Well done!"
"This is a great beer, and a great barley wine, tons of flavor and aroma offerings, and an extremely nice alcohol warmth. This is a winner."
"Drinks like a barleywine usually does. It's a sipper, but a tastey one."
"D: A very nice English barley wine that might benefit from another year or two in the cellar. Solid nonetheless and firmly on the sweet end of the barleywine spectrum."
"Dranks alright, but flavor profiles are all a bit shallow. Not bad, but not as good as other Arcadia offerings IMO"
" of emphasis on sugar. Really quite good."
"A 22 ounce bomber bottle, 2006 vintage, shared with psycohops. Poured into an Adnams pint glass, the barley wine appears something akin to murky, freshly brewed iced tea with a finger of light ecru foam. The foam settles to a thin layer within a few minutes. Flavor and nose consists of rather sweet smelling brown sugar, very fruity - figs, dates, dark cherries, still a touch of alcohol making it a tad boozy. Ample carbonation and not as sweet tasting as the nose would suggest. The flavor drops off almost instantly upon each swallow. Rather smooth with a light finish. We paired this with some Cabot Hunter's Seriously Sharp Cheddar."
"I don't know if this one is drinkable or not. I'm leaning towards not. I've got another bottle downstairs, which I'll open soon. If it's any different, I'll amend this review."
"Mouthfeel is burnt chocolate, malty, kind of funky, time for some water. Drinkability is average. First beer from Arcadia, I had hoped for a better beer. This barleywine is acceptable, but by no means is this a great beer."
"Poured a deep copper with a big rocky tannish head. Great carbonation. Nose is cocoa, toffee, caramel. Taste is toffee, cocoa, caramel with a finish cocoa, maybe like bakers powder cocoa. Mouthfeel is nice not to heavy on alcohol, brown dugar, cocoa. Drinkability is good."
"Drinkability is OK. I've found that since I am a hophead, I prefer American barleywines to their English cousins. However, this was a good representation of the style."
"The beer pours a dark brown color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great! It has a warm, burnt toffee scent that boasts of pale and caramel malts boiled down to darken the color and intensify the malt character. The taste is good. It has a very rich, malty flavor that screams burnt toffee and low hops. It's slow going down with a nice warmth in the finish. The mouthfeel is good as well. It is a FULL bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a powerful beer with loads of flavor. I'm a big fan of the malt content. Burnt toffee is like mothers milk."
"Not bad. I was pleasantly surprised. I actually liked this one. I would certainly recommend if one enjoys the maltier, earthier style."
"A deep copper caramel color, thick and hazy with a decent oatmeal colored head and great lacing. The aroma is nutty red wine and deep malt earthiness, full and a bit sweet. The flavor is a strikingly sweet, thick grapey malt with more nuttiness. Amazingly syrupy sweet, more than I like but still a tastey treat. Full bodied, not a session beer I would say. I pick up some maple and brown sugar. Mellows as it sits but still brings a tart overtone, pretty heavy duty with medium alcohol."
"D: the definition of a sipper"
"Pours a two finger yellow/brown head that leaves a little lace. Cloudy amber color. Malty/alcohol nose. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Flavor is caramel and some alcohol. Late bakers chocolate after taste. Warming. Cheaper and better than Shipyard's barleywine, $9.20 for a 22 oz bottle from Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, Me. 2008 vintage."
"Overall: A very good Barleywine, but seemed more like a blended American and English instead of a true English Barleywine. The hops flavor was a decent surprise, but not what I was expecting."
"Bomber, picked up while visiting Ann Arbor, MI. pours clear amber with inch and a half tan head. It has a citrus hard candy aroma, cherry candies and raisins. The taste has that same fruity hard candy noted in the nose with sweet citrus, cherry and grapes. Then an undercurrent of mild caramel sweetness runs right up to the finish and into the aftertaste."
"D: Probably more bitter than your typical english barleywine, but not as bitter as an American style. A nice sipper, not a booze bomb at only 9%, goes down pretty smooth"
"Drinkability is relatively high. The flavor profile is pleasant and the alcohol is in check making for an easy to consume barleywine. Not a bad effort."
"D: May smooth with aging. The malt flavors are good but the hop bitterness is not rich enough and does not quite blended well at this time."
"Tastes potent malt sweet with strong hop flavor, some alcohol sting, and moderate hop bitter. Malt falvor is toffee, chocolate, and biscuity. Hop flavor is so potent it comes across as sour. Oranges, pine, orange pith, and tangerine. Bitter is mild and clear of cohumulone edginess. Esters are thick and heavy. Raisin, fig, tamarind, and a dash of cherry. A decent beer, but too sweet persistent. I suspect this would improve with a couple years in the cellar. Super thick mouthfeel...sticky. Moderate carbonation."
"Oh no. No no no. Please tell me this wasn't classified as a Barleywine. That's an insult to the category. Aroma is boozy and fruity, trying really hard to be estery but falling well short. Palate is far from substantial. Flavor is of simple syrup (and lots of it), a dollop of caramel, and a splash of Hawaiian Punch. As for hops, well, they're there, but not in any kind of force. They certainly don't contribute much to the aroma. Two redeeming factors of this beer: 1) it LOOKS like a barleywine, and 2) I didn't have to pay for it."
"Served in a snifter, the beer was a red amber color with a medium tan head that provided some lacing. It had a caramel apple aroma. Similar taste: caramel, apple, some hops. The alcohol was well-hidden. Creamy mouthfeel. Not too aggressive, a good example of an English barleywine."
"Beautiful. Nice head, maybe a bit quick for the lacing to go away. Wonderful EB smell - prunes, alcohol, light apricots, sweet malts. It's funny, though... It's called and English BW and that fits, some. Of course, it could also be an American BW and that would fit some. The problem is that it isn't either of those. It's too sweet and syrupy (not that it's sweet and syrupy) to be American and too hoppy and bitter (not that it's hoppy and bitter) to be English. All things considered, it's probably better off in English because of the aroma and the near syrupy sweetness. I'd like it more less sweet and more bitter. Um. More American. It would score better in its style if it were less hoppy."
"D: Drinks really nice and smooth for a barleywine. Great drinkability, worthy of a recommend and future purchases."
"Notes from 2/21/07"
"Drinkability: I'm not always a fan of English-style barleywines, but this one is quite good. Worth a try, and at $7.99 a bomber the price is right."
"Overall, if you like malt, give it a try."
"on my taste buds like no other. This beer was very malty and strong in alcohol."
"On the other hand, it's also smooth and accessible. This is good barleywine, shortcomings though there are. This could do with a good cellaring."
"I liked this barleywine alot. Maybe because i drank it outside during a cold and rainy day. Still, it's sweet and powerful and makes for a good nightcap or as a dessertbeer on its own. Recommended!"
"This barleywine poured a murky brown with a bubbly, tan head. The nose was fairly light, with only traces of raisins and dates. The beer tasted of brown sugar, toasted bread, raisins, dates and a bit of lemon. The beer was a bit fizzy, but overall was a decent representation of a barleywine."
"drinkability: iffy"
"Drinkability is OK, this is a tasty, but too overly sweet. A decent take on a English BW, and I'm happy to enjoy it...but not enough to move back to the dirty coast! Not a bad price either, but also something that a non BW drinker would probably call icky - I can't wait to brush my teeth!"
"This is one Michigan barleywine to please anyones' palate. Nice one, but one is about all anyone can handle."
"Cereal Killer Barley Wine (a great name) is surprisingly delicious. Going with the theory that it might have had more power and presence when young, I will try to find a fresh bottle. I have to say, though, it's damn good aged."
"D - Ok beer, average, not that impressed."
"Dark brown colored ale with a one inch light brown head.Aroma is alcohol and fruit.Taste is sugar,more sugar,fruit and alcohol.This is my first Barley Wine and I was not overly impressed.A person could go into a diabetic coma if you drink more than one.This ale was not horrible but it is not something I would seek out anytime in the future."
"This is a decent Barleywine but it's nothing I'm going to get exited about. I felt the hops were a little tame or the style and the candy flavor just seemed off. It's not bad, but it's nothing spectacular either. According to the lable it's a 2007 vintage. Judging by the flavor, I would say it's early 2007 giving it more than a year. This one is probably best enjoyed fresh."
"I throughly enjoy this brew. This will be added to the Cellar fairly soon as I would love to taste an aged version of this great brew."
"Drinkability - this is an excellent ale, and only its high abv limits its sessionability."
"Some seemed to like it, so chalk it up to personal taste I guess, but I didn't feel like the flavors in this one were in order. Too much alcohol and too much buttery sweetness."
"This is okay, just too damn sweet and syrupy...could've used more balance. I like sweet beers, but they need to have more depth than this. Again I'll say: Barleywines are like pizza and sex--even when it's bad, it's good. And Cereal Killer is somewhere between good and bad. Love the name though!"
"Thanks, Vancer, for the opportunity"
"D,notes: I wouldn't call this beer particularly drinkable. Decent but not great."
"Wouldn't recommend this one..."
"Overall A very nice BarleyWine I'll enjoy more of."
"As a barley wine, I'm enjoying this. As an English barley wine, I'm enjoying it even more. Well worth trying."
"D: You feel the alcohol after just a few sips - it certainly doesn't hide that well. Enough flavor and character to warrant a second pour but that might just be the wintry blast outside making me want it."
"Tastes similar to the nose (caramel malts, fruits citric hops) with the alcohol coming through to warm my cheeks."
"-Oelergud"
"d: Overall, this is a decent barleywine, but I doubt that I'll seek this out again."
"Pours a cola brown with an off white head. Aromas of brown sugar/molasses, dark fruits, malt and booze. Tastes as it smells. Picked up flavors of plums, vanilla, unsweetened chocolate, and some citrus. The 10% is hidden well enough. Mouth feel is creamy and coating. Drinkability for this one is, a good cold weather sipper. Recommended!"
"D- This is what I think of as an American Barleywine. Big sweet malty flavor, even though it is a bit one dimensional followed by a big pungent hop punch that finishes it. The hops really balance the malt sweetness and the alcohol really supports the hops."
"Ugh. What a mess. Ugly flavors all over. I wasn't impressed with Arcadia the last time I tried their line-up a few years ago, and it seems they still haven't figured out how to brew a good beer since then. I was hoping this 'Big Beer Series' might prove me wrong. It didn't."
"This is a wonderful American-style interpretation of an English-style barleywine."
"Thepalate is warm, heavy, with a smallyet perect lingering warmth. Great for sipping on a winter evening."
"Really nice garnet-amber color, with a nice but small white head. Head fades fast. Aroma is sweet malt and hot alcohol. No apparent hops. Flavor is very sweet upfront, followed by more fusel alcohols, coming across as very solvent like. Finish is bitter alcohol and some sweet malt. Body is full and smooth."
"*Silver metal for Barleywine Ale at '07 GABF."
"Last swigs: Cherry vanilla soda like with an Earthy oaky subtleness."
"Overall: Like the name and reference to its hometown roots. It does a have cereal quality in both nose and taste which is interesting. It's not the best Barley wine in the world, but it's New Years Eve and I am enjoying the hell out of this one."
"Bottle. Poured a cloudy purplish-brown color with a medium almond head. Strong lacing. Aroma is really sweet with a caramel and fruit scent to it, with a bit of hops. Nice mouthfeel. Flavor is disappointing. Too sweet for my liking. Very fruity and not hoppy enough for my liking. Very sugary. Probably my least favorite of the Arcadia ""big beers."""
"Good name to pick for a Battle Creek beer. This beer poured a clear deep red color and formed a light tan bubbly head that coated the glass with lace as it subsided. A medium amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of malt, caramel and dark fruit. The flavor is of malt, dark fruit with a hint of the alcohol present. It has a medium body with a slightly astrigent, yet bittersweet finish. It would probably improve with some aging."
"D: Quite drinkable given the strength. Best beer I've had from them in years."
"Cheers"
"Pretty tasty, but too sweet."
"A dark brown carmel kissed body, with negligable head and spotty lacing. Smells kind of heady, with alcohol and molassas predominate. Taste is all malt and sugar. Way too sweet for me. Mouthfeel is smooth, but borderline watery and thin. I had a glass, but that's it. The alcohol and the sugar make this one a sipper, and a fairly unenjoyable one at that. Perhaps I've just been spoiled by Old Ruffian and Old Guardian. I've not had many barleywines that can stand up to them."
"I am not 100 percent sure how I feel about this beer. I think I will have to try it again some time in the future."
"Bomber pours a hazy caramel hued body with a small beige head that quickly falls to a cap with spotty lacing. Aroma is scorched caramel and green apples. Medium body with low carbonation and a somewhat syrupy mouthfeel. Taste is very malty, with waves of sticky caramel complimented by brown sugar, dark fruits, red apples, and definite alcohol wamth. A hint of grassy hops at the finish. This one would probably be better with a few more months of age."
"D - Pretty good. A very earthy, mossy, whiskey flavor. I might have this again. It is a very interesting barleywine for sure."
"Certainly a English-style BarleyWine, but quite well balanced and enjoyable. Very easy going down."
"Deep dark in color-very rich and full looking. Nice tight head on top. Good aroma of fried fruits and a mellow sweetness. Thick and malty flavor dominates. More straight malt then anything. Notes of currants and figs. Somewhat musty and dry tasting. Decent body-I was expecting more residual sweetness. Overall a good beer. Theres plenty better out there though I wouldnt sniff at this one."
"Poured into a chalice a nice dark amber color, nice carbonation, nice small creamy tannish head, tons of sticky lacing and islands throughout the drink. The nose is malty, some prunes/figs/raisins, and a good dose of caramel. The tasty is malty, with a good dose of dark fruit and caramel. The alcohol is hidden pretty well. Medium body, a well rounded, complex brew. Very drinkable, a nice english barleywine, highly recommended."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1 1/2"" tan head over the cloudy reddish brown brew. Frothy head lasts nicely, with heavy lacing. Aroma is sweet and fruity. Flavor is malty upfront, fruity and tart in the middle, and closes with a shot of hops and lingering warmth. Mouthfeel is very smooth and easy over the tongue, and drinkability is excellent for the style. Worth searching out, for sure."
"Another tremendous beer from Arcadia. They are hitting home-runs all over the place with their Big Beer Series. The brew opens with a deep, viscous pour of dark mohogany colors, ruby highlights, and a 1"" foamstand that lasts the duration of the session. Big, bold aromas of dark, dehydrated fruits and a heafty dosage of molassas and brown sugar. Light fermentables and sweet alcohols wrap up the scent. Tastes very boldly sweet with fruits (raisons, prunes, berries, plumbs, dates) and heavy maltiness that tips on the side of artificail flavors (molassas, brown sugar, maple syrup). All wrapped up in a warming, sweet alcohol flavor. Heavy on the bread, toast flavors but not roasted. Hopped for balance, but not for aroma, and hardly for flavor. Feels heavy and moderately cloying. Very rich and robust throughout. Quite syrupy, but not wort-y; truely malty. Astringenies are light and are only noticalbe going into the aftertaste. Lingers with a brown sugar sweetness and mild astringent bite. Very good brew."
"Overall: I like Arcadia's attempt at the style, and I think my experience with this style of beer might be unfairly penalizing it, as it's up against some of the heavy-weights from Britain in my mind. While it's not up to that level, I do quite enjoy this offering, and I will definitely be purchasing it again."
"Black with a bit of white head. Roast in aroma with various oatmeal, barley, complex aroma. Medium mouthfeel that was nicely malted adding to drinkability. Some licorice and mollasses and chocolate malt.An enjoyable barleywine that had depth and taste and one I would not hesitate to ahve again.. Malts: Rahr Pilsner, Crisp Crystal, Crisp Munich. Hops: Northern Brewer and Crystal"
"Not going to make it to the bottom of this 22oz'er."
"Drinkability - an above average beer in the world of beers, but not so much in the barleywine category. Maybe some age would help this one blossom."
"Drinkability: While never overly complex, I found it to be quite nice, quite drinkable, and it really delivered when I was looking for a beer with a lil' ""kick"" to it."
"Overall one of the best barleywines I have tried. I prefer the English style to the American style, and this beer didn't disappoint. I wish I could find this beer closer to home. I would definitely get more!"
"First sip reveals an average body with slight syrupy texture and very fine gentle carbonation. Flavor is as expected from nose. All sweet malt with brown sugar, molasses, red grape and raisins mixing nicely. No hint of booze or hops to be found. I like this malt lovers brew and find it extremely drinkable for the 10%. Quite a nice brew."
"D - This is a very good beer. Despite the high alcohol content it wasn't too powerful."
"650ml bomber, very neat label. Pours a sludgy bright ruby in colour. Good head, ample and sturdy, majority of which stays. Aroma of amber malts with a candy like note. Almost vinous in some ways. Aggressive carbonation leaves a slight sting. An unusual fruity malt. A lot of cherry! Alcohol not in the taste, but certainly holds some presence. The only thing they couldn't do is capture right the barley-wine equation: that is to say its strength far outweighs its depth. Not what I expected and definitely distinct in it's own right."
"Drinkability is terrible. This beer would be better suited to a shot glass. A total swing-and-a-miss. I can't believe someone at Arcadia green-lighted this beer, any positive characteristics are totally destroyed by the ridiculous alcohol flavor. Back to the drawing board."
"Thanks for sharing this biegaman!"
"Pours a clear red/brown, thick tan head, very nice looking, decent lacing. Smell is sweet, very fruity, yeasty, grapey wine, bread, very malty, bit of citrus. Taste is malty, some caramel, very fruity again, citrus/floral hops, figs, more fruit in the finish, bit of bread and alcohol. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low to medium carb. Nice sipper, doesn't really project the 10% ABV. Thanks Jan!"
"This is similar to a local brewer's barley wine (J.T. Whitney's) but not quite as tasty or strong. Well put together, but not very bold. Price was right, and the bottle was big!"
"12-12-07 update - I stand behind how good this one tastes. This is more a cellaring update. I had 2 more bottles in the cellar for future enjoyment. One developed an infection on par with leaving an open bottle with beer on the counter for a week or two. Disgusting and apparently not necessarily an isolated occurance. I drank my other bottle last night and it was perfect. The moral of this update - cellar at your own risk. Drink recent from the store and check the bottles before you buy."
"I prefer Arcadia's Hopmouth DIPA over this. Still, it's a decent choice for a barleywine. You could really do worse, yet you can do much better, too."
"Poured into an impy pint glass a darker shade of brown with some dark orange tint a craterouslight brown one finger head atop that settles quickly into a creamy-like mass.Big caramel notes when the bottle was first popped open fruity esters began to settle in after a bit as well as some engraned brown sugar hops peak thru with a hint of herbalness.A somewhat sharp mouthfeel stings a little at first seems a bit fizzy,the mouthfeel takes away from the flavor a bit in my book its malt tilted no doubt caramel and borwn sugar sweetness dominate the alcohol shows itslf no doubt with a finishing burn honestly I dont pick up alot of hop presence other than a hint of herb in the finish.It started out promising but seed to fizzle out a bit no pun intended still not all bad."
"The body is not as full as I would expect. Nice light carbonation. Not too sticky sweet, but a perfect balance of bitter. One of the more easily drinkable barleywines I've had. Definitely the best ""English"" barleywine I've had, though I would hesitate to label it as either British or American, but rather a good balance between the two."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, chewy, sweet, with fruit, and caramel breadiness running along the palate."
"Clear and dark amber starts this one off, a smallish ivory head caps it. IÂ’m a bit bummed by the aroma Â– only weak caramel malts pop up. None of the classic BW aromas. Taste also lets me down, with the sharp hoppy finish, reminds me more of an IPA than BW. Medium bodied brew, I donÂ’t think IÂ’ll seek out another bomber Â– too many better BWs out there."
"Cheers!"
"D: The alcohol betrays itself but not to the 10% level. I'll have a glass or two tonight but not much more as the malts are not for pounding."
"M&D - semi-smooth, not very drinkable, sweet an easy down, but not the easiest, kinda bitter"
"Pours a clear deep dark mahogony with a large tan foamy head. A good looking brew with a large head for a b/w. The smell has roasted malt,alcohol,dark fruit, and a ""bisquity' aroma,but this isn't all that pungent. The taste is hoppy with dark fruit, alcohol, and bread yeast. This combination works making this a very tasty beer. The m/f is medium with all the flavors mixing very well. A real nice surprise. I haven't found too many beers by Arcadia that I like,but this is one for the books."
"Deep brown in color; clumsy off-white head that forms decent, patchy lacing. The nose contains caramel malts, dark fruits and plums; later revealed are some nice biscuity notes and traces of warming alcohol. Big and bold up front with massive flavoring--dark caramel malts, cherries, raisins and raisins. The body quickly forms some thick, chewy malt and oak tastings. Slender, oily hops and hints of honey roasted peanuts; very sweet and sugary as noted in the 10.0 ABV. One of the tastier barley wines out there, perfect on a cold winter evening. Well done."
"Drinkability: Very nice drinkability factor. It goes down nice and smooth. I will definitely check this one out again."
"Syrupy carmelized sugar flavors are coupled with ripe fig. Notes of chocolate, indicative of a fine port are present in the finish due to the flash of alcohol."
"A medium to thick mouthfeel,slightly cloying. Not interesting enough to want to drink more. Not bad overall,but nothing to get excited about."
"Appears a semi-clouded blood orange juice tone with a nicely formed organic brown egg hued head leaves behind thin scattered specks of lacing. Aroma has a deep tart tone with vinous grapes, raisins, with caramel tinged alcohol notes in there as well. Mild earthy tone hints of brandy with a mild herbal woody hop aroma. Flavor is big and malty like most b-wines not overly sweet with a lot of tartness here big raisin, plum soaked in alcohol notes a bit of earthy bark tones with more herbal hops quite the mellow sipping barleywine. Mouthfeel is in the medium to fuller bodied range with moderate easy going carbonation with a syrupy texture that becomes a bit cloying after a whole bomber. Drinkability is on a I'm one and I'm done basis, I need to move on after one of these big brews."
"Comments - Could be evened out a bit more with hops, although I do enjoy sweeter barley wines. Its worth a try, but not something to go out of your way to find."
"This beer has a very dark mahogany hue to it. Nice big head that eventually fades a lot, but little laces are still present. Big huge predominant fruity nose. Taste is of once again a huge fruit attack (grapes, plums, apples), with a bit of alcohol and a smige of hops at the end. Mouthfeel and drinkability are good. I think this beer is alright, but its too in your face fruit action going on...I wanted some more caramel to come through...possibly with some aging this beer can improve. But as for right now I most likely won't pick this up again in the near future."
"Couldn't drink a bunch of this, but it would be fun to try."
"btw, the name is too cute, and the label art interesting..hmmm, the spoon as weapon, gotcha...scratched out Fruit Loops, very funny...but I have to say, it reeks as trying too hard. Maybe too much cleverness is a bad thing. That's my experience, I've got the scars to prove it..."
"Cereal Killer is an excellent barleywine, it is pricy, but you do get what yo pay for. Pours a hazy deep dark amber with reddish streaks shinning through from the light striking through. the aroma is very malty, carmelized malt, slight hint of alcohol. the flavor is very rich and malty, carmelized malt, hopsack, spicy, mineral after-taste. this is a great beer, give it a try."
"Good appearance. Bloodied mahogany. Thick beige head dissipates quickly and leaves little lace behind. Nice aroma of plums, dates, pineapple, caramel malts, and other tropical fruits. Nice viscous feel in the mouth. Full bodied and adequately carbonated. First impressions are of rich malts, fruits and alcohol. Really a pretty nice combo overall. Tropical sensations mix with caramel malts. One of the better Arcadia brews I've had."
"a nice smooth easy drinking Bwine, nothing overly special but worth checking out if you see it."
"Drinkability: so-so. This brew is a bit on the sweet side and needs a bit more bitterness to balance it out. Alcohol sticks out too."
"Pretty solid barleywine."
"This beer hides the ABV well, which is its best feature. Perhaps I'm just unfamilar with the English-styled barley wines, but I expected more from Arcadia here. Probably won't spend the $8 for this one again."
"Overall, a mellow fun drinking barleywine style ale. Starts off smooth and the bite creeps in nicely on the finish. Yeah!"
"This beer just came with a great presentation. The colour is something short of purple with a rich redness bleeding out at the edges. The most astonishing feature is the hearty and steadfast head that perches itself atop the glory below. I am generally unaccustomed to seeing such a resilient head on brews of this nature. Nicely coloured in a shade of tan. There are a few streamers of lace left hanging as the consumption activities commence. The nose is commendable in its lack of rotting overtones. As always with my particular nose, I smell appleskins right off the top. Chalky yeast behind it. Dark fruit, black cherry, caramel apple, candy, and a little a little booze float around as well. Way more pungent as it warms up in my sweaty little mit. The taste is, most notably to me, quite sour on the first impression. A fair bit of sweetness to her also. Makes me think much of cherries and caramel. This is dangerously close to reaching the no no land of cloy. It might be. I haven't yet decided. The mouthfeel is slick but sticky. There is a trail left behind as this brew slides down the hatch. This trail provides seconds of additional enjoyment on every sip. Very nice. The drinkability might be slipping now as I am starting to dwell on whether this thing is starting to get its cloy on. The first pint is gone. What will the rest reveal? After pouring the second glass, which has been exposed to ambient temperature for the duration of the first glass, the taste seems quite easy to deal with again. This is a pretty solid brew. It is quite rich. I don't think serial glasses of this are indicated. The aftertaste gets to be a bit overwhelming. Split this bomber and things should go smoothly. Besides, that would be most advocatory of you. This is surely a one cup affair. A pretty good one at that."
"Poured into a chalice. Color is deep mahogany with an awesome looking billowy tan head that dissipates slowly as the glass sits for a while. Smells sweet like brown sugar or bubblegum, which may be the alcohol - there's also some citrus here. Very nice scent - intriguing. Tastes like a lemon flavored bubblegum and finishes sour with slight bitterness. Mouthfeel is Ok, but nothing spectacular - it is a little harsh, but again could be the alcohol. By no means is this a poor beer, actually, it's one of the better Arcadia offerings not quite as good as Hopmouth. Worth a shot."
"Drinkability: A solid BW, a little spendy, but still good."
"Pours a rich mahogany with a substantial head for a beer of this strength. An amazing aroma of cantaloupe and malt. Very nuanced flavor with some esters, thick malt with a support of alcohol. Some fine hop bitterness that shows up at the end, with just a bit of slickness. Full bodied and assertive; I poured half a bomber into a glass, that's about enough for one sitting."
"Tried Arcadia's Big Dick's Olde Ale and this back-to-back. This beer is the better of the two, however, like the former beer there isn't much distinctive character. I would recommend this beer however."
"Cola brown edges around a reddish body. Small, ringy, light khaki head. Mild aroma of caramel, pears, tropical fruit, and herbal hops. Sweet brown sugar and buttery malt up front. Toasted, caramelized edge to it. Stays sweet throughout. Candy apple. Alcohol is noticeable and a bit hot. Slightly astringent hop finish is no match for the sweetness and the heatness. Medium-bodied, with a mellow, flat feel. A very malty sweet, buttery, warming barley wine that gets better as it warms."
"Ok, so this is not quite the cereal that one might expect to pour in their bowl(glass) for a Barleywine, but as an example of the English style, and not the American, which I favor, this is quite solid. Malty rich and favorable for malt lovers alike. Too bad the aroma did nearly nothing for me."
"Pours a ruddy cola brown to dark copper and amber, somewhat murky/cloudy, with a one finger light tan head. Aroma is ripe fruitiness, ripe berries and some alcohol , also some raisiny and caramel aroma. Flavor shows more ripe berry and prune flavor mixed with a sweet malty and caramel breadiness, cereal, followed by a good dose of alcohol mixed with a decent amount of hop bitterness. Medium in body, somewhat sticky sweet although it seems to thin as it sits in the glass, a peppery spiciness cuts the body along with an alcohol and hop dryness in the finish. Nice beer, maybe somewhat hoppy for an english example of a bw, definitely belongs in the big beer series, alcohol is very present throughout."
"This beer pours a dark amber color with a tall head that falls quickly and leaves some lacing on the glass. The aroma is very malty with not much hoppiness. Also some caramel, some toffee. Nice. The flavor is very malty with quite a bit of bitterness, but not much hop flavor. This beer is right up my alley. Lots of caramel and toffee flavors make this very enjoyable. The alcohol is very well hidden by the malt sweetness and it drinks very well. The body is moderate. This has to be one of the better barleywines I've had in a long time."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer is slightly bigger than medium bodied. The beer has a slightly buttery mouthfeel. The beer drinks ok. I probably will not be repeating another session with it."
"Bomber bottle, purchased @ Good ole New Beer in NYC, 2006, vintage info provided, nice to find on a Bwine, not that I put any beer away for more then a few weeks anyway...Pours murky dark honey, bready nose. This is an easy drinking, smooth BWine, rich and thick, full of malty goodness. Nice notes of wood and rum in the long finish. Pleasant, understated, balanced brew, well worth a try, nice after dinner sipper."
"This Barley wine was a little thin and dry. Predominantly a caramel, dried fig approach with toasty, buttery finish. Finish is thin and somewhat bitter."
