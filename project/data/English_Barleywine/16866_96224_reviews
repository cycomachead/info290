"The coffee in the nose overwhelms everything else. The flavor is more balanced. The coffee and brown sugar dominate the flavor but play well together. More flavors kick in adding to the complexity."
""
"Sweetness isn't usually something that Bruery beers lack... but this happens to be one of them. The coffee bitterness goes nicely with the roast, oak and booze but I could use a bit more malt body to balance this one out. Decent but not great."
"Cold brewed coffee smell. Not too sweet. Balanced. No one overt flavor rises above another."

"O:  Overall this beer is pretty intense.  the coffee is a very nice addition to the beer, the complexity is awesome and the flavors are top notch.  the alcohol does start to get a little too forward after a few drinks.  Definitely a sipper as that keeps the alcohol from coming out too much."

"The roasted coffee adds a great finish to the original Mash. Very good!"

"Taste much better than the original, but the coffee was a little strong for my taste. If you're a huge coffee fan this is for you because it tastes like a really strong cup of joe."

"Poured from a bottle into a tulip glass. The color is a copper red with a small tan head. The smell is a little strong on the bourbon side with a hint of Carmel malt. The mouth feel is sweet with a slight bitter finish. The favors are Carmel malts dried fruit and pine. There is a bourbon flavor in this brew but it's not overpowering."

"The base beer is much more subtle.  Everything from the wonderful malts to the barrel work in tandem, but here the coffee overwhelms.  It is just bitter, acrid, coffee grounds in the finish."

"Starts out damn amazing and sadly fades into something less than forgettable... Not sure I'd recommend @ $25. Nice, but kinda harsh flavors and drinkability."

"OVERALL: Pretty good, though not all that special. The coffee is a little dominant in the nose, which slightly hurts the complexity of the regular barreled version, and the feel is still too light and prickly to really support what's going on. An interesting enough beer and a fun set to try, but not something worth writing home about. Really happy to give them a try though, so thanks again claaark13. Always fun!"

"O - So much coffee, it totally dominates the entire beer. A bit one sided for my liking."
""

"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. An interesting variation from the base mash brew. Its deeply complex but the coffee addition is strangely dusty and spoiled but it works to make the brew different. Like mash, this one hardly showcases the barrel aging which is a bit of a disappontment."

"A confounding beer that didn't quite reach expectations. Points for originality, but a too-heavy hand on the coffee pummels whatever else might be interesting in the beer to gone status. Coffee, bourbon, would have really liked to see this creative experiment hit the next level. Still a pretty good beer."
""
""
"overall lovely and impressive!"
""
"O-A really good beer. The coffee was a great addition to Mash. The bottle was already a few months old but it didn't seem like the coffee had faded too much."

"Pours a semi-cloudy amber with a small beige head. Aroma of nice fresh roasted coffee, oak, caramel, bourbon, toasted sugar, and earth. The flavor is mostly the same but doesn’t work on quite the same level. Definitely some warmth to this one. Medium-bodied, with moderate carbonation and a toasty, earthy, warming mouthfeel. Nice barrel-aged coffee barley wine."
""
""
"O: I wasn’t sure what to expect with a coffee BA barleywine, but overall this is a very nice beer. It retains the big complexity and flavors typical of Bruery beers, but eschews the over-the-top sweetness. Perhaps this shows a more mature side of the Bruery."

"The palate opens with a big coffee flavor, earthy, minimally bitter, moderately roasty and moderately fruity. Along with it is the rather disjointed base barleywine that's made much much better with the coffee, with the vanilla and coconut pairing well with the fruit and the caramel working nicely with the chocolate. As with Mash, this beer does feel a little watery on the finish, but again, the coffee makes up for it. Medium in body, lightened in part by the appreciable alcohol content, this beer is moderately carbonated. The finish has a blend of coffee, coconut and booze, and, as mentioned earlier, is a touch watery. Solid stuff."
"M - Medium to full body. Light carbonation."
""
"O: Good beer. This beer is in your face coffee. I appreciate it but many may not. I like The Bruery for their old ales and barleywines. Glad I was able to tick this...thanks mjn."

"M: Big medium leading to full."

"Pours a hazy orange-brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, brown sugar, caramel, coffee bean, and bourbon aromas. Taste is much the same with caramel and coffee flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of woody and roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with a very nice coffee and bourbon presence that makes this beer better than regular Mash in my opinion."

"O - Very nicely done. The blending of the coffee with the original beer's toffee and chocolate notes really elevates it. Had the Mash also. This coffee version is definitely better."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: drinks pretty easy all things considered. The coffee really helps cut down the sweetness of an English Barleywine. It's an exceptional brew."
""

"o - Overall it was to try this and Mash side by side, but this beer is superior to Mash in every way IMO, look aside. I also did as the Bruery suggested and mixed this with M&G...fun, but I think 100% M&G is still the best. Second best was 90/10, 80/20, and so on. The coffee is great in this one; hoping they do more beers with coffee. Glad I have another bottle of this one."

"Bottle into a snifter. Finally got around to opening this. Dark reddish brown in color. I want to call it auburn. Finger of beige foam. Acceptable looking beer. The aroma is loaded with nutty toffee and coffee. Lots of cashew with some almond in there as well. Ample bourbon with restrained brown sugar. I get a little vanilla and chocolate as well. The coffee cuts the rich English Barleywine aroma. The flavor is smooth with an enormous amount of toffee and a balanced nutty coffee profile. Earth abounds. Bourbon is pervasive and alcohol is very well hidden. Again, the coffee cuts the sweetness, making this dangerously drinkable for the ABV and calories. Oak is evident in the bourbon coffee toffee finish. There's some warming, and the beer is sticky and smooth. This beer is really good and it exceeded my expectations. The coffee is balancing and doesn't blast the base beer into oblivion. I hope The Bruery does a coffee stout next year."
"The beer is darker than the standard version, with a quarter inch or so of beige head. Big coffee scents, rich roasted malt, espresso, coffee beans, vanilla, oak, toffee. Smells great. Huge coffee presence, but still balanced. Robust and bold. Alcohol content well disguised. A great beer to sip and savor. I think this is an improvement over the standard Mash, offering more depth of flavor."

"O - Really coffee forward beer barleywine that has a good balance between the sweetness and the coffee"
"Fantastic. If BCBCS had a barleywine brother, this would be it. Delicious beer."
"Thanks again Chris!"
"I was apprehensive of what coffee would do to a barrel aged English barleywine but this just blew me away. I'm a big fan of coffee beers and this is one of the best ones I've ever had. I really enjoyed the base Mash and the addition of coffee makes it stand out. This is well worth a try."
""
"T: Upfront, there's a good amount of earthy coffee, toffee and spicy, earthy hops. Caramel, bourbon, vanilla and some booze sneak in at the finish. I really like this one, but I think I'm one of the few who prefer standard Mash to this. Still, another fantastic beer from The Bruery."

"Overall interesting but not phenomenal, not as good as the original I think, which had a lot more beer character. I like the coffee addition, but again just wish there was more beer profile balance."
"O - Overall I enjoyed this beer but the coffee kind of took away from the base barleywine too much, still a tasty beer."
""
""
"edit: after it warms up quite abit more coffee comes through."
"Beer pours nicely with a full finger head which dissipates into a faint off white collar that sits cleanly against the rim. The beer smells amazing. I love coffee and this is a coffee lovers dream. There is a tickle of caramel and bourbon, but the coffee forward nose is spicy and floral. Tastes very close to the nose. Imagine your best cup of coffee and using caramel and bourbon as your creamer. Mouthfeel is soft and creamy. Exactly how this beer should come across. I can't fault this beer in any way. I'm happy I secured a few more of these. Hoard if you have a chance."

"O: A surprising delight. I didn't expect coffee in a barleywine to be a home run, but in this case, it really accentuates the base beer, taking it to the next level. I will happily enjoy the second bottle of this that I have stashed away."

"O - I'm really impressed with this beer; BCBCS is one of my all-time favorites, and M&G can hang; I opened this, poured a full glass, and sipped about half before ordering an additional four more of these bottles from the Bruery; at around $17, in my opinion, it's worth every penny. If you're a big fan of coffee...that nutty, slightly bitter thing...this is your beer. I have to imagine the BW elements come through after the coffee mellows...probably why the Bruery said, ""best fresh!"""

"Overall: When the Bruery announced this beer I wondered how it would stack up to Abacus (my English Barley-wine standard). I'm liking this coffee infused version. The barrel doesn't feature as much in this one, but the coffee addition and good taste profile work for me. Looking forward to the regular Mash."
