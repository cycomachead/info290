4.12,-2.8,4.25,4,4.25,4,4,"Overall, a fairly good and unique beer. Even though the beer is closer to a DIPA instead of  a barleywine, the beer still manages to have a nice malt presence that turn the hops into the carriers of the fruity notes traditionally found in barleywines. Highly recommend.","HattedClassic","Mar 29, 2015"

4.42,4.2,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"22 ounce bottle into snifter, best after 2/24/2015. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy dark ruby red color with a 2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, brown bread, molasses, light nuttiness, raisin, plum, fig, apple, date, light licorice, herbal, light oak/vanilla, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Incredible aromas with awesome complexity and balance of dark/bready malts, fruity/earthy yeast, and light-moderate oak barrel notes; with great strength. Taste of big caramel, toffee, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, molasses, light nuttiness, raisin, plum, fig, apple, date, vanilla, light licorice, herbal, light oak, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Slight tannic/oak bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, brown bread, molasses, light nuttiness, raisin, plum, fig, apple, date, vanilla, light licorice, herbal, light oak, and yeast/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity and robustness of dark/bready malt, fruity/earthy yeast, and light-moderate oak barrel flavors; with a fantastic malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very smooth, creamy, and lightly slick/sticky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming lingering after the finish. Overall this is an absolutely incredible English barleywine style. All around outstanding complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready malt, fruity/earthy yeast, and light-moderate oak barrel flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. An insanely delicious offering.","superspak","Mar 29, 2015"

4.73,11.6,4.5,4.5,5,4.25,4.75,"Pours a hazy reddish brown with a small, thin off white head. One of the more opaque barleywines I've seen.  Smell is lovely, lemony hops and rich honey, sweet malt and caramel, subtle earth tones. You can really smell the age, and history that this beer has. Taste is absolutely sublime, perfectly complex and robust, but with no overwhelmingly distracting flavors.  Brown sugar, bitter chocolate, fig, plum, some notes of aged Tawny Port. Myriad of different flavors to enjoy that subtly change as the beer warms. Feel is full bodied, low carbonation: slick and smooth, but not super sticky. No booziness but some subtle warmth in the gut. Overall, this is absolutely fantastic, the qualities all combine to give this an ancient and timeless presence. One of my new favorites and worth the wait to cellar.","Samuel906","Mar 14, 2015"

The color was very pretty, a very deep ruby brown, opaque, with a nice beige head. It was a full bodied beer with a heavy mouthfeel that left it sticky. The taste was plums, raisins, cherries, vanilla, dark brown sugar, wine, chocolate and a little booze, but it's wine so whatever, right? This is a big complex barleywine that's just begging to be explored, and luckily it's delicious so you'll want to. Incredible now but I imagine it will benefit nicely from additional aging.","BrewChatKen","Oct 28, 2014"

Aroma and flavor mirror each other; bready and veering towards doughy, red wine tannins and its barrel, caramel and some caramelized pitted dark fruits  mixed with some brown sugar. Medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, I really am not a barleywine fan but I had to give this a try given the rave reviews it has. Plus,I was able to try it on tap and didn't have to commit to a full bottle. Ultimately, not really my thing but a good beer for what it is. I will stick with Firestone Walkers Sucuba if I ever have a craving for another barleywine. At the least I prefer the use of bourbon barrel over wine barrel when paired with a barleywine.","denver10","Oct 04, 2014"

Ale pouts a thick brown molasses color with off white foam that has very light clinging lacing. Nose of raisin, plum, caramel, sweet cherries, and light oak. Taste....WOW...I have been looking FOR YOU! Sweet caramel notes up front, golden raisins, and brown sugar to the back with a plum and brandy like quality on the aftertaste. FANTASTIC. Nice silk smooth, yet lightly syrupy mouthfeel, with easy drinkability makes this one beast of a great brew. CHEERS. I have FINALLY found a decent substitute for Thomas Hardy's...reminiscent of some of the early 90's Thomas Hardy's I have tried aged 10 years or so. AWESOME!","Brutaltruth","Aug 10, 2014"

4.51,6.4,4,4.25,4.75,4.5,4.5,"Reddish brown in color. Thick head leaves a decent lacing. The aroma and flavor of this beer have a great deal of variation and layers of complexity. Wood, caramel and toffee, brown sugar soaked hops on the nose, a hint of wine. Lots off toffee maltiness and hops mixed with some dark/tart fruits in the taste. Wood and vanilla on the finish. Moderately warming, hot in the mouth. Very much full bodied. Excellent beer overall, although a tad hoppy for an english barleywine IMO. Would love to age one of these for about 5 years to tame the alcohol and hops a bit. Who knows when I'll see it again though.","Bonis","Jun 02, 2014"

4.44,4.7,4.5,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.5,"22 oz bottle. This a solid beer all around. It pours a dark caramel color with decent a moderate head and lacing. The smell is strong grapes followed by oak and caramel. The taste is really well-balanced, with grapes at the beginning followed by a smooth and sweet finish. This has a great texture and is not overly thick or boozy. I'm really impressed with this one.","mc4z","Jun 01, 2014"

I am not a wine person, but the red ? wine barrel works really well in balancing this beer. Very sweet and malt driven with a nice tartness. The only knock on it would be that it had a little bit of a hoppy bite or finish for an english style. In fairness, it does have a ""best after"" date on it. That should take care of the very slight bitterness. It is a fantastic version of the style though. Completely enjoyable from day 1. Cant wait to try the others in 1,2, and 3 year increments. This comes in just behind Goose Island Bourbon County, along with Billionaire, for the best BA English so far. $15 each is what I paid for this.","WesMantooth","May 10, 2014"

You get plenty of the expected notes from a big English barleywine including bread, raisins, toffee, caramel, molasses, and a hint of red wine sneaks through in the background. The hops are tame in this as they really allow the big sweet malts shine. A touch of oak is present as well. The taste is malt forward and sweet with an emphasis on the caramel, molasses, and dark fruit character. The red wine character seems to tie this beer together as it adds a hint of acidity and tames down the sweetness of the beer. Mouthfeel is fully bodied and low in the carbonation department. Overall, a very nice Barleywine.","homebrew311","May 07, 2014"

I appreciated the nice, almost ruby red beer as it sat in my tulip. The beer had a very malty entry. Lots of intense plummy, raisiny fruitiness immediately following upon entering the palate. A tad too sweet for me. I also appreciated how well the alcohol was masked. It was only after sipping for a while that I felt the overall warming effects of this 11+% brew. I enjoyed the cooked caramel, molasses?, dark chocolate, and grainy/bready flavors that swirled along my palate. The hops threw me off. For an English b-wine I was expecting a more toned down English, noble hop profile. Instead what I perceived was a big citrus notes along with (and welcomed) spicy, earthiness from the hops. The hops reminded me more of an American b-wine. The hops were more ""bitey"" as the beer warmed. The big citrus hoppiness overpowered any wine nuances that were supposed to be evident. I love lightly carbonated beers, which is what this beer is. I would also prefer a fuller bodied beer. This beer was a bit on the thin side for me. I have a second bottle. I will retry in a year or so, the hoppiness should be more mellow by then. This is a solid b-wine. It's not as great as the hype would have you believe. I love all b-wines. If you do as well, this is a must try.","mac31","Apr 25, 2014"

My gripe with their Reserve line of beers lately has been that they pretty much limit the barrel aging to about 50% of the beer yet the price reflects a 100% barrel aged beer. I don't necessarily think they are doing it to produce a lesser quality product but it certainly helps profits. Yet the 50/50 ratio is pretty clever in that it avoids heavy barrel presence which can be ""cloying"" if overdone but maintains a great level of complexity otherwise maybe not achieved through standard non-barrel aging practices.","MarcWP","Mar 23, 2014"

The cacophonous hoppy-sour tones ricochet around your mouth and tongue, but the oak intervenes just in time to develop a deliciously balanced melody.

Mirror Mirror has a warming, almost candy like feel to it as well, and goes down quite smoothly for a beer with an 11% alcohol content.","billzav","Jun 12, 2011"

Bitter across the mid-palate. Just a hint of barrel towards the finish, little bit sticky with some honey on the finish.

The nose comprises vague horse blanket brett, ruby reg grapefruit, orange zest, and a healthy dose of caramel. The taste holds notes of brett (now more spider-webby than horse blankety), orange flesh, mashed potatoes, parsley, and caramel. Gotta say, this was not a very pleasant flavor combination here. The body is a hefty-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, I was in no way impressed with this brew.

Poured red-orange with a half finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, caramel, wood, and a sour note (uh oh...). The flavor was of sweet malt, caramel, slight sour (at least it was only slight), wood, and peat. It had a light feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was okay, but it definitely had some sort of infection in it. The sour aspect did fade slightly upon warming up but was definitely still present. The aroma and flavors were decent, but definitely not awe-inspiring.

It adds a nice touch of class to the beer and is a flavor that is very pleasant to me. Mirror mirror is another beer to solidify my thoughts that Deschutes is a world class brewery.

This dark red to brownish beer has a decent sized head on it that dissipated after a few minutes. The nose and taste go hand in hand (or I guess it would be mouth and nose!). Lots of sweetness on both the nose and palate, with candied sugar hanging out at the back. Dark fruits, vanilla, and distinct woodiness to it lends to a nice strong mouthfeel.

It would suck to have missed its glory because of infection issues. I can't say what age could do to it but because Deschutes has acknowledged infection, I suggest, drink it now!","tewaris","Feb 03, 2011"

The flavors have since become richer, more pronounced, and more complex -- a huge improvement, from average to delicious. The finish was still a bit too dry for me; I was hoping for a fruitier, sweeter backend, but I think the bottle could've used another year or two of age on it. That being said, it's a solid barleywine and a joy to drink. However, if you've got some laying around still, I would recommend keeping it in the cellar for awhile longer.","Elendinn","Jan 30, 2011"

There's a spot of lacing, but not really all that much. Nose is a blast of caramel, with some resiny hop notes thrown in there as well. The nose was good, but Mirror Mirror tastes even better. Like the nose promised, lots of caramel, but the malty flavors coming through are quite complex. I also find a bit of biscuit and even some fruits (apricots and figs) that I wasn't expecting. A noticeable, but somewhat tame wave of hop bitterness flows through next, and the same resinous hoppy note from the nose comes back to close out each sip. The body is rich, and slick enough that if it weren't for the moderate carbonation it would be a bit too syrupy. Overall though, it works (though not spectacularly). 11% ABV and no alcohol? Well done Deschutes. That, the subdued hop bite thanks to a year of aging, and a great malty flavor make this extremely drinkable.

A blast of sweet malts, caramel, some honey, and a hint of alcohol washed over me. Before noticing the color I had already got an indication of what it would look like just by the smell. The color was a dark amber with a little off white head which turned into a thin lacing. The taste was wonderful. It totally matched the smell of this beer. The mouthfeel was a little syrupy.

Hints of caramel, figs, a good dose of alcohol. Just a faint hint of oak and vanilla that I would probably miss if I did not read the label on the bottle. The flavor does not let me down after the outstanding aroma. Thick and chewy caramel and toffee. A little dark fruit as well. Alcohol makes its presence know but it is not overly hot or harsh. Bitterness is moderate but I do not pick up any hop flavor. The body is certainly thick enough and has a nice low carbonation. It coats the mouth nicely. This beer is a sipper and probably should be shaired. I should buy another bottle and let it age for awhile.","morimech","Aug 01, 2010"

4.3,1.4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"22oz 2009 bomber poured into a snifter. It appeared a clear dark amber color with a finger of creamy brownish yellow stained head that has very good retension and laces in a spotty film around the glassware. Sweet aroma includes vanilla, hops, a bit of a mineral and metallic twang and a rush of alcohol. Taste is bitter upfront from the hops and the alcohol heat helps to exaggerate it. Slight mineral/metallic character incorporated in the body along with the bitter hop flavoring. Some sweet caramel and vanilla flavors are evident in the taste and throughout the body before a slight dry woodsy bitter presence rounds out the warming finish. Medium feel with a moderate level of carbonation. There is a lingering flavor of oak and hop bitterness left in the mouth that has some drying quality about it that encourages the next sip before your palate even as a chance to take in everything that is going on. The next sip returns the mixture of sweet/bitter/drying mesh off flavor. Overall this was very good and I could see this brew getting even bette with some more age. The best after date was a month ago: 4/20/10 and honestly it should be even later than that. Once the beer fully warms there are notes of dark brown sugar that is a bit residual if you can taste beyond the alcohol heat. Barleywine fans: this is a must try.","stakem","Jun 24, 2010"

Either way, it was pretty darn tasty then, and I expect the best now. Citrus and floral scents rise to my nostrils with a hint of some fresh cut wood. Upon first taste I gain a nice juicy orange and spicy flower fading into a sweet hint of bourbon. Wow! Very nice! I can feel the carbonation bite my tounge a little and that lovely caramelized bourbon taste brings itself forward a bit more as I take my next swig. The 11% it claims on the bottle is not even noticed. This is sweet and refreshing! All too often I find barley wines to end up bitter and sour at the end, but this knows exactly how to maintain itself. This is much smoother than it was even a few months ago. You owe it to yourself to try a bottle of this. Buy one to try now, and buy another to age for another year and try again later, and hey, buy a third to age two years!

The mouth feel is tangy with 11% ABV, but the heat isn't the main thing here. While there is a little peppery ""burn", it does come off with a smoothness...a couple of notches less than creamy. Full flavored, its all about being sweet with a peppery character. I get a malty 'white birthday cake' thing and slivers of caramel, but not the classic American Barleywine expression.

The taste is amazing...so many different types of malts, but it's ultimately very fruity and mainly I taste cherry...though there is a sweeter and deeper undertone there as well. You can barely taste the alcohol, making this one of the most drinkable barelywines I've ever encountered.

4.5,6.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"A basic, error free Barleywine that is wonderfully balanced on all fronts. A huge malt foundation lays the ground work with strong toffee, caramel, and molassas flaovrs. The texture rides the fence of sweet-syrupy and dry-malty. Fruity esters bring out juicy plumbs, dates, grapes, figs and dried fruits of prunes and raisons. With the malt sweetness the fruits take on a fruitcake taste and complexity. Rum-like alcohols give an aggressive power to the beer but never dominates with fusal or harshness. Hop flavor has a mild herbal taste, but ultimately is used as a bittering agent against the malts. The malt, fruit, and hop character gives the same impression from nose to finish with a long, lingering malt taste. A supurb Barleywine that should age well from years.","BEERchitect","Jun 27, 2009"

Tastes of more sweet malts and cherries with a profound and invigorating alcohol heat enveloping it all. Moving on we get some subtle hops, candy (licorice, red-hots, butterschotch), and a grain and pine base. The sweeter notes are prevalent, but work themselves into the mix well.

Aroma is boozy, reminiscent of brandy, a hint of woodiness some dark and ripe fruits, very sweet smelling but also very well balanced by the piney smelling hops. This smells fantastic. Flavor is loaded with caramel malts, brown sugar coated apples, over-ripe fruit, some buttery oak, brandy, a touch of bubblegum on the finish, and loads of warming alcohol. Yeah, this probably would do well with some age on it, but it's damn delicious as it is. Hop bitterness is perfectly balanced with the sweetness. Not overly sweet, and not overly bitter. Just right for a barleywine. Everything is integrated seamlessly. Medium mouthfeel, leaning on syrupy, but not quite there, lots of warming alcohol all the way down the throat.

It is really overwhelming. If you love oak flavors, this is your beer. I found the oak a bit overwhelming. The bottle claims 35% oak aged. I would love to try this at 25% as the oak really overwhelms a lot of the complexity that is still perceptible. It reminds me of Southern Tier's Oak Aged Unearthly, though I've only had that one once. I'll let the other bottle age and see if it makes a difference, but again, I'm not sure that will help. It is the oak, not the alcohol that makes this one fall short of amazing. I should note that I generally love oak aged beers. It's just that the oak flavor shouldn't be THIS dominant, IMO.","jkendrick","May 07, 2009"

The barrel aging is more evident in the taste as the wood plays a much larger role. Nutty malts are well balanced by ripe pitted fruits, subtle piney hops and spicy alcohol. Smooth medium body is nicely carbonated and compliments the ale quite well. Would call this more of an English than American as the hops play a minor role.

Too often I find barleywines sweet in an overbearing way, with no nuance or subtlety. That's not the case here, as Mirror Mirror shows quite a bit of depth and a subtle mix of flavors instead of merely beating you over the heat with residual sugars. All the same, there's plenty of toffee sweetness to balance the notes of tannic oak, toasted grain, dried fruit, red wine and tobacco. Alcohol is only faintly noticed, this is far from hot for weighing in at a hefty 11.5%. Nice firm bitterness in the finish along with a touch of drying oak.

Rich aroma of sweet malt and fragrant fruity hops, accented by notes of oak, sweet bread, and a wisp of alcohol. Palate is pleasantly sweet up front, with bready, caramel malt holding the bitterness of the hops at bay. Sweet fruit (plum or maybe apricot), treacle, and a moderate alcohol presence also make their contributions. Body is reasonably thick, a tad syrupy, but not over the top. Some serious warming on the finish from the alcohol. Overall, a good barleywine, if a bit young. I hope Deschutes continues to make this each year.","ElGordo","Apr 30, 2006"

Taste has everything working together, the sweetness tempered by the wood and vanilla, dark fruit lurking about, a nice package. Mouthfeel is smooth and lingering, in a good way, and drinkability is ncie as well, in that ""you want more even though it'll kick your ass"" kind of way.

This is one of the rare oak aged barley wines Ive had where that character comes across. The flavor is very soft. Dates, vanilla, sherry with a touch of citrus bitterness on the finish.

Having said all that the rest of the beer does not quite live up to this perfect use of oak. It is quite good though, and ,while I was not expecting such subtle hop character, the focus on malt in this Barley wine is quite nice, and in fact makes it that much better when mixed with the oak notes.","Gueuzedude","Mar 08, 2006"
4.19,-1.2,3.5,4.5,4,5,4,"Obtained March 2006 and consumed that same evening. Pours a cloudy amber orange with a one finger fine yellow head. Smells absolutely delicious as I write the appearance. To the nose its orange candy-like with piney hops and a flat, almost chalky, malt character. Not a robust oak character, like I find in many oak aged beers. Green raisins and a hint of cherry sour. This is a really enticing beer. Tastes pretty good, but the mouthfeel is to die for. Smooth and thick with a fine carb froth when the liquid is sloshed around in the mouth. Taste is caramel, oranges, touch of alcohol burn (but the alcohol is clean of any rough fusel character). Mildly vinous or brandy-like. A bit of cherry. Oak is really faint, and I only found it after looking for it. As I have ready access to Oak Yeti (by Great Divide Brewing), I'm used to a real oak whallop. This definitely has the more subtle oak character and I wonder if these barrels had been used a few times such that the flavor is even more subtle. Hop bitterness is fine for an american barley wine. A bit of hop oil on the flat of the tongue works well with the orange hop flavor. Overall, the hops could be decribed as a 'minnie-me' of Bigfoot. I find Bigfoot to be too brutally hopped, but this to be well done. I see this beer doing well with time in the cellar, but I don't see it as a 10-year beer. Drink it now, it's quite enjoyable and I had no problem finishing the bomber right here during the review.","mentor","Mar 07, 2006"

Taste seems quite hoppy with a bit of oak bite at first, but this too rounds out quite nicely as the beer equilibrates near room temperature. As such, the Mirror takes on more subtly fruity and malty sweet flavors, with drunken raisins dancing with heady plums. Finish is sweet, and just oaky and bitter enough to dry it out a bit. Body is nicely full without being too thick, and this beer, though a sipper, drinks quite nicely for what is still a relatively young barleywine. Id say delicious to drink now, but very worthy of some cellar time as well. I need to find some more of this beauty.","mikeys01","Feb 16, 2006"

4.23,-0.2,4.5,4,4,4,5,"This MASSIVE barley wine was aged in French oak wine barrels to give it that added complexity and finesse. It pours dark amber in color with a medium lacey head that falls quickly, which is not uncommon for a beer at 10%. The aroma is big and fruity, orange and cherry dominate with a big sweet sugary, malt underlay. The aromas carry over into the flavor along with some caramel, raisin and oak tones. The big slick mouth-feel is offset by the light fruity hop flavor that pervades the whole profile and cuts the sweetness. Its a big beautiful barley wine that should age well. Admit ably the flavor profile is quite different than any other barley wine Ive had, but in the best possible way. Most rely on a big caramel malt flavor or an 80+ IBU bitterness but this barley wine is all about assertive well integrated flavors of sweet malt (but not big caramel) and the pervasive hop flavor (but not big bitter). Buy some now for the drinkin and some to stash away as I do not expect this beer to be available long and should be a great addition to any beer cellar.","mattmaples","Jan 26, 2006"

I do, however, think this can turn out to be an excellent brew once a few years of aging come on. Will buy another and compare a few years down the line. This years would get about a 3.8 overall from me. Good, but nothing compared to the outstanding '05.","GClarkage","May 20, 2005"
3.58,-15.6,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Deschutes' new barley wine pours a deep bronzed amber with a decent sized head for a beer of this strength (I believe around 12-13%). The head quickly dwindles and disappears. The aroma is a bit funky, with strong berry and cherry flavors and some fruitiness from the port and pinot casks. It tastes incredibly sweet to me, very much like sherry with a sort of austere preserved fruit flavor, mixed in with the toffeeish malt. There's also a bourbonish element from the Jack Daniels casks, but no sourness, and I didn't detect any oak or vanilla flavors that one usually finds in cask-aged beers. I was surprised at the lack of hoppiness, both in aroma and bitterness, although I should admit I just had a Randall-ized Full Sail Wreck the Halls just before trying this, so perhaps my hop receptors were shot. Still, for a U.S. barley wine, particularly a West Coast one, the hops were subdued, almost invisible. As I slowly worked through the half-pint, more funky aromas and flavors became evident, particularly a strong sense of Parmesan cheese.","Thrasher","Dec 18, 2004"
