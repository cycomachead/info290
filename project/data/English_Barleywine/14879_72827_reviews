"Excellant barleywine . Big whiskey barrel flavor, plums, vanilla. very assertive flavor and aroma. Medium plus body. Not to hippy. Pairs great with dessert.  Lively carbonation. Great head retention.  This is awesome. I wish I could get in San Diego."

"Another big sweet brew. Good flavor and BBA mellowing carried the brew, making it  drinkable."

"Overall: my first Hoppin Frog and if they make other beers like this one far from my last. delicious combination of the english and Belgian aspects. I thought the barrel character may overwhelm this beer but was pleasantly surprised that it just melded nicely with the complexity"
"This is a terrific beer.  I hope I can still get another bottle and age it for a while."

"Taste - Very nice from the start.  As it warmed, the sweetness increased and I got hints of syrup.  This would be my only complaint about this beer - a bit too sweet.  The barrel character was perfect, and the caramel and malts really shined.  Feel was good.  Overall, I'm happy I got to try this beer.  Another great offering from Hoppin' Frog."

"Pours a dark brown with hardly any head at all. I poured it a bit warmer – around 50 degrees, and the heat from the alcohol was definitely on the nose, along with some boozy liquor, sweet bread and whiskey. Taste was a lot like the smell, but with even more added complexity. Almost reminiscent of a scotch ale – a little Backwoods Bastard in there somewhere. Sweet, sugary malts, bourbon as well as some vanilla, oak and coconut on the back end. Some burn of alcohol is present, but in the most decadent way possible. This one was a delicious sipper. I'd easily pay $20/bomber on another one of these any day, and that doesn't happen too often."
""
""
"O:  Complex and quite tasty. I do wish I could have aged it as I think it will integrate and gain complexity. Then again I'll just try to find another bottle"

"Bottle from Joe. Thanks! Pours dark brown color, some ruby on the edges where the light comes through, and a one finger khaki yellowish head. Unique aroma with plenty of whiskey, oak, fig, dark fruits, brown sugar as expected, but with some spice and another note that almost seems quad like. I assume the year is the ""Belgian"" influence? Flavor is sweet brown candi sugar, dark fruit, leather, caramel, some oak and dryness, coconut and vanilla finish. Thick body with medium low carbonation, coating the tongue. Definitely different from the standard BA Barleywine, but very nice."
""
"This is a port level sweet beer...but it hasn't come together yet.  With 2-5 years of age this is going to drink absurdly well.  I highly recomend grabbing this one and aging."

"The body alternates confusingly but very interestingly between thick, rich and viscous and thinner, alcohol running in and out on the tongue so it's hard to keep track of.  It adds a bit of sting as well, though not harshly.  I remains semi-sweet and doesn't run too sweet because of the hoppier elements, mostly, keeping some dryness in it."

"22 ounce bottle into snifter; batch 1, bottled in 8/2011. Pours lightly cloudy ruby red color with a small fairly dense light khaki head with decent retention, that reduces to a thin lace cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big caramel, brown sugar, raisin, prune, pear, apple, molasses, toast, vanilla, toffee, oak, clove, whiskey, herbal, light pepper, light coconut, and oak/yeast earthiness. Incredible aromas with awesome complexity and balance of dark malt, whiskey barrel, and moderate yeast ester notes; with great strength. Taste of big caramel, brown sugar, raisin, prune, pear, apple, molasses, toast, toffee, vanilla, oak, clove, whiskey, herbal, light coconut, and oak/yeast earthiness. Zero bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, brown sugar, molasses, raisin, prune, pear, apple, toast, brown bread, toffee, vanilla, oak, clove, whiskey, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity of dark malt, yeast ester, and whiskey barrel flavors; with a fantastic malt/yeast/barrel balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very creamy, slick, and lightly syrupy mouthfeel that is fantastic. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an insane barrel aged barleywine! All around incredible complexity and balance of dark malt, yeast ester, and whiskey barrel flavors; and extremely smooth to sip on for the big ABV. An extremely amazing offering."
"O - A really great offering from Hoppin' Frog. At 21.99 for a 22oz bomber it better be! This one doesn't disappoint though. I think with a year or two in the cellar it would really shine."

"O/D-This probably has about a year or more on it age wise. It's has mellowed and integrated itself. It's tasty but I must say I can imagine that I may have enjoyed it more fresh but how should I know? An expensive beer, I remember it being around $23 for a bomber. It got better after each sip."

"So my verdict on this one; happy to have had it, but its over rated and wrongly labelled. If you like your beers big and sweet, this ones for you."
""
""
""
"Hoppin' Frog's Barrel Aged Naked Evil barleywine is a notably rich and sweet beer that probably would have been better enjoyed if it were divided by four people on a cold January night, rather than split between two people on a warm August evening. As much as I enjoyed it, this beer is best in small quantities."
""
""
""
"My nose was right! Haha oh well. Apparently Belgian made me think more old ale due to the sweetness and also explains the bit of spice I picked up. If my memory is correct, this is a few years old now. Barrel integrated very well. Very nice beer"
""
""
""
"Pours amber with deep ruby red accents capped with a one finger light beige head which dissipates very quickly, however leaves a bit of lacing throughout. Deep rich aroma of oak, vanilla, booze, dark fruit, and toffee. Opens with a burst of plum, black cherry, fig, and rich accents of date, joined by vanilla and caramel. Finishes with toffee, booziness, and just a hint of whiskey. Full bodied with a syrupy mouthfeel that coats the inside of the mouth and low to moderate carbonation. Overall, this beer certainly trends on the sweet side, but it never reaches the point of being cloying. I’ve had better “rare” barleywines in the past, but this was a very solid offering. Glad to have tried this one out!"
""
""
"Mouthfeel/Overall:-Medium full mouthfeel; carbonation is about right. Lingering finish of toffee and whiskey. Overall, this beer hits about all the right notes for me. I'll throw in a disclaimer that it is very sweet, but for my tastes not overly sweet. It has plenty of subtlety and complexity in the flavor. The citrus component gives it some uniqueness. All in all I really enjoyed this beer."
""

"Very nice coppery color. I messed up and poured the sediment in here-otherwise it would be spotless to say the least. Very fine narrow lacing around the top of the glass. Caramel and malty aroma. Buttery and a mild oak tinge. Deep raisen like flavors. Caramel and treacle abound. long lingering sticky sweetness. Just enough of the barrel to let you know it is there. Very mild sherry notes. Great toffee like, sticky mouthfeel-ongoing sweetness...Not trace of the alcohol in this one at all. Just a great beer all in. One of the best UK barleywines I have had. I got this in an Xmas trade that was 80% barrel aged stuff so have held off until now. A real treat for sure. Thanks Laura aka ladyofmuchbeer..."
"Wow. I wish I remember who sent me this one. Props to you & Maximum Respect. This beautiful offering melds BA barleywine with a hint of Belgian yeast. Admittrdly, I'm not a big fan of many yeasty Belgians, but this one is blissful. Now officially a PERMA-WANT. Sorry, I usually follow the usual format, but I was in the moment this time. HAHA"

"Overall: This is a very tasty beer - the alcohol is very well balanced, and this beer is very sweet. I think the whiskey barrels made a huge contribution to this beer - it is very well rounded."

"O: Really really good. Nothing wrong with this beer except that its maybe a bit on the sweet side. Nothing a little age wouldn't keep under control. Thanks again jbck109!"
""
"I aged this one for about year and was rewarded nicely. Poured into a glass from the bottle, the ale was a golden color with a slight white head that left lacing along the sides of the glass. The beer had a pleasant boozy, malty aroma with hints of vanilla hidden in the aroma. In the initial taste, one gets a nutty, fruity, citrus sensation with hints of vanilla and dark fruit and vanilla in the background. There is a virtual explosion of taste here because there is so much going on. While one gets the warming sensation from the alcohol, it is well masked. The warming continues into the aftertaste with nutty and fruity sensations continuing. By far, this was the winner at a recent testing and my personal favorite from Hoppin' Frog."
"O-One of the the better Barrel Aged barleywines, not as good as Sucaba but the alcohol is well hidden but some more barrel notes would improve the beer."
""
"D: a bit heavy, but good flavor. slightly thick. besides the under-attenuated nature of this brew, it has a great nose and good flavor. HF has a good thing going here, they should try and use a different strand of yeast, or two yeasts, and get this thing a bit lower. alcohol heat is there, but not over the top. if research serves correct, this was bottled around June '12, so not a very old bottle. I would say good to drink now cellar'ers."
""
""
""
"Thanks, Prost76, for the opportunity"
"Medium bodied with a blast of sweet booze that lingers over the vinous fruits and sweet and leathery malt back bone into a dry, slightly spicy finish. The barrel presence is much stronger than the nose suggests with subtle toasted oak, vanilla, coconut and spicy whiskey booziness. For all of the alcohol flavor up front, it's actually not all that hot with lots of sweetness and a complex malt backbone balancing things out. It could actually use some more whiskey flavor and heat to counter all of the sweetness. Slightly leathery but the caramel malt, toffee and vinous dark fruit notes overpower almost everything that would suggest barleywine. Slight bubblegum character with hints of grape, raisin, date and plum. Pretty tasty with a well masked ABV but it's intensely sweet and lacking in balance. Also could use more of a spirit/barrel presence for my liking."

"This pours a murky, medium brown color with very little head. The scent is sweet with tart fruit. The taste is amazingly rich with sweet malts, sugar, caramel, vanilla, and so much more. It drinks very smooth with not a whole lot of carbonation. You can tell the alcohol is there, but it blends together nicely with the other ingredients. A great find and well worth it at $20/bottle."

"Well, Hoppin' Frog has joined the elite ranks as one of the few beers to earn a perfect score on Sud Savant. Deservedly so. This beer is fantastic! The barleywine style that they claim in their descriptor can be difficult to find sometimes, especially if the drinker is more accustomed to the more common ""American Barleywine"" style. However, as a traditional or ""English barleywine," this beer is a marvelous blending of styles. It incorporates all the malty, caramel-laden, fruity, boozy, silky goodness that we've come to know and love and combines it with even more dark fruits, active carbonation, and spice from the Belgian style. On top of that it throws in whiskey and oak! What else could you want?! The correct answer? Some in your glass and then some in your stomach. Top marks to Hoppin' Frog! What a beautiful bruiser!"
""

"O: I see why this is ranked so high. This was expensive, but it was almost worth it."
""
"M: cloying, unbalanced, too sweet"
""
""
""
"Making this review more for me moving forward. Perhaps I should have let it age another year (2012 vintage). Smelled delicious, spot on barley wine. Didn't get the belgian aspect at all. Ultimately, thick and sickly sweet. Ok sipper, but too much / too sweet throughout. Had no noticeable barrel-aged characteristics, the sweetness was overpowering. Looked beautiful though."

"O: A worthy beer, but, like Imagine from Block 15, it is very much unbalanced. If you like confections, this is your frog."

"Barrel Aged Naked Evil pours a brilliantly clear dark amber, with a handful of nice highlights. A finger and a half or so of white foam rises atop the beer before fading pretty quickly. Lacing is a bit on the scant side. I want to score the appearance lower, but the color is just too nice. The nose is wonderful, with aromas of brown sugar, figs, and plums all swimming together with a hint of whiskey. The flavor leads off with a malt profile that's definitely more brown sugar than caramel. The middle portion features some very nice esters from the Belgian and English yeast strains. Lots of fig, and a bit of plum to give it more of a dark fruit edge. The finish features some subtle oak and a bit of straight up whiskey (though it's not hot at all). The mouthfeel starts out fine, with a slightly heavy body and just a bit of carbonation. The carbonation seems to drop off soon after the beer's poured though, and the second half of each glass is just too syrupy (the mouthfeel score is a compromise between how each glass starts and finishes). Sure there are a couple minor technical flaws, but BANE excels where it counts (taste). I'd be lucky to come across another bottle of this brew."
""
""
""
"O: Very good at this point, especially for a lighter colored/bodied barelywine. I think I'd like to lay the rest of mine down for a good 2-3+ years and not sure if I'd seek this out as hard as I did or in large quantity next year."
"Thanks Charity (Towamencin Bev)!!!!"
""
"O: It was a solid barrel aged barleywine but nothing spectacular, still worth a try if you haven't had it already."
"O: Interesting. I'd rank this lower than the top tier barleywines I've had (Abacus/Sucaba, BA Hi-Fi Rye, etc.) but it was different for sure."
"A brown colored Barleywine with a mix between dark bronze, and deep amber. There is a off white head on top so that's a plus in this barrel aged beer. A nice sheet of lacing on the way down. The smell is bold and the barrel aging while big, does not distract from the other scents. There is the base beer with all those malts and things, plus some whiskey/bourbon scent along with a plethora of fruits. This is a fruity big ass barleywine. A candi scent from the Belgian yeast. A big basket of fruits. Plums, pears, apricots, and others mashed in as well. English and Belgian yeast varieties. Malts with some bread. Bourbon is on the light end but I can still taste it distinctly. There is some alcohol in this 11 percenter. A very smooth ride with some slight heat in the finish. I gotta say this does have a fruity aftertaste, unlike any barleywine that i've had. Could it be the barrel's, could it be this batch, could it be me, I don't know. It's sweet, but not a cloying mess. above medium in feel and a good amount of carb going for it. I myself would go for a 12ozer if they made it available.. A lot of alcohol and a big fruit base makes for a weird BA'ed beer that's top notch."
""
""
"(O)- Overall, just an excellent barleywine. Rich and smooth with an absolute dynamite balance and feel to it. It is clear this beer shines with the near 2 years of age this has on it. Never had fresh, but seeing it like this is clear that I would sit on fresh bottles considering what this was showing like after 2 years. Just excellent."
""
""
""
"For an English Barleywine, this is good. On the sweet side, but it's dramatically more pleasant than Sweet Evil. It's a good sipper, but it's arguable whether it's worth the intense price point."
"Naked Evil is a far better codename than Sweet Evil. The depth missing from the base is present in this version. Loaded with depth, but ultimately too sweet. Better."
""
""
"T - Balance isn't bad considering the Belgian off twist, but it is maybe a tad overly-sweet if I really must be nitpicky. The bourbon barrel is beyond accessible, and its semi-sweetness is somewhat offset by a nicely dry finish. Not mesmerizing, but well done. Wouldn't mind sitting another bottle in my fridge."

"As a barrel age barleywine drinker (my favorite style), i wouldn't take 10 of these for a King Henry, Abaucus/Sucaba, Kuhnhenns, Central Waters, etc... (all personal favorites, and sitting in my cellar). For the price, take your money elsewhere!"
""
"Overall, this brew is amazing. Delicious barrel aged notes and delicious Barleywine notes mixed in with some nice slightly spicy yeast notes. The sweetness is perfect and not cloying. This rivals King Henry IMHO. (5.0)"
"Pours amber with deep ruby red accents capped with a one finger light beige head which dissipates very quickly, however leaves a bit of lacing. Deep rich aroma of oak, vanilla, booze, dark fruit, and toffee. Opens with a burst of plum, black cherry, fig, and rich accents of date, joined by vanilla and caramel. Finishes with toffee, booziness, and just a hint of whiskey. Full bodied with a syrupy mouthfeel that coats the inside of the mouth and low to moderate carbonation. This brew is amazingly complex. It certainly trends on the sweet side, but it never reaches the point of being cloying. A sipper that is worthy of being savored on cold evenings."

"Over, a solid BA barley wine."
"So I pretty much confirmed my own stupidity by buying this beer. I told myself not to buy it last year because I know Hopping Frog beers are overpriced for the quality. After reading reviews and hearing the hype I wrestled with the $22 price tag before succumbing to my foolish nature. Ugh. Dark ruby red with absolutely no head, though it was not flat. Aroma of vanilla and whiskey, hint of fruit. The flavor was such a disgusting amount of sugar, cloying, no hints of whiskey, barrel, barleywine. This beer really sucks unless you like overpriced sugary pieces of shit. This is the absolute last bottle of Hopping Frog I will ever taste, pathetic."
"The body is a ruby infused amber color, with a light beige cap. Some good sized sip marks on the glass. The nose is really sweet. Loads of candied sugar, cherries, plums, oak, bourbon, vanilla, sticky toffee, and soft leather. We had this at ambient room temp at the time of serving, so all of the flavors were pretty bold by this point. On the palate, fresh, vinous fruit were omnipresent, with the barrel aging notes playing a secondary role. Candied sugar, sticky toffee, and some leather notes poked their way through here and there. Full body, syrupy, but yet more on the smooth/creamy side than the thick/chewy side. Loads of flavor that took me aback initially. Very sweet all the way through. Some more prominent oak could go a long way in cutting through the sweetness. Overall though, this is a nice beer, just cloyingly sweet."
""
"O: A pretty good beer, but a little too sweet. I'm hoping a year or two in the cellar will calm this one down a little bit."
""
""
""
"Been looking forward to this one. Cracked it because the Bears were losing to the Packers. Appearance is a deep amber, almost red. No head to speak of. Smells wonderful, banana peal, cognac, port wine, sweet malt. The taste is outstanding for the style. I'm not a huge BW fan but this is great. The wood notes are there but subtle. I do get a small amount of banana and vanilla. Reminds me of bananas foster, honestly, the flavors of brandy, banana, and caramel are all there to me. It's slightly boozy but the sweetness compliments it well. Mouthfeel is heavy but it is drinkable. I didn't think I'd be able to finish the bottle solo after my first couple swigs but I'm down to the last 3-4 ounces and it's still drinking fine. My favorite barley wine to date."
""
"O - It's in my wheelhouse, but just a bit too sweet. The sourness helps nicely with this though."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a fairly light amber color without much head. Smells like bourbon, vanilla, toffee, and a shitload of alcohol. Taste is far from nuanced or subtle. My mou is blasted with hot alcohol, way too much sugar, and some bourbon, vanilla and toffee. If King Henry represents the ultimate in big, yet smooth, refined and complex BA barleywines, I put this at the opposite end of the spectrum. Just a slap over the head with a bourbon-soaked plank of sugar cane. I also get a note of Dimetapp (or is it robitussIn?). Body is nice for the style - fairly thick and decent carbonation. Overall, I am disappointed by is beer. Super expensive for the quality. Not recommended for those who demand a lot from an expensive BA barleywine."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A bit of a different beer than Abacus and King Henry. This one takes the sweetness up a notch, almost on the verge of cloying. The whiskey notes are barely noticeable actually, just some faint oak tannins and boozy warmth. Love the coconut element. This beer just falls short of greatness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Fuller medium body, decent carbonation, creamy and full on the tongue with a lingering stickiness. I really enjoyed the integration of English barleywine, Belgian yeast and bourbon barrel - a unique beer that blends a number elements. I'd definitely like more of this, but at the $25-30 tag, I don't know if I'll buy another."
"O: This is a huge disappointment to me. I wanted to love this beer, and I certainly paid more money for it than I'm comfortable with. I think this could benefit from some more nuanced blending. There was literally no bitterness at all, and I thought that was a serious flaw. There are definitely much better BA Barleywines out there."
""
"Overall: I liked this, but was a little disappointed. For the price, and the taste, I will always prefer Sucaba. This was just WAY too sweet for me."
"O - Sweet carmel, toffee, dark fruit, slight booze finish."
"The beer is orange / copper hued with a small, white head. The aroma brings malt, booze, citrus. The flavor is bold, wth a huge malt presence. Slightly sweet, with a touch of tangy citrus. A bit of sweet toffee and butterscotch as well. Medium bodied. Overall, pretty tasty, albeit best in small doses. On the verge of being awesome."
""
"O: This reminds me a lot of Curmudgeon’s Better Half from Founders, just much, much more drinkable and satisfying. Funny thing is, though, it’s a totally different style – this barleywine is malty and boozy enough to pass as an old ale. Bold, but not too big, and with loads of intricate taste."
""
""
"O: this is a decent brew but there is simply no comparison to some of the more hyped up barleywines like KH, Sucaba and DDBA. I find this more more along the lines of Avery Samael’s (big brew, very sweet). A bomber is a massive amount to put down, so I definitely recommend sharing this one. If you like big sweet beers, then this one will be enjoyable, I personally wish that sweetness was turned down a notch. But as the brew warms, it definitely gets more enjoyable as more flavors start to make their presence known."
""
"O- very tasty Barleywine. Only had a few ounces of last years batch and really enjoyed it but not familiar enough to compare. The Belgian yeast gives it a nice fruity character."
""
""
""
""
"O: very good beer, but for the price I can skip it. This guy was $30 at Beer Heaven in Philly. Probably worth it to try it once as it's complex and delicious."
""
"Thanks for this one Scott!"
""
""
""
""
""

""

"Overall, a really nice bourbon barrel barleywine but not quite the top level yet. The combination of Belgian and English yeast really seperate this, but the bourbon is still hot. I would definitely get this again, although the price tag is steep."
"A fine example of an English Barleywine. This one drinks hot which I like. The price was a bit much like most Hoppin Frog beers, but I would treat myself to one again."
"O: Pretty excellent barrel aged barelywine. Whiskey is a little light, could be stronger to hold up against the insane sweetness of the beer in my opinion. Otherwise it is a nice heavy and complex barleywine. A must-have for the super sweet barlyewine lovers out there. Make sure to have this one fully warmed up."
"(O)- A very tasty beer! My wife and I cannot wait to taste this awesome beer in the nearest future again! It completely did not disappoint us which leaves a very positive note for this beer to be released again in the future!"
""
""
""
"O: One of the richest barrel-aged barleywines I've had. Belgian yeast esters certainly add to the sweetness."
""
""
"Overall: Unique and enjoyable."
""
"Overall: I will say this did not impress me as much as I thought it would. It is a very good example of the style but not the best I have had. I enjoy the whiskey influence and the yeast addition. These add another dimension to this beer that saves it for me because without these I would not have enjoyed this as much"
"OVERALL: A good beer, but the palate was not quite as heavy as I'd like. This is a sweet beer with lots of sweet barrel notes. I would appreciate a bigger bitter presence to add balance to the brew, but for a big, sweet, barrel aged barleywine, this is pretty nice. The flavors tell a story and the barrel doesn't overpower. A brew I'm glad to have tried and would enjoy trying a newer vintage, with the hopes that the palate thickens up and smoothens out a bit. Cheers for the bottels gents!"
""
""
"Mouthfeel – Sweet, sweet, sweet. Barleywines are not my favorite category, but this one is surely more delicious and palatable than many of its competitors."
""

"O: Really nice, and damn drinkable for a bba barleywine. The addition of fruit lends some good complexity."
""
""
""
"I’ve come to expect excellent beer from Hoppin’ Frog Brewery. Every so often, they release a beer that’s nothing short of exceptional. Barrel-Aged Naked Evil is one of those cases. I’m shocked at how good it is. The only slight downside is that it’s a bit too sweet. A little less would be more. That’s nitpicking though. This is great stuff! Highly recommended!"
""
""
"O– A very good brew. Probably right up there with some of the big dogs of the style and probably over looked too."
"Big thanks goes out to cmrillo for sharing this one as soon as I arrived at his house the night before his big 40 Beers* @ 40 Birthday Bash! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller taster flute. Poured a deep red-orange with a minimal off-white head. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, wood, sugar, and sweet alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, caramel, sugar, wood, and subtle sweet alcohol. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. I really went into this one blind not knowing what to expect, but what I found was quite pleasant. The sweetness on this one was really nice and made this brew stand out from some of the others from this style I’ve had. It did this all while not destroying a delicate balance of flavors and aromas. I’m really glad that I got the opportunity to have this one and hope to do so again in the future."

"The beer pours a clear light brown with almost no head. The nose is orgasmic with incredible sweetness and an outstanding barrel vanilla. There are toasty notes of coconut and caramelized sugars. The taste is godly smooth with intense whiskey barrel and barleywine sweetness. The aftertaste after each sip is equally smooth... definitely a sipper. However, the alcohol is incredibly well masked except for a slight burning in the back of the throat. Completely worth trying and seeking out, definitely the best barrel aged barleywine I've had."
"o- very good beer! its very sweet but very tasty. probably the fruitiest ba barleywine ive had to date. this is what i was hoping for with shmalts 15:15 but this one is done right. its very similar to hi fi but not quite as smooth, kinda wished i aged this guy for a year, i can see this guy smoothing out and tasting very special. definitly seek this one out if ur a fan of the style"

"Pours a clear orange with a orange-white head that fades to nothing. There is no lacing on this one. Smell is of malt and dark fruits. Taste is of malt, brown sugar, and some random fruity flavors. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good barleywine but it tastes better than it smells in my opinion."
""

"Overall - I don't expect most of the flavors this one delivers. Super appley. I see why they call it a Belgian-style barleywine, but the Belgian characteristics remove some of the depth of flavor that I seek in a whiskey barrel beer. It doesn't deliver flavors that are that appealing, but it's still good."
""
"O: Little sweet. Very good. Not hoppy."
""
""
"definatly a top notch barleywine, worthy of all the hype. there definatly is a lot of sweetness going on, but its not at all cloying. right up there with mother of all storms IMO, but well have to see how it stacks up to king henry as soon as i open my bottle. im glad i got some bottles to sit on."
""
""
""
"o - overall, this brew hangs with the big boys and lives up to the hype. i was expecting something good, but this far exceeded my expectations. what a beer!"
"Appearance- Pours a 1 finger head that"
"EDIT: I had this again later at a tasting and appreciated it much, much more. I speculated that it might be bottle variation and received some agreement from others who had encountered different bottles. I'd probably give that one a 4.3."
"Overall: Good, but not great. Too sweet, and I'm not thrilled by the yeast profile. It's still a pleasure to drink and ranks as one of the best beers I've had from this brewery."
""
"O: Impressed with this beer. I had expected it to be good, but it is extremely smooth and well rounded. Not too much booze, too much of anything for that matter. Just a little more whiskey flavor would make it better, but it is hard to complain."
""
""
""
""
"I'm thinking I got into a bad batch, or perhaps storage. Like I said, it has all of the good stuff. There's something missing and I think it's the flow between flavors. Hmmm"
"Beer is medium in body and syrupy on the palate, very nice beer overall. The finish is mildly bitter, strong flavors good finish. Not usually my style but I am glad I had this beer. Much fun."
"o - Overall I liked this one quite a bit, and I liked it more the more I drank it. I was a bit worried after smelling it that it was going to be a bourbon bomb, but not the case. Taste was a wonderful mix of bourbon, vanilla, and caramel, and it was super easy to drink. Would definitely like to have it again."
"The flavor has some smooth bourbon and a good dose of caramel with some light fruits in the background. There is a touch of booze and moderate oak. Touch of bourbon. Medium body with lowish carbonation and some booze. Quite good."

"Overall, definately cracking the top 10 EBWs in the world, but just shy of elite status in the style category. This brew had a slight buttery characteristic that knocked it down a notch for me. It sadens me to say this because I wanted it to be, but not the brew King Henry is."
""
""
"O-I honestly can't think of a barleywine that I've enjoyed more.Extremely glad that I've got another one stashed away."
""

"Highly, highly recommended."
"This beer pours a full bodied and syrupy tarnished bronze in color with cherry red highlights, with moderate carbonation and only the slightest of lacings. The nose features typical barleywine sweet malt characteristics and then a nice addition of vanilla, oak, and toffee. I don't get any whiskey, just notes typical of barrel aging. The flavors are more complex. There is plenty of caramel, toffee, vanilla, light oak, cherries, maple syrup, and it finishes with a slight whiskey burn. It loses complexity the further you get through your glass. The cherry really comes out more and more as you drink and gets sweeter and sweeter. It drinks full bodied and syrupy for the style. Overall this is a nice barrel aged barleywine but I expected a lot more. It's not in the King Henry/Mother of All Storms category but its a nice beer. I wouldn't say it was worth the $25 though."

"22 ounce bottle. Served in a snifter, the beer pours a reddish/copper color with about a half inch light tan head. The head didn't stay around for long, and there's a small amount of lacing. Aroma is rich and sweet, the brew smells like vanilla, coconut, caramel, dark fruit (figs, raisins), whiskey, sweet booze (maybe sherry?), and some brown sugar. It tastes like brown sugar, caramel, vanilla, bready malt, figs, plums, whiskey, and some sweet booze. Like the aroma, it's a mostly sweet tasting brew. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's syrupy and slick with low/moderate carbonation. Overall I think it's a pretty good beer, it's definitely worth trying. Picked up this bottle for $19.99 on a trip to Illinois a couple months ago."
"This beer pours a clear mahogany, nearly still with a miniscule white ring of head and tiny spots of tight white lacing cling to the glass. Off the bat I am hit in the face with a punch of whiskey, eventually it opens up into a delicious sweet malt base with strong scents of nougat and vanilla/coconut. Upon pouring this into my mouth I see where this goes from a B+ barleywine to being off the charts. Flavors such as vanilla, coconut, wood, nougat, caramel, booze, and sweet cream all meld into one heavenly elixir that graces my palate. Left with a lingering green apple/fresh fruit flavor (maybe the Belgian side of this?) The mouthfeel is nice and coating, not too thick, not too sweet or dense. A good amount of carbonation for the style. Please make more of this Hoppin Frog! This beats Boris Royale in their whiskey barrel aged experiments. I have found a new admiration for this brewery."

"Smell is awesome and unique. Definately some vanilla, bananas, cloves, and some nice fruity sweetness to go along with it. Taste is vanilla, banana to a lesser extent, spices, a little sweets that may be belgian candy sugar. Really nice tasting. Mouthfeel is fairly thick and nice for the style. Great beer!!! My first from Hoppin' Frog!!!"
""

"O- First time having this beauty, really impressed, big bourbon and vanilla taste coming out, really rich, definite winner."
""
"O: BA Naked Evil is an impressive beer, especially from a brewery that I'm not sure has bottled a barleywine before. It definitely is a ""Belgian"" barleywine, as the saccharine flavors almost turn this into a pina colada type flavor. The ripe dark fruit, chocolate, belgian yeast, and whiskey flavors are all touched on correctly, but it has a sweet, cloying quality that is ever so slightly off-putting. Excellently crafted, but not one I would reach for again and again. Would love to see what HF could do with a barrel aged, non-Belgian barleywine."
""
""
""
""
"O: A very enjoyable beer and one I hope I have the opportunity to try again."
""
""
""
"I recently reviewed a beer that was good, but not a ""Let's sit at our desk and drink this, focusing only on it," kind of beer. BA Naked Evil is what I'm talking about when I'm talking about a ""let's sit and drink this," beer. I am going to spend the next hour or two relishing every sip left in the bottle."
""

""
""
"O - Incredibly unique beer. Extremely drinkable and I don't think I've had anything else like this, though it sort of reminds me of Arquebus. I think if I had this beer on its own, it would be stellar, but with the other barleywines having different yeasts and a darker malt bill, this left me wanting a bit more from this beer."
""
""
""
"Great fruity and sweet malt characterisitcs with a barrel character that doesn't overpower. A great bourbon barrel barleywine, but I wish the Belgian yeast came out a bit more. Seems like the sweetness, barrel aging, and alcohol content leave no room for the yeast to display it's character. Maybe in due time."
""
"O: Nice sipping beer."
"O- Yes, please. A treat, a luxury, and not a good value per se.. but an awesome beer nonetheless."
"O: This really was a great beer. I would definetely drink this one again. Stands up to the barleywine style, with some great characteristics for the bourbon barrel aging."
"O: A pretty good take. Not impressed as the ratings are a a bit inflated. Definitely not the trade demand it drives."
""
""
"Though, like most Hoppin' Frog beers, this is borderline prohibitively expensive, it is excellent nonetheless. I loved the Belgian qualities of this barleywine, and would love to drink another bottle."
""
"dark brown in color with a huge head of tan that just towered over the top of the glass. Settling down smoothly and evenly it produced a thick coating of lace all along the sides of the glass. Rich vanilla and woody aromas are being picked up almost immediately. Huge notes of oak and subtle caramel and toffee and truly dominating here for sure. Warming only brings this out further, rich and decadent, sweet aromas just building off each other here. The first sip is divine, subtle, and rich and perfectly carbonated it simply rolls across the tongue with a gentleness that is unheard of. Vanilla and caramel merging with oak like notes and touches of earthy hops all working together seamlessly. I am still not sure how strong this one is, but subtleness is key here as it was barely detectable at all."
""
""
"Overall: This is the BEST Hoppin Frog beer I have drank! BORIS and DORIS are Shit compaired to this beer. Amazingly complex beer that is super smooth and drinks easy on a cold winter evening among good friends. One of the best barleywines I have tried this year. I paid $20 for a bottle...totally worth it!"
""
"D/O- Having the the same night as MoaS...this is right up there with it because of its uniqueness. If your a fan of Belgians, barrels, and barleywines then this is the beer for you. Thanks a ton 4DAloveofSTOUT!"
""
""
"Overall - Really special. Tons of flavor, fun to drink, espically if you like aged in whiskey barrel beers. This is a big beer, meant to be enjoy on occassion, and with a fan of the style. Fantasic, hope i can find another bottle to age."
""
"D - awesome barleywine here. The whiskey is really well integrated into the profile and makes for a very enjoyable brew. Recommended if you can get your hands one some, one of the better barleywines I have ever tried."
"O: I thought it was pretty good at first, but by 4 or 5 ozs the sweetness took over and thats all I could get out of it..by the end I wasn't enjoying it so much...almost cloying sweet..def. not worth the price tag. this beer isn't remotely close to the top barlywines like abacus and MoaS..IMO"
""
""
""
"Overall this was one killer barley wine! The only thing I’m a little upset about is that this was my only bottle. This is a true sipping ale, and I must admit I’m glad that I lit a fire right before I started this one because they seem to go hand in hand on a cold snowy night like tonight. If you come across this one or have the opportunity to trade for it by all means go for it, because not only is it a limited release, it is fantastic for the style. Well until next time."
"O - This is a very good barrel aged barleywine. A nice rare find from Hoppin' Frog."
""
""
"Probably the best beer I have had from Hoppin' Frog. I real gem. Surprised it drank so smoothly for being relatively fresh but I'm sure this will age nicely. Definitely seek this one out."

""
"O – This a great barleywine, but better than Abacus (SUCABA) I don’t think so. This comes in 2nd right after Abacus in my book."
""
""
"Overall: All the positive buzz I'd heard about this one was definitely true. Very reminiscent of Kuhnhenn's BB4D (one of the best brews I've had this year). It's a little hotter on the finish than ideal. While this brew is a little bit on the pricy side, I'd recommend trying a bottle now, and holding onto one or more to enjoy after a year or two. It would be money well spent."

"Overall this was a miss for me and I cannot understand the high ratings on BA right now. I can appreciate how a fresh Barleywine like this has little to no alcohol but it's just a sweet, cloying mess in my opinion. Definitely not worth the"
""
""

"Very good beer but yikes, I wonder how many acres of sugar beets went into this bottle. Tasty tasty tasty. Going to brush my teeth thoroughly now to prevent teeth rot."
"A buddy described this as ""almost as good as M"". I wouldn't say that but this is very very solid in its own right and has tons of aging potential. Rich and complex now with a flavor profile that is perfectly complementary. Definitely one to sit on."
"I savored this to the last sip and was so happy we stayed to enjoy this bottle. Ben, many thanks. Excellent beer."
"Cheers!"
"O: One of the better BA English Barleywines I've had under MoaS. The flavors and aromas were top notch. If you don't like sweet beers this might not be for you though. I will be seeking out another one of these...well worth the $25."
"Poured from a bottle into a 5 oz snifter. Pours a cognac like appearance with a minimal head despite a vigorous pour. Nose is loaded with sweet caramel, bourbon and vanilla. What an incredibly well scented beer. The taste hits you with this peculiar banana taste. Just like I enjoy the addition of grapefruit flavor I. An IPA. The bourbon and vanilla along with the banana make an encore appearance in the taste. The mouthfeel is allstar caliber. Very smooth with zero bitterness. Quite sweet actually. Overall, this is simply outstanding. Glad Ive got two more."
"O - Really exceptional beer. For the first barleywine from HF they've ever made (as far as I know), and a barrel aged one at that, this one was spectacular. Great work Fred. I can't wait to see how the rest I have age."
"O- This is a very easy to drink beer treat. Well done guys!"
"Mouthfeel is spot on. Carbonation is perfect. It leaves a heavy, slightly syrupy beer but it never feels like too much and is never cloying. Overall, my satisfaction was very high. I'll be trying to track down more of this beast. It's truly an exceptional beer. Fantastic, seek out."
"Mouthfeel: Thick as motor oil on a cold winter day, just as I expect this 11% BW to be. This is a very good sipper that will last a while since it is so sweet. Can't wait to see how it ages."
"Overall, a really well made beer. My winner of the month, so far."
"Pours a headless, syrupy brown into my Maudite snifter. Smells like toffee, bourbon, and sweet malt. Awesome. Taste is bourbon, caramel, and delicious layers of malt. Definitely on the sweeter side, but the bourbon notes keep it in check. With some time on the bottle this will get even better. Overall an awesome barleywine and one of the best new beers I've had in awhile."
"O - Good beer, too sweet for my liking, but the flavors are good. Would drink again."
"O - While the nose was really nice, I just couldn't enjoy the high level of sweetness in this beer. Like I previously mentioned, I do like my BW's on the sweeter side (less hoppy), but this was too much. Not bad, but I'd rather have something else."
"Overall this beer is excellent. I'm not sure I have had a barrel-aged beer, barleywine or otherwise, that has been this well rounded and complex so close to bottling. This one didn't come with all the hype and fanfare of some beers of this stature, in fact I only picked it up after it was recommended to me by two other people. I'm glad I did before the word gets out."
"I think more then just myself was apprehensive when we saw the belgian style barleywine label, but this is good stuff. Curious to see how it ages honestly, i do not like aging most beers, but *maybe* this one is a candidate."
"O-This is one of the best Barley-wines that I have ever had. It is not blow your mind amazing. Instead, this is a beer that has layers and layers of complexity that one needs to contemplate before realizing how awesome it is. I feel like this is a tickers-tick, type of beer. It is very good but once you start breaking down a beer in a review you get a different take on it. I believe that I will have to hunker down and get a few bottles for the cellar, this is gonna age with the best of them"
"O: While this was very sweet I really enjoyed it and the whiskey barrel imparted some great flavors. I'm glad I decided to bite the bullet and pick one up at Binny's."
"Huge thanks to Bobby8405 for the share, and to Jparkanzky for sending it this way. The brew pours a reddish copper hue with a very silky appearance and it is capped with a short-lived taupe froth. The nose is redolent of luscious coconut liquor, pineapple upside-down cake, delectable toffee notes, vibrant oaken vanilla, and buttery richness. As far as the flavor goes, I can add no more to the descriptors, other than to say that it is stunningly delicious, and that there is a modicum of well-placed anise nuance that is not detected aromatically, as well as a trace suggestion of dried golden fruits likely imparted by the yeast. The feel is exceptionally silky. Overall this is one of my favorite beers I’ve ever had. It is like a hybrid of (gasp!) Wooden Hell and BA Magnolia Star. ISO!"
"O - Possibly my new favorite barrel aged barleywine, which I didn't think I would ever say after trying Abacus. This is the first Hoppin' Frog beer that I've tried that I didn't drink a little of and then think ""I paid how much for this?!"" No regrets on paying $20 per bottle of this one. I have a couple more in the cellar that I look forward to aging and trying in the future."
"Light-to-moderate carbonation, I had my pour after the bottle had been open for about a half hour though. Excellent overall, this was a real pleasure. Plus I got to discuss the beer with the brewer as we pissed away the evening, not a bad night at all."
"D - I suspect this will improve over the next few months, but it's quite excellent already. Handily the best Hoppin' Frog offering I've ever had. The Belgian yeast works very nicely with the barleywine sweetness and intense barrel character. Looks like I'll have to find a bottle or two for the cellar."
"O - Had this beer after it was recapped for ~6 hours."
"Much, much, much better than I expected given the Belgian aspect. It has plenty of esters, but only the good, fruity ones and none of the bad, plasticy ones. I hope to get more of this for certain."
"O - Sweet flavors, a good job of aging, and the burn of some good whiskey. This was a good evening sipper. Could have used a more potent aroma, and more complex taste, but that is just nitpicking a little, as this is really good. The burn on the cheeks and smooth richness of the taste make me want to go get another bottle."
"O: Glad i was driving through good old Ohio last Thursday. Congrats to Hoppin' Frog on five years of making some of the best beers i have ever had. Keep up the good work!"
"The first beer tasted just before a buddy's wedding. It's described as a Belgian-style barleywine (whatever that really means) aged in whiskey barrels. Right on. It pours a clear copper-tawn topped by a finger of light tan foam. The nose comprises maple syrup, light oak, sweet toffee, light mandarin orange syrup, and the slightest hint of whiskey. The taste continues the sweet tradition of the smell, with the toffee really running deep and the heat of the alcohol finally showing through. It's clear this barleywine is still quite young. The body is a stolid medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a syrupy feel. Overall, though young, this is quite the tasty b-wine. I'm sure age will be a boon to it, but it's ready to go now for the adventurous. Good times."
