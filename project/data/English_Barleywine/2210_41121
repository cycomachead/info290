Smells of coconut, vanilla, dried fruit, caramelized sugars, malts and a few other things I couldn't identify.  Tasted thin in the mouth like most barley wines.  Flavors are as above but it didn't knock my socks off.  Over hyped before drinking maybe?  After taste is vanilla, dried fruit and Barley.  Good but not out of this world good.","uvachief","Mar 03, 2015"

4.48,-1.1,4,4.75,4.5,4.5,4.25,"Overall, this beer certainly lives up to the hype.  Even after a solid two to three years maturing in our cellar, this 2012 stock retains its intense buttery woodiness, dense caramel sugariness, and warming bourbon booziness.  Aside from these obvious necessities, you get ever shade of complexity to fill in the gaps across the nose and palate.  Although we don’t have a great base of comparison, if seems that nothing has faded or taken to the top.  The balance remains supreme.  We tackled this as part of our recent “Whale Hunt”.  Our cellar space is being dramatically reduced in the upcoming months, so we’re systematically going through the “drink now” beers we’ve been aging.  This beer, more or less, is helping to kick that off.  In this vein, it was nice reading about the history of this beer.  It seems that this was one of, if not the, genesis beer of their “Reserve Series”, and it fits so well.  We’ve obviously not sampled them according to their order of release, but it meets that same quality of barrel-aged wonder that the rest of them have attained.  §ucaba is a phenomenal beer, and something every true BeerAdvocate should seek out for reference point and blissful enjoyment.","TheBrewo","Feb 11, 2015"

The flavor follows the nose pretty closely with a bigger emphasis on the toffee caramel flavors. There is a bit of booziness, but it is quite welcoming and subtle.

Perhaps the most complex beer I've had. There's a significant amount of barrel influence in the nose and taste from bourbon, whiskey and oak. And there's a lot of sweetness along with a smoky tobacco flavor that I assume comes from the barrel aging. They all mesh together excellently. This is the top barley wine I've had. FW continues to astound with their skill.","MonkeyBread","Dec 21, 2014"

Fairly smooth when I expected it to be a little gritty.  Since it's so full flavored it starts of big and sweet, gets slightly bitter in the middle, then goes to a dry bitter finish like a red wine.  The one thing is it's a little hotter than I prefer, but gets much easier the more you drink.  Speaking of which, it's really drinkable.  Really good overall beer.  Firestone Walker really continually produces amazing products, and probably the best barrel aging program out there.","AndyAvalanche","Oct 02, 2014"

It pours a dark color with a tan head that doesn't last long. It has aromas or fruits, malts, sweetness and alcohol of course. It has strong notes of spices, dates, figs, caramel, wood-aged. It is strong but is very smooth on the palate. This is my first one, 2014 edition and will be buying more of these in the future!!","Clints1991","Sep 17, 2014"

4.5,-0.7,,,,,,"2013 Vintage.  Poured into a snifter, the beer is a dark, cloudy, opaque, caramel-toffee coloring with a sparse coating of light tan head that recedes into a halo. Nose of rich caramel, molasses, apples, toffee, booze, roasted nuts, date and fig, wood spice, and earthy notes.  Some highlights of raw honey and sugar candy, too. Wow! Flavors of rich sweetness, layered indefinitely, with notes of caramel, honey, toffee, sugar candy, roasted notes, butterscotch, booze, and earthy highlights. Quickly warming in mouth, with a dose of hops bitterness to keep some semblance of balance. Heavy and big. The body is robust and smooth, with an underlying dryness. The aftertaste is almost like candy, with a heavy dose of old world fruit and booze. Tangy and richly sweet linger on a smooth, drawn out finish. Very solid brew.","GarthDanielson","Sep 02, 2014"

I would be interested to see how more aging would affect this beer, but honestly, since it was more mellow than I expected, now was probably a better time to drink it. One of the few big ABV over 12oz bottles I would recommend not sharing. This beer has a extremely long development time, unless you drink it super slow you miss out on more than the usual brew.","minterro","Aug 31, 2014"

The most relatable beer I've had to Sucaba lately was Fremont's Bourbon Abominable, which for me, was clearly the superior beer. This was malty, sweet and sherry-like with nice tobacco notes, but I wanted more bourbon, coconut, vanilla, oak and spice. Sadly it did not live up to expectation.","abeeronthebeach","Jul 24, 2014"

I smelled some oak, some brandy, but all very faint, and the beer doesn't really lead you anywhere. Taste reveals a sweet barleywine, very light, not heady, not strong, but very tasty. Not many notes picked up. Body is medium, not a light bodied beer.","JulioH","Jul 19, 2014"

The barrel effect is flavourful and adds a great deal, but does not overpower the base beer, which is terrific. Caramel, bread, bourbon, oak, vanilla and light fruits/berries. The flavour is big, but not the overpowering intensity that I expected - this is a good thing. It is remarkable how drinkable this beer is given its potency. First rate stuff - now I just have to try and find more. A lot more.","jrenihan","May 17, 2014"

The smell is sweet caramel with light vanilla and oak. Surprisingly little alcohol for the ABV. The taste is similar, lots of caramel, minimal booze. I find this a lot less sweet than similar beers of this style (say Bourbon County Barleywine). This is really easy drinking due to the low sweetness and despite the ABV. Definitely my favorite barrel-aged barleywine.","mc4z","Apr 13, 2014"

4.74,4.6,4.5,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.75,"The beer pours some off-white head that dissipates very quickly but still leaves a ring around the inside of the glass. The beer itself is an opaque dark plum color. The beer has notes of very dark purple with black that strongly resemble plum. The smell is fairly complex with chocolate and caramel notes. Dark fruit smell that resembles plums with a bit of oak and a very concealed note of alcohol with a bit of barely smell. The strong notes are definitely the dark fruits. The taste is similar to the smell. Caramel and plum notes dominate the taste. The alcohol and oak make an appearance and compliment the stronger notes very well and end up creating a nice caramel taste in some places. Notes of vanilla from the barrel also appear. The beer is heavy bodied but very smooth to the point where it feels silky. Overall, a fantastic barleywine and one that I'll go looking for each year.","HattedClassic","Mar 14, 2014"

4.71,4,4.5,4.75,4.75,4.5,4.75,"I had a bottle of 2013 §ucaba that had been aged for exactly one year. After missing out on the 2014 §ucaba release at my go-to liquor stores, I consoled myself by breaking out the 2013 version from my cellar. §ucaba pours a deep ruby brown with a tan head that dissapates relatively quickly. The smell had notes of toffee, caramel, bourbon, vanilla, and oak. The taste was fantastic combination of sweet decadent caramelized malts and bourbon barrel notes. Burnt caramel, toffee, butterscotch, caramelized brown sugar, bourbon, charred oak, vanilla, coconut, dark sweet cherries, and subtle chocolate/coffee flavors. §ucaba has a pronounced barrel character that compliments the sweet malts beautifully without feeling too boozy. I thought the bourbon notes were quite smooth without the type of heat that you might expect from a 12.5% ABV barleywine. I think one year of aging may have been the perfect cellaring period. The mouthfeel was remarkably smooth, velvety, and drinkable for the ABV. This beer was truly a pleasure to drink. Firestone Walker has blown me away again once again with their bourbon barrel-aged releases. If I have to choose my favorite barleywine of all-time, it is a close call between §ucaba and Bourbon County Barleywine, but I think I would have to give a slight edge to §ucaba. Simply fantastic.","lmperialChad","Feb 12, 2014"

4.82,6.4,4,4.5,5,5,5,"2000th review! Got in a trade with cyde. 22 ounce bottle into snifter; 2013 vintage, bottled on 1/9/2013. Pours lightly cloudy dark ruby brown color with a small dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin lace cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of big vanilla, molasses, toffee, caramel, raisin, toast, chocolate, coconut, oak, bourbon, tobacco, clove, and toast/oak earthiness. Incredible aromas with fantastic complexity and balance of malt and barrel notes; with great strength. Taste of huge molasses, vanilla, raisin, caramel, toffee, toast, coconut, chocolate, oak, bourbon, tobacco, light clove, and toast/oak earthiness. No bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of molasses, vanilla, raisin, toast, caramel, toffee, coconut, chocolate, oak, bourbon, tobacco, and toast/oak earthiness on the finish for a while. Insane complexity of malt and bourbon barrel flavors; with a perfect malt/barrel flavor balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and full bodied; with an very creamy, slick, and slightly syrupy mouthfeel that is amazing. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an absolutely insane BA English Barelywine style. All around insane complexity and balance of malt and bourbon barrel flavors; and extremely smooth to sip on for the high ABV. Absolutely unbelievable stuff, Wow.","superspak","Jan 27, 2014"

Boozy, woody nose with hints of dark fruit, butterscotch, oak, vanilla, caramel, and subtle bourbon. The taste is also dominated by booze and wood along with hints of toffee, dark fruits, caramel, vanilla, oak, butterscotch, maple, bourbon, and some subtle chocolate. The mouthfeel is initially a bit on the hot and boozy side, but as it warmed it became quite smooth and creamy. Overall, this is another world class offering from Firestone Walker.

Had this a few days after having Goose Island's BCBW and that was one of the best beers I've ever and may ever have. And this kind of paled in comparison to be honest. And BCBW is 12.1% and Sucaba is 12.5% but the alcohol prescence would lead me to believe it is more like 15% and a could barely detect the ABV in BCBW. Also the bourbon barrel presence is there but at a medium level compared to other big BA beers I've had. Barelywines and Old Ales along with Scotch Ales are my favorite beer styles and hope to see more barrel aged ones.","PaulyB83","Dec 03, 2013"

Good lacing, and the collar was thick at the edge of the glass. Aroma of toffee, caramel, some woody earthiness, sweet medium roasted malt too. Taste is of toffee/caramel, leather, woody-earthy, very lightly smokey (perhaps because of the campfire). So damn good. Mouthfeel is all that barleywines should be.

4.45,-1.8,4.25,4.75,4.5,3.5,4.5,"The beer has a curious and medium bodied mouthfeel. It begin with a good amount of carbonation, but finishes with a slick almost oily feel. The oily feel is very brief and unfavorable, but I'm really only nitpicking here. Just something I have not experienced before. The taste begins with a warming impression of strong malt flavor that fades to the dark fruit that was strong in the nose consisting of prunes and raisins. Just a hint of vanilla on the finish with a slight reemergence of the alcohol. Very consistent to the English barley wine style with then barrel aging providing layers of complexity. Very good beer and wonderfully done blending and using the various barrels.","Jmamay22","Oct 16, 2013"

4.37,-3.5,4.5,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.25,"O - 4.25 - It's good. Given its reputation, I had for some reason expected a bolder complexity in terms of layering. But like some other English-style barleywines I've had, and like a lot of English and English-style beers in general, its subtlety makes its complexity something you have to work for, in this case at least beyond the sherry notes, which are themselves pretty bold and nice to have. There in the center is a mildness where I want something more. Style considerations aside, if I could magically alter it for the better, I'd put a puff of spice in it for that extra sense of layering and altitude, give it a buttery viscosity to play against the bitter/dry ending, and add something unmistakeably earthy to give it some additional depth and counterpoint to the sweet elements. Take me down low. It's still a very nice beer and well made. The potency of the alcohol in it leaves you dreamy warm and relaxed. To me it's an ideal slow, no-hurry, contemplative sipper for when the weather cools. Great brewery.","BrownNut","Oct 06, 2013"

Flavor tastes of dark fruit, oak, vanilla, mild milk chocolate, and booze. Without messing around, let's just say this is probably one of the ten best beers I've ever had. It's luxurious, balanced, complex, and way more drinkable than a 13% ABV beer has any right to be. It was outstanding from the first sip to the last, and only prudence prevented me from having a second glass. I can find no fault with it.","MaximalC","May 31, 2013"

4.55,0.4,4,4.5,4.5,4.75,4.75,"this is as good as a barleywine can get for me, a style of beer I don't always rush to score because of the heavy fusel alcohols and mess of grains usually accompanying American versions. this however, is a masterpiece! thanks to claystation for hooking it up. 2013 release. it pours a deep mahogany color, dense but not particularly cloudy, with a tall and fairly long lasting off white head. the nose is very complex, but also mellow. I definitely get red wine, charcoal, bourbon, rye malt, caramel, and alcohol. the different barrel blends really come out in the nose and the taste, giving a lot of layers to this monster. the flavor features some vanilla and some toffee, brown sugar, but its not too sweet, and some dried fruits in the date or fig range. again, the complexity is stunning. furthermore, the alcohol content of this beer in not caustic or hot like I expected it to be. its in fact quite tame, just warming, appropriate. this is also oddly drinkable for its magnitude. its soft in feel, but very well carbonated, and the body is full but not filling per se. I cant say enough about this one, everything is dialed in, and its a beer only firestone walker could pull off. its got their signature all over it. I was hesitant and skeptical to see a barleywine so high in the BA rankings, but this makes perfect sense now that ive had it. I will look forward to my next bottle with great enthusiasm! a must try. this is pretty much the end all and be all of the style for me.","StonedTrippin","May 27, 2013"

This transcends the barleywine style as we know it, integrating the best of brandy, bourbon, and American white oak flavors, as well as incorporating a British malty goodness with a West Coast hop grassy profile at the finish. Undeniably complex, and I'm kicking myself for not buying a bottle or two extra to see how a vintage this great would end up tasting in a year or two. Not an everyday beer, but undeniably delicious. Can't wait to try Parabola and DDBA as well, and immerse myself with FW's incredible barrel program! This is pivotal for sure. Every fan of barleywines and barrel-aged beers must check it out.","magictacosinus","May 17, 2013"

Thin lacing of head, and smelled very similar to BCS which I had on the side. The taste is spectacular, probably my favorite barleywine, but I don't typically drink this style of beer. Out of a bottle, it is not so complex, a little thinner, but the flavor is there. It is also quite boozy in comparison to the tap. Makes me think the Sucaba on tap was from a year or more ago.

The barrel aged character of this beer imparted wonderful flavors that balanced beautifully with the beer, although they did seem to take over the beer and mostly use it as a vehicle for barrel deliciousness delivery. I was glad that I was able to split this bottle 5 ways, because with that size of pour I am left excited to revisit another bottle in 6 months or a year. I definitely could not have enjoyed it as much had I finished a bottle by myself, even if the alcohol content was not an issue. Another great barrel-aged offering from Firestone Walker that I would advocate anyone trying.","jdhowe","May 10, 2013"

Kind of a syrup smell too. This is as smooth as smooth gets for a bourbon aged barley wine. Best in class in the bourbon barrel aged beers. This lives up to the hype and would definitely seek this out. Can't say enough positives about the beer.","sjones5045","Apr 12, 2013"

Pours a deep ruby color with a moderate 1-finger head. Smells of sweet malt with bourbon and vanilla overtones. The typical mellow oakiness is also present from the barrel aging. Overall, the flavors are perfectly balanced without any single one overpowering the others. A tad heavy on the sweetness, but absolutely nothing offensive. The 12.5% ABV is present, but fits into the overall flavor profile like the last piece of a jigsaw puzzle. The sweet heat and bite is a welcomed finale to each outstanding sip. A solid A+ for this brew, nothing less. Easily worth the $15/bomber and I'll be looking to stock up on this each and every release.","DrewV","Mar 14, 2013"

4.3,-5.1,4.75,4,4.25,5,4.25,"The beer pours a dark murky red, but when you put it in the light it glows a gorgeous ruby. The beer’s body seems clean, but surprisingly full of carbonation bubbles. The beer pours with a decent sized white head that seems to be turning khaki colored. It mellows down to a half of a finger’s width as the beer sits in the glass. It features nice legs of alcohol as you swirl it in the glass, and leaves little dots of thin slippery lacing on the glass wall. On the nose, the beer smells big and boozy with wonderfully complex notes of plum fruit, toffee, slight raisin and bourbon sweet notes, and even some brown sugar notes. On the tongue, the beer tastes wonderfully sweet and complex with boozy alcohol and lovely mellow toffee and oak notes. The beer begins with caramelly malt that moves into toffee, light bourbon and then explodes into a medley of all those flavors, adding coconut, light oak, very faint char, raisins, dates, and brown sugar. The finish is a little harsh with booze, but also features a maple syrup sweet taste that travels into the sticky aftertaste. You can definitely feel this travelling down the back of your throat, but I think with a bit of age it could be beautifully mellowed, and as is I find the flavors wonderfully mellow while still being big and complex. As it warms up, this beer definitely builds in booziness. On the mouth, the beer feels thick and chewy, but soft and very mellow almost fluffy with the carbonation, almost syrupy. Its body sits on the mellower side of heavy. The mouth is left slightly dry with alcohol and sticky dry saliva. Overall, I’m definitely a fan of this beer. This is one of my favorite Barleywines right now, and I would love to find another bottle and set it away for a couple years. This stuff is thick, boozy, and complex, and definitely a sipper. You should try this beer.","Maxwell","Feb 28, 2013"

Head is still there and seems to have settled slightly however still very active. Lacing is spotty, big-pica-dot pattern left on the glass here, possibly the best looking beer/barley wine for sure I have come across to date. Smell is toffee, high quality dark cocoa, pecan. Taste is Dark chocolate first then toffee, then some ripe pear, chestnut, hazelnut, cashew, then a little roast, red wine and some bourbon with definite oak detected in the finish, with the barrel lending it's impression on this beer. heat from the abc lingers, and adds to the layers of flavor, that go well here (such as adding wine or cognac or vodka in to lend complexity, which may add to complexity and refinement). Sweet but not too sweet, medium bodied, and the malt profile here is impressive. Overall, do yourself a favor and serve this closer to room temp than not. Still and will always probably be my favorite barley wines. Merit is off the charts here. Food that pairs with chutneys, and a rich flavor complex. Nutty cheeses such as aged gouda. Black truffle is going to be a top notch match for this beer. Heavily browned or buttered, and earthy/spice-ful dishes. dried herbs vs fresh herbs; smoked or grilled vs. seared. Something that can stand up to one of the most tasty and complex beers in the world.","Beerswag","Feb 24, 2013"

The head was white and actually stuck around for a little while. There was a light lacing on the glass too. The smell of the beer is sweet and earthy, lots of caramel and toffee notes along with some hops too that I am a bit surprised to pick up. The barrel aging also comes in on the nose too. The taste of this beer is awesome. I can't even explain the kind of flavors I experienced here. There is some serious complexity here. The mouthfeel is very good too, it's super smooth with a nice subtle carbonation to it,. Overall this was great, There is no doubt that I will buy this for myself one day to have it again.

3.58,-21,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"O – I’ve got to say I was disappointed by this beer. I was looking for a big, rich, malty beer but what I got was basically weaker, carbonated bourbon. While I do like bourbon, and I do like bourbon-barrel aged beers, I don’t like my beers to taste only like bourbon. The malt and hops are there somewhat but they are completely overshadowed by the taste and aroma of bourbon and oak. The only reason why this isn’t getting a lower score is because this is what can happen with English barleywines if they’re aged long enough. They lose some of the malt and hop characteristics and take on a more sherry-like or port-like quality. However, while I can understand losing some hops, they should not lose this much malt character. I’m not quite sure what the hype is all about with this beer, but I’ve had better barleywines.","BlackBelt5112203","Dec 02, 2012"

Bourbon is intense though not too much too ruin the balanced though vanilla notes are harder to distinguish.

Very beautiful palate- not too sticky with a nice fruit juicy character and mild sugar. Super yummy dessert beer. Similar to FW11. Shame it doesn’t pour with a head.

A little smoky, a bit of brown sugar, some vanilla and oak, cherries and raisins, coconut, no harsh ethanol, wow I could stick my nose under this all night. The flavor follows the aroma quite well but comes in waves of flavor. Sweet sugary malts up front, a bit of oaky bourbon next, some dark fruits wash in then some earth and sweetness then a bit of warming comes in before a semi sweet lingering finish. Medium to thick body with a light to moderate level of carbonation and a sweet almost ashy or chalky mouthfeel. This one is a sipper that's for sure, but I'm going to spend the rest of the night enjoying the shit out of this.","johnnnniee","Aug 18, 2012"

Maple seems evident on here as well. Smooth, certainly. But as it's a 2011, it could probably use some age to harness some complexity. As it stands now though, it's quite good. Few barleywines are able to get to this point so fresh. And that is worth noting. After several beers before this, and drinking them ""too fast," I wanted a sipper. This is that.

4.42,-2.4,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"The two vintages look nearly identical, a dark reddish-brown with a small white head. The smell is where things start to diverge: the 2012 aroma is fantastic, full of oak and bourbon combined with brown sugar and maybe even some dark fruits. The 2011 aroma is nice, but not nearly as impressive. The bourbon and oak are more subdued and instead it's got more of the standard English barleywine aroma of raisins standing out. The 2012 gets a 4.5, the 2011 gets a 4. The flavor follows the nose in both cases. The 2012 had much brighter flavors with the oak and bourbon mixing in very nicely with the dark fruits and malts of the barleywine, while the bourbon and oak really have faded to the background in the 2011. 2011 tastes more like a standard English barleywine with a little bit of age on it, much mellower and more subtle. Again, I'd give the 2012 a 4.5, the 2011 a 4. Mouthfeel is largely the same in both cases, medium-to-full bodied with decent carbonation. Overall, I think the 2012 really stands out as the superior beer here, while the 2011 is merely good, not outstanding. I had the 2011 fresh and loved it, and the beer just has really fallen off over time. I guess the lesson learned here is not to age this beer - drink it fresh!","starrdogg","May 31, 2012"

Really great flavor, showcases nearly all the wonderful aspects of a barleywine flavor profile while integrating them seamlessly. The alcohol flavor is hidden and this beer does not need any aging.

I pick up figs, barley, roasted malt at first sniff for some reason, a woodiness as well (I guess oak really), some sweet sugary and chocolatey malts as well as a pinch of dark fruit. A plethora of maltiness in as much as this is a thicker, fuller body that borders on syrupy stickiness at times. A bready/woodiness and some roasted malts balance real well with chocolate, careamel, vanilla even a touch of toffee (I think). Can't really say any hop or fruit notes come out, so it's more of just a malt beer so to say. Perhaps the stunner was the 12+ ABV% b/c they really hide it well other than that nice high and dry finish. A little pricey and def a sipper but worth a try by anyone.","clayrock81","Apr 06, 2012"

A lot of bourbon in the nose followed by wisps of vanilla, oak, caramel, and smoke. Just like in the nose bourbon is up front on the taste and with the bourbon flavor is a little alcohol heat not terrible but maybe with some aging the heat will subside a little. There is also a good caramel flavor with vanilla, and some sweet dark fruits. The mouthfeel is very thick and a coats my entire mouth and it seems to stay on my tongue after each drink.

However, this one is till too hot to be top class in my books, being much hotter than the Parabola 002 we drank immediately afterwards. Moreover, the head on this one was just atrocious, reminding me of Rice Krispies doused in Coke. Noisy and obnoxious stuff. While this was an enjoyable beer I’d drink again if it were convenient, for me, Parabola 002 was the superiorly crafted beer in a box. Thanks again for sharing Doops. Good times! As far as the $ucuba 002 goes, it's a solid brew, but nothing worth going nuts over. I would probably still score it the same, though the scores for look and feel would be reversed.

Mildly nutty without the associated astringency, this shows beautiful balance and complexity. Leather and pipe tobacco are present, especially on the finish. Some oak with nice tannins to balance the sweetness on the finish. The barrel is remarkably well-integrated here, it's a very harmonious beer.

You just sip and enjoy the deep complexity. Its very english with a strong and chewy toffee aroma and flavor that seems to meld right into strong bourbon barrel notes.

Loose carbonation makes an apperance but eventually retreats leaving the surface unblemished. Sweet bourbon, rich burnt caramel, crystal malts and toasted oak assault your nose in a great way. Just a great woody, malty bourbon bomb. As expected the taste is in lock step with the nose. Wood (oak), sweet malty caramel, brown sugar bourbon, hit of vanilla, tasting a touch of booze, good times. Pretty full bodied and lightly syrupy. Slightly sweet at the end. Great. So, so, sad I don't have any more of these gems to see how they are in a year or so.","pmlondrigan","Dec 16, 2011"

I don't seem to have the appreciation for bourbon-barrel aged beers that some others do. But it was so complimentary to the other flavors that were going on in this beer, that I didn't find it at all offensive as I normally do.

4.85,7.1,4.5,4.5,5,5,5,"Bottle @ home, courtesy of foppa78 into my new Cigar City snifter, courtesy of markwise. Thanks guys! 2011 vintage. Very deep brown/ruby appearance with a tiny tin head that dissipates in no time. Really a nice, smooth, tobacco, fig, plum, caramel-toffee malty, somewhat sweet aroma that’s exquisite. Tobacco, date, plum, fig, dark fruity, moderate toffee, lighter caramel, fairly malty, bourbon, somewhat woody flavor. Dark fruity, cherry, plum, toffee aftertaste. No hint of the 13% booze- are you kidding me??? In a way, it kind of reminds me of HOTD Matt in its complexity. Simply unbelievable.","adnielsen","Nov 11, 2011"
3.42,-24.5,3,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"O-- Thought much better fresher when I first had it. The barrel notes far more obvious in the nose then. Just starting to develop the jam like qualities that barlewines have. Careful cellaring might be really good for the beer, though I preferred the fresher version much more.

The bourbon doesn't dominate to dissipate the flavors from the barleywine. Very creamy and full. Slightly carbonated, possibly over carbonated IMO. Overall this was very good. I love that it is balanced and that the bourbon doesn't dominate. My main quarrel with BA barleywines is that the oak and bourbon take away from the flavors of the beer itself. This is nice.","1Adam12","Oct 15, 2011"

4.5,-0.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Abacus is a barrel aged Barley Wine. Four barrels in total were selected for the blend. The base of this year’s offering was aged in Heaven Hill bourbon barrels for 3 years! The resulting beer is strong yet extremely elegant and smooth. Big boozy bourbon and American oak aromas combined with soft chocolate malty undertones. Complex malt flavors framed in oak, with hints of dark chocolate, vanilla, tobacco, coconut and just a touch of dark cherry. This is definitely a sipping beer and one of my favorite barleywines next to Old Numbskull.","CuriousMonk","Oct 02, 2011"

Though they're obviously quite different styles of beer, Abacus and Parabola are both very barrel-dominant - I think this is the more successful of the two, as the imparted flavors complement the base beer very well. I'll be curious to see if this improves down the road.","amphion1065","Sep 30, 2011"

4.12,-9.1,4,4.5,4,4,4,"O: A fantastic barrel aged barley wine that was very much enjoyed. Would love to come back to it with a little bit of age. The alcohol was strong, but that is to be expected. One of the better barrel aged barley wines I have had.","CaptainTripps","Sep 23, 2011"
4.3,-5.1,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"This one pours a nice and rich cherried wood in color with a light and fizzy khaki colored head which quickly dissipated. The aromas consist of sweet and ripe dark fruits, figs, light bourbon, oak, vanilla, raisins, and port. It smells pretty good but I could use more bourbon. The flavors are almost exactly what I was looking for tonight. You get a lot of buttery biscuity malt (yet not as intense as a California Chardonnay), light bourbon, oak, vanilla, raisins, figs, and it has a rich and resonating after taste. The bourbon is a little more mellow than I anticipated but it's fine. Overall this is a fine beer and a pretty spectacular barrel aged barleywine. It's an instant favorite and probably my second favorite of the style to only the Mother of All Storms.","aasher","Sep 22, 2011"
4.12,-9.1,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Overall: A delicious barleywine that I was glad to have shared with a couple of friends. At 13%, it would have admittedly been a challenge to finish by myself.

It was so flavorful, smooth, and everything just works so well together. Fantastic beer overall, I loved it.","billab914","Sep 16, 2011"
3.95,-12.8,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Overall, this is a good beer but I think it may have spent a little too much time in the barrel for my personal tastes.

4.97,9.7,4.5,5,5,5,5," Pours a brilliant brown w/ orange highlights and a sliver of a chocolate head. Very little carbonation or lacing, which is expected at a 13% ABV beer. Excellent for the style. Very port-like in appearance. Nose is nothing short of amazing! Malt, chocolate, toffee, some faint fruit, and very mild alcohol smell, oak. bourbon. There's no way the nose gets any better than it is. Wow. Taste is very similar profile. Unbelievable! It's so smooth and drinkable I can't believe it's a 13% beer. Alcohol is almost completely masked in the taste. This is truly one of the best beers I've ever had the privilege of tasting. If you have the opportunity to try this, RUN, don't walk, and pick up as much as you can fit in your car. Undoubtedly a world class beer, and I'm glad I had the opportunity to try it. Cheers!","jayhawk73","Sep 07, 2011"
4.47,-1.3,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"O: This lived up to my expectations indeed. I've read the threads about this fading and I just laughed as I was drinking this.

This beer, though, has such a delicate approach to those flavors – I could really drink it all day. It isn’t my absolute favorite brew, or anything that I think I'd be craving, but it really is a gorgeous beer.

4.59,1.3,4,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Mouthfeel/Overall: Body is between medium and full, and gets exponentially smoother as the beer warms towards room temperature. I have heard several people mention that there is a lot of variation in Abacus bottles; I will agree with this. I have had one other bottle before this and was not nearly as impressed. Interested to see how the others I have turn out. Overall though, this is an exemplary barrel aged barleywine. Very complex and well integrated flavors.","zhanson88","Aug 31, 2011"
4.77,5.3,4.5,5,5,4,4.5,"O: If I could get my hands on another bottle, I would see if aging it would help with the heat v.s. sweetness battle that seemed to be raging on my tongue, but it sure was a treat to have this one to drink just the way it was.","Spica66","Aug 31, 2011"

4.47,-1.3,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"It pours deep brown, almost black as you watch it come out of the bottle, and it develops about a centimeter of cream/white head that consists of large bubbles. There is little retention, which is not surprising given the alcohol content. It smells wonderfully of caramel, toffee, toasted malt, some dark fruits (raisin, date), bourbon, and some faintly bitter hops. Very good first impression. The taste is great: hazelnut, toffee, toasted malt, caramel, and bourbon dominate. Some alcohol is detectable, as are some oak flavors and some muddled, floral hops. Mouthfeel is very smooth, albeit thick, and the carbonation helps it slide off the tongue. There is a lingering warmness from the alcohol. Overall, an amazing barleywine that easily ranks amongst my all-time favorites.","eclipse54","Aug 25, 2011"

Definitely delicious and well recommended if you like barley wines and/or bourbon. Bourbon barrel definitely plays a significant role but it is so well integrated that boozy is not a fair term.

I didn't know much about them ahead of time so basically just bought this out of curiosity. This beer poured black with a thin white head. The aroma was very sweet with notes of vanilla, plum, and burnt sugar. The taste was a little more mellow than expected, not as cloyingly sweet as I thought it would be after smelling the beer. The mouthfeel was very creamy and woody with a nice alcohol burn on the finish. The wood masked some of the assertiveness seen in most barleywines and instead added a lot of complexity to it. I couldn't imagine drinking more than one since my palate was totally exhausted when I was done. This beer was a bit pricey, but it was worth every penny. It was definitely one of the best barleywines I've ever had and I can't wait to try more from this brewery.","jonvan04","Jul 24, 2011"

Sure he was a 4 sport athlete, donated time on weekends to explicitly blind orphans, adopted 5 shelter cats, ran makeshift sickle cell anemia cure test centers in his garage, and had a laundry list of acceptance letters to a litany of schools, but, he was a nice guy. Some would say that he had too much on his plate. He never knew what was going on with Pretty Little Liars, his record collection was woefully wanting for a 17 year old guy, but somehow, his rough translations from Aramaic to Latin to hexidecimal for a new kernel that he was debugging made it all worth it. “Oh sure, we could run scripts under English syntax, if you want spaghetti loops in your DLLs!” He exclaimed in a rare moment of tension while nursing a Koala deftly. “But ultimately, if the kids don’t eat, I don’t eat.” He meant this literally. He had adopted Peter Singer’s theory of ethics and regularly starved himself for days on end, still outperforming all other student athletes. “It’s basically just about being a NICE GUY.” He noted as he put the finishing touches on his double fermented 4Loko batch that was 0 calorie and 0 carb, a gift for his friends for an upcoming soiree against teen inebriation.","SubpoenaDeuces","Jul 08, 2011"

Clearly a decent representation of the American style with it's modest hop inclusion. The alcohol is not hiding in this brew at all, it is forward in both flavor and warming factor. It is a solid brew but I was let down a bit. Perhaps my anticipation and hype built this brew up to something more magnificent than it ever could be. Oh well. I have wanted to try this beer for some 2+ years since I first heard about it. Along the way I got to try a small draft sample and that just didnt satisfy my curiosity. I just about gave up hope of ever getting a real taste (since it was at the time draft only.) Then the announcement came that it was going to be bottled.

Surprisingly light and nuanced for such a big beer. Great oak / bourbon presence. Good chocolate, caramel, molasses, and toffee flavor. Firestone Walker really knows how to use -bal aging to enhance a beer instead of taking it over. Mouthfeel is smooth and approximately medium bodied.

There’s a very strong warming but it’s very pleasant without a trace of burning. The flavor is strong and clear all the way to the end but it’s hard to call it really complex. It’s not a chore to finish nor difficult aside from the abv but it did get almost boring. Fantastic as a single glass so the bottle is definitely something to share.

The nose hits you with a complex mix of rum soaked raisins, figs, buttery caramel, rich toffee, slightly smoked oaky vanilla with a classic fortified wine oxidized/rancio note, really impressed. The taste brings a mouthfilling richness with almond roca, toasted coconut candy, dark caramel and finishes with a satisifying mouthcoating oilyness and just enough carbonation. There is a slight note of alcohol at the end but for being 13% it is barely perceptible at that degree.

4.84,6.8,4,5,5,4,5,"Pours a dark crimson red/dark brown with a very, very small tan head that fades to nothing. The head came out very fizzy, much like a soda. No lacing whatsoever on the drink down. The smell coming off this beer is absolutely fantastic. Caramel, toffee, butterscotch, brown sugar, cherry, coconut, earthy woods all come out of the glass. I spent about 5 minutes just smelling this beer before I even took a sip. Not surprisingly the taste is out of this world. The first taste that I get is toasted coconut. This is followed by sweet caramel/toffee, candied cherries, and very subtle hints of chocolate. There is an aftertaste of some woody notes from the barrels. This beer has a good level of carbonation which I think helps it from being too thick and cloying. This is by far the best barleywine I have ever had. The 13% ABV is really not noticeable at all. The aromas and flavors mesh together amazingly well. I have 2 more of these in my cellar and I can't wait to see how these age. I am going to seek more of these out for sure.","UCLABrewN84","May 05, 2011"

4.29,-5.3,3,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Abacus pours surprisingly dark for the style, it's almost stout black. One or two cherry spots do shine through when the beer is held to light though. The khaki colored head is thin and disappears quickly without a trace. The nose is heavy on bourbon (albeit good, smooth bourbon), with toffee and vanilla in the background. Each sip brings forth a fantastic blend of toffee, milk chocolate, vanilla, toasted coconut, and bourbon. No one flavor consistently dominates, every time I bring the glass to my lips any one of these flavors is liable to steal though. If I had to nitpick though I'd say that the bourbon is just a little too boozy right now. The body is full and rich and creamy, without becoming over the top or lending a cloying sensation to the beer. That may be at least in part thanks to a surprisingly active carbonation that feels quite fine on my tongue. It helps give a life to the beer that is lacking any other opposition to malty goodness. Bottled Abacus is quite good at this still young point in time, but it doesn't quite reach the subtle excellence of both the draft version and what I think bottles will turn into in a few years.","axeman9182","Apr 28, 2011"

We definitely stopped what we were doing a few times to marvel about it.

This beer pours a clear dark mahogany color with an ecru finger surfacing this pretty beer. The aromatics are oak barrel, caramel, fig and raisin. It was actually pretty weak on all those fronts as well. Because the smells were so good is the reason it gets the rating it does. The flavor matches the same with the nose. It good mellow, sweet and has all the characteristics you'd look for in a quality barleywine, but it feels so standard. I think it could have been smoother, but it was still really easy to drink.

3.95,-12.8,4,4,4,3.5,4,"I haven't busted out an abacus since seventh grade math class. Let's hope this beer tops those memories (not much of a challenge, really). It pours a dark garnet-brown topped by a finger of dirty off-white foam. The nose comprises sharp caramel, mild cocoa, graham crackers, and butterscotch. The taste reunites all of these elements, while simultaneously introducing them to a few newbies: ruby red grapefruit, orange peel, and mandarin orange flesh. The body is a solid medium, with a light moderate carbonation and an oily, sorta syrupy feel. Overall, a more-than-solid b-wine, though I'm not sure it deserves all of the praise it gets. Don't get me wrong: this is some tasty stuff, but there are many better barleywines more readily available.","TMoney2591","Apr 18, 2011"

Scent brings wonderul notes of fine burbon, oak, warm vanilla sugar, rich dark chocolate, ripe black cherry, coconut, leather. While beers with this nose tend to be harsh and warm, it was nothing but smooth... all of the flavors blend perfectly. The barrel againg is the star and FW has this method down. While a fantastic malt profile is the base of the beer, I cant get beyond the oak, warmn vanilla sugar, cocount an burbon. While most barelywines seem to go for clean and bright malts, this definitely brings in some from the darker side - chocolate, char, earth and spice present themselves.

Although the bourbon flavor is strong, it's not overpowering and the other flavors are able to stand out. There are also notes of vanilla and toasted coconut from the barrel, mellowing things out. Slightly hot with some nice burning warmth in the finish but the ABV is pretty well masked at 13%. Underneath there is a nice blend of earthy/leathery and sweet malt flavor. Slightly earthy barleywine flavor with hints of sweet caramel toffee, rye and faint cocoa. Vinous with dark fruit flavor, especially dark cherry as well as some grape, plum, raisin and fig.

Caramel, toasted coconut, light oxidation, vanilla, brandy (not sure if any of this was brandy barrel aged, but I get it in the aroma), some light cherry notes, a decent amount of bourbon, some light alcohol, a light leather note, and a bit of oak. The barrels certainly come through in the aroma. All of the different aromas work quite nicely together. The initial taste is sweet with caramel, brown sugar, coconut, and vanilla. Then a little brandy and a light oxidation comes through as well. Bourbon and a bit of leather on the finish with a light bitterness. A light alcohol heat, but much less than you would expect for a 13% beer. Medium-heavy body. Very smooth mouthfeel. Manages to be sweet without being syrupy. Low carbonation works very well for the beer. Overall, a great beer. Probably the best barley wine I have had so far. The barrels certainly dominate the nose and taste, which I quite enjoy.

And at 13.0%, it's going to kick your ass if you're not careful ... and maybe even if you are. Drink this one with food (specifically, with dessert), and don't drink it alone if you can help it. I think this beer could be a lot more if they became a little more focused with the barrel aging, and maybe even a little more focused with the baseline malts and hop profile ... thinking back on the ""big picture"" of this beer makes it even a little more hazy.

4.45,-1.8,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"2011 vintage on-tap at Track 84. Served in a tulip. Pours the color of mahogany with ruby highlights around the the base. Half-inch head is frothy, tan-colored and embedded with pinpricks. Head eventually dissipates into a swirl of foam that coalesces around the edges. Thick swaths of lacing are exposed during the tasting. Nose is incredible - sweet and malty with brown sugar, a dominant toffee character and vanilla notes. Taste follows nose - a little alcohol acridness pleasantly breaks up the sweetness. There's also a hint of cocoa or milk chocolate and perhaps a nuttiness quality (hazelnuts?) as well as a rum or whiskey character. Mouthfeel is medium-light with a lively effervescence that is slightly too assertive for the style and abv. There's also a slight viscosity and some residual alcohol heat at the finish. This is a dangerously drinkable beer at 13% abv. Possibly my favorite example of the style. Definitely a beer that has great cellaring potential. I'd love to see how this beer rounds out with perhaps three years on it.","Jwale73","Apr 05, 2011"

4.67,3.1,4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Wow, didn't think the taste would be better than the aroma but it was. Bold toast flavor, chocolate, raisins, toffee, almonds, flaked toasted coconut in the finish with vanilla and oak. Notes of bakers chocolate. This beer was delicious. A low carbonation helped to bring a creaminess to the beer, making it run down smoothly down the tongue. I could have easily had another one of these if we didn't have to leave so early. Will have to try harder to make it to any bar that has this one next time.","seaoflament","Nov 24, 2009"
3.9,-13.9,4,4,4,4,3.5,"D: mouthfeel draws you back for more more easily than it should be to drink this rich viscous liquid. So points for that but overall not very drinkable.","flannelman808","Nov 18, 2009"
4.97,9.7,4.5,5,5,5,5,"This is the second beer I've had at this event that has simply floored me with its silky rich yummy goodness. Pours deep amber to near dark brown and micro thin tan head. Wow! Another knee buckler aroma with a smooth blended mixture of wood, molasses, rich dark fruity esters and more rich molasses. The wood notes become mildly brighter upon further inspection. The taste is just amazing with some smooth bourbon flowing into deep rich dark fruity esters accented with well rounded smooth wood notes. Just a smooth beer that gets almost velvety for a while. It dries out a tad into the finish.","BigMcLargeHuge","Oct 06, 2009"

4.2,-7.3,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Had this on-tap at Toronado in San Francisco during their anniversary celebration this August. Served in a small Port wine glass. Poured black with little head, very dark stout-like color. Smells sweet, rich and fruity with prunes. brown sugar, dates, slightly roasty and almost tar like on the finish. More tar flavors in the taste, some roastiness, quite bitter- almost quinine like, followed by vinous qualities that are fruity and strong, almost reminiscent of Port wine. On the finish there is a hit of unsweetened black licorice. Strong and thick in the mouth, this beer bears more than a passing resemblance to an Imperial Stout, but with some rich sweet notes of an American Strong as well. I wouldn't really call this a Barley Wine, but whatever it is it's mighty tasty.","Georgiabeer","Sep 19, 2009"
4.62,2,4,4.5,5,5,4,"D - It's a slow sipper, and at 12% it can quickly wear down my sobriety, just as fast as the intense flavor wears down my palate. Just a touch less drinkable than the awesome 10, as this batch seemed a little younger and hotter.","MasterSki","Aug 18, 2009"
4.84,6.8,4,5,5,4,5,"Overall: Exceptional. I tried this @Toronado 22nd party mostly because I saw it won the Toronado BW fest earlier this year. Definitely solid and 12%abv not noticeable. Very dangerous! Similar to Older Viscosity or Bourbon AS. Technically a BW but could almost pass as an old ale, strong ale, or even stout.","bret27","Aug 15, 2009"
4.62,2,4,4.5,4.5,5,5,"About a 10 ounce pour in a plastic cup at Darklord day 2009. Body is a blackish brown mocha tone that hosts only a rim of skim tan head. Nose is brilliant with tones of bourbon and candied, dark fruit based malts. There is a soft rustic hint of a hop profile there also. Loads of bourbon initially flood the tongue. This is quickly followed by a very sweet malt character with tones of dark fruit like raisins and plums. All the time keeping a well balanced background hop character that adds nice zing and balance. Lots of vanilla and even some cordial chocolate show up. Mouthfeel is thick and desert like, very nice. Super smooth and attractively drinkable. This is one of the best Barleywines I have had. Firestone Walker, please bottle this one.","SPLITGRIN","Aug 03, 2009"
4.65,2.6,4,4,5,4.5,5,"Drinkability= Very Drinkable. I could drink this all day. As a matter of fact, I'm on my 6th glass and not looking back. Alcohol is hidden very well in the taste. Very dangerous elixir! Bottle this already...","Grabbin2nd","May 15, 2009"

4.5,-0.7,4,4,4.5,5,5,"Overall: Wow! And this is the stuff that comprised (at least I believe) 40% or so of Firestone 10. A really beautiful beer and a top five barleywine for me as well. Seek this beer out and enjoy. Cheers!","OlieIPA","Apr 26, 2009"
4.5,-0.7,4,4,5,4,4.5,"Mouthfeel is lighter for a barrel aged brew like this, but I think it adds to the experience. Nice level of carbonation and not too syrupy leads to an amazing drinkability factor. I highly recommend making an effort to try this one.","moosington","Apr 24, 2009"

4.32,-4.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Tap @ O'Briens. Poured hazy copper-brown with a flat ring of white bubbles. No lacing. Earthy caramel and bread dough aroma with vanilla, oak, and whiskey. Boozy. Viscous, non-carbonated mouthfeel gave it the character of a liquer. Strong caramel and cherry flavors up front, then moves into the earthy, alcoholic oaken malt flavors. Somewhat of a mix between whiskey and cognac in the background. Long, sticky finish that tastes resiny, but without the bite. Definitely a sipper, but a great one at that.","magictrokini","Apr 21, 2009"

4.79,5.7,4,5,5,4.5,4.5,"Firestone's barrel aged program is showing why it is one of the best in the country, their three blends thus far have been fantastic and same with every beer that makes those up, I just went out to grab a beer after a rough day at work and stumbled upon this masterpiece, wish I knew it about it before because I would have been there when they opened and had several more of these, this beer is going to create some serious hype as it circulates through the state, I cannot wait to have more, highly recommended","Floydster","Apr 10, 2009"

3.42,-24.5,3,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Draught, Boulder Strong Ale Festival. Ruby colored beer. Nose lacks depth, but shows some malt and barrel elements of caramel, toast, toffee. Upon tasting, not a lot from the original beer. Sweet, fruity, barrel accented, but not complex or concentrated. One of the weaker examples of barrel aged strong ale at the fest.","Crosling","Mar 16, 2009"
5,10.4,5,5,5,5,5,"This is definitely one of the best barleywines that I have had and look forward to future availability. Firestone (although seemingly focused on pale ales based on their website) needs to either bottle this or produce/distribute more of this and the Parabola. They're definitely on to something here.","JoeySchlitz","Mar 04, 2009"
4.77,5.3,4.5,5,4.5,5,5,"Pours a dark woody brown with a nice tan head. The nose has bready malts, oak, bourbon, vanilla and subtle flowery hops. Flavor also has a nice whiskey and oak presence over sweet fruity malts and again quiet hops. Full body is well carbonated and drinks easy. Another great brew from Firestone.","rye726","Mar 04, 2009"

4.6,1.5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4,"On tap at City Beer Store. Joey Schlitz had the last glass in the keg. Awesome barleywine. One of the best I've had. Sweet carmel, toffee, and malt flavors. Not a ton of hops. The flavor is not the least bit abrasive. One could accidentally drink enough of these that it would be necessary to call in sick to work the next day. Why doesn't Firestone bottle this?","waltonc","Sep 04, 2008"
5,10.4,5,5,5,5,5,"A different type of barleywine than the sugary high alcohol set (although this one ain't no session beer). Just an awesome beer. Would drink it every night if I could.","abfraser","Aug 28, 2008"

3.68,-18.8,4,3.5,4,4,3,"Draught at The Red in Santa Cruz. Dark brown with some red, and a small head with no lace. Rich, malty, salty, and woody aroma with plenty of alcohol. Dark, alcoholic fruit and a little dark chocolate. Pretty low carbonation, and an oily, slick body. The alcohol component is pretty strong, and the roasted chocolate flavor almost suggests an irish coffee, but this is far better. Pretty dark barley wine, but interesting. A good sipper.","bulletrain76","Jun 02, 2008"
