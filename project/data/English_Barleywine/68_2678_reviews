"2011 vintage on draft, very smooth and balanced."
""
""
"2012 vintage. obviously no hop character left (if there was any - first time having the beer) tons of dark fruit! malty sweetness, dates, figs, plum. Really good."
""
""
""
"Not as strong as I am use to from a barley wine, good flavor from the stone fruits and light bitter finish. Not boozy at all but I kinda like that about a barley wine. Overall not a bad drink, worth having but def not a goto for the style."
"Overall:  This is a phenomenal barleywine!!  Absolutely, fantastically awesome!"
""
""
""
"O- Age has treated this beer well.  This is pretty much exactly what I look for in a barleywine.  Bold flavors of sweetness and an alcohol presence that's noticeable but subdued enough to make for a smooth drink.  Outstanding."

"O- a good barley wine..at time the butterscotch and plum don't mix but good overall."
""
"So I've had many tries at different barleywines and have yet to find one that wasn't a drainpour.  This one by Flying Dog is the first that actually tasted good to me.  No booziness.  No extreme bitter finish.  No medicinal aspiriny aftertaste.  This one was a winner. Highly recommend."
""

""

"OVERALL: Okay. A bit too sweet without the balancing bitterness perhaps, but this is stull full of interesting and complex malt flavor. Definitely a beer for fans of the malty-sweet barleywines, which I am, though even I would like to see a bit more bitterness offered here. Still, a good brew that I rather enjoyed. Give it a try if you have access to it. Thanks again dad!"

"From bottle at Rattle n Hum, NYC. Not the most impressive barley wine I've had. Aroma is OKHead & lacing are non-exisistant & the next thing along that impresesses is the ABV. Super strong but the flavor is in the back seat."
""
"O/D - This is probably past it's prime, but also quite complex and interesting. As it warmed it opened up with much more interesting flavours. Enjoying this one slowly, but the medicinal and syrupy sweetness are a stretch."

"O- I feel like the aging made this one better, but it is certainly a big, sweet barleywine. The depth of the flavor is pretty good and worth a try."
"O: Big flavors, powerful brew, very drinkable, could put you under the table if you're not paying attention."

"Mouthfeel is full bodied, chewy, viscous, and sweet with hot alcohol hanging on in the finish."
""
" Overall; My mouth salivates every time i have this brew. Personal pick for best English style barleywine made in the U.S.A.. Balanced with great length. Looking forward to tasting after aging a few years. (vintage 2011)"

"An impressive take on the style; nicely mellowed with time. Looks great, with a colour not unlike fortified wine. The aroma and flavour are very sweet and fruity, with a subtle hop character that has probably faded somewhat. The bitterness is pitch-perfect. Lovely body - silky smooth. My only complaint is that it's perhaps a bit too sweet, but without a fresh bottle to compare it to I can't judge the extent of the aging process. Nonetheless, a big beer that commands your attention - worth sampling if you have the chance."

"Would not buy again. Unfortunate because Bigfoot was the best barley wine I have had to date."
""
"Pours out a dark maroon in color with a tiny brown head with little retention and no lacing. sweet is of nice sweet caramel malts, candy sugar, dark malts, and maybe a little toffee. Taste is very sweet from the candy sugars, definitely some sweet malts that seem to be malt forward but as many barlywines it is pretty sweet. Mouthfeel is medium thin or maybe a tiny bit thicker. Really this is a decent beer but a little too malty for my taste. Great beer but just a little too malty."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Solid barleywine. I don't know if I agree with the label's claim that it tastes like licorice and chocolate, but I'll pick this up again."
""

"Five years might have been too long for this beer. I just happened to have a fresh one on tap this evening as well, and it was much fuller in body, and ultimately more satisfying. The fresh one was also a much sweeter malt bomb. Two years on this beer might be better, to help temper some of the sweetness, but before it becomes too thin and herbal."

"A very nice beer. iIt was poured from the bottle into the glass. The appearance is very good: not black but dark brown, and with a very nice amount of foam. The taste is also great: a nice sweet taste, with hints of vanilla and coffee and nuts. Nothing to dominant, good balance. Very nice beer!"

"Poured from a bottle into a 16oz plastic champaign flute from BevMo. Poured conservatively, but it build a 1/2"" head that degenerates to lacing after a few sips. Appearance is thick unfiltered honey. Rich, complex aroma. Flavor is bold, hops, some turpentine, and alcohol. Mouthfeel is medium thick, enjoyable. Overall I really enjoy this. I've only had Couple other barley wine style--I especially recall Bigfoot which I really enjoy. This one is very good, but a bit different in character."

"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, 2012 vintage. Pours very hazy dark reddish brown color with a small cream colored head with good retention, that reduces to a thin lace cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of caramel, molasses, toffee, toast, raisin, prune, biscuit, light chocolate, light roast, floral, and toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark malt and fruity notes; with good strength. Taste of caramel, molasses, toast, toffee, biscuit, nuttiness, raisin, prune, chocolate, light roast, floral, light pepper, and toasted earthiness. Minimal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, molasses, toast, toffee, biscuit, nuttiness, chocolate, raisin, prune, light roast, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Awesome complexity and balance of dark malt and fruity notes; with zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very creamy and slick mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent barleywine! Great complexity and balance of dark malt and fruity flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."

"O: Fantastic, probably my bottle has been properly cellared for some time, but I think it would improve further with longer cellaring."
""
""

""
""
"O - This was my first time drinking the Horn Dog, so I have no fresh example to compare it too, but I would have to say this was a great beer. It has a little bit of everything, except noticeable hop characteristics. I don't know if they were there, or just faded over the last several years. I'll have to pick up a fresh one and try it next release. Much of the ""spices"" referenced in the brewery description have aged out."

"I'd buy this again, and may on my way back to Mastadonachusetts.. Another good store lined up for the voyage home tomorrow."
""
"Overall a fairly complex and pleasant example of a barleywine. Got this for $4.99 / 4 pack and am definitely impressed. Will enjoy drinking the other 3."
""
""

""
""
"A good malt complexity and very well hidden ABV along with some aged characteristics I see in my favorite Old Ales. Nothing to complain about and a Barleywine that fans of the style should give a shot."
""
""
""
"OVERALL: A solid American Barleywine, and easier drinking than most. For 10.2% alcohol, there is only a slight evidence in the taste, This was pretty good overall."

"O: This was my first English BW. I wasn't blown out of the water by this, but it is a decent and solid BW that is very drinkable. It is up against stark competition with Bigfoot, however that one is an American BW. There is nothing stellar about this BW but it has no alcohol burn unlike some other ones, which make it ready on day one."
""
"O: sweet and tangy. multi-dimensional. BOOZY. i'm very surprised. i like flying dog well enough, but this is a very memorable barley wine in my opinion."
""
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: Flying Dog's Horn Dog English Barleywine is a pretty great beer. However, it lacks the certain special quality that sets pretty great beers apart from world class brews. If you enjoy Barleywines and Scotch Ales I'd highly recommend seeking this one out because it is sure to please your palate. Would I drink it again? Yes."
""

""

"Overall I like a lot of malt in my beer so I really enjoyed this. Really nice caramel and fruit sweetness with a little bit of an alcohol kick. I will gladly have again."
""
""
""
""
"O: a decent barleywine, but nothing to rave about - nothing wrong with it, but for a 5-year-aged brew, I guess I'm expecting something more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Really tasty barleywine. Well balanced with a nice finish. This is one of the best barleywines I have had for the price."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Looking forward to aging this, the malts are already complex and excellent. One of my favorite English Barley Wines and way underrated."
""
""
""
""
"Horn Dog definitely surprised me. I love the style, and Horn Dog is a fitting example. Recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this has aged fairly well. Lots of fruity esters have emerged, and though the balance is sweet, there's enough bitterness left to round out the finish. Not extremely complex."
""
"Well-blended, enjoyable flavors. Flying Dog just recently pulled out of AZ, so it's nice to still get to try their beers."
""
"The look of this beer reminds me of a flat coke. Carmel color with very minimal head. The smell come through as an intensely sweet barley wine. The taste is actually better than the look and smell which is alway a good thing. It is a very sweet fruity style barley wine that I definitely can see you have to be in the right mood for. Overall it's pretty good for what it is. It is smooth and it is easy to drink this 10%abv that is pretty hidden. Not great but something worth trying."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a tasty, balanced Barleywine."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This doesn't break ground, it's just a rock solid no-frills barleywine. It hits a good balance between being easy to drink and easy to savor. Hey Flying Dog, can we get a barrel-aged version, like, right now?!"
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability : a very good beer in the style Barley wine."

"Very good beer, here, but it's definitely a sipper (as are most barley wines). The booze profile is nice, and while noticeable, it doesn't feel quite like 10% ABV. Deep fruit flavors balance out the burn to provide a nice, heavy dinner beer."
""
""
""
"O - I have passed on this beer time and time again because something has piqued my interest more. This time I decided to snag up a single and I wasn't disappointed. It has a complex aroma with a blend of sweet/tart fruits and roasty malts. It is definitely worth trying, but nothing special in my opinion."
""
""
""
"Overall I really loved this Barleywine. It has kind of made me think of how much I love the style and should drink more of them. Pick this up if you get the chance."
""
""
"2011 vintage. Poured into a goblet from a bottle. Great color and aroma, but the taste was completely lacking. All smell and no flavor. I was so excited after I cracked the bottle open and got that traditional barleywine scent... but nada. At least it was only $3."
""
"Let's hope this beer is saved by its taste. Wow. No fruit. Deep molasses / worcestershire sauce flavours. Different. Not bad, though not initially sold on it either. Some melon comes through over time, but the dichotomy that exists between your nose as you inhale while you sip is hard to overcome. I will go with a good taste here - lots of intricacies in the flavour and nose, but hard to drink. It would be like biting into a beautiful filet mignon and tasting smoked baby backs. Two things that are good seperately, but they sure don't seem right together... Mouthfeel is nice for this style. 3.5/2.5/4/4/2"
"4, 3, 1, 4, 2"
""
""
""
"Overall: this one is one of the more drinkable barleywines out there especially since it keeps the nice malt flavor. the alcohol is well masked. These characteristics are likely due to this being a 2009 or 2010 bottle from their ""cellar""."
"2008 vintage. 7oz bottle poured into a snifter. Thanks! Brown and opaque with reddish highlights near the edges. A finger of tan froth lingers for a minute. In the nose I find a blend of toffee and caramel with a whisper of chocolate. There's some brown sugar and earthy hop character. On the whole, it's well balanced and not overly aggressive. As the label states, there is a bit of licorice, which is an unusual attribute for the style. The malt profile is rich, complex, and inviting. There's a bit of umami character and light oxidation. The quality of the flavor mirrors that of the aroma, though bitterness is a bit stronger than the nose suggests. Dark toffee blends with dried date, caramel, brown sugar, and a lower moderate bitterness that attacks the back of my tongue. Alcohol is restrained, considering it's above 10%. The beer is upper medium in body with upper medium carbonation. The mouthfeel is smooth and sticky with pleasant alcohol warming on the palate. All told, a nice American Barleywine that displays balance and graceful aging."
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, strong kick, good representation of style, this is a solid beer worth sipping on for a while if you’re in the mood for the style."
""
""
""
"O: Good intentions, but mediocre execution. Might be good to cook with, but too much booze for me to drink more than once. I’m digging the hop presence though…could use more barleywines with that flavor profile."
""
""
""
"Low B"
""
""
""
"Overall: A solid take on the English Barley Wine. Nice dark fruit taste and the subtle spices add a nice kick."
""
""
""
"Pours an almost opaque super dark brown with a 1 inch foamy dark khaki head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. A nice latticework of lace forms around the glass on the drink down. Smell is very malty with some subtle caramel/toffee aromas and alcohol. Taste is of malt, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, and citrus zest on the finish. There is a very mild citrus zest bitterness on the palate that quickly fades after each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good barleywine but has a better taste than smell in my opinion."
"O - There are better representations of the style, but despite its down-sides, this is a good beer that doesn't break the bank. Worth checking out."
""
"This is a decent barleywine. It has a solid, complex flavor and a strong, warm, alcohol, sipping mouthfeel. It's worth checking out."
""
""
"This brew is medium-bodied with just a light crispness that leads to a rolling, creamy smoothness."
"Good balance and subtlety from Flying Dog which they usually aren't known for. Overall a smooth and malty brew though."
"The small bottles always make me laugh, but theyre a good idea. Very murky brown with no head, but I think the age has killed it a bit. The smell isnt all that great. Super dry grains, sweet caramel and toffee, but its just all dried grains. I bet fresh thing smells like caramel corn. Now the taste isnt that bad. Very very sweet cereal grains that are dominated by caramel and toffee. Dried barley comes in a bit. What I see is a glaring absence of roasted or toasted malt. Its definitely syrupy sweet, and probably was more so in its hayday."
""
"Overall - I really enjoy this barleywine, and will enjoy this again. There is a wonderful balance and comlexity here, and i really enjoy the flavors. In fact, I love, and highly recommend any of the Flying Dog big bears, i/e their DIPA Double Dog and Imperial Porter Gonzo are also huge robust beers, and must tries."
""
""
""
"O: This is a killer barleywine. Really nicely balanced, very drinkable with the alcohol hidden well, and most of all tasty."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Says ""VINTAGE 12 CC"" on the label but I think it's over the hill already. Bought the 12 oz bottle from Best Damn in San Diego."
""
""
""
"MOREY’S BOTTOM LINE: Probably the most balanced Barleywine that I’ve ever had. They can be too sweet, too thin, too hoppy, medicinal, and often times too heavy on the alcohol. Horn Dog has just the right amount of sweetness and you can’t taste the ABV at all. It’s easy to see why this one continues to win medals. This and Raging Bitch are easily my two favorite beers from Flying Dog. Get some."
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice beer.. I've had it before, but it's been awhile. Flying Dog excels with bigger beers, IMO. This might not be their best work or a mind blower, but it's a pretty nice beer."
""
"O: You would expect this to be a strong beer with all of the malts but the alcohol is nowhere to be found in the taste. It is very drinkable for the style and I would have no problem having a few of these (even if it came in a larger bottle)."
""
""
"Drink- Just okay. Maybe a fresher bottle would have been better."
"Happy birthday Rachmaninoff, you would have enjoyed this."
"O: A good beer. Not so great paired with hotdogs, but that was my bad anyway. A good offering from Flying Dog."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A solid barleywine but not spectacular. I would have another one if it was fresher."
"The description mentions flavors of chocolate and licorice are noticeable, but I could not sense any of this. I’d say pass on this one."
""
""
"Bottom Line: If you like barley wine beer this one is worth it's price tag for sure."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The body is a little too light for the style and the sweetness is a little cloying, but the huge dark fruit notes are awesome and the sweet caramel and toffee are great too. Very tasty with age, but maybe a little less would provide some bitterness too."
""
""
""
"Bottle marked Vintage 12AA"
""
""
""
"Two year old properly cellared bottle. Poured into an Ommegang flute. Pours a dark copper orange amber, thin head slowly dissipates into a ring around the glass, light lacing. Aroma of caramel malt, dark fruit, definitely a barleywine. Taste follows with caramel malt, dark fruit, well integrated. Finish is smooth, but with faded hops and a distinct alcohol burn. Medium bodied. Hops I noted in the earlier review are faded. A decent English stiyle barleywine, but this 2 year old bottle has faded in flavor, but not mitigated the alcohol flavor. I think I prefer this one fresh. I wish Flying Dog had not left the Washington market, this is one of my favorite barleywines."
""
""
"Overall pretty interesting and a good to go barleywine."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Kind of reminded me of Rochefort 8 with amped up malt. Really tasty and smooth -- haven't tried one fresh and would be interested to see what some more hop character might add."

""

"O - Cleverly suprised at how delicious and complex this is! Great job, Flying Dog!"
""
""

"I don't have any notes, so I'm going by memory here. I remember everything pretty much being good and in order with the beer. It was dark and had nice head retention, smelled and tasted like dark chocolate (not the licorice like the bottle said) and had a very nice feel to it. I definitely remember it being *mild* in terms of other barleywines in every category. But that means smooth, and it was very easy to drink at the abv. Good beer. No shit."

"Overall: I had this beer with dinner and it was a very enjoyable barleywine. It was quite complex, the finish reminded me of a Danish pastry."
"Overall, it's definitely an enjoyable brew, definitely suitable for long-term enjoyment, with its high alcohol content. I just think it could benefit from having a little more complexity to keep it more interesting during that time."
"2009 vintage poured into my DFH sniffer. Nice full 1/4 inch head. Decent carbination and lacing. The smell is very sweet, fruity and mouth-watering. Taste is very full, with lots of raisins, figs, and pears. Is this really 10% ABV? Not hot at all, could drink this all night long, for better or worse. I have to say this is one of the better barleywines that I have tried. Flying Dog brews some good beers, but this is my favorite. I have had the 2010 and 2011 vintages, but sitting in the cellar for over two years has really done this brew good. If you see it, you should probably grab some for now, and some for later."
"O- very good barley wine ale that doesn't have a really strong overpowering taste like some. Very round, somewhat sweet, caramel/malty overtone that is smooth and great to drink, not sip. The alcohol is hidden well and is not very noticeable which is nice. Great beer overall, very impressed so far with the few Flying Dog beers I have tried"
"Overall - This is probably the oldest beer I've drank so far and it has held up very well. It was very smooth and very drinkable. I'd like to get my hands on some more of this."
"o 3.5 at first i thought this might be a homerun, as the barleywine style seems to target fd's wheelhouse. but one bottle on a rare occassion is sufficient..."
"Overall: Surprisingly smooth beer that is very malty yet maintains enough balance to be quite drinkable."
"D ~ I rated this against Barleywines as a whole. This one was Well crafted. I Will be buying more of these for the upcoming season. Enjoyable to the last sip. One of the best Flying Dog offering I have ever had."
"Again, another topnotch brew from Flying Dog. I laid down the reminder of the 4 pack in my beer cellar, so I should be enjoying this offering periodically for years to come. I have been dieing to do vertical tasting notes on Ba, but it doesn't seem their format supports it."
"O: Pretty nice. 4"
"Overall, this is a decent barleywine, having well-cultivated flavors and a nice balance. It doesn't necessarily stretch the boundaries or surprise the tongue, but it is quite tasty."
"I'm very pleased with this purchase, I don't know if this has spent the past four years on the shelf or if it was in a cooler, either way it has held up as well as anyone could hope in a semi controlled environment. Would I pick this up again? Sure would. Will I find this on the shelf for $9.56 with four years on it ever again? Probably not!"
"overall pretty decent beer, i seem to remember this being much more boozy the last time i had it but with a few years it settled nicely."
"Overall, this is a good beer, and is probably my favorite from Flying Dog. Not the best barleywine I've had, but it fits my tastes nicely. Thanks to the price and accessibility, this is one of the relatively few beers that I've sought out at the store several times."
"Im surprised this came out of Flying Dog. They're beers are hit or miss for me, horm dog is a big hit for me at least with three years on it. I wish this was a 12oz bottle."
"Overall: This beer is a bit unbalanced, but not unpleasant to drink."
"Overall, very decent; not my favorite of this style, but certainly a good value (in dollars, too!)"
"I'm not usually a barleywine person, but when I saw one coming from a brewery as large as flying dog (and at that price) I had to bite. I don't regret it; it's not crazy or off the wall, but it does a darn good job for the style."
"This beer is enjoyable and has ignited an interest in barleywines for me. I think I'll age a few and see what happens..."
"this beer is bursting with caramel and vanilla. The smell is deep vanilla and molasses. The flavor is sweet with rich caramel flavors. I was expecring it to be rougher- more like a barleywine, but it does agreat job of balancing that ballpark with smooth drinkability. This is one of my new favorites."
"Not the best barely wine out there, but a fairly good one for the price. Worth drinking!"
"Notes - As an introduction to this style, I am not sure how good of a beginner this one is, but I don't dislike it. I think the alcohol is masking a lot of the sweetness that this style should have and may do very well with age. I bought a four pack and will be saving the rest of them."
"Pours a rich amber with a thin white head that dissipates as quickly as it came. Very malty smell and some chocolate smells. Thick smokey malt with some chocolate and what I gather to be licorice. There is a bit of a hop note but it is very faint. This is quite pungent as is to be expected by a barley wine style beer. It leaves a very smokey flavor on the palette and is overall a very grainy concoction."
"O: I really liked how dark and vinous this barleywine is. It has the doppelbock and Belgian Dubble/Quad qualities with the dark fruit esters, brown sugar, and licorice. I'm not really sure if the malt base was ""lacking"" or that there was enough sweetness to completely cover it up. While it's memorable, it didn't quite blow me away. It's a really good, dark barleywine that I'll definitely be buying again."
"A fairly good barleywine. Better than most up here in Canada but not really a standout overall."
"O: Awesome barley wine. A nice sipping beer @ 10% alcohol by volume."
"D - Great taste and solid brew; great body; good balance of flavors; let it sit in your mouth for a bit and let the flavors coat your palate (feel becomes very active); enjoy slowly, sip after sip"
"The Horn Dog was split with a couple friends of mine, none of them liked it at all. I didn't find much wrong with it. The beer poured out as a deep amber color with a light yellowish colored head. The lacing was pretty thick at first, then it died off. The smell was sweet, hoppy and had a hefty amount of booze on the nose. The taste was of sweet roasted caramel and alcohol up front that faded into a bitter hop aftertaste. The mouthfeel was pretty thick which is fine by me. The overall outlook I have on this is that it's a pretty decent barley wine. For someone who hasn't tried many you could give this one a shot and see what you think."
"Poured a deep amber-brown color with very little head and almost no lacing on the glass. Fairly clear consistency. Smelled of sour cherry and caramel. Tasted sour-sweet in front - sourness of apricot and sweetness of toffee - with lots of malt and hoppy bitterness following. Strong booziness showing through. Mouthfeel is medium weight. Finishes with a lingering biter booziness. The high ABV of this beer is definitely apparent and there are some bold tastes in this one, but overall it's pretty enjoyable. Not one that I would knock several back of, but a solid barleywine."
"Careful. Lot's of alcohol in this one."
"Sweeet! As a big fan of barley-wines, I am shocked at how accessible this version has been made to be. It's a great starter BW - Fisher Price: My First BW. Only a subtle tinge of hops - mostly malt, alcohol, and Sweeet! Poured rm temp into a chalice it looks beautiful. The head dissipates quickly leaving an 1/8 inch bit of bubbles on top that stays there for the rest of the drink. Solid lacing. Smells like weak Sambuca (weak on licorice - not alcohol!) and cocoa butter, like it says on the bottle. The taste is surprisingly sweet - a mainstream barley-wine. Unlike it says on the bottle, it is not big or robust. It is tame on taste, straight-forward on complexity, and sweet! I mean, it's not a sugar bomb, but it's sweet for the style. It tastes like liquid alcoholic candy, not a bad thing for some - not what I was hoping for from the makers of Raging Bitch. Maybe I should try some at a lower temp. Has a touch of spice as it lingers in the back of my throat. As a side note, the carbonation is spot on. I love the mouth feel. Could be a session BW, just have to find the right food pairings (warms quickly, WATCH OUT and eat often). Next on the list, Lagunitas WTF and So. Tier Aged IPA. Good luck and good beer."
"O-Not as complex or robust a flavor as I would have liked. Sweeter than what I am used to. There are better barley wines out theres, as well as better Flying Dogs (such as Raging Bitch and Double Dog)"
"Ok, a little lackluster compared to other beers of the style. Not bad overall i suppose."
"Overall: I have enjoyed this very much. It's really very delicious and while the 7oz size is nice for a big barleywine, I think I would like to have had a few more ounces of this. By far, it's the best beer that I've had from Flying Dog."
"O- This is definitely worth a pick up if you like barleywine. It's by far the best thing I've had from Flying Dog. I'm impressed for sure. I'd never guess it's a 10.2% beer. Very smooth, and easy to drink. Highly recommended!"
"Overall an average or better barleywine."
"Overall: Very solid English Barleywine. Despite some fairly good flavors overall, it just doesn't come together quite as well as I had hoped. While this is quite enjoyable, there are many other Barleywines I would reach for first, or would even rather have Flying Dog Double Dog, which has some Barleywine-like qualities."
"Another Flying Dog revisit, though I can barely even remember drinking it the first time. It pours a clear dark ruby topped by a finger of dirty off-white foam. The nose comprises buttery biscuit, caramel, light leek, and a generally mild mix of pine and cilantro. The taste holds notes of caramel, orange peel, dark greens, and raisins. The light spiciness of the greens doesn't seem to meld entirely well with the much stronger sweetness. The body is a hefty medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a chunky-ish feel. Overall, a nice b-wine, though I'm not sure the elements really come together all that successfully. I don't dislike this beer, but I'm pretty sure I'm not gonna be seeking out very often in the future."
"Enjoyed on 04/10/11. Snifter glass. Pours dark copper color & rubi sides to the light. Crown is beige, dense, small bubbled and medium lasting, if fading recovers clickly when twisted. Nice toffee, toasted malts aromas also felt in lips. Warm chocolate & dry nuts notes in mouth, overall presence of alcohol. A litte burning sensation hidden by dry sweet bitterness. Rum, dark fruits on the aftertaste, caramel & molasses too. Full body & very good balanced carbonation. Very nice drinkability. Suggested getting along with a good roast T-bone steak & baked potatoe."
"I'm thinking about picking up a bottle or two and seeing how they age down the line."
"Overall - A pretty good barleywine... rich and warming - perfect for a winters evening... recommended..."
"D: my first formal review of a flying dog brew, but probably my new favorite brew from these guys. maybe im just a sucker for english barleywines, but this one holds on with the big guys."
"Overall, this is, or has peaked I think. Have 07-09 left to try and will attempt to get a 2010, but willing to bet its going to start its downhill turn soon."
"O - Definitly a sipper and worth a try. ABV well hidden"
"Glass is filled with a nice dark brown liquid. Thin tan head disappeared quick and left very little lacing. This beer smells of nice maltiness, maybe some caramel, and some dark fruit. Not much in the way of hops. I detect the same flavors in the taste. Perhaps a touch of honey is noticed. Still not much of a hop presence but I'm OK with that. This beer has a full body and as it warms only seems to get thicker. Low carbonation. This is a decent barley wine- a cold night sipper for sure."
"Overall I thought this was a nice barley wine. It had all the components I would expect from an American barley wine, but since this is classified as an English barley wine I was expecting this brew to be more hop forward, but it wasn't. Still a pretty good brew though, it hit the spot on a cold snowy night. I would for sure buy this again, chalk this one up as a hit flying dog."
"Impressive great beer."
"not a bad work from the people at flying dog"
"For such a high ABV, this brew does hide the alcohol very well. I kind of miss it in this brew. Something in this brew just didn't mix right. I might have missed out on this brew, because I purchased about 3 months ago, so I should have waited a bit longer and it might have given some time to make this brew better. Again, it wasn't a bad brew, it just seemed to lack that traditional barleywine burn. I think I might pick up another one, and let it condition a bit longer. Otherwise a decent brew."
"I like that this was in a 7 oz, made it much easier to finish, I think 12 oz would have been a lot. Nice, simple Barleywine."
"D-- Really the 207 ML bottle is almost perfect in a way. Could do two of the 207's in a sitting and push the limit a bit. Or stay with one and just plain enjoy it. It is a slow sipper and would go very well with cheese to end the night. Very well hidden ABV to this. Due to the age is is in very good condition right now and the fruits will keep developing even more. Note: More and more I think the Tasting pack is pretty good value. Paid $23 for it in Sydney. Get 3 good beers in the Double Pale, Imperial Porter and the Barley Wine. Triple is pretty forgettable."
"This beer is HUGE. I'd throw it up against some creamy goat cheese and see how it holds up. Absolutely fantastic and my hat's off the the guys at Flying Dog."
"Definitely English-style in that it's smaller than some DIPAs (Maharajah comes to mind) and malt forward. Not especially hot, but then again, also not flavorful enough to justify the ABV. A sipper"
"Thanks to BucketBoy for throwing this one in as an extra. Cool little 7oz. bottle served in my Duck-Rabbit snifter. Vintage 0811 printed on the label. Pours a hazy, brownish plum with a loose, off-white head that quickly disperses towards the shoulders forming a bubbly band. Some spots of lacing present during the tasting. Huge malt bomb of a nose - figs, prunes, molasses, brown sugar and a distinct bready quality. Taste consistent with nose; however, a slight candied quality also comes out in the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is medium-light with a mild carbonation. A dangerously drinkable barelywine at 10.5% - virtually no trace of alcohol here; good thing it comes in small bottles. One of my favorites, hands down, from this brewer."
"I'd recommend it, and I can only see it getting better with age."
"D- Nice little english barleywine. Nothing too special but a solid barleywine that's great on a cold night."
"Mouthfeel is really really slick, but I think it has a lot to do with the carbonation not really being there. This probably has something to do with it being old."
"Knowing that this is an English barleywine I expected it to be less hoppy, but to my taste a little dose of hops would have gone a long way in balancing out this sweet malt monster. A bit too sweet for my hop-head tastebuds."
"D-very solid barleywine, I have had better. not sessionable. Only share with fellow beer geeks/snobs. I think many novice beer drinkers would be turned off by the big alcohol malt taste."
"Overall a good beer for the price and fits my craving for an English style BW. I would like to see better bittering, more aging, and more head retention."
"D-good representation of an english barleywine, but not my favorite style. Much too sweet for me to want to buy again."
"12 ounce bottle, vintage 08CC. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a cloudy brown/orange color with a very small off-white head. The aroma is sweet and boozy (but also a bit weak), it smells like caramel, toffee, brown sugar, figs and booze. It tastes like caramel, sweet malt, figs, booze and some hops. Alcohol heat is noticable in the taste. The beer also has a bitter finish, I was expecting it to be sweeter. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit syrupy and has moderate carbonation. Drinkability is OK, it's not hard to drink at all. I think this is a decent enough beer, but I wouldn't drink this very often."
"personally i am not thrilled with this but can not say its a bad beer, for 10% it hides it very well."
"Poured from the bottle into a snifter a dark ruby red with one finger of tan head. Smell was malty with a light dark fruit presence. Taste is slightly raisin in nature with a very malty backbone. Feel is smooth but crisp with a medium to full body. Overall an enjoyable barley wine that I will not turn down."
"Poured into a snifter. The color is a moderate copper with a slight white head that fades away quite quickly. The nose is a bit of sweetened malt, light fruits, cherries, and moderate caramel. A bit of booze there as well. The flavor is a bit of sweetness and caramel with mild fruit and booze. Feel is big enough to handle a good dose of alcohol. Drinks well enough but needs some age to really shine."
"D: Barleywine is not my favorite style by any means, but I liked this one. Sweet without being sickening, alcoholic without being retch inducing, with fruity notes that were fresh and refreshing. I will keep this one in mind if ever I fancy a Barleywine."
"rich velvety mouthfeel, very, very drinkable"
"D: I really wasn't expecting this... age has created a masterpiece out of this one. A bit of booze in the nose but not really at all in the mouth. Immense complexity and the silkiest smooth mouthfeel that I've come across in a long while. Buy a case of this one fresh and sit on it. An amazing beer!"
"I like this beer, and appreciate Flying Dog taking a crack at the english version of this big style."
"My first review, here goes it! Pours a rich copper color. I get a good bit of maltiness in the smell but it's not overwhelming. The taste is a good amount of fruit and some alcohol. This brew has a very rich yet complex taste that takes a few minutes to really wrap my head around. The mouth feel isn't as heavy as I was expecting. The Horn Dog is dangerously drinkable. I will definitely buy it again!"
"Fabulous beer for the price. Very, very nice!!"
"Pours a dark coppery body with a medium, short-lived off-white head. Aroma is licorice and fruity like raspberries, strawberries and hints of pine. Taste is similar to Sierra Nevada, lots of licorice/cough-syrupy flavors with fruity and piney elements scattered around. Complex and nice, just like a barley wine is supposed to be. I applaud this effort."
"Great low creamy carbonation."
"D: For 10.2% ABV this is a very smooth drink. There is almost no hint of alcohol. A very good quality barleywine, very smooth but that could be due to the slight aging."
"Drinkability: Smooth drinking is diminished somewhat by a high alcohol flavor and dryness. Still, it's not a bad beer. I could drink one or two of these."
"Beer poured a hazy reddish-brown with a decent off white head that has dissapated. Nose is sweet bread and candy and some northwest hops. Taste is very unbalanced to the sweet side, red licorice dominates with some chocolate lingering in the background, not enough hops to balance this sweet malt bomb. Mouthfeel is full bodied and smooth across the palate. Drinkability is OK, definitely a sipper. Not a bad beer, just too sweet for my taste."
"Overall a very pleasant offering. To be honest this is my first barleywine, but after tasting Flying Dog's version I am more than willing to try more."
"This pours a deep cooper, pretty opaque, or at least it seems so in my not-very-bright room. Almost no head. The nose is bready with a subtle sweet note, not as overbearing as some other malty brews. In the mouth it's slightly sweet, with a good deal of booze and some woody notes. It's a medium-full bodied beer. At this alcohol level you might not be drinking many of these, but I could put back two without it overpowering the palate. Good beer. My third of the Canis Major series, and to me not as good as the imperial porter or the DIPA, but a good beer nevertheless."
"An average bw."
"Drinkability: High for a 10.50% beer. Goes down easy, well-balanced. One of my favorite barleywines."
"Notes: My wife, the hophead, took a sip and shuddered, saying ""gross."""
"M/D - Mouthfeel is very think and the heat from the alcohol is apparent. This is a reasonably drinkable barleywine, but because I can only get this in an 8 oz. bottle and it's pretty average for a style with some real standouts, I probably won't be buying this again."
"D: you can really taste the alcohol, but it is a barleywine with a high ABV..it is very good and I think it is a solid representation of the barleywine style"
"D - This is a pretty tasty barleywine! I could see how the alcohol (ABV and taste) might turn some off, but I really enjoyed it and will probably pick some up again given the chance."
"D - Eh, I wouldn't go for more than one in a night, but it is a pretty good and unique brew. I haven't tried too many barley wines, but I wouldn't go as far to call this drinkable."
"A sticky mouthful of chocolatey malt, liqorice, molasses and sweet alcohol honey. I'm really enjoying this. Alcohol starts to show itself after a while but this is delish. Dessert wine-like in it's decadence. Dip me in honey and throw to the lesbians and I'll be a happy man."
"D: probably keep it at one"
"Very smooth character. The alcohol is nowhere to be found...but it's definitely there. Huge malt with moderate chocolate flavors. The bottle says vintage 09 on the bar code, so I'm assuming it's from 09. I'll keep a few around for a another year or so."
"D - At 10.2% alcohol it's scary how easily this goes down. Delicious but not the best barley wine I've ever tasted."
"An amazing beer right here. Had this with a couple of steaks. Honey is you're key word here. It tastes like downing a stick of solid honey. Very Strong alcohol taste to be prepared for it and thick taste so know it wont be fading away soon. ask neighbors to get used to it so you can have a few to yourself."
"M/D: Sweet and huge, but surprisingly not as heavy or cloying as expected. This is a huge beer but it lacks the huge syrupy filling feeling that others like it usually have. Extremely drinkable for such a huge barleywine. Goes down very easily. This one will catch up with you quick. Very well-done, I'm really impressed."
"D: A Flying Dog variety pack was one of the most disappointing purchases in recent memories, but this beer has changed my mind about the brewery. I really enjoyed it. *Very* sweet, too much for me to drink often, but on the plus side, it completely conceals the alcohol content."
"D: For a 10.2% ABV beer this is extremely drinkable."
"I enjoyed it. Didn't really know what to expect. This was my first barley wine. dark colored, I could barely see through the bottle holding it up to the light. could feel the abv on the way down. slightly dry in the mouth, but overall great flavor ."
"D: Very smooth and enjoyable. Easier to drink than expected from a Barley Wine ... Style."
"Bottle poured into a pint glass. Ruby red and clear, it pours with a medium head that quickly disappears. No lace is left. Very noticeable fusel alcohol aroma. Alcohol front and middle with sweet finish. Malty sweetness starts in middle through finish. Medium-heavy mouthfeel."
"D- Strong alcohol notes, decent flavors but overall not something I would necessarily seek out again."
"What a big, sweet, sticky beer this is, but thankfully there is enough hop flavour and bitterness to balance. A highly enjoyable barleywine for me, if not outstanding."
"Drinks ok, but the warmth overwhelms the flavors and makes this pretty much a one and done at this point. Not bad, but not one to really seek out either."
"One finger light tan head, quick dissipation, leaving a scant bit of head on top of garnet/amber clear body, no visible carbonation. Quite malty in the nose, on the sweet side, mild flowery hop notes which also comes across in the malt-forward taste profile, not very bitter, close to style. Mouthfeel is medium-full, decent effervescence and quite sticky. Not sure I'd do more than one of these, but a nice nightcap and good interpretation of the style."
"D- Very nice but not sure how often I'd revisit with the alcohol smell and aftertaste so I give it a slightly above average drinkability"
"D: A hefty barley wine on the label that doesn't have the feel of a 10.5% heavyweight; flavor is still good but not amazing whatsoever. A bit of a disappoint, though 'drinkable' enough...albeit not impressing to the point that I'd choose to run out and buy more for the cellar. Maybe better fresher?"
"Pours a slightly dark amber/ruby with an inch of tan head that quickly dissipates to a thin veil. Smells pretty boozy. Alcohol, grape, anise, and a caramel/butterscotch malt note in the nose. Not a lot of hop presence in the taste. Lots of malt presence in this tasting of a buttery toffee. There's also a dark fruit taste. It has a slightly viscous feel and a surprisingly clean finish. I'm generally a hophead, but I found the subdued hopping of this beer to work very well."
"Horn dog is a decent barley wine especially if you don't like it overly malted. It's sweet and has some good flavor but it's mostly fairly subdued. It has very little spice flavor if any but it had a good hop flavor with the finish. Not a bad barleywine and perhaps since this is listed as an english barleywine, I'm just not familiar with the difference."
"Dark ruby red pour with a 1cm off white head. It smells like a wine, with hints of licorice and alcohol. I was surprised to find some cocoa and coffee flavors along with the licorice and alcohol in this beer. In addition to these flavors there was also a lot of fruityness. This beer is medium bodied and very smooth with a slight carbonation. This beer is not greatly drinkable due mostly to the high alcohol content which is pretty apparent. Overall unremarkable, but competent beer."
"This is an excellent example of a sweeter barleywine. The American versions often tend to make a super-strong IPA as their top-ABV brew and label it a barleywine. But this is really coming in strong from the malt side of things, leaving a smooth, sticky, sweet and undeniably wine-like barleywine. I approve heartily."
"It's certainly far from terrible but has a ways to go before it hits great."
"D: I'm gonna say good, cause this is not my favorite style. I enjoy the ones, like this one, that aren't ""off"" or too hoppy. Honestly, this is one of the better american ones."
"Overall a pretty darn decent barley wine that I suspect would improve greatly with age."
"Overall, Horn Dog is a smooth example of an English barleywine but not as bold as I'd hoped. Regardless, it's a very enjoyable brew and I would certainly drink it again given the opportunity."
"Yum, a really nice Barleywine. Sure, I love the highly hopped American types but this sort of hybrid English-American Barleywine is great."
"Drinkability: Ah... drinkability. I enjoy drinking this, I really do, but barley wines aren't really my thing, so I feel unworthy to judge this. I will say this is my favorite barley wine, and I'd probably drink more than one a given drinking night, if I had more than one."
"Drinkability was good. Could down acouple of these in a session. Not the best in it's style but one of the cheapest and worth cellaring for acouple years down the road."
"D: like barleywines and I think this one stayed true to it""s style. I enjoyed it."
"A: Dark brown with a deep ruby hue, a solid finger of thick mildly creamy head, crystal clear and with some visible viscosity especially with a swirl of the glass - 4.25, S: Lots of dark fruit aromas, signs of prune and dark raisin, thick molasses like sweetness, there are also some syrupy aromas that remind me of fruit cake dough, alcohol is evident but doesn't overpower, some slightly spicy aromas are evident - 4.00, T: Very sweet from a heavy malt base but balanced with a solid hop bite, the tail end of the beer is packed with a spicy hop bite, like the nose the alcohol is noticeable but not disruptive, some brown sugars and rum soaked dates - 4.00, M: Full-bodied and creamy - 4.50, D: A very enjoyable and drinkable Barley Wine, one I would drink again - 4.50"
"D- Overall, one of the better barleywines on the market in my opinion. Very tasty, highly recommended!"
"Overall: The mouth feel is slightly carbonated, a little warm, a tad astringent, and creamy. The body of the beer is medium full and the finish is medium full. This is a good English Barleywine has a lot of complex flavor and depth."
"I'm assuming this is 2009 vintage, as I have never seen it in these parts. Pours into the tulip a nice, dark red with mahogany hues. Head is large from a semi-aggressive pour, recedes slowly into a thick ring 'round the entire glass. Nice lacing present, though it slowly sinks down into the brew. Smell on this is a bit on the alcoholic side. Very malty and sweet scent. Surely not something I'm used to, but is not entirely unpleasant. Taste is strange on this one. Has a sort of bittersweetness to it, followed up swiftly with an alcoholic overtone. I suppose there could be hints of chocolate and black licorice, though it is difficult for my palate to discern. Horn Dog has a surprisingly light feel about it, for such a ""heavy"" brew. Just right with the carbonation, has a slick feel that goes down maybe too easily. Good drinkability for a good brew."
"Drinkability: Not one of the more bombastic english barleywines but still drinkable. I'd like to get this on tap if possible to see if there's any difference, overall this beer is pretty good. This beer should be drank now, don't bother aging it, probably wouldn't do much good."
"Overall, a good EBW that I recommend. Only had 4 in this style and this would be in middle tier for me as that while it was good it didn't really jump up and say drink more of me. Avail/Rot - available here in TX. Might get the rare single every few years to try [O;N]"
"D - I like a few of Flying dogs beers and this one isn't one of them. I would have much rather enjoyed the gonzo again even though compared to this this the gonzo was watery."
"Overall, this is a very good barleywine. It is quite complex and delicious. I will definitely seek out more of this. Another solid offering from Flying Dog"
"I recall not particularly liking this beer when it was fresh. To that end, I was surprised to find this much more enjoyable. There is definitely marked improvement with a year or so of age. It's also one to be sipped."
"Pours a clear brown/red/orange with thin off-white head. Smell: lots of caramel, dates, black cherry in a cherry coke kind of way. Taste: lots of caramel, a little pumpernickel, again some of that note-quite-right cherry. Active but soft carbonation. Alcohol is a player, but not upfront. Kind of a middling barleywine."
"From what seemed to be a bit of a beast on the nose died out into a lame kitten when it came to the taste. I was hoping this would bite me on the nose as I sipped it but it quietly miaowed and slid away frightened. Definitely the wateriest barleywine I have ever encountered. I was expecting so much more than this and was really deflated by it. I have another 7 different beers from Flying Dog to go at, I hope they perform better than this did. I honestly cannot call this a sipping beer"
"D - The tastes is pretty damn good, nothing spectacular but a good easy to find Barleywine. SOLID!"
"I had low expectations going into this one, hadn't heard great things, picked up a single on closeout. Exceeded my initial expectations, particularly the aroma. The booziness is the biggest problem right now, but I might buy another to see what some age would do."
"It's super drinkable in my opinion, a sweet smooth brew with a nice little bit added in that reminds me of whiskey. If it wasn't over 10% I would call it a session beer for sure, and I guess if you're Chuck Norris you could call it that but seriously I think 2 of these would get me buzzin pretty well!"
"This probably takes a hit for me not being a Barleywine connoisseur, but still one of the better ones I have had."
"Horn Dog is a solid English barleywine. I enjoyed it, though I think it would surely be better with a couple years on it."
"D: The alcohol starts to hit you after the first 5 sips or so. A fairly hot beer. Very enjoyable and will have to cellar one to see how the heat cools off."
"D: Overall, I do enjoy it, but the alcohol is slightly overwhelming. I hope to keep some for a few years and see how it mellows."
"D: Pretty drinkable, it's a big beer with big flavor so one is probably about as far as I would go."
"All in all, this ended up being an interesting brew. Glad I got to try it. Unique flavors with a hint too overbearing. Good to try whether you like hops or matls."
"When I opened my mini-bottle I found this brew to have a very heavy nose that comes off very sweet. It's a semi-cloudy medium brown color with medium carbonation. The body is heavy and thick, reminiscent of a port wine. The flavor is earthy and sweet, I can't really pick apart what specific flavors are in there but it is fantastic. It finishes with a small amount of tartness min-tongue but smooth over the rest. Weird. But I like it. It's bold and doesn't hold back. I'll definitely go for this one again."
"A nice full body on the mouth and light carbonation make for a very smooth feel. Overall a very ""drinkable"" barleywine, but nothing I would want to drink over and over again."
"This brew pours a dark cherry almost mahogany hue with average carbonation that leaves a half finger alcohol laced looking head and a tiny bit of lacing,the aroma is raisins,sweet caramel,white port and boozy alcohol,it has a sweet syrupy mouthfeel which is to be expected for this style almost like a fine port with more carbonation and has nice interesting tastes of caramel,port,mocha and raisins soaked in alcohol,even tho i couldnt drink this all night and wouldnt start with it i will easily finish this bottle and it really is a great way to end a night as a nightcap and thats coming from a man who doesnt particulary like his barleywines be it English or American but then again maybe i just havnt tried the right ones."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has an amber color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is sweet, chocolate, fruits, and alcohol. Taste like it smells, chocolate and alcohol with some fruits. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall this is a quality beer."
"D - Good drink, alcohol is not too prominent."
"D – This is a great tasting beer, and widely palatable. I am mad at myself for sleeping on this one for so long."
"Smell is hard to make out, but from what I can: sugary sweet and somewhat acidic. Taste is mellow and sweet, somewhat buttery, really without any harsh characteristics. Some hints of caramel, apple, and pear. Extremely drinkable for the high ABV."
"D: A very nice sipping English style barley wine at 10.2% ABV. Warming, sweet with a nice, assertive hop balance. Lots of earthy, smoky sweet malt flavors take the stage here and leave a smooth, mellow hop bitterness in the finish. I could sip a couple and watch the snow fall for a couple hours for sure. A nice brew from Flying Dog."
"Medium body with a cloying sweetness and alcohol astringency. A solid barleywine for the most part, but the sweetness and alcohol heat was a bit too much for me."
"This beer smells like pear and cherry. I've never smelled pear in a beer before. It has strong esters, sweet red and dark fruit flavors, vanilla, and a bitter aftertaste without much hop aroma or flavor. It tastes like it's aged on oak, but it doesn't say anything about that on the bottle."
"I'm not good at reviews, this being my first. I bought this beer, had 1 and went back to buy the rest. This beer will blow you away. I've had better beers than this but for the value and taste this beer will be in my fridge as long as it is available."
"Pretty good for the style, but overall I could probably drink three Bigfoot to one of these."
"A pleasant, warm sipper, built to share."
"D: The first time I've had this beer, it was in the Delirium Café (in Belgium) and I've underestimated it's drinkability. As a matter of fact, today, in the comfort of home, I feel like I could easily drink more 2 bottles before falling down... :)"
"A great beer during cold weather. Nice and sweet,wonderful smell,high drinkability.To me the best beer from flying dog brewery. Reminds me of Imperial style beers such as the strong stouts out there. A good beer to finish your beer session with. I like it with BBQ.Priced well if your on a budget.The recession barley wine."
"Notes: While not extraordinary it is a good barleywine, and always pleasing to have. It has the overtly highlighted boozy profile of most of the Canis Major series but again does impact negatively the brew."
"Nice work."
"Pours with a dark, red color and a nice creamy head. Smells like a hoppy barleywine with hints of fruits. Taste is a very nice blend of all the ingredients with a high alcohol content. I could definitely taste the alcohol, but it didn't bother me at all. A smooth beer all in all, definitely worth a try."
"I've been on a strange barleywine kick lately, and this is one that I picked up. Poured from bottle into snifter glass. Pours a red/brown (closer to red) with a thin head that dissipated quickly. Smells of alcohol, fruitiness, strong malt, and a little hops. Taste follows the nose, definite booze taste especially right on the tongue, followed by malt, fruit, caramel, and hops. Malt doesn't seem to be balanced by hops. Packs an alcohol kick that you can feel, as every barleywine should. Low to moderate carbonation. Almost creamy. This is a slow sipper, not anything you should be spending the whole night drinking."
"Pours dark brown with a cream-colored head. The aroma is strong caramel with dark fruit and alcohol. This one smells boozy. The flavor is lots of dark fruit and alcohol. The alcohol is pretty hot and is warming. Low carbonation and medium mouthfeel. A good English Barleywine."
"medium to heavy body. thick sticky mouthfeel. not too bad for 10%, but prolly couldnt stomach too much of this, kinda wish i had more than 7oz. though. a nice example of the style, nothing too too amazing though."
"D: this was my first english barleywine but i definitely enjoy the style, very nice drink which does a good job at concealing the high alcohol content, sweetness isnt overpowering but definitely there"
"D: A great brew to sip away, just beware of the ABV."
"drinkability is good for a 10% beer - just wish the sold it in 6 packs for the same price"
"Pours a chestnut brown with a thin white head that fades rapidly before disappearing entirely - no lacing. Nose is loaded with dark caramel malts and dark fruits - extreme strong aroma. Taste brings the same...loaded with malts, strong tart/bitterness (astringent?) and strong alcohol burn. A bit vinuous as well. The 10.5% ABV is hidden about as well as Brett Favre's ego. Drinkability is moderate."
"D - the taste hurts this. IMO a brutal intro to the style."
"Overall, Horn Dog Barley Wine Style Ale is pretty interesting and pretty tasty. Probably my favorite Flying Dog beer that I've had so far, I kinda want to drink another one but the abv might be a bit of a turnoff. Still in all, a pretty solid beer and a good introduction to the style for me."
"Drink: This reminds me a bit of the first time I had Arrogant Bastard. I'm in mild shock. At the end of the day, this is a good beer. If you know someone who bashes beer because their only knowledge is based off of macros, this would be a fun be beer to give them. Like I said earlier, this has been my first barley wine. I've had a good time drinking this brew and hence it's a style I will pursue."
"Certainly a sipper, but pretty drinkable for a big beer. I prefer my barleywines a little hoppier, but this is a respectable beer. I don't know if I'd buy another... I think I'll stick to the Gonzo."
"Mouthfeel is on the medium side, prickly in the initial sip the quickly evolves into a smooth finish. It's very sweet so considering drinkability...meh. I'm enjoying this beer but maybe two at the most in one sitting. I'd like to have more action in the aroma but, definitely worth checking out, though."
"D: A good sipper and a pretty good barleywine IMO. It's still pretty sweet though, which would discourage me from drinking more than one in a sitting. Plus it's 10.5 abv. Next time I'm in the mood for a barleywine I might try this again. It would also probably be good with a year or two on it."
"alcohol tolerance and ability to see past cough medicine flavor are your factors in drink many of these."
"The high abv, along with the hoppiness, knock down the overall score, just a bit. It's tasty and drinkable, but you wouldn't find yourself throwing back a six pack in a single sitting though."
"Taste is a little darker than most barleywines, hop presence is relatively absent, tastes more like a ""strong"" ale British style, but I guess this is an English Barleywine, so it kind of fits the bill. Sometimes the sweetness does a good hide on the alcohol, and you can enjoy the beer to a degree."
"Not as explosive in flavor as other barleywines, but it does still provide that warming feel that we all love."
"Thanks Bobsy."
"drinkability: for me it doesnt get much better than this. favorite style, and affordable."
"I think I almost liked this more fresh, when it had some sort of hop bitterness attached to it, but for an English Barleywine this is where it should be. Maybe I just prefer the American Version."
"Don't drink and review."
"Vintage - Bottled in 2008"
"Wow. I've got to admit...Horn Dog is shockingly good. I've sat on this bottle for quite some time, frankly, because I wasn't looking forward to it much. Color me surprised at how good this is. I think a bit more hop flavor and bitterness might improve it, but that's my taste. I like hoppy Barleywines. Nonetheless, this is very good stuff. It's easily the best Flying Dog beer I've had to date. Impressive stuff that's definitely recommended."
"D - Ok, a sipper barley wine. Would pass on trying it again."
"Overall - A pretty good barleywine... rich and warming - perfect for a winters evening... recommended..."
"Mouthfeel is less abrasive and beer is much easier drinking with age. A middling barleywine when fresh - quite enjoyable with age."
"Made a good appearance, poured a cloudy milk chocolate brown with a small foamy head that settled into a thin bubbly lacing, moderate carbonation. Had a nose of caramel and butter, spicy alcohol and ripe date and fig fruity. A smooth full bodied mouth feel, good drinkability. Big malty taste, caramelized and a little sour bready, spicy subtle alcohol, fig fruity, a mild hop bite and a spicy, grainy and alcohol warm finish."
"Excellent beer!"
"This was a beautiful-looking barleywine, and because of that I was slightly more disappointed than I might have been when I tasted the brew. Alcohol was very present with slight hints of whiskey. Pretty typical barleywine flavors here, minus the complexity I was hoping for. Drank it on an empty stomach and felt the burn"
"Go get some of this"
"This is quite a delicious barley wine. Horn Dog pours a deep amber color with a golden hue on the edges with an off white head. The nose contains dark cherries, carmelized brown sugar, ripe banana, maple syrup and figs. This beer has a creamy thick mouth feel and on the palate appears to have flavors of candied walnuts, vanilla bean creme brulee with carmelized brown sugar, figs, currants, old fruit, and a light lingering tartness and bitterness that resembles coffee aftertaste. Horn Dog is a sipper but thoroughly drinkable."
"Did I mention dark fruits? Looks like I did not, but as it warms up, the beer sings some tunes of raisan, plum, , subtle cherry, semi sweet red wine/port and fig..."
"Drinkability high. Beer is well balaned. It is really sweet, but the bitterness cuts this well. There is a lot of midpalate connectivity with this beer. I'm loving it. Mouthfeel is good and full bodied."
"Overall pretty good, but not great. The first time I tried it I liked it better, thought it was more flavorful"
"Drinkability - 4.0/5.0 - not regularly otherwise I'd be an alcoholic, would definitely have again though"
"Drinkability: If this beer was a bit lower in alcohol or a bit bigger in body, with the tobacco spicey presence toned down a bit, then I could seriously see myself getting into it. However, this is a definitely will not buy again for me. I didn't hate it, but I didn't like it either."
"taste is so nice. Again, port like. Great sipper."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Extremely dark brown in color. Small head, but it stands up. Big malty smell. I'm not extremely strong on pulling out different malts yet. BIG BIG flavorful beer. Thick and chewy in my mouth with LOTS of malts and some sweetness. Just a touch hot from alcohol, but at 10.2%, it's hidden pretty well. I will definitely drink this again!"
"D: Low drinkability. The bitterness is powerful and limiting and the alcohol sears the throat for a beer."
"D- little too sweet & syrupy for me. seems off-balanced with the alcohol notes overpowering everything else. enjoyed sipping on this one but probably won't buy again"
"I would enjoy this beer again."
"The warming feeling is just part of the great feel of this beer. Not your average beer it is quite high in the ABV but still easy drinking for a strong beer."
"D: The complexity of flavours is nice, but it's to sweet for my liking. Easy to drink since the alcohol content is not noticeable."
"Pours a hazy brownish orange, thin off white head forms, settles down to a thin ring and leaves a few spots on the glass. Smell is nice, big and boozy, quite sweet, malty, brown sugar, caramel, raisins, very fruity, cherries, sherry, earthy, a bit woody, alcohol, almost Belgianesque. Taste is similar, very sweet and malty, toffee, lots of sweet fruit, raisin, leather and tobacco, brown sugar, alcohol, grapes, a bit sugary, decent balance in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with low carbonation, some heat going down. Pretty decent barleywine, throws off a lot of fruit for the style."
"Horn Dog is an odd beer. It has a banana-like flavor which, as it warms, morphs into bubblegum, very much like I find in Abt 12. The smell is like a BSDA, Belgian yeast and all. Are my senses just being weird today? Probably. Did I enjoy it? To the extent that I can tolerate bubblegum flavors."
"drinkability is higher than i'd expect for a 10.2% barleywine. i could see having a couple bottles of this one...and then falling over if i tried to get up. quite tasty, but it pales in comparison to the barrel-aged version."
"First impression is of the higher than typical hop bite on the initial taste. The overall flavor is somewhat sweet with a high level of alcohol. The post swallow taste is sweet and warming. Well-balanced for a Barley Wine. This is a rich beer that has enough carbonation to prevent it from tasting similarly to a port."
"12 oz. A short yet thick and creamy tan colored head formed with a dark dark amber beer hue. The aroma is of sweet malt syrup first then a hint of hops sneaks in. The taste is full sweet malt flavor of toffee/caramel - ish followed by a moderate bitterness that lingers into the dry finish. It seems to start off with a classic English Barelywine sweetness and finishes with a more American Barelywine hop influence. A good Barelywine. I'd personally prefer a bit more hops. But that's just me, eh."
"Pours a clowdy brown/amber with an off-white head that has hardly any powers of retension. Little bit of lace on the glass. Very malty sweet aroma nearly orange-like with licorice notes and alcohol. Taking a sip it has a big alcohol presence in the front, malt sweetness cross the middle and finishes quite crisp, bitter and warming. Lingering taste of molasses and slight bit of hops. The hop character is noticable, not dominating by any means. Medium mouthfeel with this one, lightly carbed."
"A very good sipping beer, almost a bit too sweet."
"Mouthfeel is a little light, nice and creamy though. The carbonation hits you late. Alcohol is warm down your throat, but not overpowering on the palate. Taste is a bit sweet, some licorice but no chocolate like on the nose. The is a nice amount of hops to balance this out, but it's still very malty. Definitely a sipper, but good for the style. I've had this in the cellar for about a month, and another few years wouldn't hurt this big brew. Can't wait to try more from the canis major lineup!"
"The second barley wine I have ever had. As the first, it was interesting to try, but definitely not something I would want on a regular basis."
"Don't expect a hugely hopped beer, this is an English, not an American barley wine. The only other English I have had was a J.W.Lees offering, which I found to be tremendously sweet. Not so with Horn Dog. Yes, it was sweet, but not unbearably so. No, it wasn't heavily hopped, not at all. But it tasted pretty good with molasses dominating. Poured medium brown with red tints, one finger head and minimal retention. The aroma was sweetish. Mouth feel was medium bodied with just almost zero carbonation. Drinkability was good, really didn't notice the 10 and a half ABV."
"This bottle came in a four pack along with the Gonzo Imperial Porter, Double Dog, and Tripel, all for a ten dollar price tag...one of the best craft beer deals out there right now IMO. Color is dark and rosy, with just a small amount of white laced heading. Some brandy whiffs come up first, along with some chocolate and stone fruit, none of which are very pronounced. Plum, molasses, bitter hops and alcohol come through in the taste. This beer does not seem to be trying to hide the fact that it is a bit hot and heavy. This beer took me the better part of an hour to finish, which is the way it should be with a beer this size. Put this one with some heavy blue cheese, or simply have it as an after dinner treat. Again, definitely grab the four pack this beer comes in. Cheers"
"Overall, out of all the beers I had to date, this is the epitome of a ""sipper"" beer. Very tasty but VERY intense. I don't think I vcould ever picture myself drinking more of one of these in a night. Maybe I just have to work my way up to it."
"Pours a clear reddish/brown, with an almost invisible tan head. Smells strongly of alcohol and toasted malt. Taste is a hint of sweet malt up front, an earthy, oaky middle, and a dry finish with a hint of alcohol burn. Mouthfeel is rich, low carbonation. This is a very good English Barleywine, it isn't a hop bomb assault like some American styles (not that there is anything wrong with either style). The drinkability is good, though with such high alcohol it does come through in the taste a bit and makes this a slow sipper. Definitely worth trying for fans of malty beers."
"D- Definitely a sipper. It goes down very easily considering the alcohol content. This is something I'll get again. I may even put a couple back to try with some aging. This is the best beer I've had from Flying Dog. I hope it's available in the winter, this would be good to warm up with on a cold night."
"Not a huge fan of barleywines, but this one pleasantly surprised me. The dark brown pour into a tulip glass kept its head and laced well throughout the session. The aroma called to mind the smell of sweet wort, with potent dark fruit and citrus, underscored by a hint of alcohol potency. However the taste didn't underscore the alcoholic potency at all. The flavor was syrupy sweet, but not with an annoyingly potent finish, like in most barleywines. The texture was certainly thick, but normal for this style. This is maybe one of the only barleywines I have come across that I was able to finish easily. Seems like it would age well. Would LOVE to try the barrel-aged version of this brew."
"D- This is a sipper and if one does more than that, watch out. Will be able to finish this pretty easy, but do not know if I would want another one after that."
"D: For a barley wine, which is normally hard to take in larger quantities, this beer is quite drinkable...or at least slowly sippable, which is okay by me."
"Final thoughts: This is much different than I remember, much more like a nice barleywine and less like an experiment. Thick and rich, pretty sweet but not overly, which masks the booze well, some roast and red malts, toasty and tasty."
"Solid atmosphere. Pretty good appearance, but really pleasing and full complex nose. Flavor not as complex, but a really nice balance. Nothing overpowering, just a solid combination of effects. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
"(D)- A solid barley wine. Straightforward and basic, but has it where it counts. Enjoyable for sure!"
"D- This beer was good but was too sweet for me to have another one. The ABV was pretty well hidden by the sweetness, which could be a good thing."
"D- one of the sweetest beers I have ever had, one of these is enough, almost too sweet for me, decent sipper"
"Pours a dark amber with a thin tan colored head. The aromas are alcohol, sweet caramel malt and a little bit of raisin and hop. A nice caramel malt flavor hits you up front with a fruity, raisin flavor in the background. Then the alcohol flavors and warmth kicks in and it finishes somewhat bitter while still maintaining the sweetness from the caramel malts and some of the fig, raisin flavors. The mouthfeel is a bit thick and sticky sweet, but the carbonation in the beer makes in creamy and smooth. Pretty good mouthfeel. This beer is tasty, but it may be hard to have more than one of these as they are on the heavy and strong side. Definitely a fall sipper, not so refreshing in the summer."
"Not bad, but there are better choices."
"D - Well in all it s OK"
"i would put a minimum of a year rule on this and all the way through it might always be too sweet."
"Because of the huge variation among Barley Wine - Style Ales and between such ales and American Barley Wines, I'm still struggling to figure out how well this fits into the category."
"This beer has almost zero hops, and a ton of dark fruity malt. Market this as a wee heavy, and watch the ratings go sky high. This is really good stuff, delicious malt, and deserves a high rating, but no way does this pass for an english barleywine. And yet their Double Dog Pale Ale does taste just like a barleywine... go figure."
"M&D: overall, the taste of this ""barley wine style ale"" is like neither a Traditional English Barley Wine nor an American, heavily-hopped take on the style, but in itself a super-strong, 120% full-bodied ale with intriguing ingredients of the brewery's choosing. The result is not bad at all - slick and enticingly fruitiness balanced by a thick and rich dark malty base. But for a strong ale at this calibre, with this level of density, and a semi-full sweetness, it'd better be sipped in small quantity like a dessert (barley) wine, otherwise the alcoholic effect can easily and quickly makes its presence felt."
"D - a bit heavy on the alcohol flavor, the 10% is appearant for sure. but even though i had other beers lined up to try after this ONE sample, i had to reach for another. hopefully i can manage to hold on to a few of these to check back on in a year or two. and while this is not a session by any means , for a beer boasting 10 percent, it is highly drinkable, it just goes down so damn smooth."
"Drinkability: Well, i like the serving size and I like the flavor. I just wish the flavor were turned up a little. I like to age barleywines, one of the main draws for me, and I couldn't imagine this getting more complex with time, only less. Probably won't seek this out again."
"cheers!"
"Pours a serious copper with a thin filmy off white head that sticks around. Smell is very sweet, candy and sugar, maple syrup, malt, a bit of piney hops. Taste is cloying and sweet, but balanced with bitter and floral hops. Mouthfeel is thick but not too syrupy and drinkability is pretty good."
"Pours a clear dark brown color body, with an average off-white foamy head, lasting. Aroma of sickly sweetness, like molasses. Some earthiness. Some hops too, but hard to discern. Malty molasses-y taste. Bitter finish. Not caustic. Pretty tasty. A nice balance of flavor. Some dark fruitiness. Not too bad. A little less consumable as it warms, harsher."
"Overall - Well done to Flying Dog for resisting the temptation to add excessive hops to this barleywine."
"Pours a ruby red to brown color depending on the light. There is a one finger head to gives way to some lacing. The smell is of alcohol and some malt. Taste wise there is a little malt flavor however, the alcohol taste comes through. It does not taste as strong though as other barely wines. Mouthfeel offers little to medium carbonation. Overall it is a drinkable beer, and a solid barely wine but not one of the best."
"drinkability- you have to watch the abv here, but all things considered drinkability is pretty good."
"12oz served at ~55º. Poured a murky, rusty brown color with a beige cascading head that was fairly thin, but had decent retention and left some sticky lacing on the glass. Aromas were chocolate and anise with some hints of caramel malts. Somewhat smells like a faint stout or porter. Tastes were complex - toasted grains, bready, caramel, chocolate, and anise with notes of vanilla, some faint citrus hoppiness and white pepper on the finish. Mouth-feel was creamy and rather thick. Alcohol was present and left a tingle on the tongue as it warmed the throat. Overall, somewhat unique for a barley wine with the chocolate and anise flavors, but not a bad barley wine. I did get a little sick of it towards the end, but was still fairly enjoyable."
"Medium carbonation with a thick mouthfeel. Drinkability suffers quite a bit from the overpowering abv but to me, this is a lot better aged. I tried a couple of these fresh about a year ago and don't remember liking them too much. This still isn't anything too special but after a year it has picked up quite a bit. I doubt I'll ever look for these again but it was nice to know the last one left me with a better impression than the fresh bottles did originally."
"Drinkability: as most barleyiwnes it is a bit harsh."
"Overall, a good drink, but it needs to be mellowed and aged first. Also, it's going to be boozy and will basically smack you in the face."
"D- I wanted this be better than it was. Kept searching for some redeeming quality but there was nothing that stood out. Its an ok beer but I would take my money elsewhere."
"D- Pretty complex and enjoyable. Good stuff here, although not like most barleywines I've had. Alcohol well hidden."
"Drinkability: For most this would be a hard beer to drink. I enjoy barley wine however, but what disappointed me most with this it wasn't as an intense, complex and mind melting as most barley wines are in taste. A bit subdued for my taste"
"Sweet maltiness is the first thing to hit the tastebuds, but there is quite a bit of toasty and hop bitterness there to dismiss any syrupy lingering effects on the palate. Alcohol is there in copious amounts as well. Has a oaky, almost barrel-aged feel to it. You can tell this is an English style barleywine as it lacks resinous, citrusy west coast hoppiness and has a sweeter malt base. Some acidic fruit goes excellently with this beer. In fact, as I near the end of the glass, I think this is a damn fine barleywine."
"D- a sipper it took me some time to finish"
"Drinkability: due to the ABV this is a sipper. A decent barleywine - I recommend as a gateway barleywine. Another great beer to ad to the solid lineup from Flying Dog"
"Pours a deep mahogany color with a very faint tan-colored head that quickly dissolves into a fine ring around the glass. Aroma is dominated with dried fruits and accompanied with some toasty malts and a little booze. Flavors has plenty of sticky malt and dried raisins. Not much alcohol is detected in the flavor but the flavors do stop short. Its a full to medium bodied beer and has a light carbonation. Decent Barleywine."
"M-D- Mouthfeel is of red wine smooth and dry on the tongue. Almost to dry finish with the alcohol feel. Drinkable in moderation."
"I'm a barley wine fan, but this one just doesn't impress me much."
"Notes: A good beer to have once in a while. I pick it up whenever I see it. I liked the beer and the masking of the alcohol along with the balance is what I liked most."
"A delicious beer...don't miss this one if you have the chance but watch out for the punch it packs."
"Drinkability: I like this.... but don't LOVE it. It's a sipper and probably no more than one to a session."
"The taste is the same as the smell, very fruity, sweet without being cloying. Nice thick mouthfeel, nice carbonation....where is the alcohol? it is hidden in the taste and the mouth. I could drink this all night, well....for a little while anyway."
"Overall a good English Barleywine, but it's so strong and sweet that I would reserve it for occasional drinking."
"T/M: This is not your grandpa's high life. Very sweet syrupy beginning that last through most of experience. The malts move in after the sweet beginning There is almost no carbonation and no hoppyness that I can detect. As it warms it almost has a spiciness to it. The warmer it is the more mellow it gets"
"I'm not a big fan of barleywines, but I truly enjoy this beer."
"Pretty smooth mouthfeel with some flavors that stick around, but I'm still not impressed. I do like most of the barley wines I've had, but this doesn't fall into that category. This is not a beer I would go out and ask for by name, I'll probably give it another try though, I believe everything deserves a second chance... to some extent"
"Amber with a creamy sand colored head that leaves sliding lace on the glass. The smell is vanilla, brown sugar, dark fruit and cocoa, definately on the maltier side. Warm alcohol, fudge and rum soaked fruit are finished off by a slightly vinuous charred bitterness. Medium bodied with fine carbonation. Well done."
"Poured a copper auburn body with one-finger tan head that died slowly. A strong roasted and caramel malt with hints of yeast, bourbon, cask, oak...something akin to wine. Smooth and creamy medium body with hints of figs, dark chocolate, toffee, coffee, butterscotch, bread and mostly caramel. Not all these malts may be noticeable to others but I swear I picked them up. This beer was just all over the place on my tongue in terms of taste. Finishes slightly dry with mild hop bitterness and a very minor alcohol burn but for the most part these two facets of the beer serve to only balance the overall sweet malt sensations. A great sipper that I enjoyed."
"Syrup hides the alcohol, but the sweetness takes it's drinkability down a bit."
"D) The tastes fluctuate on the palate making it hard to get a good vibe from this brew."
"All in all, this is a very drinkable Barleywine."
"D - A decent beer with lots of complex flavour but I couldn't see myself drinking it all that often. Was hoping for some more hops and a bit more bitterness."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a golden dark brown, with a thin off white head. Aroma was sweet, like banana bread with nutmeg. Very small hint of vanilla and hops also. Taste was sweet, a little bit of syrup in the back, a touch of bitterness, with some milk chocolate and vanilla milk. Felt good in the mouth, coated very well, a touch to much carbonation was the only detractor. Didn't hide the abv very well, hit very fast, so needed to sip."
"Flying Dog: not my fave brewery."
"This is a big beer, but not REALLY big."
"Pours a rich dark caramel with a great creamy half-inch head....exceptional for high abv Smell is rich, mainly malty, almost molasses-like. Hmm...mainly sweet, no overwhelming alcohol or hopd presence..unusual for a barleywine..but not bad..wait..the alcohol does kick in at the finish. Mouthfeel is mainly smooth, almost cloying...good dry finish. Not bad on the drinkability scale for the high abv."
"Pours rich and purply black, with a big luxurious head that falls to thick bubbles and sticky lacing. The aroma is plummy and raisny, rich and malty. The flavor is carmelly and plummy, like a delicious Plum Sauce. It has a little peppery character on the finish, and a little brandy-like slap of alcohol. The effect is like a rich blackberry brandy. The mouthfeel is thick and clingy, leaving a pleasant sweet-and-bitter residue on the tongue."
"D: I don't know.. the aftertaste is a bit of a bummer for me, but a deviation from my norm and interesting to say the least."
"D: Nothing spectacular, yet still tasty. Worth drinking again."
"(I'm a bit confused as to origin. All the Flying Dogs listed on BA are from Maryland. My bottles say Denver)."
"Now I'm a big fan of the Flying Dog ales and artwork, but never had this one. The first thig I notices was the potent overpowering smell of nutty barley wine that had the feel of high alchohol content witha fruity overtone. The foam was a average wheat color that dissapated quickly. T - Extremely robust and potent, rich, nutty, and a bit fruity and deep. The color of very dark red/brown that told me this was going to be a potent tasting ale. As in drinkability, I couldn't really drink this heavy ale with ease. It had to be sipped like a fine brandy to appreciate the complex notes in the taste."
"Future outlook: Barlywines don't seem to be my favorite style, though offerings like this are a nice change of pace. I wish these were sold regularly in the 7 oz. bottles. Seems to be the perfect size for a beer like this. A good offering, and I'm sure I'll have it again."
"D - Not very... wouldn't have more than one. Drink a sip and feel like you're drinking a gallon."
"Part of the Canis Major mixed eight pack purchased at Abe's in Bethlehem. Poured from a 7 ounce bottle into my shaker glass. Appears a hazed brownish amber with barely half an inch of rapidly fading foam. Minimal lacing sticks to the inside of my glass with each passing sip. Smells and tastes of sweet, lightly caramelized malts, brown sugar, figs, maybe some prunes and dried apples. No real hop presence to speak of. Almost full bodied with medium carbonation and very little alcohol presence. A tasty, sipping BW."
"D - The most drinkable barley wine I've ever had but 12 oz would be plenty."
"This is damn tasty, and quite possibly the best of the Canis Major mix pack I picked up."
"very good barleywine. I love it. the alcohol is real prominent, so watch out. well recommended."
"this beer was good and much more of a well balanced brew after about 15 min. hope you don't have anything to do after drinking this one or two."
"Overall, a big beer with a lot of flavor, but I wouldn't buy it more than once."
"Drinkability: Decent barleywine, but too boozy to be a regular drinker. The taste is kind simple, lacking complexity. One to try, but that might be it."
"D: Definitely a beer I will be cellaring. A malt heavy offering that contrasts nicely with the hoppier members of my collection."
"For what it is, it is incredibly good to drink slowly. It is not too much in any essence, except possibly the alcohol kick to the brain once you have finished it all. Very well balanced I find, compared to some American Ales, with a nice smooth, buttery like mouthfeel and a heavy body. Very well done."
"Not the best, but still good."
"If you are being responsible however, then by all means. This is one to indulge with."
"Overall pretty decent."
"D - bleh.. this is not an easy drinker due to the ABV presense and lack of taste."
"D - Good flavor, and not too noticeable alcohol taste. Definitely a sipping beer. No more than one of these at a time. Very enjoyable."
"m/d - A little syrupy/sugary, but otherwise fine. Flavor lasts a while. Very drinkable, I had to slow myself down so I could enjoy the flavor."
"Serving type: bottle"
"D - extreamly good drinkablity"
"Notes: Not my favorite Barley Wine (Great Lakes was my favorite) but a very solid option. Recommended."
"Poured into a pint glass this brew has a dark caramel color with a amber tint when held to the light. The brew has a slight off white head that leaves decent lacing on the glass from the higher alcohol content. The aroma is tart and has clove and malt in the backbone. The flavor of this brew is a little off from the bottle's ""chocolate and licorice"" description. There is a definite barley wine flavor with strong clove, fig, followed with an aged bourbon after taste. This is a heavier bodied brew with medium carbonation. Good beer, but hard to drink to many of the barley wine group."
"D: Low drinkability. First barley wine I had and not sure if I would have another."
"D-Because of the booziness of this one, I don't think I'll be having anymore of this. Kind of dissapointed."
"Decent beer, not disappointed but I wouldn't search high and low for it."
"First thought: A very busy, boozey mouthful. A butterscotchy taste accompanies the alcohol. Not really sweet, it takes the hops at the end to get rid of the sharp alcohol flavor. Kind of smokey, also - almost like a scotch, except there really isnt that smoothness to it. It just sticks in my throat. Mouthfeel is just ok, although I'm probably preoccupied on the other aspects right now. The smell is the only thing going for it. There are sweeter, maltier, hoppier, and smoother barleywines out there, and I don't think I'll be seeking this out again."
"pours very dark brown, mahogany color. I got no head outta this one, so no real lacing to speak of either. BIG malty taste with this one, a little bit sweet, not sure if i could drink more than 2 or 3 for that reason. Has just enough hops to balance out the malt just a bit, but is not bitter whatsoever. more i drink it the sweeter it seems to get. not sickening sweet just yet, but im thinkin maybe i could now only drink one of these bad boys at a time. Alcohol is also hidden very well in this one."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- The slick, foamy mouthfeel eases the drinking experience and makes it even more positive. This was a very nice surprise, and is an example of how a beer's label can be deceiving... it's not all crazy and violent as the design suggests. Recommended for its uniqueness alone."
"D- Although I am not a b-wine afficianado, I have been drinking more lately. This is low on my list so far. Flavor not up there like the etoh heat is."
"D - This is a very aggresive BW. Perhaps with some aging and some mellowing this would be a bit tastier, but still a solid beer."
"1107"
"D- I never thought I was too fond of English Barleywine. This went quite nicely with some chocolate as it warmed. It was a bit spicy, alcohol wise for me."
"I would try this beer again."
"Mouthfeel is very viscous, smooth, with moderate carbonation that fits well. I had this from the 7 oz. taster pack, and I could have definitely gone for 12 oz. of this brew. Strong, the alcohol creeps up on you, and it may be too sweet for multiple pours. But it's very enjoyable nonetheless, a good barleywine."
"not flying dogs best effort."
"D - this beer is way too easy drinking considering its high ABV"
"This is one thick beer, epitomizes the beer is food idea, drinking this one in the morning is defiantly filling me up. Almost syrupy in it's texture, but not in a bad way. This is one hell of a sipper, you wouldn't want to chug it even if you could."
"It tastes like a smorgasbord of meets and cranberry cordial at a renaissance fair."
"Poured a dark brown with a ruby tint. Good carbonation left a very good dirty white tan head. Smelled of toffee, sugar and lots of malt. The ABV is disguised very well. Taste is thick, syrupy and malty...just the way I like it. Mouthfeel is thick, malty but not to complex. At room temperature this one gets thick. A good barleywine but not of the best."
"Drinkability was medium. Sweet flavors dominate w/ a mild alcohol heat."
"Good but not great barleywine. There isn't enough rich buttery caramel malt for all of the hops and alcohol. It's fairly affordable for a barleywine, which is nice. I'm not sure how well it conforms as an English Barleywine. It's fairly hoppy at this point. The beer could probably use some age on it. There's some good caramel malt in there and syrupy barley, nice though. The alcohol drowns things out a bit, vodka notes even come up a bit. The feel is warm and a bit sticky. It drinks fairly well, but it doesn't quite have the complexity and smoothness of some barleywines."
"4/4.5/4.5/4/4"
"I thoroughly enjoyed this Flying Dog offering. From the first pour, I knew I would love it. The color was almost caramel, and the head sat perfectly atop the beer until the first sip. I first tried this from just a seven-ounce bottle, and when it was over I wish I had a 22-ouncer. Typically, I'm a big hop-head and love IPAs and DIPAs, but I would certainly recommend this to anyone."
"d) A challenging drop. I think there are elements of interest, but a certain angularity that makes it a bit obnoxious."
"D - Definitely not for sessioning. Awesome for cold weather and pretty enjoyable."
"Mouthfeel is heavily-bodied and syrupy. Drinkability is about average for a barleywine. The alcohol stops me after I finish the first one."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a nice bite."
"Pours a dark black with a hint of red. Has a one finger head that is off white and leave a little lacing. Has a nice fruity aroma that is light. As for the taste there is a little bit of fruit. Very malty and sugary. Decent beer but nothing great. Definitley not my favorite of this style."
"Pours a beautiful deep red with a decent brown head. Powerful smells of brown sugar, maraschino cherries, sweet malts, and tons of alcohol. This is a big beer, though not as big as some barely wines out there -- I love it. I barely took a sip and it exploded with burnt malts and molasses galore, all balanced by generous amounts of piney and resinous hops. This is one of the more drinkable barley wines that I've had, at least in the sense that it's pleasant to sip on its own (without food) and doesn't leave my palate feeling beat down. Finish is long and sweet. An excellent beer."
"D-A nice winter brew."
"Taste is big, malty with a good kiss of hops. Striking bitterness and a big hoppy alchohol burn that makes this a good, cold evening beer."
"D - This is the Fat Boy or Little Man of malt bombs. Sugary sweet, flabby, obese, overly malty, and lacking in the hop department. This is not terrible, but it could go on a diet and it could definitely use some more hops. Note: mine is a 2007 vintage bottle, and this being the first few hours of 2009 it could have lost some of its hop power. I'll have to pick up some fresh and see if the hops come out in fuller force."
"good beer, this might be my first barleywine, its pretty interesting"
"D - This is a pretty good barleywine style ale. I don't think I could have more than one at a time."
"D- A very enjoyable English Barleywine. A high ABV, but it is not harsh. Tasty."
"Hazy mahogony color with a thin mostly diminishing frothy off-white head. Aroma of sweet caramel roasted malt,rasins grapefruit licorice and pine nuts.Flavor is big on the malt,sweet and sugary,I only get a slight hint of the chocolate,some wine, dark cherries.Dry slightly bitter finish,pleasing mouthfeel..Very drinkable and better than expected."
"Cloudy light brown ale with a rapidly fading head.Aroma is dominated by chocolate.Taste is molasses,chocolate and alcohol.Overall a damn good ale with a nice kick to it.This beer is smooth even with the high alcohol content and good from first to last drink.Highly recommended and I would purchase again!!"
"Tremendous, majestic purple body with a head that forms a brownish, thick ringwhich settles nicely into an intimidating, murky pool... grape and malt dominate with chocolate and sweeter hints following (licorice, the label suggests)... yeasts are subtle and complex... WARM...curls around the tongue with minimal effervescence... a flourish at the throat... full-bodied with a lingering aftertaste.... strong, malty--grapish tastes, almost of merlot--instantly warms with a pungent punch and slyly leaks some chococlate flirtations at its finish... Flying Dog's select mixpack has been solid, and Horn Dog befits its style with accuracy, smoothing out by mid-glass and numbing pleasantly..."
"D: An good mouthfeel and taste, but the alcohol was not hidden too much and the taste of the burn of it got to me later. Overall, a pretty good beer, but the fairly strong alcohol presence winds up hurting its drinkability."
" ~ This is a one and done. The 'head' is strong and doesn't waste any time. I'd suggest starting out with this brew and then move on to something a bit lighter. Maybe a New Glarus - Totally Naked or something along that line. Regardless this is certainly a brew you should try."
"Big body, low carbonation, a real nice sipper. My preferred style of barleywine compared to the American hop bomb type. This is a great example."
"Mouth feel: Smooth and slightly carbonated."
"I poured a 12 ounce bottle into a standard pint glass. It pours a deep chesnut color with a thin white head. The nose is of a medicianal booze, very heavy on the alcohol with a hint of a sweetener added. The beer is full bodied and complex. Dried fruit notes are followed by a potent alcoholic punch. the finish is clean. This beer will really sock it to you at 11% ABV but it still is quite drinkable. I really enjoyed this one."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Copper color with a off white hide. Good amount of lacing as I drank the beer. Slightly fruit smell but not strong. Strong hit of hops in the beginning, then the sweet malts hit. I nice full mouth feel too this barely wine. Acouple of these in one sitting would easily catch up with you."
"I love this beer, I love flying dog, it's a win win really. This beer pours a very cloudy, almost mucky brown. If you didn't know it was gonna be great you would probably think it looks nasty. The smell is super sweet and amazingly malty. The malts are really complex too. The taste is filled with various malts. Very little hoppy notes but very sweet with caramel, dark malt, and some fruit notes too. There are many after hits of the malt notes after you swallow which is actually the best flavor. This is a nice factor because you feel and taste the malt notes instead of hop based bitterness. This is probably one of the best barleywines you can find commonly. Thanks again flying dog for another great beer.!"
"Good stuff. Very wine like aroma. Dark fruits, raisins. Nice looking reddish brown with a nice head. Flavor like the aroma with a bit of bitterness in the background. Nice and smooth with an alcohol warming at the end. Very easy to drink a few of these."
"This is not a bad beer at all, but barleywines can be so much more interesting. It doesn't really have any negatives, but it only has weak positives, except for the smell. I'll throw a few in the cellar and try in a year or two."
"D: This is one of my fav's from year to year and the 2008 is as good as any of the past ones. I like these alot, but I have to remember to watch out for that 10.5% ABV!"
"D-One bottle is good for a sitting. However, it's an enjoyable barleywine that would be enjoyable again in the future. Perhaps a bit too much alcoholic harshness, but that trait could possibly be subdued with aging."
"What a great beer overall. Great to just sit back and enjoy after being outside all day stacking firewood! Low hopped, highly malty, high ABV...I think I'll have another..."
"Bottle from Ty. Pours a dark ruby with a small thin head. The aroma is sweet and light. The taste is great: grapes, raisin, some chocolate and assorted sweets, and some small hops and malt flavors. Really nice, like a wine, but with beer greatness. The alcohol is really subdued. Overall, a great beer."
"Fizzy and creamy. Thick and chewy. Well-balanced, thick, dark fruits. Lots of alcohol."
"D- a little potent and warming to be anything more than a sipper. one or two bottles in a night would be perfect."
"This one is definitely a sipper, a big gulp can bring out the burn in the alcohol. Keeps the cold fall/winter nights at bay."
"This is a nice winter beer, very tasty"
"Overall, for a beer that looks like Aunt Jemima, this is not too bad. Not my favorite style, but this I can manage."
"Interesting young, this can only improve with age."
"Pours a two finger cream head that fades slowly, leaving a good lace. Deep mahogany color. Light carbonation and medium-heavy bodied. Raisin nose. Flavor is sweet malty but balanced with hops. Some bitterness at finish. High ABV is hidden. More flavor as it warms up. $1.67 for a 12oz bottle from Capitol Convenience (now Barb's Beer Emporium) Concord, NH."
"A very good English Bwine though my american (read hop head) sensibility is looking for more hops in the aroma and flavor, definetly something to drink again if im in need of an English Bwine."
"I was a disapointed by this beer, I'd much rather have a Bigfoot. I bought two so I'll let one age for a while. Until then I'll stick with Double Dog."
"Mouthfeel-medium carbonation delivers a light bitterness that fades quickly. The malt body is there but the dried fruit flavors are really dominant. This one is least a 2007 maybe a 2006. The alcohol warmth comes in at the finish. A froth on the palate heightens the fruit flavors with some caramel and estery flavors coming through. Very much towards the English style Barleywine and this tasted great. Not too hot and as stated above this one has obviously aged somewhat. Even as it warmed the flavors remained consistant."
"Pours dark cherry/brown with no head, not very carbonated. No lacing. Nose is very strong, lots of alcohols and heavy malts. Taste is also very strong, a bit heavy and syrupy with the ABV coming through. The balance is pretty good overall, though, considering the strength of its elements. Once sitting, it goes down a lot more easily. A respectively good but not great barleywine."
"Drinkability - Definitely a sipping beer and I couldn't drink more than one. Perhaps too malty for me -- and I did find it a bit cloying at times."
"The taste is strong winey fruit, plums, raisins, with a strong toasted bread quality, a little dry chocolate - mostly plain cocoa without the bitterness - a woody-earthy quality, hint of gingerbread. It morphs from a richyl fruity, sweet, alcoholic quality up front to a drier, more toasty-cocoa quality in the finish, along with hint of burnt fruit.. The alcohol is quite evident and adds warm pungency, but it's mostly smooth and tasty. The stength brings down the drinkability a bit , but not much. It is zesty and lively, always engaging, and the flavours get even beter, yet smoother, as it warms. It is surprisingly drinkable, esp. as it warms, and at first sip I didn''t hink it was going to be as easy to drink as it ended up being."
"Pours a very nice dark copper color with some good (if thin)initial head and some very nice lacing. It has a nice deep malty scent, very sweet, with hints of brown sugar. Same for the taste, very deep and thick, an almost double-bock caramel flavor. It goes down very smoothly for such a high abv brew."
"The ""horns"" on this dog are still a little too sharp. I would suspect some time would help tame this dog."
"It's a nice cloudy amber color - good looking barleywine. Hardly any carbonation. Alcohol flavor comes through pretty strongly, but it has a surprisingly light and clean mouthfeel. I like the sweet malt flavor accented by noticeable hoppy-ness. I need to try more Flying Dog brews."
"Overall this one was very nice. It is somewhat of a malt bomb though, in my opinion, but still very good."
"The drinkability of this brew is alright. I have a feeling I couldn't handle more than one of these in a single session, because of the high alcohol content. As for it being my first barlywine, it was a fun beer to experience, reminded me slightly of a porter, but I will be only drinking these on occasion."
"Taste: see smell. Perhaps I'm finally getting a taste for the style, but I really enjoy this barley wine."
"Drinkability: I thought this one was pretty good, actually. A nice, complex malt profile, a decent amount of hop balance, some pleasant fruity notes. Sure, the alcohol's up there, but of course it's gonna be showin' at 10.5%. Give this one a shot - one of the better big dogs in the Flying Dog arsenal."
"This beer surprised me, a very nice Barleywine."
"D - Very different beer when enjoyed at warmer temperatures. However, I am inpatient and would rather grab something else."
"Got this in the flying dog mix-pack, and glad I did because i dont think i would be able to handle a six pack of this, it would take me awhile to get through. This was actually one of my first barley wines and i really enjoyed the style."
"I will be drinking more of this one as my tastes get more refined. For $2.49/bottle a great value for a barleywine beer."
"Their imp porter and this are so both very high quality beers."
"The beer poured a slightly cloudy brownish-red with very little head into a chalice. There was very little aroma to speak of - just a whiff of alcoholic esters. However, alcholic esters dominated the flavor, and were mixed with ample hop bitterness and molasses/toffee undertones. A little raw, but would age nicely, IMHO."
"Second of a four bottle pack I purchased as City Beer. This beer pours an extremely dark amber, almost too dark to tell, but the light reflection allows you to see what's hiding in the murk. There is subtle alcohol smell, but you can hardly notice it, until it goes down the hatch. There's a minimal alcohol burn, i'm guessing a mild bourbon. For a second I thought I was drinking a super mild Angel's Share. The first one I had of this batch seemed to have a higher sugar content. This bottle is really mellow and mildly carbonated. This is for sure an English style BW because it's super mellow compared to it's american, mostly west coast, counterparts. Very little, if not, any hops. I am really pleased with this beer. Although it's American brewed, it has made me want to search for authentic English BWs. Aging these 12oz bottles could do wonders and I recommend doing so."
"D: Not a bad beer, but I wouldn't sit and drink a case of it."
"An above average barleywine for sure. Has some decent carbonation and a nice sweet taste. The high ABV is hidden well for the most part but does kinda sneak in at the end. The mouthfeel is very good with a nice smooth aftertaste and full body."
"Drinkability is good. One of the better Barleywines I've had, but a bit overdone on the sweetness in the malt."
"D - Like this one, but not all night."
"D: This could be better but it is better than all of the Flying Dog brews I have tried, not saying much though. Doesn't have to overwhelming metallic ass taste Flying Dog brews usually have and kill any chance of liking the brew. Metallic taste is there but extremely subdued. Not a bad beer, but I wouldn't pay for another. There are better Barleywines out there."
"This is a good beer. Appearance is ok with no real head and a little lacing. Smell and taste are both very good and similar. Honestly, tastes like a wine with a bit more alcohol. A nice malt back bone that is a bit dry, hops that are a bit sweet, and some alcohol. Mouthfeel is decent, a lot again like wine. I would say a merlot, with some weight to it but not a lot of carbonation. Drinkability is great. Its a sipper no doubt, but its a pleasure."
"D- Drinks great for such a high ABV. Really surprising"
"This is a big, but balanced brew. Malt is rich and complex. Earthy hops bring balance and counterpoint to the sweetness. Unfortunately, the alcohol comes off a little too harsh and dissonant. I like big boozy brews, but this one needs to cellar for awhile."
"D- a really good review overall, its drinkability for me stems from the depth of aroma and complexity of flavor which constantly keep me searching for more intricacies, a world of taste yet to be discovered, although i wouldn't quite write my mama and tell her about this one. i assume cellaring for a few YEARS would totally reform and mellow this monster caterpillar into one bad ass butterfly but sadly this is my only bottle. powerful and sedative. one is enufff."
"Aroma is rich and has hints of licorice, orange and chocolate; it lacks the alcohol nip that I have gotten from most barley wines. Color is a clear mahogany with a fairly thick and persistent yellowish-beige head. Flavor is mainly malty and has ribbons of burnt caramel, unsweetened chocolate and hops; alcohol bite is not very noticeable, which is a plus. Texture is very smooth, and aftertaste has equal amounts of sweetness and hoppy bitterness."
"consensus here amongst buds is a very user friendly barley wine. Cant think of a more balanced barley wine than this. Poured with a nice head an plenty a lace. Would be great as a before/after dinner treat. Pleasing rich dark amber color. Fruity bittersweet. Balanced. A tad boozy in the finish. N 'ats it."
"Alcohol hits about halfway through. A slow drinker. Kind of kicking my butt right now. Maybe I'm on an empty stomach. This is an enjoyable beer to have one of, just not interesting enough to demand sip after sip. Generally I'd prefer a nice doppelbock."
"Overall this is a solid barleywine, and a pretty good deal. Worth a shot."
"Perhaps not really the right beer for these hot Georgia summer nights, but I'm of the opinion that there's no perfect season to enjoy a beer -- a good beer is a good beer, and though this is not groundbreaking as far as the style goes, it is most definitely a good beer."
"This full bodied beer is not for the faint of heart. It has a lot of flavor, excellent bite, balanced carbonation and a better then decent nose. All of which mask the over 10% ABV although you can feel the warmth in your throat after the first few sips. A fine offering from Flying Dog."
"Two years mellowing imparted a nice character to this already fine offering from Flying Dog."
"Deep brown/amber color, some haze and a moderate head that settles to a pretty nice foamy ring on top. Aroma is sugary with alcohol, sweet malts and some oak. The flavor is sweet raisins and plums with maple sugar and honey with some alcohol noticeable. Finishes with some spice and hops. Not complex but good. For whatever reason, while not as complex, this reminds me a little of Dogfish Immort. Pretty easy drinking for a barleywine even as it warms. Not spectacular but I liked it."
"I poured this offering into a wine goblet. This amber brown opague liquid produced a very slight head that decided not to hang around for the party. The smell was quite pleasant with the raisin and cherry dominating the nose. The taste was very much like the smell, raisin and plum like characters with some brown sugar and caramel to go along with the malt. Finishes with a slight bitter twang, and a bit of carbonation to the back of the palate. Flying Dog is one of my favorite breweries, and this example of there fine work has not let me down."
"Its times like these that makes me glad that I started drinking better beer.This beer is elegant and its a sipper and I could sip it all day and be happy without the hoppiness.Great beer from Flying Dog."
"Finished off the Flying Dog mixed 4 pack. Horn Dog is definitely an English Barleywine, on the sweet side but not over-the-top. A nice sipping beer."
"This was my first barleywine style brew and I was a little apprehensive at first, but now I am glad that I tried it"
"4/4.5/4.5/4.5/4"
" I am not ready for beer this strong or complex as a beer drinker. I'll stick to Porters and IPA's and leave this stuff for the Bros."
"Overall, an English barleywine without the annoying English flavors. Very good, and satisfyingly different."
"D: I prefer hop-forward American Barleywines. However, this one is just sweet enough that I will sip it as befits such a large beer rather than rushing through it."
"All and all this is a very sold beer. Well worth trying, but not something that I'll make a habit of drinking often."
"D: I'm no flying dog fan but this was pretty good. It was a well balanced barely wine. It wasn't overly alcoholic and had a nice hop and malt balance."
"Drinkability - Definitely one of the sweeter, smoother barleywines i've ever had. Way more depth than I would have expected out of a flying dog brew. A diamond in the rough, and a total surprise."
"For a barlywine, this beer is very drinkable and I enjoyed it very much."
"Note: This is an english BW. I tell ya, show me the guy who decides which style a BW is, thats the guy who knows his stuff. Such subtle differences."
"Soft and silky. Sticky a bit, but not obnoxiously so. Great linger upon the palate. Superb sipper, as per style."
"This poured a hazy, muddy brown with almost no head. It smelled like molasses and caramel with barley malt. It tasted very complex with many layers of citrus hops, caramel malt, barley, raisin bread, bitter chocolate, and alcohol. It was slightly thick with a bit of carbonation, and had a brief surprisingly sweet aftertaste. Overall this was much better constructed than I anticipated, with intricate and delicate flavor that was still fairly easy to drink. Well done!"
"Last but not least, this is one of the good ones in from a brewery that makes a lot of ordinary beers. Good job on this one, ""dogs."""
"Pours a crisp dark copper with a thin diminishing head. Aroma is burnt caramel, dark malts and brown sugar. Taste has lots of the complexity you'd expect from a Barleywine; burnt caramel, molasses, hints of fruit, subtle undertoned hops. The beer is certainly heavy with present alcohol, but it is tolerable, just a sipper. This one is worth picking up every now and then, and would likely be better with some aging, but there are certainly better Barleywines out there."
"Drinkability: Well, I will say it's one of the better beers in the Flying Dog line-up."
"The drinkability is good for a big brew. Prosit. MK"
"D: Nice sipper for those cold winter nights sitting on the balcony. Will keep you warm and satisfied. Drinks fairly easy despite its high ABV billing."
"D - Normally I would prefer a bit more of a hop bite but this malty behemoth is a wail of a beer."
"Pretty darn good, and absurdly drinkable given how high the ABV is."
"flying dog's barleywiine style ale is certainly a small dessert in a glass. It pours a dark amber-brown. The aroma and taste are full of malts and fruity hints while maintining a bit of spice. Mouthfeel and drinkability, like many barleywines, seem pretty subjective. If you like thick, heavy drinks then you'll enjoy it. If not, you might not be able to take much more after one of these. It is, however, a little less heavy/dense than say Weyerbacher's blithering idiot. If you're a fan of the style, then its good. If you're not familiar with the style this may be an ok introduction. The colors in Ralph Steadman's drawing for this label add a nice aesthetic touch to the bottle, with the deep blues mixing nicely with the sweet malt flavor"
"I tried a bottle marked ""VINTAGE 07F," which I'm guessing means Fall 2007. It smells of sweet malt, caramel, and maybe a hint of black cherry. When poured, the beer's color is unusually dark for a barley wine, kind of mahogany.The taste is very malty, and sweet, like toffee and fruit. It's got more than a little bite, and you can immediately sense the high alcohol content. It is, in a word, yummy."
"A powerful malt bomb. Something that will knock you out if you are not careful. Though I really do enjoy it, and kind of reminds me of a good bourbon or scotch. A nice beer to sip on after diner."
"Still, for all the lack of subtlety I find this beer strangly pleasing. I might scrounge up another & set it upright in the cellar. It might benefit greatly from getting out of its diapers."
"This beer was one of my first Barleywine styled beers and I can honestly say it is a lot more in a glass than I was expecting. The smell of this specimen was very intense and almost hair raising initially. The after taste was a bit harsh for my mouth, however, a good experience in the end."
"The Horn Dog treated me quite nicely. I found it very tasty and supremely sippable."
"Drinkability is limited. High alcohol, and mediocre flavor make for a less than superior drinking experience. Have heard it's nice with some age and definitely would like to see."
"Overall a nicely balanced and easy to drink barleywine."
"With the scents of apricots and caramel, this took me by surprise as I was expecting a syrupy mess with a high abv bite. Maybe I was half right as the medium to heavy bodied ale flowed like water on newly waxed floor. It wasn't the right beer for the steamy heat of the early summer in NY, but I could see it being a great ale for tail gating in the Fall with grilled steaks and chicken on the menu."
"A malt-lovers Barleywine. I'll take the hoppier Double Dog over Horn Dog any day."
"This is a stupid brew... it's just ridiculous... I'll say it... it's my favorite barleywine... I like Bigfoot and Old Ruffian and the Old Knucklehead #12 but this is different and hell, it's just better.. a perfect brew..."
"Muted amber color. Quite foamy at first but it dies right back down. Somewhat soapy and metallic aroma. Some caramel and cinnamon traces. Malty flavor with a slight hop bite to it. Again somewhat soapy tasting. Nice treacle taste in there. Very slight alcohol presence. Good body-finish is rather dry. Fair UK barleywine. Lose the soapy flavor and I think it would bring it up a notch. Will try again-not a lot of UK versions out there."
"mouthfeel is heavy, thick, creamy, a nice take from flying dog"
"Fairly chewy and full mouthfeel. I found it a little sticky and oily in the finish, and it coats the mouth rather unpleasantly. This is certainly the top of the F.D. lineup that I've had, but it's tilting toward dark and sweet."
"Drinkability: This is a pretty easy barleywine, which probably makes it more drinkable than most other barleywines. Hops are very mild, but body is somewhat heavy. Couldn't drink a lot of these, and probably wouldn't. Taste is good; price is not."
"Pours a beautifully clear brown that is completely ruby when held to the light. Thin off white head that doesn't stick around to long. Aroma is crystal malt and floral citrusy hops. Taste is bitter citrus hops with a sweet caramel twang that segues to an alcohol burn and a sweet aftertaste. Thick body, little sticky in the mouthfeel, low to moderate carbonation. I love the balance in this beer, I can taste the caramel from the malt and the bite of the hops in almost perfect harmony. Excellent brew."
"I'd I have to try some different styles to get a full appreciation. Not bad."
"This is a nicely done English Barley wine. It might be a tiny bit rough around the edges, but I like it. Nice sweetness and a good hop bitterness make for a good night cap. I could even drink a few of these at the end of the night."
"Pours a deep mahogany with an smooth creamy tan head which eventually dissipates to a moderately lacing cap. The aroma is chock full of dark fruits, with figs, raisins and plums weaving a rich blanket. The flavour is a sumptuous mix of figs, raisins, milk chocolate and caramel, followed by a lightly bitter finish. The mouthfeel is as expected, thick, but also comes across as very smooth and drinkable. I've got another 3 that I'm gonna lay away for a while, so it will be interesting to see how this beer develops!"
"D: Being a barley wine one is more than enough in an evening but fine nightcap. Sierra Nevada Bigfoot is a little better in my opinion but this is now on short barleywine list."
"Drinkability: This is an awesome barleywine. I love the chocolate mixed with licorice. One of the best barleywines I've ever had. I'm sure the barrel aged version is fantastic. Worth seeking out."
"D: Smooth and creamy, but rather heavy and warm. Very good one at a time but not much of a session brew. As for a a barleywine style, this is pretty good and I would recommend it to those who enjoy this style."
""
"D: A slow sipper for sure. Tasty enough but I'm not sure I'll get it again unless it's in one of these mixed packs... just too many other good barleywines out there."
"D--Definitely a slow sipper, but not intimidating nor overwhelming."
"Good beer from a fun brewery."
"Drinkability: Just one at this time, for sure. This one just dominates the senses, and I'm not sure right now whether or not that's necessarily a good thing. It's a good, thick, malty experience... if not somewhat cloying."
"I enjoyed this barleywine from Flying Dog quite a bit. A slow drinker but good 'til the last sip."
"This is a very drinkable barley wine. Probably the best I have ever encountered. The alcohol is hidden. The flavor is sweet but balanced. The creamy fizz hangs on over time. I highly recommend trying this. if you are wanting to try a barley wine, put this at the top of your list. if you like barley wines, and havent experienced this yet, then you have GOT to look for it."
"Pours brown with good clarity and little head. No lacing. Sweet malty aromas balanced by a good dose of citrusy hops. The sweet malt and hops are pretty balanced as far as flavor goes as well. Not hot, but a good deal of hop bitterness that lingers. Fairly smooth, but not exactly creamy. The lingering hop bitterness cuts any stickiness. A good deal hoppier than the average English style barleywine, but a pleasant sipper. I've been enjoying a number of this brewery's bigger beers, I'm not so enamored of their sessionable ones though."
"seeking out more in the future. A great excuse for breaking out my ungainly snifters and perfect for when I want to sip on a beer as if it were a vintage port or a glass of Laphroaig."
"Drinkability: One of the great things about the majority of the American made English style barleywines that I've noticed is that they seem just a bit lighter and thinner aka more drinkable then their English counterparts. The drinkability isn't any better then say a Brooklyn Monster but it's more drinkable on a day to day basis then say Thomas Hardy's Ale or a JW Lees. Although those beers make up for their slight lack of drinkability with their aroma, look and flavor."
"Overall,good price good beer"
"D: I did enjoy it. Definitely a winter brew for Floridians."
"The taste was malty all the way with a licorice flavor and really sweet. In the mouth it was sharp alcohol most of the experience. Overall I thought it was an okay effort. Maybe I will try again someday."
"The beer isn't that drinkable because of the alcohol taste."
"A little rough around the edges."
"Thick, a bit syrupy, very low carbonation. Pretty alcoholic and sweet, I had to sip this one slowly. Not bad, but the syrupy taste was a bit overwhelming, I don't think I'd go out of my way for this if I was looking for a barleywine."
"This is a very mediocre beer and a pretty piss-poor barley wine. With the over the top sweetness and alcohol this beer is not enjoyable and you end up just trying to choke it down. Avoid this beer as it is not cheap and terrible for the style."
"A fairly decent English-style Barleywine from just an so-so brewer."
"Horn Dog pours a deep deep brown/ruby color with good off white fluffy head. Smell is fairly weak and smells malty with a suprising amount of hops in the nose. Taste is mostly malty, but there is a hop presence here that is strong for the english style. This defenitely leans to the english side of things, but has some american flavor. Raisiny dark fruit is present and some sugars. a little bit of a licoricey flavor towards the end that quickly mixes with the alcohol twinge. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, but still good. Drinkability is nice, but nothing amazing. I think this one could defenitely use a couple years in the cellar. A good beer."
"12 oz brown bottle. Unknown vintage. Appeared bottle conditioned. Served in a snifter. Poured a deep mahogany, with little carbonation. Very malty aroma, lots of caramel, some hops and a touch of alcohol. This thing is a malt bomb, lots of molasses, burnt sugar. Pretty muted hop bitterness. Hop aroma comes out as it warms. Very drinkable for a barley wine. The lack of hops led me to believe that it might have a little age on it. The vintage part of the label just said ""Vintage"" without a number."
"Smell is of sweet caramel/malts and dark fruits. Taste follows through with nose. Nice full body on palate, light carbonation adds to suitability. smooth finish with great balance."
"Pours basically black with a huge beige head in a snifter. Ruby edges when held to the light. From afar this looks like an imperial stout more than anything else. Smell is fruity, and malty mostly with a hint of staleness. Taste is a bit blandish with a unique roasty character for a barleywine. Now that I read the description, I'm definitely getting the licorice flavor as well. Somewhat of a dull cardboard like finish to it, and mild sweetness. Not particularly offensive, but not something I really cared for all that much, either. Something muted about the overall flavor to me. Average to slightly below average barley wine, to me, but still very easily drinkable for 10.5%, actually. Alcohol is basically non-existant in the flavor."
"D- pretty good, not the best barleywine ive had but worth the shot and the price."
"Drinkability is pretty high, a smooth and simpler English BW that goes down dangerously easy for it's size. Be careful!"
"D- For such a high ABV, this barleywine is very drinkable. No detection of alcohol which makes for an easy sipper."
"This is a unique barley wine and I enjoyed this very much. At least I have not had one that tastes like this. I drank two of these before I reviewed to make sure the taste and appeal was true to my first impression."
"A good addition to the barleywine family. A good beer to sip on and enjoy."
"Poured into a snifter. Dark ruby brown, with a miniscule head that soon disappears. Lacing is intermittent and watery. Aroma is sweet caramel malt and a touch of alcohol. Very malty flavor, with mostly caramel as opposed to toffee. Some alcohol soaked dark fruit. Hops are a little too prominent for this English style, and nothing really meshes all that well. Mouthfeel is markedly better than the rest of this beer. Smooth and full, easy to drink, not too boozy."
"Good beer - just have to learn how to drink it slower."
"Not the best or most balanced barleywine I've sampled, but certainly a good stab from Flying Dog and worth a shot..."
"d: Sweeter barleywines aren't my favorite to begin with, but when that sweetness brings little pink or blue packets to mind, it definitely isn't for me."
"D - Drinkability is good. I would not have any issues with trying to put down a few of these."
"Very tasty barleywine. A bit different than most. More malty and sweet, instead of hoppy, but very well put together."
"This reminds me of a chocolate caramel cake, and is very delicious. A welcome find, Horn Dog will find its way into my fridge porch again in no time. Good dog, very good dog."
"Overall, it's on the cloying side --- and this is coming from a decided malt-head --- but at the same time has a nice rich complex malt backbone."
"As I poured this beer, I was also looking at the bottle to get the name and data. As a result it foamed up a bit, and made a mess on my wife's just mopped floor. The hell with this I thought, unless this beer is awesome, I'm just going to pour it out and move on. And then I looked at the glass. Beautiful craggy head, more at home on a stout than a barley wine. The clour is also lovely red and deep brown. So I tasted it, and there it was, everything I love about a barley wine, malty and sweet, but still with a sting of hops. And alcoholic in a very tasty way as well. The mouth feel is full and pleasant, like a melty caramel. The only thing I didn't like was the aroma, kind of wort smelling in not a good way. All in all, I would drink this again."
"A diamond in the rough."
"Pours ruby milk chocolate with a thin deer hide head that remains afloat. Alcohol is certainly present in the nose, still quite hot. Bready, almondy, oaked and white wine in the nose. Taste is vanilla, some banana pudding, some toasted short bread, with an alcohol spicyness that finishes the sweetness off. Mouthfeel is smooth, and creamy. Carbonation is moderate, consisting of tiny bubbles that play across the tongue and help smooth out some of the alcohol. This is such a nice, malt bomb, sweet english barleywine, but only one for me, and after dinner please."
"Poured a hazy reddish/brown color with a small half finger head. Aroma was very malty with a good bit of caramel candy in the nose. Taste was caramelly as well, but surprisingly I could also pick up quite a bit of chocolate in the finish. This is the first beer I've had other than stout/porter that had this much chocolate flavor. Mouthfeel was thick and syrupy. Very satisfying for a cold and rainy night. Drinkability was excellent. The label on the back of the bottle stated an ABV of 10.3 percent, but damned if I could detect it. The alcohol is hidden very well with this beer. Recommended for those folks who need a break from hop monsters and desire something where malt takes center stage."
"The taste is malty with a bit of fruitiness, a syrupy mouthfeel and a strong finish. I don't have other brews of this style to compare to, but I definitely enjoyed this drink. I think I could drink a few of these back to back if given the opportunity."
"Overall- Very sweet 1 or 2 no more!"
"Drinkability: Tasty and smoother than many barleywines."
"A complex beer and makes for a good drink, gotta love the unabashfulness of Flying Dog."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a deep brown color with mahogany/ruby highlights and a thin head comprised of fine bubbles. The smell is very prominent, mostly fruitiness - dates, rasins and prunes come to mind, maybe a hint of vanilla and also a malty alcohol backbone. Very nice. The taste is similar to the nose, with the alcohol providing a warming effect and a dry finish. Sweet, but not too much so. The mouthfeel is full bodied with minimal carbonation. Overall this beer is very drinkable, enjoyable indeed."
"Drinkablity: Very flavorful. A great sipping beer, but not designed for the long haul."
"Pours a reddish brown with very little head. Smells of caramel, dark fruits (prunes and figs) and some subtle hops. Tastes malty up front with some chocolates and hops in the back. Not as sweet as expected, and not as robust as some of the other barley wines. The alcohol is pretty apparent, and once again, not hidden as well as others. This is not a big problem, as it lets me know what I'm getting myself into. Mouth-feel is light to medium bodied. Overall a decent barley wine that just misses the mark. That being said, it's up against some damn good competition."
"Thick and full to go along with the other characteristics. A good amount of carbonation keeps this one quite drinkable. Still a sipper, but very good. Super complex yet well balanced and under control."
"Notes: 12oz's was plenty for the night. A sipper and one that was better cold and still good as it warmed but I enjoyed it less at room temp as it got sickly sweet and sticky. A very good brew."
"Its a nice barley wine not outstanding but I wouldnt turn it down either"
"This is a very good barley wine, definitely something for enjoying over a lazy afternoon."
"An easy-drinking barleywine."
"Drinkability: A great after dinner sipper, of course. The hops make this somewhat more enjoyable to me."
"D: I had one, and was satisfied, it is just too rich for me to drink anymore than one. Very good but most definitley enjoyed one at a time."
"Overall: Not quite as enjoyable as their DIPA I had a few days ago, but very nice nonetheless. This is the season for Barleywine and for the price I will pick up a few more singles to sip on those rare cold Florida nights."
"This was my first barley wine style ale, but a enjoyed it very much. I was surprised that the high ABV did not ruin the flavors present. I would not want to drink several of them in succession myself, but I would recommend them to someone who desires a strong ale."
"Poured a dark brown color with small off-white head that disappeared in a hurry. Aroma is of yeast, dark fruit (figs, raisins), and caramel. Taste is pretty much the same. I thought this was decent, but nothing spectacular. Mouthfeel was good. Actually hides the alcohol pretty well, because I didn't realize it was 10.5%."
"I really like this beer, and will purchase more as I see it."
"Overall this is a very impressive beer. Clearly Flying Dog's best brew to date. The only drawback is the alcohol. It doesn't take long for the alcohol to be noticed. A very warming beer."
"drinkability - nice sipper for the end of the night. This would be a nice beer to age, too bad it is not in a bigger bottle."
"Pours a very dark brown. Tan head. Nose is like juicy raisins and cotton candy. Strong firm sugar candy-like tones rule here. Flavor is sticky sweet. Just screams sugar in your mouth. Molasses and anise character really sticks out. Feel is thick and full at first, but it falls off very quickly. I kind of feel like this one needs a lot more time to relax and mature in the bottle. Seems too much a kick in the mouth and not enough style and grace."
"Pours a murky brown/ amber color with a tan head. In the aroma, licorice, small alcohol and a smal presence of fruit. In the taste, sweet to dry licorice. Light body and smooth in the mouthfeel and a dry licorice in the aftertaste. Very interesting with licorice and just a small alcohol presence."
"A 12oz bottle poured into a tulip. It was a brown color with some red highlights. Small head. Nice carbonation. Sweet, fruity aroma, along with a little toffee. Likewise with the taste, except the alcohol clobbers you first. The strong alcohol taste fades as the beer warms, but it is still both noticeable and sharp."
"i also plan on laying three or four of these down for future reference. i think it's a keeper."
"Dark brown in appearance. Sticky lacing around the edges. Aromas of sweet malt, fruit cake, and toffee. Tastes of chocolate, malt, dark fruits, grapes, and carmel. Slightly sweet with some bitterness and booze to finish. Mouth feel is creamy and sticky. Drinkability is good. It is a bit on the boozy side though. Worth a try."
"Poured into a chalice a nice dark brown color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy tannish head, some sticky lacing around the edges. The nose is malty, slight toffee, and caramel. The taste is malty, slight toffee/roasty, nice little sweetness, and caramel. The alcohol is hidden very well. Medium body. Drinkable, this a very nice tasty EBW, recommended."
"I was very disappointed with this beer. I guess being spoiled with American-style barely wines, I could not take the tremendously sweet unbalanced malt. I drank one-and-a-half of these and the rest were dumped. Glad it was only a 4-pack."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into a pub glass. Poured a chocoalate color with little to no head. Smells like roasted malts and chocolate, with a roasted malt taste and a roasted almond aftertaste. This beer has a very light mouthfell that doesn't make you think your drinking a beer as dark as this. The drinkability of this beer is very easy and I can see myself drinking this beer anytime."
"I had a couple samples at the brewery today on a trip to purchase the barrel aged version. I had never had Horn Dog and I must say I am impressed. This beer has helped me understand the difference between English and American style barleywines. The color was dark, brown with a small bubbly head. The smells were dark fruits and heavy malts. The taste was very malty with hints of raisins, plums and more dark fruits. The hops have run for the hills letting me know that the British are coming! Overall, very easy to drink and too bad I haven't had it previously. The barrel aged bottles I will consume should make up for my past mistakes."
"A very nice barleywine. Perhaps some age will take off the astringency and build some more character and balance."
"D = This is a very drinkable beer, good to just sit back and enjoy."
"Thin mouthfeel with plenty of carbonation. Not what I expect in a barley wine. Drinkable and tasty just not what I expected."
"D: A little alcoholy, but smooth. Flying Dog is working its way up the ladder for me. Now if they would just tone down their art...nah!"
"Dark brown with amber shining through the glass around the edges. Fruity malty head. Nice smell. Sharp sweet malty taste. Nice berry flavor. Some caramel and buttery flavors. The alcohol is hidden really well considering it's 10.5. Smooth mouthfeel with a nice malty palate. This is an enjoyable brew. A little maltier than I expected from a barley wine."
"D- Dangerously quaffable."
"The best brew I can remember having from this brewery. Very solid."
"Drinkable, despite the strength."
"I am really impressed with the offerings that Flying Dog is putting out lately. As one of the few breweries that distribute a large selection of beers to Oklahoma, I am pretty impressed with most of their stuff. This was the most affordable Barleywine I have come across as of yet and it was just os good if not better than many more expensive offerings."
"Good stuff; just the thing for evenings in colder weather."
"Nice to have this one in 12 oz bottles. Good ""everyday"" barley wine to relax with. I'll buy more!"
"D- Not a very drinkable beer. I like it for sure, but one or two and you are toast!!!"
"This BW was very drinkable for me. But then again, I savored it. This is not a chug-a-lug brewski. Plenty of ""belt"" to allow one time to enjoy it. At about 10%ABV, there is no need to rush to the buzz. Given an evening of about three, or four, hours I could enjoy a four pack. But, one was plenty for fulfilling nightcap. Sight, nose, and taste made for a very pleasant and mellowing experience."
"Could definitely taste the alcohol in this one, but still very drinkable, probably could drinka 4 pack if you wanted to, that is what they are usually sold for, about 8.99 a peice"
"Drinkability- Very easy drinking and a very well balanced barleywine. A steal at the $1.49 I paid for the bottle."
"D - For a barleywine, this is very easy drinking. Too easy drinking. I can feel myself get drunker as I write this review. Not for the lite beer fan. Definitely NOT."
"The mouthfeel is a bit too thin for what I like in a barleywine. It has a medium/light body that isn't as satisfying as a heavy/chewy BW."
"Overall Impression: Mild papery note in the finish is a tad disappointing, but its nitpicking on a great beer. Alcohol is very potent, Id better type quickly before mother funktons becoom impaared."
"Poured from the 12oz bottle into a Maudite snifter. Body is a deep reddish brown, accompanied by a thin ring of creamy, off-white head. Aroma of sweet, bready malt, a touch of brown sugar, and mild fruit (plum?). Palate is sweet up front, with caramel and a bit of dark malt accompanied by a mild bready character. Some fruity flavors emerge mid-palate, before the warm, almost buttery finish. Body is substantial and a bit thick, but not very sticky. Overall, an approachable barleywine, and a decent representation of the English style. I prefer the hoppier American style barleywines, but this is indeed an enjoyable beer."
"Mouthfeel is lighter, still a little grippy, and I hate to say it, but starting to lean toward watery. We seem to have lost that lovely 6 month carbonation."
"D- Limited drinkability like most Barleywines, the abv is significant and does not lend to extended drinking, but this is definitely a flavorful and complex barleywine that would be a great after-dinner quaff, I would pick this up again if I were in the mood for this genre"
"If I had known how good Horn Dog is, I would have cracked the crown on this pooch long before now. I remember seeing 4-packs at a local beer store recently. Looks like I'll have to stop in and buy a few for the cellar. This is Flying Dog's best beer... paws down."
"Mouthfeel is a bit sticky, but the carbonation is in place and everything is on par for the style. Drinkability even with the style given is a low given the booze taste, overwhelming sweetness and lack of depth in flavor. Its okay, but needs some tightening up."
"D- I really like this and am pretty mad at myself for not buying it a lot sooner. Just a great cheaper barleywine. Great balance between fruits, hops, and malts."
"Drinkability: You can feel the alcohol but not taste it. A nice example of the style. Ive got one more and 2 aging."
"Taste, mouthfeel, drinkability - don't even bother with this cold. Cold, this tastes and feels like a mouthful of alcohol. Every bit of that 10.5% ABV is out there asserting itself. It's pretty bad. Hang in there, the rewards are coming. You get more sweet raisin bread and vinous overtones and less alcohol with every degree of warming. The alcoholic aspect never really goes away, though. We've all seen 10% concealed much better than this. Sweet and sticky, but not overarchingly so - I'm definitely getting *some* earthy hop bittering action keeping the sweetness of the strong malt bill under relative control. Somewhat odd thin feel for such a substantial beer. Hate to be a broken record, but I concur with others when I want to say that this barleywine skates on the edges of brilliance without ever really crossing the line. Still, hardly a poor way to spend an early evening....an enjoyable sipper that might perhaps benefit from even more aging. Maybe 2-3 years."
"Drinkability - this is excellent ale, and only the high abv limits the sessionability."
"Overall, semi-recommended. It's not bad - it's just not all that great."
"An OK Barley Wine but not a great one. I think I prefer the Double Dog Pale Ale better."
"D: A good stab at the style, the strong alcohol prescence gives it a whiskey-type feel going down, which takes away from its drinkability. Would like to see what a couple years in the cellar would do to this brew, a solid effort."
"This beer pours a dark brown, almost black, color. The head is small even after a vigorous pour. Lacing is thin. The aroma is very lively. Caramel, nuts, toffee, cocoa, graham crackers, and alcohol. The taste combines everything from the aroma, but in a slightly less boisterous appearance. The mouthfeel is full bodied, velvety, and appropriately low in carbonation. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that mingles along the fringes of greatness, but doesnt quite seem to what it hard enough."
"Anyway, pours a dark ruby, slightly cloudy with plumes of dirty white head. Aromas are a rich mix of chocolate and toasted malts. A lot of caramel is in there too with a tinge of banana and clove and finishing very alcoholic. Likewise, on the palate it's quite big bodied, thick and almost stout like. It's a mellow mix of sweet malts, lots of banana, dark ripe fruits with little to no hop presence which is fine for style. Compared to other EBWs, this one doesn't get cloying, but rather the alcohol seems to keep it in balance along with the smooth complexity of malts. I could see this puppy aging nicely, but it doesn't have any rough edges to smooth out right now."
"Drinkability: Good, but alcohol is high and becomes increasingly ""hot"" as the beer warms."
"A delicious one that I want to thank bitterbill for including in our trade!"
"I picked this up not knowing what to expect, as I've never had a barley wine. Well, I was pleasantly surprised. It poured a darkish brown, with minimal head. Not quite as dark as stout. The smell was quite nice, but the kicker for me was the great taste. I expected an obnoxious over-the-top and alcohol heavy bitter taste. What I got was a mellow brew with exception malt and barley flavoring that masks the high-alcohol volume content exceptionally well. This one is a keeper and I will continue to buy more of these in the future."
"Drinkability of this beer is a sipper, but a pleasure to drink."
"Bottle courtesy of Okbeer: Poured a deep brown color ale with a small foamy head with some retention and light lacing. Aroma of sugar is so pronounced that it gets quite gross and doesnt allow for any other aspects of the beer to come through. Taste is also dominated by the sweetness and doesnt allow much else to come through. I didnt notice any large hops presence which could have mitigated some of the sweetness. Average body with some medium-low carbonation. Definitely not something that I feel the need to revisit anytime soon."
"D - despite high abv, if this brew is sipped slowly a few could be had over the course of an evening. Great brew to wash down a rich chocolate cake or with dark chocolates."
"Drinkability - As mentioned, this is a sipper to end an evening. I was suprised by how much it stood up to other English Barley Wines I've had. The three other partners that came in the four-pack will age for a year to see how well this one matures. Good attempt and worth a try."
"This beer is a semi-cloudy purple with a thin head receding to a line around the edge of the glass. The smell has hints of fruits, most prominatly grapes. There is a hint of fruit in the taste as well. There is also hints of the abv. This beer is a sipper for sure. The higher abv is noticable but overall this beer is quite smooth. Some hops are also noticable. A fairly good barleywine. Probably one of the brewers better efforts."
"It poured a dark red with lots more head than barley wines usually have. Aroma is deep and a malty smell that is roasty rather than sweet and has some sourness. Flavor is coffee up front and at the finish, with some out-of-place sour notes. Mouthfeel is fairly carbonated, again not typical of the barley wine style. Not bad."
"D- rather drinkable for a barleywine... it's good."
"D - This beer is definitely worth a try if you like barleywines. However I wont be back for another. This one was a bit rough around the edges and hard to get down at times."
"Bottom line: An excellent sipping BWSA that I have no qualms in recommending. See some, get some."
"Slightly warming, but not boozy. In fact, I would not have guessed this was over 10%. Fully body, low carbonation. Full of good fruit flavors. Very much a sipping beer. I enjoyed this one."
"I had high hopes for this as I was really in the mood for an English barleywine, but this was a disappointment. Not difficult to drink, but thoroughly uninspired. Only recommended to those who desire something mediocre to drink."
"appearance is dark brown-root beer in color with some white lacing. Smells like alcohol and raisins. The taste is very strong of alcohol but after having a few sips carmel toffee and grapes can be tasted. Mouthfeel is good-medium body with light carbonation. Not very drinkable due to the high alcohol content and the insescent taste of alcohol."
"This brew poured a muddy, brown, flat, syrup. Possibly the ugliest i've ever seen. No carbonation or head to speak of, but aromas range from dark fruits and alcohol to overly sweet candi sugar. Mouthfeel is heavy and sticky but falls flat with no bubbly goodness, just an alcoholic burn. There is some bitterness, not sure if it is from over roasted malts or slight hops infusion. A very hard beer to finish, the astringency got much worse as it warmed. Potent and a definite challenge to the palate."
"All-in-all a decent American Barleywine...definitely not a spectacular or even a stand out American barleywine, but decent."
"D - Tasty but became boozier as it warmed and lost some of its complexity."
"I don't mind English barleywines, but this one is all out of whack. The requisite flavors are there, but they are jarring and clashing with each other, not melding like they should. I am going to lay down a bottle or two to see if it improves with time. But I generally like my barleywines somewhat fresh to get the most out of the hops...and this is one that should not be drunk right out of the gate."
"Drinkability: not my favorite barleywine but a nice one to try. Very scary labels from flying dog!"
"Dark ruby-red color with a small tannish head. Aroma is strongly vinous, sweet, and noticibly alcoholic (the latter detracting somewhat). Taste is solidly malty, with rich and bready (and heady) flavors, pleasantly caramalized fruit notes, and a touch of alcohol but not as much as I feared from the nose. Warming in the finish, with a full, creamy body."
"D - A really good brew; despite the alcohol content, it's one I could definitely have a couple of; the flavor and smell are just excellent"
"Pours a murky ruby copper color with only a thin head that quickly vanishes without a trace. The nose has a candy-like sweetness with notes of dark fruit, brown sugar, buttery caramel, and spicy alcohol. Taste begins with a dark cherry syrupy sweetness along with a bit of fig and prune. This is blended with a rum-raisiny spicy alcohol and some dry grain. Enjoyable but the sweetness is bordering on being cloying."
"Yeah this is great. Nice color, with a nice red/brown hue. Smell is good, with a good barleywine smell. Yeah, that's what it smells like. Tasty. Malty, fruity; with bananas, plums, fruitcake, cinnamon, meat, etc. Good mouthfeel, not great though. A little tart. Nice and drinkable. Good shit. Good night."
"d: have tried a number of barleywines & have to rank this one up there because of its balance, crisp finish & moderate sweetness. will continue to buy this one"
"Tastes toffee, rich caramel, and chocolate. Nice sherry oxidation is very mild. Alcohol not as hot as in previous years, but is still a player. Simple for the style. Md body that's minimal dextrin character. Lightly carbonated and decent drinkability."
"2006A. Dark reddish brown with just a skim of lace capping the beer (though it is very long-lived). Spotty lacing, some haziness. Big caramel/toffee aroma with significant fruit character and a touch of bready yeast and some alcohol. Hops are muted and seem to be more earthy and floral at this point, with just a hint of orange. Wow, this is thick and heavy. Hop bitterness seems weaker than it is due to the strong malt sweetness. There's a lot of caramel, with milder notes of toffee, freshly ground grain, and hints of chocolate. Fruity flavour is more attenuated, mostly prunes and a little raisin. Hop flavour provides some depth, but is definitely not the star of the show. Low carbonation and just short of sticky. Mild alcohol warmth. This is certainly in the English BW camp. Solid malting makes this a good offering. The alcohol is tamed by the sweetness, making for a fairly drinkable barleywine. I enjoyed this and would recommend it to those seeking something more in the English style."
"This beer poured a hazy deep brown color with a thing but nice creamy head  no noticeable lacing. The smell was sweet and malty, a bit like caramel. The taste is strong of malt. It is very sweet and not overly hoppy. This beer is quite deceptive because the flavor does a good job of hiding the high alcohol content in the taste buds (but it does do a good job of warming your insides).. The mouthfeel is thick and leaves a nice coating. Overall, Id say this beer is very smooth and I find it to be quite delicious!"
" Wavz"
"Pours with some draping of head. A fine mahogany colour, some brown, some red, all blended finely together. A rich aroma, sticky hop resin with piney wood coating. A base of sweet, roast malt - dark and chocolaty. Mouthfeel holds itself well, a low carbonation but heavy enough body to carry the flavours. Taste of dried fruit and dark chocolaty malts. Lots of prune and raison as well as a considerably balanced and intricate malt bill. Bits of spice and more than a fair bit of flavour. Alcohol noticeable but not a distraction. A good offering!"
"D - The beers flavor doesn't suit my tastes very much. Also I think that for the style,Barleywines should be able to hide their alcohol presence better."
"Poured a thick, opaque dark chocolate brown with a cream colored head that would not fade. Smell was Spicey and citrusy hopped, with hints of caramel and chocolate and jus tabout anything else you could think of. Taste was very very sweet, almost like candy, with hints of alcohol and a dry hoppy finish. Very smooth going down, but the high ABV could sneak up on you. All in all this is a good Barleywine, I will definatly drink this again, just not too many in one sitting!!"
"A great example of the benefits of cellaring. I will miss you when you are gone Horn Dog."
"A bit closer to an american barleywine than english as the style here lists. Hnts of good things to come if cellared. I'd put a 6 or 12 pack in the cellar and age it for a few years to see how it changes over time."
"D - I wanted to find a barleywine to keep on hand, and this is in the running for that selection. At $7/sixpack, I'd pick one up again for sure."
"In general, I'm not a huge Flying Dog fan, but Gonzo and Horn Dog are pleasant enough. It certainly isn't the most aggressive or well-balanced barley wine I've had, but it's worth a look: a strong product from an overrated brewery. It's also reasonably priced in a four pack..."
"Again, this one was enjoyable. A lot easier drinking than I expecting as barleywines aren't usually my thing. Definitely worth a shot."
"This review is of a sampling of an 06. The brew poured a dark brown / plum color with a small offwhite ring of a head that left some lacing. Taken to the nose , aromas of dark brown bread , slight chocolate , a hint of raisin or plum , a bit of buttery character, and some alcohol. Flavor is of very full , dark bready malt , some toffee, again some hints at a chocolate flavor , some slight candied dark fruit flavors , bitter edge and some alcohol presence in the finish. The mouthfeel is slick and viscous. This barleywine is quite drinkable , and has some very nice flavors that come out nicely with age."
"i don't make a habit of drinking cough syrup and i won't make a habit of drinking this..."
"Body is full, thick, and oily. Light carbonation. Perfect for the syle. Alcohol isn't too present even at over 10% and its awesomely good."
"After a while, flavor starts to seem more and more like cough syrup. This started out great, but it slowly became hard to finish. Ended up being too heavy for my mood today. I think this would be a good one to split up to share with company before a meal. Leave them wanting more."
"Final Statement: This was my first barely wine, and it's rather intersting. I wouldn't call myself a barley wine fan just yet. The flavours are very very complex, and will take a lot of getting used to. But this brew is pretty good, I will review it again at later date."
"A nice malty barley wine but some harsh edges on this young sample. Needs cellaring a year or so."
"Purchased: Plaza Liquors, Tucson AZ"
"I've been craving a good barley wine for a few days so thought i would give this one a try. As I poured it I wasnt expecting a beer this dark, a hard pour left only lacing for a head. Smell is a boozey brown sugar similar to dark rum, really interesting. Taste is rich sugary, followed by a blast of alcohol and finishing with pleasent hop bitterness. This is pretty damn good. Mouthfeel is full bodied, coats my mouth well, and leaves me wanting more. Drinkability is high for me for a barley wine, definitly gonna pick a few of these up and maybe lay a couple down for awhile. A really pleasent, easy to drink, affordable barley-wine."
"Decent body but could be heavier. I like it but it's not my favorite. A good cool evening brew."
"D- Nice for sipping. Not for pounding. Relax, share with company before/during dinner, maybe a nice coffee or chocolate porter after dinner to balance it out."
"Overall. I am mixed this beer. I like it 50% of the time, the other 50 i respect it. A fine beer, but not one i would want too often."
"Fairly one dimensional english barley wine to me. The alcohol overwhelmed all the other flavors. Glad I tried it, but won't be going back here."
"Horn Dog Barley Wine pours a very dark brown (but shine a flashlight through it and it's red) with a half inch light brown head that quickly dies down to a ring around the edge. Comes in a twelve ounce brown bottle. The aroma is appropriately malty and vinous. Nice full mouthfeel. Flavor is malty then vinous, supported by a nice balance of hops toward the end. Some chocolate or roasted notes are present in the backgrouond. Nicely balanced, it has a fair amount of alcohol warming that is noticeable too. Fairly dry finish. The bottle says this is a 2006 vintage. Recommended."
"2007 edition on tap at Fallen Rock, great aroma, sherry taste. Understated carbonation.That's my upgrade."
"It was a slow drink but I really couldn't tell that the abv is high."
"D: Quite good."
"A strong pour coaxed a luscious one finger head out of this beast, which receded to surface bubbles and a ring in a minute or so. The head's color is parchment tan. The beer's body, when not backlit, appears a mysterious deep ruby-brow. This is a very dark ale, and a light behind penetrates just enough to produce a fiery glow. Deep and rich malt greets the nose, as well as juicy cherries, molasses, and toffee. The taste is somewhat raisiny, with port coming through, and a whole slew of dark fruits, as well. Very sweet, and quite alcoholic. I can't comment on hop flavor or bitterness, but I imagine they are here, keeping the malt from absudity. Somewhat dry at the very start of the sip, but this doesn't last. Carbonation is almost non-existent, and the huge body leads to a syrupy thick mouthfeel. A marvelous, joy-inducing barleywine."
"As for drinkability, like many barley wines, it's not an everyday beer, nothing you can kick back a few of without feeling incredibly woozy. So, an occasional treat."
"Poured into a pint glass, dark reddish brown with tan head. Smells like alcohol mainly, with malt and some hops behind that. The taste is caramel with significant hop bitterness and alcohol burn going down. I think I will let a few sit awhile and see if that mellows. The mouthfeel is thick and sticky,with little carbonation, as you'd expect with a barleywine. At this time I would rate drinkability pretty low because of the alcohol and the bitterness. Maybe it will get better."
"Pretty good brew would have been better on a cold winter night instead of the middle of summer though."
"A solid beer, but not a great example of the style and it could have used some more complexity. The bottle has aged about a year, but for a 10.5%er that shouldn't be anything."
"Feeling of warming alcohol."
"This crap was really bad. Very malty aroma, which was okay, poured to a brown with hints of red. However, the taste was a mixture of malt and rubbing alcohol, and it left a very bitter, bad aftertaste. The worst thing was, I had it as the third of 3 taste tests of Flying Dog, after a few beers on the golf course, and it still tasted this bad."
"Pours a dark brown in color with hints of red and a cream to tan colored head that fades to a ring around the glass. Smells of sweet fruit, plums, caramel malt, dry red wine, and a litlle boozy. My first impression of the taste is that it is fairly hoppy for an english bw, more an american style imo. There is a medium bodied cola - vanilla sweetness up front followed by a slight peppery and smoky tingle on the tongue which finishes with a nice hop bitterness and a little alcohol. Overall, an enjoyable hoppy strong ale/barleywine that I would drink again."
"Overall I like the fresh stuff much better for this year."
"Just the slightest film and ring of head, but an amazing color, deep brown with a slight burgundy tinge. The smell is of a strong malty and fruity character, with noticeable floral and citrus hops. Initially, I couldn't figure out if I liked the taste much for the first part of the beer, but by the end all of the flavors became a bit more noticeable. This is a quite sweet and fruity barley wine, with a lot of deep flavor like plums and wine grapes which helps mask the alcohol like a liquour. Definitely some deep caramel and almost red malt flavor, with some spicy hops in the finish. Decent mouthfeel. Consume with caution, these puppies are good, but strong."
"Pours a nearly opaque rusty garnet hue beneath a few fingers of capuccino froth, leaving a sheet of soapy lacing trailing down from the gold rim of my Gulden Draak tulip. Nose is fruity up front, with notes of cherry cider, white grape, and fig over sopping grapefruit hops. Taste is cherry yogurt, brandy soaked raisins, over caramel malt with a light herbal hop finish. Mouthfeel is creamy and luxurious yet not chewy enough to bog you down. The alcohol is there, but there's enough complexity in the nose and palate to balance it out. A top notch barley wine here, caught me a little off guard as I had, until now, yet to be impressed by the Flying Dog I've had outside of Gonzo. One of the best barley wines I've had to date."
"Overall: I wanted to get a chance to try this one for a while. Thanks to Gentlemen BA BigHuge I now had the opportunity to do so. Worth waiting for, and one of the better offerings from Flying Dog."
"Not the most adventurous or daring of examples (could it be my bottled has mellowed this much already?) but altogether fairly balanced and pleasant. Some among us (myself included) would like more hops, but there are certainly enough BWs out there to fill that need (see Hog Heaven!)."
"D - Ok fellers lets be honest here... this IS a barleywine which in all forms and brands tends to be pretty damn strong so i am not going to say id drink these all night but i have sure had no trouble taking down 3 of them tonight.... i totally like this beer i think all beer lovers should try it once. i will definitely be getting it again as soon as i see it..try it with foods... i had nachos with it and it went surprisingly well with that ...i love it love it love it"
"This is definately a sipping drink. Warms the palate nicely, especially outside on a cool evening. Couldn't drink a lot in a row, however, but one glassfull hits the spot."
"12oz bottle: This one pours a caramel brown color. It was pretty much devoid of head. The aroma is sweet, but not overly so. Mainly caramel notes, but also some alcohol coming through. Maybe some plums also. The taste is OK. Not the best barleywine Ive had, but far from the worst. The taste is caramel malt, with some dates and plums. Also some of the alcohol comes through. A suprisingly lighter body than I would expect."
"I split this beer with a buddy and I believe this is all I could drink. The horndog is tasty but its not your grandmaws beer. If you drink this beer you are a memeber of my new special club."
"Deep burgundy hue. Astonishingly alcoholic and malty nose providing a suggestion of chocolate, black licorice and pit fruit, but mainy just a huge spark of alcohol. Flavor is heavily rich, but still relatively light in body and texture. Sweet and malt accented with sugared fruit flavors and a mild chocolate hint. The unfortunate combination of low hop flavor and bitterness matching an overly sweet barley wine with poorly hidden alcohol. Im not sure what this is trying to be."
"The taste is big. The brown sugar slides in with a hint of maple syrup. The finish has a ruby port finish with a backing of bitters from hops. A good example of the maltier style of barley-wines."
"Looks like a liquid ruby in my glass. The head is like sunshine on a winter day, it makes an appearance but leaves far too quickly. Smells like mild fruits. The taste is syrupy malt that reminds me of dried cherries with just a hint of chocolate. Hop bitterness is almost nonexistent. No lacing. It tastes pretty good but not one to hurry home to by any means."
"A huge beer, but a bit easier to drink than many barleywines. No less dangerous, however."
"Pretty decent offering. Check it out if you get a chance."
"The label is typically fun, and the name reasonably comical, but they just might be the high points. Don't get me wrong, there's nothing particularly bad here, and in fact, it's tasty, but the flavor is a tad thin and it progresses a bit rapidly for my preference. The ABV is certifiable, and it does limit, but it warms nicely as well. It's not a bad beer, but with so many barelywines out there, this one could get lost in the crowd."
"The beer pours a deep ruby red, almost no head. I've read warnings about the yeast in this one so I was careful to avoid it. Smell is a deep sweet maltiness, revealing the hop bite to come. I can smell the alcohol a little bit, but its well hidden in the flavor. Taste is sweet and malty, with a strong assertive hop flavor and bitterness. I taste raisins and caramel in the malts, followed by the almost citrus hop flavor. Nice lingering flavor, I could only drink one of these a night, but its a good example of the style."
"Pours a very dark brown with plenty of ruby glints throughout, and a small, fizzy tan head that dissipates pretty quickly, as is to be expected with a higher-octane brew like this, and leaves a patch of surfacing bubbles. Smell is strong and complex, with plenty of rum, raisin, licorice, apple, and dark fruitiness. Taste is equally powerful and deep, with the same rum flavours that were in the smell, alongside rich fruits and sweet maltiness. The alcohol is certainly present, but in a warming, inviting and pleasant way. Mouthfeel is thick and clinging, leaving a lingering aftertaste with noticable but understated carbonation. Drinkability is good, keeping in mind that this is definitely a brew to enjoy and savour. A very nice and interesting beer, perfect for a cold, windy night."
"Dark amber brown pour from the bottle. Little to no head as should be expected from the style. No lacinc. Sweet dark aroma. I like the taste. Sweet malty, slightly grainy, there is more here but I can not explain it. A very nice Barleywine. I would definitley like to have this one again."
"I picked up a case of this for under $30, thinking it'd be a great deal. Flying Dog: 1; Goochpunch: 0"
"Thanks to Beerbeing of the bottle."
"Have a bottle saved from the four pack that I will purposely forget about and review again."
"Pours a deepslightly hazy amber with a thinner off white head that is gone pretty quickly,aromas are juicy fruity with raisin/prune note as well with a real noticable alcohol tinge as it warms.This is more of an English style barley wine for sure flavors of dark fruit that of raisin prune a little plum with some brown sugar in the finish with alcohol burn becoming more noticable as I drink more.Not bad a pretty solid offering from FD but not up to par with its Colorado bretheren Old Ruffian ( but what barley wine is),and Hog Heaven."
"Pours a very dark mahogany color and is almost purple with an off white head. Strong spicy smells with bits of alcohol in the nose. Strong malts are present and I think I smells bits of fruits. The taste is strong and thick bodied with the alcohol hidden but warms the stomach. Sweet but hidden again by the hops and their spiciness. There is also a twang or bite that goes along with the big hops. Really a pretty smooth beer that goes over well but it is a bit milder than most huge american barleywines. The aftertaste is strong and warming and I'd say the best part is that it is not too intimidating."
"Taste; those dark fruits stand out up front with figs and raisins. There's also sweet molasses and caramel malts followed by a nice hop bitterness and a bit of an alcohol bite. Mouthfeel is full and a bit oily. This is one of the better Flying Dog brews I've had so far."
"Not a bad barleywine, pretty reasonably priced."
"12 ounce bottle. 2003B if I read the label correctly (this one has been around awhile so I probably did)."
"Drinkability: Careful with this one. It's a sipper. The alcohol is there but not overpowering. I found this to be a nice barleywine. Interesting and powerful enough to respect but not such a challenge to destroy the palate."
"In conclusion, there are probably better versions of this style out there, but I don't know what they are."
"Pours a dark bronze/burnt red color. The head is tight tan foam and settles down fairly quick. Aroma is dark fruit, caramel malt, and yeast. The flavors are interesting...this is a malt bomb for sure..the sweetness is nearly overwhelming. You can tell the alcohol is there, but it's actually pretty well hidden. Very full mouthfeel and there's a wonderful creaminess to it as it warms. Could use some more hops, but that's only my opinion. A quality big brew from Flying Dog."
"Simple but tasty barleywine and for $8/4-pack its a great beer for when you're in the mood for a barleywine."
"This effort was superior to last year's sampling IMHO. Very drinkable for its strength. I will have to go buy anither 4 pack to lay down"
"This is an ok barleywine if you have your heart set on one and it's the only one available. Personally, this won't stop me looking for Bigfoot. Again, the Ralph Stedman artwork on the label is the most interesting thing about a Flying Dog beer."
"Light mahogany to dark copper in color, very clear with a thin tan colored head. The head does leave a nice sheet of lace on the side of the glass as I drink the beer. The aroma is very sweet with port/sherry notes , some toffee and peanut brittle, and a lot of fig. I didnt see any notes on oak aging of this beer, but there is some sherry and vanilla which might indicate this is the case. The flavor is very light, sherry, figs, not really any citrus in the taste. There is a mild bitterness, but it is very disguised. The mouth feel is smooth, and slightly oily, good drinkability. There is a mild alcohol arming, but it doesnt burn."
"Poured into a pint glass. Beer poured a dark color, seeming to be brown with just a slight hue of ruby. Smell is of sweet malt with hints of plum and cherry. Malty taste with hints of dark fruit and alcohol warmth. Mouthfeel is thick and slightly syrupy. Drinkability is good, I enjoy the sipping on it, however, one seems to be enough for an evening, but perhaps I'll have another."
"Pours a reddish- hued caramel with the typical minimal head and light carbonation. Smells like burnt sugar and a little bit o' pine. Taste is a bit sweet and spicy. Has a bit of coarse bite to it. Warms going down. Feels slick in the mouth, but not too sweet. Nice little winter sipper. Drinks easier than many examples, even if a little less complex."
"Drinkability: This came across as a pretty average barley wine, not one that left me wanting another."
"I was sucked into Flying Dog by Gonzo Porter. Gonzo Porter is not representative of Flying Dog products."
"12 oz bottle poured into a snifter, this is a really dark brown with a thin head that fades quick, some small spotty lacing. Nose is sweet malt, plums, brown sugar, and a slight bit of alchohol. Taste is sweet and syrupy, very butterscotchy, some fruit notes, with a slight bit of spiciness at the end. The sweetness is a little cloying after a bit. This is an OK barleywine, but a little too one-dimensionally sweet for my taste, could definitely use a big dose of hops."
"This pours a dark reddish brown,but the head is almost non existent.The smell is a nice spice filled,hearty, earthy,malt filled aroma,your typical barleywine.This has a nice warming alcohol taste with spices,cinnamon,nutmeg,and roasted malt.The m/f is heavy and the flavors are well balanced.This is a very good beer and I will have this again,and I would have rated this higher if it had a better head."
"Drinkability: I had a real hard time reviewing this one, as I do not drink Barley Wines of the English (read: non-hop bomb) variety often at all. I might say this was a bit unbalanced, but I understand that English Barley Wines tend to emphasize the malts very much. With that in mind, a very enjoyable brew, although one that will last me throughout the night."
"Not a bad beer. I not a huge barleywine drinker, but this strikes me as one of the more subdued of those that I've tried. I liked it."
"Slick, alcoholoc mouthfeel. Definitely in your face body. Fairly drinkable, although the alcohol isn't well hidden. Good beer overall."
"This beer has been one of several recent factors that made me realize that for now at least, my favourite style is English and not American Barleywines....I like those too though!...just marginally less."
"12 ounce bottle. Horn Dog ale pours out a dark ruby color with no head, even with a hard pour. Sweet, malty aroma with a little dark fruit and noticable alcohol. I find it hard to do the aroma justice with words, since the words that keep coming to my mind are ""it has a perfect barleywine aroma."" Big malty, caramel flavor with lots of raisons and licorice. Lots of hop flavors too, but this beer is so malty, the hop flavors play a supporting role. Thick mouthfeel. I don't know how, but the flavor is never cloying. I've never been a big Flying Dog fan: their ipa is terrible, and even the Gonzo porter I thought was only ok. This beer, however, is terrific. One of the best American Barleywines I've had."
"This is a quality brew, but much too sweet for my likings."
"Overall drinkability is average, much like the taste. I like it okay, and the high alcohol is a selling point, but there's lots of other stuff I like way better."
"Drinkability: a very tasty beer, I'll try to get a fresh one to confirm my susupicions of age"
"Overall a nice beer."
"When poured a very thick, dark copper brown in color with absolutely no foam. The smell of hops was of a pine nature with a hint of citrus. The taste had a flavor of a piney and citrus on the palate. It had a sour/sweet/bitter finish and was not that impressed. For a barley wine, it was just average compared to others."
"This may be the most available Barley Wine found in North Carolina and even though this may not be one of the best for the style, it's a great starter for the style. Unlike Stone's BW, this one does not pack such an overwhelming punch and not as many will back down. It's a milder, less alcohol infused brew that will become popular in this area. I will definitely share this one with others willing to try out new styles but may not have the palate that others (not yet me) may have. Nice artwork on the label."
"I think one of these beers is enough at one time. A bit too sweet for session consumption. Not my favorite BW."
"However, do not let this deter you from trying this beer.... top notch from Flying Dog... now to try Gonzo =P"
"Drinkability: If it weren't for the finish, this would be an exceptional barleywine"
"This is probably the most drinkable barley wine I've yet encountered, at least until the next time Big Foot meets my lips."
"Overall, I don't believe that it was a good barleywine. The drinkability of a barleywine is generally less than that of other beers to begin with... more of an aperitif (last beer of the day, but biggest and best). I believe that this one did not hit the mark."
"Body is almost big, very smooth and velvet-like, with a creamy soft texture. A sessionable Barleywine in my book. An under rated one at that."
"Pours a cloudy, deep brown/burgundy with a nice tan head that doesnt retain that well but it is a barley wine so its forgiveable. Aroma is intensely malty, with scents of dark fruit (plum, currant, blackberry), molasses, and a light floral hops aroma. Flavor is similar with dark malt notes dominating, flavors of currant, plum, blackberry and grape with a sweet background of caramel and molasses, followed by a floral and mineraly hops flavor that quickly segues into a sweet and alcohol ridden finish. Mouthfeel is adequate though slightly light for the style and the alcohol is very noticeable. And drinkability is average. A good attempt at an english barleywine, the malt definately takes precedence though i think it could use some more hops . Interesting for sure, but not a remarkable brew."
"i dont really like flying dog beers. I guess I used to before I was turned into a beer snob or whatever. This stuff doesn't need to be purchased unless it is the only barleywine available"
"Intriquing beer. Pours a thick ruby or mohogany with a chunky tan head. Low carbonation and laced well. Smells malty, and of dark fruits. Hop aroma smells salty and earthy. Tastes of malt, cherries, figs, prunes, and dates. A bit nut like and hop bitterness. Thins a bit in the body. Finishes sweet and a bit cloying. Cut nicely by the hops. An aggressive beer--what you'd expect from flying dog, but there are better barley wines out there. Wonder how this one would fare in a year or so."
" The taste is of sweet malt followed by moderate alcoholic overtones. I don't mind the alcoholic presence, but there isn't enough malt to back it up. I detect cherry and grape infused with an ever so slight hop presence. Ever so slight. The mouthfeel is thinner than I expect from this style. Drinkability is only limited by the fact that there are better barleywines both out there and in my cellar. And I must... not... drink...my ...cellared...beers...yet. This brew is well priced, even though it may only be mediocre. I might buy more to cellar for a short time."
"EDIT: Had this again in May of 2008. Caramel sweetness reminds me of a doppelbock. This is still a winner!"
"Mouthfeel is fairly thick and slightly syrupy. Coats the mouth as it goes down. Definetly a sipping brew. The drinkability is hindered here by the apparent alcohol. Drinking one after a hard day of work is great...but I can't see much more than that. Worth a try!"
"This beer was chock full of malt, as evidenced by the aroma and the fact that it left my lips sticky. However, it just didn't come through enough on the flavor, especially for and English style barley wine. It was not bad, though, and really very drinkable."
"But also as most b-wines, you wouldnt want to have more then 1 or 2 tops in an evening."
"Nice carbonation level for the style and a medium to heavy body."
"The beer pours a dark brown color with a thin offwhite head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a rich and complex malt scent along with a solid hop aroma. It boasts of pale, crystal, and roasted malts. The taste is good. It has a very bitter hop taste along with a sloid malty base. It's rich and dark with a warm finish; very flavorful. The mouthfeel is good. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a fine barley wine. It is hoppier than most and I like it; good drinker."
"Vintage 2004 - *Cut the leash* !! First barley wine, and what a treat. Everything that the BA description noted. From the mahogany brown pour with small tan head to the lite malt, clerry aroma, I knew this type would be up on my preference list. Oh the taste, a malted whiskey that slides down smooth, even with the strong alcohol. Thick and chewy, warm and drinkable. Great sipping stuff!"
"The beer was poured out of the 12 oz. bottle, with a psychedelic and a bit disturbing label. The pour was deep reddish brown, with a thin and short lived head. Lacing was very good, although the carbonation was quite limited. The aroma was typically English. Restrained, earthy, and spicy hops in the nose were tempered by fig, and vanilla scents. The taste was malt driven, and was primarily sweet and buttery. Dry fruit flavors of fig, raisins, and a bit of toffee, was mixed in with soy saltiness, and a chalky mineral dryness. The hop bitterness was not match for the sweet palette, but did provide a decent backdrop at the end of each sip. Alcohol was hot with a peppery aftertaste, but otherwise well hidden under the layers of complimentary flavors. Thick and soothing, this is a very good nightcap sipper."
"I won't buy this again, and I don't recommend it."
"($6.99 / 4-pack)"
"I'm not very enthusiastic about this beer. While it does have some fine qualities, it lacks a great deal of character. Still, it's quite drinkable as it is just fine and dandy in the mouth."
"Last swigs: Molasses and biscuit flour American Barley wine. Looking forward to cellaring. Subdued hops near dead ringer for SNBF."
"Vintage 2004 pours a bright dark amber with some floating yeast throughout, small creamy off white head that leaves some lacing in my glass. Aromas of sweet fruity plums. Dark cherry, chocolate and caramel flavors. Full bodied with mild carbonation makes for a creamy and soft mouthfeel, alcohol well hidden, finishes sweet."
"Overall, way too much alcohol in the flavor and nose. I've had beers with more alcohol that masked it much better. It was more like drinking a mixed drink than a beer. Too bad I like beer, not mixed drinks. Maybe it will tone down with age."
"I doubt I would have another one of these, but certainly glad I had the opportunity to try. I'll stick to Flying Dog's IPA...it is more my style."
"This was the second time trying this brew, considering i bought i four pack, and the results this time were the same as last; definitely not to my liking. If this brew were to be aged for awhile to let the alcohol calm down and bring the malty characteristics forth, then it might very well be a decent drink. As it stands, i don't think i'll be finishing those other two bottles i have stashed away any time soon."
"Pours with a compact dark tan head sitting on top of clear deep ruby red liquid. Chocolate nose with a subdued yet noticeable fruitiness in the back. The taste offered a smooth, lush mouthfeel with notes of deep maltiness and light smoke and well balanced hoppy bitterness. Finishes smooth and balanced with some complexity, goes down easy. A nice offering from this brewery."
"PS- Awesome label!"
"Quite possibly the best beer from Flying Dog, Horn Dog barleywine offers a deep mahogany body capped by a short head of creamy ivory foam. The head retention is limited, probably due at least in part to its 10.5% abv, and it leaves little lace about the glass. The nose delivers a soft blend of yeasty, berry-like fruitiness and caramelish (even chocolatey) malt. It's soft and lightly creamy in the mouth with a very fine, moderate carbonation and medium-full body. In keeping with the English barleywine style, malt dominates the flavor profile; accented by hop flavors and anchored by bitterness. Its malt is caramelish and subtly chocolatey, and even has a cusp of roastiness to it. Yeasty fruitiness and some leafy, subtly piney, and fruity hops help to round it and give it depth while a firm bitterness grounds it and leads to a dry, lingering finish. What's so nice about this barleywine, however, is that it's not overdone - although the alcohol is a bit high for the style and does become apparent halfway through the bottle. It's quite enjoyable, and very drinkable. Well done!"
"This is a decent barleywine, with waves of malt sweeping away most of the hops presence. Could use a bit more hops balance, but I would buy this one again."
"Too bad we cannot buy it in NC."
"Drinkability - Hell to the No. Mainly because of the taste, partially because of the alcohol level."
"Eh... OK, I guess, for a beer. But subpar for a barlwywine. I can't go into too long a description here, because nothing really impressed me. Yeah, it's a barleywine... and I like barleywine alot, but either the hops or the alcohol are out of control, in my opinion, though. If you're a hophead, then you might enjoy this. Me, I like a balance between my mad malt and mad hops. There's some vinous, fruity malt character, and then the hops kick in, just overwhelming the palate. Or maybe it's that the alcohol is not well-hidden at all. Regardless, drinkability suffers. Mr. Malt needs to stand up for himself here and stop being pushed around by big bad hops. Eh."
"Tastes of rich caramel malt. Fruity plum and spiced raisin. Citrusy hops in the finish and aftertaste. Sticky and rich in the mouth. Not bad. I like my barleywines a bit bolder and a bit more complex. This one is really smooth however and does have a nice fruitiness to mix things up. Not one I would drink over and over but solid."
"I really enjoyed this beer, I haven't really had a barley wine I haven't enjoyed. I believe this is due to the fact that if you take the time and effort to brew a berley wine, you probably know what you are doing. Anyways, this poured an extremely deep, but visibly brown, brow. Smelled of raisins and rich roasted malts. Taste was very malty and vinous, good hop presence. Very drinkable, not bad of a deal (4 for $7.90). I would recommend this beer."
"I am drinking this brew at room temp in a snifter. The bottle opens with a nice hiss. Pours a rich mahogany color with a light beige colored head foaming up and fading quickly to an edge layer. Aroma is ripe pears, plums and raisin. SOme piney hops and huge alcohol profile. Perhaps a whif of bourbon in there. First sip reveals a syrupy textured brew with mild, almost non-existent carbonation. Flavor is hard candy sweet up front with toffee and ripe fruit mixing in. Slightly astringent alcohol bite dominates the finish and predicts the strong warming sensation in my throat and belly. Not very smooth or easy to drink, but a decent overall beer."
"An OK barleywine, it seems the flavors are not mixed especially well and the alcohol is very apparent. I would drink this again but I can think of others that are much better."
"This brew is a dark purple/black colored brew, with a small tan, foam head on top. Big syrupy scent. The taste has a chewy malt base, bitter hop, some alcohol detectable. Got that great barlywine flavor, its just not as well blended or full tasting as the greats. The alcohol is a little too apparent."
"The beer after its release from the 12-ounce brown bottle resides in the glass a murky brown with ruby high lights, the head is generous in size and semi-creamy in texture, the color a winsome light tan and as it slowly dematerializes the resultant lace a thick blanket to conceal the glass. Nose is sweet with malt, hints of fusel alcohol, caramel and a nice crisp clean nose overall. Start is cloyingly sweet, thick with malt and the top medium to full in feel to the palate. Finish has a brisk acidity with the hops pleasing in their spiciness; the aftertaste continues the sweetness with a hint of alcohol bitterness, maybe just a bit too sweet for me."
"Pours a deep dark red with no real head just a half finger of foam that lasts the whole glass. Aroma is malt lots of malt with a dark fruity aroma almost wine like grapes, raisins ect. Taste is big on malt lots of chewy delicious malt, flavored with touch of dark fruits along with a small hop flavor and lightly bitter finish. Mouthfeel is big and full almost a meal. Drinkability is too good could throw back a few of these they are so good and go down so smooth could be dangerous."
"Not the best barley wine I've ever had, and not the worst either. It suffices, but doesn't inspire devotion like some I've sampled."
"a very good beer... of the two barley wines I have had (horn dog and bigfoot) this is better.. (of course my own opinion, probably based somewhat on my immature understanding of the styles and the difference between english and american styles, also I have found my self to appreciate hoppy bears, but to truly love dark, more malty beers) my love maybe cuz of the great tingling bit on the tip of the tounge or the darker, somewhat roasted attributes"
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" beige/light tan head above a somewhat cloudy reddish-copper brew. Head hung around for a reasonable amount of time, and laced ok. Aroma is kind of busy with a malty, somewhat fruity, definitely alcohol-y. Makes things interesting for the nose. Taste is sweetly malty, then fades into a boozy warmth that carries through the mouth and down the gullet. Mouthfeel is extremely smooth for a barleywine, which scares me, and drinkability is excellent, from both a multiple serving and interest-piquing viewpoint. The best Flying Dog I've had, by far. Not sure if that's saying much, but this was a good brew."
"Though a lot of their other beers are average I always have a hard time turning down a barley wine I havent tried. This on pours a deep brown color with reddish highlights and a slight white head that fell to a collar fairly quickly. Smells of fruit sweetness with a bit of alcohol and a touch of hops, fairly pleasant smelling overall. The sweetness starts the taste out here before a hop bitterness and alcohol kicked in for the finish. This is defiantly a thick barley wine with a great mouthfeel. This is easily my favorite beer from the brewery and a good barley wine in its own right."
"It pours a somewhat murky, very dark brown (almost black) with ruby tinges and a thin light tan head. The aroma is yeasty, malty, fruity (cherry), and hoppy (mint and herbal). The very sweet malt is up front in the taste and it has some fruitiness as well. It is a bit harsh from the high ABV. Theer is ample bitterness (herbal, minty, earthy) and then a peppery alcohol punch in the finish. Not a bad beer, but it is a bit harsh for my tastes."
"Not being a fan of their other brews, I give kudos to Flying Dog on this one. It rich, and smoother than most in the style. The balance is well-done and it's spot-on for the style. One of the best Barleywines I've had, believe it or not."
"Much surprised with this offering. Nice deep dark mahogany color. A thin tan head on top fades away to nothing. Sweet aroma, plums and sugar come to mind along with figs. There is a slight hint of a bitterness in the aromahops? The taste is warming and smooth malt start mild bitterness and a sweet finish. Watch that 10.5%, it will sneak up on ya. Other than that, it is easy to drink. This is a very nice offering from the Flying Dog."
"Big fat foamy, light brown colored head left a thick coat of lace. Dark brown beer, almost black colored with a ruby glow. Strong roasted barley aroma, a bit of malty alcohol. Smooth, almost creamy mouthfeel, bubbles float across the tongue. Chocolate malt flavor, finishes with a coffee bitterness. The body is middle of the road, not too thick. Lots of fresh barley in the aroma and flavor."
"It all adds up to a sweet smooth barleywine that goes down well when it's warm. This would be a good after-dessert brew, methinks. Maybe with carrot cake or something. Mmmm cake."
"The pour was very dark chocolate brown with a slight red hue. A very short head that left a wisp of white lace around the pint. The smell is that of very strong alchohol with a hint of malt sweetness. It starts with a light hop kick followed by a quick surge of malt sweetness, then it ends with another hop kick followed by a light alchohol burn. All and all not a bad sipping beer, but I didn't find it refreshing in any way. This would be a great beer to sit with friends and talk about old times."
"A nice and subtle offering from Flying Dog. Not necessarily a beer that will sledge you over the head, but still enjoyable, and one that I would have again."
"12 oz bottle, pours dark almond and cloudy. moderate head, settles into tiny bubble light film, and leaves average lacing. Very malty, with alcohol present. Medium bodied, finish seems abit thin. Hop wallop never really kicks in. What happenend to the hops? This is one reserved BWine, English in style perhaps is a usable excuse."
"Vintage 2003 printed on the bottle. This beer poured out thick, syrupy and dark. An extremely deep and dark amber-brown color with a thin film of a head. Alcohol and sweet fruit malt nose, with the presence of molasses and licorice spice. The taste is strong and syrupy sweet, almost sticky. Dry alcohol presence is right along side. Full of flavor and full, as well, in body. This is a tasty sipper with some guts to it. Not great, but a semi-enjoyable strong ale."
"Dark and sludgy brown; somewhat of a brick-like red edging with a thin tan top of compact cappucchino-like frothyness, fades somewhat feverishly to a thin ring and very minimal spots of lace in a glaring clearish coat. Aroma is of subdued malts rendering some fairly heavy molasses tones mixed with some plum and raisin and bits of smokey-like toffee. Warmth subsides within as some brandy-like alcohol seeps into the nose. Taste has more of the same with a slightly weakened front end but fills up with a dark fruity malty presence across the palate where plum, molasses, and toffee leak into a substraining mix of lightly textured chocolate spices and sugared candy caramel towards the finish. The chocolate tones are light and late with a nice little effective dryness thats favorable and welcomed. Flavors need to be bolder, heavier, richer, what have you, there's not much happening and it's length is tempered. It's feel is comparable with a good medium body and texture and has just enough edge in what could be justified as a hop profile of somekind and its warming of alcohol is sufficiently present within bigger gulps with a slight stinging twinge. A bit tame by my standards, but not bad."
"A nice beer, but maybe not quite big enough on flavour (especially hop bitterness) for the style."
"Appearance: Deep murky brown hue with a nice sized bubbly tan head leaves behind fine specks of even lacing. Aroma: Deep layers of sugary malts just amazing stuff here, leaves not much hops this is a malt monster. Taste: Flavor contains viscous rich tones of sugary mix of pine sap and caramel malts with candi like tasting sugar very big and complex. Mouthfeel: Full bodied so very full great to sip don't try to handle to much big ol' mouthfeel. Drinkability: Beware high abv loads of malts and complexity great tasting barleywine, a bit one sided on the malts for my likings like a bigfoot without all of the hops."
"This is a fairly drinkable beer that could benefit from more aging. The alcohol is too prominent for my liking and diminishes the quality of this beer. I believe a little time in the basement should mellow this into a fine beer."
"Pours a dark hazed brown with mahogony highlights. Aroma of a sweet somewhat fruity maltiness. Hops prevelant along with tons of malt. Taste starts off with a heavy dose a caramel maltiness, then a good dose of bittering hops takes over, drying out the tongue and balancing out the hefty sweetness. Think of a west coast barleywine on the malty side. The makes for a good mix. Good thick mouthfeel. By style not too drinkable, this is a heavy brew."
"The mouthfeel is full, creamy and smooth with a bit of bite from the high alcohol finish. Limited drinkability due to the sweet richness and high ABV."
"Cloudy dark chestnut. Thin, but persistent beige head leaves loose lace. Pronounced butterscotch along with burnt toffee hit the nose upfront, then are ensued by pungent, earthy hop and searing ethanol heat. Mellow cocoa notes and bubblegum esters surface as the beer breathes. Buttery brittle and caramelized flavors are the dominant malt components. Permeating alcohol presence melds with residual sweetness to lend a black licorice and pepper undertone. Mild hop bitterness and singed biscuit surface mid palate and attempt dryness, but are readily overrun by rich, sugary caramel. Understated earthy, woody hop combines with static alcohol lending a burning, ozone like sensation. Full bodied, with a viscous, creamy, luscious mouthfeel. Sour plum esters arise late and add a sublt tart contrast. Finishes with palate enveloping ethanol heat, buttery and oaky bourbon notes and dryish unsweetened baker's chocolate. A unique, raw barleywine with assertive sweetness and marginal hop bitterness. Heavy on the palate and a true belly warmer. Tasty and rough, but not offensive like their K-9 Cruiser."

"A decent brew however not very easy to drink at 10.5%. A good winter warmer."
"2002 vintage bottle, tasted 11/16/03. Poured nice layer of pinprick bubbles, like a nitro pull, that dissolved into a thin layer of bubbles posing as a head. Dark reddish-brown body. Big smell of coffee malts, raisin and plum flavors, very chewy, with a subtle hop balance. Still, none of these makes for a great barleywine compared to the others, but then it's a style in which there's a lot of competition to go ""bigger," innit?"
"Poured a deep, dark tan in color. Just the tiniest of wispy head on the edges of the glass. This ring of lace tries to leave some lace but falls short. Aromas are of alcohol-soaked dark fruit and something else...tough to identify. For some reason, ""murky"" comes to mind. Almost an earthen-""dusty"" scent. It wasn't unpleasant, just a strange combination of aromas. Flavor is rather uninspired. Starts out with a good dose of dark fruits mixed with the medicinal alcohol flavor but began to break down. Almost a gritty...chalky flavor sets in. Not a hoppy bitterness, though. Finished with a semi-sourness that unfortunately lingered on the palate. Mouthfeel was very thin for the style. Low-medium body. Drinkability is decent. Alcohol is present, but not oppressive. A nice beer to drink on this cold winter's night. I'd be curious to see how this ages and see if the flavor comes together."
"pours out a deep and dark scarlet/ruby colour. short lived head and practically no lace. intense vinous, fruited, malten aroma. cherry, plum, raisin and other fruitcake aromas behind a definite alcohol sting. more choco and caramel flavours make themselves apparent...as do the spicy, liquorice alcohol notes again. this seems intensely boozy. i guess it should. it would be my guess that this recipe hasn't changed, and that some cellaring would be advantageous. i have three of the 2001, and and now three of the 2003 laid down. a little goes a long ways! let it warm and sip accordingly."
"The long time it takes to savor one of these lets you taste the difference as it warms from fridge temperature to much warmer. It tastes great in the mid 50's but if you start there it may well be room temperature before you finish. Start cold and take your time."
"A gnarly and complex beer, with some aging I think this will be great, so I've put two in the cellar... oh wait, never mind on the cellaring."
"Drinkability: Not quite and American-style barleywine, but close. I don't think this one will stand extended aging.. maybe just from year to year. Still, pretty good if you're willing to plunk down the $$$. The label art rocks, too."
"So far, I've not found a barleywine that I thoroughly enjoy. But Horn Dog surprised me. Poured a dark amber color with a small but thick head. The aroma was chocolates/coffee, with alcohol hints and some malts. The flavor was surprisingly smooth. Very fruity beginning, but finished off with a grassy/pine feel. Very cool. I have to recommend this barleywine - one of the best I've had to date."
"Drinkability  Way to easy going down for a 10.5% ABV bottle. Be careful with this one."
"Like a glass of Maple sap it eases down the pipes jittin' its woody orange rind action all over your buds. Aromas of dark berries and chocolate cremes and twigs delight the sniffer. Quality Barleywine drinks as easy as most and better than many even with all the junk suspended in the glass."
"I found this a very well-done, enjoyable barley-wine. The head was thick, puffy, and stable for the style. Aroma is dominantly malty...grist-like with a background of hops. Alcohol mingles with the malt smell. I love that! Taste is not as sweet as the aroma would indicate, and has plenty of fruit and woody qualities. Blackberries, oak, plum, etc. Finish is sweet with a hint of hops. Alcohol is present through the entire experience, but isn't dominant, and adds a pleasing roughness to the finish. Moderately creamy mouthfeel, but it falls short of the luxurious meatiness of some barley-wines. Again, very well-done and extremely drinkable."
"Dark reddish color with no head. Only a thin tan color. Aroma of malt. Period. Taste is an old grainy taste. Very astringent, mild sweetness. Not a surprise considering my recent run ins with the rest of the litter. Alcohol is very apparent and distracting. Mouthfeel is a bit thin. Drinkability is poor. I suffered through this one. One of my worst barleywines. Ack."
"I believe this was the 2002 bottling. As always, the Ralph Steadman artwork is cool. Pours a deep reddish brown, moderate haziness, with a thick khaki colored head. Aroma is nice and malty, smooth and rich, with an odd apple, pear, cherry, pineapple mix. Interesting. Flavor is very rich. A touch thinner than other barleywines I've tried. I've had lighter bodies on some. Nice fruity flavors, big malt, copious hopping, and a great smooth carbonation. Almost silky, and i think the six months I've held on to this beer has helped. I wish I bought a whole 4 pack so i could try one every six months or so. Way better than I expected."
" Nicely mellowed after 2 years- flavors married outstandingly well. Hops are decidedly subdued compared to a fresh bottle. Alcohol less apparent and more meshed into the beer. A great example of how a US microbrewery can make an English style BW w/out over-doing the hop rate. A solid barleywine fresh, or aged a bit, very easy to drink for such a big, malty beer.."
"Upon first taste, and being a barleywine fan, I thought it couldn't be that strong because the alcohol was masked so well. But after finishing it, I realized this is one brew to be reckoned with! It goes down very smoothly, with a robust array of chocolate malty notes as well as raisins or dates. Hops are there as well, but not in hop head lover's quantities. It's very complex, and the mouthfeel was quite hearty, but not cloying. I loved the way it warms your palette as it goes down, but without the burn as seen in other high ABV brews. This one is highly recommended for the style, no doubt!"
"very dark indian brown in color, small thick tan head. Malty and caramelized aroma. Alcohol is very noticeable at first, but this was when it was chilly. As it warms, it gets very tasty, very malty, caramelized, and syrupy. A full bodied barleywine...the first barleywine I have tried. So I can't rate it against much. I enjoyed it a lot but probably won't buy it again."
"Pours out a blackish brown amber with a very nice head. The malts come through strong in the taste. This is a very smooth brew. The 10.5% is very well hidden. The hops are a bit weak, but there are enough to distract from the sweet. Try this beer if you see it!"
"You would never know while drinking this that it has an ABV of 10.5%. Dark ruby, almost black color, head disappears, no lace. Tastes kind of like a cross between Salvator and Old Nick's, but not as lively or good as either of those. More malt than hops, but overall, rather undistinguished. Nothing to put you off, but nothing stands out, either."
"Among the top 5 American barleywines, but, frankly, we're a bit spoiled, they are so many top-notch versions. And the best acheivement from this brewery, so far!"
"Pours with a giant tan head. The head quickly dissolves, leaving a dark brown ale with strong aroma of chocolate. Taste is strong on malt, with a little anise in the back, and finishes with a little spice. Alcohol is definately there, slightly warming the gullet on the way down."
"The beer was listed at the pub as ""Horn Dog Overpriced Barleywine"" - maybe I'm just feeling generous, but I'd pay for another pint. Very nice example - just don't look for a lot of hops."
"Dated 2001. Got this at Jungle Jim's in Fairfield, OH. Chestnut colored with a thick beige head and fair carbonation. Malt and alcohol nose. I must have had this at a good temperature because I thought the flavor came through very well. Malt, caramel, chocolate and alcohol played well together. I don't know if I would want to drink a bottle from this year considering how good this one tasted."
"Pours a dark reddish brown with a white head.  Smells complex with raisony kind of malt smell.  Fruity malty intense flavors.  Very solid taste, yet you cannot detect the alcohol, a real good beer to finish the evening."
"Dark brown, tea-like pour, practically no head other than spider web tracks. A little fruit, mostly grape, in the aroma...could be bolder. Decent mouthfeel, nice and syrupy. Flavors of maraschino cherry, apple, and a little nutmeg. The hops are actually respectable but not massive, and give a little gravel to the back. Maybe a little less complex than some Barleywines, it still matches the style well and was much better than my expectations. Even pretty drinkable."
"Pours a dark garnet almost brown with a huge, rocky, creamy tan head that last but somehow doesn't leave any lace.  The aroma has huge caramel malt aromas as well as some chocolate, dark fruits and some slight alcohol notes.  The brew starts off with some intense caramel sweetness that turns into a creamy chocolate flavor for a short time before going into a raisiny/prune flavor.  Their is also some slight fruity tartness in the taste and the brew finishes with lingering sweetness and some slight alcohol that warms you throughout.  The brew is very creamy and has some somewhat chewy qualities to it as well which make it very drinkable and leaves the mouth wanting more after each sip.  I have previously been unimpressed by this brewery but I definitely like this brew quite a bit."
"Brown color, dissipating head, big malty aroma.  Flavor is strong malt with just enough hops to keep it from being cloying.  Finsh is very smooth with some alcohol evident.  Deceptively strong and very smooth.  Not as manly as Bigfoot ( I want more hops!) but this could put you down without you realizing it.  A great effort!"
"This beer poured a dark ruby red color and formed a small light tan head that left little lace.  A small amount of carbonation.  An aroma of malt and caramel.  The taste was of malt, caramel and a little citrusy hops.  The finish was warm of slight alcohol and caramel.  Not a bad barleywine."
"This beer is a murky dark, dark shade of ruby.  A little swirl of a head is gone in a second.  Very nice sweet malt and hops blend on the nose.  There seems to be a little spice as well.  This is a really nice tasting barleywine.  I am surprised as few of the other Flying Dog brews have knocked my socks off (although they have been decent).  The alcohol is only present in a minimal fashion.  There are subdued notes of cherry and dark fruits.  There is a nice bitterness, but not over the top as the Bigfoot is.  There's some nice caramel and vanilla tones.  It's not syrupy at all as some other barleywines are.  I also get some prunes and currants on the buds.  Very nice tasting barleywine."
"Can't resist commenting on the label on this one.  Most of this line is weird, but this one is goofy.  Dog with a gigantic horn growing from the top of its head - reminds me of a low-budget science fiction movie where the monster is a dog or iguana with a fake horn stuck on its head."
"Notes: A must a cellar temp, drink this cold and feel its wrath. Also, make sure the yeast does not make its way into the glass or you will fell sorry that it did. As soon as it warms up the malt flares out the with pounding sweetness that wrestles with the hops and graininess. Not overly impressive but good enough to give it a try if you are into strong beers and barleywines."
"Minimal hopping...very malty and sweet...very intersting sweet taste..warming effect, but doesn't taste of alcohol...sweeter beers don't get downgraded by me so this scores will...if you're looking for a heavily hopped and malty barley wine this is NOT it..I like it a lot but the sweetness could get to you...taste of brown sugar...grapes...smells of alcohol but doesn't taste of it...wouldn't want more than one or two of these but those one or two would be a good experience.."
"This isn't a world-class barleywine, but still quite nice to drink.  Buy a few, and lay some down.  This will be a fun one to watch mature."
