3.94,1.5,3,4,4,4,4,"330 ml bottle into snifter, bottled on 8/24/2011. Pours hazy/cloudy dark ruby red color with minimal head or lacing. Some light carbonation bubbles linger at the surface. Aromas of big raisin, plum, fig, date, apple, caramel, molasses, toast, toffee, brown bread, brown sugar, light leather, herbal, and herbal/toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark fruitiness and dark/bready malt sweetness; with good strength. Taste of big raisin, plum, fig, date, apple, caramel, molasses, toast, toffee, brown sugar, brown bread, light leather, herbal, and herbal/toasted earthiness. Light earthy herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, plum, fig, date, apple, caramel, molasses, toast, toffee, brown sugar, brown bread, herbal, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity and balance of dark fruitiness and rich dark/bready malt flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light carbonation and very full bodied; with very slick and fairly syrupy mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice English barleywine. All around good complexity and balance of dark fruitiness and rich dark/bready malt sweetness; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Aug 21, 2014"

Body has an oily like texture with zero carbonation and loads of alcohol was apparent. This was bottle in 2010 and is supposedly good for another 25 years! I can’t say I was very impressed with this beer as way too much alcohol and sugar was perceptible. There seems to be a trend of zero carbonation and high-gravity beer with no attenuation and I just don’t get it.","Phyl21ca","Oct 07, 2012"

The lack of any carbonation ruins any hope of having a good experience with this beer, perhaps it's just the age of the bottle, and maybe some oxidation setting in, although it really didn't taste like that was the case and many other reviewers, even of fresher bottles have complained about the mouthfeel as well, so I'm not convinced.","kevanb","Aug 24, 2012"

Yellowish beige, medium to small bubbled, froth creates creamy, fairly good retention, crown. Noble hop, spicy, intense caramel malt & candy aromas with hints of cinnamon. Sweet caramel malts, very ripe fruits –peach & apricot-, gentle warming & subtle bitterness at first sip. Buttery, plentiful & voluptuous palate. Raisin & sweet grapefruit in the middle. Full body, low carbonation. Smooth, creamy, slightly earthy finish. Aftertaste carries sugar cane, brown sugar & soft rhum-like hues. Amazing well balanced flavors & aromas. Delightful. Mandatory beer!!! Comment: Last year I enjoyed a 750ml bottle. I remember it so delicious but no notes were taken. Well, looking at labels I´ve realized: 750ml ltd.

Well, look at the ABV and then wonder why it bites like an angry pit bull. Texture is rather like a hard liquor, mainly raw alcohol bite with some sweet and fruity and molasses hints.

At 12 bucks a bottle, over a dollar and oz, won't be something I do again, and frankly I'm ok with that.","bobhits","Aug 06, 2010"

3.8,-2.1,4,4,4.5,2,3,"All in all, an interesting brew. It's a phenomenal sipper, but not a personal favorite of mine. Something needs to be done about that mouthfeel before I give this one another look - just too flat.","Mavajo","Aug 05, 2010"
3.65,-5.9,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"D-big malt bomb, a little sweet but not cloying, the huge flavors and the big body go well together. more carbonation would probably have helped balance and reduce some of the big sugar flavors in this.","cpetrone84","Aug 03, 2010"
4.29,10.6,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"This barleywine is as classic flavored as they come; similar to the well-aged J.W. Lees and Tom Hardy's ales.","BEERchitect","Jul 23, 2010"
3.78,-2.6,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Overall this was a big still barleywine - certainly on the sweet side but after a certain ABV it's almost impossible to make them otherwise. I'd enjoy seeing beers over 12% available in the Rogue nip bottles as 12 oz. is almost always too much. Anyways, it's a tasty beer that's worth a shot.","glid02","Jul 16, 2010"
4.04,4.1,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"This is a sipper - very sweet, like a dessert wine. Not the best body in a barleywine but pretty drinkable, especially for the ABV.","gford217","Mar 21, 2010"

3.78,-2.6,4,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,"Traded from the Netherlands. Pours a rich dark brown colour with a little head, noneby the end of the bottle. Fairly full mouthfeel, supplemented by lots of caramel. This is sweet and apricot fruity. Very sweet, this is one year old of its stated 25 year life, and should be even more interesting after five years. Drinkable and super high alcohol is hidden.","Sammy","Sep 25, 2009"
4,3.1,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"750mL courtesy of RB's own madmitch76. The pour is orange copper with thin off white head. The aroma is really pungent and fruity with apricots and pears to go along with spicy to earthy hops and some mild heat at the end of the draw. The taste is sweet syrupy with malts, pears, skinless ripe red apple wedges and apricot fruitiness. It smoothly moves into notes of spicy and earthy hops. The booze kicks in and helps dry it out at the end to help balance out the load of sweetness going on here.","BigMcLargeHuge","Sep 24, 2009"
3.82,-1.5,3,3.5,4,4,4,"Overall: Not what I expected. The beer is really too sweet for my pellet. It needs a bit more bitterness to balance the taste. The alcohol however, is extremely well hidden, I wish alcohol was this well hidden in my favorite barley wine (the Sam Smith strong golden). The absence of any carbonation and lack of bitterness makes this beer more like a very sweet liquor. Nice for after dinner, but not if one wants a beer.","rvdoorn","Sep 17, 2009"
3.42,-11.9,3,3.5,3.5,4,3,"D: If there wouldn't be the grains, this could be mistaken for an Italian desert wine like malvasia. With some carbonation and some aging to reduce the sugar content this might have been a great barley wine. I'm waiting until I hear about a batch with carbonation then I will surely try and review it again.","PapaEugene","Aug 12, 2009"
4.44,14.4,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"D: A really good beer. Very taste and characterful. It's definitely a sipper, but it's impressive that a beer as sweet as this one is so balanced. The vinous and liqueur-like qualities in this one is superb. But it would have been so nice if there was some carbonation.","ricke","Mar 08, 2009"
3.5,-9.8,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,2.5,"750ml bottle from the May '08 brewing. The cork comes loose silently, and pouring it proves there is indeed very little carbonation, if any. The beer is surprisingly clear, with a bright copper body and some traces of a would-be foam collar. Looks like a liqueur, and the similarities don't stop there. Smells incredibly sweet, with brown sugar and fruit notes. Lots of orange character. Very boozy; taking a big whiff, it burns the nostrils. Caramel, brown sugar, and honey in the taste, again with a good deal of fruit. There is a surprising amount of bitterness there, though it's easily overpowered by the sweet finish. No real alcohol bite, just a very warming finish. Thick feel that is quite syrupy. Normally not the kind of beer that I really go for, but I think the lack of carbonation is really what lets it work. Rather than thinking about this as a beer, it comes off as being much more akin to a typical dessert liqueur. Definitely a sipper, and not something I want to have more than a 6oz serving of, but then again, one can just recork the bottle and not have to worry about losing carbonation. Really interesting for what it is.","philipquarles","Dec 18, 2008"
3.97,2.3,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Sampled on tap at the Pre-ZBF festival at Alivnne. The beer poured a cloudy orange body with an off white head that ran away rather quickly. The nose had yeast notes, some citrus character and a bit of alcohol as well. The taste was pretty intense with some alcohol notes, fruit character, orange and a nice hop character and spice as well. Overall a full bodied beer that improved as it warms and the nose and body open up.","ggaughan","Nov 11, 2008"
4.42,13.9,4,4.5,4.5,5,4,"I had 7 bottles of the stuff. 6 of them from a batch in March and 1 from June. The brewer already mentioned that he was more satisfied with the second batch and oh my god! what a great evening filling beer this is. The first batch was great, but it looked horrible and imo it was also too much on the sweet side. The second batch however is a real improvement on those faults. The beer is still very sweet but in a good way because of the strong bitterness underneath and the filling thickness. It's a dessertbeer for sure. After a good heavy meal you should open up a bottle and when done finish it off with a glass of Lagavulin to make the evening perfect! I'm glad I have 5 bottles left. Let's see how they develop over the next 5 years or so.","johnnybravo","Beers"
4.28,10.3,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Bottle 175 of 477 from 6/17/08 bottling. Neat presentation, comes in a wood crate marked 'danger'. After pulling out a prybar/nail puller, I'm ready to begin. Beer pours a very hazy medium copper, plenty of evidence of bottle conditioning. No head to speak of, a few traces of whitish bubbles cling around the edge of the glass, but it appears fairly still. Aroma is a very nice blend of orange and sweet honey, much like a dessert or after dinner drink, maybe a liqueur. Also some notes of strawberry, sweet sugary caramel, coconut, a bit of bready yeastiness and a burning at the nostrils indicating a good sized alcohol presence. Taste follows the aroma with oranges and honey dominating, a toasty yeastiness rides over the tongue behind these flavors. Sweet sugary caramel blends with a bite of alcohol in the finish. Mouthfeel is on the thick side due to the nearly non-existant carbonation, slightly syrupy, but not too heavy, at least in moderate quantities. Bite of alcohol towards the finish leads into a very warming finish, perfect for a cold night. A nice treat from De Molen, I felt the lack of carbonation was both pleasing in that it allowed some strong sweet liqueur like flavors to come thru, but also allows the sugariness to come thru, possibly limiting how much one can enjoy in a sitting. A delicious sipper imo, the low/no carbonation and sweetness make for a fine night cap, glad to have one to lay down for a few years and see what develops.","hoppymeal","0"
