This is a really nice malty barleywine that essentially acts as a vessel for the brandy. It looks a little thin and I'd say that the mouthfeel is true to that for such a big boozy barleywine. It almost made it a bit easier to drink though and added a slickness. Very tasty dessert beer.","PHBoiler","Jun 29, 2014"

The nose is strong with caramel and raisin coming first.The apple brandy influence brings on heavy green apple notes which support the caramelized malt bill. Taste starts with some brown sugar and caramel notes followed by more green apple. A bit of caramel apple notes come out and everything is surprisingly smooth and well balanced. A bit of booze at the back. Mouthfeel is thick and mildly carbonated. Overall, a delicious barleywine that is reminiscent of king Henry and bcbbw. Very good!","homebrew311","Feb 16, 2014"

The nose on this one was as good as it gets, and that translated into an absolutely fantastic taste profile as well. This is one of the best BA barelywines out there. Again Cigar City shows me that we were just meant to be. Well worth checking out if you get the chance. This is one I'd love to drink again at some point. Cheers again for the brews urwithdave.

It's full bodied, rich and creamy. Drinks quite well despite the ABV, which adds character, rather than making It daunting. Quite a nice drinking Barleywine.","EgadBananas","Jun 07, 2013"

It's not quite as smooth or complex as KH and KH beats it in almost every category except aroma. I felt like Leon hid the booze a little bit better in the nose.

I think the nose is amazing on this beer and it definitely got better as it warmed up. A little hotter and a little sweeter than MoaS, I would love to have this one again and think aging it a few months would probably lead to it being even better.

4.97,11.7,4.5,5,5,5,5,"O-Forget the bourbon BA barleywines, the Apple Brandy barrel hits the spot on this style. I hope CCB does another AB BA barleywine, I would drink this on a daily basis if I had more of it. CCB crushed it on this one.","BAstoutsNsours","Nov 03, 2012"
3.9,-12.4,4,4,4,3,4,"Pours a cloudy dark amber capped by a thin head that quickly recedes to a collar. Apple brandy isn't terribly overt on the nose compared to AB Hunahpu's. Other reviews mention it being front and center, so perhaps there's bottle variation. More dominant is dark fruit, burnt sugar and oak. There's plenty of boozy barrel, but it's not distinctly apple brandy. The palate is similar, with big caramel and burnt sugar flavors, boozy barrel, oak and dark fruit. It feels a tad thin to me, especially compared to the Hunahpu's variations we drank next to this. A solid beer, but nothing terribly special.","largadeer","Beers"

Cigar City is cranking out solid barleywnes. My only complaint about this beer was the bigger brandy note which seemed to distract me from the base beer.","barleywinefiend","Oct 29, 2012"
4.47,0.4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"D - Awesome stuff and might be even better than the cognac version. I'd love to get my hands on another bottle of this so that I could enjoy it at a more leisurely pace. Cigar City is on quite the hot streak these days. I think abandoning their sour program has really allowed them to concentrate on what they do best.","MasterSki","Oct 27, 2012"

4.62,3.8,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Poured a Dark brown, almost black with no light shining through at all. Slight foamy tan head, that dissipated to a frothy ring around the edge of the glass while sipping. Smells of brown sugar, toffee and the brandy comes through. Taste is much of the same, but with an amazing warmth in my chest after just my first sip. Burnt sugar, toffee, and dark fruit really broke through after it warmed. This was a Great English Style Barleywine. Non of that sticky resinous Hop feel, like some if its American BarleyWine Brethren.","beergod1","Oct 23, 2012"

I'm already looking forward to the next bottle, as I was able to luck into a couple of bottles. This is a must-try from CCB and as good as the Cognac version.","Sean9689","Oct 08, 2012"
