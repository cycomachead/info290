review_text
"Almost tart, perfectly mellow with a back-end of alcohol. When I'm not skiing the Alps, I always try to let it warm. This reminded me of a candied apple; this beer was incredibly good, especially with time. One day, this will come in a bomber for $50 and we will all be pissed."

"This is mighty tasty as it warms up. I really enjoyed it and appreciated that I could slowly sip it like a harder liquor, savoring it for over an hour."

"O - Great beer. Glad some of my BA friends.got me to start trying more Barleywines and other strong\old ales. Prost!"
""

""
"Overall- Almost a great beer. I love the way the Calvados pervades every aspect of this beer but still allows the subtle complexity of the other notes to come through. Definitely worth a try and something I would buy again."

"O - This beer comes together excellently and I consider it greater than the sum of its parts. Lovely, sweet and smooth."

"9.3oz bottle. Pours a brownish burnt caramel with a small slowly fading white head with some lacing. Aroma of sweet caramel malt, yeast, light citrus notes up front that give way to a sweet dark fruit and figs and a sweet alcohol essence. Taste is sweet caramel malt, yeast, dark fruit, figs, brown sugar with some barrel aged woody and calvados notes and mild bitterness. A medium bodied. smooth and slightly creamy mouth feel on the palate with light carbonation. Finished with a sweet caramel malt, dark fruits, figs, brown sugar, ending has a lingering sweet caramel, figs and aged woody flavor. This is not an overly sweet and cloying drink.Overall a fairly smooth, flavorful, palatable and enjoyable after dinner drink."

"o: Easily my favorite J.W. Lees."
""
" The flavor of brandy is apparent right away with some woody tannic flavors and light berry-like tangy fruit with a mix of spice and oak adding to the light caramel and malt with slight vanilla earthy character. The vinous flavor is there with subtle alcohol making for a splendid barleywine. Overall I had a hard time keeping myself from downing this it is so flavorful, however it evolves as it warms and opens up to an even more complex strong ale over the course of tasting when it nears cellar temps-worth every cent a truly remarkable beer."

"Bottled in 2004. Nine year old bottle here. Drinking this thanks to the owners of Craft Pride Beer Bar. Brownish-yellow lacing, murky brown color. Aroma of caramel, musty. Tastes like an amber extract that's been watered down a bit. Very smooth, easy drinking. Can't detect any booze. This beer has definitely held up in age"
"Overall: tasty, if lacking in some other departments. This beer doesn't hold a candle to the 2008 port cask version, however."

"275 ml bottle into tulip glass, 2007 vintage. Pours very cloudy orange copper color with a small off white head with poor retention, that reduces to a thin lace ring. Minimal lacing on the glass. Aromas of big raisin, apple, fig, prune, caramel, toast, toffee, molasses, light pepper, brown bread, brandy, vanilla, oak, and toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt, cask, and fruity notes; with good strength. Taste of big raisin, apple, fig, caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, brandy, brown bread, vanilla, oak, light pepper, and toasted earthiness. Lingering notes of raisin, apple, fig, caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, brandy, oak, vanilla, light pepper, brown bread, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic balance and complexity of malt, cask, and fruity flavors; with zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Minimal carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very slick, creamy, and lightly syrupy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a really excellent English barelywine style. Great balance and complexity of malt and cask flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering."

"O: This is a nice dessert beer and requires slow sipping but is quite enjoyable and the Calvados flavors really come through."
""
"Overall: This is a very interesting beer, and it is really delicious right now. Caramel apple, brandy, some nice spices and plenty of sweet fruit. I have to guess that the time in the bottle has done great things with this because it is drinking really well right now. This is a really good ""desert"" type drink."
"Bottle that says ""Brewed in 2006."" Pours brownish reddish toffee color with no head and lots of sediment floating around. Aroma of biscuits, toffee, caramel, vanilla, licorice, some chocolate. Nice. Flavor is sweet up front like whoah, then fades into an intense praline nuttiness and vanilla cream. The nutty flavor lingers a good while and is very pleasant--probably the best part of this beer. The up front super cloying maple sweet makes it tough to drink at start, but otherwise a nicely layered bunch of flavors. Brown sugar, figs, and chocolate begin to show. Calvados and butterscotch come out as it warms. Thick and viscous. Heavy, decadent dessert beer for sure. Maybe a bit much, but definitely had the depth of flavor. The palate improves as I go, and overall one to try for barleywine lovers. One of the most complex flavor profiles I have come across since BB4D."

"overall: This is a special occasion beer given the price, but wow does this impress. So smooth, it's not often you can find beer aged for several years at my local stores. The calvados casks really come through on this one and create a truly flavorful, balanced, amazingly smooth beer. Will buy again, if you like any sort of oak, bourbon, or other barrel aged beer, you will absolutely love this."

"O: worth the buy, but not as stunning as I'd hoped - very sweet, very slick, apple predominant on the nose an on the palate - invisible alcohol content"
""
"O - I would enjoy it more if it were called something else, resembles the cask it was aged in ather than a barley. However, in it's favor, it's insanely complex."
""
""
""
"It's flat despite my most aggressive pour ever. Smells and tastes pretty woody and sort of reminiscent of port. It tastes malty and is fine but is missing something, is missing life or soul or body or complexity. The residual warmth at the end is welcome but doesn't save it."

""
""
"O: Classy stuff, not something you'd drink in the pub."
""
""
""
"Overall: I wish I could have had this bottle a year or two ago before the oxidization became noticeable in the nose; that said, it is still a fantastic beer and one I hope to have again!"
""
""
""
"Overall it's quite an experience and totally worth the price of admission. Even though it's not like most barleywine it's still quite tasty. Worth picking up for 12 bucks though (retail)? Hell no"
"[O] A fantastic barleywine that goes from 'very good' at cellar temp to 'unbelievable' at room temperature."
""
""
""
"Overall: A really interesting beer. The Calvados flavor almost makes it feel like some Brett is present thanks to the rotten apple notes it imparts. Glad I tried it but definitely won't pay that much for a tiny bottle again."
"Incredibly sweet and incredibly smooth. Extremely complex and unique. Absolutely no hint of the 11.5% abv. I will certainly be trying some other barrels."
""
""
"O- like their regular version better, but this is still a very good Barleywine. The Worcestershire sauce taste throws this whole beer off for me."
""
""

"On tap at Trappeze. Poured into a Southern Tier tulip. White head, oily slick lacing. Bright , golden/coppery body. Aroma is over ripe mango, vanilla and alcohol. Taste is suprisingly not hot, nice malt sweetness, mango, Swedish fish, and vanilla in the background. Very smooth to drink for the abv, no doubt the calvados has completely muted the alcohol from the taste completely. Awesome."
""
"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. 2008 vintage. Pours a dark, murky caramel amber with a half finger off-white head with decent retention and light lacing. A somewhat too aggressive pour left dark yeast chunks at the bottom of the glass. Inviting aroma of sweet caramel malt, toffee and alcohol. Flavor is caramel, intense apple juice, dark dried fruit, hint of vanilla. Quite sweet, but the intensity of flavor makes this very drinkable. Medium to heavy bodied, just short of syrupy. Delicious apple flavors in this classic English barleywine. Too drinkable for its 11% ABV. I will have to age a few of these."
"O - This was really good. I preferred this one to an '08 bottle that was not aged in any barrels."
"Overall - An improvement over the base. Anything that distracts from the sugar is a welcome. Maybe it's the age that makes it seem less sweet. I'm not sure."
"Note: 2011 vintage"
""
""
""
""
"O: A pretty insane English style barleywine. The brandy helps cut the syrup but at the same time I feel like it lost a lot of complexity of the normal non-barrel aged version."
"O: Not very pleasant to drink. Horrible appearance and mouthfeel and tastes mostly like brandy. Might as well buy a bottle of Calvados."
""
""
""
"Really nice beer."
""
""
""
"D - Very drinkable. The Calvados adds some nice fruity sweetness on top of the base beer and the overall beer is nice and bold but stays fairly balanced."

"An excellent BW from JW Lee's, which is to be expected. Not sure it's such a great idea to feature it during the summer in Baltimore (they had three different versions in fact, and they did not seem to be moving), but regardless, this is another very good BW from this excellent brewery."
"O: I don't know what I was expecting with this beer but the sweetness most definitately took me by surprise. This was rather easy for me to get through the entire bottle even though it is so sweet like candy."
""
""
"Overall: The beer is just too sweet to me even for an English barleywine."
""
"o-my new favorite with any vintage. I have 2000 to 2009 now and all are stellar!!"
"O- Celebrating my 300th review with a doozy. A top-notch barleywine."
"Overall a very great execution but not a beer for me."
""
""
""
"Overall, a very good beer, but one can certainly argue that it is more barrel than beer. The calvados aging has a dramatic impact and threatens to overpower the base beer. Personally, I think the result is very nice, but could understand somebody being dissatisfied with the result. I found that it got less enjoyable as I went on - the sweetness is a bit much, even the smaller bottle was a bit hard to finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"One of the better variants of this brew, and age does this one well."
""
""
"O: Amazing beer. Tomorrow I will be going back to buy the other 6 bottles. This is not a everyday drinking beer, or one to have with a meal. This is a beer where you put some rhythmic mood music on, turn down the lights, sip and savor. Enjoy every nounce of the beer."
""
"This is very good but 2008 was better, seems like 3 to 4 years is perfect....but that is judging from only two data points so far. I still have more setting and waiting."
""

""

"(D)- Thus far, I have far preferred the port cask version over the rest, but this might be better, if not a very close second for me in the JW Lees barrel variations."
"Pours a hazy mahogany with a thin white head that settles to a slight haze and ring. Lovely aromas of sweet toffee, malt, caramel, and apple brandy. I happen to love a good calvados, so this is hitting me just right. Taste is incredibly smooth and sweet (definitely sweeter then the ""regular"" version), with rich flavors of apple, caramel, toffee, and toasted malt. Bottle has aged well, getting just the slightest touch of oxidation. Mouthfeel is sticky and sweet, quite smooth, with a medium-full body and low carbonation. Overall a very nice treatment of J.W. Lees, I'm digging it a bit more then the Sherry version we had alongside it."
"Poured from a 9.3 oz bottle into a pint glass. It pours a yeasty apricot color with no head and no lacing with yeast chunks in the bottom. It smells of a weird mixture of baby aspirin, apple juice and sherry. The taste is surprising. It's syrupy sweet with a soft smokey oak flavor with a definite sherry backnote. Aftertaste is like smoked cotton candy. The mouthfeel is rich and fizzy with slight carbonation. Alcohol is present but completely befuddling and un-noticeable (therefore dangerous). It's the weirdest barleywine and one of the strangest beers i've ever tried. I think I like it, I think. I'm not sure. I'd highly recommend it to anyone that likes really odd flavored beers."
"Notes: 3 down, 1 to go. These JWL Cask Aged Barleywines are not working for me."
"O: This is not a horrible barrel-aged ale, but it isn't my favorite either. In fact, this may be my least favorite version of J.W. Lees Harvest Ale. It's just too sweet and too syrupy for my taste."
""
"Overall this is an excellent barley wine that is perfect for just sipping on."
""
"woah. little oak cask. 2009 batch. pours a reddish amber with no head. nose is way more apple than i expected. the beer seems to have become one with the calvados. lots of caramel apple, and slightly oxidized in a good way. it's like there's a bit of an apple jacks-out-of-the-box note. it's also heavily alcoholic, but not offensively so, or solventy, just definitely boozy. hints of hops, earth, jam and other fruits as well. taste is a full bodied, slick, well-balanced blast of all of the above with an apple jacks back end and a cleansing heat. the apple fits very well here, and doesn't even come close to translating as an off character. a monster beer."
""
""
""
"Chewy and quite similar to the standard. Barrel aging seems to impart little to this beer from what I've seen, which is already chewy and very sweet with caramel and faint. Not sure what Calvados is like anyway, but this remains as tasty as the original."
""
""
"Overall: The body of the beer is medium with a medium finish. This is exactly opposite of what I thought that this beer would be. From a stand point of a BA, this beer lacks so much finesse and carbonation that is makes it worthless to drink. Not a very good showing."
""
"O- Time has been good to this one. Still drinking nicely at six years old, but I wouldn’t let it go more than another year or two."
""
"Good, sugary, old. J.W. Lees is a sweet drink to begin with, and I think the aging in a fruity brandy cask might compound the sugars too much."
""
""
""
""
"O: I had a 6oz pour, which usually is not enough for me, but it was perfect. The beer was so thick, rich and flavorful that I sipped it the whole way, never wanting to take more than a taste, but enjoying every one."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This beer was awesome I wish I bought more than just one bottle of this and then didn't share it with a friend as well the taste is very good and very easy to drink if your able to find this grab it up"
"I imagine this is a wonderful beer within 1-2 years."
"This is the 2006 version of this beer. Even with a very vigorous pour, there is no head on this beer at all. It is a nice mahogany color and is mildly cloudy with a few floaties I could have done without. The aroma has a lot of honey in it and some apple and some sweet caramel. The flavor is nicer, a bit syrupy without the carbonation, but there is a nice floral blend of apple and some wood and malt in the background. The alcohol is very well hidden and it is very smooth. Definitely a sipper because of the sweetness and body. I don't know if the sweetness comes from the base beer or the calvados, either way it is close to being too much. Very heavy beer that is pretty much still. I do not expect a high level of carbonation in a beer like this, but some might have been nice to cut some of the sweetness. An interesting pairing between a barleywine and apple brandy that I think could have gone better."
"slightly syrupy, low carbonation, its pretty easy to drink but should remain a sipper."
"This would be a great beer to be paired with a desert after an awesome meal."
"This was the first one of the four that I tried. This brew poured out as a thick looking amberish orange color. The head was only visible for a minute or so. The smell of the beer is full of fresh wooden aromas, sweet malts and booze. The taste of the beer is a little earthy, with plenty of wooden sweetness. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. Overall this brew is very big despite the smaller bottle. These could be sold at 8.5oz and they'd be plenty big. Worth trying for sure. Very nice stuff."
"O: If this wasn't so hard to find, and so expensive, I'd drink it all the time!"
"mouthfeel - much more cloying than the sherry cask but a little less than the regular (depending on year). not my favorite of jw's, but also really enjoyable and im sure ill have it again"
"Price = $11.99 at Whole Foods NYC"

"2006 vintage. This beer pours a syrupy dark maple brown in color with no head at all and seemingly little carbonation. A good amount of sediment slipped into my snifter and resembles clumps of cinnamon floating throughout my glass. It is very aromatic and gives of aromas of apples, caramel, oak, vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg, and and maple syrup. The nose is phenomenal and heavy on the caramelized apples. The flavors given are of sweet apples, cinnamon sticks, oak, tree bark, vanilla, and caramel. It is very, very sweet and also quite syrupy. It drinks syrupy and medium in body and has almost lost all of its carbonation. Overall this beer is a sipper or to be shared and could be defined as a dessert beer at this stage in its life. It's a fine drinker and I prefer this to the Sherry Cask version. I'm glad I have another bottle to open again in another couple years. It's a good English Barleywine."
"Overall this was not nearly as wonderful as I had imagined. After my brief love affair with De Regenborg at Monk's Cafe I assumed calvados could only improve the right beer. In this case, I am wishing I had opted for the whiskey, scotch, or port barrel version of this beer."
"Lately anything Calvados related intrigues me. This version of JW Lees pours a really pretty rose color, with a quick to fade white head. The nose is very sweet, with lots of apples, alcohol, honeydew and peach nectar. The flavor follows the same example as far as sweetness, almost to the point of being cloying. While this is a boozy beer, the alcohol doesn't necessarily hinder the experience overall. Mouthfeel is a highlight here in that it is very smooth, and not too heavy. This is certainly a sipper, but a light one. While the ten dollar price tag is on the steep side for a bottle of its size, I recommend this beer. I paired some bitter Chimay cheese with it, which helped to cut down on the sweetness. I imagine the salty nature of Stilton would pair nicely as well."
"Follow up to the J.W. Lees Harvest 2000 vintage bottle. Poured from 2008 vintage bottle into a snifter glass. Pours a mostly clear medium amber color with a small off-white head. Aroma is sweet caramel malt, calvados, sherry, and spice. Flavor is very sweet with caramel and toffee malt notes, oak, spice, calvados, and sherry-like oxidative notes. Slick on the mouthfeel with medium body and soft carbonation. Overall, I preferred this over the Harvest 2000 vintage I had previously. A definite sipper."
"This is a full bodied brew with an acceptably very low level of carbonation. Clingy sweetness sticks to your tongue with this and mixes with lots of oxidative quality. It's a well made old ale/English barleywine with good balance and enjoyable for 11%. I've been on an apple brandy barrel aged beer kick lately and really enjoy the normal harvest offering but this fell a little short for me. I think my expectations were a bit too high considering how much I like the base beer."
"Big icewine sweetness with a major apple component. Alcohol plays a main role, but smooth enough to make it a delectable sipper. Burnt edges like a flaming campfire marshmallow, and the whole sherry/fungus/wood complexities are ridiculous. The alcohol flavors even seem to have various levels of flavor...crazy beer. Definitely malt driven with caramel, simple syrup and toast omnipresent. Nice beer, very fun to drink."
"Drink- This was a very good barleywine. It was balanced, and creamy and boozy yet at the same time, tame and delicate. I cant wait to have again and try the other variations."
"Overall: I have always enjoyed these barrel agings in this one is tied with the Sherry IMO....cheers"
"Finally decided to pull a 2005 vintage from the cellar, and apparently I had waited too long. Good cap seal, but almost no carbonation. A substantial bit of brown sediment decanted even with a careful pour. Very sweet, with caramel and red delicious apple notes. Once the initial sweetness passed, there really seemed nothing of note backing it up, other than a touch of alcohol harshness. Perhaps a more fresh sample would be a better representation, but I can only judge the merit of the beer by what is in my glass at the moment."
"Highly recommended."
"On gravity cask at the Ginger Man. As expected it came out a hazy red without a head or carbonation. There was a big caramel apple pie aroma with slight hints of oxidation (not detrimental). The calvados imparts an earthy fruit charcter that blends nicely with the rich caramel malt and hint of peppery hops. My only complaint was that the mouthfeel was a liitle grainy at the end, like there were bits if trub or something from the bottom of the cask."
" This simply glides over the tongue and coats your taste buds in a creamy fashion. The mouthfeel is exceptional. An unexpectedly dry finish. Certainly take your time with this brew and enjoy each sip. Very drinkable and the 11.5abv is certainly unnoticeable in any harsh or derogatory manner. The warmer sensation as you drink is welcoming on such a cold, snowy night. I am not a brandy drinker but I may need to start after this wonder experience!"
"The barrel adds some weird tequila flavours... sweet almost wine like characteristics as well. Unusual, to say the least"
"Different and worth a try"
"d - I found the 3 normal vintages very sweet and hard to drink a lot of, but the apple brandy barrels definitely smoothed this one out and made it easier to drink. Would have again but might have to split a bottle with someone."
"D - Given the abv I couldn't have alot of these. It's a delicious, warming beer though and worth a drink. I'd never turn one down."
"D- this 08 bottle is very mellow and the time it spent it the cask has done this brew very good. Not nearly as hot as I had expected and quite the treat on this xmas morn."
"Yeah, a very heavy beer, thick and rich like Cottee's topping. A bit too much to have one whole bottle, methinks."
"I would highly recommend this to a friend. I thought it was delicious brew."
"An incredibly flavoursome beverage that I feel privileged to have tried."
"Poured into a snifter. The body is a fairly-bright, yet still murky, orangish color with a thin light head that persists for a bit of time before fading. The nose brings a good dose of booze and the brandy comes through quite well. There is a bit of caramel and toffee plus some light fruits. The taste is just a bit boozy and also has a tiny bit of astringency. Feel is a bit boozy with a nice body. Overall, not nearly as good as the original."
"Definitely not a weak brew. You can really get the flavors of the calvados cask. There is also an earthy flavor that reminds me slightly of dirt."
"D: Quite a treat, but an evening-ending sipper for certain. A fine one to try, not really an 'occasion' beer unless that occasion is the end of a weekend spent camping and tasting fresh-hopped beers, leading into another work week. Woo hoo!"
"Still a wonderful sipper and just right for that. i will say this has a touch less alcohol that the normal version but I'm not sure that in this case it really matters."
"Very enjoyable, as JW Lees beers tend to be."
"Drinkability: More like a liqueur than a beer, this is an interesting beer but the lack of carbonation reduces it to a sipper that is hard to finish (As the other beers in this series have been much more rewarding, I will need to re-visit this one with a bottle procured from another source.)"
"Poured a dark gold colour with orange highlights and no head. The nose was full of apples and vanilla coupled with hops. I felt a little let down by the finish of the beer as it was a little sweet and the apple notes kinda clashed with the hops. I would put this one down for a good 5 years to see what develops as it seems unbalanced right now"
"Not something you could drink lots of, but a great experience"
"Overall, one of the sweetest beers I've ever had, which would probably limit me to sipping 1-2 glasses. Still a very tasty beer with plenty of depth that is worth having anytime the opportunity presents."
"Serving Type: Other Vessel Type: Tulip Price:$15.00"
"Pours a mud puddle brown color with some honey highlights, little to no head. The aroma is sweet and bready. Big toffee aromas with heavy prune and light black pepper. Wow, the taste is quite different than the aroma. Big sweetness but more from the apple brandy aging. Nice sweet apple flavors, candied cherries with some brown sugar, vinous, some prunes and honey. There is a woodsy bitterness that keeps the brew in check. This is definitely a sipper. The feel borders on syrupy, just not quite. There is the slightest of tingly caronbation. Definitely sweet on the palate but the 9.3oz bottle should stay not cloying. A very tasty brew. Honestly very good for the style but I am just not that big of a fan. Feel free to raise a letter grade for style."
"Flavor is similar to the other JW Lee Harvest beers. Full bodied, very sweet, slightly boozy and warm. Very smooth and creamy mouthfeel and malty. Carbonation is mild, but just enough to not hurt the overall experience. The sweet flavors are full of candy and over-ripe fruit...raisins, dates, etc. Overall, another solid beer in JW Lees line up of BA Harvest series."
"An interesting English BW. I liked it better than the regular just slightly."
"Notes: I'm not sure how the Calvados comes across, it has been a long while since I had any so I need to revisit it. But it is a rather nice touch to the Harvest Ale. Overtly sweet and boozy but a pleasing sipper."
"Full-bodied, very viscous. This is about as complex a beer as I've encountered before. Extremely tasty, the flavors are noticeably separate but still seemingly blended well. Definitely a sipper, but I will be on the lookout to buy more."
"Overall, this is a great addition to the already excellent Harvest Ale. Lots of apple notes. I'd love to find some older vintages of this or a few more '07's to lay down for another 5-15 years."
"9.3 fl. oz. bottle served at 50 degrees in my North Coast snifter. Brewed in 2005 indicated on the label. Poured a slightly hazy, dark caramel with clusters of tiny bubbles adhering to the glass. No head to speak of. Nose reveals boozy apple liqueur, sweet, malty, raisins, figs and maple syrup. Taste consistent with nose; however, apple quality is a bit masked by the syrup and figs. This is truly sweet and decadent. It's like drinking liquid fig newtons and maple syrup. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, fairly still and a bit viscous. Wow, this is an amazing sipper, perhaps better served a little cooler so it could be allowed to warm, but a truly wonderful and warming experience. Can't wait to try more from J.W. Lees."
"D- D is for dangerous in this instance. I want more, NOW. And I want some cheese to go with it. This is heaven in a bottle. Absolutely in love with this beer. Big time winner."
"Taste follows nose. A quick hit of alcohol, then a nice caramel, cooking apple mush, and vanilla, then not much of anything. It is very smooth and the alcohol is hidden quite nicely. Yet, it's just a bit odd to me. If they hadn't used Calvados barrels, I think this beer would be average at best."
"D: If one can not tell already, I loved this beer. Everything came together on this one. Wish I had more to age, but I don't think I'd be able to keep my hands off them. Grab a wedge of Stilton and go to heaven."
"D: Undeniably good and unique, but for me, the barrel aging is a bit too much in front of the flavor of a barleywine that is really good by itself."
"Just had a bottle of the 2007 vintage and its definitely holding up well.  Although there's little to no carbonation it needs to be poured carefully as there is a lot of sediment so don't expect anything resembling a head on this beer."
"Overall I have to be honest and say I didn't know what Calvados was and couldn't tell 100% from the beer however now it makes perfect sense. The third one I've had (besides Laguvalin and Port) and my least favorite, but even so it's still a good beer and worth a shot."
"D: For a bw at 11.5% this thing is dangerously smooth but the heaviness and booze make this a sipper. Delicious!"
"While I'm not the biggest fan of hyper-hopped Barley wines, I thought this one could have used a little more dimension to its flavor as it was overmuch sweet."
"D - Dangerously drinkable for a brew of its potency. Drink with care and appreciation."
"not as stellar as the 2003 vintage, but great nonetheless."
"D: This tasted fantastic even relatively young (as compared to the regular 2006, which I found cloying and sweet). The Calvados cask aging does wonders for this one. I'd love to see how it ages with an older vintage."
"M/D: Full bodied, carbonation is low, alcohol character is minimal but there. Drinkability is fine, a big beer that I can enjoy a few of. Very good beer from top to bottom."
"Poured into a chalice a very nice cloudy light brown color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy off-white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, sweet, with some nice oaky notes. The taste is sweet, malty, with some oak notes. Medium body. Very drinkable, this is one fine brew, highly recommended."
"D: As I said before, this is a sipping beer. Finishing a full bottle is a slow experience to be savored. All in all, a great barleywine."
"M&D - amazingly smooth, like liquid velvet, no harshness, the high ABV is hidden well, its not overly/sickly sweet, just in all ways absolutely amazing"
"Overall a very solid beer and one of the best representations od the style I have had. I will be picking this up whenever I run into it for sure."
"Drinkability- The best of the bunch I have had so far. Overall the smoothest and best flavors."
"J.W. Lee's Harvest Ale (Calvados Cask) is the third member of this barrel-aged series that I've reviewed, and is the third gobsmacker of an English barleywine. Despite the expense, multiple bottles are purchased whenever I see them. They're incredibly good and they hold up ridiculously well. Highly recommended."
"Taste: Very sweet. Brown sugar and apples are present. Little bit of alcohol bite on the finish. Too much apple and not enough barleywine in my opinion."
"Pours orange-gold with virtually no head. Nose is richly sweet with apricots, apple, and honeydew. Palate is syrupy in texture, somewhat cider-like but thicker, with a very warm alcoholic cough medicine like finish. Interesting experimental ale, not sure if it is worth seeking to try, however."
"A fantastic dessert beer, which is what I'm using it as after a delicious meal. While one can gripe about it's small size versus it's price, I think a larger bottle of this beer might be too much of a good thing. I only wish I had an older bottle to compare it to, as I'm curious how more time would treat it."
"M: Thick, sticky, sweet, with light carbonation."
"2004 vintage. Pours oily copper with no head, only a ring of sparse bubbles. No lacing. Perfume and alcoholic aroma, very floral with a heap of honey. Lots of oak and berries, not as vinuous as expected. Super-sweet taste. Sugary and fruity; white grapes, raisins, plums, and boysenberries. A fair amount of dark rum flavor to go with the oak. Didn't really get the spice others were finding. Long finish. Denser mouthfeel with the minimal carbonation, kind of sticky towards the end. Drank more like a dessert wine/appertif than a beer."
"drinkability is ok. i feel like i'm drinking pure honey or something barely diluted with beer. there's just so much sweetness here that it doesn't even feel like it's had 4-ish years to mellow out. the aroma is really nice but the taste is just like being hit over the head with sticky sweet caramel and fruit - too much for my taste."
"Slightly clouded reddish amber, nice red hue, medium, thick light tan head form, drops a ton of lace spots on the glass, and settles to a thick ring and light layer, looks nice. Smell is sweet, lots of toffee and molasses, oak, dark fruits, raisins, rum, alcohol, figs, very rich, apples, Calvados comes through a bit soft. Taste is similar, sweet toffee and brown sugar, very malty, lots of sweetness, light bit of oak, some Calvados, but mostly a fruity sweetness, some oak, rum and raisins, not bad, alcohol is very well hidden. Mouthfeel is full bodied, almost syrupy with low carbonation, smooth and drinkable if on the sweet side. Sugary, wouldn't be able to drink a lot of but its a nice sipper, thanks Russ!"
"D: Could not imagine drinking more then one at a time. A slow sweet sipper probably best suited to be shared due to its overwhelming sweetness."
"D - A beer like this was made to be savored, and if you slowly enjoy, it is great"
"This pours a rich brown with a thin tan head. The nose has dark fruits, sweet malts, delicate hops, whiskey, oak and alcohol. More of the same in the nose. A well balanced, super complex beer. One of the finest ales in the world. A bit young and not as good as the standard version. Should age well for many many years."
"D - I am pleasantly surprised by the drinkability of this beer. I was hesitant to buy it because I usually dislike any and all apple flavors in beer, but I went ahead with it because I have always been so impressed by JW Lee's beer and once again they have not let me down. I feared that the apple might make the sweetness of the beer cloying, but it does he opposite. The apple character really only comes out as it would in a brandy with a rich complexity rather than an excessive apple bite and it combines wonderfully with the caramel notes inherent in the harvest beer. I can't say that I want a whole case of this, but it is an exceptional and unique beer and I am very happy to have had the chance to enjoy it."
"2005 Vintage consumed Dec. 2007. Pours clear copper with weak off white head. Without any effort a bold sweet malty and fruity aroma is offered up out of the glass. Upon further investigation sweet plums, prunes and figs are noticed backed up by molasses, wood, a hint of caramel candy and booze. The taste experience begins with an initial medium bodied mouth feel that grows thick and viscous into the finish. The fluid ushers in some wood and malty sweetness first before the dark fruity esters take over with sugar coated plums, figs, prunes and stewed raisins. About midway the fruitiness becomes more sweet boysenberry like. The malts seem to go from the initial sugary malt sweetness to caramel candy, mildly roasted malts and then toward molasses and maple syrup. Toward the finish the wood, maple syrup and sweet caramel malts mix with a sense of booze. I get a lingering sense of all the flavors going deep into the after taste. Very nice."
"Drinkability is pretty good if you like English Barleywines, whose intensity is obviously not for everyone. Still, it's expensive and hard to come buy, a slooow sipper for sure, but an enjoyable one. I just bought the one bottle to see what I thought of it, but am really impressed, and will pick up some more for cellaring if they're still available. 3 years old, I'll bet this sucker has barely budged and can go another 7 easily."
"D - As with the other JW Lee's Harvest Ales I've had, this is a top notch beer. While I easily picked up on the barrel-aged character, the Calvados specifically wasn't apparent to me; the huge cider-like qualities of this beer are a result of the malt. It is still fantastic stuff; I'll need to snatch up another bottle and hunt down another Lagavulin cask and compare."
"now if only it were cheaper..."
"Pours brown in color with some slight ruby highlights. Smell is typical JW Lees Harvest Ale. Not really picking up any of the Calvados Cask flavor at all. Surprisingly, the same thing is present in the taste. Same Harvest Ale flavor, but the Calvados Cask aging is very, very subtle. Did I say subtle. You really have to search for it to find it. This is a good beer, but not the same barrel aging comes through as in the Sherry cask version. Which is phenomonal."
"2004 vintage bottle courtesy of Kryptic drank in 2008: Poured a cloudy brown color ale with a small foamy head with light retention and some very minimal lacing. Aroma consists of sweet malt with some light ester of apples which are really well integrated in the beer. Taste is a nice mix between a sweet rich malt base with some nice apples ester coming from the Calvados. Full body with limited filtration with some low carbonation and no alcohol notes. The Calvados is really well integrated with the regular beer and does not clash or completely take over - really well done."
"Maybe age this a few more years & you'll have something"
"Drinkability is moderate. High alcohol limits this beer, flavor is decent but not that special. A nice sipper, but I've had better."
"No gulping allowed (or perhaps even possible) with this one."
"Mmmm...delicious!"
"An interesting malty, slightly sour barleywine. Pours cloudy orangey with little head. Above average mouthfeel. A fine glass with or after a meal as you would a fortified wine. A bit drying.Alcohol and citrus and port aroma. ABove average for the style."
"2006 vintage. Pours a rich orange amber color. Slight traces of a head, good carbonation. Smells of rich malty sweet apples, nice fruit. Ever so slight oak mingles with the sweet apples and malts in the mouth. The oak is right away and is transitions smoothly to the juicy red apples. Velvety mouth feel. Finish is dry and slightly shortlived. Really smooth easy sipping beer. Hides the 11.5% very well. A must try."
"It is a sipper, heavy and full bodied, mostly sweet and vinous, with alcoholic heat producing some balance. Nicely done, but at times a bit too sweet; if it was not a very small bottle, it could have been too much. The port version seems a bit better balanced, but this one is still very worthwhile."
"Nice thick and viscous dark amber brew with very little head- which doesn't concern me given the style and abv. Very sweet malt in the nose, but I can't say I get the Calvados in the nose as much as I did the Port or Lagavulin in their other expressions, but there might be a slight hint of apple and walnut which would be conistent with that drink. Fruity and a bit nutty. The taste is also quite sweet and fruity and the apple is slightly more pronounced. Baked apple with cinammon, walnuts, sweet crackers and a hint of woddiness. Delightful. Smooth, sweet, and viscous in the mouth, this is a delicious sipper or dessert."
"This beer poured a nice golden copper color with little to no head at all. The head that was present was white. Little lacing present. The aroma was VERY SWEET with hints of oak, apples and maple syrup. The taste was similar with an oakiness to it which added a spiciness in the front. Had a thick sweet molasses flavor to it. Also had a nice bitterness to it. Mouthfeel was thick with little carbonation. Overall a fantastic barleywine!! Love it! I'll be buying more!"
"D = A good tasting dessert beer, but I do not like as well as the Sherry Cask or regular JW Lees Harvest. I would definitely recommend this beer. It is extremely good, it's just that I'd rather have one of those other JW Lees versions. If those are not available? Then there are very few beers I would prefer to this one."
"If this is your session beer, you are an alcoholic!"
"The taste is rich and fairly pleasant but too sweet for the long haul. No spices or bitterness to balance the sweetness. 11 oz as a nightcap is pleasant. Wouldn't want much more of this beer. The Port Cask is more balanced and less sweet. A much better choice!!"
"Overall: Quite unique and quite sweet. This is not your grandma's barleywine. Very sweet, very fruity, with tons of malt. The hops are no where to be seen in this one so if balance is what your looking for look elsewhere. It is good for what it is though, and rather enjoyable. Would like to try the whole line of J.W. Lee's Barleywines."
"Drinkability- If I could give this drinkability a 9 out of 5, I would still be giving this beer a lower score than it deserves credit for. No traces of the power of this monster. I could drink this until I die and be happy about it."
"has this one at city beer store a week or two ago. Hazy orange copper with a faint small white head that quickly dies a thousand deaths. Aromas of HUGE english malts, butterscotch, and apple brandy. Taste is similar and the calvados barrel lends significant apple hints to this brew and leads to an excellent drying spritzy mouthfeel as well. The drinkability is excellent"
"Pours blood thick with no head. A slightly hazy brown with a slight orange tint. No head at all. Smell is of meat and major malts. Taste pretty much follows. To me this is the least overpowering of the cask series. Taste is of a ton of malts and dark sugars. Very meaty with super dark fruits. Sugary as hell, and sweet, sweet, sweet. Mouthfeel is very thick and viscous. As far as drinkability, the sugar and mouthfeel defenitely make this one a sipper. Another good one from JW lees. But I still say nothing beats the good old harvest ale."
"If I were the patient type I'd buy a few bottles and see how they progress over the months."
"Overall Impression: Simply delicious. Hard core malt bomb with little heat and no burn. More MORE!"
"Pours a clean deep amber color, with a tan head. In the aroma, oaky, dried fruits such as plums. In the taste, oaky, dry alcohol, and plum-ish. A smooth dry alcohol mouthfeel, with a dry, candy dark fruit in the aftertaste. Kind of syrupy, but big flavors. Big in alcohol, but smooth, and a great sipper."
"The last in the series of cask conditioned J.W. Lees. This one lands close to the Port wine cask with it's sweetness, viscocity, and complexity. The alchohols are amplified by a rum-like sweetness and power. The flavors swirl around fruit cake ingredients: candied fruits (especially cherries) while throwing in peaches, pears, apples, raisons, nuts, and berries. Deeply sweet and rooted in a rum-cake maltiness and breadiness. Lightly boozy and modestly efforvescent. Finishes with a long, lingering sweetness. For me this one ranks second in the series; right behind the port cask."
"2004 vintage. Pours medium copper, mainly clear, with a flash of cream head that fades immediately. Aroma shows ripe fruits, raisins and cherries, big warming alcohol and bourbon in the aroma, small amount of weet vanilla, and hints of leather when agitated. Taste is a hugely rich raisin and brown sugar flavor, like a dessert with the strong sweetness, nice bourbon hints at a bite but never is more than a growl. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy, low carbonation, slightly dry in the finish with a warmth of alcohol. I love the original harvest ale and find that this one is not blending well yet as far as the flavors go, still an outstanding beer, but compared to the original I think I would cellar it a little longer to let things develop."
"Drinkability is good an enjoyable treat that would be great on a cool winter night. Only draw back would be cost."
"D - Not bad. I liked the harvest ale and this is more palatable for drinking a full bottle. I will seek out the the other cask aged types."
"What a great desert beer this would be: the sweet apple flavors from the calvados cask aging are obvious and vigorous, even perhaps a bit too overt for some. It's an intense and astonishingly complex monster, and it grows as it warms a bit and breathes. I highly recommend it. Not for the faint of heart or palate, this is a stand-alone sipping beer."
"Pours a three finger cream head that fades slowly to a thin ring leaving some lace. Cloudy amber color. Light carbonation and heavy bodied. Strong molasses nose. Flavor is sweet molasses and caramel, slightly cloying. Sweet alcohol finish, nice ale but must be drunk sloooowly. $6.99 for a 275ml bottle from John's Grocery Iowa City, Ia. Brewed 2004."
"Apple, wood, big sugary malt flavor with a lot of fruit underpinnings. Some bitter flavors, definitely the brandy in there. Huge amount of flavor, thick mouthfeel and very smooth despite the 11%."
"While this is indeed a really nice drink, I didn't think the taste was as *amazing* as I was thinking it would be. It's very sweet, and as it warms (no, I didn't have it cold, just cool) notes of apples, alcohol, and wood become apparent. All of this is very nice, but the sweetness here is quite assertive. Mouthfeel is very heavy and solid, which I like very much. Overall, this is a very nice English Barley Wine, but I think there are better offerings available from this brewer."
"drinkability: tough but i'll manage"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Prickly at the tip of the tongue, this beer retains some activity while in the mouth and keeps it from being flat. Bursting with huge, complex flavors... but not my favorite of the special edition Harvest series."
"In the aroma, there's just so much of everything, and in the flavor, as much as there is, the sweetness still slaps it back into a subservient role, but the result is a bold yet subtle blend of complex elements. I can tell you it is a simply marvelous partner to any number of blue cheeses, with Cabrales my personal favorite at the moment. The ABV is notable, just slightly masked, and a force with which to be reckoned. Still, as a standalone sipper or as a mate for earthy foods, this is one British beauty that has a place in just about anyone's cellar."
"9.3 ounce bottle, brewed in 2004. The beer pours a reddish/brown color with no head at all. It smells like dark fruit, apple/pear/brandy (which I assume is from the Calvados casks aging), sweet malt and brown sugar. The taste is sweet and tastes like brandy, brown sugar and some dark fruit, it's a very sweet tasting brew. Mouthfeel is full, slick and thick. Drinkability is good, even though this is definitely a sipping beer. Overall I liked this beer a lot, although I don't think I could drink more than one of these at a time."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable for something so strong. I could have this regularly if it was available. It's one of those beers I don't think I could get sick of."
"This is one stellar beer. I personally like the original Harvest ale a bit better, especially when it has about 8 years of age on it. I think I'll be holding on to one of these for another 6 years to see if it improves as much.... I'll be curious to see how the cask flavors meld and hold up to the age. Highly recommended if you're looking for a sweeter beer, and fantastic on a cold winter night by the fire after a big dinner. Well worth the $7.95 I paid for the bottle."
"this is a great experiment these fine brewers have conducted. i'd love to do something of the sort"
"This one is truly a treat; it has seemed to age really, really well, with a wonderful balance of flavors and a vinous profile that is not overpowering or overwhelming. I dig this one."
"Honestly, this sipper makes you understand what a brewer's ""intentions"" are. If you don't like it, then you don't get it."
"D: This ale seems to do a bit better when fresh (vs an '04 that I tried a few weeks back), but you still can only handle one at a time."
"11.5 % ABV, 2004 bottle. Pours a hazy chestnut color, with a thin off white head. The head disappears very quickly. Huge apple, pear, brandy, boozy aroma. Aroma really jumps right out of the glass. Sweet, syrupy and fruity flavor, with notes of apples, oranges and pears. Very thick and coating, with very little carbonation. Maybe a bit of caramel flavors at the end. A bit warming from the alcohol. Somehow this is smooth, but overly sweet. The sweetness was too much for me."
"Brewed in 2005. Pours an orangish brown color with a thin white lacing on top. Aroma is sweet malt, caramel and alcohol. I can faintly pick up some apple in the nose as well. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. Taste is sweet and brandy like with a warming boozy finish. The alcohol definately makes it's presence felt in this one. Overall, another good beer from J.W. Lees. Perhaps this was a bit too young, I will try to age one of these 2005's a bit and try again."
"I will try another bottle. I CAN taste the quality in the beer, and I CAN sense the flavors of the barleywine, but the calvados barrel had to have a more than average amount of brandy left in it, because I have a bottle of real Calvados, and it tastes like I just drank it neat."
"While not an every day drinker, this is an exceptional treat, that is like liquid gold. I can't wait to compare the Calvados to the Sherry to the Laguvilin, as well as how the age through the years."
"Pours the color of bright, homemade apple cider, with minimal head. Complex aroma of dark fruit (figs, raisins), molasses, candi sugar, bourbony vanilla, and a trace of candied apples. Huge on the palate. Spiced molasses to start with, then apple tartness combined with rich, figgy sweetness, followed by a vanilla crescendo. Giant malt sweetness is maintained throughout. The finish is long, hot with alcohol, and sweet. A very interesting English barleywine. It seems that the calvados treatment has diminished the coffee/bitter chocolate aromas/flavors of JW Lees Harvest, in favorite of a still-sweet, slightly tart fruitiness in line with a Calvados character. Very interesting brew."
"Shared a bottle on the back deck in the late evening... highly drinkable if shared... I couldn't down the whole thing myself."
"Overall: 2004 Calvados - is a little too sweet for my liking, maybe time in the bottle will reduce this, but I strongly suspect that actually it will not as the sweetness coming from the Calvados seems engrained. A pleasurable effort nonetheless and a nice night cap, but not one I would pick up again."
"The initial taste was very sweet, almost sickening. The flavors that emerged were of plums, apple and walnut. The apple was expected as thats what Calavados is made from but the nutty flavor was unexpected and well received. In the end the initial sweetnes was a little too much to make this a favorite, however it is a great example of a different kind of oak aged beer with complex flavors."
"Much more subdued than it's lagavulin counterpart and in my opinion it's a good thing. At least 2% less RS than the lagavulin. Bigger caramel with a more complex malt component. Much more balanced and drinkable. No alcohol present in the mouth. Ends with a long smooth creamy mouthfeel. Yet still overly sweet, hence a less than stellar drinkability."
"The taste was something else. Brandy-esque, sweet. Strong. Calvados. This wasn't horrible, didn't taste bad, but boy is this sucker a sipper. I shared, and we had to eventually take turns taking gulps to finish it- and by gulps I mean barely large sips. It just wouldn't end! It felt like it kept re-filling itself. Mouthfeel was kind of blah, watery, thin. I couldn't have too many of these- I couldn't finish ONE- I'd rather have a smaller portion, as a long, long nightcap."
" Taste has improved over the years. Vanilla slight chocolate multigrain molasses caramel dipped apples. Mouthfeel is thick and chewy. Drinkability is great, I could drink eight or nine of these over the course of the day. I'll try, anyway."
"Aroma is heavy on alcohol, white fruits...apple/pear, malt and some lesser woody notes. Opaque red/brown/amber in color with no head nor even the suggestion of one. Foretaste is tons of caramel malt, sweet not quite ripe white fruits and a dry (maybe that is from the wood in the casks hard to tell) finish. Quite syrupy, but didnt seem to work as well to me as the Sherry Aged version."
"Had this beer last night, 2004 vintage. I probably should have let it age, but then I wouldn't know how it changes. Anyway, served it in a tulip glass at cellarish temps. Looked beautiful in the glass, minimal head and bright amber color. Smelled strong of booze, malt and dark dark dried fruits. I caught raisins and some prune in there, i think. The boozey smell was a bit over powering. Taste was more of the same. Incredibly sweet, dark dried fruits, intense maltiness and a nice aged oak character. I have never had calvados, but I picked up a liquor character that must have been imparted by the cask. A bit too sweet for me, but otherwise excellent. It had a wonderful aftertaste that lingered pleasantly. The toasted oak and roasty malt flavors really came out in the aftertaste. I can only imagine that they would be more prevelant if the beer weren't so sweet. Mouthfeel was excellent, nice and chewy, just what an english barleywine should be. The drinkability suffered due to the alcohol presence and primarily due to the sweetness. I had trouble finishing the one 9 oz. bottle. All in all, it is a good beer, and if the sweetness diminishes with age it will become an excellent beer."
"This is a two or three ounce at a time in a snifter sort of creature. Not really my cup of tea... or beer as it were... but I'd give it another go just to be sure."
"Bright red color. Fairly aromatic, full of deep apple brandy, coconut and vanilla from the wood along with a light aromatic malt presence, with hints of fruits, brown sugar and caramel. The most aromatic of the Harvest cask ales, thus far. Lacking body however, like ever Harvest cask ale. Flavor is very, very sweet, more like a dessert beer and definately more of an after dinner beer. Light apple brandy flavors, caramel and fruit pie with well hidden alcohol. I think these beer need more time in the barrel, perhaps they would take on more depth and body."
"These experimental JW Lee Harvest Ales are pricey to pick up, but the flavour more than makes up for it. The Calvados aging adds a definite dimension to the beer that I enjoyed, and I'm sure any English Barley Wine fan who also likes the flavour of apples would enjoy this one. Great beer."
"This is a sipping beer. I recommned drink slow starting fresh out of the refrigerator and let it warm up as you drink it. There will be some noticeable differences."
"Drinkability: Truly a sipper, but a good one. When you finish the beer and set down the empty glass with shaky hands and a dopey grin on your face, that means its a good beer."
"Drinkability: Frankly the beer was to boozey and just to dam sweet for my taste. This beer would probably be ok for spliting a couple or three ways. Definately a siping beer. I still have another bottle in the cellar. That is probably where it will remain for a year or ten."
"The mouthfeel is wonderfully soft and smooth, syrupy and full, just enough fizz to cut the sugary fruit. It's a sipper, of course, very drinkable, but one at a time, thanks."
"275 ml bottle. The Calvados cask Harvest ale pours out a brownish color with almost no head. The aroma is prunes, caramel, and grapes. Big, malty flavor. Very sweet caramel flavor. There's definitely some influence from the Calvados cask. Dark fruit, like prunes. This beer may be thick, sweet, and almost flat, but it tastes so damn good, you hardly notice those things. A tasty winter treat, and the 275 ml bottle is the perfect size for this sipper."
"Drinkability  This was a real treat to drink. It is exciting, explosive, and sure to spur an hour-long discussion among beer advocates."
"Drinkability and Overall: I've been through a bit of a rough spell that past couple of weeks. Things haven't quite been turing out the best for me. Tonight I was in particularly low spirits, and I figured it was time to hit something special. This was it. Perfect tasting beer beyond all aspects of what I know beer to be. My favorite beers are the over-the-top beers that can still be delicious, complex and balanced. And this one fits the bill perfectly. Some breweries go too far in ""pushing the envelope", but this one is a standard to which American brewers should look up to. Ale in it's perfect form."
"Surprisingly close to Calvados in taste and character. This one is definitely a slow sipper that would be ideal in front of the fireplace on a cold winter night. Very warming. Interesting how a beer acquires the higher alcohol and flavors of the spirit that previously was aged in the same wooden cask. At a price of over $8.00 for this small bottle, I think I will pass on this one next time, though I'm likely to try the other cask aged Harvest Ales that Lees offers. For value, stick with their more pedestrian ales which have a higher drinkability and the same superb quality. The Calvados is so pervasive in this one that it renders it somewhat one dimensional."
"9.3 ounce. $7.75 at Wine Warehouse in Charlottesville, VA. Had to look up that calvados was brandy prior to evaluating the beer. The brandy flavor and aroma were present, but the alcohol was just a smidge to high and the bittering just a bit harsh for max enjoyability."
"The beer pulls a splitsville from the 275ml brown bottle and sets in my glass a deep orange-amber color with the head plentiful, the texture creamy and the color a splendiferous light tan, as its dissolves, the resultant lace a silky curtain to drape the glass. Nose has a nice malt presence, a bit of tartness, oak and a hint of caramel, start is decidedly sweet with a nice grain presence, the top is light to medium in feel. Finish is benign in its acidity, the hops overwhelmed by the sweetness and alcohol, quite dry almost vinous, and once again a beer that will age nicely, and a real belly warmer, got to love these beers."
"D- This is a very interesting barley wine. I think it was made to be light and sweet to compliment the aging in calvados casks. Very nice beer with a very interesting twist."
"It pours a clear (it's been filtered), medium-amber body with a full head of frothy white that drops slowly but leaves little lace. The nose is malty with some wood and a mild vinous character (but that might just be the alcohol). It's creamy and smooth in the mouth with a restrained, fine-bubbled carbonation and full body. The flavor is intense, and it's almost too much to take in all at once. This is surely a sipper! Some apple from the Calvados does carry through (cold, it appears almost grape-like), but mainly it's the sweeter brandy (sugar/alcohol) that comes through. It finiishes surprisingly drying given the huge amount of sugar there, but its underlying bitterness and alcohol help with that. Very nicely done!"
"This is a perfect winter warmer. But it is on the sweet side so it will make a good digestif."
"Amber, totally clear. Interesting aroma with appealing apple notes, honey and wood. Its overall quite warming, but bears nowhere the charm of a regular JW Lees, has nowhere near the malt richness, depth. On the palate, it feels thick, buttery with a harsh syrupy apple juice component. Complex notes of honey, earth, peach and a much stronger bitterness than the non-barrel aged version. Medium carbonation level, full bodied, very sweet. Unmemorable, but perhaps the second best of the lot to me."
"Pours a brilliantly clear full copper color, it is topped by a very thin pale head and is actually fairly well carbonated. The aroma is thick with alcohol as well as notes of thick chewy malt, and perhaps a hint of cidery apple in the finish. Actually the apple aroma slowly builds over time. This is a thick viscous brew, it is lightly sweet up front and almost light as it first hits the tip of my tongue. As it flows across my mouth it becomes quite full and thick. The apple notes from the calvados cask are certainly here, though they are a bit restrained, and really become full in the finish. This beer is quite malty as well, almost caramel-like in its malty sweetness. There is a certain soft butteriness to this beer, perhaps some hints of vanilla, and a soft hop bitterness in the finish, which helps to make the sweetness more palatable. This is a pretty tasty beer, though the Calvados casks are not overwhelming, and if I did not now in advance of it, I would have assumed that the apple notes were just a normal part of this beer."
"Im still not getting much difference between the beers regardless of the type of cask they were aged in. Theyre all a beautiful, glowing amber with low carbonation. Theyre full of alcohol, sugary sweetness and raisins, but I get little or no difference between the different aged versions. Theyre all good, though."
"Syrupy sweet, with decent acidity to balance. Fruity throughout, with apples being particularly distinct (due to the Calvados cask aging). Medium body, & subtle carbonation. Young, quite sweet, yet oddly very quaffable."
"2003 Calvados  Still and thick like syrup  the pour was so slow that it looked like a still picture. Light clear golden amber color with no bottle conditioning. Huge alcohol nose with hints of honey, malt and apples. Wow this is a huge beer with a unique thickness and a flavor profile. There is a sweet, malty aftertaste that is like rum soaked raisins and candy apples. Not an easy beer to drink but a great beer. 6.99 in NJ."
"Poured into a Rapscallion snifter, formed a 1/8"" head over the clear copper brew, with slight lacing. Slightly sweet malt aroma initially, quickly overpowered by alcohol notes. Taste is of sweet malts up front, then the alcohol takes over, seeming to evaporate in the back of your mouth, but in the nicest possible manner. Slight fruit tones, but they do not shine in comparison to the other two powerful aspects of this brew. Mouthfeel and drinkability are great for the style. Way better than that scary Lagavulin cask stuff..."
"The colour was the colour of honey. No head to speak of unless you swirled it around for a bit. Aroma as that of Honey, apples, spice cake and a touch of alcohol. The taste is simply yummy. Warm and satisfying honeyed apples and malt. A bit of sweetness as it warms but that wasnt a bad thing. One can taste the Calvados in every sip. This was one of the most complex nightcaps I have ever had. Every sip I took I wished another was added to the glass. Drikability was good even with the high octane nature. It did sweeten as it got warmner, but hell. I might not be able to drink many of them but when my bottle was done I sure wish I had another for tomorrow night. Seriously one of the best barley wine I have ever had. Kinda reminded me of a more refined 120 min DFH. Or rather what DFH 120 will be if you let it sit for 5 years. Highly recommmended. WOW"
"This one is worth aging, as promise oozes slowly outward. It's way too raw and firesome now. But there is hope."
"ng"
"275ml bottle with a green cap. This poured very similar to the standard Harvest Ale. It has a bright amber body with a slight off white head that goes to bubbles shortly after leaving sparse lacing about the glass. The smell is rich and malty with lots of notes of fruit mainly apple being present. Taste reminds me of a caramel apple and alcohol with a slight smokiness to it. There is a lot of malt sweetness going on with this beer. Not much of a brandy drinker I could not specifically discern where the brandy had its effects. It finished smoothly and has quite the warming effect due to the 11.4% alcohol. Mouthfeel is sweet and creamy with good carbonation. This has fairly good drinkability a little less than the standard though. Overall a good beer that I would like to age and see how it turns out. I look forward to trying the other three cask versions for comparison."
"I suspect this, together with the Sherry Barrel selection, will age the longest of the series due to a healthier balance of acidity."
"NB: Given the opportunity, I'd probably give this a ""taste"" rating of 4.25, as I don't think it's substantially worse than the others."
