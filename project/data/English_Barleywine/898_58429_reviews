"Not too harsh for a barley wine"
""
""
""

"Overall, a solid bourbon barrel-aged barleywine that impresses by the quality of its even execution rather than any single memorable aspect.  Not a go-to like Insanity is, but definitely worth consideration."
"O - Held up pretty well for being four years old and enjoyably mellow."

"overall, a little disapointed because it didnt reach the heights i was hoping it did, but overall a pretty good beer. perhaps i need another one to lay down for another year or two and see if the booze mellows a bit and try it again. anyone want to trade :)"

"22 ounce bottle into snifter, 2012 vintage. Pours slightly cloudy deep ruby red color with a 1 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin lace cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big caramel, raisin, toast, toffee, vanilla, oak, clove, bourbon, brown sugar, and light booze. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt and barrel notes; with good strength. Taste of big caramel, raisin, brown bread, vanilla, toast, toffee, clove, oak, bourbon, brown sugar, light chocolate, and toasted earthiness. Lingering notes of caramel, brown bread, raisin, vanilla, toast, toffee, clove, oak, bourbon, brown sugar, light chocolate, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible balance and complexity of dark malt and barrel flavors; with a fantastic malt/barrel balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a moderately creamy, slick, and lightly syrupy moutfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic BA Barleywine! All around awesome complexity and balance of malt and bourbon barrel flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."

"Mouthfeel - Slick and coats the tongue a bit."

"O- a delicious and complex beer with great depth. Aged for about a year and it seems to have made this beer great."
""
""
""
"O: Overall, great. I'm really enjoying this beer, it's definitely different than a traditional barleywine, but for a bigger, heavier beer, this is delightful."
""
""
""
"Overall: A decent barleywine, but one that lacks the complexity of other versions, partly because its bourbon character is distractingly high. There are many tasty flavors present, but most of them are too sweet, creating an unbalanced combination."

"Not a bad bourbon aged barleywine, has a really nice sweet butterscotch flavor that I loved. A bit more body and this could have been up there with the best of them."

"Ontap, medium amber colored brew. Off white foam leaving some lace. Aroma of dark fruits, spiced apple, bourbon, more fruit. Flavor has a base Barleywine sweet maltyness, accented nicely by big oak and moderate bourbon. Rummy raisin notes are more than welcome here. Alcohol is warming but not overdone in the flavor profile. Dry oaky tannins round out the finish in a full bodied ale. The carbonation is at a healthy medium. Overall quite satisfying. Let this brew warm, it took on a new dimension. A fine job of barrel aging, this is a good Barleywine."
""
"Overall, this is a very nice Barleywine, and the bourbon barrel aging has added a nice layer of complexity that was sorely needed in the basic Below Decks version of this beer. There is perhaps a bit too much sweetness in here (admitting that such a profile fits with the style), and the alcohol vapors do get very strong after a few sips, but on the whole this is very worth trying."

"Overall after having two bombers for 8 bucks a pop I am convinced this is the best bourbon barrel beer ever made! Even at 10 bucks its a steal."
""
""
""
"OVERALL: Pretty solid for sure. This one is certainly enjoyable, complex, and very well balanced with a good blend of barrel flavors and base beer. A thicker, heavier feel would make this outstanding. Still, it's very nice as it is and I would definitely drink this again. Thanks again SliverX. Recommended."

"A very good barrel aged beer, one of Heavy Seas better servings. Definitely worth a try."
"This beer is underrated. I was unsure of it when I purchased it but after I had it I got a few more for my cellar. Anxious to see how it ages. Strong vanilla notes. A wonderful and readily available barrel aged barley wine. Also, for the price 7.99, it's at least worth a try."

"O: Tasty, goes down dangerously easy, not too filling, strong kick, good representation of style, it’s a little bit better than the regular version but not enough to make it an upper echelon barley wine."
""
""
""
"Overall - very unique. I can see this being niche-like to barreling fans, but I like the uniqueness in flavor. This would cellar well provided I could keep it in storage."
""
""
"Very boozy, both in taste and in fact. Needs to mellow out for a little while in the glass, otherwise the first several sips taste like a Jack and coke. Starts out thin, but develops a nice full mouthfeel. Tasty, complex and warming. A must-try for bourbon fans."
""
""
"The beer started off really well but towards the finish it felt a tad thin and simple (for a BA Barleywine). Its enjoyable though."
"medium/full body, moderate carbonation, nice warmth. an excellent bba beer. i do wish it had a bit more of a hop profile since it's still a barley wine, but to hell with it."
""

"O: Solid. A sweeter barleywine - appropriate for the ""English"" moniker (this is no SN Bigfoot or other hop-forward American Barleywine), with the bourbon adding a nice flavor to the overall experience. Thanks to my brother-in-law for bringing this one north from Baltimore. . . ."
""
"Might be nice to hold on to for cellaring. Enjoyable barleywine."
""
""
""
""
"Smells sweet like a barley wine, but also has the bourbon nose. Nice red pour with a small white head that doesn't do much of sticking around. Has the barley wine sweetness without any hops really to balance it, which is strange. The bourbon is thrown on top. Not sure it works, but it’s good enough."

"This is another delicious version of the Below Decks. The beer is fantastic on its own, but the bourbon adds depth and mellows the alcohol. The barrels impart not only bourbon, but also some vanilla notes. The maltiness of the beer is balanced, fruity, and sugary - just the way I wanted it to be. This is definitely a beer worth trying."
""
"O: Good for a try, but for me, a one-and-done."
"The beer showcases malt balance in vivid display- with little rebuttal from hops, yeasty fruit or spice or from water chemistries, the beer is ripe and pungent with all of the glory of English hops. Though done in America, the brewery really shows great command of the style."
""
""
"Still. For the price, very nicely done. An American treasure in development. Keep at it Heavy Seas, you're almost there!"
""
"Overall I thought this was a good beer and a good example of the style, it had everything that I look for in the style, it just all came together just the way it should. This beer had great drinkability, it was very smooth with hardly any alcohol showing up in the taste and it had lots of flavors that held my attention nicely, one bomber is the perfect amount for me, but it would also be nice to share with someone. What I like the most about this beer was how balanced it was, nothing was too overpowering and the flavors went really well with each other. What I liked the least about this beer was nothing, I can't find a single thing wrong with it. I would for sure buy this beer again next time it is released and I wish I would have picked up another bottle to throw in the cellar and see how it ages, it was worth the $9 and I would recommend it to anyone that likes Barleywines and barrel aged beers. All in All i was really happy with this beer and it made for a great brew to celebrate my birthday with. I haven't had the best of luck with Heavy Seas, but all the bombers I have tried from them have been above average at worst, I'm liking what this brewery does with bigger beers, good job guys, you can be sure I will be trying more of your beers and I would love to try the original Below Decks Barleywine, nice work guys."

"Drink- I think this one was the best of the 3. A good amount of vanilla and oak and a good malty flavor was pretty balanced. Would like a fresh bottle of this. Seeing as this was a 2011."
"Overall Heavy Seas keeps knocking their barrel aged beers out of the park. Give this one a go, or set it down for a few years. Would easily get again."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was the flavoring, and the thick and syrupy feel. The flavoring started a bit mild, but once it came to temperature all of the notes and glorious aromatics within blossomed. This full flavored thickness was added to by the physical stickiness and warmth of the beer and the abv. This made for a pleasant feel on each aspect of the sip and follow-through. As with the flavoring, the aroma was also a bit mild in the beginning. This improved only marginally, however, and while all of the expected notes were there, we were wishing for a bit more pop by the end, to fully round this guy out."
"Overall: Nothing particularly wrong with this beer but it lacks the overall depth and power I would expect from a barrel-aged barleywine; the lack of a hop presence is also a detractor"
"I expected this to be a little more assertive than it was. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't that much of a barleywine."
""
""
"Edit: had to go in an up the overall a bit. This got better as it warmed."
"Would recommend to a discerning friend. If it sounds good to you, worth a shot, not over retail though."
"Tried this on cask today the Ginger Man. At first it was a little unrefined but tasty. Probably what I would expect considering how much I loved the 2 year old version. As I drink more, it gets better and this beer is wonderful fresh, but it could still use some age. Glad I was able to try this on Cask."
"Bourbon-barrel aged barlewines are a style I have really developed a taste for over the past 12 months. I don't drink them very often, but I just cannot pass them up at the store. This one is an exceptional value at only $8.99 per bomber. It's no King Henry, but it's better than you might think. I plan to pick up an extra bottle or two for the cellar to see how it ages. If the sweetness develops and the alcohol dies down, this could be a beautiful beer."

"Medium full body with medium carbonation. This is a tasty sipper. While a bit too sweet it works for my present mood."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"To note: I don't know if it's just me, but the barrel aging process that Heavy Seas uses seems to not be the best... It's always overly sweet with a very nutty overtone and not much for a bourbon taste. I remember having their octoberfest (or one of their fall beers) and it was almost indistinguishable from this beer. Just something the take caution about."
"O - Good flavors, not too hot, good finish, good beer. I'm really enjoying this one."
""
""
""
"Medium body, soft carbonation. Warming alcohol present. Very nice that the barrel does not overwhelm this beer, but I feel like there is something missing in the middle. Still a good beer, for a very reasonable price."
""
""
""
"Cost: $7.99"
"D: pretty good english style barleywine here. however, personally i did not detect as much bourbon as i expected. lots of sweet malt almost overpowers any and all bourbon, oak, vanilla notes. unfortunately i do not remember the vintage the brewer brought to this tasting, but i am going to guess it has been out of the barrel for a little bit of time. otherwise, a very solid english barley."
"O: This was tasty, but 22oz was too much. I would probably pass on it again, but we'll see how it does with age. Still, for $7.50 a bottle you can't really go wrong here."
""
"O: A simply good beer but for the price I can do a lot better many other ways."
"I still recommend. I'd love to try the Cabernet version."
"Deuce to tulip. 2010 vintage. Looks good; deep amber with very thin lacing. Smell is almost nonexistent. Pretty underwhelming, actually. Tastes good; nothing too complex, but a nice journeyman's attempt at a BA barleywine. Mouthfeel is good; little carbonation. It's a tasty brew and a good value for the price."
""
""
"O: The Barleywine does get overpowered a bit by the alcohol. But it is a nice mixture of both."
""
""
"O - Very subdued bourbon treatment on this. A bit on the sweeter side for a barleywine, but still tasty. Doesn't taste boozy but I can feel the alcohol sneaking up on me. Overall, wished there was more bourbon in both the nose and flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- There is obviously a good reason people are requesting BA beers. This is a grandslam Heavy Seas! They also make this beer non-barrel-aged, I recommend getting both and doing a vertical."
"o - Overall I preferred this one to the Cabernet version, but I'm not convinced either improves form aging. Both are good beers, with the Cabernet verions being much sweeter, and this version havnig more bourbon (as expected), so I guess it just really depends on what you like in a barleywine. Either way, I'd suggest drinking them relatively fresh as I think they both faded already in a year."
""
""
"Everything I ever wanted in a bourbon-barrel barleywine, and it turned out to be magnificent fresh."
""
"Notes: Wow, what a steal at $5.99 a bomber. Who ever heard of a bourbon barrel aged beer at this price point, especially one of this quality? I will be stocking my cellar with this. A diamond in the rough for sure."
"Pours a clean orange-ish to brown color with an off white head. In the aroma, vanilla, oaky, and bourbon. In the taste, oaky bourbon, vanilla sweetness and a dry alcohol presence. An alcohol like bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry alcohol and bourbon like aftertaste. Big bourbon presence sweet oak and vanilla for a balance."
"Overall pretty solid, but also real easy drinking too. Surprisingly not much barrel aging bourbon character here but no complaints."
"A nice beer, but to be honest, if this was more than 10% the cost of the original, I would likely pass it up for the original."
""
"Pretty good beer, and I'm glad I picked it up. Some subtle flavors in here that make for a complex beer that works pretty well."
""
"Pours a thin rust color with an average tan head that dissipates fairly quickly. Smells boozy, oaky, bourbony w/plenty of sweet malt adding to the nose. First sip is super malt sweetness layered in a ton of oak. There is bourbon in there too but the oak unfortunately is much more dominating. The sweetness that hits first fades rather quickly leading to a bitter finish highlighted almost entirely by the mighty oak. Though very thin bodied there is just enough carbonation to warrant a decent mouthfeel. The 10% ABV is not well hidden at all. It is in your face making one to think it is stronger than it really is."

"O: Not as good as I expected, but still worth the money I paid for it. I generally enjoy all of Heavy Seas' Mutiny Fleet productions, but this is a qualified exception. I guess it didn't age well. I will withhold any recommendation, positive or negative. I won't buy another it, even if I ever see one."
"Overall: It was enjoyable and I look forward to comparing it to the red wine version that I have."
"The mouthfeel is on the heavier side with carbonation is low. Overall it was a delicious beer, the bourbon and the sweet, maltiness of the barleywine were integrated and balanced almost to perfection. The bourbon especially really stood out to me. The barleywine flavors were very good, but seemed a little overshadowed by the bourbon at times. Excellent beer overall though and an extremely enjoyable one to sip on this evening."
"Loved the flavor on this, but other areas fell flat. For the money I'll take Schlafly's Barrel aged BW at a fraction of the price any day. Still, I was thrilled to try it..."
"Poured into an imperial nonic a deep rich amber with a thinner but well formed off white head atop.Aromas of deep vaniila,and caramel eally stand out,the vanilla tinged oak is a bit heavy handed in my opinion.Somewhat boozy and very oaky on the palate,vanilla and caramel flavors add more sweetness,it is very smooth going down though.Another barrel aged beer that gets a little to much of the ""aged"" flavors,its not bad but it could be better with less aged flavors."
"O: A good BA Barleywine. Vanilla and oak are quite pronounced, possibly more so than unsual because the underlying beer seems a little thin. I imagine this one has some age on it as seems to be quite mellow. 3.5-4.0"
"Very good beer, & I rarely say this, but perhaps too heavy on the bourbon. I really enjoyed the base beer, & would have liked to see more of it shining through the veil of the barrel. But alas, it wasn't to be. Still very enjoyable!"
"Overall, for $7.99 a 22oz this is a pretty tasty bourbon barrel aged barleywine."
"I can't for the life of me remember where this one came from, in fact I initially thought it was a different vintage of Greater Pumpkin. That said, I loved this beer. Poured a dark amber/brown color, with a little light brown head. Aromas of bourbon, oak, vanilla and brown sugar. On the palate, this one was medium to full bodied, with bourbon, brown sugar, oak and booze. Very good."
"This is a medium bodied brew with a medium level of carbonation. It is sweet and easy drinking for the most part. The oxidation quality gives it some depth. Overall it's not a bad offering, the 10% abv is hidden quite well. At less than $8 a bomber this is worth having again."
"In my humble opinion, the Mutiny Series ales from Clipper City has more misses than hits. The latter includes The Great Pumpkin, Hang Ten, Letter of Marque 2010... and Bourbon Barrel Aged Below Decks. $7.99 is a more than reasonable asking price, considering how much enjoyment I'm getting out of the bomber."
"Mmmm, pretty tasty. This along with the cabernet version might be my favorite so far from the Mutiny Fleet. Bourbon and oak flavors are in perfect harmony with the beer, not too overpowering but notable enough. ABV is well hidden, goes down smooth. Gets a bit thin and surprisingly mild as the ounces pass, but this is a fine beer that I would certainly drink again."
"D - Just not a wower. Fun to try."
"d: Its been awhile, but I seem to recall liking the regular version better than either barrel aged version. I did enjoy this, but stronger barleywine elements would have been welcome."
"Courtesy of markwise over on ratebeer. It pours clear mahogany with tan head. The aroma starts with sweet bourbon and then moving toward mildly harsh boozy bourbon as well as prunes, figs, raisins, molasses and some heat at the end of the draw. The taste is smooth sweet inviting molasses, caramel, vanilla, sweet bourbon, spicy oak, raisins, figs and a thin strata of dates. Yummy."
"I'd recommend aging this one for a couple of years to restore balance. The alcohol bite should retreat and some of the sweet malt should develop to give this beer a more rounded and complex flavor profile."
"D - quite easy for the style, the wood may put some off, I would have another"
"Another decent bw, but again a Heavy Seas light bw that couldn't hold up and took on all the character of the barrel. If you like bourbon its worth drinking, otherwise skip it."
"A hefty powerful barleywine - while not overwhelmed by barrel notes, it certainly doesn't seek to balance them."
"D: This had an amazing scent with very nice taste and body. Alcohol was noticeable but not bad, so it was fairly easy to drink. Could probably improve with age, but fresh is already much better than the standard Below Decks (or the Cabernet Barrel version). Perhaps the best beer I've had from Heavy Seas."
"D: Good drinkability while cold. Decently balanced. But the flavors just keep getting stronger (in a not-so-good-way) as it warms."
"Poured into a tulip. Appearance is a nice mahogany color with a white head and a tad bit of lacing. The nose is straight bourbon. A bit of light caramel and fruit in the background. The booze goes with the bourbon. Taste is predominantly bourbon again, but done quite well. Really nice feel with booze and bourbon plus a slight sweetness underneath. Much better than the original, though not quite as interesting as the cabernet version."
"Flavor is very good, but not great. Creamy mouthfeel, decent amount of booze, medium carbonation. The bourbon addition is a stellar addition to the Below Decks barleywine beer! Some hops, fruits, charcoal...possibly some toffee? Overall, a very good beer. I think I liked the wine aged Below decks better, but this was definitely delicious!"
"The beer pours a deep amber color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great! It has a wonderful mix of burnt toffee and bourbon. It's warm and inviting with a tremendous wood character. The taste is damn good as well. It has a warm, burnt toffee flavor; rich and boozy with tons of caramel malt sweetness. The bourbon barrel aging adds a good deal of vanilla character as well as a fine bourbon flair. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a well brewed beer that has only improved with the barrel aging."
"This was sampled alongside the cabernet barrel-aged version, and I thought this was the superior beer."
"M/D: It is very smooth and easily drinakable. I really enjoyed this beer, a great barleywine. I bet it would be even better a year from now, I just couldn;t wait that long."
"Bourbon Barrel Below Decks is good beer. I've enjoyed the bomber and don't have much to complain about at all. It would benefit from a little more body and just a little bit of a hop presence. But, it's good stuff as it is. I like the approach with the barrel aging. I have no idea how long it was in barrels, but it was the perfect time. There's just enough bourbon, vanilla, and oak to make things really click. Easily recommended."
"my fears this might be an american barleywine were allayed, i suppose, but it doesn't exactly inspire thoughts of an english barleywine, either"
"No heat which is a bit odd. I actually might like a bit more heat. Deceptively easy to drink. Wish it were more flavorful."
"Drinkability: Moderate at best due to the big ABV and bit of a heavy weight after a while; great flavors though and this would definitely be a beer to share; can't wait to try this one with a year or so on it."
"Best thing I've had from these guys in a while, maybe ever."
"Ahhh there we go taste is very nice. Much more fruity qualities come out. Red currant, cherry, date, fig, caramel, toffee, vanilla, woodsy notes, with some bourbon on the finish. Slight wood tannins as well. Very nice light bodies barley wine."
"Overall this is a very nice bourbon-barrel-aged beer for a relatively low price. Definitely worth a shot."
"D- a nice one to sip on, one of the better bourbon barrel aged barleywines i've had, i wouldn't mind picking one of these up again if i can find it"
"D: A rather bland effort for a barrel aged barleywine. I would not really bother with this one."
"D: A very smooth example of the style. The bourbon is complementary, which is a nice change after recently having a number of bourbon-centric brews."
"OK, so it's a HUGE beer, not the most drinkable, but it's wonderful and I would buy again on sight. Great beer from Heavy Seas, the Cab Barrel was more innovative but this is just as good. Nice one!"
"Dark brown with nice sudsy head. Warm aroma of bourbon, wood, butter, cake, caramel, and grain. Tastes smooth with warm bourbon, grains and butterscotch. Bourbon is rich and complex without being boozy. Barleywine is cut, mellowed, and mild by the aging. Strong on butter, plus a strain of vanilla unique only to barrel aged beers I've had on the verge of infection or souring, but still in their excellent stages. Drinks smoothly, with a fuller medium body that feels a bit lighter. Abv prohibits large quantity drinking, but drinks nicely with some different character than most bourbon aged beers."
"D-i really enjoy this, the malty sweetness has a nice amount of depth and the barrel aging adds a nice balance to it. the bourbon lingers in the back with notes of fusel alcohol that detract slightly but still well done."
"Drinkability: It is sooo easy to drink multiples of this great brew."
"A: Angel's hair thickness of head, sporadic spots of foam along the interior of the glass, medium amber to ice tea in color - 4.00, S: Strong bourbon aromas, very noticeable alcohol, smells of golden raisins and dates, lots of caramel, thickly sweet - 4.25, T: Tons of malty sweetness, dark molasses, brown sugar and raisins, clear hop bite, alcohol is evident and provides a slight burn, the palate also has a bit of toffee, bourbon is present but has a lesser role on the tongue than on the nose - 3.75, M: Full bodied and quite silky - 4.50, D: All around a good beer made better by some bourbon barrel aging, certainly worth a try - 4.00"
"After a very pleasant experience with the carbernet-aged version, I felt compelled to give this one a try (even more than before). It pours a translucent ruby-brown (heavy on the brown) with a pathetic amount of large bubbles standing in for what would otherwise be considered a head. The nose is subtle bourbon, oak, quad-like yeast, molasses, vanilla, and citrus hops. It all melds together very nicely. The bourbon begins very subtlely in the taste, while molasses-dipped citrus hops take the point, immediately backed-up by citrus peel. The sweeter elements make up the next wave, including more molasses, maple syrup, and some oak. Lighter malty elements begin the final flavor stripe, joined by more oak (drier, this time) and the bourbon. It's all pretty tasty, but the striations are, for me, far too clear. The body is fairly hefty, with lightly moderate carbonation and only a slight coating effect. A very nice brew overall, but I prefer caberneted version better."
"D- Boozy for sure. Lots of bourbon here. If you love bourbon this beer will suit you just fine."
"Notes: This is a brew well made, without being extraordinary it covers all the essential expectations of a quality bourbon barred aged barleywine. In fact, it is quite a pleasing surprise since it improves right away the perceived roughness of a fresh regular Below Decks, beyond the expectations of what was too harsh a barleywine. While there is a touch of alcohol edginess it is fairly well integrated with the overall brew and does not give it a too strong off-key note."
"Not entirely sure what to think about of this beer. The cask conditioning and barrel aging improve the beer IMHO, but it's still not entirely my cup of tea in a Barleywine. Even with the barrel aging, the beer still shows some alcohol and heat in the finish. Nevertheless, this is still a pretty nice beer."
