"If you come across this, let it sit for a little while. Or open a bomber, have a glass, contemplate eternity for a few weeks after you've stoppered the bottle, and return to find something quite flavorful."
"Serving type: Bottle"
""
"Overall- not exactly the style I am use to. But not saying it is bad. Just unique by using different malts or different amount of certain malts. I believe this beer could be aged due to the higher amount of carbonation and to settle down some attributes to the beer."

"Cheers."

"Bought at Table & Vine in West Springfield. Thick black-brown appearance with some hints of red in the light. Thick head when poured, but it dissipated eventually leaving some nice lacing on the sides. Aromas are very sweet with distinct flavors of malts, dried fruit like raisins, nuts, toffee, and alcohol. The drink definitely had a sugary-fruit taste mixed with toffee leading to a bittersweet drink with a sharp bite of alcohol in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is a good carbonation and helps to give the drink a  crisp, creamy feel. Overall, a fantastic drink."

"This might be my new favorite barleywine."
"I'm pretty new to the style, but this one wowed me.  Very complex flavor of dark chocolates and fruits and wanders in to the Belgian Strong Dark category of flavor.  The aroma and texture complimented the flavor quite well.  I was very impressed with this one."
""
"Let this one sit awhile to warm and open up for a strong but we'll balanced barley wine."
""
"Overall: My favorite offering from Pretty Things. Trumps Baby Tree Quad, Field Mouse Farewell, and Barbapapa. An all-star offering for sure."
"The flavor follows with a good amount of alcohol, but again with that licorice and bitter spice. Sweetness throughout with a touch of toasted malt and chocolate on the back end."
"pours a syrupy brown with active bubbles and thin sticky head. brown sugar and molasses, subtle cherry, plum, dried fruit on the nose. not as strong in malt aroma or taste as i expected. dominant flavor is brown sugar. some nutty flavors. maybe a bit of a cherry cola flavor. boozy but deceptively easy drinking for a high alcohol beer. definitely leaves sugary residue on your lips. kinda let me down in the flavor category."

"Overall: Worth trying at least once but not something I would go hunting for. There's a lot better out there but you would need to really hunt. If this one comes along before hand grab it. It won't disappoint but I am not going to over-hype something to just let you down."

"This beer is drank from a bottle and has a pour of hazy brown and beige. The style is Barley Wine. The aroma has a roasted malt caramel and toffee smell. The taste is sweet with a bitter aftertaste. Alcohol and caramel also come into play in the aftertaste."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - This is too sweet for anything besides a small serving size. Even then, I'm not sure about it. The medicinal flavor doesn't really overwhelm, but it isn't pleasant."
"Deep amber in color with dark, blood orange hue and a dense haze. Poured with a thick, dense, tawny foam that slowly reduced to a wispy cap. Full bodied with a thick oily feel up front and light, tight, smooth carbonation through the middle to the end. Sweet toffee, toasted and caramel malt aromas with earthy hop notes and unmistakable booziness. Huge toasted and caramel malty flavor up front followed by subdued hop spiciness through the middle. Hop presence fades toward the end as the sticky maltiness takes over once again. Finished dryly with a candy toffee and strong boozy aftertaste. "
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a deep amber. Thin head that lingers. Smells like toffee, a bit nutty. Taste is similar, candy, toffee. Rich, smooth mouthfeel. I could drink this with pancakes in the morning or a spicy pork chop for dinner."

"13.12.3 Update: Tried the Nov 2011 bottling again after cellaring for over two years. Indeed, cellaring has mellowed this beast out, and it is now extremely smooth, fruity, and delicious. Unquestionably a barley wine, and a great one at that. Immediately upon opening the bottle the aroma smacked me in the face with an entire fruit cake. Raisins and plums, but also over-ripe pears, apricots, dates, and a hint of treacle. Heavy as fuck, but mellowed the fuck out."
""
"O: A nice and complex English barleywine. The yeast definitely imparts the English part. Way too easy to drink for 13.5%, although it's hard to do more than just sip slowly. Great price point. Definitely has some aging potential as well"
""
"Overall a real solid and impressive barleywine. Great barleywine find indeed!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste was great! Sweat and and malty. Maybe too much spice, probably should have used just on mulling pack. Overall a great experience though. Will try again later in the season!"

"22 ounce bottle, no date on it so I have no idea what vintage this is. Served in a snifter, the beer pours a dark reddish/brown color with about an inch light tan head. The head sticks around a little while, and there's a decent amount of lacing. The brew smells like dark fruit, caramel, apples, dark bread and some booze. It tastes like caramel, toffee, dark bread, dark fruit, wood, and some brandy. It's a nice, sweet malty brew. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's a bit slick and has moderate carbonation. I like this brew a lot, but then I've liked everything I've tried from Pretty Things so far. $10.99 a bottle."

"Oooh Wow! A barn burner at 13.5% ABV! Really nice! Tasty, sweet, syrupy, alcoholy, nice to look at, nice to think about - just don't drink it quickly! Despite my high impression of this beer, for me it is a one-time only beer given its high ABV. Nonetheless, I will gladly taste it again at the brewery, or at a fest. Thank you to Dann and the Pretty Things team!"

"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. It is sticky sweet and very boozy. For a fairly big brew, it is sadly lacking in complexity and still very alcohol forward for being cellared for 2+ years. I would probably avoid purchasing this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: definitely a beer meant for sharing and this one lets the malts do all the talking. not even a whisper of hop bitterness. very smooth and well rounded and for being 13.5% the alcohol is hidden surprisingly well"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I like to put a little age on my barleywines, so cellaring this one for 1 1/2 years certainly softened the rough edges and allowed the complexity to develop; another fine beer from the Paquettes"

"My first real foray into barley wines. Absolutely delicious. Pretty little things nailed it. My pour was dark and fluid. When I drank it i had the warm sensation of wine in my chest but had the taste of a delicious brew. I'm just going to say get this one while you can."
"O: Seriously sweet, enjoyable EBW. The malt profile balances some of the sweetness. As usual for PT, this beer has its own unique twists that keep it from being just any 'ole EBW."
"Reviewed from notes. Pours a deep auburn/crimson with nice clarity and minimal head. The smell has waves of raisin, caramel, maple, and some mild hop character. The taste is malt forward with a nice caramel sweetness and a great balance. Robust favors with touches of dark fruit, toffee, honey, and just the right amount of bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium with low carbonation. Overall, this is a well crafted barleywine ith delicate flavored that work quite well."
""
"Pretty decent English Barleywine. Probably won't grab another, but was very worth trying."
"O: This is a beer that has a lot of character; trouble is, my tastes don’t agree with any of that character. This tastes more like medicine than beer to me – making it a struggle to get through a glass – and that’s certainly not something I treasure. Overall, its complexities were not lost on me, though I still couldn’t enjoy it; if you really enjoy barleywines (or licorice), this may be right up your alley."
"O: I liked this beer and I need to have one fresh for comparison of course. Will definitely pick up another bottle next time I'm back East, a great beer for the winter. The nose is an absolute winner, this is a beer I could sit around smelling all day."
""
"The beer pours a deep mahogany color with a wispy cap of foam. The aroma bounds with sweet sugar. The palate brings a combination of sweet malt, dark fruit, and even hints of chocolate. It hits the right tones as it move across the palate and signs off without much bitterness, as a good Barleywine should. The alcohol definitely makes it presence known, but not in a way that is objectionable. Good stuff."
""
""
"Overall: I really like this beer. It brings a lot to the table. A nice complex, non barrel aged, barleywine. This drinks quite well despite being bottled in the last few months. I'd like to get my hands on an older bottle as it would probably be incredible. Nonetheless, this is a great brew and I will most likely be buying this at least twice a year. Lastly, this is my first brew by Pretty Things and I am extremely satisfied. Awesome job!"
"Served properly into a PT OFR stem glass, a deep garnet brown color, not quite opaque, very effervescent, and topped with a small, creamy tan head that stayed small, but retained forever and left streaks of lacing on the glass. The nose was malty, nutty, caramel, and slightly woody. Taste was similar, bready, nutty, toasted grains, caramel malts, hints of old raisins, brown sugar, herbal hops, and a stiff, woody finish. Booze was felt, but pretty well-hidden, taste-wise. Body was medium, smooth mouthfeel, even if slightly higher in carbonation that I'd have expected. Careful pouring: it's very yeasty towards the bottom, and I could swear the yeast was actually still active. Nice beer overall."
""
"Best thing? My friend smiled and I think he's planning on bringing me more beer."
""
"Overall. A complex barleywine with lots of fruit flavours that I personally didn't dig in a big way. Pretty boozy still too. Maybe not bad, just not my thing."
""
""
"overall- although it's another nice beer from Pretty Things, I'd like to have another bottle to see how it might improve from cellaring for a year or two."
""
""
"O. Another great beer from Pretty Things! I will look for a few more bottles to store and enjoy over the next few years!"
"Don't pass it up and let it breathe for 20mins (I did not and sadly it cost an excellent review)"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Recommended."
"O: Our Finest Regards comes off a little like Hair of the Dog's beers, and both breweries are interested in historical styles. It's a really unique, buzzworthy beer and ideal for winter. I braved the whole bomber... but it took three hours."
""
""
""
""
""
"Maybe I'm superimposing, but I think this beer genuinely succeeds at capturing a time of year and a feeling. When it hits the shelves, my caveman self prepares to trundle into the winter lair, pop open a bottle with some caveman friends, and hunker down. And I don't mean to suggest that this beer has neanderthal qualities - it's very refined. But it does tap into the part of my lizard brain than wants delicious boozy drinks, shared with good friends on chilly nights."
""
""
"Well I can't say this one isn't complex. I'm not sure I've ever really had a beer quite like this one before which is something I can't say often. I'm not entirely sure I love the entire flavor profile, but the overall was more enjoyable than the sum of its parts. Had a few too much Belgian character for my taste buds, but glad I got to try it nonetheless."
""
""
""
"""Our Finest Regards"" does all that American barleywines are asked to do. Its enormous taste is balanced, complex, and robust. It does all this without a hint of roughness, bite, or harsh textures. Even though the label portrays a kind beer built for drinking; remember- this is a sipper for sure!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A bit sweet but not over done, smooth & powerful but well hidden alcohol."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a murky orange-brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, caramel, brown sugar, and citrus zest. Taste is much the same with a fruity finish and an alcohol kick on the finish. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty but pretty strong."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is one of the finest Barleywines I’ve had the pleasure to try, and a welcome break from many of its peers, which come across as overly sweet and alcoholic. Here, the sweetness is tempered wonderfully by bitterness and ash, and the high 13.5% ABV goes largely unnoticed in taste, making itself known mainly in the aftertaste, as well as in a continuous burning on the tongue and soft palate. Fantastic brew; would drink this regularly."
""
""
""
"O: This is a powerful and smooth barleywine, and damn delicious. I shudder to think what a solid 8-12 months in a bourbon barrel could do to this thing."
""
""
""
"Taste has a great caramel toffee malt flavor, picking up some interesting notes like banana in the aftertaste which is odd but not necessarily bad, I find it hard to believe this to be stronger than even 8% since the alcohol is so well hidden, great body with soft yet active carbonation."
""
""
""
""
"O: A nice big english style barleywine. Not overloaded with molasses like a lot of them are, but still quite sweet in all the ways that you would expect. Hefty dark malts, vanilla and a little fruitiness goes a long way. Pretty Things is quickly becoming one of my go-to breweries."
"O: Great beer that has potential to be excellent with some age, I think. Complex and rich. Very enjoyable."
""
""
""
"Overall:"

""
""
""
""
""

"Very nice version of the style. Emphasis on flavor rather than a shovel-hit to the face with alcohol. I'd have this again."
"O like this barley wine. Very formidable. Job well done on a solid beer."
""
"O: Interesting, rewarding, and compelling. I will seek out this beer again, even though it's not obviously excellent. Highly recommended."

"This is a very nice barleywine. Unfortunately, as it was bottled only a few months ago, it is much too young to really be getting the grandeur that I assume it will one day show. And that is what I will leave it at: this is a very good barleywine, though I think it has the potential to be stellar with some age on it."
"O: I tought it was an average barleywine but seems like it could probably settle or drink better with a little time on it."
""
"A great beer from one of my favorite styles. Wish I had one to age longer, as I can see this getting better."
""
"Overall, this is my first brew from Pretty Things and I am definitely enjoying it. English Barleywines are quickly becoming one of my favorite styles and I'm glad that I got to try this one. Recommended."
""
""
"I thought this was fantastic. I'd like to buy a couple more of these: have another fresh and another a few years down the road."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o: Very nice b-wine, I hope to find more reasonably priced bottles outside of PA."
"I wouldn't have guessed this beer to be 13.5% ABV, but then again, Barleywines are generally well above 10%. I enjoyed it. Well done, ol' chap!"
"My Finest Regards to the brewers. This is an interesting, tasty example of an English barleywine."
"Yeast is quite flavorful and delicious. Caramel flavored, viscous body. Sweetness is a bit dominant. Super boozey. I like it, but undeniable booziness with the 13.5% ABV. This beer seems like it would age well with the yeast at the bottom, and high ABV. After taste is piney hops. I really feel they flavor profile want the beer to be served on the warmer side. Glad I tried it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"M&D - big and powerful, deep aromas and flavors make this a great winter beer, layered and semi-complex, another good PT beer"
""
"O- a very nice barleywine, One of my favorites of this style for sure, a tid bit on the sweet side but very nicley done, not aggressively rounded by bitter hoping to control the sweetness, but just enough to keep it all together."
""
""
"Overall: I love beers like this. Gets to the heart of what I want in beer: layers and layers of interesting, delicious malt flavors. Strongly suggest picking up multiple bottles and aging them."
"O: A decent Barleywine. Alcohol comes through way to much. I'd like a better hop profile."
""
""
""
"O - I can see this one smoothing out and becoming more enjoyable over time, but I think that's about 6-12 months away. Right now, there's too much booze and not enough complexity to enjoy it. I would love to have a bottle with some age, but fresh, I'd have to pass."
"Turned out to be a good choice for 1,000th review. These guys are what I like in craft beer-- peculiar and idiosyncratic, but competent."
" The taste has some fruit from the yeast with nutty and spiced elements. A nice plum like tinge with stone fruit tanginess and light caramel notes with light ripe banana accents. The tast has a slight dark sugar like muscovado with gentle fig and hint of melon with mild citrus andd mild alcohol w/ nutty semi-dry hazelnut like toasted accent. The flavor has a sweet honey tip which augments the grain flavor. Overall a very good barleywine with a lot of complexity with fruit flavors that rival some cognacs. The Barleywine is one I could enjoy frequently if not for the relatively high abv Cheers Pretty Things!, thanks cuz!"
""
"O - A very good English style barley wine. Pretty things nailed the style. This beer is worthy of the cellar."
"[94/100]"
""
"Overall, not in my top 5 EBW, but just shy. Definately deserving of it's top 25 ranking in the style. Would gladly drink again."
"O- I am a huge fan of English barleywines, and this is a great example of the style. I am also a big fan of Pretty Things and their beers never disappoint. Wonderfully sweet, smooth with a great alcohol wallop. I highly recommend trying this beer."
"Mouthfeel is pretty good- not too thick with a little carbonation. Of course this is a pretty pricey brew but one worth getting if you like barleywine."
""
"for such a high ABV. Glad I got the chance to try this one."
"Whew!"
"Final thought - Price is high at $11 bucks a pop, but worth it. It does have to travel pretty far to get here. The 13% abv means you only need one or a couple if you are a nut"
"O- I liked this beer for the most part. I thought it was going to be a bit too boozey from the smell, but the taste wasn't too boozey. Overall pretty good for a Barleywine. Could have been a little bit less syrupy."
"O - A very nice sticky sweet offering. It's only weakness is it's ultra syrupyness, but beer is to be enjoyed and not overly criticized and I certainly enjoyed this one. Worth a pickup despite the slightly larger than average price tag."
"O: This is a tremendously refreshing English Barleywine. Goes down incredibly smooth for the high abv. Lovely dark fruits throughout mingling with caramel, bread and molasses while finishing nice and roasty. Exceptional!"
""
""
""
"Thanks to DrewShal9 for this one!"
""
"D - Very complex and actually quite drinkable considering how strong it is. The alcohol is noticeable, but it doesn't seem as harsh as one might fear from a beer of this strength. Nicely done, and I'm sure this would age well if given the chance."
"single finger rapidly dissipating head on a very nice dark amber body. a little lacing. aroma is very different than most barley wines. this one has more of a chocolate and yeasty aroma with earthy notes. more of the same in the taste without the boozy flavoring that so man y barleywines seem to have. medium body and moderate carbonation. this one is very differnent from other barley wines I have had and one of my favorites."
""
""
""
"Very dark mahogany color with white filmy head. Smell is very pleasant, but basically malt and dark fruit. Some of the booze does come through though which is a slight detractor. Flavor is malty with a hint of roastiness. A little bit of tart fruit in the background. Thick bodied. I really like this beer. This is my first English Barleywine, and I'm not sure if this is per style, but I'm digging it a lot more than I do American Barleywines. Very nice."
""
""
"O: The mouthfeel was a tad of a conundrum for me as I don't know how something this high ABV with all the right barleywine characteristics can be as thin as is it was. Still a nice tasting brew though."
""
"Overall, a nice barleywine, mild, drinkable and approachable."
""
""
"Overall, a really one of a kind, tasty and complex barleywine. The alcohol is well hidden. I definitely will pick more of this up and keep some in the cellar to see how it evolves."
"Thick. Creamy, sticky flavors. This has the most unusual power. Like a syrup without q problem."
""
""
"Bottled November 2011. Pours a dark, ruby-brown with a small tan/off-white head that disappears very quickly. Scent is a bit boozy, slight brandy aroma. A lot of dark fruit and sweet caramel malt. Tons of malt and some faint English hops. Taste is nitially dark fruit forward with hints of alcohol...not nearly as much as I was expecting though. A lot of caramel and vanilla with intense malt flavors. Raisins, dates, plums, and English malt and hops with a nice, warming boozy finish. Mouthfeel is full bodies with nice carbonation and slightly syrupy. Drinkability is scary high for such a big beer. Overall, hard to distinguish between a quad and this english barleywine. Could easily pass for a slightly hoppy quad. Nevertheless, a great beer."
"O: Seems good English Barleywines are hard to come by with American brewers. Might have to stick with good old J.W Lees when I need my sweet barleywine fix."
""
"Pours a clear garnet with a pretty large creamy head. Nose is thick, sticky malt, honey, some leafy bitterness. Mouth is malt forward, sticky, a definitely leafy finish that could either mean this is a touch oxidized or it's something about this particular beer. Sweet, honey upfront. As it opened the leafy finish kind of calms down, but there's still something there I don't really dig. Feel is super creamy, thick and velvet. Overall pretty nice, but not one of the better English barley wines or old ales out there."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a slightly cloudy deep copper/brown color with a decent sized beige head that shows moderate retention and lace. Smells of toffee and caramel with hints of chocolate and brown sugar. Bready chocolate aroma with a hint of peanut butter? I swear it smells like a peanut butter ball a little. Taste is malty sweet with lots of caramel and brown sugar up front. Dark fruits like dried cherries, plums, and prunes. A hint of warming alcohol comes in but is never harsh. Thick body with a sweet sticky mouthfeel and a low to moderate level of carbonation. This is a big beer that demands respect, but proves to be quite easy to consume. I enjoyed this, but I did find it a touch boring, on the other hand, I'd love to see how this ages."
""
""
"D: Pretty damn tasty beer. One of the few pretty things beers that I've had but another tasty one."
"O: Goes down easy, quite tasty, not too filling, well hidden kick, nice representation of style. I'm not a big fan of barleywines, appreciate the style but don't often seek them out. I would definitely have this beer again though."
"Great beer. Zero hopping to speak of and a great hybrid-english style BW. I would be interested in seeing where this one goes in the cellar."
"Highly recommended. I wish it were a little easier to obtain but for ~$10 a bomber I'd definitely pick this up again."

"Thick body with medium carbonation."
""
""
"Overall, Our Finest Regards packs a ton of alcohol that it hides very well. It's a good English Barleywine. I think with some age on it, this one will improve."
"Overall: I don't normally enjoy barley wines but I'm willing to make an exception for this one. A great once and a while buy."
""
"A very solid English barleywine from Pretty Things, it's great to see them turn out a successful big beer. This is drinking very well, in spite of its youth."
""
"Overall a pretty nice and well-rounded version of a barley wine. It doesn't stand out in any one particular respect, but it's a beer I'd be happy to come back to. I'll have to find some of the next batch."
"Overall - Honestly, one of the best barley wines i have ever had, american or english. This offering really impressed me and a steal at 9 dollars. Seek this one out!"
""
""
"O/D-I was waiting for this beer for a while. This is a big beer. And I must say that this one blew me away and far exceeded my expectations. I am normally a Hophead. However, this one really made my night. Just needs to be tried. Seek out this beer. This brewery can do no wrong!"
""
"Big thanks to Gillard for this one. It pours amber with copper hues and off white head. The aroma is pretty fruity with dried peaches and prunes as well as musty maltiness. The taste delivers hoppy spiciness and some yeastiness flowing quickly into sweet malts and some malt roastiness. Into the finish the spicy hops surge forward a bit."

"Super tasty, well balanced and a sipper clearly from its size. A massive beer that opens up a little bit more with every sip."
"Big malty nose that's more reminiscent of various fruits than toffee or caramel. Plums, prunes, raisins, apple butter. Some bready malt, but mainly sweet fruitiness. Buttery toffee right away in the first sip, though. More complex and warming than it smells, although impressively at this ABV, it's not terribly boozy. The fruitiness continues to be the overwhelming force. Almost a syrupy sweetness, but a sort of dry, almost lightly funky bitterness cuts through it. Pretty interesting beer here, definitely worth a shot."
"The feel is good, medium bodies with good carbonation. A little dry to finish. Overall another well made beer from these guys. A nice sipper here."
"This is a nice sipper that emphasizes the quality malts used. I nice take on the style for certain."
"Some warming alcohol comes through on the exhale. Mouth is crisp from ample carbonation, yet goes down very smooth and finishes only slightly dry; well done here. Overall, a very good English barleywine that would be a treat to have again."
"O: Drinks just fine but this doesn’t hold a candle to Abacus or the other greats of the style."
"This beer pours a reddish color with a huge tan head. there is a little less lacing than i as expecting. the smell is dark fruits all around with a warm alcohol nose at the end. the flavr is malty sweet with a nice dark fruits flavor, and an even more noticeable alcohol flavor than the nose was. the mouthfeel is medium to full bodied and extremely well carbed. this beer is great im glad i grabbed 6 of them when it was available."
"dark brown in color with a huge head of tan that just towered over the top of the glass. Settling down smoothly and evenly it produced a thick coating of lace all along the sides of the glass. Rich vanilla and woody aromas are being picked up almost immediately. Huge notes of oak and subtle caramel and toffee and truly dominating here for sure. Warming only brings this out further, rich and decadent, sweet aromas just building off each other here. The first sip is divine, subtle, and rich and perfectly carbonated it simply rolls across the tongue with a gentleness that is unheard of. Vanilla and caramel merging with oak like notes and touches of earthy hops all working together seamlessly."
" if you have a chance to try it, jump on it this one is really good. im surprised this one isnt getting more attention honestly."
"Overall this was stupendous. Nothing really different, especially for an English Barleywine, but really solid and enjoyable. Highly recommended; I haven't had a bad beer from this brewery yet so I will continue to purchase everything I see from them."
"Poured into a chalice a nice cloudy grape color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy off-white head, which does leave some sticky lacing behind. The nose is malty, grapy, with some figs, raisins, plums. The taste is sweet, malty, grapy, with a nice touch of dark fruits. Medium Body, no way this is 13.5% ABV, goes down very nicely. A very tasty brew."
"Pours a caramel brown with a tan head. Those nose is light caramel, toffee, brown sugar malts. No alcohol to be detected. For such a big beer, the nose is a bit too reserved, foreshadowing a bit. The taste is really mild, smooth and maybe a touch lacking. Just like the nose, caramel, toffee, brown sugar malts. All pretty low-key. The mouthfeel is medium-thin. Not really to style. Medium carbonation. Overall, the accomplishment of this beer is how they turned 13.5% into a smooth, mild, booze-free barleywine. That said, it totally lacked the punch that I want with a beer like this. A bit bland, unfortunately."
"(sampled at Dak’s memorial day tasting. Courtesy of beerbastard!!). Pours a hazy mahogany with a khaki head. Aroma has some caramel and grains. Taste is sweet with some bitterness. Medium bodied with a slick texture. Finish is slightly bitter. Pretty nice beer but not a tradition barleywine. Glad to have tried this one."
"One of the best barleywines I have ever had. Very well balanced, you would never guess this one comes in at 13.5%. Very nice mouth feel and extremely smooth. If you still see any of this around I would def reccommend snagging as many as you can."
"D - Very drinkable, It's Well balanced, not too sweet or too boozy. Definitely malt dominant, but well balanced."
"The beer pours an amber color with a white head. The aroma is sweet malt with some toffee mixed in. I don't really get any hop or alcohol notes in the aroma. The flavor is heavy on the brown sugar, alcohol, molasses and toffee. The alcohol is definitely present but is not overpowering. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Heady stuff, righteous night capper....way to go large Pretty Things....gaining major respect for the stones shown on this undertaking.."
"all in all, this was a nice barleywine, but not something I would seek out again, which sucks cause I bought two bottles hoping to age one but I don't see the point now. I see this holding up for a year and a half but not improving any and only breaking down after that. I Want pretty things to make an big ass American Barleywine next year. Good effort though."
"O- a cool bw and not your average one but I guess that's to be expected for pretty things."
"D - Very drinkable, which is remarkable considering the 13.5% abv. Tons of flavor but well balanced and never gets too sweet to alcoholic."
"D - This was something nice to enjoy, especially with a friend (since it is 13.5%) Would like to get a bottle of this to age. Not bad though."
"Overall, this is a quality English barleywine. Quite smooth and the fruit character is well done. With the ABV at 13.5%, and a decent hop profile, I see this beer holding up well for years to come. I definitely recommend picking up a bottle to try and one to throw in the cellar. Another solid brew from Pretty Things and great for a cold winter's night."
"D- very tasty feels good. Could drink a few if these but so high in alcohol."
"Overall: A nice English Barleywine. Recommended."
"This is the kind of thing you want on hand for the perfect occasion - like a snow storm, or other miserable weather."
"D - Would have scored higher but damn, huge beer!"
"Drinks very easy, the ABV is well hidden. This spot on in style & is going down easy as cold weather has returned. I'm gonna finish this bottle with some hard salami & Blue Stilton, I am confident this will pair well"
"Mouthfeel is medium-heavy bodied and rich with a tight, biting carbonation, very good."
"I expect this will age well given the decent level of hops and effervesence, perhaps the subtleties will come out more over time - that said, this is a solid, traditional, powerhouse of a barleywine and quite drinkable now."
"Winter 2010/2011. Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a very dark orangey brown color with a slightly brown tinted thin head. Head didn't last long at all. Aroma was a slighty sweet fruit smell. Not as syrupy sweet as most barleywines. Slight hints of burnt oatmeal. Flavor was sweet, started off akin to vanilla, finished with a peppery aftertaste. Coated very well in the mouth, almost too well. A tad too syrupy. Great to drink. Very well rounded beer."
"I really like this one; easy enough to sip over time & the abv is well-hidden, too. Perhaps it's too hop-forward at the moment, for the style anyway, but I think this one should hold up pretty well over time (wish I had another to keep around). Regardless, I like it just fine now."
"This beer pour a beautiful dark ruby with about a half finger of light tan head that doesn't stick around long. The nose is big on dark fruit and rich malt. The taste is very similar, maybe with a little caramel/toffee in the profile. Seeing that this was made with a blend of belgian and english yeasts, the mouthfeel has a subtle belgian style, tiny bubble carbonation feel. Medium to full bodied and leaves an oily coating all over the mouth. At an ABV of 13.5% it is certainly a sipper, but you can hardly taste a lick of the alcohol. Very enjoyable."
"Much closer to an English-style Barleywine than the hoppier American versions. Our Finest Regards is dominated by sweet malt, though manages to be far short of cloying. Strong vinous character, lots of dried dark fruit, and balanced by a toasted nutty/caramely flavor. Very good."
"D: made it through, at 13% very drinkable."
"Poured almost all head and took a long time to dissipate. Ruddy brown color with lots of tiny bubbles percolating to the top. Medium weight body. Strong caramel and chocolate component as well as malt. And it seemed to get better as it sat and warmed. Really a fine example of an American-made Barleywine."
"I don't drink a ton of barleywines, but I think this is one of the better ones I've tried."
"Between the chocolate and dark fruit it makes me think of an English style quad. I like it."
"M- Full, almost syrupy. This is perpetuated by a sluggish carbonation."
"D-the syrup coating makes it a little harder to drink, but is overall a very nice beer on a snowy day"
"Much better in the mouth. Big full bodied monster mouthfeel. Lucious malt just thick and creamy. Huge toffee and caramel, date, fig, prune, raisin, milk chocolate, alcohol, herbal hops, slightly sweet on the finish and a little hot. Great sipper for a shitty winter day...like today."
"D--This beer fell a little flat for me. Just seems to be missing something, a theme with what I have had from Pretty Things. Not a beer I would go out of my way to try. Bummer, this is a favorite style of mine and was super pumped for this offering."
"D: Really different, especially for an English Barleywine, but quite solid and enjoyable."
"Cheers"
"D- Some alc. but way less for a beer this high in ABV. A very enjoyable sipper."
"Pours a dark, very clear caramel hue. The head is reduced to a collar after a short while. Smells of brown sugar, dried earthy fruit, toffee. Some alcohol too, but it's surprisingly reserved given the high ABV. The palate closely resembles the nose, highlighting flavors of dried fruit, apricot, berry preserves and toffee. Nice fruitiness from the yeast, though it's a clean and malt-forward beer overall. Medium in body, could use a touch more viscosity. I enjoyed this quite a bit, though I think some gentle oxidation would give the beer more depth. Wish I had another bottle to age for a couple years."
"Where's the alcohol? Dangerously drinkable. I'm a fan."
"Overall this was a nice beer for the style that managed to not overdo it on the sweetness. Nice, balanced, and well worth a shot."
"This is one heck of a beer that is really balanced and warms the core on a cold winter night."
"As much as this brew seemed to have going for it I must say that the drinkability was a bit below average. Decent enough flavors but I feel this one could use a bit of age to see how the flavors mellow and meld together."
"Skal!"
"Pretty solid, just enough sweetness to keep it together. Great esters present."
"Taste is sweet to start, fruity in the middle, syrupy at the close, with alcohol lingering. Mouthfeel is quite smooth, and drinkability is good. Not my fave Pretty Thing, but a nice brew."
"D: Tasty, goes down ok, slightly filling, very strong kick, good representation of style, if you're ok with the heavy sweetness this is a good high-octane beer to sip on for a long time."
"D- I dont know what will happen to this with age but this english barelywine was just lacking complexity. There was nothing to savor in this bland beer and I was shocked it came from Pretty Things. Debating a drain pour and hoping age will do this wonders."
"D: Very good. A bit on the sweet side, but a fantastic flavor nonetheless."
"m/d-Very smooth for a barleywine. Nowhere near the syrupy thickness that I normally associate with the style. Leaves a bit of a bittery and cooling aftertaste that fades to a soft tingle. I was pretty into this one."
"Really enjoyed this beer. I will definitely grab another one."
"Medium body and a medium carb."
"Drinkability: A tasty barleywine that really hides the abv. I do want this sipper again. The spices are present but not overly done."
"This may be one the best big malt monsters I've had in a while. Absolutely perfect for sitting around the fire on a cold winters night. This is a sipper for sure. Great beer!"
"Probably my second favorite PT beer, after their Mild."
"A very nice beer. Nothing spectacular, but enjoyable. A little on the sweet side. Wish it had more depth."
"mouthfeel is somewhat light and spritzy which is actually quite nice. has enough body to support the booziness, the higher carbonation makes this pretty drinkable despite the high abv. i like it alot."
"D: The beer is surprisingly drinkable for 13.5%; it definitely tastes strong but no way near the level of double digits."
"Pours a deep ruby color with a nice frothy head that retains very well. Great lacing. Not usually something you see from such a high ABV beer in my experiences. Aroma is of cherries, bubble gum, laffy taffy, apples, smells like candy...raisins, tons of character and very inviting, with a touch of alcohol presence. Taste if of sweet malts, taffy, cherries, vanilla extract, figs, not very hoppy at all....dont look for balance here. Gets a little cloying after half the bomber is gone. This is definitely a beer with a high potential for aging."
"M/D - Not too thick, not too dry. Carbonation is really spot on, too. Perfect mouthfeel, actually. Ans, despite the boozy nose, pretty drinkable. I'm going to age the next one awhile to see how it develops. I have a feeling this could only get better with age!"

"22oz. bottle served in my Duck-Rabbit snifter. Winter 2010/2011 vintage. Pours a plum-like hue with a semi-hazy clarity. Head is creamy/frothy, off-white and approximately half an inch in height. Head eventually settles into a thin skim with a thick band around the shoulders. Some strands of lacing evident during the tasting. Nose reveals dark candied fruit, unrefined sugar and an intermingling of alcohol, without expressing heat or an overly caustic character. Taste consistent with nose; however some caramel notes come out in the flavor profile, and a slightly spicy quality is detectable at the finish. A light alcohol presence is expressed, but it is fairly subdued and seems to nicely intermingle with a light bittering hops flavor that helps keep the brew from being cloyingly sweet. Mouthfeel is medium-light, with a carbonation level that falls just short of lively. Texture is a bit oily across the tongue and some residual alcohol heat comes out and lightly lingers at the finish. This is an incredibly drinkable barleywine right out of the bottle. Heat is minimal and the abv is deceptively hidden. A great beer to crack open on a cold winter's day. Well worth your time if you have the opportunity to try it."
"Are any barley wines easy to drink? This one is interesting but you'll want to share the body with at least one other person."
"Mouthfeel is surprisingly light for 13.5% ABV and it goes down with a velvety smoothness. Overall, this probably one of the most drinkable high ABV beers I've come across and can only imagine how well this will age."
"D: Whoa, had no idea this was 13% until I checked this site. I guess I felt it but certainly didn't taste it. Definitely will grab another to age"
"D: Good bwine and a def candidate for aging"
"Overall this beer is very enjoyable and makes me want to further delve into the world of barley wines!"
"Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, smooth and dry at the end. Gives off a nice warmth overcast upon the body. Drinkability is definitely suitable for the winter. Sipper-slow for the frigid cold weather. If you've got some bottles: age now, drink later."
"I first tried this at the Otherside Cafe in Boston. It came out in a tulip which displays the deep amber tone well and shows off its very aromatic, fruity scent. At first taste it's a smooth, malty almost syrupy texture. They are very fond of their barley blends on this one and you definitely get that. It's a warm, spicy brew. It carries a festive fruity flavor that made it feel very festive for the winter holidays. I enjoyed the glass so well that I bought a bottle down the street for later!"
"wow. flavors have meshed well and the alcohol has integrated well making this beer as impressive as it was when i first had it, if not more so. kind of reminds me of an expertly brewed old ale at this point. Luckily I found this aged in the store because this is one of those beers that I don't have the will-power to age in my cellar. I tend to find it and crack it open before I've let it age properly. wonderful beer all around from one of the best breweries on the east coast."
"Overall: This is probably the best barleywine I have had. I am only just becoming familiar with English-style barleywines and this one is definitely going to turn me on to more of the style. The complexity of the malt is just a great experience which in the case of this beer can be enjoyed for a couple hours."
"D: Not a session beer, but tastes great and quite drinkable nonetheless."
"D- Good, boozy, but good. Pretty sure this one's going to cellar nicely. I'll tuck a bottle or two away and check back in a few."
"D: Really nice sipper for a barley wine and the abv is deceiving, this may be my favorite brew from pretty things to date."
"This barleywine's flavors just never shown through past the big alcohol character. It's hard to use the word 'bland' to describe a 13.5% english barleywine, but that's the first thing that jumps to my mind; no creamy malt flavors, no rich, aged fruit, no interesting sharp alcohol flavors, etc. Maybe this one is just too young to appreciate."
"Clear, deep amber and slightly coppery in colour with a yellow/beige cap of mostly fine bubbles. Good head retention, particularly for the abv, with sticky lacing. Nice aroma, lots of bread, plums, raisins, alcohol, toast, toffee, slightly buttery with a hint of berries as it warms. Hops had more presence in the flavour, contributing sturdy bitterness that was just underneath the surface flavours and a bit of grassy character. Sweet malts, plums, and alcohol were dominant, with the sweetness well short of cloying. Notes of roses, berries, and figs appeared as it warmed. Heavy in body, lightish in carbonation, smooth and creamy with considerable alcohol warmth, but no strong heat. Quite tasty overall, but it left me with the impression that it could stand up to (and benefit from) a little bit of aging so that the flavours meld together a bit more. I think I'll grab a couple more of these for the cellar."
"D: Bam."
"D= Very drinkable. Perfect for relaxed and slow enjoyment. Great Sunday warmer for watching a classic cold weather football game. Like old school Packers-Bears or new school Patriots-Jets rivalry. Looking forward to retain a few bottles for aging. This one is a keeper! :)"
"medium to full bodied mouthfeel with average carbonation; creamy. very drinkable, you have to remind yourself to slowly nurse."
"Well done Dan! A very tasty beer, and very dangerously drinkable for those cold winter nights. It will do well in my cellar as well, which looks like the rabbit hole on the label."
"D. Very nice, a great winter warmer(at least while this new). This should age exceptionally well. Can't wait to have one next Christmas."
"I haven't had a single sip of beer this week (unusual for me) so I decided to reward myself tonight with something that packs a punch. Our Finest Regards pours out a beautiful rose color, with a creamy two inches of white heading. A big perfume of alcohol hits immediately as it warms, followed by some stone fruits. Similar taste as there is with the nose, but there is an undercurrent of brown sugar and molasses to be had that reminds me of some of my favorites from this style. Body is not as big as the ABV suggests, but with that being said, it is one to share with others. Although I like the fact that this is a Barleywine with lots of unsympathetic alcohol content and flavor, I would imagine this is going to be even better with two to three years of age on it. A true Winter Warmer we have here from Pretty Things. Cheers"
