"Pours dark brown in color with some haze and a thin off-white film. Smell has incredibly rich aromas of fig caramel plum and oak. Taste follows the nose with rich toffee fig caramel and tons of vanilla, bourbon, and oak.  This is like dessert in a glass. Velvety smooth and an alcohol presence to keep everything in check."

"Looks none to special, but its nose is incredible. Super rich bourbon and raisins. Flavor follows the nose, lots of barrel character and dark fruits. On the backend is rich toffee. Satin mouthfeel."

"Too sweet and boozy for my liking and doesn't have much depth."

"Overall: I just picked up the freshly bottled newer batch of this, so I figured it was time to open this one up.  Such a rich and heavy beer, and I think some of that robust body doesn't allow any nuances to shine through.  The front is very inviting and complex, but once those malt and bourbon characteristics really pick up this gets a little too heavy.  Overall though, very enjoyable."
"Wow, what an amazing beer. I open this and take a smell and it's a kick right in the nose of bourbon. The taste is very much the same with Bourbon with also a nice amount of sweetness from the malt. This beer gets more boozy the more it warms up. I feel like this beer would be amazing aged."

"Trust me, this is a big beer that is worth the hunt!!!"
"O: guys, can you tell this one was aged in a barrel?"

"Flavors of caramel syrup, light traces of bourbon heat and woodiness that blends well with the big malt presence. Aftertaste lingers nicely, bits of fried plantain in caramel syrup and earthy tobacco woodiness. Rich and full bodied, this is surely a slow sipper. Much improved over the base barleywine, in my opinion. Recommended."

"O- Big bourbon bomb. Really enjoyable. Could use some more time to mellow out. But enjoyed every sip. Great for this dumb snowy weather were still having in MN."

"Deep dark reddish brown body like most barleywines you'll see. Scent is a bit boozy, which overpowers the slight hints of brown sugar and vanilla. Taste is a bit hot on the first sip, then it smooths out and continues to as it warms. Rich, dark fruits with toffee, brown sugar, and definitely vanilla. Plenty of bourbon notes in this. It is not hiding the barrel. Really well done BA BW. It's just a bit short of GI BCBW, so that's pretty elite company."

"Pours a murky amber capped by a beige one and a quarter finger head. Great retention considering this brew was barrel-aged, hints of lacing. Brown sugar, toffee, dark fruit, general booziness; perhaps a very slight more specific hint of bourbon, and some light oak. Opens with dates, toffee and caramel, brown sugar, ripe plums, and dried dark fruit. Big vanilla notes midpalate; the oak and bourbon really show up on the finish and complement the other diverse flavors. Full-bodied, syrupy and silky. Lower level of carbonation. Thoroughly enjoyable, however would have liked to see just a bit more richness in the flavors. Regardless, a great choice for one of the first three BA offerings from Pipeworks."

"O: I'm a bit torn by this beer. There are some aspects of it I liked greatly such as the bourbon characteristics without the bourbon booziness. But others, like the overt sweetness, not so much. Still a pretty good beer, though."
