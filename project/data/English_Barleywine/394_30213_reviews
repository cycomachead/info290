"Ruddy-brown pour with a half inch or so of frothy off-white head that sank to a thin layer; minimal lacing. Toasty aroma, bready, earthy, caramel malts. Toasted grains and malts in the taste, brown sugar, earthy, light notes of raisin and herbal hops, with a bitter bite. It's not as smooth as I like my barleywines, but it's drinkable, with a medium body and moderate carbonation. Decent, but not amazing."

"Really solid overall except that there was a lot of yeast at the bottom so decant carefully. Our last pour looked like Bud mud."

"The palate is nice. Toast, floral notes, caramel, burnt sugar, toffee and butterscotch are all present, in nice balance. Nice malt palate here. The mid-palate, OTOH, is a little thin. Drying on the finish with toffee, this beer is medium-light in body and has a medium-low level of carbonation. Nice stuff, I really enjoyed my pour."
"Copper hued with an eighth inch of tan head. Slight haze. Aromas of toffee, a touch of butterscotch, malt. Smells aged. A bit of dampness / rain water. Cool. Taste follows suit. Mellow and easy drinking. Smooth on the palate. Thin to medium bodied. Nice beer, cool to have one five years old. Thanks Dyan."

"Medium body and carbonation, smooth enough; kind of an unremarkable mouthfeel. Felt like it could have used a little more heft and stickiness."
"O: This is a nice sipping beer because it has some complexities in the flavors but the alcohol isnâ€™t very prominent in the taste."
""
"O - The flavors aren't offensive, but they're kinda unrefined. Nothing here stands out as foul, but the beer is so challenging to drink. It's missing a few things. Nothing really sets this apart."
""
""
""
"It's a ok barleywine, but there are a lot better ones out there. When considering the price point, I say just stay away from it."

"O- A good barleywine. I was hoping for a little bit more, and let it sit for a little over a year till this review. I'm bumping the appearance soley because of the awesome, awesome bottle label. If you love the Rudolph Christmas classic you'll appreciate it. Glad I could pick this up at the brewery a year ago, wish it was more readily available."

"The body was a reddish brown color body with not head but a thin lace around the top. The smell was sweet and fruity, had a bubble gum hint to it. The taste was sweet but had some hop bitterness to it. Very well balanced of the sweet and the bitterness. The mouth feel was nice and crisp. Overall this is a really good beer."
""
"Pretty good gateway beer for Barleywines, as most English styles should be, but they need to work on the bottle conditioning if they're going to charge north of $20/bottle. Violation."

"A really tasty beer, one I'm glad to have tried. I acquired this bottle over the summer, and I can't imagine it's too old. In any event, it is drinking wonderfully now."
""
"O - This is okay, too sweet for me, booze not particularly well hidden. Not bad, but if I'm drinking other things I'd pass on this one."
"Beer is medium in body, sweet on the front, nice finish on the back, the beer is slightly raisin-y flavored, I enjoyed it but there's nothing special about it."
"o - Overall a good barleywine. This one seems to be a big sweeter and fruitier than most, but the dark fruits are nice. Super easy to drink and nic emouthfeel, something I would have again. Would really like to try the BA version again."
"Pours a moderately-clear copper-red with a thin off-white head. Thin cap and a nice collar throughout. Nose brings some light malt plus a bit of cherry and fruit. Light booze Flavor is slightly malty with a bit of sweetness. Light grainy dryness. Moderate body with low carbonation. A bit of booze and a slightly-dry finish. A bit of sweetness. Decent barleywine."
"O: All in all, this is a decent brew. Nothing super special. Very bitter for a barleywine. Definitely try if you have access and like hoppy barleywines."
"I honestly expected a lot more flavor all considering... Not a bad brew however it left a lot to be desired. In this world of extreme brews it doesn't really fit in, however I do see it as a balanced staple."
"body is on the tinner side, moderate carbonation. overall, not a bad beer, but I probably won't look for it again."
"D - Good balance... A decent enough English Barleywine... Seems to be lacking some of the ""malt bomb"" qualities I look for in the style... Seems to be stuck somewhere in no man's land between the English and American style interpretations... Enjoyable none the less..."
"Decent mellow flavor. Fill wasn't too bad(I believe it was somewhere around $8). Easier to reach for then some of the overly sweet things you see in the English BW category on BA."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, strong kick, decent representation of style, it might not be the best EBW out there but it's solid enough to be worth drinking for a while if you want a poundable high-octane beer."
"A more subdued barleywine than what you'll generally find in the states. Noticeably drier than the norm, this allows the earthy hops and subtle vinous fruity esters to be highlighted rather than big sweet malts and boozy burn. Not tasting any traces of whiskey flavors, as this is said to have been aged 7 months in a barrel - perhaps some wood. It may drink clean and easy, but it left me wanting some more malt body and just a lil more sugar. Representative of an English rather than American barleywine for sure."
"D: drank pretty good but was also a decent barleywine and glad to have tried it."
"D: I was expecting more from this, especially with the positive things I've heard about the beer."
"I picked up a growler for the super bowl, split with 3 friends. The pour is deep brown with a medium white head. A very biscuity aroma, sweet, some alcohol. The beer has a nice sweet malty backbone, biscuity, some hot alchol. It has a lingering smooth finish. The body is medium and it is way too drinkable for such a big beer. A nice barley wine, a bit too pricey but very good."
"D: Not as good as the barrel aged version IMO but a damn solid beer overall. Have a few more in the cellar so we will see where this one goes."
"This is a renoun beer for Stoudts and well deserved. An excellent American example of the style and highly recommended."
"Definitely one for fans of barleywine. It won't blow your mind but it's as solid as they come. A little age may mellow it out some more."
"Pretty well beat up for a Barleywine approaching four years old."
"D: Pretty good overall"
"D. As the reviewer before me noted, why the green bottle? I picked this up because my wife liked the label. When I pulled it out for a barleywine tasting, I had to wonder: why would you put a high abv brew meant for aging in a green bottle? Regardless, this was a mediocre beer that I won't be picking up again."
"In the end, this doesn't seem to have suffered from the green bottle, but I still wonder what they were thinking."
"Taste starts sweet, but quickly finds fruit and bitterness in the middle, with the bitterness winning out at the close. Alcohol warmth lingers. Mouthfeel is rocky, with alright drinkability. This one just doesn't put it all together, which was disappointing after the good start."
"On tap at Als of Hampden served in a pint glass. Pours a hazy dark amber brown color with minimal white lace coating the surface of the brew. Nose reminds me of fruits with a minimal amount of malt/grain aroma but includes hints of a dry acsic quality almost like a combination of pear meets green apple. Trace amounts of hops are evident in the scent as well. Taste is slightly bitter upfront but transforms to a very dry fruit character just like on the aroma. Pears and apples with minimal hop impact and a decent alcohol punch. Slight touch of sour apple in the finish with a unique slightly tart character. Warmth and taste of the alcohol lingers in the mouth. Medium feel with a moderately high level of carbonation. Overall a little confused by their take on the style. The acidic quality threw me for a loop along with the dryness instead of malt backing."
"First time having a non-barrel aged version of this beer (geez, that 3 year vertical last summer was great). Color is a deep clear mahogany with a two finger light tan head that is supported by a steady stream of bubbles and leaves nice lacing and has great retention. Aroma is mild, lacking any hops, primarily toasted malt, slight sweet and caramel, also some dark fruits. Flavor is predominantly toasted malt and plum, raisin and grape dark fruit bittersweetness. Some remnants of citrus hops in the finish, but very little hop or alcohol presence. Finish also has a mild lingering sourness. Medium-full bodied with very soft carbonation resulting in a chewy. Very complex and balanced, not an over the top hoppy barleywine, but recommended if you come across it."
"While I didn't find this to anything spectacular, it was still an easy to drink barlewine. My guess is that some short term againg would likely improve this beer considerably."
"4.5/4/4/3.5/4.5"
"Drinkability is decent. Above average for the style overall, but not great."
"M&D- Tame and easy, A nice strong medium bodied with faded carb making for a smooth sipper, although I drank mine a bit quick because it was easy for a barleywine. Not a huge ABV on this compared to other BW's making this much more approachable. Not the most complex beer but a quick drinker."
"Pours clear copper with microscopic tan head. The aroma is malty to caramel sweet to go along with some raisins, prunes and a mild level of pine hops. The taste is neutral to start and then moves into sweetness with sweet sugary malts, prunes, raisins and figs. It seems to thin out a bit by midway with more dark fruitiness and brown sugar. Tasty stuff."
"This barleywine has held up well over the years and it was easy drinking as far as the style goes. Nothing stands out on this one, but it's a well-balanced beer overall."
"D: It's a sipper. Not my favorite Barleywine."
"A decent flavor profile on this barleywine, with suggestions of creamed toffee & caramel, plum, vanilla, and a bitter finish of resinous hops. Mouthfeel is a bit on the thin side, but packs a nice carbonation level to complement its crisp, smooth body. Overall, a good interpretation of the English Barleywine style, and a beer I'd gladly have again."
"Overall a very good and different version of a barleywine. It's nice every now and then to have a barleywine that does not kill you with hops, this is one of them."
"Ah well. Better luck next time?"
"A good drinking barleywine I can't wait to try the oaked age one. Thanks again"
"D-Wonderful stuff amazing amount of hop character for a brew that is 3+ years old. I was pleased to share this one around the table with friends."
"D - Extremely smooth and drinkable for a barleywine. This one really aged quite nicely and still retained a lot of its hop character."
"Pours a cloudy redish orange color with foamy white head. Aroma of malt hops and lots of alcohol. Flavor is pretty well balance with a lot of bitter hops and a nice amount of malt to balance out the strong sweet alcohol presence."
"On tap at Blind Tiger. Deep hazy amber color with significant white head. After drinking Captain Lawrence Smoke from the Oak, an initial sniff and taste of this was very hoppy and floral. Once my palate re-adjusted, I thought this was a very well rounded barleywine with very strong malts, and lots of sweetness."
"Poured into my Corsendonk Christmas Ale glass, a nice golden amber color, very nice carbonation, nice one-finger fizzy off-white head, which leaves some sticky lacing behind. The nose is malty, nice little touch of figs, raisins, plums. The taste is slightly sweet at first, malty, with some nice notes of dark fruits. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a very nice English Style Barleywine, recommended."
"Overall I thought this was excellent, really a very nice effort here and one of the better aged barley wines I have had in a god long while. Wish I had access to more of this as it was really good and probably would have held up at least another year or so."
"Drinkability: Not the best barleywine out there, that's for sure. Some are more-ish, leaving you eager for the next sip. This keeps you sipping just to be finished with it."
"Slightly hazy, deep red colour with beige foam. Good head retention with a bit of lace. Hoppy aroma with grapefruit and citrus peel, oranges, toffee and lots of fig/raisin character. Moderate bitterness with citrusy hops throughout. Fruity flavour with caramel and toffee malts, mild alcohol, and a weird yeasty bite. Full bodied with light warmth and lowish carbonation. Pretty drinkable for a big beer."
"I was able to share this bottle with my best friend who was in town. This goes with my new years resolution to try more Barleywines because honestly, I really don't like the style. Ok on to the review. The beer pours a brownish amber with a huge off white head that dissipates into a thin layer around the outside of the glass. The smell is average. Nothing spectacular. There are hints of the malt backbone, but nothing really is overwhelming. Hints of raisins, pepper and wheat husks. The taste mirrors the smell unfortunately. The burnt grain husk taste is actually over powering the malt backbone to this beer. Also it kind of makes my tongue numb. The mouthfeel is full and think. Think a good Dimetapp in how it coats your mouth. I don't think I will seek this beer out again, but if you do like barleywines, give this baby a try. See if I am wrong and balance out my opinion of it."
"This beer was really not what I was expecting but was very nice. Flavors are very subtle compared to its American counterparts. Recommended if you have the 25 bucks to buy a bottle."
"Sorry to bring down the average on this one folks, but this is very odd for an english barleywine. this to me seem very american in style, and somewhat light even for that. Pours a deep ruby red with pretty good head that dissipates quickly. nose is weak hops with a good malty backbone. Taste is defenitey american barleywine, just seems toned down to me. decent smooth mouthfeel and very good drinkability, but lacking in flavor, especially when catagorized as english BW. Good beer for sure, just seems like a barleywine flavored session ale in taste. Excited to see if the barrel aged version is better."
"d: I'm usually good for one a night only, but I had two of these on two consecutive nights."
"NOTES: I seem to have rated this much lower than most. I wonder if this beer was contaminated."
"D - quite drinkable. very very smooth and pleasant which isn't always the case with a 750 of such a big beer."
"D: The abv is high and you can feel it mid-way through a dinner bottle. The grain flavors are strong and nicely define the ale. Good for a cold night."
"This is a great American Style Barleywine with an assertive hop presence that seems to come out even more on cask. Get this at the brewpub while you can."
"D - A fine cask ale w/ nice smoothness and easy to imbibe characteristices. The cask conditioning improved the flavor w/ subtleties over the oak barrel version for my taste."
"Wow. Good times, good times."
"Drinkability: This one is a bit boosy...beware."
"Past draft at Bocktown Beer and Grill, since the Burgh didn't receive any bottles I was thrilled to see this tap handle instead. Appears a cloudy ruby amber brown, and it forms with a large cream hued head that leaves thick lacing all around my chalice. Aromatics contain vanilla and oak notes with herbal pine and citrus fruit along with a mild spicy tartness that's kind of hard to nail down completely. Flavor is somewhat mild compared to other Barleywines out there, everything blended pretty well mild alcohol with a mix of ripe fruit and deep herbal citrus hop edges brings it all together no cloying malt sweetness but sturdy stand up caramel malt edges were nice. Mouthfeel is medium bodied not cloying or syrupy yet enough body to get it done, moderate carbonation allows this beer to flow well. Drinkability takes a few to get this beer after you get it though beware it's hard to stay away from good barleywine draft offering from the folks in Adamstown, PA."
"Drinkability: impressively drinkable for a barley wine. I had two pints and they went down almost too easy."
"A drinkable beer, though definitely a sipping beer. Good to finish off on a cold night"
"Mouthfeel is smooth with light syrup...the smoothest barleywine that I remember having, especially being this young. Overall, it's a nice tasting, slightly sweet brew with an oakiness that seems to take over the brew."
"Obviously the drinkability suffers from the high ABV and intense flavors."
"Cheers!"
