"O- over a year of cellering has produced a wonderful cherry/caramel forward sipper"
"I had the Irish Walker on Spanish Cedar and it was awesome. This is equally as wonderful."

"2014 release.  Pours a dark brown, just like a porter.  Normal head volume and retention, excellent lacing.  Dark fruit nose of plums, raisins and dates over a light note of alcohol.  As it warms, molasses is evident along with a caramel note..  Light full body with a nice creamy texture.  Slightly below normal carbonation, with a bit of effervescence in the finish, buttresses the body/texture.  The flavor profile is intense, very complex and reasonably balanced.  It begins with a burst of blended dark fruits that flow into a molasses sweetness.  In the middle, the molasses fades into a caramel note that is rather sweet and covers the alcohol that lurks underneath.  While reasonably covered, the alcohol still exhibits a slight astringency in the middle.  In the finish, alcohol dominates and leaves that nice burn at the back of the throat.  As it all fades away, it is a bit dry and prune notes are detected.  I'm not a big barley wine fan, but this one hits the outstanding mark."

"Probably the best Barleywine I've had. Very nice flavor & surprisingly smooth."

"Overall: This is a well made beer, by one of my favorite local brewers. I may have to grab a few more up to cellar, before they are gone again. One note they have just began the transition to 12/ 6 packs and they have changed the label style. Personally I kind of like the older labels. I noticed the Lindley Park, which was one of their more sought after beers had the wax omitted and I suspect the Event Horizon will too. This may be the last of the, shall I say “reserve” beers from them that has the wax coating around the cap. If that interests you, I doubt next years will have it! (4.5)"

"M: Many detected a medium body, but I detect both heavy body and thin body, varying in between sips"
""
"O: I really enjoyed Irish Walker and it makes me want to look through the cellar to find my other bottle (2011 vintage) and give it a try to see how long I should hang onto this in the future!"

"Overall: a good english barleywine, on the hoppier side for the style but in a good way. definetly a good value from what I hear it costs and a good year round big beer. it'd be a good beer to throw in the cellar and play around with."

"I thoroughly enjoy a good English style barleywine and Irish Walker is just that. The complexity is immense. The depth, staggering. The....Nevermind. It's good. Go get some!"

"This was a nice purchase from my trip to Asheville, NC, recommended by the good people at Appalachian Vintner. Drinking from an Old Hickory glass, at room temperature, the mouthfeel is somewhat creamy, and like a previous reviewer mentioned, has the woody, old ale quality. A little sweet, but definitely not overpowering. Personally I feel it is well balanced, and I very much enjoyed it. Definitely would buy it again if I get a chance to go to NC. Oh yeah, that blue wax covering the bottle top, is interesting, but perhaps a bit too thick for easy removal."
"Poured a reddish copper with two finger head and lace ring down glass. Boozy, alkie aroma with bourbon, wood, hint of vanilla, caramel/sugary goodiness and touches of dark fruits (mostly figs and toffee). Fuller bodied, chewey, pronounced alcohol bite with a touch of burn on backend, this is a slow sipper b/c it will hit you and hit hard. That being said, well balanced, not overpowering in any sense, love the dark fruit and sweetness that balances with the alcohol and wood for a quality barley wine. Would love to see how this ages so I guess I'm buying another bottle."

"o - overall, really great english barleywine. this sort of tows the line of old ale...really what i love about the english barleywine style. this is a keeper...would definitely have again."

"Smooth, full body with medium carbonation."

"A tasty beer, with nicely varied malt character. I like it, though some might find it overly sweet."

"O - A very roasty barleywine with a lot of good attributes but none that shine too bright. The metallic aftertaste takes its toll and oxidation is starting to creep in. I'm happy to have tried it but it wasn't exactly memorable."

"O - very good barleywine. hits all the classic notes of the style. something i would definitely like to have again and see how it develops overtime."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Good example of the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-This is a very mellow barley wine not overpowering with either the malts or the hops which is nice but nothing that really stands out and makes this beer unique."
""
"Nice, solid, enjoyable Barleywine, not phenomenal, but a nice beer to drink solo in an evening."
""
""
"Overall it does remind me of caramel but slightly burnt/too toasted at that. So it is good but not outstanding."
"Great decadent fruity flavors of fig, plum, and raisin. The alcohol add just enough heat to this, but in no way overpowers. Sweet candy-like flavors on the back end keep this balanced, and tone down the richness of it a bit. Bitterness is present, but again, subtlety is king. Definitely sets itself apart from the Americanized versions of this style. This was rich, tasty, and ever so easy to drink. I think I need to pull the trigger on some bottles now."
"O: I don't care what many others have said on here at all. I personally thought this was one of the best English BW's I've had in a long time."
""
""
""
"O: Starts out well but the aftertaste is kind of odd for a beer like this. Tasty enough but nothing earth-shattering. Lots of leather between sips become annoying, especially strong once it warms up."
""
"O- good Barleywine but nothing spectacular. After Saw this was a gusher I was worried about infection, but seems ok to me."
""
"Malty sweetness fades into booze and bourbon. More spice than I expected, spikes of alcohol keep things interesting. Unfortunately it doesn't all piece together as well as its competition. Slightly above average, but nothing special."
"I almost wonder if this was just not quite ""big"" enough for cellering much more than a year or so."
""
""
""
""
"Mucho points for the weirding, I've never had a barleywine like this before, & it's felony drinkable with that 10% ABV. Another winner from Olde Hickory, this is a very good beer."
"This is a solid barleywine. It has good flavor and very good balance. I really enjoyed this beer."
"It hits with a bang. The first thing my tongue was able to sort out was a solid dose of bitterness that locks into every tastebud well into the finish. A heavy dose of dark fruit complement the bitterness nicely. Definitely more balanced than the nose would suggest. Clean alcohols contribute to complexity. I also get some toffee notes as things settle down. This one defines a sipper. Really full, viscous mouthfeel, but even after a year, that bitterness is pretty upfront. Solid barleywine that will really develop well over the years. I have a 2012 that I think I will hold onto for much longer."
""
""
"Pours a clear brown with a foamy tan head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, brown sugar, molasses, and citrus zest. Taste is of malt, citrus zest, and slight brown sugar and molasses flavors. There is a medium sort of medicinal bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good barleywine but the bitterness is a bit weird on this one."
""
""
"M: The mouthfeel is a malt assault, syrupy and rich. I recommend splitting it with someone (or two)."
"A very enjoyable barleywine that I had no expectations of going into. A little too sweet once it warmed, but still enjoyable."
""
""
""
"A solid if unspectacular barleywine with little complexity but a nice sweet body with some fruity notes."
""
"I always look forward to the Irish Walker, this being the 2011 brew. The foam is medium brown and nice lacing durung the taste. The smell is malty with a hint of hops. The taste is full malt, slight sweetness, and some hoppiness with nice finish of alcohol. The feel is full of flavor and very good. Overall, as I said before I always look forward to an Irish Walker Barleywine by Olde Hickory."
"This was decent. The complexity seemed to be there but the flavors themselves just didn’t leave much of a bold impression on me, which coupled with the thinner feel of the body to make for a moderately enjoyable but ultimately forgettable drinking experience. This one seemed liked it’s spent enough time in the bottle already."
"The beer is very drinkable, but the flavor is not robust and in my opinion leaves a little to be desired. I enjoy the beer but was hoping for more. Give it a shot but dont expect to get wow'd."
"O- A great beer I find myself ordering again and again. Good job OHB. I have yet to enjoy aged I bet it will improve 10 fold."
""
"O: This is real good. Not overly complex, but crazy smooth and well balanced. The flavors work from start to finish with no single characteristic shoving its way to the forefront. I’d be happy to drink this again."
"smooth, full body, crisp, middle, lingering, bitter ends."
""
""
""

""
"O: nice flavorful English barleywine, a touch boozy, nice flavors"
" Rich tastes of oak and vanilla, hints of roasted malts and caramel. Lots of bourbon like flavors swirling around. Very tight and nicely done. A bit of alcohol, just enough to thicken it up a bit. A really nice and very full barley wine. Finish was strong, with a healthy dose of bourbon and spice lingering in the mouth for what seemed like forever."

"Overall a delicious English barleywine."

"Overall very nice, great fruits, hint of whisky and barrel, good sweetness and malts, balanced fairly well."
"Overall pretty tasty not a great but an enjoyable brew."
"O: Pretty good English Barleywine although not overly complex. I would drink this again but there are better out there."
"O- Sat on this one for a while and worth the wait. Not my hands down favorite English Barleywine but definately will be looking for this again"
"Pretty good all around. I like it now and I think it could hold up over time."
"Overall: Not a bad English Barleywine but it doesn't rock my socks off."
"Overall: This one kinda makes me think of an Imperial Irish Red Ale, though maybe I'm taking too much away from the word ""Irish"". Decent flavor, though the appearance and texture were quite nice."
"D - One is definitely enough."
"This was much better than I expected. It's sweet, but not overly sweet, and that sweetness keeps any hoppiness or alcohol well in check. Would love to drink this again."
"It's chewy. As is often the case for barleywines, you feel them more than you taste them. It's a malt-sided barleywine, so even new and fresh there's little bitterness. What can I say? I all too often want more hops! It's balanced, and its candied barleyness warms the gut. To its credit, the beer avoids ""chalky"" and ""chemical"" despite its big body and 10+ ABV. Tastes good and really feels even better. Overall, I'm pretty pleased!"
"3.5 D: The sweetness to bitterness balance is tilted heavily toward bitterness. This might have been the design for all I know though. I heard this ages well and would the strong bitterness now will prevent this from getting cloying down the road. Anyway, this is a decent drink fresh. I have another bottle, so I might check it out again a few years down the road."
"2011 Vintage! Served from tap into a flared pilsner. Poured a deep red-orange with a half finger off-white (slight light brown hue) that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, bitter hop, sweet alcohol, and caramel. The flavor was of sweet malt, dark chocolate, sweet alcohol, caramel, and bitter hop. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. The flavor profile on this one was quite nice and complex. With this being a barleywine, it had all of the flavors one would expect to find in one without a doubt. The aroma was quite nice as well for the style. Definitely worth trying if you have the chance!"
"Pours dark brown with a short tan head that quickly recedes to a thin collar. The nose brings some light whiskey character along with caramel and a bit of booze. Nothing much else than that. This is especially apparent in the flavor, which unfortunately tastes mostly like watered-down whiskey and doesn't have malt or other backing. Light to medium body without too much booze, which is fairly impressive. Decent enough overall, but I'd rather stick with some of their other beers."
"o - Overall I thought this was a really good barleywine and something I would love to have again sometime. Lots of caramel and vanilla, which are some of my favorite characteristics."
"This beer pours a deep brownish red murky colour with a decent sized fluffy white head. Average lacing with a few rings left behind. The nose is a heavy sweetness of caramel and candied sugar. This beer is not as sweet as the nose suggests. Nice dark fruit body (plums, raisins) with some accompanying hoppy bitterness (pine). The caramel and toffee sweetness is definitely still there but more of a supporting role. Well balanced beer with sticky mouthfeel. Overall I thought this was a good beer but it is still a touch hot as it is still 'young'. I would like to get another bottle and open it in 3 years or so..."
"A decent example of the style, but it won't get me to go rushing out to find more. If given the opportunity to get more, I would....just don't feel the need to search it out though."
"Butterscotch, caramel, a touch of toffee in the nose. Raisin-studded bread pudding comes to mind. A surpsing bitter streak cuts through the smoothish and coating blend of butterscotch, molasses, toffee and fruit. The hops are jacked to a surprising level; this is a beer that very well may respond well to aging. After the swallow, the bitterness calms down and the smoothness returns for the afterparty. Could stand to be a touch more warming, and perhaps with age it would be. Easy recommendation."
"Overall: So, a year older and with a 2% lower ABV, the 2009 is clearly the better beer 4.0"
"I like this a good deal. This has a nice full flavor to it. *edit: The ABV on our bottle says 9.6%, not 7.7%."
"Good feel here. A big full body with good carbonation. A little bit on the sticky side. Overall not a bad barely wine. I don't really feel like this one is doing anything super special, but it's enjoyable and well made."
"Pours a dark amber with a fingers of tan head.  Smells are dark fruits, sweet malts and a little alcohol.  Tastes are dark fruits, malts, really smooth and really mellow.  Mouthfeel is good, drinkability is high. Overall a really good beer I'd like to try again."
"D - This is quite a good barleywine. If I were feeling ambitious I could probably tackle a bomber on my own. Olde Hickory, please put this in a (PvW?) bourbon barrel as it'd be a big hit."
"Dark clouded chestnut color with a small, bubbly, creamy head. Aromas of bread, dark fruit, raisins, toffee, booze, and slight oxidation. Sweet caramel, ripe fruit, rich bitter chocolate, molasses, tobacco, vanilla, and a surprise balancing hop note. All very smooth and tasty with far less alcohol presence. Slick, creamy mouthfeel. Goes down easy!"
"Irish Walker is my first experience with Olde Hickory Brewery. I'm impressed. This is good stuff. It's a very balanced, approachable English Barleywine. The flavor is spot-on for the style. If you're into English Barleywines, you simply must check this one out. It's big on flavor, and hides its heft extremely well. This bomber is disappearing surprisingly fast. Easy recommendation. Thanks a ton, Dan!"
"A nice brew, a solid entry in a day of silly."
"P.S. I think it would be incredible bourbon barrel aged."
"Drinkability: Goes down easy enough, this is a good one that is headed in the right direction."
"2012 bomber consumed 01.2014, straight from the cellar: Very rich, lovely beer. Heavy on sweet toffee and brown sugar concentrations with a touch of dark, figgy fruit leather belied by the deep brown hue of the beer. dates. caramel. sticky, sweet, nice alcohol. hops provide a lingering bitterness. very nice after one year. straightforward complexity and very tasty. old scores were 4s"
"Another good beer from Olde Hickory, which is becoming one of my favorite ""local"" breweries."
"drinkability: good"
"D- This beer was a nice drinker. Nothing over the top but a nice darker fruit malty balanced barleywine. A refreshing take on a English style Barleywine. Would love to try this again. Alcohol heat was low and balanced the beer well."
"Wonderful malt heavy flavors of burnt toast, sweetness, cherries and peaches as in the nose. Chicory maybe. Hint of pine. With a bourbon finish. Very good beer. I wish I had bought more. Mouthfeel is smooth and full. Very easy to drink for a barleywine."
"The beer pours a red color with a white head. The aroma is brown sugar, molasses and roasted malt. The flavor is brown sugar, alcohol, chocolate, molasses, maple syrup and vanilla. A very complex, but still drinkable barleywine. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"While on the shorter end of the spectrum with its less than domineering level of alcohol, it is a damn good English Barleywine."
"D - This kind of grew on me after a bit. I was not a huge fan at first, but I re-capped the brew and had several pours over a two-day period and found it to be quite nice after a while."
"D-messy and slightly oxidized already, very singular with a dirty malt overload. not offensive but certainly not good."
"Notes: An interesting twist on the barley-wine style and unique for sure. It's a little cloying, though. Despite the dark chewy flavors there is a certain ""lifted"" quality to the beer which is great and helps keep it from being totally syrupy."
"this one turns into a sipper rather quickly, and not because of a heavy body or high alcohol content."
"2010 waxed bottle into a Hopus glass pours a crisp brown with a thin khaki head that diminishes to a ring and leaves slight lacing on the glass. Aroma is loads of burnt caramel, leather, dried fruits and a bit of charred wood. The taste is loads of dried fruits with some molasses and an interesting earthy hop finish. The beer is a bit on the heavy side, but smoother than I expected for a young 9.8% Barleywine. This is certainly an enjoyable beer, one I would love to pick up another bottle of for the cellar."
"This one kinf of surprised me. I've only tried the Imperial Stout from Olde Hickory and that was phenomenal. Now I try this one, which is not rated amazingly on BA, but this brew is really awesome. Definitely give this a try if you like big beers and barleywines. I think I want to try some more brews from OH now."
"It is one to sip."
"Drinkability is also good. I finished my glass without any problems and could have another."
"My bottle states a 9.8% ABV, this is well hidden. I like this better than the draft version I had last summer. This is a faithful take on the style that is working for me. I am digging the bigger bottled beers coming from NC hometown!"
"Pours a cloudy brown with a thin off white head. Aroma of molasses sweetness and slight dark fruits. Taste follows with a light sweetness and moderate spice. Pretty true to style in the taste department, but the mouth is way thin. Finishes fairlyclean for a Barleywine. Overall, a good interpretation of an English Barleywine, but a little too light to be called great."
"Enjoyable barleywine that might need a few months of age to tone down the heat."
"This is more like a Scotch Ale, but for a barleywine, it's just a ""B."" But B = Good! Too much of that metallic edge comes in, and probably too fruity-tart as well. But there's enough here to make it worth a try; there's a really good beer in here somewhere. And at 7.7%, it's not gonna totally lay you flat or anything."
"22 oz bottle. Poured a nice brown color with, good head and lacing. I have come to realize that I am not the bigest fan of barleywines because I think the smell and taste of alcohol stands out too much. However, I drank (sipped) this during the boring first half of the Super Bowl and I was pleasantly surprised. This was a great beer to just sit and enjoy during a long first half of a football game. I am not sure how much drinkability this one has because of the alcohol (even though it clocks in at 7.70 %). With that said, I would have another is given the chance, nice beer for the style."
"I highly recommend picking bottles of this up, but you have to get it from the brewery in Hickory. Well worth the trip up there."
"Poured into an oversized wine glass a rich deep amber with a clingy one finger slight off white head that left multiple layers of broken lace.Deep fruit in the nose, along with brown sugar and sweet alcohol.Its a bit hot being that its this years vitage,the flavors are deep in fruity malt,mainly raisin with big brown sugar,alcohol dripped plums.Its hot, but its a damn good sipper,I plan on getting one to let sit for awhile."
