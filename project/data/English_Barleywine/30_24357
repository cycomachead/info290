It is not a beer, and no way in hell is this a barley wine. It tastes like half the bottle is pancake syrup, it is so sweet. I split half a 12 oz. bottle with a friend and we both struggled to finish it. The 2014 brew clocks in at 14.8%, and for the exuberant amount of money they charge for this beer it is a huge let down.

This beer didn't have good drinkability, it wasn't the smoothest, it was warming, not crisp, syrupy, sticky, fairly cloying, filling and the taste did a nice job of holding my attention, but the sweetness didn't, half the bottle is the perfect amount for me, I might struggle to make it through a whole one just because of the sweetness.  What I like the most about this beer was the malty caramel flavors and the nice flavors and aromas that oak imparted.  What I liked the least about this beer was the sweetness it was just way to sweet for me.  I might buy this beer again and i think I would attempt to cellar one to see how it ages and if any of that sweetness fades away over time.  I would only recommend this to people who enjoy really sweet and really strong beers.  All in all I'm glad I tried this beer, but I didn't love it, I just found it to be pretty rough around the edges, but it did have some really nice flavors and aromas to it.  This isn't my favorite beer from or Avery or my favorite of the style, it falls in the middle in both aspects.  I appreciate the effort it took to make a big beer like this, but the super high sweetness just isn't for me, better luck next time guys.","StoutHunter","Dec 06, 2014"

While the sweetest beer I've ever tasted, I do enjoy the way the caramel and oak work together. The alcohol stays more well hidden than I figured it would, as each sip brings mostly the sweet plummy oak flavors, while the hops are less prominent. Syrupy. You may enjoy this to a point, as an after dinner sipper, if you can get past the cloying aspect.","TBoneJones","Jul 02, 2014"

There were hints of Oak in the taste and smell, but sadly, the turbinado sugar is what I tasted mostly. In fact, the whole thing tasted like sugar. too much sugar. this could have been good if they would just have toned down the sugar. I finished maybe a quarter of it and could not go one further. In fairness, I am sure some will really like this. For me, no. Still, in fairness, I couldn't give a flat out horrible rating. This beer is better than that.

I was wondering if it would mellow a bit sitting in the bottle for awhile?? otherwise, this is how I felt about it: appearance was standard without head but a pretty golden color. the aroma was fantastic but difficult to describe. the taste was not as fantastic, and was also difficult to describe aside from the alcohol. in a nutshell, this is a blast of alcohol and considering the taste of this young version, better to blast ya into buzzdom than to appreciate as a refined source of leisure. it definitely beats 4loco and I don't think there is a hangover associated with it like the 4loco...","pkalix","Feb 09, 2014"

4.24,9.3,3,4,4.5,4,4.5,"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass; batch 1, bottled in 2005. Pours moderately hazy/cloudy dark ruby red color with a minimal wisp of a head that reduces to nothing. Aromas of big raisin, prune, fig, plum, apple, pear, molasses, toffee, caramel, toast, brown bread, oak, light chocolate, vanilla, light clove, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with big complexity and great balance of malt, oak, and yeast ester notes; with big strength. Taste of huge raisin, fig, plum, prune, apple, pear, molasses, brown sugar, brown bread, caramel, toffee, vanilla, oak, light clove, toast, chocolate, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of raisin, prune, plum, fig, pear, apple, molasses, brown sugar, brown bread, caramel, toffee, chocolate, toast, oak, vanilla, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity and balance of big dense malt, fruity yeast, and oak flavors; with zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light carbonation and very full bodied; with a very creamy, slick, and moderately syrupy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome English barleywine. Big complexity and great balance of malt, yeast ester, and oak flavors; and quite smooth sip on slowly with no booziness. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jan 27, 2014"

Hopefully there are some left somewhere from the May release because I would like to grab another, so I don't have to wait another 5 months and lose out on that aging time. Very unique.

The finish is sweet caramel, vanilla, yeast and fruity flavors, some oak and vanilla tones, a bit of brown sugar. The ending is mildly spiced with some sweet alcohol.

3.91,0.8,4,3.5,4.25,3.75,3.75,"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was its taste. This is actually our first taste of the “Demon” series, and it certainly did not disappoint. Samael brought it hard to the palate with massive bready sweetness, nicely matched oakiness, and strong booziness through the end of the sip. While things may have not been the most balanced and concise, the more noticeable inclusions of leather, light smoke, and plastics were happily welcomed to the party, integrating pleasantly amongst the general strength and bigness of this beer. Things calm down quite a bit with warmth, through both the nose and the taste, helping to keep it much, much closer to style and approachable. This guy is monstrous, and considering the abv alone, you should definitely fight off the darkness with some friends, or you just might get swallowed up in it.","TheBrewo","May 07, 2013"

The hops and oak are a bit muted, possibly due to age, but I think it might also be due to the higher ABV. The heat may be masking some of the more subtle flavors at the finish. Nevertheless, it’s a tasty beer and very drinkable for one that clocks in at almost 15.5%. This is the last of the Demons of Ale that I’ve tasted, and I’m glad I had the chance to try them all.

There wasn’t any lacing left on the glass from the head. The body was a cloudy mahogany color with a lot of active carbonation, more than I was expecting actually. The nose was insanely strong and overpowered with oak. Other things that I got on the nose were toffee and vanilla and a crapload of booze. I have a feeling that this is going to knock me on my ass. The taste started with sweet toffee, then vanilla and then literally beat me in the face with oak and finished with a serious booze burn. The body was towards the thick and syrupy side with lighter carbonation than I expected. The finish was long with a lot of heat. Honestly, all this beer was to me was just really sweet, really oakey and really boozy. This was a bit of a disappointment, especially from a brewery that I love.

Smell is delicious. Sweet caramel, dark fruit, slight woodiness, vanilla, and general sweetness. Smell is similar to Backwoods Bastard, minus the bourbon. Taste is similar to nose, with oak a bit more, and dark fruit a bit less, pronounced. 15.31% ABV well=hidden. Mouthfeel is just slightly burning, and this is where the ABV is most noticeable. Syrup-like texture, but not too overbearing. Overall I like this beer quite a bit. I bought it about 6 months ago and its just been sitting there. Tonight I decided was the night.

Taste is initially VERY sweet...this beer tastes like creme-brule... very sweet and desert-like. Sweet dark fruits with some candy-like flavors. A ton of caramel and malt flavors with a nice warming sensation from the high ABV. For how high the ABV is, the booze is nowhere near overwhelming. Solid beer. Mouthfeel is full bodied and a bit on the syrupy side. Drinkability is scary for how high the ABV is. Overall, this is a very solid beer.

Leaves a gentle lacing, pretty viscous. Aroma was boozy but seemed pretty balanced. Taste was a lot of oak, and a lot of booze. Very slight hints of vanilla, cherry, and spice. It seems like the booze gets weaker as it warms, but hits again on the way down. Palate was surprisingly lively for an aged barlywine style. Lots of carbonation for it. Leaves a lingering flavor, mostly oak and alcohol though. Overall I am glad I tried it, but it’s not one of my favorites. There’s a lot going on and I’m not a fan of all of it. I don’t feel there’s enough balance to pull it off. Still very flavorful and I can see the allure to it.

A good looking glass of beer. The aroma is highly malty, toffee and caramel as well as a lot of dark fruits, an oaky port-like character is also evident. A very inviting nose. The flavor is a bit sherry-like, cherry and plum fruits, lots of toffee, abundant oak, pleasant flavor and warmth of alcohol. The finish is slightly dry, a prick of alcohol, oaky and warms the belly. The body is medium-full and carbonation also moderate. Overall a delicious, complex beer that was very enjoyable to slowly sip. At $8 / 12oz bottle, it was a great gift, certainly worth a try, but not something that fits into even a semi-routine budget.","uwmgdman","Jan 06, 2012"

The aroma is oak, sweet plum, raisin, caramel, brown sugar, molasses, and alcohol. You can definitely tell that this is a sweet, boozy beer. The initial taste is quite sweet with plum and raisin. Then comes oak, some light oxidation, rum, brown sugar, and caramel. The finish is quite boozy with a bit of bitterness. Medium-full body. Close to no carbonation. This beer is quite sweet and boozy, which is certainly not my favorite type of beer, but it is pretty decent for what it is.","jethrodium","Dec 28, 2011"

3.53,-9,3.5,3,4,3,3.5,"Samael's pours an opaque red-orange to mahogany, with just a light bit of cream colored head. The nose has some of the expected elements, but in the end falls a little dull. Specifically, it smells of caramel and vanilla, but the aroma is a bit weak, and could definitely stand to be a bit more varied. The taste though, is just that. In addition to the caramel and vanilla, the flavor profile is rounded off with notes of burnt sugar and alcohol soaked figs and other fruits. Especially that boozy fruit note jumps out with each sip, which I guess is to be somewhat expected given the high octane nature of the beer. Unlike the similarly big Mephaddict I just had, this one comes across as being a bit underattenuated. While the carbonation is dialed in nice and low for maximum maltiness, the body firmly crosses the line into being too sugar-syrupy. The result is that the beer has an almost cloying edge to it. I love me a good English Barleywine, but I think Avery might be served to dial down the intensity on Samael's a bit.","axeman9182","Dec 05, 2011"

4.35,12.1,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"O: Overall, very tasty, also unusual. It has a moderate sherry-like component to it, and also, at about 15% abv, it's pretty intense for a beer. This particular bottle probably would have benefited from another 1-2 years of aging at ideal conditions (not that it was aged in ideal conditions at any point in this case). Still, though, there was a significant amount of oxidation aromas and flavors present in the beer.

2.03,-47.7,3,2.5,1.5,2.5,2,"Taste is strong, bad fermented toffee with a hint of woody whisky quality. It is soon evident that it is sickly sweet yet with a hot, strong alcoholic boozy character, rough, sharp, one-dimensional, and unpleasant. This has a couple traits that are really intense, without anything else, and goes for sheer strength over any semblance of quality, complexity, or the like. I know the ABV is high, but I've had several that are very close to this and are far smoother, less obviously boozy, and have complexixty and character, rather than simply hot, sweet, rough alcohol. It is a total dud.","Offa","Apr 21, 2011"

I'm not overly concerned about this given that the bottle I'm drinking is two years old and that the abv is so high. Smells extremely sweet, like malt candy. I don't mind some sweetness, but this is ridiculous! The taste is also quite sweet, but there is, fortunately, some zingy citrus and apple as well a bit of spice, and some creamy custard . Really, the taste is quite nice if you can deal with a sweeter beer. The mouthfeel is silky, and after two years in the bottle, the only heat I felt was from the first sip I had after the pour. After it opens and warms it is actually quite mellow and drinkable. Also, I'm pleased to note that no sherry notes have crept in. After cellaring for years, I've come to dislike that particular flavor and had thought of giving it up- except that with the right beer, like this one and innumerable sours the result is quite pleasant.","Georgiabeer","Apr 20, 2011"

The nose comprises buttery toffee, vanilla, oak, caramel, and a small touch of booze in the back, though that remains decidedly demure. The taste holds notes of harshly sweet toffee, light whiskey, caramel, and maple syrup. The sweetness is a bit annoying, but at least it's not o'erwhelming. The body is lightly hefty, with a very light moderate carbonation and a syrupy feel. Overall, a pretty decent b-wine, but too sweet for my liking.

There is really no alcohol aroma behind the beer, but that doesn't mean that this beer isn't strong. The taste of this beer greatly follows the nose in almost every way except there is a residual vanilla taste that comes from the oak. The mouthfeel is sticky and cloying along with the buttery mouthfeel I could honestly do without. This beer I sipped and still got buzzed, so it's drinkability is highly questionable.

Lees. No hops present in this one. Maybe even some small hints of chocolate malt to this. Overall an aroma leaning towards some dark nutty, earthy notes. Very thick, syrupy mouthfeel. Sits very heavy. Low carbonation. Rich in flavor as well, packed with caramel, pete notes, dark fruit, some chocolate. Finish with warmth leans towards the alcohol content, slightly medicinal.

The nose makes you think Willy Wonka is in the house, vanilla fudge, caramel, milk chocolate, butterscotch, coconut, licorice, nuts, the pear, peach, yellow apple, cherry scents close to dried fruit in nature, somehow manages to develop and erect posture in the complete absence of hops or anything which might keep its knuckles off the ground. Full-bodied, the carbonation is close to zip, this said, it does have more fluidity than expected and is just shifty enough that you can ignore how boozy or hot it is. Sweet plum, cherry, apricot, pear fruit, when paired with all that vanilla, caramel, butterscotch it kinda becomes hard to take it seriously as a ""nuanced"" beer.

Drank from a snifter slightly cold (my mistake) but would probably have been even better just at cellar temperature.

First taste is strong but not overly strong with a slight roasted flavor and an alcohol back end. Good mouthfeel as it doesn't overwhelm it as I expected it being 16.45%. Drinkability is a strong ale with a strong alcohol back end. Would be a good winter beer on a cold day or night. This is a take your time and drink beer.

The aroma was of alcohol esters and heat, oak, ripe fruit and doughy malt. The flavors were very rich and sweet. The alcohol was also quite strong. Caramel malt kicked the door in with brown sugar, vanilla and oak in the middle. Fruity esters and candy sugar were in there too. I generally like sweeter beers but I kept feeling this one was truly cloying. The body was medium/full, the mouthfeel average and the carbonation apropos for the style.

Has a nice creamy tan head and dark brown cloudy body. There's little bits of yeast sediment in it and probably due to the age, this bottle was sealed in april '07. Smell is very malty, little alcohol notes in there with some oak flavor. Malts are thick and that of sweet raisens and dates. Flavor is great, tons of malts and sweet fruits. Alcohol comes in mid way through but the sweet malts and little spiceyness comes in to counter it quickly. Love this beer, one of my favorites!","chaz410","Jan 04, 2009"

It actually smells quite inviting. The flavor is rich heavy fermented fruits, dates, big malt and maple. It seems the appearance gets better as it warms. Giving it a little swirl creates a head and sticky lacing. I have a habit of drinking my beers too quickly but I think this one is going to last me for quite some time. Very nice overall.

Problem is it only enhances the overly sweet caramel-malt of this brew. The alcohol came out as the beer warmed, making this sticky-sweet syrup that became undrinkable.

Unbelievable sweet malt taste that knocks you on your ass and there seems to be some floral hops to punctuate a vivid thickness of this beer and give it a slightly hoppy backend. Despite the high ABV the alcohol burn isn't too bad, but this is only a sipper and I still couldn't finish it all.

It tasted like powerful and sweet apricot and raisin hops, fresh cut oak, super sugary caramel, and blatant alcohol. It was somewhat thick with a bit of carbonation, and had a strong and lasting bittersweet aftertaste. Overall this was a very unique and bold ale, that drank almost like a cordial. It was fairly complex, but was still clean. It's overwhelming sweetness was reminiscent of the 120 Minute IPA, meaning this beer must be sipped, and it's difficult to finish an entire bottle.","Pencible","Aug 09, 2008"

Dangerously drinkable, not at all syrupy (the way some beers of this strength seem to coat your mouth), no warming sensation on the way down like you might expect, perfect level of bitterness, seemingly more from the roast on the malt rather than a pronounced hop presence. Some Braunschweiger and toasted rye would be fantastic with this.","nkurz129","Feb 08, 2008"

The taste is extremely powerful, rich, thick, creamy, cloying and really sweet... Strangely, I didn't taste the alcohol that I was anticipating - just an extremely sweet - to the point of being unbearable - flavor that stuck to the mouth... this one is certainly a sipper - one that should be sampled over a period of time... it's so strong that you could probably split this 12oz bottle with two or three people... In terms of flavor, this beer is really extreme... the mouthfeel was very thick and ultra-sweet... With respect to appearance, this pours a dark, copper color with minimal head...

There is a good blend of oak, vanilla, caramel and a nice but sharp pine hoppiness provides the best backbone it can for all that malt. The beer is very heavy on the palate and very sweet.

On the palate, initially just a touch acidic and fruity (the mango again comes to the fore, along with some apricots) before growing sweeter and sweeter through the finish, which stays sharply and cloyingly sweet. It's not my favorite part of this beer. There's a burst of fruit and raw alcohol at the end. Substantial carbonation throughout the palate, which is kind of surprising given the style. Overall, this is rather good. I'm surprised I liked it as much as I did... the vanilla oakiness wasn't too overbearing, as it was attenuated by some fruit.

I had to cover the glass with my hand and inhale deeply to get all these nuances. Not a fill the room nose. The same cannot be said for the taste, which I can say right off the bat would benefit from some serious aging. This is huge, real big. Tremendous amount of malt and sweet raisins. Everything fromt he nose is here, along with some pine, a little smokyness, and cherry. As you drink this, the red wine notes in the nose fill your nose, and take center stage there.

Rich feel to it. Some fruitiness underneath all the sweets. Candied plums and tropical varieties come to mind. On the palate, it's sweet up front, but not cloying as I feared. It's very rich overall. The finish brings a little heat, but again, not as much as I was expecting. This beer is put together pretty nicely. It's got lots of those tropical fruits dancing around. Like pineapples and mango and maybe some papaya. And even a ghostly coconut presence. Cherry and nougat and oak strike as well. The beer has a nice bit of carbonation to it to prevent a syrupy mouthfeel. Body is checking in around medium. Maybe medium-full.

Perhaps even taking small sips out of a shotglass is appropriate. All I could do was take small sips and let the flavor soak in. I recommend starting out at a temperature of 40-45 degrees, as this will take a while to enjoy. I feel if it gets too warm, the alcohol may become too overpowering and turn a great beer into paint thinner flavored soda. Don't be intimidated by this Barley Wine's high alcohol by volume, as the complexity makes up for it.

Shy with the hops, this Barley Wine ascends the style in which it is characterized. Very sweet, syrupy, and oily looking right from the offset. With a deep mohogany hue and a stark white head, it promises intense sweetness and richness. Aromas of sweet brandy-like alcohols, swirled around toffee, caramel, vanilla, rum, and bourbon (I think it is the oak). Tastes even sweeter than is suggested by the aromas. A follow up of rum-soaken cherries, berries, maple syrup, and heavy, heavy malts. Not teeth-hurting sweet, but close. High fruit-cake flavors with the dehydrated old fruits and sugar drenched breads. Heavy and sweet on the mouth. This one is surely a sipper. Very warming without fusals and with a sweet alcohol / oily feel. Finishes like a lot of dark rums and tawny ports that I have drank.

Very malty and sugary. It can get a little cloying, and could be a little more balanced. Still, its a solidly strong and enjoyable flavor. Againnothing subtle here. Full and thick mouthfeel.

Unfortunately, had no glassware, so had to resort to a plastic cup in the room so I won't be talking about the head or appearance too much. This was a pleasant suprise - smell alternated between a sweet, malty beer to a jack and coke. Wasn't sure what to expect, but taste was delicious - complex, molasses with hints of plums, cherries and raisins - subtly arriving at the back of the tongue and warming quickly with the alcohol. Yes, the alcohol is present but it really didn't seem to be overpowering even at 14.5abv.

There is also some fruit aromas, cherry-apple cider like qualities. Taste shows incredibly sweet maltiness, caramel and toffee flavors, prunes and grapes, and a nice spicy alcohol finish that is nice and warming. Medium to heavy in body, there is some serious alcohol in this one and it is pretty assertive in the aroma and taste but in a good way imo.

Even some lighter, sweeter fruity flavors as it warms, reminded me a bit of white grapes. Eventhough it's at 14.5% alcohol, it really isn't more noticable than other beers that are around 8 or 9%. The mouthfeel is definitely sticky and a bit cloying, but not too bad for how sweet the beer is. This beer would probably benefit from a year or two of cellaring.

The taste was of mostly sweet caramel malt and vanilla, with more whiskey like qualaties than in the smell. There is only a light amount of carbonation which makes this beer seem very thick. The oak only comes into play a tiny bit as it is drowned out by the heavy dose of alcohol. The flavors seem to be rough around the edges with some of the sweetness needing just as much mellowing as the whiskey. All in all this is one to sit on for a few years.

Maybe the Batch #2 is not as harsh as the Batch 1; but it could still do with some time in the bottle I think.

Flavor has a distracting alcoholic bite, not as much raw kerosene as the Beast, but a little heavy-going. Vanilla continues in the taste, charred on-a-grill fruits (nectarines, golden delicious apples), lots of residual sugars. Hops don't come into play. I never really think these types of beer are close to bourbon, but the alcohol is very apparent in the finish and in the stomach, taking away from the next sip and the second half of the flavor profile.","ADR","Jul 15, 2006"

The flavor is equally intense as the aroma; notes of caramel and single malt scotch prevail, as well as dark fruits (cherries, plums, figs, grapes), oak and vanilla, slight mineraly hops, and of course alcohol.

Through the syrupy sticky sweetness the strong alcohol still manages to come through and provide a burn on the way down. Too much sweetness with only boozy notes to counter it. Pretty damn thick as expected but way to sticky and too much burning warmth. Drinkability was just about non existent as I slowly drank the 12 once bottled over a few hours.

Intense aromas were present, filled with strong alcohol, berry and malty tones all mixed together. It was a little intimidating to sip but the nose provides ample warning as to the flavors in which you will find, all of which are very intense. It was very sweet and malty with a bit of blueberry hidden underneath I think. The mouthfeel is immense with very light carbonation to make this brew smooth and easy to swallow. This is definitely not for the novice beer consumer, although it reminds me of a port a bit. At 14.5%ABV its not something to mess around with; I had to sip on this guy for a while.

Nose is very sweet, somewhat like vanilla, with a fairly assertive bourbonlike alcohol note. Taste is also more sweetness, thick syrupy molasses-like, with nice flavors of oak, vanilla, almond, some slight fruit and a slight bourbony finish. Very nice and flavorful, borderline cloying on the sweetness, but never quite getting too much. For how high octane and sweet it is, this really is amazingly drinkable. I just sipped it alone, but it would also go great with some cheese or even desert.","cubedbee","Dec 14, 2005"

Nose here is of some fresh fruits and then mostly fusil alcohol and some paint thinner/varnish type of odor. This stuff smells strong! I consumed this at about room temperature. Very flavorful and obviously stong beer. Notes of vanilla, sherry, port, oak, leather, minty freshness and glowing, warming alcohol. Wow, what a brew. This will be over the top for many, and too sweet for others, but I found it to be a potent late night sipper, would be fine with some stinky cheese, pepperoni, nuts, dark bread or with a decadent dessert.

3.82,-1.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"12oz bottle served in a Kentucky Bourbon Barrel Ale snifter. Body is a slightly hazed, copper amber color with a small beige head that quickly disappears without lacing. Aroma is fusel and phenolic, with aggressive notes of brandy and bourbon. Cotton candy notes from the turbanado sugars. Overripe peaches and apricots, drenched in brandy. A mild accent of vanilla, and just a hint of char and oak. Mouthfeel has a medium body and low carbonation. Warming alcohol is inescapable. Taste has sweet vinous notes and an assertive alcohol warmth. Nice array of fruits, with baked raisins, stewed apples, and overripe apricots. Some apricot nectar infused with sherry. Huge and powerful, and intended to be so. Nothing subtle here. Very over the top, but not overwrought like the 2004 Beast. Quite drinkable, actually, but watch your step. Avery made a wise move by releasing this in the smaller bottles. A bomber of this would be a bit too heavy for just one person. Thick and syrupy, and big alcohol with a solid fruit component await you here. This is the ""Mini Beast"".","merlin48","Sep 14, 2005"

3.9,0.5,4,4,4,4,3.5,"This beer is a brilliantly clear, copper-amber color and, despite a fair amount of carbonation, only has a wispy thin tan head. The aroma is thick and concentrated with notes of port, brandy, alcohol, cherries, cinnamon and sundry other spicy notes, and a hint of buttery-vanilla oak. The beer is quite sweet and fruity, I get notes of cherries and tart grapes, very much in a brandy sort of fashion. The oak is quite subtle, and hits with a hint of buttery, tannic wood in the finish; what a great use of oak, it really is playing a minor supporting role here, just like it should. This is a lot more drinkable than I was expecting, it is certainly a sipper though, as it is quite thick and viscous. But it is pretty tasty for a high octane brew, and is infinitely more refined than the beast. There is a certain amount of hot alcohol in the finish but it is held in check by the fruity sweet notes that dominate this beer. This beer is really quite sweet, though the stickiness is held in check by the high alcohol, which helps to reduce the viscosity.","Gueuzedude","Jul 07, 2005"

I really do like it. I actually can't stop smelling this one. Time for a taste. I get big caramel and brown sugary sweetness along with the sweet cherry...reminds me of a sherry I had recently almost. Things fade to very light woody tanin on the finish. Really just a hint of the alcohol in the middle, but not offensive. Very nice; maybe a touch too sweet. The feel is thick and syrupy. It doesn't stick and oat too much, but hangs just long enough.

The alcohol strangely doesn't make itself known until the warming effect sets in. Very little alcohol in the flavor. Very smooth. The body is on the thick end of moderate and it is supremely drinkable for the alcohol. This is a very dangerous beer.
