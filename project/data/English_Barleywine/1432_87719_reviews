"O: Nice variant of the original. The bourbon really adds some nice layers of complexity that compliment the base beer well. Balance is better as a result. Heavy, malty and sweet. Pretty much what you'd expect from a good bourbon barrel english barleywine."
"375 ml bottle into snifter, 2014 vintage bottling. Pours hazy opaque dark brown color with a 1 finger dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings around the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of big raisin, plum, caramel, toffee, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, coconut, butterscotch, vanilla, bourbon, oak, light chocolate, and oak/toasted earthiness. Incredible aromas with fantastic complexity and balance of dark/bready malt and bourbon barrel notes; with great strength. Taste of big raisin, plum, caramel, toffee, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, coconut, butterscotch, bourbon, oak, light chocolate, and oak/toasted earthiness. Light oak bitterness and bourbon spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, plum, caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, brown bread, coconut, butterscotch, bourbon, oak, light chocolate, and oak/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Absolutely insane complexity and perfect balance of dark/bready malt and bourbon barrel flavors; with an awesome malt/barrel spice balance zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very smooth, creamy, and fairly slick mouthfeel that is incredible. Alcohol is well hidden with a light-moderate warmth lingering after the finish; but not boozy at all. Overall this is a world class BA English Barelywine style. Pretty much perfect balance and complexity of dark/bready malt and bourbon barrel flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. An absolutely mind blowing offering all around."

"t/m/o - what a pleasant treat.  the flavrs really pop with big chewy caramel doused in booe, but not overly boozed up...adds a heavy element of chocolate decadence.  definitely heavy on the barrel, but it works.  this is top notch, reminds me of kuhnhenn's BA brews.  very worthwhile."

"This is the rare beer that improves significantly with the barrel, usually boring in, boring out. The barrel here seems to have added some much-needed woohoo. Woo-fucking-hoo. Still not great, but exceeding expectations, this is a good brew. Goodwoohoogood!"

"Awesome Barleywine that is even better once it's been aged in bourbon barrels."
"Thanks, howopeeps, for the opportunity"
"The bourbon greatly increases the aroma and flavor of this beer. I just had the Brick Kiln, and this is an amazing transformation. The barrel aging takes a good beer to greatness."
"On par with BCBS imo."

"Pours to a deep dark blackish brown body.  Nose is a fluffy inch and a half of milk chocolate brown head.  Very elegant and sexy in the glass.  Nose is a gorgeous rich smell full of sweet bourbon notes and tones of carmel and toffee dancing together in a perfect aroma symphony.  The nose of so luscious, I hope the taste stands up to it.  Enters into the mouth with smooth and silky feel.  Carmel and bourbon are meet with a lingering hop character that shows this was a hoppy Barley-wine to start.  Lovely and rich in flavor with tons of sweetness and toffee that really define this beer.  There is a nice dryness to the finish of this brew that does well to add a proper element of balance to the beer."

"Finally getting around to trying this one, and man was I in for a treat! Waited til it warmed a little to get the true bourbon barrel character, and barrel-aged it was. Lots of dessert-like sweetness in the malt, with burnt sugar, toasted coconut, caramel, and the definite bourbon and oak that was dominant throughout. Tons of bourbon barrel in this one. An amazing beer, just wish the price tag hadn't been so steep. So glad I tried it though! Another great beer by Jackie O's."

"This is THE english-style barleywine in my book. Phenomenal."
""
"This is one of those rare beers that would be perfectly content to be poured over a dish of vanilla ice cream. It is easily in the top 3 of all the bourbon-barrel-aged English barleywines I've had, ranking only slightly behind BCBBW and Sucaba and only because it lacks some of the complexities of flavor of those beers. A beautiful beer from Jackie O's that I thoroughly enjoyed."

"O: This is one of the single most bourbony barrel-aged beers I've tried, with an aftertaste of alcohol that has some of the sting and burn of sipping directly on a couple fingers of whiskey neat. While barleywines by and large are boozy things, this takes the booziest award by far. It would probably do well with a year or two in the cellar."

"Really enjoyed this BBBW.  Right up there with the BC and  Kuhnhenns flavor level.  Not ""right there"" but close.  Kinda expensive but worth it I think."

"12.7 ounce bottle, 2014 vintage.  Served in a snifter, the beer pours a dark brown color with about a half inch off-white head.  Head retention is decent, and there's a good amount of lacing.  Aroma is nice, the brew smells like vanilla, bourbon, caramel, toffee, brown sugar and dark fruit.  I think the taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also the addition of some wood, molasses and dark bread.  Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's syrupy and coating with low/moderate carbonation.  It's a pretty tasty brew, might have to pick up some more of this!  It was either $11.99 or $12.99 a bottle, I forget which.  Regardless of the price, it's worth trying at least once."

"This beer has a sturdy feel in its full body  with good movement, some alcohol coming in but remaining smooth and crisp with just enough carbonation to make it flow without being overdone"
"Bourbon doesn't add much on top of the normal version"
""

"Very smooth beer. A bit heavy on the sweet edge with a maple kind of thing going on. Vanilla seems to be there also. Probably could use some age to round things out. But it's a nice beer. Glad I picked it up."
""

"Overall: very complex and changes well as it warms. quite a remarkable beer. I will certainly be picking up a couple more of these to age (if i can find them again)."

"O - The taste didn't live up to the smell, but that doesn't mean it is bad. I thought I was diving into a Sucaba when I stuck my nose in it. I think the bourbon flavor, while very good, is just a hair on the hot side like BB Dark Apparition. To me, that is the only difference between this beer and the elite bourbon barrel barleys. It just isnt as smooth and balanced as a Sucaba or Bourbon County, or even their own Black Maple for example. Still, an outstanding beer. They continue to roll out one great barrel aged beer after another."

"Overall a very nice BA barleywine.  Price point a bit extravagant, but to me, worth it for this nice, cold weather sipper."

"A smooth bourbon barrel-aged Barleywine. The whiskey and vanilla oak works well with the malty base beer."
""
""
"First offering from Jackie O's and I really quite enjoyed it. Barley wines are a delicate style for me, and can be pretty hit or miss. This was definitely more on the ""hit"" side. I actually enjoyed it more than the AleSmith BA Old Numbskull - the big ol' ""popular"" and highly acclaimed BA barley wine that I was expecting to like more. Like settling for the slightly less appealing assistant captain cheerleader then finding out her parents are millionaires."

"Pours a clear brown with a foamy bone head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, brown sugar, caramel, bourbon, and wood aromas. Taste is much the same with bourbon and wood flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of woody bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with a nice bourbon presence in the aroma and flavor."

"Overall - It's Jackie O's and it's not sour! Yay! Very nice barleywine. Excellent barrel character."
""
""

"There is more caramel and vanilla in this one than there was in the rum version. I love the sweet caramel notes and thought the beer was quite smooth. There is more bitterness in the finish and less fruit notes than the rum. I'd have more in the future."

"Chestnut brown with a khaki, filmy head that leaves sheets of tan lace on the glass. The nose is really nice, toasted caramel malt. oak and whiskey in perfect harmony. The first sip tells me that this is a really well made and tasty beer. Caramel and toasted oak, vanilla and bourbon with some alcoholic heat and faint tannins. I feel the heat in my chest more than on my palate. Silky smooth, mildly carbonated and a little sticky. This beer is awesome fresh and will only get more polished with age."

"D - A very solid and well-crafted barrel-aged barleywine. Surprisingly mature and restrained for Brad and co. and I dig it. Hopefully this is scheduled for the December release, as I think it's ready for prime time. Would happily drink again."
