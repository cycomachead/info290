"not overpowering.  Sweet but not syrupy and with a smooth creamy feel on the tongue."
"Excellent aroma. Plenty of toffee and burnt sugar in the nose."

"2013 version. Little to no head. Little lacing. Toffee, sweet, bourbon barrel flavor. I remember this one having a fuller body"
""
""
""
""
"Don't see why others are so high on this.  Very average barrel-aged barley wine across the board, IMO."
""
""
"Overall. Great stuff that's everything a BA barleywine should be without excessive anything."

"I expect sweetness from a barleywine and sweetness from the bourbon barrel aging but this is a bit much for me.  Very sweet with an almost syrupy characteristic beyond what I would ever want.  Very sad about this as I really like their vanilla porter.  Pours a hazy red-orange.  Smells of bourbon, sweet malts and booze.  Dominant sweet bourbon flavor, caramel, sweet malts.  Sweet heavy body with med/light carbonation.  Not as obnoxiously sweet as it warmed but still too much for me."

"Verdict: A very delicious bourbon barrel aged barleywine from Dry Dock, definitely up there in the pantheon for this style, and definitely an ""underrated"" beer, although the ratings seem to indicate it's quality, so perhaps it's a ""under-known"" beer that isn't as heralded as the rest. Perfect for a fall or winter evening to sip on, delicious."

"Not a whole lot of barrel character but I get dark fruits, caramel, brown sugar, candy, and toffee."

"O- Really good English barleywine. I enjoyed drinking this one a lot and so did everyone else. However, for an barrel-aged English barleywine, this beer lacks a lot of the distinct whiskey character that makes a BA English barleywine what it is."

"0- very very good. Probably shouldn't age longer than a year. It's not showing any oxidation, just thinnish and lacking carbonation. Flavor is beautiful , ala JW Lees"
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel/Overall: Medium mouthfeel, which seems about right, but almost devoid of carbonation. Certainly a miss there. Overall, some very nice flavors and a good base beer, but for me the lack of carbonation really retracts from most of the other aspects. Add a bit of carbonation and I like it a lot more."

"Overall: no booze detected, drinkability is great. A super smooth barley wine that isn't too sweet or heavy on the barrel."
""
""
""

""

"Now I understand why this beer underwhelmed against the likes of Mother of All Storms, King Henry, & other heavyweights: a pretty good barrel-aged barleywine, but just not in the same weight class."
"Pours murky brown/amber in color with a razor thin off-white head that diminished fairly quickly. Big toffee, caramel, light coconut, a hint of vanilla, somewhat nutty, figs, raisins, spicy oak, and almonds in the aroma. Taste is big figs, dark fruits, with a touch of spice, hints of cinnamon, and coconut through the middle, with lighter notes of sweet caramel and brown sugar, ending with a light alcoholic bite on the backend. Slick mouthfeel with almost no carbonation throughout. Overall, a very solid barleywine that was not overpowered by the barrel treatment, This was too tough for me to come by to seek this out again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I like this beer quite a bit. I don't know what it is, so I can't say if I've had it before, but age has clearly treated it kindly. It's not terribly complex, but what is there is quality."

"O - Really good and sweet barleywine with nice chocolate flavor to it as well. Not as good as KH but pretty close"
""
""
""

"True to form, with a very subtle barrel-aged twist. I really enjoyed this one. Get it if you can!"
""
"Overall: A very nice English style barleywine that is drinking magnificently almost two years in"
""
""
""
"O: Pretty good for a barleywine, barrel does a nice job. Was better when I had it alone than at a barleywine tasting, but I think that was simply due some of the other beers in the line up."
""
"Dry dock copied Anchor Old foghorn on the color, just perfect for the style. Ok when you look up malt bomb in your text books this is what you will see. Sweet sweet sugar plums with a hint of pancake syrup, really nice nose this is an English Barleywine. Taste just like the nose with minimal alcohol burn. I will save an ounce and half for pancakes in the morning . Outstanding job and I hope the 2012 version holds up to these standards. My Dad would be proud of this beer."

"What a fantastic beer. Barrel aged beers are becoming more and more prevalent but it's still very rare to find one as well done as this. One of the best beers of this style."

"Overall a letdown, glad to have tried it on a random Sunday night watching the Walking Dead with my brother; otherwise I'd have been more disappointed. Still glad to tick it off the list of BA barleywines."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Dry Dock definitely has created a strong offering in the barleywine category."
""
""
"A deep ruby-brown pour with a foamy tan head that receded to a ringlet and left some doily lacing on the glass. Aroma of sweet malts, oak, fruity esters, booze. Taste of caramel malts, toffee, [vegetal] vanilla bean, toasted oak soaked in whiskey, dark dried fruits, leather. Tasty and complex, heavy-medium body, a bit chewy, and almost more reminiscent of an American than an English barleywine, but who's really keeping track? Very nice overall."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Brown to dark brown color. What little head there was disappeared quickly. Aroma of baking bread and prunes with a hint of acetone. Medium-heavy body with sufficient carbonation to say ""Beer"" and not port (which it is very reminiscent of). Vanilla, dried apricots, and soft caramel candy flavors. Feels like 10% but doesn't taste like it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall a very worthy beer, definitely worth seeking out."
""
"Low B"
""
"A fine beer. I'll have to re-try this one to if the feel is more than just in one bottle."
""
""
"O - thankfully I've got a few more of these...this is one of those beers that will get much better with time; it's boozy, delicious; plenty of flavors here with the right amount of whiskey and oak present; great barleywine"
"O: Pretty good. I have to admit I expected more and am a bit disappointed for what I spent. Not worth seeking out to me, but worth picking up a bottle if you happen to find it."
""
""
""
""
""
"I'd say this is in the bottom portion of the top tier of BA English Barleywines. I had a hard time describing the taste because this is nearly a one-trick pony with its whiskey notes. Combined with the nose and mouthfeel though, overall this is a great beer. Thanks 4DAloveofSTOUT for the trade a long time ago!"
""
"OVERALL: This is solid, solid stuff. The taste is the most impressive part of the beer, but if the nose were a little bolder and the feel slightly smoother, this would be a top class beer. As it is now, it's very enjoyable and is definitely worth the hunt if you're a fan of the style. Thanks again for the beers Masterski."
""
"O- very good Barleywine. Thick mouthfeel covers up the slight abv burn this beer still has. Not in the top tier of BA barleywines but close."
""
""
"Delicious, though I prefer the Kuhnhenn BBBW."
"O: While I certainly like this I had this side by side with King Henry and had Hi-Fi Rye a little afterwards. This just didn't hold up to the big guys IMO."
""
"O: Just excellent - all the flavors are very smoothly integrated. Barrel-aging should always be done like this. A pleasure to drink."
"O: One of the better BA barleywines I’ve encountered. Very rich but so easy to sip on. Thanks again, Exiled."
"O - this beer right here, it's really good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, incredibly flavorful brew with tremendous depth and oh so smooth! Glad I have another bottle of this big dog in my favorite style category. Not sure how this one got slightly overlooked and King Henry took center stage."
"O - My small pour was the perfect amount to enjoy this beer. Hard to really drink a bunch of this stuff (as with more BW's), but it's really coming a long nicely from when I had it fresh. I would say hold your bottles unless you really like a lot of booze in your BW's. In the very near future, this will be an amazing beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - So, very tasty. The carmel flavors really dominated and I really loved it."
""
""
"wow. very impressive. drinks very smooth, but has the complexity and power present to make this a contemplative sipper. will definitely seek out more of this."
""
"O: One of the finest barleywines I have had. Right there with KH, MoAS, and Sucaba. Really balanced and easy drinking. Not sickeningly sweet or loaded with fruit, but the barrel, caramel, toffee, and marshmallow flavors are amazing. I think its decidedly different in that regard from most of the other top examples of this style. Outstanding."
"O - A very nice barrel aged barleywine, all tho I have had better. I would like to try this one once the booze dies down a little more, I think it will greatly improve."
"A very nice, somewhat sweet, barrel-aged barleywine."
"4, 4, 4.5, 4, 4.5"

""
""
"glad i got to try this one for sure."
"O - This is a really tasty brew. Dry Dock does such amazing beer. I need to find more."
""
""
"Drink- Good beer but think the Whiskey couldve been switched out for Bourbon. Too prickly for my tastes really."
""
" Overall an excellent beer! Wow runs toe to toe with MOAS. I have to try to get more of this. It is a must try for sure."
""
""
""
"O: Fantastic beer. Hype train roll on..."
"This one is a bit cloying and hot at times but overall a great beer."
"O: Incredibly good and incredibly smooth. This ranks right up there with MoaS as one of my favorites in the style."
""
"O - Delicious! So glad I got a bottle before they vanished off the shelves. Would gladly drink this again."
""
""
"Overall: Not my favorite of the style but very solid, wish I could get it locally."
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied for the style with carbonation being moderate. Overall it was a great beer. The bourbon and barrel flavors were great in it and were the highlight of it for me. It was very smooth and integrated into the beer flavors. Very solid barrel aged beer overall."
""
""
"Big toffee malt flavor. Nutty, semi-sweet, some nice fruitiness in the form of date and prune. Oak, but not a ton of overt bourbon. A graceful display of oxidation. Full-bodied, with a slight tannic bite to the finish. Enjoyed this quite a bit."
"I love me some barleywine and this one is a good one. Not sure what whiskey was used for this, but it's one of the better ones I've had. It compliments the base beer instead of overpowering it even at a young age."
""
"Overall: This is a really good barleywine. I love caramel and bourbon, so this is right up my alley. I have another bottle that I'll sit on for a while and see what happens with some time."
""
""
""
""
"O: Of so nice and just about everything I want in a barleywine - intense, complex, and smooth! I think this beer will only get better with age, but time will tell. The various layers compliment each other so well and Dry Dock did a masterful job here."
"o - Overall I thought this was a great barleywine. Taste is very complex and balanced, and it has a g reat mouthfeel. a great beer that I'm glad I have another bottle of. just makes me more excited to crack my King Henry."
""
"Absolutely amazing sipper. Share this one."
""
""
"This beer pours nicely with a good head and some lace. Smell is like bread, kind of strange. There is too much heat on this one at 10% and the wood is harsh, makes it hard to drink a lot of it. This was okay but I don't know why it is getting the ratings it is."
"I’ve opened some bottles that were hyped and been really let down. And I’ve open hyped bottles and tried to get up front on the band wagon. I am driving the bus on this one. This is a great beer. How dare they claim to only make this beer once? Seriously….. make this again and again. Awesome."
"(D)- An excellent English Barleywine that deserves plenty of praise. A top tier example and dangerously drinkable."
""
""
""
"Beer is medium in body, sweet on the front, gives way to a nice rounded character of oak and mild liquors. Strong but nice throughout. I really enjoyed it. I'd have it again."
"Its funny to me how some beers become so hyped, most people who want this beer have never tried Dry Dock staples but for whatever reason they are obsessed with attaining this beer. I;m certainly guilty of doing the same with other breweries but to me the hype surronding this beer is particularly unfounded and seemingly random. The hype train needs to slow down a little bit, but undeniably a great beer. Wish i had more, but its all out now."
"Pretty solid, but I definitely wouldn't trade for it again. Not to say that I don't think it was worth trading for the first time. Worth trading for a bottle if you really like BA barleywines."
"Pours ruddy brown, whisps of cocoa head. Big whisky nose, followed by brown sugar and dates; bit of plum and cherry as it warms. Lots of molasses in the taste, vanilla, mild oak. Just the right amount of sweetness, good linger but not sticky. Very drinkable 10%."
""
"Pours a murky dark brown with a thin tan head. Boozy, earthy aroma with a strong barrel presence. Strong caramel and toasted malt, vanilla, whiskey, and oak. Medium thick, chewy body with strong strong carbonation and a hot alcohol finish. Whiskey, vanilla, coconut, dry oak and raisin dominate the flavor. This is a nice take on the style, but the body is a little odd and it is very barrel forward this fresh. Sampling this immediately after King Henry amplified these flaws, but regardless this is well worth trying."
"Pours a medium brown color with a good off-white head and a nice bit of a tan collar. The nose carries some pretty good bourbon with some caramel in the background. Flavor carries a nice bit of bourbon and oak with caramel there as well. Not too many characters but a great combination. Quite well done, but not an amazing bourbon barrel barleywine, though that includes the best of the best."
"The beer is dark brown with a small tan head. Aroma of toffee, bourbon, oak, malt, caramels. Nice flavor. Well balanced and flavorful, but not in the upper tier for the style. Lots of toffee and caramels. Bourbon component is well integrated. A solid beer. Recommended."
""
""
""
"Chewy medium body with a bit more carbonation than expected. There's and excellent balance of booze, barrel character and sweet and leathery malt. Hints of dry oak, sweet boozy whiskey, vanilla and toasted coconut followed by some caramel, toffee, hazelnut and dark fruits, notable fig, raisin and plum. Well balanced with a well masked ABV considering it's strength. There is a lot of alcohol flavor/sweetness but not much heat. Really flavorful and dangerously drinkable. Recommended!"
"O: I really enjoyed this beer. The barrel does a nice job of complimenting the base brew without taking over. If you like caramel, this is the beer for you. Cheers."
""
"Pours a dark amber/copper color with a fairly sizable off-white head. Smells overwhelmingly of dark fruits such as prunes, plums, and raisins. There is a bit of whiskey and vanilla on the back end. Sweet caramel and brown sugar add to the cloyingness. The flavor is also intensely sweet. Heavy on the brown sugar, caramel, and toffee notes. Lots of dark fruit flavors with only minimal whiskey/barrel notes. Medium bodied with surprising carbonation for the style."
"Pours a murky dirty brown with a 1/2 inch foamy tan head that quickly fades to nothing. No lace to speak of. Smell is of malt, brown sugar, toffee, fruit, vanilla, toasted coconut, oak, and some subdued whisky aromas. Taste is pretty much spot on with the smell. A slight bitterness accompanies each sip and there is an alcohol warmth in the back of the throat as well. This beer has a low level of carbonation with a slightly flat and smooth mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good barleywine with a ton of complex smells and tastes. I am really glad I was able to try this beer."
"O. This is excellent, it might be the top barrel aged barley wine to date for me."
""
"Overall: Good, but nothing really sets it apart or pushes it above the B+ range."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: YES! Dry Dock does this beer style really well. Its in the same class as FSW Abacus! I found myself sipping and savoring this beer. Do not pass this beer up, it is phenomenal!"
"Cheers!"
"O-- Good beer. Not great. A little hot and much preferred the taste and feel as opposed to the soft nose with this. Reminds me a lot of a sherry and this this will develop into something really good as it feels bigger than what it currently is."
""
"O: Dry Docks Bligh's Barleywine is a really top notch beer, one where I can actually understand some of the hype. But stepping back from it, and looking at all the components, this barrel aged barleywine is pretty unbalanced, and it simply doesn't reach the upper echelon of the style. Worth trading for? Without question, just keep your whitest of whales at bay."
""
""
"D - I hate to say this but: Over. Rated. Not a bad beer by any stretch, but well down the list of barrel-aged barleywines I'd want to drink. I struggled a bit through my 4oz, as the alcohol is pretty fierce at this stage. I can imagine this being quite enjoyable in 6-12 months and will likely revisit my evaluation, but in my opinion this beer is definitely not an A+."
""
"Drinkability? It was hard to keep the glass on the table. This is some very fine stuff, and maybe the best of the style I've ever tasted."
""
"bottle... once again, hopefully the hype train stops in Chicago for another pretty average beer... dark caramel with a whispy tan head, nice coloring... the aroma is pretty good but too much oak dominates, some really nice sweet malt but has a wort or bready character to it, a bit of molasses as well... the taste is all over the place, and just weird, very syrupy, lots of oak and alcohol, ok for a 3-4 ounces but after that tough to drink... might be great in time, now its merely a slightly above average ba bw"
"O: while the beer is quite good and fits the style the way it should and it had a lovely balance, there isnt anything that screams world class to me. Its a very well made beer though. nothing wrong with it, just nothing that punches me in the face. its like your best employee thats always quite which you never worry about but never moves up because their always in the background"
"O - I absolutely loved this beer and will be seeking more."
""
""
"O: Very solid barleywine, just tried it for the first time right after having a Mother of all Storms, and while this is good, I definitely prefer the MoaS. Great sipping beer packed full of flavor."
""
"This is a sublime beer. I've never had anything else from Dry Dock but I will be seeking some more from them. It's completely balanced with the barrel enhancing the base beer without dominating it. Love it."
"Pours a chestnut with thin sheet of khaki head. Leaves a few spots. Smells like a good bourbon, vanilla and oak with raisins and caramel in the backround. Taste is malt forward, burnt brown sugar, molasses, oak, dark fruits, and some alcohol. Light carbonation works well. A very good BA Barleywine that stands up their with all of the others."
""
""
""
"Overall, this could be my new favorite barleywine. It is incredibly balanced, easy to drink, and full flavored. My 12 oz. pour disappeared way too quickly and I wanted more. It would not be hard to drink an entire bottle by yourself. I will definitely seek this out again. A+."

"Side note: This beer was aged in Stranahan's Whiskey Barrels, so it's not bourbon your tasting, it's single-malt whiskey made in Colorado, not Kentucky."
"Medium to full body is well carbonated, not too thick or cloying. Would like to see a bit more depth in the finish. Should age well for at least a few years, but is drinking pretty well right now."
"note: Not sure I would call it an American Barleywine, I'd say more English. Hops aren't really present"
"I’ve bought a couple more bottles and while I’d love to save them, something tells me they’ll be gone before I know it!"
"I figured I'd give this another shot and I think the 2012 is even better than the 2011. Fantastic taste of caramel, toffee, whiskey barrel, strong but delicious. This reminds me of the fresh Abacus I had in 2011. World class."
"The many interesting flavors in this beer are a bit disjointed right now, but could easily come together as something spectacular in the short term (2ish years). More than 2 years and it might become truly ambrosia-like...or a soy-like mess. I hope to pick up a number of bottles so I can find out."
"Overall this a fabulous beer that I will seek out on a regular basis."
"O - Overall this is probably one of the best beers ive had all year. We put this up against 09' Moas recently at a tasting and it blew it out of the water. Really smooth tons of flavor from start to finish and beyond, really complex beer. It sucks that Stranahan's barrels will no longer be used because Dry Dock really nailed this one."
"overall - only question is the aging. can this last years and keep up with this? i dont know, but its fucking awesome right now"
"Thanks Dan for sharing the other night. Poured a dark reddish amber color with a nice tan head. Big boozy aromas, malt, oak, bourbon and caramel. On the palate, this one was full bodied and went down entirely too easy for 10%. Flavors of oak, sweet malt, bourbon and caramel. ™"
"Appearance was pleasant. Nice burgundy brown color. Aroma is sweet and of toffee, caramel. Taste was of vanilla, coconut and sweet pang of caramel. the mouthfeel was exceptional with a sweetness from the alcohol and barrel aging, along with a nice oily texture that went wonderfully with the paired caramel apple cheescake I had with it. Overall, Very impressive."
"Shared a bomber of this Saturday night. Poured a brownish color with a small head. Aromas of toffee, caramel, and booze. Taste was wonderful: vanilla, caramel, toffee, and a little heat from the higher alcohol. Mouthfeel was just about perfect: lightly carbonated, very smooth across the tongue, and no bitterness at the end. This one is a great job by Dry Dock; I will have to seek out more of this!"
"O - If I lived in Colorado I would have bought a case of this when it was released. Hell, I don't live in Colorado and will do my best to acquire one anyway. This is a great barrel-aged barleywine. I honestly liked this better than MoaS and Abacus, can't speak to others...yet. Seek this out if you can. Great job Dry Dock, you should be proud of this one."
"This beer is very satisfying. Dry Dock did an excellent job of capturing the best qualities that the barrels had to offer. The balance and thick layers of flavors and smells makes this one of the best barrel aged beers that I have had in quite some time."
"O: perhaps one of the best beers i've had all year, by far the best barleywine i've ever had (usually not a fan of the style) this offering from dry dock is truly supreme. with only 1200 bottles of this and stranahans discontinuing their offerings of barrels to anyone but breckenridge, despite my potential homerism i think any bourbon bal fan and/or barleywine fan NEEDS to try this beer!"
"alright, the price ($19.00 per bomber) really made me think twice about this purchase, but the fact the there was only one on the shelf, and it came highly regarded sealed the deal. can't say i regret it. this one poured a deep caramel auburn color into a wine glass, with a very thin but persistent little head. holy cow the nose! this one smells of bourbon whiskey, oak, and alcohol. also coconut in the nose like the label says, but not coconut from a tree, more like a can of coconut milk, which is entirely pleasant and subtle. mmm! mouthfeel is slightly heavy and sweet, almost like a real nice dubbel, complex and malty. the alcohol is all smoothed out with a thoroughly robust whiskey finish, certainly imparted from the barrel aging process. a big time beer, warming from the inside out. heavy heavy buzz after a bomber. really nice on an early autumn night. if any volume of beer can be so pricey and worth it, it surely is dry dock bligh's. not for everyone, but impeccably well done!"
"Update - had this again last night. It is really coming along nicely. 8 months has helped smooth this beer out and it is now magical."
"My only complaint is that this should be in 12 ounce bottles rather than just bombers. 12 ounces is just right and it's silly to force people to open more at one time. If I'm with friends and sharing, I can easily just open a second 12 ounce bottle. But if drinking by myself, I'd love to just drink a 12 ounce bottle on a week night."
