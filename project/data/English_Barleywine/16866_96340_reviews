"I love the Bruery and, in theory, this one is right up my alley but it just didn't do it for me."

"nearly 2 years old, this was exceptionally smooth, full of barrel character and gorgeously blended caramel, toffee, brown sugar notes, and not overly sweet. Excellent beer"
"Hazy light brown pour, with a thin layer of white bubbles on top. In the aroma, wood, toasted cereal grains, caramel, rusty metal. A lot of barrel in the taste, almost too much, very woody, grainy malts, stale bready sugars. Body was light-medium. Just not what I'm interested in for the style."

"Overall: The first sip threw me for a loop, but after that it settled down into a great beer."

"O:  Overall, I feel that Mash & Grind is a better beer.  It has more complexity and while the base is really good it doesn't seem to quite be able to stand up on its own and for the price it should.  The complexity of this beer is good and the flavors are rock solid though.  This beer is definitely one to sip throughout an evening."

"The grind version had so much more complexity it seemed."

"Huge coconut cream pie flavors!  Just awesome!"

"O â€“ Man, this is a hell of an English barleywine. The aroma is incredible, the flavors not quite matching up.  I would love to cellar this and revisit in a couple years as it mellows and evolves."

"An interesting and ambitious brew with a lot going on, but the fruity, ester-y aspect aren't aligned enough with the base flavors for this to be knock-you-on-your-ass delicious."

"A spot on English Barleywine with a subtle barrel character.  Really warm and comforting.  Well done and highly recommended."

"Eh. there's just something not hitting me right. It's a good beer, just not a memorable one. I won't seek again @ $20. Aroma is just flat-out too much and unmelded. Too English of an English."

"OVERALL: This is an enjoyable, well-balanced barleywine. The barrel is nice and the base beer holds its own underneath. Unfortunately the feel is too light and prickly for the style, which hurts the experience overall, but besides that issue, this is a quality beer worth checking out. Cheers claaark13."

"O - Sweet and nice, a touch of heat in the back end, but I enjoyed it."
""
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. A very nice barleywine with solid balance between malt, alcohol and hops. Admittedly, I drank this entire bottle myself and only while pouring the last glass did I read that this was aged in bourbon barrels. By no means is the barrel aging obvious."

"Mash might be neither my favorite English barleywine nor my favorite from The Bruery but it's really freakin good. A boozy sweet treat that it worth a try for fans of the style."

"O-A good BA Barleywine. But nowhere near Abacus and the like."

"The palate opens with a blend of bourbon and sweetness and washes that up with some oak. As disjointed as the nose was, the palate's worse. A pleasant enough barrel character is present, with vanilla, coconut and overbearing oak. Toffee, burnt caramel and a moderate fruitiness are present on the mid-palate. I can't understate how disappointing the finish is. Boozy, tannic and disappointingly watery, there is very little redeeming about this aspect.. The wateriness alone makes me dump the entire damn thing. There's some lingering floral and coconut present. Medium in body with a slick carbonation, this is rather disappointing."

"M - Full bodies. Thick and viscous. Light carbonation."
"M: Full bodied beer. Fairly chewy. Thinner than I guess I was expecting"

"Pours a hazy orange-brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, brown sugar, caramel, bourbon, wood, and slight metallic aromas. Taste is much the same with caramel and bourbon flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of woody bitterness and an alcohol kick on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer but the slight metallic aroma I am getting is odd."

"I also did as the Bruery suggested and mixed this with M&G...fun, but I think 100% M&G is still the best."

"O: Overall this is a well put together English barleywine which is one of my more preferred styles. It doesnt have the overwhelming hops of some of the stronger barleywines out there and can be sipped lightly while enjoying the malt complexities. I think they could even kick this up a notch in abv with how this finished so dry. I'd drink it again."
"The beer is light brown with a touch of crimson. Small beige head that settles around 1/8 inch. The aroma brings bourbon, malt, toffee, caramels, burnt sugar, oak. Nice flavor, following the aroma. A bit of alcohol heat in the finish, but really, the alcohol is well hidden for the most part. A really nice brew to sip and savor. Solid."

"Overall quite nice. Good malt character, although could have used a bit more complexity, nice hop character for an English barleywine, booze is hidden well, nice bourbon barrel characters, all around decent beer."
"O - Overall this was a booze bomb, bourbon goodness."

"Overall - Yet another Bourbon brown sugar bomb from the Bruery. This one is tiring, though."

"O: This is a decent barleywine, but I think it needs a bit of time for the alcohol to mellow. The nose left me wanting a bit more from this beer."

"T: Very sweet upfront, with notes of caramel, date,molasses, raisin, burnt marshmallow, and bourbon. Finish brings some light oak and a touch of dryness and alcohol. The mouthfeel is very light, which was a little off-putting for me. Other than that, this is really nice."
