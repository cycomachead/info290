4.17,6.1,3.75,4.25,4.25,3.75,4.25,"Poured into a Fremont small snifter. Pours a very dark mahogany brown, appearing nearly opaque black in the glass with a thick khaki cap that dissipates to thin patches with little lacing. Aroma of caramel malt, fresh and dried dark fruit, particularly plums and raisins, concord grape, fruitier than expected for this style, but pleasant. Flavor is similar, dominated by plums, raisins, dates, currents; light red wine notes of oak tannin, caramel malt, earthy. Medium to heavy bodied with light carbonation. Not an American barleywine (little hops) and not a traditional English one either, with more of a dark fruit profile rather than caramel malt. A nice change of pace flavor for a barleywine. Well integrated flavors and moderately complex. Nicely made and different. Each taste surprises me with the fruit flavors, which I'm still not expecting from what is clearly a barleywine. ABV well covered, but this is warming. The carbonation is a bit weak, and that is the only flaw I found in this. I'm hoping to find a second bottle for ageing, since this has such an interesting flavor; usually the malt is the dominating flavor change in aged barleywines, here it will be the other flavors. Intriguing.","LiquidAmber","Jan 18, 2015"

I feel many craft breweries lose the essence of this style looking for innovation, whereas this brew strikes a perfect balance between ambition and tradition.

Smell is of toasted malt, caramel, toffee, and honey aromas. Taste is much the same with toast, caramel, and toffee flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of earth bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with nice caramel, toffee, and honey qualities all around.","UCLABrewN84","Jul 04, 2014"

The beer is thick/full but smooth and easy to drink thanks to some oakiness (body is chewy at times), and has a real good sweet edge thanks to vanilla/caramel taste notes and possible dark fruits along with figs. I have a sweet tooth and this beer seemed to hit it often and this was complemented by a slightly hot boozy finish. A very enjoyable barleywine.","clayrock81","May 30, 2014"

Flavor is pretty decent. Kind of seems a bit too clogged with a mild boozy edge and a whole lot of malty sweetness. A shame really as it exhibits a lot of characteristics you want to see for the style. After 16 months I wouldn't imagine it to be like this though. Maybe it's just not a good barleywine for aging.","RblWthACoz","Apr 22, 2014"

4.01,2,3.75,4,4,4.25,4,"rock solid barleywine ale here, pouring a decadent toffee amber color and sporting over an inch of yellowish fluff. the nose on this is all brown sugar and maple syrup, one sugar layer cuts through the next, deep and rich for sure, with all the grain in your face you could ever want, fresh and strong, wintery, sexy. the flavor is similarly robustly flavored, with more molasses this time around, even honey, i taste a million sweeteners without a ton of residual sugar, tough to do, and in this case done beautifully. the grains are fresh and anywhere from lightly toasted to close to burnt, its also got a strange but enjoyable candied orange peel flavor towards the finish before the booze comes in. i like to taste the alcohol just a bit in my barleywine, and this one has that aspect dialed. long rich finish cleaned away by alcohol. huge body this is a slow sipper, but it improves with warmth so no rush. perennial can do no wrong right now.","StonedTrippin","Jan 14, 2014"
