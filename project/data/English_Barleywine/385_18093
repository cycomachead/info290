4.3,-1.6,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"3000th review! 22 ounce bottle into snifter; 2014 vintage, bottled in late 2013. Pours hazy dark ruby red color with a 1 finger fairly dense khaki head with solid retention, that reduces to a small spotty lace cap that lingers. Slight spotty lacing on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big raisin, plum, fig, caramel, toffee, toast, brown sugar, coconut, vanilla, bourbon, oak, leather, light chocolate, and oak/toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/toasted malt, fruity yeast, and bourbon barrel notes; with good strength. Light-moderate booziness as it warms, but not too bad. Taste of big raisin, plum, fig, caramel, toffee, butterscotch, toast, coconut, brown sugar, molasses, brown bread, bourbon, oak, vanilla, leather, light chocolate, and oak/toasted earthiness. Light oaky bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, plum, fig, caramel, butterscotch, molasses, toffee, toast, coconut, vanilla, brown sugar, bourbon, oak, leather, light chocolate, and oak/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity and robustness of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast, and bourbon barrel flavors; with an awesome malt/yeast/barrel balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very creamy, fairly slick, and slightly syrupy/sticky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light-moderate warming lingering after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic barrel aged English barelywine style. All around awesome complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast, and bourbon barrel flavors; and smooth to sip on for the huge ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Beers"

Vanilla, sweetness, and a bit of bourbon.  Taste is absolutely incredible and follows the nose.  Plenty of caramel and barrel coming through, with some nice brown sugar.  Truly amazing.

Aroma of toffee, residual brown sugar and caramelized malt is pretty awesome. Taste is also dominated by toffee with some brown sugar notes and caramelized malt. All rough edges have been rounded by the bourbon notes with light vanilla notes also noticeable. Body is full with limited filtration and a good amount of carbonation. This beer has so many layers of complexity while retaining such a good amount of drinkability. Really amazing beer that I wish I could try on a regular basis.","Phyl21ca","Beers"

4.54,3.9,4,4.25,4.75,4.75,4.5,"Picked this up in a great trade with Evan! An aggressive pour yields a caramel-colored two finger head with decent retention and great lacing. Dark brown, nearly black pour is probably the darkest Barley Wine I've seen. Rich, bold nose with huge dark fruits, bourbon, and oak along with hints of vanilla, figs, toffee, raisins, and sweet brown bread. The taste follows suit with tons of oak and dark fruits along with hints of vanilla, maple, butterscotch, subtle chocolate, molasses, brown bread, and toffee. The mouthfeel is thick and syrupy, but creamy smooth with a subtle warming finish. The 13.4% ABV is nowhere to be found for this unbelievably drinkable beer. Overall, this is a world class Barley Wine. Bold, flavorful, complex, and extremely drinkable. It's time to start trading for more...","beerdrifter","Jun 29, 2014"

Im in love with English style brews as in old ales, stouts and barleywines. This is a spot on english style barleywine. Malt foward with lots of fruit. I was surprised by this brew. I now have to have a side by side with bourbon county barleywine as I feel this has a slight edge for my taste.","pjkelley82","Jun 21, 2014"

Taste consistent with nose with a light, residual ethanol presence that cuts the sweetness. Mouthfeel is light-medium with an even carbonation. This has been a long-time want of mine and I was not disappointed. Top notch - wish I had more.","Jwale73","Jun 21, 2014"

It is extremely hard to peg a top component for this beer, as everything about it sings beautifully and strictly to style, all while satiating and appeasing the drinker. The aroma is deep, rich, and sweet, and the flavoring follows exactly as it should in those footprints. The booze is heavy but subdued, and neither hot nor harsh at any point. The bourbon is glorious, oaky, and musky, just boasting what a proper barrel aging could do for a beer. The feel is what really takes this beer to other-worldly status, with velvety crush, silky smoothness, and buttery slide across the oropharynx. Even with excessive warmth, the Arctic Devil remains firm to its promises, with the complexity of it all extending this tasting beyond two hours. This is one of the best English barleywines weâ€™ve ever come across, and again, while that is partly due to its impeccable execution of recipe and style, the unique, heavily warming, and rich Alaskan flair makes for an incredible, unforgettable experience that will not soon be forgotten.","TheBrewo","Dec 01, 2013"

Aromas of dark caramelized sugar, dark pitted fruits, bits of wood, hints of rum and bourbon, light alcohol, no hop aromas. The flavor is sweet with dark sugars, light oak, light fruits, a solid hit of warming alcohol and a touch of earth. Medium to thick body with a moderate to light level of carbonation and a sweet almost sticky mouthfeel. One of my favorite barley wines, I only wish it were a little easier to obtain.","johnnnniee","Oct 20, 2013"

Maybe MS has ditched some of their port and cabernet barrels for more bourbon, because thats the direction that this vintage is headed for. Mouthfeel on the beer is, as always, velvety and sublime.","oceanman907","Sep 04, 2013"

This is a good beer, but my favorite was the '08, sadly I didn't review back then, but I recall a fuller body and more refined character in the beer.

This is sit-down-and-take-a-moment good, and I can imagine it getting better with age. The pour is clear ruby with a tiny head. Itâ€™s fairly viscous, though not quite as much as you might expect from a 14% abv beer. All sorts of flavors come out in the aroma and taste. Thereâ€™s an enormous English caramel/toffee malt flavor marbled with a ton of fruitiness. Lots of raisins, plums, peaches, dates and cherries. On top of that, there are great flavors of vanilla, mint, oak, leather and subtle barrel notes. Thereâ€™s just a touch of hop bitterness in the finish to pull it back from cloying territory. This is a deeply flavored beer that oozes luxury and craftsmanship. Mouthfeel is full and smooth. It coats the mouth pleasantly, but Iâ€™ve had lots of stickier, boozier beers that arenâ€™t nearly the size of this one. Midnight Sun knows their stuff and really hit one out of the park with this beer. I might be scoring this a bit low in anticipation of trying an aged bottle in a few years.","popery","Jan 26, 2013"

Hints of toffee, dark fruit, caramel and leathery malts with a slightly dry finish. Â Subtle warmth in finish but overall the ABV is very well masked. Â Lots of boozy flavor but not a lot of heat.

Taste is a wee bit on the sweet side but not overly so, light brown sugar. Mouthfeel is a bit on the full side of medium, good effervescence. This brew packs a powerful punch, splitting a bottle multiple ways is highly recommended. A very good example of English style Barleywine, malt-forward and very tasty.","jdense","May 03, 2012"

4.29,-1.8,4,5,4,4.5,4,"Arctic Devil pours a fairly clear polished mahogany. There's about two fingers of khaki colored foam capping the beer. Head retention is solid, but lacing is fairly spotty. The nose is just a series of wonderful aromas washing over me one, after the next. Port inspired dark fruits, coconut, vanilla, caramel, and nutty sherry-like aromas all take a turn in the spotlight, not to mention a slight smell of alcohol. After all that, the flavor profile has a hard time living up. Darl fruits and a nutty sweetness are the dominant flavors, with vanilla and caramel showing up as well. A lid more presence from the base barleywine would be great, because what's in my glass is tasty, but I think I could come up with something similar just by blending some port and sherry to taste. The slight alcohol warmth creeps in pleasantly for the finish of each sip. The body is pleasantly rich and full, though not as heavy as I might have expected from a 13+% beer. The carbonation is wonderfully understated, doing its job while staying out of the way of the malt and barrel flavors. Arctic Devil is a great brew to have in your glass for a couple hours, I just wish it wasn't so clearly dominated by the barrel aging.","axeman9182","Apr 24, 2012"

Really well balanced with sugars and alcohol in control without being disguised to the point that one could down this quickly with unexpected results. For me the highlight of this beer is the well placed and lingering creme brulee effect. I can almost imagine the crunch and crackle of the burnt sugar coating on top of the dessert...really, really nice effect. This absolutely makes this beer for me.

Faded hops and caramel blend fantastically. This beer is delicious and deserves to be aged for this time period. Best Barleywine I have had other than Gratitude (oddly enough, this tastes more like an American barleywine and Gratitude more like an English Barleywine, and yet their designations are reversed on the site). Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. This was consumed after a fresh Mother of All Storms, which could not compete (though it might be unfair to compare a fresh, barrel-aged barleywine to a two year aged one).

Aroma is sweetness, dark fruit, and alcohol, all well proportioned. Taste is creamy maltiness upfront, dark fruit and touch of tanned leather in the middle, and massaging alcohol warmth to close. Mouthfeel is wow smooth, and drinkability is scary dangerous for the abv. Seek this one out.","ppoitras","Jun 03, 2006"

Cinammon and spice and nutty barleywine. Full mouthfeel. Flavorful winter warmer crossover, very good.","Sammy","May 21, 2006"

4.67,6.9,4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a deep mahogany with reddish hues, A thin one finger tan cap that dissipated into thin lacings. Aroma is sweet caramel and molasses, estery figs, some citrus and floral hops, and a little alcohol. vinous aroma. Explosive rich flavor of figs and molasses, a little tropical fruit, toasted buttery cashews, whiskey, vinous quality, very nice subtle floral and tangerine hop bitterness, undertones of spice and pepper. Alcohol is noticeable with a deep warming effect. Mouthfeel is viscous with a full body, with med-high carbonation, and finishes dry. Exceptional and half-way done with bomber and already feeling good!!! Glad I have a couple more of these cellared.","jabocu","Apr 05, 2006"
4.6,5.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"22oz bottle that was bottled on November 05. Deep brownish amber with a good sized tan head. Light lacing and good head retention. Aroma is full of sweet ripe dark fruits with some caramel. Molasses and milder notes of bakerÂ’s chocolate lingering in the back. The flavor starts with more of the ripe fruit notes with sweet caramel. Caramel, toffee and molasses are noted as well. Some earthiness and a nice bitter touch to keep the sweetness in check. Very rich and full flavored. No real signs of alcohol just some warmth as it goes down. Pretty damn thick and smooth as well. Perfectly drinkable to me, big flavor with no harshness at all. Amazing stuff that I wish were available locally.","meathookjones","Mar 17, 2006"

4.17,-4.6,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Dark ruby. Wonderfully extracted caramel and chocolate malts in the nose, along with the barrel contribution which brings slight aromatics of cocunut, bourbon and wood. Fairly simple aroma but the flavor makes up for it. Chocolate covered raisin flavor with hints of caramel and oak and a touch of hops of the back of tonque. Full, coating flavor. A very good beer.","Crosling","Mar 12, 2006"

4.07,-6.9,4,4.5,4,4.5,3.5,"Before I review I must say beware of this devil it f*ckin will bite you!Just newly bottled on November 5th this bad boy poured a deep amber with a thin off white head,incredible complexities in the aroma vanilla,oak and kentucky whiskey really hits and hits hard really waking up the senses and quite appetizing.Now I really liked the flavors of this beer but whoo they hit ya,very woody and whiskish (if thats a word) with vanilla and caramel standing out as well.The alcohol burn steals the show it actually burned my nose going down.This beer weighs in at 14% alc although the label says 10% that according to the head brewer at Midnight Sun and it feels like more than that.A very good very complex barley wine but these need to be laid down for awhile thats for sure.","oberon","Dec 02, 2005"
4.12,-5.7,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Flavors that would complement the five star meals served by the two chefs attending Emit and Randy at their long days ends back at their lodge. Complex caramel malts oak flavors swimming in alcolic hopped liquid. Randy, a hophead noted that it was still hoppy thinking that it was this years release - and could use a few more month in the cellar. I did not tell him it was already had a year of aging. I found the hop/malt balance very nice with the bitterness and alcohol countering the sweetness.","karst","Sep 05, 2005"
3.95,-9.6,4,4,4,4.5,3.5,"This is one rich beer, almost overpoweringly so, and is dominated by dark fruit flavors. The finish is impressive too. My only complaint is that the sweetness is a bit too much; this brew would be a little more drinkable if the sweetness were a milder. Still, highly recommended.","arguemaniac","Jul 18, 2005"

4.29,-1.8,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Dark ruddy, muddy, dirty, cola coloured brown with a fizzy, fizzly head that dies out quickly. Aromas are all raisins, dark fruits, plums, residual sugars, and not really a hint of booze. Impressive. Taste follows suit with plenty of malty dark fruit flavors, and candied spicy flavors. Rum raisin cake, maybe? This is really like an old ale, not so much of a barleywine, but hey, who's keepin' score? Mouthfeel is medium bodied and drinkability is pretty good as well. A nice one from AK.","francisweizen","Apr 13, 2005"
