3.9,10.5,4,4,4,4,3.5,"22 ounce bottle into snifter; no bottle dating, but likely from the January 2011 initial release(282 10 bottle manufacture code). Pours hazy deep reddish copper color with a 2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big caramel, toffee, toast, brown bread, biscuit, nuttiness, light chocolate, raisin, plum, fig, pear, apple, cherry, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast ester, and earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of big caramel, toffee, toast, brown bread, biscuit, nuttiness, light chocolate, raisin, plum, fig, pear, apple, cherry, herbal, grass, pepper, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Fair amount of earthy/spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toffee, toast, brown bread, biscuit, nuttiness, light chocolate, raisin, plum, fig, pear, apple, cherry, herbal, grass, pepper, and yeast/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and fruity yeast ester flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very smooth, creamy, and fairly slick/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice English barelywine style. All around good complexity, balance, and robustness of dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and fruit yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Nov 10, 2014"

3.04,-13.9,3.5,3.25,3,3,2.75,"Overall: I like this style and this one is about average as to what I have had. Very malty, but nothing really jumps out like others I have had in the style. I will pass on this in the future.","tigg924","May 13, 2014"
3.92,11,4,3.75,4,3.75,4,"Big malty, spicy, boozy entry. Moderate sweetness. Big caramel and Burnt/charred brown sugar. Fruity, plumy/figiness (from malts). Firm citrus- grapefruit, orange, slight tangerine notes. Bold black pepper spiciness. Woody, earthy dampness noted from hops. Pale muted malts lie in the background. Decent amount of smokiness detected. Hoppy clean bitterness. Minimal hoppy resins stick to the palate. Slight cereal graininess in the finish. Carbonation is adequate, non contributory. Alcohol warms as it travels. Overall, the booziness, bittering hoppy qualities, and increased spiciness make this beer a little too high octane for the average craft beer drinker, especially for an English beer. The beer definitely has it's moments, just won't be appreciated by most. To me, it's as if an English brewer was asked to make an American Barleywine. Interesting. I'll have another.","mac31","Apr 19, 2014"

Served in a snifter, the beer pours a hazy dark copper color with an inch tan head. Head retention is decent, and there's a lot of lacing left behind on the glass. Aroma is nice and malty, the brew smells like caramel, toffee, butterscotch, dark fruit and some bready malt. The taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also the addition of some booze, nuts, and a bit of spice. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's creamy and slick with a good amount of carbonation.

It's a jumble of sweetness, nearly independent of the malt, and alcoholic hotness. Fresh and sharp bitterness is a fleeting sensation. The finish is lingering, sweet, and warm.

4.25,20.4,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"I find it hard to believe this beer scored so low in other's ratings. It's both beautiful and scrumptious. It poured like a thick barley wine with a slow to emerge beige 1" head. In masstone it's a burnt sienna brown but held to the light there's a pretty hazy reddish tint. Smell is great with rich malt, caramel, and hops but not a slap in the face amount of them. Taste is delicious, kind of like candied hops. Rich, sweet, with caramel, toffee, and barley wine attributes. I don't always drink sweet or bold beers but I find this Old Thumper very appealing. And the 11.2% alcohol is well hidden, not a boozy burning mess in my opinion. I say nice job Shipyard.","MoreThanWine","Jul 30, 2011"

I think it is too much of a "good" thing. I would not categorize this as an ESB. I think it is far too potent. Barley Wine is a better description. The body matches this well: Rich mouthfeel with enough carbonation to prevent it from being cloy. In the end, there's too much alcohol to make this work.","smcolw","Jul 09, 2011"

Strong aroma is malty and a little yeasty with a firm overtone of apple brandy. Sharp, malty flavor has a strong brandy tang and hints of hoppy bitterness and caramel, with just a whisper of fruity sweetness.

Once the hops kick in, it feels much heavier and drier, but there are occasional traces of the initial mouthfeel, probably attributable to the high Alcohol By Volume. The finish is bitter and lingering. This oneâ€™s a mixed bag.","DaveHS","Apr 24, 2011"

Nut, butter, bread, and just a touch of booze in the aroma. Bready, fruity, with nut, touch of butter, and just a hint of alcohol, though it's more of a warming than a flavor. Full bodied bordering on viscous, with low carbonation. A meal of a beer. A sipper for sure. This reminds me more of an English barleywine than an ESB.

I picked up a bottle this past week (at Shipyard) while on business in Maine because I really wanted to try this one. I'm back up there in a few weeks and I'll be stopping by again to get more bottles and cellar a few to see where they go. Big beers like this often get better with age and this one is already good when it's young. A very interesting observation is the bottled version seems to be far hoppier than the tap version. Definitely prefer the bottle which I can't say about very many beers.","jzeilinger","Feb 16, 2011"
