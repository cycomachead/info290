"Great balance of fruitiness, smoked malts and that small hint of Brett. Tasty, quite refreshing and a nice gateway beer for people that haven't really acquired a taste for smoked beers (yet)."

"A smoked hoppy amber? Not getting the oats because this was a gusher. But there is restrained smoke, solid hops and balance once it settles."
"O - I like the balance of this beer but the finish is a little off putting."
"Bottle: Poured an hazy dirty amber color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of peat malt with some candi sugar notes and a bready yeast is quite singular. Taste is a mix between some smoky notes with light peat notes also discernable, some Belgian malt with some residual sugar that cuts through some of the smoke notes and a bready yeast to finish it all. Body is quite full with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Interesting mix between a Belgian amber and a smoked ale though smoked malt could be more pronounced."

"OVERALL: Like their Belgian IPA, the nose doesn't really match the flavor, but regardless, the flavor really comes together well with this one. Very complex and excellently balanced for sure. The palate needs to be beefed up for this to really get over the hump, as the feel holds the flavors back from being all they can be, but for now, it's a beer you should check out if you get the chance. Quality stuff. Cheers guys!"
"Taste is smokey with clear peat-like character. A peat whisky resemblance is present. Some bandaid taste, maybe some iodine. The beer has a low bitterness and is a little sticky on the lips. The beer is nicely balanced, but the peat is what the beer is all about."
"Pours nice red with a thick bubbly head. Aroma seems to be heavy with oak flavor, including vanilla and a slight fruitiness. Flavor has a tannic astringent bite with some acidity and a vanilla finish (more hints of oak). The flavor seems thin at first but seems to thicken as it warms. I emphasize that this beer should be allowed to warm somewhat from refrigerator temperatures as the flavor improves remarkably. Overall the beer seems to be dominated by oak flavors, though this is not unwelcome."
"The smoke comes back in the taste. Mouthfeel would have been a bit better with some more abv."
"O: On the whole, this is a solid, likable beer. A bit different than most smoked beers, but good nonetheless."
"O: The smokiness was a bit harsh which isn't what I like at all."
"Overall this was a very interesting beer thatâ€™s well worth a shot."
"Pours a very cloudy bright yellow with a splash of red. A thick frothy head dissipates quickly leaving a ton of sticky lacing clinging tightly to the glass. Sweet smells of smoke easily dominate the nose. Some malt and fruity hops contribute in minor fashion to the overall aroma. First sip is smoky but not over the top. A strong malt backbone matches the smoke and adds to the overall experience. Perfectly carbonated makes for a great mouthfeel. Very nice!"
"D: watery and thin, needed more guts but highly drinkable"
"Drink: I couldn't do the rauchbier but this was nice. They're a bit pricy for a 12oz. ($6.99, City Beer Store), but if you have the chance, grab one. A very nice beer."
"Overall it is a quirky but good beer."
"Green bottle but no noticable damage. Poured with a good sized foamy frothy cream colored head that lasts for a while and some lace. Color is hazy and has a tarnished copper amber. Aroma is malt toasted oat cereal hint of smoke. Flavor has smoke show much more with a touch of sweetness and some yeast. Not too complex, but not bad. Slight tang also. Good body and carbonation. Finish is smokey at first then tangy ending with a touch of alcohol."
"This is an unusual, and I think quite refined beer. It is made of barley, wheat, and oatmeal malts which lends it a smooth, balanced maltiness. Although I am sure some people would like this for sessioning, because it is very dry and champagne-like, I would pair it with food, maybe a green leafy salad with red onions, a crab salad, roast or grilled chicken, or grilled salmon. It would also go well with some steamed mussels and frites."
"D: I agree with a very ""pleasant"" beer. Certainly worth a taste!"
"Average body, balance between candy sugar an smokiness, subtle but pleasant."
"A very interesting beer; one quite unlike anything I've had in some time. For such a relatively low alcohol beer, I thought there was a lot going on in it. Enjoyable."
"As an easy drinking low ABV high in flavor beer, I have to say I'm impressed. I'd just categorize this as a Belgian pale ale, though."
"Pours an orange gold color. Thinner creme head. Overall mildly sour. I don't really get much smoke tone on there. (This is a smoked beer?) Nothing severely complex, but decent enough. A nice drinker and something to try and think about, but probably not something to go back to."
"M&D: rather light and refreshing on carbonation, as a result of solid bottle-conditioning; but the overall flavour profile tells an understated story if it was to define itself as a smoked ale. For the smokiness is too weak to balance with other elements, albeit somehow adding a niche to the otherwise mundane amber ale."
