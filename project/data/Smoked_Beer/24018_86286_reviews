"Tastes like a bad fermentation, take a pass"
""

"The new version of this (2015) is a complete mess of a beer. Gross sweaty smell. Mild sour taste with some smokiness. Nothing like the old version, this version is all bungled up with nothing substantial to offer. Would decline this"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: the taste is a lot better than I was expecting, and I love what this beer does in a gin barrel (Viking Metal), but as it is its still a little too weird for me to want to return to regularly."
""

" The taste brings a tangy yeast element with light malt quality and slight smoke in the initial flavor impression with subtle spiciness which could also be considered herbal hop with mild yeast tanginess and light malt nuttiness with a slight herbal quality carrying through into the dry crisp finish. This is great with very good drinkability in general -I appreciate the chance to try this old world style and  it is every bit as good as I expected."

"An interesting brew. My bottle has been cellared for a year and tastes different (better) than a fresher bottle. I don’t know what gale tastes like, but the juniper is barely noticeable. I think if I lived on an island off the coast of Sweden, I’d probably brew and drink a lot of this."

"Bottle: Poured a cloudy golden color ale with a nice generous white head with good retention and some light lacing. Aroma of light salty rustic malt notes with some spices, juniper and light smoked notes also noticeable. Taste is a unique mix of juniper, smoked notes with some salty rustic malt notes clearly identifiable. Body is about average with good carbonation. Very interesting beers for sure but I am not sure I would feel the need to drink this on a regular basis."

"O: Worth the journey for this tasty brew? Indeed. Not to the liking of all, but hit the spot on a mild almost-spring night."

"O - Very interesting... I like it, but it's not something I'd reach for."

"O: This beer is easy to drink and has a nice balance between the flavors of juniper and smoked malts."
"O: Really easy drinking for the style. The smoke seems natural and complimenting not forced. Sometimes smoked beers are just plain hard to drink due to the massive smoke profile. This is not the case. This is about six months old so the smoke may have faded a bit but I like it."

"overall i give this a 4. it's a solid beer, and so far one of the best i've had from this brewery. i do love rauchbiers, and this is pretty much one, except i've never had one with these ingredients.. sweet gale and juniper? also the different woods used to smoke these grains are an excellent touch!"
""
""
""

"Overall: Definitely an intriguing beer. This will pair amazing with some BBQ and/or smoked rack of ribs. Will definitely buy again when I get the urge to pillage a neighboring city."
""
""
"Overall very interesting and unique, pretty well done but a bit too much residual sugar somehow even with all that carbonation it brings. The smoked malts are nice, as well as sweet gale, juniper is barely detectable mostly and it could have used a bit more bitterness I think. but still a very unique and tasty beer to try."

"D - Nice smoked saison. Good balance of smoke, spices, and yeast character."
""
"Light bodied with plenty of carbonation that is not overdone which is what I was expecting based on the huge head."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - So smokey it is hard to taste much else."
""
"Provided by JJ. Served with a large, foamy, frothy, off-white head that lasts all the way down. Color is a hazy amber. Aroma is yeast, smoke, sour, with notes of fruit. Flavor's like nose, smoke is prominant, but not overdone; again a bit tart. Body's decent, good carbonation. Finish is like flavor, fairly easy drinking, would killer to cook with.."

"O: I had very little expectations for this one, but I'm glad I had it. First smoky beer I've had like this. Not thick, not stouty, or a porter, but maintained an awesome smoky flavor and had a good light body. I'd drink again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Cheers!"
""
"Pretty decent beer that I am glad I got the chance to try. I am a fan of smoked beers, and this is a bit of a rustic smoke beer that brings something unique to the plate. Inspired by the drink of Gotland, this beer will make you feel like a true Viking. The more I drink this beer, the more I think I love it. You have to approach the beer knowing what goes into the beer, because if you aren't thinking ""juniper and sweet gale"" you will miss this beer entirely. Pretty awesome beer!"

"Overall- Another unique offering from Jester King. More of an everyday beer than most smoked ales, and like certain sodas, room temp and nearly flat suits it well- let it warm up a bit and savor. I'll certainly pick it up again."

"This is a pretty strange beer. It is technically sound for a smoked beer but the flavors are not something that I enjoy at all. The smoked aroma and flavor do not play well with the juniper. It is too much like liquid campfire in a bottle to be enjoyable."
"Overall, not bad. I can see myself sipping on this if offered, but wouldn't seek it out."

"Drinkin this with my corn dog. And a bum. Pours up a dark hued orange/gold with endless solid white head. Ok lacing. Smells of citrus, that's it. Tastes of smoked pork, lemon peel, sour lemon, light malts. Light bodied. Crispy smooth carbo. Not too shabby"

"Hazed golden straw, big rush of bubbky white head that took a bit to calm down... even felt lik eit grew after thr pour was complete. Scent leads with firm notes of smoke, not very distinguished as the type of wood used, big doughy, bready and yeasty notes, some spice and light fruity tartness. Taste follows suit, smoke up front, bread in the middle, spice and light fruityness on the back end. Lighter side of medium, a touch too bubbly. Interesting, yes... overly memorable, no."
"The flavor dials back the smoke a few levels, thankfully, and lets a bit of light sour and funkiness play through. Hints of tart citrus zest, dried grasses, funky barnyard, and tangy wheat. It's actually pretty well balanced, but the smoke still sticks out from the rest of the beer. Bubbles are ample, and the body of Gotlandsdricka is medium-light on the palate. Clean finish with a hint of smokiness and light fruit. Overall, I found this Jester King offering to be an interesting addition to their lineup. Although it's not something I'll be seeking out again (and not worth the $13 price tag), I'm glad I got a chance to try it. Palate-expanding, to say the least."

"This is a medium to lighter bodied brew with an effervescent level of prickly, lively carbonation. The alcohol is well integrated and the level of carbonation helps to move and blend the flavors. This is a curious and diffrent sort of brew. I admittedly researched this style prior to gettin the chance to try it and i was expecting a juniper inclusion that seemed absent here. I gotta admit, the lack of juniper character might be the reason I enjoyed this. Throwing juniper into this mix would have been a trainwreck im sure. This isnt a beer I see myself getting thirsty for or craving. However, i wouldnt avoid having it again sometime either."

"VERY GOOD, WORTH TRYING!"
""
"O: Dear god the flavor of this beer is just terrible that it made me gag on the first sip. Just nasty."
""
"Decent, and I get what they are trying to do. Though not something I am coming back to. I think the ""house yeast"" that JK is using, shows itself best/is more developed here. That is a shame, because it does not mingle well with the rest of the beer."
""
"I definitely recommend this to anyone. Jester King says it's giving the beer ""additional fermentation with wild yeast and souring bacteria. We presently have a version of Gotlandsdricka that we inoculated with wild yeast and bacteria aging in oak barrels."" I can't wait!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I guess it's a bit hard to rate against style when there isn't else like it. Never the less, not a bad beer. The smokiness is restrained, while the yeast is rather prevalent."
""
""
""
"O-a very nice take on the smoked beer style but a little more sweetness would balance this one out better and it is rather bitter."
""
""
""
""
"Moderate level of smoke, well integrated and not overbearing. The juniper and gale are subdued, and come off more as general spice than anything, with some light bitter phenolics as well. Aftertaste of honeyed malt and soft oak smokiness, a mellow wood-derived astringency cuts through the ample and frothy carbonation. As a historical recreation of an ancient simple smoked ale, it's definitely interesting (especially as a Swede myself) but a little one-note overall."

"D: Difficult to compare to style since this is my first Gotlandsdricka. This is an easily drinkable, well-balanced, complex, and yet understated brew. I have had nothing like it and I love it. The drinking experience brings immediately to mind a Viking's existence. Seek it out if you can!"
"""Drink of the good land", eh? This must be Milwaukee's original beer (thank you, Alice Cooper)... Anyway, this stuff pours a hazy gold topped by a couple fingers of white foam. The nose comprises lemon zest, coriander, black pepper, light clove, Belgian yeast, cracked wheat, and a general sense of mild campfire-style smoke. The taste brings in more of the same, with the smoke coming through stronger throughout, creating a fog of sorts on the tongue and fostering an increased sense of earthiness that works with the saison-like surroundings. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, a nice little smoked saison, a unique take on an already varied style. Good times."
"D - An odd beer, but a fairly enjoyable one. I refilled my glass a few times, and while I wouldn't want this often I'd certainly have it again in the future. I'm actually fairly intrigued by the upcoming 'wild' version. Worth checking out if you like smoked beers."

"Awesome Beer Jester King! Way different from the rest of the lineup. I'm glad I bought as much as I did. I hope you decide to brew it again one day."
""
"It reminded my of a mix between a Gratzer and a rustic Hefeweizen. Very rustic and the smoke came out more as it warmed. Didn't get as much of the juniper as I thought I would but maybe that's a good thing. This would pair well with food."
