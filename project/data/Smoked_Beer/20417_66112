3.81,1.6,4,3,4,4.5,4,"Poured out of a pint and a half bottle into a medium sized tasting glass. Very dark garnet color with a dark tan head. Chocolate and faint campfire smoke. First sip is a bit coarse. Second sip reveals an elusive smoke flavor here. Just when you want to say "there it is", it leaves you. Its kind of like a smoke and chocolate punching match. One hits you and before you can realize it, the other flavor hits you. After awhile of drinking you taste pizza crust and some alcohol. Slick and full mouthfeel. Very different take on the old Rauchbier. If you like smoked beer you should give this a try. Nice.","jneiswender","Jan 20, 2012"
3.28,-12.5,4,3.5,3,3,3.5,"Overall, an ok smoked ale, flavors are not too out of sync, but a little sweet and not quite enough smokiness is the right places (nose).","mvanaskie13","Jan 12, 2012"

I really loved the smokiness and how well it blended into the base beer flavors. The smokiness wasn't overwhelming either, typically I love smoke but the milder smokiness really worked well for this one. Very enjoyable beer overall","billab914","Sep 19, 2011"

3.06,-18.4,4,3,3,3,3,"O - Well it wasn't a complete disaster like I'm used to from White Birch. I didn't really like it as there was just too much Tootsie Roll flavor but it wasn't horrible. Wouldn't likely drink again.","AgentZero","Aug 02, 2011"
3.33,-11.2,4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"D - A passable smoked beer. It's in the top tier of White Birch beers I've had, which renders it tolerable.","MasterSki","Jul 12, 2011"
3.9,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,"O - Overall I enjoy how the smoked flavor isn't too overwhelming. I think it does a great job of complementing the other flavors without drowning them out. The smoke goes well with the roast, chocolate, and sweet malt flavors, making for a real treat. I couldn't justify higher category scores, but overall I really enjoy this beer. I'd love to have it on a cold night in late Autumn by a camp fire, or perhaps in a ski lodge next to a roaring fireplace.","greenmonstah","Jul 08, 2011"
2.86,-23.7,4,3,3,2,2.5,"O - Overall I find this beer to be quite mediocre. There are so many better brown ales that aren't overpowered by smoke or as thin as a glass of water. Worst White Birch I've had to date by far.","rudzud","Jul 04, 2011"
3.55,-5.3,3.5,3.5,4,2,3.5,"I love smoked beers so I was intrigued and had to try this. A solid brew.","sethmeister","Jul 03, 2011"
4.25,13.3,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Pours a deep shade of brown that barely lets any light through except faint ruby highlights when light is shined through it. Fluffy tan head shows some promise but is almost gone after the first sip. Smoky the bear would be proud to drink this, smells like smoked wood and a hint of ash. There's a spicy component that I can't quite put my finger on. Chocolate and caramel and some dark fruits lie deep in the background but are present. Quite a complex nose here. Taste is smokey up front but leads into a rich milk chocolate, caramel, and toffee flavor. There's a slight astringent bite that I can't distinguish as smokey phenols or hops. Finishes with an earthy almost herbal character and a smokey chocolatey finish. Smooth creamy mouthfeel, light to medium level of carbonation, medium to full bodied. Wow this is good! The smoke is a nice addition to a thick creamy chocolatey imperial brown ale. Great Job White Birch","johnnnniee","Jun 29, 2011"

3.5,-6.7,3,3,4,3,3.5,"OVERALL: Quite a tasty and enjoyable brew. The other four categories were nothing to write home about, as the nose could have been bolder for an “imperial” and the palate a little heavier and creamier, but the flavor was wonderful. We all really enjoyed this one. Thanks again Doopie!","Jeffo","Jun 09, 2011"
3.97,5.9,4,4.5,3.5,4.5,4,"I'm not a huge fan of smoked beers (or rauchbier's either) but this one treads a fine line and makes it work, it's certainly better than I expect it to be.","deltatauhobbit","May 10, 2011"

4.5,20,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"From Batch No. 2, bottle no. 1008. Sampled on May 1, 2011. It has this gorgeous dark brown pour with a silky head that lingers for awhile and eventually goes away. The smoky aroma comes on strong right away to the point that the sweet malts and hops almost end up playing second fiddle. But this smokiness is definitely not offensive. On the contrary, it is quite enticing. The body is medium to heavy and satisfying. The taste starts out smoky and sweet for the first few sips but then there's this cool peppery-hop bite on the back end. Extremely well-balanced and it sets the bar high for other smoked ales.","puboflyons","Apr 23, 2011"
4.23,12.8,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"I can't help but pine for MORE smoke. Regardless, I like this beer and it's done with a style that you don't usually see in smoked form.","Brad007","Apr 23, 2011"
3.88,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,4,"I like this beer and think it's one of the better beers I've had from White Birch. Solid smoked beer if not an imperial brown.","gford217","Apr 18, 2011"
3.57,-4.8,3.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,"I have yet to come across a smoke beer that I would drink regularly, and this one is no exception.
