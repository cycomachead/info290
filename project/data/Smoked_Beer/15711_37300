4.36,10.9,5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Upon opening, a steam-like, tan haze swirled around inside and just escaping the mouth of the bottle. I expected it to begin foaming, champagne-like, which it did, but not immediately as I had expected, catching me off-guard. The foam was wonderfully effervescent, somewhere between brown and tan, and created a huge head with a frothy top. Happily, the foam died down before I became impatient to drink the beer. A distinct, butterscotch, chocolate and smoke smell wafted up in a fairly full manner, though not quite as much as I would have liked. The butterscotch and mostly chocolate taste was definitely pleasant, too, but also a little bit less than I had hoped for; however, the mixed-in smoky flavor was fantastic. I have had only a few smoky beers, and in all the smoke taste seemed separated from the rest of the taste and kind of industrial or cigarettey. This smoke was clean, like that of a hardwood fire, and subdued but not faint like what would emanate from a hearty fire in the hearth of a well ventilated chimney. A slight flavor of the fire's wood was mixed in with the smoke. Along the way, there were periodic, faint hints of subdued lambic fruitiness, perhaps from the juniper berries, though not discernibly juniper-like. Too bad. The field was a bit or watery than I had expected, based on the richness of the head. Also, though the beer poured a kind of orangey-brown with lots of bubbles, the  effervescence wasn't really discernible. I suppose the bubbles were just too small, so it made a neat appearance, but didn't add to the experience in the mouth. Overall, this was a more than pleasant beer, with a superlative smokiness to it.","Scandahoovian","Jan 28, 2015"

Pours a translucent amber with a fizzy, 1.5 inch, butter-colored head that sizzles and pops as it slowly recedes into a creamy, 1/8th inch cap. Nose is difficult to describe - herbal and spicy, some citric acid and just the merest suggestion of smoke towards the back. Taste expresses smoked malt, but it doesn't come across as being overly meaty. There's also an acidic presence (must be the juniper berries), as well as a slight medicinal character towards the finish. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a prickly carbonation, a slightly oily texture and an astringency that stimulates the salivary glands along the sides of the cheeks. Overall, I find myself pleasantly surprised at how much I like this beer, despite Smoked Beers not really being a style favorite. Definitely a good way to accustom the palate to the style without being assaulted by smoked meat.","Jwale73","Jan 19, 2013"

The smell is rather nice considering that this beer is technically supposed to be past it's prime (March 2010). The smells are mostly a nice roast with a deep chocolate aroma and slight trails of smoked malts. The flavor is pretty damn good, it starts out with a malty sweetness and finished with a decent amount of peat smoke on the tongue. The first sip was much better than the following ones, resulting in the ratings that are seen before you. The mouthfeel was on the watery side IMO due to the flavors on hand.

The smell comprises smoked ham, roasted malts, light toffee, and wheat, though smokey notes dominate. The taste holds notes of everything listed above, though the smoke is toned down slightly, the toffee is joined bvy a light caramel, and the wheat is toasted. The body is a solid medium, with a lightly moderate carbonation and a slightly watery, smooth feel.

The nose is heavily malty with clear notes of chocolate, caramel and some brown sugars. There is also a smokey, peatlike aroma coming through the sweetness. The flavours are noticeably accented by the smokiness from the wood, with dark chocolate, a bitter peatiness, and some subtle sweet fruits from the berries.

Mouthfeel is bright with a medium dense body. The taste opens up with plenty of smoke. I like my smoked beers smoky, and this is very smoky. I love it. It has a big malt body in the middle, followed by a little earthiness. The juniper doesn't stand out and the bitterness is mild, so it leaves plenty of lingering malt in the aftertaste.

Long, earthy finish. The taste is spectacular. Wood, smoke, and bacon. The malt is rich and hearty, but maintains a pleasant dry quality.

As it warms up, there's a light phenolic note. The smoke doesn't dominate the flavor profile as it does in the aroma. It sits well on the palate, fairly light carbonation, smooth feel.

Very dark red-brown color, only if you hold the glass close to a light does the transparency become evident. In the nose it's easy to finger all the smokiness but it's not a one trick pony, behind this lays medicinal witch hazel, cocoa powder fried in butter, campfire ashes, peat moss, cinnamon stick and a touch of caramel and toffee for shock absorption, very light squeak of mixed black fruit scents. Medium-bodied, if you could turn your mouth into a fire burning oven, this is what it would taste like. A metallic cave water, tar and Lapsang Souchong tea leaves keeps it aggressive. The carbonation acts like a thin jet stream through the palate, not steadily stirring the pot but creating turbulence. Piney juniper berry influence. Otherwise, the fruit element is very low, likewise no citrus of note. Anise seed and dried strips of game, less chocolate or caramel. Clean finish with expected big inner mouth perfume.

The smokiness reminds me quite a bit of the best Bamberg brews, but the rauch character isn't as omnipresent as the Schlenkerla brews, possibly not as much as the Spezial brews either. There's a bit of tartness in the flavor which I've had in some other smoked brews. I'm not sure if it's a result of the smoked malt or possibly the yeast, but whatever it is...I like it.

On the palate, significant bitterness and smokiness throughout, although both are most pronounced in the finish. Very dark-roast coffee hits the palate midway through. Flitting along behind everything is an understated fruitiness that I would assume is coming from the juniper berries -- it's quite a welcome addition, as it keeps things from being all dark, hard flavors and instead rounds everything out. Mouthfeel is surprisingly light but overcarbonated. What a unique, interesting, and tasty beer. A smoke-lover's dream but with an extra dimension added with the juniper.

The taste is strong with smoke and burning wet wood, a herbal almost fruity flavor follows and I must assume this is the juniper. These flavors are well supported by a nice nutty malt backbone. The feel is moderate with very prickly carbonation, probably too much carbonation. Finishes with a malty sweetness and some toasted/roasted bitterness. A very nice smokey brew. I am finding myself to be a fan of these types. The carbonation is a bit strong and the flavors would stick out more with softer carbonation.

Once again, the smoke is relatively light and part of a harmonious whole rather than the dominant flavor. The mouthfeel is dry and tannic and medium bodied.

A light fruity character from the mellow hops comes through mid-palate, along with a mild malty sweetness. Body is full but not too thick or sticky. Goes down fairly easy for such a strong, uniquely flavored beer. Definitely a curiosity, but in a good way. Try it for yourself.","ElGordo","Oct 04, 2007"

4.25,8.1,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Pours a slightly-murky deep red / brown with an inch of tan foam that dissolves slowly. Leaves a finger-wide collar and plenty of lacing. The bottle was cellared upright and poured carefully to avoid too much yeast & sediment in the glass. Smells of dry wood smoke with a medicinal undercurrent from the juniper berries. Quite different from the strong, rounded meaty smokiness that's normally associated with the Franconian (German) smoke beers. The flavor is a surprise as well. Medium-dry wood smoke blends with deeply-toasted malts to create strong dry coffee and leather notes. These are somewhat balanced by cool minty & sour overtones from the juniper berries. Finishes dry with medicinal after-tones, inviting another sip. Body is light-to-medium, very crisp and quite clean for an ale. The juniper berries make this a bit of an acquired taste, but the beer is nicely balanced and worth a try for smoke beer fans.","dgallina","Aug 30, 2007"
4.15,5.6,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Poured from a 1pt .9oz bottle ($7.99 at Whole Foods in Columbus). This looked like a substantial beer, dark red copper and hazy, with a thick 3D-ish tan head. The aroma was dark fruits (maybe juniper berries as described on the bottle) and rauchbier smoke. The flavor is dominated by the smoky malts, and the after-taste held a slightly bittersweet tang. Very tasty and long-lasting flavor, maybe it felt thick and coating due to lots of yeasties in the beer. Outstanding beer, very pricy, my first beer from Norway (to my knowledge).","TurdFurgison","Jul 25, 2007"
3.53,-10.2,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"500 ml bottle, bottle conditioned. Brewed with juniper and smoked malts. Dark brown colour, creamy head. The aroma is dominated by smoke (beechwood?) and oak. The flavour is very smokey and woody, with notes of hickory and tar. Dry finish. Smoked beer fans will probably be more excited than I was.","Sigmund","Jun 17, 2007"
