"O – Pilsners are a dime a dozen, but quality pilsners are not.  Even without the smoke component this is an interesting, flavorful, satisfying beer, standing out partly because it is unfiltered.  The smoke adds additional complexity. Very good."

"There is some light smoke on the nose but it is not Schlenkerla or even Spezial intensity. Pours hazy gold under a 2” finely bubbled white foam collar. A very creamy palate with rich malt flavors, light smoke preceding a herbal, dry finish. Medium body and a very, fine soft carbonation that is short of prickly. Its a good beer but it could use a touch more smoke."

"i have not had much smoked pils, this is only the second or third i can recall, but its probably my favorite of the lot. its less smoke heavy, not so rauch and german and intense and campfire based. its a pils first and a smoked beer second, which lets the light grain still be light, and the mouthfeel not smolder into something much heavier than the style asks for. just a slightly brown hue to the golden beer, but definitely more hazy than most pilsener beers out there. the head is small but easily resurrected with a whirl of the glass. the nose and taste both show some sweetness, not as dry as others, and the lager yeast is totally lost along with the crisp finish it usually brings. the smoke, as light as it is here, still drags it on quite a ways in the finish. woody as it is smoky, i like that, and i still taste all the grain, which is really fresh. carbonation is high even though the beer looks flat. a combination of two styles i dont unconditionally love, but this is a great beer, very well balanced for what it is, and as good in terms of overall quality as we all now expect out of evil twin. i could drink several of these in a sitting, which may be the greatest testament to its appeal."

"O: Fantastic. I wish I had bought a sixer of this. One you could drink easily in a session with friends. Prost."
""

"O: This is a really interesting lager. I doubt that I could drink more than one or two of these at a time, but I could see myself reaching for a beer like this when I wanted something tasty and relatively unique."

"Not a bad beer for a pilsner but the smoke component is pretty much missing-in-action. I would give this a higher score for a pilsner (3.75), but if you're looking for a more prominent smoke aspect, you won't find it here, so therefore, a relatively low score."
""
""
""
"As a whole the beer doesnt taste bad, and some people will probably be content with it. But it just doesn't serve up what I want in either a smoked beer or a pils."

"Something a German Texan might really love, nice job choosing the name. A really nice smoked beer, with a kinda rough aftertaste that invites (urges!) you to take another sip."

"12oz bottle with BTLD 04/22/14 stamped on the neck. Pours a cloudy amber color with a half inch of head. Looks like an IPA, basically. Lots of lacing. The aroma is smokey with some meat and cherry wood aromas. Some booze and maybe even some apricots. The taste is lots of smoke, charred wood, cherry, and malts. Very woody and earthy. Finishes with some more wood and smoked malts. Some floral hop notes. Medium bodied with not much of an alcohol presence. Overall, solid Smoked Beer I'd certainly buy again. Not quite up there with some of the better Rauchbiers but a Smoked Pilsner is an intriguing take on the style."
"One of the lighter smoked beers I've had. Nothing spectacular, but a fairly drinkable brew."

"Cool style and punch given to the ordinary pilsner, but its flavor profile isn't overwhelming and still stays firmly in the pilsner territory."
"Overall, an interesting beer. I thought the smoke would come into play more, but it's well-balanced and tasty regardless. Evil Twin succeeds very well at making unique and surprising beers, while keeping them balanced and drinkable."
""
""
"Overall this beer does seem to be just a bitter Pilsner with hints of smoke. Really wanted more smoke but I did enjoy it regardless."
""
""
""
""
"Surprising to see such a clean golden color from the beer, the notions of smoke evokes images of brown beer. Its modest haze and cottony froth never lets the eye in on its darker and rewarding secrets within."
""
""
"Overall: A pretty solid twist on a Pilsener. The smoke adds an interesting kick without overwhelming the soft pils malt notes."
""
""
""
""

"Smoky.. Light in color and relatively foamy. Smell is definitely smoky with some light maltiness in the background. Pilsner flavor is there but overpowered by the bitterness of the smoke. I dig it... Although if you're not into rauchbiers or smoke you won't like this. Overall.. A very pleasant surprise.. Look forward to trying the ashtray heart now."

"A refreshing pilsner with an interesting hint of smoked malt."
"Overall: I like smoked beers so picked up one of these as Evil Twin just started distribution in Minnesota. Not a very good first impression, kind of a mixed bag taste with only a hint of smoke flavor."
""
"Easy to drink, appealing to people that normally don't drink pilsners because they're boring (aka me!).. This is full of flavor, and although it seems absurd to have a sweet, hoppy, smoky beer all in one - it works, and it works well."
""
"Overall: I wasn't even in the mood for this and I really enjoyed it. It's definitely not something I'd want more than once though."
""

"O - A decent beer. The smoke tends to overpower the other flavors. Still worth trying."
""
"The smoked taste and the light carbonated style was very balanced for me."
""
"EDIT - Having now read some of the reviews below describing the smoke flavor as ""light", I'm wondering if there may be some batch variation or perhaps something with the particular bottle I drank."
""
""
"Pours a hazy yellow with a foamy orange-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. A foamy lattice of lace coats the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, citrus fruit, and slight smoke aromas. Taste is much the same with malt, citrus zest, and slight smoke flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with fairly subdued smoke qualities and an interesting citrus presence that I wasn't expecting."
""
"I'm not a pilsner fan, but a huge smoked beer fan. This is a mix of both, but leans quite a bit more towards the pilsner end. A very hoppy one at that. An interesting beer and well done. Worth a try."
""
"Taste-Pale malt,sharp noble hop note,wispy, barely there smoked malt, but enough to provide a nice depth of flavor. Price is a bit prohibitive, but a nice match for a loaded hot dog or burger."
"I am so excited to taste this particular ale. Not because of the notoriety of its brewer, but due to the unorthodox nature of an offering as odd as a smoked pilsner. All of the smoked beers I've tried have been heavier darker ales but this is a light pilsner style beer, I am quite perplexed. The pour is that of a traditional pilsner, golden straw yellow color with a white head and little lacing. The nose of this beer is my favorite thing about it. There is all the sweet simple aromas of a well made pilsner accented by the very natural organic smell of smoke. The aroma makes me salivate and beg to taste. The flavir is exactly what the nose promised, just not as dynamic. The beer is balanced and very well reminiscent of the style and the smoke is natural and adds complexity unlike the smoke on many lesser beers. This is a great beer that begs to be drank and enjoyed. Unorthodox does not always work....This time it does."

"I wasn't impressed at all at first sip, bug it grew on me pretty fast. Is this beer worth four bucks a single? No. At the same time, there's a surprising amount of different flavors to be found in this brew, making it the best pilsner I've had, probably. The smoke, the sweetness, the hops -- enjoyable beer, especially for a style I'm normally left unimpressed with. I can understand the score of this beer though, if nothing else but the high price. (4/5)"
"12 ounce bottle into lager glass, bottled on 11/13/2013. Pours moderately hazy/cloudy pale golden amber color with a 1-2 finger dense and rocky white head with incredible retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a large amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of lemon zest, orange zest, pear, biscuit, cracker, wood smoke, herbal, floral, grass, light pine, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance of malt, hop, and smoke notes; with good strength. Taste of lemon zest, orange zest, pear, biscuit, cracker, wood smoke, herbal, floral, grass, light pine, light honey, and yeast earthiness. Light floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon/orange zest, pear, biscuit, cracker, wood smoke, herbal, floral, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance of malt, hop, and smoke flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and moderately crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice smoked pilsner. All around good balance of malt, hop, and smoke flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"O: Hands down one of the best smoked beers I have tried. Crisp clean and a refined smoke that enhances the flavor rather than resemble liquid smoke. Easy drinkability that really delivers."
""
""
""
"A little bit out of control, but also perhap a bit old possibly. Still there's something to enjoy here, it's a neat combination though, just wish the smoked quality was much more rich and noticeable."

"Mouthfeel is good- medium light body, crisply carbonated. This is certainly a very interesting take on a pilsner and perhaps something a cowboy would drink."
""
""
"Excellent beer, perfect level of smokiness that still gives room for other flavors, definitely an experience that paid off."
""
""
""

"No head really with decent lacing on a murky golden with slight copper hue body. Aroma is strongly smokey and hint of mesquite and only light smoked meat presence, some grass as well. Flavors present and interesting mix of orange and lemon citrus fading in and out with smoked meats and campfire flavors. A rapidly changing and dynamic flavor. medium body and moderate carbonation. Very unique and easy to drink for the style. definitely worth trying."
""
""
"Overall... a very nice beer, bitterness is present in a light style, refreshing beer being a smoked pilsner. Well executed idea. To repeat."
""
""
"The label says a smoked pilsner,that doesn't seem to fit this beer much.Poured into a becker a slight hazed honey color with a large blooming sticky white head that left multiple broken rings of lace as it settled into a frothy mass.Citrusy hops and mild toasted grain stand out most with the smoke being pretty faint.Quite dry on the palate with leafy and citric hops standing out mostly with faint smoke in the finish.A full bodied beer it goes down pretty easy.I like this beer,it's not alot like a pilsner in the flavor and aroma department,and it's not very smokey,still it's pretty damn good and great on a hot humid day like today."
""
"Pours a hazy, gold color. 1/2 inch head of a white color. Good retention and great lacing. Smells of smoke, hops, hint of citrus, sweet malt, and a hint of pale malt. Fits the style of a Smoked Beer. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes sharply of smoke, pale malt, sweet malt, and slight hop. Overall, the smoke is distinct but not overwhelming, and other flavors are distinguished. This is a very session-able beer."
""
""

"Needs more malt or less smoke."
"Taste has smoke from head to tail, to my utter surprise. Beyond that, sweet upfront, touch of citrus in the middle, reasonably balanced closed, bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is soft and smooth, and drinkability is easy. Nice brew, and delivers the advertised smoke. Two thumbs up!"
""
"O: I found this beer to be very enjoyable and drinkable because the smoked flavors in the taste were not overpowering. This beer seems like it would pair well with barbecued food because it is clean and has some refreshing properties."
"O: I really enjoyed the fact that the smokiness of this beer was not overly intense or too over the top, it kept the beer approachable and easy to enjoy. The aroma of the beer is slightly one dimensional but the flavors are more complex and interesting - this is just what I would expect a smoked pilsener to be. A little too intense to be an easy drinker or a sessionable beer but I would definitely like to have this one again, preferably with some BBQ."
""
""
"Overall: A little too sweet and lacks some crispness, but the smoked malts add an interesting dimension and were a nice complement to the pilsner malt"
""
""
""
""
"Interesting. I don't know if it works beautifully, but its good and worth a taste."
""
""
"D - Interesting mix of pilsner and smoked beer, but it works. Pretty good balance."
""
"O - For those who can't handle or feel overpowered by super smokey beer, but still appreciate smoke, this is a create place to look. It pairs well with, as the name suggests, cowboy food. I'll probably grab a couple more since I'm a fan of southwestern US food."
""
""
""
"Overall: I enjoyed this beer, it was a pleasurable and memorable experience. This is an extremely well balanced beer, and if I find it I will definitely go for another."

"Home, home on the range... This stuff pours a very lightly hazy straw topped by over a finger of lightly off-white froth. The nose comprises dark smoke, light plastic, very light wheat, and very light grass. It's understandable that the smoke is front and center, but there isn't much else going on at all. Still, nice smoke... The taste brings in more of the same, though now the smoke is hammy, less plastic-y. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, an enjoyable smoked pilsner, something that shows that you can, indeed, smoke a pilsner without completely losing sight of the base (though, admittedly, the smoke seems meant to o'erpower all else). Not bad at all."
"Anyone with an appreciation of the smokes will like this one. Worth the dollars to try once, maybe more."
""
""
"If you like smoke, you'll really love this beer. After the initial flavor of paler malts, the smoke completely takes over. The swallow features a strong medicinal flavor--a real shame. Full body, particularly for the pilsner style. Good carbonation."

"Served from bottle into a COAST Willi. Poured a slightly hazy red-orange with a one finger white head that subsided to half a finger slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, wheat, smoke, smoked meat, and grain. The flavor was of sweet malt, smoked meat, smoke, wheat, and spice. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a good brew. The smokiness on this one really stands out and makes it quite intriguing upon first investigation. I am a big fan of smoked brews when they are done correctly and this one seems to be spot on for what I enjoy. Nice smoky flavors with a nice kiss of sweetness to keep your palate from getting overwhelmed easily. This made it quite easy to drink and would make it easy to drink in large quantities at a cookout. An absolute must try for any fan of the smoke. You won’t regret doing so."
"Poured into a Stone gargoyle pint. Pours a orange golden amber with a thin, fine light white head with great persistence and lacing. Light aroma of smoke, smoked meat and faint sweet malt. Flavor starts with nice wood smoke which gradually reveals pleasant biscuit malt and hops. Nice persistant smoky after taste. Great flavor progression and integration. Medium bodied with good creaminess. This is a very nicely made smoked ale. I would definitely return to this if the bomber price point weren't so painful."
