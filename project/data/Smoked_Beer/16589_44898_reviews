"Very dark, nearly black colored body topped with a thin, creamy head. Smells of chocolate malt, mellow smoke, and char. The flavor is smokier, though it never gets all that smokey really. Chocolate, coffee roast, a slight sweetness, and some light black malt dryness. Satisfying, medium-plus body with some nice fluffiness. No hint of booze - in fact, it was surprising to see how strong it was. Better as it warms closer to room temperature. I didn't find this to be as bold as some other people, but it was certainly enjoyable."
"This was a well-balanced smoked beer, so considering the last review of it (since mine) was over a year ago, and considering most negative reviews were long before that, maybe Spring House improved their recipe. Or maybe I just liked this beer."

"D- I'm very glad to have a 2nd glass waiting for me thanks to the 750ml bottle. A better than average porter with great looks, taste, smells, though I graded the mouthfeel lacking it was silky smooth. I feel this could be a niche porter for some, it met mine. The amount of smoke was perfect for me and not at all overbearing. Glad to have had this one, would definitely grab again."
"D: Slowww. Finding this perfect for this snowy winter night with a whole game of hockey to watch. Through a whole review and not even half way through the first glass. Very enjoyable beer. Again, this beer has distinct notes of tobacco and smoke so if you shy away from those flavors, I would shy away. I for one love the smokey, woody notes and absolutely love this B-Sides creation from Spring House."
"Drinkability- It would be tough for me to have more than two or three of these though. At a rocking 9% it's a bit powerful and the smokiness can be a bit overpoweirng. Overall it's a pretty solid brew coming from right outside my home county."
"I've been waiting to try this one for a while and I was pleasantly pleased to find a well made Smoked Porter here that kept the smoke heavy in the nose but more subdued in the taste, which is just the way I like them. Drinkibility was decent as well, despite the heavy roasted aspect, but I was more than happy to share this growler as the whole thing would have been a little too much. Nice effort here."
"This is a medium bodied brew with a moderate level of carbonation. The star in this offering is no doubt the heavily roasted/smoked barley. Considering the abv, it is quite drinkable and every once and awhile it reminds you of what it is without being too forward or obnoxious. Sign me up for a glass of this whenever it is available but I dont think I could drink more than one. There is a long lingering aftertaste of smoked barley left in the mouth which is really enjoyable regardless of whether or not this style of beer is your thing. The finish of this brew is a bit drying which really helps to playout the flavor of the smoke here. I would recommend you give this a try, I enjoyed it."
"Edit: Having this on tap was incredible, possibly the best beer I've ever tasted. We opened a growler of this this next night, and I would rate taste and smell both 4.5 only one day later in the growler. Three days after that, taste is a 4.5 still, but smell drops to a 4.0. Growlers were filled at the same time, but not pressure filled or even in their growler. Could have just been my glass, but the beer is definitely better on tap."
"Matt handed this to me with a two fingers' worth of deep-tan head with very good retention. Color was a deep-brown with NE-quality clarity and cola highlights. Nose was redolent with smoke from 100% applewood, courtesy of a local butcher shop. Mouthfeel was thick and full with a lot of smoke on the tongue. Finish was dry, smoky and simply delicious. Nice lacing throughout. I could definitely envision this with some smoked Gouda."
"D - This is about as extreme as you can get for a smoked beer. But you know what? I like it... a lot, actually. While it's not something you can pound, this is still pretty damn drinkable for what it is. I had no problem putting down about two pints of this in one sitting."
"D - A strong smoked ale, I would not seek out and probably couldn't handle I whole pint if I had to. The heavy handed use of smoke detracts from this beer, other than that it is a pretty tasty porter."
"D-A decent smoked porter that I can appreciate for giving something like this a try but man...tone it down a bit. This is palate bashing. No way in hell could I finish or want to finish a growler of this....heck 5 of us could even do it! With the differences in ratings between last years batch and this years maybe things have changed....and if they have it has been for the worse."
"D: I can't imagine getting through an entire growler of this beer. If you like a good smoked beer, this is definitely worth checking out."
"well worth trying if you find the opportunity."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1 1/4"" light brown head over the cloudy reddish dark brown brew. Thick frothy head falls ever so slowly, with heavy coating lacing. Aroma is SMOKE, reminds me I have a Schlenkerla in the fridge. That is a good thing. Taste starts sweet, balancing with bitterness quickly, and smoke is present throughout. Mouthfeel is smooth and easy, and drinkability is great as well. Have to love a smoked beer that actually is smoked from beginning to end!"
"Overall this was an outstanding smoked porter, that although have a mishap in transportation I think held up very well. A little brewery I have never heard of is putting out some really top shelf stuff here, well for them as this is simply superb."
"d: What a treat to find this in my home county. They struck a very nice balance with this one. Well worth seeking out."
