"O: Underwhelming and misnamed. Easily the least impressive of the Mutiny Fleet I've encountered (and the only one on-tap)."

"Drink- I liked it. Def. above average but just need a bit more complexity to me."

"The body was dark brown and opaque like almost every other porter around, but this one had a pretty big tan colored head too. The smell was sweet chocolate, hints of coffee, and very mild smoke. The taste was fantastically smooth, with lots of vanilla, toffee, chocolate, and a smoky finish. The mouthfeel was velvet like, and soothing to the maximum. Very impressive offering from a brewery that usually does not entice me enough."

"Tasty and enjoyable, but lacking complexity and rather off style."

"Overall a good drinking beer, however, it was lacking the smoke for a smoked beer. Would go well with a little ""Deep Purple"" playing in the background."

"A fairly subtle smoked beer that grew on me. Not one I would seek out though..."

"O - Smoke on the Water is an interesting beer, it is quite different from the other smoked porter I've had (Stone's) and is worth a taste for the curious. The smoke is present, but definitely not to the level one would think from the name and packaging. An enjoyable brew nonetheless!"
"Still, this is a nice little quaffer from Hugh of Halethorpe. Generally tasty, but lacking any complexity whatsover. And, really?, what's wrong with that. If you see it on the shelf ot the tap, check it ut for thine own self. Smoke onthe Water. The fire in the sky."

"Flavor is sweet choclate and molasses then rolls to roasted malt and finally a little bit of campfire ash. Very little mind you. As a smoked porter this fails, but as a robust porter, I like it. Dont expect smoke but it is a solid malty big porter that isnt boozy but seems big on each sip."

"O: this brew is tasty, but kind of uninspired. The smoke doesn't really take center stage, much more of a subtlety than its namesake infers."

"drinkability: good beer, just not a smokey as the title of the beer."
"O: Pretty good beer. Not incredibly interesting or complex, but fairly solid. A little too sweet for my taste, but still good."
"Overall a tasty warming porter. I think the smoke is an asset and not at all overwhelming."
"O - Not bad. Not the best smoked porter I've ever had, but certainly not the worst. Delivers what it says it will."
"looks amazing, very dark with dark head, very generous foam. Smells nice a smokey like a barbeque. Taste is okay however the booze knocked my socks off in a bad way.. very solventy. Counldn't finish the beer."
"Overall this is far too sweet, far too strange tasting (sweet grape juice and smoke just don't mix), and not what I look for in this style at all. It's drinkable but also kind of gross, I won't be having this again."
"Overall, nice balance. Easy to drink. I enjoyed."
"84."
"A nice medium bodied porter, very drinkable and definitely a must try for the beer advocate."
"O: A very likeable beer. I could see myself sipping this on a cold winter evening while sitting in front of the fire."
"Overall, a nice smoked porter that is a really solid portrayal of the style. I think the age of the beer actually was added to this rather than subtracted. Nothing outstanding but very solid."
"Black pour with a nice brown head. Retention isn't great. Smoky smell, light chocolate and roasted malts. The taste is really smokey. Like the smell, there are hints of chocolate. Balanced taste, but a bit light and thin. Medium bodied. Carbonated well. Dry aftertaste and no hint of alcohol. Very tasty, very drinkable. Not a big taste, but it's put together very well."
"O: If you don't like smokey beers, please look elsewhere. As for me, I grill fish on cedar planks several times a month, maybe more, and I plan on getting a couple of bottles of this for those outings."
"nice aroma and flavors."
"I did not like this beer as a smoked beer. I'm sorry, I just didn't get much smoke from it at all. But I made appreciative ""I really DO LOVE PORTER!"" noises as I drank the rest of my share =)"
"Rich aroma is smoky with strong tones of sweet chocolate, molasses and quality coffee and hints of licorice and caramel. It pours a warm deep brown with a fairly thick fine-bubbled tan head. Delightful, smoky flavor has tones of caramel, chocolate, toffee and molasses with a bit of coffee. Texture is silky smooth and on the thick side, and leaves a nice tingle."
"Overall this is a good, malty porter with some smoke. I've tried several smoked porters; this one stacks up."
"This is a very drinkable, delicious and balanced smoked porter. This would be a great place to start if you're just getting into smoky beers, the smoke here is just right."
"(133rd)"
"Low on smoke again in the flavor department, unfortunately. However, the beer overall is actually pretty tasty. Bready, fruit-laden yeastiness with malts that are soft and chocolaty. ABV is well hidden and has a soft, lightly creamy mouthfeel - carbed just about right. Kiss of smoke and light vanilla as it warms and has just the right amount of sweetness. I like it, would bump up some more though if it were more smoky."
"Smoke on the Water is a great offering for anyone wanting to have a taste of smoked beer without traveling too far down that rabbit hole. I hesitate to consider it a 'training wheel' smoke beer, however, because the smoke is far from it's main or most marked feature, it's simply one of many (and probably the least appreciable at that). Still, this recipe has really brought out the best in both smoked-things and porters. Recommended."
"D - a nice porter. Easy drinking. Would've been better on a colder night, and could use a little more smoke but still a decent beer."
"Overall an extremely tasty brew. If only all smoked beers tasted like this."
"The CPJ"
"I love smoke beers. Personally, I think I've found one of my favorite styles. The Rauchbier is where it's at in my opinion. Heavy Seas did a decent job for this smoked porter. The store manager at the Brier Creek Total Wine & More in North Carolina recommened this to me. Good choice."
"This would go well with a good cheese burger. A burger with some swiss cheese and some onions paired with this would match well with the smoky flavor. Don't forget the bacon as well. This would also be great with steak, even better with a steak that was marinated with bourbon."
"Overall, a good beer but could have been much better with some more smoke to it. Easy to drink as is but doesn't leave a big impression. Do recommend. Not avail here in TX so shipped back from Indy. Rotation - not shipping worthy. If avail near me, it would make the occasional rotation as I do love smoke but would be bigger player if they upped the smoke content. [O;Y]"
"D: It's definitely not very smoky, but this is a big, solid, enjoyable porter. If you're looking for something with lots of smoked character, you may disappointed, but it does add a nice bit of depth here. A nice beer despite some style/marketing inconsistencies."
"Drinkability: A good, if a little sweet porter, but not much in the way of smoke in this one. Drinks like an Imperial (higher ABV) porter."
"Pours a dark brown colour with thick tan head. Some small lacing down the glass. Smells of chocolate and roasted malt, but the smoke is quite faint. Flavour is fairly sweet, no smoke really shows up in the aftertaste either. Smooth mouthfeel. I enjoyed this beer, just not enough smoke for a smoked beer."
"Relatively recently at Rattle 'N Hum, NYC. Poured brownish, with two fingers of beige head, great head retention and lacing, and little visible carbonation. Smelled more of dry coffee beans and bittersweet chocolate, and only modestly of smoke. The taste began on a lightly smokey note, followed by a pleasant coffee midpalate and a chocolate/mocha finish. Medium-thickness; non-carbonated and smooth. Very tasty and nicely-balanced beer, but I would like a little more smokiness."
"This is just off the mark in every way, don't bother."
"D - decent flavor and mild feel make it easily drinkable."
"Good porter but nothing that will make me remember it."
"The Mutiny Fleet Series of beers from Clipper City ranges from good (The Great Pumpkin, Hang Ten) to decent (Holy Sheet, Big DIPA, Below Decks) to disappointing (Siren Noire Imperial Chocolate Stout). Smoke On The Water falls squarely into the middle group. Bottom line: worth the first bottle, but probably not worth a second."
"Very drinkable beer, but just not enough smoke for a smoked beer, IMHO."
"D: Average drinkability, again rather lackluster with no hidden surprises or bells. Mediocrity in excitement and just after a few sips this quickly becomes a boring chore and felt there was little if anything left to explore or appreciate. After finishing my early prejudice was justified. Kinda weak for a big series beer that strives to be middle of the road. A small beer packaged in a big bottle doesn't necessarily make it so."
"Taste begins with sweet darkness, rich through the middle, with a lightly bitter close. Still not sure if I'm getting any smoke. Mouthfeel is smooth, and drinkability is good as well. If it says smoke on the label four times, it had better be evident. As a brew, good, but as a smoked beer, fail."
"D: I like my porters to be a little heavier. The flavors were certainly there, it was a fun ride. However, I have enjoyed better beers by Heavy Seas."
"Black with a big white soapy head. Mild smoke aroma. A bit thin for a beer, for the style, but smoke in the taste, a bit of chocolate malt. Ken's bottle. Pleasant enough drinking.Middle of the road in the smoked style.Sweetish smoke, though not overly sweetish."
"It's a pretty easy beer to drink if you're ok with smoke beers. It's high in alcohol, but it comes across gently with only a slight taste and just a hint of warming."
"The beer pours a pitch black color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a rich, chocolate and black malt scent with not much in the way of a smoked malt aroma. It's more sweet with a touch of roasted character. The taste is decent as well. It has a bitter black malt flavor along with a nice chocolate malt presence. The smoked character is tame at best. It's most noticeable in the finish. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a tasty beer, but not much of a smoked ale."
"The beer pours a dark brown color with red highlights and a white head. The aroma is heavy on the smoke, but I also get some roasted malt. Nice aroma, but not real complex. The flavor is better, with a lot of chocolate, roasted malt and smoke. Medium to thick mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A very nice smoked porter."
"Drinkability is pretty good, nice Porter....Don;t see why this is more of a smoked beer than Alaskan Smoked Porter."
"Enjoyed it."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied and carbonation is moderate. Drinkability isn't good for me. Not only was I disappointed by the lack of smoked malt flavor, I found it to have some pretty below average porter characteristics as well. The sugary sweetness that came through was just not good to me. I believe I had the same negative experience with their Big DIPA too so maybe it's something they add to more than one of their bigger beers. Unfortunately this is another one of their big beers I won't be buying again. Reviewing with style in mind doesn't fare well for this beer, it should have had some smoke to it at least."
"Drinkability: A pretty good beer, but it lacks depth to make it truly great. I would be willing to have this again, but it's not a first-choice brew."
"D - Nice enjoyable drink. Was something different for sure with the smoke taste. Didn't have any other real strong flavors or qualities."
"D - I may have to get the bomber or at least try it again during the Library's happy hour. A truly good porter to have for 3 dollars a pint!"
"Notes: Not a bad offering from the Heavy Seas series but not a remarkable one either. And while a decent porter the smoked sense is so small that is almost unnoticeable."
"Don't know much about the ""smoked beer"" style. Never had a beer with smoked malt, that I'm aware of. So this was little harder to review. It wasn't my favorite. It was missing something."
"D: Not very tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, decent kick, not the best representation of style, there are definitely better dark & smoky beers out there that I would choose before this one."
"This was pretty drinkable, not necessarily all at once, but I would be happy to have it again."
"Big two to three finger head on average pour, deep tan in hue yet airy and light, keeps an even surface with no dimpling, lacing shows highly credible stickiness. Jet black color, looks like most imperial stouts. The nose is almost all milk to dark chocolate with coffee ice cream and licorice, so much malt you just start wondering where the smoke is, touch of pork rinds and oats, no significant hops presence, comes across like a chocolaty porter more than a smoked beer. Medium-bodied, firm presence in the mouth if perhaps kinda immobile, albeit without the massiveness. Chocolate, cocoa, mocha in spades, light coffee roast. Sliver of grapefruit citrus helps stiffen things. No real fruit, maybe apricot or peach pit. Carbonation is smooth bubbles up now and then, not a major factor. Candy character doesn't bring out much earth, tobacco or herbal qualities. Maybe some brazil nuts or cashews. Biggest issue is that it's just monochrome with no sense of development or subtler nuances. But tastes good."
"mouthfeel is excellent: keeps things going longer than the flavor profile does on its own. occasionally, however, i get a sort of chalky finish...so i am alternately excited and nonplussed"
"22 ounce bottle. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with an inch tan head. Head retention is good, lacing is decent. Aroma is roasted malt, bittersweet chocolate, molasses, caramel, and smoke. The taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes like roasted malt, chocolate, smoke, and some coffee and burnt/charred malt. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy and has moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's smooth and goes down easy. I think it's a good porter, but not quite smoky enough for me. For being a smoked porter, I think it should have more smoke aroma and flavor in the brew. I've had both Weyerbacher Fifteen and Nils Oscar Rökporter recently, and I think those are both much smokier than this brew. With that being said, I still think this is a pretty decent beer overall."
"An excellent beer, very well balanced with the smoked malt mingling superbly with the other malt characteristics. Alcohol is very well-hidden, and drinkability is hindered only by the heavy-handed and somewhat complex intermingling of flavors as well as the somewhat chewy full body."
"Overall, not as good as I was hoping, but a well made beer nonetheless."
"An interesting flavored beer. Poured grapeish black with a tan head. Smelled smokey, cocoaish taste sort of like a burnt brown ale, considering it was labled as a smoked porter I was expecting something more porterlike. It wasn't a bad flavor by any means but I it didn't knock my socks off either. Would have gone good with some sort of chocolate."
"Overall this was a smooth-drinking smoked porter and another solid beer from the Mutiny Fleet - well worth a shot."
"bomber from OUaV South, Richmond, VA"
"I will choose to review this on the merits as a porter, this really isn't a smoked or even much of a smoked porter. A descent baltic like porter."
"Grabbed a bottle of this at Kappys in Medford tonight. Smoke on the Water pours out a nice black color, with a finger of tan heading. Nose is of moderately dark chocolate, and some brown bread. Very little smoke can be detected in the nose here. Surprisingly the taste has hardly any smoke either, perhaps a hint at best. More dark chocolate, and fruit come through, making this more similar to a straight up American Porter than a smoked one. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy, and drinks well. While this isn't a bad brew, it is simply not what the label claims is. I am sure they did smoke this beer, but there is little evidence to support that theory from the smell or taste. If you are looking for a simple, decent Porter, this one should work. Those seeking the smoke should look elsewhere."
"Drinkability: Personally, I found it to be a flimsy porter imparted with a lackluster smoke character, and therefore an unappealing brew. I tried this a week later out of the bottle at a dear friend's cookout - same results, sadly."
"D: A very drinkable porter, especially for the ABV, although I keep stopping myself from typing stout as this is a robust brew, but not as advertised, at least in the batch this bottle came from as the smoke component is nonexistent. I still liked the beer quite well though as it brings a nice flavor punch of chocolate, coffee, and tobacco hops notes."
"I can hear those crunching opening chords now... This guy pours a pretty much opaque black-brown topped by a nice finger of light tan foam. The nose has some light smokey notes, but mostly it's roasted malts. Not much else in there, really, though some light chocolate and caramel dart hither and yon like frightened hummingbirds. The taste is similarly dominated by the roasted malts, backed-up by some brown sugar, molasses, cocoa, and caramel. A lovely kiss of peat smoke comes in near the middle, surrounding the other flavors, cradling them all the way home. Lovely. The body is a nice medium, with a relatively light carbonation and a sliky smooth feel. One of the best Heavy Seas brews yet, and a very tasty smoked porter overall. Get some!"
"d - A decent smoked beer I'm glad I tried. Would try again."
"D: Very drinkable, enjoyable to drink with a quite delicious aftertaste."
"Iam closer to giving up on the Heavy Series after this offering wich was decent but just not good enough.Poured into a tulip glass a deep dark brown with only a hint of of ruby when held to the light,a fluffy almond colored head atop.Aromas are dominated by smoke,other BA's said not enough smoke....,I say too much,not much else came thru other than some bitter chocolate.Flavors are one dimentional in the smoke category,a hint of unsweetened choclate comes thru, otherwise it has a bit of peppery spice as well.Just not enough going on here,yeah there is a decent amount of smokiness but not much else,Iam losing hope in the Below Decks series."
"drinkability: This is smooth and goes down fast."
"Enjoyable..."
"22oz bottle into a Duvel tulip pours a deep almost opaque black with a decent frothy khaki head that diminishes to a ring and barely leaves any lacing on the glass. Aroma is slight brown malts and just a trace of smoke. The taste is an unusual blend of espresso and smoked malt with just a trace of hops. The beer is on the heavy side of medium with some sticky lingering alcohol. I'll admit, I did not get my hopes up on this one, especially after the Smoked Porter Highland released last year that was so great, oh well, the Mutiny Fleet seems to be getting back to it's not so great roots."
"This pours a watery midnight black with a slight khaki colored head. The smell isn't over powering. I thought it would be smokier. It smells like a rich dark roast coffee. That carries over to the taste. The flavor is rich and coffee like, with little smokiness. It's pretty standard. As for the mouthfeel, it's a little watery compared to other porters. It's appealing but nothing overly special. This one is drinkable but not one of Clipper City's best. The Letter of Marquee is a better option."
"At least on cask, I don't get more then a hint of smoke, but otherwise this is a pretty solid beer. Releasing an imperial porter in the middle of summer seems a bit odd, but otherwise, I thought this latest offering from Clipper City to be very enjoyable."
"Pours a deep brown color with a decent tan head that retains OK and leaves nice lacing. The aroma has a litte dark chocolate and coffee upfront, along with some smoked meat, salt, burnt bread, some blackberry and a little alcohol. The flavor starts out with a bacon and smoked meat flavor, along with a little sea salt, some dark chocolate, espresso, black cherry, burnt bread, and some alcohol. The mouthfeel is moderate, and drinkability is pretty good. Overall a decent smoked porter, not particularly complex or interesting but tasty nonetheless."
"Taste resembles a light smoked porter with hints of coco and lightly hopped. It's little below average for the style. Mainly coco taste with a smoked taste."
"Drinkability: this beer was really a decent porter, but forget the fact this is smoked as there is barley a hint of smokiness here. Not what I expected as I wanted some more smokiness."
"Pours a syrupy, opaque dark brown with a foamy light tan head. The head starts off initially large and billowy before quickly fading to a thin film with one or two large clumps of lacing and a lot of random small spots of lace that slide down the inside of the glass. Aroma is disappointing in the amount of smoke, as it smells like a typical, roast-y porter. Mild sweetness, artificial chocolate-like similar to Siren Noire, attempts to balance out the roasty charred aromas, but unfortunately the smell of stale ashtray dominate, not the type of smoke hoped for. Similar to the recent Rye Porter, the mouthfeel is way off for the style, syrupy and watery, with little carbonation and significantly lacking in overall body. Malt body flavor has a slightly more smokey taste than the aroma would have suggested, but milk chocolate sweetness ends up dominating throughout and in the finish. There also seems to be a potent boozy alcohol burn in the finish, which is disappointing for this abv and style. The aftertaste has the strongest ""smokey"" flavor returning to the unpleasant stale ashtray of the aroma. Not really a great example of a american porter, smoked porter or smoked beer, or whatever you want to call it. Not as bad a beer as my score suggests, but doesn't really compare to beers like Alaskan's smoked porter or even Captain Lawrence's Pleasantville."
