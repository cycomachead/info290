"Overall: The smokiness dominates the flavor, but it is not overpowering. I just think this is a one-dimensional beer. Nice to look at, not that great to drink."

"D - This is an odd beer, it doesn't have much in common with the traditional German smoked beers, but manages to do pretty well... Until the finish. There is a sharp, acrid bitterness that turns the smoke harsh in the aftertaste, if this wasn't present it would be a pretty good beer, but the harshness is hard to ignore."
"Overall: I think the beer is well made for what it is rying to be. It captures enough of the smokiness to make this amber ale different without going overboard or being a full rauchbier which some people may not enjoy."
"O - this beer seems like it would be a good pairing beer, but I am not too impressed with it on its own."
"Overall: As the name suggests, this would be a very nice barbecue beer. Not too heavy given the abv, I'd have another given the chance."

"O: Interesting beer. Nothing I would grab again but it was worth a try."
"O-this is more of an introduction to smoke beers. It's maybe the most faint smoke beer I've ever had, which is amazing because it's one of the strongest ive had too. As an amber ale, it's still just okay,"

"D: A really okay beer. Not great, but an easy drinker for sure. Would absolutely pair well with some smoked or roasted meats, which I will try at some point. Cheers."
"Meh, mild smoke, not much else to offer."
"Very smooth and ceamy. Soft carbonation and medium mouthfeel. I've tried this on draft and found it to be a better drinking experience from the bottle while grilling some meat. This beer pairs well with grilled meats but otherwise doesn't stand up on it's own."
"Overall - Big fan of Bryan Voltagio's cooking and restaurant Volt in Frederick is fabulous. This beer doesn't stand alone very well and is not an easy drinker for summer. Perhaps I should have saved it to sample with a BBQ sandwich or ribs as recommened. I could see how it would pair with that style of cooking since the smoked flavors are very mild and in the backround of this beer and could enhance the flavor of food. Not very sessionable and not a beer to sit with after mowing the yard as its not very refreshing. Definitely something that should not a continued line by Flying Dog unless done in small batches for sale at local BBQ restaurants or eateries."
"Certainly a must have for the beer advocate!"
"Beer is thin in body with a strong dry smoke finish. As far as smoke beers go this is a good one. I enjoy the mild sweetness up front with a dry smoky finish. It gets a little harsh at the end with the more you drink but I'd have it again. Would make a great cooking solvent."
