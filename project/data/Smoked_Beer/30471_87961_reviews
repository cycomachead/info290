"Overall: OK, but I was expecting something a bit more robust. Even so, if you like your beers smoky without being a full-on rauchbier-type thing then this is worth a look. Doubly so if you like stouts and porters even if it is a bit on the thin side. Worth a try, but really needs more body, more alcohol or, ideally, more of both. My ratings reflect the nature of the beer - it's a bit all over the place but not necessarily the worse for it."

"Szczerze powiedziawszy wybierając do degustacji dymiony porter liczyłem na dużo, dużo wędzonego dymu i ""ognia", w tym porterze tego nie było, (choć z drugiej strony nikt nie mówił, że będzie dym z wędzonki). Być może moje oczekiwania były zbyt wysokie w stosunku do tego piwa, a może po prostu brakuje mu jeszcze trochę."

"Tried this from a can straight from the fridge at home. I thought it improved as it got less cold. The aftertaste is long and toasted. The colour is great. The head disappears quickly."
"-- Honestly, I don’t know what to make of a British porter at 5.4%: not quite sessionable, not strong. It’s a bit thin (though maybe not the for the ABV?) and dies on the finish. They want the smoke to make it interesting but there’s not enough of it to do that. Drinkable, but ultimately dull. Wisp more than smog. 3.75"
"Would I buy this beer again? Yes."

"Smooth, very rich, gentle - lightly smoked but great depth. Like Dark Isle"

"O: kept things balanced by not overdoing the smoke, a (comparatively) low strength smoked dark doppelbock."

"Great smoked porter. Doesn't shy away from the smoke but doesn't get subjugated by it either. Best of both worlds really."

"Pours a hazy dark brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, smoked malt, and caramel aromas. Taste is much the same with cocoa, char, and smoke flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of smoke bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with a really nice smoke presence that comes through especially well in the taste."

"Mouthfeel: Medium bodied. Light yet veering on creamy. Gentle carbonation."

"330ml bottle. Shaker glass. Bright brown color, tan head. Foam is creamy & shows good retention. Roasted malt & burnt chocolate aromas. Sweet peated malt, herbal & minty intense flavors displayed in a creamy upfront. Light body. Moderate carbonation. Oily to watery texture. Low & gentle bitterness, subtle smoky notes & hints of licorice candy in the middle linger into the finish. Herbs & dark chocolate on the aftertaste."

"Nice one - a dark, balanced brew with more than a whiff of smoke to it. Looks good, while the aroma and flavour are dominated by woodsmoke and roasted grain. Dry and yeasty with a well-judged bitterness. Body is alright but could be a shade thicker. Tasty; not quite on the level of a Schlenkerla but a quality effort. If smoke is your thing then this is worth a punt."
"Overall: not a bad smoked beer at all - unfortunately it isn't my preferred style of beer. That makes the price of around AU$180+ per case of 24 x 330mL (2014) just a tad high."
"Overall: pretty decent stuff. It's solidly made, and the smoke, while subtle, is used to good effect."

"A fairly unbalanced beer and one that featured the dreaded taste of cured ham, although thankfully not as strong as with some of the German smoked beers out there. Still not a good beer sadly."

"Enjoyable stuff, quite light for a porter..."
"Never tried these guys before but heard some good wraps so anyway it pours the darkest brown hue with a rather creamy one finger head that stays and leaves some subtle lacing,the smell is peat and I mean light peat with milky chocolate,smoked malts and herbal hops,the mouthfeel is creamy,medium bodied and slightly overcarbonated with tastes of some smokey dark malts,milk chocolate,ripe dark fruits and finished with a cherry chocolate bittersweetness and overall out of the ones I've tried this was the one I felt worth reviewing and definitely a hidden gem against their more well known line up worth a buy cheers."
"Overall: I am very happy to have gotten it on tap. Smooth body and taste makes it an easy drinking, yet complex smoked porter. I do love how the smoke is a compliment to the overall taste and not forcefully taking the reins."

"Medium body and a bit oily. Reminded me of Schlenkerla but hoppier."
