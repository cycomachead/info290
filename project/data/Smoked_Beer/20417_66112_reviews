"O: White Birch has shifted from ""trainwreck"" to just shy of mediocre. It is actually a positive trend, but I don't understand why they release most of what they have made..."

"Bottle from Winooski. Could be the best WB I have had. Significant smoke and not overpowering, with great malt base, chocolate,Dry hopped. It works. Very Good drinkability. Middling mouthfeel. BBQ aroma. Dark brown bodied with some retained head and lace."
""
"O - Sub-par beer. This beer is more ashy than smokey with an oddly harsh aftertaste.Its drinkable, but not very tasty."
""
"This beer is great for anyone who loves this style and definitely worth trying!"

"Over a year old (Feb 2011) but flavors seem clean. Apparently just the one batch #1 (Bottle count 1032). From the 22 oz bottle bought at"
"Surprising chocolate to the taste--I didn't detect it in the smell. Semisweet cocoa flavor in the swallow. Rich bodied with a decent carbonation level. Not much smoke to the taste. Easy to drink and deceptively mild."
"this beer is OK, it has slightly above average taste points but overall is pretty average. looking at the reviews (especially on the head) it seems this may not be consistent batch to batch."
""
"Overall: a nice flavored brown ale with just enough smoke to make it tasty alongside some BBQ."
""
"Poured out of a pint and a half bottle into a medium sized tasting glass. Very dark garnet color with a dark tan head. Chocolate and faint campfire smoke. First sip is a bit coarse. Second sip reveals an elusive smoke flavor here. Just when you want to say ""there it is", it leaves you. Its kind of like a smoke and chocolate punching match. One hits you and before you can realize it, the other flavor hits you. After awhile of drinking you taste pizza crust and some alcohol. Slick and full mouthfeel. Very different take on the old Rauchbier. If you like smoked beer you should give this a try. Nice."
"Overall, an ok smoked ale, flavors are not too out of sync, but a little sweet and not quite enough smokiness is the right places (nose)."
""
"O- A nice smoked beer that I enjoyed, definitely a nice extra. I feel this would be worth trading for again."
""
"Full and creamy mouthfeel, finishes with a carbonation bite. Cocoa, smoke and leather lingers. Great beer."

"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation being moderate. Overall I thought it was a very good beer. I really loved the smokiness and how well it blended into the base beer flavors. The smokiness wasn't overwhelming either, typically I love smoke but the milder smokiness really worked well for this one. Very enjoyable beer overall"
"O - I enjoyed this beer quite a bit as I love smoked beer so to me this one was very easy to drink with its good taste worth trying if you see it around"
"O - Well it wasn't a complete disaster like I'm used to from White Birch. I didn't really like it as there was just too much Tootsie Roll flavor but it wasn't horrible. Wouldn't likely drink again."
"D - A passable smoked beer. It's in the top tier of White Birch beers I've had, which renders it tolerable."
"O - Overall I enjoy how the smoked flavor isn't too overwhelming. I think it does a great job of complementing the other flavors without drowning them out. The smoke goes well with the roast, chocolate, and sweet malt flavors, making for a real treat. I couldn't justify higher category scores, but overall I really enjoy this beer. I'd love to have it on a cold night in late Autumn by a camp fire, or perhaps in a ski lodge next to a roaring fireplace."
"O - Overall I find this beer to be quite mediocre. There are so many better brown ales that aren't overpowered by smoke or as thin as a glass of water. Worst White Birch I've had to date by far."
"I love smoked beers so I was intrigued and had to try this. A solid brew."
"Pours a deep shade of brown that barely lets any light through except faint ruby highlights when light is shined through it. Fluffy tan head shows some promise but is almost gone after the first sip. Smoky the bear would be proud to drink this, smells like smoked wood and a hint of ash. There's a spicy component that I can't quite put my finger on. Chocolate and caramel and some dark fruits lie deep in the background but are present. Quite a complex nose here. Taste is smokey up front but leads into a rich milk chocolate, caramel, and toffee flavor. There's a slight astringent bite that I can't distinguish as smokey phenols or hops. Finishes with an earthy almost herbal character and a smokey chocolatey finish. Smooth creamy mouthfeel, light to medium level of carbonation, medium to full bodied. Wow this is good! The smoke is a nice addition to a thick creamy chocolatey imperial brown ale. Great Job White Birch"
"Overall a very fine example of the style"
"I'd buy this again."
"OVERALL: Quite a tasty and enjoyable brew. The other four categories were nothing to write home about, as the nose could have been bolder for an “imperial” and the palate a little heavier and creamier, but the flavor was wonderful. We all really enjoyed this one. Thanks again Doopie!"
"I'm not a huge fan of smoked beers (or rauchbier's either) but this one treads a fine line and makes it work, it's certainly better than I expect it to be."
"Another very surprising and interesting ber from MA. I really liked this one. So did my wife who hijacked my glass when she came home and wouldn't give it back. This beer is unlike any other I have ever had I feel happy to have tried this one!"
"Overall good, not too heavy on the smoke, bit of brine is not the best, but nice malts and rich body."
"This one seems a bit expensive ($9) for what I got out of it."
"From Batch No. 2, bottle no. 1008. Sampled on May 1, 2011. It has this gorgeous dark brown pour with a silky head that lingers for awhile and eventually goes away. The smoky aroma comes on strong right away to the point that the sweet malts and hops almost end up playing second fiddle. But this smokiness is definitely not offensive. On the contrary, it is quite enticing. The body is medium to heavy and satisfying. The taste starts out smoky and sweet for the first few sips but then there's this cool peppery-hop bite on the back end. Extremely well-balanced and it sets the bar high for other smoked ales."
"I can't help but pine for MORE smoke. Regardless, I like this beer and it's done with a style that you don't usually see in smoked form."
"I like this beer and think it's one of the better beers I've had from White Birch. Solid smoked beer if not an imperial brown."
"I have yet to come across a smoke beer that I would drink regularly, and this one is no exception. It is an interesting experiment and worth picking up if you want to drink something different, but not as exciting as some of the other beers White Birch makes."
"Enjoyed it."
"Overall I feel this it is a good smoke beer but the ABV I think doesn't mesh well with the smoke taste. The mix of smoke and alcohol don't work for me but this is a well crafted beer if you like smoke beer you should try it as it may work for you"
