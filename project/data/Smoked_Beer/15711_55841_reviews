"I like it, it was very good even if there was nothing but soccer on the tele."
"I don't know if I would sit on this one... I'd try to drink it as fresh as possible... this seemed to have a little age on it, however, I suppose that's to be expected as this was a tap takeover of Norwegian beers - probably had to sit on a few kegs while building stock for this."

"Bottle 500ml shared two ways. Amber pour with a nice thick white head. Aroma is smoky and meaty with some spices (cloves?). Very tasty and powerful smoke grain and yet very light bodied. As close to Schlenkerla as it can get, very surprises by this one."
"O - Pretty good, smoke is definitely on the tame side for a 'smoked beer', but it mixes well a nice array of flavors. Think rye beer/lightly smoked German lager/saison, if that makes any sense."

"A unique brew. Kind of in the line of a saison and biere de garde. A nice rustic style."

"O: Some people may shy away from smoked beers but this is relatively tame and the smoke makes the taste interesting but doesn't overpower it. The best way I could describe this is it's kind of like a smoked saison."

"Bottle: Poured a light dirty hay color ale with a generous foamy head with some retention and light lacing. Aroma consists of multi-grain malt bill with deep floral and herbal hoppy notes. Taste is a mix between some lightly smoked multi-grain malt with some quite flavourful green and herbal hops with limited bitterness. Body is quite full with good carbonation. Nicely brewed with fresh green hops really coming through and well balanced by grain malt bill."

"500 ml bottle, Batch 355. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours a hazy orange/amber color with about an inch and a half off-white head. Head retention is good, and there's a decent amount of lacing. The brew smells like bready malt, yeast, smoke, and some fruit. Taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes like smoke, bready/grainy malt, yeast, wood, peppery spice, and some fruit. The smoke isn't overpowering in either the aroma or taste, but there's certainly enough there to notice it. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit coating and is well carbonated. I think this is a good brew, I'd buy it again in the future. $8.99 a bottle."

"500ml bottle. Wine glass. Enjoyed on jul´12. Orangish amber color, quite crystal clear appearance. Off-white, brief crown. Mildy toasted caramel malt hues, floral aromas & subtle peat malts to the nose. Crystal malt flavor, bitter & fruity touch followed by smoky bacon-like notes. Light to medium body, moderate to high carbonation. Spicy palate. Oily slightly watery texture. Dry astringent finish."

"Recommend to try"
"O/D - This is a unique beer. Bacon beer? Has a big time fall feeling to it. Bacon is good with everything, and it seems to be good here (at least in spirit). I'm good with this beer, but I don't know if i could go with more than one."

"500ml bottle. Pours a cloudy brownish amber with medium beige head. Aroma of sweet caramel malt, yeasty bready notes, some dark fruit, dates, plums. Taste is sweet lightly toasted caramel malt, yeast, dark fruity flavors of plums and dates, lightly hopped. Palate is a medium body with a slightly thick texture, with some mild carbonation. Finish is sweet lightly toasted caramel malt, yeasty with some dark fruits of plums, raisins dates followed by some light hops bitterness to balance the sweetness. Overall a very good, tasty brew, very much enjoyed this."

"Somewhat lively carbonation, just left if medium bodied. Drinks very easy. Really pretty unique, I can see this being a love hate, like most good smoked or rauch brews."

"A little ageing did not hurt this 500 ml. harvest ale. Mild smoke aroma. A bit of an overflowing foaming ale. Rye, smoked wheat, edgy and more complexity and mouthfeel body than a smoked lager. Good drinkability with food. Satisfying. On the bitter side without a lot of hops, yet no too bitter."

"Really nice beer: as well as having interesting complexities, it has a really well thought out and well executed balance to the flavours. I'm really loving what Haand does—this one may be the finest of theirs I've tried to date."
"A surprisingly easy to drink ale, the mix of grains making for a down-home, rustic elixir experience. Was a hit in my family home."
""
"I was expecting a fresh hopped ale and found some smoke, different but worth a try"
"Well crafted beer. I would drink it again."

"Much darker than schlenkerla helles as in orange gold. Pour is a nice head that lets out so much apple and woody acid leather notes all in a cloud of floral perfume. Automatically the question not to ask is whether this is a superior beer. Its more astringent but still balanced. Palate of chalk, smoke in one spectrum and apple pie and hints of sour notes that all combine into a grassy bitter end. Well carbonated. Ready for hams and creamy cheese. I love this brewery."
"Very interesting good beer. Let the bottle warm a bit out of the fridge. Poured with a foamy, fluffy, frothy, billowy, clumpy, cream colored head and lots of lace. Color is a clear medium dark amber with some bubble trails as they should be. Aroma is yeast, toffee, malt, dark riper fruit, and a hint of sm oke. Flavor is similar but smoke is much more prominant, followed by a sweet tang that really works to balance the whold. Finish is like flavor and has a long duration. Bit boozy there at the end too. Session if you're in the mood for this kind of thing. I rarely am."
"There's the smoke. Nice camp fire type smoke. Some wood, some grass, some grains. Toasty malt. The spice is light but unapologetic. Carbonation adds to the feel of it being refreshing. Light body, very nice drinking"
"Overall: I enjoy good smoked beers and this one is pretty good. A little more smoke as it warmed could have made it a bit better but it's still a good smoked beer"
"Overall this beer might be trying to cram too much into one drink, but it is good tasting, not too heavy not too light, and easy to drink"
"Gusher when opened at a cold temperature. Pours a slightly-murky orange-copper color with a thin white head that dissipates very quickly into a thin collar. The nose carries some light smoke and a bit of wood and spice. The flavor is fairly smoked with a bit of the woody character maintained. Not a strong smoke character, but there is a lot of the moderate smokeyness, if they makes sense. Overcarbonated and a light, fizzy body. Not a huge fan."
"O - Overall a very solid beer and enjoyable drink. Enjoyed the smoked malts and sweet Belgian like qualities play against each other. Perfect medium bodied ale for a hot day like today when a stout would be too much."
"I think this is a great farmhouse style beer. t offers a very different sort of malt complexity than most saisons or Bier de Gardes. Pretty smooth and rather refreshing. I will buy it again."
"The mouthfeel is very nice, overall a nice beer."
"Drinkability: If smoke is your game, then this beer is what your looking for. I'm not a huge fan of this type of beer, but I can appreciate it for what it is. While I tend to divert from this style, I do have to say that this was one of the better ones that I have tried. Would consider drinking it again...and that's saying something."
"A nice, tasty beer with plenty of flavour. Yum."
"My girlfriend doen't like smoked beers, but she liked this one, and so did I. In my book, that says something"
"D: I would have liked the flavors to be more in balance here, or at least a bitter mirror of the aromas."
"Agree very much with the previous reviewer. This is a very interesting beer, but it's all but impossible to say whether it works as a package."
"Interesting as hell but a bit jumbled - rating to style is hard. What do you compare it to? A bit odd and kinda tiresome by the end of the bottle. With food I expect it'd be different. Get me some smelly washed-rind cheese and that sort of thing and It'd be ideal. Unaccompanied, the chief attraction is probably the novelty."
"Drinkability is only OK if you can handle the smoke."
"Hesjeøl is the first beer from HaandBryggeriet I've had the pleasure of drinking. Not too smokey for being a smoked beer, and had a little sweetness in the malt. It poured with a little bit of white froth, and had a medium-full bodied texture. To me some beers really are an experience to drink, and some maybe more for their rarity than purely by their taste. Smoke beers, sour ales, chile beers are few and far between, and I think that counts for something. What I liked most about this beer was it was definitely out of the ordinary, and left me wanting more from Norway."
"Pours with an off-white, two-finger head that fades slowly to a thin layer and leaving some lace. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Hazy amber color. Nose is smokey wood. Flavor is a smokey, burnt wood. Not your usual harvest ale. Label has 7.0% ABV. Pricey at $9.45 for a 500ml bottle from Colonial Spirits, Acton, MA."
"Drinkability:This is a unique beer, not very sessionable, but lots of flavor."
"Unusual is the best way to describe this beer. I like seeing more smoked beer options, but at least showcase that flavor to a larger degree."
"D: HaandBryggeriet is super rare so I don't know how Beachwood got this. Definitely a try for something different, don't expect anything near Schlenkerla though."
"D: Goes down fairly easy but the smoke, char, and spice keep it from being too quaffable."
"Batch 254. Hmm, farmers required by law to make beer? Finally, a coercive act I have no problem with. This apparent relic of bygone days pours a not-quite-clear garnet-amber topped by a finger of thick off-white froth that tries to live forever but ultimately fails. Ah, the mortality of bubbles. The nose exhibits a healthy dose of peat smoke up front, almost like fiery oregano or something, with some wheat, grasses, and wood making up a rather rustic backdrop. The taste holds a rather more subdued smoky character, still fairly dark, that served as a compliment to the somewhat citrus-y and flowery wheat notes. Imagine a very subtly hopped wheatwine which was then nicely smoked. Good times, baby. The body nears heft, with a light carbonation and a somewhat dry feel. Overall, another good time from the Hand boys. Keep 'em comin', you crazy Norwegians!"
"Mouthfeel is very pleasing. Nicely carbonated without being fizzy. Great paring with cheeses. Drinkability--I find this beer to be highly drinkable. It is a pleasure to pick out the flavors, savor the smokiness, and enjoy the refreshing taste of this hearty ale."
"Perfeckt for what it is made for; Drinking on a hot summerday after a hard days work!"
"Drinkability: I'd score it higher if I liked the mouthfeel more."
"I couldn't see drinking too much of this at one sitting, but it *is* tasty to just enjoy occasionally."
"drinkability: good"
"D: An interesting, drinkable beer. Very easy to drink."
"I liked this beer quite a bit. Normally smoked beers are heavy handed with the smokiness, but the smoke in this one wasn't overpowering at all."
"F: Small finish, especially for a smoked beer. A little sweetness but it dries well. Slight malt and molasses. More light smoke and some dry smokey malts as well as a slight spicy hop. It finishes short and then just disappears."
"D - One never knows what to expect with these revivalist, traditional beers, and aside from smoke I really wasn't sure what I was getting into when I popped the cap off of this bottle. I expected something spicy, probably with some juniper; instead I get a lot of toasty, brown malt and muddy clove and allspice/cinnamon. It's kind of like a Belgian pumpkin ale. It isn't really an unpleasant combination, but there is something missing; it seems like it needs a bright note of hops, acidity, or a pungent spice like coriander to lift the heavy malt and smoke off the palate. As it is, it becomes a bit cloying toward the end of the glass and is not quite as drinkable as it might be. Nevertheless, it is an interesting, rustic beer and not quite like anything else that I have had before."
"Overall this was one of the more interesting beers I've had recently. It went down easy - no surprise as it had two specialty malts I like a bunch - however it didn't seem to really own any one of its many facets. Still, worth a shot."
"M - Really smooth, medium bodied."
"D: If it only it was a little less smoky. Plus I'm not a huge fan of rye to begin with. I can finish my bottle pretty easily, just not about to open another one. This is definitely a one-at-a-time beer for me."
"Bottle, Batch 254, home. This beer pours a tawny shade of sienna with a small beige-ish head. The aroma is big mix of caramel malt, spicy rye, smoke, oak and floral hops. There's also what I now recognize as a wild yeast note from Haand's own strain. The flavor is medium sweet, smoke and more of that interesting yeast. This is another very good beer from an excellent brewery."
"I'm highly impressed with this one honestly. It's very drinkable and has just the right amount of smoke to allow all the other flavors come out. Really tasty."
"D - It was pretty easy to drink a half-liter on my own. The overly zesty carbonation was the only thing that slowed me down. This is about the right amount of smoke for me - it's a nice supplemental flavor, but something that can be easy to overdo. Probably won't get his again due to the price, but it was cool to try."
"D: Another winner from the Hand Brewery! This is, according to their label, a ""Norwegian Harvest Ale"". No such category exists but their description on the label also references the fact that this is ""smoky"". Be sure to drink the sediment in the bottom of the bottle!"
