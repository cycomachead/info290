"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a copper color with amber hues and a 1/2 inch head. Smell is a bit unusual, some smoke. Taste is smokey, wood, meats, a good bit of band aide flavor at the finish. Feels light in the mouth and overall a unique beer to try, but one I won't need to drink again."

"I don't know about this beer. I have had one bottle of this and don't know if it's just an infected batch I got but I get a lot of Funky smell and taste from it. Tastes like it has lacto bacteria in it to me. I have had some smoked beers before, but this flavor is not the smoked variety to me. Its not bad but not what I was expecting."

"Overall: Great brew! I would have this one again for sure."

"O: This beer is quite easy to drink hived its wheat base, but you really need to have grown accustomed to the Band-Aid aromas and flavors to appreciate it."

"Intriguing combo of smoke & style. I feel like this has potential, but not fully executed."

"Overall this was o.k."

"This was quite malty and left a slightly sticky residue behind in my mouth. The alcohol was light enough that I could have had seconds of this in one sitting but like most people, I felt that one at a time was enough. While this won't bowl anyone over, it's different than anything else on the shelf and is worth a go once, if for no other reason that in its own odd way, this was a meal all unto itself. Yes, it called for a food pairing but there was enough here to give it complexity to go with the oddity that a Smoked Beer was, and still is, for someone like me."

"12 ounce bottle poured into a snifter. Off-white head, low retention on a clear, copper body. Aroma includes caramel sweetness, some butterscotch and maybe a slight hint of smoke. Taste showcases the smoke much more than the aroma, again some caramel sweetness and some of the wheat flavors shine through. Interesting mix of flavors, not bad at all."

"O: kinda ok, nothing special"
"O: Overall interesting, but not something I am in love with. The smoke feels a touch sweet, and it seems like after the smoke there isn't much else to it. Not bad, just not interesting."

"Overall - not a bad brew, but not terribly complex."
"Pours dark copper with an abundant off white head that dissipates, leaving little lacing along the side of the glass. The beer smelled smoky during the pour. That smokiness is pretty strong in the aroma, but I can also pick up the sweetness as well.The taste is smoky The malt sweetness does come through in the flavor as well. It's a pretty difficult flavor to describe. It's slightly astringent and acrid. I enjoy it more as I drink it. The body is light to medium. There isn't much carbonation to speak of. Overall, this beer is interesting. Unfortunately, it doesn't have much going for it. It's interesting in the average sense. I'm sure it would pair well with the local cuisine, but I won't be rushing to the store for another bottle of this any time soon."
"After reading the description, I thought I'd hate this beer-- but I was pleasantly surprised (at least at first)."
"The overall texture is on the thick side of medium-bodied, with a lasting astringent quality. Not a bad beer, but I'm not crazy about it."
"O: An intriguing beer, but not altogether an obviously good one. Still, I liked it, despite the misleading moniker. Tentatively recommended."
"Gotta love the random smoked tick, eh? It pours a tawny amber topped by a finger of short-lived dirty tan foam. The nose comprises buttery toffee and hickory smoke, with only a twinge of woody greens in the middleground between them. The taste holds notes of light hickory smoke, husky wheat, light clove, and toasted caramel. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and an oily-ish feel. Overall, a generally enjoyable smoked beer, but one that really doesn't stand out from the others in any real way. Tasty, though..."

"The smoke flavor was all but non-existent when I drank it. The beer has a sour taste (initial and afterward) that I didn't find too off-putting but rather refreshing: lemon zest and tart cherries. Decent and interesting, but I won't be hunting it down and hoarding all bottles."
"I got a brief finger of tawny head from my pour, but it disappeared like it had something better to do. Color was a lightly hazy orangish-amber. Nose was quite smoky, overlaying a slight sweetness. Mouthfeel was medium and while it was smoky in the mouth, it was nowhere near as overpowering as some made it out to be. Finish was likewise smoky-sweet, kind of like some types of barbecue that I have had in my travels. It was not bad, but it was not earth-shattering, either."
"Enjoy!!!! Oooo yehhh!"

"O: The Bayou Teche Pale is pretty phenomenal and I'd hoped for something similar from this. As such, it's a fairly benign beer hinting at smokiness and malt sweetness but without a great deal of body. It's just 'OK'... and that equals 'disappointing' to me. Drinkable, but certainly not crave-worthy. Sessionable strength is very nice, however; I'd bet this compliments spicy foods well."
"o: not a bad smoke beer, when ever i get one i try to pair it with bbq chicken."
"O- Interesting concept but it was too one dimensional. Smoke got in the way of any small flavors that could have been in there? Glad I got to try, but would pass on this again..."
"Overall it's not bad at all. Light for a smoked beer but very drinkable."
"Overall – I say this to myself with each smoked beer I try…I just can’t seem to get into/appreciate this style. This one was a bit easier for me to handle since it was a lighter style beer, but I still can’t seem to enjoy it."
"O: Overall, I scored it average because it's a really cool beer, but it could be better."
"O: Not an overpowering smoked beer. A good entry from Bayou Teche. Maximize with a burger or cheddar."
"Drinkability: Easy to knock back if it wasn't for the not so appealing smell/taste."
"So they bottled this beer, and I can review it in the comfort my own home. So what I got is a yellow to orange color. I definitely smelled smoke but not the wood smoke I actually wanted, it just lacks the gameness I get out of most smoke beers. The head dissipated as fast I poured it. The taste was very light smoke, with a slight wheat fruitiness. Overall It was a average to good beer that I wouldn't care to buy a six pack of."
"O - Not really impressed, though I'm looking forward to trying this when I see bottles around. Hopefully the smokiness is more pronounced and the wheat characters are more noticeable."
"I'm not a fan of smoked beers, especially porters, or wheat beers, but this beer turned out to be quite different than my expectations. Appearance was a slight golden color with an small head. Smell was malty wheat with a bare hint of smoke. Taste was slightly sweet, malty and smokey. The smoke taste didn't overwhelm and was quite agreeable. The malts and hops were well-balanced. Mouthfeel was crisp and dry. Overall this was a very drinkable beer and one I would consider for regular rotation. i just hope it will soon be available in a bottle."
