"Overall- certainly is the best smoked beer I've had as the smoke is masterfully woven into the rest of the beer. It's still a smoked beer, though.."

"Had on tap at Prohibition Pig and Blackback. I always feel bad deducting points for a style I'm not crazy about. I like smoke... don't love it and had it up against a few other HF brews. Was still pretty amazing. Just felt like the smoke was out of place. More like an experiment, and yet still about a 90 in my book. Speaks volumes for HF~"

"The smokiness in this is strong enough that I can't say I'd drink it every day, regardless of the obvious quality of the ingredients and process... It's a great beer - but I don't think I'll have another, if that puts it in perspective a bit."

"O - I say this with respect for HF products, but a ""smoked beer"" seems more of a novelty to me. The smoky flavor was clearly represented in the mouth, but not something I would seek out. It was worth a try though."

"O~ very nice smoked ale, not overly smokey with an amazing balance. i was under the presumption that this was George based and i can totally see that now. the smoke just seems to take away the hop presence that George does so well but its all good! the balance is what really shines here!"

"Overall - This is intense, but very strong. Much more caramel as it warms, but still strong verging on rough."

"Draft at Blackback, Waterbury. HD is a deep brown in color with a nice cap of beige carbonation. The base structure brings out a lot of robust malt character on the brown ale end of the spectrum, in a balanced complexity - browned bread, toffee and caramel, chocolate malt, and deep toast. Alongside runs an implanted and balanced beechwood smoke - meaty and very pleasant, backs up well to the firm malt back. On the fuller side of moderate in body with a moderate, gentle carbonation. Unique from any other smoked beer Iâ€™ve had, very nice."

"O-a great beer with barbecue, this had a great smooth feel and good flavor, but not as much smoke as I anticipated"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Easily the best smoked beer I've had yet, but my half pour was more than enough."
"[O] For me, the exceptional mouthfeel took this beer from 'good' to 'very good.' More impressive scores on the front end would have elevated Holger Danske to 'great.' And pretty easily. But, as always, the experience is always a pleasure."

"Beer is medium in body, a nice balance of smoky and sweet on the palate with a really great finish. The roast and smoke lingers in the mouth / palate for several seconds, making the beer seem dryer than it is. Definitely smoke forward without being over the top, by far the best smoked beer I've ever had."
"O - Depths of malt flavor with the smoke nicely complimentary throughout the drink and never overwhelms the other aspects."

"Overall: Drinkable and pleasant enough, but unremarkable- more so coming from the mighty Hill."

"O - Overall this was a very tasty smoked beer with very nice richness going for it. Another good brew from Hill Farmstead."

"Overall interesting, a decent smoked beer without over bitter or campfire, nice flavors, long tasty finish. Despite being a good beer, not quite as high caliber as most of the other Hill beers."
""
"Overall: Refined but straightforward. Doesn't do much, but what it does is delicious and unique. Provides a great fix for the smoked malt lover, and the mouthfeel is to die for. I'm not a big fan of saying ""to die for," but it's something you say about perfect, decadent things with the smoothness of world class chocolate."
"Dark brown pour with a small beige head; minimal retention and lacing. Obvious smoked malts in the nose, ash, toasted bread, dark sugars. More of the same in the taste, smoke and charcoal, toasted bread, roasty malts, toasted grains, caramel and brown sugar, hazelnut candy. Pretty well-balanced for the style, though the smokiness is still fairly large and in charge. Medium body, lower carbonation, quite good overall. Snagged a liter growler for my buddy. Cheers!"
"Like many smoked beers, I find the first sip isn't as smokey as the aroma but will make themselves known as you work your way though the grass. A nice caramel/toffee sweetness balances out the nice campfire notes. Rather light on the body with a nice smooth texture. Overall, a tasty smokey treat but falls just a bit short of the worldclass smoked beers coming out of Bamberg."

"o - Overall a very nice smoked beer. Not my favorite HF beer but good for the style. Nose is super smokey, while the taste isn't quite as heavy on the smoke. Worth checking out, especially if you liked smoke beers, and I'd certainly have it again."

"Holger Danske comes to me looking the brown color but not deep dark and bold brown, just a simple brown with a nice sturdy amount of cream colored foam on top leaving some spotches on the way down, healthy looking beer. Smell is smoky but a nice amount of caramel, roasted malt, cocco, and earth pop through in the scent, not smoked to the max. Taste is pretty well rounded and I got more out of it with each sip. The smoke sort of surrounds the other flavors mentioned above and dont take over the show. Taste is decadent, body is rich and medium and the carb is not a tounge lasher, this went down rather smoothly, with no intrusion from the 7.5% I could of drank a lot more of this beer, it did not bonk me over the head with ash and smoke. Would get again."

"Could use more body. I hate most smoked beers and thought this was excellent."
"A solid beer. Hill Farmstead can do no wrong it seems."
""
"If you like smoked beers I definitely recommend trying this beer, although I definitely recommend trying to drink it as fresh as possible and from the source. While the beer was good at Parker Pie it definitely wasn't as good as from the freshly tapped keg at HF. It seemed like a little bit of the sweetness was definitely missing from it."
"o- delicious and wonderfully balanced, HF beers never cease to amaze me."
"This reminded me of Fear & Trembling with slightly more smoke (now) and a lighter body. I really enjoyed this beer even more then I was expecting, and might have been the surprise of the Harvest Fest for me. Great smoked beer that's very close to a smoked porter."
""
"Overall I liked this more and more with each sip, and it paired incredibly with the beef brisket I ate. I know Shaun wins big with IPAs and Saisons but this shows he's got other talent up his sleeve. I didn't expect this to be one of my top favorite HF beers but it is. Wow."

"Pours an opaque near black with a thick mocha head. Nice retention fading to a thick collar and with clumps of lacing. Smokey, mild burnt aroma with balance coming from toast and chocolate malt. Thick, chewy body with a dry, ashy finish. Dark chocolate, licorice, roast malt, tobacco and faint dark fruit balance out the intense bbq and smoke of the flavor. Smoke in a glass? yes, but more complexity than typical for this style if you get past the initial ""shock""."

"For those seeking a smoky, nutty ale, this is a nice sipping beer for a snowy Winter's day."
"D: One of the better smoked beers I've had for sure. I've never seen Hill Farmstead in the Southland before; I'll have to be on the lookout for more of their stuff."
"DB- A true smoke bomb and in a very nice way. I could see how people would be turned off by the level of smoke in a beer like this but to me it is great, especially over the toasty malt profile. If you want your fix of BBQ in a glass, find a beer like this."
"D - Pretty good. I like smoked beers but this one was VERY smokey. I think I could still drink a few of these but the aftertaste would definitely get to me over time."
"Drinkability: I'm not a huge smoked beer fan, but this was a good take on the style, which along the other Hill Farmstead beers I had was very good."
"Chewy medium body with a lot of roasted smokiness up fentanyl that lngers troughout into a long dry finish. Smokier than the aroma suggest with lots of charcoal, butane, BBQ and bacon but there is still a lot of silky chocolate malt as well as some oatmeal, toffee and hazelnut. The smokiness becomes more dominant as it warms but like the other beers ie had frm this brewery it is well balanced and very quaffable."
"As a brown ale, it's exceedingly well conceived, and the addition of the smoke works surprisingly well; it's not gimmick, it balances the other flavors well."
"You've done well with this one, Shaun. A unique and tasty beverage this one is."
"D: I would have to limit myself to one at a time due to the overpowering flavor. That said, it was a great brew that I would love to try again."
"Drinkability: Very easy to consume glass after glass. I wouldn't hesitate to put this up against any beer in the smoked category where I think this beer would certainly shine. Too bad it's a limited brew :("
"Phew, it's carbonated, albeit it bit light however that's fine for the style. Very smokey as the nose lead on, it's almost a bit like scotch in that peaty rustic smoke way. Theres a very velvety mouthfeel that is really mellow and smooth with just the lightest carbonation bite on your tongue that comes through when you hold it in your mouth. Some more caramel and chewy molasses starts to come through as you get through the smoke. Very unique beer, calling it an American Brown doesn't do it justice."
"On tap at La Laiterie in Providence. Holy, mother of god, Farmstead rocks! As I always knew, Shaun is a master of brewing. Easily, one of the smoothest beers I have ever tasted. The head on this is like molten, smoky foam. Perfect smoke, perfect brown, perfect beer. Nuff said. Exceptional smoked beer. Gives any smoked beer I have had a run for the money."
"Overall a great smoked brew that gives Aecht Schelenkerla a run for it's money."
"I thought I'd add this as an American Brown Ale, as I didn't know if it quite rose to the level of a rauchbier."
