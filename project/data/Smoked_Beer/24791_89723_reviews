"Probably one of Port City's best beers but not one for everyone. Body is black with minimal head like a porter/stout but blindfolded this could've been a rauchbier for all I knew b/c it smells so smoky and meaty, probably a touch of sweet malt gives it away. I really like the smokiness/gaminess of beer (and I don't eat meat at all, mind you) which is heavy on tongue but completely overpowering. This allows for a mellow balance that gives off just enough sweetness to counter the ""meat"" flavor without compromising the smoke aspects of the beer. An enjoyable beer that nicely blends two different styles."

"At first I as disappointed, but having thought about it this is a great marketing beer and way to introduce people to the style."
"Overall - just a solid beer. Glad to have had the chance to try it. Will definitely seek this out!"
"On tap at Rustico in Alexandria. Served in a snifter. Pours near black. Nose is far too smokey and meaty. Smoked herring. Some roast underneath. Flavor is similar, but more intense on the smoke. A bit more background beer as it warms, but I just couldnâ€™t get into this one."
