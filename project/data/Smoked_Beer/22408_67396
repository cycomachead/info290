Taste is smokey, wood, meats, a good bit of band aide flavor at the finish. Feels light in the mouth and overall a unique beer to try, but one I won't need to drink again.","tone77","Dec 14, 2014"

The alcohol was light enough that I could have had seconds of this in one sitting but like most people, I felt that one at a time was enough. While this won't bowl anyone over, it's different than anything else on the shelf and is worth a go once, if for no other reason that in its own odd way, this was a meal all unto itself. Yes, it called for a food pairing but there was enough here to give it complexity to go with the oddity that a Smoked Beer was, and still is, for someone like me.","JerzDevl2000","Apr 26, 2013"

Aroma includes caramel sweetness, some butterscotch and maybe a slight hint of smoke. Taste showcases the smoke much more than the aroma, again some caramel sweetness and some of the wheat flavors shine through.

3.15,-3.4,3.5,3.5,3,3,3,"Pours dark copper with an abundant off white head that dissipates, leaving little lacing along the side of the glass. The beer smelled smoky during the pour. That smokiness is pretty strong in the aroma, but I can also pick up the sweetness as well.The taste is smoky The malt sweetness does come through in the flavor as well. It's a pretty difficult flavor to describe. It's slightly astringent and acrid. I enjoy it more as I drink it. The body is light to medium. There isn't much carbonation to speak of. Overall, this beer is interesting. Unfortunately, it doesn't have much going for it. It's interesting in the average sense. I'm sure it would pair well with the local cuisine, but I won't be rushing to the store for another bottle of this any time soon.","acevenom","Feb 11, 2012"

3.5,7.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Gotta love the random smoked tick, eh? It pours a tawny amber topped by a finger of short-lived dirty tan foam. The nose comprises buttery toffee and hickory smoke, with only a twinge of woody greens in the middleground between them. The taste holds notes of light hickory smoke, husky wheat, light clove, and toasted caramel. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and an oily-ish feel. Overall, a generally enjoyable smoked beer, but one that really doesn't stand out from the others in any real way. Tasty, though...","TMoney2591","Jan 10, 2012"

3,-8,3,3,3,3,3,"I got a brief finger of tawny head from my pour, but it disappeared like it had something better to do. Color was a lightly hazy orangish-amber. Nose was quite smoky, overlaying a slight sweetness. Mouthfeel was medium and while it was smoky in the mouth, it was nowhere near as overpowering as some made it out to be. Finish was likewise smoky-sweet, kind of like some types of barbecue that I have had in my travels. It was not bad, but it was not earth-shattering, either.","woodychandler","Nov 30, 2011"

3.07,-5.8,3,3.5,3,2.5,3,"O: The Bayou Teche Pale is pretty phenomenal and I'd hoped for something similar from this. As such, it's a fairly benign beer hinting at smokiness and malt sweetness but without a great deal of body. It's just 'OK'... and that equals 'disappointing' to me. Drinkable, but certainly not crave-worthy. Sessionable strength is very nice, however; I'd bet this compliments spicy foods well.","msubulldog25","Sep 21, 2011"

3.15,-3.4,3,3,3,3.5,3.5,"So they bottled this beer, and I can review it in the comfort my own home. So what I got is a yellow to orange color. I definitely smelled smoke but not the wood smoke I actually wanted, it just lacks the gameness I get out of most smoke beers. The head dissipated as fast I poured it. The taste was very light smoke, with a slight wheat fruitiness. Overall It was a average to good beer that I wouldn't care to buy a six pack of.","Francepants06","Mar 21, 2011"
3.27,0.3,2.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,"O - Not really impressed, though I'm looking forward to trying this when I see bottles around. Hopefully the smokiness is more pronounced and the wheat characters are more noticeable.","EgadBananas","Beers"
3.85,18.1,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"I'm not a fan of smoked beers, especially porters, or wheat beers, but this beer turned out to be quite different than my expectations. Appearance was a slight golden color with an small head. Smell was malty wheat with a bare hint of smoke. Taste was slightly sweet, malty and smokey. The smoke taste didn't overwhelm and was quite agreeable. The malts and hops were well-balanced. Mouthfeel was crisp and dry. Overall this was a very drinkable beer and one I would consider for regular rotation. i just hope it will soon be available in a bottle.","utah44","0"
