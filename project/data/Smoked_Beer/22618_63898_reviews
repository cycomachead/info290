"It's labelled smoke, but it's very understated letting some of the other flavors bounce and play off of it a bit, and getting more forward.  It seems the smoke character actually took a back seat, but it still made for an interesting take on the final product letting the other qualities shine through.  Unique take on a smoked porter.  Decent."

"Pours dark as a starless night.  Massive World Class head, lacing and retention.  Nice rich nose of caramel sweetness, dark fruit (plum, fig) over a light note of smoke.  As it warms, the smokiness increases but never really comes to the forefront.  Heavy medium body with a fair amount of creamy texture.  Above average carbonation with a bit of effervescence in the middle and a nice burst in the finish.  The flavor profile is a bit below normal intensity, extremely well balanced and a bit complex.  It begins with a slightly bitter dark chocolate note over a light caramel sweetness.  This flows into a very mild bitterness with distinct notes of dark fruit.  The finish is where a light hint of smoke emerges as the flavors fade.  This one is good, but there is no big smoke aspect."

"A pretty tasty porter overall, strong flavour and nothing to complain about. Wouldn't really call it a big smoke flavour, and it wasn't anything hugely different, but an enjoyable drink nonetheless."

"Triednext to a sample of Barrier's Undertow Rauchbier and found it less smokey and with less sweet chocolate. More chalk. Decent but not my favorite."

"The Big Smoke name is apt as this beer is defined by a moderately strong smoke aroma and flavor that is well supported by a solidly brew porter underneath."
"Overall: not as advertised! smoke flavour is almost non-existent, it's a coffee beer if anything, and in that respect not a great one, being intensely bitter and just a bit too thin"

"O: I am not a big smoked ale fan (despite my love of heavily peated scotch) but this one was nice despite being significantly smoked. I'd have preferred the chocolate and maybe some coffee notes stepping up to match the smoke."
"It's got the right depth and heft for a porter, offering a well sustained strength on the fuller side of a medium body. There's just a little carbonation, enough to keep things going, while a nice smoothness rolls along."
"Bottle: Poured a black color porter with a light brown huge foamy head with excellent retention and some retention. Bottle even kept gushing after first glass had been poured. Aroma of light dry roasted malt with light coffee notes. Taste is also dominated by light dry roasted malt with smoked notes almost non-existent. Body is about average with great carbonation and no apparent alcohol. I must say that this beer was quite a disappointment compared to other beers from the same brewery with the smoked notes almost non-existent. Makes me wonder if bottle was infected or something since it was gushing a bit."

"O - as things go, this is a pretty solid porter. It's flavorful, lush, and not tooo heavy with its roasted qualities. The only thing I find disappointing is that it's not as smoky as it could be given its name."
""
"The taste was strong and intense of smoky, dark, roasted malt - very tasty"
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer seemed to be over carbonated and requires a careful pour and a lot of patience waiting for the head to die down. However, it has a nice amount of smoke that seems to be well incorporated and balanced with the beer's aromas and flavors."
""
"Could use more carbonation."
"O - Overall, this beer sure delivered what it promised, a very smokey potent brew. Very glad I got to try this one."

"Boom! What a beer - like bonfire night personified in liquid. The aroma and flavour have fantastic depth and complexity; a beautiful and well-rounded m√©lange. Perhaps this has something to do with the age of the bottle - maybe time has allowed the flavour to mellow out and smooth the harshness that a younger brew would have possessed. At any rate, this is lovely and well worth sampling if you have the good fortune to stumble across it."

"This is one of the best smoked porters! Poured at about cellar temperature, with a colossal, super frothy, foamy, billowy, tan head that lasts and lasts plus good lacing. Color is a clear orange brown with plenty of bubble trails. Aroma is smoke, malt, leather, cocoa. Flavor's like nose, smoke is not out of proportion, fairly dry, bitter and carbonic tang balance nice with smoke. Body and carbonation - excellent. Finish is like flavor, longish, a little boozy, and good for one or two bottles."
"A nice beer once it settles down a little; after the first sip I didn't think I was going to like this one due to the strong smoked flavours but this subdued slightly as time went on and it turned in to a not bad beer. It could have slightly better balanced but it was one that I enjoyed and was a somewhat unusual offering."

"Overall, very nice. Really excellent mouthfeel for the flavors, and at 6.2% compares well to stronger beers in terms of complexity."
"D - Very drinkable. Good smoked character that comes together nicely and is balanced with all of the other flavors."
"Pours a deep, opaque dark-chocolate brown with a thick, though not persistent, dark tan head. It fizzes a lot, but more like cola than beer. Aroma has roast coffee and semi-sweet chocolate notes, plus hints of molasses and caramel. Smoky flavor has malty, woody and coffee notes with a hint of caramel. Texture has plenty of lively, soda-like fizz but not much body. OK as far as porters go - not the best, but worth at least a try."

"Poured from a 500ml bottle. Pours solid black and forms a big beige head that dissipates quickly. There are of course plenty of big dark roast notes on the nose backed with tempting smoked meat. Similarly pleasant combination on the palate, with roasty malt flavour up front followed by the meaty smoke flavour on the finish. Smooth, creamy mouthfeel with a nice dry finish. Eminently quaffable."
"Served from tap into an imperial pint. Poured a massively dark ruby red brown with a two finger tan head that subsided to half a finger slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of roasted malt, smoke, smoked meat, cream, and dark chocolate. The flavor was of sweet malt, roasted malt, roasted malt, dark chocolate, smoke, and smoked meat. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty decent brew. While the smoke was definitely present on this one it really wasn't the star of the show. The roastiness on the armoa definitely dominated this one upon first inspection. On the flavor I was really quite surprised to find a sweet malty aspect going on. I don't think it was needed and rather clashed with some of the smokey and roasty notes. Not a bad representation of the style, but defintely not my favorite."

"O - its says big smoke and that's exactly what you get, so its hard to argue in terms of rating it, don't bother if you're not a fan of smoke flavour"
""
"Really good and well put together."

"another solid offering from a ""new to me"" brewery, pricy here in Alberta but I just might buy one to tuck away for a while and see what happens"
"A smoked beer with the best tendencies, IMHO - freak me out with aroma, do a context shift with the malt for the taste, and rest on your laurels thereafter. Not a bad thing, that. Overall, a nice, multivaried, if not overly complex, smoked beer. Recommended, if you've the cash to burn."
""
"O - This is a pretty interesting beer. At first I thought I wouldn't be able to finish this smoky brew but it mellowed and was pretty tasty."
"The flavor is a great deal more portery than the aroma. Rich, bitter, lightly sour porter barley starts things off, getting a bit creamy in the middle, and ending on a cross between firm, bitter hops and light smoke flavoring. Nicely hopped, nicely smoked, and nicely balanced, this is a refreshing and remarkably sessionable beer."
""
"Overall the smokiness was not as overpowering as I usually like. Having said that, this one was pretty tasty and drinkable. Worth a try but wouldn't seek out. Thanks TATURBO."

"The long journey may have taken a toll on this one, which is generally muddy."

"Tasty very drinkable smoked porter. Good and substantive hopping. Worth paying up for. I drink the bomber inside of half an hour. Nice colour and wine like hoppy smoked aroma. I was concerned about the chocolate muddling up the character of this smoked porter, rather it smoothed it out and improved drinkability."
"Quite a tasty smoke brew. The nose pops a just a little bit more than the rather deflated palate, which is a shame, but at least nothing is over-the-top or blown out. Didn't get the explosive carbonation that others seem to have had, either."
"3.5 D: I was hoping this would be smokier than it is. In any case, it isn't a bad beer, but I'd never pay $10 for a bottle of it again."

"Explodes out of bottle with a five+ finger light tan head that fades very slowly leaving a good lace. Deep mahogany color, no highlights. Fierce carbonation and medium bodied. Smoky nose and flavor is a smooth smoky malt with a serious smoky aftertaste. Pricey at $10.99 for a 500ml bottle from Julio's Liquors Westborough, Ma."
"500 ml bottle. Served in a mug, the beer pours dark brown with a couple inch frothy tan head. The head stays around a very long time, and there's a good amount of lacing. Aroma is smoked and roasted malt, bittersweet chocolate, and a bit of coffee. Although smoke is noticeable in the aroma, it's not close to being overpowering at all. Taste is pretty much just like the aroma, the brew tastes like smoked and burnt/charred malt, coffee and bittersweet chocolate. I think the bitter/roasty flavors are bit stronger than the smoky ones, but it's still a tasty brew. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit coating and has high carbonation, way more carbonation than I would like for this beer. I think it's a decent enough brew overall, I'd buy this again at some point in the future."

"Ooh, some smoked goodness from a new country (Kiwi-Land). Let's do this: It pours a clear deep, dark ruby-brown topped by over a finger of dusty tan foam. The nose comprises rich smoke (not too dark/peaty, but thick and heavy enough to really make an impression), light roasted malts, mild cocoa, walnut, and a few drops of maple syrup. The taste is mostly a lithe blend of smoke, chocolate, light roast, and maple syrup. Good times, indeed. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a moderate carbonation and a dry, slightly prickly feel. Overall, were this not a touch light and overcarbonated, it would be a downright great smoked porter. As it stands, it is very, very good, and I would never turn another down."
"Medium bodied with lots of tight carbonation up front and an odd metallic flavor that covers up the smoke. Likely infected with hints of charcoal, burnt acrid charred toast and ash. Very dry finish really gross and extremely difficult to drink."
"M: soft and mellow with noticeable CO2 bite"
"Overall: Not a huge fan of smoked beers, but I really enjoyed this one. Would get it again, depending on what I was pairing this up with for a solid dinner option."
"D - The 500ml bottle would probably be better shared by two people, due to the intensity of the smoked flavors, but the lower alcohol made this fairly easy to finish. An enjoyable smoked porter - worked my way through the bottle while listening to Stravinsky's Firebird (1919 version)."
"O - Full flavoured from start to finish. Like a vegetarian version of a Schlenkerla rauch. If the Schlenkerla rauchbiers are smoked ham hock, this is barbequed eggplant (good but missing some grunt)."
"Not sure about this one. I think i was expecting more smokiness. Maybe it's the subtlety that makes it good? I'll have to revisit and try and figure it out."
"Overall, I like this beer a lot. It's smoky, but well balanced, definitely worth trying."
"The aroma was thick, rich with peat and smoked notes, if you like smoked beers, this was the top of the game for smelling. Lots of light fruity notes swilling around and an almost molasses like sweetness that descended upon it as it tried to warm up on me. Intensely smoked, huge rich notes of peat, charcoal, wood, lots of earthy and vinous properties as well. Rich notes of pine almost in the finish attempted to dry out the palate but were pushed aside by a huge smoked malts flavor that lasted on your tongue long after it was gone. For as rich as it was at times, it remained wonderfully balanced and continued to impress me with that aspect of it. The carbonation was kind of low, which caused a touch of flatness to it, enhancing the dry finish, but still causing a distraction overal;"
"O: a flavorful and not overpowering brew; a great introduction to the flavor of smoked malt for those unfamiliar with the smoked styles"
"Yeah, decent complexity and nice porter notes, would just like a stronger smoke flavour to create more contrast in the palate. Otherwise very nice."
"O - If you couldn't tell this is a very enjoyable beer for me the smoke is nice and present in the flavor the body is damn near perfect I'm not calling it a session beer but its one that I could drink all night if you like smoked beers you'll love this one worth getting if you see it around"
"Whew. Thought this would be good, but this is just amazing. Could picture myself easily sitting in a pub on a cold night, roaring fire in the corner and drink pint after pint of this. Wonderful."
"In short, a smoked porter with lots of finesse and superb balance between the malts, hops and roast-derived flavors, with light smokey touch lacking any harsh, burnt or greasy notes. (500 ml, into tulip.)"
"Nothing bad here. Solid beer, would like more smoke or something else that would provide strength."
"Liquid is a dark brown with a small amount of off white head. This beer is potent. I can pick it up from a foot away from my glass. The smell is just lovely. A dirty foot that has been dipped in tar. Even though it smells that spectacular to me I venture for a sip. Somebody ground up some smokey beef jerkey and dumped it in my glass. The carbonation was good and the beer rolled on my tongue nicely. Everything else was awful, and I mean real awful. Two sips and I was spent."
"D/O: Overall a very easy and clean drinking smoked porter. The emphasis is on its smooth drinking character, lightbodied style that pleases without overwhelming. At 6.2% this would probably of faired better being a point lower in abv% making this a easy drinking smoked session porter."
"Roasted dark malt graininess hits the palate with a sharp, almost metallic twang. Earthy and robust, this porter is. The smoke is a nice touch, adding charred wood and nuttiness to the finish with some bitter hop notes. Mouthfeel is crisp and bubbly with a medium-light body. Solidly-built. Overall, a tasty smoked porter that I'd gladly have again."
"Lighter side of medium bodied, a complimentary amount of carbonation. This drinks very easy, as long as you like it. A real good brew, my first from this country. No buyers remorse with this one. Up there with the Norweigan Wood for my favorite for this style."
"This is really smooth, but takes a few pulls to get used to. BY the end of it you are disappointed that is gone though. This beer gives me cause to try some more of the brews from the Kiwis. If it keeps up like this we'll start to see more of their stuff on the shelves."
"great beer. Hands down. Brand new to my local store but well worth ever penny."
"Finish is all semi-sweet/bitter black chocolate with a hint of black licorice and burnt espresso. The finish goes on forever."
"D: An extremely drinkable beer."
"A great new smoked porter from a New Zealand brewery that I have not seen before.Poured into an imperial nonic a deep dark chocolate brown with a one finger lighter mocha colored head that held well.The smoke is very faint in the aromas,I picked up mainly chocolate malt and some earthy tones.The palate is well rounded with the smoke coming more into play,it goes well with a nice shot of chocolate and dark roast.Not in your face smoke but a nice well rounded porter roast with decent complexity."
"D - Another top beer from 8 Wired. Very tasty beer that isn't over the top."
"A solid beer with good flavour and nice mouthfeel."
"A very nice beer, and another good brew from 8 Wired. Very smooth, but with oodles of flavour. Great drop."
"This brew is actually a smoked porter and it pours a dark brown hue with decent carbonation that leaves behind a two finger creamy cappicino laced head with a rim of lacing,the smell is a mixture of oak,smoked bacon,ham and burnt firewood,it has a smooth creamy mouthfeel which is neither thick nor thin and allows tastes of smoked bacon,smoked wood,blackberries and some underlying earthy fruit driven hops on the palette at the finish,overall an interesting brew that is easy to knock back but after my last sampling from this brewery i was expecting a little more."
