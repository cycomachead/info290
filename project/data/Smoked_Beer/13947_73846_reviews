"There's a distinctive bandaid taste up front. The malt is pale with a hint of toast. The swallow is distractingly medicinal. Good hop bitterness in the aftertaste. Rich body with a low carbonation--my favorite."

"22oz bottle served in a standard tapered glass. True to its name the beer is straw yellow in color, slightly hazy, with a substantial white head. Considerable aroma suggesting smoke, fresh rye bread, with a little yeasty quality, like perhaps a saison or biere de garde. Very promising. And, indeed, the flavor is dead on. There's a lot of flavor in this totally sessionable lager. It's well carbonated, and a very slight sourness brings some refreshment along with the bold grainy flavors of the rye, and the spicy clove flavors from the yeast. I would not have guessed this is a lager, though given the color and mouthfeel it makes total sense. The ABV is 4.5% which is a good thing because this thing is dangerously drinkable. Underrated and worth seeking out for fans of either roggenbier or rauchbier."

"Definitely a unique beer, something I've not had before, and wasn't bad."

"Fumata is a standard earthy porter that borrows the nicer attributes of American-style robust porters and London-style brown porters. The rye character shows a raw earthiness that supports the smoke flavor and aroma well- I just kinda wish there were more of it."

"Overall: Not too familiar with smoked beer, but this one was ver desirable. I wouldn't mind drinking this with BBQ or even any grilled foods during the warmer months."

"I wish they did this with a better defined malt profile. Great smokiness, and a mediocre malt. I could drink this again, but probably won't."

"A noble attempt at a unique blend of styles, though I would argue it still needs a little ironing out."

"Overall: If I did not know better I would think this beer was made in Bamburg. It is that good. It may be the best domestic rauch/smoked beer I have had. Love the smoke heaviness on this one. Yes I wish this was a bit higher on the rye, but anyone who likes rauches should grab this. Way better than the black from High and Mighty, and I do like that beer--especially for rauch like quality."

"Notes: A very interesting beer. Definitely something to check out if you're looking for something different. One of the most highly hopped smoked beers I've had."
"I believe this beer is miscategorized as a ""rye beer"" here on BA. This is a smoked lager that also contains rye."
"Taste starts with a light sweetness, goes spicy in the middle, and closes with the same medium smoke seen in the nose. Mouthfeel is a bit slick for my taste, and drinkability is pretty good. Wish there was more smoke to round it out."
"Pours a light, clear straw/golden color. Has a very nice aroma of smoke. The flavor is sharp, spicey, and citrusy. It's quite complex for a easy-drinking beer. I really like the smokiness in the flavor. The spice a breadiness from the rye is also quite satisfying. This is a nice fall beer and is a break from some of the bigger, malt or hop-heavy beers that overwhelm the shelves these days. It is nicely restrained yet complex. Because it's on the weaker side, it tastes a bit watery and not as flavorful as I would like. If it were just beefed up a tad, either in mouthfeel or malt, I would like it more. This is one better cold in my opinion. As it warms, it starts to taste more like a smoked Bud to me. I will definitely come back to this when I want an easy-drinking but tasty beer. I love smoked beers, too, and this was pretty interesting."

"A very interesting beer from High & Mighty, I can't really think of a beer to which I could compare it. Perhaps not something I'd seek out again, but a cool experiment nonetheless."

"O - Glad to have this available and will continue to seek it out. Well done to those High and Mighty folks keep up the fine work."
"This was pretty good, one of the better High & Mighty beers I've tried, but not exactly my favorite rauchbier. All in all a very good intro to the style though. The rye is a nice touch."
"O - Overall very surprised by this beer. Was not expecting this to work but the smoke and rye go very good together. Would buy this again but not something I could drink large quantities of."
