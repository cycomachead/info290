"Overall: Each to their taste, but I love this."
"This porter has an awesome appearance.  It's head could be classified as its own mountain range.  I actually had to wait on it to settle a bit to finish the pour.  When a beer starts with a nice chunky head that holds is shape for quite a long while, it has to be pretty good.  It is good but for a ""smoked"" porter I could use a little more ""smoke."""
"I have to admit, I added some points just because it is smoked porter in a can.  It was on the rack at the mixed 6 pack area at Harris Teeter.  It opened with a perfect pop sound.  Poured to beautiful head.  Head retained nicely.  I think the beer was a little cold initially as I had left it outside in 13 degree night wind for too long.  It was initially bitter, which I think is a product of the peat smoked malt.  My palette adjusted as it warmed up and we met together in a smile of enjoyment.  Not too smokey.  Carbonation was brisk and enjoyable.  I think a little more malt back bone would be enjoyable.  It seemed a tad thin at times on the feel.  I ate a piece of salmon with it and it was perfect.  I thought I was back in Juno Alaska with local smoked porter and salmon meal.  I give good credit that the smoke was not over done, not a smoke bomb."

"The flavor profile is reasonable in intensity, lacks complexity and is not well balanced.  It lacks the flavor depth of the great porters and is a bit one dimensional as a result.  It does deliver a nice burst of smoke from the peated malt, that is oak in nature, and serves as the main characteristic.  It lacks a balance for the smoke that a rich dose of caramel and chocolate malt could provide.  Also absent is any dark fruit character.  A nice mild bitterness appears in the middle that is roast and hop in nature.  The finish slowly fades with smoke and notes of roast."

"Quest did a fine job with Smoking Mirror. Instead of obliterating the underlying porter with smoke this beer is a rich, malty porter with mild smokey compliments. The use of peat ismoke s welcomed too. I really enjoy this beer and would love to try the porter itself without the peat smoked malt. Seems it would be right up my alley. Thanks again, Wil!"

"Served from tap into a shaker. Poured a massively dark brown with a one finger tan head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, roasted malt, smoke, earth, dark chocolate, cream, and subtle milk chocolate. The flavor was of roasted malt, smoke, toasted malt, earth, spice, and dark chocolate. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty decent brew. I am personally a big fan of smoked beers as they always remind me of a barbeque. This one was no exception. You know right off the bat that it is a smoked brew. Huge notes of smoke just consume you once you investigate this brew. There is also a nice sweet balance to it as well that makes it very easy to drink as well. I just wish that on the flavor some of the earthiness would have been covered up with a nice touch of sweetness to balance it out more and take it to another level. Still a very good brew sit down and enjoy if you see it on tap around. Tick."
