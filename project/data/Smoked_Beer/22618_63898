It seems the smoke character actually took a back seat, but it still made for an interesting take on the final product letting the other qualities shine through.  Unique take on a smoked porter.

Nice rich nose of caramel sweetness, dark fruit (plum, fig) over a light note of smoke.  As it warms, the smokiness increases but never really comes to the forefront.  Heavy medium body with a fair amount of creamy texture.  Above average carbonation with a bit of effervescence in the middle and a nice burst in the finish.  The flavor profile is a bit below normal intensity, extremely well balanced and a bit complex.  It begins with a slightly bitter dark chocolate note over a light caramel sweetness.  This flows into a very mild bitterness with distinct notes of dark fruit.  The finish is where a light hint of smoke emerges as the flavors fade.  This one is good, but there is no big smoke aspect.","tillmac62","Nov 09, 2014"

The flavor was of sweet malt, roasted malt, roasted malt, dark chocolate, smoke, and smoked meat. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty decent brew. While the smoke was definitely present on this one it really wasn't the star of the show. The roastiness on the armoa definitely dominated this one upon first inspection. On the flavor I was really quite surprised to find a sweet malty aspect going on. I don't think it was needed and rather clashed with some of the smokey and roasty notes. Not a bad representation of the style, but defintely not my favorite.","thagr81us","Jul 20, 2012"

Aroma is smoked and roasted malt, bittersweet chocolate, and a bit of coffee. Although smoke is noticeable in the aroma, it's not close to being overpowering at all. Taste is pretty much just like the aroma, the brew tastes like smoked and burnt/charred malt, coffee and bittersweet chocolate. I think the bitter/roasty flavors are bit stronger than the smoky ones, but it's still a tasty brew. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit coating and has high carbonation, way more carbonation than I would like for this beer.

The nose comprises rich smoke (not too dark/peaty, but thick and heavy enough to really make an impression), light roasted malts, mild cocoa, walnut, and a few drops of maple syrup. The taste is mostly a lithe blend of smoke, chocolate, light roast, and maple syrup. Good times, indeed. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a moderate carbonation and a dry, slightly prickly feel. Overall, were this not a touch light and overcarbonated, it would be a downright great smoked porter.

4.08,6.3,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"A great new smoked porter from a New Zealand brewery that I have not seen before.Poured into an imperial nonic a deep dark chocolate brown with a one finger lighter mocha colored head that held well.The smoke is very faint in the aromas,I picked up mainly chocolate malt and some earthy tones.The palate is well rounded with the smoke coming more into play,it goes well with a nice shot of chocolate and dark roast.Not in your face smoke but a nice well rounded porter roast with decent complexity.","oberon","Feb 13, 2011"

4.12,7.3,4,4.5,4,4,4,"This brew is actually a smoked porter and it pours a dark brown hue with decent carbonation that leaves behind a two finger creamy cappicino laced head with a rim of lacing,the smell is a mixture of oak,smoked bacon,ham and burnt firewood,it has a smooth creamy mouthfeel which is neither thick nor thin and allows tastes of smoked bacon,smoked wood,blackberries and some underlying earthy fruit driven hops on the palette at the finish,overall an interesting brew that is easy to knock back but after my last sampling from this brewery i was expecting a little more.","ADZA","0"
