It isn't as horrible as one guy told me ("the worst beer I've ever had"), but I think most of it is going down the drain so I can drink something I really like. The smoke is way overdone here (though Alaskan Smoked Porter is very smoky and I love it), and it is almost cloyingly sweet too.

4.17,17.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Did the brewer hit his mark...YES. Do I love this beer....Not Really. Poured from a 22 oz. bomber into a pint glass, Charkoota Rye is an amber-brown in the glass, with a thin, off-white head; almost a cola-like appearance. Nose is of sweet, dark, roasty malts; black licorice, molasses, smoked peat, burnt chocolate and coffee are all present. The taste is similar to the nose with the smoky characteristics coming to the forefront. The beer is dry but not terribly acrid with a very thin carbonation. The increased ABV increases the drying effect but doesn't seem quite as high as the 8.4% listed on the bottle. Overall, as drinkable for a beer as strongly flavored and high in alcohol as a beer like this can be.","WoodBrew","Jul 15, 2012"

4.1,15.5,4,4,4,4,4.5,"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, 2010 vintage. Pours a clear and extremely dark reddish brown color with a small light tan head with ok retention that reduces to a a ring of lacing. Light spotty lacing on the glass. Aromas of big caramel, smoked meat, molasses, raisin, prune, toast, bread, oak, herbal, earth, chocolate, toffee, and rye. Very nice aromas with great balance and complexity. Taste of big caramel, toffee, raisin, prune, molasses, smoke, bread, oak, chocolate, toast, herbal, earth, rye, and light peppery spiciness. Lingering notes of dark fruit, caramel, molasses, smoke, toast, earth, and rye on the finish for a good bit. Great balance of all flavors; with a very nice amount of complexity. Smokiness is not overpowering and compliments the style nicely. Minimal cloying sweetness. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy, slick, and slightly syrupy mouthfeel as expected for the style. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Definitely a sipper, but is still very smooth. Overall this is an excellent smoked doppelbock. Very nice flavor complexity and balance, and very smooth to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering, well done.","superspak","Jun 01, 2012"

I believe the key to a good smoked beer is for the flavor to not be sensely murdered by saltiness as is the case in Three Floyds Ham & Rye. The other problem with smoke beers is not enough flavor. This beer is well balanced. It has a nice smoke taste without being overly salty. It goes down very smooth. Unlikely a number of smoke beers, you can drink more than a sample without becoming bored. The aftertaste stays on the tongue for a while, but is able to go with a meal and not kill the flavor of the meal. It is certainly among the more balanced smoke beers.","JohnnyHopps","Jul 05, 2011"

3.65,2.8,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Let me preface this review by saying I enjoyed the beer but I was expecting more of a dopplebock than rye beer so maybe my expectations were a little off. Poured a reddish-brown body w/ one-finger offwhite head that died quick on top of a malt aroma. Stating the obvious I am w/ that malt aroma; smokey, little meaty, oaky woodiness with some roasted/toasted malts/barley as well as touch of caramel and black cherry. A very meaty-tasting beer, and I like it, but I was hoping for a more fruit and malt complexity in the taste. The beer has a stickiness from some molasses and goes down a tad haggard in a medium body but the toasted malts and rye balance for a dry edge that isn't overpwering. Little sweet but more dry but does mellow as it warms; can't really say there's much to sweet and fruitness other than caramel and cherry.","clayrock81","Dec 22, 2010"
3.77,6.2,3.5,4,4,3,3.5,"All in all a very respectable effort. The degree of smokiness tended to push all other flavors out of the way, detracting a bit from what could have been a more nuanced complexity. (The label boasts of "rye and four other malts," so assuming that there'd be a good portion of pilsner or munich malt as the base, and probably a carafa malt to deliver the mahogany color, I don't think one can tell form the end product what those other two malts are.)

Nose is of sweet, dark, roasty malts; black licorice, molasses, smoked peat, burnt chocolate and coffee are all present. The taste is similar to the nose with the smoky characteristics coming to the forefront. The beer is dry but not terribly acrid with a very thin carbonation. The increased ABV increases the drying effect but doesn't seem quite as high as the 8.17% listed on the bottle.

Lingering, somewhat fruity sweetness. Hops are nowhere to be found. While nowhere near balanced it seems to work. I can imagine this with a pulled pork sandwich or some juicy ribs. Body is appropriate for style. While I almost want to dis this for being overbearing smoke wise I cannot. To hell with any sort of style.

3.78,6.5,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"A smoked rye doppelbock...hell yeah.Poured a a full deep amber with a large off white head that settled very slowly,just nice to llok at.Aromas are big in fruity malt with a tinge of sharpness I am guessing from the rye,the smoke is faint at first but some hardwood comes through as it warms.Flavors show of the light smoke the most,not much fruit and or sharpness, some molasses and brown sugar come into a lingering finsish,the mouthfeel is light to medium.Iam guessing its food friendly, but it just seems to be missing something.","oberon","0"
3.24,-8.7,4.5,3,3,3.5,3.5,"Aroma is smoky, peaty with a pronounced sterile gauze/band aid note. Not a fan. This carries over into the flavor too unfortunately. At room temperature, there's an underlying warm maltiness and light rye spiciness. Even carbonation and a full body. A sipper probably best paired with cured meats. Not the best use of smoked malt, hope they reformulate with less band-aid in the mix next batch.","emerge077","Oct 05, 2009"
3.97,11.8,4,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Overall, I think the smokiness of the roasted malts overpowers the rye flavor, which I think should be more present. Ryes are supposed to be sweet and rich, not robust and charred. It's almost like drinking charred bbq ribs.","stevenseg","Oct 02, 2009"
4.25,19.7,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Whoa! Man, love this beer right off. Yummm.... Served with a large, foamy, light tan head and a little lace. Color is deep dark amber with chestnut hightlights. Aroma is a luscious, rich, smokey, dark malt, raisins, dark ripe fruit, leather, and a bit of dark cocoa. Flavor's about the same with sweetness coming out at the end. Great body and carbonation. Boozy at the very end. A session beer for slow, easy quaffing.","drpimento","Sep 28, 2009"
4.06,14.4,2,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Medium mouthfeel. Very drinkable - no noticeable alcohol burn, and I'm not getting any rauchbier fatigue.","brc","Sep 25, 2009"
3.87,9,3.5,4,4,4,3.5,"Drinkability depends on one's tolerance for smoked beers; I personally enjoyed its uniqueness, and a good rachbier in general, so perhaps you will too.","Natural510","Sep 20, 2009"
3.77,6.2,3,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Taste: First the malt sweetness. Than the porky smokiness. Smoke lingers on the tastebuds for a while and I get hints of chocolate in the aftertaste. Much more mellow and balanced than I was expecting.","BierFan","Sep 12, 2009"

4.04,13.8,3,4,4,4,4.5,"I would have liked more smoke, like some of the Bamburgs have, but there is enough to keep me interested and certainly enough to pair with pulled pork. I'm not the biggest fan of dopples, but I could see myself having another.","ypsifly","Beers"
