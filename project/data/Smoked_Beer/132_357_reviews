"O-Pleasant smoke ale with light balance. The smoke flavor isn't overwhelming and I'd prefer more of it also more carbonation."

"OVERALL: A nice smoked beer, solid flavor, ideal for a smokey bbq outdoors. Would go great with roasted pork."

"Half a finger white head, clear light orangish amber body, a few streams of bubbles rising to surface, good lacing. Mild smoke aromas, a bit sweet balanced by floral hops, pretty subtle smoke-wise. The smoke comes through taste wise, beechwood predominates, fairly sweet, complex smokiness though no ashtray, nicely balanced. Mouthfeel is medium decent effervescence. Along with Caldera Ur Bock, one of the PNW better smoked beers, though this is harder than hell to find. Worth a try."

" This smoked ale has a good malt body with light woody notes and a nice smokiness which gives a nice complimet to the slight piney element from the hops which also seem to go well with the yeast which is mildly fruity. There is a subtle caramel and wood synergy that brings the smoke forward on the palate, yet doesn't go to far either. I really enjoy how it doesn't get too sweet either. Overall I was impressed by this since it is obviously a Northwest version of a classic rauchbier it doesn't stick the style completely-Rogue puts its own stamp on the style and it is very pleasing to my palate with just the right amount of smoke flavor."
"It paired well with the pulled pork at the brewery, but I'd go for a Chipotle if I did it again."
"A simply, lightly malty ale. There isn't really any smoke here. What the heck?"
"smokey-flavored with a bacon finish (and some cinnamon at the end, also). nutty and sweet. dry finish (yes, with the bacon). too dry to hold up a delicious smoke level. dry euro hop flavors: funky. the hop contribution is perhaps the classiest element of the beer (the smoke is cool...)"
"D - Very drinkable for a smoke beer. The flavors play nice and don't overwhelm your palate."
"But a good blend overall and because it's not too meaty it's more drinkable than many rauchs/smokeds I've had."
"O: A smoke ale. It is what it is."
"Drinkability: this beer is pretty good, but I wouldn't write home about it. Drinkable, but not fantastic."
"This was my first smoked beer, and it was alright. I would like a smaller amount of it to actually have with some BBQ or some campfire goodies. I think it would work even better there."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, while there may be better smoky beers out there, this is a good beer to drink for a while if you're in the mood for the style."
"4/3.5/3/3.5/3"
"solid enjoyable beer"
"A very smoked ale, balanced and thirst quencher. Easy to drink..."
"D: Extremely good for this style! Smoked beers are generally rather hard to put down, so this one is exceptional."
"Rogue does indeed put out some great brews, and this one is of no exception. Smokey, delicate, balanced, and very drinkable. I can see the parallels drawn between this type of beer and the German Rauchbier, but the peaty character really distinguishes the style. I'd say this one is worth picking up, whether you are a fan of Rogue or not."
"A pleasant, balanced, well-made beer...as is usually the case with Rogue."
"Very good on drinkability, though I'm a bit biased when it comes to this style. I could drink it all night."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable, I found myself flying through my 22oz. The hop finish does nothing but make me want to go back for another gulp. I could drink this all day."
"D: Its unique. It would be paired well with a bloody mary. One of the lighter smokes I've had."
"The smokiness on the flavor is unique...almost cedary, maybe the beechwood gives it that characteristic. Hops are definitely in here more than most smoked beers. Flavor is woody and the malts caramely, a touch toasty and certainly sweet. Unique take on the style with the dose of saaz and I am not quite sure the combo is my cup o' tea. I like it more than most Rogue beers, but far from my favorite rauchbier."
"Rogue Smoke Ale is a slightly hazy amber ale with a small white head that mostly dissipates and leaves solid lacing on the glass. It has a smokey, slightly sweet aroma with a peaty note. There's something like beef jerky in the nose. It's pretty light bodied and crisp, with a finish that's kind of sharp. Yeah it's smokey-- almost like barbeque. There's a tartness from the malt and a spicy bitterness going on too, so it's not just the smoke going on. It's a nice blend of flavors and it's well balanced. It's an interesting and engaging beer."
"D: Split the bomber and paired it with wild boar bacon. The beer is good lets hope the pizza pairs well. Nice beer."
"D: a delicious brew that is well worth a try. One of the better varieties of a rare style."
"This is my first smoked ale, and I do enjoy it, although I can see why others do not enjoy it."
"(My 600th review, how about that...)"
"Poured a orangeish body with a good head that died slowly and left some lace. A mix of light smokey/meatiness and hints of sweet (caramel) malt as well. Real smooth, semi-creamy even with a medium body that passes not only with some meat/smokiness (even woody) but with some sweetness and then finishes clean with a minor hoppy bitterness backbite. A real pleasant beer that is enjoyable and distinct with the different and balanced feels to it. Glad I got to try it."
"D: It's very interesting, but for the price and taste I could not buy this again. It's worth trying at least once. Very surprising what some people can create."
"Finally, every other place was out of this. Poured clear amber-brown with a minimal white head. Rich smoked wood and bacon nose. It smells like a just-lit campfire with a solid hop backing. Creamy mouthfeel with a long finish. Taste is just what I want with my smoke ales: STRONG smoke. Hearty, peaty, oaked, and hopped. Some balance with the malt. Spicy hop finish. Incredible. Its like a Aecht Schlerenka in ale form. I could drink this all night."
"650mL bomber poured into tulip glass. Pours a hazy copper color. Thick head rapidly disappears. Smokey campfire aroma is very apparent. Taste is smoke and malt with some hops and citrus. Is also quite dry. Pretty good stuff but not really sessionable."
"Drinkability: A good not great smoked beer. I will look for this again, but one bomber is enough. I do like to smoke combined with the hops."
"Resinous chewy mouthfeel with a very roasted smoked malt flavor with hints of charcoal, campfire ash, barbecued bacon and butane as well as a crisp dry bitter citrus hop presence. The citrus hops sweeten things up a bit and provide an interesting balance to the smokey flavor."
"Watery and cloudy brown with rapidly disappearing head and no noticeable lacing. Aroma of frying bacon. Taste is gritty, smoky but a bit thin on body. Not much malt or even hop flavor, maybe it's hiding. Brief aftertaste of campfire. Interesting but not terribly."
"D- For me, through the roof. I love a good smoked beer, and Rogue has brought its heavy guns to this battle. I am impressed, and find this to be almost an equal to the Schlenkerla beers, which is about the highest compliment I can pay any smoked beer. Seek this one out, cherish it, and bathe in it if you must. A world-class beer."
"As far as smoke beers go, this one is pretty damn tasty. The smoke isnt overwhelming but one can certainly taste it. I was hoping to have a little more smoke in the nose, though. Finishes dry which I think complements the smokiness. Long bitterness in the plentiful finish. A sure winner in the smoke department."
"I had this on tap at the Rogues Ale House in San Francisco, pint glass. The beer is somewhat dark, brown and hazy with a thin white film of foam on top. The aroma was smoky but not as strong as I'd expected or hoped, more like a Schlenkerla beer dialed down to 75% intensity. Along with the salami smokiness I guess I'd say this was more malty than hoppy, somewhat sweet or toasted malts. The taste was similar, toasted malts with enough smoked flavor to keep you happy (if you like that style of beer), I can't say I tasted much of the hops which I expected based on Rogue's decription of the beer. Anyway this is a good smoke beer, I like it enough that I'll look for it in bottles sometime at home."
"D - This was a very good beer, my first Smoked Beer, and I was hooked, very nice and rich flavor for such a small beer"
"D: I was quite underwhelmed by this one. It is far from the original German smoked beers. This is more like an American mildly hoppy beer with a touch of smoke to it. It's to clean and uncharismatic."
"I give this puppy good marks for drinkability. Extremely interesting beer to review - highly encouraged that you seek one out."
"A nice even dose of smoke, after having a few of those Scottish peat monsters. Good as an exposure to a special style, but not something that I'd want to have more than one of."
"Drinkability: Moderate drinkability. Does not sit heavy but I personally would switch to something else after having a couple in one sitting."
"This beer pours a hazy amber with a thick frothy off white head that leaves some spotty lacing on the glass. Nose is of smoked goodness with a touch of sweet caramel and toasted malts to it. Smokiness is not overpowering. Taste is of toasted malts up front, pale malts mixed with smoked flavoring take the middle with the malts at the forefront, finish is slightly sweet. Medium bodied, medium carbonation, thick creamy feel to this beer. This is a very nice smoked ale to sit with for a while."
"This beer pours a mahogany hue with decent carbonation that leaves a one finger head,it has aromas of smokey wood and a very distinct hop smell which overpowers the smoke smell,it tastes very pleasant i was abit worried about not liking this style of beer but i actually really do it has an average mouthfeel with tastes of smoked peatiness with fruity hops which definately balance out each other very well quite a nice beer that i would recommend and suprisingly enough easy to drink more than one of."
"M/D: Medium bodied, carbonation is medium at best making for a smooth body. Drinkability is good. I'm sure I'd tire of the smoke eventually but I could put down a few of these. Very solid beer."
"Drinkability: It's enjoyable. A pleasant, well-balanced beer with a nice level of everyday smoke character."
"D: One bottle was both nice and interesting, but now I'm ready to drink something else. And considering the high price I'm probably not going to buy this beer again."
"An elegant and quite conservative smoked ale. I like them a bit more aggressive."
"I had this beer a couple nights ago after wanting to try it for awhile. It was a amberish-hazy beer. The smell wasn't strong on the smoke but it smelled more like a pale ale. The taste was like a pale ale until it warmed up, then the smoke came through. I found this beer very drinkable and I can't wait to have another!"
"I love this and it went very well with our BBQ Pork (smoked) Another winner from Rogue. Well done!"
"D-Not very, I really didn't like this and ended up saving the rest to use as a marinade. Glad I tried this, I was curious about it, but smoke flavor in beer is just not my thing."
"If you have never had a rauchbier before this is a good introduction to the style. Even if you find that you don't care for them, you will still be able to finish this one without too much pain. Nice one to expand your palate with since it is not too extreme but you will still taste the smoke, then you can decide if you like this style."
"D - It's pretty good, not overly smoked."
"This is an interesting take on smoked beers, a little less smoke, a little more hops."
"D - Absolutely delicious flavor. In a world with very few smoked beers, this is a welcome for people like me. Fantastic flavor and decent alcohol level allows for a few of these. My only disappointment is that this is not available in my state (yet)."
"A great beer, I'll look for this one again."
"Very good brew, but given the flavors I'm not sure I could drink too much of this in one sitting. Very good introduction to the style, this is one of few for me. The traditional ale characteristics were a little tough to find for me amongst the smoky character."
"Overall this isn't an overly intense smoked beer and is one that is worth a shot."
"The astringency knocks the drinkability down a touch, but this is still a pleasant brew, full of flavour but not too intense for this smoked beer n00b. I can certainly see having this sometime with barbecue."
"This makes me crave fresh sausage. I'd use some to make a caraway beer mustard."
"D- You might not like it if you don't like the smell of smoke or the taste of smoked meat but why are you trying it then. Other wise delicious."
"Like the beer, but not a real ""session"" beer, IMO."
"That said, I wish this style of beer was more available. And I would love to find a beer in this style that is even more intense."
"If this is a good starter smoked beer, I'd like to try a more advanced version. It might be fun to revisit this every now and then, though."
"The aroma was smoked fish meat smell. It reminded me of a barbeque. Throughout the drink the smoke never left you. If you don't like smoked foods I don't think you would like this one. There was a nice bitterness on the finish. It is a well balanced beer and after a couple of sips to acclimate yourself it was wonderful. Well done by the guys on the coast."
"I poured from a 22 ounce bottle into a standard pint glass. The beer pours a hazy orange with a pillowy white head. The aroma is pure smoke, in a good way. It reminds me of meat over a smoker. The smoke flavor is up front but not over the top. The finish is a bit sweet. The bottle states it is a hoppy smoke ale, I do not taste it. The beer is medium bodied and smooth drinking. I enjoyed it more than I thought I would."
"D - smooth and easy to drink."
"Smokey but with a slightly ceral grain and almost sweet corny taste. Yes the almost meaty smokiness and woodiness is here but seems a bit washed out, slightly sweet and again a slight citric hop bitterness. In fact the more I sip on this the less smokey it seems. At this point I can't really tell what I want, more smoke or more unaltered malt and hop flavors. Being s smoked beer I want more smoke and am not getting it right now. I like some things that are going on here, it is very well balanced has a good, solid mouthfeel and has a solid flavor profile, but the lack of a higher smoke content leaves me wanted just a bit more. Not a bad beer, but not something that I would drop nearly 7 dollars on, on a regular basis. A good beer to use if you want to ease yourself into the world of smoked beers, but really I say you should dive right in and get it over with."
"Drinkability is limited by the fact that the smokiness is so pronounced, but I would imagine that drank in combination with pulled pork or a barbecue brisket, this would be phenomenal."
"Mouthfeel is medium with lots of carbonation. I didn't have any problem finishing the bomber, but drinkability is really not that great considering the style."
"Watery feel but still real strong. Needs to be thin to balance out the rest of the flavor. This baby makes you FULL! This beer is a meal unto itself. Very smoky and filling. Tremendously pleasing."
"I am not a fan of smoked beers at all and this is no exception. It poured orange/red in color, thin head, it smelled of smoke, tasted of smoke with maybe some hops coming through, I didnt like this very much, I will not be having this anytime in the near future."
"D: Great drinkability per style and well balanced. Easy to drink in multiples and ranks up there with Aecht Schlenkerla, the standard of smoked beers."
"D- I will probably drink this again. It really isn't in the league with Aecht Schlenkerla, but it's pretty damn good as is."
"M + D: Lighter, but nearly a medium body... a crisp carbonation. It's surprisingly refreshing. Although lighter in alcohol, the flavour can get a little intense as a glass goes on, so if enjoying a bomber alone, it's more suited for sipping."
"A really nice smoke beer. Initially, all I could get flavorwise was smoke and a slight underlying caramel sweetness. However, as I became acclimated the smoke faded into the background becoming an accent to the fruity malty quality and strong floral hop. Matches well with some sharp cheddar."
"An easy to drink solid beer, nice with some cheese."
"Pours a hazy dark amber color with nice foam and good retention. Lacing is rather light. Nice aroma of smoked malts, some campfire, a background honey sweetness and caramel goodness. Good smokey flavor, with some hints of ripe fruit, light hop bitterness and pacman yeast dryness on the finish. Crisp, surprisingly refreshing, although I couldn't drink too many smoked beers in one sitting."
"We did a Rogue/Southern Tier tasting and this was the first in the lineup. I love both of these brewers for trying new things, but I wouldn't buy the Smoke Ale again. We had 5 people splitting the 22oz bomber and we all felt that it was interesting, but certainly couldn't drink an entire bottle by ourselves."
"Another winner from Rogue."
"For me this isn't an inherently drinkable style. This is a well-made effort, no question. Would prefer a 12 oz. of this to a bomber - as it warms the smoke takes over a little too much."
"Pours a nice amber color, nice carbonation, nice little tan head, which leaves some nice sticky lacing behind. The nose is malty, with some smokeyness, slight citrus. The taste is malty, smoky, with some citrus. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a tasty brew, would recommend."
"One of the more drinkable smoked beers. It is strong enough that if you don't like the style, you may wish to avoid. Otherwise, go out on a limb and give a go."
"This is a drinkable beer, especially if you like smoked beers. I'm not a big fan of this style but Rogue did very well here and I'd highly recommend it if you like this type of thing."
"The mouth is pleasantly crisp and almost lager like. This is an easy drinker and would pair very well with smoked hams, sausages, a buffalo chicken pizza or traditional German farmer fare."
"Overall not bad. It is certainly a smoked beer that is for damn sure, and one of the better ones I have seen. I would go back for another round without issue. This was certainly very well made, and I am more then slightly impressed."
"Rogue did a pretty nice job with this. I'm not all that familiar or experienced with smoked beers, but this one's pretty good. The nose could use a little strengthening, but it's a solid beer in all other respects."
"Ordered one this past weekend at Sunset Grille. Came served in a pretty large mug, which was a bonus. Not much head, and carbonation was minimal. Color was leather brown, with a hint of orange. Smell was smoky! Then the taste...more smoke! Very smoky indeed. If this is your first intro to this style, get ready. I've tried the Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier and this is a great example of an American brewer producing a high quality example of the style. It's rather strong in flavor, so one was more than enough for me. Must be a perfect companion to BBQ. Someday, I hope to pair them up."
"D: I really enjoyed this beer but I'm afraid the smokiness could get a little old after a few."
"I prefer the Schlenkerla Rauchbier that I have had in the past, and highly suggest. Nonetheless, this is a very good offering from Rogue."
"D: Well-crafted and tasty. I liked this more initially than I did at the end ( something I can't say about the German versions, which I've loved start to finish). Worth trying and certainly one I could have again."
"Drinkability is high. I finished the whole bomber by myself without much problem. I wouldn't pick up another right after it, but I might grab this one again sometime."
"D: I dub this smoke ale easy to drink for a smoked beer. I don't think I would sit down and have more then one or two however."
"drinkability is great. this brew screams to be paired with any kind of grilled red meat, making it a great BBQ brew. interesting at worst, and savory at best. cheers!"
"D. Not really. But it's a curious experiment and if you have one this old, it may have held up!"
"MF/D: This is very much a cup of tea beer - in that if it's your cup of tea, then this is down your alley. It's thick with nice carbonation, but I just didn't personally care for the taste which was too overpowering - my friend, however, loved it, although when I asked if he could session it, immediately said that one or two would be the limit. I think it'd be interesting if paired with some BBQ, or would do a tremendous job used in cooking (hmm, must buy some to marinate some ribs in!!)."
"D - Good brew, the smoke was more subtle then I thought it would be, but was very plesant. I hve been waiting a long time to try this beer, and it did not dissipoint"
"Amber-orange colour with a reasonable nearly white head. Smokey, woodsy malt smell with a faint iron smell to it. Light smokey smell, little hints of smoked meat, and a nice pale malt profile. Very low hop character. Not nearly as smokey as Mt. Begbie's Ol' Woodenhead and as such not as ""in your face."" The taste actually seems a little bit on the thin side, as does the mouthfeel - this should be much ""chewier"" than it is. Not a bad beer, but not the best that Rogue can do."
"Pours a rich amber with a cream colored head from a bomber. Medium thick head and semi lasting. Smell is lightly smoky and malty and a semi rich, nice creamy body. Mild malty tartness and some smokiness in the flavor but somewhat restrained. Pretty easy drinking and mild overall. Nice, but simple and perhaps a bit boring."
"Tasted on 2/11/08."
"D: Quite drinkable, especially for a smoke ale. A well balanced brew. Recommend with uncomplicated, heavy cheese (like a simple Vermont cheddar). (Note: I've had this cellared for 3+ yrs and it seems to be completely unaffected if not better for it.)"
"22oz bottle picked up @ the brewery in Newport. Pours into my mug a hazy amber color with a thick creamy head. Smell is a blend of smoky malt and light fruity hops. Taste is less smoky than i was expecting, but it's nice! Very earthy, with just enough peaty smoke flavor, and a pleasing amount of hops. Mouthfeel is also lighter than i was expecting. I guess i was expecting something more similar to a schenklera rauchbier, but i'm glad to be surprised. This is nice! I would love to have this again!"
"Poured into a Duvel snifter a nice dark copper almost brown with a decent frothy head that lasted and left great lacing. Aroma was burnt wood chips and burnt caramel. Taste is dominated by a smoky mesquite flavor with caramel and some pine hops not far behind. The beer was on the light side of medium, but the smoke flavor does provide for a slight astringency. This one is certainly one of the more enjoyable smoked beers I've had, just not something I'd likely seek out again."
"I got this bottle at Discount Liquor in Milwaukee."
"This was an overall very good selection from Rogue, although the smoked flavor was more subtle on this one... compared to Aecht Schlenkerla, for example, the taste was mild in comparison... slight smokey flavor is somewhat noticeable... more of a strong ale type of taste, but either way, the flavor didn't let me down... good stuff, easily drinkable with a great mouthfeel... bread and butter taste with a nutty flavor and aroma... dark-copper appearance with minimal head... slight caramel flavor with hoppy aftertones... excellent crisp, clear, clean taste... Rogue did well on this one and I would concede to say this was a decent depiction of the style... I would consider this a decent Smoked Beer, and it certainly did score for flavor and taste... the smoked flavor managed to make itself known... Good stuff... Recommended..."
"D: A very good brew. A great example of a smoked beer."
"Poured a golden orange with a decent head that gives a lace trace. Nose is wide open with a push of sweetened malt that is topped with a chunk of smoked fruit and peppers maybe even some wood smoke, but still rather mild. Taste begins smokey and melts out to several stages of malt character and rounds out with some hop before coming back to smoke."
"Recommend this one either to a fan of the style or to someone wanting to try for the first time. Have it with some bbq."
"Drinkability: Very easy to drink. I would definitely consider this a session beer. This was my first smoke ale, and I really enjoyed it."
"Drinkability: I believe this is the first beer I have had of this style. I loved it, but more than one bomber may have been too much. I recommend giving this a try to some one who wants to try the style."
"Well, this is certainly ""interesting"". You can certainly tell that it is Rogue. And, you can tell it is smoked. Pair with the obvious - smoked food."
"Not much here worth $6 a bomber, but I did get 2 of them, so Ill double check with the other bomber down the road."
"Pours a deep amber color with on off white head. Aromas of cedar and, well, beef jerky. Huge smokey aromas. Same in the taste, smokey, kind of like dinking beef jerky. A smokey aftertaste does hang around, but very clean on the mouthfeel. Love these style of beer. Always great for outdoor fall nights!"
"with pizza, by the way."
"A good beer from Rogue. Smoked beers are very interesting to me and this one seems to be well done. A little more sweetness than in others I've tried which is a nice change. I wish there were more smoked beers around!"
"D-A good smoke ale, i seem to remember this being smokier about 10 years back which was the last time i tried it. Still if you like smoke and amber ales this is a winner."
"ok so you see smoke beer and you wonder how are they going to pull this off. i know how the smoke aroma and flavor gets into scotch, but didnt make sense for beer. so i was very curious. wow does this beer ""smoke"" not decided as to whether i like it or not. Its much more intense than you might find in a scotch. i like the appearance because its hazy which reminds me of""smoke"". also the aroma and taste both almost completely contain smoke. with a mdeium creamy mouthfeel. its hard to look past the main aspect of this beer (smoke) if you liked smoke meat or foods, and crave the scotch with the most smoke this beer is for you. its not overpowering, but its there. im still undecided, but i can respect what the beer did and it is good, just not sure how good. 4 is solid and so is this beer"
"Bottom line: I think it's pretty good but it's not something I'd drink on a regular rotation. Try it and see what you think."
"D- This beer has an interesting flavor but I would like more malt flavor to compliment the smoke. It is not over smoked but more depth would be nice. The peat smoke flavor is soft and keeps the plastic Band-Aid flavor down."
"I have to be honest. This surprised me. I'm not familiar enough with the style to judge this on its authenticity, but it really is a good beer. Rogue didn't go wrong with this one. Well done."
"Another winner from Rogue. I haven't seen this one around very often but glad I finally got a chance to pick it up. Very enjoyable hoppiness balanced by the smoke. I'll pick this up again."
"Nice golden orange tinted with a decent head that gives a lace trace. The nose is wide open with a push of sweetened malt that is topped with a chunk of smoked fruit and peppers maybe even some wood smoke, but still rather mild. The taste begins smokey and melts out to several stages of malt character and rounds out with some hop before coming back to smoke. The body is thin enough to make it an easy drinker but substantial enough to make itself known. A good drinker to mix in."
"Taste - A heavy smoked flavor, not dissimilar at all from Kansas City style BBQ sauce. A good bit of fruity esters shine through the smoke along with the malts to give the beer a nice sweetness. Medium bodied, nothing particular interesting about the mouthfeel."
"Pours a slightly hazy orange/amber color with a small fizzy head. Very enjoyable aroma that features some malt with a nice smelling smoke flavor as well. The taste features some malt and a good amount of hops but the smoke flavor seems to dominate the taste a little much. I would have prefered for there to have been a little bit more backing the smoke flavor but it still is a good brew. Overall, it is a pretty good brew and definately something different from one of my favorite breweries."
"This is a decent smoke beer. I think it's a little heavy to drink more than the large bottle I purchased in one session."
"D-This stuff was a godsend.I have to pick up a couple bombers next time.It was really tasty and hits the spot.I would recommend this to anyone that enjoys good beer.Hail to the berlin wall for falling."
"My first finished smoked beer. Where rauchbiers have put me off, and they went down the drain, this beer was my first finished, smoked beer. The color is a ruby brown that makes me immediately think of slightly smoked oak stove lengths. Light bubbling in this thick, cloudy hue. The aroma is of a campfire you are 100 feet down-wind of. Lots of smokey wood qualities. Plus tpasty looking malts, but just smell smokey. The taste is a bit cloying. This 22oz bomber would go very well with a smoked pork entree of pulled pork and baby back ribs ...(BBQ sauce). The smoked wood dominates the palate. No hops seem to contribute to the flavor in any significant way. Hints of toasty malts and a little clove sweetmness lingers around the whole palate. The mouthfeel is a bit more over the top with smoke. I could not have more than one of these beers in one day."
"Poured out a darkish orange brown, cloudy, with a thin off white head, minimal lacing. Smells like my kitchen on Sunday morning, bacon anyone? On a side note, six degrees of Kevin Bacon? Killer stuff. But I regress.... Some malt, some mollasses, lots of hickory like smoke. The taste is a bit more balanced than the nose, ues lots of smoke, but not as sweet. There's malt, but a full body helps to balance the big smoke out. What's great about this is that the smoke is there when you drink it, but it goes away with the nice clean finish."
"Rogue Smoke Ale pours a deep copper color with a small white head from a brown twenty two ounce bottle. The aroma is malty, and smoke is noticeable. Starts out malty, then the smoke kicks in followed by hops and more smoke. I'm not really a huge fan of smoke ales, but this one is probably the best I've had. Not high on the drinkability scale for me, I think finishing the bomber may be a chore. Worth a try, especially if you like the style."
"D: This is a bit more subtle and isn't as intense as the Schenkerla rauchbiers, which could be a good thing or a bad thing, depending on your tastes. Being as this comes in a bomber, rather than a 500ml, I think that his is probably a good thing and contributes to this beer's drinkability."
"Not my cup of tea. It's like cracking open a beer after sitting for hours around some sort of mesquite campfire."
"Overall, a great bold and complex tasting Rauchbier. This tasted like the Chipotle Ale without the annoying spiciness that masked the finish. Now excuse while I go enjoy the rest of this with a bag of pork rinds."
"($3.49 / 7 oz. Rogue-XS bottling)"
"This beer pours a burnt orange amber with a giant tan foamy head. This beer is a work of art to look at. The smell is a strong smoked wood odor,almost a sweet malt. Very nice. The taste is creamy and smooth,the smoke flavor is dominate ,but doesn't smother the other more subtle flavors which include malt, hops, and some fruit,cherry? The m/f is light and very well balanced. An excellant beer for a BBQ, but I can't say I'd more than one or two of these. I really like this beer, it's just that the flavor is different and may be tough to have more than 2."
"Cheers!"
"So yeah, salmon beer. Never thought I'd see the day. Somehow, though, it works...I just wish it didn't also sit in the glass like a dead salmon after a minute or two."
"22 oz bomber. Pours a light copper color with a finger of off-white head over top that falls to a solid coat over top, maintained by a fairly constant bubble up the side. . Clarity on this drink is excellent. The aroma on this one conveys a very solid sweet smoke, with a moderate caramel maltyness hanging below it. The smoke is strong, but not offensive, and the sweetness is just right for me. I like it. Flavor is also dominated by smokey flavors. Again, the smoke is very nicely sweet, with a definate caramel base behind it. Before swallowing hte beer, it has an edge to the smoke, but then after swallowing it, the sweetness really takes hold. The aftertaste has the smoke fading a bit, with the caramel sweetness coming in more. I think this is a pretty nice smoked beer. Mouthfeel is moderate to thick, with a nice moderate carbonation. It is a little dry on the finish, seeming to pull the moisture from my tongue. I'd rather the dryness not be there. Overall, I think this one is definately drinkable. It has a nice balance of sweetness to the solid smokeyness. It is very lively and really tastes good to me."
"Drinks fairly easy. This more restrained than I remember tastes I've had in years past. This is an excellent breakfast (with eggs & grits!) or BBQ beer. This could almost pass as a Bamberg Rauch IMO, almost"
"This beer is a little more carbonated than i'd like, nonetheless it goes down pretty easy and is another quality beer from rogue"
"Drinkability: Quite consumable. Complex, inviting flavor; it's satisfying while not filling. A unique beer that is an altogether good experience."
"Pours a deep reddish-copper which is moderately cloudy and forms a three finger light beige head that lasts forever but leaves relatively little lacing. Smell is...smoked salmon. Peppery and clove notes and a deep woody smokiness with a definite note of fish in the background. Taste is heavily smoky at first, with a nice spiciness and some interesting woody notes, but then the finish is all fish again. Mouthfeel is thick, rich, and nicely carbonated, but the drinkability isn't great. I just couldn't get the thought that I was drinking a salmon smoothie out of my mind, and that kind of killed this one for me."
"It poured a dark copper to brown with a reddish tint when held up to a light. The head was small and faded quickly. The smell was malty, a bit sweet, and full of smoke, which was a good sweet BBQ type of smoke. The taste starts with a sweet malt flavor with a trace of hops then the smoke hits you. The smoke flavor is not as overwhelming as I was afraid it might be, it was perfect. The mouthfeel was about in the medium range, somewhat lighter than I thought it would be, with adequate carbonation. At first taste I was not sure if this was going to be a very drinkable beer with the smoke taste. I found that as I became accustomed to the smoke it became much more drinkable. However this would not be my choice for a session beer, it's more of a drink with a meal beer. I would really like to have this with some slow smoked ribs or maybe even some smoked salmon."
"It seems to get more and more drinkable as you go, but the 22oz serving is probably a bit much. I bet this would go fantastically with some barbecue."
"Copper color body with a very thick head that held up for a little while. The smokey aroma was mellow and not overpowering like some beers of this style. Kind of sweet maltiness that finished with the flavor of smoke and a slight hop character. Nothing bitter about this one. Medium body with a smooth, almost creamy-like mouthfeel. I really like this beer...but I can probably only handle it in small doses. 22 oz. is a bit much for me due to the smoke flavor, it gets to me after awhile. Otherwise this beer is a highly drinkable one."
"Reddish brown clearish appearance (translucent on the second glass), decent small-bubbled head of about one finger after settling a while. Rings of fairly thick lace. Nice aroma, plums and an appetizing applewood kind of smoke, though there are elements of musty thicker-barked wood. Light mouthfeel, carbonation is fairly high, overall a nice body (though I personally would like it to be a bit fuller). Easy drinker here, mainly a neutral malt with an apparent smokiness but nothing that is at overwhelming. Aftertaste is pleasant, a continuing ""campfire"" sense that becomes more pronounced on warming. Hops also become more evident at the close, though to me, it might have been interesting to see how an even higher hop level added to the complexity (though mainly for my own entertainment). Still, I would recommend this one to someone looking for a nice and relatively accessible Smoked beer."
"This one is an odd duck, but a good one nonetheless. I'll try this one again in the future, probably once it warms up and I get the grill going. I'm willing to bet the smoky features on this one will go well with barbeque and the like."
"D: I could drink this beer all day. One of my favorites by Rogue, this beer put them on the map for one of my favorite breweries. I would highly recommend this beer for a night backyard BBQ or watching the game with some wings. Cheers!"
"I undoubtedly purchased an old version of this brew. Though old, my impressions are strong. Purchased at the Party Source in N. Kentucky, the 7oz. bottle displays a pink painted Rouge character and stated, ""Bottled in 1995"" upon a brown bottle with a cap that says 'Florida'. Anyway, a solid and well rounded smoke and hop aroma was instantly displayed. Dark amber to brown with a light haze. Virtually no carboation detected. Rich malt and smoke flavors on a moderate body makes the smoke more apparant. Texture is smooth and lightly rich. Thin and light body, partly due to the lack of carbonation. Noticable notes of soy sauce and sherry flavors in the finish. Would have been great to have this one in it's prime."
"A decent brew, but I think I'll stick with Rauchbiers and smoked porters."
"d"
"I was most impressed with the dazzling array of aromas in this beer. It is a combination of so many unique smells. The taste was good but it may not be for everyone."
"This brew pours a cloudy brown color. The head is one-finger in height, creamy and white. The aroma is of smoked malt, and more smoked malt. The taste is of smoked malt with some caramel in the background. The mouthfeel is a little lighter than medium bodied, with a lot of carbonation. Overall, this is a decent brew, but nothing to go crazy over."
"This beer poured quickly but looked somewhat flat with no head retention. The color is an opaque amber. There is a strong aroma of smoky bacon that is unmistakable. The smokiness caries through the first taste, and there is a definite bitterness and sourness to the beer, but no real sweetness. It feels thin and flat in the mouth. The smoke flavor is very distinct on this one but it doesn't yield to many other flavors. I would say the beer is one-dimensional and could use more maltiness to give it balance."
"This is very drinkable if you like the style. The flavor is great and I had no trouble getting through this one. I kept wanting more and still do. I will go back for this one again and again."
"tasty. session beer? eh.. maybe under the right pretense, I still think it may be a bit much after awhile. Put this in the ""definitely worth checking it out if you see it but dont go ape looking for it"" category."
"Drinkability and Notes  Definitely session-able the smoke never gets to aggressive or annoying. This is a tasty American version of a Rauchbier, in my opinion only one notch below some of the finest German examples. The fact that this was made with ale yeast really doesnt affect the flavor, the smoke covers any difference the yeast makes."
"Body is a reddish amber color with good sized off white head. Nice big smokiness up front with plenty of caramel malt sweetness in the back. Light hops. Flavor is similar with plenty of smoke up front but not enough to be over bearing. Solid sweet malt backbones adds a bit of balance to this. Ends on a light smoky note. Solid mouthfeel and smooth and easy drinking for a smoked beer. Definitely on the lighter side of the smoked beers but tasty and enjoyable anyway."
"This is definitely an interesting brew, much smokier than the other examples that I have tried."
"A nice smoked beer from Rogue. Poured out to a brown / orange color with a small fizzy head. Medium carbonation. Some notes of lace around the glass. Aroma of smoked malts and grain are present, as is a sweet hickory element. Taste was a bit softer than the aroma, but still very nice. Flavors of smoke, wood, earth and minor hints of hops. Rather nice, I must say. The mouthfeel was a bit on the light side, but still respectable enough to rise above many others. Good drinkability, this brew would make a great combo with cheeses and breads, or go well on it's own. Not as good as a traditional rauchbier, but still very well made and enjoyable. Recommended."
"Surprisingly fizzy head which dissolves to nothing after a few seconds. Absolutely zero when it comes to lacing...copper-tinted color. The taste is initially beef jerky in a bottle. The finish is so dry and woody..I don't really understand the appeal, but then again, so far I haven't been much of a fan of smoke beers. O'Fallon's Smoked Porter was so-so, in my opinion, and this one is probably a step down from that. I wouldn't be so dissapointed if I wasn't expecting the high quality I usually get from Rogue. Not one I'm likely to buy again, especially for the price."
"bomber bottle, typical Rogue lack of freshness indication, this one pours medium amber, slightly orange tinged, and abit cloudy, off white head, initially puffy, settling down to a minor film. This one leaves gobs of thick lacing. Nose is mildly of rubbery old gym shoes and some malt. this creation is moderatly smoked to my taste buds. Tastes like the malts have been smoking for a reasonable/judicious amount of time. Clearly this would be a fine choice to go along with some BBQ or other smoked foods. Another fine brew from the crafty folks @ Rogue"
"I think I am in love with smoke beers and this Rogue offering doesn't do anything except make me want them even more than before... What a wonderful beer... It pours a nice orange/amber color and has a decent white head. It's aroma is filled with a robust smokiness that I can get lost in and the flavor is very much the same in that regard. It is damn fine all by itself, but would be killer paired with some smoked foods."
"Pours a dark cherry red with a thin white head that quickly fades to a ring. Aroma is smoked saugage, burnt wood, some floral hops. Taste is good---sweet smoky cheese and saugage flavors wrapped in a nice caramel malt with a slight hoppy campfire aftertaste. Medium bodied with a nice carbonation level, this is a smooth drinker. This is my first smoke ale, and while it definitely tastes better than I expected, the smoke doesn't really refresh and I needed a glass of water to finish the last 6 oz of the bomber. Also, I had this with barbeque--I think the smoke would be too much for me on it's own."
"Overall - an excellent example of this style. Very refreshing beer and very drinkable..."
"I'm a greater fan of the style than most and although smoke beers are definitely made for sipping a had no problem downing a 22 ounce bomber of Rogue Smoke. It truly is a grand example of its style and a great way to cap off an evening."
"Dull orange in colour with a small off white head. Faint smoke aroma, along with notes of sweet malt. The dominant flavor is obviously the smoke, but its a bit more mellow than other smoked beers that Ive tried. The malty munich flavor that I tend to associate with Rogue beers isnt quite as dominant either. This beer gains points for being balanced, but I would have liked a bit more ""umph""."
"The tase, welll, I must say I am pleased. I am used to the idea of a smoked stout, or porter, but not a standard ale, and this has just become a new, and great, drinking expeirence. Smoke comes through right away, but not in an overbearing sense. Just there, a deep, balanced with hop, smokey flavor, not like smoked meats, but like a fall campfire. Very nice in the management of hops and smoke flavor. Solid malt aftertaste just washes everything down, in a great finish. The over all balance of this brew strikes me, from the smokey flavor to the malty finish. Good job from Rouge, and props for saluting the fall of the wall"
"M&D: medium-bodied and very flavoursome, this rather well-balanced beer manages to present its smoky characteristics in an understated manner. But the aftertaste gradually turns thiner and leaves a bit sugary residual taste on the swallow, similar to what the famous Schlenkerla Marzen showed me in the end, which I suppose is the weakest link in this beer's overall structure. All in all, I like this beer very much, but I'd like to see it coming in a smaller bottle, 500ml at most or even better 330ml, for, although this beer's aroma is consistently pleasant, the complexity of its taste cannot sustain long enough for more than two half-pints and still remain interesting to me."
"Overall, coming from a usual non-fan of smoked beers, this one is actually pretty enjoyable. Decent taste, easy to drink due to the smoothness of it. I'd actually have another."
"This is one of the Rogues that's worth the money."
"Smoke Ale is good beer. It won't satisfy anyone looking for an overwhelmingly oily, hugely smoky fix (Schlenkerla), but it is a well-crafted ale that uses its smoked malt judiciously rather than promiscuously. This was a pleasant surprise and I'm glad that my local grocery keeps it in stock. 'Dedicated to the fall of the Berlin Wall'. I'll drink to that."
"This beer goes PERFECTLY with dry-roasted peanuts! Yum!"
"This brew appears as a deep orange/brown color. Poured a decent head which dissapated qucikly and is leaving no residual lacing. Nose is an interesting blend of the smoke used for meats on the grill and floral hops. Taste initially is overwhelmingly heavy with the smoke but as I continue to sample this brew the hops presence is becoming stronger. Mouthfeel is good, full and lively on the palate. Overall drinkability is OK. This beer grows on you."
"Complemented it very well, the smoke and the salmon plus the pepper and the hops"
"Pours a clear, deep reddish orange with about .5"" of cream-coloured bubbly head fed by some vigorous carbonation with some excellent retention. Some sweet malt and some hops detectable in the nose, but it's largely smoke. Smells like smoked haddock or other whitefish. Quite pleasant. Some sweet malts at first and then the smoke flavour kicks in on the first sip. The smokiness continues for a little while and eventually gives way to the hoppy finish which lingers pleasantly. The smokiness is just right for me. Very lovely. The mouthfeel is a little thin and carbonated for me. I prefer this to some of the German rauchbiers which are a less subtle I find. I'm pretty sure the smoked malt is different. This is much more of a smoked fish flavour than smoked ham. Very very tasty, and a nice sipping brew."
"My gawd, I think I'm drinking a salami sandwich. It's actually kinda tasty, and a lot better than eating Subway. Appearance is a deep amber color, and cloudy as usual for a Rogue. I didn't know anyone made beers that taste like a smoked deli sandwich. I suppose if beer is liquid bread, then it's not so farfetched. I enjoy the taste of this beer well enough, but I can't see myself buying it again. If offered one, however, I would not refuse."
"Big head, cloudy brown. Aroma of smoke but also floral hops. Smoke, fruity peach,grassy hops, carmel, malt sweetness, more smoke. A Rogue is there behind the smoke. I may like it without all the smoke. Thanks MDS, Radekfest 05 sample 28. Medium mouthfeel."
"Just a great beer. This might be the perfect smoke beer to begin sampling this style with. A beautiful match with the Cajun-style red beans and rice I'm having for a late lunch. Matches very well with rye bread as well. This might be the perfect meal."
"Dark amber nearly opaque brew. Small head, that did not last. The smell was smokehouse all the way. I grew up with Dad smoking chicken, turkeys and hams at least once a month. Sticking my nose in a glass of this brought back memories of those days. This starts out for about a millisecond like an amber ale then--pow--smoky flavor, like a hickory ham hits the palate. Mouthfeel is medium but the smoke flavor coats the mouth. There is a discernible hoppiness at the end that balances everything. This was served with Cincinnati-style chili (a three-way for those that know) and matched up very well."
"Pours a slightly hazy amber orange with a 1 finger beige head, didn't last to long, nice lace. Smell of a sweet high quality true smoked ham. Some caramel malt smells but mainly the smokiness is what comes through. The best way to describe this is an APA with some smokiness added. The first taste recognized is the smoke, then a nice caramel malt followed by just enough hop flavor and bitterness. I discovered that the more I drank this, the less I tasted the smoke, it is still noticeable, but just not as profound as the first few sips. A decent brew that is worth a try."
"Taste is mostly malty with a fairly sharp hoppy aftertaste. Clingly mouthfeel, feels like you're inhaling incense or standing over the charcoal grille while drinking it. Pretty light body and mild smokiness make this a nice beer, I imagine this would go great with pork ribs. Maybe not the best smoked beer but a good effort by an American brewery to mimic this German style."
"More bacon fat, please. Less malt sweetness and spicy hops."
"A reddish brown brew with an off white head. Decent retention and good lacing that does give way to minimal near the end. Aroma, you guessed it smoke. Reminders of putting the hickory smoke chips on the bbq. Reminded me of being back in Germany when the butchers had their smokers going. Underneath the Bbq aroma is a nice aroma of hops, not strong but they are present. Taste is a malt front then the smoke takes over to a mildly hop finish. I dint know what to expect but I enjoyed this brew. I do think after a few of these brews the smoke would get to me but one or two with a good meal or just to enjoyHell yea."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1 1/2"" tan head above the dark copper brew. Head exhibits some resiliency, with good foamy lacing. Aroma is of smoke mainly, with apparent malt and hops present. Taste is a pleasingly balanced, with smoke present but not overpowering, throughout the experience. Mouthfeel and drinkability both good, for a smoked beer. Nice representative of the style."
"This is a slightly hazey (some may say smokey) amber ale with a small off white head. The aroma is, you guessed it, Smoke and a hint of spicey hops in the background. Again in the flavor the smokeyness takes front stage. But the lightly sweet and the bitter hop finish balances out the flavor of the beer so that you are not overpowered by the smoke."
"Goes down as easy as any basic German lager, very easy to handle. I wasn't impressed with the smoke flavor at all, very mild. Still, a very drinkable brew."
"If you liked smoked beers, you must try Rogue Smoke Ale."
"This beer pours a dark color with very little head  actually no head. Came in a 7oz bottle from 1996. No carbonation. The aroma is definitely smoked - nothing much other than that. The flavor is the same - malty-smokiness. It's good, but I don't know how much of it I could take."
"Poured a dark orange-reddish color with minimal head, though it retains a film and leaves a little lacing. Aroma is almost all smoke, the more subtle smells aren't quite coming through. Flavor, of course, is also dominated by smoked malts, although it does have a degree of hoppy bitterness/dryness on both the front and the finish. I am a fan of smoke beers, and an even bigger fan of Rogue - if this sounds familiar you will like this. Otherwise, this is an aquired taste. Try it if you have an open-mind."
"Pours a dark orange color, huge off-white head, that has very good retention. Smells of woodsmoke, and not much more, very weird for a beer. Taste is very smokey, very dry and extremely cloying. I do not like this beer, the flavor is not enjoyable at all, and may be the first beer I have poured out in a long time. Get something else from rogue, who makes many different, palatable beers."
"Drinkability  Great mix of flavor and character here. Its not as harsh as a true German Rauchbier, which some find a bit too much."
"Pours a dark copper-amber with a thick light-khaki head. Smells of candy apple malt, smoked salmon, wet campfire, and faint citrus hops. Interesting. Tastes of smoke-tinged caramel malts up front, met by a charred shot of resinous, bitter rogueish hops. Finish is smoky, bitter, with lingering fruity malt. Not bad, but I tend to like smoked beers period. Decent mouthfeel, not overly big, and pretty drinkable for a smoked beer."
"Bottle: Poured a clear light brown beer with a medium bubbly off-white head with average retention. Aroma is comprised of subtle smoke and some malt, I was expecting a bit more smoke but Im not complaining since smoke beer is not my favourite style. Taste can also be described as lightly smoke with some nice malt to support the smoke. Overall, this is probably a more balanced smoke ale then what is generally known as smoke ale which I appreciated since this is not my favourite style."
"Largely clear, coppery-amber in hue with a slight peachy highlight, it is a lovely color. The head never developed much beyond a fizzy cap. This cap quickly turned into a collar, naked in the middle. There is no subsequent lacing. The appearance is pleasant but far from stellar. The nose is raunchier than I thought it would be, which is a great thing! My experiences with Smoke Ale lead me to believe otherwise. It is not Schlenkerla Urbock but what is? The bouquet has all the desired aromas like fatty bacon, charred wood resting at a campfire, hammy too. A pleasant surprise! The potency is solid; while it is not vibrant it is plenty healthy. I find it inviting. The bouquet had me thinking Raunch and not Rogue. I damn near forgot who brewed this and then I tasted it. Hops. Big, bright, American hops the fingerprints of Rogue. Please dont misinterpret, this is a damn tasty beer. Lovely stuff. It is just not a Raunchbier nor is like any Smoke Ale Ive tasted before. It is uniquely Rogue. With that said, the palate starts off with some fatty, hammy, charred woody flavors. None of these tastes are that loud and I am not wowed by the intensity. Again, I wasnt expecting to be. Still I can taste these qualities clearly. That is nice. True maltiness is never detected; I bet this beer would be considerably better with a maltier backbone. Depth is needed. In the middle the hops kick in, citrusy, bitter, kind of brash as they now stand above the initial flavors. By the finish the hoppiness dominates until the aftertaste, which is a nice mix of smoke, fat, and citrus. That might sound odd but it works. Yummy! Medium in body but it seems a tickle too thin, the carbonation is moderate, and overall the mouthfeel is decent. I found this beer to be very tasty. The hoppiness works well with the traditional smoked qualities. This beer would really kick ass with some tangy BBQ. I also found it very easy to drink as I am sailing through the bomber I purchased in Burnsville, MN. Recommended."
"Looks- Amber brown, with a tan fluffy head that slowly fades thin. Smell- all smoke to my nose. Taste- Watery beer that starts out tasting like smoke than becomes bitter sweet. The smoke stays with you long after the first drink. My first smoked beer, cant wait to try more"
"The appearance of this beer scores high for clarity and brilliance but is undercut by a lack of head and lace. Ultimately I like the architecture, but not the construction."
"Liquid gold and hazy with a nice fluffy head this beer smells like a rasher of bacon lives in the bottom of the glass. The taste was smoky with a bacon note but the backbone was in place. This is not the most intense rauchbier but it is easier drinking than Alaska's offering. I like this beer but I find that I actually crave more smokiness and intensity of flavour."
"Pours a clear amber-copper color, and is topped by a thick tan head. I get an immediate aroma of smoked malt, with perhaps a hint of maltiness lying underneath. The taste is smooth, lightly sweet, with a nice meaty middle. The smoke is first detected in the finish, which is long, drying and smoky. Interestingly enough the combination of smoke and malt in some way reminds me of oranges, though I can't quite say why. Though the beer is light as it goes down, the smoke adds a nice full richness to this beer that is quite good. This is somewhat subtle for a smoked beer, but it is a great level of smokiness for this particular beer, it is very well balanced."
"Sampled 3/25/04"
"I like rauchbiers... but this one left me wanting to try something else, as it was unsatisfying."
"Truly interesting beer. But after the novelty of the smokey smell wears thin, there's really not much to keep my attention."
"Thanks to budsboy for providing the porch."
"Update: I got ripped off. I bought a 7oz bottle of Rogue-XS Smoke Ale, thinking it was a different beast. Turns out it's the exact same thing you get in the 22oz bottle. Flat, too. $1.49. Still tastes good, though chalkier in the finish. Perhaps more suggestions of prunes and raisins just because it's probably older."
"Overall, a very nice smoked beer. The more of these I have, the more I like them!"
"This brew has an amber colored body, bubbly tan head on top. The scent is a charcoal like aroma. The best way i can describe the taste is that it tastes like a campfire. The smoke is the dominant flavor, with some subtle bitter hops. Med/full mouth. This is a new style for me so i dont have anything to compare it with, but i did like it overall."
"The beer pours a nice dark amber color with a thick frothy off-white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a sweet malt scent surrounded by a mild smokey aroma that gives it character. The taste is good. It has dry, yet malty flavor which is enhanced by an excellent smoke taste. It goes down easy and leaves a bit of an aftertaste. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a medium bodied beer with a little too much carbonation. This is a fine smoke ale. It has good smokey aroma and flavor."
"note: my first smoked beer, i enjoyed it with a pizza, this beer had notes that are very similar to the rogue imperial stout"
"I approached this with some reluctance, I've had some bad experiences with smoked beers in the past. This one could make me a believer, however. A masterful balance of smoke flavors that enhances rather than overpowers the malt. The aroma is a faint, not-quite hickory smoke. The smoke flavors are well integrated, and there was a subtle, sort of barn-yard funkyness lurking in the depths that gave the beer an almost dry-cured country ham flavor. An interesting beer, and, while not something I would want a lot of at a sitting, it was surpisingly drinkable."
"this is a delicious and complex brew. there isn't too much smoke so that it drowns out the other ingredients. i'd label it as complex and satisfying...and it would be a perfect compliment to some smoked meat and cheeses."
"Cloudy amber appearance with an off white head. Smell is very smokey as expected. But the taste had a much more toned down smokiness to it, which I liked. The smoke taste is there and lingers in my mouth but it does not overwhelm. Hops are quite spicy and mix excellently with the smoked malt. Other German aspects are there creating a smooth and creamy body. Alcohol becomes more of a precense the warmer the beer gets. Body was on the light side which made drinking this way too easy. I think I need more."
"$3.99 a bomber"
"Appearance: Slightly cloudy amber hue nice sized cream head leaves nice evenly strung lacing. Aroma: Wonderful balanced smokey aromatics with a nice amount of hops kicking around and a caramel malt profile is evident. Taste: Nice strong smokiness not in your face as some Bamber born rauchbier, but smokey all the same smoked malts blend well with the heavily hopped profile malts are reserved to some they are enought to not offend while others may yearn for more smoke. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied ale smooth carbonation as the end of the bottle nears body becomes a bit thicker. Drinkability: One of the best all around rauchbiers I've tasted so balanced yet heavily smoked."
"The malt sweetness and hop flavor develop a bit more after the beer warms a bit, but this is still probably the smokiest beer I've ever had. A bit much for me on its own, but I reckon it would go great with some BBQ."
"22 0z. bomber, and the first bottle I've ever seen, where I learned that this one is dedicated to to the fall of the Berlin Wall, and to all the great beer that issued forth from the great land of Deutsch."
"Got the last of the bomber, so it poured opaque with sediment and yeast. Color was dull muted cherrywood amber color, with a smokey look to it. Head was decent, but nothing special, with a bit of lace. The smell is, as the name would suggest, immediately smokey. Reminds me of a smoked cheddar cheese i had once. but there is a background of hops and malts definately, with a small lemon hint. Taste is smokey also, although in a more subdued manner than the smell. The malt is evident, and a finish of hops pushes through at the end. There is also a starchy grass taste to it as well. Mouthfeel is smooth, yet it leaves a starched dry feel on the tongue and roof of mouth."
"Out of the characteristic bomber pours this clear reddish mahogany ale with a sparkling thing head that settles to a spotty lace. The peaty smoke flavor is immediately evident in the aroma, but there's some good sweet malt lurking in the background. There's a figlike undercurrent, too. The hearty charcoal smokiness dominates the taste, overpowering the light citrus and floral touches, which each emerge steadily as the taste moves to a lighter and more balanced finish. More potently burnt than the Racer Red Rocket and the Stone Smoked Porter."
"Highly recommended and i cant wait to try more!!!"
"Drinkability - an interesting beer, probably good with a rack of ribs, but at only 7 ounces a bottle I may need a rack of these, too. Outside of food pairings this is drinkable as a novelty, but for me not much more. Just for experimental purposes I had this with some Mesquite BBQ Pringles and the smokiness is well subdued as the spices on the snack make the beer relatively less smoked, so it stands to reason if eaten with smoked or spicy food it will come across much less distinctive."
"When I first started the beer and the carbonation was present it was working well, but midway through it decided to go flat on me and my feelings on it took a severe hit, as did the drinkability. I think the moral of the story is to drink it with food, and make sure you get it down before the carbonation leaves town."
"Acidic - snappy bite, medium feel, different, would go great with Barbeque, especially smoked food."
"The smell and appearance were the highlights of this brew. Other than that, it was kind of hard to finish, due to the overwhelming hoppiness. Compared to other smoke beers that I have had, this was average. There taste was smokey for a second, but then got bittered out by the hops. Some may like this one, but I am more of a malt guy."
"Average sized off white foamy head, that reduces fairly quickly to a full layer of foamy lace. Body is clear and copper in color with some carbonation rising to the top. Becomes slightly cloudy on last pour, and white sediment settles on the bottom of the glass. Aroma is moderately malty with some graininess and caramel notes. Hops are also moderate on the notes with citrus notes. Not surprisingly, theres a definite smoke aroma that is also apparent. Great malty start with slight caramel noticeable. The malt character continues to be present throughout. Smoke flavor comes in towards the middle and lasts through the aftertaste. The smoke flavors meld quite well with the hop finish that nicely balances out the brew. Slight roasted notes are also apparent. The smoke notes seem to pick up more as the brew warms. I really enjoyed this brew. Enough smoked flavor to make sure you know its there, but not enough to become overbearing and make you loose sight of the well balanced malt and hop character of the brew. Too bad its not more readily available."
"Not much experience with smoked ales, but I may seek more after this. Pours a hazy copper orange color with a small head that died quick.The aroma is moderately hoppy with a good hint of smoke, but does nothing to prepare you for the taste. This beer tastes like smoked cheese, and I love it. Bacon fat and smoked cheese rule the tongue, with some hops trying to work their way into the picture, balancing things out. This is by far the ""Smokiest"" beer I have had. Mouthfeel is carbonated and slick at the same time, going down way easy. Immensly drinkable, but I imagine this is a ""hit or miss"" type beer. You either love it or you hate it. I love it."
"22 ounce bottle."
"A nice tasting beer, interesting style (my first of this style). I wouldn't say it's the best beer but its definitely a good one and an interesting one."
"I must point out I'm no expert in this genre of beer, but I simply cannot recommend a beer with one flavor feature so radically overpowering. If you really feel the urge to drink a liquefied sausage, this is your chance."
"I like to eat bacon, not eat it."
"I knew the beer that got me into the mug club wouldn't taste like shit!"
"I liked this beer..very tasty."
"Nice mouthfeel, but thats about it. I think the smoke flavor and aromas just didn't mix well with the rest of the beer. The spicy hops combined with the smoke to give a plastic flavor I couldn't stomach. I actually gave up after less than half a glass and poured the rest into the dog's bowl... He couldn't finish it either."
"My first true smoke beer. Orangey color with a low beige head. Aroma is distinct beef jerky. Flavor also reminds me of beef jerky, with a touch of saltiness (or am I imagining that?). Very light hops and malt, perhaps a touch in the finish. The flavor is very distinctly smokey, and all the way through the glass, still feels like tasting a piece of smoked meat. Interesting."
"Other: Screams for food. Cuz it was late and I was out of food in the house, I opted for jerky from the 7-11. I felt bad having the Bud of meat with something of such good quality, but wow did it pair well."
"Tastes like a hop charged amber ale, that sat in a wood smoker for a few days. Very nice, more subtle smoke flavor than the August Schlenka Rauchbiers I have had. Nice carmel malt sweetness lies underneath with a bitter snappy hop finish. Fairly dry finish, but some hop bitterness and smoke lingers enough for your tastebuds to crave another taste. Medium to light bodied. Flavors are bold, but balanced. Smokiness is not overly played. Bottom of the glass yeilds hints of peat and smokiness akin to an Islay Scotch Whiskey without the heat. Paired this with an oven roasted hickory smoked turkey and swiss sandwich and the exhaust fumes of the Brickyard 400. Perfect Match ! I could have this again maybe with a winter time smoked gouda or nice rubusto on the back porch."
"smoky, smoky, smoky! what a great brew. a dark amber ale wit ha medium head that dissolves to a nice lasting lace. the smoke smell hits you and doesn't quit. this brew is like liquid barbecue and had me craving some pulled pork and ribs. along with the smokiness, some spice flavours can be detected along with a bit of nuttiness. goes down smooth with just the right amount of carbonation. i really dug this brew and hope to find it again real soon. one of my favourite rouge ales."
"Man, another good brew from Rogue!This was my 11th different brew from these guys and once again I was impressed. Looked and tasted similar to the German Rauchenfelser I drink from time to time. Cloudy deep muddy amber with nice thick head that laced nicely. Aroma is smoky Beechwood and a subtle hopiness. Medium bodied and smooth with a slightly dry finish. Flavor is nice blend of the smoked malts with a generous dose of hops bittering nicely but not overbearing. I recommend this one only if you like smoked beers. I happen to, and Rogue did a nice job with this offering."
"This brew has a smoked sausage aroma. Medium head of fine light brown bubbles above a tempting cloudy dark brown body. Tastes like carbonated sausage too. It also has a strong smoke aftertaste."
"Pellucid light ruby hue. Fluffy vanilla white persistent head leaves loose foam trails. Mellow smoked malt and understated toasty Munich upfront in aroma, followed by medium lovibond caramel sweetness and subtle, red currant fruitiness. Overshadowed spicy hop nose. Surprisingly tame, but pleasant aromawise. A combination of caramel malt and dextrin sweetness hits the palate initially, then is contrasted by rounded, lingering smoke and moderate hop bitterness. Melanoidin tinged, grainy Munich malt undertone adds depth in malt character. Hint of grassy hop flavor adds a token noble presence. Moderate in body, but heavily dextrinous and approaching oily in mouthfeel, from the copious use of caramel malts. Plenty of residual dextrins, but not quite proteinaceous enough. As the beer breathes, smoked malt, although not overbearing, begins to envelope the palate. Finishes oily, smokey and lightly bitter. Almost a great smoked beer. It doesn't possess the depth or crispness of malt character demonstrated by Schlenkerla lagers, and the smoke character is almost peated like in nature. Rogue Smoke is nonetheless a unique, flavorful and enjoyable brew that I would readily drink again."
"Thanks to francisweizen for the bottle."
"F."
"I'm not a fan of most rauchbiers but when i saw a Rogue bomber i never tried i had to have it. This hazy copper colored brew has a medium to active carbonation that livens up the flavors nicely. The smoke and sweet maltiness seems more subdued than most other rauchbier i have had and it works well for this brew. The Saaz and Perle hops give a pleasant spicy and clean finish. I wish i saved this for later to have with the heavily smoked kielbasa i'm having for dinner."
"Personally, I did not like this beer. However, I believe that it is probably a good representation of the style."
"Pours copper in color with small head. Slight smell of smoke. Taste is smokey but in a subdued way compared to other smoked ales that I've had. Not as sweet as other smoked stouts or smoked ales. Don't get the ashy taste. A good intro to smoked beers but not quite the most unique smoked experience out there. Nice to know it is there in the Rogue lineup."
"Undated 7 oz bottle. Carefully poured off of the yeast it's only slightly hazy. The body is a deep orange-tinted copper. A short foamy head drops quickly to nothing. The aroma is quite astonishing and reminds me of my favorite smoked beer, the Alaskan Smoked Porter (also by John Maier). I guess that's the Alderwood. But there's also some sweet malt there that's just as inviting. The body is medium/light and quite smooth in the mouth as there's only a limited carbonation. The flavor starts with a rich and sweet Munich and caramel maltiness but soon gives way to smokiness. Very nice! The bitterness rises in the finish along with a palate coating smokiness. The Beechwood flavor is noticeable. Very well done with lots of smoke flavor, but not overly aggressive and cloying. Some minor hop flavor is also present throughout, although I suspect that this is an old bottle that's dulled considerably. Still, it's quite nice and I intend to enjoy a few more of these!"
"Cheers to Billy Stout for the sample!"
"I was given a pony bottle,  so I did not get allot but from what I got was as follows.  Color was a slight smoke clouded amber. Decent yellow-pale/smokey head. The lace seemed thick and mirrored the head.  The smell had hints of malt and smoke. The smoke was not as strong as I would have thought it would/should be in the smell.  Tasted slight hops, chocolate, coffee , slight sweetness but the smoke flavor was there.  A good style of beer and brand.  I would like to try a bigger bottle to get more."
"22 oz. bomber. Pours a deep, hazy amber color with a solid, well-retaining head. Smell is mainly of the smoked malts. Taste is quite smoky with the typical Rogue hop profile, which is quite robust. Would complement foods like smoked salmon well. Very enjoyable flavor. A smooth, relatively carbonated mouthfeel and solid drinkability make this an applaudable stab at the rauchbier style. Very good."
"F'king hops."
"I found a fresh bomber of this, so I'm re-reviewing it since my last sample was past its prime.  Pours a wood brown to amber color with a very slight haze, topped with a cream-colored head that stays very well in the 2-3 cm range.  A few splotches cling to the glass as it goes down.  Great smoked aroma, of course.  Reminds me of a barbecue.  Maltiness is detectable under this.  However, the aroma is not nearly as strong as it was in my aged sample.  In the flavor, the smoke is much more subtle than I expected.  Instead, a targeted and crisp rind-like hop bite takes center stage.  Caramel malt is detectable just under this, and is more evenly distributed on the palate than the hop character.  Gives a good balance between the two.  Much better body than my last sample.  Smoke is more present with retro-olfaction, and in the aftertaste.  Although I expected more smoke, it's a good effort overall.  Soothing, warming, and satisfying."
"Deep amber in color, the head is light beige, the lace in thin sheets. Nose is malt, light hints of caramel, bit of smoke. Front is sweet, the top light, the finish once again has a touch of smoke, acidic, dry, fairly well hopped and a decent drinking beer. Ranks #657 on my current 1000 beer master list."
"Slightly hazy, dark red-amber body.  Thick, rocky, cream-colored head.  Very smoky aroma with slight undertones of sweet malt.  I really can't taste anything beyond the smoke. Smooth beer, just too heavy on the smoke to be truly enjoyable.  Probably great with a turkey sandwich."
"I raised the scores in most categories after drinking a 22 oz version of the Smoke Ale. It's very drinkable for a Smoked beer. The smoke quality is subtle, but nice. Great malt underlying and I don't get the huge viscosity that I got from the 7 ozer."
"Notes: A step above the rest and an absolute delight to savour. Just a small warning ... the 7 oz bottle is not enough especially if you are a smoked ale lover."
"Ok, maybe I'm drinking this too young, it is made here in Oregon. I just can not drink this stuff. It tastes like liking an ashtray. I like Achet rauch beer but I just can't hadle this. Maybe if I aged it out for 6 month to a year. I like most of Rogues stuff but not this."
