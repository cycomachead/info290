review_text
"Upon opening, a steam-like, tan haze swirled around inside and just escaping the mouth of the bottle. I expected it to begin foaming, champagne-like, which it did, but not immediately as I had expected, catching me off-guard. The foam was wonderfully effervescent, somewhere between brown and tan, and created a huge head with a frothy top. Happily, the foam died down before I became impatient to drink the beer. A distinct, butterscotch, chocolate and smoke smell wafted up in a fairly full manner, though not quite as much as I would have liked. The butterscotch and mostly chocolate taste was definitely pleasant, too, but also a little bit less than I had hoped for; however, the mixed-in smoky flavor was fantastic. I have had only a few smoky beers, and in all the smoke taste seemed separated from the rest of the taste and kind of industrial or cigarettey. This smoke was clean, like that of a hardwood fire, and subdued but not faint like what would emanate from a hearty fire in the hearth of a well ventilated chimney. A slight flavor of the fire's wood was mixed in with the smoke. Along the way, there were periodic, faint hints of subdued lambic fruitiness, perhaps from the juniper berries, though not discernibly juniper-like. Too bad. The field was a bit or watery than I had expected, based on the richness of the head. Also, though the beer poured a kind of orangey-brown with lots of bubbles, the  effervescence wasn't really discernible. I suppose the bubbles were just too small, so it made a neat appearance, but didn't add to the experience in the mouth. Overall, this was a more than pleasant beer, with a superlative smokiness to it."

"Tastes as it smells with addition of sweetness."

"Pours a cloudy, brown color.  2/3 inch head of an off-white color.  Great retention and decent lacing.  Smells of roasted malt, sweet malt, slight hops, smoke, hint of coffee, hint of chocolate, and a hint of yeast.  Fits the style of a Smoked Beer.  Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with a high carbonation level.  Tastes of strong smoke, roasted malt, slight sweet malt, slight hop, and slight chocolate.  Overall, decent appearance, good aroma and body, but the high carbonation level is unappealing."

"Copper. Some smoke on the nose but it is not super potent.  Smokiness in the flavor profile as well. Aside from the smoke, the rest of the flavor is pretty unremarkable."

"Food match: The sesame oil smoke in this brew made me long for fried egg noodles in sesame sauce."
""
"Had this on tap at Amundsen Brewery in Olso. Pours amber, no discernible head or lacing. A nice drinkable smoky beer. A lot of effervescence but with tiny bubbles. Leaves a buzz in your mouth like a well made Gewurtztraminer. Taste is smoky of course but the malts really come through. Fun beer."

"O: for smoke beer lovers, this is actually a real treat... out of the bottle, it doesn't look as pretty or drink as clean and muscular as it does on draft... I'd suggest really taking care to not pour out too much lees"

"Bottle. Brown pour with fluffy brown head. Aroma is smoked wood and intense sesame oil. Taste is nutty and smoked malt and wood Lively carbonation. Body is slightly richer than most traditional smoked. Also, it is not a meaty smoked, it leans more toward campfire and nuts. Decent smoked but not on par with the traditional version such as Schlenkerla's. 3.5"
""
"Bottle shared. Pours a creamy looking brown with thick creamy tan head that lasted really well. Sticky lacing and thick legs. Creamy mouthfeel from medium carbonation and rich body. Aroma is light smoke, caramel malt sweetness, and some faint earhty/floral hop. Taste was fantastic! Rich caramel, smoke permeates through everything, but well balanced. Really glad I got to try this one."

"O: the character that was so strong when I first opened and tasted the beer soon faded. Still it's a very appealing beer well-balanced beer but not as amazing as I originally thought it would be. I"

"Pours a murky dark orange with a foamy bone head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, smoke, and wood aromas. Taste is much the same with smoke and char flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of smoke bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is very smoke forward but doesn't show any juniper from what I can sense."

"Overall - A unique smoked beer by HaandBryggeriet. I really like the level of smokiness - reminds me of nights by the campfire. Very well executed."

"500ml bottle served in an SA Perfect Pint. Batch 432 printed on the label. Pours a translucent amber with a fizzy, 1.5 inch, butter-colored head that sizzles and pops as it slowly recedes into a creamy, 1/8th inch cap. Nose is difficult to describe - herbal and spicy, some citric acid and just the merest suggestion of smoke towards the back. Taste expresses smoked malt, but it doesn't come across as being overly meaty. There's also an acidic presence (must be the juniper berries), as well as a slight medicinal character towards the finish. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a prickly carbonation, a slightly oily texture and an astringency that stimulates the salivary glands along the sides of the cheeks. Overall, I find myself pleasantly surprised at how much I like this beer, despite Smoked Beers not really being a style favorite. Definitely a good way to accustom the palate to the style without being assaulted by smoked meat."
""
"Bottle: Poured a dark amber color ale with a large dirty white foamy head with good retention and some light lacing notes. Aroma consists of smoked malt with some light tart fruit notes. Taste is a complex mix between some tart fruit notes with some smoked malt with light dry caramel malt notes. Body is about average with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Well put together and quite original."

"O: The chocolate in this beer is keeping me excited for each sip; it’s a taste I haven’t found anywhere else. And beneath all that, it shows nice play between bright herbs and bitter smoke. Just goes to show the skill at which Haandbryggeriet operates: every beer I’ve had from them has been complex and satisfying."
""
"Despite being sampled about 19 months after the ""best bef."" date, this beer brought out a nice combo of smoke flavor with a gentle malt sweetness. I didn't catch any of the juniper berry component of this beer. This beer would be a perfect introduction to someone who is curious about smoked beers but my be a bit leery about being overwhelmed with some of this style's bolder examples. I was a bit surprised that such a relatively light body still packed such a wonderful flavor. Not too big...not too little...A fine beer..."

"Overall: This ale reminded me of Yazoo's Sue smoked porter as well as the German rauchbiers. A slow sipper due to the intense taste, but a well-constructed beer I'm glad to have tried."
"O-After the overwhelming smoke subsided, I noticed some more fruit flavors and I started to enjoy it. My palate was probably blown out by the end, but I managed to finish most of the 500 ml bottle."
"Reddish brown with a cream coloured cap. Good retention and a bit of lace. Nose has some smoked wood, caramel, toasted bread and some mild darker fruit notes that could be coming from the berries. Some earth as well. Taste has some heavily charred wood/bread, caramel and some herbal, fruity notes. Drying, with charcoal and burnt matches in the aftertaste. Medium body and a relatively low carb. An OK smoked beer, but doesn't really stand out for me as it's a bit harsher in some regards than I appreciate within the style."

"[I'm not a native English speaker but I hope you'll understand my review.]"
"Decent but kinda harsh in terms of drinkability."
"even if 6.5% isn't strong, the beer is a mouthful. it's fun to evaluate what fun smoke it, other than just contributing awesome. it's spicy and earthy"
"T: A complex evolution of flavor notes displays barbecue smoke, and dark chocolate. Smooth carbonation aids in presenting the flavors."
"500ml bottle. ½ Pint glass. Enjoyed on apr´12.Inviting pours orangish red in color. Yellowish froth creates a thick layer crown. Involving smokiness both in flavor & aromas. Juniper touch to the nose. Mildy maltiness & low bitterness. Slightly spicy palate, smooth sensation. Notes of resins & wood linger in to the aftertaste. Flavorful, well balanced, smart beer. A delightful beer suggested as session beer in cold weather despite its ABV. I´d really enjoyed it very much."
"Pretty unique beer here. I found it more similar to a style akin to a Sahti than a smoked beer....this may be attributed to its age but like I said earlier, still enjoyable."

"this one has been elusive to me other then at a beer fest but I wasn't taking notes, pretty glad I was finally able to grab a bottle its good stuff"
"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a dark red brown amber. Two finger medium off-white head that dissipates relatively quickly, leaving nice lacing. Aroma is intense smoke and peat with an almost metallic element, probably from the peat. Taste is neutral malt, smoke, light peat and understated dark and light fruit. The finish is dry and smokey, but mellow. Medium bodied. Well done. Not quite as sweet as some of my favorite smoked beers, but I like the flavor progression and taste of this. The peat in the finish is a little bit of an off flavor for me, but overall this all works."

"This brew poured out as a nice looking dark brown color with a tan colored head on top. the head settles quickly and doesn't leave much on the glass at all. The smell of the beer is smoked for sure, plenty of burnt smokey aromas in this one. The malts are in there too which is nice. The taste of the beer was pretty good, the beer didn't taste salty like most smoked beers seem too to me. THe juniper was a little difficult for me to get from the taste here. The mouthfeel was pretty good, medium bodied with a creamy feel to it. Overall not a bad Smoked beer, worth trying."

"Very nice brew all up. I love the smoke character blending so well with the malted grains—it really works the character into the beer to give a suggestion of how this would have been done in the past."
"Damn nice in the mouth. Much more smoke, tannic on the finish. Juniper, dark rustic breads, burnt raisins, milk chocolate, earth, pine, with a perfume like flavor deep into the long long finish."

"An interesting brew but not good enough for me to go back at the 10 dollar price tag this fetches around here."

"Overall a really nice beer with a good story of the history behind the style."
"O: Despite this beer being consumed nearly two years after the brewer's recommendations, it held up fairly well. I'm interested in updating this review with notes from a fresh bottle."

"O - gentle rauch; very good; quite enjoyable"

"I poured from a bottle into a SA perfect pint glass, light amber pour with a medium white head, no lacing. The aroma is light smoke, wood. The obvious flavor is smoke, hints of oak, salt, finishes smokey. The body is medium, good carbonation. A solid smoked beer, could not taste any juniper, never a good thing not to be able to taste a listed ingredient."
"Overall. Nice tasting beer. The smoke isn't overdone and the juniper berries are a nice addition. Good stuff."
"Edit: After reading the description, I think the odd aroma I couldn't hit was juniper."
"Speaking of smoked meats... that is exactly the flavor that my palate pulls from this beer. Like the best carbonated beef jerkey you ever tasted. I absolutely love it. The hickory smoke flavor is evident immediately and lingers in the mouth. The berries give both a sweetness that comes in the middle and a very subtle tartness on the backend that is balanced throughout by the smoke. Light bodied, not heavy at all. I could drink this all day. The taste lingers just long enough to not be offensive. Very nice beer. Again, this is by far my favorite smoked beer."
"Dropping the strained literary comparison, in short, I liked this beer very much, and found it to be greater than the sum of its parts. The smoke really works with the oxidation, and there's enough malty goodness in here from the Munich and crystal malt to deliver a very satisfying overall flavor. A nice surprise."
"O - Fantastic. I love smoke beers and this is already becoming one of my favorites. Not over the top good balance, good beer."
"The smoke gets you first but once the beer opens up the other flavours meld together with the smoke to create a very nice smoked ale. Porter like notes on the finish and the beer tastes quite like Stone's smoked porter at times. The juniper berries are only a sideline to the main smoky profile but the beer has a pleasant balance that shows up after awhile. I have enjoyed everything from this brewer and this is no exception"
"Pours a rather ugly cloudy dark orange/brown. An attractive tan head tops the brew. Plenty of wood in the nose with cherries, apples and smoke supporting. First sip is all smoke, wood, sweet malts, and ripe fruits – that actually are juniper berries. Great balance as this puppy is not overly smoked. A pretty unique beer from a great brewer. I wish Norway’s politics were as good as her beer."
"O - interesting in that it has the tart fruity characteristics of a belgian and/or juniper berry flavoured pale ale, but with a mild yet rich smoke to it, the juxtaposition generally works but not a brew where I'm looking to crack a second, well worth a try though for the uniqueness alone"
"O: I've never had much luck with Norwegian beers or smoked beers, so I had doubts, but this was pretty good."
"D: An interesting beer, for sure. It doesn't, in my opinion, transcend the best smoked beers and the best dark fruity beers to become greater than the sum of its parts, but it's a valiant effort. Worth a try and a beer that I certainly would not object against drinking again."
"O- I was a little unsure about how I'd perceive this brew at first but the more I drink it, the more I really am enjoying it. It's unique, has some balancing spice/malt/smokiness that really blend well together in this recipe. It's definitely not a brew that I could drink many of in a sitting, but it's refreshing and makes for a very enjoyable pint!"
"Mouthfeel is extremely smooth and low carbonation. Overall I cannot imagine this being hard to drink for anybody. Its refreshing which most smoked beers are probably not in this category and extremely enjoyable."
"Very good smoked beer...too bad I'd have to take out a 2nd mortgage to drink Haandbryggeriet's product on a regular basis."
"It tastes very nicely and ballanced of amber malts, hops, smoke and juniper, and it just feels great, full and creamy body with moderately low carbonation, just the way i like it. Not a beer to drink lots of in one go, but could definetly drink this one pretty often!"
"The feel is surprisingly creamy. It comes through with a medium texture and a good feel overall. A sipper, as it is so rich, this is a gnarly beer. Not a beer I would return to, just given my own personal tastes, but a great one to try."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation being above average. Overall it was a pretty drinkable and flavorful beer, but the juniper just really isn't my thing. It felt a little too sweet and herbal to me, but I really did like the smoked malt in it."
"Quite a challenging, and yet still well-made smoked ale - the relatively laid-back nature is refreshing, to a point, and this would likely be a perfect pairing for any kind of food that has itself seen fire, particularly in any sort of grungy campsite."
"Nice, mild smoked beer. Not very overpowering; nicely blended and enjoyable."
"O: Definitely a beer that I'm pissed I didn't buy another bottle of. This works perfectly between smoked malts and sweet malts, a touch of herbal flavors, and just a hint of bitterness. Very enjoyable beer on a cold rainy spring day. Spot on."
"O - Overall, a pleasant experience, though nothing mindblowing. Simply put, a tasty ale that has the potential to be outstanding, but comes across as just above average."
"Overall a solid brew, interesting to try."
"A wonderfully flavorful and balanced smoked beer. Although I probably wouldn't drink this all night, I certainly wouldn't turn down a refill."
"D: Norwegian Woods rates well in Appearance, Smell and Mouthfeel, but it simply does not deliver on taste, so drinkability suffers. I do not think I need to revisit this beer. "
"Here is an engaging beer...historic, interesting, and exciting. It's a deep brown color, quite clear, with a fizzy white head (moderately stable). The aroma has a smoke and wood scent, along with a spice and malt quality. Firm bitterness in the flavor. The beer has lots of woody, tannic astringency. It's a beer with a considerable bitterness, although not a hop bitterness...perhaps contributed by the juniper twigs? Slightly smoky, although not as much as I expected. Nice body. Not a great beer, and certainly not my style, but very interesting."
"A year and a half past it's ""best before"" date the beer still has nice character and flavors. However, based on this tasting it shows that this one can take the aging but likely not improve. Would try again fresher."
"D - This is a pretty good smoked ale. Not over the top with smokiness. It had just enough."
"Note: Batch 232, Brewed 6/26/2009"
"Real drinkable, even if you are new to the style. Nice balance and not cloying. Very good brew."
"A nice smoked beer with enough smoke to be present and some good yeasty notes."
"The appearance is a cloudy mostly brown with shades of red and a tanish half finger of foam on the surface. The smell is rather nice considering that this beer is technically supposed to be past it's prime (March 2010). The smells are mostly a nice roast with a deep chocolate aroma and slight trails of smoked malts. The flavor is pretty damn good, it starts out with a malty sweetness and finished with a decent amount of peat smoke on the tongue. The first sip was much better than the following ones, resulting in the ratings that are seen before you. The mouthfeel was on the watery side IMO due to the flavors on hand. The beer is rather drinkable and I must admit I really enjoy this beer."
"Pours a nice deep red with a good head and good lace. The aroma is earthy and smoky with a mild funkiness and some smoked meat. There is some wood and fruitiness and a mild sweet aroma in there as well. The flavor follows but it's nicely bitter compared to other smoky beers I've had. There is some sweet smoke and plenty of woodiness and a fair bit of earthiness in there as well. Delicious."
"It could be that I'm drinking this a week before Christmas, but this really has a warm, holiday feel to it. The smoky aspects are distinct, but they don't overwhelm, and the layers of flavor and spice are reminiscent of a winter warmer, although not quite as dense and bogged down. Good stuff, my first from HaandBryggeriet."
"D: Solid beer, the smoke was not as upfront as I thought'd be, very tasty."
"Verdict: Not quite worth the hefty price tag, but if you see it you should try it for its unique qualities."
"Body is a little thin but the somewhat low carbonation seems appropriate somehow. Another solid, interesting, and enjoyable Scandinavian beer. Just wish the prices were as easy to swallow as the delicious beer is."
"Drinkability: My first smoked beer and I'm very intrigued by the style. This is a sipper to experience the nuances of the style. Good!"
"D- Certainly not a bad drink. But one pint is all I could do in a single sitting. Great beer to share if you can find another smoked beer lover."
"Pours a dark reddish brown with a medium creamy tan head. Smell is sour cherries, and a hint of alcohol. Taste is oatmeal up front, with a hint of tobacco smoke in the middle, and a leathery, earthy finish. Mouthfeel is smooth, slightly high carbonation. Good drinkability. An interesting beer with a unique taste that I would get again."
"Enjoyable! Hell yes to the Norwegians for this wonderful smoked beer. I really liked all its balanced parts. Everything fits very well together with nothing to over the top with a very fresh, wholesome, craft, and subtleness that I found to me very much to my liking for a smoked beer."
"Overall, nothing I enjoyed too much. Not very drinkable and I am starting to like smoked beers more. This one just didn't work for me. It might be hard to finish this one."
"DB- Good stuff, becomes fruity at the end. Many nice flavors that balance fairly well. I think I would prefer less fruit but it is still a good beer."
"D: A tasty brew. I recommend sharing the bottle, as it's better in small quantities."
"D: Very balanced for a smoked beer, the flavor never becomes overwhelming."
"Drinkability: I like the mix of of the smoke and sweet florals. I wish the malt here was a tad less pale and the florals were a bit more present. This is an interesting beer, worth picking up. Not sure if I would get this again, but certainly worth the try."
"Notes - Try this beer. Its smokey, old fashioned and uniquely brewed. Definately a potent taste burst, just have it in smaller doses."
"This is a nice beer. I wish it were more assertive, though. This beer would work best when paired with food."
"Thanks again Mikeyv35!"
"This is a really interesting beer, with a modest nose and a powerful taste. Adding the wild growing herbs to the mix absolutely adds a sting to the whole mix. Norwegian Wood never tasted as good as this."
"It took me a while, but I finally got a second chance at this beer. It pours a translucent tawny amber (more toward the brown end of the spectrum) topped by over a finger-and-a-half- of cream-colored foam. The smell comprises smoked ham, roasted malts, light toffee, and wheat, though smokey notes dominate. The taste holds notes of everything listed above, though the smoke is toned down slightly, the toffee is joined bvy a light caramel, and the wheat is toasted. The body is a solid medium, with a lightly moderate carbonation and a slightly watery, smooth feel. Overall, a very nice smoked beer, one that I wish was easier to obtain on a regular basis."
"Drinkability is outstanding. A pleasure to savor the flavors as I drink, imagining this beer being brewed on a Norwegian farm using traditional process. Kudos to HaandBryggeriet for a winning recreation of this traditional Norwegian style."
"I found this to be somewhat lighter in terms of mouthfeel. I dare say it was somewhere along the watery lines which was interesting because it certainly did not taste that way. All in all a very strange consistency. Very sessionable. So much so that I had to remind myself of the price tag. I would definitely try again."
"Color is a light milk chocolate brown with a fairly thin dirty white head. Beer had fairly consistant carbonation. Aroma was heavily smoked, with a bit of grain. Flavor was fairly smooth; dominated by a thorough smoke, but not overpowering. Had a substantial maltiness and chewiness I had not encountered in a lot of smoked beers."
"D: Solid drinkability. The smoky malt adds nice highlights without being overbearing with a good tongue coating appeal. Overall good all the way around."
"The beer pours a hazy dark brown color with a tan head. The aroma is meaty smoke with some charred wood, ash and burnt malt. The flavor is smoke, roasted malt, chocolate, juniper and dark fruit. The aftertaste is extremely smoky. Thin-medium and slightly watery mouthfeel. Low-medium carbonation."
"D-Well, it is not a secret that I am a smoked beer lover and this one surely is a well done smoked beer. Quite tasty with plenty of flavour and an accompanying, underlying bitterness that accents the smoked malt nicely."
"Drinkability: Goes down easy as its fairly well balanced."
"D: OK. Drinking it alone right now it's a tad bit too smoky; it'd probably be a better brew with some sort of grilled food, e.g., a burger, sausage, pork. . . ."
"Comes out of the tap a barely transparent mahogany-honey brown with a cream-white, fine-bubbled head. Rich, malty, smoked-wood aroma has an undertone of barbecue. Smoky, barbecue-like flavor is malty wit hints of spice, caramel and even sweetness. Tingly, lively texture rounds out a very tasty and distinctive beer."
"Beer is medium bodied with some sweetness up front. Tastes really good. The smoke is subtle and comes up late and lingers with this bitterness from roasted malt in the back. Its like a smokey porter or something like that. Almost like a strong brown porter. Pretty good beer."
"An ""interesting"" brew. On sweet side, but with balance. Notably, though not overwhelmingly, smokey. Sounded like it would be like a smoked sahti, but juniper comes across differently here. A unique brew - don't know that I would have it again for the hefty over $10 for the 500 ml bottle, but was interesting/creative."
"Overall this smoked beer ranks right up there with the best from Schlenkerla and the juniper adds just a hint of earthiness that's well served here. If you're a fan of smoked beers then this one is well worth a shot."
"Interesting label note: at one time in Norway, every farm was required to brew its own ale. Not sure if they were required to drink it though!"
"Good drinkability. I really like these smoke ales, and this is another one that didn't disappoint."
"On Tap at Max's."
"Very filling and creamy. Tasty and satisfying, but not built for drinking in large quantities."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, it's a foamer, 1"" clear red brew, 4 1/2"" beige froth. Head is down an inch in a little bit, with random large chunks of lace here and there. Aroma is smoky and effervescent. Taste is somewhat muddled at the front, sweet and spices battling it out. Smoke comes on in the middle, then a quick peek of chocolate at the close. Mouthfeel is maybe a bit too prickly, and drinkability is alright. Doesn't come together very well, but is an interesting brew for sure."
"Drinkability - interesting. Kudos to the hand-smoking efforts here. I'd have it again."
"Lively out of the bottle, lost a tiny bit when opening. Pours a lovely dark chestnut colour with a medium sized creamy tan head, and an abundance of carbonation. The nose is heavily malty with clear notes of chocolate, caramel and some brown sugars. There is also a smokey, peatlike aroma coming through the sweetness. The flavours are noticeably accented by the smokiness from the wood, with dark chocolate, a bitter peatiness, and some subtle sweet fruits from the berries. The mouthfeel is quite light, and the texture has a rough quality to it. Really interesting beer, thoroughly enjoyed it. It's different and well worth finding."
"Overall, I found this beer to be a little boring and one-dimensional. Worth a try if you like smoked beers. ~"
"Not the most drinkable style for my taste, and it will take me a while to get through this, thanks to the complexities and substantial body. But I certainly recommend this to fans of smoked beers, this is much more interesting than a run of the mill smoked porter. Im glad i picked this one up, and may again someday..."
"D: Certainly an interesting beer and one to at least try once. A very pleasant, well-balanced, and easily drinkable smoke beer. Good sessionability. I was anticipating this to be more complex than it ended up being."
"Mouthfeel - Medium mouthfeel, with a nice hoppy finish to balance out the smoke."
"The addition of juniper twigs and berries is rather subtle, which is probably a good thing as one can get carried away with junipers. Regardless, this beer is not for non-smoke ale lovers. This is all that and a bag of smoldering embers. That said, this is a ""split a bottle with a friend"" beer as it's rather hard to finish an entire one, and we're smoked beer lovers."
"this one finished with a med body and a good lingering smoke flavor on the pallet. a really nice smoke beer that is very drinkable."
"This is a mild smoked beer that I actually enjoyed. Maybe it's time for me to try the more difficult ones again..."
"$7.99 for a1pt .9fl oz bottle. 6.5% ABV. Pours out to a hazy very dark brown, forming a modest dark tan head with poor retention and absent lacing. Lots of dark sediment at the bottom of the bottle. Nice little yeasty beasties. The aroma is nice and rich with smoke and caramel, maybe a little sour milk with swirling. Mouthfeel is bright with a medium dense body. The taste opens up with plenty of smoke. I like my smoked beers smoky, and this is very smoky. I love it. It has a big malt body in the middle, followed by a little earthiness. The juniper doesn't stand out and the bitterness is mild, so it leaves plenty of lingering malt in the aftertaste. A hearty brew. I really enjoyed this, but I'm not convinced it's worth the $8 price."
"Bottle shared with Michael, Michael and Darrell at Pizzeria Paradiso. Chestnut colored without much head or lacing. Aroma reminiscent of the leather straps that old fashioned barber chairs used to have. Taste has some dark fruit and cherries, progressing to beef jerky then finishing with barbecued bacon. Nicely complex."
"Overall - An excellent and quite complex smoked beer... well worth a try.."
"No smoke beer lover should not try this if they can."
"An okay smoked beer, but after this one I would rather to back to a more traditional Rauchbier."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and crisp. Solid spritzy carbonation. Goes down easy. Overall, I found this to be an interesting, tasty brew that I would have again!"
"First off, I love smoked beers, especially those like the Aecht Schlerenka variety where the smoke is strong. Pours dark brown with nice red edges. Thick head that last the whole way down. Not much lacing. Beautiful campfire aroma. Great mix of wood with the juniper showing through. Oily mouthfeel with enough carbonation to smooth it out. Long, earthy finish. The taste is spectacular. Wood, smoke, and bacon. The malt is rich and hearty, but maintains a pleasant dry quality. Good mix with the chocolate malt gives a bit of sweetness, but not too much to overtake the smokiness. I love this beer. If you're going to go smoked, go the whole way."
"drinkability is good. the flavors are well proportioned and the smoke compliments the malts quite well. a tasty smoked beer that drinks very nicely. cheers!"
"An interesting mix of smoke and juniper. Norwegian Wood pours a reddish mahogany color with an excellent head. The aroma is strongly smoky with a light alcohol note. The juniper doesn't really come through until you get to the flavor. Altogether, it's an interesting mix of spruce, smokehouse meats, sweet malt and spice. As it warms up, there's a light phenolic note. The smoke doesn't dominate the flavor profile as it does in the aroma. It sits well on the palate, fairly light carbonation, smooth feel. I'm not sure how much smoked beer I can ever stomach in one sitting, but it's certainly enjoyable by the half liter."
"M + D: A nice prickle of carbonation right off the top, introducing a bigger sized body. Heavy side of medium, I suppose would be the most accurate I can come up with using a limited 'descriptive phrase bank.' The amount of alcohol is quite low, though. Admittedly, I expected it to be considerably higher... 8 or even 9%, but no complaints. There is a lot to be said for a beer that is able to be on the lower alcohol side with this kind of flavour."
"This beer pours a thick toffee color with an off white one finger head that recedes quickly. Not much lacing to speak of. Nose is of caramel malts, dark fruits and berries, and a hint of smokiness. Taste is berries and dark fruit at the forefront, caramel malts fill out the middle, and a hop finish. Throughout the whole beer a nice balance of smokiness plays against the tastes. Medium body, moderate carbonation, somewhat oily at first and fills out to a nice creaminess. This is a nice beer to sit with for a little bit."
"Not as interesting a beer as I had hoped, but it's still quite drinkable."
"D - The smoke is powerful, and does make it hard to get through."
"A unique, mouth-watering concoction that would pair well with properly prepared salt-cod, rakfisk, wild game, and wild greens."
"D - One of the meatiest beers I've ever had for sure. Isn't it good, Norwegian Wood? Yes it is."
"The taste has some sweet malt, with a hint of molasses or brown sugar and of course plenty of smoke. The smoke is not overpowering and honestly is very, very well balanced for a smoked beer. Although I've had better smoked beers, I haven't had many that had such a good balance of medium body and non-overpowering smoke flavor that I would be able, and want, to drink more than one."
"This would age well. May buy a few to lay down and try this winter and next spring."
"I drank this at room temp, but I think it could have used some fridge time. Very interesting beer, though!"
"The beer pours a dark brown color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a decent malt scent of roasted, crystal, and peated malts. The smoke aroma is mild with a nice roasted dryness. The taste is good as well. It has a very smooth, peated flavor that's balanced with crystal and roasted malts. There is a slight Juniper berry taste up front, but it fades quickly with the smoke overcoming it. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a tastey beer. I've been wanting to try it for awhile."
"D: Good drinkability with a complex flavor and interesting finish."
"This one would be easier to understand and appreciate under the category of a smoked beer."
"D: While drinking this beer is an unusual experience, it is definitely drinkable. Certainly NOT for everyone."
"this brew pours up an opaque reddish brown color with dark peach edges and a nice off white head. the nose is smoked bacon, smoked ham, smoked pork, burnt wood. the taste is a lol rough on the edges, I get very smoky pig products, subtle malts, slight hop bittering, no juniper twigs though, medium body, high smooth carbo. A decent smoked brew"
"Dark brown body with hints of ruby under a fluffy light tan head. The nose has smoke, but not much and a powdered chocolate smell and a little bit of vanilla. There is a nice spiciness at first then some chocolate with a hint of caramel sweetness. All of the flavors really blend together well, spicy then bitter then sweet with a little spiciness left behind. It has a nice tight carbonation that makes the flavors open up a bit more. It is like a Palo Santo light, and that is a good thing."
"This was an interesting beer, but have no plans to ever purchase it again."
"This is just an OK beer. Could be much better with not so much burnt wood."
"Drinkability: As much as I enjoyed the flavor and aroma, the mouthfeel is a major detraction from drinkability"
"Very dense head, surface looks like rolling hills of off-white, little lacing and while it starts off over three fingers deep, steadily evaporates downwards. Very dark red-brown color, only if you hold the glass close to a light does the transparency become evident. In the nose it's easy to finger all the smokiness but it's not a one trick pony, behind this lays medicinal witch hazel, cocoa powder fried in butter, campfire ashes, peat moss, cinnamon stick and a touch of caramel and toffee for shock absorption, very light squeak of mixed black fruit scents. Medium-bodied, if you could turn your mouth into a fire burning oven, this is what it would taste like. A metallic cave water, tar and Lapsang Souchong tea leaves keeps it aggressive. The carbonation acts like a thin jet stream through the palate, not steadily stirring the pot but creating turbulence. Piney juniper berry influence. Otherwise, the fruit element is very low, likewise no citrus of note. Anise seed and dried strips of game, less chocolate or caramel. Clean finish with expected big inner mouth perfume. A very good curiosity, couldn't drink more than two in a sitting."
"D: I'll certainly have again. The berries and smoke play well together"
"Solid complex beer."
"Drinkability is really rather high for a smoked beer - I could have drank more than one of these, and the sweetness in this coupled with the smoke would make this an absolute grand slam with pulled pork barbecue."
"Unique, drinkable and worth trying. For sure one of the best of this style I've had."
"It's worth a taste."
"Overall: I received this beer as a Christmas present. It's the first beer of this style I've had and I'm enjoying it. I've got another Scandinavian beer to try later. Word."
"beer"
"My natural inclination would be the pair this with smoked pork since that is basically what it tastes like. I would be a bit concerned that pairing smoked beer with smoked meat would be too much, and I might opt for grilled pork loin instead."
"I like it, but probably won't return for another."
"D - A slightly different take on a smoked beer that may be very appealing if you like that kind of thing. If smoked beers aren't your thing, this still might be worth trying as an entry to the flavor, but it would be best to share the larger sized bottle. Alcohol is not much of a factor."
"Pours a dark brown with a foamy beige head. Aroma dominated by smokey malts and wood. Also contains hints of fig and dark fruits. Flavor again is domnated by smoky/ woody maltiness that is nicely balanced with fig, spice and dark fruit. Very complex and tasty!"
"3.8/5"
"Pours with a five+ finger, thick light tan head that fades slowly and leaving traces of lace. Cloudy deep amber color, yeast left in bottom of bottle. Good carbonation, medium bodied. Smoky, caramel nose. Flavor is sweet, woody and smoky with some caramel. Pricey at $11.50 for a 500ml bottle from Tully's Beer and Wine Wells, Me."
"Very interesting and tasty beer. I'll definitely have to try more from this brewery (assuming I can find more)."
"I have had a few Haand beers and came away impressed and have wanted to try this for awhile.Poured into a 22oz nonic a slight hazed russett brown with a huge blooming light tan head that went over the side even with a gentle pour,aromas were of hard wood smoke,juniper,and cherry,almost like burning cherrywood.Smooth mothfeel, it glides down easy.Flavors as expected have some real smoke attributes along with almost a phenolic-like clove spice to it,there is a sweet fruit element as well.A nice drinkin brew,I like smokey beers and this has the smoke and a little more to offer,quite good."
"Overall a very unique beer!"
"The flavor is pretty smoky too with lots of different notes of bitter berries, prety malty too. And there are some nice hoppiness to that balances all of it."
"Drinkability: This is a dangerously drinkable and delicious beer. I will have to keep my eye on this brewery because this one hits it out of the park."
"A very enjoyable beer for the winter and fall, but not exactly a hot summer BBQ beer."
"This is a great ski lodge beer. Very woodsy and dry but quite comforting."
"Nicely drinkable with pleasant taste and feel. Not outstanding in any particular dimension, but a solid brew. Smoke is mild and adds to the character."
"Pours a cloudy dark brown color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger creamy off-white head, which leaves some sticky lacing behind. The nose is malty, with some yeast, with some grassy notes and corinander. The taste is malty, sweet, yeasty/grassy, with some smoky notes, nice touch of corinander. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a tasty brew, recommended."
"Overall: A very interesting and unique brew... I can almost invision a farmhouse and burning fire as I drink it. I don't know much about Norway, but this beer is very telling about its beer culture. One of a kind, at least as far as I have experienced."
"The aroma is a mixture of smokiness and mild tart/sweetness...and maybe a bit of phenolic (weizen?) peculiarity as well. The flavor seems to hit the tongue with smokiness first, followed by some fruity/tart flavor...maybe that's the juniper? The smokiness reminds me quite a bit of the best Bamberg brews, but the rauch character isn't as omnipresent as the Schlenkerla brews, possibly not as much as the Spezial brews either. There's a bit of tartness in the flavor which I've had in some other smoked brews. I'm not sure if it's a result of the smoked malt or possibly the yeast, but whatever it is...I like it. Whatever the case, I think this brew is catered more toward those who like a somewhat heavy smoke flavor in their beer. If that sounds like ""you", then give this one a try!"
"Pours a hazy deep dark orange amber color with a big foamy light tan head that resists fading. A good amount of sheeting Belgian lace left behind. The smell is really unique. Smokey, earthy, funky, and yeast with a tartness. The mouth feel is light-medium bodied, alive with a bright tingle of tart effervescence. The earthy roasted smokey taste with a little chalky NECCO wafer chocolate thing going on. I'm finding more and more to consider about this one. Definitely having a gas with it. I'm getting a little chest warmer with the 6.5% ABV...don't understand that. Hey, take one for a spin."
"there is a nice swettness that is pretty mild. the smokiness doesn't really come into effect until the aftertaste, then it seems pretty strong, but nice. i don't really taste any of the juniper berries either. the carbonation was out of control on this one, could definitely be toned down a bit."
"Great drinkability."
"Definitely worth a try..."
"D : Great beer. Definitely one I would love to drink again."
"Overall, an interesting and fun beer. It tastes interesting, but doesn't quite align with my tastes."
"Bottle pours a cloudy copper body with a fluffy beige head that subsides into spiderweb lacing. Lovely aroma has notes of caramel, funky juniper berry, and subtle campfire smokiness. Medium body and carbonation. Taste is complex and quite interesting. Smoke is more evident in the taste than the aroma, lending an outdoor smokiness. Assertive bitterness seems to derive from the hops profile. Caramel malt sweetness is easily apparent though understated. The juniper berries add an odd earthy herbal character, much like a good gin. Mild roasty notes add to the complexity. A very interesting and worthwhile experience that is also an enjoyable sipper."
"This beer even looks smokey, rust with dark shades of copper and ruby. The head is a light tan right after the pour tahst recedes a on the quick side after a couple of sips. Can't see any bubbles through this thick looking quagmire. When you smell the beer sitting stgnantly, you get the earthy juniper berries with a touch of nuts. But when you swirl the beer, you get a big whiff of smokey malts that have a touch of caramel. This is one unique tasting beer. Herbal berries,very smokey malts giving notes of toasted nuts and mixe with the taste of a campfire. Snokey palate with a touch of dark sweetness. Good sipper."
"Freshness label suggests it will last a while--I'll have to hunt down some more and see how well it ages. But for now...this beer has flown."
"500 ml bottle, Batch NR 86, brewed August 2007, best before August 2009. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours dark brown/ruby red with an inch tan head. Head retention and lacing are both good. The aroma is smoky and spicy, it smells like smoke, wood, spice and a slight fruity aroma that I assume is from the juniper berries. The taste is the same as the aroma, it's smoky, spicy, herbal and a little bit fruity. Aroma and taste are both very nice. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a little bit creamy with some lively carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's smooth and easy to drink. If you like smoky beers, then I think you'll like this one. I'd definitely buy this again."
"D- This beer has a nice balance of smoky dark malts and hops with some nice support from a fragrant yeast strain."
"Overall, an interesting beer; nicely smoked with a kind of weird tart kick to it. Worth a try."
"D: The moderate abv is good for sipping. It's the strong flavor profile that brings you back to this ale though."
"Drinkability: it was a unique smoke beer and I'm glad I tried it but I wouldn't seek it out again."
"Smell has a some well done smokiness in it. Taste is campfire smoke. There is just a hint of spice coming through. I am mostly getting smoke in the taste. Well carbonated and crisp on the mouthfeel. It's not a dominating smoke flavor, it's subtle and compliments well."
"Drinkability is moderate. Fairly low alcohol makes for easy consumption, but the smoke may overwhelm as there is nothing else in this beer to compensate for it."
"Pours with a huge tan head and murky, slightly russet-tinged hard brown body. The aroma is quite interesting: lots of smoke (beech- or alderwood perhaps?), some creamy caramel malt tones, and a light fruitiness with a bit of zing to it. Very cool. On the palate, significant bitterness and smokiness throughout, although both are most pronounced in the finish. Very dark-roast coffee hits the palate midway through. Flitting along behind everything is an understated fruitiness that I would assume is coming from the juniper berries -- it's quite a welcome addition, as it keeps things from being all dark, hard flavors and instead rounds everything out. Mouthfeel is surprisingly light but overcarbonated. What a unique, interesting, and tasty beer. A smoke-lover's dream but with an extra dimension added with the juniper. Wonderful stuff!"
"Pours a hazy chestnut brown color with a huge dense light brown head. Disappated into a 1/4 inch fluffy cap, very nice. The smell is of bready malt, very light smoke, and a kind of rusty metallic spice twang (juniper?). The taste is strong with smoke and burning wet wood, a herbal almost fruity flavor follows and I must assume this is the juniper. These flavors are well supported by a nice nutty malt backbone. The feel is moderate with very prickly carbonation, probably too much carbonation. Finishes with a malty sweetness and some toasted/roasted bitterness. A very nice smokey brew. I am finding myself to be a fan of these types. The carbonation is a bit strong and the flavors would stick out more with softer carbonation. One or two of these is all I could probably drink in a sitting as the smokey flavor might get cloying after a while. Looking forward to drinking this by a fire."
"Overall, a decent smoked beer. I tremendously enjoy rauchbiers and smoked porters, but this guy fell just a bit short. It's quite one dimensonal, and I will esily pass this over for my beloved Schlenkerla Rauchbier Marzen...."
"This beer pours an orangish brown color with an extremely tall and thick head that foamed up to the top of the glass very fast. I had to wait for the foam to go down before I could pour some more to fill the glass. Oddly enough it didn't have as much lacing as I would have expected. The beer had a very nice roasted malty base underneath a very smokey aroma. The taste wasn't as smokey as I would have imagined from the aroma but it was still quite smokey. It had a very deep roasted malt base followed by a very woody and smokey flavor finished with a very roasted barely aftertaste. Very interesting and I really enjoyed it. The mouthfeel was very smooth and warming which made for a very drinkable beer. Definately worth a try if you can find it."
"Walnut brown with hints of red. nice little off white head. Laces well, but quickly. Smells awesome, like hickory chips and gin. Makes it smell like Bacon in Alaska. Flavor is light at first, but quickly becomes a smokey blast, very complex. I can taste the juniper berries under the smoke, but its the smoke itself that carries the beer. Full of woody goodness with a simple pale ale backbone. hops still distinguishable. Medium to light bodied. Highly drinkable if you like the whole smoked beer thing."
"I highly recommend that you try this beer if you can. However, don't splurge for a case unless you are one of the rare folks that know and love Rauchbiers as you may be disappointed."
"I've already used lyrics from 'Norwegian Wood' for another Norwegian beer (Nogne Pale Ale), so I couldn't very well use them here. I will admit, however, that one phrase keeps running through my head as I drink. And that is... 'yes, it is good'."
"A very unique experience and I perhaps lack the palate to adequately describe this beer. Nonetheless this was a highly enjoyable brew. This is better than just good Norwegian Wood."
"The wood and smoke is there in the tasting. That, and the juniper berries linger on in the aftertaste.Smooth drinker, with he smoked malt, leaving the bitterness for the very end. Pours cocoish colour with constant white head. Wood fire oven aroma. Worth a try for smoke fans."
"I have to say that I just didn't care for this. I'm actually learning to like rauchbiers, but this weird variant didn't do it for me. I finished about 3/4 of it and poured out the rest. If you really like smoked beers, this is probably worth a try. If not - avoid this. Everything about this beer is pretty strong, and somewhere I wish there were some more subtle characteristics."
"This was a very nice beer, one I would want to drink again. It was a pretty red/brown color with a thick tan head. The head proved to be very sticky and retained well. I thought the aroma was a little muted. It had a smoky/peaty aroma with a whiff of gin. Taste-wise, the juniper berries were right up front, a litttle sharp, with the smokeiness coming in later. Finally a little bit of hops at the end. Fairly dry beer, but felt good. Ready for more."
"i wish i had another bottle of this to split amongst friends- this is one of those beers that has to be seen to be believed. i'm happy i tried it, i now have new found appreciation for this style of beer, stone's smoked porter now seems a lot more drinkable and i need to make a more concentrated effort to drink more Scandinavian beers; but other than that, well, by default, this is my favorite beer that shares a name with a Beatles song. ha. i could end this review on a positive note. i just lost a buck. to myself. i once had a beer, or should i say, it once had me."
"An interesting idea, but it seems somehow not all that well executed. The flavor is wonderful if you like smoked beers (which I do), but I really wish more of the juniper could have come through. In the end it is a bit one dimension, especially considering I was hoping for a smoked beer with something else going on. Still this is a tasty brew and one that I am certainly enjoying."
"D: Never had this style of beer before so drinkability is a hard decision. I split the bottle and that is fine with me. A sipper I would say though the smoke is not overwhelming nor are the spices. Totally different and worth tracking down if you can."
"Didn't really know what to expect. Great, very smoky aroma, as expected. Huge, light-brown, mostly lasting head. Cloudy, brown color. That's were the good experience ended. This is like nothing else I've every had. It tasted plain awful. i couldn't drink very much of this. Huge dissapointment."
"Pours a very dark clouded brown with a good sized tan head that stays. Nose is smoked, yes. But definitely not overdone by any means. Smells like smoked meat. Flavor is smoked, but not a kick in the mouth, thankfully. You get a lasting smoke that has meat character to it. I dont feel like I get much juniper berries like the label implies. But hey, what do I know. Feel has a pretty full carbonation to it that really takes over the mouth. Liquid is well bodied. Overall a good drink. Not an overpowering smoked beer at all. Still seems a bit one-sided and not extremely complex. And for the price, I feel like I should be getting a whole lot more."
"The mouth is a bit odd though, dry as expected but also too carbonated, leaving the already medium body feeling a bit thin. Later the carbonation backs off, and thickens up a bit. Overall, it was a bit much at first and then later, but through the middle of this beer it was a very enjoyable journey, and would recommend trying it. But paying $8 for this, one and done."
"Prosit, MK"
"Drinkability will be decided here on your like or dislike of strong smoke flavor in a beer. This is a beer that has smoke flavor in spades and if you don't like that you will have a hard time drinking it. I like a smoky beer so I love this."
"I will leave you with this. If you are a fan of smoked and or woody beers I would give this a try. It overwhelms you with these flavors though. Personally I did not think this beer was all that bad. If you give it time it might grow on you too. Dont be too quick to judge with this one let it warm up a bit."
"Drinkability: I love this beer. It's bold and assertive, with sufficient complexity to keep the beer geeks happy."
"D: What an interesting beer. The ABV is just right and everything just seems to fall into place with this one. Excellent!"
"I was impressed with this beer but not overwhelmed; I guess I had never had a Norwegian beer, and certainly not this style. The price was pretty unreasonable, so maybe I'd feel better about it if I bought it myself."
"Drinkability is high, but you'd better be in the mood for a smoked ale. I'm drinking this by itself, but I can only dream of how well it would go with BBQ or smoked salmon."
"This is good and interesting, but not great and legendary. I expected a bolder, more complex character; has its problems along with its positive attributes. Looking forward to their Russian Imperial Stout."
"I must admit that brewing a beer with smoked malt and juniper berries is a quite daring task. Sadly, I think this beer is a little too much for me, making it hard to finish. And that is never a good sign."
"Drinkability: I hope you like your beers smokey!"
"Poured a reddish brown with a light tanned head that was big and tight. Light to medium smoke on the nose balanced nicely by a tang of juniper. The smoke is not overpowering and blends nicely with the fruity aromatic juniper. The taste is very dry and lightly spicy and smokey with an undercurrent of bitterness and a pronounced juniper finish. Once again, the smoke is relatively light and part of a harmonious whole rather than the dominant flavor. The mouthfeel is dry and tannic and medium bodied. The juniper bitterness and aroma really comes through. This unusual beer strikes me as being a good aperitif, similar in utility to something like Cynar. Very interesting, but a tad pricey."
"Poured from the 500ml bottle into a pint glass. Body is somewhere between burnt orange and dark brown, topped by a small khaki-colored head that retains quite well and leaves a bit of lacing on the glass. Aroma of alder-smoked malt, although not as heavy on the smoke as some other smoked beers. Palate is well-rounded, smoky malt forming a nice base but not shutting out all other flavors. A light fruity character from the mellow hops comes through mid-palate, along with a mild malty sweetness. Body is full but not too thick or sticky. Goes down fairly easy for such a strong, uniquely flavored beer. Definitely a curiosity, but in a good way. Try it for yourself."
"I highly recommend this beer."
"Unique, tasty, but I won't spend $8 on another one...I'll leave that to you!"
"Pours a slightly-murky deep red / brown with an inch of tan foam that dissolves slowly. Leaves a finger-wide collar and plenty of lacing. The bottle was cellared upright and poured carefully to avoid too much yeast & sediment in the glass. Smells of dry wood smoke with a medicinal undercurrent from the juniper berries. Quite different from the strong, rounded meaty smokiness that's normally associated with the Franconian (German) smoke beers. The flavor is a surprise as well. Medium-dry wood smoke blends with deeply-toasted malts to create strong dry coffee and leather notes. These are somewhat balanced by cool minty & sour overtones from the juniper berries. Finishes dry with medicinal after-tones, inviting another sip. Body is light-to-medium, very crisp and quite clean for an ale. The juniper berries make this a bit of an acquired taste, but the beer is nicely balanced and worth a try for smoke beer fans."
"Poured from a 1pt .9oz bottle ($7.99 at Whole Foods in Columbus). This looked like a substantial beer, dark red copper and hazy, with a thick 3D-ish tan head. The aroma was dark fruits (maybe juniper berries as described on the bottle) and rauchbier smoke. The flavor is dominated by the smoky malts, and the after-taste held a slightly bittersweet tang. Very tasty and long-lasting flavor, maybe it felt thick and coating due to lots of yeasties in the beer. Outstanding beer, very pricy, my first beer from Norway (to my knowledge)."
"500 ml bottle, bottle conditioned. Brewed with juniper and smoked malts. Dark brown colour, creamy head. The aroma is dominated by smoke (beechwood?) and oak. The flavour is very smokey and woody, with notes of hickory and tar. Dry finish. Smoked beer fans will probably be more excited than I was."
