The label says it's a sour smoked wheat ale, but there really isn't much tart/sourness in this at all. With that being said, it's not a bad tasting brew! Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's slick, smooth and easy to drink. At $6.49 a bottle, I don't think I'd pay that price for this again. But it was nice to try once.","bluejacket74","Sep 06, 2013"

At least it's there. Everything is really mellow and subtle, including the smoky woody malty flavor at the finish, but it's good to have something different for once.

Not a very pretty beer, but it's not an important consideration to me. The aroma is smoke with some spicy, mineral-ish hops. There's a touch of sourness and a kinda stale malt flavor. Very mild. Taste is a bit better. It's mildly tart with some nice background wheat and malt sweetness. Low level of bitterness. Good mix of wheat and hop spiciness with yeast or, maybe, actual spicing. Sort of a grassy, wheaty finish. Some funky, earthy flavors are also in the mix. Mild woody smoke. A little too much sweetness for my palate or I'd go higher with my score. Mouthfeel is a bit full. I'd prefer the beer to be a touch crisper, but the smoke might make that kinda odd. Relatively low carbonation. This was a fun beer to try, but it's just a bit mild, and the malt sweetness doesn't quite seem right. I also wonder if a fresher bottle would have a little more hop kick to it, as the label alludes to hops as a highlight and they don't really come across with much strength.

The nose is very interesting, featuring well balanced interplay between smoke, spicy saaz hops, and a touch of tart, citric lemon. The flavor profile leads off with a bit of a grainy, wheat taste, only for a peppery flourish from the hops to come in next. A light smokiness comes in for the close. Though it's not particularly intense, it does manage to blunt most of the impact of the delicate sourness present (or at least anticpated based on the aroma). The body has a little more heft than I might have anticipated from a 4% beer, and the carbonation just doesn't quite liven the beer up enough. This gratzer's a fairly unique kind of beer, and one that I'm glad I tried. Don't know if I'd actively seek out another one though.","axeman9182","May 20, 2012"

Aroma of light bready malt, wheat and a hint of smoke. Flavor starts with light wheat, lemon and faint smokiness, becomes a little sweeter with light wheat and malt and finishes with somewhat abrupt dry wheat with faint memories of sour wheat and smoke. Very subtly flavored, but interesting flavor progression. Light bodied, but to style for a wheat beer.

2.88,-23,3.5,3,2.5,3.5,3,"It's been a while since I was excited to try a Polish-style beer... This one pours a lightly hazy goldenrod topped by a finger or so of dirty cream foam. The nose comprises lemon-coated must, light wisps of smoke, and toasted wheat. I can't say this is the most appealing smell in the world, but it's not all bad. The taste starts off with a mildly tart lemon flavor, then goes into a lightly smoky haze, then revisits the sourness with some sour, funky wheat. Again, like the smell, things just don't come across as appealing, with neither the sourness nor the smoke coming through well enough, strong enough, for either to succeed, even when they start to cooperate. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sticky finish. Overall, an interesting trip into brewing history, but this artifact just doesn't work for me.","TMoney2591","Dec 14, 2011"

3.99,6.7,3.5,4.5,4,3,4,"Smoked Sour What beer from Professor Fritz Briem (maker of one of the finest Berliner Weisse around)? I'm there! Pours a clear honey-gold with a soapy white head. Lovely aromas of Beechwood smoke, wheat malt, and lactic acid with a slight herbal character. Taste is similar to the nose, nice balance of smoke, wheat, and lactic acid with just a touch of funk. Reminds me a bit of the Westbrook Smoked Berliner Weisse I had at Brewvival last year, but not as clean. Mouthfeel is fairly light, with a slightly watery feel and lowish carbonation. Overall a very unique beer that I'm hoping gets bottled in the future. Incredibly happy to have tried this!","jsanford","Dec 02, 2011"

4.2,12.3,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Grodziskie is a Polish wheat-style brew from the days of yore. This current draught rendition, from Germany, arrived a cloudy golden color with a big sticky white cap of foam. This brew certainly has wheat character, but the smokey skeleton brings it together. The aroma is nutty and interesting. The body is thick with wheat. The flavors are earthy, smokey and yeasty. A slight touch of spice at the end provides balance. An interesting recreation of a bygone beer.","BeardedBoffin","Nov 21, 2011"
