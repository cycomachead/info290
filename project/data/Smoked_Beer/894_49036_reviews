"Nice smoky porter that does what it should without impressing excessively. But it tastes well, nevertheless."

"Miles better than the last couple from the style that I have tried, definitely a smoked beer but luckily it doesn't stink of ham or worse and can be drank with ease. The balance is good in this one and bar the hints of bacon right at the end of the aroma."

"Overall... Amazing. This is a really great beer with only a few pondering wonders. But it is good that the wonders and questions are pretty minor and I guess a little nit picky. This is a beer I will definitely be buying again. Great quality. Comparable to Schlenkerla and just as fine and wonderful. I keep at least one Schlenkerla in my stash at anytime, this would be another great smoke beer to do the exact same with and hopefully I will have the chance again in the future to do just that."
"Really tasty. I like what they were going for here. The smell and subtely smoky taste profile hold a really respectable complexity. And the smoked malt is incorporated so as to give a permeating character but not overly dominate the beer, making it still a tasty quaffable porter. Balance is great, one of the better smoked beers I've tried, this is worth the effort, really well-executed."
"The beer pours black with a thin tan head that dissipates quickly. Not much lacing is left on the side of the glass during consumption. The beer smells of dark malt, chocolate, and some mild smokiness. The beer doesn't have as much smokiness as I would want in a smoked beer, but the flavors are of dark malt and chocolate as well as smoke. Unfortunately, this bottle yields an ""old beer"" flavor, so I can't get a full impression of what might have been a smokier beer. The body is medium with moderate carbonation. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy and the beer is still pretty drinkable despite being old. This is a good beer."

"Lots of chocolate and sweet liquirice. Fresh and fruity. Light body. Perfect winter porter. The ideal porter would have been a couple of percent stronger and even richer and with a longer finish. But this beer is only 6%. I could drink it all night! And I have..."
"Overall a really nice dark and smokey beer, could drink it all day."
"Strikes a nice balance with the sweetness and meaty character, overall quite a nice smoked porter."

"O: The aroma of dark fruits, milk and dark chocolate, and peat was very inviting. Unfortunately, it's the only good thing about this beer. I'm not impressed. I could smell this all day, though."
"T & M-Medium bodied with lots of roasted malt flavors. The smoke is present but much more subtle than in the nose. Finishes with a lingering coffee ground taste."

"Overall; solid porter, minimal smokiness..."
"O: Jolly good beer, great porter!"
"Dr: Quite nice, slightly high ABV, and good quality. I could easily down quite a bit."
"I wish the cost was just a little lower."
"Overall: A nice smoked porter, with absolutely perfect balance!"
"An awesome smoke porter I would definitely buy again."
"Pours an almost opaque super dark reddish-brown with a 1 inch reddish-khaki head that fades to a thin film. Nice thick chunks of lace cling to the glass on the drink down. Smells of smoked malt, campfire, and bitter cocoa powder. Taste is of smoked malt and campfire up front with a cocoa powder finish. A very nice smoky taste from the beechwood. This beer has a lower carbonation level with a slightly thin body. Overall, this is a good smoked beer from Sweden and my first from Nils Oscar. I would definitely get this one again."
"Poured a deep garnet tinged brown with a thin toasted almond colored head that was gone in a flash.A nice mix of bitter chocolate,molasses,and hard wood smoke,sweet and smoky.The palate is highly roasted and earthy with a little molasses-like sweetness,the smoke is light and comes thru in a lingering finish.An easy drinker,the flavors are not in your face but keep you interested in drinking more."
"A really nice smoked beer without going overboard"
"D: Highly drinkable. A better quaff than Stone Smoked Porter, and not much pricier, I'd gladly hit this again when I don't want a smoky punch in the face, but do want a good sipping, thinking beer."
"Overall, it's an easy drinker. A bit sweet at times, though the smokiness seems to counter that quite well. Nice and balanced, a worthy brew for sure."
"D -"
"D: Nice porter right here. Not as good as Alaskan Smoked Porter, but it's satisfying and you get your money's worth."
"Pours dark brown with big tan head. Small rings of laing. Lots of smoke in the aroma, almost similar to bacon. Small small amounts of roasted malt and chocoalte. Smoke really present in the aftertaste as well. Medium bodied carbonation. A good introduction to Swedish beers."
"A very well-rounded and drinkable porter. I could happily enjoy three or four of these in a sitting."
"Jonah's bottle. Smokey aroma. Dark with a bubbly amberish head. Sourish in finish. Altogether fun smoked, middle of the road rating however, must have if you like smokey beers.Light peat.Average mouthfeel. One of the best from the brewery's offerings. Decent drinkability."
"Pours a near black color with some cola like highlights at the edges. The light brown head is fairly small and quicked lived, settles into a light ring. The aroma is of roasted and smoked malt with some meaty and tin notes. Perhaps a touch of milk chocolate. The smoke hits right off the bat in the flavor profile. Its not overly strong but its the most predominate flavor. The smoke bring some char and meaty flavors as well. The malt seems that of a traditional porter. Nice roasted malt flavor but not too thick or too roasty. Some dark fruit notes as well. By the looks of this beer I thought it was going to be a heavy, dare I say stout, porter but its not. The feel is light to moderate with tingly carbonation, drinks quite crisp and easy. Finishes with a roasty bitterness. I enjoy a nice smokey beer and this didn't disappoint. I think the smoke was in proper balance with the malt. A must try for those who like smokey brews."
"D: Nils Oscar don't make bad beers - this one is really nice. Try it you like it!"
"Google translate confirms it: RÃ¶k means ""smoke"". How very creative, Nils Oscar... It pours a nearly opaque black-brown topped by over a finger of glowing ecru foam. The nose comprises everything you'd want in a smoked porter: smoked ham, charcoal, roasted malts, ashy molasses, and a rather sweet brown sugar. The taste follows closely, though the charcoal and roasted malts are given starring roles compared to the other cast-mates. A decent bit o' spruce finds its way in as well, but not enough to challenge the supremacy of the smokey elements. The body is a hefty medium, with a moderate carbonation and a roastily chewy feel. Overall, a very tasty smoked porter, one to definitely seek out."
"This is the best Nils Oscar I've had, a super easy and yummy to drink smoke. Nothing to trade for our go nuts searching for, but if you are in Sweden and see it, get it."
"500 ml bottle. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours dark brown with about an inch and a half frothy tan head. Head retention is pretty good, and there's also a decent amount of lacing. Aroma is smoked and roasted malt, chocolate, coffee, and a bit of dark fruit. Taste is similar to the aroma, with a nice lingering smoky finish. Also, I think the smoke is stronger in the taste than it is compared to the aroma. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy and it has moderate carbonation. This brew is very easy to drink, it's pretty smooth and quite enjoyable. I think this is a good overall beer, I'll definitely buy this again the next time I see it."
"A nice drinkable beer that is a got starter for people who want to learn to appreciate smoke beers."
"A really good beer for a dark and cold night."
"Pours out a warm, opaque sable with a fairly thick tan head that does not hang around very long. Aroma is rich, sweet and smoky with a definite undertone of fine roast coffee. Flavor is rich and smooth, smoky with a coffee undertone and a strong hint of unsweetened chocolate, just slightly sweet. Texture is thick, smooth and quite fizzy, leaving a smoky and unsweet chocolate finish."
"this beer finishes out fairly light in body for a darker beer with a tangy smoke character that holds on to the tongue after the beer has gone. nice to see people making smoked beers, this one could use a little more of the smoke however to run with the rest of 'em i think."
"D- This is a pretty drinkable beer, all in all. After the nose, I really wanted to love this but the taste didn't quite live up. I forget what i paid for this but I know it was at least $5-6 for the one bottle. For about $4 I can get a stone smoked porter that destroys this, plus i get more! Would I visit this beer again, if it was free, I would for the smell alone."
"overall, a very drinkable beer... the most drinkable smoked porter that I've come across at least."
"-very solid. i am not huge on smokey beers, but this is pretty good for me. it is not overwhelming. for a smoked, it is one of my favorites"
"I will definitely buy more bottles of this."
"Overall this is a solid smoked porter that's well worth a shot."
"Bottle. Pours black with a small light tan head. Aroma of roasted malt, roasted meats, but overall just smokey (some cigarette smoke, some firewood smokiness). One of the smoked beers that has more smokiness as opposed to meatiness. Flavor is woodsy-smokey with light smoked meats in the background. Some bitter chocolate notes too. This is more of a ""smoky"" smoked beer as opposed to a ""smoky meats"" smoked beer, which is not really my preference, but otherwise I can't really fault the beer."
"Into a fluted tulip glass, this poured jet black, with a glint of ruby in the meniscus when held to the light. The nose was all smoke, fairly clean and dry. Flavors of carob, bittersweet chocolate, pipe tobacco. Bitter, earthy char. Smoke was prevalent, yet not overwhelming. It was like having campfire smoke on your clothes after a camping weekend. Long aftertaste of roasty char that seemed to linger forever. Before long I needed another sip, as it reminded me what I was missing. Split a bottle with Botham, but could have finished 1-2 easily."
"Bottle had at the Brick Store Pub. Pours brown/black with short loosely knit head that fades to a thin ring. Lightly smokey aroma, but not bacony. Tilts more toward the ash side. Taste is about the same. Ashy smoke flavors married with a dry porter flavor of roasted grains that are kept fairly restrained. Smooth and beefy mouthfeel. I like this beer, and it would be great with a cheese plate, but it doesn't rise to the level of excellence that the Schlenkerla beers do."
"D: Quite a good beer. The smoky character isn't that overwhelming so it's rather easy to drink. Nothing is really spectacular about it, but nothing seems out of place either - a well crafted brew. Recommended."
"This one was a real pleasure to consume. Delicious."
