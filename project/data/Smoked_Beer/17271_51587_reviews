"Overall: A unique seasonal that captures the essence of the California Wild Fires. I would not crave it, but I am happy to have tried it."

"Overall, I've had this before and will have it again. It's a must try for fans of smoked beers and wheat ones at that."

"Pours a murky honey orange with an orange-tan head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of smoked wheat and slight campfire aromas. Taste is the same but the smoke is pretty mild flavor wise. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is easy to drink."

"Aroma is full of campfire smoke right off the bat. I had been expecting it but it really came off quite strong and full. Really nicely done here I have to admit. Nice notes of light chocolate and big roasted malts are always a welcome treat. Flavor carries this over quite well as the chocolate and earthy notes lay underneath that wonderful smoky campfire like flavor that leaves a long finish"

"Drink- Overall a lot better than I thought. The smoke was very tame and a lot more layers unfolded. A well done beer. Earns a better grade than I was gonna give."
"Overall this beer is flat out Interesting. The most different beer I've ever had. That being said, it's not bad. It's just hard to say how good it is. But it is pretty good."
"Overall: This is hands down one of the most unique beers I have ever had. It's not bad and it's not great. I guess I would only describe it as interesting and worth a try."
"Appears a dark golden color. Smells of smoke with a little bit of sweetness coming through. The first taste to hit my palate was the smokiness followed by the sweetness. This beer almost has the sweetness of a Belgian golden ale which makes for an odd combination with the smoke. It is certainly an interesting combination though. The mouthfeel is not too heavy but still satisfying. This is a pleasant session beer. I don't know that I would buy another bottle but if I was somewhere where it was on draft I wouldn't hesitate to order one."
"D. Very"
"D-This would pair perfectly with a nice Socal wildfire."
"Tastes like burnt plants, a hint of zest, and ... I just can't get beyond the smoked character. Where's the wheat? It was a chore to finish half a pint."
"D: You really have to enjoy smoke to like this beer. Personally, it was far too much for me."
"D: A nice drinkable wheat beer for the summertime. I think this would go well with summer July BBQ. I missed it last year, but am glad I got to try it in this go around."
"D: I think that they could have done way better on this beer. It honestly seems liked they half ass it and didn't add enough of anything except peppers. although I did enjoy the pepper flavor that's about all it had."
"Overall a very good beer, i see myself drinking these in my near future!"
"I continue to be impressed by the work Aaron is doing at Bootlegger's. Smoked bananas don't sound appealing, yet it works in this beer. I'm happy to see a locally produced smoked beer on the market, but more importantly, one that tastes good."
"Very light and pretty drinkable. But then its a summer beer."
