3.62,1.1,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"D - This is an odd beer, it doesn't have much in common with the traditional German smoked beers, but manages to do pretty well... Until the finish. There is a sharp, acrid bitterness that turns the smoke harsh in the aftertaste, if this wasn't present it would be a pretty good beer, but the harshness is hard to ignore.","nickfl","Oct 12, 2012"
3.53,-1.4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Overall: I think the beer is well made for what it is rying to be. It captures enough of the smokiness to make this amber ale different without going overboard or being a full rauchbier which some people may not enjoy.","kylehay2004","Oct 06, 2012"

3.04,-15.1,4,2.5,3,4,3,"O-this is more of an introduction to smoke beers. It's maybe the most faint smoke beer I've ever had, which is amazing because it's one of the strongest ive had too. As an amber ale, it's still just okay,","AdamBear","Jul 21, 2012"

3.7,3.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,"D: A really okay beer. Not great, but an easy drinker for sure. Would absolutely pair well with some smoked or roasted meats, which I will try at some point. Cheers.","junjun1","Sep 12, 2011"

3.6,0.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,3.5,"Very smooth and ceamy. Soft carbonation and medium mouthfeel. I've tried this on draft and found it to be a better drinking experience from the bottle while grilling some meat. This beer pairs well with grilled meats but otherwise doesn't stand up on it's own.","nimrod979","Jul 29, 2011"
3.13,-12.6,3.5,3,3,4,3,"Overall - Big fan of Bryan Voltagio's cooking and restaurant Volt in Frederick is fabulous. This beer doesn't stand alone very well and is not an easy drinker for summer. Perhaps I should have saved it to sample with a BBQ sandwich or ribs as recommened. I could see how it would pair with that style of cooking since the smoked flavors are very mild and in the backround of this beer and could enhance the flavor of food. Not very sessionable and not a beer to sit with after mowing the yard as its not very refreshing. Definitely something that should not a continued line by Flying Dog unless done in small batches for sale at local BBQ restaurants or eateries.","bubseymour","Jun 03, 2011"

3.65,2,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Beer is thin in body with a strong dry smoke finish. As far as smoke beers go this is a good one. I enjoy the mild sweetness up front with a dry smoky finish. It gets a little harsh at the end with the more you drink but I'd have it again. Would make a great cooking solvent.","drabmuh","0"
