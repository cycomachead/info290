"O- Finally got to taste this fresh and it's quite good. Smoke is one of my least favorite flavors in beer but this one does a nice job of keeping it a subtle afterthought to the wheat base."
""
"Really no idea what to make of this. Tastes savoury, but insubstantial. Also weird."
""
"Overall: I was told this was a soured smoked wheat beer. I was dissapointed that it wasnt very tart or smokey. Its sounded really interesting. After having it, I felt that was a gimmick. I wouldnt necessarily call this a smoke beer, but it definately is a beer style that I have never tried(Gratzer Ale according to the beer label). Average and nothing too interesting here."

"O-This is an unique beer and one that I found really easy to drink. The flavors are restrained but provide enough oomph to stay interesting. If you want super sour, look elsewhere; if you want super smokey, look elsewhere; but if you want an easy-drinking beer that would go well with BBQ on a hot summer day, this is a good choice."

"Depending who you ask Grodziskie is (or should be) considered its own style. Styles are often distinguished either by the use of a specific ingredient, unique brewing process, or on the grounds of regional tradition - Grodziskie qualifies for all three and yet it's still not widely recognized as a distinct style. Regardless, this one is still a pretty good beer in its own right."
"I could drink this beer plenty in the summer months. It's an easy-sipper with enough flavor to keep me interested."
""
"Overall, this turns out to be highly quaffable. After a week in Utah, I am sensitized to what brewers can do with the 4.0 ABV limitation, and this one gets a lot of flavor with minimum hops at that benchmark. From the 500 ml bottle purchased at Mayfair Liquors in Denver."

"Moutfeel - Light body with small champagne style bubbles. Watery finish on palate as well - 3.25"

"Taste is very much like a pils. Ha s light body that is smooth and a bit creamy. It's crisp and the carbonation is just like a good pilsner. The taste is citrusy with a touch of lemon, a little spice, the natural sweetness of the grain and the tiny touch of banana for smoothness. The smoke in the drink remains light until it warms then you can taste actual smoke. It finishes with a nice tart flourish and a bit of the smoke quality, a nice contrasting sweetness and dry overall."

"Overall, it's very interesting: there's no doubt about that. And I'm glad to be able to say I've tried a Gr√§tzer. There's some level of integration here which is rather pleasant, but overall it just doesn't grab me, despite the obvious uniqueness of it."

"500 ml bottle. Served in a mug, the beer pours a hazy golden/orange color with a half inch off-white head. Both the head retention and lacing are decent enough. The aroma is light, the brew smells like wheat, smoke, and some fruitiness. It mostly tastes like smoked malt and wheat, along with some green grapes/grape skins, apples and a bit of tart lemon. The label says it's a sour smoked wheat ale, but there really isn't much tart/sourness in this at all. With that being said, it's not a bad tasting brew! Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's slick, smooth and easy to drink. At $6.49 a bottle, I don't think I'd pay that price for this again. But it was nice to try once."

"Smells of straw, funk, and a little fruit (cherries, apricot). Pale yellow, little head, effervescent with lots of fine bubbles. First taste is for wheat and smoke, unusual but tasty. Smoke is not overpowering, but it is at the forefront of the flavor profile. Sourness becomes more noticeable with every sip and is refreshing. I like this allot. Basically like a very nice Berlinner Weisse, with a smoke element. Pleasant aftertaste, does not coat the tongue."

"Beer is of medium-light body, with carbonation of medium-low intensity, resulting in a smooth, slightly foamy, slightly watery mouthfeel. Closes dry, with little stickiness remaining on the palate or lips."
"While I was disappointed that the advertised smoked wheat malt flavor was not as prominent as I thought it would be, it is still a privilege to try a style as obscure as a Piwo Grodziskie (""beer from Grodzisk""), which I would encourage more brewers to adopt to spice things up. At least it's there. Everything is really mellow and subtle, including the smoky woody malty flavor at the finish, but it's good to have something different for once. Not sure if it's worth the $7 or so I paid for it, but fans of German wheat beers to try it at least once."
"Soft and mellow smokiness with a little kick of tartness. The wheat malts create a smooth body and the finish is nice and crisp. Peppery/grassy bitterness rounds things off for a clean and refreshing beer that could be paired with food or could stand alone."
""
"T: It starts with a mild kick of golden apple, then starts to feel like it's going to get tart, but it never really does. There's just a kiss of tart, before a long, wet wheat and grain finish. The golden apple flavor carries through the finish as well. There's just a hint of smoked sea salt on the finish, but this never really becomes that smoky. It's smooth and pretty refreshing. I wouldn't call it bursting with flavor, but it's pleasant."

"interesting and refreshing but just OK overall, probably nice on a summers eve out by the pool not in the heat of the day"
""
"O: This is an example of a smoked beer done really well. If you don't like smoked beers then stay away, but the beer has a surprising amount of flavor, which stands up to the light smoking of the malts."
""
"O: not bad, just dull.... maybe ""dull"" is not the right word - ""dainty""?... comes across like a stupid-mellow Bamberg smoker"

"Pours a slightly hazy, golden/copper color. 1/4 inch head of a white color. Decent retention and poor lacing. Smells of sweet malt, pale malt, wheat, slight hops, lemon, and slight clove. Does not seem to fit the Smoked Beer category more aptly applies to a Berliner Weissbier. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. There is also a noticeable tartness. Tastes of pale malt, slight sweet malt, sight hops, slight wheat, hint of smoke, slight minerals, lemon, and a hint of clove. Overall, decent blend, body, and aroma, but smoke is almost non-existent."

"Pours an orangish yellow color. Fairly hazy. Slightly off-white head. Kinda rocky. Fades pretty quickly. Not a very pretty beer, but it's not an important consideration to me. The aroma is smoke with some spicy, mineral-ish hops. There's a touch of sourness and a kinda stale malt flavor. Very mild. Taste is a bit better. It's mildly tart with some nice background wheat and malt sweetness. Low level of bitterness. Good mix of wheat and hop spiciness with yeast or, maybe, actual spicing. Sort of a grassy, wheaty finish. Some funky, earthy flavors are also in the mix. Mild woody smoke. A little too much sweetness for my palate or I'd go higher with my score. Mouthfeel is a bit full. I'd prefer the beer to be a touch crisper, but the smoke might make that kinda odd. Relatively low carbonation. This was a fun beer to try, but it's just a bit mild, and the malt sweetness doesn't quite seem right. I also wonder if a fresher bottle would have a little more hop kick to it, as the label alludes to hops as a highlight and they don't really come across with much strength. Still, I'm always happy to try lesser known and historical styles."

"Very unique stuff. Get yourself a bottle of this, for the sake of science if nothing else."
""
"You would do well to disregard this review, as I'm 85% sure this is a case of ""beer that has gone bad"" rather than ""beer I don't like."" I love smokey beers. How it skunked is a mystery (in the brown bottle) but I'm going to try and get a refund on this one if I can."
"O - I wouldn't consider this a smoked beer but rather a wheat beer with a mild smoke. Nonetheless its tasty, clean and enjoyable."
" I was pleased to give it a whirl, but it won't be something I will be charging back to the store for and grabbing up each and every time I see it."
"Now, if I can just find a recipe to brew this at home..."
"A fascinating, resurrected relic of a beer style. Well done, Herr Doktor Professor Briem. Smoked beer fans will find a lot to like here. A ton of flavor in a low-ABV package. (4.5)"
"While its a little pricey for a 500ml bottle ($7), I could see this being one of those cool beers to pick up once a year, best used when grilling around the pool in summertime."

"The beer poured a light, hazy amber that produced a nice white foamy head that was retained for a minute or so and then faded into a thin ring. The aroma was interesting as it boasted mainly a smoky aroma with hints of citrus hops. The taste of the beer was good, upfront it tasted more like Hefe, but at the back end, the smoke kicked in with a slight pepper quality as well. The beer had a light feel to it with decent carbonation. Overall, not a great beer, but one that I might be tempted to drink again."
""
"O: Aside from Bootlegger's Wildfire Wheat, I've never had a smoked wheat beer. This is great, more brewers should do this, it'd be great for a BBQ."
"Overall. I liked this just fine. The smoke flavour and amount is actually pretty nice. Not the least bit overdone."
""

"Professor Briem's Grodziskie pours a lightly hazy orange. Maybe two fingers worth of white foam rise up and linger for a minute before fading. The nose is very interesting, featuring well balanced interplay between smoke, spicy saaz hops, and a touch of tart, citric lemon. The flavor profile leads off with a bit of a grainy, wheat taste, only for a peppery flourish from the hops to come in next. A light smokiness comes in for the close. Though it's not particularly intense, it does manage to blunt most of the impact of the delicate sourness present (or at least anticpated based on the aroma). The body has a little more heft than I might have anticipated from a 4% beer, and the carbonation just doesn't quite liven the beer up enough. This gratzer's a fairly unique kind of beer, and one that I'm glad I tried. Don't know if I'd actively seek out another one though."
"Poured into a Celebrator pokal. Pours a slighlty coudy light orange amber. This white head leaves islands of foam and a ring around the glass, no lacing. Aroma of light bready malt, wheat and a hint of smoke. Flavor starts with light wheat, lemon and faint smokiness, becomes a little sweeter with light wheat and malt and finishes with somewhat abrupt dry wheat with faint memories of sour wheat and smoke. Very subtly flavored, but interesting flavor progression. Light bodied, but to style for a wheat beer. An interesting nearly extinct local style that is well worth bringing back for its unique flavors. I like what the Professor has been doing with these historical recreations."
"500 ml bottle into pint glass, no bottle dating. Pours hazy golden straw color with a nice 2 finger fluffy white head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Some ok lacing on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon zest, herbal, toasted grain, bread, citrus peel, light smoke, and earthy spiciness. Some nice and balanced aromas with decent strength. Taste of lemon, orange peel, herbal, toasted grain, bread, wheat, floral, pear, and earthy spiciness. Lingering notes of lightly tart citrus, herbal, bread, toast, and earthy spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Great balance of malt flavors with the earthy spiciness; tartness is quite subtle overall. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a slightly slick and extremely smooth mouthfeel. Extremely easy to drink; with no alcohol presence as expected of 4%. Overall this is a really nice traditional style ale! Nice flavor balance and complexity; and extremely smooth. I really enjoyed this one."
"Medium bodied with a sweet tartness that I expected from the description but was lacking in the nose. Subtle earthy funk along with a strong citrus/lemon peel presence. Plenty of zesty spice with hints of coriander and pepper along with some bready yeast. Smoke less prominent than the aroma suggests. Tastes more like a slightly sour, sweeter wheat beer with traces of smoke lingering in the finish. Pretty good but if the sweetness was toned down and there was a bit more smoke I would love it. Interesting but I probably wouldn't buy it again."
"This is super drinkable. The smell is a bit off putting but wow is this a quaffer, I want a large scale cheaper version of this."

"On another note, I hope the Bros add a Gr√§tzer style to the site. I would love to be able to explore this style in more depth."

"Pours a murky honey orange with a 1 inch foamy white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of smoked grain and some tart/sour aromas. Taste is of slightly smoked wheat and campfire flavors. There is a slight sourness on the tongue with each sip but nothing too strong. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer and an interesting style for sure perhaps to one day be added to the style list on BA."

"I'm ok with this one, and glad I tried this version of a this forgotten style. But nothing I'd rush out to get again. Tasty, different, and just ok."
"O: Extremely interesting and something that I think I could enjoy more regularly. A very interesting style and a nice example which is quite successful. Mixture of the flavors and aromas make this beer easy to enjoy and sessionable."
"A great sessionable sour wheat beer."
""
"O: The pour and the smell had me excited...this beer is median at best."
"O: Not bad, but all the aromas and flavors are pretty weak. However, this is enjoyable."
""
"O: On the whole, this is a solid, drinkable beer. Worth trying."
"O: This beer is an interesting take on a forgotten style and seems to resemble a hybrid between a Rauchbier (with the smoke) and a Berliner Weissbier (with the sourness). The light-bodied nature and low alcohol content makes this very easy to drink."
"D - With historical styles like this it can sometimes be kind of hard to judge, but in this case it is a very drinkable beer by any standard. Reminiscent of a Gose with an even more spicy character and light, but noticeable, smoke character that is at its strongest in the aroma. Like the other Fritz Briem beers, this is a must try for any true beer geek."
"Smoky rauchbier aroma at first, pork-derived, sweet smoky bacon, with a light lemony accent behind it. Flavor is similar, smoky woody malts blend oddly enough with lemongrass and a flash of tartness upfront. Lingering aftertaste of sweet smoked malts, and vague floral fruitiness. Even celery maybe. Tartness is gentle and not overly dominating. Aftertaste is really mild and pleasant actually. Carbonation is fairly low, and its medium bodied. Something different to be sure, hope this historical series continues."

"It's been a while since I was excited to try a Polish-style beer... This one pours a lightly hazy goldenrod topped by a finger or so of dirty cream foam. The nose comprises lemon-coated must, light wisps of smoke, and toasted wheat. I can't say this is the most appealing smell in the world, but it's not all bad. The taste starts off with a mildly tart lemon flavor, then goes into a lightly smoky haze, then revisits the sourness with some sour, funky wheat. Again, like the smell, things just don't come across as appealing, with neither the sourness nor the smoke coming through well enough, strong enough, for either to succeed, even when they start to cooperate. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sticky finish. Overall, an interesting trip into brewing history, but this artifact just doesn't work for me."

"Smoked Sour What beer from Professor Fritz Briem (maker of one of the finest Berliner Weisse around)? I'm there! Pours a clear honey-gold with a soapy white head. Lovely aromas of Beechwood smoke, wheat malt, and lactic acid with a slight herbal character. Taste is similar to the nose, nice balance of smoke, wheat, and lactic acid with just a touch of funk. Reminds me a bit of the Westbrook Smoked Berliner Weisse I had at Brewvival last year, but not as clean. Mouthfeel is fairly light, with a slightly watery feel and lowish carbonation. Overall a very unique beer that I'm hoping gets bottled in the future. Incredibly happy to have tried this!"
"Overall - Thanks to Max's for this rare offering. Refreshing brew and hope the style popularity grows."
"All things considered, this is pretty impressive...."
"Grodziskie is a Polish wheat-style brew from the days of yore. This current draught rendition, from Germany, arrived a cloudy golden color with a big sticky white cap of foam. This brew certainly has wheat character, but the smokey skeleton brings it together. The aroma is nutty and interesting. The body is thick with wheat. The flavors are earthy, smokey and yeasty. A slight touch of spice at the end provides balance. An interesting recreation of a bygone beer."
""
"Overall: I had a tough time describing this one. Really different."
