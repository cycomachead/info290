Smell is smokey, meaty with lots of BBQ and campfire aromas, faint touch of peat, more or less a malty smokey affair all the way through. Taste is like the nose, smoke and malt, BBQ and meaty flavours, just a touch of lightly salty peat, more campfire aftertaste. Medium carbonation, medium body, good feel. Solid and worth drinking again, basically a second rate Schlenkerla which is quite the compliment for this style.","peensteen","Mar 01, 2014"

Whereas i found Aecht sessionable or a everyday beer this was a bit more bold, but non the less an astounding beer and kudos to Dieu du Ciel for another great beer.","Haydn-Juby","Nov 03, 2013"

Smokey malts with an almost meaty smoke aroma, kind of like bacon. The taste is of the smokey malts and earth. Burnt leaves and a campfire. Dry with some charred oak. The mouthfeel is somewhat light and thin which help makes this brew more drinkable considering the amount of smoke flavor. I love this style of beer but haven't been able to find many really good ones. Overall, this is the best Rauchbier I have ever had (thus far).","PicoPapa","Nov 07, 2012"

4,5.8,3.5,3.5,4.5,3.5,4,"Pours brown and clearish with a light tan ring that doesn't last. Smells of smoky meat and BBQ. The body begins with a very BBQ finish with burnt meat notes in it.

4.18,10.6,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Pours a deep violet/burgundy, creamy offwhite cap that laces well. Nose is a rich meaty and woody smokiness, with some faint underlying sweetness. Taste is a slight change of pace as smoke and rich caramel notes present themselves in unison, taking turns presenting themselves on the palate. Great malt flavour. Smooth mouthfeel, with moderate lingering smoke and caramel sweetness. Heavy medium in body and a lower medium carbonation. Very drinkable and solid, if on the sweeter side, smoked offering.","liamt07","Apr 27, 2011"
4.16,10.1,4.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Excellent taste, too. Peaty, smoky, but not overpowering, not caustic in the throat. Sweet malt fades into the smoke, leaving a pleasant smoky aftertaste. This is a really nice beer. First time I've had it and with the year on it, it's really held up well. Now to seek it out fresh..the new chore upon me.","dragonWhale","Apr 02, 2011"
3.92,3.7,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Picked this up on a trip to montreal. Completely different beer now from the frist time I had it. The beer is almost porter-like in how dark it is. It has a nice dense white head which lingers and leaves a bit of lacing. This beer smells like eating bacon and beef jerky at a campfire. There is a little bit of grainyness and nuttiness but really it is all about the smoke here. The taste just has more and more hickory bacon smokiness with a mild nutty sweetness to lend a bit of balance. The mouthfeel is a little light and is also lacking a bit of carbonation. Would definitely benefit from a bit more. Overall, this beer is an experience more than anything else. Huge smokiness when fresh. I would love to see something like this as a bigger beer, but I would be afraid I couldn't handle any more smoke.","Agold","Jan 12, 2011"
3.92,3.7,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Pours lightly smokey yellow with lasting three-eighths of an inch lasting head.

Average mouthfeel, smooth, Very drinkable.A lovely smoked beer, thanks Luc!","Sammy","Dec 02, 2010"
3.72,-1.6,4,4.5,3.5,3,3.5,"DDC would sit comfortably in my top 8 Canadian breweries but this beer doesn't do much for its position there. It seems to be one of those cases where a great beer was turned into a good beer by lacking in just one aspect; the mouthfeel. If making a fuller body entails increasing the alcohol content, I'd say it's more than worth it. This one's worth a try but can't contend with many other DDC offerings.","ludachris","Nov 04, 2010"
4,5.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a light brown colour with a finger of tan head. Some mild lacing around the glass. Nice head retention until the end. Smells of campfire/chimney smoke with some roasted malt and chocolate. This seems to be a smoked porter, or at least similar enough to that. Very smooth carbonation level. A nice beer and anyone that likes smokey beers should try this.","kwjd","Aug 20, 2010"

Very smooth and not overpowering though. The flavor lasted a while after you swallowed and you get a nice integration of a campfire flavor and brown malts. I wish this beer wasn't so thin. I would've liked it to have some more body. This was definitely one of the best smoked beers I've had and I'm not a very big fan of the style.","BearsOnAcid","Jul 21, 2010"

4.14,9.5,4,5,4,4,3.5,"This was my first from Dieu du Ciel, and I was overall impressed. I would much prefer this to the Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier, which is a little too overwhelming to enjoy an entire bottle of. However, the smokiness is still very much more pronounced than something like Stone's Smoked Porter, or other beers where the smoke flavor is just an addition (opposed to the centerpiece). Would only recommend to those familiar with rauchbiers, but because of its mildness, serves as an excellent introduction to the style.","zhooker","May 10, 2010"
3.5,-7.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"D: This definitely takes a different approach on the style. It's much easier to drink than the other because it's not as strong, but I feel like it's a little to weak. Good beer to try, but nothing else.","Long813","May 10, 2010"

4.02,6.3,3.5,4,4,3.5,4.5,"Very well integrated smoke, doesn't overwhelm like some. Helped out by a nice grassy, minerally hop bitterness in the finish which, when paired with the malt base, almost reminds me of an alt + smoke. A little thin in the body but the lack of heft makes this more of a plain ol' drinker, especially with the well integrated smoke. Would gladly drink it again, paired well with BBQ. Thanks Robbo!","ritzkiss","Apr 30, 2010"
3.75,-0.8,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"This could be even more drinkable than Aecht Schlenkerla, in spite of being a lesser beer overall. Especially drinkable as a smoked beer, I could session this if I felt like something smoky. This would actually be great to drink a bunch of while sitting around a fire on a cool summer evening.","eat","Apr 28, 2010"
3.87,2.4,3.5,4,4,4,3.5,"Bottle: Poured an amber color ale with a large off-white foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of smoked wood with caramel malt in the background. Taste is also a nice mix between some deep smoky notes and smoked salmon with some lightly sweet caramel malt. Body is about average with good carbonation. Very well done with nice balance between the smoke and the malt bill.","Phyl21ca","Apr 21, 2010"
4.32,14.3,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Poured into my Sam Adams perfect pint glass this is a slightly reddish dark brown beer with a reasonable head. What you really notice is the intense smoky nose that grabs your attention. The beer is a solid ale with all sorts of smoked malt. The finish is dry and the smoke lingers on your tongue. Great beer as I love smoked beer and cheese. Goes well with Morrocan Lamb Stew","canucklehead","Apr 20, 2010"
4.15,9.8,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"thanks hoser for this one and the glass I poured it in to for that matter. my only regret with this beer is I have no BBQ to pair with it and no campfire to hypnotize me while I drink it","wordemupg","Beers"

3.99,5.6,3,4,4.5,3.5,3.5,"Dark color beer. It is dark brown with a creamy head on top. As usual with this brewery, the head stick well to the glass. The aroma is smoked!... wow I like this. I get some bacon in there too. No hops. On the taste side, it is smoked again. Everywhere from start to finish. More like a smoked wood than bacon, however. The taste is better than the smell. A bitterness in the end, however it is not strong. One good thing is the taste lingers in the mouth for a good amount of time. We note also the carbonation in the mouth. A good smoked beer.","ZorPrime","Mar 11, 2010"
3.67,-2.9,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Very interesting overall, but I probably wouldn't have more than one in a sitting. Best use would be as an accompaniment for food, such as stew or chili.

3.62,-4.2,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"On tap at the brewpub. I wias looking forward to this one. Standard amber colour with good clarity and white head. You can definitely pick up the wisp of smoke in the nose. Just like a recently snuffed out campfire. Taste is more moderate than I thought it would be. The smoke is definitely there, but not in your face or harsh. I dont pick up much in the hop department, just a mildly smokey, easy driking amber ale. Would have been nice to spend more time there and settle into a couple of these.","oakbluff","May 13, 2007"

As the commercial description says : ""The smoky taste is quite dominant at each new draught"". We'd regret the smoky taste for long if it'd ever quit the mouth. and while it's so long-lasting, it remains comfortable and light with slight hints of salmon in the finish.
