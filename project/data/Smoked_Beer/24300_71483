This is a very dry beer with the smokiness sucking any sweetness away from the tongue.  Long lasting aftertaste of dark, Baker's chocolate and bittering hop.

4.24,13.4,4.25,4,4.5,3.75,4.25,"When you pour this beer, it's very Dark and Black with an impressive Off White head which seems to carry on forever! In fact, pouring this one normally I couldn't fit it in my Duvel Tulip. It dissipates slowly leaving a little bit of lacing which eventually disappears completely. It's got great retention and eventually fades to a ring around the glass whilst you're enjoying this. On the nose, tonnes of peat smoke aromas, a little bit of Rye, Chocolate, Caramel and Toffee with a touch of Alcohol. I love Smoked Beers, so this made we want to put it straight down the hatch! On the palate, lots of Smoke to begin with, Rich Dark Chocolate, Toffee, Burnt Sugar and a little bit of a Citrusy finish. What an amazing, complex flavour. The Carbonation is pretty high for the style, but it was to be expected with this style and actually brings out the complexity in this brew. It's smooth and finishes Medium Dry. What a beer for Spring weather, although it's seriously smokey the other flavours in there are ridiculously balanced.","Sam-VW","Mar 04, 2015"

Hints of dark chocolate, black pepper, and strong black coffee. Smells just like an ashtray as stated in the name with hints of a bitter cocoa.

Lots of flavors, lots of character, very complex.  Malts are darkly toasted, no bitter roast flavor, hops are understated, but there's a good balance of sweet and bitter.  Slightly ashen dark roasted malt flavor lingers, perhaps hence the name. Full mouth feel, moderate carbonation. Alcohol strength is masked by the flavors. Very good beer.","far333","Jan 27, 2015"

Apparently smoked porters aren't really my thing, I love Stone, but I didn't like their smoked porter with vanilla bean, and it is highly rated. With this the pour, color, and mouth feel were fine, but I got smoked fish, and band aid in the nose, and the flavor came off like burnt band aid. I have liked almost all Evil Twin brews I have had, but this was a major disappointment, at least for me. Again, it is probably just not my style, but I think it would of went well with BBQ'ed pork as a pairing.","mconner666","Dec 20, 2014"

The aroma is smoked, roast malts. The taste is a rich creamy roastyheavily smoked flavor. Like the best Rauch bier. I've had smoked porters before, but this one is American style-over the top.

3.77,0.8,4,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Overall I thought this was a nice beer and a nice example of the style, giving Evil Twin's reputation and what they wrote on the label i was expecting the smokey aspect to be more intense than it was and that could be because of the age, but I have noticed age effect the smoke that much in my experience, so I'm not sure about that.  This beer had a nice drinkability, it was smooth, a little creamy, a little crisp, not too filling and the taste did a nice job of holding my attention, I think one is the perfect amount for me, anymore than that and it might start to wear on me.  What I like the most about this beer was the complexity, the cherry flavors added a nice layer of complexity to it.  What I liked the least about this beer was that the roasted malts and smoke weren't just a little stronger, I found myself wishing those aspects were more intense.  I would buy this beer again, but it isn't something I'm going to stock up on and I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of smoked beers.  All in all I was happy with this beer, it wasn't quite what I was expecting, but in the end I enjoyed it and i think it was a little unique for the style.  This isn't my favorite Evil Twin beer or my favorite Smoked Beer, it falls above the middle in both categories.  Nice job guys, this was a nice Smoked Porter, keep up the solid work.","StoutHunter","Nov 16, 2014"

Good balance and complexity of dark/roasted/smoked malt flavors; with solid robustness and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a moderately creamy, smooth, and lightly chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice smoked imperial stout. Good complexity and balance of dark/roasted/smoked malt flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. Flavors did not feel as bold as I was expecting for a 9% stout, but is a nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jun 17, 2014"

There is an ""ashy"" idea here but it comes off very nice. The flavor brings out a tart prune malt shrouded in cigar ash and leathery tobacco. There's a little bit of whole grain flavor deep down but it's hard to overcome the primary smoky theme. This is medium plus bodied porter with a fairly chewy but smooth feel with quiet carbonation. As porters go this is a big flavored brew and I can see it being a controversial one. Either really like it or really dislike it. It's easily a good one for me.","Durge","Apr 02, 2014"

Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's the addition of some dark fruit and an earthy flavor. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's slick and has a good amount of carbonation.

Flavor starts with a healthy dose of campfire smoke, developing dark toasted malt, coffee, nuts and peat. Finishes with great lingering smoke, dark toasted malt and light vanilla. Medium, creamy body. This is definitely the most complex smoke flavor I've experienced in smoked beer and although I am not a cigar smoker, the flavor does suggest the rich leathery smoke from cigars. The ashtray moniker is appropriate, but the stout gives more of a suggestion of the smoke before the stogie gets to the ashtray. Well done and very enjoyable.

If you are bored with the average stout, this stout sure packs a great deal of excitement. Toward the finish, one detects elements of vanilla toward the back of the tongue. If the sweetness on this stout went a little higher, this would be near perfect. In the aftertaste, a woody vanilla finish yields to a warming sensation.

T - Roasted malts and dark chocolate with the smokiness also coming through on the taste. M - Light to medium body with little carbonation. A nice beer. I can imagine the smokiness being nice for a beer pairing with food. Not your average stout.","shanblur","Jan 07, 2012"

4,7,4,4,4,4,4,"Served from bottle into a Unibroue La Fin du Monde tulip. Poured pitch black with a minimal light tan head. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of roasted malt, charred malt, smoke, and subtle dark fruit. The flavor was of sweet malt, dark fruit, smoke, dark chocolate, and charred malt. It had a heavy feel on the palate with very low carbonation. Overall this was a pretty decent brew. If I am completely honest, I never would have guessed that this one was a RIS by smelling it or tasting it alone. Now that I know it is, some of the flavors I got make a little sense (dark fruit). While this was pretty good it was just a little too bitter for my liking with the charred malt flavor I got. Worth trying if you get the chance for sure despite this fact.","thagr81us","Oct 17, 2011"
4.26,13.9,5,4,4.5,4,4,"Rich aroma is strongly smoky with undertones of coffee and molasses and a hint of caramel. It pours a deep, opaque sable with a very thick, fine-bubbled and rather persistent tan head. Smoky flavor has notes of molasses, burnt wood, fine roast coffee and licorice. Full-bodied texture is smooth and just a little fizzy. Not the best Imperial Stout I have ever had, but definitely a worthy one.","Cyberkedi","Oct 12, 2011"

2.98,-20.3,4,3.5,2.5,3,3,"This was a bit of a disappointment. I think the idea was exciting; combining heavy, woody smoke with the sweet moments of a milk stout. Sadly, the execution doesn't match the brilliance of the idea.","deapokid","Sep 19, 2011"
3.88,3.7,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Bottle shared at the September iteration of the Santa Cruz tasting series. Pours black with clear red corners and a cocoa head. Peaty chocolatey aroma, sweet and moussey. Flavor is well-balanced with equal parts dark chocolate, sugary coffee and smokey meat, with a boozy bitter finish. Not a very aggressive stout, subdued overall but a good blend of flavors.","illidurit","Sep 17, 2011"
4.07,8.8,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Notes: All hype aside this is quite a good brew. WeÂ´ll see about the other offeringsâ€¦ Given that it rides somewhat on MikkellerÂ´s rep it has a tough road ahead to make a significant dent once the new distribution launch settles. The overblown pricing, despite the solid quality, will hinder the choice. It is good but not that price bracket good.","Daniellobo","Sep 12, 2011"

3.4,-9.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,2.5,3.5,"O - I would actually liked more smoke on this one, but not all that bad. The vinous notes detract from the beer, IMO. Not a bad RIS, but nothing great.","Sean9689","Sep 04, 2011"
4.08,9.1,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Very tightly constructed and a pleasure to consume. This is prime material for a dessert beer and/or to accompany a good cigar.","Zraly","Aug 30, 2011"

4.12,10.2,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Part of my smoke-fiend find in Chi-Town last week. Got some. It pours a straight onyx topped by over a finger of sienna foam. The nose comprises molasses, red wine, light maple syrup, roasted malts, smoked hickory, and a touch of chocolate syrup. Oh yeah, baby. The taste starts off with plenty of roasted malts, molasses, and dark chocolate, then moves into a woody, slightly vinous smoke, which melds with the molasses and red wine as it lingers in the finish. The wine is a bit much for me, as it detracts from the more straight-forward smoke. The body is a hefty medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly lightly chewy feel. Overall, a very nice smoked stout, one that stands apart from its ilk due to the hickory and wine characters. Good times.","TMoney2591","Aug 20, 2011"
2.78,-25.7,4,3.5,2,4,2.5,"Overall -- I bought two of these, and probably won't buy any more. I will throw the second one in the cellar for a year and see if the flavor changes for the better.","kfargo","Aug 18, 2011"
