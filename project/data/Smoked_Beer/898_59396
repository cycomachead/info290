Bready, fruit-laden yeastiness with malts that are soft and chocolaty. ABV is well hidden and has a soft, lightly creamy mouthfeel - carbed just about right.

Jet black color, looks like most imperial stouts. The nose is almost all milk to dark chocolate with coffee ice cream and licorice, so much malt you just start wondering where the smoke is, touch of pork rinds and oats, no significant hops presence, comes across like a chocolaty porter more than a smoked beer. Medium-bodied, firm presence in the mouth if perhaps kinda immobile, albeit without the massiveness. Chocolate, cocoa, mocha in spades, light coffee roast. Sliver of grapefruit citrus helps stiffen things. No real fruit, maybe apricot or peach pit. Carbonation is smooth bubbles up now and then, not a major factor. Candy character doesn't bring out much earth, tobacco or herbal qualities. Maybe some brazil nuts or cashews.

Aroma is roasted malt, bittersweet chocolate, molasses, caramel, and smoke. The taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes like roasted malt, chocolate, smoke, and some coffee and burnt/charred malt. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy and has moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's smooth and goes down easy. I think it's a good porter, but not quite smoky enough for me. For being a smoked porter, I think it should have more smoke aroma and flavor in the brew. I've had both Weyerbacher Fifteen and Nils Oscar Rökporter recently, and I think those are both much smokier than this brew.

3.06,-17.1,4,3,3,3,3,"Grabbed a bottle of this at Kappys in Medford tonight. Smoke on the Water pours out a nice black color, with a finger of tan heading. Nose is of moderately dark chocolate, and some brown bread. Very little smoke can be detected in the nose here. Surprisingly the taste has hardly any smoke either, perhaps a hint at best. More dark chocolate, and fruit come through, making this more similar to a straight up American Porter than a smoked one. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy, and drinks well. While this isn't a bad brew, it is simply not what the label claims is. I am sure they did smoke this beer, but there is little evidence to support that theory from the smell or taste. If you are looking for a simple, decent Porter, this one should work. Those seeking the smoke should look elsewhere.","jamie2dope","Jul 20, 2010"
3.4,-7.9,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,"Drinkability: Personally, I found it to be a flimsy porter imparted with a lackluster smoke character, and therefore an unappealing brew. I tried this a week later out of the bottle at a dear friend's cookout - same results, sadly.","ChainGangGuy","Jul 19, 2010"
3.88,5.1,4,3.5,4,4,4,"D: A very drinkable porter, especially for the ABV, although I keep stopping myself from typing stout as this is a robust brew, but not as advertised, at least in the batch this bottle came from as the smoke component is nonexistent. I still liked the beer quite well though as it brings a nice flavor punch of chocolate, coffee, and tobacco hops notes.","argock","Jul 17, 2010"
4.35,17.9,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"I can hear those crunching opening chords now... This guy pours a pretty much opaque black-brown topped by a nice finger of light tan foam. The nose has some light smokey notes, but mostly it's roasted malts. Not much else in there, really, though some light chocolate and caramel dart hither and yon like frightened hummingbirds. The taste is similarly dominated by the roasted malts, backed-up by some brown sugar, molasses, cocoa, and caramel. A lovely kiss of peat smoke comes in near the middle, surrounding the other flavors, cradling them all the way home. Lovely. The body is a nice medium, with a relatively light carbonation and a sliky smooth feel. One of the best Heavy Seas brews yet, and a very tasty smoked porter overall. Get some!","TMoney2591","Jul 15, 2010"

3.28,-11.1,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3,"22oz bottle into a Duvel tulip pours a deep almost opaque black with a decent frothy khaki head that diminishes to a ring and barely leaves any lacing on the glass. Aroma is slight brown malts and just a trace of smoke. The taste is an unusual blend of espresso and smoked malt with just a trace of hops. The beer is on the heavy side of medium with some sticky lingering alcohol. I'll admit, I did not get my hopes up on this one, especially after the Smoked Porter Highland released last year that was so great, oh well, the Mutiny Fleet seems to be getting back to it's not so great roots.","atsprings","Jul 05, 2010"
3.78,2.4,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"This pours a watery midnight black with a slight khaki colored head. The smell isn't over powering. I thought it would be smokier. It smells like a rich dark roast coffee. That carries over to the taste. The flavor is rich and coffee like, with little smokiness. It's pretty standard. As for the mouthfeel, it's a little watery compared to other porters. It's appealing but nothing overly special. This one is drinkable but not one of Clipper City's best. The Letter of Marquee is a better option.","aasher","Jul 01, 2010"
3.93,6.5,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"At least on cask, I don't get more then a hint of smoke, but otherwise this is a pretty solid beer.

3.68,-0.3,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Pours a deep brown color with a decent tan head that retains OK and leaves nice lacing. The aroma has a litte dark chocolate and coffee upfront, along with some smoked meat, salt, burnt bread, some blackberry and a little alcohol. The flavor starts out with a bacon and smoked meat flavor, along with a little sea salt, some dark chocolate, espresso, black cherry, burnt bread, and some alcohol. The mouthfeel is moderate, and drinkability is pretty good. Overall a decent smoked porter, not particularly complex or interesting but tasty nonetheless.","silver0rlead","Jun 25, 2010"

3.08,-16.5,3.5,3,3,3.5,3,"Drinkability: this beer was really a decent porter, but forget the fact this is smoked as there is barley a hint of smokiness here. Not what I expected as I wanted some more smokiness.","Gavage","Beers"
2.98,-19.2,3.5,3,3,2.5,3,"Pours a syrupy, opaque dark brown with a foamy light tan head. The head starts off initially large and billowy before quickly fading to a thin film with one or two large clumps of lacing and a lot of random small spots of lace that slide down the inside of the glass. Aroma is disappointing in the amount of smoke, as it smells like a typical, roast-y porter. Mild sweetness, artificial chocolate-like similar to Siren Noire, attempts to balance out the roasty charred aromas, but unfortunately the smell of stale ashtray dominate, not the type of smoke hoped for. Similar to the recent Rye Porter, the mouthfeel is way off for the style, syrupy and watery, with little carbonation and significantly lacking in overall body. Malt body flavor has a slightly more smokey taste than the aroma would have suggested, but milk chocolate sweetness ends up dominating throughout and in the finish. There also seems to be a potent boozy alcohol burn in the finish, which is disappointing for this abv and style. The aftertaste has the strongest "smokey" flavor returning to the unpleasant stale ashtray of the aroma. Not really a great example of a american porter, smoked porter or smoked beer, or whatever you want to call it. Not as bad a beer as my score suggests, but doesn't really compare to beers like Alaskan's smoked porter or even Captain Lawrence's Pleasantville.","yourefragile","0"
