4.21,2.2,4,4.25,4.25,4,4.25,"Draft at Blackback, Waterbury. HD is a deep brown in color with a nice cap of beige carbonation. The base structure brings out a lot of robust malt character on the brown ale end of the spectrum, in a balanced complexity - browned bread, toffee and caramel, chocolate malt, and deep toast. Alongside runs an implanted and balanced beechwood smoke - meaty and very pleasant, backs up well to the firm malt back. On the fuller side of moderate in body with a moderate, gentle carbonation. Unique from any other smoked beer Iâ€™ve had, very nice.","blackie","Oct 04, 2013"

Smell is smoky but a nice amount of caramel, roasted malt, cocco, and earth pop through in the scent, not smoked to the max. Taste is pretty well rounded and I got more out of it with each sip. The smoke sort of surrounds the other flavors mentioned above and dont take over the show. Taste is decadent, body is rich and medium and the carb is not a tounge lasher, this went down rather smoothly, with no intrusion from the 7.5% I could of drank a lot more of this beer, it did not bonk me over the head with ash and smoke.

4.04,-1.9,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Phew, it's carbonated, albeit it bit light however that's fine for the style. Very smokey as the nose lead on, it's almost a bit like scotch in that peaty rustic smoke way. Theres a very velvety mouthfeel that is really mellow and smooth with just the lightest carbonation bite on your tongue that comes through when you hold it in your mouth. Some more caramel and chewy molasses starts to come through as you get through the smoke. Very unique beer, calling it an American Brown doesn't do it justice.","kingcrowing","Nov 18, 2010"

Easily, one of the smoothest beers I have ever tasted. The head on this is like molten, smoky foam. Perfect smoke, perfect brown, perfect beer. Nuff said. Exceptional smoked beer. Gives any smoked beer I have had a run for the money.","Jdiddy","Nov 14, 2010"
