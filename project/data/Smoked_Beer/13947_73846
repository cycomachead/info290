4.3,18.8,3.75,4.25,4.25,4.5,4.5,"22oz bottle served in a standard tapered glass. True to its name the beer is straw yellow in color, slightly hazy, with a substantial white head. Considerable aroma suggesting smoke, fresh rye bread, with a little yeasty quality, like perhaps a saison or biere de garde. Very promising. And, indeed, the flavor is dead on. There's a lot of flavor in this totally sessionable lager. It's well carbonated, and a very slight sourness brings some refreshment along with the bold grainy flavors of the rye, and the spicy clove flavors from the yeast. I would not have guessed this is a lager, though given the color and mouthfeel it makes total sense. The ABV is 4.5% which is a good thing because this thing is dangerously drinkable. Underrated and worth seeking out for fans of either roggenbier or rauchbier.","hreb","Jan 09, 2014"

The rye character shows a raw earthiness that supports the smoke flavor and aroma well- I just kinda wish there were more of it.","BEERchitect","Feb 19, 2013"

4.42,22.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Overall: If I did not know better I would think this beer was made in Bamburg. It is that good. It may be the best domestic rauch/smoked beer I have had. Love the smoke heaviness on this one. Yes I wish this was a bit higher on the rye, but anyone who likes rauches should grab this. Way better than the black from High and Mighty, and I do like that beer--especially for rauch like quality.","tigg924","Feb 24, 2012"

3.5,-3.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Taste starts with a light sweetness, goes spicy in the middle, and closes with the same medium smoke seen in the nose. Mouthfeel is a bit slick for my taste, and drinkability is pretty good. Wish there was more smoke to round it out.","ppoitras","Dec 14, 2011"
3.69,1.9,3.5,4.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Pours a light, clear straw/golden color. Has a very nice aroma of smoke. The flavor is sharp, spicey, and citrusy. It's quite complex for a easy-drinking beer. I really like the smokiness in the flavor. The spice a breadiness from the rye is also quite satisfying. This is a nice fall beer and is a break from some of the bigger, malt or hop-heavy beers that overwhelm the shelves these days. It is nicely restrained yet complex. Because it's on the weaker side, it tastes a bit watery and not as flavorful as I would like. If it were just beefed up a tad, either in mouthfeel or malt, I would like it more. This is one better cold in my opinion. As it warms, it starts to taste more like a smoked Bud to me. I will definitely come back to this when I want an easy-drinking but tasty beer. I love smoked beers, too, and this was pretty interesting.","BrewerMike","Dec 10, 2011"
