1.41,-54.5,3,2,1,1.5,1," If you can drink liquid smoke then this is the stuff. I even use smoking chips when grilling pizza and this was a drain pour after 1 sip. I always give things a couple sips or bites if it is food but it was not possible. Pure smoke, nothing else. I even tried to return it and just left the other 5 on the counter at the store it was so overpowering. Needs a warning label.","spacemoonman","Jun 30, 2012"

3.45,11.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"12 oz bottle pours a deep amber with loose head. Aroma is smokey and bready malt (toast I suppose). Smoke dominates the taste, with meaty flavors. Mouthfeel is pretty harsh campfire smokey on the back of the throat. This is okay but not something I would look for again.","coldriver","Mar 02, 2012"
3.15,1.6,3.5,3.5,3,3,3,"An alright smoked ale, some more malt depth would've really helped this. Worth a try","russpowell","Jan 04, 2012"
3.97,28.1,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Dark amber, small head of white foam, low carbonation, which works well in smoked beers in my opinion. Porky, smoky throughout. Really, it's all about the smoke. Smooth with a nice backdrop of caramel and bread crust. What else can I say, it's got a luscious open fire smokiness that carries the beer but is not overdone. Would certainly hit the mark with some smoked brisket or pork shoulder. A damn nice smoked beer.","bump8628","Nov 03, 2011"
3.68,18.7,3.5,3,4,3.5,4,"O: Quite an excellent example of rauchbier. Nice smokey layers mingling with malts and hops. A good session beer too. Strongly for anyone looking for a rauchbier at a moderate price point. Will definitely buy this again.","tsauce2","Oct 08, 2011"
3.3,6.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Overall: Infused with only a mild, blithe smokiness it may work well enough as an introductory smoke ale.","ChainGangGuy","Jul 20, 2011"

3.2,3.2,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3,"Not terrible, but certainly not exceptional. A nice try at a smoked beer, but just an average representation of the style.","plfahey","Feb 15, 2011"
3.53,13.9,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a clear, amber color. One inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of sweet malt, slight alcohol, hint of roasted malt, slight pale malt, and slight smoke. Fits the style of a smoke beer. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, strong smoke, slight pale malt, hint of roasted malt, and a hint of grain. Overall, good appearance and very drinkable.","Tone","Nov 19, 2010"
3.55,14.5,3,3,4,3.5,3.5,"D- This beer didn't really do much for me as far as a smoked beer would go. It did have enough flavor and not so much off flavor that I could drink many of these. If it was priced a little lower than what I saw on the 6pk carrier at Vince's I would pick it up.","alleykatking","Beers"
4,29,4,4,4,4,4,"Deep, scarlet red with a finger of off white foam that shrinks to a skim. Smoky bacon and hickory notes in the aroma, what's not to love? Smoked pork chops, bacon and ham all come to mind with the smoky sweet malt flavors. The underlying beer flavors are nice and are not overpowered by smoke. Medium bodied with crisp carbonation. Not as smoky as a Rauchbier but in the neighborhood. Good stuff.","biggred1","0"
