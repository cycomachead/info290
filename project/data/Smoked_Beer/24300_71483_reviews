"O: Great flavors but the rich texture really makes this beer a delight to drink."

"Despite the nasty sounding name, this is more a mocha styled porter than a smoked beer.  This is a very dry beer with the smokiness sucking any sweetness away from the tongue.  Long lasting aftertaste of dark, Baker's chocolate and bittering hop.  Good body and carbonation."
""
"When you pour this beer, it's very Dark and Black with an impressive Off White head which seems to carry on forever! In fact, pouring this one normally I couldn't fit it in my Duvel Tulip. It dissipates slowly leaving a little bit of lacing which eventually disappears completely. It's got great retention and eventually fades to a ring around the glass whilst you're enjoying this. On the nose, tonnes of peat smoke aromas, a little bit of Rye, Chocolate, Caramel and Toffee with a touch of Alcohol. I love Smoked Beers, so this made we want to put it straight down the hatch! On the palate, lots of Smoke to begin with, Rich Dark Chocolate, Toffee, Burnt Sugar and a little bit of a Citrusy finish. What an amazing, complex flavour. The Carbonation is pretty high for the style, but it was to be expected with this style and actually brings out the complexity in this brew. It's smooth and finishes Medium Dry. What a beer for Spring weather, although it's seriously smokey the other flavours in there are ridiculously balanced."
""
"Quite a tasty beer if you know what you're getting yourself into... and you should, if you read the label. Hard to say this is a ""steal"" at $4, but it's a good beer I'd definitely have again if I were in the mood for it."
"Love the mild smokiness and full flavor. Nicely done."
"Great beer if you are able to get past the ridiculously overpowering smokiness on the nose."

"While the picture shows it as a smoked stout, my bottle, bottled on 03/07/2014 states a smoked porter. Smokey slap to the face. Hints of dark chocolate, black pepper, and strong black coffee. Smells just like an ashtray as stated in the name with hints of a bitter cocoa. Good though, never knew something smelling of an ashtray could taste so good."
""
"O:  It is possible that the smoke died over the past year.  But smoke doesn't seem like something that would fade with time."
""
""

"Aroma of cocoa and licorice, smoke and leather.  Rich and bold flavor immediately hits the taste buds, smoke and espresso, cocoa, root beer, and a hint of cherry.  Lots of flavors, lots of character, very complex.  Malts are darkly toasted, no bitter roast flavor, hops are understated, but there's a good balance of sweet and bitter.  Slightly ashen dark roasted malt flavor lingers, perhaps hence the name. Full mouth feel, moderate carbonation. Alcohol strength is masked by the flavors. Very good beer."

"12 oz. bottle poured into a dimpled mug. Apparently smoked porters aren't really my thing, I love Stone, but I didn't like their smoked porter with vanilla bean, and it is highly rated. With this the pour, color, and mouth feel were fine, but I got smoked fish, and band aid in the nose, and the flavor came off like burnt band aid. I have liked almost all Evil Twin brews I have had, but this was a major disappointment, at least for me. Again, it is probably just not my style, but I think it would of went well with BBQ'ed pork as a pairing."
"Had on tap at Meadhall in Cambridge few weeks ago, served in a snifter.  Interesting stout-meets-smoke beer combination.  Good taste but probably couldn't have more than one in a sitting.  Fairly light mouthfeel for a stout.  Slightly oily.  Ashtray is a good comparison. Needs food pairings like cheese or meat, neither of which I had when I drank it."
""
"First off, the current labeling as a smoked porter is what I would call this, and as such, it works. Its the expected oil can black with a beautiful head and lace. The aroma is smoked, roast malts. The taste is a rich creamy roastyheavily smoked flavor. Like the best Rauch bier. I've had smoked porters before, but this one is American style-over the top. I'm going to seek out more evil twins. Theyhave been spectacular."

"Overall I thought this was a nice beer and a nice example of the style, giving Evil Twin's reputation and what they wrote on the label i was expecting the smokey aspect to be more intense than it was and that could be because of the age, but I have noticed age effect the smoke that much in my experience, so I'm not sure about that.  This beer had a nice drinkability, it was smooth, a little creamy, a little crisp, not too filling and the taste did a nice job of holding my attention, I think one is the perfect amount for me, anymore than that and it might start to wear on me.  What I like the most about this beer was the complexity, the cherry flavors added a nice layer of complexity to it.  What I liked the least about this beer was that the roasted malts and smoke weren't just a little stronger, I found myself wishing those aspects were more intense.  I would buy this beer again, but it isn't something I'm going to stock up on and I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of smoked beers.  All in all I was happy with this beer, it wasn't quite what I was expecting, but in the end I enjoyed it and i think it was a little unique for the style.  This isn't my favorite Evil Twin beer or my favorite Smoked Beer, it falls above the middle in both categories.  Nice job guys, this was a nice Smoked Porter, keep up the solid work."

"Dark pour with very high carbonation, producing a thick lacing that lasts throughout the tasting. Smells like burnt wood, bacon and oranges (??). Medium body, made a bit rough by the high carbonation; fruit bitterness, chocolate and dark cherries, and a moderate amount of alcohol."

"Bottle from Hop City. Pours dark black with tan head. Aroma of light smoke, chocolate, spices, and coffee. Flavor of chocolate, molasses, and smoke, with a strong booze aftertaste. Heavy bodied. It’s like drinking a boozy camp fire. Very good."

"a really decadent smoked beer here, called a porter but definitely an imperial, maybe even a stout. thought it was normal abv when opened and was shocked to read the bottle at nearly 9%. one of the better evil twin brews going, a definitely the best smoked dark beer i can remember of late. chalky finished dark brown beer, silky smooth and alluring, enticing, and all dolled up with a full inch of rich dark mocha head. the nose is a mixture of sweet and bakers chocolates with a ton of smoke on it, not the lighter cherrywood type, but proper heavy german rauch stuff, fireside smelling and balanced well with lots of special dark malts. rich caramel middle in the taste is the real surprise, never expected such a robust desserty vibe to this, i dont know why i underestimated it, but i did. love the intense chocolate without the sweetness, and the way the smoke makes everything pop without crowding out the clever malt bill in any way at all. full bodied almost syrupy texture, but i find myself drinking it too quickly. its just so smooth and flavorful and im curious for more than the one bottle i have. strong but well hidden alcohol, it drinks like dessert honestly. what makes it special is the grain, one of the best smoke beers ive had, and one i need to snag more of. really worth trying."

"Pours a black color. One inch head of a tan color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of strong smoke, roasted malt, sweet malt, alcohol, and a hint of hop. Fits the style of a Russian Imperial Stout. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of roasted malt, sweet malt, smoke, alcohol, hint of hop, hint of chocolate, and yeast. Overall, a great RIS, good appearance, aroma, body, blend, and complexity. The hops are very minimal which allows many other characteristics to shine. Particularly, the smoke, yeast, and sweet malt. The earthiness of this brew is amazing. Best taste of an ashtray I've ever had ;)"

"12 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 2/5/2014. Pours pitch black color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense dark tan head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, molasses, roasted malt, wood smoke, toast, dark bread, light char, leather, herbal, and roast/smoke earthiness. Nice aromas with solid complexity and balance of dark/roast/smoked malt notes; with good strength. Taste of dark chocolate, cocoa, toast, dark bread, molasses, coffee, wood smoke, leather, herbal, and roast/smoke earthiness. Slight roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, toast, dark bread, coffee, molasses, wood smoke, herbal, and roast/smoke earthiness on the finish for a while. Good balance and complexity of dark/roasted/smoked malt flavors; with solid robustness and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a moderately creamy, smooth, and lightly chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice smoked imperial stout. Good complexity and balance of dark/roasted/smoked malt flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. Flavors did not feel as bold as I was expecting for a 9% stout, but is a nicely enjoyable offering."

"Pours a jet black hue with a two finger chocolate head and a rim of lacing,the smell is dark berries,roasted malts and dark chocolate,the mouthfeel is full bodied with lush moderate carbonation and the tastes are dark chewy chocolate malts followed by dark fruit and finished with a soft ashy bitterness and overall not a bad drop that's worth a visit cheers."

"Not bad for a high ABV dark ale but the smoke aspect is MIA in the flavor and barely perceptible in the smell."
"O: I enjoyed this and would definitely have again. Sacrilege, but maybe...on nitro?"

""

"Poured into a chalice, a dark copper laced head that receded quickly into the dark body. Smokey on the nose but a more hearty coffee flavor on this stout defined porter. More smokey on smell but less substantial than most stouts. Acidic at first taste, yet seemingly low carbonation affected the final texture. A decent beer, but below Evil Twin name."
"Overall: A very good imperial smoked porter/stout. Good roasty malt flavors with a nice kick of smoke."
"o: a pretty good beer. it has nice sweet and smoky flavors. my criticism would be i'd like to see a little more of the toasted malts come to play to help cut the sweetness and meat-like flavors. but not a bad beer at all. if you like smoked beers, this should be a try for you. nothing overpowering, and the smoke isn't too in your face to enjoy. its 8.9%, but the mouthfeel and flavor hide any alcohol flavors - making this dangerous"
"Pours to a dark tan head that falls to a eighth-inch layer with leggy lacing that slides back down to the head. Color is what it should be. Aroma is sweet smoky bbq sauce, coffee, dark chocolate and roasted nuts. Flavor is predominantly roasted barley and smoked malt with some malty sweetness, chocolate and nuts in the finish. Mouthfeel is dense and slightly sugary, the way I like it. Carbonation is low, which is expected. Overall a fine imperial stout with a little something extra."
""
""
"The beer's malty body and sweetness supports the bold smoke character well, however I would prefer to see heavier texture, more sweetness and a deeper level of complexity, even if it comes at the risk of ten-plus percent in alcohol- oh darn!"

"A licorice black colored brew with a fair dark tan head and modest bits of lacing. The aroma is pretty big , with chewy licorice smoked malt and veggie evergreen hop. There is an ""ashy"" idea here but it comes off very nice. The flavor brings out a tart prune malt shrouded in cigar ash and leathery tobacco. There's a little bit of whole grain flavor deep down but it's hard to overcome the primary smoky theme. This is medium plus bodied porter with a fairly chewy but smooth feel with quiet carbonation. As porters go this is a big flavored brew and I can see it being a controversial one. Either really like it or really dislike it. It's easily a good one for me."
""
""

"I was very excited to try this offering as I love smoked beers especially Evil Twins The Cowboy. This stout pours very near black color with a small tan head and a small but nice lacing. The aroma is very appealing with lots of coffee and chocolate offset with a subtle smokiness and sweet vanilla. The flavor is unfortunately not as inviting. It is very one note with an avalanche of smoke and coffee. No depth at all. This is a good beer to try if you haven't had anything like it before but otherwise seek out something like Founders Smoked Porter for a much better take on this style."

"Overall another interesting brew from Evil Twin but lacks the intensity of his other works such as Lil B or Imp Biscotti. Worth a try if available simply to keep your beer palate intrigued but not one to seek out."
"Overall- Above average to good beer, closer to good. A bit of a disappointment from Evil Twin but I guess they can't all be really good. For fans of smoked beers, don't expect too much- it's a solid porter with hints of smoke but not much else. Worth a try but get some of Evil Twin's other stuff if you're undecided"

"Full bodied with a slightly creamy texture and a very intense burnt/smoke flavor.  Really overwhelming with strong acrid unpleasantness.  Everything tastes like burning!   Charred toast, burnt malt, charcoal burnt wood and ashtray.   Really strong but the phenol presence isn't as bad as expected.  It's there but not as offensive as it is in the aroma.  Still, this beer is very harsh and a chore to choke down.  I'm a huge fan of smoked beers but I didn't like this beer at all.  "

"An enjoyable beer, too bad the great aroma didn't carry over to the taste."

"11.2 ounce bottle, best before 2015. Served in a snifter, the beer pours dark brown/black with a half inch tan head that stays around for a bit. There's also a decent amount of lacing. I like the aroma a lot, the brew smells like smoked malt, chocolate, band-aids, peat, burnt/charred malt, and some coffee. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's the addition of some dark fruit and an earthy flavor. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's slick and has a good amount of carbonation. I think this is a very good brew. Although it's pricey at $8.99 a bottle, I'd buy this one again. Definitely worth a try if you like smoked stouts."

"O: There is a lot of complexity to the flavor and aroma of this beer with some really interesting aspects but it is not an easy beer to drink. The name is very appropriate as I think this beer really reminds me of an ashtray (and as a non-smoker it is slightly off-putting)>"

"Eh, a little let down. It's got it's good parts, but its nothing special as far as smoke beers go."
""
"no mention of the nearly 9% at any point, the booze is entirely hidden, good example of the style but cost a little more then I'd want to spend on a second bottle"
""
""
"Overall an interesting variant to the RIS style. The smokiness is well done and adds some complexity. Would be great with some smoked meats."
"Okay, that's the end of the notes. I didn't pick up any of the smokey or vinous nodes that people pick up once they've been informed this is supposed to be a Russian Imperial. Power of suggestion, maybe? As it stood, it wasn't really a stellar example of its purported style, but it's still a damn fine beer."
""
""
""
"Bottle at Torst. Big smoke, ash smell. But its great as I like the style. Ashtray, in the best way. Peaty, however that's in the secondary perhaps muted over time aged in a bottle. In that way, stands out from classic smoked beers.Lacy with a bit of head. Middling mouthfeel. Good drinkability."

"O: It grew on me a little toward the end, but this is one hardcore smoked beer. Absolutely not for the faint of heart. It is aptly named; it gets so smoky that it really does call to mind a full ash tray. Evil Twin went a little overboard with this one. You'll really need to love smoked beers to justify the $10 single bottle price tag and the ensuing, borderline masochistic palate stomp."
""
"Poured into an Elysian snifter. Pours pitch black with a healthy three finger medium brown head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of dark toasted malt, chocolate and peat. Flavor starts with a healthy dose of campfire smoke, developing dark toasted malt, coffee, nuts and peat. Finishes with great lingering smoke, dark toasted malt and light vanilla. Medium, creamy body. This is definitely the most complex smoke flavor I've experienced in smoked beer and although I am not a cigar smoker, the flavor does suggest the rich leathery smoke from cigars. The ashtray moniker is appropriate, but the stout gives more of a suggestion of the smoke before the stogie gets to the ashtray. Well done and very enjoyable. Evil Twin pulls off another beer that pushes the envelope and triumphs."
"Overall:really smokey but doesn't linger. Well balanced for me. A must try if you like this style."
"D - Really smoky, but oddly drinkable. The peat is intense, but not unpleasant or bandaid like as it is in so many other beers."
""
"A generally well-rendered RIS, not too sweet or boozy, but instead, of course, smoky. The effect isn't overpowering, but it does cast a spell over the proceedings - all constituent components seem to be touched by it. If you like that idea, then have at 'er. And to re-address the marketing schtick from the bottle label - placebo is just a so-so 90's indie band, man."
""
""
""
""
"D - Nice smoked stout. Good overall balance with good body and mouthfeel."
""
"Poured into a pint glass from the bottle, the stout was a murky blackish-brown with a slight layer of mocha foam. The smoke is very apparent in the aroma as it radiates the essence of smoked bacon. In the initial taste, one gets sweet bacon, smoke, glazed ham, and sweet black malt. If you are bored with the average stout, this stout sure packs a great deal of excitement. Toward the finish, one detects elements of vanilla toward the back of the tongue. If the sweetness on this stout went a little higher, this would be near perfect. In the aftertaste, a woody vanilla finish yields to a warming sensation. A nice smooth stout that leaves some of the sting of tobacco in your mouth, Ashtray Heart would make a great cold weather beer."

"Wah. Poured this at a good temperature with a massive, tan, foamy, frothy, fluffy, creamy head that settles after a bit and some lace. Color is an opaque black brown. Aroma is smoke, malt, molasses, a little red wine. Flavor is the disappointment - a little sour, I believe it's turned, and hard to get around it. Otherwise it's like nose, plenty of bitter and the sweet is offset by the sour. Body is good, I think, but again the sour leave high points that I don't think would normally be there. Finish is like flavor and I cant drink anymore."
""
""
""
"O - Eh...This was boring at best, totally opposite of the delicious and complex Biscotti Break from Evil Twin."
"O- The head is amazing with an interesting blend of smoke and malt with a bit of an odd bitterness. The black malt and roasted barley has a strong brassy flavor this gets a bit to strong as it warms."
"Dark mahogany in color.Beige thick layer froth.Good retention. Nice rings & spots. Roasted malt & slightly smoky aromas to the nose.Gentle bitterness,hints of coffee & resins.Dark fruits & molasses in the middle.Full body,soft carbonation.Kind warming ABV.Easy drinkability & complex mouthfeel."
"O: Several Evil Twin beers deep now, I'm starting to feel that these guys are talented brewers but are extreme for the sake of being extreme. After a couple of expensive purchases - and not being too thrilled with any of them - it's going to take a GREAT experience with an inexpensive draft pour to get me back as a consumer."
"O: I like this, its different for sure but don't think I will seek this out again, that's not saying I don't like evil twin."
"Purchased on a recent trip to St. Louis. Best by 2015 printed on the label. Poured from 330ml bottle into a snifter. A - Dark, with a faint tan head which quickly recedes leaving only some bubbles. S - Roasted malts with the usual chocolate and coffee notes. The smokiness comes through on the aroma. T - Roasted malts and dark chocolate with the smokiness also coming through on the taste. M - Light to medium body with little carbonation. A nice beer. I can imagine the smokiness being nice for a beer pairing with food. Not your average stout."
""
""
"Overall it's a slightly adventurous brew that I'm ultimately glad I tried, but I don't think I'd be anxious to pick it up again any time soon. Just a bit too sweet and unbalanced for my tastes."

"Based on the price, it's pretty tough for me to recommend this one. It is a solid big stout with a light to moderate amount of smoke. I do love the name though."
""
"Served from bottle into a Unibroue La Fin du Monde tulip. Poured pitch black with a minimal light tan head. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of roasted malt, charred malt, smoke, and subtle dark fruit. The flavor was of sweet malt, dark fruit, smoke, dark chocolate, and charred malt. It had a heavy feel on the palate with very low carbonation. Overall this was a pretty decent brew. If I am completely honest, I never would have guessed that this one was a RIS by smelling it or tasting it alone. Now that I know it is, some of the flavors I got make a little sense (dark fruit). While this was pretty good it was just a little too bitter for my liking with the charred malt flavor I got. Worth trying if you get the chance for sure despite this fact."
"Rich aroma is strongly smoky with undertones of coffee and molasses and a hint of caramel. It pours a deep, opaque sable with a very thick, fine-bubbled and rather persistent tan head. Smoky flavor has notes of molasses, burnt wood, fine roast coffee and licorice. Full-bodied texture is smooth and just a little fizzy. Not the best Imperial Stout I have ever had, but definitely a worthy one."
"Overall: This is what I expected and not bad at all. I don't think I could have done much more than a small pour due to the intensity."
"This was a bit of a disappointment. I think the idea was exciting; combining heavy, woody smoke with the sweet moments of a milk stout. Sadly, the execution doesn't match the brilliance of the idea."
"Bottle shared at the September iteration of the Santa Cruz tasting series. Pours black with clear red corners and a cocoa head. Peaty chocolatey aroma, sweet and moussey. Flavor is well-balanced with equal parts dark chocolate, sugary coffee and smokey meat, with a boozy bitter finish. Not a very aggressive stout, subdued overall but a good blend of flavors."
"Notes: All hype aside this is quite a good brew. We´ll see about the other offerings… Given that it rides somewhat on Mikkeller´s rep it has a tough road ahead to make a significant dent once the new distribution launch settles. The overblown pricing, despite the solid quality, will hinder the choice. It is good but not that price bracket good."
"O: The beer has some interesting flavors but isn’t one that is easy to drink with the flavors of cigar smoke."
"O - I would actually liked more smoke on this one, but not all that bad. The vinous notes detract from the beer, IMO. Not a bad RIS, but nothing great."
"Very tightly constructed and a pleasure to consume. This is prime material for a dessert beer and/or to accompany a good cigar."
"This is a different one, maybe worth trying, but the price point gets a little tough."
"Part of my smoke-fiend find in Chi-Town last week. Got some. It pours a straight onyx topped by over a finger of sienna foam. The nose comprises molasses, red wine, light maple syrup, roasted malts, smoked hickory, and a touch of chocolate syrup. Oh yeah, baby. The taste starts off with plenty of roasted malts, molasses, and dark chocolate, then moves into a woody, slightly vinous smoke, which melds with the molasses and red wine as it lingers in the finish. The wine is a bit much for me, as it detracts from the more straight-forward smoke. The body is a hefty medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly lightly chewy feel. Overall, a very nice smoked stout, one that stands apart from its ilk due to the hickory and wine characters. Good times."
"Overall -- I bought two of these, and probably won't buy any more. I will throw the second one in the cellar for a year and see if the flavor changes for the better."
"O: This is a good beer. If you like smoked stouts you will likely dig this one, but might not opt for it again."
"The aroma is excellent but the taste doesn't quite come together for me. Interesting beer but not my favorite."
"This was okay, I'll have to try another, less polarizing style from Evil Twin. I could imagine smoked beer fans loving this."
"O: An interesting, drinkable, and oddly likable beer."
"Complex, creamy and incredibly well put-together."
"Worth a try for sure. A super solid, tasty, smoked DIPS."
"A well crafted stout with well hidden alcohol, not the type of smoke I was expecting to see, however. Overall, still a great offering from Evil Twin."
