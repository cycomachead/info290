"O: Not a fan of Smoked Ales, but at least this didnâ€™t taste of ashtray, like some do."

"O- The full smoke flavor is all band-aids with no malt support or other character to give it some depth or taste. It was too harsh to finish."
"One more idea... this beer might make an interesting mixer, maybe with bourbon. The smokeyness might work well there. But by itself... next time I will pass."

"O: One and done. Not bad, but nothing I'd search for again."
"This was an $8.99, 6pack mistake. I did not make it through my first bottle. My son in law could not tolerate the deep ""surrey of wet ashes"" smell either."

"Note: I do not have a lot of smoked beers to compare this to but I assume it is average. I really have a hard time getting past the smoke flavor though. I personally do not care for this at all but was trying to rate for the category."

" If you can drink liquid smoke then this is the stuff. I even use smoking chips when grilling pizza and this was a drain pour after 1 sip. I always give things a couple sips or bites if it is food but it was not possible. Pure smoke, nothing else. I even tried to return it and just left the other 5 on the counter at the store it was so overpowering. Needs a warning label."

"12 oz bottle pours a deep amber with loose head. Aroma is smokey and bready malt (toast I suppose). Smoke dominates the taste, with meaty flavors. Mouthfeel is pretty harsh campfire smokey on the back of the throat. This is okay but not something I would look for again."
"An alright smoked ale, some more malt depth would've really helped this. Worth a try"
"Dark amber, small head of white foam, low carbonation, which works well in smoked beers in my opinion. Porky, smoky throughout. Really, it's all about the smoke. Smooth with a nice backdrop of caramel and bread crust. What else can I say, it's got a luscious open fire smokiness that carries the beer but is not overdone. Would certainly hit the mark with some smoked brisket or pork shoulder. A damn nice smoked beer."
"O: Quite an excellent example of rauchbier. Nice smokey layers mingling with malts and hops. A good session beer too. Strongly for anyone looking for a rauchbier at a moderate price point. Will definitely buy this again."
"Overall: Infused with only a mild, blithe smokiness it may work well enough as an introductory smoke ale."
"Probably a good gateway smoked brew."
"Keep this one in your back pocket for a nice, chilly fall evening..."
"Not terrible, but certainly not exceptional. A nice try at a smoked beer, but just an average representation of the style."
"Pours a clear, amber color. One inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of sweet malt, slight alcohol, hint of roasted malt, slight pale malt, and slight smoke. Fits the style of a smoke beer. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, strong smoke, slight pale malt, hint of roasted malt, and a hint of grain. Overall, good appearance and very drinkable."
"D- This beer didn't really do much for me as far as a smoked beer would go. It did have enough flavor and not so much off flavor that I could drink many of these. If it was priced a little lower than what I saw on the 6pk carrier at Vince's I would pick it up."
"Deep, scarlet red with a finger of off white foam that shrinks to a skim. Smoky bacon and hickory notes in the aroma, what's not to love? Smoked pork chops, bacon and ham all come to mind with the smoky sweet malt flavors. The underlying beer flavors are nice and are not overpowered by smoke. Medium bodied with crisp carbonation. Not as smoky as a Rauchbier but in the neighborhood. Good stuff."
