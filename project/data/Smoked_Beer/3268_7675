3.7,-3.9,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, no bottle dating. Pours clear very dark reddish brown color with a 1-2 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big chocolate, caramel, brown sugar, smoked meat, roasted malt, toast, biscuit, light coffee, light nuttiness, herbal, and toast/smoke earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance of dark/bready and smoked malt notes; with good strength. Taste of chocolate, caramel, brown sugar, toast, biscuit, smoked meat, light raisin, light coffee, light nuttiness, herbal, and toasted earthiness. No bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, caramel, brown sugar, toast, biscuit, smoked meat, light raisin, light nuttiness, herbal, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a bit. Nice balance of dark/bready malt and moderate smoked malt flavors, but lacking in robustness; zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy, smooth, and crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice smoked porter. Good balance of dark/bready malt and moderate smoked malt flavors; and very smooth to drink. Not as robust or smokey in the flavor as I had hoped for, but nicely enjoyable otherwise.","superspak","Apr 05, 2014"
3.39,-11.9,2.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.25,"OK, I’m a fan of rauch beers and porters, so maybe I was expecting too much. While there is definitely a pleasant amount of smokiness in this beer, the only characteristics of a porter present are the color and palate. Perhaps the brewing process for this beer has changed since the 2004 award or perhaps my expectations are too high; either way, this beer is mediocre at best. The fizzy, completely diminishing head detracts from the appearance (and my enjoyment) of this offering.","Ozzylizard","Mar 30, 2014"

The taste is just so full of flavor, but the smoke aroma doesn't overpower the taste when I totally thought that it was going to. I do alot of grilling and smoking of pork shoulder ribs and well anything that you might want to eat so the aroma of the smoke just keeps taking me back to my last time that I had the smoker fired up. Surprisingly , it is also very refreshing as well as smooth. As others have described it as having a meaty feel in your mouth I would agree.","gbrubq","Mar 08, 2013"

4.17,8.3,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, this beer had a huge smokey aroma though one could detect a certain sense of creaminess in the aroma. To say the least, the smell made me really want to drink this one. The appearance was a murky brownish black. There was nothing particularly exciting about the appearance. Not much in the way of head, but some thickness was apparent. The initial taste was smokey, bacony, and mildly buttery with creaminess. In other words, the beer has a little of everything that is bad for your health in it, without actually including it. At the risk of being cliché, the beer was uncommonly smooth for a porter. The mouthfeel was almost closer to a milk stout with a little less thickness. The pleasantry continues in the aftertaste with a smokey bacon note. As expected, there is little carbonation so the smokey bacon notes hang around nicely. I only bought one bottle of this at the liquor store, but will probably get a sixer next time I see it.","JohnnyHopps","Nov 04, 2012"
4.3,11.7,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"I think this drinks wonderfully and fits the bill absolutely perfectly for a smoked porter.

Smells of strong smoke (reminiscent of a wood fire:) ), hops, pale malt, slight roasted malt, and hint of sweet malt. Fits the style of an American Porter but, wood :) fit into the smoked beer category better. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of strong smoke, pale malt, hint of hops, hint of sweet malt, hint of yeast, and a hint of metallic flavor. Overall, the body is mostly smoke first, then nothing else arises. The aroma is amazing though, and in itself would make this worth a try. I wish the body could more closely match the aroma.","Tone","Oct 12, 2012"

3.91,1.6,3,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Overall I thought that this was a good beer and a good example of a Smoked Porter, both the Porter and the smoke aspects were noticeable while being nicely balanced. This beer had good drinkability, it went down pretty smooth for a smoked beer and I could see having one or two of these with some bbq ribs. What I liked most about this beer was the great balance it had and the awesome aroma, they made this beer pretty good. What I liked least about this beer was the appearance and the mouthfeel, they were both a little rough around the edges and could use some work. I would buy this beer again when looking for a smoked beer that it not too smokey, it was nicely priced, and I recommend this is as a good smoked beer for beginners. This is the third beer I have had from O'Fallon, I wasn't a big fan of their Cherry Chocolate Beer, but I liked their Black Hemp and I also liked this beer, I'll be looking for more beers from them, good job guys, this is a good and solid Smoker Porter.","StoutHunter","Jun 27, 2012"

One of those brews (this one, if you couldn't get that) pours a dark ruby-tinted black-brown topped by a half-finger of dirty off-white foam. The nose comprises roasted malts, dark chocolate powder, light coffee, and a very mild bit of hickory smoke. The taste comes across very similarly, with the smoke a bit (a very small bit) more robust, the chocolate less powdery, and a touch of molasses added for good measure. The body is a stolid medium, with a slightly-light moderate carbonation and a sorta dry finish. Overall, strictly as a porter, this was pretty good. I will say, though, as a smoked porter it's a disappointment. The smoke is far too subdued, especially considering the plethora of complimentary characteristics surrounding it. Frankly, for something labeled as ""Smoke", I was disappointed with such a relative lack thereof, but it's still a good porter on its own.","TMoney2591","Apr 05, 2011"

The flavor is once again dominated by diacetyl with the buttered popcorn flavor being complemented by some smoked malt and ham flavors. There is an earthiness in the flavor as well. Alcohol isn't all that noticeable. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with lower end carbonation and not much by way of alcohol warming. I split this bottle with 2 friends and I don't think any of us finished our pours, if that's any indication of drinkability. Really just not very good stuff.

Feel has a nice smoothness to it, but body is a little thinner than desired. Doesn't detract too much from the over all experience, because this is a pretty damn good smoked beer.

I therefore approached this beer with more than a bit of caution and the ""well, I'll try a couple of sips"" mentality. I was pleasantly surpised by how well the brewery pulled off this beer - rich porter maltyness with the smoke integrated into the malt so that it at times seemed a question of whether the flavor was deeply roasted malt or smoked malt. Far from being overpowering, the smoke was well integrated into the flavor profile. For those who like an intense smoke flavor, this beer will no doubt be a let-down, but for those who want to taste something besides beef jerky, this is quite good.","Brent","May 17, 2010"

Aromas are very pleasant - smoke (burnt wood/campfire - maybe hints of some smoked meats), some roasted malt, and some sweetness with hints of licorice and molasses. Tastes are similar to the aromas, only less complex - more smoke, some burnt malts & barley with notes of spiciness. I was expecting the complexity to come out as the ale warmed, but it didn't really change much. Mouth-feel was thin-to-medium bodied with moderate carbonation and left a tingle on the tongue.

3.95,2.6,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Pours a typical porter black with some garnet highlightsa and a modest khaki head. Nose is more subdued than I would have expected, a little disappointing, but still appetizing - light smoke, charred malt husk, old coffee. Taste mirrors the nose, with faint smoke hovering above charred-yet-still-sweet caramel malts, baker's chocolate, and old coffee grounds. Mouthfeel is on the thin side, a little watery. The sweetness is pleasant and surprising in this smoked beer. Not as much of the ""beef jerky"" character that many smoked beers possess. A crossover smoked beer for those apprehensive of the style, like I was before I had New Glarus' Smoked Rye Bock (which is great...find it!).","Golden2wenty1","Dec 29, 2005"

3.73,-3.1,4,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,"This smoked offering pours an opaque black color with a one inch tan head. Minimal lacing. Aroma is nutty and chocolatey but not the most smoky. A little lactic acid in the smell as well. Taste however has a really good dose of smoke. Starts out with some bittersweet chocolate notes and dextrin. Smoke comes and doesn't drown out the chocolate but compliments is nicely. Lots of cream and milk flavors in the body. The finish is rather acidic and cuts out the smoke and other flavors. I think this porter would be below average without the nice smoke compliment, but with it the porter moves to above average. Nice for when you need your smoke fix but not great for when you need your porter fix.","granger10","Oct 17, 2005"

That's right, the body is so thick with smoke and meat that the hops are especially complimentary. It's so dark that it makes guinness look like budweiser. The smoke tends to build up on your tongue until you are finished with the bottle to the point where that really is enough smoke. Not a session beer.

It has solid qualities of the base beer (Porter), with contributing smoke character which compliments the beer without overpowering it. The porter characteristics are heivily toasted, chocolatey, and malty with coffee tones. The smoke adds another level of complexity without offending. A good balance to a good beer.

The black cherry disappears in the flavor, but the smoke reappears in the finish and lingers for few moments after drinking. Slick, slightly oily mouth feel. Hmmm, drinakbility?

4,3.9,4,4,4,4,4," This is a very interesting porter from the brewery that brought you Blackberry Scottish Ale and Cherry Chocolate Ale. Adventurous little Missouri brewery, and they've got a nice one here. Definitely, has a Bamberg smoked malt character that makes me want another smoked beer.

I scored three bomber-sized bottles at Lucas Liquor in Overland Park (new find!). Looks and pours as a typical good porter and if you take a whiff the smoke is evident but not overpowering. The problem I had before with a different smoked beer was the overwhelming presence of smoke, like actually drinking liquid smoke. This is liked by some I'm sure, but not me. O'Fallon has the perfect balance. I can't think of a better beer to pair with a steak, BBQ, or any kind of meat from a grill. Phenomenal.","Gruntlumber","May 29, 2005"

Head fades down to an uneven layer of bubbles pretty quickly, but laces nicely. Aroma is smoke, and that's about it, not that there's anything wrong with that. Taste starts with slightly sweet dark malts, quickly giving way to the smokey parts, and ends rather slick over the tongue. Mouthfeel and drinkability are good for the style. A nice centered smoked porter, enough to make smoke aficianados not waste their time, but not so much to drive most people away.","ppoitras","Apr 07, 2005"

A little bitterness is left on the back of the tongue on the swallow. Thinnish mouthfeel. While the smokiness was interesting at the start, frankly, by the time I reached the end of the bomber, I was numb to the smoke.

3.67,-4.7,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Damn near black, if not actually black in the middle with dark brown influences, ruby highlights around the edges. The head was russet, at the apex the foam was about a half finger in height. It loudly faded to a soapy collar, wispy in the middle; the top of the liquid was almost naked in a few minutes. There was no subsequent lacing either. I like the darkness of the beer itself but aside from that the appearance is forgettable. The smokiness of the nose has some positive attributes and some negative ones. When I compare this beer to AKSP this offering has a sharper smoked smell. The woody, char is zippier. The bacon aromas are very dry. There are hints of semi-sweet chocolate and day old coffee. There is nothing wrong with the bouquet but I really wish it were more rounded and fatter. Schlenkerla forcefully smells fatty and juicy, AKSP has theses same aromas but very muted. The smells from OFallon seem lean. It clearly expresses itself as a Smoked Beer (Porter). It is smokier than Z Street but not as nasty (in a good way) as Rogue. I dont like to compare beers in reviews like this but Im trying to make a point. While the nose is inviting, the potency is moderate and the message is clear, I still wish it were heartier in the smoked aromas. The palate is mild. This is a Smoked Porter on training wheels; its a four-cylinder Yugo. I want a Hemi. I want Smoked Beers to be more forceful. I realize this beer is not a Rauchbier; Im judging it accordingly. The palate is a pleasant mix of charred hickory, day old coffee grounds, peat, semi-sweet chocolate, herbal hops with a stinging finish, and there are kisses of ham and straight smoke. The palate is pleasant enough but it is far too Porter-like for me. I need more smoke, more fatty meat, and more richness. The aftertaste is hot and incomplete, there isnt much smoke and there is far too much roasted acidity. This beer is something to kick back with at a BBQ, it is simplistic but hearty enough to stand up to grilled meats. I dont have any outright complaints; I have more of a wish list. I am disappointed in this offering. It is a tickle fuller than medium in body, the carbonation is moderate but natural, the mouthfeel is hearty and firm but it works well with the flavor profile. On the whole, this beer is easy to drink. In this case, that is not a good thing. I dont mean to harp but more smoke, more malt richness, etc and I would want to slow down, I would want to sip and savor. As is, I just want to drink it with food. It is nothing special. I have a handful more bombers to drink and enjoy, and dont let the negative tone of this review fool you, I like this beer. I will drink it with a smile! I purchased my bottles in Parkville, Missouri. It is worth a try if you DONT like Smoke Beers, this one might change your mind.","bditty187","Mar 29, 2005"

The taste was lightly smokey and quite malty with a touch of yeast, and a very light tangy flavor. The mouthfeel was smooth and relatively dry with medium body and low carbonation. The aftertaste was lightly malty and faintly smokey. This was an easy to drink and enjoyable smoked porter.

Plenty of roastiness in the nose too with just a hint of herbal hops. At first taste while cold, it seemed a bit thin, but metamorphosed into a smoky masterpiece as it warmed a few degrees. Classic porter elements are all there, lots of roastiness, a slight tartness and bitterness in the middle and back, with sweet wood smoke swirling through your mouth in all aspects of this brew.

Rich coffee beans, dark chocolate and black licorice coupled with burnt malts and smoky offerings make this a treat!

Smoke also is a huge component in the flavor. Roasted malt and chocolate add more depth. Besides that it was smoke, smoke and a hint of smoke which all finished up with a smoky sweet aftertaste.

The taste is surprisingly light considering I was expecting something more like Alaskan's smoked porter. The taste is lightly sweet, with an infused smokiness that dominates every corner of this beer. As this beer warms up and my palate becomes smoke saturated, it starts to pick up a bit more complexity, with notes of coffee, wood, and caramel. This is fairly tasty, though it is quite one dimensional, it really needs a bit more of a malty background. Basically this is like the little brother of Alaskan's smoked porter.
