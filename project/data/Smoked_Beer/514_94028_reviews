"Overall- Just above average. Can't comment about how faithful of a representation it is but I gather from reviews and ratings that it is lacking. Although if you are interested in less popular styles, you might want to try it."
"the bottom line is that we simply ned more gratzer beers on the market, this smoked wheat style from austria is unfortunately dying, if not dead, and a revival is necessary. hazy in color, pale rusty orange tint, short almost clear head. it smells camp rife smokey, with some real nice earthiness, not peaty, but hardwood smoke, its very strong, but very pleasant. the wheat malt is a nice light base for it to flavor the beer, which still somehow has quite a bit of body, so as refreshing and light as it is, its still hearty and dense in a way. full of flavor, smoke and just caramelizing white sugar, but this beer isnt sweet. its got a hop varietal i know nothing about in it, and it adds bitterness and weight without a lick of citrus or pine flavor, perfectly appropriate in this context. well carbonated and seasonally and culinarily versatile. its not the best example of the style I've ever had, but I'm not picky right now when it comes to grazter, i am just thankful."

"Pours a murky light whitish-orange with a foamy bone head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Foamy swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, smoke, earth, and sour aromas. Taste is much the same with grain, smoke, and woody flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of smoke bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a low level of carbonation with an almost flat mouthfeel. There is also something in the beer that delivers a bit of a numbing quality in the mouth after each sip. Overall, this is an above average beer with some interesting aromas and flavors, and while I respect the historical aspect of this beer I could not drink more than a few ounces."

"33cl bottle. Style is described as a Grodziskie (sour wheat beer with smoked malts - in this case oak smoked. Pours a dull, orange-gold with a loose, 1/8th inch bright white head that coalesces around the edges while leaving a soapy slick across the surface. Nose is weird - smokey and citrusy with some barley and toasted malts at the back. Taste consistent with nose; some earthy hops bittering co-mingled with smoke at the back. There are also some tea-like qualities to this beer. Mouthfeel is light and lively, somewhat acrid, with a hint of acidity that stimulates the salivary glands. Overall, I'm not really sure how to rate this style. I can't say I care for it, but I have no other style reference for comparison."
