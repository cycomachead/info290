3.56,-8,3.75,2.75,4,3.25,3.75,"Overall: OK, but I was expecting something a bit more robust. Even so, if you like your beers smoky without being a full-on rauchbier-type thing then this is worth a look. Doubly so if you like stouts and porters even if it is a bit on the thin side. Worth a try, but really needs more body, more alcohol or, ideally, more of both. My ratings reflect the nature of the beer - it's a bit all over the place but not necessarily the worse for it.","interzen","Mar 28, 2015"

Być może moje oczekiwania były zbyt wysokie w stosunku do tego piwa, a może po prostu brakuje mu jeszcze trochę.","PlutonowyManiek","Mar 17, 2015"

3.75,-3.1,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,"-- Honestly, I don’t know what to make of a British porter at 5.4%: not quite sessionable, not strong. It’s a bit thin (though maybe not the for the ABV?) and dies on the finish. They want the smoke to make it interesting but there’s not enough of it to do that. Drinkable, but ultimately dull. Wisp more than smog. 3.75","StJamesGate","Dec 02, 2014"

3.88,0.3,3.75,3.75,4,3.5,4,"Pours a hazy dark brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, smoked malt, and caramel aromas. Taste is much the same with cocoa, char, and smoke flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of smoke bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with a really nice smoke presence that comes through especially well in the taste.","UCLABrewN84","May 07, 2014"

Dry and yeasty with a well-judged bitterness. Body is alright but could be a shade thicker. Tasty; not quite on the level of a Schlenkerla but a quality effort. If smoke is your thing then this is worth a punt.","jazzyjeff13","Jan 20, 2014"
