"2.5 M&2.5 D: thin bodied though tasting smooth, the overall body is way too weak to be enjoyable, made worse by the ending sugary flavour. The palate falls short of the promise of the aroma. And if it's a smoked beer, it's a quite weak one as no substantial peatiness is present. I paid 3.2 quid for this bottle, as much as for a 3 Fonteinen Oud Geuze at the same pub! They could've saved the space in the fridge for a better beer, I think."

"Had this one in Torino, Italy. A sweet aroma with hints of whiskey and vanilla like. Also the appearance is clear red with a nice tan head, which stayed for a while on the glass. This beer tastes sweet, sweet in a strange way and too much for a beer. I dont think this should be classed as a beer. The palate, taste and aftertaste are well just too sweet and ""undrinkable"". A horrible beer."

"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was how the peat smoking grows by the end of the sip. While it is expected in the style, the flavor of robust smoke is always interesting when introduced to the palate within beer, and to this it did not disappoint. What was displeasing, however, was how overly sweet the beer was, and how any cutting bitterness that could have been was lost among it. To summate, this beer tasted like a toasted marshmallow that fell into the campfire. Edible but interesting."
"Finally taste far from extraordinary, slightly watery with just a taste a little smoky, which is still a highlight for a Rauchbier. It also collects a small taste safety with the addition of sugar and dye immondemment and unnecessarily added. Peaty malt whiskey and smoked to excess is touted commercially then you do not feel almost. It's just if you feel the beer. Caramel color and nose in the same way except that it does not come from a caramel malt but more likely a dye or an addition. So certainly it is easy to drink but taste level is nothing."

"O: Low Drinkability. Just avoid it"
"D: Unless you are already three or four sheets to the wind, this one is simply undrinkable."
"Got this can shortly after I tried it again recently in a bottle. The can, of course, has no skunk from being light struck. However it poured with a soda pop tan head that very quickly went to zero. Color is very clear medium amber. Nose is lightly smokey and malty sweet. Flavor's the same. No depth. Smokey, malty sweet soda pop beer. Body's what you expect given the above. ditto finish. Don't want any more of this. Actually preferred the bottle with skunk to this."
"D: An odd beer. Worth trying once, I suppose, but don't search too hard for it."
"D-Drinkable, but not overly appealing."
"M/D: The beer had a medium body to it. It felt sticky, but was smooth and the carbonation was about right, maybe slightly too much. Again, the sweetness of the beer really detracted from the drinkability, it could really be more like an after dinner drink/beer, but there are better."
"Overall, not a bad beer, might be only a bit too sweet."
"On a final note: I was expecting alot more peat malt character, and wasn't prepared for such a sweet brew. I was also a bit disappointed regarding the bitterness. It's an awkward beer, but i was expecting worse actually. Won't be having again."
"D - I could barely finish it."
"A terrible smell but an interesting flavor. Not anything I would like to try again because its too sweet. I think a more pronounced oak smokiness and less sugary fruit flavor would make this one a decent drink. As it is now this one should be avoided."
"I almost threw the beer in the drain. Adelscott is one of the worst beers Ive ever tried and I hope I will forget its dreadful taste as soon as possible."
"Drinkability : cette bière tire son originalité du malt à whisky, sans plus"
"d: definitely not for me; so overly smoky; i couldn't even finish it although i can say i appreciate the effort to make something unique"
"From a clear bottle that's labeled 'The Different Beer', this one pours a dull amber color with a modest but solid white head. The aroma is a little strange: There's a little charcoal (carbonized hickory?), some malt, and a bit of nearly burned sugar. A little faint, but an interesting and noteworthy smell. The taste is way too sweet. It's an artificial, very sugary sweetness that didn't do anything for me at all. It's like liquid candy. There's nothing to balance the sugar, and it was simply too much over the top. The body is actually a bit thin. It's an interesting brew, although not well put-together. It's worth a try, but it's not something that I'd ever grab again."
"The ABV is 5.8%"
"Sampled in Siena, Italy after the palio. Bottle. A very nice appearence with some shine. Transparent and ruby copper. No head. Aroma is soft and sticky. Whiskey comes through well in the bouquet. Whiskey adds a great deal of the flavour, but not great enough, very meek. Texture is nice too, coats the mouth. Could use more malt in the flavour, but generally is well, kinda, tasty! I didn't mind this one at all. It was unmistakingly macro-ish, but allbeit agreeable."
"bottle poured a light copper beer into the glass, small, fast to vanish cap...aggressive carbonation. Sweetness over some smokey tones in the aroma..had ""dutch skunk"" possibly from the clear bottle. Sweet and bland with liquid smoke type flavor...cheap and processed flavor and character. Will not be revisiting this one."
"Pours an orange color with a nice white head. Smells strongly of peated malt, very smokey. Taste has a nice peat smokey flavor with a slight hint of hops. The mouthfeel is good, with just the right level of carbination for this beer. A good smoked beer."
"Except for the head, Adelscott sure looks like scotch, with a crystal clear orange-copper color, but it really doesn't have much in the way of a scotch aroma. There is a caramel sweetness followed by a noticeable peat smoke aftertaste. Altogether it's not an unpleasant flavor combination, but it is a little odd. Doubtless the people at Fischer felt the peatiness needed all that sugar to bring things back into balance."
"Now, as for exact taste details, I fortunately remember very little. I do remember however, coming up with a representation that could perhaps portray the horribleness that cost me 6 euros. This beer tasted as if one took a run of the mill brown ale(on the malty side), added a wee bit of scotch, then aged it in some French bog workers old boot for about a year. A nice pungent leathery taste evened out with sourness one would expect from foot bacteria. MMMM!!! If you see this brew, I recommend you try it; it really puts beer in perspective. Excuse my French"
"The Alsatian brewery Fischer tries to produce foreign beers: Adelscott is a beer brewed with whisky malt, but made in Strasbourg, France (Desperados is a tequila flavored beer that tries to sound Mexican but thats produced in Strasbourg, France too, but thats a different story). The soft head lasted longer than I expected and looked actually quite nice on the orange color body. The smell was quite interesting; very malty and earthy, with nice notes of smoke, some smoked bacon (hmmm), some pleasant cow dung/ barn notes and some fresh-cut grass. I appreciated the taste less than the smell. Still malty, sweet, earthy, fresh and smoky. But, whereas after the first sip youre like this is innovative (the label says Adelscott, the different beer), after a while I thought this is getting boring. My pint was hard to finish. Mouthfeel is round and a bit creamu, quite smooth, but a bit weak, close to being watery. Still, I don't regret the fact that I bought this beer."
"I am very glad I was able to buy a single of this one, and as it was I only took 2 sips before throwing the rest out. The first was to taste, the second was because I couldn't believe how bad it tasted. If I had to sum it up in one word, that word would be ghastly."
"The ingredients listed are: water, malt, maize, whisky malt, sugar, aromatic compound, caramel, hops, ascorbic acid. So, quite a bit of adjuncts and a mysterious sounding ""aromatic compound"". This is probably why it has that artificial aftertaste."
"50cl can: An amber/brown color with a bit of a head. What is that smell? God, was it fairly sweet. There was a muskiness to it also. Kind of like ripe old socks. I really wasnt sure what the taste is. I dont think they put bad whiskey in there, or did they? I thought that maybe they used a different barley malt that would have made it into scotch, but I cant figure out what they did. Hopefully they wont do it much longer."
"I kind of wondered what kind of beer this was, as the label was in French. I guess ""whisky"" means the same thing in both languages. Clear pale brown color with a thin light tan head. Very little lacing. The aroma is a perplexing mixture of smoke, alcohol and sweet caramel. The flavor can best be described as charred malt and bile. I could barely get down a mouthful of this stuff. Maybe the clear bottle is to blame, or maybe this is just a horrid beer. The finish is nasty and had me burping smoke flavor the rest of the evening. Truly an awful experience."
"Little to no bitterness to speak of, rather sweet, which reminds me of a a Belgian of course. This also reminds of Islay Darkest. Caramel is present as is the alcohol."
"Dark toned, slight malty nose. rather provocative. The taste as Ive said is nice and the finishing bitterness, slight but adequately proportionate to the abundance of taste. Ok to try."
"An excellent smoke beer brewed with peat malt. This stuff is a dark amber in colour with no head to be found. The aromas are all smoke, heavy malts, and alcohol. The taste is very smoky and malty, with no booze to be found. The mouthfeel is thin and watery, and the drinkability is not the best..."
"Medium body with medium-high carbonation. Very different from your average beer and certainly not for everybody. I liked it though."
"One of the most unusual (odd) brews around. Peat smoked whiskey malt gives this beer a hint of a single malt. Foggy Amber/Brown in color with a full body. Medium hops are hidden in the smoke. Smoky in aroma. A rapidly dissipating head leaves a trace of lace. Akin to licking the inside of a chimney... but in a good way. Roll the bottle gently before opening to dislodge any bit and particles if you dare."
"I usually don't like sweet beers, and this is no exception. This beer is very sweet, made from a form of peat malt.  Almost slimey mouthfeel. Perhaps I had a bad bottle. Will sample again when I get the chance."
