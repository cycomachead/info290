3.88,2.1,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Half a finger white head, clear light orangish amber body, a few streams of bubbles rising to surface, good lacing. Mild smoke aromas, a bit sweet balanced by floral hops, pretty subtle smoke-wise. The smoke comes through taste wise, beechwood predominates, fairly sweet, complex smokiness though no ashtray, nicely balanced. Mouthfeel is medium decent effervescence. Along with Caldera Ur Bock, one of the PNW better smoked beers, though this is harder than hell to find. Worth a try.","jdense","Nov 27, 2011"

4.19,10.3,3.5,4.5,4,4,4.5," This smoked ale has a good malt body with light woody notes and a nice smokiness which gives a nice complimet to the slight piney element from the hops which also seem to go well with the yeast which is mildly fruity. There is a subtle caramel and wood synergy that brings the smoke forward on the palate, yet doesn't go to far either. I really enjoy how it doesn't get too sweet either. Overall I was impressed by this since it is obviously a Northwest version of a classic rauchbier it doesn't stick the style completely-Rogue puts its own stamp on the style and it is very pleasing to my palate with just the right amount of smoke flavor.","Slatetank","Oct 17, 2011"

3.65,-3.9,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"The smokiness on the flavor is unique...almost cedary, maybe the beechwood gives it that characteristic. Hops are definitely in here more than most smoked beers. Flavor is woody and the malts caramely, a touch toasty and certainly sweet. Unique take on the style with the dose of saaz and I am not quite sure the combo is my cup o' tea. I like it more than most Rogue beers, but far from my favorite rauchbier.","twiggamortis420","Feb 24, 2010"
3.77,-0.8,3.5,4,4,3,3.5,"Rogue Smoke Ale is a slightly hazy amber ale with a small white head that mostly dissipates and leaves solid lacing on the glass. It has a smokey, slightly sweet aroma with a peaty note. There's something like beef jerky in the nose. It's pretty light bodied and crisp, with a finish that's kind of sharp. Yeah it's smokey-- almost like barbeque. There's a tartness from the malt and a spicy bitterness going on too, so it's not just the smoke going on. It's a nice blend of flavors and it's well balanced. It's an interesting and engaging beer.","yesyouam","Feb 06, 2010"

4,5.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured a orangeish body with a good head that died slowly and left some lace. A mix of light smokey/meatiness and hints of sweet (caramel) malt as well. Real smooth, semi-creamy even with a medium body that passes not only with some meat/smokiness (even woody) but with some sweetness and then finishes clean with a minor hoppy bitterness backbite. A real pleasant beer that is enjoyable and distinct with the different and balanced feels to it. Glad I got to try it.","clayrock81","Dec 15, 2009"

4.3,13.2,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Finally, every other place was out of this. Poured clear amber-brown with a minimal white head. Rich smoked wood and bacon nose. It smells like a just-lit campfire with a solid hop backing. Creamy mouthfeel with a long finish. Taste is just what I want with my smoke ales: STRONG smoke. Hearty, peaty, oaked, and hopped. Some balance with the malt. Spicy hop finish. Incredible. Its like a Aecht Schlerenka in ale form. I could drink this all night.","magictrokini","Nov 20, 2009"

4.57,20.3,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"D- For me, through the roof. I love a good smoked beer, and Rogue has brought its heavy guns to this battle. I am impressed, and find this to be almost an equal to the Schlenkerla beers, which is about the highest compliment I can pay any smoked beer. Seek this one out, cherish it, and bathe in it if you must. A world-class beer.","ShogoKawada","Oct 23, 2009"
4.18,10,4,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"As far as smoke beers go, this one is pretty damn tasty. The smoke isnt overwhelming but one can certainly taste it. I was hoping to have a little more smoke in the nose, though. Finishes dry which I think complements the smokiness. Long bitterness in the plentiful finish. A sure winner in the smoke department.","SaCkErZ9","Oct 13, 2009"
3.68,-3.2,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"I had this on tap at the Rogues Ale House in San Francisco, pint glass. The beer is somewhat dark, brown and hazy with a thin white film of foam on top. The aroma was smoky but not as strong as I'd expected or hoped, more like a Schlenkerla beer dialed down to 75% intensity. Along with the salami smokiness I guess I'd say this was more malty than hoppy, somewhat sweet or toasted malts. The taste was similar, toasted malts with enough smoked flavor to keep you happy (if you like that style of beer), I can't say I tasted much of the hops which I expected based on Rogue's decription of the beer. Anyway this is a good smoke beer, I like it enough that I'll look for it in bottles sometime at home.","TurdFurgison","Oct 07, 2009"

Taste is of toasted malts up front, pale malts mixed with smoked flavoring take the middle with the malts at the forefront, finish is slightly sweet.

Yes the almost meaty smokiness and woodiness is here but seems a bit washed out, slightly sweet and again a slight citric hop bitterness. In fact the more I sip on this the less smokey it seems. At this point I can't really tell what I want, more smoke or more unaltered malt and hop flavors. Being s smoked beer I want more smoke and am not getting it right now. I like some things that are going on here, it is very well balanced has a good, solid mouthfeel and has a solid flavor profile, but the lack of a higher smoke content leaves me wanted just a bit more. Not a bad beer, but not something that I would drop nearly 7 dollars on, on a regular basis.

Lots of smokey wood qualities. Plus tpasty looking malts, but just smell smokey. The taste is a bit cloying. This 22oz bomber would go very well with a smoked pork entree of pulled pork and baby back ribs ...(BBQ sauce). The smoked wood dominates the palate. No hops seem to contribute to the flavor in any significant way. Hints of toasty malts and a little clove sweetmness lingers around the whole palate.

The smoke is strong, but not offensive, and the sweetness is just right for me. I like it. Flavor is also dominated by smokey flavors. Again, the smoke is very nicely sweet, with a definate caramel base behind it. Before swallowing hte beer, it has an edge to the smoke, but then after swallowing it, the sweetness really takes hold. The aftertaste has the smoke fading a bit, with the caramel sweetness coming in more. I think this is a pretty nice smoked beer. Mouthfeel is moderate to thick, with a nice moderate carbonation. It is a little dry on the finish, seeming to pull the moisture from my tongue. I'd rather the dryness not be there. Overall, I think this one is definately drinkable.

The smell was malty, a bit sweet, and full of smoke, which was a good sweet BBQ type of smoke. The taste starts with a sweet malt flavor with a trace of hops then the smoke hits you. The smoke flavor is not as overwhelming as I was afraid it might be, it was perfect. The mouthfeel was about in the medium range, somewhat lighter than I thought it would be, with adequate carbonation. At first taste I was not sure if this was going to be a very drinkable beer with the smoke taste. I found that as I became accustomed to the smoke it became much more drinkable. However this would not be my choice for a session beer, it's more of a drink with a meal beer. I would really like to have this with some slow smoked ribs or maybe even some smoked salmon.","gpackin","May 08, 2006"

Nice aroma, plums and an appetizing applewood kind of smoke, though there are elements of musty thicker-barked wood. Light mouthfeel, carbonation is fairly high, overall a nice body (though I personally would like it to be a bit fuller). Easy drinker here, mainly a neutral malt with an apparent smokiness but nothing that is at overwhelming. Aftertaste is pleasant, a continuing ""campfire"" sense that becomes more pronounced on warming. Hops also become more evident at the close, though to me, it might have been interesting to see how an even higher hop level added to the complexity (though mainly for my own entertainment). Still, I would recommend this one to someone looking for a nice and relatively accessible Smoked beer.","ADR","Mar 22, 2006"

Anyway, a solid and well rounded smoke and hop aroma was instantly displayed. Dark amber to brown with a light haze. Virtually no carboation detected. Rich malt and smoke flavors on a moderate body makes the smoke more apparant. Texture is smooth and lightly rich. Thin and light body, partly due to the lack of carbonation.

Rather nice, I must say. The mouthfeel was a bit on the light side, but still respectable enough to rise above many others.

O'Fallon's Smoked Porter was so-so, in my opinion, and this one is probably a step down from that. I wouldn't be so dissapointed if I wasn't expecting the high quality I usually get from Rogue.

All in all, I like this beer very much, but I'd like to see it coming in a smaller bottle, 500ml at most or even better 330ml, for, although this beer's aroma is consistently pleasant, the complexity of its taste cannot sustain long enough for more than two half-pints and still remain interesting to me.","wl0307","Jun 16, 2005"

Some sweet malts at first and then the smoke flavour kicks in on the first sip. The smokiness continues for a little while and eventually gives way to the hoppy finish which lingers pleasantly. The smokiness is just right for me. Very lovely. The mouthfeel is a little thin and carbonated for me. I prefer this to some of the German rauchbiers which are a less subtle I find.

This cap quickly turned into a collar, naked in the middle. There is no subsequent lacing. The appearance is pleasant but far from stellar. The nose is raunchier than I thought it would be, which is a great thing! My experiences with Smoke Ale lead me to believe otherwise. It is not Schlenkerla Urbock but what is? The bouquet has all the desired aromas like fatty bacon, charred wood resting at a campfire, hammy too. A pleasant surprise! The potency is solid; while it is not vibrant it is plenty healthy. I find it inviting. The bouquet had me thinking Raunch and not Rogue. I damn near forgot who brewed this and then I tasted it. Hops. Big, bright, American hops the fingerprints of Rogue. Please dont misinterpret, this is a damn tasty beer. Lovely stuff. It is just not a Raunchbier nor is like any Smoke Ale Ive tasted before. It is uniquely Rogue. With that said, the palate starts off with some fatty, hammy, charred woody flavors. None of these tastes are that loud and I am not wowed by the intensity. Again, I wasnt expecting to be. Still I can taste these qualities clearly. That is nice. True maltiness is never detected; I bet this beer would be considerably better with a maltier backbone. Depth is needed. In the middle the hops kick in, citrusy, bitter, kind of brash as they now stand above the initial flavors. By the finish the hoppiness dominates until the aftertaste, which is a nice mix of smoke, fat, and citrus. That might sound odd but it works. Yummy! Medium in body but it seems a tickle too thin, the carbonation is moderate, and overall the mouthfeel is decent. I found this beer to be very tasty. The hoppiness works well with the traditional smoked qualities. This beer would really kick ass with some tangy BBQ.

A masterful balance of smoke flavors that enhances rather than overpowers the malt. The aroma is a faint, not-quite hickory smoke. The smoke flavors are well integrated, and there was a subtle, sort of barn-yard funkyness lurking in the depths that gave the beer an almost dry-cured country ham flavor. An interesting beer, and, while not something I would want a lot of at a sitting, it was surpisingly drinkable.","Brent","Apr 12, 2004"

The smoke taste is there and lingers in my mouth but it does not overwhelm. Hops are quite spicy and mix excellently with the smoked malt. Other German aspects are there creating a smooth and creamy body. Alcohol becomes more of a precense the warmer the beer gets. Body was on the light side which made drinking this way too easy.

Reminds me of a smoked cheddar cheese i had once. but there is a background of hops and malts definately, with a small lemon hint. Taste is smokey also, although in a more subdued manner than the smell. The malt is evident, and a finish of hops pushes through at the end. There is also a starchy grass taste to it as well.

Becomes slightly cloudy on last pour, and white sediment settles on the bottom of the glass. Aroma is moderately malty with some graininess and caramel notes. Hops are also moderate on the notes with citrus notes. Not surprisingly, theres a definite smoke aroma that is also apparent. Great malty start with slight caramel noticeable. The malt character continues to be present throughout. Smoke flavor comes in towards the middle and lasts through the aftertaste. The smoke flavors meld quite well with the hop finish that nicely balances out the brew. Slight roasted notes are also apparent. The smoke notes seem to pick up more as the brew warms. I really enjoyed this brew. Enough smoked flavor to make sure you know its there, but not enough to become overbearing and make you loose sight of the well balanced malt and hop character of the brew. Too bad its not more readily available.","byrd","Jan 16, 2004"

This beer tastes like smoked cheese, and I love it. Bacon fat and smoked cheese rule the tongue, with some hops trying to work their way into the picture, balancing things out. This is by far the ""Smokiest"" beer I have had. Mouthfeel is carbonated and slick at the same time, going down way easy. Immensly drinkable, but I imagine this is a ""hit or miss"" type beer.

Nice carmel malt sweetness lies underneath with a bitter snappy hop finish. Fairly dry finish, but some hop bitterness and smoke lingers enough for your tastebuds to crave another taste. Medium to light bodied. Flavors are bold, but balanced. Smokiness is not overly played. Bottom of the glass yeilds hints of peat and smokiness akin to an Islay Scotch Whiskey without the heat. Paired this with an oven roasted hickory smoked turkey and swiss sandwich and the exhaust fumes of the Brickyard 400. Perfect Match !

Medium bodied and smooth with a slightly dry finish. Flavor is nice blend of the smoked malts with a generous dose of hops bittering nicely but not overbearing.

3.86,1.6,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Pellucid light ruby hue. Fluffy vanilla white persistent head leaves loose foam trails. Mellow smoked malt and understated toasty Munich upfront in aroma, followed by medium lovibond caramel sweetness and subtle, red currant fruitiness. Overshadowed spicy hop nose. Surprisingly tame, but pleasant aromawise. A combination of caramel malt and dextrin sweetness hits the palate initially, then is contrasted by rounded, lingering smoke and moderate hop bitterness. Melanoidin tinged, grainy Munich malt undertone adds depth in malt character. Hint of grassy hop flavor adds a token noble presence. Moderate in body, but heavily dextrinous and approaching oily in mouthfeel, from the copious use of caramel malts. Plenty of residual dextrins, but not quite proteinaceous enough. As the beer breathes, smoked malt, although not overbearing, begins to envelope the palate. Finishes oily, smokey and lightly bitter. Almost a great smoked beer. It doesn't possess the depth or crispness of malt character demonstrated by Schlenkerla lagers, and the smoke character is almost peated like in nature. Rogue Smoke is nonetheless a unique, flavorful and enjoyable brew that I would readily drink again.","marc77","Apr 06, 2003"

The aroma is quite astonishing and reminds me of my favorite smoked beer, the Alaskan Smoked Porter (also by John Maier). I guess that's the Alderwood. But there's also some sweet malt there that's just as inviting. The body is medium/light and quite smooth in the mouth as there's only a limited carbonation. The flavor starts with a rich and sweet Munich and caramel maltiness but soon gives way to smokiness. Very nice! The bitterness rises in the finish along with a palate coating smokiness. The Beechwood flavor is noticeable. Very well done with lots of smoke flavor, but not overly aggressive and cloying.

Pours a wood brown to amber color with a very slight haze, topped with a cream-colored head that stays very well in the 2-3 cm range.  A few splotches cling to the glass as it goes down.  Great smoked aroma, of course.  Reminds me of a barbecue.  Maltiness is detectable under this.  However, the aroma is not nearly as strong as it was in my aged sample.  In the flavor, the smoke is much more subtle than I expected.  Instead, a targeted and crisp rind-like hop bite takes center stage.  Caramel malt is detectable just under this, and is more evenly distributed on the palate than the hop character.  Gives a good balance between the two.  Much better body than my last sample.  Smoke is more present with retro-olfaction, and in the aftertaste.  Although I expected more smoke, it's a good effort overall.  Soothing, warming, and satisfying.","hyuga","Oct 07, 2002"
