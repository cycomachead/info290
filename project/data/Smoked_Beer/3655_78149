3.63,3.1,,,,,,"O: On paper this is perhaps the most ridiculous combination of flavors I've ever heard. In execution it works about as well as it could though. The balance is on point and it's subtle where it needs to be (which is pretty much everywhere). It's actually a pretty decent brew, all things considered. An interesting slice of history to be sure, but I don't expect this to ever take off as a style.","ryan1788a5","Aug 11, 2014"

3.13,-11.1,3.5,3,3.25,3,3,"Beer is of medium-light body, with carbonation of medium-low intensity, resulting in a smooth, slightly foamy, slightly watery mouthfeel. Closes dry, with little stickiness remaining on the palate or lips.","falloutsnow","Jun 24, 2013"
3.2,-9.1,3,3,3,4,3.5,"Bottle  Appearance: Transparent, gold with minimal white head  Aroma: Smoke, honey  Taste: Very subdued; slight smoke, very minimal sourness, light honey  Palate: Very smooth, light body. Slight, cleansing aftertaste  Overall: Very subtle flavors; had a hard time discerning the different flavors, picking up the smoke, etc. Still a good, easy drinking beer.","icehawk","Jan 07, 2013"
3.76,6.8,3.5,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,"Poured into a weizen glass. The beer pours slightly hazy orangish copper with a thin, white head. There are plenty of visible tiny bubbles rising in the beer. The beer smells of light smoke with some wheat and light tartness. The mild smokiness and tartness carries over into the flavor. The sour flavor is very mild, so it would not be off putting for a beginner. The smoke follows the same pattern here, adding flavor rather than being overpowering. There's a good malt backbone here as well. The body is light to medium with moderate carbonation. Some of the smokiness and aftertaste carry into the finish. The beer drinks pretty easily, which I would expect at 4% ABV. This is a tasty beer.","acevenom","Dec 31, 2012"

3.53,0.3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"500 ml bottle. Pours hazy-orange with a long lasting, tall, white head and lively carbonation. Nose is of barnyard yeast, wheat malt hints of noble hops and smoke. Body is medium and tangy. Taste is sour, yeasty, wheat malt, smoked wood and hints of hops. Finish is long and sour. Interesting, refreshing thirst quencher.","mikeg67","0"

3.3,-6.3,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Served from tap into a sampler imperial pint. Poured a hazy golden light yellow with a two finger white head that subsided to a half finger slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, tart, subtle smoke, sour, wheat, and fruit. The flavor was of sweet malt, wheat, smoke, and subtle fruit. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a fairly decent brew. I really don't know what this brew was trying to be if I am completely honest here. It looked like a Berliner and the smoke gave me the idea that maybe it was a smoked Berliner. However, something on the flavor was just offputting here. While there wasn't very much going on with it all of it just seemed to clash on your tongue with no regard for safety. The wheat on this one was definitely overpowering the entire thing including the smoke which I found hard to believe. Not sure if I would have this one again given other options, but worth trying at least once I suppose.","thagr81us","Jun 02, 2012"
3.03,-13.9,4,3.5,2.5,3.5,3,"The pour is a pale golden color with only a slight haze. Starts off with lots of wheat aroma and sweet malt/bread. After that, the smoke really comes through and there is a subtle lemony tartness. The flavor is just off. It’s quite smokey but also very watery. Might have a little bit of saltiness to it as well. Just a strange beer.","womencantsail","Apr 06, 2012"
4.2,19.3,4,4,4.5,4,4,"My overall impression though is that I like it. The low abv and unique flavor profile is appealing and I can see this being great with food. I would put it up against any potato dumplings, or bread dumplings, saurkraut definitely and maybe some baurenwurst, smoked farmers sausage....pretty much any German dish...","MusicaleMike","Apr 06, 2012"

3.53,0.3,3.5,3,3.5,4,4,"Pours a deep thick yellow, with white topping foam head. Mild cheese and yeast aroma. Smooth mouthfeel. Takes getting used to, mostly getting yeast, not that smokey, pleasant and complex with some bitterness and mild sourness, something I can sip over the course of a night.Good with cheese.","Sammy","Feb 25, 2012"

3.76,6.8,4,3,4,4,4,"I'd say that this was an interesting, reasonably priced beer, but it's lacking in the dry/tartness that I prefer in a sour. I'd like to see more beers like this because it's really got some potential.","ThePorterSorter","0"
