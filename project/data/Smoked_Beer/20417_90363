3.68,0.8,3.5,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.75,"how delightful, this smoked wheat brew from white birch. leaps and bounds better than their berliner, but just as creative, i love this. its a pale orange color, not a ton of head or carbonation, but such a light body it really doesnt miss it. sessionable flavorful beer is in, and this is one of a kind, also superior to other examples of the style I've had. a medium smoke on the nose, cherrywood malt, maybe some more heavy rauch type stuff, but in small doses. the wheat is fresh and well modified, the beer is dry, refreshing. i liked this as a companion to spicy grilled sausage. the lightness cut the spice, while the two smoke profiles played off one another very well, improving the overall experience of both. light enough to drink a ton of, flavorful enough not to get bored, and very nicely reserved on the smoke, it isn't over done at all. one of those beers i wish was available, not that i would drink it everyday, but the colorado market really has no substitute for something like this, and with our penchant as a state for grilling and drinking, we need a beer like this. stoked for claystation to have shared his only bottle with me.","StonedTrippin","May 17, 2014"

Very happy with this beer and I will have it again. With rich live goodies in the bottle bottom, unique, delicious and fun.","melitameister","Apr 28, 2014"

3.83,4.9,4,4,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Poured a cloudy orange body with fluffy head and a smokey and spicy aroma that gives off some citric/lemon and pepper bite and a little bit of meatiness that one expects with a smoke beer. Thin bodied and smooth, easy to drink, the sharp wit notes of citric bitterness and spice come through as does a very noticeable smoked edge and the two flavor profiles balance with each other to create a good beer without one dominant personality. However, the charateristics of the beer do not stand out too much and there really isn't anything to this beer that I could say is great or would recommend to someone. Not a bad beer and a worty effort but not my favorite.","clayrock81","Jul 09, 2013"
4.16,14,2.75,4.75,4.25,3.5,4,"The beer pours a murky, caramel orange with a fizzy head on top that sizzles away to nothing but a scrim. In body the beer is dark and murky, but clean of particles, giving the beer a cloudy amber hue. On the nose, this beer is all about the smoked malts. Big, woodsy and sweet with notes of wood smoked bacon and pork. There is a creaminess to the smell that blends beautifully with the smoke and accentuates it, suggesting light butter and very light caramel malt. The smell is rich and smoky, and though it is a little one-noted with the smoke, there is ample complexity within the smoke. On the tongue, the beer tastes richly smoky sweet with a light acidic pop. Meaty salt notes also swim over the tongue. In flavor, the beer begins with a huge burst of smoky beechwood, bacon, and smoked pork. This beer then takes towards bright citrus, almost like lemon juice. Caramel malts, like what you would find in a malty amber ale, do appear on the tongue in the middle of the sip, but are then blended with spicy hop note and then the smoke returns in the finish, giving lovely woody notes alongside the richer, meaty notes. The end of the finish is a little weak and watery, finally showing the beer’s 3.8%, but up until that point I could not have guessed the beer’s weak ABV. The aftertaste is slightly chary, and metallic, but is mostly the nice smoked malt. In the mouth, the beer feels light in body, yet slightly chewy in mouthfeel. Carbonation is fierce and scrubbing, which makes it easy to drink lots of the beer, but is a little too fierce for my taste. Overall, this is a weird and unique beer. The smoked malts are rich and tasty, and pack a ton of flavor into this little beer, and the caramel malt provides a light secondary flavor. The finish is watery, however, which might be due to the style, and definitely makes this beer drinkable in large quantities, but leaves me wanting a little more weight in my mouth. This is a great beer and I am excited to see the style revived.","Maxwell","Jun 24, 2013"

4.43,21.4,4.5,4,4.5,5,4.5,"This is my first beer from White Birch, as well as my first grodziskie, and I have to say I couldn't be happier. I love smoked beers, so when I saw we got this at my local shop, I had to pick it up. For $6/bomber too, how could I go wrong? Big kudos to White Birch, this was exactly what I needed tonight.","BMoldy","Feb 28, 2013"
4.3,17.8,3.75,4.25,4.5,4,4.25,"The taste is a bit more forward that the invitational aroma with a much more full wheat and smoke flavor and a low but mellow bitterness at the end. I could drink this style a hundred times and White Birch really pulls it off wonderfully. It's a 3.8% ABV beer but it feels heavier than that.","puboflyons","Feb 22, 2013"

3.93,7.7,3.75,3.75,4,4,4,"Pours a hazy medium to deep golden color with a small but long lasting fluffy white head. Smells of smoky campfire with a spicy edge to it and sweet lightly fruity malt backbone hidden deep under the smoldering embers. The flavor is smoked meat up front with a solid shot of earthy hop bite to it. Sweet and spicy malts play together midway through before leaving a smokey almost tart fruit finish. The charred wood lingers on my salivating palette long after each sip. Light to medium body with a moderate to high level of carbonation and a smokey sticky phenolic mouthfeel. This is definitely different, but I enjoyed the hell of this beer. Light and smokey with light fruitiness, it works for me.","johnnnniee","0"
