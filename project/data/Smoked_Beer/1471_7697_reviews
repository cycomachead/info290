"O: the smoke is very suibtle in this beer and well balanced by the other elements."

"Simply the blackest beer I have ever seen!  If you liquified charcoal briquettes, it might not be this black.  Minimal rust brown head.  Smells of smoke amd roasted malts.  A very good balance between the smoke and the sweetish malt base.  Some lite coffee and  dark chocolate undertones.  Thick mouthfeel and a surprisingly light aftertaste.  A great Smoked Ale and a very good Stout."

"Deep dark brown in color.  Nice blend of roast and smoke on the nose. The smoke does not get out of control yet it outpaces the roasted malts in the flavor profile.  There is a healthy body with a little creaminess."
""
""
"Far too smoky for my palette.  It was a good take on the style but just a bit too smoky in taste and nose.  Not one I would try again."

"12oz bottle poured into stout snifter. Opaque black with just a hint of brown at the stem of the glass. A one-finger brown head forms and slowly falls to a ring. No lacing. The aroma features smoked malt, roasted coffee, bakers chocolate, and molasses. Overall, the nose is mild and the smoke, specifically, is subtle. Fore’s taste follows the nose with a slight roasted malt, molasses, and chocolate sweetness followed by coffee and char bitterness. The smoke comes faintly on the finish. Medium body, creamy texture, moderate carbonation, and a long bitter finish with some smoke."

"A solid, somewhat boozy stout.  The smoke flavor is very subtle, with just a hint of smoke coming through for me.   The smoke is clearer in the smell than the taste.   I think that's a good thing.  A little sweetness, and a nice earthy flavor.  A little raisin and licorice flavor is in this brew.  An interesting and unique stout.  I enjoy it enough that I buy two or three 4-packs every time it comes in season."

"Nice smoky flavor with very little after taste.  Another winner from Dark Horse !"

"Run of the mill craft stout"
""
""
""
"Eventually, the peat influence permeates its way throughout; before all is said and done you're sure to be smelling a trace of composting vegetal matter alongside all those acrid and smoky coffee beans. It's subtle enough to be unnoticed or ignored if desired to but for me, as a lover of Islay scotches as well as strong stouts, it's what makes this one come out on top. Loved it."

"This was the first beer I chose on my 21st. It was great in flavor and smooth body. I was not disappointed"
""
"Pours black with a brown head. Aroma of coffee, espresso, chocolate, roast and little bit smoke. Aroma is more chocolate, very light smoked, coffee, low body. Good stuff, not special."
""
""
""
"Really like how the smoke is done in this - doesn't overpower but compliments very well"
""
"Overall: A good affordable go-to when you just gotta have smoked stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Medium to full bodied with modest carbonation. There is a light smoked malt aftertaste, Very easy to drink. Worth buying again for sure."

"I was anxious to begin and gave it a pretty heavy-handed pour before sitting back to watch the pseudo-cascade. It settled pretty quickly into two fingers of deep-tan/light-brown head, but what happened next was particularly remarkable. It seemed to collapse inwardly on itself and fell much more quickly than I expected, becoming mere wisps. Color was Opaque Black (SRM = 44), allowing zero light penetration. Nose was very smoky, but in more of a burnt charcoal way than the smokiness of a rauchbier. Mouthfeel was medium. The taste was more like bittersweet chocolate mingled with a sweet smokiness. It kind of put me in mind of chocolate-covered bacon, which I have tried. I am a fan of smoked beers, but this was a bit sweeter than I like, especially since it seemed to be getting in the way of the smokiness. Finish had that same bittersweet smokiness that I had been getting throughout. I was really kind of underwhelmed, especially given the hype and scores assigned to this beer. Not bad, per se, but leaving a lot of room for improvement."

"O: This is kind of one note. The smoke is smothering anything more complex. I know it is a smoked stout - so that should be the expectation - but I hoped for some other flavors somewhere in the palate. It is decent tasting but lacks a strong nose and depth int he taste."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: But for the lackluster head, this is a beautiful stout. The smoke was weaker in both aroma and taste than I'd hoped, or at least seemed that way next to the potency of a stout that nears imperial status. Enjoyable, but not a home run."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a tasty stout. However, with the smoke not playing much of a part and the relatively light body compared to the sweetness of the flavor, you could be convinced this was a chocolate porter or something perhaps. I'd like more smoke from a ""smoked stout," but it's still tasty and interesting."

"Overall this is a mediocre option at best from Dark Horse, I'll stick with Plead the 5th."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Another solid Dark Horse stout, plain and simple. It's so, so close to being great, it just needs a 'bigger' flavor to support its big mouthfeel. Still, I'd gladly buy and drink it again."
""
"Lack of head and lacing detracts from the appearance and the unassertiveness of the flavor certainly lower rating. This meets the judging requirements for a stout. It is very easy drinking, nearly a session stout, with no hint of smoke. Perhaps someone was smoking while moving the grain?"

"O: Rich and enjoyable with very nice flavors/aromas and a subtle amount of smoke. Easy to drink and definitely one to grab again."
"I'm not a good reviewer of smoked beers since I tend to avoid them. I did want to review this one because I wanted to review all 5 of Dark Horse's numbered stouts and I also like to expand my beer-drinking horizons on occasion. I am happy to report that this beer, unlike some smoked beers, did not taste like someone put out their cigarette in it. It's more of an American Stout than a Smoked Beer. Sadly, I think the smoke robs the beer of some of its richness and malt character and makes it taste a little bland on my palate. Fans of smoked beers may still want to check this one out."
""
""
""
""
""
"All-in-all, my least favorite of One, Too, Tres, Fore, and Plead the Fifth if that counts. This would be a good one for people who like stouts, but not so much smokey ones. The smoke is in this beer, but not in a huge way like I guess I was hoping."

""
"Overall - I really like this beer. Almost too smokey, but never crosses the line."

"O: Well crafted and a tasty stout, nothing I haven't had before but I wouldn't hesitate to get this again"

"Pours a black body with one finger brown head and minor lace patches all over glass. Not completely meaty like a german smokebeer but the aroma Is an intense smoked malt bomb with pretty much everything else subdued. Thick, fuller bodied and even chewy, bready, there are some bitter chocolate sweet notes and the balance is great b/c the smoked taste is not as strong as the aroma and doesn't kill the other taste sensations. A little bit of heat in finish that derives from both the smoke and alcohol and overall leads to a very enjoyable beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This beer gave me the impression that it was going to be a big, bold smoke bomb of a beer that was going to basically be like drinking a camp fire. It's not that, but it's something better - a terrific, balanced, nuanced stout. Would drink again."
""
""
"Fore isn't my favorite of the series but it is a damn good stout with a touch of the unique. Rich, bold, dense, and velvety about wrap up this beer. An approachable smoked beer for someone wanting to give one a try for the first time."
""
"O: Very smokey. A pretty decent beer. There's just enough offered beyond the smoke to keep it interesting."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This one is all over the place. Really enjoyed the aroma but the taste and mouthfeel were off. The hoppiness in the taste does not go well with the smokey tones."
"Overall- Decent smoked beer, interesting to try and review. Having had this several times, I don't think I'll get this again as I'm not a fan of smoked beers in general."

"12 oz. Bottle from Rebekah. Big thanks goes out to her! Pitch black pour with a nice creamy mocha colored head. Big time roast aroma, bittersweet chocolate, smoke char, and just a hint of sweet dark fruits. Flavor is super rich roasty bittersweet chocolate, subtle molasses and fruit sweetness, and finishing with a big blast of smoke on the palate. A combination of smoke and chocolate lingers for a long, while like smoked mesquite BBQ kind of wood. Big rich mouthfeel--impressive for the ABV--silky smooth with low to low-medium carbonation. Reminds me a lot of Plead the Fifth but with extra extra roast and some smoke. Smoke doesn't overpower which gives this a nice complexity among all the flavors present. This is really really good!"
""
""
""
""
""
"I think I'll get more."
"NYE bottle share at Proof. Apparently 4-5 years aged. Pours a deep rich black color with very thin head and a decent tan collar. Aroma is lightly smoked malt, and some burnt coffee. Taste is very similar. Taste is not overly smoked, which is a common complaint I have about smoked beers. Thick body and low-medium carbonation."

"O: It was a decent stout. The initial spike of smoke was perhaps too much for my taste, but as it mellowed what came through was a reasonable, but not exceptional, take on the stout style. Can't say I mind too much that I have three more, I think I'll try one with a slab of ribs and see how that goes. Still. I also can't say this would be the first pack I'd grab off the shelf the next time I'm browsing the options at my local haunts."
""
"Overall: Not bad, but I've had better stouts, and also better offerings from Dark Horse. I wouldn't go out of my way to seek this one out."

"A really tasty and enjoyable smokey stout, goes down surprisingly easily and hides its strength well. The only real knock is the body, which could stand to be a bit creamier. Otherwise, excellent and I look forward to having more of these."
""

""
""
"O: Yes!"

"Demure head, little less than a full finger and fizzes off rapidly, dark brown in color, minimal stickiness in the wispy lacing. The liquid is unsurprisingly black and opaque, lightens up just enough near the surface to see active carbonation and a mild orange tint. The nose is not vastly smoky, more a solid toastiness and roasted nuts and cocoa powder, very chocolaty, no real fruit presence nor citrus, minor notes of mineral water, cereal grains and granola, not overblown but steady and longlasting. Full-bodied, the carbonation brings a light prickle but not much overall activity or freshness. Instead, you get a lot more roast although I’d still call it chocolate and cocoa than coffee related and it only gets smoky when close to room temperature. Grains, tar, black tea, iron flecks, not much going on which is overtly sweet. More earthy with campfire ember accents. Here there’s some apricot, cherry to lower plum fruit flavors. In its favor it is smooth without excessive creaminess, drinks well but not ingratiatingly so. Marked most by its unremarkableness, no flaws, not quite generic, just a beer. Sometimes that is enough."
""
""
""
""
"Beer is medium-bodied with carbonation of medium intensity, resulting in a mouthfeel that is gently foamy and soft, with substantial thickness as well. Closes fairly dry, with substantial stickiness lingering on the lips and tongue."
""
""
""
"O: This beer doesn't do a whole lot for me. The burnt toast flavor just didn't work. It almost masked any other flavors that were present. True to style though. Dark Horse does some amazing stuff but I wouldn't seek this out again."
""
"Overall this is okay. I'm not able to recommend it. If I got into a conversation with somebody who said ""I'm looking for a Guiness like beer, but, maybe with a smokey flavor", I would point them to this beverage. It would be with warning - more of a ""well, if you see this..."" as opposed to ""you gotta find this!"" ...it isn't worth seeking out..."
"Very easy to drink for the style. The char is just enough to let you know it's smoked, it never crosses the line. ABV on the bottle is listed at 7%, but it's so smooth you wouldn't know it. Good beer."
"Mouthfeel thick and kind of syrup like, spot on for a good stout. I would have liked a tad more carbonation but that's just personal preference, it borderline flat."

"I like this quite a bit. A nice stout with a medium amount of smoke."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours an impenetrable black body with a small brown head with decent retention. Aromas are predominantly of a charry smoke and dark chocolate garnache, reminiscent of a burnt smore. The aromas come through in a big and literal way on the front and mid-palates, with a sweet and smoky finish that lingers long pleasantly. Full bodied with warm alcoholic tingle. Assertive without being so heavy handed on the smokiness that you want to quit halfway through."
""
""
""
""
"I personally do not know why I tried this beer. If you are looking for a very smoky, coffee type of beer with chocolate undertones, this is the beer for you. The aroma starts of hitting you with the smokey nose along with the coffee appearance. IT is a thicker beer that is filled with flavors, just not the flavors I am looking for in a beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Dark rich color that hits you right away with the smoke. The coffee and dark chocolate undertones then come through very vibrantly. The aroma is full and rich. The creaminess of this beer is evident from the site of the pour. The appearance is very dark drown, almost black. Very rich and flavorful stout, excellent choice for this style of beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's amazing to me that I have not had this beer until today.Pours into a nonic nearly jet black except for a deep chesnut brown tinge at the bottom of the glass a deep mocha colored head atop.The smoke stands out but is not in your face that along with molasses and dark roast coffee make up the nose mostly.A fuler but more mellow mouthfeel with molasses and dark roast coffee flavors over top of mild hardwood smoke.The smoke plays a role but doesn't punch you in the face wich I thought would be the case,solid."
"The feel is easy and light with a touch of wateriness but overall this is a beer with good character."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a rich black with a half finger of brown head that almost immediately fades to naught. Initially I'm not getting any smoke on the nose. Definitely some roasted coffee, sugar, cream and hints of vanilla and cocoa there though. Not nearly as menacing as the name led me to assume. The beer tastes pretty mild as far as the smoke is concerned also. I don't get any of the acrid or astringent flavors sometimes found in heavily roasted smoked beers. Roasted barley and char (more than smoke) come out front then a bit of hop bitterness and semi-dark chocolate come out midway and last through the finish."

"Pours a heavy, motor oil color with only some sparse, creamy brown wisps on top. Damn, these guys really like to make their stouts DARK. Somewhat subdued smoky malt aromas combine nicely with softly sweet, chocolaty roast, and berries. Deliciously malty flavor...the smoke isn't really center stage, but rather supporting the rich, dark chocolate and cutting the sweetness with a bitter, espresso and campfire finish. Pleasant tobacco and dark fruity undertones. Medium bodied and fairly low on carbonation. I've enjoyed every single one of these Dark Horse stouts...well done!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-Unlike other smoked beers the smoke is not overpowering here. The third best of the stout series."
""
""
""
"I get very minimal smoke off this beer. It's an accent at best, which I appreciate. The beer as a stout is very solid. Robust and rich, there are thick malts that really rest in the mouth well. Smooth feel. Easy to drink. Not sure what else you could ask for in a stout. For this some people might want more smoke, but for me, I am happy with it."
""
"A very good stout. I wanted to rate it higher but it just didn't bring the smoke. It is very earthy and has charcoal notes but lacks the smoke. Still worth a purchase."
""
""
"What it lacks in smoke aroma, it makes up for in flavor, but the quality of smoke was disappointing. Would've preferred less ashtray and more hardwood. There's a touch of acrid flavor that's offputting."
""
"This is an overall decent beer, but it doesn't showcase any smoke in my opinion. I think this definitely a nice, simple stout, but I was hoping for something smoke forward and unique. I may revisit in the future. For now I'm on the fence."
""
""
""
"Overall: this one was better than expected. I got tres blueberry in the same mix six and was very disappointed with that one. This one has nice balance and a good mouthfeel and appearance that makes it a really good beer. If you're in the mood for a slightly smokey and nicely balanced roasted malts this one will take you there"
""
""
""
""
""
"Fore is dedicated and direct in its focus, not allowing any distraction from fruit, spice or any other peripheral characteristics. Its roast character shows great discipline and power. It's a fantastic display in the use of smoke with balance."
""
"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, late 2012 bottling. Pours dense pitch black color with a small fairly dense dark tan head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Slight spotty lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, char, roasted malt, coffee, smoke, toast, light raisin, and roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good strength, balance, and complexity of dark roasted notes; the smoke is very complimenting and not overpowering. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, char, roasted malt, coffee, smoke, light smoked meat, light wood, toast, and roasted earthiness. No bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, char, roasted malt, light coffee, light smoke, toast, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice flavor balance and robustness of dark roasted flavors with smoke; and zero cloying sweetness present after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very creamy and fairly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice smoked stout! Very robust and balanced with roasted flavors and smokiness; and extremely smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering."
""
""
""
"D - The aroma doesn't exhibit enough smoke but the taste doesn't balance it enough. Would revisit, but probably not with any further expectations."
""
""
""
""

"Overall - Not bad, not overly smokey like most smoked beers ive had. Rather smooth and easy to drink. Pretty good beer with a little sweet kick. Worth a drink, espically for people that have had smoked beers and found them overbearing."
""
"O - Overall, my first smoked beer. It was good, and would pair well with a bacon sandwich. Nothing amazing however."
"Overall, I'd recommend it. It's great on a winter night and I think I'd like it better paired with red meat."

"Overall: Good to have found the fourth installment of the series."
""
""
""
""
""
"The pour is chocolate milk thick with a thin but yet rich, head. Scents of burnt chocolate, coffee, cocoa, and toasted malts. Great scented like a classic stout. Tastes robust, a bit thin, no hops but a nice smoke-chard finish that is easy to drink. A bit thin but yet likeable and strong with accented malt-smoked flavour. Very easy to finish yet extremely strong. The longer you drink it the more accentuated the smoke because, which I find intriguing and different. I have no complaints about this one, as it was nicely priced, and lived up to the billing!"
""
"I've enjoyed Dark Horse brews before, but was still surprised at how much I enjoyed this one. One of my favorite smoked stouts."
"Black and inky with no foam. Smells of smoke, leather, tobacco, toasted and roasted malts. Flavor is roasted with smoke, coffee grounds, leather, metal and some dust. Okay flavor. Medium on full bodied with low on moderate carb and a semi dry finish. This was less smoky than I expected (a good thing), but the stout underneath lacked the refined character I usually get from the folks at Dark Horse."
"I'm not 100% convinced that this stout works with the smoked peat but it is none the least quite good. Perhaps it something i need to get used to a bit. or maybe it's the fact that this beer is almost a year old. being it number 4 in there series. What ever."
"O: This was a very flavorful stout. And, for fans of smoky tasting beers, this one really delivers on the smokiness along with an outstanding stout. It had a very appealing malt sweetness that was balanced by a dark roasted bitterness that resulted in a coffee and cream quality. And, all of this was enhanced by a touch of peat smoke that added a pleasing level of complexity."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall. Nicee stout with some great smoke that doesn't take over like in so many smoked beers. Nice stuff."
""
""
"O - Works better as a porter than a stout. Completely fails as a rauchbier. The smoke is so incredibly faint that its barely recognizable as roasted malts at all. Average beer, but still quite drinkable."
""
""
"OVERALL: Good beer, as the aromas and flavors are very well integrated at this point. A more impressive head and a bigger palate would help give this one the push it so deserves, but it was an enjoyable drink as it is. Would gladly drink again. Cheers for the bottle TheTomG."
""
""
"O: This stout is very flavorful and easy to drink, even though there are lots of rich, malty flavors."
""
"O: A good beer with lots of nice roasted and smokey characteristics. I'd like the smoke to be a bit more present, but it's still tasty and enjoyable."
"O: Smoke and chocolate and a bit of coffee best describe this assertive beer. There is a depth of flavors and aromas but all supporting three main characteristics."
""
""
""
"O- really good beer. Should have reviewed this months ago when the weather was more appropriate, though."
""
" The taste has a nice woody note with good sweet malt backing and body with light tinge of spice and mild toffee mixed with smoke and gentle fruity flavor in the yeast which adds complexity to the sweet woody and smoked jerky-like almost cinnamon earthy component. The flavor gets more roasted with some dark sugar as it warms with smoke flavor and subtle raisin tinge in the finish. Overall this is a great beer, way more drinkable than it should be for 8%, it drinks like 6% maybe. The smoke could be more forward, but then again I appreciate the balance this has -an extremely well crafted drinkable stout!"

"On-tap. ½ Pint glass. Enjoyed on may´12 at “The Freiburg” following Robert Merryman´s advisories. Very dark amber in color. Brownish, slowly dissipated, creamy crown. Toasted malt aromas & cocoa hues to the nose. Fresh black tobacco too. It tastes as it smells: hints of coffee & black chocolate, tobacco touch & smoke resolves in a puckering sensation. Eventough, mouthfeel is smooth & creamy with low but dry bitterness. Mildy ripe plum on the finish. Delightful & refreshing. Gimmy more!!"
"Appearance is near black with a mahogany head. Its` nose has roasted malts, caramel and smoke. The taste is caramel, bitter chocolate, peat and smoke. Mouthfeel is medium, smooth aftertaste, a bit sweet, Overall, a very good smoke beer from Dark Horse."
""
"Black body with a dense brown head. Solid lacing and good retention. Sweet and smokey on the nose, some dark chocolate. A bit of roast, and sweet dark malts. More roast on the palate, gentle roast. Both sweet milk chocolate and bitter dark chocolate, lasting into the finish. Medium heavy body, smooth feel conducive to ease of consumption. A real solid stout all in all, not as much smoke as I had anticipated however. Would revisit."
"Beer is medium in body and less smokey than you'd expect after the nose. It is a nice beer overall but not my favorite, I'd probably have it again."
""
""
"Delicious!"
"O - Overall a good stout. I tend to get overpowered by heavy handed use of smoked malt, but this does stay in control and well balanced. Smoke accents instead of taking over the other flavors here. Probably not something I will run and and buy regularly, but will probably revisit occasionally, especially in cooler weather."
""
""
""
"This beer also slows smoothly, having a light carbonation all the way through as well as a nice creaminess that comes into play from middle to finish. The body is appropriately heavy without sitting heavily."
"Overall a fine stout, wish it was a bit smokier, kinda comes off as just a stout with more roasted malt than usual rather than a smoked stout. Wouldn't mind having it again."
""
""
"Overall: A very good stout. Smoke elements could of been a little stronger but the dark malts are really great. Almost as robust as an imperial stout."
""
"Overall: Solid, unique brew. When I'm feeling up for a smoked, heavier brew, I'll look for this when it comes around next year."
"Pour is pitch black, thick and off white head. It smells like Founders IS. Thick leather and soy sauce smell and flavors. Its a touch lighter than FIS though. Balanced heavy flavors, but not too heavy. The smoke isnt too much, its more of a nice accent to the heavy roasted and toasted malts. It looks like motor oil, hell it event tastes like it. More of a Stout than Rauchbier, but oh well."
""
""
""
""
"Pours thick dark and opaque. Very dark khaki head but thin and fades fast. Smell is of roasted chocolate, a little on the sweeter side. The taste is very good. Lots of chocolate throughout, sweet and some bitter. Nice roasted flavors mixed in at the end with a woodsy, almost burnt taste, still on the subtle side. Medium body, low carbonation. Very tasty beer. Love the chocolate with the different dimension of smoked added to it. Would love another one!"

"M. Medium body with light carbonation, has a bit of an oily quality to the texture, but the ABV is masked quite well."
""
""
""
"The color of the pour resembles motor oil with a one and a half finger head that looks like bubbly chocolate milk. The smell of chocolate dominates with slight undertones of smoked wood. Chocolate malt up front transitioning to hroasted malt that finishes with slightly bitter woody smokiness. Wonderful mouthfeel, much more creamy than expected with lush carbonation. A very enjoyable smoked stout. The smoke complements the other flavors that are present and never dominates adding complexity to this solid brew."
""
"Body is medium with an appropriate carbonation level. Texture is never too prickly or syrupy. Dryness in the finish. I was shocked to see the ABV at 8%, because it's never noticeable. The well-masked alcohol and subtle smoke make this a very, very easy drinker for the style. I was pleasantly surprised."
""
"2) I recently had the most interesting smoked beer of my life. It was this european smoked beer and it legitimately smelled like bacon it has had a pretty meaty taste."
""
"Flavor is malty and roasty to start, then turns smokey but still retains its roasted malt backbone. I normally hate smoked beers, but this isn't that bad. The gf loves it though, so as long as she's happy I'm happy."
"Overall: Nice balance of sweet malts and smoke. Builds over time, but well done overall. I'd love to drink all five of these in a horizontal."
"Pitch black pour with a wicked looking deep reddish brown head, but doesnt stand long. Legs stick all over the glass, moreso than I would think for 8% booze. In the glass the beer just looks flat though - limp, wet noodle, erectile dysfunction - no lacing anywhere! Aroma is beautiful, doting touches of sweet milk chocolate in the midst of roasted smoked wood. Caramel, toffee, and booze are also detectable and create a well rounded nose. Caramel & smoked wood hit up front with a strong combination of dark chocolates and alcohol heat in the back. Carbonation is about right here, but the body is too thin, in my opinion, and would match the smoked character better with some more ""meat"" to it."
"A tasty smoked stout. I like the balance - the smoke doesn't overpower the other elements of the beer, but complements them really well."

"Very enjoyable."

"D/O: This stout is a fine, if relatively strong, example of export stout--but it's smoked qualities hardly define it. This is the first of Dark Horse's numbered series of stouts that I have had, and I can't help but wonder just how similar they are to each other. In the final tally it is particularly malt-focused and still remains easy to drink."
""
"As usual this is another well crafted offering from Dark Horse. I'm telling ya these people know their stuff."
"O: Decent stout. The best part of this beer is the taste which demonstrates the finer qualities of a roasty stout brewed with some fruit."
"O- I enjoyed this beer as a regular stout. I don't know where the smoke comes in as a big portion of it but it's still worth seeking out"
""
""
""
"Overall, a pretty decent smoked stout. I think it's a little too smokey, they could dial that back a bit but the stout base beer is quite good. It's worth a try but I couldn't drink more than one at a time."
""
"O: Very nice but could only drink one per session"
""
"Still working my way through these seasonal stouts...this has been taking me way the hell too long... This one pours a straight oily black topped by a small bit o' dirty tan foam. The nose comprises roasted malts, dark hickory smoke, molasses, and a touch of dark cocoa powder. The taste generally follows suit, though the smoke comes off more hickory-style this time, drying things out a bit and distracting from the rest of the flavors. The body is a stolid medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a lightly chewy feel. Overall, a very nice smoked stout, though one that could do with a touch more balance if it wants to be truly great."
""
"O - I'm not a huge fan of smoked beers, but the smoke works well here and is nicely balanced. Another solid stout from Dark Horse."
"Tough style to nail. This is still a good example. Tasty and comforting."
"Average, nothing really special, especially compared to Dark Horse's other stouts like Plead the 5th, One, Too.."
"O. A good beer, not as smoky as I would expect from a beer called ""smoked."" But still has solid bold flavor, with a hearty thick feel. A filling beer."
"Overall, I really enjoy all the Dark Horse winter stouts, especially this one, but wish they would fix the thin mouthfeel by increasing the mash temp or switching to a less attenuating yeast. The mouthfeel appears to hurt this one more than othe others in the series. I rememeber this being a little smootherr - maybe it needs some time to sit an rest."
""
""
""
"The Dark Horse Fore Smoked Stout was a decent stout. The beer poured pitch black with tan head. The smell was one of cigarette smoke and coffee...like a high school librarian. The taste followed the smell quite closely. The mouthfeel was a full body beer with smooth carbonation. Overall it is a good stout and should bring back memories of old."
""
"2/21 Need to make an update to this review, and a big shout out to my 'northside brew expert C Brown who say's ""you got da roll dat bottle""! Indeed, take the time to roll Fore so the sediment will pour which will greatly enhance the taste of this brew."
""
""
""
""
"O: Fore is a nice smoked beer. I'll probably buy a future batch to compare a fresh bottle."
""
""
"O: Awesome subtle smoke beer...pretty much a stout in my opinion with smoky characteristics, which is perfect for this beer."
""
""
"O - maybe my favorite so far. The perfect amount smoke."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I like this beer, but it has a few quirks. The saltiness in the finish is a bit much. The smokiness is there, and the malty sweetness is spot on, but there is something about this that I'm not totally convinced makes it a ""great"" beer."
"O- very well done smoked beer. One of the better one's i've had. Light enough that it doesn't overpower the palate, which makes it quite easy to drink. This is one to def try."

"O - This is a very tasty stout. I failed to detect a smoke presence. Perhaps this beer is past its prime and the smoke faded. Nevertheless, it is quite good."
"O: A pretty decent stout. Definitely not for someone that is looking for a touch of smokiness."
"Big thanks goes out to my boy aasher for this one! Fourth in the series and fourth on the day! Served from bottle into a Duvel tulip. Poured pitch black with a half finger light brown head that subsided to a minimal amount. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, smoke, roasted malt, and dark chocolate. The flavor was of sweet malt, smoke, smoked meat, dark chocolate, and roasted malt. It had a heavy feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a good brew. Now this is more like it! I have been becoming a big fan of Smoked Beers lately and this was a good example of why. The smoke notes on this one were really nice and well integrated with the rest of the brew. I wish the aroma would have carried more of the smokiness aspect as the flavor did, but that is just me being picky. A nicely done brew."
"O: Solid beer, very good beer overall. Smoked notes are subtle, with the smokiness coming in on the back end and is a very deep smokiness."
"Overall, this was a beer that I picked up simply due to the fact that Dark Horse made it. I can say that it's quite nice even though I'm a bit indifferent to smoked beers. I think it would definitely hit the mark for people who love smokiness and a nice RIS."
"This is one of the best smoked beers I've tried! It has just the right amount of smokiness so that it's tasty and not like a distilled campfire. Thanks to jmarsh123 for this one! So good!"
"Overall, this is a good solid beer. I know a lot of people love liquid smoke in their smoky beers. I love a nicely balanced, subtle smoke flavor especially in the darker beers. I think this beer delivers that. Its not anything out of this world, but it delivers exactly what it promises."
"This one was OK, but I think it's in a no-man's land. Too smoky for people who don't like smoked beers, not smoky enough for those who do."
"overall i don't think i'm a huge fan of smoked beers but his one isn't bad and i would turn down a free one ever. i think the intense carbonation makes this one a little more undesirable for me."
"Overall I rather liked this beer and would buy it if it was available in my area. It's something I'd like to have one of after a steak dinner, and more of a winter beer for me."
"O- It's a nice beer with chili maybe, but really its high abv keeps it from being a more than one in a night kinda thing"
"Medium to full bodied with excellent carbonation, this beer is about as refreshing as a thick stout can get. The body seems to be just right as it does not become syrupy or excessively sticky but does coat your mouth well. The carbonation is rather fizzy for a stout but does not take away from the flavors nor does it make the beer feel light."
"Good coffee and chocolate notes with smoke and some burnt sugar. An okay smoke stout, I wish there was a little more smoke."
"O: I've not had a better smoke stout. This one is intense and delicious. Always impressed with Dark Horse - sorry they're not distributed more widely."
" an inky, jet black with a thin, but very dark brown head leaving a light, bubbly ring of lace. aroma is excellent with big notes of roasted malts, smokey campfire wood, dark chocolate, and a hint of peat with just a touch of soil and caramel. flavor is wonderful with big, fudgy, dark chocolate, roast malts, burnt toast, and light coffee notes up front that blend seamlessly into notes of dark fruit and smokey ash on the back end. palate is medium bodied with light carbonation and lingering smokey, cocoa finish. overall, and damn nice smoked stout."
"This is a solid smoked stout. I really appreciate the fact that the smoke is not overwhelming, allowing other areas of the stout to come through."
"Completely black with small tan head no lacing. smells dark fruits raisins, coffee, smoke. tastes sweet but a bit coffee flavor/acidic lingers. not as smokey as it could be tastes more as a roast. Feel is watery and smooth not too thick but filmy. Overall good stout well hidden alcohol but not as smokey as would like."
"As a beer - as a sweeter stout - this is pretty damn tasty. But the smoke is pretty reserved, I'm not seeing it as to style - the chocolate and coffee dominate. The smoke is there, but could easily be confused with the roast expected in a stout. Still - very strong brew."
"O: I think this one would be even better in the winter or fall but I had it in and forgot about it so I decided to give it a try. Even on a hot July night it tastes good."
"O- A stellar offering from Dark Horse. I'd like to find some bottles of it, but I doubt it'll be any match for draft."
"O - Pretty good, but the flavor doesn't hold up to what the aroma suggests. However, I find it rather enjoyable."
"It works in a different way from the German versions I like, but the burnt taste is still there. I would buy this again as a less expensive alternative to the Germans. I wish I had some of my extra dark pretzels left. They would go well with this."
"Overall (4): Pretty drinkable for its ABV with no sign of the heat which is slight perceptible in the nose until maybe the very end of the aftertaste. The smoke just isn't there; these bottle are a few months old at his point and I remember earlier tastings having a bit more of that character. Fine by me though. A damn good imperial sweet stout (?)."
" Medium bodied with medium carbonation, high acidity, and medium finish. Overall not bad, but not exactly what I was in for."
"The Smokey flavors are contrasted by some smooth sweet vanilla and milk chocolate, and some dark chocolates. Finishes rather dry."
"Handsome dark color in the glass with mahogany around the edges. Nice head and lacing around the glass, a creamy feel to it. Improves with a little air and warming. Rich, roasted flavors. Just a touch of burnt malt, with most of the flavors in the chocolate range. Hops are modest but just the right touch. A robust malty beer but manages to be refreshing at the same time. A winner in my book."
"Pours silky black with minimal, quickly dissipating head. Aroma is smoke (of course) with roasty slightly sweet chocolate notes following. Tasting it, the smoke is there but takes a back seat to the coffee and bitter chocolate notes. Finish is smoky and bitter and hangs around awhile, which surprises me because it drank rather thin, Really good beer and really good stout but honestly, I have had better examples of smoked beers. Seems to be missing...Something ? !"
"O: quite nice. smoked beers can be very hit or miss and this one is certainly on. Could use a bit more flavor to round things out. A barrel aged version of this would be heavenly."
"O- I liked it. Really easy to drink. Lacks the complexity I had hoped for but I would gladly drink this one again."
"Overall: I would have liked a little more sweetness to balance out the smoke. A good beer and I would have another given the chance."
"overall this is a nice smoked beer. wouldn't go out of my way to seek it out, necessarily, but i would be more than open to a future revisit."
"Thinner medium body, decent carbonation, a bit dry, somewhat watery for my tastes. This was okay but I thought the smoke was too light and the body too thin."
"Drinkability is good. It's not too smoky, nice and robust and east drinking. Glad I've got another! (Thanks Josh!)"
"Appears dark as night, small mocha brown head. Aroma of heavily roasted malts, some smoke and a mild chocolate note. Tastes of bitter coffee and roasted malts. As it warms, some beefy meaty notes emerge. A little char, faint dry cocoa. Full bodied, a little syrupy but carbonation is good. Overall, another tasty Dark Horse stout. Good stuff."
"Pours black as night with a finger and a half of mocha colored foam. Smells like epic mealtime son. Burnt roast char and chocolate meat. For the haters it tastes like Char and chocolate malt with smoke flavor added. Feels like I'm chewing it down. A liquid supper. Beautiful. This beer isn't my style but I like it."
"Pours a pitch black with a 1 inch dark tan head that fades to a thin cap. No lacing whatsoever. Smells of smoked malt, dark chocolate, and slight coffee beans. Tastes of the smoked malt first and foremost, followed by a subdued chocolate and ground coffee bean taste. There is a campfire/smoke aftertaste on this beer, which I am really liking. Higher level of carbonation with a medium body. Overall, this is a good stout with a very nice smoked quality that I really enjoyed."
"This beer pours a motor oil black. It may be categorized here as a Smoked beer, but this has the rich sexy dark brown foam and black body of an amazing stout. The aromatics are mostly roasted coffee and some peat and wood smoke. The flavor is a pretty damn good mixture of chocolate malt, roasted malt, oatmeal, and some smoked malts. The great thing about this beer is there is enough smoked malts that they are prominent in the flavor of the stout without going into a dominant role. It drinks pretty darn smooth, it's a thick beer to take down and it'll fill you up right. Overall this is a good beer and I'm disappointed that it doesn't get more love."
"O (D) - A good, dry stout. Its not as smoky in the taste as I'd expected, but its certainly there. I will call this decent."
"Pours dark, not very thick, decent head... looks like a standard stout. Smell is roasty, some chocolate, maybe a little bit of smoke but i was hoping for more. Tastes roasty, some bitter chocolate, and a slight smokiness... more like a smokey coffee than the smoked meat taste that I would associate with the serious smoked beers. Overall this is a tasty stout that I would gladly drink again for the price, but it could have been better for my tastes."
"Overall, this is a delicious smoked stout that is not overpowered by the smoke. It strictly serves as a compliment to the other flavors and aromas which is rare in a smoked beer. It's smooth and goes down easy. This is definitely worth seeking out...even for those who are not crazy about smoked beers."
"Overall pretty solid, it's the nose on this that I enjoy the most quite complex and fascinating."
"Overall I thought this was a good beer, it didn't wow me like the other stouts from the series but it was still a good solid American Stout. I liked most things about this beer but I wish it was a little thicker and I wish it had more smoke to it, other then that it was pretty solid. I can see myself getting another four pack when it is released next year but I am not going to go out of my way to track one down. If you are looking for a good smoked beer you will probably pretty disappointed with Fore, but if you want a good robust slightly smoky American Stout then this beer will fit the bill. I'm glad I knocked out another stout from the series, all I have left to try is One Oatmeal Stout and Plead The Fifth. Dark Horse makes some solid stouts thats for sure."
"Overall right now I am kicking myself since I didn't grab an extra bottle or two of this! Another great offering and I am loving there beers more and more. Definitely can't wait to see what beer hits my D's six packs next since it's the only place in town carrying these fantastic beers. Smokey good Dark Horse Team!"
"O - I'm liking this beer theres just enough smoke in it to keep me happy sure I'd like more smoke but its getting the job done in the flavor department making it worthy to pick up if you find it around"
"Harsher than the smell indicates, strong black patent component. Very close to an Irish stout in terms of the dryness. I do not detect any smokiness. The body is on the thinnish side; the carbonation above average. The aftertaste is bitter in a burnt sense."
"Drinkability is okay, a chocolatey stout, but lacking the smoke I expected by the name - average."
"Overall this is another solid brew from Dark Hose."
"SkÅL!"
"A pretty tasty stout that stands out compared to other American stouts. Some flaws, mainly texturally, but a decent offering. Certainly a nice introduction to Dark Horse."
"Overall: Really decent beer from Dark Horse. These guys are making some decent stouts and this is no exception. Looking forward to trying the remainder of the series of 5."
"Overall: Very good Stout overall. The charred notes add a nice layer of complexity to what would have otherwise been a fairly straightforward Stout."
"...fore."
"O: I was pretty impressed with this. I usually don't go for the smoke brews, but I might have to reconsider after this. Dark Horse is doing some really good things with their stouts. Skal."
"O: I appreciated the balanced level of smokiness present here. Pretty easy to drink as well."
"Overall, this is just slightly better than average and I have to say I'm disappointed. The Too Cream was better and I actually expected to like the Fore more. Owell!"
"Another great stout, the foreth one in a row, heh. I personally would have preferred it a bit smokier but it sort of worked its way in nicely with some warmth. Keep it up on this series!"
"This pours impenetrable black with a one finger, tight mocha head that leaves no lace. It almost looks like it's on nitro. On the nose there is a great combination of deeply bitter chocolate with some clean smoke. This isn't like the peat smoke I'm used to in scotch whisky, but more like a clean oak smoke or something else a bit less intense than decaying biomass. It's a really well-balanced nose. In the mouth there is bitter chocolate, full city roasted coffee, a little bit of anise, and all of that riding on a clean cloud of smoke. Again, the smoke isn't overbearing or especially pungent, just present and very pleasant. The body is medium but the finish is nice and long with the bitter chocolate lingering with the smoke. The only downside of this beer is that it's probably a little too distinctive to drink back to back to back, but that's hardly a knock. I like this beer a good deal, quite a bit more than I thought I would. The smoke is just another flavor in a well-constructed stout, rather than a bolted-on gimmicky flavor. After a few misses with me, Dark Horse has really come through with Fore and Plead the 5th."
"Way more balanced in bottle than on the draft version I had last week, this dark pitch black Michigan stout forms with a 3 finger thicket of dark khaki tan head leaves thick chunky sporadic lacing. Aroma has dark chocolate, hints of fruity coffee, and underlying layers of smoked malts. Really not bad, one of the better of the four stouts, creamy dark chocolate flavor with hints of coffee and smoked stouts. Flavors in clude dark dry bitter chocolate with hints of roasted barley and smoked underlying malts not in your face but really cohesive and complimentary toward one another. Mouthfeel is big bodied stout with a creamy bodied and lingering smokey bitterness from the dark malts and smoked malt additions. Overall impression is that things just keep getting better when I try a new beer from Dark Horse I want to see more in Ohio and Pittsburgh. Great not too late to get adventurous greab some of the 5 stouts this year before they all disappear."
"not my favorite of the series or style, but very good. smoke is dominant, but not overpowering, which is good. I would not drink this often, but I would drink it again. Dark Horse makes two of my favorite ""smoky"" beers by not letting the smoke overpower, but adding complexity."
"Finish: Burnt malts with a subtle bitter hop"
"Overall, big character and strong flavor throughout. A little aging would help mellow out this strong stout."
"I really like this beer, but the smoke is nearly non-existent. The problem seems to be the same for all of the first four beers in the stout series- they are overly toasty. Still a good overall beer, just doesn't live up to the smoked name."
"Here's a fine example of a solid, average stout. There isn't much smoke in either the aroma or the taste, though. What is there is akin to the smell of a match that someone lit 10 minutes ago: a bit woody; a tad sweet; kind of old. Too bad. Still, this isn't such a bad beer: roast, coffee, molasses, vanilla, etc., and a nice dry finish. Low ABV and a nice creamy head. Decent but not a standout; it's worth a four-pack (the new six pack)."
"O: Multi-dimensional beer, I feel the strongest of the series so far.. Great beer and overly drinkable for a stout of its kind."
"O: This is only my 2nd time trying Dark Horse. Just an ok American Stout, don't go out of your way for this. It is solid, could use a little more body."
"Blind Man in the Dark - Gov't Mule"
"D: It is pretty good, except for the strange but not unusual aftertaste, the meat flavor sounds good but doesnt actually taste like jerky or any other smoked meat. There is (probably) a low ABV, I'd assume somewhere around 5-6%, so this isn't in the imperial range."
"Overall - Its a good beer, but I was hoping for a little more smoke characteristic coming through"
"Flavor is roasted malt and a bit of dark chocolate with some smokey firepit lingering after each swallow. A little molasses mixed in with the roasted notes. Pretty nice and easy drinking beer, no hops or ABV show up anywhere that I can detect. A nice smokey stout, that doest taste like eating burnt matches."
"Not something that Id want to drink a lot of, but wow what a beer. Would go well with bacon and eggs, or BBQ."
"Pours out to a blackish-brown body with a 1""tan head that has good retention and good lacing. The smell is some chocolate, coffee, roasted smoked malts and some dark fruits. The taste is smoked malts throughout along with strong bitter chocolate followed by some coffee, molasses and some sweet dark fruits at the end. I'm guessing the dark fruits is mostly raisins. The aftertaste is dark fruits and chocolate, reminds me of dark chocolate covered raisins. The mouthfeel is a smooth and creamy feel that leaves a bit of sweetness and dryness in the mouth. The good taste and smoothness of this stout makes it a nice beer to enjoy with some smoked cheese and/or dark chocolate candy."
"d - A pretty nice stout. I liked the nose a lot but would have liked a little more smoke in the taste. Would have again."
"This beer poured a midnight black, viscous, with a light dark khaki head that laced the glass. I know this beer is released in January but I think this may be from last year due to all of the sediment in the bottom of the bottle. This beer doesn't smell any different from the Dark Horse One Oatmeal stout. It has dark, rich roasted malts, slight smoke, some oak, and has a lactic acid like sweetness that fades to bitterness. The longer you sip the beer the more smoke you get in the nose. The taste is better than the Oatmeal in my opinion. It surprising starts out as bitter chocolate before finishing with moderate smoke. The more you drink it the sweeter the chocolate becomes. I like it. It doesn't have the lactic acid that the Oatmeal can have. It drinks pretty smoothly and still has good carbonation that tingles the palate. This is probably my favorite one of their stouts. It's also pretty drinkable considering it's probably around 8%, like the Oatmeal."
"Mouthfeel-Medium to low carbonation delivers a silky coating to the palate. Bittersweet bakers chocolate comes through and the finish hints at some herbal hops. Almost clean. Some char can be found with a froth on the palate. Good dark roated malt flavors mix in as well. I was expecting a more aggressive smoke flavor, but this is a very pleasing stout and I like the subtleness of the smoke. Tastes like a milk stout with the char and the dark roasted flavors coming and going."
"Bottle: Poured a dark black color stout with a medium size light brown foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of light smoked notes with some black chocolate and dry roasted notes. Taste is also a nice enough mix between some light smoke notes with some black chocolate and a dry roasted malt finish. Body was full with a nice creamy texture and some good carbonation. Well brewed stout though smoked notes are not as prominent as I would have expected."
"This beer pours a dark black color, with a very interesting color head. This head is the darkest tan I have ever seen. The aroma smells of roasted malts but mostly smoke. The taste starts out strong with smoke, maybe a smoked meat like flavor, switching over to a sweet yet bitter roasted malt flavor. The mouthfeel is thick, and it is more of a sipping beer."
"D: Goes down easily, quite tasty, not too filling, decent kick and a nice representation of style. I enjoyed this beer quite a bit."
"This is an easily drinkable beer although it seems a bit light for a stout and somewhat lacking in smoke. Still solid in the major categories."
"This beer went down easy despite it's heaviness and is one that I definitely want to try again."
"Dark Horse Fore Smoked Stout pours a deep chocolate colored head over an inky black brew. The nose is smoke (though not cloying) over dark chocolate with notes of leather. The flavor is more of that smoke with roasty malts and bakers chocolate notes, with a little bite of charred bread off the end for balance. Mouthfeel is smooth and round, with a long mellow finish. Smoked ales are pretty tricky- that particular flavor is so aggressive it's easy to end up with a beer that tastes like a Slim Jim©. Four finds that proper balance- the smoke is a point of complexity that does not dominate."
"D - more of a plain (yet well performed) stout with a hint of smoke than a full fledged Smoked Stout. still, works very well on a rainy and slightly chilly fall night. this might work well in some chili or stew."
"D: A bit of a let down; I was hoping for a great beer and I feel like I got average. I would have like more smoke and a little less carbonation. I'm gonna try laying one of these down for a bit, if for no other reason than why not."
"Enjoyable beer, nearly every category was spot on. My biggest gripe was the lack of smoke. I think a slight increase would really enhance this beer. Fore Smoked Stout is easy to drink but not one I am probably grabbing a second."
"Poured into a snifter. Color is near black with a bit of a brownish tint in the light. Not much head or lace. Nose brigs some roasted malt, smoke, coffee, and a bit of dark chocolate. Taste is mostly roast and smoke in pretty decent balance. Feel is nice and dry with a good body. A nice stout, but not my favorite in the numbered line."
"Dark horse with another great stout."
"*Note: This is a winter release, so I'm assuming this is an '09?? Maybe the smoke fades a bit after some time."
"The mouthfeel is thick and creamy with carbonation being low. Very nice mouthfeel for the style. Drinkability is good, it's a very flavorful and bold imperial stout. It wasn't as smoky as I hoped but the burnt bitterness was very nice. A very nice beer to sip on this evening."
"The mouth-feel is full but a bit flat. The beer is a bit surupy and clings to the mouth. It is quite drinkable. The smoked flavor is in no way overbearing. Good beer."
"Very enjoyable. This is the typical Dark Horse offering. That is meant as a good thing. A really good Smoke Stout with lots of balance. As always, well done."
"Pours black with a small mocha head that fades fast. The smell is smoky up front, with plenty of sweet notes, a hint of alcohol and chocolate malt. The first characteristic I noticed was the lack of body that I was expecting from a stout, but the flavor was good, starting subtle and finishing strong. The malt and alcohol were apparent in every sip along with the smoke. More flavors came out as the beer warmed. The mouthfeel was lacking, I was hoping for a heavier beer, but this medium light feel was ok. This one is an easy drinker, lots of flavor, and definitely worth a try."
"Drinks fairly easy, not bad, but doesn't quite pull together. Probably the lowest rated beer for me that I've had from these guys..."
"Drinkable? It's good enough I could put off playing with power tools or driving around...just kick back with some Provalone and fresh cherries...call it a good day."
"Overall, a nice stout with good flavors. I didn't pick up on much smoke which was a bit of a bummer."
"Would I buy more of it? - I wish."
"A touch of hops clean up the mad array of flavors at the end leaving a light smoke and roasted note in your mouth. The mouthfeel was nice and smooth with a very silky touch to it. It was not very heavy, while it was packed with flavor. I would say that it was a reasonable smoke stout, but nothing to write home about, just the internet."
"Thanks Jon. The smoke aromas are paramount. Pours black, great lace. above average mouthfeel. Coffee, smoke in flavour.Above average mouthfeel.Good and drinkable smoked that scored way about imperial stouts and porters in this tasting Another amazing stout from this brewery."
"D - This stout wasn't bad...it was my first smoked stout and I actually enjoyed the smoke flavors...the mouthfeel just threw me off a little"
"4.0 D: Pretty good beer. I enjoyed it quite a bit. I'm starting to think that Dark Horse makes some damn fine beer."
"So far I continue to be impressed by Dark Horse's stout line up. This is another good one from them and it's getting harder for me to pick a Dark Horse favorite."
"D- tasty stuff and to too heavy on the smoke. I'd like to try it paired up with some killer smoked meats."
"Overall: The body of the beer is medium full and the finish is full. This beer reallty suprised me. I was afraid that the blast of the hickory smoke was going to over take the palate, but it didn't The flavor was consisting and balanced. A good beer nonetheless."
"***Please take this review with a grain of salt as I am fairly certain this bottle was mislabelled."
"D-"
"Aroma is rich and very smoky with a chocolaty undertone and hints of burnt wood and molasses. It pours a beautiful opaque sable, just a whisker above black, with a thick, fine-bubbled tan head. Rich flavor is very smoky and has tones of molasses, fine roast coffee and unsweet chocolate as well as a tiny fishy hint. Texture is thick, smooth, oily and just a little tingly. This one is a must!"
"Between the smoke, mineral and the burnt chocolate, this has a kind of carbonized vibe to it, which is cool, but can be a little tiresome. That said, it's still an adequately well-rounded and, thankfully, multi-dimensional stout. Smoke is only a part of the equation here."
"F: Finishes slightly bitter from the roasted malts. Lingering smoked malt flavors, little smoked meats and cheese. Again it has that generic almost plasticy like lingering flavor, I really wish that wasn't there. Otherwise more brown sugar lingering, but quite dry."
"Pours black with dark red highlights. Dark tan head sticks around for just a bit. Nose is toasty with some dark chocolate. I'm not picking up much smoke, maybe just a touch. The dark chocolate bitterness comes to the front in the taste. I'd actually like it to be more smoky. It just tastes like a decent American stout to me. Mouthfeel is medium with good carbonation. I'm digging the chocolate flavors. It isn't what I expected, but it's a good beer nonetheless."
"D - smoke is a novelty so maybe just one."
"Drinkability is very good. Surprisingly so. The flavor could use a bit of refining, but regardless of that, drinkability is quite good for the style."
"Black as oil, no hues coming through when held to light. Tiny brown head doesnt stay long. Scent is all chocolate malts with a touch of campfire. Same for the taste. Smoke is there but its blended in; not as obvious as some of the other smokes ive had. Fairly full mouth, wet. Not a bad stout"
"Much more smoke in the flavor, with a hint of band-aids and charred bacon. The smokiness sort of clashes with dry, dark chocolate nibs and over-ripened dark fruits. Mouthfeel is exceptionally dry and has too much carbonation for the style. Drinks much more like a porter than a stout, as Fore lacks that much-needed creaminess and full body. All in all, an interesting beer, but this is one-and-done for me. Worth trying, but I'd rather have a true stout and/or a rauchbier."
"Poured from a 12oz brown bottle into a SA perfect pint glass. Appears black in color with less than a finger of severely dark tanned head that dissolves quite fast. The surface of this beer boils with the brown bubbles of carb that rise from the circular cut at the bottom of the glass which agitates and leaves a ring of brown lace all around the interior perimeter of the glass. Aroma of this beer is dark and roasty with scents of burnt grain akin to chocolate, coffee and a bit of smoke are all included. Taste is darkly roasted grain with flavors of dry bitter chocolates, coffee and smoked malt pulls up the tail end of the flavor that lingers through the semi-dry bitter finish. Medium feel with a modest amount of carbonation. For being the smoked version of their stout, it is equally roasty and smokey as the other offerings ive had from them and just barley enough of the smoked character to accent it and set it off as being different from the rest. There is a slight lingering musty flavor left in the mouth along with the smoke flavor that is a bit offputting. Other than that, overall it was decent."
"Overall, I like this beer simply because I love smoked... anything. We smoke our own meats, so naturally, this brew would be an ideal suitor. That said, it's not for the squeamish - Out of the 4 so far, it's definitely the most in-your-face brew. This one stands out more than the others simply because it was a bit more unbalanced in flavor; whereas the oatmeal, the cream and the blueberry were all more subtly involved. If you like smoke, you'll love this brew."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was completely opaque, a very dark dark coffee brown with a thin chocolate brown head that clung a bit. Aroma was slightly smokey, with a undertone of dark chocolate. Taste was smokey, slighty bitter. that shifted to mellowness as it went on. Felt good in the mouth. Coated very well, perhaps a little undercarbonated. Not bad to drink, more of a sipping/lingering beer."
"Creamy, savory full-bodied feel - it feels like a much more substantive beer than I suspect it is. I barely feel anything after having finished the glass, so I suspect this is 4-5%, similar to the Tres Blueberry Stout. This one also hits the mark for me - I wish more breweries were making low-ABV beers with this much big-beer flavor. No fluke here....Dark Horse is making some nice beers."
"Body is a bit lighter, with a good amount of carbonation. Alcohol is hidden pretty well. A nice beer, the smoky component adds a nice twist."
"Pours almost jet black, with a modest tan head; very little head retention. Attractive nose of vanilla and toffee. These flavors are present in the taste, along with caramel notes. Very nice malt profile. Smoke flavor is subtle, which is why this is the first smoked beer I've liked. This one went down quickly."
"D- To me this is a very drinakable smoked stout, I could have a few of these and wish I had access to it."
"D- This is closer to a sessionable stout. Goes down easy (if you like charred, roasted and smokey flavors)"
"This was good and might have been my overall favorite of the four Stouts. Just enough smoke was present while still letting the rest of the flavors have there time as well. I really enjoyed this one."
"Im not sure of the ABV on this but im thinking it's in the 7-8% range. Either way you cant taste it. Out of all the smoked beers i've had this is one that I can have two of in a night. When it was vwery cold I did not enjoy the taste, but with time, this one is a monster. Another winner from Dark Horse, they do good work."
"This is one of the better beers in this series. It's very drinkable and the smoke is nicely integrated and does not overwhelm."
"D - I wasn't sure if I would like this one, especially after the smoked bacon scent on the nose, and it turned out to be a decent beer."
"ovearall, probably not something i'll buy, but it was good to try. its a fairly good drink, just not a beer that pulls me back and makes me want to drink more."
"Drinkability: This is a very pleasant stout. It's easy to drink and the ABV doesn't feel very high so that 2 or 3 wouldn't be a problem. I was expecting a bit more smoke in the taste but there is some there and no reason to knock it for there not being more of it."
"D- Another very drinkable beer from Dark Horse. I enjoy this one a lot because it is something that is not done much at all. Cheers to Aaron for choosing this beer as something to not only make but bottle as well."
"All in all a solid brew. Very tasty and complex. I'm a big Dark Horse fan. Never had a bad brew."
"It is very cool to see Dark Horse make its presence known in Mass. Smoked Stout (how many of those do you see around?) comes out a completely pitch black, with a creamy, large tan head. Dark roasted malt in the smell, combined with some dark chocolate, earth, and just a little bit of the smoke factor. The dark chocolate shines through in the taste, with some earth tones, and the smoke in the background, keeping things interesting. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, which was the last thing I was expecting from a smoked stout. It has the silky texture of a cask ale, but with just a bit of carbonation. Difficult to nail down the ABV on this one, although it does not taste boozy at all. I like the fact that the smoke is not overwhelming on this one. It makes it that much more drinkable and approachable. Another fine addition to the lineup from this brewery. Cannot wait to get some of there one off beers here soon. Cheers"
"Great choice to accompany smoked fish with some strong cheese and crusty bread."
"Great drinkability, one of the better smoked beers that I have encountered,"
"D: A moderate stout, not too heavy but not too light. The chocolate and cocoa mix works for me."
"D- Interesting beer, intense smoke throughout the experience. Very drinkable and quite tasty. Might have to pick up a few more of these when I'm in the mood."
"The smoke is very present in the taste, still leaning toward being reminiscient of barbecue smoke (actually it reminds me most of liquid smoke, an artificial smoke flavoring used for cooking). Also some coffee and chocolate. Mouthfeel is pretty thick. Drinkability is ok for one or two but I find myself not really knowing what to do with the rest of the 4 pack. In time I'm sure they will get drank one way or another."
"Drinkability: A better than average but not great smoked beer. I could have a couple but have no desire to finish a four pack. Decent and worth a try."
"Having gone all the way through my bottle I still believe this has a similar base to Tres. It's a very solid American Stout backbone. But with such a strong affinity towards dark chocolate I feel blueberry mingles with it much better than smoke. The end result is me wishing I had a bottle of Tres hanging around."
"All in all, there is not much special going on in this brew. A little too much of a smoky / bacon flavor. Otherwise it's an ok brew. Not worth hunting down or trying. If you want to try something new, then maybe, otherwise, not worth your time."
"Decent little stout despite the absense of the smoke."
"A very drinkable beer. Quite tasty, and one that I am glad that I got. While it won't be your typical example, well worth it to try it out if you get the chance."
"D: Interesting, tasty, and highly drinkable. This one is a winner."
"Overall, this beer is extremely smokey. Almost too much smoke. Decent stout, but the smoke really covers up a lot of the flavors though. Not something I want a lot o"
"This one is very drinkable for me. This is what I'd call an almost perfect hybrid of a rauchbier and stout."
"Can't I would have this style of beer everyday, but would definitely have it again. The smokiness adds something you don't get with many other beers."
"Solid, not bad at all but not real remarkable either. Easily quaffable. The distinguishing part is subtle, not sure I'd know to look for it if it wasn't advertised in the name."
"D-great body but too smoky to enjoy a ton of them. The flavors are big, which I enjoy; but it seems overly smokey."
"Pours a dark black color with chocolate colored head. No lacing to speak of, not great on the retention either. When it's cold, this one smells like a wet dog, which is not appealing. As it warms, however, more roasted notes come out with some nice smooth smokiness. Taste is pretty good, the smoke isn't overpowering at all. Tastes kind of like Stone Smoked Porter to me, maybe a bit smokier. MF is a bit thin, though a pretty good stout overall. Drinks well, I was happy I had it, though I'm not sure I'll be revisiting it."
"I was a little disappointed by this one. I was expecting it to be a lot more smoky, maybe this is because I'm a big fan of smoky, peaty Islay whiskies like Laphroaig, Ardbeg and Lagavulin. Curious about the ABV, does anyone know?"
"D: another winner from Dark Horse. I really like what they do with their stouts and this one is no exception. A very enjoyable beer."
"Dark Horse has quickly become one of my favorite breweries as of late. Almost every beer I have had from them has been extremely impressive. This isn't my favorite Stout I have had from them, but it is definetly unique and well worth a shot."
"12 ounce bottle. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch brown head. Head retention and lacing are both decent. Aroma is smoked and roasted malt, coffee, bittersweet chocolate, wood, and some dark fruit. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there is also some licorice noticable in the taste along with a nice lingering smoky and sweet finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy and it is coating with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is very good, it's smooth and very easy to drink as the alcohol isn't noticable at all. I think this is a good overall brew, good thing I bought a 4 pack of this!"
"A solid American Stout that is quite flavorful and a nice change of pace from much bolder Imperial Stouts."
"A little watery going down, but nothing to really complain about. The fact of that is it makes the beer easier to drink, mix that in with the delicious and complex taste, and you have a spectacular stout that you should try soon."
"A nice tan head that dissipated quickly (I think this because my glass was slightly dirty). The beer is pitch black and poured like motor oil. The nose on the beer is filled with roasted malts, chocolate with a hint of smoked malt. The flavour is around is flavourful, but the mouthfeel is slightly thin, which hurts this beer a lot. The flavours are smoked notes and a lot of coffee flavours. Some hints of chocolate come through as well. There isn't just enough flavour."
"A good American Stout from one of Michigan's better brewers."
"D: I am guessing the ABV at most is 7% so certainly capable of throwing a few of these back and the price point isn't anything to cover the eyes about. A easy drinking smoked beer."
"Solid black brown, thick and ominous looking with a reasonable chocolate brown head and goodly lacing. The aroma is major league dark chocolate with a hint of sizzling bacon. Amazing, sweet but just a slight salty edge. The flavor jumps out with a full chocate malt and a subtle coffee bitterness. There's a hint of sweet smoke but the coffee prevails most in a relatively drinkable mid-plus bodied brew. The carbonation is subtle and smooth. Quite an impressive stout!"
"Gina at Dark Horse suggested, after I asked, that they had just changed the tap lines and, even though they were rinsed, cleaned, that some of the previous raspberry ale might still be present on the line. You know what?, this did not hurt the taste of this beer at all!"
"I woudl drink plenty of these in the fall!! perfect fall beer"
"I poured what looked like motor oil into my beer tasting wine glass. The little bit of light brown head disappeared quickly. This beer is black as night. The smell is mostly burnt coffee with chocolate and a bit of vanilla. The smoke makes itself evident in the taste. I'm tasting everything in the smell with a bit of smoked sausage and some raisin. Nice silky mouthfeel and quite drinkable. Another solid offering from a brewery that continues to put out a lot of winners. Note to Dark Horse- you keep putting out $7.99 4 packs of great beer, I'll keep buying them."
"Nice example of a sweet, dry stout. the smoke flavor wasn't a very big part of the beer but it IS there. Nice black beer with a dark brown head. 1 finger to the head and the appearance of this beer after poured reminded me of a breakfast stout. Nice cascading effect as the snifter is tilted. Roasted malt with burnt brown sugar and semi-sweet chocolate. Slightly smoky as it comes in and slightly sweet as it goes down. Mouthfeel a little on the silky, thin side. Good but not great."
"D - I've been holding off on this one because I rarely if ever like ""smoked"" beers, but Fore was a revelation. Mild, complimentary smoke flavored played nicely with the more traditional stout flavors, resulting in a very nice stout. Well-recommended. Probably my favorite of their seasonal stout series."
"Drinkability is good here if you can find this gem."
"The fourth installment pours with the same incredible darkness as the other three, and has about as much of a head as the first - maybe only a bit more, but you wouldn't know the difference after about 10 seconds. The darkness is lovely, but it looks lifeless almost. The smell is good, burnt crusty bread, hardwood ashe, dark astringent coffee, dark, unsweetened chocolate all come to mind - it smells like a stout, cooked over an open wood flame, then allowed to cool down, but not quite as intense on the smoky note as I woul expect based on one, too, and tres in regards to their flavors. I think the smokiness here does a nice job enhancing the dark roastiness in all ways. And the very same goes for the taste. You come up with a heavy roast coffe, with bread dunked into it, and a tiny bit of the darkest, burntest crusty bits of a slab of heavily smoked meat. Then it kind of levels out with a nice chocolatey sweetness, and finishes really quite clean. I expected the undercooked weenie taste that is usual in other smoked beers, but if its here, it's a well overcooked, almost black weenie with some ashe on it. I'm really liking this smoked stout., though it may be hard to tell it apart from some other equally as good unsmoked stouts - I could be wrong though, I do start to get a lingering smoky taste as I continue drinking. The body is kind of medium, not as full as the others, nice though, but the carbonation comes on sharply, stinging a bit as I swallow. Overall, though, this is a great one. I mean, of the four (and for that matter about any american stout) this one has the best everyday drinkability. I could see myself reaching for quite a few of these, until the burnt wood caught up with me. That's thwe only real hindrance, but if you like it, if it brings back memories of making BBQ over a live fire, then you'll love it."
"Near black, opaque color with a large, quickly diminishing mocha head that leaves a thin ring with little lacing. Aroma isn't very smokey, more roasted malt, barley, chocolate. Flavor follows the nose and sort of reminds me of a mild cousin to Founders Breakfast. Burnt malt and coffee, milk chocolate, barley and the smokiness lingers in the finish but never really asserts itself in the body. Slightly thinner body than expected for the style, but strong carbonation, burnt flavors and mild hopiness compensate. Would have preferred a little more smoke, but an excellent stout and will seek this out again."
"D- I love the taste but this ones a sipper for me. No more than one in a sitting but I'll be looking for this one again!"
"D - This is a pretty good smoked brew. Not overpowering but good enough smoked flavor."
"[resample]"
"Drinkability: Another interesting Dark Horse brew, and a worthy addition to the ... what the heck's the name of this series anyway? The One Through Five series. Whatever. Similarly low in alcohol, enhancing the drinkability somewhat, but also a little less flavorful, a little too carbonated, and a little duller looking than I'd like, decreasing it somewhat. All in all, though, it's a good beer, one I'm glad to have tried, though not one I could really see myself enjoying on a regular basis."
"Ha, I love this fizzy root beer head that appears and extinguishes just as quickly. I am reminded oh so slightly of smokey campfires and spicy roasty chocolates. I have had this one time prior on draft at the Bavarian Lodge in IL, and I can't say that bottling has reduced the draw of this stout. It is dark, real dark, yet one can still recognize the chocolate aspects of the hue. This will definitely be a stout I shall keep an eye peeled for when on more midwest soils."
"Bottle. Pours black with hardly any head. Aroma of sweet, rich, roasted malt, booze, and a touch of smoke. Flavor is sweet initially with some light smoky flavors (but not smoked meats). Weak-ish palate. Ok, but I like the other Dark Horse stouts better."
"Pours a dark black color. 1/3 inch head of a dark tan color. Decent retention and poor lacing. Smells of roasted malt, slight alcohol, slight sweet malt, some breadiness, and hints of hops. Fits the style of an American Stout. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Bitterness of the malt is quite noticeable. Tastes of roasted malt up front and throughout, some sweet malt, slight alcohol, not so much smokey as strongly roasted, and hop is present in the background. It takes a while for the slight smoke flavor to come through - needed to warm up a bit. Very rich in flavor and roasted bitterness is strong in the finish. Everything is pretty good about this beer except the appearance (very little retention and lacing)."
"Sure it's drinkable. Sure I'd take it over a waterey Guinness. I'd also reach for something else before this one, though. Like the Dark Horse Tres Blueberry Stout."
"Drinkability- Pretty smooth drinkability, but nothing I would go crazy over right now. Good, but not great."
"D: Very drinkable. Flavors are amiable to the palate and alcoholic taste is not present. Not too heavy and easy to finish too quickly."
"D - I really like what Dark Horse is doing, the Stouts I have had from them were amazing, the only one I have left to hunt down is the Blueberry, otherwise, great beer"
"D- Pretty drinkable for a stout. Worth a try but I probably won't seek it out again. I'd rather have a RIS or a cream stout, but the smoke is a nice change from the oatmeal stout."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/4"" dark brown head over the opaque dark brown/black brew. Head is promptly down to a swirly uneven layer of bubbles, with heavy legs and fleeting lace. Aroma is sweet coffee. Taste follows the nose, hearty coffee throughout, with wisps of smoke, if at all. Just not much room left after the coffee gets done. Mouthfeel is reasonably smooth, and drinkability is pretty good as well. Not quite what I was expecting, but still a good brew."
"I found this to be a pretty enjoyable and interesting stout. Smoke character is mild but very complementary. Another great stout from Dark Horse."
"my favorite of the stout series for dark horse and would suggest seeking this one out."
"pour is quite viscus. not much head. looks like a stout generally should. smell is chocolate, caramel, molasses, and a gentle smoke. tastes is pretty much that. not a very aggressive smoked malt character. somewhat oatmeal stout sweet. quite sweet actually. excellent volume. not heavy. but quite creamy. smooth. not boozy at all."
"Overall: Admittedly I'm a big fan of smoked beers (and obviously if you don't like smoked beers don't drink this--duh), but I was really impressed by this one. The harsher roast notes (likely from black patent malt) make this a nice variation on the ubiquitous smoked porter, and all of the flavors seem to meld together nicely. If you like smoked beers, definitely seek this one out."
"12 oz. Pours black with an ok brown head that dissipated fairly quickly. Not much for lacing either. Aromas are definitely smoke reminiscent of a campfire, along with roasted malts, and a faint hint of mocha. Flavors are very roasty, nearing a burned malt overtone with the smoke evident, but not over the top. Also hints of espresso and dark chocolate are present. Mouth-feel is smooth and coats the palate well. The roastiness provides good balance to the ale. I think i enjoyed this one and the oatmeal the most out of the series....only problem is I haven't seen Plead the 5th anywhere, and it's probably not available anymore. All 4 were very good takes on stouts and was fun to go through!"
"D- easy to finish but i dont think id reach for another one right away. smoked beers are more of a novelty to me. the smokiness is about the perfect level. dark horse made this one well, check it out."
"D: This is very enjoyable, I'm really glad I got to try this! Thanks, Bill!"
"overall a solid brew, and my first smoked stout. Dark Horse has yet to disappoint me!"
"D-This is a very enjoyable beer. Great, leaving me wanting more."
"D: Quite enjoyable, a well made stout, with or without the smoke. Bold flavors come together nicely; good sipper as it seems a little strong for a session beer. Would be happy to have more."
"Fore is another excellent beer in Dark Horse's stout series. It's not perfect. The nose could use some muscle and more body would go a long way. But, it does have a lot of flavor to go around. I've heard rumors that Dark Horse will be distributing in Ohio soon. I don't know how true that is, but a guy can dream, can't he?"
"M: full bodied with a low carbonation rate. ridiculously smooth."
"Drinkable times Fore! A great stout by Dark Horse!"
" I knew I wanted to try this beer but knew nothing about it, I was blown away ! Nice job Dark Horse !"
"Pours a pitch black and very little head. Smoked hops and malt come to mind first on the smell. Oily surface with beads settling on the surface for a few seconds. Lacy with an espresso brown color. On first taste, espresso comes to mind in a big way with maybe a finish of chocolate. Not too overpowering, but a bit sweet at the end. after taste stays in your mouth for a bit. A decent brew and certainly worth trying."
"A very tasty RIS, but no smoke to be found at all."
"This one paired like a champion with the cherry/chocolate Dairy Queen ice cream cake I got for the wife this valentines day!"
"D- Really enjoyable to drink and something a little different for sure."
"While it's a very good beer, each sip didn't leave me longing for the next so drinkability comes in a bit low."
"Pours a black oil consistency with little head that dwindled down to a ring. Smell is a little boozy almost like boubon. There is a hint of roasted malts and chocolate but mostly alcohol. The taste is more to the style. There is a hint of smoke with a really strong roasted malt flavor and a slight coffee and chocolate. The mouthfeel is creamy and full but its more of sipper than a session. A solid offering from Dark Horse but not the best smoked beer."
"Complex standout beer."
"D: I hear these stout series beers are best fresh. The nose and flavor are lacking on this year old. Still drinkable but tastes sludgy."
"Poured into a pint glass. Very dark in appearance, with a thin dirty colored head that dissipated quickly. Aroma consisted of mostly ethanol with some roasted malt and coffee. Flavor was not very smoky, almost like that liquid smoke flavoring. Highly ethanolic with roasted overtones."
"Taste: More sweet chocolate malts. I'm surprised that the chocolate flavor of the malts is coming across so strong. I figured that the smoke would dominate more. The smoke is strongest on the aftertaste."
"Near black pour with a brownish head. Roast malt and coffee aromas, earthy, some smoke. Full bodied, just a bit of liveliness in the mouth. Flavor similar to nose, but with a bit of chocolate and toffee or nut. Smoke is present but very unterstated. Finishes clean, not real lingering. Would expect this to stay with you a bit longer. Another in the line of excellent dark beers from Dark Horse. My least favorite of the number beers thus far however."
"I ordered Dark Horse One and Two from Archer and look forward to trying them out soon."
"just finished the dark horse brewery fore smoked stout. i think i marginally prefer it to the oatmeal stout i tried yesterday. it had a bit more head although head retention was still a problem, the same pitch black color, and the same mild drinkability. however the smokiness definitely adds some needed complexity and without overpowering roasted malt dryness which is up front. both of these ales however, are on the mild thin side of the stout spectrum."
"Drinkability is good. In general this is a bit to sweet for me. However, considering the size it'd make a great alternative to, say, a bomber of Alaskan Smoked or Stone Smoked. This went great with home made pulled pork."
"D - Its a really smoky beer. there's no hiding that. I like smoke, but I don't know I could drink this all nite, but it's real good for 1 or 2.... or maybe 3 or more."
"I bought a 4-pack at Holiday Market 3 weeks ago, and now finished all but 1. This is another good beer from a brewery I'm starting to really appreciate. The beer is dark brown to the point of black, with a thick tan foam that looks reddish when poured. The smell is all roasted malts, very very rich. I didn't really get much rauchbier aroma, but the smoke might be subtle versus the onslaught of malt. Same in the taste, no real smoke that I could taste but lots of malty sweetness. The body is reasonably thick while the carbonation is a little light, very good stout which might actually be a double stout."
"D: ABV doesn't seem too high but this is still somewhat a sipper. Decent, though."
"Overall it's pretty good, but not good enough to make me really glad I got two bottles of it instead of buying something else that I hadn't had before. I was a little overwhelmed by the variety and grabbed it twice, apparently."
"D - A good sessionable stout. I just wish it had a bit more complexity in the nose...I'm a big fan of smellin' my beers. This tastes good, and the mouth feel elevates it to a higher tier of good beer."
"Drinkability: The whole series comes up short in the mouthfeel department but otherwise they are a fine group of beers"
"Another cheers to brdc. Pours just a hair shy of black with a surprisingly dark brown head. Smells sweet and roasted, a bit peaty. Tastes a bit too charred - consists mostly of roasty tones, weak coffee and milk chocolate. Finishes with that peat smoked character, a touch too astringent. No clue what the abv is, but seems a little hot. Good dry stout base, and i actually like the harsh finish in small doses - though over the course of a bottle it gets a bit rough. Mouthfeel isn't terribly viscous, but coats nicely - though that keeps the aftertaste on the tongue for a long time. Having tried One through ""Fore," I'm just not sure I'm so into Dark Horse's stouts (though i love their Black Bier)."
"It would need a lit bit more body, a little bit less charred taste to be truly amazing; as it is a very good stout."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: I feel kind of like a beer dick on the mouthfeel. I like my stouts big in every way. The mouthfeel is on the thin side of medium bodied. The carbonation is on the low side but works well with this beer. This is a very easy beer to drink. I wish I had a few more on hand."
"Pours jet black with a dark tan to a brown head. In the aroma, a pork smokeiness, and small hop presence. In the taste, roasty, coffee notes, and a small smoke presence. A small bitter and medium to big mouthfeel, with a dry roastiness, and small smokiness in the aftertaste. Great nose, was expecting more smoke in taste, yet really good."
"D- pretty damn good. im a fan."
"Poured into my imperial pint glass. Appears an opaque dark brown color with about a finger of tan foam that disappears in less than a minute. Smells mildly smokey. Aromas of dark chocolate and prunes are also apparent. Tastes very rich with a nice alcohol burn on the tongue and throat. Notes of dark chocolate, raisins, coffee and roasted malts dominate the flavor with a subtle smokiness throughout. Finish is dry and mildly bitter. Smooth and full bodied with minimal carbonation. I really enjoyed this on a chilly evening. Great to sip on. Worth a try if you see it around."
"D - It's a smoked stout all right! If your not much for the style, I can see how one wouldn't like it, but I enjoyed it. Worth a shot, and one of the better smoked stouts I have had."
"Body is moderate with some nice chewy textures. Carbonation is light but ok. So I could see how this beer would be considered off as the smoke is moderate, but for me I think it is right on. Doesn't overpower the beer and blends nicely. Some minor brewing notes, but still tasty."
"Mouthfeel is smooth, but lacks carbonation and feels too flat."
"Pours a viscous black right out of the bottle with no light penetrating. With an aggressive pour, the head was a small, dense mocha that dissipated almost immediately leaving almost no lacing. The smell had only a hint of charcoal and hickory smoke in the background and was more heavily skewed to the sweet side with roasted malts, dark chocolate and dark fruits. The taste is sweet up front with the chocolate malts and dark fruit before giving was to the smoky finish which lingers through the finish into the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is creamy with very little carbonation and just sticks to the inside of my mouth. This is a drinkable but robust stout that I really enjoyed and I'm looking forward to trying the rest of the stout series from DH."
"Overall a decent stout. I expected a very smokey brew with elements of the rauchbier style, but it was the dark grain and chocolate that really takes center stage here. Smooth and drinkable."
"The build-up was nice for this brew, but ultimately the flavor is decent at best, and I was hoping for more smokiness. I really enjoy this brewery for their imagination. This one didn't really work for me but I liked the attempt. The whole Stout Series thing is pretty cool..."
"drinkability is decent. this brew is smoked, but the smoke lends more to a spiced bite than smooth and earthy notes as is traditional. worth a try."
"D-Could drink this one all night long. Very satisfying."
"overall, i really enjoyed this"
"12 Oz Bottle. Oily density spills from the glass in viscous splendor. Thin rim of sweet Virginia pipe tobacco. Aroma has a suave and smooth rough salted oak and charcoal. Deeper there is a rich, musky earth spiced with whiskey splendor and hints of barbecue. Deep and complex. Flavor carries more of a dry stout character, but is nicely highlighted with grill char, sweet fish marinade, long drying coffee air, and some flatter ocean tastes. Carboniferous and yet higher with bits of brandy marinated fruit, nuts and nice general malt figures. Long smack in the middle of dry and sweet, but generally enjoyable. I guess as a Smoked this doesn't really excel all that much as I'm not grabbing that much smoke, but it's a nice stout twinged with those aromas and flavors."
"Pours a dark brown, the slightest trace of a tan head rises and fades into a thin ring around the edge of the glass, little to no lacing. Great aromas of dark chocolate, espresso, and lots and lots of smoke. Taste follows right along, with a slight leftover coffee taste, smokiness all along the tongue and roof of the mouth. Lingering bitterness and smoke. I'd like this just a touch thicker, but it's a minor complaint. This is a tasty stout."
"Pours deep dark brown with equally ark tan head. Half finger thinck hea dissipates almost as soon as it hits the glass. Light lacing is present but spotty. First smell is of chocolate. Next, deeper whiff and the subtle smokiness comes out. This is a very rih tasting, bitter stout. The smoke flavor hangs onto the tongue well after the swallow. I'm not sure how else to explain the taste except this is a most unique stoout. The mouthfeel is light but the aftertaste hangs on a little too long for me. I don't think I would be able to down more than one of these in a sitting. The bitter smokiness pretty much dominates the palate."
"Drinkability: This was a nice beer to drink, probably my favorite beer from Dark Horse, so far. Would I run out and get a six-pack of it if I was craving a nice stout? Maybe, but I didn't pick up on any smoke..."
"Thanks to Monkeyknife for sending this one through the BIF Race"
"D - Tasty. Yes drinkable."
"D- Obviously a standout beer for this category. Not my favorite, but can get it easily and will have it again. I think I'll wait until the winter to try this bad boy one more time. A little to syrupy to drink more than one."
"This is a thick full bodies brew with medium carbonation. Very complex as it warms. An interesting beer."
"Served in a standard pint glass (thanks iceicebaby). Poured an opaque black with a dense one-inch milk chocolate colored head. Some ruby red highlights detectable at the bottom of the glass every time I tilted it for a sip. Strands of watery lacing that produced several bands before eventually settling into some thin inconsistent webs. Scent of chocolate and malt. Taste similar to nose. Extremely rich with a subdued roasted coffee character in the background that nicely complemented the chocolate in the foreground. Smokiness was not detectable until the brew warmed and little, and only at the finish. Mouthfeel was medium-bodied and surprisingly light given the consistency; partially due to a mild effervescence across the middle of the tongue. Alcohol was well hidden and only expressed itself as a subtle warming around the back of the tongue. This is my third Dark Horse brew, and I am really falling in love with this company. What a great stout."
"Beautiful look to this beer. Pitch black. Inky black body. Thick dense dark brown head with great retention. It coats the glass fully as I drink. Nose has some light phenolic smokiness, milk chocolate and bitter roasted notes. Nice bitter roasted char like entrance on the palate. Chocolate follows with a bang. Bitter chocolate, that is. Some dark berry tones and a little of that flamed marshmellow char to it. Velvet feel. Medium bodied. This is very good. Only serves to strengthen my opinion of Dark Horse."
"Bottoms up..."
"Pours black with 2 fingers of dark brown head, little retention leaves spotty lacing. Smells of charcoal, dark fruit, dark chocolate, and coffee that has been sitting on the burner for a while. Tastes of smoky burnt malt, dark cocoa powder, cherries, plums, and a burnt espresso finish. Medium in body with fairly high carbonation for a stout. Smoky but not overwhelmingly so, more like very roasted and bitter with hints of smoke. Another unique stout from Dark Horse, but not as smoked as I expected. Still good though and worth a try."
"Glad I had a chance to try it, but smoked brews apparently ain't my thing."
"mouthfeel is creamy, rich, bitter and easy to drink."
"Silky mouthfeel, very slick, very good. Easy drinking for a smoky stout, could have several of these, don't believe the abv is above 8% but I could be wrong, very nice."
"Overall: Another great brew by Dark Horse. I just love them. All these great midwest brews almost make me wanna move back home to Indiana."
"This beer pours a dark brown almost black color. The head is half an inch in height, tan in color, and recedes quickly into sparse lacing. The aroma is of roasted malt, coffee, with a very faint hint of charcoal. The taste is like the aroma with a little more smoke, but it is still light. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lively carbonation. Overall, for something called a smoked stout I expected more smoke. It is not a bad beer. However, I think I would like it more if it were described as a stout with hints of smoke."
"Well done...a stout with character.."
"D: I really want to love this beer because of how much it demands your attention when drinking it, but it seems as though this beer is just too complex for its own good, or complex for the sake of complexity (just my opinion) and there are times when the smoke seems to detract from the overall taste rather then compliment it. It is a very good beer and one that I am sure is amazing on cask or tap, but in the bottle it seems a bit one dimensional even in its complexity."
"Bittersweet, with mellow earthy char that melds into the light smoky element. Aroma of bittersweet chocolate and ash. Undercurrent of brown sugar and molasses. Full bodied and milky textured. Subdued smoke makes it easy to finish a glass, even so, it's a robust stout. Bears a resemblance to the Too cream stout, with the addition of smoke."
"D- Yet again Dark Horse blows me away with another stout. I just wish I knew the ABV so I could better gauge how do drink this because I sure as hell can't detect any alcohol. A delicious surprise in a very plain bottle."
"Pours a black color, nice carbonation, little fizzy dark tan head, no sticky lacing to follow. The nose is malty, slight smokiness, slight vanilla, some toffee/caramel. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, good tones of toffee/caramel. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a pretty tasty stout. Recommended."
"Easy to drink stout, its on the bitter side for a stout in a good way."
"Honestly, during the first half of this bottle, I wasn't sure if I liked it. It must be an acquired taste, because by the end of the bottle, I was a believer!"
"Overall not bad at all. I am really enjoying this series of big stouts and think they are doing some nice things up there as far as experimenting. This was not as big on the smoked flavor as I thought it would be, but that was fine, it was just enough to give it a little flare and keep me very interested. Overall a rather nice example of the style."
"Pours black with a big dark caramel head that slowly recedes. Aroma is a nice smokiness, some cola sweet maltiness and a little roasted malt aroma as well with a little acidic tanginess. Taste follows the aroma fairly closely with a nice smoke quality, cola sweet malts show a little fruitiness as well. Nearly burnt roasted malts mingle well with the smokey flavor. Mouthfeel is medium in body, decent, carbonation is creamy, a bit of a hoppy, drying, peppery finish. A very drinkable stout, everything was in good proportion, sweetness to smokiness, very drinkable."
"Pours a complete midnight black with a big dark mocha three finger head that quickly dies down to a thin layer of bubbles. Not much lacing is left behind on the sides. Smell consists of sweet malts, charred wood, and brown sugar. Slight coffee and caramel aromas find their way in the nose as well. Not as smokey as I had anticipated, let's take a sip. Mild burnt wood flavors from start to finish. Dates and plum make a quick appearance on the tongue but are quickly over taken by more charred flavors. Very slight chocolate malts also can be detected on the tongue. Aftertaste is a bit dry with roasted barley. Flavor is kind of one dimensional overall. Medium bodied mouthfeel with an extremely smooth feel. Low carbonation, but I like how it fits in with this beer. Pretty solid beer overall. Definitely give it a shot, but I wouldn't go out of your way to do so."
"This one poured black as night with a collar of dark brown bubbles. The fine skim of foam stuck around for quite a while and produced some spotty lacing. Malty aroma with a charcoal character. Nice mellow smoke with some caramel, chocolate, vanilla and roast. Balanced, solid bitterness played well with sweet malts. Lots of caramel and bittersweet chocolate up front, smoke and burnt towards the end, but always accompanied by sweetness. Full bodied, average carbonation, slightly dry, decent texture. A solid stout with just enough smoke to keep it interesting, not enough to overpower. Nice balance."
"Pours an opaque black/brown, red edges, thin brown head, settles to a ring, some lace spots, looks basically like the other stouts in this series. Smell is sweet, chocolate, cherries and dark fruit, maple, cream, light smokiness. Taste is rich chocolate, roast, toffee, maple, cream, smoky finish, light though. Mouthfeel is light bodied, a little thin, low carbonation, easy on the smoke which would have distinquished it a bit from its counterparts, still pretty nice though."
"Drinkability - not necessarily smoky, I've had regular stouts that tasted pretty much like this one. That said, the mix of flavors has sessionability beyond what I could normally tolerate for the style."
"Overall a stout that has a very nice burnt/charred flavor going on, but not really any discernable smoke flavor happening. Dont get me wrong, I applaud the effort, its just not my cup of tea - or stout."
"Pours thick oil black as the rich body settles into the glass. A hard pour only gets about a half inch of milk chocolate colored head that quickly fades to nothing. Nose is soft but consistes of smoked meat and toffee. Enters the mouth with a slight smokey soured feel but quickly mellows to a rich burnt malt mouth hue. Extremely smooth and drinkable. Notes of bakers chocolate develop on the back of the tongue as the beer warms. Almost develops a creamy sweetness on the mouthfeel. This beer is hugely drinkable and one I will buy again soon."
"D: Not really balanced and jagged flavors that arent melding for me. Mouthfeel is hard and not full how Id like it. Not a bad beer but not a favorite."
"Pours a moderately dark black/brown with a quickly dissipating brown head. Light smoky smell. Taste is sweet up front. I taste beef jerky in this finish. I don't really taste any smokiness - not sure about the style here. The mouthfeel is very creamy. Very drinkable especially for a stout. This is really nice beer, though. It's a little sweeter than most stouts, but still has enough strength to satisfy."
"From a growler: Pours a flat black color with a medium thick and foamy brown head. Sticky patches of lacing. Strong and smoky roasted malt and coffee aroma. The body is rich and smooth and the smoky character is consistent but not overbearing. Roasted malt, dark chocolate and coffee flavors mesh very well. The finish is dry and smoky with a fair amount of hops peeking through. Not really anything to complain about with this one."
"12 oz bottle. This beer is a very deep brown to black color with a very small deep tan head that falls quickly to a ring around the top. This one is still, with no light working though it. The aroma is ashy roast with a maple syrupy sweetness that comes from the mild smokeyness that sits prevalent in the brew. The flavor is a little more mild than expected. It starts with the ashy roast that moves to a mild chocolate. A peppery spice comes next and blends with a mild pine hop and gives a hint of coffee on the finish. The smoke is really mild in the flavor, and I would have liked it to be a bit more forceful. Mouthfeel is moderate with no detectable carbonation. This is a nice stout. The peppery character is a little strange, but it is something I have noticed in a number of the stouts in the series."
"Dark and inky pour with a small tan head that leaves some patchy lacing. Aroma of chocolate, figs, anise, and a hint of smoke. Smooth and full bodied with an appropriate low carbonation. Taste is pleasantly complex. Dark roasty notes are prominent, with chocolate and coffee. Nuttiness and some fruity berry add a nice dimension and the subtle smokiness is just right. Very nice."
"Pours out jet black, like the others. Very little head, and no retention. Kind of a disappointment here. What's there is nearly brown. The aroma is smoky (maybe by the power of suggestion). Dark chocolate, too. Overall, nice. The flavor is meaty and, well, a little smoky. Faint hints of cranberry and coffee. Despite the lack of any head, it is nicely carbonated. Not as creamy as stouts can come, though. Goes down relatively easy. Overall, I liked One and Tres better, although this is still way better than Too was."
"Overall, I miss drinking stouts. So many are offered during the winter, and pulled in the summer. A good beer and a special treat."
"Fore! is a shout that golfers use to say 'heads up' (actually, down) if you don't want to be beaned by a potentially lethal projectile'. Fore Smoked Stout is the final beer in the Dark Horse Holiday Stout Series that anyone who is interested in good beer owes it to themselves to try. Since it's a seasonal, 'head's up' come fall."
"The folks at Dark Horse had sense enough to not make the smoke overwhelming and instead use it as a compliment to the beer's other flavors. This works very well, and it's one of the most well balanced smoked beers I've ever had."
"This is an interesting beer from Dark Horse brewing but has somewhat a thin and watery body for a Stout."
"Thanks to Lucy S for sending this to me."
"D: Almost sessionable. Very agreeable to the palate. Definitely worth seeking out each and every one of the 5 stouts in the series."
"Similar inky, thick, dark black body as the other DH stouts. Small, tight, dark cocoa head. Minor lacing. Mildly sweet roasted malt aromas, chocolate/cocoa beans, and a mild, but noticeable meaty smokiness. Not quite as smoky as I was hoping for, but it's still good. Meaty, smoky flavors right off the bat. Roasted coffee bitterness in the background. Hints of dark fruits before slightly metallic, mildly tart, smoky, peaty malt takes back over with escalating roasted bitterness in the finish. Delicious. Again, not Rauchbier smoky, but maybe just the right amount. Very drinkable, and dangerous, as I imagine that this is at least 7% abv! My favorite of the holiday stouts."
"Mouthfeel was medium to full bodied. Minimal carbonation."
"On tap at the dark horse brewpub. Pours very stout-y looking. dark with a small brown head. Nice lacing. Soft, roasted chocolate odor. Taste is really nice. smokey but in a black charcoal smoke way. This flavor lasts only a little while and transitions into a creamy milk stout taste with roasted malts. Smokiness comes back on the finish and is softer and more like a hickory smoke. Full mouthfeel...maybe a bit more like a porter than a stout in the mouthfeel though. A treat to have on tap."
"A great looking stout. It's deep opaque brown/black, with a dark tan head and exceptional lacing. Nose is nice smoky roasted malts, with tiny hints of chocolate. Taste is more of the smoky malts with reminders of beef jerky. Not too stong, just wonderfully smoky. Mouthfeel is good, drinkability is good."
"D- This beer has a light soft flavor that in not very interesting or exciting."
"drinkability: fine"
"Pours black with a dark brown head that was generated after a hard pour. Aroma of cocoa powder, chocolate and malt. Full-bodied mouthfeel. Roasted malt with some dark espresso-like coffee flavors. Smokiness is apparent, yet more subtle as opposed to a German Rauchbier, which I was expecting for some reason. Burnt malt with a feint bitter chocolate tone toward the back. The finish is mildly dry. Hearty, intense and enjoyable."
"Beyond opaque black color, with a small, filmy mocha colored head that quickly falls. Aroma is pretty expressive, with a nice balanced of peaty scotchy hints and chocolate, cocoa, caramel and coffee aromas. Mouthfeel is a bit thin and initially the flavor is completely lacking in both the front-palate and the mid-palate, until the finish yields rich scotch flavors, light smoke, chocolate, caramel, light malt bitterness and light sourness. I enjoyed the different segments together, but not as a whole. The mouthfeel is very thin, especially considering Dark Horses standards and the flavor, overall, isnt that enjoyable."
"Deep black in color-nice tan head-almost looks like oatmeal floating on top. Moderate aroma-somewhat chocolate like with a neat twinge of anise. Roasted flavor, some smokiness. Slight traces of oakiness and peat. The peat flavor is more prominant then the actual smoke to me. Lingering dryness. Good body. Very enjoyable beer. I give it high marks for drinkability though personally I could only do 2 or 3 in a sitting. Well worth a try-especially if you like smoked beers."
"I cannot taste any of the smoke. To be honest though, that's a small complaint when a stout tastes as good as this one, even sans the smoke that the bottle proclaims. Rich deep molasses is the star with chocolate chips and coffee getting supporting roles. The very back of the taste is somewhat reminiscent of smoke, but not strong enough to convince me that its really there. Very very tasty. Mouth is nice and smooth, with light carbonation. Any time I was craving a stout, this would do nicely I'm sure. A stout to revisit again and again ...if unlike me you can get it in your area. Thanks to Northertimber for this one!"
"Another one from DH that has really impressed."
"from he bottle. poured balck wit a brown head that left no lacing. aroma dark fruits malts, chocolate, molasses, cherries, had to wait until it warmed up for the smoke to come out. flavor the smoke came out 1st than a sweet chocolate, malt, dark sweet berries as it warmed the flavors got a little more robust. not too bad of a beer."
"Rounded and rich, this is a nice, solid stout perfect for winter drinking."
"Drinkability and Notes  Good drinkability for a stout, the smoke really mellows as I near the bottom of my glass. A well done beer that I like quite a bit and would recommend to anyone who likes the idea for a slightly smoky stout."
"This is a unique beer. Not like a Rauchbier, but along the same lines. Poured out to a black (and I do mean BLACK, as light did NOT pass through the glass whatsoever) appearance with minimal carbonation, this brew was near being flat. Not much of a head, but a thin layer of medium brown foam covered the top of the beer. No lace. Odors of salted olives were present, as was some generic smoke notes. Flavor was spicey with notes of black pepper, overcooked malts, and raw coffee. Some smoke toward the finish. Very heavy and filling mouthfeel. This is my first smoked beer, and look forward to seeing some others in the style. This beer is a good place to start. Worthy of a try."
"Thanks to for the bottle as part of the NCAA tourney pool. I've always thought that Dark Horse lived up to its name; a fantastic brewery from Michigan that just doesn't get mentioned in the same breath as Bell's, Founders, Jolly Pumpkin, etc, which is unfair because the beers that come out of Marshall stand up to the best beers out of the state. Fore is no exception; a very nice smoky stout that mixes the smoke well with a chocolate maltiness. This is a damn good one, as are the rest of the 3, and I'd be glad to get this one again."
"Slàinte!"
"Almost black body looks nearly blood red as it pours. Toffee colored head slowly builds to a quarterinch then fades to a ring at the edge of the glass. Slightly sweet aroma is topped by a respectable amount of smoked malt aroma that has a slightly sharp note, like the fire is still buring beneath the malt. This sharpness continues to the flavor, but then a very dry puckering sensation soon follows. Seems to be a great deal of bitternessbehind this beer. Grassy notes are intermingeld with the smoke, which nearly hides the malt sweetness at first. After a few sips, a bit more of the caramel and raosted malt notes come through. Strong notes of dark chocolate and espresso come through once the taste buds adjust to the smokiness. Mouthfeel is a bit thinner than I was hoping, but not bad in any way. Drinkablity is pretty good as well. Another nice offering from Dark Horse."
"Pours a pretty opaque black color with roughly a finger of brown head. Aroma is smokey, a little meaty, lots of roasted barley, and come coffee. Charcoal and woody smoke are first to my palate. Lots of roasted barley, and a little bit of a charred taste. Some coffee, and a little bit of very bitter chocolate. Good mouthfeel for this style, not too thick and not too thin. As far as smoked beers go, this is pretty damn good."
"This is certainly a BIG beer. Very balanced, but also very filling. A few of these would fill me up. Not so much a session beer, but this would be a great after dinner drink if the main entree is smoked fish or meats."
"This should be classified as a Stout, not a Rauchbier or Smoked Beer."
"Drinkability is good. Malt dominates any smoked hits so its very palatable. Relatively high ABV is just slightly present to let you know you are drinking a ""big"" beer."
"Pours an absolute pitch black with a medium brown head. Looks like a true, great stout. Looks quite viscous and thick. Mild smoky tones noticable. Rich, deep dark roasted malts are quite strong. Lots of caramel, coffee, and vanilla control the palate. A slight smokiness is noticable, but not too powerful. Very flavorful. Thick, coating mouthfeel, yet a subtle and dry finish. Quite tasty. Overall, a very well done stout. The mild smoke component adds to the complexity. I really enjoyed this beer. Definately worth a try. Thanks to Realale for this one."
"This is a bad-ass stout. These guys at Dark Horse haven't disappointed me yet. Wonderful. Highly recommended. This one will put hair on your chest."
"Cheers, inebrius!"
"Don't expect the perfumey, campfire smoke you get from those true to Bamberg style brews. Fore is all charcoal and burnt marshmallows and almonds browned through. Color is the signature Dark Horse non-color. Like chewing on a trail mix of peat ash and dried currants between draughts of tonic water. A toothsome beer for men of character."
"Yet another excellent beer from this underrated Michigan brewery. This one pours out to a dark as night black in the glass with a small head. The aroma is that of roasted malt and is similiar to other stouts, with Bell's Kalamazooo Stout's aroma coming to mind. I really liked the taste of this one. The smoked flavoring, while being over the top at first sip, mellowed into a wonderful finish that beckons for another drink. Again, a well brewed beer by this Marshall, Michigan brewer. Now if they would only get someone with some art skills to design their labels..."
"This one poured a vicious opaque black, i mean dark as a black hole. No head, barely a thin layer of foam extracted upon a vigorous pour. Exactly like 2002 Expedition. This is a smoked stout but the smoked part is not really that upfront with my taste buds. Slight tangy flavor that reminds me of barbeque sauce but not smoked like other smoked beers. But maybe that's a good thing. Quite thick but with low carbonation. The other flavors are pretty straight forward. Coffee is main with a bittersweet chocolate flavor. The smoked flavor comes in the aftertaste and picks up intensity the longer I sit between sips (which seems weird, but good). This was a quality brew which I must give dark horse some credit for their creativeness."
"Aromas and flavors raise memories of family cookouts. ""Aw crap, Auntie Jayne just charred the hell out of the ribs."" And that's about what the beer is like. It has a definite grilled flavor to it with a roasted chocolate finish. So really, it's like dinner AND dessert in a bottle. There's your spare ribs, and there's your chocolate -- all in one spot. How nice."
"Pours a thick jet black color, small bubbly brown head, smokey roasty malt aroma. Sweet burnt flavors, slight smoke flavor in the mix, full creamy mouthfeel that explodes with roasted goodness, I love it, another great one from this brewery."
"Smoked stout. Pours like you pulled the drain plug on an oil pan - black and thick. Brown head is a brief event dissapating into nothing within seconds. Aroma of coffee and slight smoke. Tastes like a bitter hickory stick. On the bitter side. A slight tangy aftertaste. Let it sit on your tongue for a while between sips to taste it all. Not tremendously complex to my tastebuds. My vote for best Michigan smoked beer is still Bell's Batch 5000. Still have to love the Fore label which looks homemade with a black and white charcoal like drawing. It looks like a homebrew label. We need all the local brewers we can get. Give it a try."
