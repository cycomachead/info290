"Not my favorite from New Belgium, but I wanna give another bottle a go around. I've always wanted to try a 3 Floyds, and being in alaska, it's the closest I'm going to get (unless anyone knows how I can score some Zombie Dust or Gumball Head)"
""
"O: Very unique to say the least, but can't say I'd go for it again."
""
"Even though I'm a huge fan of New Belgium and 3 Floyds (my first brewpub!), I wasn't terribly fond of this beer as far as taste goes. Still, it was certainly worth trying. I don't remember its specific qualities other than it being relatively viscous, very dark, and, of course, quite smoky. Oh yes, I am reminded that it was somewhat tangy as well. Palatable if sipped and consumed with some cheese. I only really like sharp cheddar, but I imagine it would go well with blue cheese for those who enjoy that."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I haven't had this style before, but I really like it. It's interesting and different, and very drinkable. I really like that smoked flavor with the slight sour tang. It really works for me. I will look for this again."
"The taste is 10/10 but I just wish the alcohol content was a little higher than 4.5% ABV"
""
""
""
""
"I hate that I'm forced to type."
""
"I think they did a pretty good job of matching the style they were going for.  Now we know why the style has been ""long-buried"".  Gratzers are disgusting and I will do my best to avoid drinking another."
""
""
"Still, that's a minor quibble for an ale that both surprised and surpassed my expectations from the moment I poured it into my Three Floyds-branded tulip-pint: a refreshing, light ale that belies its dark heart, an expressively oak-smoke wheat mellowed and well-matched by its cleanly-soured skeleton, and beer that seems it'd be perfect for a mild summer-day deep on the continent—presumably waiting for the zombie-apocalypse to reach Wielkopolska."
""
"Apparently smoked beers arent my thing..."
""
""
""
""
"When big names like New Belgium and 3 Floyds partner up, it's fair to expect big things and yet this Grätzer managed to exceed my expectations. While I don't have enough experience to speak to the authenticity of the recipe, I can say with certainty that it's among the most innately approachable, easily quaffed, and likely to be widely appealing smoked beers I've tried."
"A very interesting style, which melds the smoked malts and porter style body with a smooth mouthfeel. Love the generous pillowy foam head here, which retains through the pour. Complex layers dominate here with the result being a unique and enjoyable beer"
""
""
"This is a very successful brew. I can't say if it is authentic, I think it may be. Highly recommended (and it's underrated)."
"Poured from a 22 oz. bottle, into a Belgian tulip glass."
"With this being my first smoked beer I will not be going back for another. The initial taste is of fire smoke but the finish is that of cigarette smoke which I am not a fan and the lingering taste is that of a beer that was filtered through an ash tray. I am sure this is for some just not for me."
""
"Wasn't sure what to expect with this one - it's not as bad as everyone is making it out to be. Definitely a smokey/cigarette finish though. Love the label."
"First gratzer I've ever had - will definitely try again. Love the zombie bike riders on the label."
""
""
""
"Drinks okay, but doesn't deliver much in the way of good flavor.  A letdown like most of this series"
"Light body and light smoke. Very smooth and drinkable. I enjoyed this thoroughly."
""
""
""
"Overall an interesting and tasty beer.  This is about 1/2 way between Schwartzbier and Rauchbier."
""
"Pours very dark to near black, some haze, and tan colored head.  Lace settled to a thin layer.  Nose had a nice smoked bready aroma that had hints of cooked bacon.  Palate was surprisingly light in flavor, moderate smoke presence, bready, some good hop balance, and a toasty finish.  Very drinkable.  Wish I had Gouda in the fridge to pair."

"O - This was an interesting beer. This reminds me of a bitter porter. Good, but something I'd want all the time."

"Dark brown in color with a one finger head that lasts a while. Thick lace painted the glass during the session. Light smokey aroma with a mild roasted and smokey wheat flavor.  Some hints of coffee and roasted nuts come through near the finish. Nice bitterness and the beer has a dry aftertaste. Slow sipping but tasty."
""
""
"Poured a deep black body with brown highlights when held to light and two fingers of thick tan head. A very nice, stout-looking beer. Scents of roasted malt, rye bread, coffee, earthy, herbal hops and charred oak wood. Overall impression of aroma is of a uniquely robust aroma that is rich, roasty, smokey and very pleasant. Unique and very nice. Flavor begins bitter with notes of smoked malt, oak, charred wood, bitter black coffee and a slight sour tang. This moves into a middle that is very smokey, with notes of smoked wheat, tangy wheat malt and herbal hops. Finish is bitter with notes of bitter, herbal medicine hops, smoked malt, a slight tang, burnt black coffee and burnt oak wood. Aftertaste is bitter with notes of bitter herbal hops, smoked malt, burnt oak wood and burnt dark roast coffee. Overall impression of flavor is of a very bitter, very smokey flavor that is deep and strong, despite the beer's low ABV. Very nice and very pleasant to the right palate. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium-high carbonation and a slightly drying, woody mouthfeel. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a light, yet smokey, drying and woody beer. I hesitate to call it refreshing, it is more rich in spite of its light body and low ABV. Overall this is a very unique beer. It is rich, deep, bitter and smokey in both aroma and flavor. It is very bold and flavorful, despite its very low ABV. The mouthfeel aids the flavor and contributes to the light but full flavor of the beer. Very nice and well down."
""
"O. Not very good. Every time I burp it taste like cigarette buts. I’m to be burping up cigarette buts the rest of the night. The only thing I like about this beer is the bottle. I recommend skipping this one."
""
""
"Its bulk of wheat bread and associated doughy sweetness retreats quickly in finish and leaves the taste of toasted grain and sourness to continue duel it out even late on the palate. Growing spiciness of peppercorn elevates the toast and smoke and eventually outlasts the sourness in a dry and oaky aftertaste."
"There are some more detailed reviews that are very accurate below, but I would add that it is an exceptionally light beer for such a robust taste.  It is a mouthful with very interesting, roasty flavors, a nice sour finish and then...poof...its gone.  I agree with another reviewer that it is one of the best L of F to date."
"Overall this is an exceptional beer and a fantastic taste experience.  I highly recommend it as it is one of the all time best Lips of Faith versions to date."

"Shared with my father who prefers bock beers and scotch.  Pours black with 3 fingers of foamy tan head.  Was only down one finger after 5 minutes.  Smells like roasted malt and faintly of burnt wood.  Mouthfeel was clean and not too heavy with noticeable carbonation.  Taste is toasty, roasty malts and smoked wood.  No sour flavors despite the description on the bottle.  My father thought it tasted like ""a bass ale that someone put out a cigarette in"".  Oh well, I still liked it!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This one is interesting. A sour rauchbier? It's nice, but definitely not something I could drink all the time."

"Overall - very sessionable via the checked abv and minimal sweetness. A great fireside beer."

"Poured from a bomber into a snifter, the beer is a dark, brown to black coloring, with a light beige, fluffy, sparse head. Aromas are heavily roasted, with campfire qualities, toasted wheat, tangy sweetness, subtle bitter hops, and a solid dose of tang and sour at the end. Flavors are surprisingly smooth, with that campfire character toned down a bit, and balanced nicely with a subtle sourness, earthy notes, toasted grains, and tangy sweetness in the backbone. Light, smooth, mid-bodied, with a smoky and roasted aftertaste. The finish has a tangy sweet and solid charcoal linger on a smooth transition."

"O: 3.75 - Not a bad beer, but in a blind test, I'd probably call it a stout, maybe a robust porter. Hard  to find anything unique about this ""lost style""."
"Gratzer pours a black color with a large fluffy white head.  There is a big smokey aroma.  The taste has huge smoke notes, much like a smoked meat, and hints of sourness.  Really good body, and feel.  Overall, its very very good, a slightly sour smoke beer."
""
""
""
"Unusual, challenging but fairly rewarding rendition of a forgotten style. Worth trying for sure."
""
"Overall: I suppose I could lend a supportive shrug for the modest alcohol and its ease of drinkability, but this is an unimpressive beer that's surprisingly absent in the flavor department."

""
""
""
""
"I don't know what kind of body a gratzer's supposed to have, though it seems it works best light and medium might be pushing it but could still work.  This one borders them, but the feel is thin.  It runs pretty smooth but only has a little crispness to it.  It goes fairly dry, and just a very gentle tang runs on the tongue from the sourness."

"Taste brings a considerably stronger ashy/smokey presence than did the aroma. Acrid like black coffee. Whatever that subtly sweet note on the nose was comes in the back end here to give it a crisp fresh feeling. Dominated by the charcoal/ash/smoke. I... really enjoy that? Kind of amazing that it’s only 4.5% as well: it seems uncommon for brews of that ABV to have this level of flavour and heft to them. Don’t know why that would be, but it seems to be the case. If I were medieval royalty just drinking beer all day instead of water, I’d drink this."

"As a proud polish immigrant son, I was really excited to see a polish beer style I didn't know existed.  I was happy with the beer, but non-plussed overall.  Good black malt flavor and some mellow smoke.  Light body and easily drinkable overall.  This beer was made for regional tastes and big pours, and it reflects.  In the modern american brewing landscape of one offs and limited batches, it sadly fails to impress when beer geeks expect a blast of this or that.  As an overall experience, it was basically a schwarzbier with a touch of bacon.  Nowhere near a rauchbier, maybe if there was a line between schwarzbier and rauchbier, this would be 25% rauchbier from the schwarzbier side.  If you released this in the 80's, it would blow minds and put your brewery on the map, but in the modern age of wild ales and 13% bourbon stouts, it fails to register for citizenship in crazytown."

"22 ounce bottle into signature tulip glass, bottled on 4/24/2014. Pours pitch black color with a 2 finger dense and rocky khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Dense soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, toast, wheat, wood smoke, dark bread, light char, nuttiness, herbal, and smoke/roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted/bready malt and smoke notes; with great strength. Taste of chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, toast, wheat, wood smoke, dark bread, light char, light nuttiness, herbal, and smoke/roasted earthiness. Slight tartness/roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, cocoa, roast, coffee, toast, wheat, wood smoke, dark bread, light nuttiness, and smoke/roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and robustness of dark/roasted/bready malt and smoke flavors; with a nice roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and lightly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected for 4.5%. Overall this is a very nice smoked beer. All around good complexity and robustness of dark/roasted/bready malt and smoke flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"Poured from a bottle into a Dogfish Head pint glass. Pours a very dark mahogany brown with a fine, half finger light brown head with great retention and sheets of lacing. Aroma of smoky toasted grain, cocoa, nuts with a bit of meaty smokehouse. Flavor starts similar to the aroma, with smoky toasted wheat with light hints of cocoa and nuts, develops a bit of tartness as the flavor thins out a bit, exposing the smokiness more clearly. Long lingering smokehouse aftertaste with hints of bacon. A quite nicely made interpretation of a Gratzer leaning towards the theory that this style was slightly sour. I'm not a sour fan, but the light tartness in this was pleasing and fit well with the smoke. I liked this more as I drank the glass and as much as the more lightly flavored attempt at a traditional version of this from Professor Briem. Nicely done and a successful Lips of Faith experiment. Possibly a bit challenging for those not familiar with the history of this rare, nearly extinct style."

"O-  4.5 This beer has a nice mellow dark roast character but more mellow and lighter than a typical stout and some nice tartness and smoke note that offer nice support from the background.  Good depth but light and sessionable."

"Overall: Relatively mild given the dark color and smoke, but still full flavored. Interesting while easily drinkable."
"I've missed this one a few times at a few local places, so it was serendipitous that I'd find it here at Tap House as part of this beastly Lips of Faith takeover thing. That and Svengoolie. Love it. Anyway, this stuff pours a sorta/kinda murky smoke ash topped by a finger or so of, well, ashen foam. The nose comprises oak smoke, light wood, clove, and a vague sense of cracked wheat in the distance. The taste brings in more of the same, the smoke taking a strong lead, but then the underlying slightly-sour wheat comes in near and through the finish, mixing with the smoke in a fairly enjoyable manner. It's never fully seamless, but it still mostly works. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, a nice bit of wheaty smoke. 'Nuff said."
"O - Again, can't speak to style, but this beer is a bit too astringent for my tastes. Could be nice paired with a big plate of ribs slathered with a sweet BBQ sauce, or with a fuller bodied, sweeter malt bill. It may not be to style, but maybe there's a reason this style died."

"D: This was a very interesting beer. The scent and taste were great, but the body was weak. The finish was smooth, so it was easy to drink. The beer just seemed conflicted, should be heavier or lighter than it was. Fun to try once."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, as a huge fan of smoked beers this one is wonderfully unique. I love the intense smokiness but there really is a good going on underneath and I feel the characteristics change as the beer warms and my palate adjusts to the smoke. I very good beer that is worth seeking out if you're a fan smoke."

"Overall: This beer gets high marks from me because it's the perfect amount if smoke and doesn't overpower. Very easy to drink."
"Pitch black pour with a tan one-finger head. Has a really nice aroma of coffee beans, light chocolate and smoke. The taste mostly follows the nose with a bit of coffee bitterness upfront followed by a smoky taste. There's a light sour taste at the end."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I like this quite a bit. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but I like the smoky quality, and also the lightness. Not sure if it's sessionable, because it has some pretty strong flavors that could grow tiresome over time. But I'm enjoying this as much or more than I was expecting to."

"Overall, believe it or not, this is our first taste of the “Lips of Faith” series. We’ve been under New Belgium’s distribution net for over a year now, so it’s a bit embarrassing, as many a good release has come out between now and way back when. To make matters worse, this is our first grapple with a Grätzer. Yes, yes, we’ve had plenty of smokes and rauchs in the past, but nothing really like this traditional Polish style. The thing that stands out most about this one is how dark it is, on all fronts. It smells like your elderly, pipe-puffing grandfather’s tweed jacket. You know the one, with the sewn on elbow patches. The flavoring departs from this a bit, but you keep that same, aged essence. It is hard to tell what is “New Belgium” about this, and what is “Three Floyds”, but whatever each contributes here, it works. The smoke stands out nicely, and from what we have researched, they stylistically succeed. The best thing, again, is probably its aroma, as that robustness is lost a bit through the taste, but either way, we would certainly buy this to keep us warm all through the winter."

"But, am I wrong? Smoky? Barely. Robust? Hardly. The sour is slight, though, I'll give them that, but the bitterness does not bite. Sometimes poetics, when used gratuitously, betray the brew."

"I'm gonna cellar the other bottles I bought and see if that might mellow the smoke flavor a little, which tends to be overpowering. Overall a good attempt but fell a little short of expectations. Eager to see how aging will affect it. 3.3/5"

"O: $10 or maybe $9 for the bomber and not worth it in my opinion. Sometimes I wish collaborations were in 12 oz. bottles. Just not a style that you really want 22 oz. of, but I guess one to share in the disdain. I had to help some people move (they lived on the 3rd floor of a house) and they had a ton of stuff, so I needed a lot of beer (went for this over the only other beer in my fridge, a can of Nomader Weisse). 8 oz. are going to make pancakes tomorrow."
"This is actually a great summer beer, with the lower alcohol and dry taste, plus the exuberant sudsiness. From the 22 oz bottle purchased at Mayfair Liquors in Denver."

"22 ounce bottle, label says best enjoyed by May 2015. Served in a mug, the beer pours dark brown with about an inch tan head. Head retention and lacing are both good. I like the aroma, the brew smells like chocolate, coffee, smoked meats/malt, and dark bread/bready malt. It tastes like bittersweet chocolate, smoked meat/malts, dark bread, wheat, wood, and there's also a nice light tart finish. None of the flavors overpowered the others. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit creamy and slick with a good amount of carbonation. I don't think I've ever had a traditional grätzer before so I really can't compare this brew to one. With that being said, I thought this was a good beer and would like to try it again. $8.99 a bomber."

"Pours a hazy dark reddish-brown with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, caramel, and smoke aromas. Taste is much the same with earth, cocoa, and smoke flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of smoke and earth bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is much different than other beers I have had made in the same style."

"Pours a hazy dark brown, opaque in glass, thick dense tan foam, big chunks of lace down the glass. Smell: porter-y... medium roast coffee, note of oak smoke, milk chocolate, black plum. Minimal floral hop character. Taste: roasty and snappy + smoked grain, baking chocolate, mildly herbal and earthy, with a little tart stone fruit sweetness. There's a very mild acidic bite throughout. Light bodied with a relaxed but fluffy feel. Really quite interesting, tasty and refreshing."
""
"Gratzer starts with decent tan foam head that leaves good lacing in the glass. The liquid is an opaque black liquid that definitely matches the theme well. On the nose I smell sweet smoked barley with a hint of floral hops. The flavor is overpowered with so much smoke it is nearly undrinkable for me. The mouth feel is certainly excellent, but overall this beer is a bit too simple on the nose with way too much smoke on the tongue to be recommended. If you love the flavor of smoke you'll be in love otherwise steer clear. Both companies have better options."
"Pours a medium brown with white head, decent retention. The aroma starts with heavy smoked malt. Notes of campfire, burnt wood, and other things associated with smoke come to mind. Perhaps a bit overdone in the smoke department. Some roast comes through as well, no apparent lacto on the aroma. The taste starts with chocolate and smoke. Started like a smoke forward smoked porter, not too bad, nothing crazy. Then comes a *hint* of lactobacillus which just makes this beer weird. It doesn't really come across as being tart or sour, just that implied hint of sour wheat. This is followed by some lager yeast notes. Mouthfeel is light and well carbonated. I give this beer props for being unique, but it certainly lacks in the realm of balance. I think a heavier lacto profile and a bit less malt would have really made for an interesting beer."
""
""
""

"O- Not a bad offering, but not my favorite either. I haven't had a ton of polish beers, but I'm at least happy I gave this a try. Not planning on buying any more."

"O- lots of flavor for a sessionable brew, wasn't expecting the lacto, but somehow am left wanting more."

"First impressions were a smoked porter. First sip was interesting. A little thinner than I expected. Smoked oak is very present throughout. Hops are minimal on the tongue and the sour note is more prevalent than the bottle leads you to believe. I had hoped for a bigger beer. Overall a drinkable beer."

"nothing like i know gratzers to be. lightly smoked wheat based beers, usually fluffy and blonde. i guess it isnt written in the rules anywhere that it cant be dark wheat malt, and thats exactly whats going on in this three floyds joint effort. pours like a ported, dark dark brown, barley letting light pass, and sporting over an inch of tan milkshake textured head. the nose on it is only subtly smoky, not as intense as expected, but the malts are real roasty, and this again seems more like a robust porter than a gratzer as i know the style. the flavor also shows only a little smoke, its there all the way through, but it isnt the main flavor agent. the chewy dark grains are, and they crowd out the more delicate wheat and smoke properties i was looking for. surprised its not 10% abv, given the involvement of three floyds on this thing, the low abv makes it rather drinkable, despite being a confusing experience. tough to call this one a true gratzer i think, but i like it because it is something different. one of the better lips of faith releases in awhile, but dont expect anything conventional here."
