"Poured into teku glass very aggressively: moderate head which dissipates quite quickly leaving some lacings.This thing is pitch black! No reflexes even when put in front of a lightbulb... Smells like smoked bacon, hiding black olives, some medicinal notes, and dark caramel. Tastes like it smells with slightly bitter and long aftertaste, where the smokiness is rising up again at the very finish. The carbonation is moderate and the mouthfeel is quite syrupy, in a pleasant way. Never had one of this style before, but overall quite an interesting experience, though also a bit awkward!"
"Pours a healthy two finger head of dark tan foam, delicate in appearance, almost all microfoam with a mottled surface. The liquid is a rich brown hue, opaque although you can see a great deal of hyperactive tiny bubbles rushing towards the surface. The nose is as advertised, huge smokiness, peaty with a saline quality as well as gaminess, old school plastic band-aids, there are some chocolaty notes, all of the above wipes out any fruit which might be there, general pungency lasts for some time. Medium-bodied, creamier texture than expected, the smokiness prevents excess sweetness from building and also aids in gluing it to your palate. Charred campfire wood, grill fat, tar, more peat than straight-up earthiness. The carbonation is as strong as the visuals suggest, this helping to relieve some monotony. More chocolate, caramel coming though here. Perhaps moments of plum and, oddly, apricot. Releases well and does not force itself on you, for its category not heavy handed. Given its relative intensity and higher alcohol, this is one I could drink more than one in a single sitting."

"If only it wasn't so sweet, instead leaving more space for the smoked malts to shine, this would've been a real gem. Pity."

"Dark. Almost no head. Smells super smoky, like a German rauchbier. Tastes like smoked... bacon. And maybe chocolate. Tasty. Body is medium. Surprisingly drinkable."

"O: most, if not all, of De Molen dark ales have pretty much the exact same flavor profile, just kissed with a aura of whatever adjunct added or barrel aged in... not knockin' them - whatever base beer they brew here is killer - some really pop, others are just good... i don't know why they file this under ""German-style"" - doesn't taste like anything from Germany I've had... regardless, the mixture of peat- and beechwood-smoke malts clashes a bit - doesn't really add any dimension to the beer... still a fine sipper though"

"Bottled 5/22/12. Definitely a Scotch-y, smokey smell to it, and maybe some port wine or grape to a lesser extent. Sweet up front, followed by some grapeor maybe some sort of berry-type flavor. Smoke just a tiny bit later with a hint of slight bitterness. Aftertaste is a bit like ash, or salami."

"Earthy, smoky and splendid. I loved this beer."

"The smoke characteristics are up-front yet not overboard. Smooth drinking, malt-forward beer with a definite smoke and alcohol background. Nicely balanced overall. Not overly complex compared to a Schlenkerla variety of a rauchbier, but unmistakably a very good example of the smoked beer art."

"Pours very dark brown. Looks cloudy but it's hard to tell. Head is smallish and beige. Fades pretty quickly. Little to no lacing. The aroma has a lot more smoke than expected. Otherwise, there's a rich caramel/molasses malt sweetness with some chocolate and oak. A touch of grapes and plums. Smoke is the star, though. Little roast. Lots more smoke in the taste. Pretty similar to the aroma in other respects, as well. Moderately sweet. It's a bit meaty with some dark malt fruitiness. Mild bitterness in the finish. Some tannic oakiness dries things out. Mouthfeel isn't quite as full as I'd like for the flavors. It's not thin; it just could use a creamier feel as a backdrop for the flavors. Carbonation is relatively low. Decent beer. Nothing really stands out as particularly good, though. The smoke flavor is nice but kinda takes over. The other flavors are too far in the background."

"O: The beer is remarkably easy to drink because the alcohol is well hidden from the taste and the smokey flavors do not overpower the taste."
"D - Really nice smoked beer with good smoke flavor that is not overpowering."
"Overall, this is a weird one. It's pretty good though, as long as you aren't turned off by the smoked ham-ness."

"Not a bad brew, but for the money, go with a German smoked beer or Alaskan"

"I don't believe I got the Bruichladdich edition, but I wouldn't really know anyway... Regardless, this stuff pours a deep, dark sienna topped by a finger of relatively short-lived glowing off-white foam. The nose comprises bacon-y smoke, light Band-Aid, light roasted malts in the background, and a vague sense of molasses The taste really ups the Band-Aid ante with its smoke component, with the dry biscuit ad very light roasted malts unable to do much to assuage my tastebuds. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid (verging on almost-watery) feel. Overall, this beer just didn't work for me. I believe the peated malt just did too much and didn't quite gel with either the beech-smoked malts or the regular malts surrounding it. One thing's for sure: it didn't gel with my sensibilities much..."

"Pours a deep maple with a shade of grey beneath a slightly off white creamy head. The most prominent aroma of course is the leathery-smoke quality which overwhelms your senses in the best way possible. Notes of creamy milk chocolate & caramel along with some oak as well. Although the smoke is the main player in flavor as well, the darker malt flavors are initially much more pronounced; not quite rich, but it does add some depth to this ale. Hints of apple and grape, precede a slightly dry finish with more leather in the aftertaste. Full bodied The texture certainly distinguishes this one from a lagered Rauchbier; much fuller and rounded. A really nice smoked ale that I would recommend, especially on tap on account of its added smoothness."

"O: On the whole, a solid, well made, and drinkable beer."

"Overall - this is a crazy beer. I've had Rauchbiers and lots of smoked porters, and plenty of Islay Scotch, and this is probably the most intense smoky beverage experience I've had. Impressively there are still some nice flavors under the smoke, but it's still super-intensely smokey."
"Poured from a 330ml bottle. This bottle produced a ridiculous amount of thick beige head no matter how carefully it was poured. That said, it really provided quite a whiff of the smokey goodness. There's lots of sweet bacon & leather on the nose. It's oddly enticing. The taste, however, is unbelievable. Doesn't seem like it would work, but the dark fruits, chocolate and smoke flavours are balanced and integrated with a lovely bit of sweetness that is gently knocked on the head by the bitter finish. So complex and interesting, even if you're not a fan of smoked beers."
"330ml bottle. ½ Pint glass. Enjoyed on apr´12. Nice deep crimson in color. Beige, close & dense froth. Copious, rocky head.Piney aromas, cask wood hues & slightly chocolate fragancy. Gentle smoky touch at first sip. Sweet toasted malts & dark fruit notes. Burnt fudge chocolate hints. Silky & bitter palate. Hoppiness in the middle shows a no bothering oily flavor while lingers into the finish. Medium body, soft carbonation. Smoke & cask wood on the aftertaste. Incredible well balanced & voluptuous flavors. ABV is just a gentle warming sensation masked inside a flavorful beer. Once again De Molen is a winning horse."
"Overall this is a surprisingly easily drinkable meal in a cup. The only real downside is the rather explosive head that makes pouring this beer in one go a real challenge, even with a large tulip."

"Given the awkward first impressions, I'm glad I powered through it all, to get to the real goods - a pungent chocolate malt offering, with more subtle smoked beer leanings - making it a much more drinkable affair than initially imagined."
"I like the smokey chocolate notes but it lacks the intensity and complexity of some of my favorite smoked malt ales"
""

"Tasted a little tame to me, nothing really jumped out and wowed me here like some other de molen beers."
"Overall: A pleasant beer, but not really what I expected from a smoked beer. I would say that the Bamberg malt should be doubled!"
""
"Opens up into a very decent smoked brown ale (not quite Schlenkerla but you can see it from here) but seems like a lot of trouble to get there."
"Overall; great balance and nice smokiness that wasn't over the top, but there just enough to add some additional complexity."
"O - Loved this one, The smokeyness is really significant and I would liken this to a genuine Rauchbier."
"Grows on me.Big thick and substantially smokey. Very brown colour with some retained head. The malt is secondary, the hops are there and subordinate. Not coughing smoke, but its right up there. Decent drinkability if sipped over a long meal.Thanks Luc."
"O/D - Not too shabby. It seemed more like a stout when I was drinking it. Not too sweet, mild smoke. Worth a shot."
"This is an interesting smoked beer. I can't quite make up my mind about the smoke taste. I stand by ""acrid"" as a descriptor but I waffled between hating and liking it. Worth a shot."
" D : smooth and very drinkable"
"Bottle: Poured dark copper with light haze color ale with a small foamy head with OK retention and some lacing. Aroma of smoked malt is dominant and quite enjoyable. Taste is also a solid mix between a lightly sweet malt backbone and some huge peat smoked malt with some extra dry smoke also noticeable in the aftertaste. Body is about average with OK carbonation and no alcohol was apparent. Very good assembling of different smoked notes and I am sure this would pair well with smoked Gouda though I didn't have any."
"A nice smoked beer here which is different to some of the smoked beers out there."
"Way too much carbonation. Great apart from that."
"Yeah, quite an enjoyable beer. Curious flavours done well, finely crafted into a pleasant beer."
"d - I thought this was an ok beer, but kind of weird in that it taste smokey and sweet. Not my favorite smoked beer and probably wouldn't order it again."
"Jet black with a substantial head and sufficient lace. Average head retention. Apple aroma with a bit of smoke. Fruity sweetness, as well. A bit of carbonation bite up front. This fades to a middle that has apple and prune sweetness with a subtle hint of smoke. Back end is a bit on the sour side and noticeably dry. Medium light mouthfeel. Not your ordinary smoked beer, and the smoke characteristics are very subdued. Alcohol sweetness is present in the finish."
"This is a really damn good smoked beer. Probably one of my favourites. It has this lovely sweetness to connect everything, but the delicate smokiness takes the lead. Really interesting and very drinkable."
"D: Cool beer, it would go great with BBQ, glad to try it. If you like Alaskan Smoked Porter and Schlenkerla Rauchbier you have to try this, almost an imaginary blend."
"The beer is quite drinkable for such a strong brew and I may revisit it just to make up my mind"
"Notes: This has less of the pork/BBQ smokey taste than a Rauchbier. The woody/peat smoke combines with some more vinous and tart fruits. This makes for an interesting flavor, although I would say I slightly prefer the BBQ type of smoke. Not a bad beer, but it's not really worth searching for."
"Drinkability is good and the ABV is well-hidden. Overall I like this one."
"It goes down quite well, could drink a few in a sitting."
"33cl bottle. Gusher. Pours a solid milk-chocolate brown with a much-too-large light brown head. Smells heavily of brown sugar and ripe dark fruits like plum. Vinous and spicy. Alcohol is only noticeable in the warming. Tastes of roasty malt and brown sugar/molasses. Vinous again in the taste. Warming alcohol and spice. Starts sweet but finishes surprisingly dry. Medium-full body. A nice digestif."
"Taste is full of coffee, roasted with distinct cold coffee notes. This adds a nice maltbitterness on top of the normal bitterness, which is not extremely high, but does give an extra kick. If I am not mistaking this beer has coffee in it. This does not take over the beer, but adds an extra depth to the dark taste of the beer."
