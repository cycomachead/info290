"Very disappointed with this one.  The smoke felt way off.  Almost like the smoke came from old bark.  Bitter and acrid. Not sure how the beer I drank got 100 from the bros."
""
"Taste and smell bad. Overall average porter"
"This is a black, this'll brew with a tan head.  The smell is moderately smokey, like a smoldering campfire, and a roasted malt scent underneath.  Balanced...medium bitterness.  Some smoke beers overdo it, and are too dry and acrid.  This brew, however, is well made and rewarding."

"O - It's a pretty solid smoked porter. If I could get this regularly here in Las Vegas, I think I would probably purchase this one again."
"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, no bottle dating. Pours clear very dark reddish brown color with a 1-2 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big chocolate, caramel, brown sugar, smoked meat, roasted malt, toast, biscuit, light coffee, light nuttiness, herbal, and toast/smoke earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance of dark/bready and smoked malt notes; with good strength. Taste of chocolate, caramel, brown sugar, toast, biscuit, smoked meat, light raisin, light coffee, light nuttiness, herbal, and toasted earthiness. No bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, caramel, brown sugar, toast, biscuit, smoked meat, light raisin, light nuttiness, herbal, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a bit. Nice balance of dark/bready malt and moderate smoked malt flavors, but lacking in robustness; zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy, smooth, and crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice smoked porter. Good balance of dark/bready malt and moderate smoked malt flavors; and very smooth to drink. Not as robust or smokey in the flavor as I had hoped for, but nicely enjoyable otherwise."
"OK, I’m a fan of rauch beers and porters, so maybe I was expecting too much. While there is definitely a pleasant amount of smokiness in this beer, the only characteristics of a porter present are the color and palate. Perhaps the brewing process for this beer has changed since the 2004 award or perhaps my expectations are too high; either way, this beer is mediocre at best. The fizzy, completely diminishing head detracts from the appearance (and my enjoyment) of this offering."

"O- I really enjoyed this beer! I wasn't expecting the meaty flavors in the least, but I was pleasantly surprised how well it worked. I would have this again in a heartbeat."
""
"Overall it's good. It's a drinkable porter and the smoke makes it interesting."
"Overall: Being my second smoked beer I've had, this one I like. This would be an awesome after meal drink. Nothing I would want to session, but a relaxation brew. Recommend."
""
""
""
"O: I never thought I would find myself saying I regret drinking a beer, but alas here we are. I felt sick to my stomach afterward. Maybe I got a terrible batch, as others seem to like it, but this was a violent assault on my taste buds, and later, my GI tract."
""
""
"O - Good Smoked porter, just wish it had more potency in the flavor."
""
""
""
"O: This is not your average smoked parter—it has a strong amount of smoked peat in the aromas akin to something you would expect from a stronger stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: a rich, smoky porter that will work great with beef and other meats."
"Overall, I really like this. Just a step below the true German Rauschbier it has true character."

"D - I enjoyed this, as it wasn't overpoweringly smoked and had some nice balance and depth to it. There's a hint of a diacetyl that might bother some, but I wasn't particularly bothered. Probably wouldn't have more than one in a session, but a beer I'd drink again."
""
""
"Why did I wait so long?"
""
""
"Was surprised to find this beer in Ohio, but glad I did. I think the aroma from pouring the beer into the glass is worth it alone. The taste is just so full of flavor, but the smoke aroma doesn't overpower the taste when I totally thought that it was going to. I do alot of grilling and smoking of pork shoulder ribs and well anything that you might want to eat so the aroma of the smoke just keeps taking me back to my last time that I had the smoker fired up. Surprisingly , it is also very refreshing as well as smooth. As others have described it as having a meaty feel in your mouth I would agree."
""

"This one's also pretty good. Deep dark brown color with a smooth silky texture and meaty mouthfeel, medium carbonation, decent head retention and some mediocre lacing patterns. It's got that ""salty ham smoke"" going on in spades as well as a sludge-y molasses glaze sweetness on the side of cigarette ash and bitter chocolate... Unusually beefy beer, makes you want to sip some water on the side. This one is worth finding and trying."
""
"A dark brown in color with a thin tan head. Aromas of BBQ and some coffee. Taste is smokey, creamy, with some dark bread in the middle, and a piney finish. Mouthfeel is smooth. The carbonation levels are a bit low. Overall an excellent porter that I would get again."

"Overall- I'll be drinking this again, and now that its about to be winter, probably soon. It's available in several places in my area, and for the price of a couple pints at the bar, you get a six pack. I think this is pretty decent quality stuff. Try it if you like porters. You won't be disappointed."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, this beer had a huge smokey aroma though one could detect a certain sense of creaminess in the aroma. To say the least, the smell made me really want to drink this one. The appearance was a murky brownish black. There was nothing particularly exciting about the appearance. Not much in the way of head, but some thickness was apparent. The initial taste was smokey, bacony, and mildly buttery with creaminess. In other words, the beer has a little of everything that is bad for your health in it, without actually including it. At the risk of being cliché, the beer was uncommonly smooth for a porter. The mouthfeel was almost closer to a milk stout with a little less thickness. The pleasantry continues in the aftertaste with a smokey bacon note. As expected, there is little carbonation so the smokey bacon notes hang around nicely. I only bought one bottle of this at the liquor store, but will probably get a sixer next time I see it."
"I think this drinks wonderfully and fits the bill absolutely perfectly for a smoked porter. I've had way too many that had so little smoke to them that they tasted like a regular porter. Not this little guy. The smoke is there, but as mentioned earlier, it has a nice balance with the base beer. Wonderfully done and I will be a returning customer to this beer."
""

"Pours a black color. 1/4 inch head of a tan color. Slight retention and slight lacing. Smells of strong smoke (reminiscent of a wood fire:) ), hops, pale malt, slight roasted malt, and hint of sweet malt. Fits the style of an American Porter but, wood :) fit into the smoked beer category better. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of strong smoke, pale malt, hint of hops, hint of sweet malt, hint of yeast, and a hint of metallic flavor. Overall, the body is mostly smoke first, then nothing else arises. The aroma is amazing though, and in itself would make this worth a try. I wish the body could more closely match the aroma."

"Overall I thought that this was a good beer and a good example of a Smoked Porter, both the Porter and the smoke aspects were noticeable while being nicely balanced. This beer had good drinkability, it went down pretty smooth for a smoked beer and I could see having one or two of these with some bbq ribs. What I liked most about this beer was the great balance it had and the awesome aroma, they made this beer pretty good. What I liked least about this beer was the appearance and the mouthfeel, they were both a little rough around the edges and could use some work. I would buy this beer again when looking for a smoked beer that it not too smokey, it was nicely priced, and I recommend this is as a good smoked beer for beginners. This is the third beer I have had from O'Fallon, I wasn't a big fan of their Cherry Chocolate Beer, but I liked their Black Hemp and I also liked this beer, I'll be looking for more beers from them, good job guys, this is a good and solid Smoker Porter."
"mine had a different label, and said made in stevens point, WI, which might be another location or something, very little info online about this. however, i enjoyed this it st. louis as a local beer. hmmmm. anyways, it smells like a campfire. almost rauchbier heavy on the smoke, very earthy and malty, but somewhat less roasty and coffee/chocolatey as i expect a porter to be. flavor is totally owned by the smoke, which is a good thing. nice sweeter english style malts back it up, but again there is this strange absence of dark beer flavors. its somewhat more like a smokey amber or something, rather than a true porter. feel is a little too light in the body for me, felt watery a bit, due to lack of carbonation. with a better feel this could be really outstanding. the flavor is great, but it also isnt a porter in my mind, not enough of the dark rosted malts to qualify. overall a pretty good style jumper. worth a try."
""

"Clear dark brown in color. Mildly translucent. Forms a smallish almost tan colored head that sticks around for a bit. Very light lacing. Aroma is unsurprisingly dominated by the scent of smoke with notes of heavily roasted malts, burnt coffee, and a touch of vanilla. Taste is much of the same. Mildly sweet dark malts, smoke, roasted malts, dark fruits, vanilla, and a dry campfire astringency on the finish. On the heavier side of medium in body with lighter carbonation. Mild bitterness. Overall a good beer that improved greatly as it warmed."
""
""
"Being fairly inexpensive, it is a good value, and given its' uniqueness, I recommend the beer and intend to buy it again."
""
"i was expecting a bad beer, but i got something average and drinkable."
""
"Taste is definitely wood-smoky. This one sweetens and mellows as it warms a bit. Quite tasty, distinctive, and recommended."

"O - a solid beer from start to finish."
""
""
"Seems like a possible infection, as it seems like a shell of its former self."
""
"Drinkability- The assault that the smoked qualities leave in your mouth make this something that I would avoid drinking multiples of. It is not off-putting, but the smokiness definitely asserts itself."
"Jet black with a slight tan colored head that quickly settles to a thin skim with a few lazily popping bubbles. Big, muscular smokiness with a definite ham and bacon quality that rivals the great Rauchbiers of Germany. Big and smoky, I really dig the smoke effect on this one. Underlying roasty Porter flavors are crushed by the mighty smoke. A think a bit more heft would make this beer nearly perfect but I'm nit-picking... this beer is a smoke lovers delight. I like this bold flavored beer and I like that O'fallon didn't play it safe with the recipe."
""
""
""
"Overall, an easy drinking, subtly smoked, well balanced smoked porter."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- The buttery-sweet nature of this beer that is a porter first with smoke qualities make it quite a delight to drink. The palate could be a little more complex like the nose, but regardless, this is a damn good beer."
"(PS - Can Houston get some love here?!)"
""
""
"Poured from the bottle a dark reddish brown/nearly black color with a good brown head. Aromas of dark chocolate, light smoke, roasted malt and coffee. On the palate, this one is medium bodied and rich, with flavors of roasted malt, dark chocolate and cocoa."
"This beer is makes me happy. On a fall day this beer is spot on. It's the best smoked beer I've ever had (not that I've had many) and I'll enjoy looking forward to it's appearance every fall."
"O - I was oversold when I asked for a ""good Rausch"" and was recommended this. The ""smoke"" here isn't much beyond what I would expect from any Porter. Besides that, it tastes incredibly artificial. A misnomer of a beer for sure. Maybe it took a bad ride on it's way to MI?"
"Overall: Liquid pork ribs in a bottle but somehow it works. Quite a nice, unique, creative beer. Very appropriate for a St. Louis based brewery (though brewed in WI)."
"I certainly get the smoke, but it isn't overpowering. I could have gone for a bit more smoke flavor."
"Overall, this is an easy beer to drink. The subtleties are what make it good when combined with the smoke without being overpowering. I could certainly sit down and have a couple of these."
"O - Glad I picked it up, not quite as smokey as New Holland's Dragon's Milk but a very enjoyable beer nonetheless"
"Pours a slightly see through brown colour with thin tan head. Smells of lots of smoke with some mild roast. Smoke dominates a lot of the flavour, but there is some chocolate in there too. Still has a nice sweetness. Fairly light body for a porter, but drinkable. I enjoyed this beer."
"Overall, I really like it. Smoke might fall just short of some of the top-tier porters, but NOT by much. Everyone should try this brew!"
"i love me a good smoke beer. it just reminds me of sitting around the campfire eating baked beans and hot dogs just roasted on a stick. but i have to say i have made beer with malts that i smoked myself and my favorite wood to smoke malts with was definitely apple. i knew it was a shot in the dark that this beer would deliver apple smoke, but the peat delivers a nice flavor."
"D/O- Every sip made me want another. The look and smell left something to be desired but overall a solid beer from O'Fallon."
"The color was deep amber and creamy head which laced ok. The nose was common of most porters there is a definite smoked/hickory aroma. Roasted malt with a touch of coffee. The taste had roastyness with some hints of chocolate and coffee. Fairly easy on the mouth could drink a few of these and then tire of the taste."
"O- This was a nice smoked ale. Nothing top notch in my book but better than average. The smoke really drives this beer and for that it makes it a little one trick pony. The ABV is low enough you could drink many of these but the smoke flavor might tend to be a little much for most people."
"D: For as heavy as it may look, it's incredibly easy to drink and satisfying at that. I've had smoked beers before and they did nothing for me, in fact, I had made up my mind before drinking it that I probably wouldn't like it. I couldn't of been more wrong! I can't wait to fire up my smoker this summer and enjoy this beer next time I smoke a rack of ribs!"
"Overall this is one of the better beers I have had in this style. The problem is, it is not really a style I enjoy greatly. The smokey flavor is present, but it is not completely overpowering like other smoke beers I have had. If smokey beers is something that you like, then you should definitely check out this beer."
"Nothing like enjoying some fine tunes and brews before rocking into Pee-Wee's Big Adventure (classic). One of those brews (this one, if you couldn't get that) pours a dark ruby-tinted black-brown topped by a half-finger of dirty off-white foam. The nose comprises roasted malts, dark chocolate powder, light coffee, and a very mild bit of hickory smoke. The taste comes across very similarly, with the smoke a bit (a very small bit) more robust, the chocolate less powdery, and a touch of molasses added for good measure. The body is a stolid medium, with a slightly-light moderate carbonation and a sorta dry finish. Overall, strictly as a porter, this was pretty good. I will say, though, as a smoked porter it's a disappointment. The smoke is far too subdued, especially considering the plethora of complimentary characteristics surrounding it. Frankly, for something labeled as ""Smoke", I was disappointed with such a relative lack thereof, but it's still a good porter on its own."
"Poured from the bottle into a snifter a dark opaque brown with an offwhite head that left a minor crown after dissipating quickly. Smell was smokey with a roasty smell behind. Taste was much the same. Feel was smooth and lighter bodied than expected, some oilyness was noticed. Overall a pretty decent ""Smoked Porter"" but not the best ""Porter"". A good beer and I will not turn it down."
"Drinkability- Took 45 minutes to enjoy the whole experience. I believe this beer was awesome for its style but one had one. I would recommend this to anyone! From St. Louis of course, what do you expect?"
"This bottle is purportedly from 2010. Hard to believe that a relatively new beer, identified as a porter could be so thin and weak. I'd try again just to confirm; perhaps the next batch will improve."
"Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"If you are adamant about not liking smoked beers, you may not like this. But I highly recommend giving it a try."
"D. With a beer that tastes this good and with its great creamy mouthfeel how can you go wrong with this? I highly recommend trying this beer."
"D_Could easily drink quite a few of these."
"Overall, it's a nice beer, and the smokiness makes it stand out from all the run-of-the-mill porters out there."
"D: Good. I usually don't like smoked beers, but this one is good."
"Overall, lots of good smoke. It's a bit subdued at time and not much else except smoke. It's also a bit thin and watery."
"Drinkability - I'm guessing this was smoked with Peat. Could be wrong, but with the buttermilk type aroma and the earthy taste, it seems to fit the bill. This beer was just ok for me. It was good, but not outstanding. Didn't seeem well balanced in the aroama or the taste. I could have a few, but not too many. I hate to score this too low because I do love Porters. I say it's above average for the style."
"D: Good drinker. Seem to go best with food, especially BBQ. Also good for a quiet evening sipper."
"It is just a beer that is lost, there are better smoked porters out there."
"Overall, a very well balanced beer. Although I haven't had the opportunity to try more than a few smoked beers, this one doesn't stick out much. However, this would be amazing with ribs, brisket, or grilled wings."
"Fairly drinkable, but I prefer my porter not quite so tangy."
"Pours a cloudy dark brown color with a very light tan head that stick around only on the edges. Smell is the first sign that something is not quite right. Strong diacetyl and smoke notes about - the buttered popcorn aroma just overtakes everything. The flavor is once again dominated by diacetyl with the buttered popcorn flavor being complemented by some smoked malt and ham flavors. There is an earthiness in the flavor as well. Alcohol isn't all that noticeable. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with lower end carbonation and not much by way of alcohol warming. I split this bottle with 2 friends and I don't think any of us finished our pours, if that's any indication of drinkability. Really just not very good stuff. I'd be willing to try another bottle at some point to see if this was just a bad bottle."
"Notes: I could use a bit more smokiness and a fuller, creamier body. It wasn't bad or a drain pour, rather just not inspiring and lacking anything to really draw me in."
"Another good O'Fallon beer! This Porter was loaded with flavor and really hit the spot. The thick colorful appearance matched what I was expecting from this style and brewery. It had a full body and finished very smooth, yet complex. I'm very happy with this beer and, so far, with this brewery."
"D - If you want a session smoked beer, here you go. If it tasted better with more pronounced flavors it would be great but a good staple beer here."
"D: A good beer to have around, although I cant see myself sessioning this one... would be awesome to have this on tap at a Jewish deli or something though...Caplansky's Deli on College St are you reading this??"
"Drinkability: Smoke is a solid brew. It is tasty and somewhat unique (to my knowledge) in the American stout/porter scene. As I said, the mouthfeel leaves me wanting, but the overall experience is very good."
"Deep brown, looks kinda black, but it's muddy around the edges. Aroma is typical of a fairly robust porter, with some roasted, toasted notes. Initial taste is roasted, malty, slightly sweet. Followed by a tad bit of bittersweet cocoa, and then the smoke hits. It's bold without being overpowering, or over bearing on the other profiles here. Feel has a nice smoothness to it, but body is a little thinner than desired. Doesn't detract too much from the over all experience, because this is a pretty damn good smoked beer. I've only had a couple smoked beers, but I'm definitely intrigued...I think I'll be pursuing them now!"
"M & D - Nice medium body with a good bite to it that coats the tongue. Good drinkability with a nice ABV. The beer overall is not the best Porter and there are other available ones that I would pick up first but this is still good."
"I don't dislike this beer. The thing is it's just a really blah porter. I'm not going to give this beer the 3 point it's black score bonus."
"Extremely drinkable due to the low carbonation and clean finish. Lots of rich flavors without being overwhelming on the palate. Another enjoyable brew for the people at O'Fallon."
"Medium in body and smoky for sure. This one will go well with the Papa John's I'm going to order."
"Smoked indeed! Aroma has firm tones of burnt fragrant wood and quality roast coffee, with more than a hint of molasses but no sweetness. It pours just a whisker this side of black with a thick and fairly persistent beige head. Mouth-filling flavor is smoky, mainly high-quality roast coffee with a touch of burnt wood and an undertone of molasses with a sweet hint. There is also a whisper of caramel. Smooth flavor is quite fizzy and lively, leaving behind a strong and pleasant tingle. Recommended."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Almost pitch black. This beer's smell is strong hold scents of car-coal, some scents of dried and salty meats perhaps bacon or ham. Some burnt favors as well. Mouthfeel is heavy. This one was enjoyable but I would not reach for another."
"D - As a lover of any smoked beer, I naturally love this!!! Having said that, from a porter point of view, the smoke is way too strong IMO. The porter qualities are almost completely hidden on this one. The taste, as delicious as it is, is very lacking in complexity, and I think thats mainly because the smoke covers up what lies underneath. Great beer, but I would like to see those porter qualities that we all know and love, to come out a bit more."
"Very nice mouthfeel, not overly carbed. Just the right ammount to let the sweetness and the smoke to come through. Quite tasty and balanced. Would definately drink this again."
"Overall, pretty decent. The aroma in this beer is awesome. It is pretty drinkable. The smoke doesn't dominate the beer which is nice. A good drinking porter. Glad I got to try this one!"
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle (no freshness date) into a Sam Adams perfect pint. Pours a very dark brown, almost black, with a small light tan head that quikly fades. Smells of toasted smoked malts with coffee and chocolate. Tastes of smokey malts with some light biscuit. Not much of a mouthfeel, very light on the palate. Very easy drinking porter that wouldn't be hard to keep throwing back."
"Pretty darn drinkable! I will keep a few of these around. Seems like this would be a great beer to BBQ with!"
"d- a really smooth beer. the smoke malts eventually would likely wear on me, but nothing holds you back from quaffing this one down exceptionally quick."
"O'fallon does make some fine quality brews, especially this one and the 5 day IPA. Great job O'fallon!"
"I will disclose right up-front that I'm not a big fan of smoked beers - too many bad experiences with ""liquid smoke and sausage in a bottle"" beers. I therefore approached this beer with more than a bit of caution and the ""well, I'll try a couple of sips"" mentality. I was pleasantly surpised by how well the brewery pulled off this beer - rich porter maltyness with the smoke integrated into the malt so that it at times seemed a question of whether the flavor was deeply roasted malt or smoked malt. Far from being overpowering, the smoke was well integrated into the flavor profile. For those who like an intense smoke flavor, this beer will no doubt be a let-down, but for those who want to taste something besides beef jerky, this is quite good."
"Value: For me, it was the icing on the cake: free."
"D: Overall, pretty damn good. The sum of its parts make it better than they do individually. I do think that the ""smoke"" could be more involved, however, this helps to create a pretty well balanced beer."
"Pours a mostly opaque dark brown with a small tan head. Brewed about 2 months ago. Smell is rather smoky malts with a hint of sweetness, nothing too unusual. Taste is a nice hearty dash of smoke and peat and bitterness, with a good paintbrush-like swath of semi-sweet malts. Nicely complex. Went well with bratwurst."
"[Note: If the 2719 on the neck indicates that it's a Julian date, that would put it right around October of 2009 making it consumed within a reasonable amount of time with it being refrigerated. I'd like to get another bottle and hope for it to be good though.]"
"D- Is pretty good here. I wasn't overpowered by the smoke componet."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a very deep brown - almost black with a two finger, mocha colored head. The nose is an all malt base; complex and slightly sweet with a slightly peat-like smokiness, almost like a very mild Rauchbier. The flavor follows suit nicely with the smokiness holding off initially, allowing the slightly malty sweet backbone to shine through and follows up with a pleasently smokey finish that isn't overly aggressive. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, slick with a smooth carbonation. Overall a very enjoyable beer, not overdone and nicely balanced. Very easy drinking beer."
"I would love another two or three of these. A good drinker overall."
"D- Pretty drinkable porter. Goes down easy, finishes very clean."
"I drink about half of this and then light up my CAO Italia. Wow. If you're into cigars, this is the one to pair with."
"Overall, a very nice smoked porter, not overpowering, very drinkable. Would pair very well with a chargrilled steak or a plate of BBQ wings."
"I wasn't expecting to have a beer that smelled and tasted like sweet BBQ which I liked. This one is very nice. It's a very dark red and produces a moderate amount of head. It's very smooth producing a lingering smoke essence from my tongue for a while after it's gone. I'm quite pleased with this brew and will definitely have it again."
"The smokiness isn't over powering, but real pleasant. It's not like a Rauchbeir where the smokiness is so strong and ever present that you almost can't get past it. This is more of a subtle, well blended smokiness. The beer drinks easy. I can see myself craving this beer later on, or getting a six pack to give to a friend. I really enjoyed this beer."
"Pours a dark brown color that's see through at the edges,no head or lacing. Nice smokiness in the nose, backed up by some lightly roasted malts and a touch of chocolate. Flavor has a good balance between the smokiness, and sweet maltiness. Campfire goodness, but not overdone, which is a good thing for me since I tend to not like overly-smoked brews. Creamy, smooth mouthfeel, light carbonation. All in all, this is a good beer that I will pick up again in the future."
"Taste has plenty of smoke, but is balanced quite a bit by a rich, chocolaty and slightly sweet malt. Toastiness and firm hops lend quite a bit of bitterness on the finish. Leaves you wanting a bit more depth with a short and slightly acrid finish. Still a damn good beer as I sure do love me some smoke beer! The more the better."
"D: OK, drinkablilty has no style for to judge it. First off, I'm not a big fan of Rauschbeirs, but, I though a Porter, aged on bourbon barrels, would ease some of the bacon out of it. It didn't. I struggled thru the glass, poured the rest. I did, howeverm attempt to judge it via the style. I studied the style prior to tasting ( not other reviews ), and then did the deed. i guess this is my last smoked beer ever, it just sets the gag reflex in motion. I can't help but wonder, and drool, over the possiblities of this without smoke."
"This was pretty much a tale of two Smoked Porters, with that smoky character being very strong in the aroma but a little lesser so in the taste. I would have personally preferred a bit more in the taste myself but this was still a nice balance between the two profiles."
"Cheers."
"Pretty good offering from OFallon, would get this if in the mood for a smoked beer."
"I'm not really a fan of smoked beers, but this one wasn't too awful. It wasn't horribly smoky or terribly unbalanced or biased towards the smoke flavors, it actually had redeeming porter characteristics. I tolerated it."
"D. I very much enjoy drinking two or three of these on a cool fall or winter night by the fire. Well crafted porter."
"my bottles say they're brewed in WI. MO isn't close enough to chicago to distribute there without a satellite brewery?"
"D - Worth a try, I think, but not a wow. A good pairing could really make all the difference."
"Very nice smokey flavor and medium body. Bittersweet dark chocolate, roasted coffee, burnt toast,toasted malt, caramel and toffee. Smooth with a silkiness up front that is followed by the prominent smokiness that lingers into a dry finish."
"Drinkability? I love well made Smoked Porters and this certainly is one so drinkability is very good. Finishing the last bit in my glass, I could easily go for another."
"D - It is very different from any other beer I've tried and it was pretty good."
"Perhaps my palate has just changed since I first tried this beer, or perhaps the beer has changed now that it's brewed elsewhere. Still good, but I felt I should lower my score just a touch, since the 'new' beer isn't as good as I remember the 'old' one being."
"D: Pretty drinkable for what it is; this is a great representation of the style and I really enjoy the smoky flavors, but it would be difficult to drink more than one or two of these in one setting."
"Sample at the Most Honorable SuperHappyFun Stout Tasting. Bottle from Party Source. Pours nearly black with a thin light brown head that diminishes quickly. Spotty lacing. The aroma is smokey with some peat malt and chocolate. Medium body with a roasted/smoked character and flavors of malt, oak and chocolate. The finish is dry and smoky with a lingering earthy malt and baking chocolate aftertaste. A pretty good homage to the style created by Alaskan."
"Drinkability: If you like smoky beers, this one is for you. O'Fallon does not kid around with their smoke and the smoke is most dominate at the end. A very good smoked beer. I could have two or three in a sitting."
"D: Very drinkable, this is an outstanding smoked porter."
"This beer has a roasty caramel aroma. It has a great dark tan almost brown head and lace. The head is very rocky with an excellent combination of little and large bubbles. The body is dark and reminds me almost of cola. There is not a whole lot of carbonation to the body though. It is not as smoky in the flavor as I thought it would be but is definitely smoky and roasty. Great caramel taste."
"Drinkability: Yeh, this is a nice warm treat...I wouldn't drink it all the time, but its nice to treat yourself to this type of thing once in a while."
"Interesting to say the least."
"12oz. Poured a near black color with a thin fizzy head that dissipated very quickly, but did leave some spotty lacing. Aromas are very pleasant - smoke (burnt wood/campfire - maybe hints of some smoked meats), some roasted malt, and some sweetness with hints of licorice and molasses. Tastes are similar to the aromas, only less complex - more smoke, some burnt malts & barley with notes of spiciness. I was expecting the complexity to come out as the ale warmed, but it didn't really change much. Mouth-feel was thin-to-medium bodied with moderate carbonation and left a tingle on the tongue. Overall, good take on a smoked porter."
"Little carbonation in the mouthfeel. Definitely a lot of smoky flavor and I do like it. It isn't a day long drinking beer but it is darn good."
"A 12 ounce bottle poured into a shaker glass. The ale appears a rather dark brown color with about two fingers of ecru foam. Flavor and aroma are of the inside of a smokehouse. Smokey, sweet, slightly pungent, smoked meats such as ham, beef jerky, pleasantly bitter, decent malt sweetness. Medium to full bodied with adequate carbonation for a porter. Overall, a well made smoked beer that all fans of the style need to try."
"The feel is not as creamy as I may have wanted. It is solidly in the ""thin"" category. I like this beer's smokyness quite a bit, but I wouldn't want many in one night. All of that smoke would be pretty harsh on the 'ol palate."
"Pours a very dark brown, almost black color with a small off-white head that quickly settles to form a thin cap. Very little lacing is left on the glass. Heavy smoke aroma that reminds me of smoked meat like bacon or smoked ham. Very smokey flavor as well that also hints towards bacon. There is some malt that gives some burnt bitterness as well. Fortunately some lighter malt sweetens it somewhat. Medium body and slightly overcarbonated. Just a little harsh. A nice smoked beer. Has some hints of a fine porter underneath the smoke."
"Reviewed on 06/05/2009. Bottle at PPRBSG09. This beer pours a deep brown with a small head. The aroma is of nice smoked meats. Ahh, nice... The flavor is also quite meaty and smokey, with a very full-bodied palate. I thought this was a great smoked beer!"
"D- Very drinkable. Very good beer."
"Something I could drink a few in a sitting definatly nice for something different"
"This is an extremely good smoked beer. I was happy with the aroma but thought that the smoke was a little too understated until the taste hit me. Overall, if you're a fan of smoked beers, this is a must try."
"Mouth is slightly dry and well carbonated. Damn this drinks slowly. it's not a bad thing but it would be nice to sip around a campfire (or put into a thick stew or chili recipe)."
"Not a fan."
"Overall this is a very good smoked porter that drinks bigger than it's modest 6%. Definitely worth a shot."
"This reminded me of a foreign expedition stout almost. It's a pretty dark porter on the pour, but in the taste it has alot of roasted smoke, chocolate, and a little unplaceable sweetness. The mouthfeel is viscous, as I said it's reminiscent of a foreign export stout, but a tad lighter. I'd recommend it."
"Almost too smokey to be very drinkable, but good."
"Overall: The mouth feel of the beer is carbonated. The body of the beer is medium and finish lingers for a long while. This beer is something special, holy cow. This beer taste just like a deep pit barbecue with goat. All I need is some barbecue sauce and I would be set. This beer is way too smokey, there is no balance in the beer. I really couldn't tell if this was a porter or smoked goat. Didn't like it, I poured it down the drain. All the other Smoked porters that I have tried had balance and was rather pleasant."
"D - I like this more than I thought I would. Not sure I would drink more than one, but for fans of the style it would be much easier."
"Good drinkability, lots of food pairings keep popping up with every sip. Love the flavors, but if you don't like smoke - stay away."
"Served in an imperial pint glass."
"Smell is fully smoked with light chocolate following closely behind. Taste again is smoke up front, thin hints of chocolate come through as does a bit of sharpness toward the finish. If ound that I enjoyed this more further into the session. Mouthfeel is good and this is quite drinkable particularly when I'm in the mood for this style and looking for the smoked flavor."
"Drinkability is okay on this one. I wouldn't search it out, but I wouldn't turn it down, if it were offered either. It's decent enough to be enjoyable, but it could be lots better with some minor tweaking."
"As far as smoked beers go, Stone and East End are tops of the class. This isn't quite up there."
"D - I can't say that I was terribly impressed with this GABF gold medal brew, but it's interesting/different enough that I would like to try some other smoked beers for comparison."
"This beer pours a dark almost opaque black with an inch of a tan head to it. Head retention is decent, thin wispy lacing left behind on the glass. Nose is like smelling a campfire! Nice smokey woodchips are the most dominant scent to this beer, with roasted malts and chocolate. Taste is HUGE on the smokey flavoring - roasted malts carry through the smoked flavor, bits of chocolate, light coffee. Mouthfeel is the only disappointing piece of this beer. It has an extremely light almost watery feel on the tongue. This is a great session beer - and the mouthfeel, I can completely overlook based on the taste."
"D: As you drink it the flavors mellow a bit, or maybe I am just getting used to it. But as I continue with it, I am loosing the smoke flavor as I go."
"Overall, was disappointed after seeing so many great reviews. Per above, I'm gonna give it another shot if I can find one since the source is questionable. For now, mild recommendation and unless a retry improves it it'd be a one and done since better smokes out there."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and somewhat rich."
"Pours a dark black body with a smallish light brown colored head, somewhat diminishing, okay lacing. Very smokey aroma, sweet, almost smells like ham, almost. That's all I can smell. Fizzy taste, very smokey taste, almost ashy. Smokey sweet aftertaste too. Not heavy tasting. No hops or anything else can be detected. Just some sweet smokiness. Not overwhelming a taste, goes down pretty well."
"As far as smoked beers go, this is quality... highly recommended, would buy again."
"Thanks to htomsirveaux for this one!"
"Poured from bottle into pint glass. Pours jet black with a 1/4 finger of fizzy tan head. Smells like smoke and burnt meat. ""rancid bacon"" was used before and it's fitting. Taste is very smoky but it's all porter in the aftertaste. My first smoked beer and one of the hardest beers ever to describe. It's a burst of smoky flavor that quickly disappears. Mouthfeel is surprisingly light and a little dry. Could not see myself drinking more than one of these but with some bbq that could change. Good enough it makes me interested in trying more smoked beers."
"Taste: Gamey, funky, rancid, smokey bacon, but not in a bad way."
"Amount of smoke aroma and flavor was near perfect. Tasty and more sessionable than I expected."
"Overall, if you are the camping type, and can't get into the woods to start your campfire tonight, crack one of these open and you will be just fine."
"In the end, this was an easy drinking heavy on the smoke Smoked Porter. If you're looking for a beer that's as Smoky as a German Rauchbier but you want it in a Porter, then this beer is your calling. I didn't have any problems drinking a couple of these."
"D_Flavor so strong that its hard to drink too many of these"
"It poured a very dark brown/black with a tanish lace. The smell was wonderful and the smoke came through very well. The taste was just great, what a pleasant surprise. The smoke lingered in my mouth for along time, just enough of it too, to have you take another drink. This bottle went too fast, maybe a new go to session beer for me!"
"Pours jet black, with a tannish head. In the aroma, mellow pork smokiness and some oatmeal sweetness. In the taste, small roastiness with sweetness, almost chocolate and a hint of smokiness all the way through. A small bite and a medium bodied mouthfeel, with a small chocolate and semi dry aftertaste. Nice smoke and a nice bite. Surprised with a chocolate note, mellow and nice."
"I didnt care for it, but for the style its a terrific representation. The smoke does not overwhelm the other flavors."
"Roasted malt and coffee bitterness start out, followed quickly by a metallic tinge and welcome sooty smoke. Faint tartness hangs out in the background. Campfire smoke controls the palate, with a little dark chocolate coming in near the finish. A little coffee bitterness in the end. Could use a little more roasted character and I'm not sure about the faint tartness (lose it). Moderate body, with a slightly watery feel for the style. I was hoping for a cheaper, more accessible version of Alaskan Smoked Porter, but the taste and the mouthfeel drop the ball after a nice smoky nose. Not bad by any means, however."
"It was really nice to hear from the brewery. For me, this increases the drinkability of this beer. The small act of contacting me gives me more than enough reason to give this beer another go round. It has also given me a very good reason to try every Ofallon beer I can get my hands on."
"D - This is a good smoked porter, but the meat and smokiness got to me after a while. I had this with brats and it was delicious. This is definitely one of the best O'Fallon offerings..."
"I recomend this beer mostly because it is one of the smokiest brews on the market today."
"Nice porter very well put together. Smoke compliments the roasted malt nicely and add depth to the finish and late mid palate. Chocolate and caramel swirlded on the middle. An almost peat smoke flavor. Not neary as much meaty smokiness as the nose would suggest. A little thin in mouthfeel but very drinkable."
"D- my first time trying a smoked beer, and i liked it enough to check out other smoked porters. something i could have a couple of, but probably not more than that. if the taste wasnt so unique it would be very sessionable."
"D: I'm starting to explore smoked beers and this one's a good one! I could drink another"
"D - I generally don't care for smoked beers all that much, but this one is pretty solid and flavorful and not too heavy on the smoke. Yes, the smoke is prevalent, but it still has enough other flavors happening to keep it drinkable."
"A very nice beer. Unique and something worth seeking out. If you don't like smokey almost meat like flavors in your beer this is not for you though."
"D- A nice porter, and very drinkable, but I was expecting more of a smoky meat component. I would definitely have this again, but when wanting a porter, and not craving a smoke ale."
"Tastes similarly smoky, a woody, meaty, thick smoke. For those who like that, its delicious. Its quite a nice smoked beer, but unfortunately the porter is lost on me. Theres a semblance of malt, but the smoke is just too prominent. The mouth has some nice fine carbonation, decent body, makes this a pretty good beer."
"D- Wonderful smoked porter, before this my only other porter experience was a Stone Smoked Porter with Chipotle and this definitely stands up to that."
"D- This is not my favorite style, but I think that this is a very tastey representative of this category. I personally could not drink many of these though."
"Thanks to hwwty4 for this one."
"D-Would be great after dinner."
"D: I had a fun time drinking this and I really enjoyed the smoke aspect and liked it enough to not care so much about the appearance or the slightly weak finish, its easy drinking and tastes great and I want to know where my next one is coming from."
"12 ouncer, w/o freshness info, a gift from Pebkac after the BCTC fest this past weekend. Pours typical dark mahogany, fairly short lived dark tan head and just a smidgen of lace. Smoke is the obvious player on the nostrils. Salami and smoked ribs come to mind. Tasty enough offering, but this one could use a bit more of a malty base to make it flow more smoothly over the old tongue. Worth a try but nothing real special going on here, IMHO"
"Interesting brew don't know if I could drink more that one at a sitting. I can say I would love to cook with this brew if it was available to me. Thanks Brad"
"D- solid, wish i had more of these"
"D: I really enjoyed the smoked flavor. Felt like I was grilling ribs on the BBQ. While I really enjoyed it, I am not sure I could drink more than 1 or 2 in a sitting, but it is a robust and decent Porter."
"D: Very easy to drink and a nice moderate ABV. Not quite as good as Stone's Smoked Porter, but it can definitely hold its own."
"D: I have had better tasting smoked porters as of late, but this one may be the most drinkable. The drinkability is good for a smoked beer."
"Drinkability - i would drink it again, not a session beer"
"D - Not a bad brew. I love smoked flavors and this brew definately fills my taste. Can't wait to try the bourbon barrel version!"
"D - A fine smoked porter w/ enough roasted malt and creamy subtlety , but still the most smoke in a beer I have tasted. I found this very drinkable, but may be harsh to some who are not fond of smoked flavor. Great smoked Porter from O'fallon- thanks again jcompton"
"D-another nice brew from Ofallon,a real tounge pleaser"
"O'Fallons Smoke is one of my favorite smoked beers available in the Chicagoland area. This is an easy to find, relatively cheap, and an enjoyable sipper. I'm enjoying this bomber with a couple squares of Mo's Bacon Bar and I haven't come across a better combination yet."
"Overall: A great introduction to smoke beers. The roastiness of the porter moderates the smoke character and keeps it from being overwhelming. Personally, I prefer maltier smoked beers (such as Schlenkerla Urbock) that really bring out the smoke, but many find it offputting. This beer offers lots of flavor while keeping things balanced for those who are new to smoke beers, particularly when closer to fridge temps. As it warms up, this beer really shines."
"Poured with a very rich color and head. Earthy smell, with some oak and chocolate. I was surprised at the lack of smokyness, both in the aroma and taste. Sooth, silky texture, heavy chocolate notes with a fine smokiness. I expected a lot more smoke, but was still quite happy with it. Excellent texture. My friend smoked a chicken, and I can't imagine a better pairing."
"Tasted on 4/1/08."
"Pours pitch black with a hint of dark red brown. A good whiff of smoke comes through in the pour. Taste is of smoke and medium malt-with a little hop bitterness. Taste is of smoked ham, but it isn't heavy-it is light. Mouthfeel is light to medium and drinkability high."
"Mouthfeel was medium to thin. The carbonation level was mild to medium. Seems to be a solid porter, although not too complex. Although this one may be a tad elderly."
"I like the low level of carbonation, I think it adds to the silky flee of the mouth. This is a nice example of a smoked beer. I wish I could buy 6 packs at my local."
"D - Drinkability is average (maybe a little better). It goes down smooth. This is not a bad effort at a smoked ale."
"Drinkability: I was expecting more of a smoked body with this beer. However, considering the porter didn't have such a heavy and meaty feel as I was anticipating, it turns out that could be a very flavorful beer that could be enjoyed throughout the night."
"Smoke pours a smokey black color with some fiery highlights and small, but creamy, light brown head. Smells sweet, smokey, and lightly roasted. Light-medium body with modest, yet lightly creamy, carbonation that feels quite nice. The flavor mimics the smell in both character and quantity. Chocolate malt sweetness is balanced with smokiness, while roasted black malts meld quietly in the background. Much like their IPA this offering is a fairly light, yet flavorful brew that is very drinkable and refreshing. Very enjoyable."
"I am not a smoked porter fan at all. however this is a great beer, milder and smoother than I expected, very good."
"A pitch black liquid with a thin tan head, Looks pretty tasty. Smells smoky, peaty, Taste is a little lighter than imagined, Smokiness is defintely there but not as pronounced as the smell. It has some chocalatey tones and bit of bitter coffee. A little more sour acidity than I would like it. Carbonation is a tad rough as well. A decent porter but it didn't live up to my expectations. 5-day is definitely this breweries best usual brew."
"Black pour with a fizzy cola like tan head. Smell is very subtly smoked malt. Taste is mild, but noticeable smoke presence with a decent sweetness to it. Nice balance of getting the smoke in without making it overpowering. A touch thin, but still well done overall and a quality smoked beer that I enjoyed."
"d: When I was first introduced to O'Fallon, this was the first thing I tried. Still my favorite. Terrific smoke beer, hard for me to name a superior one. Could (and have) drink a whole lot of this beer."
"Drinkability is moderate as the smoke is fairly strong and would be overwhelming after a few."
"D - distinct enough to not even kid around there's smoke in that beer. Soft enough on the application to be enjoyable and appreciable."
"Black with a thin ruby floor. Thin tan head that fades quickly. Smell is orange, some campfire, milk chocolate and a touch of alcohol. Taste is smoked, meaty bbq flavors, dark chocolates and a touch of floral bitterness to pull it all together in the finish. Mouthfeel is slick and a bit watery. Maybe a tad overcarbonated but doesn't pull away from the overall enjoyment. Thanks Mizzoueng for the chance!"
"D-Not bad at first, and very good once it gets warm."
"Thanks Linda."
"Digs"
"All things considered, this is a very drinkable brew. All of the ingredients blend well together to form a beer that is enjoyable to drink, but not spectacular. There is nothing off-putting about it and the smoked malts are done very well without overpowering the porter characteristics. There is a solid malt profile and enough hops to help with the balance. I would certainly have another, although I don't know if I would necessarily seek it out."
"Pours and exceptionally black for a Porter and a decent laced head. The smell is sweet and with some roasted malt aromas. The smoke in the taste is moderate and is balanced well with the malts. It goes down smooth and is lightly carbonation and there is some bitterness in the back on the throat in the aftertaste. This is pretty good smoked porter here and should be given a try."
"Drinkability: Not bad but truly a second class citizen compared to the Stone's and Alaskan's of the world"
"This might be a good introduction to smoked beers, not too overpowering with the smoke."
"Drinkability- Once again, this beer shines overall in it's drinkability. If I find this again, which I may in my travels, I will be sure to pick up a 6pk of this. It has just about everything that you need for a perfect smoked porter. I would say this beer even rivals Stone and would give Alaskan a run for it's money."
"Drinkability is very good, a very smooth and well balanced brew."
"D: The taste is not bad, the smoke-porter interplay is not terrible. It just seems that the flavors don't mix as well as they should. Good beer that I'd love to try from a barrel."
"Not being a fan of smoked beers makes it hard to really judge this one so I'll leave it at that."
"Pours black with some white head. Smoke and some wood in aroma. Significant though conservative smokiness, some peat and tabacco. Very quaffable porter, with a sourish finish. Some malt offset. This would be a regular if available here. Medium mouthfeel."
"D- Very interesting. A little too much smoke for my tastes, but definitely worth a try for something different."
"12 ounce bottle served in a Sam Adams BL glass. The beer pours black with a half inch tan head which goes away very quickly. Not much lacing either. It smells like smoke, roasted malt, chocolate and a bit of coffee. The taste is the same as the aroma, which is a good thing. It leaves a nice lingering smoky aftertaste. Mouthfeel/body is medium, and it's a little bit slick and has low carbonation which is perfect for this beer. Drinkability is pretty good too, it's smooth and easy to drink and very sessionable IMO. Overall I think it's a good porter/rauchbier. I'm glad I got a 6 pack of this, because it's not going to last very long. Too bad I can't buy this here in Ohio."
"D: This is a nice beer, the smoke is nicely balanced, not overpowering. A good porter but would like a little more maltiness. Definitely recommended if you like porters/stouts."
"D - This is a good beer..the smokey thing would be good for a bottle or two at a time but wouldn't want to session on it...overall good though"
"Easy to drink, a nice offering, but not great."
"Drinkability is average."
"First of all, this is a beer that I will make an effort to seek out. Very dark with a dark head that doesn't last long. I noticed a sediment. A lighter colored suspension that slowly settles. So, maybe it was on the shelf too long, (?) but it doesn't seem to affect the taste. The taste is the good part. Great smoky flavor that's not overwhelming but just right. And, the underlying porter doesn't fight with it. It's very smooth with sort of a coffee taste. Light carbonation adds a little bite, and there is a silky mouth-feel. This one's a favorite."
"Cheers to BARLEYWINEO for this 12oz goodness"
"This beer pours a Coca-Cola brown. A nice off-color head quickly dissipates. The smell is of you guessed it... roasted hops, with a little chocolate mixed in. This taste is very smoky... almost caught me off guard after the first sip. After the first sip, the flavor becomes a little more subtle. The carbonation is light and fizzy, a decent body - not to heavy, definitely not watery. Pretty easy to drink after the first sip. Not something I would have everyday, but definitely a good American Porter."
"Overall- This is a great beer for anyone that enjoys porters or smoke beers. Would be excellent with some bbq."
"I really enjoyed it."
"The smell set me back. I can't get past a smoked ham with a vegetable side, corn maybe. Sorry, i know that can't be helpful. Best i can do is a moderately roast malt. The smoky character carries over to the the flavor. Some chocolate and caramel in there too, but it's not sweet. Adequately carbonated, finishes dry."
"Overall Impression: A palatability smoked beer. Not overly smoked. The base of the beer is more like a brown Porter. Brewed to perfection. You have to try this beer if you are looking for a smoked beer."
"D - Pretty damn thirst quenching for a smoky porter. Not offensive in any way, and mellow enough for those who don't like smoked beers, but I wish it was more assertive."
"Taste is sublime with smooth malty notes, coffee, ash, and chocolate. It's a bit underwhelming, I was expecting this to be a bit bolder, but it helps out the drinkability nicely. Mouthfeel is velvety and medium-bodied with a perfect, light carbonation level and a bitter aftertaste that comes outta left field. Overall, this is a very enjoyable, complex, tasty beer. Definately worth pursuing, all my non-good-beer-drinking friends in St.Louis seemed to enjoy what they tried."
"Moutfeel is pleasant. Not too much carbonation and not too thin. The drinkability is a little low though simply because the smoked flavor is so intense."
"Drinkability - Very. Very smooth going down and leaves the smoke aftertaste. Alcohol content is normal but is still noticable which makes a very even brew. I will buy this again and cannot wait for the barrell aged smoked porter to come out."
"(im reviewing from notes, it snowed the day i had this)"
"Taste is of course smoky as one would expect and seems stronger towards the finish of the beer. There is a good amount of roasted malt present with a dark roasted coffee like taste, and a slight cherry undertone with a subtle spiciness in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and just a bit more thin than I would prefer, not bad though. Ok drinkability, although I am not sure I would want to make a session of it because of its smokiness."
"Pretty good beer. I tend to like smoked beers although I have had only three or four. Always makes me want to grill out or go camping. Smoked porter seems to be a popular smoked style and I liked this one as well."
"Pours a nice clean/clear dark brown color, nice carbonation, nice two-finger plus foamy tannish head, lots of nice sticky lacing follows. The nose is of sweet smoked malts, and slight coffee/chocolate. The taste is smokey and malty, with a slight bitter coffee aftertaste. Medium body. Drinkable, I'm not really a big fan of these smoked brew's so far."
"Brian and Dave: Well done. This is deeply deserving of the accolades it has received."
"D - Overall, a very good selection for the style. Goes down very smoothly, without the thicker body."
"D: A nice porter that's got a hefty smoke bite to it. An interesting offering to say the least and a good change of pace for me as I'm not a huge smoked fan."
"Garnet infused cordovan. Tall, cushiony fine bubbled head of faded caramel that settles slowly to a thick cap leaving no lacing. Big pops of carbonation. The smoke aromas bring to mind bacon and salmon, as well as aromas of chocolate chips, cocoa powder, and wood ash. Smokey sweet with dashes of cocoa and bakers chocolate finishing with some smoked piney hops. The smoke gains in intensity as the bottle warms. Medium body with medium carbonation, there is a slight slickness gathering on the tongue. Bits of dry roasted astringency compliment nicely. This was a solid smoked porter."
"O'Fallon Smoke pours black with a tan head that falls in a couple of minutes to a thin cap. There is a little lacing as the beer is drunk. The aroma is mainly smoke with some roastiness. Honestly it smells a little like smoked meat. The taste maintains the roastiness and smoke, but the meaty note is not present. Mouthfeel was thinner than I expected. I would have like more creaminess. Drinkability is good with this one. I don't know if I'd session the beer, but it would pair well with certain foods."
"I've had this and O'Fallon's pumpkin ale. They are both definitely extreme, but more in the way of curiousities than in a way that I would rank with elite beers. Nonetheless, I'll keep trying what they put out!"
"something about the balance here is mighty impressive, although i still prefer the 360 degree smoky ass kicker. too much smoke, not enough maple syrup. still, a solid beer and the best i've had from o'fallon's."
"Quite a good beer but only if you don't mind strong smoked beer. Heavy on the smoke this is a natural beer for barbecue."
"Drinkability is ok for this type of beer. I've had some real barn stoppers before. However, this still doesn't rate too high because it's food in a bottle. Also, by the end of the bottle, the smoked flavor diminished as you get used to it. And lastly, the flavor was not very complex. They nailed the smoke, but didn't really have a decent base to begin with."
"Drinkability/notes: The porter character could be strengthen a bit to balance against the strong smoke character. Still, a quite decent example, very nice."
"Deep brownish black body with a very light brown head. Very meat like nose that screams smokey sausage and even hints of bolagnise. In the first sip you get a huge dose of the smokey feel of this brew and even a nice hint of sweetness. This beer is quick to fade out after the bold palate and initial smokey feel. Some may find the liquid smoke like feel a bit over the top, but what do you expect? I find the mouthfeel a bit more smokey even as it warms. Easy to drink for the style. More focus on the porter would be nice."
"D - It is very different from any other beer I've tried and it was pretty good."
"Overall, all aspects are strong enough AND balanced. It could perhaps use a bit more mouth weight (for cold winter nights), but then that could throw off the balance. Definately happy with this beer as it is. It reminds me of summer time barbecues and campfires, and wintertime fireplace sessions. A classic."
"($2.69 / 22 oz.)"
"D - The smoke character is stong in this brew so I would have to say it would be hard to polish off more than a bomber of it in a single sitting. Good, solid brew. Definitely worth it."
"Deep black in color-slight tan head on top. Mellow aroma-not much there. Some smokiness-sort of an oily or mechanical type smell to it. Nice, mellow smoked flavor. Good balance between that and the chocolate and roasted flavors. Trace of hop bitterness. Decent enough mouthfeel. Definate winner here. Smoke not overpowering as in some beers. Well worth a try, even as just a porter without the smoke."
"The anticipation was well worth it...a solid brew and one I am very fortunate to try."
"I definitely prefer Alaskan smoked porter."
"Only complaint is the body is not particularly substantial and a little airy overall..but this is a tasty drinker.."
"This would be great with grilled meats, smoked meats or sausages. That being said i dont think it would make a good session beer, but thats just my taste. It was well worth the try, and im sure id enjoy it again, especially with grilled foods, if it was only more available in my neck of the woods."
"This brew pours a solid black color. The head is one finger in height, but recedes rather quickly into sparce lacing. The aroma is wonderful: chocolate, roasted malt, and smoke. The taste is like the aroma, but with more smoke and less chocolate. The mouthfeel is a bit lighter than medium bodied with nice carbonation, all fitting for a porter. Overall, this is a pretty good beer. I can see myself enjoying this again sometime next autumn."
"Thanks to bditty for this one!"
"Okay drinkability overall. Nice smoke flavor but there really isn't too much else to accompany it."
"The beer was very dark, and had a smoked odor and taste to. I do not think I would try it again, however I am not saying it was bad. It actually was a good beer, but definitely not one of my favorites."
"Not to impressed with this, but not under whelmed either. I'm glad I tried it, but I probably wouldn't buy it ever again."
"D - This is a fantastic porter, and for those who like the Rauchbier style, it also has fantastic smoke. The alcohol level isn't out of bounds, the taste has plenty of intricacy without being overwhelming, the look and feel are impressive. No wonder this beer won gold at the GABF of 2004. Highly recommended!"
"This is a nice entry to smoked beers in general and a pleasant surprise to me from a previously unknown brewery. I'll still stick with my Schenkerla Marzen (which can't be beat IMO), but for the price this will cure my smoky fix in a pinch. Better than Stone Smoked Porter IMO, but I haven't had Alaskan."
"Opinion: This is a pretty well crafted beer. The overall impression I get is that it is a little thin and could do with a bit more mouthfeel. This lends to its favor in that it is really refreshing and easy to drink. There are some really fruity notes to this beer, and you should know this going in. The balance is malt driven, but with everything else going on...it turns out to be a nice beer and one that I would drink again."
"12 oz bottle with a gray label and a woodcut style image of a camper sitting over a smokey campfire. Very appropriate. Poured into an imperial pint glass. Nice mocha brown head about a finger width. Good lacing maintained until the last 1/4. Color is solid black with slight brown notes around the edges. Smell is a nice subtle campfire wood smoke with malt notes mixed in. The smoke is not overpowering, blended in nicely. Tastes adds the flavor of smoked meats and a tiny bit pepper. Mouthfeel starts off creamy and mellows to a medium body as it warms. This is a very pleasant porter. I would love to have this with some tastey KC BBQ."
"Hand carried back from KC, Mo."
"All in all drinkable. Not quite the best porter for a base but quite good and the smoke isn't overdone. The light mouthfeel really saves the day here - this could have been a cloying disaster but instead it's actually interesting and refreshing."
"Taste; the coffee and chocolate come out more in the flavor than they did in the smell. The smoked flavors are strong, and make me think of bacon as I drink this, but they're not to the point of being overwhelming. There's also just a bit of hop bitterness present towards the end, Mouthfeel is medium bodied, and much more drinkable than I had anticipated."
"Great tasting and great drinking, this is a solid offering. I'm quite pleased and will most likely be drinking this one again soon. Cheers!"
"Smooth, but a bit astringent, a nice beer overall."
"Medium bodied, smooth, almost creamy, and easy to drink, seems to get even easier as you get used to it. Worked well with grilled steaks, probably even better with ribs.."
"This is a really engaging beer. Im not sure I could sit down and drink a sixer of these, but Im thankful for the journey I got out of this one. Definitely try at least one."
"Mouthfeel- Pretty mellow with general flavor. Of course the one flavor inparticular that stood out the most was the smoke and hints of wood. But other than that, your average porter."
"A nice blend of a Smoked Beer and an American Porter. Pours out to a dark cherry brown color with a medium head that quickly bubbles away and leaves a thin layer of brown foam on top of the beer. Medium low carbonation. Aromas of smoked malts and salted ham fill the nose. Very Rauchbier like. Taste is medium to medium full bodied and somewhat complex; smokey malts, mild hops, sweet molasses in the background. Some grain and earthy notes as well. Nice. Mouthfeel is medium bodied but maintains a robust character and chewy nature. Drinkability is north of average. Wouldn't mind this in place of a regular porter. Recommended."
"Drinkability: Not bad for a smoked beer, not annoying whatsoever. A week after having Stone Smoked Porter this beer does show it's faults, though."
"The mouth is a bit thin but there is enough flavor to keep me interested and coming back for more."
"All in all, a solid porter with a touch of smoke. Must remember to revisit this brew when devouring grilled meats."
"Mouthfeel is disappointly thin. I wish they would have taken this in a more viscous direction. As it is, it seems like a bit of an oxy-moron: easy drinking refreshing smoke-fest?"
"This is a nice drinking smoked porter. I wish I had me another...."
"This is a sweet brew with hints of cherry and maple and big big smoke flavor of course. Hops are barely perceptable in this one but theres a very slight bittering. There is a porky aftertaste I think, but maybe that smells just playing tricks on me. Very drinkable for this style. Good brew."
"Overall, a drinkable smoked porter. Porters by nature should be very drinkable IMO and this one fits the bill. I would be interested to see how long I could go with this one before the smokiness got to me. Worth picking up."
"Notes: Good porter, but great smoked porter. Makes me hungry for a huge bacon cheeseburger (maybe a Hardees Monster Burger)."
" Tastes pretty good, not as smoky as I might like, although extremely balanced. Roasted and chocolate malts are muted by the smoke, light though it may be. Mouthfeel is right on, good carbonation, medium bodied. Drinkability is good, the balance is the key, though I might like it better if the flavor were more over the top."
"Not bad, just blase'. Ho hum."
"An easy drinker and well balanced brew!"
"D- I don't taste all the malt complexity that it describes on the bottle and perhaps the smoke covers a lot of that up. The smoke is bold but no too strong for the malt or hops flavor. When I exhale I get a bit of stale campfire taste in my mouth but it doesn't get in the way of the flavor of the beer."
"This is a fairly dark beer. It lets little light through. There is very little head. The smell reveals the smoke. Also smells a little like oatmeal. The taste lets even more of the smoke flavor run wild. The mouthfeel is smooth with no bite. I could drink these on occasion but not every day. It is different. A style that I will explore more thourghly."
"Drinkability - one of the few smoked beers I would make a session of, and would definitely buy again."
"Many thanks to Dertbert for providing this beer that I was wanting to try."
"Thanks MJR. This one deepens my appreciation for the truly great Smoked Porters."
"drinkability: drinkable"
"D - This beer could easily be offensive with it's strong flavors, but it's not. In fact, I'd say it's really quite drinkable. I'd have another, and probably will the next time I get a chance. If you like Porters, you'll like this one. If you like smoked porters, you'll really like this one. Not my very favorite style, but I truly enjoyed the uniqueness of this beer. Recommended."
"Pours a typical porter black with some garnet highlightsa and a modest khaki head. Nose is more subdued than I would have expected, a little disappointing, but still appetizing - light smoke, charred malt husk, old coffee. Taste mirrors the nose, with faint smoke hovering above charred-yet-still-sweet caramel malts, baker's chocolate, and old coffee grounds. Mouthfeel is on the thin side, a little watery. The sweetness is pleasant and surprising in this smoked beer. Not as much of the ""beef jerky"" character that many smoked beers possess. A crossover smoked beer for those apprehensive of the style, like I was before I had New Glarus' Smoked Rye Bock (which is great...find it!)."
"An easy drinker, and somewhat addictive."
"Great beer, very drinkable - high marks there because I like porters and I could have many more of these. Thanks to Brent for passing this one along."
"This smoked offering pours an opaque black color with a one inch tan head. Minimal lacing. Aroma is nutty and chocolatey but not the most smoky. A little lactic acid in the smell as well. Taste however has a really good dose of smoke. Starts out with some bittersweet chocolate notes and dextrin. Smoke comes and doesn't drown out the chocolate but compliments is nicely. Lots of cream and milk flavors in the body. The finish is rather acidic and cuts out the smoke and other flavors. I think this porter would be below average without the nice smoke compliment, but with it the porter moves to above average. Nice for when you need your smoke fix but not great for when you need your porter fix."
"Pours with a large red head that refuses to go down. Smells like bacon and smoke, and tastes even more complex than the smell. Bacon, smoke, nuts, and succulent tasting hops. That's right, the body is so thick with smoke and meat that the hops are especially complimentary. It's so dark that it makes guinness look like budweiser. The smoke tends to build up on your tongue until you are finished with the bottle to the point where that really is enough smoke. Not a session beer. Quite good and quite recommended."
"A good example of what a smoke beer should be. It has solid qualities of the base beer (Porter), with contributing smoke character which compliments the beer without overpowering it. The porter characteristics are heivily toasted, chocolatey, and malty with coffee tones. The smoke adds another level of complexity without offending. A good balance to a good beer. The body gives way a touch into the body and finish. Doesn't hold as firm as I would have hoped. Nevertheless, worth a try."
"This years vintage seems better blended - maybe just fresher or better cared for."
"Overall, O'Fallon's Smoked Porter is a darn fine beer, loaded with the smokiness I've come to really enjoy in a fine smoked porter or a rauchbier. One of the best out there."
"Liquor Barn, Lexington, KY"
"Oh yeah! Smoke! No doubt a superior smoked beer offering, and now one of my favorites. This full tasting is a long time coming after a petty 1oz sample had at the GABF in 2004 (thanks Jimbo!). Its no traditional Rauchbier, but it might as well be."
"smells complex, bacon, chocolate, and of course smoke.has an aftertaste but not a bad one. stronger than most beers, but average for a dark. the color is VERY dark, so dark light can't escape, the black hole of beers? you be the judge very cheap for the quality of beer you get."
"I feel like you really need to sarch for some smoke in this beer. It took me a couple to start getting it, then was kind of hammy. I wold prefer a more upfront drier smoke. Beer was opaque black. and rolled across the tounge with little CO2. Id just like more smoke."
"I wish it were a little thicker and if the flavor was drawn out a bit more. But it is what it is. And it is good. Great BBQ beer. (or with Brown Sugar Cinnamon Pop-Tarts for a treat...mmmm)"
"Ham and chocolate. No, I never thought it would be a good combination either. O'Fallon smoked porter pulls it off. This beer has a nice dark brown color. The head pours out nice, but quickly diminishes. The aroma is dominated by pork, with chocolate and coffee. Smoky pork flavor, but not quite as strong as I like. Burnt roasted coffee flavor and chocolate balance the smoke. This is pretty smoky, but not extremely so. I like that there are other flavors besides just the smoke. Solid beer."
"Easily the best Ofallon beer I've ever had."
"But I'm really into this smoke brew!"
"Drinkbility was good on this smoke beer, even enjoyable by itself, where as with some other smoked beers I always felt like they were only good with some food."
"I don't think I could drink more than a few pints of this just because of the overpowering smokiness, but it's one of those brews that might make a terriffic mid-winter session brew."
"Drinkability is decent but just sort of bland. Less than was expected."
"This poured from the bottle a deep brown to black with a thin tan colored head that receded quickly into the glass. The aroma is a pleasing complex mix of smoky malt, coffee, brandy and black cherry. The flavor has a sharp smoky bite up front with rich coffee and brandy flavors following. The black cherry disappears in the flavor, but the smoke reappears in the finish and lingers for few moments after drinking. Slick, slightly oily mouth feel. Hmmm, drinakbility? Its tough, I think this is a fine beer for the style, but its not something I could drink too much of, due to the lingering smoke flavor."
" This is a very interesting porter from the brewery that brought you Blackberry Scottish Ale and Cherry Chocolate Ale. Adventurous little Missouri brewery, and they've got a nice one here. Definitely, has a Bamberg smoked malt character that makes me want another smoked beer. This one could use a little tweaking in the hops and carbonation departments, but it's a keeper and a pleasant sipper that is an ideal compliment to any smoked meats or cheeses."
"Mouthfeel is light to medium, about where a porter should be. Swishing reveals a much grander taste of campfire. Alcohol content is still fairly low allowing for a medium session. Worth a try even if you don't like smoked beers. It's only 12 ounces, wuss."
"Acquired from a trade with beerhandy."
"I had a bad experience with a Rauchbier some time back, and that one experience turned me off to smoked beers for awhile. Until now, actually: This is great! I scored three bomber-sized bottles at Lucas Liquor in Overland Park (new find!). Looks and pours as a typical good porter and if you take a whiff the smoke is evident but not overpowering. The problem I had before with a different smoked beer was the overwhelming presence of smoke, like actually drinking liquid smoke. This is liked by some I'm sure, but not me. O'Fallon has the perfect balance. I can't think of a better beer to pair with a steak, BBQ, or any kind of meat from a grill. Phenomenal."
"22 ounce bomber. Thanks BIF20 and jimdkc. A great beer, very easy to drink and with a nice, yet not overdone smoke complement. If this one is available on tap I'd love to try some."
"Pours ruby black with a big frothy tan head and some spotty lacing. Smells of sharp smoky malts, caramel sweetness, and subtle hop character mixed with an acrid bitterness, which is in no way a detriment. Tastes initiatlly of sweet malts. Very good , but not as smoky as the nose. Slightly woody, with a subtle ctiric hop bitterness, finishing with a lingering burnt bitterness, Mouthfeel is creamy smooth, very mouthcoating. The smoke character is not overwhelming as it is in some smoked porters, allowing me to enjoy a very solid porter underneath."
"Good - but not gold medal material in my opinion. The smoke could be increased as well as the body of the beer. Perhaps an extra hop addition or two."
"The head did a little better on a second pour. The final flavor I'm left with is an unpleasant smoke. The smoke fails to enhance the beer in my opinion."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 3/8"" light brown head over the almost opaque dark brown brew. Head fades down to an uneven layer of bubbles pretty quickly, but laces nicely. Aroma is smoke, and that's about it, not that there's anything wrong with that. Taste starts with slightly sweet dark malts, quickly giving way to the smokey parts, and ends rather slick over the tongue. Mouthfeel and drinkability are good for the style. A nice centered smoked porter, enough to make smoke aficianados not waste their time, but not so much to drive most people away."
"Very dark, nearly black, with a thick, rich brown head that soon fades to a persistent foam ring. Subdued roasted malt aroma with some woody smokey notes. Tastes slightly sweet at first, but that gives way to bittersweet chocolate and coffee flavors. You almost forget it's a smoked beer, then the smoke flavor appears out of nowhere. A little bitterness is left on the back of the tongue on the swallow. Thinnish mouthfeel. While the smokiness was interesting at the start, frankly, by the time I reached the end of the bomber, I was numb to the smoke. I might occasionally split a bomber of this, but I doubt I'd drink one myself anytime soon! Definitely worth a try, though."
"Damn near black, if not actually black in the middle with dark brown influences, ruby highlights around the edges. The head was russet, at the apex the foam was about a half finger in height. It loudly faded to a soapy collar, wispy in the middle; the top of the liquid was almost naked in a few minutes. There was no subsequent lacing either. I like the darkness of the beer itself but aside from that the appearance is forgettable. The smokiness of the nose has some positive attributes and some negative ones. When I compare this beer to AKSP this offering has a sharper smoked smell. The woody, char is zippier. The bacon aromas are very dry. There are hints of semi-sweet chocolate and day old coffee. There is nothing wrong with the bouquet but I really wish it were more rounded and fatter. Schlenkerla forcefully smells fatty and juicy, AKSP has theses same aromas but very muted. The smells from OFallon seem lean. It clearly expresses itself as a Smoked Beer (Porter). It is smokier than Z Street but not as nasty (in a good way) as Rogue. I dont like to compare beers in reviews like this but Im trying to make a point. While the nose is inviting, the potency is moderate and the message is clear, I still wish it were heartier in the smoked aromas. The palate is mild. This is a Smoked Porter on training wheels; its a four-cylinder Yugo. I want a Hemi. I want Smoked Beers to be more forceful. I realize this beer is not a Rauchbier; Im judging it accordingly. The palate is a pleasant mix of charred hickory, day old coffee grounds, peat, semi-sweet chocolate, herbal hops with a stinging finish, and there are kisses of ham and straight smoke. The palate is pleasant enough but it is far too Porter-like for me. I need more smoke, more fatty meat, and more richness. The aftertaste is hot and incomplete, there isnt much smoke and there is far too much roasted acidity. This beer is something to kick back with at a BBQ, it is simplistic but hearty enough to stand up to grilled meats. I dont have any outright complaints; I have more of a wish list. I am disappointed in this offering. It is a tickle fuller than medium in body, the carbonation is moderate but natural, the mouthfeel is hearty and firm but it works well with the flavor profile. On the whole, this beer is easy to drink. In this case, that is not a good thing. I dont mean to harp but more smoke, more malt richness, etc and I would want to slow down, I would want to sip and savor. As is, I just want to drink it with food. It is nothing special. I have a handful more bombers to drink and enjoy, and dont let the negative tone of this review fool you, I like this beer. I will drink it with a smile! I purchased my bottles in Parkville, Missouri. It is worth a try if you DONT like Smoke Beers, this one might change your mind."
"It opened with a familiar ""Aecht Schlenkerla"" aroma and poured into a chalice with a proper head which subsided into a ring. The smell was the attractor and the following taste did not dissappoint It isn't a smoked porter it's a Rauchbier (and a freshie to boot). My Aecht Schlenkerla dissapointment is that it's seldom fresh. This is and I would buy it over the German version. Good job! What a pleasant surprise."
"Lightish bodied, cohering slightly richer as it sits awhile. As is, it strandles the indifference fence: too light for true experience, and marred ever-so-slightly. This would be still be well suited to wash down like-minded foods, but enjoyment in and of itself suffers."
"I knew nothing about Smoked Porter before plucking it off the shelf, but I'm always up for a good smoked beer. This is definitely a good smoked beer, albeit one that would benefit from a touch more malt to fill out the body. A solid effort that makes me curious about the rest of the O'Fallon line."
"This smoked porter poured a very dark brown almost opaque color with tall, creamy, light brown foam that persisted and clung to the glass a bit. The smell was malty with a hint of sweetness and some light smokiness. There was a little caramel and a very light hoppiness in the aroma. The taste was lightly smokey and quite malty with a touch of yeast, and a very light tangy flavor. The mouthfeel was smooth and relatively dry with medium body and low carbonation. The aftertaste was lightly malty and faintly smokey. This was an easy to drink and enjoyable smoked porter. However, it was quite a bit more smokey when I sampled it on-tap at the 2004 GABF, and frankly, it tasted much better there than this bottled sample did."
"Solid all the way and very well controlled in its approach. This definately shows more and more character as it warms. A very affordable beer to enjoy, and highly addicting."
"I was eager to try this one, but it says on the bottle to keep it in the fridge ... I wonder if it has something that won't allow it to cellar well. Anyway. Pours a very dark color with a small head that falls fast, but leaves plenty of lacing on the glass. The aroma is sweet and slightly smoky with some dark malts in the backgrount. Very nice. The flavor is much the same. Lots of dark malts with some slight hop and a lingering smokiness that is slightly sweet and at just the right amount. Drinkability is very good and the mouthfeel is right where it should be."
"Bottle thanks to the generosity of BA MJR. The OFallon Smoked Porter poured a medium coffee brown, with flashes of ruby when held to the light. A light tan head formed and dissipated to leave a foamy ring clinging to the edges of my glass. Aroma is very rich and pervasively smoky, such that its almost tasteable just in the nose, like inhaling a side of hickory smoked bacon..mmmm. Plenty of roastiness in the nose too with just a hint of herbal hops. At first taste while cold, it seemed a bit thin, but metamorphosed into a smoky masterpiece as it warmed a few degrees. Classic porter elements are all there, lots of roastiness, a slight tartness and bitterness in the middle and back, with sweet wood smoke swirling through your mouth in all aspects of this brew. Very smooth and medium bodied."
"Beautiful. Rich dark dark brown with mahogany glow. Large 2-fingered froth collapses to beer meringue. Lace dissolves as fast as the lace on a Victoria's Secret model in a 14 year old's bedroom. This is really perfect; this is just a dynamite beer -- dyn-O-mite! There's a little country farm smell to it. Then the malts heavy pet the tongue, the smoke blows hop bitterness throughout and seems to evaporate just before an excessive climax. It leaves me wanting more, dontcha know! The creamy mouthfeel serves to spread chocolate nutella all over. yummers"
"This beer pours a dark brown with a tan head. The head looks thick and creamy. It fades very slowly leaving thick laces. It smells like roasted malts and caramel. It also smells of smoke. It tastes smokey with a roasted malt flavor. The smoke flavor is not too overwhelming like in some smoked beers. It is mild and satisfying in this beer. There are slight hints of coffee and chocolate in the flavor as well. This beer is maybe a little over carbonated, but not to the point of making it bad. It goes down smooth. It is a pretty full bodied beer. It leaves a taste of smoke on the palate. This beer is not the best session beer because the smoke flavor would grow old after a few. But it is definately a good beer, and worth a try or three."
"Thanks to clvand0 for sharing this beer with me. It pours a black color with a finger of head that falls to very healthily coat the beer. The nose is divine. The smoke is sweet, with a really nice coffee malt in the back of it. I like it. The flavor is also very good. The smoke and the bitter coffe flavors marry so well together. So good. Reminds me a lot of the AK smoked. The feel is nice and thick. Drinkability is huge. This is easily a session smoked beer. Big A+. Well worth a look."
"22 ounce bomber. Black in color, see through around the edges though; 1/6th inch bubby tan head that maintains until the end. The nose is lively  smoky charcoal, chocolate and varieties of malts all to be found. As expected, there are lively smoky characteristics, yet they blend in seamlessly with this near full bodied beverage. Rich coffee beans, dark chocolate and black licorice coupled with burnt malts and smoky offerings make this a treat! Sweet malts come to play with warming; the finish is slightly bitter and quite clean and refreshing. A great smoked beer  the folks at OFallon arent afraid to take chances, they hit the bulls-eye with this one!"
"I view this as more of a novelty beer than something I would drink alot of. Interesting enough to try some other examples of the style, but not enough to keep any around the house, except maybe for some barbecue."
"It pours dark as night with a huge tan head; minimal lacing and an unusual amount of sediment. The aroma is all beef jerky. As a vegetarian this is slightly disconcerting, yet vaguely interesting. When I take the first sip the aroma comes in, roasted malt gets cloudy by an odd mineral water taste. It tastes like they brewed it with Gerolsteiner. The smoke is far more present in the aroma than the taste, however it does leave a nice bouquet. This is a pretty good beer that could be a great beer with some tweaking."
"Mouthfeel is smooth has a nice medium body...fits the bill of a porter nicely in my mind. A bomber is more than enough of this..but it goes down easy. Definetly an acquired taste...I could see the smoke easily being off putting here, however I say it's well worth a shot and it's a unique drinking experience."
"Sampled this on 12/19/04 from a 22oz bomber. Pours out an oil like pitch black with a small light brown head. The head dissolves quickly leaving only the slightest lacing on the glass. Aroma is strong with smoke and smoky woods. There are lighter notes of coffee under all the smokiness. Smoke also is a huge component in the flavor. Roasted malt and chocolate add more depth. Besides that it was smoke, smoke and a hint of smoke which all finished up with a smoky sweet aftertaste. Mouthfeel was a bit thin but not so much it hurts it and it was smooth. Overall a pretty tasty beer that delivers on the smoke, but I am not sure I can drink to much of this at once. Thanks to nogoodreason for the sample."
"This beers pours a deep thick, opaque black color, and is topped by a creamy brown head. The aroma is unmistakably smoked, it has rich notes of smoke, underlying it there are notes of coffee, and roasted grain. Actually the smoke pretty much dominates the aroma. The taste is surprisingly light considering I was expecting something more like Alaskan's smoked porter. The taste is lightly sweet, with an infused smokiness that dominates every corner of this beer. As this beer warms up and my palate becomes smoke saturated, it starts to pick up a bit more complexity, with notes of coffee, wood, and caramel. This is fairly tasty, though it is quite one dimensional, it really needs a bit more of a malty background. Basically this is like the little brother of Alaskan's smoked porter. Definitely good, and fairly light."
"Drinkability: Yeh, this is a nice warm treat...I wouldn't drink it all the time, but its nice to treat yourself to this type of thing once in a while."
"I could not likely consume a lot of these in one sitting but a nice special brew."
"Mouthfeel is a bit thin, which is exaggerated by the funky water treatment. Quite drinkable with the smoke level just about right. An improvement in the water treatment and this would be a very good beer. Still tasty."
"Drinkability: By no means my style of beer, but a noble effort from a tiny brewery. Doubt I would try again unless I learn to like smoked beers more."
"Dark black in color, nice lasting creamy tan head, roasty smokey aroma. Roasted smokey burnt coffee flavors, nice burnt bitternes in the finish. Light-medium body light creamy mouthfeel, this is my favorite from this brewery."
