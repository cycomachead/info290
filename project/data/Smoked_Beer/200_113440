4.47,10.4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Overall a well-balanced imperial stout. The smoke here is quite mild and just lingers in the background compared to some smoked beers/Rauchbiers.  A nice wintertime beer that would pair well with grilled pork or beef, sausage, mushroom dishes and caramel, nut, chocolate deserts.  Everything about this beer ---aroma, taste, and mouthfeel improve as it warms a bit after coming out of the refrigerator.","myelo","Feb 27, 2015"
4.25,4.9,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Packing some power, and very filling, this is a brew to be reckoned with. however, it is not overpowering and is quite well done. The smoky flavor does nothing to detract from the solid malty taste. Faint hop presence. Very Good!","31Sam13","Feb 26, 2015"
4.25,4.9,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,"My first experience with smoked porter and I rather enjoyed it.  Faint smoke and sweet vanilla on the nose after a rich molasses pour.  Two finger caramel colored head leaves behind a thin layer of foam and some lacing throughout the drink.  Taste is big and bold, not overly complex, with a nice punch at 10%.  A hearty brew, the smoke is most evident to me as an aftertaste, more like that of a cigar than a smoked food perhaps.  Not bitter and no other real aftertaste, this is an easy drinker for the power and a bit of an experience.  I like it.","Foxybrau","Feb 09, 2015"
3.96,-2.2,4,4.25,4,3.5,3.75,"Aroma is not overly smoky, mainly roasted malt and chocolate. Nice dark color with beige head, almost like a cola. The flavour is where the smokiness sneaks in but is balanced quite well by sweet malts and chocolate. Not hoppy at all. If you enjoy dark porters or any smoked beers, you should enjoy this one.","vikinggary28","Feb 02, 2015"
3.79,-6.4,4,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,"Pours a deep chocolate brown with a creamy beige head atop.Aromas are not overly smoky but it's there,mainly dark fruit and brown sugar/molasses detected.The raisin/dark fruit flavors are the main component on the flavor profile as well,mild smoke and chocolate round out the flavor profile along with sweet alcohol.A pretty solid beer but not alot of the ""smoked"" part of this porter,still above par for most of Mendocino's stuff.","oberon","Jan 19, 2015"

3.5,-13.6,,,,,,"As a once avid homebrewer, I'd probably revamp the recipe with slightly less fermentables to yield just a touch lower alcohol and bring out a wonderful maltiness that is somewhat masked.  For me, that would be the difference between a 3.5 beer and a 4.5 beer.   Still, a wonderful offering from one of my favorite breweries!","jcat5150","Nov 17, 2014"

The smoke actually clutters up the beer and detracts from it, and doesn't sit well with the herbaceous green leafy hops and bitterness. If they took out the smoked malt and dialed down the bittering hops, and removed any later additions, you'd have yourself a decent baltic porter.","Mitchster","Mar 07, 2014"

4,-1.2,4,4,4,4,4,"22 ounce bottle into snifter; no bottle dating, but is a very recent release. Pours fairly pitch black color with a 2 finger dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, caramel, toast, wood smoke, coffee, herbal, floral, light pine, and roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt, smoke, and moderate earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, caramel, toast, wood smoke, light coffee, herbal, floral, light pine, and roasted earthiness. Fair amount of earthy herbal/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, caramel, toast, wood smoke, herbal, floral, light pine, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance, complexity, and robustness of dark/roasted malt, smoke, and moderate earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a moderately creamy, smooth, and slightly chalky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice smoked imperial porter. All around good complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt, smoke, and moderate earthy hop flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Feb 19, 2014"
