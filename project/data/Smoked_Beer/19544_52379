3.82,0.3,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Poured out as a nice dark brown color with a thin cream colored head on top. The retention was pretty good on this beer with a minimal lacing. The smell of the beer has a smokey aroma to it, with just some hints of other roasted and chocolate aromas also. The taste of the beer wasn't overly smoked which to me is a good thing. The mouthfeel of the beer is medium bodied with a decent dryness to it. Overall it's not a bad porter, it is also drinkable so that also helps this beer out too. Not bad.","Knapp85","Jul 07, 2011"

4,5,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours jet black with a light tan head. In the aroma, a light smoke and roasted coffee. In the taste, melow smoke and a nice coffee roast note. A smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry hint of smoke in the aftertaste. Nice mellow smoke presence and nice small presence of coffee.","OWSLEY069","Oct 01, 2010"
4,5,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a dark brown, almost black and oily. Off white head forms and leaves a fair amount of lace. In the aroma, big time smokey, roasted malt essence and just a hint of smoke cured meat. In the flavor, a pronounced smoke flavor similar to german rauchbier. Some chocolate and vanilla are there, roasted malt chimes in, but the smoked malt flavor is predominant. Finishes with a lingering smoke note. An authentic American Rauchbier.","Stinkypuss","Aug 30, 2010"
4.28,12.3,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"In my mouth, this beer is creamy with adaquate carbonation and a medium body. Just a touch too creamy perhaps for a porter, but overall, this is an enjoyable beer that I would try again. And that's saying a lot for this non-smoker! I guess maybe one puff wasn't enough!!","jampics2","Mar 25, 2010"
4.35,14.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"D: I enjoyed this beer and could have 2-3 in a sitting, especially on a cool night by the fire.","IronCitySteve","Oct 26, 2009"

3.83,0.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,4,"Good smoked enjoyed on-tap at Pizza Plant, Transit. Black body with soapy brown head, served too cold. More drinkable though not more complex as it warmed, yielding more coffee. Pleasant BBQ smoke in nose. Above average mouthfeel, a sipper but drininkable. Drying finish.","Sammy","Sep 26, 2009"
4.05,6.3,4,4,4,3.5,4.5,"This was one of those ""where did it go so fast"" beers. It's filled with so much smoky goodness that it's hard to put down. If you're a fan of either Smoked beers or a creamy Cask Ale and you're in the Cleveland area, then stop on by a grab a pint of this beer.","AltBock","Sep 19, 2009"
