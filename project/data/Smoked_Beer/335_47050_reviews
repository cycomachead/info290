"o: I dont personally like drinking a campfire, but it is a smoked rye so if that is your thing then this one has it. If you like a strong smokey flavor and burnt grains this is a good beer for you. (If you are looking for a more traditional dopplebock this isnt a good choice.)"

"Smoked beers are very hit and miss, mostly due to the finesse needed when dealing with smoked malt. This beer wasn't bad at all. I would have liked a little bit more flavor to pop - though the smoke wasn't ""overdone", by the end of the beer, my palate was starting to get tired of it. Good in smaller doses, and still pretty tasty overall."

"the smoke is absolutely wonderful here but the sour note really is a touch too strong, maybe this is better was a dessert type after some righteous bbq pig etc. I can't imagine this through an entire meal, might make a hell of an interesting sauce/marinade/braising liquid...."

"My brother bought 2 bottles, and didn't like it. He gave me the other. I like Alaskan Smoked Porter and to a lesser extent Stone Smoked Porter. I'm down with a good smoked beer. But I'd heard some other folks say it was not good, so it took me a couple of years to get around to opening it. It isn't as horrible as one guy told me (""the worst beer I've ever had""), but I think most of it is going down the drain so I can drink something I really like. The smoke is way overdone here (though Alaskan Smoked Porter is very smoky and I love it), and it is almost cloyingly sweet too. I'm not really a drain pour type of guy unless something is infected, but I will be going against my typical tendencies in this case."

"Overall - Almost like smoked barleywine taste wise. I'm not a fan of smokey beers.. and this one didn't do anything to change my opinion. Fans of the style will surely enjoy this."

"Did the brewer hit his mark...YES. Do I love this beer....Not Really. Poured from a 22 oz. bomber into a pint glass, Charkoota Rye is an amber-brown in the glass, with a thin, off-white head; almost a cola-like appearance. Nose is of sweet, dark, roasty malts; black licorice, molasses, smoked peat, burnt chocolate and coffee are all present. The taste is similar to the nose with the smoky characteristics coming to the forefront. The beer is dry but not terribly acrid with a very thin carbonation. The increased ABV increases the drying effect but doesn't seem quite as high as the 8.4% listed on the bottle. Overall, as drinkable for a beer as strongly flavored and high in alcohol as a beer like this can be."

"Bottom Line: If you like smoked beers this is right up your alley!"

"Overall: Really disappointing, as the tartness takes the doppelbock in an unexpected and not particularly well-balanced direction"
"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, 2010 vintage. Pours a clear and extremely dark reddish brown color with a small light tan head with ok retention that reduces to a a ring of lacing. Light spotty lacing on the glass. Aromas of big caramel, smoked meat, molasses, raisin, prune, toast, bread, oak, herbal, earth, chocolate, toffee, and rye. Very nice aromas with great balance and complexity. Taste of big caramel, toffee, raisin, prune, molasses, smoke, bread, oak, chocolate, toast, herbal, earth, rye, and light peppery spiciness. Lingering notes of dark fruit, caramel, molasses, smoke, toast, earth, and rye on the finish for a good bit. Great balance of all flavors; with a very nice amount of complexity. Smokiness is not overpowering and compliments the style nicely. Minimal cloying sweetness. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy, slick, and slightly syrupy mouthfeel as expected for the style. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Definitely a sipper, but is still very smooth. Overall this is an excellent smoked doppelbock. Very nice flavor complexity and balance, and very smooth to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering, well done."
"This was underwhelming, this brewery is very hit & miss. This one misses, a chore to finish"
""

"O- Heavily smoked to the edge of overpowering, but it's a ""smoked beer," right? Good sipper. 22 oz. seems to be the perfect serving size. I'm looking forward to pairing the rest with some Michigan-made sausages from Little Town (cheddar and onion or mushroom Swiss). Great beer for a warm Memorial weekend on the deck."

"This is a nice drinking, smoked beer. I find this style to be an acquired taste and am glad that I didn’t dismiss it after my initial foray. This one was enjoyed after a long, snowy day."
"O: Overall nice drinkability, good level of smokiness, smoothly balanced. Most smoked beers are conservative, this one leans more towards the aggressive side but finds the sweet spot and balance just right, worthy repeat."
"O: Charkoota Rye is my favorite smoked beer. Ever. I think smoking the malted barley over cherry wood really distinguishes the smoke character. And compliments the doppelbock style very well. Frankly, I'm shocked that this beer isn't rated higher..."
"I'm going to excuse the nose in the overall portion of my review. I am a huge fan of smoked beers and I especially like when they involve malty sweetness. This beer absolutely delivers in both departments. The rye is a great complement to the smoked malt also. I will be looking for a fresh bottle of this in the future."
"Overall wow I didn't expect such a dry, peat flavored experience from this. Avoid unless you really love rye and smoked wood."
"D: Wow! 2010 vintage (double wow) – this ages/cellars super well. Looking at other reviews (and from my own experience with smoke beers), this must have been quite a bit more smokey when fresher. It still has plenty of smoke, but the focus is now more on the very rich and reasonably complex malts. Full of great flavors that transition around – dark, malty, sweety, smokey, spicy rye, and a great rich feel. This is a great treat."
""

"O: I am not a huge smoked beer fan, but this seems fairly well done. There is a huge smoked malt presence, which is great for a sipper but detracts from the drinkability. There is no way I could have more than 8-10oz. of this, and it would be best paired with an indulgent, pungent food."
""
""
""
"Overall a very tasty brew. Paired perfectly with homemade split pea soup with ham, carrots and sweet onions. An easy drinking beer, but heartwarming at 8%."
"wouldn't seek this one out. It suffers from an identity crisis and fails to create an identity of its own at the same time. not impressed."

"Pours a deep amber to black in color with a light tan head. In the aroma, caramel and maple syrup. In the taste, maple syrupy and a small smoke presence. A small bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry and smokey kind of aftertaste. Syrupy and smokey, a bit sweet but it is OK."
""

"This is smoked rye dopplebock. Burgundy-brown in color. The smoke aroma fills the glass and is the first thing I noticed—as well as the last. There’s some notes of sweet smoked woods (applewood? Cherrywood?) that approximate, in my mind, a combination of the fruit and grilling. It has a sharp, focused flavor—the smokiness dominates, definitely, with enough maltiness to give it body and heft, and a dopplebock sweetness to balance it out. I’d definitely try it again."
""
"Overall: this is a great beer for a BBQ or big juicy steak. The smokiness is nicely balanced with the other flavors in the beer."

"4.5 D: I enjoyed this quite a bit. A couple categories could have been a bit higher, so thus a higher score here. Great balance between the smoke and the doppelbock."
"Bottle: Poured a dark brown color beer with a nice thick brown foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of smoked malt is quite intense with light caramelized notes also noticeable. Taste is dominated by a great malt base with loads of smoke notes with some caramelized notes with light molasses. Body is quite full with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. This has to be one of the most smoked beer outside of the original German smoked beer."
"O: I thought there was a perfect amount of smoke to this beer; not overly smoky at all. The carbonation could have been toned down a smidge, but overall this is was a very enjoyable beer. Thanks for the bottle, Jay."
"Overall: I thought this beer was quite good at first, but it got harder to drink as I made my way through the pour. There was a slightly weird aftertaste that I wasn't a huge fan of."
"Not for me. The smoke flavor is way too intensified, making more than a few ounces impossible."
"O - I'm really liking this beer the flavor is wonderful and keeps me coming back for more if you like smoked beers this is one to get your hands on"
"O - A pretty awesome rauchbier err dopplebock or whatever category this beer falls under. It is pretty tasty."
"drinkability is not great. weird and bacony. i like my beer and bacon separate."
"Finished like an APA or even IPA. Smoke was present but not overpowering, and while it went well with the spicy meaty pizza, I would really like to try it with real slow-smoked BBQ. This is a new batch on tap, and I'm really aching to pop open the 2010 vintage bottles found at RePete's Party Store in Holland, MI."
"Tasted like last night's campfire too!"
"Pours a deep brown color, off white head forms and leaves wispy lace. Aroma is malty, peaty, and somewhat sweet smelling with mild campfire suggestions. The flavor follows the nose to a point, with brown sugar, caramel, munich malts, molasses and a touch of smoke. I did not find the smoke to be overbearing, it melded nicely with the rye notes. Smooth and almost creamy, a well made lager that I would definately have again. Would be a great candidate to marinate pork as well."
"I sampled this beer on tap at New Holland on 08/13/2011. The color was a rusty copper with a slight head. The smoke in the aroma was very apparent but not overpowering. I believe the key to a good smoked beer is for the flavor to not be sensely murdered by saltiness as is the case in Three Floyds Ham & Rye. The other problem with smoke beers is not enough flavor. This beer is well balanced. It has a nice smoke taste without being overly salty. It goes down very smooth. Unlikely a number of smoke beers, you can drink more than a sample without becoming bored. The aftertaste stays on the tongue for a while, but is able to go with a meal and not kill the flavor of the meal. It is certainly among the more balanced smoke beers."
"It's put forth as a smoked beer, and it brings it - thus I'm rating it very high."
"Maybe this is served a bit to cold but no notes on the bottle as far as rec. temp. Just removed from fridge and let set for about 10 min before opening. There is nothing that really steps forward for me. Even after reading the label again I can't figure this out. Very interesting but not something I would like again."
"Quite a hefty body and sweetness to balance a deft hand on the smoke. Somewhere between campfire char and hickory smoked bacon, caramel and bready malts which border on syrupy but hold the smoke in check, earthy and slightly spicy rye, molasses, dark fruits, light drying finish. I'm not often a huge fan of smoke beers but this one is done well, they rye gives a nice complexity and the body is hefty enough to balance."
"This is a good beer, but I prefer the Aecht Schlenkerla urbock, which is more balanced compared to this. I don't pick up on any Rye at all."
"Knock off that medicinal bent on this and the drink will sing, but otherwise it has a glaring fault."
"O: The beer goes down rather smoothly and isn’t that difficult to drink because the smokiness is not overpowering."
"Pours a very, very dark brown with a bit of a mahogany tint to it. Two-finger tan head forms but then dies down pretty quickly. Good partial cap with quite a few bubbles. The nose brings a slight amount of roasted malt along with a good dosing of smoke. Not as much smoked meat; more toward the bonfire end of the spectrum. Some charred wood there. Flavor has a good smoke presence along with a bit of bacon. Moderate roast as well. Medium body with a dry smokey character. Moderate carbonation. Interesting brew; glad to try this."
"Drinkability- although interesting, I don't see searching this out again."
"O: Perhaps a bit too much smoke and not really very balanced."
"A pretty solid brew that has the distinct smokey character of how smoke would really act. It just finds its way around the edges and builds lightly to fill the center of the palate. Fans of Smoked beers will most likely enjoy this balanced Doppelbock take of the style by New Holland. I know I did."
"This is a go-to for me and one of my favorites. This particular bottle doesn't live up to my memory, but I set the bar pretty high for it. It is indeed super-rich, so I'd recommend sharing this one unless you're super into smoke and malt."
"Overall -- Good, but VERY rich. I wouldn't have possibly been able to put away a whole bottle by myself. The interplay of the woodsmoke and malt sweetness was good. I personally enjoyed the level of the smoke, but I can see others finding it too strong."
"A mighty fine smoked beer. Pours dark, with a moderate white head to complement it. Significant smoked aromas, the whole 9 yards of smoke. Above average mouthfeel comes a great with a rolling maltiness, a little rye, a complex array of smoked malt that keeps the interest. Vert drinkable."
"Decent enough to drink, my only qualm is that I am by myself drinking 22 oz of very smoky beer. I wish I had saved this to share with a friend, because it is probity going to be too much as I get further into the beer."
"I find this beer to be right up my alley. The sweetness and smoke play wonderfully off of each other without being overpowering for me. I'd love to have more."
"From notes, 12-14-10"
"Medium bodied with a good bit of smoke character that lingers throughout into a sweet yet dry finish. Hints of charcoal, bacon, BBQ and campfire but there's a nice balance of sweeter malt notes, especially caramel, toffee and vinous dark fruit. There's some cherry flavor from the wood aging as well as some grape, fig and plum. Well balanced and very drinkable. Not as smokey as I usually prefer but this was a good example of the style."
"I knocked the drinkability down based on my personal preference. I like the beer fine, I just wasn't in a hurry to have a second any time soon."
"M/D- This is really, really, really hard to drink. Mild body, low carbonation, a bit syrupy. I find the faster you drink the easier it is to hide the awful burnt, acrid, smoky, rancid pork flavors. I'd never ever ever suggest this out to anyone ever. I've had worse beers, and as it warmed it went from absolutely undrinkable, to just undrinkable. Least it looked average."
"SKIP SKIP SKIP"
"Let me preface this review by saying I enjoyed the beer but I was expecting more of a dopplebock than rye beer so maybe my expectations were a little off. Poured a reddish-brown body w/ one-finger offwhite head that died quick on top of a malt aroma. Stating the obvious I am w/ that malt aroma; smokey, little meaty, oaky woodiness with some roasted/toasted malts/barley as well as touch of caramel and black cherry. A very meaty-tasting beer, and I like it, but I was hoping for a more fruit and malt complexity in the taste. The beer has a stickiness from some molasses and goes down a tad haggard in a medium body but the toasted malts and rye balance for a dry edge that isn't overpwering. Little sweet but more dry but does mellow as it warms; can't really say there's much to sweet and fruitness other than caramel and cherry."
"All in all a very respectable effort. The degree of smokiness tended to push all other flavors out of the way, detracting a bit from what could have been a more nuanced complexity. (The label boasts of ""rye and four other malts," so assuming that there'd be a good portion of pilsner or munich malt as the base, and probably a carafa malt to deliver the mahogany color, I don't think one can tell form the end product what those other two malts are.) A good beer for the rauch-heads."
"Poured from a 22 oz. bomber into a pint glass, Charkoota Rye is an amber-brown in the glass, with a thin, off-white head; almost a cola-like appearance. Nose is of sweet, dark, roasty malts; black licorice, molasses, smoked peat, burnt chocolate and coffee are all present. The taste is similar to the nose with the smoky characteristics coming to the forefront. The beer is dry but not terribly acrid with a very thin carbonation. The increased ABV increases the drying effect but doesn't seem quite as high as the 8.17% listed on the bottle. Overall, as drinkable for a beer as strongly flavored and high in alcohol as a beer like this can be."
"Burnt log smoke mixes with molasses sweetness that, for me, is a bit overpowering. I love the Schlenkerla beers, but this one is cloyingly too sweet. Bits of peppery rye come in, but mostly just adds up to a jumbled mess of un-melded flavors. I can appreciate the heavy smoke, but everything else about it does not fly with me. A half a bomber was about 8 ounces more than I wanted."
"Lightly carbonated, with oily slickness. This brew makes a great conversation piece."
"D: Goes down easily, not too filling, nice kick, and an interesting take on the style. I really enjoyed this beer and would seek it out again."
"This is a good beer if you like a smoked brew. It has a lot going on and is a little complicated for my taste, but pretty good."
"Drink this with warm sandwich of black forest ham on dark rye with swiss cheese and whole grain mustard. I'd be more than happy to buy another one of these, real props to New Holland's brewer."
"This one melds the smokiness into the beer and does a nice job at it. Give it a try even if you don't like smoked beers."
"And it loves me."
"This beer pours a very dark brown, it is clear but you have to look close because it is so dark with a tan head. The smell is awesome, a spicy smoky malt, really smoky, really malty with a peppery note. This is the best smelling beer I have ever had, hands down. The taste is more of the same, I wish I had a smoked pork plate to go with this, peppery spice, caramel malt, and a hint of ethanol. The body is thick and heavy, but is it very drinkable becasue is tastes so good. This is an exceptional beer."
"Overall, phenomenal smoked beer. The first smoked beer I have tried and certainly not the last. Great job New Holland!"
"Mouthfeel was not very pleasent, but palatable as a sipper at room temperature. I mean no disrespect to the folks over at New Holland, as the 'Hatter is a class act."
"Well you win some and you loose some, and this time I guess I lost. Even though this was a beer that I ended up throwing down the drain I'm not going to judge the brewery. I have had quite a few of their beers and I was really happy with them and this was the first one that was off putting. I would say that if you get a chance to try some of their other stuff , go for it because they are amazing. As far as this beer goes, I'd take it with caution. Maybe you might like it and maybe you will not but hey that's part of the fun of experimenting."
"Really nice rich dark color with a decent head. The smell is nice also with some malt and a strong roast presence. Taste is great for those that love smoke beers (I believe the style is rauchbier). I don't love them. This is good, but not great. I am about to bite into some pulled pork and the bottle suggests this goes great with pork, so I'm looking forward to that. The aftertaste is nice and roasty. Not sure I like that in an aftertaste though. I prefer the bitter pale ale aftertaste. Give it a try, but not my favorite. Not sure I taste much doppelbock here, but the smoke taste is bound to go better with one of these styles rather than something lighter."
"I can't even imagine what they did to create so much bizarre flavor. Weird beer lover, rejoice. Put away a couple of bottles for when one of your wife's blow-hard relatives stops by."
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. Took a couple bites of my smoked turkey, then took about three hits of this beer then poured it down the drain. I should have cooked the turkey in it, now that would have been good. The beer was smokey, nearly black. No head and way to smokey flavored for me."
"D - This is an interesting brew. Light on the smoke flavor with a nice caramel presence."
"Overall, I was impressed. I am not much on smoked beers, but it grew on me. I would buy this again."
"D: This beer was overpowered by the smoke character, ruining an otherwise very good beer. Moderation and balance could really benefit this, but instead the rye wasn't even discernible. The body was alright, and the alcohol was well hidden. But the beer still wasn't easy to drink because it was just overly smoky."
"D: By far one of the best beers I have had with cherry smoked malt. Sometimes they become a little too cloying, but this one is strong, and beautiful. Well crafted, clean and delicious."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied and carbonation is moderate, to low. Drinkability is good, I really liked the smoky flavors to it. It's definitely a smoke centered beer and probably fits more in the rauchbier category. I really liked the malty and fruit flavors this had as well, and they made a great base for the smoke. Everything came together very nicely and made for a very flavorful beer overall. If you don't like smoked beers though, this one isn't for you."
"I tried this beer at a tasting and after one pour I realized that this in fact was the worst beer I have ever had. It lo oks promising and pours a nice thick black with a decent head but the taste is just awful. I don't like bacon amd that's all I could taste. I ended up not even finishing my taste because it turned my stomach. I live new holland but this is something I would not recommend to anyone."
"M + D: Mouthfeel is a little fuller, though still rather smooth and semi-creamy. Carbonation is moderate, and suitable for the style. I think New Holland has put out a quality offering with this one, and I look forward to returning to it from time to time... especially when the fall chill starts to settle in!"
"Pours a clear, dark brown. 1/3 inch head of an pale tan color. Good retention and decent lacing. Smells of strong smoke, sweet malt, hint of roasted malt, hint of hops, and slight yeast. Fits the style of a Doppelbock. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of strong smoke, sweet malt, roasted malt, slight yeast, and slight hops. Overall, the smoke dominates; more reminiscent of a rauchbier, than a doppelbock."
"All in all, a very interesting drinking experience from New Holland. An enjoyable brew for sure, but a bomber is probably more than enough."
"Not too smoky and rather balanced."
"In lesser hands, a smoked rye doppelbock with rye malt might have been a mess. New Holland has the chops to carry it off and has a winner with this multi-faceted lager. If they haven't already, the brewery needs to give serious consideration to seasonal release. Crisp afternoons, burning autumn leaves, college football games... and a bomber of Charkoota Rye."
"drinkability: decent selection. would try again, probably one of the best smoked beers I have had."
"Pouts a deep brown, almost black color with a thin tan head that retains OK. The aroma has a nice bacon scent upfront, along with some rye, dark fruits, caramel and licorice, soy sauce and a bit of alcohol. The taste has a more subdued smoke character than the aroma, along with some caramel and toffee sweetness, some fig and date, licorice, a rye sharpness and a little soy sauce. The mouthfeel is a little ligher than expected but no unpleasant, and drinkability is good for a high alcohol smoked beer. Pretty solid smoked beer here, nothing mind blowing but worth a purchase."
"The beer starts off sweet, and remains sweet because of the low hop character. Residual sweetness lingers on the mouth surfaces and keeps the beer from the malty-drying finish that classic Dopplebocks do. Still, a pleasure to drink."
"Overall, this beer is definitely drinkable but the flavor and smokiness may be too much for the palate if I had more than 1. Definitely worth getting again for a good change of pace."
"The beer pours a dark, brownish-red with a cream colored head. The aroma is smoky and smells somewhat like burnt plastic. The flavor is roasted malt, meaty BBQ smoke and some chocolate. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. An interesting doppelbock that I hope to try again."
"D - I mean, unless you're the kind of weirdo that actually wants to DRINK things that taste like bacon this is not drinkable at all."
"Drinkability - a definite rauch-doppel hybrid. Good beer, but limited appeal despite. I would like to try this with some smoked pulled pork or even brisket."
"Pours a deep, mostly clear dark brown, with ruby tints evident when light is present. The soapy head dissipates rather quickly, leaving a weak bit of lacing. The nose showcases a battle between smokiness and sweetness (sorta syrupy). The taste shows that smokiness has the upper hand, giving a campfire-side impression for the tongue. That sweetness, though, remains in the back, keeping that initial conflict alive on the tongue. The moderate body slickly passes through the body, allowing for a fairly high drinkability (especially if, if you're like me, you enjoy a good smoky beer)."
"22oz Bomber. A clear dark blood red pour with a very small short lasting soapy head , some spotty lacing , light carbonation . Aroma smells like a campfire , lots of wood smoke , a light sweetness and a a bit of spice. Flavor is of artifical liquid smoke , bacon grease , dry wood and dusty grain , long salty ham like finish , slick mouthfeel with an oily texture, full body , not what I would call sessionable at all . I was really looking forward to trying this, Someone must like this somewhere right ? I love you guys at New Holland and love your other beers but this one is just not for me , sorry ."
"New Holland is one brewery that's been hit and miss for me. Charkoota Rye belongs with the latter. The nose is weak, the flavor's jumbled and never comes together, and it's too thin. Despite all that, it's still not terrible beer. It's just not very good either. If you're big into smoke flavored beers, then this may be for you. Otherwise, take a pass."
"Reddish brown in color; very appealing. Smell is amazing: distinct smoke smells with a hint of bacon. Tastes great. Smoke flavor, subtle chocolate. I love Rye. This wouldbe great with a burger, steak, chicken, anything off the grill. Would definitely get more of this and other brews."
"Feel is actually a tad thin for all of the flavors that accompany this drink. Slightly syrupy at times. Surprisingly easy to drink, for 8%, for this smoke-fiend."
"Very good, very odd, very original. This was an experiment that could have gone horribly wrong, but the balance here is good & leaves one wondering whether this is a smoked doppelbock or doppelbock with a bit of smoke. Nicely done."
"This DB doesn't conform all that exactly to style, yet is interesting as a smoked DB, especially if smoky beers interest you which they do me. I think it would suit many as a dinner pairing with particular foods more than a straight up drinking beer."
"Taste is smooth and crisp... then bam! Smoked bacon all over your palate! Really cool beer and if you like bacon, you'll love it!"
"D- I like smoked beers that put some beer flavors with the smoke. This beer is all smoke and all band-aids with other flavors buried. It was tough to get through a full bottle."
"D- I give it credit for trying and the alcohol is well hidden. It is just something that does not belong in a bomber, or if it is- just plan on sharing with a friend. Would probably make a good marinade as well."
"Overall, I'd give an A+ for trying something different, but this is just too much."
"(D)- Good smoke flavor & aroma, but where is the rest? Too sugary sweet. This would be great to cook with though. It says pairs well with pork; I would agree with that."
"Rye is all over the body of the beer, however what makes it special is what they did with that rye. Compared to other Rye beers that are out on the market. This gives a twist to the style that makes it all worth while."
"D - Not bad. The smoke flavor is actually at a really good level as it's flavorful and not overpowering the senses, it's just not matched in careful consideration by malts or rye. It's another sugary and fairly one-dimensional beer from New Holland. They suggest that it be paired with pork and I think that would be really good with this beer."
"Crystal clear dark cherrywood appearance. Bubbly beige head caps it off. Loods very inviting...Aroma is quite nice. Just what I was expecting...rich malt mixed with some thick smoke. Smoke and malt enter the mouth side by side with a lot of authority. They work together quite nicely. The malts are fairly rich. The smokiness is really the main player. The rye doesn't contribute much to the flavor in my opinion. The mouthfeel is nice and round. Full body. Low carbonation, which is good. Quality stuff here. Very enjoyable."
"I understand ... smoked beer is an art and it's easy to over-do it. New Holland makes fantastic beers ... but this one is just kinda nasty."
"I love this beer - one of the strangest, more interesting I've had recently. I think I agree with the reviewers who found this like a camping trip. Maybe better with friends. But its not one to finish the evening with, alone on a Saturday night."
" A must try for smoke-beer lovers, and certainly worth a try for a unique taste experience"
"Drinkability = delicious. There's a lot of flavor to this, & I didn't catch much of a buzz from it. Smoked beers are a rarity for me, & I really enjoyed this."
"I really wish I would have had the patience to save this until I had something good for dinner to pair it with. Pairing this one with any kind of homecooked comfort food seems like it would work nicely."
"Nice chestnut color. Very clean looking. Not a lot of carbonation evident. Huge smoke aroma up front-in fact that's all there is here. Somewhat of a wet canvas odor. Reminds me of a boy scout camping trip in a glass! While the odor dominates, the flavor is much of the same-a deep and woodsy smoke taste. Very malty but the smoke tends to dominate even that. Lingering, somewhat fruity sweetness. Hops are nowhere to be found. While nowhere near balanced it seems to work. I can imagine this with a pulled pork sandwich or some juicy ribs. Body is appropriate for style. While I almost want to dis this for being overbearing smoke wise I cannot. To hell with any sort of style. The blend of smoke and somewhat sweet woodsy flavor, along with a damp mustiness is really well done. It is like camping in your living room without your eyes burning. I love it in it's own weird way."
"I am a huge fan of New Holland Brewery (creators of my favorite brew - Dragon's Milk) and have tried quite a few of their brews. I bought this beer on brand recognition alone, as I know that I typically don't dig the smoked style. True to form, I still can't get around the smoke. You can't win them all, but NHB still has at least one fan."
"Drinkability: I like all of the different flavor combos in this unusually complex beer. The alcohol is well hidden. Most of the flavors are subtle and do not hit right away. This is a beer to savor and one I will look for again."
"Pours a clear, dark ruby color with a quick beige head and pretty good bubbling too. The aroma is of heavy smoke, meat, campfire, and some smoked apricots. The taste is super smokey of charred meet up front. The a more woody iddle with some carameled candy and camfire. The finish is of faint caramelized apricots and cherries, hint of burnt sugar and smoked oak barrels. The palate is smokey, rich and warm, but not hot or boozey. Don't really pick up any rye notes with this RYE dopplebock, bu its still pretty good."
"Drinkability is great. For a smoked beer, this is a solid example. The smoke is the focus but it is not overdone. Cheers!"
"D - High drinkability for its strength. I'm a sucker for rye beers, so when I saw a smoked rye doppelbock, I knew I had to give it a try. At the same time, I've had mixed feelings about rauchbiers in the past, so I was pleasantly surprised to find something with a more subtle smoke flavor that didn't overwhelm the rest of the beer. Well done, New Holland!"
"Thankfully, the taste delivers the smoke. Ashy campfire smoke up front. Herbal bitterness tries to hide in the background. Smoked meats and sweetish fruits blend nicely mid-palate. A little rummy cookie dough near the finish. Lingering smoke and malt sweetness. Some herbal bitterness. Medium-full body with a syrupy, slightly under-carbonated feel. I wish this was in 6 packs...we need more smoked beers!"
"22oz bottle labeled as 8.17% abv poured into a Duvel tulip a not dark brown almost black with a decent light-tan head that diminishes to a ring and leaves no lacing on the glass. Aroma is an interesting blend of burnt caramel and sharp rye. The taste is a wonderfully complex blend of rye, burnt caramel, dried fruits and mild cocoa. The beer is on the heavy side of medium with some warming alcohol and mild carbonation. This is a very unique and enjoyable beer, one I'd certainly have again."
"D Not good due to the taste that is not pleasing to me. 2.0"
"D: Amazingly high for a smoked beer. I want another pint and I'd like to buy again. Alcohol seems high though."
"A smoked rye doppelbock...hell yeah.Poured a a full deep amber with a large off white head that settled very slowly,just nice to llok at.Aromas are big in fruity malt with a tinge of sharpness I am guessing from the rye,the smoke is faint at first but some hardwood comes through as it warms.Flavors show of the light smoke the most,not much fruit and or sharpness, some molasses and brown sugar come into a lingering finsish,the mouthfeel is light to medium.Iam guessing its food friendly, but it just seems to be missing something."
"Aroma is smoky, peaty with a pronounced sterile gauze/band aid note. Not a fan. This carries over into the flavor too unfortunately. At room temperature, there's an underlying warm maltiness and light rye spiciness. Even carbonation and a full body. A sipper probably best paired with cured meats. Not the best use of smoked malt, hope they reformulate with less band-aid in the mix next batch."
"Overall, I think the smokiness of the roasted malts overpowers the rye flavor, which I think should be more present. Ryes are supposed to be sweet and rich, not robust and charred. It's almost like drinking charred bbq ribs."
"Whoa! Man, love this beer right off. Yummm.... Served with a large, foamy, light tan head and a little lace. Color is deep dark amber with chestnut hightlights. Aroma is a luscious, rich, smokey, dark malt, raisins, dark ripe fruit, leather, and a bit of dark cocoa. Flavor's about the same with sweetness coming out at the end. Great body and carbonation. Boozy at the very end. A session beer for slow, easy quaffing."
"Medium mouthfeel. Very drinkable - no noticeable alcohol burn, and I'm not getting any rauchbier fatigue."
"Drinkability depends on one's tolerance for smoked beers; I personally enjoyed its uniqueness, and a good rachbier in general, so perhaps you will too."
"Taste: First the malt sweetness. Than the porky smokiness. Smoke lingers on the tastebuds for a while and I get hints of chocolate in the aftertaste. Much more mellow and balanced than I was expecting."
"drinkability is good - i had no problems drinking the bomber but i would not want anymore then that in a night"
"I would have liked more smoke, like some of the Bamburgs have, but there is enough to keep me interested and certainly enough to pair with pulled pork. I'm not the biggest fan of dopples, but I could see myself having another."
"D-Well done, only the second smoked D-bock I have had, the other being Left Hand Goosinator. This one is about as good. A variation on a classic style I am really liking."
