"O- a good mix of drinkability and smoke that doesn't overpower"
"12 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, best before 8/2014. Pours hazy golden straw color with a 1 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a large amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of lemon, apple, wheat, cracker, bread, wood smoke, herbal, grass, pepper, and yeast/smoke earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with well balanced pale malt, smoke, and earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of lemon, apple, wheat, cracker, bread, wood smoke, herbal, grass, pepper, and yeast/smoke earthiness. Minimal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, apple, wheat, cracker, bread, wood smoke, herbal, grass, pepper, and yeast/smoke earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice complexity and balance of pale malt, smoke, and earthy hop flavors; with good robustness and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a very smooth crisp, and slightly bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 4.4%. Overall this is a nice and pleasant gratzer style ale. Good complexity, robustness, and balance of pale malt, smoke, and earthy hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"A very pleasing entry from SA Longshot series.  This resembles a gose but is slightly smokier.  The smoke produces an illusion of salt at the end, or maybe it’s the hops, but whichever, it’s darn good.  If SA produced this regularly, I’d buy it."

"Pours a very hazy orange body with white soda pop head that quickly dissipates. I've never had a gratzer before and I find it very intriguing. Aromas call to mind how I imagine ancient offerings of burnt grains smelled to the nostrils of the gods. Very smokey with a big whiff of wheatiness. I also get small hints of celery and carrot greens. The flavor is straight up smoked wheat through and through, with a sweetness that reminds me of apricot jam spread over wheat toast. The body is a little thin, as the soda-like head suggested. Overall, this is a novelty beer of such unique character that everyone should try it at least once even though they probably won't want to have several back-to-back. I really have nothing to compare this to and so my scores are less useful than my actual comments."

"Pours a hazy lemon-yellow with a white head that fades to a thin layer. Some good-sized bubbles, too, though not rapidly heading northward. A fair scent of toasty wood and smoke, some citrus, a hint of basil. This one is a sweeter-tasting beer at the start, and then it sours and leaves a more bitter finish. It's slightly viscous, but clean. The wheat is a noticeable flavor, as is ginger. Unfortunately, the smokiness is buried after a few sips, and so it begins to taste more like a slightly fizzy, thin-tasting, farm-house pale ale."

"O: A nice smoked wheat beer with a definite focus on smoke while not getting cloying or overly smokey. Very easy to drink and would go great with BBQ or smoked meats"

"Overall, just imagine a summer light ale with mucho flavor, this is what we have here I hope Sam Adams takes some notes from this home brewer and releases something along these lines."

"Poured into a Dogfish Head pint glass. Pours a light to medium straw amber with a one finger white head with good retention and nice lacing. Aroma of sweet malt, mild wheat and some slight campfire smoke. Flavor is mild semi-sweet malt, nicely integrated smoke, mild citrus and wheat. Medium bodied with good carbonation. A lightly smoked, pleasant rendition of this old style. Tamer, less tart and with more pedestrian sweet malt than the Professor Fritz Briem Grodziskie reconstruction, it was still an interesting and nice drinking light beer. The smoke element was distinctive, but light. I enjoyed this one. Could have been quite remarkable with a little more intensity."

"Overall OK, lighter smoke which was needed to not send this overboard, nice creamy like wheat and toasty grain malt with a decent smoked cheese note, fairly flavorful without going overboard. However, just didn't have a whole lot going on, as if they lost something extra when they scaled it up."
"brew."

"Taste is lightly crackery, mild wheat, lightly tart, mild smoke. It's ok, a little bland. Light bodied, the carbonation ebbs away fairly quickly. Overall it was worth a try, but a little too bland."
"Overall: Restrained but quaint, a nice, light smoked ale."
"A reliable Grätzer. Good summertime enjoyment drinking."
"Overall: Pleasantly surprised by this one."

"OVERALL: An impressive smoked wheat beer and deserving of its Longshot achievement. This is a great summer drink, but I could always go for one of these. Really good stuff."
"This was underwhelming. The second underwhelmer out of this year's Longshot batch. The smokey character is certainly decent and improves with warmth. Other than that, both smell and taste is lemon and hint of biscuit. I wouldn't get it again."

"Interesting brew. Perfect for a hot day, but the smoke adds some complexity. Would be nice with bbq."

"Taste-Surprising but welcome dose of smoked malt followed closely by herbal hop notes. Looks can be deceiving as this light-bodied brew delivers a lot of subtle character and tasty flavor. Sessionable with very interesting taste. A perfect match for grilled brats or Cajun blackened fish."

"Pours a hazy light straw color with a huge bubbly white head that persists forever because its fed by a constant stream of carb bubbles. Aromas of spice, bready, wheat, and light yeast and smokey phenols. The flavor is Lightly sweet sugary malt with a touch of spice and a bit of smokey charcoal to counter. Medium body with a moderate to high level of carbonation. Decent enough beer, but not something that excited me or anything I would reach for again."

"The body is light but verges almost into medium territory, but doesn't quite. It shouldn't though, and the light body is one of the delightful oddities. It has a solid crispness, though it's not quite stolid to the end. It eases into the carbonation and levels out. Smoothness is moderate, not quite able to take full effect but pretty good."

"Pours a murky light orange with a foamy beige head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Foamy patches of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of smoked malt, campfire, and earth aromas. Taste is much the same with smoke and fruit flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of smoke bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an above average beer that is drinkable, but the smoke is pretty subtle all around."

"O: I always get a Longshot six pack every year - even if they're not the best beers, they're always fun to try. While this one isn't particularly good, it's also unique in that I've never had a gratzer before. Ergo I can't hate this one - still, I think it would be much better with more hoppiness, more lemon tartness, and a drier, more subtle smoke."
"Overall I thought this was a decent beer and I thought it was a solid example of Gratzer, this is the first one I've had one and while I thought it was solid, I don't think I'm too into the style since I don't think the smoke and the Belgian Wit bier base worked that great together and I think just as a smoked beer I would say it's right around average. This beer had decent drinkability, it was smooth, a little clean, crisp and not filling, but the taste didn't do the best job at holding my attention and I think one would be enough for me since I don't really have the urge to drink another one in a row, but I think this would be nice to have in the spring or early fall. What I liked the most about this beer was the balance, when it came to the the taste neither the malt base or the smokey aspect were too overpowering. What I liked the least about this beer was how the smokey aspect worked with the Belgian Wit Bier base, it just didn't meld together that great and I felt like the orange rind and coriander aspect clashed with the smoke. I wouldn't buy this beer on it's own and I wouldn't recommend it. All in all I wasn't too impressed with this one, it left me wishing that the flavors worked together better and i thought that made it a little rough around the edges. This is isn't my favorite smoked beer or my favorite Longshot beer, I just don't think it's too memorable. As a whole i wasn't too impressed with this years LongShot series and I thought the American Stout was the best beer in the Six pack with the Pineapple IPA was my least favorite by a good amount, the 2012 Longshot six pack is still far and away my favorite year for this series. I appreciate the effort, but this one just wasn't for me, better luck next time."

"O: A nice smokey character with good drinkability and a bit of sweetness. Not something I would drink regularly, but this was nice. Good job Cesar!"

"Moderately hazy with a pale golden color. A half inch head of tightly woven foam rests on top,but most of it fades. A trace of Brussels lacing is present. Aroma of pale wheat with a slightly sweet faint overly ripe banana note. The flavor provides a nice burst of smokiness that dominates the front of the pale. You get a rush of pale wheat and then on the fade a deep campfire like smokey fade. I wish there was a bit of the smokiness in the aroma to join it as it catches you off guard. The body is light and crisp."

"Wishing that the taste were more acute, I look for a dive into full-on Berlinerweiss for improvement. This could also tame the smoky current that seems to wonder the palate aimlessly."
