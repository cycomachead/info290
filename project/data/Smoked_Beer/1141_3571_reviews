"Would have it again if offered; if you randomly come across it, go nuts, otherwise don't sweat it.  (3.75)"

"Reddish brown, ring of white head, some lace. Smell is smokey, meaty with lots of BBQ and campfire aromas, faint touch of peat, more or less a malty smokey affair all the way through. Taste is like the nose, smoke and malt, BBQ and meaty flavours, just a touch of lightly salty peat, more campfire aftertaste. Medium carbonation, medium body, good feel. Solid and worth drinking again, basically a second rate Schlenkerla which is quite the compliment for this style."
"Overall. Nice for the style. The smoke is in check which is always nice and the beer comes through. Thanks again SebD!"

"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with good flavors and aromas."

"O: Pretty good beer. I found it a bit more potent than Aecht Schlenkerla, which has sort of become the front all smoked beers are now based on, for me anyways. Whereas i found Aecht sessionable or a everyday beer this was a bit more bold, but non the less an astounding beer and kudos to Dieu du Ciel for another great beer."

"D - A decent smoked beer. I'd drink it again if there were limited options available, but I can think of plenty of smoked beers or Dieu du Ciel offerings I'd much prefer. Appreciate the lower ABV."

"On tap at Dieu du Ciel!. Pours a dark mahogany color with an inch of frothy head. Lots of lacing. The aroma reminds me of a campfire. Smokey malts with an almost meaty smoke aroma, kind of like bacon. The taste is of the smokey malts and earth. Burnt leaves and a campfire. Dry with some charred oak. The mouthfeel is somewhat light and thin which help makes this brew more drinkable considering the amount of smoke flavor. I love this style of beer but haven't been able to find many really good ones. Overall, this is the best Rauchbier I have ever had (thus far)."

"MF: It seems that I have ashes in my mouth, but surprisingly, it's good!"

"Overall, nice stuff. The taste is not as overwhelmingly smokey as the nose suggests. Still pretty intense, but more balanced and quite enjoyable."
""

"If you like smoke, you get a ton here. Kind of takes an Islay malt flavor profile on. If you don't like smoke, go elsewhere."

"O - I haven't had many Rauch style beers and this was very enjoyable and refreshingly different to what I normally drink. I paired this with pepperjack cheese and it was nice combo."
"Pours brown and clearish with a light tan ring that doesn't last. Smells of smoky meat and BBQ. The body begins with a very BBQ finish with burnt meat notes in it. Lingers with bacon. No perceptible bitterness, but the smoke lasts forever on the palate. I could imagine enjoying this beer with a good pulled pork..."
"Pours a dark ruby hue which leaves a two finger head that dissapates to leave an outer rim of lacing that also coats the sides of the glass,the smell is smoked ham,roasty malts and a touch of herbal hops,the mouthfeel is light bodied and has tastes of smoked malts,stonefruits,a touch of cherry,caramel and is finished with a spicy dryness and overall this is a nice smoked beer that lets the other flavours shine through but for me i like a little more smoke and in saying that this would be a nice crossover for the person who doesnt like a full smokey SB cheers."
"Got nothing on Aecht Schlenkerla, but nice stuff none the less."
"A really nice Rauchbier. Obviously this style isn't to everyone's taste but I think it works really well and is a delicious example of the style."
"Pours a deep violet/burgundy, creamy offwhite cap that laces well. Nose is a rich meaty and woody smokiness, with some faint underlying sweetness. Taste is a slight change of pace as smoke and rich caramel notes present themselves in unison, taking turns presenting themselves on the palate. Great malt flavour. Smooth mouthfeel, with moderate lingering smoke and caramel sweetness. Heavy medium in body and a lower medium carbonation. Very drinkable and solid, if on the sweeter side, smoked offering."
"Excellent taste, too. Peaty, smoky, but not overpowering, not caustic in the throat. Sweet malt fades into the smoke, leaving a pleasant smoky aftertaste. This is a really nice beer. First time I've had it and with the year on it, it's really held up well. Now to seek it out fresh..the new chore upon me."
"Picked this up on a trip to montreal. Completely different beer now from the frist time I had it. The beer is almost porter-like in how dark it is. It has a nice dense white head which lingers and leaves a bit of lacing. This beer smells like eating bacon and beef jerky at a campfire. There is a little bit of grainyness and nuttiness but really it is all about the smoke here. The taste just has more and more hickory bacon smokiness with a mild nutty sweetness to lend a bit of balance. The mouthfeel is a little light and is also lacking a bit of carbonation. Would definitely benefit from a bit more. Overall, this beer is an experience more than anything else. Huge smokiness when fresh. I would love to see something like this as a bigger beer, but I would be afraid I couldn't handle any more smoke."
"Pours lightly smokey yellow with lasting three-eighths of an inch lasting head. Slightly smokey aroma. very good taste, with controlled smoked malt, and a sweet spicey finish that satisfies. Average mouthfeel, smooth, Very drinkable.A lovely smoked beer, thanks Luc!"
"DDC would sit comfortably in my top 8 Canadian breweries but this beer doesn't do much for its position there. It seems to be one of those cases where a great beer was turned into a good beer by lacking in just one aspect; the mouthfeel. If making a fuller body entails increasing the alcohol content, I'd say it's more than worth it. This one's worth a try but can't contend with many other DDC offerings."
"Pours a light brown colour with a finger of tan head. Some mild lacing around the glass. Nice head retention until the end. Smells of campfire/chimney smoke with some roasted malt and chocolate. This seems to be a smoked porter, or at least similar enough to that. Very smooth carbonation level. A nice beer and anyone that likes smokey beers should try this."
"Overall a very fine example of the style and one that is extremely drinkable. I had no issues with putting this one down quickly and easily."
"A clean and crisp finish makes the Charbonniere a very easy drinking beer and would pair perfectly with anything off the grill, or even a smooth cigar."
"Definitely couldn't slam a smoked beer at the best of times. This is okay, but drinkable is not the word that springs to mind."
"A really wonderful smoked beer, full of flavour and very classic."
"Pour out a clear brown with an off white head. Smelled like smoked bacon, salami, and caramel malts. The taste as packed with a huge smoked meat taste. Very smooth and not overpowering though. The flavor lasted a while after you swallowed and you get a nice integration of a campfire flavor and brown malts. I wish this beer wasn't so thin. I would've liked it to have some more body. This was definitely one of the best smoked beers I've had and I'm not a very big fan of the style."
"Drink - This is definitely an interesting beer, but not my sort of thing. Points for originality, but lacks drinkability. 1 is more than enough."
"I have to give it credit by saying that they tackled this beer really well for what it is. It's damn close to being really good, but falls just a tad short."
"Overall a nice smoke beer. God spice as well."
"This was my first from Dieu du Ciel, and I was overall impressed. I would much prefer this to the Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier, which is a little too overwhelming to enjoy an entire bottle of. However, the smokiness is still very much more pronounced than something like Stone's Smoked Porter, or other beers where the smoke flavor is just an addition (opposed to the centerpiece). Would only recommend to those familiar with rauchbiers, but because of its mildness, serves as an excellent introduction to the style."
"D: This definitely takes a different approach on the style. It's much easier to drink than the other because it's not as strong, but I feel like it's a little to weak. Good beer to try, but nothing else."
"Not bad at all, and a nice pairing with our food. Its certainly very drinkable for a fairly one-dimensional beer."
"Very well integrated smoke, doesn't overwhelm like some. Helped out by a nice grassy, minerally hop bitterness in the finish which, when paired with the malt base, almost reminds me of an alt + smoke. A little thin in the body but the lack of heft makes this more of a plain ol' drinker, especially with the well integrated smoke. Would gladly drink it again, paired well with BBQ. Thanks Robbo!"
"This could be even more drinkable than Aecht Schlenkerla, in spite of being a lesser beer overall. Especially drinkable as a smoked beer, I could session this if I felt like something smoky. This would actually be great to drink a bunch of while sitting around a fire on a cool summer evening."
"Bottle: Poured an amber color ale with a large off-white foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of smoked wood with caramel malt in the background. Taste is also a nice mix between some deep smoky notes and smoked salmon with some lightly sweet caramel malt. Body is about average with good carbonation. Very well done with nice balance between the smoke and the malt bill."
"Poured into my Sam Adams perfect pint glass this is a slightly reddish dark brown beer with a reasonable head. What you really notice is the intense smoky nose that grabs your attention. The beer is a solid ale with all sorts of smoked malt. The finish is dry and the smoke lingers on your tongue. Great beer as I love smoked beer and cheese. Goes well with Morrocan Lamb Stew"
"thanks hoser for this one and the glass I poured it in to for that matter. my only regret with this beer is I have no BBQ to pair with it and no campfire to hypnotize me while I drink it"
"Not a bad beer and I won't trash it. I suspect that those who like bitter smokey beers will love this. I'm just not sure I'm one of them."
"Overall: I'm not usually attracted to smoke beer but i found this beer to be really good and would recommend it if you can handle a moderate smoky presence."
"Dark color beer. It is dark brown with a creamy head on top. As usual with this brewery, the head stick well to the glass. The aroma is smoked!... wow I like this. I get some bacon in there too. No hops. On the taste side, it is smoked again. Everywhere from start to finish. More like a smoked wood than bacon, however. The taste is better than the smell. A bitterness in the end, however it is not strong. One good thing is the taste lingers in the mouth for a good amount of time. We note also the carbonation in the mouth. A good smoked beer."
"Very interesting overall, but I probably wouldn't have more than one in a sitting. Best use would be as an accompaniment for food, such as stew or chili. Better yet, as an additive for making food, such as part of a marinade for the grill, or as part of a stir fry (which I used it in this evening)."
"EDIT: Since my review, I've downed a four pack of this and am really starting to enjoy it. I never wanted to buy smoked beers before and I just might be starting a craving for them. This is good beer."
"I'm not entirely sure why this isn't classified as a Rauchbier, as the otherwise heady maltiness is quite thoroughly overshadowed by the ingrained meaty smokiness - does it have something to do with protected place names, or some other such nonsense?"
"This starts off malt but goes to all smoke quickly. Good body with a relatively low level of carbonation. This is a beer that'll grow on you."
"belle bière cuivrée claire où un col épais et blanc trône, le nez de cette bière fumée est évidemment très fumé, mais très fumé, en bouche c'est la même chose une bonne pale ale, avec des goût de fumé très prononcé. pour amateur de bière fumée !!!"
"On tap at the brewpub. I wias looking forward to this one. Standard amber colour with good clarity and white head. You can definitely pick up the wisp of smoke in the nose. Just like a recently snuffed out campfire. Taste is more moderate than I thought it would be. The smoke is definitely there, but not in your face or harsh. I dont pick up much in the hop department, just a mildly smokey, easy driking amber ale. Would have been nice to spend more time there and settle into a couple of these."
"Tastw wise, the smoked flavours hits you but are quite balanced betweem the smokiness, hops and yeasty spicy flavours. Shy BBQ flavours such as hickory. Well balanced"
"D: An approachable smoked beer."
"Taste: The smoke factor is spread out very well on the palate. It hits you solidly at first, balances out in the middle with a very solid malt structure and finishes long with hickory traces. They should brew this more often."
"Very inspiring light brown/red color. Good bouquet that doesnt quite reveal what you're going to taste, spices, forest. As the commercial description says : ""The smoky taste is quite dominant at each new draught"". We'd regret the smoky taste for long if it'd ever quit the mouth. and while it's so long-lasting, it remains comfortable and light with slight hints of salmon in the finish. This remains rather retrained for the smoke lover I am and imo not exactly Dieu Du Ciel's best take at the famous Bamberg style"
"edit: had a pint at the brewpub. everything I said last year stands. This is a great beer. For the record - I've had rauchbier in Bamberg that wasn't as smoky or half as tasty as this. ('twas the Spezial)."
"The smoked malt was also prominent in the taste but not overpowering. Possibly a hint of smoked ham as well and i mean that in a nice way. This beer was not overpowering in its smokey, maltiness but rather it was nicely balanced and offered a good smoked beer in a lighter, easier drinking fashion. A nice woodiness in the finish."
"A rare smoked beer in Canada.  Smoke and toasted hints in aroma from a very light colored beer (as far as most smoked beers go).  Smoke flavors are balanced by a pleasant malt sweetness.  The smoke flavor is not overwhelming."
