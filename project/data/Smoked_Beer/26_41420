4.42,18.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"On tap at the Revolution Brewpub in Chicago this unique brew is a slightly hazed copper color with a thin but very sturdy light oatmeal colored head that leaves a perfect wall of lacing! The aroma lives up to the billing with heavy grilled, smoked ham idea with wheaty-malt rye. Easily worth the price of admission. The flavor gives me sweet smoked ham and herbal hops. I pick up on some pineapple and sprucey hop qualities. This is solidly medium bodied with light carbonation for a somewhat sticky feel. The hop infusion here is just awesome and this is a true keeper. Three Floyd, ya dun it again!","Durge","Apr 11, 2012"

Pours a burnt orange color with a short head that has great retention. Leaves great lacing. Could use a bit of a larger head, but this beer is very good looking. Aroma is mild, but it is very reminiscent of smokey beef jerky and rawhide. Flavor is bacon all the way. Dry smokey bacon rind. Pretty much exactly what I was hoping for. There is a mild fruity quality to the smoke which is pleasant. Mouthfeel is a bit heavy but the carbonation is pretty on point. Very nice smoke beer from FFF.","Agold","Mar 24, 2012"

4.22,13.4,4,4.5,4.5,3,4,"Plenty o' hullabaloo surrounding this beer...let's hope it's worthy. It pours a clear copper-brass topped by a finger of off-white foam. The nose comprises light beech smoke, honey, molasses, ham (straight up), brown sugar, and light black pepper. Damn, does this smell tasty! The taste holds notes of honey-baked ham, very light smoke, rye bread, and a touch of what seems like Swiss cheese at the end. Honestly, this thing tastes very similar to a ham sammy on rye. Wow. The body is a light medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and an oily, greasily slick feel. Overall, this beer lives up to its name. If it weren't for the kind of awkward feel, this would be a truly exceptional, enjoyable brew. Get some!","TMoney2591","May 05, 2011"
4.24,14,3,4,4.5,4,4.5,"O - This beer is a very sublime entry into the Smoked Beer canon. I actually prefer the more obtuse versions (like the Fastenbier in my other hand) but I respect this brew for its rare sophistication in a very blunt genre.","ktrillionaire","May 05, 2011"

4.29,15.3,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"O- Wow... This beer is out of this world. The only downfall of this beer is that a full 16oz is a bit much. At first this was my dads favorite beer of the night, he couldn't believe it- so I traded him for his Gumballhead. I noticed after awhile he wasn't drinking it much anymore. I asked what was up and he said he loves it, but it was just too much. So we traded back and then it was hard for me to finish! Anyway, its a great beer, but a sipper and something to enjoy in small quantities. I really appreciate what FFF did here and the score is fairly high because it is one of the best specialty beers I have ever had and think it truly is masterfully crafted to taste how it does.","TheGordianKnot","May 02, 2011"

3.52,-5.4,3,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"I tried this on tap at the brewpub. This pours a translucent brownish, dirty amber with a one finger off white head. The smell is of weak ham. For a smoked beer I expected a little more. There isn't much pork to it and the smoke is really subtle. It tastes of a ham sandwhich on rye, as I guess it should but it's not really that impressive. I expected the flavors to be more bold. It drank smoothly and was pretty light in body. This beer wasn't anything too special but I'm glad I could try it.","aasher","Mar 09, 2011"
3.85,3.5,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"The beer appears a golden amber hue with a quarter inch of white head that leaves some decent lacing upon the glass. The aroma is of smoke and smoked malt. I don't think I could single out ham, per se, but I could get a sense of smoked meat in the nose. The flavor is decent and follows the aroma. I didn't enjoy this brew nearly as much as my favorite authentic rauchbiers, but it was good nonetheless. The body was a tad thin for my liking.

The nose brings some lightly-smoked malt along with a bit of roasted--you guessed it--ham. There is a bit of bready malt there as well. Taste doesn't quite bring home the bacon like I would have liked, though it certainly wasn't bad. The base malt seemed to take up too much of the flavor. Medium body with a slightly-smokey finish. A good brew, but the taste didn't live up to the nose.","Thorpe429","Sep 14, 2010"
4.52,21.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,5,"Drinkability -- Coming into this beer, I thought it would be an interesting novelty. However, this turned out to be my favorite rye beer to date.

4.22,13.4,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"D - Aptly named, Ham on Rye is an awesome smoked rye beer that virtually duplpicates eating (drinking?) a sandwich. FFF manages to push the envelope yet again with a beer that could have been simply a novelty, but turned out to be fantastic!","ffejherb","0"

4.35,16.9,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"D-Well, I am not going to lie to you--I am a devotee of smoked beers and this one does not disappoint in any way! Mmm, mmm....The spicy aspect works really well and turns this rather mundane smoked amber into a work of art! Ham on Rye--true that! Well done FFF and Piece!","Deuane","Oct 26, 2009"
3.9,4.8,4,4,4,4,3.5,"D- Overall this one lives up to its name, but I could not drink more then one of these due to its sweetness. A very unique beer that I am glad I got to try.","nkersten","Nov 16, 2008"
4.84,30.1,4,5,5,4,5,"Great dark amber color, one of the best smelling beers ever! It obviously smells very smoky, definitely like smoked meat. Great malt, leaves you feeling kinda thirsty. You definitely need a glass of water after this. Has a very thin head, leaves good lacing on the side of the glass. I would pay good money to see this on tap again at FFF. They really had to cut back on some excellent brews once the economy tanked. I feel their pain, but damn they need to brew this one again!","thedrewski86","Nov 11, 2008"
3.97,6.7,3.5,4,4,4,4,"drinkability is great. as rauchbeers go, it is difficult to produce a brew that is this smokey and also provides a malt backbone that works well with the smoke. this accomplishes that to some degree, but it could be better. cheers!","botham","Nov 01, 2008"
3.7,-0.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"This beer is one you have to talk about. You know, that beer you get your friends to try. You either love it or you hate. I LOVED it. Going to have to get a growler to take back to "experiment" with some beer buddies.","TeutonicKnight","Oct 27, 2008"
4.24,14,3.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,"Overall, simply delicious. This has now replaced Black Sun Stout as my favorite Three Floyds beer. Please, for the love of God, start bottling this. I'll figure out how to get it into PA after that.","leftmindedrighty","Oct 11, 2008"
4.11,10.5,3.5,5,4,3,4,"This is a Rauchbier, and meant to be intensely smoky. The authors of low reviews here don't seem to be aware that this is a legitimate beer style.","emerge077","Sep 29, 2008"
3.39,-8.9,3,4,3.5,3.5,2.5,"D: They serve it in an imperial. Could easily be served in a 1/2 pint in which they serve most of their big beers. Uniquely enjoyable, but not one to be sessioned.","tpd975","Sep 13, 2008"
1.94,-47.8,3.5,2,1.5,2.5,2,"No big deal, though, these guys have earned the right to experiment. Still the best brewery in the world, in my opinion.","bassmantin","Apr 29, 2008"
2.75,-26.1,4,4,2,2.5,2.5,"I HATE to give FFF a review like this but here goes. I did not like this brew. I only had a couple sips because I wouldnt have been able to drink anymore than that. Its seriously like a piece of salt ham. I'm sure thats what they were aiming for but its a very wierd taste! Unless you have food you cant drink it IMHO.","iconoklaztor","Apr 08, 2008"
3.78,1.6,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Taste is a knockout rye with a good malt balance and I suppose some hops. This thing really tastes and smells like a ham sandwich. I'm impressed....but....how? I never wanted a ham sandwich so much in my life. Mild carbonation and very smooth. Feels a little thin and mild. Not sure about drinkability just due to the massive rye. One suited me just fine.","kirok1999","Mar 06, 2008"
4.12,10.8,4,4.5,4,4,4,"This needs to be bottled and released as a seasonal beer. It's perfect for that weekend afternoon in the fall when you want to grill a big fat reuben sandwich for a football game.","bgramer","Beers"
3.6,-3.2,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3,"D - a beer that would be a perfect replacement for a kielbasa and sauerkraut meal as the smoky meat taste is so prevalent. On the whole I am not too sure as to how I feel about this beer. It is good and interesting and accomplishes its goal but after a while it started to get old and a bit too much for me. The greasy meat aftertaste started to wear on me and really had no desire to have another. On the whole, I would say this is a beer worth trying but not one that I would try again after having the experience once.","jeonseh","0"
