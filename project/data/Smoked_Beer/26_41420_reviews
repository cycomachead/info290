"On tap at 3 Floyds. Smokey aroma. Very smokey flavors. First beer like this. But not to big of a fan of the smoked malt. Its got a nice bitterness. My girlfriend likes it more than I do. To much like smoke flavors."

"Overall - I like this one a lot, but even I start getting bored by the end of the glass. I think the beer itself gets bored with me because it loses interest in tasting the same."

"O: Not bad, but not as interesting as the rauches of the motherland."
"At first, the brain tells the palate that this will be a slow session to weather. But the 16oz glass is empty within fifteen minutes. The savory aroma and taste of the beer coupled with medium-light textures make it highly drinkable."

"On tap at the Revolution Brewpub in Chicago this unique brew is a slightly hazed copper color with a thin but very sturdy light oatmeal colored head that leaves a perfect wall of lacing! The aroma lives up to the billing with heavy grilled, smoked ham idea with wheaty-malt rye. Easily worth the price of admission. The flavor gives me sweet smoked ham and herbal hops. I pick up on some pineapple and sprucey hop qualities. This is solidly medium bodied with light carbonation for a somewhat sticky feel. The hop infusion here is just awesome and this is a true keeper. Three Floyd, ya dun it again!"

"Had on tap at owen and engine. The restaurant has a great old english pub feel, and this beer is very appropriate for that setting. Pours a burnt orange color with a short head that has great retention. Leaves great lacing. Could use a bit of a larger head, but this beer is very good looking. Aroma is mild, but it is very reminiscent of smokey beef jerky and rawhide. Flavor is bacon all the way. Dry smokey bacon rind. Pretty much exactly what I was hoping for. There is a mild fruity quality to the smoke which is pleasant. Mouthfeel is a bit heavy but the carbonation is pretty on point. Very nice smoke beer from FFF."
"Yum!!! Would have again! And again!"

"I have seen this on draft only twice, would put it in my top 10 of all time and wish it was around more. My score is higher than most since smoke beers are among my favorites, not for all, but if you like the style this is the bomb."
"A good one."

"Overall a very drinkable beer. I would definitely come back to this beer again. Everything is balanced and seems to fit well together."
"Plenty o' hullabaloo surrounding this beer...let's hope it's worthy. It pours a clear copper-brass topped by a finger of off-white foam. The nose comprises light beech smoke, honey, molasses, ham (straight up), brown sugar, and light black pepper. Damn, does this smell tasty! The taste holds notes of honey-baked ham, very light smoke, rye bread, and a touch of what seems like Swiss cheese at the end. Honestly, this thing tastes very similar to a ham sammy on rye. Wow. The body is a light medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and an oily, greasily slick feel. Overall, this beer lives up to its name. If it weren't for the kind of awkward feel, this would be a truly exceptional, enjoyable brew. Get some!"
"O - This beer is a very sublime entry into the Smoked Beer canon. I actually prefer the more obtuse versions (like the Fastenbier in my other hand) but I respect this brew for its rare sophistication in a very blunt genre."
"Interesting. Lots of interesting flavors, rounded, nice smoked ham, light rye, herbal hops are a little iffy though."
"D - This is a very enjoyable and easy-drinking smoked beer. Alcohol is well-hidden. It's less intense than the Schlenkerla beers which makes it easier to have multiple glasses."
"O- Wow... This beer is out of this world. The only downfall of this beer is that a full 16oz is a bit much. At first this was my dads favorite beer of the night, he couldn't believe it- so I traded him for his Gumballhead. I noticed after awhile he wasn't drinking it much anymore. I asked what was up and he said he loves it, but it was just too much. So we traded back and then it was hard for me to finish! Anyway, its a great beer, but a sipper and something to enjoy in small quantities. I really appreciate what FFF did here and the score is fairly high because it is one of the best specialty beers I have ever had and think it truly is masterfully crafted to taste how it does."
"Overall: I was really surprised how much I liked this beer. Tastes kind of liked smokes meat, just what you want out of a good smoked beer. The sweetness complemented the smoke well."
"I’ve enjoyed few beers with names as descriptive as Ham on Rye. It’s just as flavorful and tasty as the sandwich."
"Very interesting. It blows my mind how much like ham this stuff tastes. Well worth a try, just for the experience, but I wouldn't buy copious amounts of this."
"O- This is a very interesting beer. Its not bad by any means just very very different. I had no problem putting this one down and laughing my ass off about how it tastes like a ham sandwich. I don't think I'd drink this one on a regular basis though."
"Definitely the meatiest tasting smoked beer I have had."
"O - I really liked this beer, maybe I'm just on a cured meat kick, but it tastes like a sandwich. A nice change from anything sweet."
"d - A pretty interesting smoked beer. I thought there was more smoke and meat in the flavor than the nose. Not the smokiest I've bad, but pretty enjoyable and glad I got to try it."
"Beer is thinner than expected, not getting much in the way of rye though. It has a nice smokiness to it, decent but ultimately flat one note flavor. One of my least favorite Three Floyds beers to date but I would have it again on draft if possible."
"I tried this on tap at the brewpub. This pours a translucent brownish, dirty amber with a one finger off white head. The smell is of weak ham. For a smoked beer I expected a little more. There isn't much pork to it and the smoke is really subtle. It tastes of a ham sandwhich on rye, as I guess it should but it's not really that impressive. I expected the flavors to be more bold. It drank smoothly and was pretty light in body. This beer wasn't anything too special but I'm glad I could try it."
"The beer appears a golden amber hue with a quarter inch of white head that leaves some decent lacing upon the glass. The aroma is of smoke and smoked malt. I don't think I could single out ham, per se, but I could get a sense of smoked meat in the nose. The flavor is decent and follows the aroma. I didn't enjoy this brew nearly as much as my favorite authentic rauchbiers, but it was good nonetheless. The body was a tad thin for my liking. A fun beer, I would have it again."
"D-very dinkable. I don't even need food! Job well done"
"Such an odd brew but really tasty. I'm shocked and amazed!"
"Pours a moderate red-amber color with a very thin off-white head that doesn't stick around too long before falling and not leaving too much behind. The nose brings some lightly-smoked malt along with a bit of roasted--you guessed it--ham. There is a bit of bready malt there as well. Taste doesn't quite bring home the bacon like I would have liked, though it certainly wasn't bad. The base malt seemed to take up too much of the flavor. Medium body with a slightly-smokey finish. A good brew, but the taste didn't live up to the nose."
"Drinkability -- Coming into this beer, I thought it would be an interesting novelty. However, this turned out to be my favorite rye beer to date. Lots of complexity coming from the grist with spicy rye, woodsmoke, and roast malt. Well balanced, but still keeps one at attention. If you ever have the chance to try this, don't hesitate or you will live to regret your poor decision."
"D- This was a couple and done beer. I enjoyed it a lot for the fact that it tasted like it was suppose too. Smoked beers I like but only a couple pints please."
"D: The strangeness grows on you as you drink it. One you should definitely try on."
"A must try beer at least once if you're ever visiting FFF."
"Pours a clear and visibly highly carbonated brown color with a thin and creamy tan head. The aroma is vague but gives off hints of sweet malty grain. The taste is also sweet and a touch of grain with a subtle background of smoke. The body is medium and very drinkable but the brew is slightly tart from beginning to end. The finish is slow and sees an slight increase in tartness and smokiness, and both of which linger after the end."
"D:Had another after my first glass and could have easily had more if not pressed for time."
"Figured it'd be a rye, since, well that's in the name. Didn't expect the smoke, even though I should have. My one complaint is that this isn't nearly smoky enough--it tastes a *little* meaty, but when you get a big, big rauch it actually tastes like a hickory farms sampler. I'd never thought I say this, but if Three Floyds had just been a little more bold then this beer would have been great."
"Mouth is a little light and thin yet good carbonation. Easy rinker."
"It was served in a pint glass. Appearance was a medium color of brown with a small head that faded away quickly. Smell was great. Taste was good!"
"It was served too cold for my liking (more of an establishment critique). The high amounts of smoked malt were a somewhat too harsh on my mouth but still pretty drinkable despite the smoke. I was very excited when I saw this on the tap list and am glad to say it was a very interesting and enjoyable beer. It's making me appreciate and seek out some more smoke beers since their flavor profiles are always a unique one."
"D: Good, but not earth shattering. I've been wanting to try this for a while, and I'm glad we were able to, but I'll probably pass on it next time I see it."
"Had this on tap, poured into pint glass. Amber body with with minimal light tan head. Smells smokey, like smoked cheese with some spicy mustard. Taste follows the nose. Smokey, bready malt and spice. This brew is aptly named. Medium body with moderate carbonation and a smoky finish. I had to try this for the name alone. I was pleasantly surprised. I could not drink a bunch of these, but would get one again and I think my appreciation would grow from increased exposure to this style."
"D - A solid beer w/ serious rye flavor. I am always looking for new rye ales to try and was very happy to try this one. A very drinkable beer - highly recommended"
"D: I debated having something else after my first glass but realized that it was too good and I must have more! A nicely smoked ale."
"D - Aptly named, Ham on Rye is an awesome smoked rye beer that virtually duplpicates eating (drinking?) a sandwich. FFF manages to push the envelope yet again with a beer that could have been simply a novelty, but turned out to be fantastic!"
"d: Not something I would reach for often, but I would like to come across this again."
"D-Well, I am not going to lie to you--I am a devotee of smoked beers and this one does not disappoint in any way! Mmm, mmm....The spicy aspect works really well and turns this rather mundane smoked amber into a work of art! Ham on Rye--true that! Well done FFF and Piece!"
"D- Overall this one lives up to its name, but I could not drink more then one of these due to its sweetness. A very unique beer that I am glad I got to try."
"Great dark amber color, one of the best smelling beers ever! It obviously smells very smoky, definitely like smoked meat. Great malt, leaves you feeling kinda thirsty. You definitely need a glass of water after this. Has a very thin head, leaves good lacing on the side of the glass. I would pay good money to see this on tap again at FFF. They really had to cut back on some excellent brews once the economy tanked. I feel their pain, but damn they need to brew this one again!"
"drinkability is great. as rauchbeers go, it is difficult to produce a brew that is this smokey and also provides a malt backbone that works well with the smoke. this accomplishes that to some degree, but it could be better. cheers!"
"This beer is one you have to talk about. You know, that beer you get your friends to try. You either love it or you hate. I LOVED it. Going to have to get a growler to take back to ""experiment"" with some beer buddies."
"Overall, simply delicious. This has now replaced Black Sun Stout as my favorite Three Floyds beer. Please, for the love of God, start bottling this. I'll figure out how to get it into PA after that."
"This is a Rauchbier, and meant to be intensely smoky. The authors of low reviews here don't seem to be aware that this is a legitimate beer style."
"D: They serve it in an imperial. Could easily be served in a 1/2 pint in which they serve most of their big beers. Uniquely enjoyable, but not one to be sessioned."
"No big deal, though, these guys have earned the right to experiment. Still the best brewery in the world, in my opinion."
"I HATE to give FFF a review like this but here goes. I did not like this brew. I only had a couple sips because I wouldnt have been able to drink anymore than that. Its seriously like a piece of salt ham. I'm sure thats what they were aiming for but its a very wierd taste! Unless you have food you cant drink it IMHO."
"Taste is a knockout rye with a good malt balance and I suppose some hops. This thing really tastes and smells like a ham sandwich. I'm impressed....but....how? I never wanted a ham sandwich so much in my life. Mild carbonation and very smooth. Feels a little thin and mild. Not sure about drinkability just due to the massive rye. One suited me just fine."
"This needs to be bottled and released as a seasonal beer. It's perfect for that weekend afternoon in the fall when you want to grill a big fat reuben sandwich for a football game."
"D - a beer that would be a perfect replacement for a kielbasa and sauerkraut meal as the smoky meat taste is so prevalent. On the whole I am not too sure as to how I feel about this beer. It is good and interesting and accomplishes its goal but after a while it started to get old and a bit too much for me. The greasy meat aftertaste started to wear on me and really had no desire to have another. On the whole, I would say this is a beer worth trying but not one that I would try again after having the experience once."
