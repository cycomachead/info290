"O: If you like smoky scotchy stouts, I definitely recommend this beer."

"Still, a great beer. Probably best with burnt ends brisket. Mmmm..."

"O: An interesting brew, but not really to my taste."

"Smoke is good."
"A decent smoked beer, a league or two more palatable than the last similar offering from this particular nation (I'm looking straight at you Nøgne Ø). The key seems to be the integration, because while it is indeed smoky, we're led to perceive this as a sub-attribute of whatever typical beer meme we're currently sussing out, rather than as an overarching component of the whole. As wanky as that was, it's true, and a straight-up compliment to the brewer."

"I'm pretty happy with this brewery and my ability to buy it in my home town, well worth trying and looking for if your a smoked malt fan"
"I enjoyed this offering although it isn't my favorite version of the style. The fruit flavors might benefit from some age in order for some of the slightly tart qualities to mellow, which may allow the sweetness to turn a bit richer."
"Bottle: Poured a clear dark brown color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of smoked malt with some caramel malt notes. Taste is good mix between some smoked malt with light smoked fish notes and some caramel malt. Body is about average with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Solid offering with great balanced taste of smoked malt and bacon and smoked fish."

"Medium body, with a long standing smokiness in the aftertaste, with touch of bitterness."
""
"A dark brown color with a khaki colored head. As the name implies, very, very smokey. A bit of salt and cured meat aroma to it, too. Some bread and toast, maybe a little bit of toffee. The flavor has a hint of vanilla which is nice, but the smoke and salt notes are almost overwhelming. A little bit nutty and some sweetness of toffee, bread, and toasted malts."
""
"Note: Batch #426"
"The beer pours a medium to dark brown color with a tan head. The aroma is very smokey. It reminds me of fresh smoked brisket, with a lot of meaty smoke notes and a little bit of roasted malt. The flavor has some great smoked chocolate notes, as well as some roasted malt. Medium to thick mouthfeel and medium carbonation."

"It's another interesting beer from Haand, but this one works a little less than some of their others. Again, they have some interestingly odd characters to it, but it's a little bit skewed towards anarchic here."
"Good carbonation, standard body and mouthfeel. Sort of a let-down for me, not a bad beer but not really worth 2x the price of Schlenkerla bottles."
""
"O: Goes down easy, tasty, not too filling, well hidden kick, decent representation of style. I'd seek out others of the style first, but a decent offering."

"O - quite a good beer; full of flavor without being tiring (though it is not entirely easy drinking!)"
"Decent though unexceptional smoked beer. Greyish tinged body with some retained off-white head. Average mouthfeel. Decent drinkability with lunch. Booze not too detectable. A tad of woodiness.Bottle from trade. Some chocolate malt and on the sweetish side."
"The beer poured a dark brown with a soft, white head that slowly dissolves. The aroma is of dark fruit with subtle smoke and slight chocolate. Strong estery taste with the dark fruit very pronounced up front followed by chocolate with the smoke lingering on the back end of the beer. This beer has less smoke than another of Haandbryggeriet's beers (Norwegian Wood) which did disappoint me. I would like the smoke to be more prevelant, but this was still a very nice, drinkable beer. I enjoyed it, but like Norwegian Wood better."
"My last bit o' smoked goodness for a bit (stupid lack of unlimited funds...), but some good stuff recently. This capstone pours a murky garnet-auburn topped by over a finger of dirty tan foam. The nose comprises charred wood, toffee, toasted biscuits, and a small amount of pine sap. The taste brings in more of the same, with the toffee and smoke intertwining nicely, behaving themselves the whole time. Some mandarin oranges somehow sneak their way into the proceedings. Oddly enough, the smoke really doesn't dominate as I expected... The body is a straight medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly oily, slightly dry feel (man, has my tongue been worked-over a bit here...). Overall, a very nice smoke-based brew, but one that could, somehow, stand to have a bit more smoke involved. Still, another nicely-crafted piece from the Haand boys."
"Another fine brew from Mr. Haand."
"This brew pours a dark murky kola hue with beautiful carbonation that leaves behind a creamy,frothy two finger head that stays and leaves heaps of lacing all over the shop,the smell is a combination of smokey bacon,roasted malts,chichory,light liquorice and a tinge of herbal hops,it has a medium bodied well carbonated mouthfeel which coats the mouth with smokey bacon,toasted marshmallows,chichory,beef jerky and finishes with a herbal hoppy bitterness and overall very nice and would drink again."
"Pours a very, very dark brown with a fizzy off-white head that dissipates into a thick, bubbly collar quick quickly with only a spot or two of lacing on the edges of the glass. The nose comes forward with some nice roasted malt and then there's just a touch of smoke in the background. The flavor has a bit more smoke and less of the roast. In addition, there's some cocoa and a bit of strong, bold coffee. Mouthfeel is medium with moderately-high carbonation. Slight fizz on the back-end. Finish is slightly dry and a bit smokey. Nicely done."
"M: The smoke is chewy, meaty and a stand-out. It coats the tastebuds with a rich flavor that isn't too heavy. The darker malts, yeast strain and smoke all work nicely together."
"Overall, this was an interesting take on the style. Pretty tasty and well balanced but I wish that it had more of a smoke component and wasn't so burnt tasting. Worth checking out if you're a smokehead but not something I would likely purchase again."
"Overall, a decent smoked beer, but just not very pronounced in any aspect."
"O: This is a pretty nice smoked beer, nothing ground breaking but a well done, not overly smokey beer. Doesn't have the liquid bacon/ham that others are known for, but has just enough to make you notice. Glad I got the chance to try it."
"Overall pretty solid all around. A good not so jaring smokey beer for people who might want to try one for the first time."
"A decent beer with lots of flavour. Really nice. The smopke is well balanced and there are some fine esters in there."
"The taste starts with a smokey caramel and coffee. Then the middle unloads more of the Bamberg smoked malts, but you also get some chocolate flavors as well. The finish is a slightly gritty and well carbonated palate with smokey rye bread crust, and maybe just a hint of bacon and wood. This is a great smoke beer. Probably on the top tier of smoked beers that I can enjoy and would buy again."
"Overall a solid rare import."
"D-Not as bold as I like in therms of the smoke, but a well put together beer."
"500ml bottle served in a Tank 7 tulip. Poured a deep brown with two fingers of tan head. Smokey aroma with a little sausage, dark malt, also a fair amount of citrus hops. Medium bodied. Plenty of smoke in the flavor along with hop bitterness. Smoke lingers in the finish. The smoke flavor became a little like liquid smoke as it warmed, which distracted. One of these is plenty."
"Excellent beer. The smoke is present in the taste and aroma, without being overpowering. There is a nice malty sweetness in the background. I get a load of peat and almost a hint of bacon. I am not big into smoked beers, but I love this one. I could drink a pint of this easily."
"D - A very impressive Smoked Porter, with a fantastic body that actually helps its drinkability. Don't expect to be beaten over the head with an overabundance of flavors, this beer does have the same understated beauty of other Haandbryggeriet brews I have enjoyed. Really good use of all the ingredients, fantastic balance, no flaws that I can detect. If you like smoke, pick this up."
"D: I would have like to have paired this with something barbecue-based. Very smooth, just very smoky."
"worth seeking out, a good job mixing 2 elements from 2 vastly different regions. definitely one of the more unique beers I have tasted that isn't a failed experiment."
"D: Lately I've been craving smoky/smoked beers and this fit the bill quite nicely. Earthy and smoky without being ""forced"". Rich and satisfying without being too filling. Excellent."
"Like the thinking here, just not there yet."
"Paired well with some smoked WI goat cheese, both found at Groppi Foods in Milwaukee."
"pours with a nice frothy head and smells deliciously smoky. if i could make an air freshener that smelled like this beer id be happy as a pig in shit, but unfortunately it may end there. i enjoy it and give props to its high quality, but i dot think i can drink a whole lot of it. i find it hard to give any low marks except for drinkability, and believe i would be wrong it i did. ive had many smoked beers that have way higher drinkability but just find myself hitting a wall with it. its worth trying for sure, but maybe recommend splitting with a friend, as i wish i had done."
"D: A well made, solid, drinkable beer."
"Drinkability was excellent. A very easy drinking smoked beer that is by no means overwhelming. A smoked beer fan myself, I found the transition of flavors refreshing and intriguing. Worth a try if available in your area."
