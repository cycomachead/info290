"O: This beer isn't too difficult to drink because the smoke is not overpowering, but novices might not be able to get past the Band Aid flavors."

"Overall this beer was different, but in a good way. I get over the fact that felt like I was drinking a Italian meat platter and enjoyed this beer very much."
"Overall: Great beer. I had some pulled pork app (roasted, not smoked, but still) and the beer went very well with it. On the whole, while this was clearly a rauchbier it had more flavor and balance than most that I've seen, which tend to hit you over the head with smokiness (fine by me as I like that flavor, but they're often very one-note). This was a great beer that could pair well with a ton of foods with the backgrounds notes but also was lighter and refreshing. I'd definitely try it again."

"O - What I loved was how such a light beer can pack so much smoke. I'm used to a smoked porter or rauchbier, but this was a new one to me. I'd certainly give it a shot when considering a smoky beer. Pair it with a sweet marinaded meat and have a awesome pairing."
