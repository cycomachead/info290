There are tons of better pumpkin beers out there.  If you need to get a pumpkin beer from Shipyard, go for the Pugsley Smashed Pumpkin instead.  Its a far superior beer!","Jeffreysan","Jan 26, 2015"

Sure, if you can get past the look and body and focus on taste and aroma only, this is a pretty decent beer. Due to the fact that I think this beer tastes damn good, I don't mind suffering through a (excuse my language) shit appearance and body. While I wouldn't recommend this beer because of its qualities as a whole, I do recommend it for its aroma and taste.","PorterPro125","Jan 03, 2015"

The other pie spices are more subdued, with a whisp of vanilla or graham cracker.  It starts sweet and smooth, but transitions to a higher carbonation and a watery body in short order.  The flavors are pretty much based in cinnamon, but theres a touch of pumpkin, hints of other spices, and a little bitterness to the gourd like flavor.  The aftertaste is super short, just a touch squashy, a hint of honey and cinnamon","TastyFoodAndDrink","Nov 26, 2014"

Shipyard smashed pumpkins is better but it costs so much more that I cannot say it is better.  All beer should be rated on a cost to ounce scale and that is how I come to saying you BRO's are so wrong on this one but so right on many other styles.   I want pumpkin pie in My pumpkin beers and I get this solidly in this and you guys can eat your Pumpking ratings  because you rate on cool factors and pumpking is a pumpkin beer with little spice and a high alcohol rating and price. Shipyard only follows O'Fallon Pumpkin in my book and  if you count the years I went pumpkin you can say I am rating on 60+  although I am new to this site.   Pumpking is pumpkin pulp ipa and lame on seasoning.   At least this beer has it and is a six pack for a 22 oz bottle of the smashed pumpkin which wins in my book over Pumpking.  Kings are dead and the prime ministers and presidents rule and I will go with this beer over it any day and O'Fallon is my pumpkin beer king if price matters.

However, I bought another 6 pack a few weeks ago (in spirit of the season) to find that it tasted much better. Not sure if they lowered the amount of spice or not but it came out nicely. Pours a golden color with a hazy colored head. Tastes of cinnamon and pumpkin with a splash of nutmeg. Combines really well with cider and other spiced liquors for when you're sitting around a fire!","Eando35","Oct 15, 2014"

3,0.7,,,,,,"Surprised this beer is ranked so low. It's not great but it's a good session beer and good for the season. It's a darker gold. The head is only around for a few seconds. The aroma I'm picking up on is mainly cinnamon. I'm liking the spices in this beer and the taste has a bit of cinnamon and you pick up on the pumpkin presence fairly easily as well. It is a little too watery which would be my main complaint about it, yet the spices, cinnamon and pumpkin to blend together nicely and while it's not a great pumpkin beer, it isn't half bad either. Definitely could have a few of these.","Ds0589","Oct 07, 2014"

Looks like a slightly dark bud light. Even though I see a good amount of carbonation, there is a little head and hardly any lacing. Aroma is extremely faint and I can hardly pick up any smell of spice or pumpkin. Even though is a good bit of carbonation and decent mouthfeel, this beer lacks any discernible flavor of pumpkin and spice. It is very faint and watered down. The mouthfeel is fizzy and refreshing, but this is not like any pumpkin ale I have ever had. Little disappointing considering the other brews I have had from Shipyard...","hophugger","Sep 25, 2014"

But it has cinnamon in spades.  If someone set out to make a cinnamon nutmeg beer, this would be it.  I found myself enjoying it more than expected. It is what it is.","HuskyHawk","Sep 07, 2014"

At first it's bad cider taste and then you're stuck with that strange awful aftertaste. I've managed to muscle through some pretty bad beers (cough*Alaskan Amber*cough), but this is truly terrible beer. Bad enough that after tasting one the remaining 5 were discarded. To finish, selling this at the price point of great brands like Founders, are you serious Shipyard?!?","Jbasstic","Sep 07, 2014"

It's approachable and easy on the palate, but also lacks the depth and flavor I'd like from a fall seasonal (pumpkins or not). Maybe I enjoyed this less than I would have under more ideal conditions, since I had it on a baking-hot, humid September day. Still, Shipyard undeniably has better executed offerings than this.","illpass78","Sep 01, 2014"

The appearance is a thin orange with a little head. The smell is sweet with hints of clove and sweet pumpkin spices like nutmeg. The taste is very sweet for a pumpkin with a lot of sugar in the beginning and middle. As far as the pumpkin itself it is a little thin and what is there is a tad synthetic, but still tasty. Overall, not bad.","WhiteHillsStore","Aug 21, 2014"

4.03,35.2,3.5,3,4.75,3,4.5,"Although this one lacks in character is really is my favorite fall beer. Its things like drinkability and personal preference that can go easily unnoticed. While this could certainly use some work, the pumpkin/nutmeg flavor really does come through in excellent fashion. If you drink it from the Keg (preferrably right from the source in Portland) you will notice the flavor (while light and airy on the toungue) really packs a deep punch in the body of this beer. My favorite beers tend to be stouts, my favorite so far being the Breakfast Beer from Founders Brew, and the Dogfish Head Miles Davis Bitches Brew. So that being said I can understand why people who are used to loving a deep flavor, lacing, and body would most likely hate this sweet bubbly ale. I would advise you to give it an honest try. This stuff is an all day ale thats perfect for pairing with fall food/deserts. It is certainly a friendly beer both for your mouth and wallet. If you guys don't decide to drink it then thats fine....just means more cases for me.","Chilly444","Jan 31, 2014"

I'm not sure if there is any natural pumpkin component to this beer, but I quickly remembered why I didn't like it the last time. Tastes basically like pumpkin soda.

Light in body, this ale was very thin, watery, not much of a grain base- there was some spice, perhaps a touch of cinnamon and nutmeg.

The body is clear and translucent, but is marked by numerous fierce streams of carbonation bubbles. On the nose, the beer smells sweet and spicy with a warming (but not overwhelming) touch of cinnamon and nutmeg, alongside a fruitier malt character, with light hints of biscuit. On the tongue, the beer tastes light and warmly spicy with a light hit of watery flavoring. The beer begins with fiercer spices and transitions into softer and warmer spicy notes with a blossoming of biscuity notes and watery finish that still rings with sweet cinnamon and nutmeg. On the mouth, the beer feels smooth but thin, sitting very watery in the mouth, though it does have some heavier notes to it. The mouth is left clean with a light spice tingle, and some torrents of spittle sitting on the sides of the mouth and calling for more. Overall, this is the classic pumpkin beer, whether you like it or not. It is easily accessed and available nearly everywhere and it is really not offensive to the palate. I feel like a lot of people like to hate on Pumpkinhead because of its mass-production ways, but let’s be honest, it is not bad. Is it the best pumpkin beer? No. Is it a little watery? Yes, but that helps with the drinkability. This is a decent beer that is readily available, and a nice introduction to pumpkin beers.","Maxwell","Dec 30, 2012"

The taste follows the nose in that it is quite sweet with hints of spices like cinnamon and nutmeg with a hint of malt. It is my favorite pumpkin ale out of all that I have tried because it is light and sweet and reminds me of a slice of pumpkin pie.

Flavor follows with light lager, but I like that I finally found a pumpkin beer that highlights pumpkin rather than overpowering nutmeg. Sorry people, nutmeg in beer is disgusting. This is underrated. While the base beer is only okay at best, I really enjoyed having a sixer over 18 holes on a nice late fall afternoon. The pumpkin flavor is present, but not overpowering.

The cinnamon lingers uncomplemented after all else has subsided, leaving a cheap, watery """Red Hot""" taste on the palate.

Then on an excursion with the wife to Rhode Island I tried the Pumpkinhead on draft at a restaurant near our hotel. It was served in a goblet with the rim dipped in cinnamon sugar. It was superb when served this way. The waitress told me this was the """brewery recommended serving method""". Wow, I thought I have to try this at home. Well I did and found it was like a different beer. Ever since I have tried this serving technique with other substandard pumpkin ales, but alas, it only works for Shipyard Pumpkinhead Ale. Apparently this beer must be brewed with the expectation that local New Englanders will dip their glass in cinnamon sugar before serving. Yes, it is a good pumpkin ale, just weak by comparison to most other craft pumpkin ales. It just needs a little kick from the cinnamon sugar.","wattoclone","Sep 11, 2012"

This beer had ok drinkability, it went down fairly smooth and was crisp, but the flavors couldn't hold my attention for one second and the mouthfeel was too light and highly carbonated so one is more then enough for me, there's no way I would want another one. What I liked most about this beer was that I learned my lesson and won't confuse this with their Smashed Pumpkin ever again. What I liked least about this beer was just about everything, but the taste and mouthfeel stand out as being the worst. I wouldn't buy this beer again, it's cheap, but it's still not worth the price, I wouldn't recommend this beer to anyone I liked, it's just not worth it. All in all I was not a fan of this beer, this was my first experience with Shipyard and it did not make for a good impression, I still want to try their Smashed Pumpkin, but it will have to be pretty good to make me want to revisit this brewery any time soon.

Finishes a bit medicinal and watery, a dull spiced ale that doesn't let beer shine in it's original format of malted barley, hops, yeast, and H20. Not a purist but this beer doesn't inspire me to think wow these guys have gone somewhere where every other fall seasonal has already attempted and perfected to go.

Watery with a little too much spice and not enough malts.","CuriousMonk","Feb 10, 2011"

The flavors however were very washed out, lemon dominated the palate with little hops or malt discernable. The spices were there but weak and no pumpkin flavors could be found.

Slightly tangy, as per the pumpkin in the mash, with no real off flavors and apart from an earthy 'gourdiness' to the aromatic aspect, nothing objectionable at all. Pumpkinhead is a readily drinkable rendition of this seasonal brew, and I recall it being the most easy-drinking Pumpkin brew available when I lived in Boston (the others being from Concorde and Post Road). Now that it's available a little bit further afield its drinkability holds up, but there are others which seem a bit tastier also - what a difference ten years makes, eh? But put in a blind, side-by-side taste test with the well-known Buffalo Bill's offering and a casual drinker might easily mistake one for the other, yet as a pumpkin pie fan myself I think there's a bit more o' the gourd in this one.

The retention and lacing are average. The nose is bright with pumpkin and soft cinnamon spice. In the mouth it's medium bodied and smooth with a moderate carbonation that gently bristles. The flavor offers just as much in delicate, grainy malt and yeasty fruitiness and butter as it does in pumpkin and spice.

Not much depth aromawise. Mildly toasty dextrin and light caramel malt is the malt foundation for judicious spicing. Agreeable, parching sharpness lended by cinnamon. Slightly citric, lemony notes emerge as the beer breathes and lend a spiced lemon bread impression. Mild, non descript hop bitterness offsets malt sweetness adequately, lending a brisk dryness that suits the well controlled pie spices. (nutmeg, cinnamon...etc) Well attenuated and thin, with a prosaic American wheat -esque watery mouthfeel. Finishes mildly toasty, but otherwise abruptly and very dry. A rather tame and uninspired pumpkin brew. """Pumpkin""" ales need a sturdy malt backbone, and this lanky brew doesn't have one. Passably drinkable, but forgettable.","marc77","Dec 26, 2003"

The aroma is faintly of pumpkin and nutmeg with whiff of bread dough. The body is thin and watery, lightly sweet and a bit doughy. The hops are mildly applied and offer a light lime-like sourness. The flavor of pumpkins is only vaguely a subliminal suggestion. You may think that you're tasting actual pumpkin, but really it's more the spices and mild aroma playing tricks on your senses.

Big on cinamon. Not a lot else on the nose. Maybe some slight cereal grains. The taste is more of the same. Spicing is good for this style, but there isn't a lot of substance beneath it. This could really use some juicy pumpkin pulp. (Do they even use pumpkin in this recipe?) The taste is cinamon, ginger and grain. A little clove seeps in too. Body is about medium at best.

Malt works reasonably well with the pie spice, starts silky with some sweetened condensed milk properties. Not a bad mouthfeel, but the start is best, as this Ale turns watery, lacks any hop balance or even a more peppery spice quality (like in Ale Mary).
