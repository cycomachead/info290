"All aspects of expected tastes were present..Loved it"
"Black with see thru ruby pour; tight tan head. Spicy nutmeg and cinnamon nose with waft of """whiskey""". Caramel start and bourbon finish (subdued IMO); alcohol on the exhale!  Medium mouthfeel with bourbon tongue coating. This was great-I didn't feel like I was drinking a """pumpkin""" ale.  Wish I had bot more..."

"Overall: This definitely has a kick.  For many, this would be the one beer for the entire night.  I would do this to cap the night.  A very nice and complex pumpkin ale."
""
""
""
""
"O-Lower the abv and this beer would be fantastic."
""
""
"O - very nice. This is the second of Avery's barrel series I've had and, while this is no Tweak, it's still very solid."
""

"Smells much hotter than it tastes. Impressive balance between pumpkin,roasted malt, Autumn spices and bourbon flavors. Not overpowering despite its 17.22% ABV. World class. I am impressed."
""
"Black with a tan head, aromas of whiskey, brownie batter, and vanilla.  Flavors of roasted malt, more brownie batter, alcohol and vague spices.  A thick, syrupy body with lots of alcohol burn, the nose is complex but it doesn't come together as well as it should.  Seems like it needs age, but could be really nice with enough time."

"Overall:  This beer rocks! definitely a sipper, but after taking your first sip you want the experience to last as long as possible.  This and Good Gourd by Cigar City are the 2 best beers I have ever had that prominently incorporate pumpkin into the style.  They are totally different styles so I don't want to compare apples with oranges, but if you enjoy pumpkin beer styles, don't hesitate to pick this up"

"Picked this up in a great trade with Jonathan!  Dark brown, nearly black pour with a nice two finger beige head with nice retention and great lacing.  The nose is amazing with huge bourbon and dark fruit notes along with hints of dark chocolate, raisins, molasses, cocoa, vanilla, and oak.  The taste is extremely bold with huge bourbon barrel notes front and center.  Tons of dark fruits, especially raisins, along with hints of molasses, dark chocolate, oak, vanilla, toffee, maple, and subtle, earthy pumpkin.  Surprisingly, the pumpkin pie spices are not overpowered by the booze. The cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, and allspice really emerge as it comes to temp.  The mouthfeel is thick and syrupy and extremely rich with an awesome warming finish.  With that said, considering the 17.22% ABV, it's way more drinkable than expected.  Sure, it's definitely a sipper, but no wheres near as hot and harsh as some reviewers made it out to be.  Overall, this was a complex, bold, and flavorful beer.  Highly recommended!"

"This is an awesome beer"
"O: I am really glad that I got to give this a whirl, and while it lacks in subtle grace like other BBA beers I love, this is a fun twist on pumpkin/spiced beers. Other breweries need to take note."

"this is a great beer"

"The beer is a bit boozy, but a great attempt at a huge huge bourbon barrel pumpkin stout."
""
""
""
"My first thought was 'points for originality', but the boozy, syrupy palate-overload seems to balance out over progressive sips.  Definitely a one of kind brew."
"A little more porter chocolate here, but man oh man you will not miss the fact that this is north of 17% ABV. Alcohol hot hot heat dominate though, even sipping it slowly. getting past that though, there is the aforementioned chocolate and hints of coffee, but that same blend of vanilla from the barrel bleeding into the vanilla of the porter and the creamy sweet of pumpkin meat.  Round and smoothe once you get past the overwhelming alcohol. I like most of the underlying flavours. I suppose I would consider laying it down for a couple of years, but I would worry that the underlying pumpkin from which much of the pleasure derives might dissipate. As it is it's still far too hot to truly enjoy/appreciate now. Lots of tasty complex flavours, just so overshadowed by the boozahol..."

"D: This was a beast of a brew, with bold and complex scent and taste, and huge body. All the flavors really worked well together, but the finish was super hot, so it must be sipped. I would love to try this after 5 years or more in the cellar. Fresh, it's delicious but brutal."

"Murky brown colored with no penetration to light.  A faint wisp of khaki colored head is present only around the rim.  I smell plenty of cinnamon,nutmeg, clove ,and pumpkin pie spice.  The taste is a melange of bourbon,nutmrleg,clove,and pumpkin pie spice.  The mouth is thick,sticky,and chewy."
""
""
""
"You can really taste the booze in this"
"A Bourbon Barrel Aged Imperial Porter at a whopping 17% ABV. So strong that Texas retailers required a liquor license to sell it. The nose is all bourbon & allspice & pours a deep dark brown. While the beer is boozy, it is well hidden by the creamy malts, cinnamon, cloves & vanilla. This is a pumpkin brew on steroids. With the temps dropping, you'll need something tasty like this to keep you warm."
""
""
"Unbelievable! Dessert beer, crazy all spice flavor"
""
""
""
"Starts out like hearty  fresh baked pumpkin bread, not that saccharin style we get from most beers. Don't get too much of the bourbon but it does finish with a very nice imperial Porter."
"Not as heavy as expected for a huge ass beer. More of a medium body."
""
""
"It's smooth, syrupy, sticky, spicy, and yes very sweet (at times cloyingly so), but the warm spice notes and bourbon keep it somewhat balanced and earthy (especially after it sits awhile) for such a sweetly gargantuan brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark brown with some dark cascading head. Aroma & flavor are heady, bourbon mixed with spices. Pumpkin ale holds it's own very well and like the melding with bourbon barrels. One to retry for sure."
""
""
""
"Overall: A really huge and thick brew that comes out pretty good. Huge flavors of pumpkin, spice, and bourbon. A very slow sipper that is not for the faint of heart."

" The taste is excellent as the malt is the first thing you taste yet light caramel taste with some dark brown sugar elements and caramelization from barrel in the initial taste too. The flavor of bourbon is present with some light cinnamon and dry clove-like pumpkin spice qualities perhaps some nutmeg and a mild cocoa quality blending well with subtle woody taste mid palate. The finish has a slight alcohol flavor but mild for the strength of the beer with bourbon and vanilla coming in with a slight dessert-like richness. I am truly impressed by the wonderful barrel-aged quality of this pumpkin porter -nicely spiced without going overboard and asssertive with a serious amount of bourbon yet smooth overall and just incredible considering the components working together in this huge pumpkin ale."

"Wow! This thing is a madman. At $12/bottle, it better be! Boozy up front. Very dark and rich. No carbonation. Like a wonderful bourbon syrup! Reminds me a lot of Bourbon county stout. Don't really get much spice out of it so it's even better."

"I have to admit, I was more than a wee bit trepidatious before opening this monster of a beer, but once I became resolute, it really isn't all that scary - due in no small part to the deft hand(s) who crafted this.  It really is quite porter-like, if you discount the initially heady pumpkin, the spice, and the Bourbon character - I know that sounds fairly spurious, given how big and varied this offering is, but overall, what we have here is a tasty, full, and incredibly warming pumpkin ale."
"Great beer but i am missing something it like balance.....Nice notes of the Bourbon Barrel. Good porter."

"O So sweet and delicious, quite complexed, a fantastic job"
""
"Overall - I don't know about this.  It's unpleasant."
""
""
""
"Dark brown cola looking body. Not very much carbonation at all. Smell is huge bourbon fall spices. Thick sticky mouthfeel. Lots of delicious bourbon with a ton of pumpkin spice. Lots of cinnamon and nutmeg. Good alcohol burn. Delicious. Hard to get through a whole bottle though."
""
""
""
""
""
"cloudy dark brown in appearance thin khaki head. aromas have strong tones of molasses and vanilla along with pretty apparent booziness and some spices. wow! the flavors are exactly what it smells of and even more, nice complexity not too much but still pretty rich. delish! the bourbon flavors are a minimal but the booziness is very strong in the mid palate. great beer I wish it was half the price or twice the size I'd gladly buy more!"
""
""
""
"The beer pours a clear dark brown topped by a tan head hit hard by that male pattern baldness - thins out before you can get a good whiff in. Penetrating alcohol and nutmeg/cinnamon in the nose, it could use some of that propylene glycol going down though, realtalk. It has a harsh spice presence, big booze and little of the stout left by the end. I'd say it's incrementally more intolerable as it warms. This beer is not a favorite, really more of a miss than a hit by Avery."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"As some others have mentioned, this is very boozy and doesn't have a ton of pumpkin flavor. That said I think it's fantastic for the sweet and bourbon flavor."
""
""
""
"Dark brown. Sticky mouthfeel. Flavor profile is dominated by sweet notes and bourbon.  Actually, there is no discernible pumpkin beyond faint notes in the nose."
""
""
""
""
"This is medium to full bodied. It boasts modest carbonation and overall is not bad. The barrel and residual sugar dominate this with the alcohol being masked very well. Also, the spice additions are faint."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Smelling pumpkin spice, vanilla and pumpkin(vegetable). Not getting any bourbon. Lots of dark fruits(raisin, prune, dark cherry), chocolate, burnt caramel. Getting a weird sweetness, almost medicinal. Huge alcohol heat warming my chest. Getting better as it really warms up."
""
"O: A fun pumpkin ale from Avery. Barrel presence is minimal but does provide some complexity. Pumpkin and spices are crazy sharp. Big, heavy beer but alcohol is not over the top surprisingly. Feels like a big 13-14%er, tops. Tasty but hard to drink a whole lot of it. A sipper, for sure."

"Not sure if it was the bottle I got or not, but the bourbon was extremely overpowering. Good for a random sip, but hard to finish the bottle. Maybe I'm just not a heavy bourbon person, or am less so than I thought I might be. Hard to taste anything but the bourbon. Probably heaven for beer drinkers who like bourbon. Lots and lots of bourbon."
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
"O:  I've never been a fan of pumpkin beers, but this one may have changed my mind.  Perhaps it's the absence of actual pumpkin flavor, I don't know. A big beer for sure at over 17%, but drinks rather well. Very tasty and complex. The $12 price tag is high, but there are no regrets here."
""
""
""
""
"In truly decadent fashion this massive beer doesn't draw out enough of the barrel and bourbon as Rumpkin drew out the rum. Instead it turns to a more complex array of flavors without highlighting much of the pumpkin. Molasses sweetness comes on hard at first with a touch of syrupy sorghum. I taste dark fruits like prunes but get a little fig. The middle is a bit malty with some sweet chocolate. It ends a bit spicy with nutmeg clove and even some cinnamon. All the while this is immensely boozy."

"T-this was the best porter/pumkin brew ive ever had its a sipper of deliciousness its very high ABV is so well masked it was pricey but so glad i bought one superb brew"
""
""
""
"A truly massive beer - a bit too big for its own good, even. Nose is nothing but deep, syrupy scents of baked figs, molasses, and spiced rum, bearing no resemblance to a porter whatsoever (I'm thinking Belgian quad or BSDA). Initial tastes follow suit but carry a slow whiskey burn on top of the residual sugars. Get past that, though, and the beer opens up with notes of coconut, almond, and the toasted, dark-chocolate grain taste of an imperial porter, along with just the slightest notes of ginger and pumpkin purée. Overall, this one is enjoyable (for being such a big beer), but I'd give it at least another 6 months in the bottle to mellow out. Personally, I think a year would be perfect. Cheers!"

"Pours dark dark brown with a more white than brown one finger head. Wow, the nose is robust,  the booze and the nutmeg are the first flavors present followed closely by vanilla and pumpkin. The flavor is intense. It follows the nose pretty closely. There's heat from the alcohol,  but it's flavor is pretty well hidden. Much better than any other pumpkin beer I've had."
""
"Overall. This is a monster, no question of that. Well executed but not really my thing. So sweet, a little much on the spice (but I'll always say that of a pumpkin beer unless its just barely detectable), and too boozy. The bourbon isn't over the top and I will say that really helped this one. I'll revisit the other bottle I picked up in a couple years."

"By far the best Pumpkin beer I've had. Others cannot come close. Even though not much pumpkin flavor. More cinnamon and slight nutmeg. Sweet flavors blend well with the higher ABV. Definatley a dessert beer. For all you pussies saying this beer is hot grow some sack. Not hot by any means. Given the chance I would buy up any bottles available. This beer makes other pumkin beers taste like shit."
"Poured into a Fremont small snifter.  Pours a very dark mahogany brown, appearing black in the glass with a thin, light brown head that dissipates quickly to patches, slight lacing. Rich aroma of bourbon with light pumpkin pie and toasted malt, kind of like a pumpkin pie swimming in bourbon. Flavor follows with quite realistic pumpkin pie melded with semi-sweet dark toasted malt and lost of bourbon. Medium to heavy bodied with light creaminess, mild carbonation. This really tastes like taking a bite of a good, not oversweet pumpkin pie and chasing it with a small taste of bourbon and a swig of sweet stout. Very nice. Not much fresh pumpkin, but the pie is nailed. Dessert in a glass. The bourbon is assertive, but this really hangs together perfectly with no component out of place. Ultra ABV well covered. Delicious and deadly."

"This might be the first Avery beer I have bought since they have come into Wisconsin. The high abv, the barrel aging and the seasonal pumpkin taste all tempted me into buying this beer. It turned out to be fantastic. The barrel aging taste and the pumpkin pie spices blended together nicely into a smooth, sweet, alcoholic treat. Being this high of abv, the beer was quite a bit to handle and has to be something you sip on over time. I wouldn't want too many of these but will definitely make it part of my fall rotation."
""
""
"Solid black color with a fizzy head on top that disappears pretty fast.  The smell is awesome.  Bourbon, cinnamon, clove, nutmeg.  The flavor is intense.  Big boozy bourbon up front followed by pumpkin pie spices and pumpkin with a sweet malt base.  The bourbon is complimented beautifully with pumpkin pie flavors.  Not as heavy as one would think.  Very smooth and a beer that needs to be sipped, but oh so fun to drink.  The price tag of $14 for a 12 oz. bottle is very steep, but I was happy to try this uniquely crafted brew once."
""
""
"A huge, huge beer in many ways. What's most amazing to me as that the high ABV is kept quite manageable, taste-wise, while allowing the huge, dark malt flavors to coat the palate with dense, flavorful residual sugars and the bourbon barrel aging to grace the taste buds with its twist on things. The sweet, brown porter character is there, the pumpkin ale styling can't be missed, and the bourbon barrel aging is also front-and-center. A masterful job of combing these distinctive flavor profiles into one approachable and gigantic beer."
""
""
"Nice and strong, and if you like the bourbon in you BBA beers, you will probably like this.  Little too strong tasting for me; get almost none of the barrel, and an alcohol-based thin feel.  For the price, no need to try again (except to cellar??).  After the bottle, which didn't seem that different than my prior review, definitely the only way I would purchase again would be to cellar it to see if the alcohol burn mellows."

"My first 17.22% beer. Man was it strong! I'm not a fan of beers aged in Bourbon Barrels so it was no surprise to me i wasn't going to like this Porter. It's Halloween season so i had to give it a try. Flavor is there but the after taste is too much for my taste."

"O: an outstanding pumpkin porter, elegantly barrel-aged and incredibly crafted. Don't take a pass unless you're not a fan of the style."
""
"Serving type: bottle."
"Overall I quite enjoyed it, but not as a pumpkin ale and more as a bourbon barrel-aged porter. Definitely prefer this over Rumpkin (not fond of rum). Not sure if its worth the price for me. If I happen to have another bottle, I would let it sit for at least a year and half."
""
"Over the top abv and barrel for my liking."
"Bottom Line: Nice try Avery"
""
""
""
""
"Aroma, alone, deserves a 5. Smells like a pumpkin pie right after it comes out of the oven. Flavor is similar, with the warming effect of bourbon, and a toasted finish. Exceptional."
"A great beer. Best pumpkin beer I have had."
"Pours a cola color with tan head and decent retention.  The nose is intense.  Heavy spice and barrel notes up front with a considerable amount of booziness.  Cinnamon is the strongest of the spices with some nutmeg and allspice in the back.  The bourbon barrel brings heavy vanilla and char.  The spice and barrel are more prominent than the porter base.  Hints of chocolate are present but are basically buried.  The taste is a cinnamon bomb with heavy sweetness.  Notes of caramelized pumpkin, brown sugar, vanilla, and barrel char all come through.  The alcohol brings some warmth to the finish.  While this is sweet, the sweetness is relatively in check considering the high abv.  Overall, a pretty intriguing brew.  The spice profile doesn't scream pumpkin as it leans so heavily to the cinnamon side of things.  I wish there was more porter character here, perhaps some chocolate or roast."
""
""
""
"Bottle. Wow chocolate and bourbon to the nose. Loads of booze upfront, then it gets the hints of cinnamon,  nutmeg and very slight clove. The pumpkin roundness really comes in to cut the spices before they get too harsh"
""
""
""
""
"t/m/o - taste follows suit leading with a big boozy decadent chocolatey bourbon which is quickly slammed into perspective with a nice dose of cinnamon and pumpkin spice.  My mouth is left tingling from the heat but this is fairly drinkable for such a big brew.  Avery is one if the few who can pull off these uber big beers.  The porter flavors are extremely muted under the heat and pumpkin but the char and roast of the porter can be found beneath.  Another great brew from Avery.  I find that although a close rival to rumpkin, that beer stands in a league of its own as the greatest pumpkin brew of all time."
"Way to sweet"
""
"Nice beer, but I'm looking forward to seeing how the other bottle I was able to obtain mellows out with time. Very alcohol forward, as it should be at 17.22% ABV."
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL:  Really great effort from Avery, as always for their barrel aged beers.  Great beer that I cannot wait to taste after aging it, but Rumpkin still takes the cake for me."
""
""
""
""
""
"(and no pumpkin hints at all)"
""
"This pours a brown color with a slight, light brown head. The aroma is bold with big bourbon flavors and malts. The flavors are complex and bold. A nice boozy flavor that warms you up. Actually the amount booze I think actually takes away from the flavor of the beer. You can certainly call this brew a “slow sipping beer.”"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Chestnut body with a light beige head. Aromas of rum, oak, Fall spices, cinnamon. Boozy, spicy, squash. The aroma displays a gargantuan alcohol presence, but the finish is astoundingly gentle, given the 17.22% abv. Subtle chocolate notes. Medium bodied with low carbonation and sticky on the palate. Quite tasty."

"D:  The flavor profile and nose of this beer are delectable. Satisfies the BBA craving more than the pumpkin flavor. It takes a while to drink 12oz of this solo, which is fine because it really opens as it warms. For the super high ABV, this beer is drinkable, though it still drinks like a 10%+ ABV beer. It manages to be super sweet but not cloying.   Does it need age to mellow out?  I don't think so, but it could only get better over time.  Price point is very high at 13.99 per 12oz, so I'll buy maybe one or two to age."
""
""
""
""
"Spice cake. Intense booze. Not much pumpkin."
"Pump(ky)n has a youthful harshness to it that will certainly mellow with time. Next year, this will be a different beer entirely."
""
""
"Looks great, a nice tidy white head, not quite opaque. The color of a pecan pie. Smells like a glass of liqueur - not bourbon, exactly, but something sweeter and more outre. The pumpkin spice flavor comes through in a big way, but it was welcome. On the first couple of sips, I couldn't taste the bourbon because it was so hot, but after it warmed in the glass for a few minutes, there was an exquisite velvety bourbon flavor that hit hard at the beginning, and slowly gave way to the imperial porter's maltiness. I'd definitely drink this again if someone else would foot the bill. (I assume these bottles are cheaper for CO locals to buy, but my single 12 oz. bottle cost me $12.99.)"

"Overall, this was a powerful and luxurious libation to enjoy. It sips like hard alcohol, so be prepared and be careful. Those who are familiar with any of Avery's other offerings should be well aware of this, and should also find this to be a worthy entry into their catalog for tasting."
""

""
""
""
""

"12oz bottle $12.99. Dark black, minimal head. Smells nice, booze, pumpkin, cinnamon, sugar, vanilla, bourbon. Taste is much the same. A really nice blend of spices, porter, and bourbon barrel characteristics. Good stuff."

"Very strong beer. Lots of flavor/bourbon. Not best pumpkin I've had (Good gourd from cigar city), but worth trying. Nice beer for sharing."
""
""
""
"this is obviously something special, all of the big avery stuff is, but this one is real unique as strong beers and pumpkin beers each go. porter is a cool base for this, the darker grain brings a lot to the table in terms of flavor depth, and does a good job balancing the pumpkin flavors. the beer is a muddy brown color with no head at all. its about as thick and syrupy and one would reasonably suspect, but the texture in the mouth is more slippery than sticky, and as diabetic as this beer is on a sugar scale, it doesnt feel teeth rotting in the end. pumpkin flavors are secondary to the bourbon, which is anything but subtle. sweet vanilla and oak and indeed some booze are tasted even above the dark malts. its not as complex as some others in the big barrel series, but i think its integrated all the elements really well. my issue here is than i can have about 4 ounces of this and i need to move on. its too sweet and strong for much drinking, and i think a more robust yeast strain would have taken this thing well over 20% abv, given the remaining residual sugars. overall a must try, all of these are, but maybe one i wouldnt buy again by virtue of its absurdity."

"This is an unbelievably boozy beer. I love Avery's barrel program, but this one wasn't quite up to par. It's hot and sweet, and the spices are present but get lost in the background do to the booziness. I will let this beer age for quite a while before trying my second bottle. All this being said, I will be first in line to buy their next barrel release!"
