"I was fairly happy with this beer. I didn't really know what to expect. I just picked up randomly as part of a build-your-own 6-pack. But overall this seems like a decent beer."
""
""
"Russet brown and red tinge, dissipated tan head. Tar, allspice, cinnamon, clove, baked molasses. Yams upfront with cola backend. Not bad"
""
"When I had this particular beer, I was somewhat disappointed in the fact that it differed from the standard pumpkin ale into more of a standard above-average proof sort of lager"

"Overall - Decent pumpkin porter. Wish the flavors were more assertive and the body thicker and with just a bit more bite, but it's not terrible by any means; it just seems to miss the mark by a hair."

"A Porter great for the fall season. It has a great aroma, a lighter body for a porter, but it is a porter that everyone could enjoy 2 or 3 of. The pumpkin is more in the aroma than the flavor."

"great smell, but tastes like a porter, not much pumpkin taste"

"O - I think porters and stouts are a great starting point for pumpkin beers.  This is a good porter and I enjoyed it very much.  Just wish the pumpkin flavor was a little stronger."

"Lots of pumpkin, cinnamon, ginger and allspice in the aroma, along with roasted malt, cocoa and coffee like you would expect with a porter.  Very dark brown, murky, decent light brown head with tiny bubbles.  Sips leave a good amount of lace on the sides.  Nearly opaque dark brown with hints of ruby, one-finger dense tan head and modest lace. Bitter at the start, with a sweet, caramelly finish.  I find the sweet almost too much.  Hint of sour from the pumpkin. Medium body, not as thick as I would expect, slight carbonation, long finish.  Overall, I liked it but if I made one change it would be to tone down the sweetness a little.  I think it was a bit less sweet last year."

"If you like pumpkins and porter this is the beer for you."
"This brews not bad at all and in fact becomes a load more enjoyable as it warms and reveals more flavors. It's good and the type of beer one could drink many of."

"Drinkable, but it's not the best porter I have had, nor is it the best pumpkin ale."

"This is a very nice pumpkin porter! The spices are present but blend in well with a solid porter. Alcohol is exceptionally well-hidden.  Nicely done!"
""

""

"A delicious pumpkin porter!  Lighter body and less syrup than most porters I've had.  Spices are present, but not overwhelming.  Would drink again."

"First, WOW what a great brew. I picked up two from kroger. I knew that Alaskan Had some good stuff like the Black IPA. I was expecting it to be as good but it was even better. I wont review the ASTMO because THe Adjuct Hippie  covered it well. Do yourself a favor and pick up a case."

"Update after drinking it again : Next to Lucky Bucket's Oktoberfest, this beer is 2nd to my favorite during fall season now. WHAT a beer!"

"Overall: A satisfying and mostly balanced pumpkin ale."

"Dumped this into a goblet and it pours pretty viscous, very dark brown with red-tinged edges. Head doesn't last very long. Aroma is leathery and herbal, heavy molasses and spice. Flavor brings some additional smoky notes, and the website it says they use malt smoked with alder wood to achieve that. Also spice, dominantly cinnamon, but I can't say I notice any actual pumpkin. Mouthfeel is syrupy and thick, and almost too sweet, especially if you let it warm too much. I would've liked less sweetness and obviously more pumpkin for a pumpkin ale, however I actually think it tastes good, really bold flavors, just no pumpkin. And is it even a porter? Honestly think it's closer to some abbey ales I've had than to a porter. Good stuff for a non-pumpkin abbey ale pumpkin porter."

"All in in all I thought this was a nice beer and I thought it was an above average example of the style, I thought the porter base worked well with the pumpkin pie flavors and I thought the smokey aspect worked well with it.  This beer had ok drinkability, it was smooth, crisp, a little prickly, not filling and the taste did a nice job at holding my attention, but i think one would be my limit, since I think the mouthfeel would start to wear on me after having more than one.  What I liked the most about this beer was the balance, it was just were it needed to be and no aspect was too overpowering.  What I like the least about this beer was the mouthfeel, it was this beers weakest point and it needs some work.  I would buy this beer again and I would recommend it to any pumpkin beer fans.  All in all I enjoyed this beer, but I thought the mouthfeel just made it a little rough around the edges, but other than that it was a nice beer.  This is now my favorite beer from this brewery and I think it's up there as a nice Pumpkin Ale.  Good job guys, this was a nice beer, keep up the solid work."
"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, best before 1/14/2015. Pours crystal clear nearly opaque dark brown color with a 1 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of chocolate, cocoa, light coffee, caramel, toast, brown sugar, pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, and herbal/spice earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with balanced dark/roasted malt, pumpkin, and spice notes; with solid strength. Taste of chocolate, cocoa, light coffee, toast, caramel, brown sugar, biscuit, pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, and herbal/spice earthiness. Light earthy spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, cocoa, light coffee, caramel, toast, brown sugar, pumpkin, cinnamon, allspice, and herbal earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice complexity and solid robustness of dark/roasted malt, pumpkin, and spice flavors; with a great malt/spice balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied; with a smooth and fairly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice pumpkin porter. Good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt, pumpkin, and spice flavors; and very smooth to drink. I felt like the malt flavors should have been a bit more robust at 7%, but it was nicely enjoyable otherwise."

"Pours out black with a khaki head.  Smells strongly of roasted malts with hints of spice.  Something about the mix of the porter with the spices gives me a whiff of anise.  Flavor leans more toward the porter base, with relatively little spicing.  I get a huge house yeast taste that I don't care for: like a mix of jelly and aspartame.  Ashy roast malts.  Mouthfeel is moderate to full.  Overall the house taste kills this."
""
""
""
""
"Medium full body and medium low carbonation."
""
""
"I really enjoy these styles of beers. I think this is a solid attempt at a pumpkin porter and it has a nice touch of pumpkin spice."
"Overall:  This is a damn good beer!  Great balance of pumpkin and spices with the traditional porter flavors of roasted malt and dark bread.  Fantastic!"
""
""
""
""
""
"This could grow on me but at first tasteit's kind of wild. The porter part is not bad but the aftertaste is all over the place. Strong, barrel tasting, bitter then disappears into a watery nothingness. I can get the pumpkin flavor though if you didn't know it was a pumpkin beer, it'd be hard to place the flavor."

"If you like a little subtlety and balance in your beers, you should enjoy this understated pumpkin porter.  If you want a BIG beer, in intensity of flavors or heavy mouthfeel or ABV, you'll have to look elsewhere."

"Good solid Pumpkin Porter.....body is medium which is surprising based on the ABV.....nice notes of both chocolate and.nice pumpkin pie like spicing....a quality pumpkin beer combined with a quality porter base=a quality beer."

"Alaskan has brewed a very well spiced porter. The heavy cinnamon and clove accents work well with the meaty and smokey porter base, never overwhelming the more subtle spicing. The sweet malty flavors of vanilla, graham, and chocolate also blend well with the whole thing. Without those flavors, this porter would be much the worse for wear. I would gladly have this again."
"Pours an almost opaque super dark brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, pumpkin pie spice, and slight cocoa aromas. Taste is much the same with earthy pumpkin and slight spice flavors on the finish. There is a very mild amount of roasty and spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a spice presence that is fairly subdued all around."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste exposes all of the pumpkin spices you can want with an emphasis on the cinnamon while the malty Porter characteristics fall slightly behind but are forward enough to be noticed and enjoyed. A very nice beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Wortha a try indeed for a limited run brew as I got the last one where I bought this one."
""
"Beer is medium bodied, with carbonation of medium-low intensity, resulting in a soft/smooth (1/2) and foamy (1/2) mouthfeel. Closes dry, with moderate stickiness lingering on the palate and lips."
""
"O: A pretty straight forward pumpkin porter. Does exactly what you'd expect. I really enjoy these, I feel that the robustness and sweetness of the roasted malt stands up well to all the pumpkin spice and really balances it nicely. Simple but very tasty."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Well balanced porter with a well blended mix of spices, where none are overwhelming but all are apparent. I could drink this all day."
"Poured into a Reuben's Brew snifter. Pours a very dark opaque brown with a half finger light brown head that dissipates to a ring around the glass. Aroma of sweet toasted malt, chocolate, light pumpkin and pie spices. Flavor is light toasted malt, brown sugar, pumpkin and pie spicing, finishes with light chocolate and a hint of hops. Light to medium bodied, somewhat light for a porter. A nice combination of dark malts and pumpkin, with nicely handled spices, but a bit light in flavor and finishes with a whisper of flavor. I expected a lot from the brewers of the classic smoked porter, but the body of this seems lighter and less interesting. A pleasant, well balanced, but light flavored pumpkin porter."
" An interesting excursion for the holidays. Worth seeking out. Bet this one hits the spot on a cold November night in Juneau."

"T: Kind of mild flavors going on here. Pumpkin upfront, cinnamon and a touch of chocolate. Finish kind of dies and shows a bit of watery malt, but not much else. Not a bad pumpkin beer, but there are a lot of better things out there."
"Overall, very tasty beer, only thing I would really change would be to thicken it up a bit."
""
""
"Overall this is pretty tasty. Like most pumpkin ales though this isn't something I would drink very often."
""
""
"O - Alaskan's Pumpkin Porter is a ridiculously smooth-bodied beer that incorporates soft pumpkin and spice into a more mildly roasted Porter with undertones of chocolate and mocha for a very nice blend of styles."
""
""
""
""
"I say congratulations to Alaskan on this brew. Those looking for the biggest baddest boldest (as I often do) might not agree, but I think they kind of threaded a needle using a fairly straightforward recipe, aside from the pumpkin, and achieving some really nice balance and synergy from the ingredients. I think it coulda been a flop. But they got it right. Pretty sure they did some smaller practice batches before turning this loose. ... Upon reading my praise please note that I have no problem pummeling AK Brewing with fairly harsh criticism when I feel it is deserved. They are the closest large craft brewery to me and I have often complained that they are too tame (with some exceptions). But with this one the tame worked, and I think there is some skill in the brew room facilitating this success."
"O - I find this to be a thin and somewhat uninteresting porter for the base beer. The spices are not overdone, but the pumpkin is a bit lost in the other aromas and tastes. Personally I'd rather have a good porter without the pumpkin and spices any day."
"Pours a deep dark brown with some slight red around the edges. One finger tan head that dissipates quickly. The aroma of pumpkin pie with spice is somewhat muted by the dark roasted malts. The flavor is dark roasted malts, chocolate, a little hops on the finish, with again muted pumpkin spices under it all. Mouth feel is typical porter maybe on the lighter side but nice. Over all I like this beer. It tastes like a chocolate porter/stout with pumpkin spices. A nice change from the standard dark beer."
""
""
"Overall: A pretty solid pumpkin beer. The spices come through the most but there is a nice smokey malt presence."
""
"I have been real into pumpkin stuff this year, and pumpkin dark beers intrigue me like no other. never seen this one before, so I grabbed it up for around 8 or 9 bucks a bomber. it pours very dark, flat black, with a lazy and short lived mocha colored head. it smells very different from others ive had, there is no sweetness at all. despite being brewed with brown sugar, I can taste it, but it doesn't make the beer sweet. I absolutely adore that feature, its unique and it makes this a hit immediately. the pumpkin is there, cloaked in rich chocolate malt and a gentle but detectable spicing. its got an almost chalky feel, not quite so dry, but a little gritty on the palate, nice for autumn. its pretty steady drinking, but the buzz comes on a little harder than most beers around 7% abv for some reason. fuller bodied, it could use another notch of carbonation, but I almost like it a little still. the whole pilot series from Alaskan has been wonderful, and this is one of the best beers in it. a must try for pumpkin lovers."

"A decent take on the pumpkin beer. Sweet with light roast/ cocoa. It's similar to Southern Tier's Warlock but at only 60%."
""
"I have to say upfront that I dislike pumpkin beer in general. That, however, is not why I dislike this beer so intensely. I am astonished that a brewery that's usually so consistent as Alaskan could put out something so abominable, especially in light of their Smoked Porter, which is very, very good."
""
""
""
"O: a solid beer overall. A bit heavy on the spices, but still enjoyable."
""
""
""
"Medium bodied with average carbonation. Has a sweet aftertaste. Another nice beer from Alaskan Brewing, One of the most underrated breweries in the country, in my opinion."
""
""
""
""
"O: Pumpkin leans 'vegetal', which I guess is good for authenticity's sake but it sure doesn't float my boat on this beer. Porter is a stretch for sure. Decent overall."
""
""
""
"Overall: Good aroma and taste, but the sugary finish and off mouthfeel pull it down. Too bad."
""
"Really, this is one of the better pumpkin brews. They went further with the bold flavors and sweet malt, and even though this is totally crazy I think it works pretty well. From the 22 oz bottle purchased at Bottleworks in Seattle."
""
"It was like thanksgiving dessert in a bottle. It looked like the top of a slightly Carmelized pumpkin pie, smelled like the oven it was baking in, tasted like the aforementioned Carmelized part, with a very smooth mouthfeel like pumpkin pudding. I love it - another winner from Juneau."
""

"Based on what was written on the bottle, this was not what I was expecting. It was definitely a good porter, but it didn't have any spicy notes I was expecting, nor the sweetness I was expecting from something that claimed to be flavoured with brown sugar. The flavour was mostly that of a typical porter. It had coffee and cocoa notes, a moderate sweetness. It was on the thin side, but that's typical in America where beers labeled as porters tend to be slightly thinner than those labeled as stouts. Despite this thinness, the """pumpkinness""" in the brew seemed to primarily serve as a fortification of the yeast character. It gave sort of a false impression of a thicker beer than it actually was. The yeast and hint of pumpkin flavour came together very well in this sense. I also wasn't overwhelmed at all by the bitterness of roasted malt or cocoa flavour. This might have been where the brown sugar came in. It didn't taste especially sweet, but there may have been some sugar at play to fight off excessive bitterness. It was definitely a good all-around porter, but there was nothing pumpkiny about it up front. Not the sweet, pumkin-pie flavour I was expecting. The brown sugar advertised was barely noticeable. So, if you want to enjoy it, drink it when you're craving a good, hearty porter, not when you want a sweet, pumpkin pie treat. There wasn't even much in the way of pumpkin-style spices. Cocoa and coffee flavours dominated."

"Lighter bodied, and flavored than I expected from this porter. It's an OK beer, but I had higher hopes for it."
"Overall, a decent pumpkin porter. A bit sweet for my tastes."
""
"On the whole, I think this is a fine beer. It's bold in approach, but doesn't go overboard. It's about as solid as you could hope for a pumpkin porter, in my opinion."
""
"A tasty pumpkin porter. Really the only style of pumpkin beer that I really enjoy, and this one is well done. Not a dominant pumpkin flavor, but more of an allspice pumpkin pie character, blended well with the roasty porter base."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It was everything I expected being advertised as a pumpkin porter. The aromas and flavors are distinguishable."
""
"Ultimately, this is a tasty porter if you are going to have 8-10 ounces and move on. More than that becomes a challenge."
