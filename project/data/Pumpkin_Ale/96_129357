2.96,-14.9,3,3.25,2.75,3,3,"Pours clear medium amber, producing slightly over a finger of beige, mostly finely bubbled but shortlived head that leaves no lace. Aroma is sweet caramel & roasted malts, heavy pumpkin pie spices & some vegetable pumpkin. Like many pumpkin ales the spices are so heavy that the more subtle aromas are somewhat subdued. Taste is thinner than the nose & is a little watery for my taste but has more malt roast than sweet caramel; cinnamon, ginger & other pumpkin pie spices stand out with low pumpkin presence. All flavors are present throughout the sip & there is a definite hop spiciness in the finish that bleeds over as a light bitterness in the dry, cinnamon & ginger aftertaste. Light-medium bodied with low carbonation, thin on the tongue & dry with a spicy prickle.","mothmanscott","Feb 06, 2015"

Pours slightly hazy reddish copper color with a 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of pumpkin, caramel, toasted bread, cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, ginger, and herbal/toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, pumpkin, and spice notes; with good strength. Taste of caramel, pumpkin, toasted bread, cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, ginger, and herbal/toasted earthiness. Light earthy spice bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of pumpkin, caramel, toasted bread, cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, and herbal earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice complexity and solid robustness of dark/bready malt, pumpkin, and spice flavors; with a great malt/spice balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and slightly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very good pumpkin ale. Good complexity, balance, and solid robustness of dark/bready malt, pumpkin, and spice flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Nov 20, 2014"

Taste, likewise, is dominated by the pumpkin spice.  Good pumpkin beer flavor and not too sweet.  Medium bodied.  Overall a pretty typical pumpkin beer.","burnstar","Sep 29, 2014"
3,-13.8,,,,,,"I'm a huge fan of pumpkin beers and really love magic hat.  Sadly this one falls short of pleasing my pallet for everything Fall. The first thing I notice was that the head dissolved into nothing very quickly upon pouring it into a frozen mug. The beer was room temperature the time and maybe that had something to do with it.   The aroma is fain but I pick up hints of cinnamon and nutmeg.  Dark amber in color it is very drinkable and definitely """poundable"""  as another reviewer stated.  Poundable only because the taste is unremarkable. I'm getting a slightly bitter finish to a watered down consistency.   Won't be buying again.","Devsidell","Sep 29, 2014"

This  brew has a bold flavor of pumpkin and spices.  The mouthfeel is nice and crisp  There is nothing over powering in this brew.  Wilhelm Scream has a nice balance to it.
