Aroma is of mild pumpkin, nutmeg, some cinnamon spices, notes of caramel malt become more prevalent as it warms up. Taste similar to aroma with some mild bitterness. A medium body with moderate carbonation on the palate. Caramel malt, pumpkin, nutmeg and mild cinnamon spices and mild bitterness on the end. Not as cloying and overly sweet as some other pumpkin brews, but nothing really stellar either. Overall an ok drinking brew for a pumpkin brew.","Samp01","Dec 18, 2014"

But whatever, this beer pours really dark brown with a nice head. A lot of pumpkins don't really get a lot of suds but this one does. Aroma is malty and herbal, spiced, and has another buttery element, which really comes through in the flavor. As with a lot of other pumpkins, I don't get much pumpkin, mostly spice. Has a nice mouthfeel, a lot lighter than I expected with how dark it is in color, and good carbonation. I do like this beer, and think it's a nice take on the style.","BeerWizard","Sep 16, 2014"

3.25,-8.7,,,,,,"Another interesting beer from Anderson. This one pours a nice dark pumpkin. The aroma and taste are slightly subdued and that is ok because it allows the pumkin taste to come out naturally and not be overpowered by too many spices. The pumpkin is a natural flavor and this beer is light yet still refreshing and satisfying","hophugger","Sep 05, 2014"
3.8,6.7,,,,,,"Pours a cloudy brown with a creamier white head. The head mostly leaves quickly, but a little hangs on to leave a small amount of nice lacing. The aroma is distinctly pumpkin, but real pumpkin, not the candy-corn pumpkin pie-esque smell of other pumpkin ales. There is also a hint of the spices. The taste is savory, with the pumpkin's gourd qualities front and center and the spice backing it up. It all comes together on the finish. The body is thicker and there's a fair amount of carbonation. This is a pumpkin beer I'd drink again.","delta490","Sep 05, 2014"

The nose comprises maple syrup, granola, light molasses, toasted pumpkin seeds, and a relatively mild blend of pumpkin pie spices.  The taste brings in more of the same, the spices blending with the syrup/molasses-laden graham-cracker malt backbone rather well, ensuring neither faction attains too much authority.  The body is a stolid medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a thickly fluid feel.  Overall, a rather nice pumpkin ale, one that doesn't dropkick you with spice or booze.  I could see drinking a few sixers of this during this upcoming pumpkin ale season.","TMoney2591","Aug 16, 2014"

Great lacing began to form as the head fell. The nose smelled like a Yankee candle, thanks to a heavy (seeming) presence of vanilla to go along with the other spices. I am unsure just how I feel about this as it is different, but I have also tried a LOT of different pumpkins this year and for this to just appear is wondrous. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full and I am beginning to wonder if that is not a construct of the spices interacting with the yeast in some way. It was not quite creamy, but it was on the approach. Cinnamon was the prevalent spice, but clove and ginger were also in the mix and so was the vanilla flavor noted on the nose. Finish was semi-dry with the malt getting a chance to offset the spices. Overall, it was better than many, but not as good as some. YMMV.","woodychandler","Nov 22, 2013"

I saw that and automatically thought that the beer must have something special, or maybe it was just damn good. Luckily I only purchased two in a mix-a-six at my local beverage center. This beer should be in the $8.99-$10.99 price range just like the other six-packs of average pumpkin beers right next to it on the shelf. The UFO, Sam Adams, Smuttynose pumpkin ales are just a few that are much better. How a brewery or a store could offer this product at such a price is ridiculous. I will never buy this again.

After the exceptional looking head and appearance, I had high expectations for this beer, alas it wasn't quite up to snuff and nowhere near as good as yesterday's Fat Jack.","ONovoMexicano","0"

Very strong aromas, of cinnamon and allspice,pumpkin and toffee nice Taste is very spicy up front with the cinnamon dominating,kinda drown out everything else! Mouthfeel is fine..well carbonated but smooth at the same time..except for the cinnamon! Overall if this beer had replicated the aroma in the taste itwould have been a 4.0..too much cinnamon..its like cinnamon chewing gum flavours!","Reidrover","Sep 22, 2013"

Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of earthy malt and pumpkin pie spice aromas. Taste is much the same with dirt and pumpkin pie spice flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an above average beer with a solid pumpkin pie spice aroma but there is an odd dirt-like flavor that I am not too fond of.","UCLABrewN84","Sep 05, 2013"
