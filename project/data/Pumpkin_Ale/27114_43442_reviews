"Interesting look but I really can't decide if it's enticing or just fun. Certainly a fantastic beer for Halloween (alcohol is 6.66%  ha!). Nice aroma and good flavor but a chemical (dye?) aftertaste and linger. Gimmicky? Yes. Fun? Yes. Good? meh."
"Not overly sweet or pumkiny (if that's even a word) and a hint of espresso flavor.  A perfect Fall beer."

"This is, hands down, my favorite beer of all time. I encountered it a few years ago back home in Atlanta at a place called The Porter. It has a lovely blood red color and a pinkish foam that I've never seen in any other beer I've ever had. It has hints of apple, orange, and a floral print somewhere from what I tasted. At 6.66% ABV, it's a devilishly delightful drink. It's a little thin in your mouth, which doesn't really make a lot of sense considering the flavor you get. Also, the smell, doesn't really hit you as hard as I think it should, but those two things are minor compared to the beautiful flavor."

"The taste on the other hand is nothing to brag about. It was drinkable, I will only have it this once."

"O: This beer seems like it is much higher in alcohol than it is since the alcohol is not well hidden at all. Not the easiest beer in this style to drink. This might be a better beer for drinking with some roasted pork than after dinner."
""

"Pours a reddish amber with a pinkish hued slowly fading medium head. Aroma and Taste of toasted barley, some caramel malt, yeast bready notes with some fruity esters, some mild bitterness. Palate is a medium body, crisp with good carbonation. Finishes with some toasted barley, malt, yeast a bit of fruity flavor and light bitterness. Overall not withstanding the pink head an ok drinking brew."

"Shmaltz Coney Island Freaktoberfest ---3.5/5"

"O - interesting appearance for an Oktoberfest seasonal but it fits better for the Halloween theme. Not as flavorful or as big a malt profile as the usual Oktoberfest seasonal, but the berry addition makes it a very unique beer, especially being characterized as an amber/red lager. Great beer, and if in the mood for an amber lager, this would be high on the list!"
""
""
"O - Pretty good beer. Not something that I will go out of my way to find. This is certainly not an Oktoberfest beer, which it is SORT of advertised as. It is categorized on this site as a red/amber lager. In that, this is an above average red, in my opinion."
""
""
""
"Whoa...got beer ingredients plus...mild malts, peppercorns, melon rind, bitter hops, sangria. Overall a tasty brew with fun color and aroma. Should it taste like an Octoberfest...well, on the label it says it's not that style...it's a Freaktoberfest beer. I'm OK with that. It seems like many reviewers take away because of the color, lack of imperial taste, or the like...might have been good to try this brew without seeing it's color, then rating it in comparison. This is an example of why I believe the appearance should be of much less significance than the aroma and, especially, the taste. The proof is in the pudding and even with probably a few more months of aging than is appropriate, this beer taste good, not imperially great, but I don't find anything significantly wrong and it has good body, flavors and tastes. Also great to pour at a blind tasting!!"

"I think itâ€™s another very interesting beer from Schmaltz, one of my favorite US breweries!"
"O - Once I notice the blood off-flavor in a beer, its hard to get past. Lacks the clean taste and feel that a lager should have."

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. This pours a red color with a very light haze, looks almost like koolaid, and a pint foamy head which has good retention. The smells are mostly malty, some biscuit, caramel, fruit, grass. The feel is medium. The taste is good enough, a little syrup sweetness, some biscuit, but then more bitterness than expected, perhaps some rye."
""
"Decent bitterness for a beer that one would presume to be an Octoberfest. Round start of lightly toasted malt. The finish is peppery bitterness. The body leans toward watery, but the carbonation is low."
""
""
"O- So unique, it's like a cider/wine mets a marzen and has a baby. It's never too sweet, the bready malts and cranberry bitterness keep that in check. Not really an example of the style, but an awesome off beat brew."
"Overall - Not a bad brew; actually, pretty good. Not a fan of the artificial coloring, but it's not a deal breaker."
""
""
""
""
"On tap at Kickbacks in Jax. Poured into a small snifter. Pink head, fluffy with good retention. Oily, soapy lacing. Ruby red body. Aroma of sweet maltiness, candi like sugars, hop bitterness and maybe some raspberry. Taste has a nice malt sweetness, some resinous grapefruit bitterness. Not really getting any fruit on the taste, maybe the color was fooling me. Anywho, interesting looking beer, very drinkable with a nice taste."
"Poured into a He'brew small shaker pint. Pours a cherry red amber with an appropriate one finger light pink head with good retention and lacing. Subdued aroma of light biscuit malt, fruit and nonidentifiable vegetables. Flavor is bready malt, grassy hops, dark and light fruit finishing spicy with a sharp and somewhat acrid hop bitterness. An unusually flavored lager, but no identifiable ingredient for the oddness. Medium bodied. Odd, but certainly fun to drink, it lives up to its presentation and label art. The finish is a bit unbalanced."
""
"O: It seems that this beer would go well with meats because it is a little malty and has some spices and dryness to cut through the food."
""
"Medium bodied with average carbonation. Just not a good beer. The whole gimmick is the label art, and the color of the beer inside. A failure of a beer."
""
""
"O: Disappointed this is my first beer from Coney Island. I have heard positive reviews of the brewery but this beer is a gimmick. Not amused. For a seasonal red lager Freaktoberfest misses crisp, clean flavors of Munich malts while showcasing a rich lager yeast. If the style is brewed for amusement to please circus folk this is spot on."
"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, no bottle dating(but apparently from last year). Pours lightly hazy reddish copper color with a nice 2 finger dense light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Good spotty lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of pear, apple, raisin, caramel, toast, molasses, biscuit, nuttiness, and light earthiness. Pretty nice aromas with good strength and balance. Taste of caramel, pear, raisin, toast, toffee, apple, molasses, biscuit, earth, and light herbal spiciness. Lingering notes of caramel, pear, raisin, toast, molasses, biscuit, earth, and light herbal spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Nice balance and robustness of flavors; almost zero cloying sweetness present on the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy and fairly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with almost zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a nice Oktoberfest style. Nice balance and robustness of flavors; very smooth to drink. This is fairly on par with the style as well. Definitely an enjoyable offering."
""
""
" Pretty thin mouthfeel and it actually doesn't hide the booze very well. This is a one and done beer for me I'm afraid."
"Overall, I'm never buying a Coney Island beer again."
""
"O - Fun beer for Halloween but not one that stands out. Perfect to spice up a party with a good and flavorful beer."
"O - Overall, this is a solid, tasty beer, gimmick or no gimmick. Would be a great choice for a Halloween party or similar occasion."
""
"Poured into a glass mug. Pours clear dark red with a thick, moderately quickly dissipating pink head. I detect a moderate amount of tiny bubbles visible in the beer. It definitely looks gimmicky, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. I pick up some bready and some caramel malts in the aroma. There are some earthy and floral hops. There's some mild fruity aroma, which might explain the color. The taste definitely excites more than the nose as the hops come through pretty well. There are earthy, floral, and piney hop notes that are very forward. There is a solid bready and caramel malt backbone. There's some citrus and some mild cherry notes. The hop bitterness lingers in the aftertaste. The body is medium with moderate carbonation. The finish is crisp with solid drinkability. This is a very good beer despite the gimmick. It would inspire some conversation if consumed at a Halloween party."

"12oz bottle poured into a tulip glass. Pours yields a ruby garnet with a thin pinkish frothy head on top. Looks like cranberry ginger ale. The nose is sweet with notes of strawberry, pale fruit quality, but closes out with a musty veggie scent. Crisp mouth. Good carbonation, finishes clean. The musty character carries over to the flavor as there is a dank """old""" flavor that pervades this beer. Flavors of beets, cherry medicine, mild fruits, touch of bitterness on the back end. This beer sure was an oddity. Not sure I would venture here again as I really didn't care for the medicinal quality of this one, but then again, it wasn't so horrendous that I wouldn't have it again if offered. Too far out there from my favorite true fall-beers."

"Overall, this beer is really all about the gimmick with the red color and the abv and is honestly pretty unimpressive. Nothing offensive, however, and an ok seasonal."
""
"Overall: A pretty interesting and solid brew. A nice mix of herbal hops and malts."
"this is an all around great beer, damn shame it's a seasonal.. i've had it for the past 4-5 years and always look forward to it."
""
""
"The feel is the best part of this beer, as it's lightly crisp but gets pretty lush as it rolls on the tongue. The body is pretty much even medium, leaning slightly toward lighter. The creamy smoothness goes into the finish while the crispness, though light, doesn't back off either."
""
""
"O: Glad I tried it, but not something Id pick up again.. very low drinkability.. a one and done type. I feel like the beer is just too busy all around, too many flavors flying around to enjoy it.. but A+ for creativity on this one.. love the 6.66% indeed"
"Overall a great alternative in this season. Blood red, unique taste, drinkable. Tough time of the year to compete in beers with more fruit of a flavor."
""
""
""
""
"O - Good beer but will wear out it's welcome pretty quick. The four pack is probably by design because after the second beer is starts to become less """fun""" and more """disFUNctional""""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability is decent. I can drink 1 to 1.5 bottles until it really becomes a chore to drink. The other two bottles out of the 4 pack will be shared with friends."

"Mouthfeel is fine- medium body and light carbonation (a little prickly). Too sweet in a weird way, which interferes with the drinkability for sure. Only bought a bottle of this and I'm glad for it."
""
""
""
""
"O- not too crazy bout this stuff at all but I'm not hatin on it. Looking back it doesn't bother me that I spent 2.29 on it. Worth it id say as its an experience to try. Neither satisfied nor unsatisfied. I like shmaltz so I'll try anything they put out."
"Overall- Not a terrible brew but a little too gimmicky for my tastes."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - A unique twist on the amber/red lager by Coney Island. This is my first sampling by them and I quite enjoy this one. The blackcurrant and citrus flavours are very nice and refreshing. For those who are adventurous, this is worth a try."
""
"D - I feel kind of bad due to this review being based off a bottle terribly outdated, but I can't fathom this could be an enjoyable brew at any point in it's life time. The sad part is, after I choke down this 4 pack, I know I have to revisit this one next Fall, and give it a fair trial."
""
"O: There is a lot wrong with this. Alcohol tasted at only 6.66%, way too sticky-sweet, too many conflicting flavors, and demonic art work on the bottle looking at me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Make sure you wash off your lips because it turns them red!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Morey's Bottom Line: I could do without the food coloring and the 6.66% alcohol, but I actually kind of enjoy the sour flavor. It's not overwhelming. Just enough. A fun halloween/fall beer. This was given to me in a mixed 6 for Christmas. Glad that I got to try it."
"Overall: this is one weird-ass beer. Any beer with a noticeable amount of rye in it can be really hit or miss for me. This one was more of a miss."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A little weird....but the flavors are not bad. I don't like sweeter beers so I wouldn't necessarily try again, but worth the try."
""
""
""
"O - I originally bought this bear thinking it was an Octoberfest. Not really what I was looking for, but glad that I tried it."
""
""
""
""
""
"A great looking and fine tasting red. Recommended."

"Overall: Bloody good brew. Wouldn't drink all year, but it's a fun seasonal. Perfect for a Halloween party. Schmaltz is right up there with Stone for creative labels."
"This was not a good experience. Unfortunately this will have to be a drain pour. I haven't experienced that in months."
"O - a fun and unique take, not the tastiest amber or oktoberfest or whatever its supposed to be, but points for doing their own thing"
"o - drainpour. strictly a novelty for the halloween season. try a single bottle before you buy more, because $10 for a 4pk isn't cheap, and this beer is definitely not worth that price."
"It sure looks the part for a Halloween beer! When they say blood-red, they aren't kidding. I wasn't aware that blood was supposed to be so sweet though, this lager smells very sweet and tastes the part too. The mouthfeel is alright, but overall, this is just too sweet to be a regular. It's a nice novelty for the season, but I wouldn't get more than a single."
"O- Okay to drink for Halloween but I definitely don't plan on having this again."
"Overall an interesting take on a traditional brew, very tasty and refreshingly different."
"O: I guess I hadn't read the bottle before I poured, because I had no idea it would be blood red. Then I read this: """6 Malts. 6 Hops. 6.66% Alc. Blood red lager""" ... Nice touch. I think this beer is perfect for a Halloween party. It has an exceptionally sinister presentation and is still a really tasty beer to sip."
"There simply wasn't enough going on here to make me interested, besides the freakish color."
"Fairly interesting and decent brew. Not stellar, but worth trying at least once for the novelty and presentation. Would be a fun beer to break out at a halloween party."
"A decent, if not slightly bitter lager, this is enjoyable enough as a freak show, but not the kind of brew you'd want to drink every day. The biggest attraction of this beer, sad to say, is the sizzle; the crazy cool label, the blood-red brew (dyed, I've heard, with beets) and the awsome cap, second only to Ayinger's Oktoberfest label. Hmm, since beer, of course, isn't bought based upon the label, cap or color, this is more of a party beer, not a serious consumption beer."
"O - An interesting experience. If the pour would have been bolder and hadn't overflowed I might have giving the appearance a 5. At first I couldn't imagine drinking this for Fall, but soon realized theres no other way i'd have it. Its light and heavy, simple, yet complex. Its definitely a Halloween inspired beer, just like everything else they do. Try it, and don't be afraid to buy a six pack, I would, however its unavailable in my area. RIP Steve Jobs! Cheers~!"
"O - This would be a nice tailgating brew with a splash of vodka... Interesting. All over the board, hard to rate... Drinking many of these would produce a KILLER hangover."
"Overall, this is certainly a beer that lives up to its name, being a wild freakshow of a beverage that is sure to take you on a wild ride. I can't say the result is """good," since I think the beer moves too far down the track in favor of funky fruit esters, and the pineapple and cherry notes border on cloying, but it is most certainly a unique beverage that is worth trying at least once--though you might want to share with a friend, just in case."
"Cheers??"
"O - Strange looking, but not too bad overall. I like the strong carbonation and medium hops finish. Bought on recommendation of store clerk and I liked the labelâ€¦"
"O- I get that it's supposed to be a different beer. Different is good if the quality backs it up. This one did not do it for me. Probably wouldn't drink again unless it was my only option."
"O: This is simply not a very appetizing beer. It has some good qualities, but it misses the mark."
"Overall: I did not enjoy this beer at all. It was a chore to drink the few ounces I did. Not my kind of beer I guess."
"This beer gushed all over my sink when I opened it. Pours a hazy cranberry red with a 1 inch light red head that settles to a thin cap. Foamy patterns of lace line the glass on the drink down. A very interesting looking beer to say the least. Smell is of sweet malt, some berry, and some tomato juice. Taste is of malt and bitter chemicals. There is a very slight fruit/vegetable flavor in the aftertaste. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very interesting beer on paper but in reality it's pretty gross in my opinion."
"This is a nice beer. The appearance is intriguing and the taste is surprisingly complex. I'm having a hard time figuring out how they got the beer such a ruby red without affecting the flavor profile...freaky to say the least. Worth checking out!"
"O: Well, this is a weird looking beer and of course it is gimmicky but it's also really tasty; I like this stuff"
"Mouthfeel: It is a very smooth drinking beer not too heavy not too light."
"Smell is rather boring, some malt and barley with little to no hops. Taste is rather bland as well. For something deemed 'feaktoberfest,' this is an incredibly timid beer."
"O- Picked this one up blind. I guess by the name and the season it would be some sort of Marzen. Nope, not even close and not very impressed."
"overall not bad but not anywhere close to what I was expecting for the style. Too bitter, too sweet, too much caramel and reddish malts."
"Pours a bright red, with a pink head. If I didn't know what it was, I would say it looked like a kriek. The head sticks around for a while and leave behind some sticky lacing on the glass. Malty cereal grain aromas, the smell reminds me of when I brew beer. Little bit of hop bitterness after a toasty malt flavor on the palate. It kind of reminds me of a hoppy brown ale if it weren't for the color. Not my favorite offering from this brewery, but not bad."
"Interesting, malt and hops are a little out of whack. I can appreciate the novelty though, and i applaud Shmaltz, especially the color."
"This beer pours a cloudy amber color. The head is an inch and a half in height, and recedes slowly leaving nice sticky lacing. The taste and aroma are of a generic caramel malt character that can be found in many other bad/boring beers. There is no depth in either the flavor or aroma. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with inappropriately low carbonation, and a sticky texture. Overall, this is a bad beer that I will not drink again."
"Overall I must say how much I was surprised by this. I was talked into this by the guy at the bottle shop. When I got home I read the reviews and was pissed that I was talked into a shitty beer. That was six or seven months ago. I finally cracked it tonight and didn't think is was bad at all. Maybe time did this one good. A must check out for the morbid Halloween crowd."
"It doesn't taste as complex as the 6 malts and 6 hops would expect you to believe, but it's a fun, unique, tasty, and drinkable beer."
"The color of this beer is frightfully red, I am sure hoping that they used beets in the mash instead of food coloring. White, thin head disappears into pink clouding. Smell is cloyingly sweet maltiness, and a slight chemical tinge. The taste is better than the smell, very solidly malty and slightly grainy. Not the worst beer if you get past the smell and appearance."
"A surprise cap to this most recent Bliss tasting. It pours a mostly clear dark pink lemonade topped by a finger of pink-white foam. The nose comprises slightly toasted caramel, grapefruit rind, and grass. The taste focuses on the fruitier notes, including, in the back, a lingering mystery fruit that I just cannot put my finger on. This concoction, while not necessarily offensive, does not sit very well on my tongue. The body is a light medium, with a moderate carbonation and a kinda dry finish. Overall, a completely unappealing beer, even if there's nothing outright terrible about it. Boo this stuff."
"It is a kind of creamy, robust lager. It is smooth and well balanced. There is some kind of fruit taste, but not from yeast. The color is a crazy red, including the head. Hey, I'm not drinking beer, I'm drinking pop. Red pop. Not really enough going on here to justify the price unless novelty is worth a big premium (halloween and you want to drink something unique)."
"WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS?! I don't appreciate it when beers are given names that make them sound like a different style than they actually are. I bought this thinking it was an Oktoberfest and it came out looking like someone bottled a bad day at the hospital. Upon further reviewing, my opinion is slightly increasing. The aroma is very light with malts. The taste has some sour malts and maybe some fruit, but that could just be my eyes forcing a taste association. It has a bit of a twang and makes the center of my tongue tingle. Will I get this again, not likely."
"O: This was definitely an interesting beer. Worth a try just because. The appearance is shocking, and for most beer drinkers it probably sets up failure for the rest of the beer. As for the taste it was pretty good until the aftertaste becomes to sour, like a lingering metallic lemon or lime flavor, that seems to stick to the roof of your mouth."
"O: The only thing freaky about this beer is that it's freakishly gross. Pretty beer, but that just doesn't cut it."
"O - I can't say that I'm a huge fan of this particular offering. It had some odd flavours and just wasn't anything I was a big fan of. Certainly festive and would be suitable for a Halloween party, but just didn't offer the flavours I was hoping for."
"D - This has good drinkability. It goes down easy, and the taste is good. This beer is very interesting, and the flavor never got boring. I think that this is a good representation of the style, and I would try it again."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability - A very musty, light bodied, and artificial tasting beverage. This beer is definitely one freak that will remain an outcast to me. With respect to Shmaltz, I did not like this beer at all."
"Drinkability: Normally, I really like beers that exemplify a given style exceptionally well. However, I like this beer for the exact opposite reason. It is a full-flavored lager that really defies categorization. BA calls it an American Amber/Red Lager and it certainly is red but it is truly unlike any other amber lager I've ever had. This beer is highly recommended if for no other reason than it will bend your preconceived notions of amber lagers. A true freak in all the best ways..."
"Wow! I can't believe the cherry red color this beer poured out of the bottle. I was not expecting that. It had an average amount of fluffy pink head on it. Smell is not too great. Taste is alright but the aftertaste is not so great. Bitter but a little off. Average mouthfeel and drinkability. I'd try it again, but I couldn't drink too many of them."
"Drinkability is also good; easy to put a few down in one sitting"
"I highly enjoyed this beer, perhaps it just needs some time in the bottle to take on some additional positive characteristics?"
"The palate opens with a blend of bitterness and fruitiness that is rather unpleasant. It makes me think I'm being force fed noble hops drizzled with artificial cherry syrup with artificial sweeteners. There's a grainy, husky tannin character that's harsh and unpleasant. Bitter on the finish with a mix of grain and hops, this is offensive and a waste of my time and money."
"I am going against the tide here and just cannot stand this beer. Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. Pours an odd colored beer, and this is no exception. Imagine my surprise (unsuspecting victim that I was since I bought the beer because the name seemed cool and I wanted to be daring with Shmaltz) when the pour was a candy apple red with a massive pick fizzy/foamy head. (I'm having flashbacks to Romulan Ale and Magic Hat Wacko, which are two of my most hated experiences in the last year.) Still, I'll give this one a shot. Aromas are fairly weak... a bit of dough, light brown sugar and some apple or fruit of some sort... it's hard, though, when your eyes are assaulted at every turn. Flavor is pretty non-eventful. A bit of an oktoberfest boozy graininess to it, some caramel and a funkiness that might be the dye or whatever. A tingly alcohol presence throughout."
"Mouthfeel is pretty thin. Not a favorite beer at all."
"This is a nice nutral drink here, the whole crazy halloween thing plays wellI had a growler this for halloween and drank from a trumer pils beaker and thought it was awesome! love the abv!!!!"
"Sweet but easy-drinking. Found this brew to be pretty enjoyable and am a little surprised by the mostly lackluster reviews."
"Deep blood red color with a pale red thin head that dissapates quickly. I was suprised, this thing is seriously red. Definitely fits what the brewers were aiming for. Pretty clear, a little haze and bubbles, but mostly clear. Smells faintly of some fruity hops, nothing is easy to pick out but I'd guess it's a pretty good mix of things. It tastes average, not my favorite red lager by a long shot but I think it's supposed to be different so I'll judge it on its own. It's got a sweet malty smooth finish that ends in a very quick bitter finish and an about 2 second aftertaste. It's different. Medium carbonation and light bodied. It's ok, I mean it's different. I thought going in it was an octoberfest, then saw it was a red/amber and don't really agree. It's unique. The only time I'd buy a six-pack would be around Halloween for a party or something b/c it looks pretty awesome."
"Poured to about a half inch head. Head was pink in color. Brew itself was red or blood in color. Head didnt hang around for very long, but did leave a little lacing on the sides of the glass. Smelled of malt, bread and a little alcohol. Tasted of malt,bread,and a little alcohol. Had a slight bitter aftertaste. Felt ok in the mouth. Carbonation I thought was right. I got this bottle from a friend. I was glad to be able to taste it. But I dont think I would buy a sixer of it. I did like the looks of the bottle."
"Sometimes, I strongly dislike a beer for promising something good with the smell, then underdelivering. This beer makes good on the halfhearted promise of its unpleasant aroma."
"D: Not a huge red beer fan and this is most assuredly one of the strangest beers I have ever tried. Worth trying once, especially if you are a red/amber beer fan."
"Pours a bright reddish color, perhaps a very dark pink. Whatever. Nose is somewhat muted, though some faint hoppy aromas are noted. On the palate is more hop presence than what I thought there would be for an Octoberfest, with some toasty malt grain flavors too. Finishes toasty with a hop presence as well."
"Drinkability - Definitely not the usual lager taste but crisp and tasty. I could see myself sitting and having a few of these around the bar."
"D - I'm gonna go ahead and discard this brew. The flavor is odd, almost pushing the boundaries of being off. It's not awful but the only place I can see this beer making another appearance in my life would be at a Halloween party where it would fit right in with the BMC crowd perfectly."
"Drinkability is very average for me. I really think their marketing here is in the packaging, making it kind of a gimmick beer. The beer itself could never live up the intense packaging creation that they brewed up. I could see people bringing this to a fall party to show off the box, and the red color of the beer, but overall its important qualities are all just very average."
"It's pretty average, I suppose. I can see why it is classified as an amber as opposed to an oktoberfest. Even then, while drinkable, it isn't remarkable."
"something different and decent in all areas but flavor, unfortunately that's a very important area when it comes too enjoying beer"
"My imagination seems driven to conjure up cough syrup analogies, which aren't entirely apt. Overall, an underwhelming red lager, the overly-evident shtick adding nothing beyond saleability for upcoming Hallowe'en parties."
"I dunno, food-colouring aside this is a fairly mediocre red ale or Oktoberfest, whichever way you wish to slice it, it lacks cohesion as the flavour goes off in seperate directions, and although it gets a bit intense in parts there doesn't seem to be much reward for the effort. I call gimmick on this one."
"I wouldn't recomend this brew"
"This went down relatively easy and the novelty of a 6.66 (how beastly) ABV%, like the rest of this beer, wore a bit thin after a while. I could have more than one in a sitting but unlike the freaks at Coney Island, I'm not gonna down one of these in 5 seconds. As crazy as it sounds, there's nothing else like it and if for no other reason, this beer deserves to be tried by all since it'll challenge the notion of what constitutes and American Amber. As much as I was just """blah""" about this, I am looking forward to having the rest of the bottles that I bought just to see if it's any different the second time around."
"Poured from bottle into... WTF! This beer is bright red with a pink head and slight lacing. Definitley not ready for that, I was expecting a typical marzen. I give it a 5 for novelty alone, but the color is actually pretty amazing. Smell is sweet cherries, fruity malts, some hops and fruity yeast. Taste is sweet fruits with a good hop bitterness and a bit of red rope licorice - very well balanced. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a moderate carbonation. This beer is actually very drinkable. The flavors go well together and create a very unique lager. A little pricey but I have to say the novelty of this beer (6.66% ABV, ha!) and the above average taste have won me over."
"I could drink a bunch of these."
"This is a solid beer. Its a very interesting one to say the least. I have to admit that I was a bit sucked in by the labeling (This is not an Oktoberfest...)."
"D-Pretty rough around the edges actually, and not very pleasant to drink."
"I had a sixteen ounce glass of this at the Amsterdam Ale House on Manhattan's upper west side. I expected it to be a marzen but know as soon as I saw it that it wouldn't be. It was very dark, almost black, with a dark brown head. Carbonation is light, aroma and flavor are very malty and actually a little sweet. I didnt' really like it but it's worth trying."
"Strange looking pour, to me. Head which disappated quickly, was a strawberry color and the beer itself almost looks as if food coloring were added. Almost like a dark pink lemonade. Smells of crisp, smooth, malts. Very pleasant smelling. Medium bodied, a bit over carbonated. A burst of flavors on the initial sip. I cannot figure this one out. A bit of bitterness at the end plus kinda yeasty. A bit unpleasant and syrupy. Still having trouble identifying anything but cough syrup and a lingering bitterness. Not something I would go for again, but worth a try. Definitely different than any other beer I've ever tried, strangely though."
"Very nice brew by Shmaltz."
"Drinkability - I'd love to try more of this beer, although the bitterness is bit beyond my general tastes. Very cool brew!"
"D - I liken this beer to this situation - You witness a man in a banana suit arguing at the counter of a deli while an elderly woman beats him with a cane. You go away thinking """Did that just happen???""" If you like feeling like you witnessed, or ingested, something beyond explanation - this one's for you."
"Drinkability is not bad, decent beer, just doesn't look really appealing in the glass."
"This thing was just off. Novelty aside (6.66% abv. I get it. It's not making me laugh, but I get it.), theres nothing right and just about this thing. I'm afraid this will take up good tap space for a long time. Please be only a sixth keg!"
"Notes: It's a little bit of a gimmicky beer and not a true Oktoberfest but it's still a decent and enjoyable beer."
"The beer pours a dark red, almost purple color with a thick frothy pink head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is average. It really doesn't have much of an aroma at all. It's malty with a pale, Munich malt aroma. It's sweet with a touch of hops. The taste is decent. It has a unique flavor that's sweet with pale and Munich malts, yet bitter with a good amount of hops in the finish. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a unique beer, but nothing I'd seek out again. I'm not a big fan of the """purple""" character of this beer. It takes away from the taste and aroma, but does add something to the appearance."
"D - Not a chance would I have this again. Truthfully I got more enjoyment from Pizza beer in a sense that it at least it had FLAVOR! I even overpaid for it getting a bottle for a whopping 3.25. And to think I could have had a real Oktoberfest. I have no idea why the beer bro's enjoyed this so much or why they still make it but it's a pretty sub par beer that only get sales from being """weird""" PASS!"
"D: Only because it is a Halloween fall color and its intrigue hits with such force, yes definitly a drinker."
"drinkability - solid amber but for the money i would buy brooklyn lager"
"D - One was enough."
"Appears a deep blood red orange juice accent, a pink tingedhead forms thick above the body this is a unique looking brew. Aroma has tart fruit smells blended with a unique cherry skin earthy quality. I don't know what fruits created this freaky lager, but it's interesting. Aroma has a faint citrus quality with herbal hops in the background, now let's taste this amazingly different brew. Earthy minty quality brings hops and dry bitter slightly sweet malt tones like an okotberfest with a bit more earthiness. Mouthfeel is interesting with a light to medium bodied carbonation flowing through each sip. Drinkability overall is a bit rough I don't know about this style or beer, why the color why the flavors it's a bit harsh in every regard."
"Gimmicky or good? Both! Gotta hand it to Shmaltz. Their marketing is simply awesome. This is a fun, unique and tasty lager--that's all that really matters."
"Subtle and thin punchy hop aromas are the first thing I notice. A deep blood-red liquid pours from the bottle into the glass goblet. Healthy carbonation creates a large fluffy head that is a combination of tan and cherry. A crisp lager undertone sets the tone for an extra bitter multiple hop profile, some fruity notes on the back end reminds me of cranberry while a downward sour bitterness layers the crunch of the malt and wheat. The edgy bitterness of the hops in collaboration with some wild microcarbonation rough up an otherwise smooth mouth feel. Its an OK brew, but nothing to write home about."
"D- can't help but say i feel ripped off. overly sweet for my tastes and by the end the alcohol becomes prominent in the flavor profile. not to mention the weird color. wish they mentioned dye on thre label."
"tried to give the beer some character with the label, but only managed to give it a wierd factor"
"Basically its a good beer, reddish/orange in color and it carries the same mouthfeel as most other Coney Island varieties. It is, however, not as good as the white lager or the basic lager that they brew. I would say that its worth a try, but buy a single before you buy a case."
"D: not to flavorfull overall around but a good session beer. I got say the color of the beer is intresting."
"M/D: Seems well balanced. Good beer for what it is promoting, somewhat gimmicky. I like a lot of their other beers, this is just a one time beer."
"(d) Got this thinking I would get a unigue marzen, but that wasnt the case at all. Dissapointingly flat, but refreshingly crisp when all the fruit aspects are taken into consideration. Not a beer I will buy again, pretty forgetable. (2.5/5)"
"Great finish with all of beer qualities layered and coming through. Crazy looking but tastes very good."
"D: This beer was a bit of let down for me. After seeing the Crazy looking guy on the bottle, the freakish name, and strange color, I was expecting big flavors. But once you get past the packaging and appearance, it's pretty mundane. Certainly not a bad beer, but I wouldn't go out of my way to have another one."
"D - A pretty drinkable beer, I enjoy the wierdness and I could handle this on a regular basis as it tastes clean and has a nice amount of hop flavor w/out overdoing it. Worth a try since it isn't just lager w/ food coloring a la Magic Hat -Wacko."
"Drinkability: A curious novelty that is easy to drink but not something to which I would return"
"D: Balance is a little off. Hop character is incomplete and doesn't pair greatly with malts."
"Rokken like Dokken, think way outside of the box for a fall seasonal. Not an O-fest and there are enough pumpkin spiced brews out there, make this your alt beer for the fall."
"This bomber pours a clear golden cranberry color with a decent berry colored head with good lacing. The aroma is malty raspberry, cider, very firm and likeable. The taste is a fair translation of the aroma with plenty of malt and raspberry overtones and root sharpness. Crisp and refreshing yet near mid-body feel. A bit of Dr. Pepper herbal quality. Very decent version of the style, nice and drinkable enough."
"Blood red with a big airy pink cotton candy head that leaves scraps of pink lace on the glass. The nose on this one is kind of funky, a faint mustiness permeates the otherwise mild toasted grain aroma. This beer is okay but just a little off the mark to my taste buds, maybe oxidation? but halloween was less than two weeks ago. Maybe it's just a case of too much going on with the six hops and six malts. Medium light bodied with smooth carbonation. This beer gets a little better as it goes, I think the appearance plays mind games with my taste buds. A strange offering that is not really on par with other Schmaltz beers."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Just a moderate to light, average texture that just keeps the action happening. A bit busy in terms of flavor to session or drink more that one."
"D: Very much of novelty in my book. The look is certainly reminiscent of a cherry lambic, for whatever that's worth. The beer's harsh metal flavors really detracted from the experience. Kind of fun as a one time experience, but not worth a revisit."
"Notes: It states clearly that this is not a n Oktoberfest but a Freaktoberfest and should be taken as such. The brew is a visual shocker, at least at first, and it sure makes for an eccentric social offering. There resides its biggest asset. Having said that it is not half as bad or even as mediocre as one would be led to believe. It is a rather wacky brew, but fairly drinkable and enjoyable. It seems to do rather well what it sets itself to do."
"After buying this for the first time, I will remember to only drink this on the right occasion, for fear that the other beer dudes think I'm drinking sangria. To my surprise, this marzen poured blood orange...how cool. Although it is fruity in apperance, you do not pick that up on the nose or in the flavor...how cool. Its actually really hard to pick up the smell so I had to get down so close i got some foam on my nose. Its kind of funny how the taste is nothing like what you expect but a good surprise none the less. Hoppier than most marzens. I graded this beer not just for what it is but what it stands for... Freakishness. This drink really throws the senses off as to leave you pondering all night, and its a great halloween beer for your party."
"Taste is overly hoppy for the style and mineraly to boot. I'm going to cut this review short. It is somewhat like grabbing the wrong glass and drinking orange juice when you expect milk. The OJ might be great, but convincing your senses of that after the fact is next to impossible. Suffice it to say that I won't be giving this one another go anytime soon. A big time disappointment. Boo."
"Pretty sweet but not as much or as watered down as I expected with a nice earthy floral hop presence that lingers throughout. Slightly roasted malt body with a bit of nut and fall spice. ABV wel masked. Not really a good interpretation of the style, rather it's just a goofy gimmick that isn't too terrible."
"Drinkability: Meh. This is a total gimic. It's not a bad lager, but I wouldn't buy it again."
"I get it, its a gimmick. The label comes out and says it. Its funny, 6.66% alcohol, ha ha ha. I get it."
"D: Didn't even want to finish what was in my tasting glass....I made sure to wash it out before drinking anything else...not a fan."
"Drinkability is ok. It goes down fairly easy but its not something I'd regularly drink. If your looking for a strange novelty beer than this would be the one for you."
"Drinkability: Too out there for me. I feel like the style was somewhat ignored. I wouldn't care for another, especially for the price."
"In retrospect if you like mineral water spiked with bitterness, like tonic water or italian bitters this is for you. Had to donate the rest of the 22oz bottle to someone else. From the label in this beer is a joke."
"The only freaky part of this beer is the appearance. And it is definitely not an octoberfest. Too bad that the flavor doesn't live up to the name given the beer. I would call this a freak-eye lager, which is an average beer."
"Drinkability; this was fun to open and get the ooh's and ah's from my buddy's, but after I finished it, and the excitement wore off, this was just a bad novelty beer."
"D=taste is good, not overwhelmingly sweet, drinkable though not quite sessionable."
"D: Tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, decent kick, decent representation of style, it might be freaky in appearance but aside from that the beer is just mediocre and there isn't much to it that makes the beer like an Oktoberfest. Overall, it's not a bad beer, but it's only worth drinking one or two for the novelty of it."
"I choked my way through a glass of this stuff and poured the rest of the bomber down the drain. This stuff is like """trick or treat""" and you just got TRICKED."
"I feel that this beer is more marketing than substance, that the red color, while a trademark of the product, is offputting, and that, on pretty much every other level, this is south of average in smell, taste, mouthfeel and drinkability than its counterparts from other breweries."
"Overall not a very drinkable lager, but certainly fun for a gimmick. Would like to pour this for unsuspecting guests on Halloween for a gag."
"Go out and buy one, just to see that freaky color, and crack it open after trick or treat"
"Overall: As I said before the beer messed with the taste buds based on its appearance so I'm not really sure. It wasn't bad but I'd like to try it again with my brain NOT knowing what it is beforehand."
"Pours a unique red color like a red soda with a thick foamy two finger head that gives way to very little lacing. The color is very nice, and i will give it that it is different and i like that. The color is crystal clear. The smell is of earthy hops with a little bit of a roasted malt and a caramel malt smell. The taste is of earth hops up front, the backbone is a caramel malt. The end has a nice sweet taste that is hidden in there maybe cherry or a nice sweet malt. The mouthfeel is a moderate carbonation. Overall you could drink a lot of this beers, this is a little more flavorful than most red lagers, it seemed like there was more of a hop character than others. Overall i think this is a solid beer, especially consdering the style which is usually boring. I would recommend trying this one for halloween."
"It'd be a fun beer for a Halloween party but maybe just for a glass."
"D - Ok...there are some haters out there for this beer but I have to say that it isn't bad and should be rated as a lager vs. a Marzen per the category this is placed in. I could definately have it again. Good offering by Shmaltz."
"Drinkability: Overall, I didn't hate it, but I didn't exactly love it either. I see this as a gimmicky beer at the most, and lacks really what a true amber lager should be. The color is off centered and different, and thats about it. Cool to say I have tried it, but I'll skip this offering from here on out."
"Appearance is wierd- very red, kind of looks like grenadine, but thinner with a small head and no lacing. Smell is very weak, not a lot here- faint caramel and a bit yeasty. Taste is a bit better- not really an Oktoberfest as mentioned on the label. Mouthfeel is decent, medium in body with a good amount of carbonation. Drinkability is alright."
"This isn't a horrible beer, but the concept of it seemed to come before the actually brewing of it."
"Pours a barely translucent, strongly red mahogany that is almost blood red. Aroma is richly spicy and slightly malty with just a hint of cherry. Spicy flavor has subtle cherry undertone and a woody hint. Texture is quite smooth and fairly fizzy and leaves a woody and spicy finish."
"WOW! This beer is red red red. I poured this from a 22oz. bomber and I found there to be a huge, bright pink, head. The head stuck around for a while but when it did start to go away it left quite a bit of lace on the glass. It boasts on the lable 6 malts, 6 hops, and 6.66% alcohol. I have no idea how they got this color from just grain but I like it. This is a very sweet beer but not oversweet. It has flavors of grass and licorice. the mouthfeel is very light. I am not a very big fan of oktoberfest beers but this one definetly changed my mind. It does say on the label """this is not an oktoberfest... this is freaktoberfest""" I would definetly get this again and would love to try one on tap."
"I enjoyed this beer as a novelty. The flavor was not the best for its style or even truly representative of an Octoberfest. However, what do you expect when a picture of a mad clown is centered on the label and the beer is brewed at 6.66% ABV. I would definitely enjoy to drink this on Halloween while watching some cheesy Ed Wood films or listening to some classic Misfits ... it's inspiring for that kind of mood."
"overall a very strange beer, not that bad just cant get past the color, also has a weird taste that i cant put my finger on."
"A strange beer to be sure with its outright bizarre and surprising color and non-aromatic scent, yet has a fun, lightly dancing array of fruity flavors that equal any easy drinking that would take place during warmer weather days."
"This beer is a crazy shade of blood red with almost a pink fuchsia hue. It has a lot of head that goes fast just to form so moderate lace. The aroma is malt but also like sweet berries. It has a bitter taste with some fruity hop esters. There are some grain tones. Not a bad beer with a lot of carbonation bite."
"D - This beer looks bad and tastes worse. Why would a seemingly legitimate microbrewery want to make a beer like this? It is awful and ends up as a drain pour, one of only two or three I have ever been forced to pour out. This should never have made it into a bottle."
"A headache sinks in & that is the end of that. :|"
"Nothing absolutely outstanding or mind-blowing, but easily drinkable. A bit of a novelty? Perhaps, but it is a solid beer and falls in nicely in its flavor profile with other Oktoberfest lagers, and would make a nice conversation piece at a Halloween party."
"Pours out of the bottle almost blood red and then settles to a rose amber red body in the glass. Head is well pink, soft and fluffy, very light pink but definitely pink. Leaves a crown of lace almost an inch high as it slowly fades. Nose is mineraly and slightly nutty with some soft malt in the background. Enters the mouth with some scattered hops that are quickly balanced by some woodsy mineral based malt. Really stays more on the skunky side although mellow German style of the brew. Slightly bitter on the back of the tongue but yet consistently filled with a soft sweetness. Mouthfeel is very smooth and turns almost creamy thick as you drink. Very nicely drinkable."
"Maybe someone out there likes what Shmaltz Brewing hath wrought, who knows? As a less than well-brewed Oktoberfest, Freaktoberfest will set you back somewhere in the vicinity of $6.19. As a joke beer on Halloween... priceless!"
"Holy Shit it's fake Blood Red! I guess i should have expected that. The body is clear plenty of carbonation and a fluffy pink head. Great Lacing. You get an inital aroma of fruit, witch develops more in to dates and rasberrys. There's a bit of citric hops and grapefruit rind as well. Although a bit Kitchy this beer is fun and the flavors don't hurt eather."
"Strange to look at, but not a bad drinker."
"D - Good. Surprised it has a C+ average. Slightly over hopped for a lager, but drinks more like an ale."
"Not sure what this is, but the malt/hops balance is good, and the profiles of each are a little different from the norm, and it feels great, so I'm down. Yeah, it's a novelty (the color, the crazy label, the 6.66 ABV), but so what, it's kind of fun."
"7/3/7/3/13 (3.3/5)"
"D, notes: A fine beer but nothing really special - besides the color antics related to Halloween. I found this pretty sessionable though."
"D: After a fairly good start appearance and aroma wise, the beer seems to slide downhill after that with a mediocre flavor and mouthful with an limited appeal and repeatability factor. Worthy a curious peek at best but highly unlikely to draw you back."
"The blood-red color does take some getting used to. It is best just not to look at the beer while you are drinking it. Does taste like an average lager, with a funky twist. Thin mouthfeel, slightly sweet and syrupy. After it warms, it yields a burnt aftertaste - and not in a good way."
"D- An entertaining beer if I have ever had one. If I did not see this beer before I drank it, I wouldn't have thought much of it. But it's a looker."
"Anyway, I had fun with this beer, and I guess that's what they're after. Coney island is a weird place, and this is a weird beer, and it fits right in. It's freaky, to be sure, and I like it!"
"Poured this beer into my pint glass and was surprised by raspberry-esque color and the two inch pinkish head to match. And for me it kind of went down hill from there. Not much in the nose and a bag full of plain in the taste. Mouthfeel and drinkability were both low. Not a pleasant beer from a brewery that I typically do like. This one played out like a typical lager that was dyed a funky color for some reason."
"D: Good. Once you're past the novelty of a bright red-colored beer, this is a decent lager - a little on the heavy side. A pint would be fine; the 22 oz. is plenty. Haven't seen this on the shelves for a few weeks (since the arrival of winter seasonals) and not sure if I'd buy it again if it returns next fall. Worth a try, at least for the sake of curiosity."
"This is a freaky good beer."
"Taste: Malty, sweet and slighty sour. After it warms, I pick up the red dye aftertaste. Not the most unpleasant but worthy of a try."
"Well I guess the worst part of this beer is the look but I can't really knock that since too much since it is more of a gimmick that's done for the Halloween season. Other than that, I found this to be a fairly tasty, crisp, and easy drinking affair. Not bad."
"D - The sad, sad thing is that you can tell that underneath the stupid purple color and the horrid fruit punch flavor there is actually a solid well built beer. I mean, you can tell from the mouthfeel and hoppy dry finish that the fruit has ruined what could have been a good beer. Its like seeing a toothless meth-addicted streetwalker and being able to imagine the pretty, young, happy, and successful girl she would have been if she had stayed away from that shit."
"D - I guess you could have more than one, but isn't really a session beer. Wasn't great, wasn't horrible, but definately different. Cool lokking bottle though."
"D: OK, but clearly a beer that big malts and abv would limit."
"22oz bottle with no visible freshness info, pours pomegranate blood orange red, with a pink 1/2""" foam head, that does not stick around very long. But does leave some very fine lacing. Minor nose of orange peel and some earthy mustiness. Smooth and pretty tasty, notes of rye, fresh fruits and a decent malty finish. Shocking looking, decent drinking. Good Halloween party choice...otherwise I likely would pass it by"
"Drinkability- Different for sure and possibly worth trying if you like your lagers hoppy. Novelty beer that was fun to try."
"The taste shines through a bit more, with pale grainy malts and slightly citric to grassy hops in a nice balance that finishes fairly crisp. Just a subtle sweetness in the start that fades to a crisp bitterness and a very slight musty after taste. Medium bodied lager with the alcohol well masked, an interesting easy to drink brew that truly looks like some kinda fruit punch. Cool stuff."
"Drinkability: Not the best oughta the Shmaltz bag."
"color- otherwise, not a bad little lager."
"Overall I probably will never purchase this again. It had an odd taste all the way through and wasn't that enjoyable."
"22oz bomber into a half liter mug pours a bright almost blood red with almost no head. Aroma is some sweet malts and slight caramel. The taste was certainly more along the lines of an Amber than an Oktoberfest, but was still somewhat enjoyable. The beer was crisp and smooth with decent carbonation. This is no doubt a gimmick beer, but even with that being said, I guess I would possibly try it again next year."
"We bought this for the nostalgia of halloween, but probably won't buy it again."
"D-Once a year on halloween I could see having one"
"Drinkability: Overall, this is a very fun beer to share with friends and family. It goes beyond the norm and isn't that part of letting your freak flag fly? I'd recommend this beer to anyone that likes Red or Amber Lagers and I'd recommend this beer to anyone that just needs a damn change. Pick this up if you can and try it for yourself!"
"Drinkability is not good. This beer does not have a ton of taste or anything. Slightly strange, don't really know where they are going with this beer. Not worth a try."
"An interesting or """freaky""" take indeed. It is kinda tasty, and I'm glad I tried it, but I won't be seeking it out in the future by any means."
"D - This is a pretty good brew. The color was amusing and unsettling at the same time."
"In the end, I have to say I really liked this one. I found it to be a welcome change to what I have found around lately. An interesting take, a kind of a hybrid style. This one was something I would definitely want to get a hold of again."
"The bitterness overpowers any potential fruit or hops that might be present. This one puts really puts the red into red lager. I wonder if I'll pee orange later..."
"Full mouthfeel with a bubbly, tingly finish. Below average drinkability, I couldn't finish the bomber and endure the medicinal flavor."
"My friend described this beer as wine mixed with beer. Maybe that's harsh. But this beer is even so a real novelty. No point trying it unless you've got no other choice."
"As others have said this is definitely more a red ale than an Oktoberfest. I'm also not a fan of dyed beer- just another adjunct, and one that serves no purpose and contributes a bit of an acrid taste. Pours bright red with a pink head and leaves some lacing. Smells malty and a bit grainy with a strangely fruity and acrid overlay. Perhaps rhubarb? Tastes of that fruity acrid bitterness. Typical red dye flavor, and that ruins the rest of it for me. Couldn't finish this."
"Overall- Average at best, being red and pink with a 6.66% abv I think this is more of a gimick beer. Pick up a bomber for novelty sake, its tolerable."
"Picked this up because the word octoberfest was in there somewhere. Pours a clear dye job red with pink head and clumps of lacing. It looks like one of those malternative+caffeine """beers.""" Smell: luckily it smells like it should: sweet malts... caramel, munich or something similar. Taste: upfront there is an astringent medicinal nastiness. Malts underneath, but it's hard to get to them. Threw it back into the fridge, a little better colder, but still too much medicinal taste for me...and a little too much alcohol present for the <7% abv."
"Decent level of drinkability considering your'e drinking a blood-red substance..."
"D- I am not a huge fan of the taste of this beer. It has an odd aftertaste and the alcohol sticks out far too much for a beer under 7% ABV. Interesting concept for a holiday themed beer, but they need to go back to the drawing board on the flavor."
"Wow, this beer pours a blood red color with lots of visible carbonation and a small pink head, not usually my thing, but im digging this. The nose on the other hand is that of machine funk and stale grain, not funky, but stale and dried. Slightly roasted but semi-sweet malts and bread are dominant in flavor, spicy hops attempt a rounding balance. A gym-socky funk lingers through out. Make sure you drink this guy COLD, as it warms it gets, eh difficult. There is no """red""" flavor, there is no cherry flavor, dont let the appearance contort your judgement on this one, i drank most of it with my eyes closed because i was trying to pull apart the few lager subtleties when my brain was just thinking RED every time i'd inspect the beer. As far as the concept goes, perfectly executed. As far as the beer goes, eh, its nothing to write home about but i would totally buy it again just to see the look on a friends face."
"The drink is full-bodied and creamy with a light fluffy nature. A great amber/red lager with an unfortunate name that makes drinkers think of Oktoberfest, lederhosen, and Marzen, when clearly, this just isn't a beer representing that style. Exceptionally smooth with good drinkability."
"D - it's as good as any other macro beer being served at most Halloween party's, but this beer is blood red, man!"
"The aroma is average, fairly hoppy and malty, not bad. The flavor recalls Sam Adams more than anything else I can think of--the clor makes you think there should be fruit but there is not, it is a crisp, decent, average malty amber lager. For the record, I like this better than Sam Adams, it's not a bad beer, but this style is ceratinly not one of my favorites. I definitely give these guys credit for taking the idea of an artificially colored beer and just going there. A must-have for the next time you are dressed as a vampire."
"D: very nice and odd brew, and well worth a try if you can find it."
"Seriously, dye in your beer is stupid. Come on people. Other then that, it's a slightly above middling brew. Don't rush out and find this one, but if it comes to you, it won't totally make you sad. But the dye . . . such a stupid concept, we are not 5 years old."
"Drinkability: I really liked this beer. If you're having a Halloween party this year, this is the beer to serve. It's awesome looking, and has a great Autumn taste. I'm a big fan of red lager, and if you are too, I suggest you try this """freaky""" beer before Dracula drinks it all."
"The flavor starts off with an artificial overly sweet maltiness that is not brought into balance. Even the malt profile lacks any subtleties; such as a pleasant toasted, or biscuit quality. This is a beer that is disjointed, and mediocre at best. There are too many good beers out there for me to waste my time on this one again..."
"Coney Island Freaktoberfest pours a dark red with a pink tinged head from a brown twenty two ounce bottle. The aroma is malty and citrusy, leaning toward grapefruit. The flavor is pretty malty, the hops are definitely noticeable though. There's a fair amount of bitterness toward the end, once again it's a touch citrusy, with grapefruit being what comes to mind. I'm a big fan of IPA's that have grapefruit tastes from the hops, but this isn't really quite the same, probably because the malt bill is completely different. The hop flavor becomes dominant as the beer warms. Not bad, I think it could be a bit better balanced."
"Found this one in a random store I usually don't visit and had to pick it up based on name alone. Not much of a description on the bottle so I wasn't sure what I was getting into. The most interesting part is that the beer pours a dark red and sports a almost pink head. Big malt and brisket smell comes off with a touch of hops. More of the same on the first sip, big malt flavor with not much hops going on. Pretty good but nothing to amazing. Still a fun beer to drink around October and I'd pick it up again."
"D: The ending flavour certainly lowers the drinkablity for me, I'll try to finish the bottle, but it won't be easy. Next time I see it, skip. I've enjoyed the other Shmaltz beers I've had to this point, so I was surprised at how poor this one ended up being. Drain pour."
"Not a great beer, the color's the best thing about it. Love the old school logos and sayings on it and the abv is 6.66."
"I love the fact that this beer doesn't smell or taste the way it looks."
"Try it just to have the appearance - flavor incongruence experience. Beyond that, I'm not sure if this is something that stands out, per se. Nonetheless, I do appreciate the fact that Shmaltz is challenging not just taste buds but the perception of what a beer should be."
"Not a very exciting beer, color aside. But pretty drinkable despite the nagging feeling that I might have a stomach ache later on. There is a wierd flavor in the background I can't identify, and I wonder what it has to do with the color. Could it be blood? That would be freaky."
"The color doesn't detract at all from the flavor, and the beer ends up being quite tasty, far more tasty than some notes may suggest. I'd highly suggest picking some of this up. It's a well crafted beer and will be quite fun at a costume party when everyone freaks out. And I'm going to keep recommending it at the store."
"Poured a clinging, two-finger head that looked like it had an orange body. Some floral hops and light malts in the smell. Medium-bodied with some smoothness, and to me at least a good citric hop bite. Mild caramel and roasted malt notes make for a well-mixed beer that is pleasant to drink, although there is minor alcohol burn. Not a bad beer at all."
"Bizare, artificial, red color with a pink head that has good retention. Pink lacing is left on the glass surface. Light grainy aroma. The flavor is unimpressive as well. Mild maltiness is about the only thing I can come up with in describing this beer. Lighter body with a somewhat harsh carbonation. I would not drink this one again. Between the weird appearance and bland flavor makes this average."
"All this crazy fanfare on the bottle and what's inside? Let's just say the most exciting part is the appearance. I'm not sure if they intended for this to be an Oktoberfest or not, but...it's not."
"Not bad. Not extravagant but enjoyable. I would appreciate a bigger nose for sure."
"I poured this strange beer into my tumbler at 50 degrees and freaked out at the red color. Pretty wild but I think that for some reason makes it hard to judge the beer as it seems like it should taste like cherrys or something. However it does not. The beer had a red head that was nive, and weird. It was sweet smelling and had a rather malty taste to it like a fall beer should have. I would buy again."
"Pours a cranberry red color with a small dense pink head. Looks to me what raspberry soda would look like. I guess they were going with the freak factor. The aroma is rather faint, some buttery malt and a touch of stale hops. The taste is of a doughy malt, a bit buttery, with some bitter hop bite in the end. Very much like a munich helles or an light ended Oktoberfest. The brew has a moderate body with plenty of fizzy carbonation, a bit chewy, finishes with a bitter twang. The beer drinks fine, seems to be in the mold of an Oktoberfest. I like the name fine but could do without the red food coloring. Definitely throws people off. I noticed the ABV, 6.66%, very evil."
"D: The sample should have been enough to decide I am not a fan of this one. Wish I had passed on the pint."
"This is easy to drink once you get past the whack red food coloring. Enjoyable and mellow."
"The first thing I noticed about this beer, as other reviewers have stated, is the freakishly red color. It's almost disturbing. I thought it would be red like a Killian's Red, for example, but this stuff was nearly the same color as my wife's cranberry juice. The pink-hued head was a tad unsettling as well. I expected my first sip to taste like a) blood, b) cranberry juice, or c) something big and bold, but it was actually d) none of the above. It just tasted average, with a less than average mouth feel. Definitely not what I was expecting. If it was sold in 12 oz bottles, and could add it as a single in mix pack, I likely would, just for the sheer novelty of that color, but not in a bomber again."
"A unique beer that I will never try again unless drastic changes are made. Can't ever finish the bottle. What a waste of money."
" A very drinkable lager, thanks to Shmaltz for this seasonal offering."
"Drinks easy enough, this is a little too weird for me. More so the late showing up to party, amber profile, vice the crazy colors"
"Okay, first of all, it's RED. Had this at Dive Bar on 96th St during the craft beer fest (though I was not on the crawl). Did I mention that it's red? It's the end of September and I'm thinking, """Oh, here is a play on a Maerzen.""" Not quite. In fact, not at all. It didn't remind me of an Oktoberfest at all. Apparently, Freaktoberfest is just freaky with out the fest. Hops and Alcohol on the front of both the nose and the tongue. Reminded me more of a malt beverage (e.g. cooler) than a beer."
"Mediocre lager with a smile-producing look. Buy some for a joke or Halloween, but DON'T expect this to be as good as the rest of the Schmaltz beers."
"22oz. bomber served in a pilsner glass. Poured an unnatural looking deep red with a finger of pink head. Fairly hoppy aroma, with a little fruit and a fair amount of caramel malt. Nice malty base. Medium bodied with a smooth mouthfeel. Bit of a hop bite. I didn't taste any red fruit, so the color must be artificial. Kind of fun to drink, but nothing earth shattering. I wouldn't call it an Oktoberfest."
"Purchased: Plaza Liquors, Tucson AZ"
"Rather bizarre beer, indeed; certainly a Halloween novelty. Poured red. That's RED, like Red40 cherry soda dye red. I'd like to know how they achieved this. The colour is very, well, off-putting. Not that it's disturbing or anything, it just isn't """normal""" to see a beer that looks like this, and my brain and tongue had a rather challenging time making the correlation. The smell was very modest and only after agitating what was left in the bomber that wouldn't fit into the pint glass on the first go-'round, was I able to detect anything worth mentioning. Even at that, it was only a mild sense of lightly toasted cereals and a tiny bit of fresh fruit. The taste really surprised me in that there was an imediate hop bitterness (okay, it was moderate at best, but hey, there were hops there!) followed by a mild mat character, then the hops again. Don't misunderstand what I'm trying to say here. There are scores and scores of better beers out there. The point I'm trying to make it this: The smell and appearance had me highly doubtful of there being any quality in the flavour of this beer. To my surprise, it was much better than I was expecting. I'm certainly glad I tried this one out, but I don't know if I'll purchase it again. Bizarre to say the least."
"Drinkability: I don't think they wanted it to be this way. Glad I got a bottle. Not as bad as everyone makes it out to be."
"Overall it was a good beer to SEE and not one i would go after again."
"D. Too much boozy taste but definitely a treat to try!! I definitely wouldn't seek it out, but a good experience."
"D-pretty easy drink, wouldnt buy it again, maybe if i wanted to show someone the color. had much better."
"The shocking red appearance was enough to make me yell """what the hell is this", but that was nothing compared to the pink foam forming above the body. Alright, now that I was done with this part of the review, I could turn off the lights so that I could get myself to drink this. The smell was not quite as weird as the looks, but the cooked vegetable matter hidden under the hops made this somewhat unappealing in that regard as well. The taste was a decent blend of hops and malts, but felt a little bland. The aftertaste was initially metallic, but improved as the beer warmed up. The beer felt pretty good in the mouth with a medium thick but sticky palette. This did not turn out to be the drain pour that I was afraid it might be, after I first laid my eyes on it."
" It makes me feel dumb for having drunk it, let alone paying $6 for the bottle. How about putting a real beer in here, fellas?"
"Note to Shmaltz brewers: If you're going to make an off the wall red-40 beer, at least make something worth drinking. Dank!"
"Listen up Shmaltz... the next time I see a beer this color from you, it had better be from the pomegranates . So disappointed..."
"Not good, I would pass on this with the highlight being the nifty label."
"Not bad. I'll try it again and I praise the Shmaltz guys for trying something new with the color."
"Drinkability. Tough to call. This may go down the drain. I have a 1pt 6oz bottle only a quarter the way down."
"B+ for originality, C for execution."
"I dunno, if I approached it as """any beer""" would I be as harsh? Probably, actually. But especially if it is trying to claim to be an Oktoberfest style beer, and the name does make that claim. So the drinker is let down on two accounts: 1) it is an average-at-best beer and 2) it most certainly isn't a maerzen."
