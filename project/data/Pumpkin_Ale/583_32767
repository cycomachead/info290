The spices are great and really build as I was drinking. Despite the richness, this beer somehow managed not to be too heavy or cloying.","kellyej","Sep 20, 2014"

First taste, medium body with a nice malt, pumpkin pie taste, that finish a little dry at the end. Probably because of the 8.0 % ALC.

Nose was very sweet and spicy and since they were going for pumpkin pie, I would say that they hit the mark! The label mentioned """cinnamon, nutmeg and clove""" and I was having a tough time discerning one form another. Mouthfeel was slightly viscous, syrupy and this was one of the sweetest pumpkin beers that I can remember drinking. It seemed dangerously close to diabetic shock in a bottle. Each successive sip was unrelenting in terms of its sweetness and I was feeling kind of overwhelmed. The finish was (finally) both spicy and sweet, but if I have railed against unbalanced in terms of spices, here was unbalanced in terms of malty sweetness. Whew!

The nose is a rum-like mix of spices and booze, caramelized sugar, and some gourdy undertones. The taste transcends the beer's nose and appearance bringing potent pie spices to the forefront, big pumpkin sweetness, and hint of bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel is medium, sweet bodied, slightly booze, so spiced that it's gritty, but also with an elegant gourd presence, great drinkability, and has a mildly biting, bitter finish. I do enjoy this beer and think it's refined enough to do well at the dinner table, but would likely not be my go-to beer out at a bar.","ThePorterSorter","Nov 19, 2013"

Poured from an unassuming looking brown bottle with a yellow and orange label into a Bulleit bourbon glass. Pours deep orange with a light yellowed head of foam that disappears before too long. Aroma is very discernible cinnamon, nutmeg and clove, heavy on cinnamon, and cola. Excellent flavor, again heavy on cinnamon, but thoughtfully balanced against the other spices. Sweet and malty, certainly """pumpkin pie""" like, as they say. Mouthfeel is medium, light carbonation, and the alcohol leaves a light tingle on the tongue. If you chew it a little the alcohol really separates out from the other flavors and you realize what you're actually drinking, which is a pretty high abv brew that is not playing around as much as the seasonal flavors suggest! Overall this did not disappoint, certainly one of the best pumpkin ales I've been able to try. Pretty masterful.","BeerWizard","Sep 30, 2013"

Just a hint of pumpkin detected. The best way to describe the taste is to compare it to warm pumpkin pie. The pumpkin that was almost undetectable in the nose come through beautifully on the palate, balancing the spice perfectly. Some alcohol warming. Finishes slightly sweet.

4.24,0.7,4,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Bottle: Poured a deep dark cloudy amber color ale with a medium size foamy head with OK retention. Aroma of nutmeg, pumpkin and cinnamon with sweet malt backbone is quite enjoyable. Taste is a nice mix between some nutmeg, cinnamon and pumpkin with lightly sweet malt backbone. All flavours are very well balanced with sweetness offsetting some of the spices so that nothing gets out of hand. Body is quite full with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Very well brewed with great level of complexity while retaining good marks for drinkability.","Phyl21ca","Jul 02, 2013"

The flavor is primarily pumpkin pie spices and brown sugar and the pumpkin flavor itself is a little buried in the mix. This is one of the better-tasting pumpkin beers out there in that it avoids being too sweet but still brings a pretty accurate pumpkin pie flavors. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied and maybe a little on the thin side without enough carbonation. I'm not the biggest pumpkin beer fan, but this is one of the better ones.

Hey Schlafly, people actually like to drink Pumpkin Ales on Halloween which is in late October. Heck, a lot of people like them through Thanksgiving. Disappointing that Schlafly has caved to seasonal creep that they are ceasing their Pumpkin in late September, but whatever.

This is THE best fall seasonal brew hands down in my opinion. ST Pumpking doesn’t stand a chance against this one and neither does DFH Punkin.

It has a lot of the same spices, but the cloves take over a bit for me. It also does not have the same biscuit notes which I really enjoy.

4.35,3.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"The beer pours out a deep orange/brown in color with a rocky head which dissipates into brilliant lacing on the glass. The aroma off this beer is tremendous - with a strong (but not off-putting) pop of cinnamon and low notes of the pumpkin squash and nutmeg. The taste of the beer is of pumpkin pie up front, but it finishes with a dry pumpkin spice characteristic. Schlafly has dialed back a bit of the clove over the past two years and, for me, it's left a great smelling and tasting beer that really showcases the pumpkin and cinnamon spice. You wouldn't know it from the taste, but remember this is an 8% beer. Schlafly offers a boldness and spice worth seeking out.","jmvecchio1","Oct 10, 2011"

The color of the beer is a deep rich mahogany, it's darker color tells me what is in store. Mouth feel is perfect for the style, it's not light at all, its got just enough carbonation and is worth taking your time on. The taste is exceptional. This is easily the best Pumpkin Ale I have had. It's hearty, strong, and tasty. There is less """spice""" presence and more pumpkin. It tastes like a pumpkin ale, and not a spiced ale, as almost every other brewery out there produces. I almost hate saying this, but yes, it tastes more like pumpkin pie than anything else I've had. Be careful here. This beer is good, and the high ABV can sneak up on you.

This is what I imagine a pumpkin pie beer to smell like. It pours quite dark copper color and not much head. When held up to the light, it has a beautiful vibrant dark red color. I was shocked to find it to be 8% ABV (the spices hid that so well). The carbonation on the beer was adequate and it had a lingering effect on the taste buds that I can appreciate. Overall, I am very happy with how the beer smells and tastes, but the look is nothing outstanding. Compared to other pumpkin beers, this is among my favorites so far.","agirlandherpen","Sep 28, 2011"

3.08,-26.8,4,3.5,2.5,3,3.5,"Overall - Still not my favorite pumpkin beer, but it is decent. I feel that I have to grade it as a specialty/novelty brew, and as such, it does do fairly well. But, to repeat myself, the spice is the issue here. This could be a great pumpkin brew, with a hefty portion of pumpkin rind and that toasted pumpkin seed quality balanced with the malt. The pumpkin pie angle just gives it too much winter spice for me to thoroughly enjoy, for what it is.","paperbackfoster","Sep 23, 2011"

3.76,-10.7,4,3,4,4,4,"O: A good beer that I'm only knocking down a notch for the almost sickeningly sweet aroma that almost scared me away. I could not drink more than two of these because that pumpkin pie spice wears out the palate eventually.","klaybie","Sep 19, 2011"

Instead I have to say Southern Tier’s pumking was far far better this year. I feel like the malt is just not there and the spices are a touch stronger than in the past and with these beers those two elements have to be just right or the whole things falls apart. I wonder if this is a result of this beer being a touch inconsistent and me just getting a batch that didn’t get it right. That said still a good example of the style. If you enjoy these flavors it is great. If however you want the beer to meld together, I feel that something went a touch wrong with this bottle and maybe this year’s batch is just a hair off.

Big and chewy malts like molasses and brown sugar, with plenty of toastiness and pumpkin goodness. The spicy notes are stronger on the palate than the nose. Tastes like an extremely sweet pumpkin pie with a well-browned crust. Usually pumpkin ales that are this literal annoy me, but this beer has a hefty body and an emphasis on malt complexity that other members of its style lack.

3.99,-5.2,3,4,4,3.5,4.5,"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is an amber-orange color with an almost non-existent head. Nose is definitely what you might expect from a pumpkin ale, all spice with some malty caramel sweetness. Cinnamon and all spice and cloves dominate. The flavor is more of the same, almost reminds me more of apple pie than pumpkin. Initial malty caramel sweetness followed by a spicy finish. Mouthfeel is a light medium body with minimal carbonation and a drying finish. Overall a drinkable beer, some alcohol is noticeable but I would not guess it is 8%. Probably as good as a pumpkin beer can be.","gmfessen","Mar 01, 2011"

It's like drinking a liquid pumpkin pie, right down to the crust. Clear pumpkin flavor up front followed by nutmeg, cinnamon, and clove. Pie crust malt sweetness and powdered sugar finishes.

The pumpkin and cinnamon are upfront followed by the nutmeg, maltiness, and other spices. It is a little sweet but more alcoholic than most pumpkin beers.

Smooth and easy to drink, the sweet caramel and nutmeg spice are clearly evident but perhaps the only drawback of this beer to me is that the spices and clove are laid on a little thick and dominate the finish, giving off a slighly sour hop feel which is a drag considering the nice balance the pumpkin/sweetness and spices have up front.

It gives you enough time to appreciate the appearance and smell the beer properly before tilting it back. It's a nice orange reddish color with a little bit of bubbling action. Schlafly's Pumpkin Ale may have the best smell of any pumpkin beer I've ever had. All of the spices are intense, the cinnamon, nutmeg and clove work in a perplexingly good culmination of flavors and scents. I walked around my house and put the beer under my roommate's noses and then slow on the cue I'd exclaim, """Smell.""" (As if they had a choice then.) I'm beginning a new thing of wanting the scent of beers made into candles, this is one such beer. But then comes the taste. I'm torn on this one like I'm Michael Bay's plot structure. Instead of the dichotomy of racism and explosions (Bay), it's my love for pumpkin beer and this beer too much of a pumpkin. The taste hits your senses in the face like it's Chris Brown. My immediate reaction was, 'whoa I love this beer' and then I thought, 'ow.' It's just too much at once. I love pumpkin beers, but there's just too much spice action in this one - so much so that it kills my enjoyment of the beer. I cringe every time I take a drink; it's just so sweet.

The price is phenomenal for the 8% ABV and amount of beer (DFH's Punkin Ale is $10 for 4 while this is $10 for 6). The color is a dark amber/copper hue that has a nice yet subtle translucency to it. The head is a nice beige that recedes to a thin lace around the edge of the glass. The first sip is a fusion of a good ale and a great pumpkin pie. The nutmeg, cinnamon and pumpkin dominate your mouth and challenge you to find a more delectable flavored beer. I rate the drinkability as average because of the loss of flavor with every beer. I suggest waiting between beers, possibly drinking something else, rather than pouring one after another. I cannot wait to bring a sixer of this to thanksgiving.","burchetts","Sep 10, 2008"

3.97,-5.7,4,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Pours a rather intense burnt orange color with reddish highlights in the glass. The thick collar of foam rises well above the rim and is colored a pale off-white with the slightest orange hue. Active carbonation can be seen rising from the bottom of the glassware, feeding the massive head of foam. The nose is heavily spiced - cinnamon abounds, followed by cloves, allspice, nutmeg and a pleasant, caramel malty sweetness taking up the rear. This beer is the liquid summation of the word """festive.""" The palate doesn't disappoint in this regard either. Bursting forth with aggressive spices and warm, slightly roasted malt characteristics, this is like a baked pumpkin pie in a glass. The cinnamon is the dominant spice in this one. Perhaps because the spices are so heavy in the nose and on the palate, the alcohol is scarcely detectable though this beer weighs in at 8% ABV. Once you get past the spices, a solid well-crafted amber ale is waiting to greet you - slightly sweet, roasted malts and a complimentary hop profile leave this beer tasting surprisingly balanced for such a big, spice-heavy beer. The mouth feel is medium thick, but not too much so. The carbonation level is ample enough to keep this one from being perceived as too heavy or malt rich. Nice trick. The finish is smooth and warm, with a lingering spicy note or two hanging around. All in all, this is and has been one of my favorite pumpkin ales of all time. I am a spice head, so the aggressive levels of spice found here are not a negative for me, but some may find them too intense. While I could easily drink a few of these at a sitting, the well-hidden alcohol content prohibits that notion. This is a beer I'll stock up on and have on hand through winter's chill. Perhaps I'll even squirrel away one or two bottles and see what a year or two in the cellar does to the flavor profile - at *% ABV, this one should be able to handle it okay.

This beer does all this-- doesn't seem too difficult. This beer seems to have a very firm Amber malt toastiness, sweetness, cleanliness, and crispness. The low (but detectable) hop rates make way for the pumpkin and spice variety to shine. The pumpkin delivers a creamy, earthy flavor very similar to fresh-baked pumpkin pie. Mild notes of cinnamon, nutmeg, and all-spice decorate the beer without bringing undue attention to the frills. A mild buttery flavor also brings the beer into desert-range. This is all evedent in the aromas and flavors. The body remains firm, creamy, and relatively round; allowing the flavors to settle into a mellow finish of creamy-sweet pumpkin and caramel.

I would definately reccomend this as one to try! Too bad this is only around for a short time.","Tuey13","Oct 03, 2006"

3.58,-15,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Pours a clear light amber color with a tan head of large bubbles. Nice balance of pumpkin pie spice in the nose. Nutmeg takes the lead. Taste is immediately dry and spicy. A bit overdone on the nutmeg and cinnamon. Alcohol presence is readily noticeable. Medium body. Ginger makes an appearance in the aftertaste along with more cinnamon. Maybe its still to warm for this one. I wasnt ready for the alcohol warming just yet. Still, an ok, drinkable pumpkin ale. Thanks H-O-P!","sacfly","Sep 21, 2006"
4.21,0,3.5,5,4.5,3,3.5,"This beer would be perfect right after Thanksgiving dinner. At 8%, though, it would definitely be naptime. I could see myself drinking 2 of these, probably not more than that though.","hobbes2150","Sep 19, 2006"

4.12,-2.1,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Clear orange-amber. A sizzling, quick building head of loose packed off-white bubbles of mixed sizes. Settles at a constant pace to a thin skim coat with a short collar and leaving no lacing. A single jetting carbonation stream rises. Aromas of liquefied pumpkin pie abound- cinnamon, nutmeg, a touch of cloves and a bit of crust malt. The label reads that ginger is included and there perhaps just a hint of its zing. Up front is some malt that is reminiscent of baked crust followed by rich pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg and a warming alcohol note. It is almost as if I am eating a piece of pie backwards, starting with the crust and ending with the point, the best part. The finish is cinnamon and a touch of spicy ginger. This is a nice medium-full bodied beer with a warming alcohol edge. Smooth, rich, and creamy like a piece of homemade pie. Nice overall and definitely on the maltier/richer side balanced with plenty of spices. Schlafly did this one right and for right now it is one of my favorite pumpkin ales.","hopsaplenty","0"
3.77,-10.5,4,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Poured by one of my St. Louis Brews buddies at 8th annual Hop in the City fest. I was given a generous portion. Very nice appearance. The second sample of the fest that followed a Randalized APA rolled out by brewmaster Stephen Hale. Following the five pound blast of cascades that the APA filtered through - the pumpkin spice flavors seen quite tame but the underlying malt flavors, carbonation and finish were satisfying. After a little rinse to clear the palate the flavor of pumkin came through better. I found the spicing a little over done. For me the test of this style is how well it holds up over the entire bottle. I had the O'Fallon last week and found it a beats Schlafly this year but both are well above average.","karst","Beers"
4.17,-1,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"I had this on tap at lunch yesterday, but this first review is for the bottled version. Dark copper to amber color, very clear and topped by a fizzy off white head. The head dissipated quickly. This beer is about 8% ABV, so Im not surprised the head recedes quickly. Wow, great pumpkin pie smell. Loads of spice, cinnamon, nutmeg, and whats that? Pumpkin! It really comes across in the nose. Nice malty backbone too. The room fills with the aroma. The flavor dances in your mouth the nutmeg and cinnamon comes first, but the pumpkin shines through. What is a pumpkin ale without a nice ale base, and this beer does not disappoint. Wonderful dark caramel malt finish. The pumpkin and spice character lingers long after the drink blending nicely with a bit of alcohol. Big, full mouth feel. Great drinkability. This beer really is nice, and shines up there with other great pumpkin beers Ive had from Watch City and Smuttynose.","carln26","0"
