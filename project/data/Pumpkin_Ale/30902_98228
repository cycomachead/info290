For the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays, and then going forward into the colder months, I occasionally enjoy a spiced beer with my meal, followed by a Barleywine after dinner as I relax - and this beer combines both of those into one! Well worth trying!","NeroFiddled","Feb 14, 2015"
4.03,1.8,4.25,3.75,4,4.25,4.25,"Amber to copper in color with a touch of head.  Smells a bit like raw squash with background (all)spice.  Taste is dominated by allspice, nutmeg, maybe cinnamon with background squash flavor and a lite sweetness.  Carbonation is lighter with a medium  body.  Overall a different take on a pumpkin and worth a try.","Slack","Feb 09, 2015"

4.04,2,4,4.25,4,3.75,4," The taste is good with light spice up front with more of a fruity yeast flavor and subtle maple type fruity earthiness with sweet element and light spice mid palate. The taste carries a subtle vanilla-like earthiness which also comes off sweet with mild floral aspect. The maple taste comes through as a sweet woody taste with alcohol adding a dry quality to the finish without tasting hot. This is a very good beer, nicely flavored with pleasant spice profile and moderate sweetness that works well with moderately high level of alcohol for the sake of complexity yet still drinkable for the strength","Slatetank","Oct 14, 2014"

Ahoy, me lovely, I said as I watched the dense, creamy two fingers of tawny head slowly fall into the surf. Color was a hazy orangish-amber (SRM = > 17, < 22). I am not a fan of filtration, so cloudy and hazy are okay by me in most beers. Nose had the usual suspects - cinnamon, clove and nutmeg, but not in overwhelming quantities. We may get along, lasses. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full, not quite creamy, but close. The flavor was semi-sweet with the maple syrup getting a fair shake, but not overtaking the spices, which was my fear before opening it. The potential for cloying sweetness existed, but the brewer held fast. Properly moored alongside in Siamese-fashion, I settled in as the wench proffered pancakes with butter and syrup and a hit off of her bottle of rum. Yo, ho ho! Warming, I began to sense a bit of alcohol heat, reminding me to be aware of its ABV. It finished with a warm semi-sweetness, very evocative of pumpkin pie. I kissed the mistress, requested permission to go ashore and headed off on my next (mis)adventure.","woodychandler","Beers"

There is a hint of something different, which would be the butternut squash, that adds just enough difference to separate this pumpkin beer from the next.
