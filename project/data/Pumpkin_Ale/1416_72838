Taste is a boozy pumpkin pie with notes of vanilla, spice, and some bitters. Mouthful is a bit oily but light to medium with medium carbonation.  Overall one of my favorite pumpkin beers.","Slack","Mar 27, 2015"

The nose is a complex blend of spices including cinnamon, nutmeg, black pepper, clove, along with hints of molasses, vanilla, and subtle dark fruits.  The taste is extremely rich and bold with the barrel aging really coming through.  Hints of cinnamon, maple, toffee, nutmeg, clove, oak, vanilla, booze, white pepper, and caramel.  The mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation and a boozey, dry, oaky finish.  Overall, this is one big and boozey pumpkin beer.  The barrel aging dominates, and it's extremely rich, making it a sipper for sure.  It was a bit boozey for me so I'm going to put the other bottle I have in the cellar and see what happens.","beerdrifter","Dec 24, 2014"

This was again the case - even flavors all around - the spices, the pumpkin and oak barrels. A dark brown color, with very little opacity. Feels nice - a perfect amount of carbonation with a very light head. It's late in the season, however, I can say this is my favorite pumpkin beer, especially at 10.31%. Snag it if you have the chance or try it next fall.","Antg8989","Dec 20, 2014"

Kind of full bodied, maybe a little too much carbonation, seems like there's a little CO2 burn.   Overall, good brew, might be better with a little age on it.","BradC","Nov 12, 2014"

The color is a deep dark slightly brooding caramelly amber...  A light to moderate bit of rapid paced carbonation streaks throughout...  Some carbonation bubbles cling to the sides of the glass...  The oak and wood notes are at the forefront of the aroma without being overpowering...  Some light pumpkin and baked squash notes linger beneath the surface and add nice depth and complexity...  Somewhat one dimensional in terms of aroma, but very pleasant and enticing...  The trend continues on the palate where the oak aging is again at the forefront...  Way beneath the surface are some pumpkin mash notes and light caramel /toffee notes...  There is a distinct booziness that lingers about as well...  Some very light vanilla notes as well...  Lots of depth and complexity is present but it is somewhat obscured by the oak and wood notes...  The mouthfeel is medium bodied and sturdy...  Assertive throughout with some spry carbonation...  Nice and smooth...  Overall a very nice beer even if the pumpkin notes get obscured a bit throughout...

Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is nice, the brew smells mostly like pumpkin and pumpkin spices, along with some light vanilla and oak. It tastes like pumpkin spices (cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice), pumpkin, vanilla, oak, and a bit of booze and butterscotch. It's not an overspiced pumpkin beer, so in this case it helps the brew. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's chewy and coating with a good amount of carbonation. I think it's a good pumpkin ale, I'd try it again in the future. $11.99 a bottle.","bluejacket74","Dec 01, 2013"

After the blast of heaping pumpkin, there is a spice blend build that cuts all the rich layers to provide some levity. The palate actually lightens rapidly after all that initial massiveness, leading into a mostly balanced sweet, rich, and spicy pumpkin bread aftertaste, with booze and vanilla overtones. The body is robust, slick, and heavy. Slick, lingering spice finish. This beer is massive.","GarthDanielson","Nov 20, 2013"

I liked how smooth the beer is, how heavy the pumpkin and other spices come into play and the sweetness I get on some sips. The only thing with this beer is at times the alcohol really came into play and I don't think the booziness mixed well with the pumpkin spices or the sweetness so at times it was disjointed.","clayrock81","Oct 31, 2013"

I guess I don't like it as much as I wanted to, but it's not bad at all and I can totally appreciate it and see the appeal. It is complex too. I probably should've let this one age a bit.

Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of huge caramel, toffee, pumpkin, cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, toast, brown sugar, gingerbread, oak, vanilla, bourbon, light chocolate, light roast, and toasted earthiness. Incredible aromas with great balance and complexity of malt, spice, pumpkin, and barrel notes; with great strength. Taste of big caramel, toffee, pumpkin, cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, toast, brown sugar, gingerbread, oak, bourbon, vanilla, chocolate, and toasted earthiness. Lingering notes of caramel, toffee, pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, toast, brown sugar, gingerbread, oak, bourbon, vanilla, light chocolate, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity of malt, pumpkin, spice, and barrel flavors; with a near perfect balance of all flavors and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a moderately creamy, slick, and slightly syrupy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic barrel aged pumpkin ale!

Light astringence in the mouth, but that fades after a few minutes of sitting. Well balanced, not overpowering in the spice notes like so many pumpkin ales.

The flavor profile brings in some vanilla to support the maple in laying down a sweet base. The pumpkin spices show up well in the back end, and they're complemented nicely by some earthy, spicy oak notes. The mouthfeel is spot on. The body is firmly middle of the road for such a big beer, neither as full as a stout or barleywine, nor as dry as a strong Belgian ale, and the carbonation has just a little bit of zip to it. I've found that brewing a high ABV pumpkin ale is a bit of a challenge in terms of keeping both the sweetness and the spice character in check, and with the aid of oak aging, Uinta does an admirable job here.","axeman9182","Nov 18, 2012"

The spicing, while initially a bit disjointed and shocking, ended up melting away into the background to provide a nice supporting role. This is easily the heftiest pumpkin beer I've ever had.

Bottle opens with a solid pop, indicative of a good level of carbonation. Beer pours a brilliant, clear but dark, orangish-brown with a fingers width head that is very effervescent and quick fading. The nose is very eloquent indeed. Very spicy with clove, nutmeg, a tad bit of cinnamon. As with moth pumpkin beers, I don't really pick up any pumpkin. The taste is where it's at. This has a heavy, yet still wonderfully balanced spice profile with all of the aforementioned players coming to the forefront once again. I wish the barrel treatment was a little more evident, and wonder what could have been with bourbon barrels. Surprisingly, the alcohol isn't very pronounced in the taste, but it rears it's head in the mouthfeel providing a bit of a hot finish. The spice of this beer lingers on your palate for a decent length of time too. Over all, not bad at all. This is a very decent take on a pumpkin beer from Uinta. I may not necessarily seek this out again, as pumpkin beers generally aren't my forte, but I wouldn't snicker at someone if they offered it. I'd extend my glass at arms length.

Reminded me a lot of the great higher ABV pumpkin ales out there, like Weyerbacher Imperial Pumpkin and Hoppin' Frog Double Hollow Pumpkin, but there was no really no added oak complexity from the barrels. A really good beer but a let down overall and not worth seeking out in my opinion just because there is more readily available, better bang for the buck Imperial Pumpkin ales on the market.","claspada","Nov 14, 2011"

4.1,3.5,4,4,4,4,4.5," Honestly, I've never experienced pumpkin in a beer quite like I have with this one- it really is unique. Whereas most pumpkin beers tend to be an amber with pumpkin spice, this is a real pumpkin beer. Though a little pricey, this is definietly a beer that fits the season and is worth trying once, if for nothing else, than to see how pumpkin can be represented in a beer both in terms of flavor and texture.","Ghenna","Oct 10, 2011"
4.08,3,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"O: Uinta's Oak Jacked Imperial Pumpkin easily ranks near the top of the pumpkin beer echelon. Nary a brash or overdone spice is to be found, and the wood adds a really inviting complexity to the beer which is perfect for a chilly autumn evening. If you're a fan of the style, I highly recommend checking this one out. This is what I'd call a grown-up's pumpkin ale.","Rhettroactive","Oct 09, 2011"
4,1,4,4,4,4,4,"Bready and spicy palate. Pie crust, caramel and molasses, a touch of -bal that doesn't overwhelm the base beer. The spices thankfully don't, either; it's surprisingly well balanced. Cinnamon is pronounced, along with nutmeg and clove, but they don't provide much astringency as is often the case with these spiced pumpkin ales. Surprisingly good on the whole, and better as it warms.","largadeer","Oct 07, 2011"

Not a whole lot else on the nose. The taste is incredible. Very little oak comes to play, and what is there really amps up the flavor of the pumpkin. I'm not getting much spice on the palette but rather a very strong, very creamy pumpkin flavor. Hands down best pumpkin only flavor I've gotten out of this style. Slight hints at maple, vanilla and cinnamon/clove...but pumpkin is all center stage. Creamy in the mouth, fizz plays well. Great pumpkin beer...a pleasant surprise.","Preismj","Oct 06, 2011"

Smell is of sweet malt, pumpkin pie spices, vanilla, and some wood notes. Taste is of sweet malt and pumpkin puree up front while the various spices and slight vanilla flavor coming in on the finish. The spices add a sight earthy bitterness that lingers on the palate after each sip. I am not really getting any of the oak flavors in the taste though. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good pumpkin ale with a nice balance of all the flavors. The smell is not as good as the taste but this is still a worthy beer to pick up for the season. Interesting to see that the ABV is at 10.31% (Halloween). I am not too sure how they can get it so exact.","UCLABrewN84","Sep 25, 2011"

3.53,-10.9,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Part two of two in my Utahn pumpkin beer mini-fete. The little cousin was pretty nice, so this one has some lofty expectations to live up to. It pours a clear sunset tawny-amber topped by over a finger of dirty pale cream-white foam. The nose comprises buttery biscuits, light caramel, light nutmeg, rye bread, oak, light clove, and a few drops of mandarin orange syrup. The taste holds notes of lightly toasted rye bread, charred oak, caramel, mandarin orange, nutmeg, brown sugar, toasted pumpkin seeds, light booze, and a dripping of maple syrup. The body is a sleek medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a lightly syrupy feel. Overall, this did not live up to the expectations preceding it. The spices have been mostly muted, the alcohol makes itself far too known, the oak seems to be a bit on the blackened side, and the balance that held Punk'n so well has disappeared in his relative here.
