Aromas of huge pumpkin flesh, pumpkin seed, cinnamon, gingerbread, nutmeg, toast, caramel, brown sugar, clove, allspice, pie crust, herbal, and toasted earthiness. Absolutely insane aromas with incredible complexity and balance of pumpkin, malt, and spice notes; with great strength. Taste of big pumpkin flesh, pumpkin seed, cinnamon, gingerbread, nutmeg, clove, allspice, toast, caramel, brown sugar, pie crust, herbal, and toasted earthiness. Lingering notes of pumpkin, pumpkin seed, cinnamon, gingerbread, pie crust, nutmeg, clove, allspice, caramel, brown sugar, herbal, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of pumpkin, malt, and spice flavors; with big authentic pumpkin presence and fantastic malt/spice balance; and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a smooth and lightly slick/syrupy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an absolutely insane imperial pumpkin ale. All around amazing complexity, robustness, and balance of malt/pumpkin/spice flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A world class pumpkin ale for sure.","superspak","Nov 15, 2013"

Kind of remeniscent of my childhood Orange Crush vice, just a little more rustic looking. Smells delicious, cinnamon, nutmeg, gingerbread, cola, cherry, and pumpkin. No alcohol on the nose at all. Pumpkin flavor is heavier in the taste, but I think the flavor is really well balanced overall, just a nice mosaic of spices and fruit. Sweet, bitter on the back end, and nice mouthfeel. Carbonation is perfectly appropriate for an 8% abv, and the mouthfeel is slick and not as heavy as you might think. Best imperial pumpkin I've ever had.","BeerWizard","Beers"

Nice fresh pumpkin taste that is at just the right intensity. Augmented by the aforementioned nutmeg, vanilla, and cinnamon flavors. Think pumpkin pie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. The 8% abv is hardly noticeable in the taste. Mouthfeel is smooth and silky with just the right amount of carbonation to keep things from tasting too syrupy.

4.56,10.4,3.5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"I discovered The Pumpkin King in Elysian's Pumpkin Patch four-pack. The Pumpkin King pours a slightly cloudy copper gold, one might even call it pumpkin orange. Like a lot of pumpkin ales that I've tried, it pours with very little head, so pour vigorously if you prefer some foam. The smell is strong pumpkin, pumpkin spices, and hops... exactly what I want a pumpkin beer to smell like. The flavor is surprisingly light on the spices, hidden behind the malts and hops, though they are still there in the form of background notes which I think adds to the perception of complexity in the flavor. The Great Pumpkin is definitely more nuanced than other "beat you over a head with one spice or another" pumpkin ales that are a lot of fun to drink but not what I would describe as particularly delicious. At 8% ABV there is a distinct medicinal taste on the back end, although this is not unexpected and therefore not concerning, to me at least. Of course what defines a pumpkin ale is the actual pumpkin itself, and I'm happy to say that the pumpkin flavor is front and center. It helped to rest my pallet for a few minutes before dipping in for a few more sips so that I could experience the full pumpkin flavor over and over. Unlike a lot of pumpkin beers that I've tried, the pumpkin flavor was fresh and not too vegetablely. I think that the additional hops in the imperial style compliments the pumpkin flavor greatly, not only to mask some of the strong spice notes, but the floral and citrus flavors from the hops genuinely compliment the pumpkin. Imperial is the way to go for pumpkin ales, in my opinion. I highly recommend this beer as it is #1 on my list of pumpkin ales, for now at least.","OktoberfestMunichSurvior","Oct 01, 2012"

Also, the spiced inclusion is enough to let you know it is there and then some. However, it does not cross over into the territory of being ridiculous and too much. For an 8% brew, it sure is imperial and the alcohol is not hiding. Is it a good pumpkin beer? Yeah, it certainly is among the best bottled varieties. Is it THE best? No, Selinsgrove destroys this in overall blended flavor, drinkability and enjoyment. If you want to taste raw pumpkin with a boost of alcohol, this is the beer to go for.

It's slightly better than Night Owl, which I opened next to it but I couldn't review because it didn't hold up. Night Owl, Great Pumpkin, and eventually world domination. Elysian is the master of this style.","HopHead84","Jan 17, 2011"
4.67,13.1,4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Overall: A perfectly balanced beer. Spices and pumpkin are prominent, but not overpowering. Somehow manages to not be cloying throughout the entire glass. 9","AleEvangelist","Oct 31, 2010"

4.28,3.6,5,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,"Maybe you pretend it is the skull of your vanquished enemies. Either way, it has been spiced correctly, you drink to victory. It does finish a little sweet, the only drawback to an otherwise outstanding beer.","dragonWhale","0"
4.12,-0.2,4,4.5,4,4,4,"While most pumpkin beers focus on spices and end up tasting like cinnamon or allspice dissolved in an unhopped ale, this beer tastes like pumpkin. A lot like pumpkin. There is some cinnamon in there but its not overpowering, restrained, this is actually a good beer overall. Shocking. I'd even drink this again.","drabmuh","Oct 15, 2010"
4.03,-2.4,4,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Pours a nice orange color with a bit of a white head. The aroma is fairly faint, but tends to focus on actual pumpkin flavors as opposed to an overload of spices. The taste confirms this, as there is some nice, sweet pumpkin and a bit of malt. Mild spicing in the background. Feel is nice and creamy with lower levels of carbonation. Drinks really well. I've been wanting to try this for awhile now; a solid pumpkin beer.","Thorpe429","Oct 02, 2010"

4.42,7,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Overall, this is definitely one of the best pumpkin ales out there. If you are a fan of pumpkin beers this is an absolute must try. Don't be fooled by the relative mediocrity of night owl bottles (though its ok on tap). The Great Pumpkin is definitely where elysian's holiday spirit shines. Fantastic beer.","AKBelgianBeast","Nov 04, 2009"

4.72,14.3,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,5,"Overall very solid indeed. Going by the nose one of the biggest seasonal I have yet to run across, just a wonderful example of the style that was very well received by all.","mikesgroove","Oct 02, 2009"
4.42,7,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Sample at Alan's HSC initation. Bottle from Elysian in Seattle. This beer is a clear copper/orange color with a thin light beige head that dissipates steadily. Rings of lacing on the glass. Nice pumpkin pie aroma with notes of cinnamon and nutmeg. Medium-bodied with pumpkin flavor at the forefront, backed up by sweet malt, nutmeg and cinnamon. The finish is spiced pumpkin goodness that lingers awhile. Very enjoyable overall.","Dogbrick","Oct 02, 2009"
4.39,6.3,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Drinkability: A splendid finish to a fine evening. The Great Pumpkin is a wonderful pumpkin ale and one I recommended, provided you're a fan of the style.","ChainGangGuy","Oct 02, 2009"

4.24,2.7,3.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,"D - Pretty high, but it does get to be a bit much eventually. I mean you can only have so much pumpkin pie, right?","nickd717","Jun 26, 2009"
4.11,-0.5,3,4.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,"Ok, the aroma is a lot pumpkin pie. Brown sugar, llightly toasted bread, spices and a bit of orange. Tastes pretty darn close to pumpkin pie, too. The spice hits first then the brown sugar comes into play along with baked pumpkin. Representing the crust of a pie is the yeasty breadiness along with roasted malt. This is quite an experience. However, as it warms, it loses it's spice in the front and the pumpkin fades within the yeast and malt. Could use a bit more kick to it all the way through.","Mebuzzard","Dec 27, 2008"

4.29,3.9,4,5,4,4.5,4,"Thanks to wagenvolks for the share, 22oz bomber into 2 Brooklyn tulips. Pours a crisp orange with a thin diminishing head. The aroma is a huge amount of pumpkin spice with caramel malts right behind. The taste is more of the same, pumpkin spice is more predominate than in many other pumpkin ales, but still not over the top, the malts tend to shine through more in the finish, but the spices linger as well. The beer is fairly light and crisp with decent refreshing carbonation. This is certainly a very respectable pumpkin ale, one I would try again if given the opportunity.","atsprings","Jun 29, 2008"
4.34,5.1,4,5,4,4,4.5,"The flavor starts off bold and full of pumpkin pie notes, while a delicate lactic sweetness quickly gives way to a spicy booze onslaught. The aftertaste is a bit too massive, as tongue-lashing sweet and sour spices override the more delicate pumpkin front. Mouthfeel is creamy, but the body is a bit thick and syrupy to be a sessionable October brew (especially when you live in the Carolinas!). However, this was certainly an interesting craft beer experience, and easily the "greatest" Pumpkin Ale I've tried.","wagenvolks","Dec 10, 2007"
4.77,15.5,4,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Poured a nice orangish with a quickly disappating head. The nose was pumpkin and spicey. Taste was pumpkin, nutmeg, spices and cinnamon. The nutmeg and cinnamon give it an extra kick and zing at the end. Mouthfeel was exceptional. This beer is very well balanced. The ABV seems light. The ABV and pumpkin taste was a bit more prominent on tap.","barleywinefiend","Sep 26, 2007"
4.5,9,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Had this at the pumpkin festival at the Elysian in Capitol Hill. As the original reviewer noted, this is their Imperial Pumpkin- and a great beer it is. Probably my all time favorite pumpkin ale, and it is bottled too! Abv is 8.1% in 2007, and the beer is brewed with real pumpkin, roasted pumpkin seeds, and the malts are: pale, crystal 45, Munich, Cara-hell, and Cara-red. Spiced with cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and allspice in conditioning, and bittered with Magnum hops. Starting gravity 18.5 degrees plato. Pours a dark orange/amber with a creamy head and good lacing. Smells rich and sweet with notes of brown sugar and pumpkin pie spices. Tastes of creamy pumpkin, brown sugar, spice and fresh cream. Rich and full mouthfeel with a creamy finish. This is utterly delicious.","Georgiabeer","Oct 29, 2006"
4.05,-1.9,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,4,"[ADDENDUM] - After trying a carefully saved bottle this September I cannot recommend it more. Aged almost 1 year, the beer was fantastically spicy but smooth with a gloriously velvety mouthfeel. Buy a few bottles this year and stick a few in the cellar. Awesome!","TheName","Oct 29, 2006"
4.44,7.5,4,5,4.5,4,4,"Purchased a 22 at the brewery on Capitol Hill and served it in a pint glass at home. Appears orangish amber and a little cloudy with particulates. The beer poured with a thick ivory head and smelled of green apple and sugary pear directly after the pour, melding quickly into a strong, fresh pumpkin pie and spice cake. WOW! Smells like fall. Mouthfeel is substantial, a little syrupy, and good for the style. The taste was dominated by the spices of pumpkin pie: brown sugar, nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves. As it warms, the alcohol comes through. There is some hop bitterness in this beer toward the end, though mostly hidden up front by all the spice and caramelly malt. A strong beer, but it is still drinkable because it just tastes so good! Definately an excellent fall beer but one that will overwhelm your tastebuds after a few. Another great seasonal from the Elysian!","jletts","Oct 24, 2006"
4.39,6.3,3.5,4.5,4.5,5,4,"Definitely, my favorite pumpkin brew to date...I have never been overwhelmed by the style, but this one is the real deal.","warriorsoul","Beers"
4.8,16.2,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"This is the Elysian Brewery's Imperial Pumpkin Ale. Yes the moniker fits because this is a brew fit for royalty. I seem to remember the ABV being something like 7.7 but I'm not certain. Anyway the body is is like autumn hued crystal ... perfectly transparent yet a crisp orange color. Head is a dense carpet of creamy foam. Oddly, you can't see any of the carbonation but you can feel it once you take a sip. Nose is big on nutmeg and cinnamon and yes of course, pumpkin. Flavors are much the same but this is certainly the beer that has done the best job of blending them. Pumpkin is thankfully big on the finish. I'd honestly say that this is the best Pumpkin Ale I've had ... previously it was Elysian's other Pumpkin Ale, Night Owl. Also, despite the ABV the alcohol is completely hidden. Probably would work like a charm as a dessert beer. This should become a very sought after beer ... I'm already hoping they brew it again next year.","TheBungyo","0"
