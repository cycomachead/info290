"O: great pumpkin beer but to much cinnamon I drank 12 oz bottle poured in a goblet"

"Not good.  Needs more pumpkin and cowbell."

"Overall:  This is an excellent pumpkin ale!  Great balance between the malt, sweetness, spices and the pumpkin.  Absolutely delicious!  I’m definitely getting some more of this next year!"
"Imperial Pumpkin Ale brewed by Weyerbacher Brewing Co. This brew has an 8.00% ABV. The pour on this brew is a nice cloudy, deep, amber color, with a small off white head.  Imperial Pumpkin Ale smell is rich with pumpkin and spices. You also pick up on some grains and malts in the smell  of this brew. The taste is bold with flavor of pumpkin and spices. This brew puts you in the mind of a pumpkin pie. The mouthfeel is bold, rich and full of flavor. There is nothing overpowering in this brew, it has a nice balance to it.  This brew goes down smooth. Overall I'm giving this brew a 4.5 out of 5. Weyerbacher Brewing Co. did a nice job with this brew.  I would buy this brew again."

" Overall I'll give Imperial Pumpkin Ale - Weyerbacher Brewing Co. a 4.5 Imperial Pumpkin Ale - Weyerbacher Brewing Co. This has been one of the most enjoyable pumpkin brews I've had the pleasure to drink and review. I will certainly buy this again!"
"One of the better pumpkin ales out there. Good representation of the style."
""
""
"I have been flagged as an outlier... It looks like I should really not be rating pumpkin ales as even a highly regarded one such as this tastes like a rotten starbucks latte to me."
"Just late in the season for it. Carbonation isn't there. Still has a good front and nose on it tho. Lots of cinnamon and nutmeg"
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Weyerbacher makes an excellent Imperial Pumpkin.  Smooth, complex, and tasty."
""
""
""
""
""
"Right off the bat I get that cinnamon and nutmeg aroma. Pour out a nice inch & 1/2 head. Nice sunburst color to it. Light body but with a heavier Finnish. I get a lot of the malt flavors as well which may be also from the cardamom, Definitely get that ginger taste from it. Very good pumpkin ale just easy on them since they are 8%"

"Not a fan. Way too sweet; way too much seasoning. I don't mind flavor in beer, such as spice, but this one was awash with sweetness, clove, cinnamon, and cardamon. The aroma alone rivals that of a pumpkin spice candle. If you really, really enjoy pumpkin ales, I would recommend this beer, because it has 3x the flavor of your average pumpkin ale."

"Great fall beer"
""
""
""

"Certainly better than your average pumpkin ale. Not overly spiced, but still possessing some depth and nuance. Nice notes of pumpkin, vanilla, cinnamon and caramel. Doesn't hide it's booze well though - that's the biggest strike against it. Similar in style to Schlafly's pumpkin ale, just a little less refined."

"Pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg, and clove form the aroma. There's substantial brown sugar sweetness. Flavor reveals ginger at the base, which lingers throughout. Caramel malt sweetness and pumpkin form the backbone, with cinnamon and clove accenting the profile. There's a hint of squash tang, along with cola notes, which are offputting. Good amount of sweetness, for my palate."
"O:  Not as creamy or carbonated as I hoped it would be.  The sour start is a turnoff.  Not bad, but I've had much better."

"A very """real""" pumpkin beer. Would def. try it again."
""

""
""

"Pours a clear dark reddish brown with a small tan head.  Aromas are extremely literal on the pumpkin spice: big notes of cloves and nutmeg dominate, with brown sugary sweetness.  Extremely sweet like pumpkin pie on the palate, very smooth body with a spicy (think red hots and cinnamon) mid-palate.  Finishes on notes similar to some of the cinnamon whiskeys that are currently in vogue.  An excellent choice if you like pumpkin ales that take the pumpkin pie challenge at face value."

"I finally decided to give Weyerbacher's Imperial Pumpkin a try and I'm sure glad I bought a single instead of a four pack. All spices with no concession to the pumpkin or base beer. This was a one and done for me."
""
"Lots of pumpkin and a somewhat unique spice profile, with cardamom added to the usual mix of cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves. But, that's not enough to take this beer to the top. It's a big beer, but a bit too big for its britches. The alcohol is hard to miss in this brew, a shame since I've had a few """imperial""" pumpkin ales that specialize in hiding the alcohol and accentuating the pumpkin or spice characteristics. Not a bad choice, and one I'd like to try again, but one that I don't think makes it to the top of my list of pumpkin brews."
"I repeat rDev's review.. just loved this perfect pumpkin ale!  The picture is wrong though.. that must be a prior season..."

"I love this beer! I guess I am nostalgic about it. It taste exactly like my mothers pumpkin pie! It has just the right spice level its hardy, it's got a slightly thick mouth feel but not muddy more velvety. At 8.5 it's got a little heat to it as well. This beer is fall and will be my autumn go to ale for the season."

"O: Exceptional.  The pumpkin beer for people who hate pumpkin beers--meaning, the pumpkin beer for folks who usually find them too spiced, too sweet, etc.  A study in balance, and the only pumpkin ale I can stomach to have more than one in a sitting (not an easy feet, and at 8%!)."

""

"Overall: Pretty good ale. I'd like the pumpkin flavor to be a bit more obvious, but otherwise is a great beer. The cinnamon is a bit TOO upfront and over powering the pumpkin."
"A little on the sweet side, but overall a passable pumpkin ale."
""
""
""
""
""
"Very nice pumpkin ale. The appearance is a dark mahogany color with a khaki tan head that traces the glass. The smell is full of pumpkin and spice like nutmeg and cinnamon. The taste is straightforward with pumpkin and almost a sour taste that compliments the sweetness of all the pie spices. Very nice. The mouthfeel also had good consistency and I would definitely pick this one up again."

"Pours orange and a,most opaque except for a haze that let light in and made this beer a bit of pastel. Nose is ginger, bright ginger and nutmeg. Not too much cinnamon and thank goodness for that. bit of allspice and clove and lastly cinnamon. This beer has the bitter scent of the actual pumpkin on it via touch of grass from hops. Lovely. Weyerbacher has deliiverd quite the abv in this beer. 8% to warm a bit as it finishes. But first. A bold pumpkin flavor with a bit of sourness or of twang if you will . Like the pumpkin and like the pumpkin pie. It has a dry crust for malt. Dry, floury and not too sweet. So a biscuit malt. Lightly over the top is a touch of bright honey to go with he bright ginger and now I am really excited. No diacetyl except in the mouthfeel. A bit of buttery sensation adds to this creamy beer with a decent bitterdespite it’s abv. A touch of hop grass and bitter finish this one like a surprise and WOW a great Imperial pumpkin ale from wyerbacher that tastes like an ale and has a great abv to kick it home."
""
""
""
"I really love the aroma of this beer. I was hit with cinnamon, spice, nutmeg and pumpkin pie all layered perfectly. In my opinion, the taste itself doesn't fully live up to it's aroma. It still is pleasant but is a little bit overpowered with spice and nutmeg. Also, I feel the beer isn't as focused on displaying pumpkin flavor. My first taste I got very strong notes of all its other elements, cinnamon, nutmeg, etc.. It just took me a little while to pick out where I found the pumpkin flavor. Don't get me wrong, its a good beer, just not exactly what I prefer."

"I just poured my first bottle of this and the smell was wonderful. My taste buds were looking forward to enjoying what my nose already had. Boy, something wrong here! It has a nice mouthfeel but that's about where things go south. Sour mash like taste with a cinnamon follow. Almost like this batch had too much nutmeg or the bottle was bad. Opened a second one with the same results. Really sour with an almost harsh nutmeg aftertaste. I really don't think I'll buy this one again after drinking so many other pumpkin beers this fall that have proved far more enjoyable than this."

"A good pumpkin beer, but still inferior to Southern Tier's sweeter Pumking."

"Overall - This beer could be perfect, but for me it is overly spiced. I love all the fall and pumpkin pie spices, but they need to be complimented by actual pumpkin flavors. Also would prefer slightly less carbonation. One of my better options for the season, but if I'm strictly basing my review on what I'd like in a perfect pumpkin beer...I need more pumpkin. 3.7"

"Overall this is probably the best pumpkin ale I've ever had, and pumpkin ale is probably my beer style. I let this beer sit in my fridge for a two or so months, not in the mood to do a review. I look forward to next year, when I will by this beer by the case!"

"Pours dark amber with orange/red tints. Light foaming. Thin ring. Pumpkin/nutmeg nose. Sweet smelling. But a sour taste, pumpkin back. Rich and chewy, but can't escape the sour. Did I get a bad bottle? If not, this is odd. Just Ok, I had hoped for better. Will give another try next season."

"Overall: The first sip is appealing, but the finish is just so harsh that this is difficult to keep drinking. This is one that (to me) isn't worth the calories."
"O - so this is two years old. I had some from the same batch last year and it was probably perfect at that age. two years is too much. back then this would've been my favorite pumpkin ale, but something has seemed to change with most of the 2013 weyerbacher releases. not as flavorful, overall drop in complexity. they tasted rushed this year."
""
"Pours a hazy orange/amber in color with a 1/2-finger tan head that doesn't last long. Some spotting lacing is seen. The aroma is very pleasing and strong and is of pumpkin and spices. The taste is actually even better and is very tasty with LOTS of pumpkin and spice flavor. Perfect carbonation. No harsh or bad aftertaste either. This is one of my favorite pumpkin ales."
""
"Overall, I was a little disappointed. The mouthfeel is quite weak and I feel the beer lacks complexity. There are many better pumpkin beers out there."
""
""
""
"To be honest, I'm usually not a fan of anything pumpkin... bread, pie, and especially beer. However, this was a pleasant 12 oz experience that I would like to repeat. It was a tasty transition from Thanksgiving to Christmas. This reminds me a lot of a delicious holiday homebrew a friend of mine made a few years back."

""

"On the whole, a solid Pumpkin Ale. If I get another one I will age it for a while."
"This is a very bad beer. I have always wanted to try this and now I can say I have. I don't review often but I just felt compelled to state what a bad beer this was. It poured a nice pumpkin color with a very nice white head. The smell was very nice. I thought I was about to get into something yummy... similar to schlafly's pumpkin.... that nice pumpkin pie, caramelly sweet and chewy goodness. Then the taste. Hmmmm... Defnite pumpkin pie spice - too much for sure. And the base beer... it was as if someone made a poor representation of an amber that was too weak and thin, decided to sour it, gave up after a week and then added pumpkin pie spice. There's also an underlying nasty bitterness that is not good but at least distracts from the rest of the nastiness. Drain pour and then to the Ten Fidy that's on deck."

""
""

"UPDATE: While its not sour'ed out like that last one I had, but Its kinda fallen off for me in the past few years. Mild alcohol burn, plenty of spice, more on the dry side too."
""
""
"Overall: I had pretty high expectations for this beer, and I have to say I feel pretty let down. In my opinion a pumpkin beer needs pumpkin flavor, not just spice, and this just doesn't have it. Tastes more like an amber ale with a boatload of pumpkin pie spice."
""
""
""
""
"Dark brown in appearance and turns red when held up to the light. It smells great -- like a classic pumpkin pie with ginger and clove. The beer doesn't live up to the smell, though. It has a thin, watery mouthfeel and a big spicy profile of clove, nutmeg, and ginger that overpowers the pumpkin flavor."
"O- Spicy, but decent. It's got some good flavors.The spice is just a little overwhelming."
""
""
""
""
""
" Maple Mistress is supposed to be an imperial pumpkin ale, but tastes like a maple ale. Don't know where the pumpkin is in it."
"Overall- A smooth drinking brew. The high abv sets this beer toward the top of the pumpkin ale list in that regard, and makes it an interesting pick. I think perhaps this could be improved however if it were brewed with a bit more pumpkin to cover up that fact of the high abv. When drinking it, you sure know it is 8%. I did enjoy it as my first Weyerbacher brew and would like to check out their other offerings."

"This seemed to be a worthy rival to Schlafly but the boozy taste and feel ruined it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"How it used to be!"
""
""
"I like it, but I wouldn't go out and buy another. I'm not dissatisfied, but it makes me wish for Pumking..."
""
""
""
"It's not a bad beer. It's just a run-of-the-mill pumpkin beer that happens to be 8% ABV."
"Conclusion: Luckily, the high alcohol content of this beer made me forget what I disliked about it until I opened another later. It does have a decent pumpkin taste when you get past the strong, fruity and spiciness of it, it simply lacks in every aspect but the fact that it'll knock you on your ass."
""
""
""
"Poured a nice seared pumpkin color, brilliant clearness in the light, with a white head that quickly diminishes to trails of white. The nose is heavy on the cinnamon, but clove and nutmeg is also found in the bouquet. More of a nuttiness than caramel or sugar here, although a nice sweet gingerbread undertone comes out as it warms. Very smooth, although I wouldn't mind a touch more body. Overall, a very well made beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, one of the more revolting beers I have had yet. The mouthwash nose is overpowering, the taste is neither subtle nor nuanced. I detect no pumpkin, only very loud cinnamon and clove with some underlying malts. I hope never to have it again."
""
""
""
"O- This is in my top five list of pumpkin ales. The Weyerbacker Imperial Pumpkin surely lives up to the credit it's been given. If I were to drink only one pumpkin beer, I just might choose this one. It has a nice aroma, it's very drinkable, complex and tasty. Grab a four pack of this while you still can!"
""
""
""
""
"O: I am not crazy about pumpkin beers in general so this should be taken into account. However, I did enjoy this beer as i drank it. Lots of spice and sweet like a pumpkin pie. I may try this again before the season is over, but if I don't it wouldn't make me sad"
""
""
"Overall lots of nice flavors. Starts off sweet, gets a little bitter, gets a little sweet, and finishes dry. Pretty complex despite the watery body. Among the better pumpkin beers I've tried"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a solid example of a pumpkin ale. The flavors and spices are well balanced. It is very drinkable considering the ABV. I am left thinking this beer is missing something, but not sure what. Until I figure that out, I will enjoy this seasonal beauty. I recommend you do the same. Cheers."
""
"OVERALL: The flavors are dominated by clove, cinnamon, vegetal bitterness, and spice bitterness. Toast and caramel are quickly overpowered after a few sips. The lingering pumpkin taste is pleasant. The lingering vegetal bitterness, spice bitterness and alcohol are unpleasant. Each sip makes me less eager for another."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability: I gave this second chance in a few days and a year later. I like the brewer, they make a great imperial stout. They are hit or miss. This is a bit like a liquor or an after dinner beer / drink. It's the kind of beer in a craft pack that I try to give away."
""
"Overall: Definitely one of y favorite pumpkin ales. Like drinking pumpkin bread, with strong pumpkin and spice flavor and a balanced and thick mouthfeel. Absolutely stunning."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Sometimes beers give me this sense of a setting when I drink them. I know this is a pumpkin beer, but the heavy clove flavor gives me this feeling like I'm drinking some medieval beer in a castle. Overall I was on the fence with the beer. On the positive side, it smelled very good and had good spice flavor. On the negative, it felt very weak and seemed to have too much spice when compared to the weak body and lack of actual beer flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Very enjoyable beer, perhaps a bit too focused on the secondary flavors. Definitely a good seasonal drink. Would consider purchasing again."
""
"I remember loving this beer. This is not the beer I loved. Maybe I've changed. Maybe it changed. But it's just not gonna work out... :( bad batch??? Just doesn't really seem that pumpkiny at all."
""
""
""
"Always looking forward to the Pumpkin Beers. Did not pour this one , just drank from the bottle. So the nose was somewhat diminished. But still, there was no question about the amount of pumpkin spices in here. The taste followed the nose completely... Lots of fall spices, perhaps more than I like. This is what I have seen so far with most of the other pumpkin beers. This one did have the body to go along with the spices. It was not that carbonated and I was able to enjoy some real pumpkin."
"Overall - This is a terrific pumpkin offering that has all the pumpkin flavor yet still tastes like a beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"I've had other Pumpkin beers before like DogFish Heads Punkin Ale (Which is great) but this one had some truly perceivable pumpkin taste which (For me) seem to come up after a chug then nice deep breath emanating from just under the tongue, this taste like I imagine a Pumpkin Beer would in my mind, its sweet and strong but no Alcohol taste whatsoever a little bitter at the end but that serves well to counteract the sweetness well. its relatively malty and moderately heavy, overall quite enjoyable, of course the spices are well represented cinnamon, nutmeg, cardamom, I drank this straight from the bottle with the updated label art bottled 09.18.13 enjoyed on 09.21.13, quite a festive craft brew! would definitely partake again."

"O: This is an adult pumpkin beverage for sure. I really like the roast and the elevated alcohol that swarms around the spiced pumpkin base. The bitterness in the finish is a little to much but overall a well crafted brew. This is one of my favorite pumpkin beers so far."

"An exceptional pumpkin ale and would pair extremely well with pumpkin pie or bread."
""
""
""
""
""
"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 7/10/2013. Pours slightly hazy reddish copper color with a 1 finger fairly dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin lace cap that lingers. Slight spotty lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of pumpkin, brown sugar, toast, cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, brown bread, raisin, caramel, and herbal earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of malt, pumpkin, and spice notes; with good strength. Taste of big pumpkin, brown sugar, toast, cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, brown bread, raisin, caramel, and herbal earthiness. Lingering notes of brown sugar, toast, pumpkin, cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, caramel, brown bread, raisin, and herbal earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of malt, pumpkin, and spice notes; with a great balance of malt over the spices and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a slick and moderately creamy mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice imperial pumpkin ale. Nice balance and complexity of malt, pumpkin, and spice notes; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering."

""

"One glass to go please...Salud!"

"Overall - This is weak and not impressive. Too watery and lacks the big flavors that most pumpkin beers have. No balance, and alcohol comes too strong. No reason to drink this one again."
"O - With all of the pumpkin ales and beers out there today, this one definitely stands out with the elite of the crowd. It's subtle, yet overflowing with pumpkin, although I really wanted it to taste more like it smelled. A wonderful beer for the fall months!"
""
""
""
"Overall: Never know what to expect w/ appearance, but i'd think an ale especially a pumpkin would be lighter in color. The smell of this beer is the highlight, i really enjoy the spices and pumpkin, but the alcohol is noticeable by smell. Tastewise, this is better than last yr. More flavorful."

"Overall: This doesn't do much for me. There are a lot of pumpkin ales out there, and I know that being an imperial pumpkin ale this needs to be bold and strong, but it just doesn't quite have the balance that it needs to work around that alcohol. It's not a bad brew, but for the price it's not something I'll buy again."

"Pours a rusty orange with a small quickly fading beige head.aroma and Taste of sweet pumpkin spices,cinnamon, brow sugar, caramel malt, nutmeg and sweet alcohol esters with some mild bitterness. Palate is medium to full body, sweet and slightly bitter with moderate carbonation. Finishes with caramel malt, pumpkin pie spices, brown sugar and some sweet alcohol. Overall an interesting, unique flavored brew, not overly sweet, a good brew."

"My personal favorite of all of the pumpkin beers. This one has a great malt base as a baseline to the pumpkin and spices that go into every pumpkin beer. Imperial Pumpkin would seemingly be a great porter or stout if not for the added pumpkin and spice. This beer is what a pumpkin spice ale should be. The spice and pumpkin are just icing on the cake."

"Poured this Pumpkin Ale from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Poured a reddish amber color, produced a thin white head, poor retention and it left little lacing on the glass. The aroma consisted of heavy amounts of pumpkin spice and roasted pumpkin. Medium in body, there was a foundation of caramel malt, roasted pumpkin, clove, cinnamon, nutmeg, and alcohol. Flavorful ale, nicely spiced and well balanced."
"Overall: this is a pumpkin beer which is growing on me. I feel like the spicing is a little imbalanced and harsh in places, but for the most part this is a smooth and pleasing pumpkin experience."
""
"Overall: Very delicious pumpkin style beer. Thoroughly enjoyed this beer and will definitely recommend this beer to a friend and will have again. I really enjoyed the overall presence of the spices and balance of flavors and it also presented a nice mash of pumpkin."
""
"355ml bottle. Tumbler glass. Enjoyed on jan´13. Dark amber color headed by close & lasting crown. Aroma profile is great: intense cinnamon, nutmegs, clove, toasted malts & baked fruit. Herb, spiced, tea-like flavors & subtle increasing bitterness. Low to medium body. Soft carbonation. Oily to watery texture. Orange zest in the middle & astringent mouthfeel. Dry bitter finish. Easy drinkability."

"Heavy mouthfeel. Adequate carbonation."

"Poured into Half Acre snifter. The appearance is a deep murky amber with a orange hue, somewhat dark for a pumpkin beer, minimal head and no lacing. The nose is full of spices and fleshy pumpkin. The cinnamon and nutmeg are somewhat subdued, but the cardamom is pretty strong and seems slightly out of place for this beer. The taste is somewhat absent of sweetness and is full of spice. Mainly cinnamon and cardamom on the flavor, but it seems to come through more at the end. I am missing any malty backbone to hold up to all of the spices. A slight squashy/fleshy pumpkin character comes through but it doesn't add much character to the brew. Mouthfeel is moderate to heavy with a high level of carbonation. Overall, this is a pretty uninspired pumpkin beer. The ingredients are there, but they don't pop and there seems to be no malt backbone to elevate all of the flavors."

"This is a fun autumn beer, not much else to say."
"I did not think this was a great example of a pumpkin ale. Out of balance on the spices, seemed a bit confusing what it was supposed to be. Did not get any actual pumpkin flavor - more like a half-hearted pumpkin pie skimping on the squash. Thick and sweet, kind of clying on the palate with a long aftertaste. Would not look for again"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- this is what I think pumpkin ales should taste like, it's like comparing dark roast to light roast coffee compared to most other pumpkin ales, the pumpkin spices linger on the palate and are much more pronounced and fresh. One of my favorite pumpkin ales."
"O - Maybe I just dislike cardamon, but this is one wasn't very enjoyable for me. Far from a drain pour, but I won't be buying this next year."

"Overall: One of my top 5 pumpkin ales but it just can’t beat out Southern Tier’s Pumking. It’s still an awesome ale though and good for any fall occasion."
""
""
"This beer is reaching, but does not disappoint. The pumpkin is held back with that perfect balance of earthy yet wait for it, yep its still a good beer. The color is a deep clear orange with seamless legs. The kind of legs you want to put stockings on and a lamp shade. Maybe introduce a black light bulb for effect and let Weyerbacher do its thang! Year after year I still think these guys have crafted a well rounded, waiting for x-mas with a buzz on, type of beer. I am only hoping Santa can crave his way out of this pumpkin and into that deep freeze with which we survive the lesser daylight. It reminds me of those quick days that burn off the gray faster than Bolt does his shirt."
"Overall: The body of the beer is medium full and the finish is medium. The beer is great, I feel that the nose is so much better than the taste. However, I would have to like to see more of a malt complex in the beer. At times the beer seemed a bit thin but chewy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Big fan. Easily in my 5 best pumpkin beers"
"This pumpkin ale does not disappoint. Packs quite a pumpkin-y punch. Great balance of spicy and sweet. You can taste all the different spices. Easy, smooth, Medium to full bodied. Somewhat creamy mouthfeel with soft carbonation. Definitely one of the best pumpkin ales out there."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Thanks again weyerbacher."
""
""
""
"Overall: A pretty solid pumpkin beer to add to the list. Bitterness is higher than I would like, but still a good pumpkin beer."
"O- I'd get this Pumpkin ale again. It definitely tastes like Autumn in the North East. I would like it to be a little less flat but not a deal breaker."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - ok offering, average pumpkin ale."
""

"I liked this pumpkin ale quite a bit but could see how it could be polarizing. If you don't like spices, you likely won't like this."

"Overall, a nicely balanced pumpkin beer, especially for those who prefer squashy varieties to sweet. I am of the latter, not the former. I definitely prefer pumpkin beers that bring more sweetness to the table. Still, this was a very enjoyable beer."

"Drink- I thank Troy for this one. A nice pumpkin beer that I didnt have before. Id probably have this one again. I did have an 11.3% TIPA right before this. Couldve been a bit off my game as well."
"O: Not the greatest Weyerbacher Ive had. But I have not had that many since they are so pricey. Regardless, for the season, this is a must try and is among the top harvest beers!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: this was labeled as an imperial pumpkin ale, but it wasn't over the top pumpkin. It was a beer first and foremost. The did well to incorporate all of the flavors associated with this style, but nothing really stood out. A solid brew, but nothing spectacular."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A very tasty seasonal ale, very crisp and refreshing on a cold/rainy autumn evening"
""
""
""
""
"O - Good pumpkin beer, one of the better I have had this season. I would definitely recommend this beer. Its definitely not sessionable but worth the purchase."
""
""
"O- and I thought Pumking was all spices. Too much pumpkin pie spice and not enough pumpkin."
"I am a pumpkin beer junkie. Every year I try and sample as many as I possibly can. This beer is outstanding. It is the best pumpkin beer I have had so far besides Great Lakes Pumpkin Ale. It goes down very smooth for a 8% beer and smells and tastes like pumpkin pie with whipped cream. You would expect a lot more spice for a beer that is 8% but this goes down easy and tastes amazing. It is a little pricey at $12 a 4 pack but worth every penny."

"O - Not really the most session-able beer I have ever had, but I did enjoy it. I liked how the sweetness was not the focal point, but rather the warm spices. Most of the top tier pumpkin brews (Pumking in particular) really overload that sweetness. This is a good change of pace."
""
""
""
""
""
"Decent pumpkin. I've certainly had worse although I wish the spices were a bit more restrained on this one and more natural pumpkin came through."
""
""
"I'm rating this beer all 5s because I think it is absolutely excellent. LOTS of flavor, lots of alcohol, and probably one of my favorite pumpkin beers alongside Dog Fish Head's Punkin Ale with the exception that both are different and not totally comparable."

""
""
""
""
"Poured from tap into tulip at gingerman SONO. Pours a deep orangey brown with good foamy head. Crazy spice aromas, with your typical sweet malts. Flavor of pumpkin pie, typical cinnamon, nutmeg, some vanilla, etc...just overly spiced for a drink but good for pie...with such an influx of pumpkin brews, there are others id go for before i have this again..."
""
""
""
"Overall – A nice pumpkin beer with a not too overpowering sweetness and nice flavors and a wonderful aroma."
""
""
""
"Overall: Very delicious pumpkin style beer. Thoroughly enjoyed this beer and will definitely recommend this beer to a friend and will have again. I really enjoyed the overall presence of the spices and balance of flavors and it also presented a nice mash of pumpkin."
""
""
"This is honestly the best pumpkin ale I’ve had to date; even better then the Dogfish Head Punkin by far."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste isn't a surprise, as the nutmeg and cinnamon really come out well. There's certainly a definite pumpkin taste to this one. However, it does it without being overly sweet, which I think some pumpkin beers end up overdoing. Don't get me wrong, it is mildly sweet after all, but far from syrupy or boozy. It just all works very well and fans of pumpkin beers should enjoy this one."
""
""
"O - A very good pumpkin beer, especially if you are more inclined toward the spicier ones as I am. Very good mix of flavors without drowning out the pumpkin, very pie like in smell and flavor. Definitely one of my top three pumpkin beers that I have tried to date."
"Overall-- this isn't a style I usually buy, but every fall I tend to try 1 or 2 new ones... I think this one is a bit too hearty, a bit too boozy, and a bit too heavy-handed on a few of the spices. This is worth a try, but I won't be buying anymore."
""
"Drinkability: A fantastic imperial pumpkin beer. The flavor of pumpkin is not over exaggerated like in other pumpkin beers."
"Weyerbacher makes one of my favorite pumpkin ales. I try this one yearly and always want to come back for more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I've had a couple pumpkin ales better than this, but I've had more that aren't nearly as good. It contains its strength well and I would definitely have this again."
""
""
""
""
"O – This is a really nice pumpkin beer. It’s full of all the usual pumpkin and spice aromas and flavors plus a nice amount of malt. It’s also extraordinarily drinkable for 8% ABV – there was barely any throat-warming. There’s nothing earth-shattering here; it’s just a solid fall beer. Nicely done, Weyerbacher."
"Very nice pumpkin ale, true to the taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is one of my favorite pumpkin beers. It is ridiculous how many pumpkin beers pop up on the shelves this time of year and I think this is one of the few that is worthwhile. The pumpkin flavor works well without tasting artificial and the spices are mellow. I would like a bit more body, but overall not too much wrong with this one. I recommend it in lieu of many others in the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer pours a dark red-amber with no haze and a dense, foamy tan head. Unfortunately the head does fall flat quickly once drinking ensues and doesn't provide much lacing past the first minute. The nose is well spiced with semi-bold nutmeg/clove and there is a bite from the alcohol. It's not a particularly sweet smelling beer, but some notes of caramelized sugars do present themselves. The taste is malty, spicy and damn well balanced. This is a very drinkable, well-attenuated, adequately spiced beer and it would probably pair well with just about every seasonal meal I could think of. Definitely a beer I'll keep in mind during the fall season and I will likely visit it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"o: perhaps the most aromatic of the pumpkin beers I have tried, but it does fall down on the flavor. good enough mouthfeel and carbonation, but the depth of flavor simply isn't there, and we are after all ultimately, drinking, not smelling, beer."
"Even for a pumpkin brew I am not feeling this doesn't really do it, and is actually quite disappointing for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not a bad pumpkin ale. I'm not a huge fan of these types of beer but its brewed about an hour and a half away from my house and everyone raves about it this time of year. If your a fan of spicy beers and/or pumpkin pie, this def won't disappoint."
"O: Again, really just too much spice to be enjoyed on any decent basis. The cinnamon especially is way too over the top, and there are too many spices in there to have it make any sense palate-wise. If you don't like spices in your beer, be sure to stay clear of this one"
""
"Rich in pumpkin flavor right away with background notes of nutmeg, cinnamon, and allspice to support it. Caramel on the backend and just enough bitterness to make it not too sweet. It has a fine, pretty much smooth mouthfeel with lower carbonation levels and a medium body. Thoroughly enjoyable and entirely pleasurable."
""
"O ~ Saw it and picked it up not really knowing what to expect but having a good idea of what I wanted, and this wasn't it. Not bad overall though."
""
""
""
"Good everything. Solid pumpkin ale. Nutmeg, clove, warm pumpkin-spice, allspice. The usual suspects. Great big brown character. Sweet brown sugar and butter. Mild banana notes. All this tied up in the nose and taste. Very little hopping, just enough to act as a bittering agent, not big in the flavor though. Moderate mouthfeel, little smaller than 8% should feel. Good work. I might pair it with something later. Maybe some roasted root vegetables."
""
""
"This is medium bodied with sharp carbonation. This one isn't bad for those who love spice bombs."
""
""
""
""
""
"There definitely is some spice, but for a pumpkin beer, it's not an overwhelming pumpkin taste. The spice smell is there, and there is a faint aroma of pumpkin when you first smell it. It tastes like fall, and it is good, but the pumpkin taste is a bit disappointing."
""
"Light half a finger head of tan color which evaporates down very quickly to an almost foamless surface, likewise the lacing is nonexistent. Copper orange colored liquid, a few trace bubbles zip about, yellows around the rims, pleasing overall clarity. Given the richness of its pungency the nose has a stiff texture and feel, plenty of pumpkin there, more so cinnamon, clove spice and something reminiscent of cola, also some lemon citrus and well baked pie crust notes, rises deep into your nostrils and stays there for some time. Medium-bodied, equally firm feel here in the mouth, the carbonation more muscular than expected based on visual inspection. Mixes some milk chocolate into those baking spices, sort of softens things a touch. The pumpkin is strong without being really sweet. Biscuit, scone with a moment of cornbread, here there’s a stronger honeyed aspect. The floral dimension expands through the finish, extending things further. The level of spicing is pretty outrageous so if you want lowkey or demure, this is not for you. Otherwise, get ready for a spice fest."
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a very good and very enjoyable pumpkin beer that is looking for a beer that has the pumpkin and spice flavors but doesn't taste like a pumpkin pie. I only wish the alcohol was a little more well hidden - though I found that it was not as present in the bottled version."
""
""
"Final Thoughts: I'm currently brewing a Pumpkin Ale and I hope it turns out like this one. The spices are at a great level and the pumpkin flavor really shines. A likable beer that I'll probably buy again when it starts getting colder outside."
""
""
"There is some nice flavor to be had once you start sipping, but the flavors are just here and there. It doesn't come together well."
""
""
""
"This beer pours a medium bodied deep polished cherry wood, auburn in color with no head at all and moderate carbonation. The nose is super spicy and a cardamom bomb. There is also cinnamon and nutmeg but Wowzers is there too much cardamom. The flavors too are dominated by cardamom. It has the typical characteristics of cinnamon, pumpkin, and nutmeg but the spicing is pretty over the top. It definitely takes away from the overall product. I just can't get behind this one. It doesn't have the balance that a beer of this style needs."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This one caught me off guard. I bought it out of sheer curiosity, and came away impressed. If I ever felt like having a pumpkin ale again, I'd go for this in a heartbeat."
""
""
""
""
"O/D-A gutsy Pumpkin brew. Assertive. Good flavors but a bit too coarse. I prefer Southern Tier's Pumpking, but this lies in the same echelon."
""
""
""
""
"O- I expected better. there are definitely better pumpkin ales out there, but i think the idea of an 8% ABV pumpkin ale looks better on paper than it turns out when actualized. there's not much room for the kind of subtlety that is required of the style when you beef up a beer so much, and i still think some of my favorite pumpkin ales are also very sessionable for a reason."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - 4.0 -I've never liked pumpkin beers but this one is good. I can never taste anything but spice, and it's always too much. This one actually has faint undertones of actual pumpkin taste and the spices are tastefully subtle. Instead it relies on more of caramelly brown sugar core and something of the personality of a brown ale. It's very nice. I usually don't even want to drink half of a pumpkin beer I start, but I'll enjoy several of these this week. Recommended to any pumpkin ale fan."
""
""
"O - definitely from a different mold than most pumpkin beers. But for me, that makes it enjoyable. Youre not bombarded with often fake spiciness and cloying sweetness. What you do get is rich pumpkin flavor with a hint of spice. Just like a good slice of pumpkin pie. Well done."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Decent execution for a spice/pumpkin beer. Low carbonation was just right, but brewery delivered fairly well on the big spice flavors. Would have appreciated heavier low-notes and a little more syrup in the mouth feel."
""
""
"Imperial Pumpkin Ale pours a clear copper color, with very little. The aroma has a strong note of pumpkin, and is creamy. The taste has a nice bitter undertone, with hints of nutmeg, and cinnamon, it blends very nicely. Very nice flavors, blends good, still has a beer taste. Overall a fantastic pumpkin beer up there with the best."
""
""
""
""
"Heavily reliant on the spices and very herbaceous this year. The 8% abv is covered well as always."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: My first pumpin beer, and if this is supposed to be one of the best in the style, I am quite disappointed. Was expecting more pumpkin flavor and spice. Excited to see what other in the style have to offer this fall, and happy I got this one out of the way with a single now. Maybe I just don't get the style yet."

"Pours a dark black with little to no head. Smells like pumpkin with an array of spices- cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, ginger. Tastes almost like a pumpkin pie with the high alcohol content apparent in the finish. For its dark color, it's surprisingly thin-bodied. Overall, the best pumpkin ale I've had as I have yet to find one that's comparable. A great fall beer and good transition from the blondes and wheats of summer to the malty, spicy winter brews."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D-Overall this was a fantastic pumpkin ale. And its 8% which it higher than most pumpkin ales. I thought the flavors and aromas really were a home run in this beer. I would def. pick this up if you like pumpkin beers. It rates up there with DFH pumpkin ale. I think i might have to do a side by side tasting next year to see which i like better."

"O: Much more pumpkin spice than actual pumpkin flesh. Nevertheless, this beer is still one of my favorite pumpkin beers because it always reminds me of a nice pumpkin pie... the 8% abv does't hurt either. Also this beer is very consistent from year to year."
""
"(12 oz. bottle into pint glass) Pours a murky dark orange with a one finger head that fell quickly with little to no lacing. Aroma is heavy of the pumpkin and what can best be described as mulling spices. It's very smooth on the tongue and very creamy, almost like pumpkin pie. The kick of spice is a pleasant surprise compared to some more overly sweet pumpkin ales I've tried. Definitely one of the top contenders in this heavily populated seasonal style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I'm still happy with this beer. It's a well-crafted pumpkin ale, and given the opportunity, I'd recommend everyone give the Weyerbacher Imperial Pumpkin Ale a chance. However, I'm still looking forward to a few of the other pumpkin beers coming soon. This may be the Queen of Pumpkin beers, but I'm looking for the king!"
"O- Pretty impressive but doesn't make it into my list of Top 3 Pumpkin beers. The fact that it hardly tastes like pumpkin has a lot to do with that."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall, I would buy again but just seasonal. once in a while is nice. Thanks once again Weyerbacher."

"Can't wait to have this again next Fall!"
"O – Delicious, fresh pumpkin and cinnamon taste. One of the best pumpkin brews around."
""
""
"D/O- Pretty solid pumpkin offering from Weyerbacher. Nothing amazing but worth a shot if you're a fan of the style. Thanks for the try at an out of distro'ed brewery ruizjoseph!"
""
""
"Pours deep orange, closer to amber brown. Frothy 2 finger head of lasting presence. Great sweet and spicy aroma, brown sugar, pumpkin spice, cinnamon. Not getting any clove notes as stated but definitely getting nutmeg, perhaps too much of it. Not bad, slightly above avg. but not a memorable favorite. Would still retry it next year."
""
""
""
""
""
"Medium bodied and lots of carbonation. You can taste the pumpkin, cinnamon, cardamom and cloves. However, I don't pick up the nutmeg in the flavor. Sweet upfront with pumpkin and cardamom. Cloves and more cardamom in the middle. A slightly sweet finish with cinnamon and peaches. Very nice. The 8.0% ABV is well hidden among the sweet pumpkin spices."

""

"This is a decent beer. The flavor is good, but mild. Unfortunately, there are better pumpkins on the market each fall so I probably won't seek this one out again."
""
"Weyerbacher Imperial Pumpkin Ale is a crystal clear amber ale with a generous, creamy yellowish head that has outstanding retention and lacing. The aroma is thick and spicy with clove at the forefront. It's quite full bodied and very smooth with a clean, quick finish. It leaves the mouth a little slick after a few sips. It tastes bold and flavorful. There isn't much bitterness and it sits between sweet and dry. The cardamom and clove kind of give it a chai flavor. I can taste the pumpkin right before the finish. It's kind of exotic tasting. This is a stand out pumpkin ale. The cardamom really sets it apart. It's like a pumpkin spiced chai latte beer. Love it."

"O: Good big pumpkin ale. Feels thicker than you would expect, it's almost syrupy."
""

""

"Overall Impression- What a Pumpkin! The sweetness and spice were just perfect adding to the richness of a """true""" pumpkin pie flavor. Enjoyed this one til every last drop hit my tongue and can throw this in my Top 5 Pumpkin Ales without a doubt. Thanks a ton ipaking67 and hope you enjoyed those Schlafly Pumpkin Ales (which are #1 on my list) and the Saison Brett."

""
""

"Poured dark amber with a small head that dissipated quickly leaving no lace. Smell was a rich sugary caramel malt with nutmeg and cinnamon. Taste was caramel, cinnamon, nutmeg, sweet, and the cardamom mentioned on the label, which along with the sweetness gives the beer a slightly chai tea taste. Alcohol was noticeable. Mouthfeel was too light. Overall was interesting, but I've had better pumpkin ales."

"Overall, it's a good pumpkin ale, but not a great one. I read a bunch of reviews that say - """Good to try if you like pumpkin ales.""" Well, duh. But is it GOOD? Pumking is infectious, tasty and well blended. This one lags behind. It needs some flavor to offset the spices."

"Brew yields a deep garnet hued amber color with a frothy, almost creamy, head. A generous aroma of """Fall""" blended dessert fills the nose with notes of sugared ginger cookies and perhaps some cinnamon and nutmeg. Fairly smooth mouthfeel with only a slight booziness relative to other pumpkin beers of Imperial claim that I've tried. Maple like sweetness joins a solid pumpkin flavor in the malt body with a note of clove and an herbal finish."
"O: A pretty good Pumpkin Ale. A tad to boozy and a touch to peppery. If you like pumpkin ales give it a try."
"D - I was really impressed with this pumpkin ale. Weyerbacher got everything right here. It's tasty, highly drinkable, and leaves you wanting more."
"O: Good, but not an excellent pumpkin ale. The strength doesn't show and it's quite drinkable. I wouldn't recommend it, but I might pick one up next year."
"D: A rather nice strong ale given a seasonal flair by some spice & gourd. The rich melanoidan, toasty, nutty, roasty malt base of this really make it shine. Way too easy drinking for 8 percent!"
"One of the better pumpkin ales I had this year; I remember not thinking much of this last year. One to revisit if available, but I would appreciate Weyerbacher toning down the alcohol a notch; I'm not sure how much this benefits by a heightened ethanol content, and the noticeable scent and burn aren't particularly pleasant."
"Taste was exceptional. Perfect mix of malt, spice, and booze... a serious seasonal ale. Not some pumpkin pie-like swill. Last year I was on a pumpkin ale quest and tasted MANY. The Weyerbacher was my favorite and sold out pretty quickly here. I was glad to see its return this season. Of course at 12 bucks a 12 oz. FOUR pack you may think twice. However, you get what you pay for."
"O - Nice seasonal beer. First Weyerbacher beer that I try. Not a complete pumpkin ale for me, but I could get it again. The flavors are there, you can notice right away without problem. Nice beer to pair with Chicken Tacos! :)"
"Eh, not bad, but far from great."
"Copper orange with a reddish hue and perfect clarity. Poured with a dense, foamy head that leaves random, lacings on the glass. Sweet pumpkin and spicy aromas. Spicy aromas are delicate enough to allow the pumpkin sweetness to dominate. Buttery smooth feel with the carbonation and maltiness combining to provide a thick, chewy texture. Sweet pumpkin flavor up front and into the middle. Spices kick-in thru the middle and slowy intensify to the finish. Spices are delicate enough so as not to overwhelm the sweet pumpkin maltiness and nicely subdue an underlying booziness. Finishes with a lingering but light, spicy aftertaste. The best Pumpkin Ale I've had."
"Cheers..."
"High ABV -- kind of a Pumpkin tripel -- but otherwise rather average quality pumpkin ale."
"O: My number 3 all time Pumpkin Beer. A must buy and this one doesn't have a cult following like Schlafly and S.T Pumking so you can be sure to have it at a Total Wine or other major beer super store. Do yourself a favor and pack some up for the cold fridged January nights when you hopefully are near a nice roasting fire. This beer will serve me well this winter season. Shit I will bring some with me when I go boarding soon. HA!!"
"Overall: A very good pumpkin ale. Very bold with the spices and malts. Could of had a little more actual pumpkin flavor but whats there is very good."
"O: Quite nice overall, especially the nose, I just wish there were a bit more pumpkin and less spice."
"The alcohol is deceptively high in this as I couldn't feel it in the taste and barely noticed a boozy sensation after I worked my way through the contents of my pint glass. In the past, I wasn't so much a fan of this style, but it's a beer like this that can change my mind. This was an unexpected surprise that I thoroughly enjoyed and can't wait to try again, and it's beers like this that make this season so enjoyable!"
"Overall, flavors and spiciness remind me of Yards tavern spruce, which gives me a sense that the spice content is quite high. Overall, not my favorite type of pumpkin, one of the more spicy."
"Overall, the taste can be too much to handle. But the mouthfeel is nice and the smell, alone, is well-worth the price of admission."
"O-nice ber but I wish it followed the nose more"
"O-Overall this is a solid pumpkin brew. Nice combo or pumpkin and spice. Surprisingly drinkable for 8% ABV. Not as good as Southern Tier's Pumking, but good nonetheless."
"Although the limited Woodchuck Private Reserve Pumpkin Cider sounds delighful."
"O: Its a wonderful fall pumpkin beer, just went to the top of my list."
"Overall: Overall, a very decent example of the style. Could use a bit more maltiness and/or body to prevent the alcohol from being a bit overpowering. The aroma, though, is phenomenal. Definitely reminds me of the fall!"
"O: very good pumpkin ale, and I'll have it again. Would love to do a side by side with some other pumpkins, but I'll save that for fresh batches next year."
"Overall: A decent pumpkin beer. I did't care for the combination of cardamom and cloves."
"O: My favorite pumpkin offering so far. This one and the post road would be good head to head. I like the smell and the taste of this one better. After it sits for a bit it starts to get a little bit bitter, but it just blends in with the spices. I would recommend this to anyone for a pumpkin ale to try."
"Tried this at a Bocktown Beer and Grill. Its wonderful pumpkin pie flavor mixed nicely with the caramel, cinnamon, and nutmeg. I was pleasantly surprised that our server had dipped the rim of the pint glass in brown sugar. While I haven’t had many pumpkin ales to-date, it is my opinion that this ale ranks extremely high when compared with ANY type of beer. I was super impressed."
"O - A solid pumpkin brew. I'd definitely have another."
"The appearance of this pumpkin ale is amber and orange with a small off-white head. Its` nose is nutmeg, cinnamon, clove, very nice indeed. The taste of this beer is a bit bitter, some pumpkin, along with more of those nice spices and sweetness to it. Mouthfeel is medium, a crisp texture. It drinks fairly easily. All in all, one of the better pumpkin beers out there. While it has a stronger spice than some of the basic pumpkin ales, it is not overdone as some others are on the other end of the spectrum."
"O - Just too sweet for my liking, but may be worth a buy for the smell alone."
"Medium bodies wth good carbonation. Overall not bad here. A solid pumpkin brew."
"A Nice beer with subtle spicing. It is not too carbonated and there is no bitter after taste. much more body than shipyard pumpkin. After notes of sweetness like a Belgian. I like the color, not too clear and red tones make it look nice in the glass. Minimal head."
"O- One of the better pumpkin beers I've had. Would love some more of this for sure. Haven't had some of the higher rated pumpkin beers, but would love to try them if they are better than this."
"D: for an imperial pumpkin, this is easy to drink. a very festive offering from weyerbacher."
"O: Overall a good brew, I enjoyed it very much, weyerbacher impresses all the time."
"O: I thought I was in for a treat based off of the appearance and smell of this brew, but the taste and mouthfeel let me down slightly. That's not to say this isn't a good pumpkin beer. It most certainly is. But it isn't the most focused I have had and it's definitely a little over-spiced. Could have used a touch more malt to level things out a touch. All the same, I love me some pumpkin beers and this one is enjoyable. Weyerbacher continues to produce some of the finest brew in the country. If you see it, grab it!"
"Overall, a great take on a pumpkin beer- a good deal of pumpkin taste but not overwhelmingly so. I still like DFH Punk'n better, but this is also very good."
"Hazy orange in color, with a thin head that disappears quickly. Aroma is malty, with the prerequisite pumpkin spices, in a nice blend. Spices come heavily in the taste--nutmeg, cinnamon, and the pumpkin later. The alcohol is hidden well at this percentage. Not my favorite pumpkin beer, but definitely a good example of one with more alcohol."
"Overall awesome beer for the season"
"It's a nice pumpkin beer. Not super rich, definitely pumpkin-y, and not just pumpkin pie spice."
"This is one of the better pumpkin ales I've had. Everything about it works together really well, and while the pumpkin flavor is present and potent, it's complemented well by the rest of the beer. A winner."
"Overall: This was my first imperial pumpkin ale. I was expecting an overwhelming alcohol flavor as I thought the pumpkin wouldnt quite over-ride it but it covered it well."
"O: Despite the little bit of anise (which I'm not the hugest fan of), this was still pretty solid."
"O - To date, this is one of my favorite pumpkin beers. Be prepared for a lot of spices, but it has a nice earthy pumpkin characteristic to it as well. If you aren't a fan of cinnamon, I'd stay away. Otherwise, this is a beer I'd recommend to any craft drinker."
"O - Very spicy/fall like. Really enjoy this, and at a drinkable 8% I'm quite happy with it"
"Medium bodied with average carbonation. The aftertaste has a lot of cinnamon. A nice beer from Weyerbacher."
"O: Of the pumpkins I've had, this one is pretty middle of the road."
"Overall: The age did this beer well. Fresh, I think the finish is a bit too bitter. The time smoothed things out nicely."
"O- I hope that this batch or bottle was just no good. All the complexity I had hoped for was dashed. It was just this side of a drain pour. I’ll try another bottle, as Weyerbacher, in general, usually brews something I like."
"Very nice, bold flavors without giving me diabetes :cough: (Southern Tier). Enjoyed it, at DFH's Punkin level for me."
"This is one of my favorate pumpkin beers if not my favorate of them all. This pumpkin ale has a great smell, color, and taste. Definitely can taste the pumpkin and spice and with this being an Imperial...it only takes a few to get into the fall spirit!"
"Poured an amber-copper, with a moderate film being left behind and a fairly thick collar. Loads of spices in the nose, with a weird burnt rubber/leather note coming through at times (admittedly, only once or twice throughout the entire glass). Some pumpkin pie notes. Taste has some pumpkin, spices reflective of the nose (nutmeg, allspice presumably) and a bit of breadiness. Medium body and carbonation, great flavour with a somewhat weird nose at moments. Pleasant but not totally satisfying."
"Overall, this is probably just behind the Schlafly and a step below the Pumking. Its a heavily spiced beer, but there is enough malt presence in there to keep it drinkable even if you are not into spice bombs. I myself enjoyed this one a lot and am glad that I have 23 more bottles of it to carry me through the fall."
"I liked this one more than my drinking mates. Definitely different than other pumpkin ales, I feel the aroma and mouthfeel are the best aspects of the beer. Taste is a bit lopsided and overly spiced. Good, definitely worth trying if you're into the style. The smooth easy drinking character of this beer makes it go down quickly...if not for the heavy hand with the spices you might get in trouble here."
"O: The only saving Grace for this beer is that it sports an ABV of 8.0%. I shouldn't have preceded this tasting with a Southern Tier Pumpking!: http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/3818/38394"
"A good drinking beer even with, in my opinion, it being weak in flavor."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass, the beer is a dark, rich, auburn-ruby coloring with no head. Deeply spicy nose, with heavy nutmeg and cinnamon characters, as well as a bready quality. Flavor is dark molasses and pumpkin rich, with a light spicing and slightly boozey character. The aftertaste is rich and smokey, with a slick, oily finish. Decent brew, and a bit darker and heftier than most pumpkin offerings."
"There is a chewy malt bill that accompanies the spices."
"With all the attendant spice, this was like a cross between a witbier and a pumpkin ale. Good stuff, recommended, probably a bit short of a killer pumpkin ale, but good nonetheless."
"Fall is finally here, and I am glad to finally have this beer again."
"O: B rated beer."
"Overall.. Im giving an unbiased rating.. I truly like everything weyerbacher does as they are a fave brewery.. It is a great and easy to drink pumpkin ale."
"O-One of the best pumpkin ales out there, this was the unanimous second place to Pumking."
"I would rank this just underneath ST Pumking and Williamsburg on my list of all-time pumpkin ale favorites."
"Overall: A great mouthfeel can go a long way with a beer, as can good hop flavor. The spices here are definitely overboard (and there's no pumpkin flavor whatsoever), but the satisfying feel and perfectly matched hops save the day. I could happily kill all or most of a 4 pack of these at some Autumn gathering."
"Overall pretty tasty pumpkin brew."
"The bottle says it all when it comes to the taste and aroma of this beer; the pumpkin and spices (cinnamon, cardamom, clove) are there in force, but do not come off as overwrought or artificial. It smells like the real thing. The flavors all carry over onto the palate, with layers and layers of spice and pumpkin. The cinnamon is particularly pronounced. This is not a style that I personally love, but it is very well done and very drinkable because there is a nice amount of carbonation that keeps the beer lively. It also hides the alcohol well, which, with all of the added flavor, was helpful in keeping the beer from being too heavy."
"This Pumpkin is a wonderful example of a beer that has a great nose and a similar taste. When you smell this beer it makes you think of pumpkin pie. With a good pour, you can have a nice frothy head, it does dissipate quickly but it releases all of the awesomeness! It is easy to drink and does not overwhelm the palate. I find that this beer ages very well and give you a nice warming sensation during those cold winter months. This is one my my Favorite pumpkin beers which can be enjoyed year round!"
"Had I not tried """Pumking""" I may have thought this was the best pumpkin ale. It is the best pumpkin ale I can buy locally however; it certainly has a lot of flavor and packs a punch. The color is a deep brownish-red with about an inch of a head with a vigorous pour, receding to little to no head. There is some lacing. The aroma is very nice dominated by vanilla, nutmeg and cinnamon. The alcohol content is prevalent immediately after the first sip. Like I said, this is good for when you want a beer with a decent 'kick.' The flavor is not as tasty as the nose suggests. If they could tone down the booze and increase the complexity of the spice flavor I would rate this higher."
"O: Too much spice and not nearly enough pumpkin for the style."
"O: The head was lacking on this beer, but I was pleasantly surprised by the nose and flavor. It was so smooth too. I liked this beer better than the dogfish head."
"Go get it."
"O: 3.5"
"Poured a thick head (half inch), but it faded pretty quickly. Smelled great, perfect combo of spices and pumpkin. Tasted pretty spicy, tough to pick out the pumpkin. I let it get closer to room temperature - it was really cold - and the pumpkin flavor came out more. 8 oz was enough for me, though. It got pretty sweet by the end. I haven't had a ton of pumpkin ales, but this was right up there with any of them."
"Overall - Have I mentioned that there's too much clove or cinnamon or whatever that is? Overpowering. It's easy enough to drink and it certainly doesn't taste bad, but where are the other flavors?"
"O: for me, I'd prefer something that tastes a little less like a beer and more like a treat - in some ways this beer reminded me of something from Unibroue (I can't recall which brew). So not to sound negative, let me just say, it is a good beer, but I didn't taste the sweet pumpkin-iness as much as I may have liked - and with """imperial""" in the name I expected something richer in taste and smell."
"O - This has good drinkability. It goes down easy, and I could easily have a few glasses of this. It is definitely a perfect beer for the fall season. It really has a festive taste to it. I like that the vanilla stands out a little bit more than in other pumpkin beers that I've had. Overall, I think this is a really good pumpkin beer, and a must try for pumpkin beer fans. I would definitely pick up more of this."
"O -- not a bad seasonal pumpkin beer, but certainly not the best I've had. If you couldn't smell the beer, you'd think it was just an over-carbonated english ale into which someone dumped some cinnamon. It is surprisingly easy to drink for an 8% ABV beer. Glad I tried it, but not on my top three list for pumpkin seasonals..."
"O- Quite enjoyable, and recommended among the style!"
"Overall: Best pumpkin ale I've had to date. Nice bold spices and pumpkin, very good mouthfeel and nice orange/clove aftertaste."
"This was a fairly expensive beer ($12/4-pack), and unfortunately, is disappointing. I wouldn't buy this again. I will sit on a bit and see how it is in a month or two. If it's any better, I'll revise."
"O- not a bad pumpkin ale but seems to be lacking a little something. Maybe a bit more hops would jazz it up. The overall flavor is still nice, but I felt like it could have been better"
"O- This has to be one of the top 5 Pumpkin brews. Lots of actual pumpkin, a little too much spice perhaps, especially in the nose... but over all very well done! I wanna grab some of this and see how it mellows out by Thanksgiving."
"Pours a clear amber with a creamy head and beautiful honeycomb lacing along the edges. Nose is soft, meaty pumpkin pie with nutmeg and a soft floral quality. Mouth opens with a touch of pumpkin meat and sugars, segues into a lightly spicy finish with gobs of pumpkin meat. Just dry enough but genuine and pleasantly robust throughout. Hops are minimal and act to compliment the pumpkin flavors into a kind of crusty flavor. Some slight lingering off flavors on the finish but that's pretty much my only knock on this. Soft in the mouth, creamy, almost perfect. Very good, probably the best pumpkin beer I've had."
"The beer is fairly hazy and sunset orange colored, with a small white cap that leaves some sparse lacing on the pint glass. The aroma is heavily spiced, with nutmeg, cinnamon, pumpkin, sweet potato, brown sugar. There's no mistaking this brew - 'tis autumn. The flavor, while also heavily spiced, offers more balance and distinction of flavors than the aroma would have led me to believe. A tasty malt backbone supports the various fall spices. Alcohol content is hidden well. Overall, a tasty pumpkin beer. While one in a session is plenty, I would certainly have this again."
"finally going to review a beer...Bought from beer Heaven on columbus blvd. Poured from bottle into a snifter. Beer has a dark reddish color two it with very nice head and retention. Spices are what primarily come through on the nose, cinnamon and nutmeg being the most prominent(bottle also inludes cardamon and cloves). Spices are defentatley present in the tast but not overwhelmingly so that a bit of pumpkin doesnt come through(wich sometimes i find a problem with other pumpkin ales). Alcohol is overpowering but it is definately present and creates a nice warming sensation that works great with the spices and pumpkin. This is hands down my favorite pumpkin ale that I have tried. Also what an awesome label!!"
"I will pick this over most other pumpkin beers this season. Some are just too sweet for me, but this nails it."
"Appearance included a nice frothy head but really the smell seamed to jump from the glass. Taste and mouthfeel were perfect, exactly what you want from a Pumpkin in Fall flavorful but didn't linger for too long."
"The Imperial Pumpkin lives up to its name - it is definitely a strong pumpkin ale. Delicious and tasty, but it is not a beer that I would be able to drink too many of in one sitting. A nice beer to enjoy as Summer turns into Fall."
"O: Very drinkable. The spices can become a bit much, but it was very enjoyable overall."
"This one pours a lively festive orange with a tall tan head doesn’t leave much lacing. The smell is warm and inviting cinnamon spice sweet bread and of course, pumpkin. Great flavor, pumpkin pie, spice caramel subtle sweetness, there is some heat from the abv but not to much. Mouthfeel Is chewy and thick, very satisfying. A fantastic seasonal beer that makes you feel better about g.d. winter coming"
"The body is a translucent orange and brown color with some lighter pumpkin-colored hues in the thinner regions of the glass. The head was small off the pour, a finger’s-breadth at best, and faded relatively quickly to nothing but a ring around the surface of the liquid. The smell is wonderful; nutmeg, cinnamon, clove, cardamom, some pumpkin, and even a faint vanilla. The taste is similar, with a bit of the faint pumpkin in the front before the rush of aforementioned spices dominate. A bit of a warming alcohol finish along with the faintest vanilla flavor. Honestly, this is like someone took pumpkin pie, slapped vanilla ice cream on top, and found a way to bottle it. The mouth is rich in flavor, but not overly thick and does not leave any kind of sugary film behind. Very well done. Exactly what I had hoped it would be, and I certainly wish I had more."
"A hugely flavorful, big pumpkin ale, though the spices are the star and not at all the pumpkin."
"O: Good, and while I'm not sure if the aggregate score above is going to give this a better score than Saranac's (non-imperial) pumpkin brew, I think I actually preferred there's to Weyerbacher. If nothing else Saranac's is a lot cheaper and has about 90% of the flavor of this."
"O/D: In my opinion, no pumpkin ale is really up there in the drinkability department... this is one’s no exception; a good brew, but nothing too crazy; overall - smeh... maybe I should give up on the pumpkins."
"O- There are some great flavor profiles...but a little watered down for my taste."
"O: Another nice pumpkin ale. Though, I must say, shipyard smashed pumpkins is probably my favorite pumpkin ale still, but I'll try to find some more to try."
"o - overall, another solid pumpkin brew. the highlight is the nose by a mile, but not bad."
"Overall, a great pumpkin beer, but I probably wouldn't have more than one in a sitting."
"Pours a nice dark amber/brown with orange highlights. Beautiful one finger cocoa head. Very good on the carbonation and lacing. A somewhat hazy beer that you can't see through. Nose is really nice for the style. Nutmeg, cinnamon, pumpkin, some malt. Really good, especially if you like pumpkin ales. Taste follows the nose, with nothing really changing. Big time malt backbone on this brew- and it's really well done. This is a borderline 4.5 on taste. Alcohol is almost completely masked, w/ at 8% is pretty good. Mouthfeel is malt smoothness and carbonation bite, w a nice lingering aftertaste. Somewhat dry finish, but not too bad. Overall, this is a really nice Pumpkin Ale, and I definitely recommend this. I know I'll pick it up again. Cheers."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a deep brownish/orange color with a 1 inch head. Smell is spicy, mostly cinamon, some pumpkin. Taste is also cinamon up front, some nutmeg and pumpkin. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall is an enjoyable beer."
"This is the first pumpkin beer of the year for me and it was not overpowering like some can be. Also it is nicely balanced with every thing pumpkin, spices and alcohol. Not a bad beer."
"O: possibly the best pumpkin ive ever had, not terribly strong on the alcohol but wonderously complex and so smooth, not too filling, just wonderful"
"I am blown away by how good this beer blends all the ingredients together. Also being 8% you can't pick up on any alcohol."
"O: A good pumpkin offering, a bit heavy on the spices is my only complaint, the cloves in particular."
"O: Overall, a good pumpkin ale. I'd prefer a more pronounced pumpkin flavor, but at least the spices are not overpowering as they are in some pumpkin ales."
"O - A very unique Pumpkin ale. Has a slight funkiness to it, which I like, reminds me of a good French or Alsacian wine. Sweet but not too much so, and the spices are very well balanced so you can pinpoint each one in the medley of flavors."
"Highly recommended & at $2.50 for a 12oz, its really not a bad deal at all! Get some."
"Cheers!"
"Mouth feel and overall - Warm and tingly on the tongue. I continue to taste different notes as my glass empties. This beer surprises you and leaves you in suspense of what you'll taste next. Delicious. Medium bodied all around. The pumpkin notes are making themselves better known towards the end of the drink."
"...and then everything else -- including this Weyerbacher. A solid pumpkin ale, but not in the same league as any of the aforementioned brews."
"QUITE NICE, GIVE IT A GO!"
"Overall: If you love fall seasonals like I do, go for this one, but be warned - it is not a pumpkin ale for beginners; this is not a """training wheels""" pumpkin ale. It's literally like liquid pumpkin pie, and that is a fantastic thing to me."
"D = This is a pretty good seasonal, I was hoping the taste would match the smell but still not bad overall."
"O- A pretty over the top pumpkin ale that has been one of the few in this style that I have really enjoyed. It does taste like liquid pumpkin pie, lots of pumpkin pie spices are very prominent. If you don't like pumpkin pie stay away, but if you do this is a treat."
"Overall I loved the way this beer looked and smelled, but the taste and mouthfeel were very average in my opinion. Maybe my taste for pumpkin beers is fading after all this time."
"This nice pumpkin ale poured reddish amber with a nice head. The lacing was adequate and had a pleasant malty taste. The spices were spot on and a hint of pumpkin and vanilla topped it off. It was like drinking a pumpkin pie without the overly sweet flavor!"
"The best pumpkin brew I have tried yet. It is a pumpkin beer yes, but so much deeper and flavorful then the others I have tried. it is a pumpkin brew that doesnt forget to taste like beer. Excellent."
"O: A very drinkable beer. I definitely enjoyed this one."
"You certainly know what you are getting with this beer. Very dominated by the spices noted on the bottle, something that always makes me think less of a brew."
"O - Pretty drinkable, spicy and malty, not a bad pumpkin ale!"
"Definitely the best pumpkin ale I've had and one which I will be purchasing again."
"O-the more i drink this, more flavors start to pop out. the tastes reminds me more of pumpkin pie crust than pumpkin pie, pumpkins, or anything else pumpkin flavored. its absolutely one of the better pumpkin ales that i've had. it drinks very well for the abv, but truthfully i was hoping for something a bit deeper and more filling. i think if Weyerbacher worked on this one a bit, it could be an A."
"Body comes off a little thin, just a little thin. And maybe some more pumpkin flavors would help. Otherwise, this is solid stuff. An excellent brew to get you set for Fall, and everything Fall. I'm already looking forward to having more."
"-JH-"
"Overall - It was okay, honestly. I was a bit disappointed. I like the brews that aren't trying to overdo that pumpkin pie taste and use more of that natural pumpkin taste, but it was like they did that, but then overspiced it with clove. But there just seemed to be something off about this one."
"O- Pretty pretty pretty pretty good stuff. Great for blending pumpkin black and tans...."
"Poured a dark amber into my pint with one-inch head that settles in to reveal a nice and thorough off-white film atop. Good retention and some lacing. Really well established look to this brew and I sense lower carbonation. There is a strong, sweet smell of pumpkin and a fragrant spiciness is noticed right away. Good blend of spices and good job on achieving a natural pumpkin flavor. Cloves and nutmeg take over with cinnamon certainly noticeable. Not overdone by any means. A subtle aftertaste of the spices resides. A smooth imperial ale for an 8% abv with no detection of alcohol whatsoever. Not as heavy as I expected with medium carbonation. This is a good pumpkin ale that I think hit most of the marks. The bottle label is creepy also; that king pumpkin with the robe. A solid, late summer release pumpkin brew."
"my first pumpkin beer of the season and want more"
"O- Very nice well rounded and medium bodied beer. The best I have had this season. I have had SA Octoberfest and Shipyard Pumpkinhead and thios beats them both by a longshot"
"Poured into a pint glass, a burnt orange with just less than a finger of off-white head that receded to almost nothing after a moment. Nice aroma of fresh pumpkin and nutty grains. Taste...was what a pumpkin ale should taste like. Rich caramel malts to start, followed by yummy pumpkin, cinnamon and spice. Not subdued. It's pumpkin, and that's how I like it. Ends a little bitter, with some finishing hops easily detectable. Medium bodied, and smooth enough to keep you coming back for more."
"Overall: Best of the Pumpkin beers that have been released so far this season, that are available in central Ohio. Lets of exceptions have to be made in August I suppose."
"Poured from the bottle to a pint glass."
"O: I am very sad that this beer is not distributed in this area. I would definitely pick this up in the fall if I could get my hands on it."
"O- Tried this one a night after I tried Southern Tier's Pumking. Weyerbacher's isn't nearly as sweet as the Pumking, but both are excellent in their own right. Definitely worth a try."
"O - One of my favorite Pumpkin Beers, right up there with DFH Punkin!"
"Cardamom is the spice that brings it all home! Haven't seen this in many other pumpkins and really seems to give it a great pumpkin pie flavor without being over the top. I'm using it as a guide for my pumpkin homebrew this weekend."
"A more casual review, admittedly but it suffices to say that I deeply enjoyed this beer. I am happy to say that it fell into the better of the extremes. It's still August, but fall can't come soon enough!"
"I'm feelin this good and I'm only one and a half in."
"Overall: You gotta love the taste of Autumn in August. I'm glad Weyebacher releases this during the later summer months. A nice, slow sipping beer with a ton of flavor. My other favorite is Southampton Pumpkin Ale. Now I will have a decision to make when it comes to committing to a 1/6th keg of this style. Weyerbacher Imperial Pumpkin will make me ponder my choice for sure. Well done..."
"An exceptional pumpkin beer. Big pumpkin flavors meshing with sweet malts and just a bit of floral hops with a nice, spicy finish. Comes out a bit early for a pumpkin beer, but hey, I'm not complaining."
"M: Fairly thick but not necessarily creamy. Medium-heavy with a mid-range carbonation. A little bit of alcohol dryness on the back end."
"O: Very nice pumpkin ale. One of the better that I've had. A little bit bitter than some, but more flavorful than others."
"Overall this is a very good beer, low carbonation makes it a little weird, but maybe it was just this bottle. I will see with the others."
"o-this years version is good. i remember last years being a bit better but cant put my finger on why. for some reason this year it doesnt extremely wow me like it did previous years. its still damn good though."
"O- love it. Didn't review it last year but I think I like 2011 better."
"Mouthfeel a little strange. I would like it to be more creamy. Instead, it tingles the tongue. There is a drying alcohol finish. A little more sweetness and a fuller, creamier body would benefit this beer in my opinion."
"D -- Very nice rendition of Pumpkin ale and worth a pickup. I can see these being dangerous."
"Hurray!"
"I really enjoy the taste of it but in my opinion drinks pretty light for an 8 percent. Overall I did enjoy it. Cheers!"
"Overall, I’m pretty sad. Though I may have gotten a bad bottle considering so many people talk about the great foamy head on this beer. I’m on my last 8oz now and while I’m not really enjoying it all that much, and I’m surely not feeling pumpkin pie (which is what I want to feel). I can say this beer does have a fall feel to it. If anything else it reminds me of autumn and the turn of the seasons. PROST!"
"LOVE WEYERBACHER PUMPKIN!"
"I look forward to having at least one bottle of this every year. This brew pours out as a really deep amber color with a tan head that sorta fades away quickly. The aroma on this beer is super spicy, lots of cinnamon, allspice and nutmeg in here mixed with a booze like aroma too. The taste is near perfect the whole flavor comes together with the mixture of pumpkin and spice. The mouthfeel is a little heavier than medium. Overall this is probably a top 5 on the pumpkin beer chart for me."
"Perfect dessert substitution for Thanksgiving or after any fall meal in my opinion. This is in the top 2 Pumpkin beer category if you ask me. Ranks above even Elysian Night Owl as THE BEST quality beer/pumpkin creations available."
"O: A nice pumpkin ale and will probably have it again next season. Not the best one out there, but it's worth trying."
"This pours with very little head and no lacings. upon first smell i was quite excited at the variety of aroma:pumpkin, cinnamon, cloves) The taste is good with lots of sharp spice on the tongue but the flaors compete too much for me to really enjoy each"
"Rating: 4/3/3/4/3"
"the imperial pumpkin ale from weyerbacher is very complex and delicious. i have had an affection for all things pumpkin for quite sometime. its not necessarily the pumpkin as much as it is all that comes with that. the pumkin spice, ginger, nutmeg, cinnamon and other spices make for a great paring with the beer flavoring. i do a bit of home brewing and i try and make a batch of pumkin ale every fall- though i don't always landed a knockout blow on taste the smell is always amazing. i have a bit of practiceing to do. (anyways back to the weyerbacher). the pumpkin ale by weyrbacher is a great one- the flavor is very spicy and complex. the smell is of delicious spices. the only complaint i have is there is a pretty powerful alcohol taste mixed in, which isn't surprising due to its 8.0% alcohol content. that being said, its still one of the best pumpkin ales out there."
"Beer is thinner than expected although now that I know it's 8% my respect for it goes up a little, very little. Beer is mildly sweet with a slight lingering aftertaste but that is most likely due to how damn dry the finish is. I can actually taste a little pumpkin in here, that's very cool. For a pumpkin ale, it's OK. Pretty good in fact. I'm not a huge style but I give them a go every year. This is one of the better ones in my opinioin. I would cautiously have this again."
"D: Dangerous, because it's delicious. Not a heady brew, so beware if you drink more than one. Pairs well with a lot of fall foods. Pork, chicken, desserts, etc."
"Poured from 12 oz bottle into dimpled glass. Pours a minimal tan head over an amber body with orange hues. Good, coating lace. Nose is wheat, clove, subtle spice. Same flavors with very mild notes of pumpkin and cinnamon. Mild/medium carbonation and medium body. This is a decent beer and the spices are down-played, which is a hindrance from the flavor in itself. One of my top pumpkin beers."
"An interesting pumpkin beer; I have had better and I have also had far worse. This is a bit too spicy for me, but I would not label it as a """spice bomb.""""
"D: This isn't incredibly balanced but is definitely one of the better pumpkin ales."
"Pours dark copper/mahogany with thin off-white head. Some sediment in the suspension. I can smell the spice from the glass: cinnamon, clove and nutmeg. Taste is sweet with a maltiness that is reminiscent of pie crust (slightly over-baked). A little bitterness as well. Not cloying whatsoever. Medium bodied with a sticky texture and fizzy. Overall, this is a nice pumpkin ale."
"Thick and murky brown colored brew, small tan head proves to be fleeting. Scent is a major pumpkin smell, along with some spicy cinnamon. Light buscuity malt front is pretty much controlled by the overriding pumpkin. A couple different christmas spices. Alcohol is blended but present. Medium bodied, fairly wet, a bit sharp. One of the better pumpkins i've had."
"HV"
"D - Good tasting pumpkin gritty at first but smoothed a brew that I would have again. I recommend this brew"
"D- Too sweet and spicy for me. Easy to drink one."
"We have tried several of the pumkin brews this fall, and Weyerbacher is indeed the best of the best. Most of the pumkins we have tried this fall short on flavor, and are primarily focused on that sweet spicey kick. This Beer is a strong full flavored very dark brew, not too bitter with a clean finish."
"I'm not usually a big fan of the Pumpkin Ales but this was very tasty. The flavor was strong and it was very easy to drink."
"When the beer was poured into a pint glass, i didn't have a lot of head to it, but a nice amber color body and a thin white lace around the edge of the body. The aroma of this beer of roasted pumpkin pie spices. The taste is unbelievable, the taste of the clove, allspice and nutmeg with a hint of cinnamon and the balance of the malts and pumpkin is very well done. It has a great mouth feel and is very smooth off the tongue and is very drinkable."
"D: This is very good. Not quite the best of the style, but it's up there."
"A big pumpkin ale that is well crafted and delicious. Pours a very clear orangey brown with a long lasting khaki head that leaves a decent amount of lace on the sides of my glass. Smell is full of pumpkin and spices. There is a good amount of bready sweet malt as well. Balanced taste is the hallmark of this one. It starts with pumpkin pie and flows seamlessly into a firm herbal bitterness. A nice crystal malt center gives a bready roundness and full ale taste. Spices bracket the pumpkin a with the cinnamon in the front and the nutmeg giving a fullness to the flavor. A touch of alcohol shows itself and fades away. Finish is dry and clean with a lingering hop leafiness. Feel is crisp and well carbonated. Medium weight and quite supple. Very drinkable with a well integrated alcohol that never gets your attention so the next thing you know your smiling a whole lot. Good stuff"
"Overall: This is a solid seasonal offering, and it is one of the best pumpkin beers. The flavor of pumpkin is restrained in this beer, the emphasis is placed on the spice. In other words, if you eat pumpkin pie for the taste of pumpkin, you may not like this beer. If, however, you enjoy spice and balance, this beer has those qualities in spades."
"D: I need a cold night and a hot fire to enjoy this one. While the flavor is great initially, the spices (particularly the cardamom) become unmanageable, making the Imperial Pumpkin Ale a sipper. A very slow sipper. One glass is more than enough for me."
"Overall: would not have again."
"Not generally a huge fan of pumpking beers, but this wasn't bad at all."
"special thanks to tubdog13 for the care package that had this in it."
"Drinkability: Pretty poundable as far as flavor and mouthfeel but they would probably catch up to me on bottle number four or five ABV wise."
"Overall a pleasant beer. Not on the same level as a Southern Tier Pumpking or Hoppin Frog, but I'm honestly thinking this bottle may be a year old and has lost a lot of the pumpkin character as a result. That said, this is still a great brew in its own right. Hats off to weyerbacher - well done."
"It's definitely not a bad brew - many of my friends swear by it - I just think that there are better choices out there."
"At 8%, this, first-and-foremost, is not a beer you can spend a full night drinking and feel good the next morning. Secondly, with its spiciness-on both its aroma and its taste- it's a beer that's tough to imagine drinking several of. Although, I will say, since it's warmed up, the medicinal edge has worn off, at least making it easier to drink. With that all said, again, it's hard to imagine drinking this beer all night. A well made beer? Sure. Flavorful? Definitely. But one that I'd want to drink all night? Not really. Best that it's like the Pie of it's chief ingredient; enjoyed seasonally and sparingly."
"medium body, higher carbonation. one of the better pumpkin beers, but the heavy spices limit the drinkability. good fall or even christmas beer. don't notice the 8%abv."
"This thing rocks. If you are looking for a pumpkin ale that is pretty interpretive of a pumpkin pie, you really can't miss with this!"
"D: It is a stronger version of a pumpkin ale but it has a seasonal appeal and I was in the mood for it so it went down well. That being said I could not session this beer though, it has too much clove, nutmeg and spice."
"D -- Honestly, this is one of the best pumpkin ales I have had. The warm feeling it leaves you with makes you want to come back for more. I think you can sit back and drink several in a sitting. Awesome fall drink."
"Recommended if you like Pumpkin Ales..."
"A very nice pumpkin ale. Well executed and easy to drink."
"Pours a dark copper color, with an inch of creamy tan head and light lacing. Great spicy aromas on this pumpkin ale - cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, and ofcourse pumpkin. This is my favorite tasting pumpkin ale on the market, follows right in line with the smell but to a greater extent. Its more of a """spicy""" pumpkin, but I find the pumpkin flavor shows its face plenty in this ale. A nice, creamy mouthfeel and moderate carbonation makes this my favorite beer in the style. A big enough pumpkin ale, that I can really only enjoy 1 of these in a night, hence the lower drinkability score. Great seasonal offering from Weyerbacher - highly recommended."
"pours a slightly hazy copper brown color with a quickly dissipating head that settles to a fresh tan collar.... smell is Vienna malts,spice,and pumpkin bread,and cinnamon stick ..taste is very spicy..meaning its lots of cinnamon and nutmeg more so than pumpkin but its present in a bread like manner malts hit the back of the mouth for a sweet finish..mouth feel is medium i dont detect 8% but i dont taste lots of pumpkin either..overall pretty tasty easy to drink and one ill have every fall but thats it..a tasty pumpkin ale from a great brewery"
"D - easily one of the better pumpkin beers I have had. Most pumpkin beers are spicy, but also a little watery. This one packs a nice nutmeg punch that is anything but subtle."
"Full-bodied. I exepcted it to be even more punchy as an """Imperial""" Ale, but it's fairly calm for that label (not in bad way). Went well with a stew of keilbasa sweet potatoe, apples, and onion."
"Overall: Good beer overall. Not my favorite pumpkin ale but you could do much worse. I wouldn't mind having a few more this autumn."
"Really good pumpkin ale, among the best I've had."
"D: I hate the feeling of having my hopes dashed. I expected great things after taking a whiff, but the flavor didn't follow through. I'm not mad, Weyerbacher. I'm just disappointed."
"M/D - Medium body with a big mouthfeel (good carb, noticeable ABV). Finishes quite neutral with some sweetness and some bittering. Great flavor profile makes it easy to drink."
"I've noticed the quality varies here and there - depending on the batch, I suppose. It can be a wide spread, too, because I've had this end up being revelatory one time and out-of-whack another. When it's good, though, it's real good."
"This was a pretty good surprise."
"Feel is creamy, but overly spiced. Great taste, but a bit bitter and overly spiced to be highly drinkable."
"Taste has lots of toasted caramel with the sweetness and spicing playing nicely off each other. Has more oomph than a regular pumpkin brew, but not over the top as say, a Pumking. Nice gourdy flavors shows through on this one and the ABV is very well hidden. It is a tasty brew, I'd probably put this in my top 5 pumpkin beers, well done Weyerbacher."
"D - At 8%, you notice this stuff going down, as the alcohol isn't terribly well disguised. A tasty beer but not one you'll want to drink all evening."
"D- This is not a top tier pumpkin beer. It is enjoyable, but I find this to be more spicy than anything else. The alcohol presence does not belong, and they should have just made a pumpkin ale. It could have been so much better with just a label change and alcohol reduction. I probably won't ever search this one out again."
"Pours a somewhat hazed orange color with a light head and a bit of lacing. The nose is fairly balanced between pumpkin sweetness and some fall spicing, although the sweetness tilts ahead in the end. The taste brings a lot more pumpkin sweetness with some cinnamon, nutmeg, and clove in the background. A bit faint. Mouthfeel is medium and a tad bit cloying. Drinks pretty well, although I hope it'll mellow a bit with some age."
"M/D: Medium bodied, with decent carbonation. Left my mouth a little on the dry side. Had high hopes for this beer and it left me a bit dissapointed. Its ok, but nothing special, seemed a bit weak in flavors."
"I think this one is worth seeking out, especially if you don't usually like pumpkin beers that are too sweet or too chocked full of spices."
"D-Pretty high considering the ABV, but I feel let down by pumpkin beers in general, and this one falls into that category unfortunately."
"Very drinkable. Doesn't go overboard in any direction, and the alky warmth is nothing close to oppressive. Easily the 2nd best pumpkin I've had to date, easily slotting ahead of Dogfish Head, but still a half notch behind the incredible Hoppin Frog version."
"A very solid Pumpkin Ale"
"Drinkability: One of the better pumpkin beers I have had this year. This one is pumpkiny without being overly so. i can feel the alcohol. I would get this again. A nice surprise."
"I poured into a pint glass to an inch of light tan head. This beer is burnt orange in color. The aroma is definitely spicy. Nutmeg seems to lead the pack. The taste is some pumpkin up front and then the spices take over. As with the smell, the nutmeg seems dominant, although I can taste cinnamon, too. I also get whiffs of alcohol on the senses. It has a medium mouthfeel. It's a pretty good beer. I can think of two in this style that I like a lot better."
"D - One of the better ones. You can taste the ABV which gives it a smooth kick."
"Wow! It looks like fall, smells like fall, and tastes like everything I expect from a pumpkin ale. This beer is very well balanced between the malt, pumpkin, spices, and hops. Definitely in the top tier of the pumpkin ales I've tasted. Highly recommended!"
"from my comments you can tell i wont get this beer again the allspice was to powerful if they toned that down flavors may pop more and then they may have a good beer"
"Drinkability - For any pumpkin ale, it is a beer that you normally do no session. This is no exception. However, for such a high ABV, this beer disappeared rather quickly. I'm liking the heavy spices and really wish I had some pumpkin pie to eat with this because it sure feels like I'm drinking some! Pumped I was able to try this and scratch it off my wants list!"
"Very good beer, just the right amount of pumpkin flavor and very smooth for being 8%ABV. I am trying to find many pumpkin beers to try, but I have a limited selection where I am. Weyerbacher is similar to """Pumpking""" from Southern Tier. I like this style for the fall, can't drink these as a session beer."
"This is a must try for the fall!"
"Bit carbonated. No alcohol noticeable. Very smooth and would make a good nice capper or dessert beer."
"This is a really nice pumpkin ale, one of my favorites. Pours a nice copper orange color with moderate off-white head. Smell is deliciously spicey with cinnamon and nutmeg, followed up with some nice pumpkin aroma. Taste mirrors the nose, big spices, big pumpkin. Delicious stuff. Sometimes it comes across as a hair boozy. Moderate mouthfeel, coating. A good drink, definitely a seasonal specialty that hits the spot."
"Another great brew by the people at Weyerbacher. I have a few more that I'll be holding on to throughout Fall and Winter to help warm up in the PA cold!"
"D: For an 8% ABV beer, it should be sipped, but very tasty and goes down smoothly."
"Drinkability: Its a good one, but not nearly as good as ST's Pumking which sets the bar high for imperial pumpkin beers."
"D-I could drink 2 or 3 which is more than I can say for other pumpkin beers that are either too sweet or lack flavor"
"A very well-balanced, well-executed pumpkin ale. Pumpkin and spice contribute, but don't dominate, which is a nice change of pace. Very nice."
"D- This pumpkin ale is good. The flavors are crisp and clean with this not being overly sweet like some pumpkin ales I have had. The ABV is higer but well hidden which means you can get into trouble with this one. Was glad to have gotten two of these bad boys in my package!"
"Maybe I picked up some bad stuff but this kind of doesn't taste like beer. It looked and smelled awesome and then turned into something else. I think I'd take a Pumpking or even a Post Road Pumpkin over this"
"I call shenanigans on this beer. Shenanigans! I have one bottle left and it's getting poured over a ham. Better than down my throat."
"Drinkability: The imperial pumpkin drinks smoothly, considering the strength and amount of spice. It's very addictive - one of the best pumpkin ales out there."
"This is a nice pumpkin all, no single taste or aroma is overbearing and it's well balanced. Probably the best pumpkin ale i've had this season."
"Drinkability - For an imperial pumpkin ale weighing in at 8%, it's pretty damn drinkable! The taste is OK, though. I'd drink this one again, but If I had a choice I'd have to pick other pumpkin offerings over this one."
"D- a great pumpkin ale that may get to me after awhile; the style in general has medium drinkability for me; alcohol is really well hidden and for this pumpkin it's the opposite of most in the style...the taste is more pronounced and bolder than the smell"
"This is a medium bodied brew that is moderately carbonated. This isn't my favorite style of beer but I still keep trying them since it's that time of the year."
"Poured a translucent reddish color with a thick tan head, with much lacing. Smell is of pumpkin and spices. The taste is very rich with pumpkin and pie-like spices, a near perfect balance between the two. No alcohol presence was detected, despite the 8% ABV. This is one of the fullest and tastiest Pumpkin Ales I've had. Mouthfeel was good, very lively and refreshing. Drinkability was OK, but lots of alcohol and real rich taste for me makes this a one at a time beer to sip and savor. For Pumpkin, it doesn't really get any better than this."
"drinkability: this one has everything a pumpkin ale should have without overdoing it in any particular aspect, the abv is up there, but still very drinkable."
"D: Easy drinker; no cloying spice or sweetness. I prefer Punkin, Pumpking or Bruery Autumn Maple to this brew."
"D - A good pumpkin beer but a little heavy on the spices."
"Nice dryness to the finish with characteristics of brown sugar. Mouth feel is surprisingly thin. Somewhere the 8 percent ABV is hiding in here, but I am not sure behind what."
"D - One is great, 2 is good, 3 too many"
"D - This is a good offering amongst pumpkin brews, but not quite a standout."
"The carbonation is good but the body is just a touch watery for me. However, it's refreshing and finishes with lingering spice and sweet malt. I like this beer and would drink it again, but I'm not sure it'll be a yearly thing. This year I'm really steering clear of the pumpkin beers for the Oktoberfests, and, while this is well crafted, it's just nothing new."
"Good pumpkin ale to try but not one to invest in."
"I buy this in season - even my girlfriend likes it. So that tells you something! Love this seasonal! I love Weyerbacher!"
"D: If you like pumpkin, look elsewhere. But if you like spice beer (I happen to like cinnamon A LOT), this might be your bag. A pumpkin ale...it is not."
"This is top of the line in nearly every way. Possibly Weyerbacher's best beer, this really is a fall treat. Is it the best out there? No, but it is really close. Easily in the top 5 of the style."
"D: I solid beer and I probably liked it a little more than my final score reflects. IMO the flavor is not quite what I'm looking for in a pumpkin ale. A good brew nonetheless."
"DB- Nice flavor, for some reason the alcohol makes me care about the strong spice less. Still wish these pumpkin beers would taste more like fresh pumpkin. The flavor gets tiring, decent fall beer."
"This is a sipper of a pumpkin ale, and while I have far from tried them all, this remains my favorite. Recommended."
"Grab one and enjoy!!!"
"D- 8.00% is invisible in this. Very easy drinking. Spices are there but nowhere near overpowering. My second ever pumpkin beer and my new favorite!"
"Pours reddish-pale amber in body topped by creamy off-white head. Smells of spices, nutmeg, cinnamon, burnt pumpkin pie crust, and booze. Flavors of spice that leans towards cinnamon, burnt sugars, cloves, pumpkin, booze, mouthful of spice towards the end. Heavy in body with medium carbonation. An imperial pumpkin that is too big for its own good. Like a spoonful of cinnamon, this beer closes up the throat a bit. All frosting and no pie."
"For me, this is the pumpkin beer that all others are measured against. A true feat."
"D - once this 4pk is finished, I'll be done with this until next year if I decide to try it again. One bottle per sitting is enough for me. There isn't enough pumpkin to go with the spice, or there's too much spice to go with the hint of pumpkin. Worth a try, but this pumpkin ale didn't exactly blow me away."
"Notes: Had this on tap a couple of days earlier and it seemed much better then but unfortunately I didn't get a review down."
"Overall a fun sipper on a cold 'fall' night...at least a night that feels like fall."
"This one is a spice overload, which I didn't recall from the past. I also didn't pick up the strong vanilla flavors I've come to love in this beer. Nonetheless, still one of the best pumpkin ales out there."
"D: No thanks. Just not for me. To each his own."
"Pours from the 12 oz. bottle a bold copper color with a one finger, slightly off-white one finger head that quickly dissipates into a fairly thick collar. Carbonation is on the heavy side, with the head making a fizzy sound as it fades. Aroma is spicy! The cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves jump right out at you! First sip is a smooth blend of pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves...basically a mirror image of the aroma. The combination of spice lingers after the swallow. Hops pretty much take a back seat here, this one's all pumpkin-y malt & spices, but done well...quite well, in fact!. Mouth feel is bold and spicy, with a nice sparkle on the tongue and the alcohol being totally hidden. This is a beer that is quite drinkable. Overall, if you like pumpkin beer (which I do), this one is quite the stellar example of the style. If you dropped a scoop if ice cream into it, you'd truly have pumpkin pie in a glass!"
"The mouthfeel is a bit above medium bodied with carbonation being moderate. Drinkability is pretty decent, it had some good flavors to it overall. It was definitely a spice forward beer, but they were pretty nicely done. Could have used some more pumpkin flavor and less spice to it though for my tastes."
"Pours an orangish amber color with a one finger white head which gives way to some lacing. The aroma has a nice pumpkin smell with hints of nutmeg and cinnamon and a slight clove. The taste is of a bread malt backbone with a nice pumpkin flavor along with cinnamon and nutmeg. Not the best pumpkin beer taste but solid. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Overall its a solid beer and its very drinkable but its not the top pumpkin beer but close."
"D: I felt this beer was okay but one was enough for me. I thought the beer smelled like pumpkin pie, but then something about the flavor was not right when I tasted it. I don't mean to say I think the beer was bad just that the clove was too much for me. On a final note abv. 8% but the taste of the alcohol is well hidden. If you like Pumpkin ales this one is worth a try."
"d - A pretty good pumpkin ale that is heavy on the spices. I enjoyed the cinnamon in the smell, but may have liked it a little better if the taste was more pumpkin, or sweeter, than spice. Still a good pumpkin ale I have had before and will have again."
"Bottom line: Imperial and pumpkin just seems right. This brew's bark may be bigger than its bite, but it will still gnaw your knuckles off."
"D - I may just pick up a four pack. It's quite good and a great representation of the style. AND IT'S NOT HOPPY! JOY!"
"Drinkability: Overall, it seems like a nice Old Ale that has been enhanced and elevated by pumpkin and spices. The end result is a very strong Pumpkin Ale that simply entices me to drink more."
"Still the lesser of the 2."
"This beer is a little darker than most pumpkin ales I have tasted.. Smells of cinnamon and nutmeg are present.. Smells just like pumpkin pie is being baked..Taste is more cinnamon and spices than it is off pumpkin..Can taste the cinnamon aftertaste but it is not terrible. Could probably drink a couple before getting filled up..A great beer may have to get a case of this next year if not better than the ST Pumking I am picking up Saturday.."
"The key to this successful pumpkin ale is that they don't overdo the pumpkin pie sensation others seem to like to produce..yeah I'm talking about you DFH. This still hasn't won me over to the style though."
"Medium carbonation is nice, and medium low body. 8% ABV booziness is hidden well. I pretty much don't care for many fruit beers, so I enjoyed this much more than I expected too. Probably wouldn't be too interested in having a second bottle in one sitting though, maybe unless it was Thanksgiving and this was the only beer sitting around. It paired really nicely with good sharp ginger snap cookies for an after-dinner desert."
"Pours a rich, clear amber with a vast fluffy, flowery head. The aroma is sharp and warm and spicy, more like a mulled cider than anything else. There is cinnamon and clove and a high, crisp ginger aroma. The flavor is round and malty and spicy - clove, nutmeg, and ginger. There is a spicy cinnamon burn on the finish that coats the tongue. There is a little sourish edge that hurts the finish a bit, but still this feels like fall. The mouthfeel is surprisingly creamy."
"D: I dont mind the onslaught of spice, but the boozy twang affects drinkability in regards to this particular style. There is plenty of flavor here to hide 8%, so Im a bit surprised."
"2010 edition. Sampled on September 7, 2010. The pour is a much darker than expected copper-amber tone with a thin but long lasting off-white head ring. The aroma is powerful with pumpkins and fall baking spices like nutmeg, coriander, and clove. The taste emphasizes the spices over the pumpkin but there is also a molasses-like dark sweetness going on. A very vibrant brew."
"For sure it's a strong beer- 8.0 ABV- you'll know it. Not something I think I could drink a whole lot of but me enjoying a pint on the porch when the leaves start changing is almost a certainty."
"This beer is a deep ruby red with about a finger of just off white head. It recedes a little bit leaving a ring around the outside of the glass. It smells strongly of cloves, with some of the malt and pumpkin sweetness coming through. The other spices that are used (cinnamon, nutmeg, etc.) don't seem to come through as much. The beer tastes like Halloween, a holiday mainly composed of cloves, nutmeg, and pumpkin with malt, and a hint of cinnamon. Unfortunately the mouthfeel comes up pretty thin for me. It has good drinkability, but would probably be better if I had had it in October or November instead of the beginning of September (I won't fault the beer because I did not have the good sense to wait to drink it)."
"All in all, I like this brew. One of the best pumpkin beers I have had to date. I'd say if you want a good pumpkin beer, then definitely grab one of this and give it a try."
"D: A nice smooth Imperial Pumpkin, easy to drink but I wouldn't have more than a couple. A solid pumpkin ale."
"D- Nose with the style are great combinations!!"
"Ammendment - my quest never seems to find a better pumpkin ale. This is the one for me!"
"An enjoyable and well done take on a pumpkin beer. This is probably the spiciest pumpkin beer out there and I would put this in my top two to date. Really well hidden eight percent abv."
"Not too much spice, it is a sharper, less sweet version though with more robust flavors then somthing like pumpking. Drinkability is very high and abv is nearly undetectable."
"Pours an amber color producing about a half inch of head before quickly dissipating. The smell is what makes this beer. I don't quite sense the cinnamon nearly as much as I smell the nutmeg and cloves. It immediately reminds me of Autumn and the smells of the upcoming holidays. It tastes like...well, pumpkin pie in a glass. It is loaded with spices and it has a huge cinnamon, nutmeg and clove taste and is fairly well carbonated. It is very light and goes down very easily. I couldn't drink this all year but it certainly fits into the Autumn season."
"D- this is a very good pumpkin ale that is well balanced and delicious"
"As far as pumpkin beers go Weyerbacher, in usual fashion, make this one big. Dark amber. Good retention. Nice cream lace that looks to last. Nutmeg, cinnamon and a touch of alcohol in the nose. Taste is good. Pretty standard, but the cardoman adds a little something different to this one. Kind of unique. Alcochol is also present on the tongue. Pretty well blends with the malt and spices. Very drinkable. Bubbly tingle on the mouthfeel. Finishes a little dry. Nice."
"M/D: smooth, spices give a sort of tingle along with the carbonation which makes for a very easy drinking beer."
"D - This is not a beer I want to drink a bunch of. The flavors are excellent and this is a finely crafted brew, but just a little too much for me to enjoy constantly."
"pours a deep, hazy amber with a little less than a finger of off white head... not much retention; some lacing. a good but by no means great appearance. the aroma, however, is A-one, outstanding, and really well captured in the wineglass: nice, fresh pumpkin accompanied by strong notes of cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, maybe some ginger... wow, this is the smell i look for in my pumpkin ales - IMO they nailed it. that said, i feel the flavor takes a step back; maybe the nose raised expectations too high... still very nice, with the pumpkin and spices pulling through, but perhaps not as robustly as the nose had led me to believe; there's also a not entirely pleasant though subtle bitterness to it, as well as a bit a boozy bite to the finish. again though, a damn tasty pumpkin beer... medium bodied mouthfeel... overall, a nice representation of the style and well worth a revisit, but i'll work my way around some others first."
"D/M: Crisp and bubbly. It has a great filling flavor but it sticks to palate and makes it hard to change to a different beer."
"D - Pretty drinkable. A slight boozy taste is the only thing holding this back. Pretty similar to pumpkin pie. This is my first pumpkin beer of the season and I can't wait for more!"
" Pours a deep Hazy ruby-orange , with some nice off-white foam. Huge pumpkin pie spice aromas, cinnamon, clove and nutmeg.The flavor is much of the same, with an abundance of pumpkin pie flavors, along with some brown sugar sweetness, a little caramel and some warming alcohol which helps balance things out a little. I wasn't a fan of pumpkin beers too much, but this one is probably the best I've had, so far. I have been told to try DFH and Southern Tier. Now to just hunt them down."
"I wanted to try this one last year (not sure why I didn't), and it's now my number 3 pumpkin beer."
"I typically don't like Weyerbacher...and I only just began to like pumpkin ales so here we go. This beer has a very nice color, orange to reddish amber with a two finger head that fades to a white ring around the glass. Aroma is spicy, the cardamom is strongist, then a good bit of clove followed by the rest. No real pumpkin in the aroma. Flavor is a nice fall thing. Good malt backbone, spices and yeah for sure pumpkin is in the flavor. Kinda sharp, light on the hops, good. Great body though, thick rich, great carb for the style probably my favorite part of the beer. I could do like two of these."
"D: A little on the heavy side, and the potent side (8% abv). But overall, a good pumpkin ale. Since this was my first pumpkin ale,(never really like the idea of a pumpkin ale at first) I might end up judging others based on this. But only those that are of the imperial variety."
"Good example of the style."
"d) I really love this beer...nice slow drinker...to be enjoyed and savored"
"D - Alcohol is hidden well. Not a bad pumpkin beer, but not my favorite. Had me feelin good before I went out to party."
"will hit you."
"Cheers..."
"D - A very yummy, spicy brew, that I imagine gets even better as the weather cools. Lots of big flavors and akthough 8% isn't terribly high, it's a smooth drink, and a few could go down quick."
"D: This is a very enjoyable brew and would be great with a holiday meal...but it's great on it's own too"
"D-I am a big fan of pumpkin beers and could easily have another of these"
"eh. drinks ok. I would rather a bit more beer in this beer."
"D= nice but not one I'd have more than one at a sitting."
"ouch, that was hard. i wanted so badly for this to be a great beer! but i do understand that its me and my issue with cardamom so by all means if you like pumpkin beer...give it a shot! why the hell not!!"
"Stock up on this one!"
"D: Slightly uneven in spots, but still a drinkable beer."
"D- very disappointing, because it started so well. A little too much with the spices, and the texture absolutely killed the beer for me"
"The only thing I do not like about the mouthfeel on this beer is the carbonation, it is a bit too much and somewhat prickly on the tongue. This does go down smooth and I would place it among the better pumpkin beers I have had, but that's not saying much since good ones are few and far between. Overall this was a good beer but a bit pricey. Would I buy this again...maybe."
"Drinkability -- Not awful, but not thrilling. The bubblegum taste threw me off the entire way. The spice is on point, but most everything else is a bit distracting. However, I'm willing to revisit this in it's proper season (i.e., NOT AUGUST!)"
"D: I would definitely try this beer again because it is easy to drink and has a good balance between the flavors."
"D- While its stronger on alcohol than many other pumpkin ales its still nothing that gets in the way. A bit of a stiffer drink is what you might want on a cool autumn evening anyway. This one has changed my mind on pumpkin ales and will be stocking my fridge for the coming months."
"Really has a beautiful reddish brown color that has a huge 2 finger foamy head with excellent lacing. Has a beautiful Spicy pumpkin, clove, cinnamon and nutmeg aroma. Really inviting. Taste is a bit dull, might be the fact that I am drinking this on a hot night and it's not fall. Lacking body, though it does have some great complexities of sweet pecans, dry figs and bitter cinnamon. Mouthfeel is a tad thin also as I was expecting a much heavier brew. Really an easy drinking beer though and would be a great addition to some light gamey meals and of course turkey. Really a great effort."
"One of my all time favorite beers."
"Drinkability- so dangerously drinkable and enjoyable, this beer does great job of being balanced and making you want to have more and more, alcohol is well hidden to the extreme, i very enjoyable pumpkin ale for sure"
"D: Very easy to drink this beer in the fall (duh). Although it has a higher ABV, I can enjoy more than one in a sitting."
"Weird stuff. Ultimately, pretty decent, but I don't ever need another. And I really wonder why people would want to drink this around Halloween. Really. Wonder."
"D. The alcohol is content to hide in the background making this a supremely drinkable beer. I plan to pick up a few six packs of these this fall to celebrate the season."
"Pours a deep ruby-orange hybrid color, with some nice off-white foam. Huge pumpkin pie spice aromas--cinnamon, clove and nutmeg. On the palate, much of the same, with an abundance of pumpkin pie flavors, along with some brown sugar sweetness, a little caramel and some warming alcohol which helps balance things out a little. I am not at all a fan of pumpkin beers, but this one is probably the best I've had."
"This is what it says - it is Pumpkin - very much so. It is the liquid/alcohol embodiment of a pumpkin pie. Great, if you like that sort of thing."
"I'm pleased with Weyerbacher's take on style, and I would gladly take down a six pack each autumn season."
"Drinkability: I love pumpkin beers, but this one could use more pumpkin flavor and a little less spices. I'd drink this again, but still prefer the ST Pumking as my favorite pumpkin beer."
"This is a damn fin pumpkin ale, and dangerously drinkable for its weight. The peripherals were well-done, but the smoothness and balance of the flavour blew me away. Its certainly in the pumpkin pie mold of this style, so if that appeals to you then Weyerbacher is an excellent pick."
"Very tasty, very interesting. While I love a solid pumpkin ale imperial versions like this one actually seem more drinkable to me which could be a dangerous thing. ;-)"
"Like this one. On of my favorite pumpkin brews. Maybe because of the alcohol and the cardamom."
"Beer looks a bright, kind of hazy orange, with a creamy head. I attempt to carve the glass, but am stopped by the bartender, who politely reminds me that this is a beer and not an actual pumpkin, though i still check inside for seeds. The smell hits me with the pumpkin flavour right away, then the ginger, nutmeg, coriander and all the other wonderful aromas that we associate with Nana's homemade pumpkin pie. The taste does not disappoint, and when one considers the ABV it becomes patently obvious that Weyerbacher has created a pumpkin brew is a head above the rest. The pumpkin flavour is still present and pleasant, and all the other previously mention spices are hanging out as well, throwing a thanksgiving party in my mouth. The high ABV does not make this beer any less wonderful at all. This was not a case of someone simply """alcoholing up""" an already existing recipe, the alcohol is barely noticeable, and the full feeling of the flavours makes this an incredibly enjoyable experience."
"D - It started out great and suffered mildly otherwise. Not for being bad at all, but for not living up to the aroma. It feels too thin and spicy to be an imperial. The body could use a bit of work but if you paired it with a pumpkin pie, it would be great. Good drinkability for an 8% beer though."
"I'm not a big fan of Pumpkin ales but the imperial caught my eye and I had to have a glass of it. It's a little more pumpkinny than I like so it was a little hard to drink but I think the higher alcohol by volume may have balanced out a bit. Great color, good carbonation, too much pumpkin in the flavor but might be nice when the weather gets worse,"
"d- goes down very easily, i could have a few of these, this is one of the better pumpkin ales that i've had imperial or otherwise, i'd drink this again for sure."
"Overall supreme drinkabilty. This pumpkin ale could have a place in my fridge year round. This is a true winner."
"Drinkability is pretty good. A good example for the style and the alcohol is not too strong. I'm not sure if I;d say its a session beer just because I feel it be better maybe only having a couple at a time. Overall a pretty nice beer."
"Cheers!"
"D - A very good pumpkin beer but not sure I'd session this. It is very drinkable considering the flavors are balanced and still maintains a great beer flavor with the roasted maltiness."
"Pours a deep orange translucent, very little carbonation, no head. If a pumpkin schnapps existed, this is what it would smell like, pumpkin and liquor. Taste is toasted maltiness mixed with a cinnamon sweetness turning quickly to pumpkins and alcohols. Weyerbacher's got some high octane beers, but sometimes they really taste like it also. That is definitely the case with this one. Finish is a bit rough and thin."
"D: A little on the sweet side for a pumpkin ale, but at 8% ABV not unexpected."
"Drinkability: Something about this beer does not do it for me. The packaging is attractive, a cool pumpkin king charging ahead, but the beer itself is kind of bland."
"The mouth is crisp yet a tad wet. Flavor is of cheap pumpkin, nutmeg, and has a mineral finish that fades out quickly. Not bad here. The alcohol presence is hidden pretty well. I got through this one easily enough. Recommend."
"I think this is a one and done for me. It is big, that is for sure. I am not the biggest pumpkin fan, but I try them all and I can respect this one for being unique in its ways. Thanks Steve for the opportunity to try this one!"
"D - As I said before this beer has a nice mellow pumpkin pie flavor...it's not in your face and it's not hidden either...the 8% is hardly there...a really good pumpkin ale brought to us by Weyerbacher"
"Poured from 12 ounce bottle into Unibroue tulip. Brassy color with off-white head that quickly fades and no lacing. Aroma is of candi sugar, dark molasses and pumpkin spice/pie. Alcohol is well hidden. Pumpkin taste is a touch bland and possibly some flavor was sacrificed for a higher alcohol content. Review is based on a fresh beer, perhaps I will need to revisit after a year or so of age, but overall a great beer, even fresh."
"I just downed 3 of these and a glass of Rombauer ZIN. My review may reflect my state of mind... that being said, this review is FROM THE HEART! This brew is fantastic, yet don't get hung up on a particular flavor from this over year to year. With DogFish, I see consistency... this bre is equal in quality over the years, yet subtle essences seem to change."
"A nice middle ground between the Dogfish and Southern Tier pumpkin ales."
"Warm copper color with a rocky, off-white head that falls away quickly leaving some lace clinging to the edges of the glass. Smell is faint compared to other pumpkins I've had lately and primarily spice with cinnamon and nutmeg taking the lead. Great flavor on this one with the spiciness being held in check by a creamy, sweetness almost like whipped cream on pumpkin pie. The fruit and sweetness come first with nutmeg and cinnamon following and leading into a light hop-derived drying finish. Feels a bit sticky in the mouth and a semi-low carbonation doesn't help issues but decent nonetheless. This is one of the more palatable pumpkins I've found and I'd recommend it for those who aren't crazy about the super spiciness of some other offerings. Very good beer in general, let alone a pumpkin beer."
"Bigger body than the other pumpkin beers I've had. The carbonation level is just as lively, without being disruptive. A pretty solid pumpkin ale, I'd place it between Ichabod and Smuttynose."
"Poured a clear orange body with decent head that had a spicy, cinnamon and pumpkin smell along with some sweet malts. Taste the spice but has a great sweet balance of cinnamon, nutmeg and pumpkin that goes down easy. AS usuall weyerbacher brews a excellent pumpkin ale,this is my #2 Pumpkin ale everyone should try this"
"D - Very nicely balanced and drinkable. I love pumpkin ales and this is one of the few that is big on pumpkin pie taste, but also on balance. The 8% ABV is very well hidden as well. It's a big beer all around, so the pumpkin pie flavors could get overwhelming after a couple."
"When you're working with a handful of highly seasoned spices, an extra few doses of alcohol and a not so overly appetizing squash as your flavour base, it's easy to screw things up. This beer could have turned out to be a giant disaster but it didn't. Much to the contrary, this is one of the finer pumpkin ales I've come across. Recommended."
"Poured a cloudy reddish-copper, with barely any head, and not much lacing. The smell was a surprisingly nice mix of caramel, maltiness, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves. The flavor revealed all of these, dissolving to a spritzy alcohol-laced finish, followed by a warm spicy aftertaste. The mouthfeel was surprisingly spritzy, given the visual lack of carbonation. A nicely spiced fall seasonal."
"I guess I remembered this better than it was this go-around. An above-average pumpkin beer, but then, there are a lot of nasty ones. Worth a shot on a cold night."
"M/D - Good body matches the style. Easy to drink, better than some others in the style but I still haven't found an example I love. Note: This may be a 2008 batch, they offer no dating on their bottle and I got this from a friend in August 2009."
"This is easily in my top three of pumpkin beers. Amber in color with a nice head. Not too much lacing to speak of. Smells of pumpkin spice and sweet malt. Cinnamon and nutmeg dominate the aroma. Lots of spicy flavor. Tart aftertaste. Maybe alittle like cider. Mouthfeel is a bit bigger then most. Overall a great beer. I get it every year."
"Drinkability - I personally find this the best pumpkin ale. It's not overly sweet or generally overdone. Nicely balanced, nicely spiced. An overal well done fall offering."
"This is one of the best beers for the style hands down."
"D - Good if looking for a nice pumpkin beer would search this one out."
"Wine Specialist/$10/4-pack"
"I love the look of this beer in my glass - orange/red in color, very small lacing around the glass, virtually no carbonation bubbles. Taking a big wiff I'm definitely picking up the nutmeg, cinnamon aromas followed with a faint smell of pumpkin, spices definitely dominate the smell. My tongue is picking up everything I was smelling with the addition of carbonation on the front of the tongue. Immediately at the end there's a faint zing of hops followed by a slight boozy warmth (but not much) and the flavors dissipate quickly on the tongue - I would like a little more lingering on my palate. This is a good pumpkin ale and Weyerbacher has done a very good job with this year's batch. Overall, it's not as complex and bready as perhaps a few other pumpkin ales, but still pretty darn good. (The Weyerbacher Thirteen is insanely complex.) I would like a little more bready/chewiness as the mouthful feels a tad more thin than what I'd prefer for this style. Not overly bready or hoppy, it sits in between hoppiness and sweetness, definitely more towards the sweet side. I'm appreciating pumpkin ales more and this is one I could have a few of in one sitting, however, the alcohol will creep up on you quite quickly so beware. Sip and enjoy."
"I am a fan of Weyerbacher but will stick with my many other favorites from this brewery. I have tasted a few other pumpkin ales and do not think this is the best example. However, if you like lots of spice, you may go for this one."
"I couldn't finish this one... Just way too boozy and alcoholic...a shame..."
"Pours a translucent coppery golden-red with a fairly thick yellowish tan head. Aroma is mainly of cinnamon with a hint of pumpkin. Spicy, malty flavor has strong overtone of cinnamon and undertone of pumpkin. Texture is ragged, fizzy and jazzy with a spicy finish."
"Overall, not a huge fan of the style, but a nice beer to try."
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a standard pint glass. It pours a deep clear orange with a moderate white head. The smell is everything you expect from a pumpkin beer-cinamon, nutmeg and cloves. The beer is sweet just like liquid pumpkin pie spice. The brew, for me, is a full bodied sipper. A very sweet beer, IMO a decent dessert beer, but too sweet for me."
"Served in a 13.25 oz tulip. It has a dark orange/ruby color when you hold it up to the light, but when my glass is resting on the dark table, it looks like a dark brown with an orange glow--very impressive. There is a thin tan head atop the beer. Appropriately, it has a strong pumpkin aroma, but there's also some spice in there, maybe cloves? The pumpkin flavor is impressive. It sneaks up on you, starting out slow, and finishing with a flavor that lingers after you swallow. The beer has an average body and carbonation; nothing exceptional but still of high quality. I find this to be a very drinkable pumpkin beer; the only strike against it is that it is on the strong side. A few too many of these could be dangerous."
"Drinkability is high as this beer is smooth, has great aromas and flavors and the alcohol bite is muted in the face of the other flavors. Overall a decent beer. I would rather have a DFH Punkin or a ST Pumking but this beer comes in at third hands down."
"D = Although I find the smell a bit too strong, the mouthfeel really compensates in terms of overall experience and leads to a relatively enjoyable beer to drink."
"Mouthfeel is actually very nice. A little thin, but refreshing, which boosts the drinkability."
"Drinkability: Overall its a pretty good pumpkin ale that I would recommend. However not sure I could drink a good amount of it as the spices are very powerful and the pumpkin isn't always that strong."
"Drinkability is good, as far as pumpkin ales go. 12 oz goes down relatively easily, but I'm not dying to have another. Overall I'd say this is a solid pumpkin ale, but there are others that I'd probably prefer over this one."
"D - Pretty nice; we tasted five different pumpkin beers this evening and this one was the best, and just about the only one that was any good at all. It is a solid, well balanced base beer with pleasant hoppiness. The spices add to the malt, but the beer doesn't depend on them and they aren't over the top. A better than average example of the style."
"The mouthfeel is like sensory overload. Trying to feel all that you smell is taxing. It leaves my cheeks worn out. Halfway through my 12oz pour, finishing seems a daunting task. Though """awful""" would be an unfair label, this serving may prove too much."
"Four ounces of Weyerbacher Imperial Pumpkin Ale with pecan pie would be a very nice autumn holiday dessert, but 12 ounces is a bit much."
"D: Drinks easy enough for 8% but the spices just over power the pumpkin."
"D - I am not a fan of this style. I find too much spice overwhelming. Having said that this is a very nice brew. I may even be able to have two."
"D - This becomes a little much after awhile, but IMO, I sort of want that out of an imperial pumpkin ale."
"D- Would for sure do two bottles of this no problem. Punkin ales are not my thing unless they are done right, besides the other two, weyerbacher is the other. The alc is a bit high hindering drinkability a bit, but you need a bit more abv in pumkin ales to get more flavor from more ingredients. This one is made with care."
"Overall: This is a well done pumpkin beer. worth buying again? ABSOLUTELY!!! There are so many things that is great about this beer: malty, great pumpkin flavor, amazing usage of spices, great body, well balance, a smooth drinking beer."
"I really like this Pumpkin beer from Weyerbacher. One of the better ones i've tried."
"D-Good stuff. Big beer. One or two will suffice."
"Not the most drinkable pumpkin in the world, but that doesn't matter much as I am not a person who can knock back several of those anyway. This beer is easily the best pumpkin ale I've had. Worth trying for any beer fan, even if the style is not to your usual fancy."
"drinkability - surprisingly easy going down for a spicy 'Imperial'."
"overall the best pumpkin beer ive had to date..."
"D- Drinkable but not to much at one time. Leaves a pleasent taste in the mouth."
"Overall, a very nice change of pace in a pumpkin ale that is not just a spicy brown ale. I really like this, it's right up there with DFH Punkin. Southern Tier Pumking is still my favorite and I have yet to taste anything remotely close to its infused, pie crusty flavor. Still, give this a shot it is very good."
"D- I could probably drink two of these and then want to move to something a little less spicy as is usually the case with most pumpkin ales I drink."
"D- The thinness makes this easy but the spice makes it more of a sipping or dessert beer for me"
"Overall this remains a very good pumpkin ale, although in a perfect world I'd like it a bit closer to 6% as I don't think it would lose much flavor. Either way, it's worth a shot."
"D: Pretty darn good. An exceedingly decent pumpkin beer that is sadly not available anywhere near Chicago."
"Service type: tap"
"Drinkability: Normally I love pumpkin beer, but this beer was rather disappointing. Lots of spice, but not a lot of pumpkin. I have read previous reviews on this beer, and it has been said that a bit of aging may tone down the spice and make the beer a bit more balanced. I have a couple of bottles of this, so I hope this is the case. I will be revisiting this beer to see how age affects it, but I don't see myself ordering this one on tap in the future."
"This year's pumpkin ale is absolutely wonderful! Nose of pumpkin spice, mouthfeel of light quenchable, flavourful pumpkin and spices added to the already brewed ale. Even the aftertaste is warming! Yes, the cinamon, nutmeg, cardamon and cloves are gently incorporated into the ale, giving the brew a gentle spice, I enjoy the pumpkins beers most when the spices aren't overwhelming. Also the 8% ABV is a welcoming factor. Wish I had an 08' version to compare side by side!"
"Drinkability: Moderate... While this is the best tasting and smelling of the pumpkin ales, I'm definitely feeling a bit of the 8% ABV so I think if were to try to have more than one of these, it would really have to be spaced out over the course of an entire afternoon/evening. It's a great tasting beer though and perfect for the season, especially that warming aspect as that would be great for a nice cool and crisp autumn evening."
"A really well done pumpkin ale that's not too over-the-top on the spices, but to be honest, the spices are what I like about a pumpkin ale, so this one doesn't really hit the mark for me. Definately good, but I'd like a little more spice. If you're looking for a pumpkin ale that doesn't make you feel like it's liquid pumpkin pie, then this would be a good choice."
"D: The high ABV along with very present spices make this one not as drinkable as a lot of other pumpkins out there."
"Bottle pours a moderate head atop a thick luminescent body of red brick and tree dark color. Nose is full of pumpkin spice. Flavor is largely of the same, with a stronger emphasis on pumpkin spice than cinnamon characteriized by some of its competitors. Not creamy in any way. Has something like a faint spearmint aftertaste that doesnt entirely fit in. It is extremely faint, but doesn't help motivate me to order another."
"D: Perfect for the fall... but I don't think I could do more than 1 or 2..."
"D - Interesting complexity for a pumpkin ale, love the floral ginger"
"D: Although im more a pumpkin pie flavor guy, this is the best spice leaning brew."
"Decent carbonation, pumpkin flavor carries through to the end. Finish is a touch tart and sweet, but finishes ok. This is a strong ale, alcohol-wise, but doesn't possess enough maltiness to be considered an imperial ale."
"Notes: Really nice example of the style, along with ST Pumking this is one of the best that I have had. Weyerbacher is a great brewery."
"D: The 8% ABV is noticable and the alcohol heat might scare off some, as well as the very different taste and smell to this beer. Still, quite enjoyable."
"Full mouthfeel, even carbonation, faint warming. Average drinkability, a little too sweet and perfumey."
"I personally think this ale is much more well balanced (and even more of a beer) than pumpking."
"Morey's Bottom Line: Last year I sampled Dogfish Punkin' and New Holland Ichabod, and I like this better than both of them. Hope to review a Southern Tier Pumking here soon. Cheers!"
"Drinkability-for 8% hell yeah"
"mouthfeel is disgustingly carbonated and hot on the palate. the drinkability may soon breach absolute zero, which will be a breakthrough for science, but a catastrophe for the craft beer industry. with every sip this brew sets back the world of beer at least 10 years in its development. absolutely awful."
"Notes: This is quite a show-off for pumpkin ales. It matches its imperial label rather well and is a pleasure to have and introduce to pumpkin beer skeptics."
"D: I love pumpkin beers, and this one is outstanding. To me, a pumpkin ale is the perfect compliment to a crisp and cool fall day. Weyerbacher crafted a drinkable and flavorfull brew with this one. This is one of the best pumpkin ales I've had."
"D - This is not a beer for guzzling after you've mown the lawn. It would make a terrific after-dinner beer for a holiday event, or a sipper for enjoying during a quiet evening with your better half."
"The 8% was very well hidden--I could have had these all night. I'd certainly be interested in picking up a few bottles of my own."
"An excellent pumpkin ale! Still, the spices and heaviness of the malt tend to keep drinkability at a minimal level."
"Tasting notes: If you love highly spiced ales with Cardamom as I do (my favorite warmer is Snowbound) then you are sure to like this. This is the poster child for the style and is, hands down, the best pumpkin ale I have ever had. Pumpkin ales really should be enjoyed at higher gravities like winter warmers. This really is a treat."
"Final thoughts: Another one of those wicked (yes I'm from MA) overspiced pumkin beers. It's pretty water, spicey, and extract tasting. Another beer from Weyerbacher I'm not very happy about. I should write them and complain! Better yet, I'll start a BA thread!"
"The taste is right on par with the scent. The pumpkin pie filling takes the cake, and is well matched with a slightly roasted biscuit malt taste. More sweet then anything, and the cinnamon comes out very well, with out being too over the top. This beer, like most pumpkin ales, is rather thin which comes as a surprise given the higher then average abv. Regardless, I could drink this all day. This will be my fall beer of choice when in doubt."
"Definitely one of the better, if not the best pumpkin ale I've had. Can't wait to have more of these especially when the leaves start to turn!"
"-Bye"
"This beer pours a reddish-brown color with not much of a head. The aroma is a mix of cinnamon and slight pumpkin. The taste starts off mellow with malt and finishes with a bit of hops and cinnamon and nutmeg. Overall, this beer is nice and is extremely drinkable and I am glad that it is 8%. That being said, there is not really much on the pumpkin side. If you want to try a true pumpkin beer, go with the Southern Tier Pumpking ale...that beer will knock your socks off."
"3.5 D: Good beer, but could have more body to back up the spices."
"Overall, a very great smelling and enjoyable fall beer!"
"Drinkability: I would definitely have another but I would prefer less carbonation."
"Notes: Everything seemed o.k.,but the spices just seemed to stay put on the cinnamon. Perhaps I am missing something here,maybe it was where I got the growler? Who knows,but I will add that this was not a bad beer,just seemed off balance."
"drinkability: horrible pumpkin beer, avergae overall beer."
"CHEERS!!"
"Drinkability is good, this tasting was a bit aged, I would love to try it again with a fresher bottle."
"medium to low carbonation, medium body. a very nice almost creamy mouthfeel. alcohol not really noticeable at all until the very end. very drinkable for a spicy pumpkin beer. i could easily drink these all night. in my opinion, this is a great ABV for the style. also in my opinion, the best pumpkin ale ive had to date, granted this is the first one ive had in months and not one of my most favorite styles, but the similarity to pumpkin pie, is like no other. this is definately a must try for any beer drinker. also, im very impressed with this brewery and what they have to offer, all there beers are very good."
"Good sweet aftertaste, kinda thin, but still a good beer. Tom Barrasso, Larry Murphy, Ulf Samuelsson, and Kevin Stevens were all Penguins."
"One of the better pumpkins around ..."
"D= This ale was the real deal. Though my favorite in the style is ST Pumking and this is not as good as that IMO, its a good choice for those who like pumpkin ale. Well made and dangerously drinkable for the big ABV."
"Drinkability- Lots of evident alcohol and overpowering spice make this one a beer I've had enough of after this first 22 oz. bottle."
"This is one of my favorite pumpkin beers. It pours amber with a very thin head. There is little to no lacing. It smells of nutmeg, cloves and cinnamon. The is easy on the palate and masks the alcohol very well. I feel that it is much better on draught but is still solid from the bottle. I would recommend this to anyone that wants to try a pumpkin beer."
"Tastes of oppressive halloween spices. Spicy aftertaste hangs around for a moment then tastes funky nasty. Some sweet orange candy malt underneath becomes noticeable as the beer warms up. Needs more pumpkin/orange flavor to balance such heavy spice."
"D - Unless halloween, not much there."
"Not a huge fan of pumpkin beers but this is one of the best we've tried. Highly recommended if you need a cardamom fix."
"I like pumpkin ales when they're done right. I like imperial stuff in general. this one hits both notes with great resonance... smooth and drinkable, this one is definitely a winner. It's still a pumpkin ale... if you hate pumpkin beer, this one still isn't for you. If you're on the fence, this just may be the one to tip you."
"Notes: Very pumpkiny, enjoyable and a great october brew."
"This is a beer that insinuates itself in your palate and good graces. It started way over the top with the pumpkin and spices, but mellowed nicely, or at least my sensibilities softened, to really appreciate this beer. It pours a slightly cloudy amber with a touch of orange. The nose is pure pumpkin and what I call a medley of holiday spices. There is a touch of ABV in the nose as well. The beer is fairly medium bodied, slight carbonation, but not much. It begins with a huge blast of pumpkin and this then segues into the spicy notes. Lots of nutmeg, cardoman, cinnamon, some clove. There are some biting hints in the finish, perhaps from some hop, which isn't really a factor. The bite may come from the cinnamon more than any of the other holiday like spices. The beer has some warming booziness, but this is just a robust pumpkin ale if there ever was one."
"it would seem i prefer my pumpkin ales this way: sweeter and spicier. just like the pumpkin bread i ate along with it..."
"Drinkability: A sipping beer given the spice flavors. Probably good for one a night but it was easy to have another the next night. This is an occasional beer that is easy to consume if you like pumpkin pie. But if you don't care a lot for pumpkin pie give this one a pass."
"This beer is much easier to drink than a lot of other pumpkin ales that are way too spiced. The slight alcohol presence is nice, and there's enough carbonation to keep it from getting syrupy. Very drinkable for the style and the ABV."
"Drinkability: Well, I think it is time I admit that I am not a huge fan of pumpkin ales. Always having been a follower of beer seasons, I tend to grab pumpkin ales when I see them, but I think I need to stop that. This is a complex and well done beer, but not for me."
"Out of a bottle his beer was a perfectly clear, cherry wood color. The head was two fingers of tan foam that displayed nice retention as a collar and left solid lacing. The aroma was delicious, strong pumpkins, allspice, nutmeg, some caramel malt and hints of hop bitterness. The flavors were a complex rush like a good NFL defense, first a flash of sweetness quickly followed by a punch of alcohol heat. This then became pumpkin pulp, wood, hints of nuts, nutmeg, cloves and hints of cinnamon all built on a caramel malt backbone. The finish was balanced with enough hops and the overall effect was impressive but not overwhelming. The body was medium, the mouthfeel smooth and the mouthfeel perfect. Once again, a stunning offering from this top-notch operation."
"Taste is exactly like the smell. Pumpkin pie exploads. I wanna throw some cool whip up on it!"
"Drinkability: An interesting concept, but I would like to see more pumpkin flavor to match the spices"
"6/4/4/3/9/2.5"
"8/4/8/4/14 (3.8/5)"
"At any rate, the flavor was delicious, not too overbearing on the spice notes, but they were still forward enough to continue noting them over the course of the pint."
"A very worthy pumpkin ale. Even if you don't like the style, check it out as the spices are balanced and mild."
"Lots of reds and oranges dance in the light. It looks like an Oaked Arrogant Bastard...and that's where the similarities end. This was a tasty treat actually, and I don't usually want to have more than a sample taste of a pumpkin beer. The aroma is heavy with spice, too much so, but I chose to drink this Weyerbacher Imperial Pumpkin because I wanted something a little over-the-top. Well, It delivered, right up my nose. Very spicy on the palate as well. Tongue tingling alcohol mixed with an overspiced pumpkin pie. Lots of nutmeg and cinnamon. Maybe pumpkin pie filling straight from the can. After what seems like a lot of complaining, I actually like this concoction. Not for everyday consumption, but a much better example than most of the easily found Pumpkins on the market. I'd have another next fall."
"Sharp cinnamon, nutmeg, pumpkin aroma. Sharp spicy flavors mirrors aroma, with a mild canned pumpkin taste on a weak malt base. More spice than pumpkin flavors here, too bad. Hazy copper color with a tan head. Light to medium body with a watery texture."
"Overall this beer could be a litte bit less boozy and use some more body. However, it's decent enough for such a big pumpkin beer."
"Bottle. I love this label, that pumpkin seems really pissed, and yet ready to party big time. Pours out a bright amber, almost orange color with a initially large foamy head, that goes down pretty quickly. The aroma is loads of spices, definitely a lot of pumpkins in the nose also. A smooth and warm taste, sweet pumpkin and loads of spices, the nutmeg really stood out. A smooth and medium to thin body. Very enjoyable."
"I did a three-way blind pumpkin ale taste test yesterday with this, Dogfish Head and Smuttynose...this was clearly without question the best of the three....I have all three again today and completely agree with my blind taste test...Dogfish is solid but not close to this one...Smutty doesn't compare..."
"D: For a pumpkin beer, its not bad. The smell is a bit knockout worthy IMO, but the taste is far more subtle. Helps the beer be bearable. I actually thought about having another after this one, so I guess that says something. Not bad and another solid brew from Weyerbacher. Great for the holiday season."
"M/D - Very drinkable for a pumpkin beer. I want to be a fan of the style, but just can't bring myself to it. But this one is definitely one i will have year after year"
"This beer almost perfectly balances the interplay between the pumpkin and the spices. I sense almost no hop presence, no bitterness in the least. The focus is on the malt and pumpkin/spice balance. I've had some pumpkin beers where all you can taste is the spice, completely overwhelming the beer. Not here. The pumpkin taste comes out a little more in the lingering aftertaste, so I look forward to many a pumpkin burp. The high level of carbonation makes this pretty easy to drink. It is a little sticky in the throat, however, detracting a bit from the feel. Overall, one of the better pumpkin beers I've had. The smell is the best part, but the total package will not disappoint."
"Drinkability: A filling beer that goes perfectly with the cold rainy fall nights. Only con, after drinking about two or three, I have had my feel of pumpkin and spices."
"Good sized head, although it is a bit weak in volume. Very strong cinnamon, nutmeg, and clove aromas, which almost overpower the pumpkin flavor. I've toured the brewery and saw this being made. They use REAL pumpkin, so there is some serious flavor here. There is a delightful spice pervading the combination of cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and cardamom. These added spices give a strong chai-like feel to the beer. Perfect with a dessert on a cold winter's night. Weyerbacher has done it again."
"The pumpkin taste is delicious, like pumpkin pie, but leaves the palette quickly and is replaced with a stale aftertaste."
"D: This one is disappearing way too quickly. Excellent beer"
"Drinkability: I really enjoy this - and it's the one I go for come pumpkin season - which I'm not the biggest fan of."
"I guess I stray from the norm here, cause I really could hang out with a 6 pack of this throughout an evening."
"Pours a reddish copper with a thick tan head. Cinnamon, nutmeg, and pumpkin all are present in the nose. The mouthfeel is medium to full-bodied. Spices are apparent in the forefront - cinnamon, nutmeg and cardamon. Pumpkin flavor comes through and combines with a nice malty backbone to create a satisfying fall pumpkin beer. At 8% the alcohol is noticeable a little in the finish, but not over-powering. A pretty decent pumpkin ale that balances the spice and pumpkin flavor nicely with a solid malt presence."
"Slightly bitter flavor, dry like a stick of gum from a pack of baseball cards. Sort of astringent even, not really holding my attention. Earthy vegetal pumpkin note, however the drying finish isn't very pleasant. No malt sweetness, more straight up squashiness. It's ok, not one i'd return to. Pumpking is still the reigning champion."
"Bottle from Capones in Norristown, PA, saved for Halloween. Pours a reddish brown with a short orange-white head. Laces weakly, but in a sticky way. Smells strongly of nutmeg and cloves, as well as a hint of alcohol. Definitely captures the pumpkin pie odor well. Taste is similarly heavy on the cloves and nutmeg, slightly dry, with a bit of a warming alcohol on the back end. Cloves are stronger than perhaps is warranted, but not overwhelming. Mouthfeel is medium-full, and a bit sticky. It does get kind of old as one gets to the end of the bottle. Better to share this one (I did, actually, but my wife didn't like it)."
"Drinkability is high though I wouldn't want to session this beer. It makes a great dessert beer, or as I'm doing a nice finish to a Halloween evening while I watch a Vincent Price movie!"
"Deep coppery orange with a bubbly, creamy head. Heavy spices in the aroma...nutmeg, cinnamon, and ginger over a faded sweet malt base. Fruity, sweet caramel flavor, the spices are much more mellow allowing some hops to come through. Very smooth. Some clove and pumpkin comes through in the finish. Slick creamy body with a bit of warmth. Good, nothing exciting though."
"Goes down nicely ... could drink this all night. If you like pumpkin beers, seek this one out!"
"As a pumpkin beer this would probably score a 3.5-3.7 but as something that I would like to drink I'm thinking 4.3ish. I enjoyed this one a lot."
"Pours with some viscosity noted. Hazed ruby red appearance. Thin beige head. Sparse lace. Great aroma of caramel malts, sweet pumpkin, nutmeg and cinnamon. First thing I notice is a nice full body. Good feel in the mouth. Lightly carbonated and easy to drink, even given the 8% a/v. The alcohol is barely noticed. What is noticed is a nice blend between the malt, pumpkin and spices. The label says cloves are here, but I'm not getting a lot of clove....which is good in my book. I get some earthy nutmeg tones and cinnamon of course. The sweetness of malt and pumpkin blend very nicely. This is one of the better pumpkin beers I've had."
"This is a good example of a beer that needs a few minutes out of the fridge before serving. It helps the smell and taste come thru better."
"Drinkability: I would have a few with no problems. Get these before the season ends! Recommended."
"Yesterday, I was at Wegman's and happened across their Beer and Food Pairing event. They were doing something rather interesting with the Pumpkin Ale... making a float with vanilla ice cream. It was quite a delicious and simple treat. The sweetness of the ice cream quenched the spiciness of the ale just slightly; I was impressed! I would highly suggest giving this a shot."
"Drinkability: Very enjoyable beer. I was not left wanting more flavor and/or spices. Would seek out again next fall."
"D: My favourite pumpkin beer I've ever had, the fact that I can't get this within 2000 miles of me is a crime. Great fall beer."
"Overall: Best pumpkin beer out there I have had (I have not had pumking) this is a good beer and not just a good pumpkin beer."
"Not something I would drink often, but a very fun seasonal, one a season should do it. Well put together package with the label and pie aromas, screams Halloween. Tasty!"
"Serving type: On tap"
"d - solid pumpkin but falls well short of pumking or punkin."
"An interesting brew, being an """imperial""" version of the quintessential American fall brew, but the strong spiciness can be a bit overwhelming and the alcohol can at times be a turn-off. Still, a good beer."
"Not a real heavy imperial but i think the four pack sits about right for a workday night."
"This beer is AMAZING, it's worth spending 20+ dollars on a six pack for the limited releases of it. It is even good flat. You can't buy a better pumpkin beer seriously!"
"D- Light enough to drink quite a few, but I surely wouldn't want too. Awful expensive for such a sub-par brew, I would never purchase again."
"This is one of my favorites in the style. Unlike some others that lack certain characteristics that leave you seeking more flavor and aroma, this one hits the mark. I will enjoy more Imperial Pumpkins in the future."
"Smelled as expected, typical spices, and nothing that snuck up on you. Worthy of having a bottle or two when the season comes around."
"Overall, I thought this brew was pretty good. The flavors and smells are all there. I paired it with Pad Thai and krab rangoon. Awesome"
"Note - Great bottle / label - An angry pumkin warrior is featured and is one of the better graphics I've seen in a while..."
"D- This beer was a miss for me. If you're into super spiced beer then you'll probably dig this one. It's worth a try if you've not had this one before, but overall; it's a pretty average beer. Cheers!"
"Call me pleasantly surprised. This year's is definitely better than I remember it, for sure. I'll be trying it again next year and maybe again this year too."
"Looked a bit drab compared to others in the style, more brown than expected. The smell was obvious for the class, but not as complex as others. The cinnamon was light and after nutmeg I did not notice much after that - where is the coriander. Taste followed the lead of smell, sort of bland really. Some spice, but I did not notice much in the way of pumpkin flavors. I did not ask the abv but correctly guessed it low for an imperial. Mouthfeel was flat and uninspiring really. Drinkable = average."
"D - This is quite a tasty pumpkin ale for sure, but it's got nothing on Southern Tier Pumking. With that said, the is probably the second best pumpkin ale I've had. Let's see how this measures up to the upcoming Selin's Grove Pumpkin Ale in a few weeks."
"Drinkability: More of an Autumn ale than a pumpkin ale, this beer is dominated by more of a spice taste then a pumpkin one. Also, the mouthfeel and aftertaste of this beer are not very good. Nevertheless, this is a mildly refreshing Autumn beer that wouldn't taste bad on a warm Autumn day. If you like spiced beer, check this one out."
"Im liking the drinkability. The ABV isn't present, you can feel it a little in the tongue but nothing big. This beer is beer as it warms."
"edit - i think this beer is much better than i said last time, and am editing the scores to show as much."
"D - If you're into spice, this is a brew for you."
"The alcohol in this one is moderately high but doesn't really shine through much (until afterward). Overall, I'd say this is a tasty, well-balanced beer. I'd be curious to compare it to other pumpkin ales but I'm pretty happy with this one. This isn't something I'd sit down and drink often, but I was curious about it, had it, and was happy. Alright!"
"Drinkability- Moderate to low. High Alcohol and cloyingness prevent consuming more then a couple."
"MF&D - I'm not a big fan of fruit infused beer in general, but if you are this one is definitely a quality product."
"Imperial Pumpkin is a luxurious, exquisite pumpkin ale that is a must try for fans of the style but I feel its too rich for serious sessioning."
"Eric"
"They really hid the ABV well as its the spices, not any alcohol burn, that give you a warming sensation. A perfect relax/dessert beer."
"D: Not bad. Since we don't have ST brews in Florida this one will have to satisfy my pumpkin fix. It is the next best thing in my opinion. That being said the distance between this and Pumking is great."
"D - You probably wouldn't want more than one or two, but a perfectly good non-pumpkin-soda pumpkin ale. If pressed, I prefer Punkin' Ale, but really, it's pretty close. Punkin' is more like the whole pumpkin pie, complete with big spices and whipped cream. This one is like the raw, plain pumpkin pie filling, with a bigger pure pumpkin character. Both excellent, and satisfying. I will drink this again."
"D - The boldness of this brew makes a bomber of it enough, but man is it well constructed. There's not the pumpkin element present in some others of the style, but the spice profile is amazing. It's difficult to really nail even a couple of spices in a beer, but Weyerbacher has done a seamless job of getting 4 big boys together. Incredible stuff."
"Cheers!"
"A dark, clear copper in color with a fairly scant off-white head and modest lacing. The aroma is butterscotch-nut and licorice alcohol, very complex and impressive. The taste is a somewhat thin bodied mild brandy and root beer, licorice, pumpkin and lots of cinnamon. The carbonation is subtle and its drinkability seems minimal to my tastebuds. Very interesting but not something I will likely revisit anytime soon."
"I had high hopes for this brew--it looked great and smelled wonderful. Not a bad beer but not one I'll routinely seek out."
"Served: in a standard pint glass"
"I bought this 4-pack at Discount Liquor in Milwaukee."
"Overall this is one of the better pumpkin beers. It keeps a handle on the spices, which makes this much more drinkable than others of the style."
"Dogfish Head Punkin Ale is still king of the mountain when it comes to pumpkin ales for me, but I'm glad to have tried this version by Weyerbacher, just to get a glimpse at that high ABV, pull no punches flavor they've built a reputation on."
"Had this one with the Poker Pals Moxley and Hyland. Poured from bottle into pint glass a cloudy iced tea brown with orange hues. Smelled like my oh my sweet pumkin pie, cinamon, nutmeg and cloves. Tasted like the smell, sweet and crisp with no heavy alcohol taste and was surprisingly smooth. Light and mildly carbonated with more spices more prominent as it warms. I was not expecting to like this at all but I did. No doubt the best pumpkin beer I have tried."
"12oz. bottle: This one pours into the glass with a bit of a fizzy, off-white head that goes away almost instantly. It is a fairly clear amber color. This one definitely smells like a pumpkin pie: there is no mistaking it for anything else. The taste is quite good. The cinnamon and other pumpkin pie spices are fight upfront, but not overdone. Some sweetness coming up through the spices. It has a very clean taste, but not light. I like this one!"
"Whoa...there are some big-time flavors lurking in this one. Spices blast the palate first, with white pepper and cinnamon-rich pumpkin notes leading the way. This transitions to veggy-rich pumpkin pulp and caramel malts that get quickly demolished by a brash occupancy of ethanol. Mouthfeel is sticky and thinner than expected, while the boozy finish is hot and leaves the tongue a bit too dry. Imperial Pumpkin started out promising, but falls a bit flat in the taste/mouthfeel department. Nevertheless, it does hold up as one of the better Pumpkin Ales out this fall."
"Highly recommended for fans of fall seasonals. Weyerbacher hasn't let me down yet!"
"Deep red-orange. Thin head, not much for retention. Lots of pumpkin spices in the nose, allspice, cinnamon, cloves, touch of vanilla. Smells translate nicely into the taste, but big juicy pumpkin flavor is the really nice part. Not bad. Slick, smooth mouthfeel."
"I really can't recommend this. Other reviews seem pretty favorable so maybe I got a bad bottle. But the rest of this one is going down the drain..."
" Smooth and clean, well balanced flavors, alcohol well hidden. Seems to be a very well made pumpin ale"
"I understand this is a pumpkin ale but it tastes a lot like a winter warmer. Not what's expected."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Very smooth and velvety on the palate, carbonation does not intrude at all, it is so light in feel that it is barely noticeable. The body of this beer is full, and thick, not full though like a doppelbock, not chewy like that, but it is full as in heavy, creamy and smooth. This is one that I could seriously drink all day, give me a cool fall day outside and I'm there counting leaves that fall from the trees. The finish on this one is semi-dry leaving some of the spice flavor behind which seems to dry out the palate. Get your hands on this one if you can. This is one that I'll be buying again, that is granted I can find it...had to travel to my hometown of Stow OH, to get this one. There's only a few that I've had better than this (in terms of Pumpkin ales) and two of those would be homebrewed that I made about a year ago (not to flaunt my prowess, since I think that it was pure luck that I picked numbers and percentages for my grist bill, too bad I didn't write down exactly how much of each spice I used...hindsight is better than foresight, always use a scale to measure things). If you love Pumpkin ales as I do, get your hands on this one, its fucking great."
"D- The beer is the very enjoyable similar to.. you guessed it pie. It was a lot of fun and a great experience for an """IPA.""" However I could only drink one in a sitting."
"For what Weyerbacher set out to produce, they nailed it. Now if you don't like spice or alcohol flavors, steer clear. But if you do, this one will rock you."
"Being very close to the brewery we always get a nice batch, and this beer did not disappoint me at all."
"Very good pumpkin beer, which some may consider an oxymoron, but I enjoyed it and will be seeking this out more as the season wears on."
"Had on tap at the Sunset Cantina. The drink had a great gold-orange balance with a creamy head and some nice lacing. Aromas were incredible and rich in their pumpkin and spice flavoring. The taste was a little weaker than the aroma had you going for. Slight metallic hints in each sip with less spice than what expected. Still, pretty heavy on the pumpkin flavoring. Excellently crisp and refreshing with the sweet, pumpkin taste. Overall, a really good pumpkin ale."
"The abv is well hidden, a nice Pumpkin ale, Only Bristol's & DFH seem better to me, recommended"
"D - drinkability is pretty high for a pumpkin beer with 8% ABV. This thing is really tasty and hides the ABV quite well. This could be a dangerous one, but it's not like you're going to session it (or are you?). r0x0rz pretty hard, and highly recommended if you're in the market for a pumpkin beer this autumn. Glad to know I have something else to buy along with Punkin"
"Very drinkable beer that is one of the top pumpkin beers."
"I will seek this out again, it is pricey, but unique."
"This is a good fall beer but I will buy more Dogfish Head Punkin before this again."
"Overall, this is a great Autumn beer, very spicy if you're into that."
"EDIT: I tweaked my scoring (taste from a 3.0 to 4.0) to reflect a different bottle that I gave more time to settle and warm up. Obviously this is a beer to spend some time with, and I clearly did not give it enough the first time. Alcohol becomes less astringent and more a compliment of the flavor profile. Quite tasty. Smooth. Well rounded spices, but still quite a lot of them."
"On the side of a sipper, but a pretty good offering on the style. I just remember it being much better."
"D: For the most half, one of the better pumpkin brews... maybe just a little TOO much flavour. I'd still have it again, though it would be an occasional thing as that alcohol keeps it from being at all sessionable."
"carbonation is ample, body is medium. should be fuller bodied?"
"Overall, Weyerbacher Imperial Pumpkin is a solid fall seasonal that is worth a shot. I am not a huge fan of pumpkins, but this is something that I would pick up again."
"Overall maybe the best pure pumkin beer I have had, with the most pure pumkin flavor. If you want to enjoy a true pumking tasting beer, grab this one. Good beer Dan, keep them coming. Also, love the label. Cheers."
"Drinkability: Not a bad pumpkin ale by any stretch, though not my favorite (that honor belongs to the ST Pumking). The 8% is nowhere to be found, which is nice, and the spices are spot-on, in my opinion - not too prominent, not too weak, and balanced well. The pumpkin taste/aroma isn't fantastic though, and the mouthfeel's a little flat."
"This is the best pumpkin beer i've had yet which isn't that many but is over a half dozen."
"A very unique pumpkin, great job weyerbacher."
"Imperial Pumpkin Ale pours orange with a white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. Weyerbacher definitely got the nose right, this smells like pumpkin. The flavor is also right on the nose, pumpkin with alcohol lurking in the background. Not my favorite style, but well done, a bit too much alcohol to get a higher drinkability rating."
"Picked up a 4pk not too long ago. Pours a deep reddish/orange color. The head doesn't last very long long but lingers a bit. Smells like pumpkin pie sprinkled with cinnamon followed by a sticky sweet malty aroma. Taste is not really like a pumpkin pie more of the sweet malt with hints of spices. Good carbonation, a VERY good beer from Weyerbacher. This one is up there along side DFH Punkin Ale. Will drink plenty of these this fall."
"Pours a deep, clear reddish amber with a short-lived cream-colored head which recedes to a tiny ring with only a trace of lacing. It actually smells a good bit like pumpkin pie with a big dose of spices thrown in, mainly cinnamon, with sweet malt in the background. The taste is not quite as reminiscent of pumpkin pie to me with a hit of sugar and cinnamon up front before giving way to the malt background and pumpkin before finishing with a spicy kick that lingered for a while. The mouthfeel is good with lots of carbonation and a bit dry. I've only had a couple other pumpkin ales, but this one is the best. Very drinkable and another good offering from Weyerbacher."
"D- It might just be that I could never drink a lot of a pumpkin ale. I don't know. I think that's what I'm starting to find out, but the flavors are not something I want a ton of, but are nice to try at least."
"Taste is more of cinnamon and nutmeg than of pumpkin but it is there though, has a nice sweet pumpkin light aftertaste. Not overwhelming at all. This is a great fall beer! Too bad its not more of a sessionable beer."
"This poured a clear ruby color with a little tan head. It smelled like bitter pumpkin and rusty copper hops with red barley malt, sour apple, and a bit of sweet yeast. It tasted like pumpkin and red malt, mixed with sour apple and sour cherry hops and earthy copper hops. As it warmed, the pumpkin flavor became sweeter and more dominant, which mellowed out the overall flavor. Overall this was a clean and complex beer that had a strange mix of sweet, sour, and bitter. Perfectly haunting for Halloween, but not quite my taste."
"pours a dark orange with a finger oh head that faded faily quickly. smell is strong spicy pumpkin pie, as advertised. taste is a little sweet, kind of brown sugary with a strong palate of pumpkin pie spices. mouthfeel is creamy and rich. crazy drinkable for an 8%abv beer. one of my annual autumn favorites!"
"D: Very drinkable beer as all of the flavors are well balanced and the aftertaste balanced as well with a decent amount of alcohol to boot for a nice warming fall beer."
"Pours a deep amber, orange color with a strong head that starts up and goes away really quickly. Good amount of lacing for a pumpkin ale. A lot of spice, clove and a hint of pumpkin in the nose. Taste is outstanding. Nice balance of pumpkin, spice, clove, and did I mention spice? It started off as slightly metallic, but as the beer went on, the pumpkin and spice become more pronounced. This brew has much more carbonation that most pumpkin ales I've had in the past. It is definitely a nice change of pace. Overall, this is an outstanding pumpkin ale, and I'm absolutely psyched that this is now available in Atlanta."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Overall a nice treat."
"Despite all the spice and the pumpkiny goodness, or perhaps because of the novelty of this beer on my palate, or maybe it's just because I love me some 'punkin pie', but I found this medium-bodied jewel especially tasty and very drinkable."
"D. Well first off, this is my first Pumpkin Ale. I enjoy it, and the spiciness to it would pair well with many types of dishes and even desserts. Furthermore, this beer has kept well, and I would like to have a bottle age away for a while to see what happens. Could session this stuff, once you get used to it, its actually a very good style of beer. Weyerbacher really doesn't make bad beer either."
"coppery orangish with a slightly pinkish head. nose is pumpkin of course and spice of course. wierd bitterness that went away as it warmed up, so i don't reccommend this one too cold. i think some extra caramel malt and a touch of brown sugar would have smoothed this one out, but it still is a fantastic pumpkin beer. great brewery, great beer."
"D : If you like pumpkin, it's a good beer that's pretty easy to drink."
"Thanks Hyland for thinking of me"
"The body is more moderate than full but hard to tell with the stronger solvent notes coming out strong. Limited carbonation but ok. Overall I think this beer is missing the """pumpkin""" element with more spice and alcohol coming out more. Not the king here."
"Drank this one with the mox and the monkey. Poured from a bomber into a tulip pint glass. Poured cloudy brownish orange similar to a snapple iced tea. Had a nice white head, about a 1/2 inch but it didnt last too long. Light circles of lacing. The smell was great. Spices mostly clove and cinnamon on top of pumpkin, not so much pumpkin but pumpkin pie.. Tastes like thanksgiving. Wanted to unbutton my pants and relax on the couch after the first sip. Nice pumpkin pie flavor. Sweet and spicy with a nice oily feel. Cant believe this ones an imperial. No alcohol taste whatsoever. Definitely the best pumpkin beer I've had."
"Drinkability: I'm not a big fan of Pumpkin Ales and this one didn't change my mind about them. Yeah, it's the best Pumpkin Ale I've had so far, but that's not saying much. I guess it's worth a shot just once and only once."
"D - I wouldn't drink more than two in a night. It's easy enough to drink, but the flavors are rather strong. I think it's best suited for a colder night outside. Overall a decent beer."
"This brew will give pumpkin ales a good name. It pours a dark amber with a nice half-inch pillow head. Smell is a good combination of cinnamon and spice with a nice malt undertone. Taste..doh..pumpkin pie with a malt backbone. Finish has a decent hop characteristic. Drinkability is good balancing between a light sweetness followed by a pleasant tartness. Mouthfeel is slightly chewy with a disntict dry quality at the finish."
"D: I think this is a great beer, and a unique brew. I would definitely have another."
"Notes: I had this with a slice of carrot cake, which was a nice pairing."
"12 oz. bottle with no freshness date - brewed with pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg, cardamom and clove. Damn bottle volcanoed on me, messing up the decant, hence my glass is full of particulates. The beer is reddish/auburn and very carbonated for the first two minutes, building up a fizzy inch of head, but soon after it is nearly lifeless, with a tiny collar that doesn't lace the glass. Cardamom and cinnamon are the first aromas to hit, followed by the other two spices, a dose of cola, and light hops and malt. Flavor-wise, pumpkin and cardamom start the show, then it's cinnamon and light malts. There's also some mild hop bitterness, but no real hop flavor, all on top of a light/medium body that is very dry and carbonated on the tongue. A decent pumpkin with nice spices, but it needs more actual pumpkin flavor. In addition, the yeast is too clean and attenuative, thinning the body more than I'd like. If you like pumpkin ales try this one out, but if not, you can pass."
"Rich Amber to maroon color. Keeps a huge frothy lasting beige head. Gorgeous beer. Big meaty pumpkin pie aroma, especially after 1st opening, and just a faint hint of alcohol. Flavor is nice, typical spices associated with the style, but not as robustly flavored and intense as I expected. Mouthfeel is great, and nicely thick, which most pumpkins seem to lack, and the alcohol is hidden well and only peeks out minimally. Great pumpkin beer all around, but I actually prefered the flavor of Schlafly's Pumpkin, while maybe not the mouthfeel of it."
"D - Not as good as I had hoped."
"D: a great fall drink on a chilly october."
"Taste is very spicy as indicated from the smell, good malt backbone with a slight hop balance, good carbonation level. One of the more intensely spiced pumpkin beers out there yet somehow remains fairly balanced and not overwhelming."
"Overall I am not a fan of fruit/vegetable beers, so this one is a little biased. It is worth a try, but I won't be getting more."
"As a huge fan of pumpkin ales, I tried a huge variety this past Autumn, and I must say, this is probably one of the best that I've sampled... From a 22 oz bomber copped from Bottle King in Glen Ridge, this """mother of pumpkin ales""" pours a beautiful copper/orange-bronze color with modest frothy head... smell is full of pumpkin-pie flavors bursting through, with cinnamon, some ginger, and other noticeable spices... cloves are also present, and the intense aroma leads to an equally bold taste which strongly complemented the smell... great authentic pumpkin taste which really poured through this one... as far as the 8% ABV is concerned, you don't really taste it in this one... I really liked this brew... very interesting and full of flavor and characteristic... wonderful sample from Weyerbacher, which is a brewery known for the bold and eccentric brews... for all the pumpkin ale fans out there, this is definitely a must-try..."
"Poured from a 22oz bottle into two tulip glasses. A thin head formed that faded a bit quickly. There was a real lack of carbonation. The color was a brownish orange, and the smell was of cinnamon and spices. There was a definite taste of pumpkin on the palate, but it didn't do much for me. The body was a bit weak, and the flavor didn't grab my taste buds. It got a bit bland as it warmed to room temperature. A decent pumpkin ale, but not one of my favorite imperial pumpkins that I have ever tried. Not sure I'd buy this one again."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, kind of filling, good kick, good representation of style, it isn’t quite the best Pumpkin Ale that I’ve had but it’s not bad. The fact that it will fill you up would make it difficult to put away more than one bomber, especially since Pumpkin Ales are pretty difficult to drink more than one of to begin with."
"Pours a slightly fogged amber with minimal crème head. Nose is very smoked spices. Almost seems like a rauch to me. Flavor is definitely influenced by the alcohol, but not hijacked by it. Spices mix well and don't overdo it. Pumpkin is mildly there. Feel has a biting carbonation to it. Drinkable, yes. In comparison to much of the pumpkin garbage out there, this is definitely a step above. However, it doesn't carry the right tone of pumpkin character that it should I feel. Bottom line: Pumpking is just that."
"Definitely a fall/winter seasonal worth exploring."
"D: I couldn't take the taste, however, both parents (including a mom who barely drinks & thinks I'm nuts for bringing all these weird beers back when I visit) had no trouble finishing it. As much as I hate to let someone else's opinion shape my own, it's clear from the way they devoured it, it you enjoy the spices, the drinkability is good."
"Big strong, aroma to start, full of pumpkin meat and crust garnished with cinnamon and nutmeg. The flavor is good, but comes off too spice-heavy, taking away from the nice malts and pumpkin in the aroma. Overall, it feels like a bigger beer, but still hides the 8% well. One of the best pumpkin beers I've tried and tastier than the other imperial I've tried, Pumking."
"D: The spiciness cuts down on the drinkability a bit but this is a great beer. Second to Pumpking in the style. Definitely check it out."
"This beer is a nice orange with a fair head and a ton of floaters. The smell is of a spiced pumkin pie. The taste is like a pumkin with spices. There is also a herbal sharpness to the taste that is a little much. The abv shows a little too and this all affects the drinkability. Overall a fair beer but not one that I would go out oy my way to try again."
"I had a bit of a tough time getting through the whole bomber because of all the spice, which affected the drinkability a bit for me. I've had a lot of pumpkin ale this season and I think I've come to the determination that I just don't like them all that much. This is the second best one I've had, behind only the Southern Tier Pumking which blows this and every other one away. I will probably pick up a bottle of this again next fall, but only one."
"D- I enjoyed the smell and taste of this beer, but I don't find it so Imperially strong."
"A neat beer, not one i'd fall in love with though."
"Pours a cloudy orange/brown, what I think of when I think Halloween, thick egg shell head, tons of lace, good retention, forms a solid layer, nice looking beer. Smell is caramel, ginger, cinnamon and nutmeg, bread, smells like liquid cookies, some honey, very neat. Taste is licorice root, bread, cookies, ginger, cinnamon and nutmeg, plus other spice, caramel and alcohol, pretty neat. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, lightly syrupy, but with high carbonation, kind of confused by the mouthfeel, but I liked it. Damned solid pumpkin beer, thanks Chris and Kyoko!"
"Drinkability: Above average pumpkin ale. Very tasty, just not as pumpkin flavored as I would have liked. The 8% ABV, does not made itself known, and this is a pretty easy drink. This is not the best pumpkin ale, but is definitely in the top few."
"D- For a pumpkin ale this is superb. Perhaps a making it a bit thinner and cranking up the carbonation a little would make this more drinkable for me but I think it sets itself apart from other pumpkins remarkably well. The abv is fairly well hidden which is something weyerbacher seems to do very well"
"Now this is what IU am talking about. I had waited forever as I missed out on this one last year, but this year I was not going to be denied! Picked one up in Asheville on my last trip through town and picked last night to give it a try. Poured a nice medium hazy amber with a definite reddish tint to it. Lots of visible carbonation was apparent, as was a nice three finger head of foamy white lace, which receded very slowly and left concentric rings of lace down the sides of the glass. The aroma was enchanting, full of pumpkin spice and cinnamon, it was very full with no sense of the alcohol. The flavor was great, a very full balanced attack of spice, with a decidedly malty grain back bone, that was just strong enough to peak its head through and let you know it was there. Great smooth finish left you thirsting for another sip. The feel was a nice creamy medium body that had ample carbonation. Overall this was wonderful and was every bit as good as I thought it would be. A full frontal assault of spices, cinnamon and nutmeg galore e with a great balanced feel and a well hidden alcohol. This was defiantly a good one and something I will look forward to picking up next year for sure."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. It was a nice dark amber color with a 1 finger thick off white foamy head. The head left a ring that lasted the whole time. Aroma was definitely reminiscent of a good fresh pumpkin pie. Picked up pumpkin, nutmeg, and cloves along with some lemon zesty hints. Tasted like orangey pumpkin pie. The spices were much more pronounced in the aroma than in the taste which was disappointing. Felt good in the mouth. Consistency was good, just solid enough to coat the mouth. A bit of carbonation detracted from the mouth feel. It was very easy to drink. I ended up drinking the whole glass without knowing it. : ) One of the better pumpkin beers I have had."
"This is a very tasty pumpkin ale. Lots of spices, but they are not offensive. The malt balance all the spices very well."
"This beer is amber in color with a creamy white head that always suggests a big beer to me. The smell is as others have described, pure pumpkin pie with a strong cinnamon and nutmeg aroma. The taste is floral and perfumey with a little mustiness at the end and does not quite taste like pumpkin. This is good but I cant imagine ever wanting more than one. In fact, it would be best at six ounces so maybe split one with a friend. The spiciness is just very pronounced although the alcohol is well hidden."
"The mouthfeel is crisp and moderate in texture. The moderate carbonation doesn't do much to lighten up the starchiness. A bit dry and yeasty in the finish. Very flavorful and complex for a pumpkin ale. I've had some great ones (Southern Tier Imperial Pumking!) and some really poor ones, and I'd say this is certainly on the better half."
"To be honest, I've never been a big fan of pumpkin beer. But this wasn't bad."
"Deep amber color with a thin, but sufficient head. Nose of Big Red Gum (cinnamon). Flavor was rich in banana bread maltiness with nutmeg, cloves, and cardamon following up. The body was rich and actually was the first pumpkin beer to really remind me of pumpkin pie - not just the spices, but the texture. 8% alcohol is well masked. This should be a Christmas beer as well! This is the best pumpkin beer I have tried yet. I could almost taste the whipped cream and pie crust!"
"Overall, this was one of the more intense and impressive pumpkin ales that I have sampled."
"D: I'm not sure what it is about these pumpkin beers, including an 'imperial' one no less, but I feel this one can only go so far. Pumpkin ales seem to require a balancing act that's quite difficult to perfect. Granted, the balance of spice is tasty, and I can always appreciate a seasonal offering that requires extra effort, but I'm not completely sold on this one."
"Drinkability - A very nice seaonal offering from Weyerbacher. I plan on drinking some more of this around Thanksgiving."
"Buy it by the case, love it while you can - Awesome A+ beer."
"The beer presents a dark amber color with little head retention. Upon smelling the beer one is hit with a sweet aroma with the ever present pumpking pie spices mixed in. The taste is malty but definately sweet (perhaps belgain candi sugar?). The pumpkin pie spices are lightly present and therefore not too overpowering as you sometimes get with pumpkin ales. Lastly, the beer has a dry afterfinish from the phenols."
"Drinkability- I really enjoyed this brew. I gave my roommate a sip and he couldnt believe how tasty it was. Maybe a full flavored cow cheese isnt the recommended choice of deliciousness that goes with a pumpkin beer, but IMHO it goes great! Thanks again to BeerTruth for the opportunity to enjoy this fall taste treat."
" TONS of pumpkin, clove and cinnamon in the aroma. Big pumpkin clove in the taste, smooth and creamy body. Sharp bite of cinnamon and hops in the finish. No alcohol to be found in this very tasty treat."
"This was a very good pumpkin beer. It had a nice orange amber color to it, with very little head. The aroma was a mixture of pumpkin, cinnamon, clove and allspice. The flavour had a nice spiciness to it with a heft of malt. It went down so well I had two...."
"I'd recommend this one. And I'd open another bomber of it if I had one."
"Poured into a pint glass with a very lively, light tan colored head that dissipated quickly but tickled the lips as I took my first sip. Smell was by no means overpowering; very subtle scent of cinnamon and nutmeg. Beautiful dark amber-orange color with ample carbonation; however very little lacing clung to the glass during the sample. Taste was very mild compared to other pumpkin ales I have tried in the past. Again, taste of nutmeg, cinnamon and perhaps some clove. Smooth, malty mouthfeel with very little astringence considering the 8.0% ABV. A very pleasant seasonal brew. I was hesitant at first to purchase due to past experience, but was happy I did. Drinkability was only a 3.5 because I don't think I would want more than one at a sitting, but definitely worth a pour."
"Drinkability/Notes. What a really nice Pumpkin Ale, maybe the best I've had this year. I wasn't a big fan of pumpkins but have grown to like them and this one hits the spot. Plenty of pumpkin flavor with loads of pie spices in the nose and in the flavor. Hops to play a role as the balance the beer with a pleasant bitterness. Alcohol is really well hidden especially for 8% thus making it easy to drink but it will sneak up on you. A really fine pumpkin ale from the folks at Weyerbacher. Seek and Enjoy. Definitely recommended."
"D: This beer was pretty drinkable. It tasted very good and the mouthfeel was nice and smooth. Towards the end of the beer, the large amount of spices evident started to get to my stomach towards the end of the beer. Overall, a good beer."
"Drinkability is noteworthy with this beer. A better than average pumpkin ale with a strength that quite deceiving."
"decent drinkability... easing up on the spices would have done this beer some good, going a more barleywine route might have been good."
"I liked this for its boldness and character, but there's not a ton of depth, and I don't think I'd want to drink much of it in any season. So the drinkability isn't what it could be, but I nevertheless give props to Weyerbacher for conjuring up this mean pumpkin (see label)."
"Overall: There wasn't as much pumpkin as I thought there would be, more cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves than anything. (And maybe the cardamon but I'm not sure what that tastes like to begin with.) Still, I found this one to be quite enjoyable and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys pumpkin beers."
"I poured this beer into a tumbler at fifty degrees. The beer wa gas colored with a tan head head that quickly decayed away. The beer smelled great, very spicy very fallish. I did not however taste any pumpkin, just spices that were way overpowering. Not my cup of beer. It would be great as an air freshener I guesss. I will not buy again."
"this beer is decidedly good, i am new to this whole pumpkin ale thing, i believe this is my third type, i must say i like them. this beer tastes like a pumpkin pie smells. never had the pie but this beer makes me think of it regardless. its full of spice and punch, without overpowering. its a good beer, and great example of the pumpkin ale style. i wish the head retention and aroma had been better but the rest of the beer makes up for it"
"D: Pretty darn good as far as pumpkin beers go. With most pumpkin beers I'm looking for something that tastes good to have once, but I feel like I could have a bunch of these."
"The alcohol is pretty well hidden for being 8%ABV. The beer was a pleasant surprise. I was expecting something overpowering but instead got something complex and fulfilling. The lacing never really showed up, I guess I need to clean my glasses a little better for next time. Although, Pumpkin Ales don't seem to have the best lacing, especially when compared to DIPAs. This one is certainly worth a try, maybe you'll be surprised as well. Recommended."
"A most enjoyable beer regardless of genre. It seems like a number of Pumpkin Ales actually have little to do with pumpkin and are more about warmth, spice vs sweet malts, and mouth-feel over taste. I'm not complaining, just something I've noticed. This was very nice and would be great with spicy fare, especially cuisine that embraces tradition holiday spices as everyday in their recipes, as well as with some really sharp, dry cheddar or go completely 180 degrees with some rich, soft, creamy Bleu. Definitely one of the best autumn beers I've tried. I'd love to enjoy this outside to see just how god those warming qualities are. Definitely recommended."
"I love Pumpkin Ales. There are good and bad ones out there, but when they're good, they're good. So I was excited to find an Imperial Pumpkin Ale. I've drank a couple bombers of this already, but haven't taken the time to review it. It pours a very appealing reddish-orange, in other words, a solid pumpkin color. Very rich. Tall white head with good retention. Leaves rings of lace all around the glass. Smells very strongly of warm, almost roasted pumpkin, plus some rich pie spices, such as the cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves. You can smell the alcohol, too. Tastes are phenomenal; the best I've ever had in a pumpkin ale. This is what I've been looking for! Again with the roasted pumpkin and the spices. Little alcohol bite. A nice touch of bitterness on the back of the tongue, which balances out the sweetness. Overall wonderful flavors. Like seriously drinking a pie of liquid pumpkin pie. Nice, creamy mouthfeel: not as thick as a stout, but smooth like a Maibock. So smooth that I swear they used oats in the mash. This is a fantastic Pumpkin Ale, probably the best one I've ever come across. It's flavors and aromas are rich and bold, but not overpowering. Weyerbacher has really committed to the style, rather than just cramming spices in or using a pumpkin additive. I will definitely return to this one again and again. It's a new reason to look forward to fall!"
"M&D - a easily drinkable beer with great flavor, however rather light on the flavor, this is a great pumpkin ale, just don't know what makes it """Imperial""""
"there is your typical pumpkin pie spice aroma and flavor, but what's noteworthy for me is an almost licorice aroma and flavor. the more i drink, the more this becomes noticeable. eventually, this aroma and flavor hinders the drinkability. otherwise, this is a good pumpkin ale. typical copper color with an off-white head. low hops, and high spicy malt. alcohol is well masked. mouthfeel is medium with a spicy tongue tingle. not bad, but i prefer others."
"drinkable?: nope, it is a candle, a smell to be put in the air in the fall. NOT A DRINK!"
"Final Note: I like Pumpkin Ales in the early fall and I would put Weyerbacher Imperial Pumpkin Ale at #3, right behind Southampton Pumpkin Ale and my #1 favorite Southern Tier Pumking."
"It should be noted that I tasted this alongside Southern Tier's Pumking.... and it should also be noted Pumking blew its doors off."
"gives my perennial favorite, Edenton/Big Boss Pumpkin a run for its money"
"Pours a golden pumpkin,with a thin head. A bit of retention,and lacing. Smell is of pumpkin,and spice,with notes of sweet fruit,and honey. Body is thick with some carbonation. Taste is of spiced pumpkin,and cinnimon. Sweet fruit,and honey throughout. One of the best! A must have this Autumn."
"-Oelergud"
"Very nice offering from Weyerbacher, and perfect for this time of year. If you don't like pumpkin ales you won't like this one either, but if you do, this one is particularly potent and spicy. The addition of cardamom makes this one particularly luscious. Pours a reddish brown, quite clear with a short head that fades quickly. The smell is great- redolent of spices and pumpkin, particularly cardamom, cinammon, and cloves. The taste is similar, but a little more subdued than the wonderful aroma. Still a nice spiciness, but it falls off a little and creamy and slightly sour pumpkin takes over. Mouthfeel is creamy and relatively substantial. Delicious and enjoyable fall treat."
"Wow. Imperial pumpkin. Honestly, I'm glad someone did it. But it's not suited for everyone, that's for sure (I remain firmly on the fence about the whole thing). As interesting as this beer is, it's not all that accessible. You really gotta love pumpkins (and spices) to enjoy a whole bomber of this. Still, it's a seasonal phenomenon worth trying. Thanks to Weyerbacher for once again testing the limits of brewing conventionality."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's medium bodied. Carbonation is good. It's nice and smooth. Drinkability is pretty good for a pumpkin beer. I don't think I'd have more than this bomber, but it's going down easy. Overall, pretty solid effort."
"D-I was expecting more. The clove taste is too strong and I prefer a bit more sweetness to my pumpkin beers. That said, this is still a tasty beverage but not my favourite pumpkin"
"Pours a two finger off-white head that fades slowly leaving traces of lace. Nice clear amber color. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Strong pumpkin nose. Flavor is similar to a pumpkin pie with a hop backing but not really sweet like a pie. $5.00 for a 22oz bottle from Tully's Beer and Wine Wells, ME."
"Pours a deep ruby amber with a decent head that slowly diminishes to a ring but leaves spotty lacing on the glass. The aroma is of course dominated by pumpkin spice. The taste is dominated by pumpkin as well, but some burnt caramel comes through as well. The beer is a bit on the heavy side, with some alcohol coming through, but not too much. This is an enjoyable beer, but in my opinion, this is one style that does not need to go Imperial."
"Pours a pure copper with a huge white head that takes its time. Lacing throughout. Smells like I just stuck my nose in a freshly baked pumpkin pie. Wow! Pumpkin, nutmeg, cinnimon, delicious smelling. Dove right into this and it didnt dissapoint. All that is in the smell along with a touch of clove and some other spice. Feels medium in the mouth with a tickle of carbonation. Oh what I would do to have a slice of pumpkin pie right now to compliment the beer. ABV is non existant. Compared to the other pumpkins Ive tasted, I know why they called this Imperial. A delicious treat that must be tried if you like the kind."
"The beer pours a dark amber color with a thin offwhite head that quickly fades to spotty lacing. The aroma is good. It has a firm malt base along with a wonderful pumpkin spice aroma. The pumpkin flavor is excellent along with a bold amount of cinnamon, and nutmeg. This is an amber beer so crystal malts were used to soften the pumpkin taste. The taste is good. It has a smooth pumpkin spice flavor that is easy drinking even at 8%. The alcohol is well hidden by the spices and fruit. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a full bodied beer with less than adequate carbonation. This is a damn fine pumpkin beer; maybe the best around, but I need more CO2. There is zero head retention and the mouthfeel suffers without it."
"Drinkability - Very nice brew for my first pumpkin, this was extremely impressive from Weyerbacher. This could easily pass for a Belgian Strong Dark Ale yet the pumpkin malt gives it a lighter weight and made it much more drinkable. Loving another winner from Weyerbacher."
"The flavor is a bit disappointing. There are hints of the items I described above, but they're just not deep enough, and the aftertaste is rather bitter and short-lasting. On the upside, the creamy mouthfeel and warming alcohol is out of this world, and the bit of brown sugar I detected at the finish was delightful."
"22oz bomber from RSVP. Copper-red translucent body with a good inch of offwhite head that dissipates slowly leaving some lacing. Smells like cinnamon, nutmeg, nut, banana, and pumpkin. Nutmeg plays a big roll in the flavor as well, with pumpkin and fruit also at the forefront and hints of cinnamon as well. No alcohol flavor detectable, thought a bit of alcohol warming is present. Fairly full in mouthfeel with a fair bit of carbonation keeping the finish somewhat clean with just a bit of alcohol and spice present afterward. One sip definitely invites another. A pretty solid pumpkin ale, and something I can see having as a comfort beer year after year in the fall."
"Came out an excellent copper color very reminiscent of a overdone pumpkin pie. Smells like pumpkin pie, too, very pumpkin with an excellent addition of cinnamon and nutmeg. Has a decent head, although almost no lacing. Goes down easily, although not the smoothest brew I've ever had. Nice pumpkin flavor with aftertastes of the spices. If you want a nice harvest/autumn beer that will keep you warm (8% abv!), this is an excellent choice. Very good beer!"
"Much of the same as the 2008 batch. Very subtle pumpkin flavor with spice dominating and the ABV lurking."
"Pours a light copper color with an off white head. Aromas consisting of spices (nutmeg and cinnamon), and a nice presence of alcohol. In the taste, alcohol and nutmeg, cinnamon, with hints of pumpkin. A smooth/ spicy mouthfeel, with a clean pumpkin aftertaste, yet small. Nice spices, and not too overbarring."
"Pours a dark brown red with a creamy tan head, that leaves just a little bit of lacing. Smell is of cinnamon and somewhat of a nutty bread too. After drinking a bit, I noticed a similarity with the smell of Goldschlager. Taste is also heavy on the cinnamon, a little nutty and some pumpkin too. This one has a full mouthfeeling and warms the chest with alcohol."
"Is this a beer to try? Definitely... a great offering from Weyerbacher. I would say this is one of my favorite pumpkin ales."
"Mouthfeel is a little thin, though there is good carbonation. I will finish this bomber, but this will be my last one for this year. Hopefully next year will be better. As for this year, there are better pumpkin ales out there."
"D- This is my first review of a pumpkin ale. I don't have much of a comparison to other pumpkin ales because I have only sampled one other-and didn't get enough of a feel for it to review it. That being said I do like this beer. Pumpkin Ale (along with winter warmer) seems to be a fun style of beer and I can't wait to try more. This is yet another job well done by Weyerbacher-one of my favorite breweries. I can see myself enjoying this and other pumpkin ales around Halloween time during the cool crisp days of fall. Oh, and ABV-undetectable in the taste and barely present in the mouthfeel."
"I have to say that this is one of the better pumpkin ales I've had (not that I'm overly familiar with the style, mind you). The fresh pumpkin flavor is definitely interesting. Definitely give this one a try if you're a fan of the style. It's a great fall beer. Recommended."
"Score reflects an average of two reviews."
"A tangy,peppery mouthfeel. A good pumpkin beer,not a harsh as i would have thought being imperial. Could drink and few of these,but not all night."
"22oz bomber poured into a SA pint glass. Nice looking beer: dark amber, thick tan head. The aroma was all spice: cinnamon, nutmeg, maybe a little clove. I think the spice dominated the taste, and really couldn't tell there was pumpkin in it. It felt warm in my mouth, and for this style of beer was pretty good."
"I don't know what the """imperial""" is on this beer except for the increased alcohol which is hardly noticable. I lowered the drinkability score to reflect my lack of interest in the flavor. There are no flaws but I found nothing special about this pumpkin."
"Highly recommended"
"I won't rush back to this but neither will I shun it."
"Burnt copper color with an admirable head. Noticeable spicy aroma-cloves and cinnamon dominate. Spices dominate the flavor. Malty but there is an underlying alcohol flavor that mars the overall taste. Ok body-not overly """imperial""". Rather dissappointing. As a homebrewer I know a little spice goes a long way. This is rather unbalanced and too spicy for my tastes. Too much booze flavor in there to boot. Nice to try but not again for me."
"The last time I reviewed this brew I mentioned the artwork on the label. Wyerbacher has upgraded the artwork, check it out the new label is even better."
"Like any good pumpkin pie, I really want to have another. I'm not sure if I'd be feeling so great after several of these, but I still want several."
"While at first I was skeptical of another style of beer being labeled as """Imperial", I figured I'd give this one a try in anticipation of the upcoming Fall season. The beer poured a clear, medium amber color with a smallish white head. Aroma reminded me of freshly baked pumpkin pie, lots of spices and pumpkin along with sweet malts. Taste was equally as nice, like liquid pumpkin pie, except with a kick. Mouthfeel was quite light, making this one way too easy to drink. The 22 oz bomber disappeared rather quickly. I find it hard to believe this beer is a strong as the label states. If you like flavored/spiced beers, this one's definitely recommended."
"I will admit that I am not such a big fan of pumpkin flavored beers, but I had always been a little curious about this beer, so I decided it was worth a try. It poured a copper/ruby color, with a healthy white head. The spices are what hits the nose first with aroma. Lots of clove, nutmeg, cinnamon and perhaps some pepper. The pumpkin really comes through in the taste, along with the spices mentioned above. It is very similar to a piece of rich pumpkin pie. One thing I will definitely say is that the heightened alcohol does lend itself to the quality of this beer. It is not in your face, but is there enough to compliment the other tastes that are present. I would sip this brew all night long. This is by far the best pumpkin beer I have ever had the opportunity to taste. Maybe it will inspire me to sample others. Also, it is beers like this that make me look forward to the cooler weather of Fall."
"I'm impressed with this beer, since it doesn't try to be a big beer just for the heck of it. It seems like there's a purpose for everything here, which makes it much more interesting. If you enjoy the pumpkin style and want a little extra kick, this is the perfect beer for you."
"D: very easy to drink, enjoyable as a fall beer alternative to the regular oktoberfests and other red ales."
"D - A tasty brew, but might be a bit cloying with the sweetness and spice if multiples are attempted. Very tasty spiced pumpkin flavor - Great choice of seasonal."
"D: This is the first time I've had this, and it's jumped to the top 3 of my favorite pumpkin ales. Really well done."
"Pours a nice clean/clear dark golden orange color, nice carbonation, nice two-finger plus off-white head, nice sticky lacing afterwards. The nose is malty, spicy, and some caramel. The taste is awesome, malty, some nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves, and some caramel. Medium body. Very drinkable, a really tasty Pumpkin Ale, recommended."
"Recommended."
"Drinkability: You can only really drink one pumpkin beer at a time, but this one isn't a bad one."
"Poured from a 22oz. brown bomber bottle into my Dogfish Head shaker """pint""" glass. Appears a clear deep amber color with about a finger of off-white foam. Smells of cinnamon, nutmeg, clove and caramel malt. Tastes as good as it smells. The sweet baking spices in the nose are also very dominant in the taste. I know it's been said to death but this is liquid pumpkin pie. Period. Medium in both body and carbonation. Rich and satisfying, I'm content after just one bomber. If you like pumpkin beer, this is one of the best."
"Thanks for the extra bottle mymrnngjckt."
"The pour into my Trois Pistoles glass raises a a thin layer of light tan foam that quickly bubbles away. The slight lace manages to stick a bit. The body is a hazy ruby-copper. The nose has a lot of the usual pumpkin pie spices floating around, and they're definitely leading the pumpkin aroma. The taste is highly spiced, with cinnamon and nutmeg being primary. Again, the pumpkin is mild. The mouth is too carbonated. I've really had much better pumpkin beers."
"Served in a pint glass, the beer pours an orange/red/copper color with about an inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are OK. It smells very spicy, like cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and pumpkin. Taste is pretty much the same way it smells, but that's not a bad thing. Mouthfeel is medium, with a good amount of carbonation (not too much) but still going down smooth. Drinkability is good too, it's pretty easy to drink. The alcohol is well hidden. Overall, I think this is a pretty decent pumpkin ale. I'd definitely buy it again."
"M/D- Medium bodied, moderate carbonation, and the alcohol is entirely hidden. I look forward to next year!"
"Tried Weyerbachers Imperial Pumpkin Ale for the first time during the fall of 2006 for my 2006 round of Pumpkin Ale tasting (Shipyard, Saranac, and Weyerbacher). While Shipyards Pumpkinhead Ale was the best of the fall 2005 round (when compared against Post Roads, Blue Moons, and Smuttynoses offerings), this years lot of Shipyards Pumpkinhead fell a bit short. Saranacs Pumpkin Ale and Weyerbachers Imperial Pumpkin Ale were similar in style (versus Shipyards which is lighter wheat ale), but the Weyerbachers was by far the BEST pumpkin ale I have ever tasted."
"Drinkability: Over and over and over. Not too heavy, and doesn't trapse into """novelty""" territory like some other seasonal beers."
"I'll start off by saying that this is the best pumpkin ale that I have ever had. There is enough real pumpkin fruit flavor and aroma to make me buy-in to the style. A pronounces spiciness (cinnamon, nutmeg) to stimulate the nose, and offers a snap and a bite to the flavor and feel. What makes this beer is a very solid 'beer' base. Malty enough to substantiate the dominant pumkin spice flavors and aromas. The beer remains full and rich throughout without watering or allowing the spices to bite. Finsihes with a clean and challenging spiciness with a hint of spruce hops. Very pleasant and easy-to-drink beer without sacrificing body or character."
"Just got this in the mail today; much thanks mymrnngjckt! 12 oz bottle with no date, but i know it's from this past fall. Great looking ale; deep reddish brown, with a creamy, fluffy, off-white head. Big nose with pumpkin pie spices and carmelized malts. Creamy texture. Loaded with pumpkins. Spicy with the likes of cloves, nutmeg, cinnamon, maple sugar, vanilla. Full sized ale body. IBUs maybe in the low 20s, so hops don't play much of a part here. Pumpkin sweetness is dominant in the aftertaste. Man I love the beer and pumpkin combo, a match made in heaven. Great for anyone regardless of beer drinking experience. Cheers!"
"Bottle courtesy of Hogtownharry: Poured a deep orangey/brown cloudy color ale with a nice foamy head with average retention and lacing. Aroma of cinnamon and cloves are dominant but some pumpkin is also noticeable. Taste is a well balance mix between cloves and cinnamon with some subtle pumpkin. Body is above average with adequate carbonation and some light warming alcohol. Very interesting take on the style and probably the best pumpkin beer I ever had."
"D - This one's hard for me. I favor something more like Dogfish Head """Punkin' Ale""" in this style. I won't be buying it again, but i seriously celebrate the Easton PA creativity on this one. If your attempting to dignify your pumpkin experience then you can't stop 'till you've done this one. Cheers!"
"Overall: Thanks ggaughan for giving me the chance to try this beer."
"Drinkability: Great. I put back this bomber with ease. Best pumpkin ale I have had yet. I thought it was great fresh, on-tap as well but I'm willing to cellar a few bottles to see what they do. This beer is pretty hard to get so get it while you can."
"Appears cloudy rusty orange in color with some particles. Nice off-white head quickly receeds to a thin spotty layer of lacing. Smells of pumpkin spices, mainly clove with some nutmeg and cinnamon hinted in there. Taste is all spices, mainly the clove. Cinnamon and nutmeg also present, but in less of a direct way. Just a touch hint of pumpkin. Medium in body with some good carbonation, not too overpowering. Very easy to drink with its alcohol being masked nicely. Overall has a great flavor, but really cannot be sessioned."
"Thick body and heavy carbonation. I don't need another. Disappointing offering from a brewery I've developed an appreciation for."
"First sip reveals an avearge body with silky texture and very fine tingly carbonation. there is a slight stickiness on my lips after each sip. Flavor is sweet malt and spices with cinnamon and nutmeg dominant but a bit of doughy yeast as well. Easy drinker with no hint of ABV. Worth a try in the fall. maybe a good pairing for Thanksgiving dinner."
"Very nice beer. Went well with Thanksgiving dinner."
"The drinkability is good, but one bomber is good. MK"
"22 oz bottle. This brew is a very deep copper color with a 2 finger off-white head with a steady carbonation evenly bubbling up through the brew. Clarity is very nice on this one as well. The aroma brings a solid blast of allspice and nutmeg with a little fleashy pumpkin giving me a solid sense of pumpkin pie. It seems to hit all the highlites for a pumpkin beer. The flavor strong in the spicing with nutmeg, which is followed by an alcohol solventyness. I feel that the alcohol covers up the fleshy pumpkin flavor that I get hints of, but find hidden. Its okay. The mouthfeel is thick with a light carbonation. It really feels full. I feel that this one suffers from the high alcohol in both the flavor and the drinkability. It just brings our characters in the beer that I think are not the highlites of the brew."
"D - I like the Imperial take on the pumpkin style. The 8% ABV is well hidden. This one tastes like an Imperial version of Great Lakes Christmas in my opinion, very similar but much bigger. The clove is a little overpowering in the taste but a very nice seasonal."
"D - I was disappointed, but it was still a good beer nonetheless. I saved it for a few months, and after one whiff, was expecting more from it. I'd still definitely suggest picking one up if you have the chance."
"Pours clear and copper with a good size tan-cream head that slowly recedes. Aroma is reminiscent of pumpkin pie, cinnamon and spices on top of an underlying soft sweetness. A nice bready and malty sweetness hits the tongue followed by a yeastiness and finished with a mildly dry hoppiness mixed with cinnamon and spice. There is a nice tingly pepperiness that comes in mid taste and mixes with the dry finish and a small alcohol burn at the back of the throat. Pretty tasty although one is enough for me with the pumpkin pie spice flavors, can't help but enjoy the 8% abv imperial factor as well."
"All in all, not a bad pumpkin ale, but there are a few others I would drink first."
"Overall this is a drinkable pumpkin ale, the ABV strenght is well-hid, but I just wish it had more pumpkin flavor."
"Drinkability is slightly above average. The spice presence is a little overwhelming to drink more than one of these. A very solid pumpkin ale that I will certainly buy next year."
"This beer pours an amber color with a medium head that falls slowly and leaves plenty of lacing on the glass. The aroma has a lot of spices in it, mostly nutmeg and clove. Some pumpkin aroma, but I can't tell if it's just from the spices or if it's from pumpkin. The flavor has a sharpness that I don't care for. One of the spices is a little too strong, overpowering the others. The spices are very upfront, perhaps a little too strong. Tastes like pumpkin, but it could use a lot more balance with the spices because they are just too much. Has a medium mouthfeel but the drinkability suffers from the overspicing."
"Flavor exhibits the spices upfront, but not as full-on as the nose was making me expect, but then the taste is overpowered by an apple peel tartness, coupled with lots of alcohol burn. Mouthfeel and drinkability are just limited by the same issues that I have with the taste. Not something I would revisit, but I still have to admit it looked and smelled great."
"Drinkability - pricy but ghoulishly good, heh heh. The hands-down winner of this year's pumpkin/fall beer Halloween 'taste-off' and the newest 'must-buy' for my annual October fix."
"This beer is drinkable, but with the heavy spicing and alcohol, it may be a little too much for some. The bomber was more than enough for one sitting. I love pumpkin ales, and this one is top notch, and definitely recommended. If you're not big spice person, I'd think twice though."
"Clear, coppery orange with a big, fluffy head that left behind considerable lacing as it receded. Pie spice aroma (cinnamon, nutmet, allspice) with a little fruity sweetness that gives it a definite pumpkin character. The flavour starts off malty, but not overly sweet, with a fair bit of fruit and some grassy hops. Pie spices kick in towards the end and clove lingers in the finish with a fruity sweetness. Medium to full bodied with soft carbonation. Alcohol is completely masked. Quite nice. Whether it's by addition of pumpkin or a wise choice of yeast, the fruitiness in this beer really carries the day. A lot of pumpkin beers rely completely on spices for their character - things seem better balanced here than in most. Still, if you're not a fan of pie spices, this isn't going to work for you. Well done!"
"Drinkability: Very good. Easy to drink and share. Not so powerful so as to overwhelm anything else you might drink or eat afterwards."
"Pours a dark amber to copper color with a tan cap that flattens to a thin layer. Strong cinnamon nose, fruity, maybe orange, and spicy esters. Very spicy like a pumpkin ale should be but much richer here like roasted spices. Citrus and sour twang is a little offsetting. Thin to medium body with a full mouth that is slick and cloying. Detectable spices like allspice and clove but difficult to discern between them...well blended. Spice are so strong and rich they leave a slight burn on the palate. Malts are toasty and some caramel notes can be found later in the bottle. Unfortunately I want able to detect much pumpkin character, possible due to the heavy spices, but still well balanced and a very enjoyable brew."
"Cheers!"
"Nice malt body that is soon consumed by all the spices. Very flavorful to the finish. I agree with the previous review that this is definitely one of the better pumpkin ales on the market. A good froth livens up the hops on the palate."
"Pours a orangy brown with a tan head. Very frothy, yet not much smell, mainly sweet and malty. The taste is huge, tons of spice packed into this beer. It has a beer flavor to it with all the spice following right behind. (Cinnimon, Nutmeg, Cardamom, and Cloves as stated on the bottle) The taste is definitely the best attribute to this beer, and is not like anything I have ever tried includiing other pumpkin ales. This one is interesting and worth checking out especially if you are into pumpkin ales. The mouthfeel is somewhat harsh, lots of carbonation. Not something I could drink all night, the spices started to wear on me as I got to the bottom of the glass. Something worth looking into. Enjoy."
"Appropriate beer for the end of October. Bright amber body with copper/orange edges. Large, thick, long-lasting head. Sugary malt nose with plums, tropical fruit, pumpkin pie mix, cardamom, cloves, and nutmeg. Nice. Toasted, slightly bitter hop profile up front. Cake batter and spices come on strong. Figs and slightly sweet vegetal malt mix with generous, but not overpowering, spices (cardamom, nutmeg, vanilla) and fruity alcohol. Finish is warming, with pumpkin and spice checked by a residual bitterness. Medium-body with a creamy feel. I like this more than I thought I would, as Im not a huge fan of pumpkin beers. I think the higher alcohol and malt sweetness help make the spices more palatable."
"D- It's good. Nothing amazing but probably my favorite pumpkin ale so far."
"Up until about 30 seconds ago, Smuttynose's pumkin was my favourite pumkin ale. This is incredible. Lovely dark reddish brown colour with a huge sand coloured foamy cap that hung around for several minutes. Colossal pumkin pie smell!! No hops detectable whatsoever. Sweet malts, pumpkin, cloves, nutmeg, and cinnamon. Delicious!! The flavours blend together so nicely, and at 8%abv, there is a very slight warming sensation. Mouthfeel is certainly full bodied, but easy to drink. Big thanks go out to jwc215 for tossing this in on a trade. Quite possibly my new favourite autumn seasonal."
"Nice orangy hue with medium head that leaves no lacking on the glass. It's got a caramel and spice nose with maybe a soft yeast scent. Nicely sweet taste with the pumpkin spice to linget on the top of your mouth, Alcohol is really only noticable when it hits your belly, not obvious in the taste at all. Very interesting beer, that goes with the season. I wish I had a slice of pie to go with it. Mmmm...pie."
"Appearance has a slightly hazed copper amber hue with a large off white head leaves big streaks of even lacing with each sip this beer poured nice and thick. Aromatics incllude heavily spiced pumpkin pie tones including nutmeg, all spice, and cinnamon with a notable cream layer and syrupy alcohol sweetness to boot. Flavor has more sweet pumpkin with heavy doses of spice completely covering the palate with a mix of ripe fruit notes and alcohol cinge. Mouthfeel is syupy stick with sugars floating abroad evenly carbonated medium to fuller bodied pumpkin ale...not too cloying for an Imperial Pumpkin ale. Drinkability is decent but I'm still not big on this dose of spice to beverage it's definitely better than most standard pumpkin ales I seem to enjoy the higher alcohol versions better than the cookie cutter pumpkin ales."
"Neat stuff, a somewhat ramped-up version of the style. Pleasantly complex, and this would pair well with its kindred pie or maybe a whole Thanksgiving dinner."
"drinkability: pretty good"
"This is one saucy, spicy, seasonal sensation. I'm not shy about saying this is my cup of autumnal gourd. The spices are refreshingly vivid. The pumpkin is upstaged but earthy and real, and the overall effect is pleasing and cozy. If you liek it, it'll go down smooth and energetically. I like it, and it's a good reason to look forward to Fall every year."
"D: Delicious...really tastes like fall. Excellent flavors, very drinkable. I'm glad to have been sent 2 of these, will hope for more in the future. Highly recommended."
"This is my second pumpkin beer after DFH and I like this one better. The color is darker amber and the smell is all pumpkin pie and pulls no punches. Unlike DFH this one comes through with the taste with clear clove, cinnamon and orange peel. I know pumpkin is a tough taste but I would still like to taste more of the fruit. Can't say I would have more than one other than at Thankgiving but a nice attempt at a tough style. Thanks BitterBrian."
"OMFG! This is THE best Pumpkin beer I've had to date. That's a pretty heafty statement, considering the amount of Pumpkin beers I've had. I think the only one even close to it, is the Cottonwood Pumpkin. The smell is so damn close to a Pumpkin pie, you'd think someone shoved one into the bottle. The taste is far superior to the other Pumpkin beers, not only because the spices, malts, and hops are balanced out so damn well, but you'd never know that it was 8%. This makes it a dangerous beer though. Knock a few of these bad boys back and look out! On the other hand, it's good for keeping you warm during the cold October nights. Overall a damn fine beer. I just wish I could get it down in SC on a regular basis."
"Deep chestnut in color. Thick white fluffy head holds well for the size of the beer. There was a nice amount of lace on the glass. Cinnamon and nutmeg, along with pumpkin in the aroma. I expected a bigger aroma for an imperial style. Darker malt flavors, maybe a hin of licorice? Nutmeg and other spices follow. Not very clean as far as flavors, some anise as well? Medium body with a moderate amount of carbonation. I guess I was expecting liquid pumpkin pie, and it fell short of that."
"Very drinkable but not something I will stock up on. Definitely a seasonal drink."
"Overall a tasty pumpkin ale. For me, the ABV is a bit high for this style."
"Drinkability: Takes some getting used to, but this is one of my favorite pumpkin ales."
"This brew pours a deep reddish-copper color with an average-sized white head. The aroma a mix of spice (nutmeg, clove, cinnamon) and alcohol. Behind the initial smells, theres also some lightly roasted malt, caramel, and pumpkin. The taste is strong with spice and a strong hop bitterness, mingling with pumpkin and spice. Its not bad really, and is a lot more intense than most pumpkin beers. Lots of clove, which seems to fit the beer appropriately. The alcohol has a little warming quality after a while. Its full bodied, and quite drinkable. The pumpkin quality could be stronger, but overall I was impressed."
"D: Highly drinkable pumpkin. Top three for me this season. Glad I grabbed a few of these. Another hit from Weyerbacher."
"Bomber into a pint. Pours a medium red with about a finger's worth of head. This beer is all about the smell - cloves, cinnamon, nutmeg - it's very strong, but in a good way. This is an Imperial, remember. Follows through nicely in terms of taste and mouthfeel, especially when compared to most pumpkins. Pretty much everything I'm always looking for in a pumpkin beer and never quite seem to find. Wrap it up in an 8% ABV package, and I find it difficult to complain. Perfect for those chilly fall nights."
"Kudos again to Weyerbacher!"
"Without a doubt - my favorite pumpkin ale!"
"This beer is odd in that it has so many positive aspects and at the same time a whole bunch of unflattering touches. A bit heavy handed in the clove category and the hops seem a big much as well, but overall a nice attempt. It makes me think if other's are trying the imperial pumpkin, aiming for more of a big pumpkin malty beer might be better than overdoing the spice."
"Drinkability  Oh I can drink this, it just isnt the best out there. One of these a night could be nice!"
"Drinkability: A more delicious pumpkin ale, I am having a hard time thinking of."
"It then moves to a sweet malty cooked sugar syrupy feel on the palate that is balanced by a bitterness of acidic tart hops. The finish is slightly boozey but not as strong as expected from a 8% brew. This is a great """Imperial pumpkin""" delicious and satisfies my fall beer cravings."
"IntriqKen most certainly got this right. This beer certainly tastes like a homemade pumkin pie. I poured from a 12 oz bottle to a pint glass, getting about an inch and change of head. The head dissapeared quickly, and didn't leave much lace except for the side I poured towards. The smell and the taste are pure Fall, this has to be one of the greatest aspects of this season, great beer like this one. Don't drink and review."
"This is GOOD pumpkin beer. An honest fall treat."
"Better pumpkin ales out there..."
"Pours a hazy deep amber, a very modest head which dissipates quickly. Some spice smell that leads to surprise as the taste is much more intense than one would expect. Not overpowering, but full of flavor. Not much carbonation, but more drinkable than other Pumpkin Ales."
"D: They did a good job making this beer balanced. It could have easily been overspiced or too cloying. Flavor still leaves a tad to be desired."
"D - Not my favorite style but this one drinks nicely."
"Drinkability: ehhh no this is not easy to drink. that aftertaste is a mother. avoid this one"
"Overall, a decent brew. It's not my favorite Pumpkin Ale, (Cottonwood still reigns supreme in my book) but it is an interesting take on the style. A good choice for someone looking more for spice than pumpkin flavor."
"Thanks to sacfly for the DFH bocce weekend trade."
"Also notable: I enjoyed this beer and an apple sconce in tandem and the flavor interactions were fantastic."
"Highly drinkable pumkin ale. I love the fact that they're pushing the envelope with respect to abv compared to most pumkin ales. Though not listed on this site at the time I write this, the Weyerbacher site says it's 8%. Weyerbacher continues to come up with great unique beers."
"Pours a clear brown with highlights of copper. A little more than a finger of off-white head. Smells like a spicy pumpkin pie. Loads of nutmeg, cloves, cinnamon... Also noticing a little black pepper it seems. Great pumpkin flavor! The spices are all working well together. Full and creamy mouthfeel. Almost seems like you should put some whipped cream on it and enjoy it for dessert! This is right up there with a local pumpkin porter (from Four Peaks) as my favorite pumpkin beer."
"12oz. bottle. Brewed with pumkin and spices (cinnamon, nutmeg, cardamon & cloves). A clear very dark copper/orange ale with a large light tan head. Aroma was all about the spice, mainly clove and nutmeg. The pumpkin was hiding quite effectively until almost the end of the beer. Hops were fairly strong, and the malt was barely noticeable with everything else going on. Finally, you got a definate whiff of alcohol. Taste moves away from the aroma, in that the malt was quite prevalent - a sweet dark bread type of flavor - this was easily the sweetest of the 4 pumpkin ales I tried in this session. The hops were secondary, but quite present at the finish. This, combined with the spices and a peppery aftertaste gave a pretty good bite at the end. Other tasting notes included alcohol/medicinal flavors, clove, and mint. To me, a pumpkin flavor was not really in the mix, but you picked it up a little in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel was medium in body, fairly light carbonation, and creamy. Alcohol made for a rather drying finish. Overall, I didn't care for the alcohol/medicinal notes and I think they tried to do a little too much with this one. Not sure we need an Imperial Pumkin Ale, but hats off to them for trying."
"Gingerbread men with buttons made of cloves and hop-flower hats are dancing in a shower of holiday spices before putting on a synchronized swimming spectacle in a pool of pumpkin pie filling. This is perfect. Wow, talk about nailing it. Is it November yet? All I can think about is which foods I want to pair with this beer, and a thanksgiving feast fits the bill. The mouthfeel bolsters the experience further as alcohol warms the inside cheeks and is even tingly at times. Goodness gracious me, why is this so drinkable? Even though my sips are moderate in size, they are frequent in occourence. Beers like this one make me feel great all over and really work out my smile muscles. If I had this with turkey I'd enter suspended animation and wake up with the black bears."
"damn. maybe i do like pumpkin beers"
"This poured a hazy gorgeous orange red with a small foamy tan head. The aroma is sweet as hell. It is really cinnamony! Loads of pumpkin pie like flavor. The nutmeg is also strong. The taste is quite malty with lots of spice and a small amount of hop flavor to balance. The alcohol is simply not detectable with all the awesome autumness that is going on here. The mf is slick, kinda moderate. This is incredibly drinkable. I will have to stock up."
"All in all, I wouldn't pass it over if offered, but I would still buy a DFH Punkin Ale or a Smuttynose instead."
"Nice dark orange brown beer crowned with a light brown head. Lots of fun spice and malt in the nise, great pumpkin notes, nutmeg, cinnamon, all the good stuff. You can tell there's alcohol from the warmth, but not the taste. A whole lot of pumpkin, spice, and malty sweetness get together and play nice. A real delight on tap. Like sucking down a fantastic pumpkin ice cream, lots of flavor, but not overpowering or cloying. Very creamy and smooth, again like the ice cream almost. Finishes remarkably clean for such a big beer with so much flavor. There's some hops too, but not apparent until you belch a little up. Yum, it's even good the second time around."
"Worth a try, but maybe not a rebuy."
"Overall- I was so excited to try this but it was a let down. $4.75 for a 22 oz bomber."
"Off-the-chart tastes, thanks crwills. 2006 edition. Very orange, a little crowning head, and lace in the glass. All kinds of spice aroma. 8% alcohol. Significant malting but still on the spicey side with nutmeg, cardommon, cinammon, ginger. Altogether too much.I had it again a couple months later and it was OK."
"drinkability for this started off 'great', then i crossed that out and went to 'good', then crossed that out too. at first i was really into this one, but the longer it sat and the more i drank, the less i liked it. still one of the most interesting pumpkin beers i've tried."
"This beer is very drinkable. Smooth and pretty well-done compared to its peers."
"Another over-spiced pumpkin brew. I keep trying them and they keep disappointing me...."
"I thoroughly enjoyed this pumpkin ale. I'm usually not a big pumpkin ale fan, but this one seemed a curiosity being that it was an Imperial. I'm really glad I gave it a go. This will certainly become a fall staple and something to look forward to when the leaves start changing."
"Cheers!"
"Well compared to the bottle I reviewed a few weeks ago which I had aged in my cellar since '05; this years version definitely is showing it's youth. Bright and lively, perfume type flavors. Overwhelming nutmeg and all spice. Pumpkin and cinnamon even things out a bit but I think this years could have benefited from more malt backbone. Especially the mouthfeel. There is so much going on in this it's absurd. Extremely complex and will be great cellared a year when everthing comes together a little better. Otherwise this is a damn tasty beer."
"D--This has become a new staple in the fall for me, I am going to go buy a bunch if they have hit, what a great beer!!!"
"D - This beer is drinkable, but with the slightr little chemical bits in there, it leaves me a little let down."
"This beer pours a clear dark rddish mahogny with a giant tan foamy head. A very impressive looking beer. The smell is very pungent with cinnamon,nutmeg,and """real""" pumpkin. The taste is creamy and like the smell has cinnamon,nutmeg, and real pumpkin,not the artifiacial flavoring. I hate pumpkin beers,but this is pretty good. The m/f is light and well balanced making this, along with football, something to look forward to every fall."
"Pretty good flavors, a bit powdery due to the heavy spice profile, with just a slight detection of the 8% abv. Unique, but nothing that draws me into having another glass."
"I really liked the electric sour tingle to this one. It really worked well with the spices and helped compliment the pumpkin."
"The taste again is quite spicy, and the cardamom really pops, which is a nice change of pace from other spiced beers. Nutmeg, cloves, and cinnamon are all in the background, along with just a hint of pumpkin flavor. I wouldn't call it """overly""" spicy, but the spices do dominate the slightly sweet malty body of this beer. Mouthfeel is very creamy,and I don't detect much alcohol on the palate, so drinkability is fairly high."
"D - This beer resides on the fringes of the Pumpkin Ale category, largely due to its magnitude both in alcohol content and its flavor profile. With these points in mind, I find this beer to be a fantastic harbinger of the tastes and smells of autumn and early winter. Wonderful for a chilly evening as we count down the days to Halloween..."
"Overall, I love Weyerbacher, so I'm a bit biased, but I could drink this all night I think; or at least til I fell over!"
"Its getting to be that time of year again,I am not a fan of pumpkin pie but I enjoy the fall pumpkin brews.This poured a clear rich amber/copper with a tight formed slight off white 1/2 finger head that held some good retention,pumpkin pie spice mainly in the nose cardimom and mace with big nutmeg notes,that spice to me is just to big flavor wise the pumpkin flavors as light as they are are just overwhelmed by spices nutmeg and mace mainly with notes of cinnamon and clove as well.The point is the spice flavor are just a little to big for this beer everything else...the nose and appearance are top notch,damn its so close to being great."
"The body reminds me of apple cider. It's very dark with an almost orange tinge. The head was around an inch thick. Nose is full of nutmeg, cinamon, but not really any pumpkin to speak of. When I taste, I taste pretty much those same spices .... but hardly any pumpkin. Don't get me wrong, it tastes GOOD but I feel like I'm watching Taxi Driver ... with no Deniro. Mouth is rich and creamy. I definitely like this beer and would love to try it again. I just wish it had more pumpkin flavor than it does."
"I had reviewed this beer when it was first released and enjoyed it but was not overly impressed with it at the time. I just tapped a bottle today on my birthday and was a bit more impressed. The beer poured a hazy orange/red color with a thin off white head. The aroma still has a nice cinnamon and clove smell even after sitting in my fridge since Halloween. The taste is equally spicey. There are tones of cinnamon and clove and pumpkin but the pumpkin is not overwhelming. I have a few more of these so I will havve to sit on some of them and see how they develop over time."
"Beer is good. Happy pumpkin bering!"
"Bottle @ Spuyten Duyvil, Brooklyn. Light bronze color, with a full, white head. A bit darker in color that most pumpkin ales. Cinnamon and nutmeg stick out in the fairly aromatic nose, with hints of pumpkin and delicate hop. Really rich banana and clove flavors initially, which fades into hints of cinnamon and nutmeg. Pumpkin dominates the 5 second finish, with hints of vanilla. Massive body of exploding flavors. A tasty, full bodied, unique, delicious treat. Great crafting here."
"Mouthfeel is medium, very smooth and drinkable. Hedges more toward an O-fest than a pumpkin ale, but the pumpkin elements are quite solid. I think this stronger """Imperialized""" version is works better than most conventional pumpkin ales."
"Cheers2Beers"
"thanks blithev"
"A very solid pumpkin spice brew. A nice treat to be shared, if and whenever possible. Although I can see why some people don't like it. It can border on the love it or hate it line of character for some. To each their own. Mine is thimbs up; as is the Mrs. - who probably liked it alot more then I did. Good stuff."
"D - I think this is my favorite Weyerbacher yet (although both Decadance and Insanity are definitely competition). The flavor is pronounced, yet not overbearing. It is too strong to session at 8.0% abv, but a bomber of this will treat you pretty well. Definitely a fabulous dessert beer or even a nice apperteif. Beers like this are why I love Weyerbacher."
"I've had this one sitting around for a while and just never had the urge to drink it. Figured I better get to it before it gets too old. Golden brown color with a very thin head that leaves no lacing. Smell of cloves, cinnamon, nutmeg and tons of other spices. Very nice smell, i was't thinking i would like this but it's not overpowering like i was anticipating. The spices fill your nose as you drink but the malt really dominates the tongue. Overall a nice beer. Much better than i was anticipating. Kind of a novelty beer that i wouldn't drink very often but surprisingly pleasant."
"got this in a trade but I do not know who sent it lost my trading papers. but a big thanks goes to the person who sent this. when I popped the cap to this beer I got a big whiff of cloves. poured an nice honey with a light brown head that didnt last and left no lacing. aroma pumpkin pie, and all the spices that go with it, cinnamon, nutmeg. flavor same as the aroma with malts as a topping and a hint of alcohol thrown in. nice and smooth. one of the better pumpkin beers I have had."
"I think this could even be creamier and still be very appealing to non-pumpkin beer drinkers, but stillt his is far and away the best pumpkin beer I have ever had and also the most """PUMPKIN""" tasting."
"OK, I actually like this beer. I didn't think I did the firs time I had it, but it's grown on me. Cloudy copper brown, good inital head that recedes quickly. Smells very sweet, like honeyed, spiced, pumkpin pie, or maybe even a little artificial like one of those holiday candles. Not awful though. Bam -- the spices really hit you hard up front, with the pungecny of the clove and nutmeg packing the biggest wallop. You don't get a while lot of earthiness from pumpkin, but you do get alot of sugar and therefore alcohol and sweetness. Really velvety smooth mouthfeel. It's an after-dinner beer, make no mistake, big and malty, and heavily spiced. I wouldn't want more than the 22 oz. bottle I had in a sitting, and probably would prefer about 10 oz. But it was good. If you like spiced beers."
"Body is above medium, with coarse carbonation and a creamy. rich texture. Definately one of the best pumpkin ales out there."
"Medium bodied and well carbonated, a good beer, but more of a nightcap than a """drinking beer.""""
"Overall a fantastic pumpkin ale to share amongst good friends sitting next to the fireplace. Segues perfectly with the winter/X-Mas seasonals also. A cheek warmer for sure. Very, very nice."
"This pumpkin ale pours a nice copper color. The head was descent but did not last very long. The smell was pleasant, very nicely spiced. The taste is intially enjoyable but the spices eventually become a bit oveverwhelming. This is a rather good pumkin ale worth giving a try. Enjoy!"
"Pours a pumpkiny color, with a good head and decent head retention. Taste and aroma is up front spice in your face, with some pumpkin flavor there too. Nutmeggy and clovey. Alcohol is well hidden and the malt and hops play a background support to the spices. I like this beer, but I'm not sure if it's all that """imperial""" of a pumpkin ale. Thanks to Pezoids for the chance top try this!"
"Bomber bottle, w/o freshness dating. Pours dark almond and medium hazy, typical tan head and average lacing. make sure to let this one warm up abit. the nose and fall/pumpkin flavors need some time to roll out. Medium spice in the nose and palate. I'd much rather smell and taste hops and malt in my brew, so this style ever has been one on my favorites, however, this one has some added alcohol punch and the flavors are fairly well rounded and meshed with the rest of the beer. Worth a try if youre looking for a fall themed brew. Might be decent with Thanksgiving dishes."
"22 ounce bottle. $4.79 at OUAV."
"While not as bad as some of my BA Buddies made out, it did not convince me that pumpkin ale is anything other than a Halloween night novelty."
"Weyerbacher Imperial Pumpkin Ale won't be everyone's cup of pumpkin juice, but it's mine. I applaud the willingness of the brewery to aim high and to give those of us interested in this style something to chew on. Pushing the envelope sometimes results in nothing more than paper cuts. In this case, it works. Thanks to BeerBeing for the bomber. Happy Halloween."
"This was a dark amber beer with little head and moderate lacing. The spiciness of the aroma immediately gotme;hints of clove, cinnamon, pepper and nutmeg. The mouthfeel was watery and bland. I have to be honest, the taste was disappointing; the flavor was mild at best; bitter hoppiness rounded out what started as pure spice. Maybe I need to sample more pumpkin ales, but I wouldn't recommend this to anyone wanting to try one for the first time."
"Drinkability: I really really dig this beer. The alchol is extremely well-hidden, especially for 8%. It makes no sense to me, but it's great nonetheless. Great for fall or winter, and I kind of want to get a case of this. Definitely pick up some if you see it to try, especially if you're a pumpkin ale fan."
"And, thanks to BlitheringIdiot, ...Beer is Good, Happy Pumpkin Spice Beering!!!"
"Drinkability & Notes: This is a good pumpkin ale and compares favorably to Dogfish Punkin' Ale. I'd like to have these side-by-side for a real comparison, but I think I prefer the DFH just a bit more. Definitely a drinkable brew, though. I'd get this again."
"Burnt orange in color, poured with very little head that soon disappeared. Very tasty. The spices were evident (especially the cloves) and the pumpkin taste prevailed. Maybe I'm to familiar with the balance of the DFH Punkin Head because this was just a bit washed out. Still as stated below, it is very drinkable for such a high ABV pumpkin ale. This was probably my second favorite Pumpkin Ale this season."
"Pours a bright reddish orange with a thick creamy tan head and decent retention. Smell is very strong and very nice, with the nutmeg, cinnamon, and ginger pumpkin spices all coming through nicely, with just a hint of pumpkin as well. Where the pumpkin is barely detectable in the nose, it really jumps out and asserts itself in the flavor, with a very spicey finish full of the aforementioned spices and white pepper. Medium bodied with a very smooth and dry mouthfeel. This is one of the best pumpkin ales I've had, a little spicey at times, but definitely one I'd have again."
"I definitely like this better than Buffalo Bill's Pumpkin beer, but it really does not seem like anything more than a supped up version of that beer, a tad more spice, more malt sweetness (which gives this a much better balance), and perhaps a bit of actual pumpkin character. All these go to making this a better beer than Buffalo Bill's, but I would like to see more focus on the actual pumpkin character."
"Mouthfeel is awesome- chewy, full, bubbly- just really alive on the tongue. Highly drinkable- a bit sweet after a few, but the first couple are easy to get down- too easy."
"Now!"
"Overall: Certainly in the upper half of the ten or so pumpkin ales I've had this year, and I appreciate the stab at something a little more muscular in the style. Could use a bit less spice and a bit more pumpkin, though."
"Overall, this was quite the enjoyable brew. Would I crack open more than one in a night? Maybe, but probably not (with that said, there's probably no pumpkin ale that I would often drink four 12 oz bottles of in one night...which is obviously just about the equivalent of two of these bombers). Would I go back to this one in the autumn months? You bet. Give it a try and enjoy."
"The mouthfeel is lightly crisp and smooth at the start and finish. The finish is long on the spice. The drinkability is down as the overwhelming spiciness tires your tastebuds. Looks great, smells great, but goes downhill from there."
"A slight bitterness somewhere mixed in. Not sure if it is hops or some other taste. But whatever it is, it prevents this beer from being cloying, which happens a lot in this style."
"Mouthfeel is very rich...very rich. Bready and very spicy. Spiciness lasts well after the swallow in this one...perhaps too long."
"Left a very dry, spice laden taste in the mouth, much like a saison. Not overly woth having a few."
"Smells of clove, pumpkin, and cinnamon in that order. The taste however begins with a strong cinnamon and ends slowly with cardamom and hints of clove. Crisp in the front of the mouth, smooth and slightly thin in the sip, but substatial in the swallowing. A rather drinkable beer, perfect with a meal or desert applicable to the season, I could imagine having two or three of these in a night of drinking."
"Notes: Found this at From the Vine near Polaris (Columbus, OH). Had to reserve a bottle, as this sells before it's stocked. Not bad for $5.99."
"This one kinda blows! A shame too as it sounded so good. I always give these new Weyerbacher brews a whirl, but they so often dissapoint me horribly. It's a shame too as this brewery really is hit or miss, and when they are on, they are on (like at the last open house!). Anyways, a dull glowing orange/amber with an off-white dirty dishwater head that dies quickly and leave minimalistic lacing. Aromas are like vegetable soup, DMS abounds, and some spices try to cover it up, but fail badly. Like DFH punkin' ale when it is a year old and has been bathing in the sun. Taste is not much better. Thin with an artificial sweetness and spiciness as well as those vegetal notes. Mouthfeel is thin and not too appealing. Drinkability is blah. I'll always try new Weyerbacher brews, as sometimes they really impress...However, sometimes, their new beers are nothing to speak of. This is one of the latter. Try it once to quench your curiosity...and than move on...move on..."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: This one is fairly easy to drink once. I doubt if I will repeat. I just could not taste the pumpkin"
"Not sure what the problem is here, but it really just seems that all that spice was thrown in to cover up something. Were the pumpkins bad? I don't know, I don't want to know. Like I said, one bottle is more than enough. That's my curiosity satisfied."
"Drinkability: Appropriate for the time of year but it gets a little old after a while. Nice to enjoy while watching some college football but probably won't be sampling this again any time soon."
"Nowhere close to what I consider the golden standard of pumpkin ales: Punkin Ale by DFH. This is overly hopped, overly spiced, and in general, overly done."
