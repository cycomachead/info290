"Flavor a bit too strong, bitter aftertaste, oily feel."
""
"All around solid pumpkin ale."
""
""

"Taste like pumpkin creme brulee. Sweet dessert pumpkin taste with a nice punch."
""
""
""
""
"The pie crust flavor is a little weird but quite unique which gives it some points. A good beer overall."
""
""
"Pumking is a fantastic brew, the taste of pumpkin is very evident, but not overpowering.  Normally I am not a fan of flavored beers like this, but it is done quite well."
"Absolutely my favorite pumpkin beer. It's outstanding!"
""
""
"I tasted it once and fell in love with it.  No other pumpkin beer can hold a candle."
"Every year the ABV drops, they brew more and more and  of course the price goes up... Boooo Southern Tier, once great beer is lost in the shuffle with the hundreds of other pumpkin beers"

"Very strong pumpkin flavor. A little too malty for my liking."
""
""

"Bitter, heavy pumpkin taste and aftertaste -- with alcohol too prominent."
"Overall-  this was poured from a bomber and was quite good, but when I had as a draft in the fall, it was great.  Probably my favorite pumpkin beer."
"Maybe a slightly biased review. But I do love this beer, my favorite out of everything I have had, actually. One of the few beers I get really excited to come out and that I will actively seek out. I tend to only try new things and Pumpking is definitely a huge exception."

"Best pumpkin beer of them all"
""
""
"idk first time trying  this....everyone was telling """aww, try this man it taste like a pumpkin pie in the bottle'...tried it and idk what kind of pie there eating but was far from any pumpkin pie i ever had, lets just say it ended up in someones corn field on the way home"
""
""
""
""
""
"One of the best pumpkin beers I've had."
"Another rare pumpkin ale that feels nice all the way through. Quite heavy handed as well."
""
""
"This years Southern Tier Pumking was a huge disappointment. Over Spiced, Over Rated and tasted like line cleaner. The Warlock on the other hand was a 5 of 5."
""
""
"Pumpkin Pie in a bottle... absolutely delicious... not a session beer(far too sweet), but the bomber is the perfect amount. Satisfying desert after a hard day's work or a big meal...your choice"
""
""
""
""
"Sickeningly sweet. Tastes like a Starbucks pumpkin spiced latte."
"This is my favorite seasonal beer in my favorite season. Everything about this awesome brew gets my blood boiling. Love it"
""
""
""
""
"Maybe a bad 750 ml bottle? to me just has an off taste."
""
"The feel of this is actually medium to light bodied. This is a lot to this beer but it is highly drinkable and has a nice juicy feel that hides the higher ABV of this beer."
"It really does taste like pie: crust, cream, spice and pumpkin. I’m not sure I want that, smooth and integrated though it is, but it hits the concept like all this ST beers do - it’s just not as much fun as most of those. Too lean, too hot, a bit of work altogether - but oddly tasty, too. 4"
"Best pumpkin beer hands down, not too heavy on the pumpkin, a little more time spent on other flavors in this brew"
"Overall:  This is a delicious pumpkin beer.  Great flavors of pumpkin and spices.  I’m definitely getting this every year!!  Several bottles, too!"
"Exceptional pumpkin taste!  Great for Thanksgiving or Halloween."
""
""
"Got a growler fill of this when it was in season (2014).  Hands-down my favorite Pumpkin beer.  This one is the pumpkin pie, nutmeg, with the whipped cream on top.  Love it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not as """big""" as I expected it to be.  Nice pumpkin flavor with the usual pie spices.  A nice warming alcohol spiciness.  Sweet but not overly so."
"Best pumpkin beer as far as taste goes"
""
""
""
"This is my favorite beer."
"Best. Beer. Ever. This is my favorite beer"
"I thought it was going to be better with all the hype. Too sweet. Too light. Similar to Smashed Pumpkin."
""
""
"One of my favorites. The hint of graham cracker puts it over the top."
""
""
"This is by far my favorite beer, period. I've tried numerous pumpkin brews this previous yr and this stomps them all without question. Anyone who says this beer tastes like candy corn, do not pay attention to them! I've disliked candy corn all my life and this beer tastes nothing like it. I'll leave u with this image/taste in ur head... Are u ready? Graham cracker vanilla-flavored Wheaties. Yes Wheaties the cereal. Think about it."

"O - Probably the best pumpkin beer that I have had outside of Southern Tier's Warlock.  4/5"
"The translucent copper-creamsicle ale crashes in to a goblet, forming an inch of lush foam. The linen colored head stands barely an inch, with densely packed bubbles and thin lacing around the rim. The glorious smell of fresh baked pumpkin pie fills the nose, complete with a buttery graham cracker crust. There's an assortment of pumpkin potpourri spices that serve to compliment the hearty gourdlike aroma. The first sip.... flavor overload. This beer is a sweet spice-bomb in the strictest sense. Each tiny sip packs enough flavor to embarrass most of its competition. The buttery, sweet malts are there, but you only get a fleeting moment with them before the spices come barreling in. There's also a slight hop bite that ties this beer together and keeps it from completely overwhelming your senses. At 8.6%, the alcohol is well hidden, but you could hide a Buick behind the cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg and allspice. They stick to your palette like a burr, embedded until you raise the glass again to wash away the taste and start over. The mouthfeel is a little lighter than you might expect from a beer of this magnitude. A richer, fuller body would suit this brew well, creating an unparallelled seasonal dessert-beer. The current beer just doesn't have the constitution to support so much character. At any rate, this is a slow sipper. I can do one of these each year, and I continue to appreciate this outrageous ode to pumpkin pie."

"This review is specifically for the 2014 edition. I was not thrilled at all with the flavor of the brew at all. This was way, way too hoppy. In past years the flavor was all about the wonderful flavor of pumpkin and the spices that infuse those pies at Thanksgiving. This year, it was as if the pumpkin was an afterthought. Overall, the flavor did not come close to any of the past experiences."
"A great holiday and seasonal beer!"
"Damn!!!  That's a pumpkin beer!  I feel like I've tried them all since my wife is a self avowed pumpkin ale freak.  We happened to see it on tap at a growler shop over the weekend and added it to her 4-flight tasting.  Hands down the biggest pumpkin flavor.  Like a fresh pie with spices and comfort food galore.  A bit sweet for my taste but definitely a palate cleanser for all the porters and stouts we tend to consume around the holidays."
""
"Poured deep orange with 1/2 thick head that lightly dissipated. S:rich pumpkin pie crust with cinnamon and nutmeg. T: almost spot on with how it smells; pumpkin pie crust with hints of cinnamon, nutmeg and slight hints of allspice. I have to admit, I'm a fan of the sweeter craft seasonal beers, and this is one of them. Best pumpkin beer I've had to date. Absolutely amazing."
""
"Lots of pumpkin flavor and spices"
"Tastes like pumpkin pie.  I taste a lot of pie crust, a buttery, flaky type of flavor.  A lot of pumpkin spices.  I feel like the pie crust flavor was most noticible.  Also worth noting is that everything tasted natural.  No artificial like flavoring to be had here."

"very heavy aroma of spices..cinnamon,nutmeg,allspice,good pumpkin taste,although somewhat diminished.slight sweetness,as in the crust of the pie.alc.% is over 8%,but you get no hint of it.nice aftertaste,no bitterness.if you like pumpkin pie,this is for you;if you don't,you might be disappointed."

"Schlafly and dogfish and weyerbacher do a much better job with this style. Not a huge fan of this one. Interesting, but too heavy on the nutmeg. Wish the malt character would come through a bit more. Would be good as a dessert beer."
"By far my favorite fall brew. I've tried gallons of other pumpkin brews however, STBC has mastered this one. Aroma. Appearance. Body. Consistency and taste. BAM!!!!"

"Overall- Such a rich and flavorful beer, spices are nicely balanced, and pumpkin flavors are real fleshy. The highlight of this beer is the creaminess, just a wonderful combination of buttery vanilla with the caramel malt notes. A great seasonal beer, and just full of the perfect flavors for fall/holiday season."

"Very good punkin ale.  Dogfish head is still better in my opinion.  I think Southern Tier went a little heavy on the spices, but still- very solid punkin ale and worth a drink!"

"One of my favorite beers.  Great flavor with the pie crust smell as you open it and perfect for a fall night.  They weren't afraid to have a lot of flavor in this beer which I appreciate as so many pumpkin beers are too subdued.  Split a bomber with the wife or drinking buddy."

"Poured from a brown 22 oz. bottle. Has a rich golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of fresh pumpkin pie, graham crackers. Tate is pumpkin pie, vanilla, some graham cracker, perfectly spiced, a touch of alcohol as it warms. Feels creamy and delicious in the mouth and overall is a beer worth seeking out."

"This is the first pumpkin beer I have ever liked.   It's pumpkin pie taste and great finish make we wish I could get it year round.   A must try."

"O:  after trying a handful of pumpkin ales last season, I swore I was done with them.  a friend said I should at least try the Pumking once, and I'm glad they did -- it's good.  it's a load of spice and relatively sweet, but I like it because it has much more taste than any other pumpkin ale I've tried."

"This shit sucks. Artificial cinnamon bullshit. Sorry."
"Hazy mid orange in the glass even after a quick pour there wasn't much on top of this one.  So I don't really know what to say about the smell here.  There is a lot going on as I'm getting a ton of spice cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, ginger along with a heavy toasted biscuit aroma.  This is very reminiscent of the Warlock by Southern Tier.  The taste is quite similar to the smell all of the spice is there and there is a pretty good caramel malt base so I'm sure a lot of people could find this quite nice.  However, I think that this is far too brash and heavy handed to rate any higher than average as I'm more a fan of the milder versions of the style.  There is a touch of bitterness that is found near the finish and that goes along with a medium body and medium level of carbonation in general this beer tends to be quite sweet.  Overall I'm not a very big fan of this because I don't like such a strongly spiced pumpkin ale, however, it is a good representation of the style that I'm sure some will enjoy."
""
""
""
""
""
"I can see some people would really like this but it isn't for everyone."
"Bottle shared with a friend. Pours amber with a white head Aroma of pumpkin and spices. (nutmg, ginger, anice) Tastes of pumpkin pie: vanilla, butter, and nutmeg. Medium bod. Better than pumpkin pie."
""

"A Halloween tradition! Pretty tasty, nice pumpkin and spice flavors, tastes like pumpkin pie, with some hoppy bitterness in the finish, pretty tasty indeed! Something very nice to relax with on a Halloween night by myself, or with a friend or loved one. I prefer to chill with this on Halloween versus going out and dealing with routy people."
""
"Overall: This really is what I am looking for in a pumpkin beer. If I can find another one, I might purchase it before the season ends until next year."
"Overall this beer is a great pumpkin beer. I generally don't go to the beer store to really seek out pumpkin beers because I almost find it to too trendy of a style and one that can be a hit or miss. I like to go for the bigger abv/imperial pumpkin ales since they tend to be more flavorful and certainly are more exciting than your standard Shipyard Pumpkinhead. This one is just like drinking pumpkin pie. Have it with some pie and vanilla ice cream and thank me latter!"
""
"Overall: A very solid take on a pumpkin beer. Big and sweet but still nicely drinkable."

"I tried many pumpkin beers over my vacation this last weekend and Southern Tiers Pumking stood out well above the pack.  Though I wouldn't compare it to drinking apple pie it does a have a distinctive sweetness due to the vanilla.  I couldn't stop thinking about it and had to go down to Total Wine to get 4 more bottles.  Highly recommended to any fans of pumpkin beer."

"Quite simply one the best beers I've enjoyed.  Very strong malt flavor throughout.  It smells like the mash step of homebrewing mixed with pumpkin pie spice.  The taste is full bodied with strong malt flavor with overtones of pumpkin pie.  Very smooth finish for the ABV."

"O: A good pumpkin beer. I think it captures the pumpkin taste nicely but it loses me every few sips as it can have too much spice that leads to a kind of potpourri taste. But it's nothing that prevents me from picking up a bottle or two a year. Is it the best pumpkin beer I've had? Not by a long shot but it doesn't feel like the season without one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, the total effect is actually higher than one might expect from the component parts. The flavors work very well together, enhanced by the aroma. The mouth feel, as mentioned is on the thin side, but doesn't distract the other senses. It is excellently enjoyable and definitely worth sharing with friends over a slice of pie or a pumpkin mousse."
"Not my usual cup of...beer, but trying my girlfriend's I was impressed. A bit too sweet and forward. Tasted more of gingerbread than pumpkin."

"Pours a orangey honey color. Smells great. Sweet and spicy. Tastes of pumpkin but it isn't over the top. You can pick up the spices but they aren't overwhelming either. It had this sweetness on the back end. Almost like a cookie. Butter maybe. It was unique. I liked what it offered at the end. It was different enough that I enjoyed drinking the bomber trying to figure out what I was having. Good pumpkin beer."
"Had this beer last year on tap, and loved it.  Went to buy in after Haloween and it was sold out.  This year I went to my favorite beer store and the price was almost $9.00/bottle.  Needless to say I'll be waiting to buy it on tap."
""
""
""
"Sadie got a bomber of this for me for my birthday.  I've been saving it until it was closer to Halloween.  Drank it last night while watching the Simpson's Treehouse of Horror.  Great pumpkin pie flavor with a considerable alcohol warmth.  Probably the best pumpkin beer so far."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I seem to enjoy this beer more while it warms up. At first this brew is lightly flavored. Yet it does improve while it warms. I'm not being wowed by this by any means. While I'm not being impressed, it is a well crafted brew. Not offensive yet not breaking the boundaries in Pumpkin beers. At the end of the day and personal opinions are rested. This brew is Worthy."
""
"Maybe it's just me but I like pumpkin/harvest ales to have a punch-you-in-the-face pumpkin and spice flavor. This one is just lacking that extra pumpkin-ness I'm looking for. It's good but not there for me. For an 8.6% ale, I would also expect some kind of a kick from the higher gravity. I probably wouldn't get this one again."

"My favorite pumpkin beer"

"Deep orange color, almost no head but thin white ring, some alcohol legs but not much stick and stay in the lacing.  Huge pumpkin pie aroma!  Love the smell.  Pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg, pumpkin pie spices, and graham cracker.  Taste follows with an opening of vegetal pumpkin flavor, pumpkin pie spices from the nose hit mid way, buttery graham cracker profile underneath and a nice hit of spicy hop flavor in the finish.  Decent carbonation carries a medium body to a creamy finish.  The finish could be cleaned up a bit and the spices dialed back just a touch.  One of my favorite pumpkin beers overall with classic fall flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This has got some bite to it...they need to tame the spices just a bit and this could end up being a world class pumpkin brew...the finish on this one is a bit rough.  Overall, still a darn good beer!  Just not on the top of my list."
"Wow.  Although I did see this beer highly rated on multiple websites as a top pumpkin beer, I did not expect to drink, well, pumpkin pie.  This has a LOT of sugar, but isn't overly sweet, with the thick pumpkin taste, along with spices, pie crust, and a very slight malt/hop kick.  I would say this is like no beer i have ever had - when i poured it into the glass, the head was almost non-existent, but there was plenty enough carbonation; from here, the first sip seemed to shock me, with the fresh pumpkin pie overtaking my mind.  It is decently thick, and with the taste of all aspects (already listed) of pumpkin pie, and a little beer, taking over with HUGE flavor.  Some may think it is sweet, but it really isn't as sweet as you may think/expect.  I think it is perfect, and less sweet than pumpkin pie is.  Overall, amazing beer and experience."

"O- despite all the negative feedback, now that I've actually tried it, I'm hooked. Its such a good desert beer, I hope my beer store still has some bottles cause I need a few in the cellar and in my fridge. 5 out of 5 with no doubt."
"Terrible. I love love love pumpkin beers and this one was recommended to me at a specialty beer store because I told him I like Elysian's NightOwl. This is nothing like that. I would drink NightOwl over this any day or actually I would drink the pumpkin beer from the local craft brewery a few miles from us. This tastes nothing like pumpkin and had such a strong disgusting smell and taste but I couldn't put my finger on what it was. My husband thought it was hazelnut. Whatever it was, it was terrible."

"Excellent flavor. Notes of caramel popcorn and pumpkin pie."
"Overall: I was not a fan of this beer despite liking it more previously.  Not sure if this is due to this year's batch, the bottle, or it failing in comparison to many of the other pumpkins I've had but I will not revisit this one."

"This beer is one of my favorite all time beers.  Not only just the best pumpkin beer.  Love the aroma line the sweetness.  Carbonation perfect and Carmel Color This is far under valued for the product.  I loved it on draft if you are lucky but the bomber is no compromise.  Keep brewing this masterpiece"

"22 oz bomber, bottled 6/19. no head, not much carbonation-appears pretty still in the tulip glass. appearence is a very hazy golden yellow. smells AMAZING, like i just carved out a pumpkin for a jack-o-lantern. pumpkin pulp, sweet cinnamon, pumpkin pie. tastes like liquid pumpkin pie, very spiced-cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla. pretty sweet, medium body, somewhat creamy mouthfeel. very rich, a little cloying, some alcohol in the backend. its distinctive among pumpkin ales. hope to have another on thanksgiving-but thats it."

"This is somewhat like drinking pumpkin pie filling.  It's just kind of odd on the palate from start to finish.  The alcohol to me is well hidden, as this is easy to quaff.  Pumpkin beers have never rated high on my desire list, but I would love to find a solid representative of the style as something to look forward to every October.  DF Punkin' Ale is the closest to that go to that I've found."
""
"pours a pale orange color, with a some foam that quickly dissipates into just some bubbles on the side of the glass. Very Fizzy.  Pumpkin spice flavor on smell and taste.  almost too much pumpkin spice on the flavor.  Not really all that enjoyable in the taste department.  Definitely there are MUCH better Pumpkin beers than this."
""
""
""

"Overall the flavors are not melding and as a result this is not very enjoyable.  I can't say that about too many brews.  I thought it was odd that Southern Tier out of the blue decided to ship to the Arizona market for the first time...kind of wonder if they dumped a bad batch..."
""
""
"Extra .25 because of the potential it reaches when you age it 6 months exactly. Only at that point does it become truly spectacular. Otherwise, it's just too sweet. I get excited to see these at the end of the """season"""- that's when I load up and save it for a spring treat."
"BOD 8/10/14.  Clear light amber pour.  Fair head, lacing and retention.  Wonderful nose of strong pumpkin over balanced spicy notes of clove and nutmeg.  As it warms, biscuit malt, cinnamon and vanilla notes appear. Medium bodied with an almost slick mouthfeel.  Normal carbonation with a bit of effervescence on the finish.  The flavor profile is intense, complex and fairly well balanced considering the brewer's desired effect - it comes at you like an unrestricted NASCAR racer at 'Dega (ie. over 220 mph).  It begins by smashing you in the face with pumpkin, that then flows into a smash in the face of the aforementioned spices.  Clove takes the lead in the middle and slowly fades into a vanilla note over a rich biscuit and bready sweetness.  The finish is smooth and a blend of the flavors linger against a nice mild alcohol burn at the back of the throat."
""
"Loved the color and the flavor, but it lacked body and had no lacing to speak of. Yes, I'd buy it again because it tasted that good (22 oz. bottle bought at Zipp's in Minneapolis and recommended wisely by their Beer Guru Shaughn), and I would definitely turn my friends on to it, if I had any friends, but I don't, not leastaways who I drink with anymore, but I would treat myself to another bottle of this even if the price is a bit high. Worth it."

"Pours a pale gold with very little head which dissipates quickly.  No lacing.  I do like that it's a pale pumpkin beer since most I've had have been dark.  Great sweet butterscotch smell with just a touch of pumpkin spices.  Taste is much the same as the smell.  Butterscotch malt but not too sweet.  Some spices but not too much or overpowering.  Very balanced and delicious.  Medium to heavy bodied and well carbonated.  Very unlike any pumpkin beer I've had.  A really fantastic and unique beer."

"The back end mellows out that sweetness with a crisp, slightly bitter finish.  I think that the alcohol feel in your mouth isn't extremely impressive, but for an 8.6% beer, it goes down rather easily.  Also, it is nice that it doesn't have that overbearing spice presence that a lot of pumpkin ales have.  There is a subtle hint of your typical nutmeg/cinnamon/allspice/clove, but it isn't nearly as overpowering as it is in a lot of the others.  Hands down the best I've had yet."

"O: Overall, this isn't a beer that I would buy again, but I am glad I had it. Before I had other pumpkin beers this is what I would imagine a pumpkin beer should have tasted like. Now, after having many in its style, I would have to say this comes off as gimmicky. The flavor seems artificial. (3.5/5)"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer is really good, but it isn't really pumpkiny to me. It's definitely spicy, but not a pumpkin kind of spicy.  To me, it's more like a clove kind of spicy.  Also, I was surprised to read that others think this isn't a bitter beer. It isn't as bitter as beer comes, but to me, it's kind of bitter. Also, the projected ABV might be a little low and understated. I've only had half of one, and I'm pretty hammered."

"This Pumpkin Ale is by far my favorite one on the market.  I'm so in love with it.  I can drink two bottles in a row (over the course of two hours).  I LOVE that whipped cream/pie crust flavor it carries.  The traditional pumpkin pie spices are there but not too overpowering like MOST pumpkin ales (breweries that just jump on the bandwagon and care little about crafting good beer).  The candied pumpkin flavor accompanied by the bitter hops merges together beautifully.  I hope Southern Tier never changes their recipe.  It's flawless.  I purchased a whole case of this beer last week.  Talk about pricy, but hey, that's how much I love it, and my book royalties covered it.  :D"

"On the pumpkin beer spectrum that ranges from pumpkin pie to gourd in flavor, Pumking is certainly more toward the pie side. However, unlike many pumpkin pie beers the crust taste really stands out. There are also notes of caramel, vanilla, brown sugar, sugar cookie, roasted pumpkin, and a little bit of alcohol."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very tasty, but I had trouble getting over the sweetness of the pumpkin crust, which could have been toned down.  Otherwise, very delicious and drinkable."

"Looks are weak and the taste, ultimately, disappoints. I can forgive the appearance but the aftertaste of burnt rubber or vinyl can't be ignored and pretty much ruins an otherwise decent beer. Certainly not what I expected. A big let down although I'd try it again on the odds that I got a bad sample."

"Southern tier has yet another enjoyable beer that has been produced. The pumking is one of my favorite stouts! I would describe it as very smooth body,rich in flavor, and easy to dink. This stout will always be one of my favorites."

"It smells sweet like a dessert almost, but upon tasting you're greeted with an enjoying pumpkin taste coupled with spices. This beer deserves to be enjoyed. The smells you get off of it are just so pleasant and upbringing, it makes you feel peaceful. I loved it."

"A beer style and memorable flavor you will not forget - tastes like roasted graham cracker (like smores) / pumpkin pie but not overwhelming...only negative to keep it at 4.75 vs. 5.0 is abv level (I think 8.6 is generously low), but that's the price you pay for the taste which is something everyone should experience. Truly outstanding :)"

"Another in depth review seems pointless on Pumking as the labeling on the bottle describes the contents quite accurately. After trying a handful of pumpkin ales last year and only finding one of them worthwhile (Williamsburg Alewerks is outstanding), I was very pleasantly surprised to discover for myself how good Pumking really is. Not overspiced and well balanced, mindblowing ABV for the taste, very smooth drinking. Highly recommend."

"O-This beer is the best approximation of pumpkin pie that I have ever had. Take that assessment however you will. I like pumpkin pie and I thought this beer offered pure flavors and big sweetness that made me think of Thanksgiving at grandma's house. If that isn't what you want in a beer, look elsewhere. I should also note that I think the beer is well constructed."

"Clear golden pour with a small white head. Aroma is pumpkin and spices. Taste has spice flavors upfront of nutmeg and ginger backed by a nice pumpkin pie flavor. Light to medium body also has somewhat of a pie crust flavor. Finishes dry."

"Poured a nice semi-clear copper color with no head. It looks like a pumpkin beer, nothing too special, but pleasant enough. Scents of rich, buttery pie crust, pumpkin, nutmeg, hints of vanilla and low levels of cinnamon. Overall impression of aroma is wonderfully rich aroma that captures the entire profile of a pumpkin pie quite nicely. Very good. Flavor begins with a wonderful flavor of pumpkin, with notes of cinnamon and nutmeg, and some malty sweetness, with a low, yet present bit of bitterness balancing the sweet pumpkin, malt and spices. This moves into a middle that adds a rich, buttery pie crust flavor, continues with flavors of pumpkin and spice and still balances it with a low yet present hop character that is mostly earthy and floral, a hint alcohol is also noticeable. Finish is moderately sweet, with notes of pumpkin, buttery pie crust, pumpkin pie filling, alcohol at a moderate-low level and a bit of hop flavors with low bitterness. Aftertaste is pumpkin, spices and some faint floral and earthy hop flavors. Overall impression is of a flavor profile that is remarkably like pumpkin pie, but kept by becoming cloying by a nice balance of hop flavors and alcohol. This allows the beer to be sweet and dessert-like, yet still very much identifiable as a beer. Quite well executed and very pleasant. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate-light carbonation and smooth. Very nice and quite easy to sip, hiding the ABV well, despite the alcohol in the flavor. Overall this is a nice pumpkin ale, of the variety seeking to be pumpkin pie-like. It has a rich, wonderful aroma and flavor, but is balanced enough to avoid becoming cloying. It also avoids the all too common trap of being too watery or one note in flavor that many such beers fall into. The end result is a finely crafted pumpkin ale that is extremely enjoyable to drink. If you like pumpkin ales this one is highly recommended."

"I was looking forward to this one. The beer has a lot of flavor, but it has way to much cinnamon. I also taste sweet corn, which is kind of weird. The way people talk it up, I'm slightly disappointed. The longer I drank this the worse it got. Almost to the point of not being able to drink it. It just seemed to taste more and more like sweet corn dipped in a lot of cinnamon. The DOB of the beer was 8/28/13, so it was fairly new. I’m not sure if we just got a bad batch or not, but the 2 of us drinking this would agree this is by far the worse pumpkin beer we've ever had."

"This year's batch tastes a little different from last year's. It might just be me, but the bitterness was noticeable this time around and I didn't get as much of a creamy flavor. But it is still the best pumpkin beer around. This is the closest you're going to get to pumpkin pie in a bottle. Stock up while ye can."

"Pretty stoked to see this in CO since I never have but always hear about it. Drinking this out of a goblet as the bottle instructs and it pours a hazed amber with thin collar and minimal carbonation, but let me add that I actually cracked the bomber last night and have just had it corked since then, so some carbonation may have escaped. Aroma is sweet like candy, with cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla, and butterscotch. Light color gives way to unexpected maltiness, booze is noticeable, and the spices are quite present in the flavor giving each sip a nice peak in the middle followed by light bitterness, mostly from the alcohol. Mouthfeel is slick and medium bodied, light carbonation. The only thing that throws me is the vanilla/butterscotch component, which I guess is what gives it the """pie crust""" component advertised on the label. In my experience, there are two basic types of pumpkin ales: spiced pumpkin, and pumpkin pie, and I am more a fan of the former. Still, this is a good representation of the pumpkin-pie style, and anyone who's in that camp should love this one. Glad to have finally tried it, but wouldn't get this one again."
""
""
""
"Best served at room temperature in my opinion, one of my favorite things when fall comes around. Pours a dark brown with a tan head. The smell was full of pumpkins and not that much spice. The taste was very good with a lot of great pumpkin flavor in the beginning and end but with some sweetness in the middle to round it out. Loved it and would highly recommend."

"Overall -In the last couple of years I have tried many of the pumpkin ales growing in availability, and until now I was sold on Dogfish Head's version. However, this year's Southern Tier Pumking will be hard to beat! That perfect """pumpkin pie""" flavor, with just the right portion of each spice, is not something I've encountered so brilliantly in a beer before. I certainly could not ask for a tastier pumpkin ale."

"Favorite pumpkin beer. Period."
""
""
"Every year I always look forward to this beer. Still today it is my favorite pumpkin beer! it seems they have changed the beer a little bit since last year but I feel its definitely improved! I get stronger notes of hops and malts and it feels less overpowered by sugar. It still has all of my favorite aspects, wonderful notes of pumpkin pie, pie crust, brown sugar, vanilla, and spice to tie it all together. However, it seems this time around they really focused on toning down all the sugary flavors and let the hops do the taking. To sum it up, its the best yet. I love the balance it has and how perfectly layered it is. I plan on buying plenty of these this year!"

"O - Tasty, but didn't live up to the hype for me. Nothing really off putting, just really didn't come together as well as I would have hoped. (a little too much ginger, a little too light of body). I'm sure I will be in the minority here, but I like Sam Adams Fat Jack better."

"Pours a nice orange amber light reddish color with a decent head that dissipates quickly. First whiff is that of raw pumpkin with a slightly sweet smell and very similar to a Korean sweet rice drink. There is a hint of cloves and cinnamon and nutmeg in the aroma at the end. Taste is that of raw pumpkin with a bitterness at the end. There is no sweetness to this beer at all. Not much in the way of cloves, nutmeg or cinnamon. Just pure raw pumpkin. I did not detect any similarity to a pumpkin pie or cake. If you like the raw pumpkin smell then this beer is for you."

"Poured from a 750ml bottle into a snifter, pours a great orange color with minimal head that dissipates quickly. Smells of all wonderful pumpkin pie fragrances. Pumpkin, nutmeg, allspice, etc. Has a nice bready flavor as well with a hint of vanilla. A little light in the mouth, feel wise, but one of the best pumpkin style beers I've ever had. I'm definitely going to have to pick up a few more bottles to enjoy over the course of the fall."

"Overall, this is still the best pumpkin beer for me. I thoroughly enjoy Schlafly which is terrific, The Great Pumpkin by Elysian as well as their Night Owl, but I've yet to find anything that does it for me like Pumking - maybe I will get my hands on some Good Gourd this year to see if it is as good as some say. Pumpkin beers are not for everyone and I find reviews of Pumking, especially polarizing. It's love or hate and for me...I love this one. I drink it all year round! Cheers!!!"

"This beer is fantastic.  If you don't like pumpkin then stay away this beer is not for you. Everything about this beer is great.  It's my most anticipated seasonal  every year and once again ST didn't disapoint.  It pours to a dark rich looking  golden brown.  The smell radiates for the bottle the instant you open it.  The smell once poured into a goblet is even better. A thick aromatic spice smell hits you instantly.  Followed by subtle vanilla.  Pumpkin is in the air.  It tastes like it smells.  Like a little bit of heaven with the big guy himself holding the serving spade. If I had to chose one way to describe the taste it would be liquid pumpkin pie.  Mouth feel is instantly sweet with very low bitterness even with the two types of hops.  The two different malts balance nicely.  The finish is the best part and is also where this pumpkin ale takes the crown to all the rest.  Pie filling, pie crust, seasonal pumpkin spice. All that's missing is the whip cream (not really, that would be nasty).  If anyone reading this hasn't figured out my overall score you should prob read this again. 5...5....5!!!! A superb fall/seasonal beer."

Rarely do I order a second of the same brew @ Rattle n Hum because they have such a wide selection, but this one just wouldn't let me go. So. Tier needs to run this from Sept to March & then some. If there is beer in heaven, have 1 of the taps running this stuff."

"Bottled 8/24/11 Aged nearly 3 years. Opened with a zesty fizzy punch of carbonation. Poured a translucent amber with an orange pumpkin-like hue. Small white bubbly head dissipated quickly. Nose is bready must (akin to a freshly carved pumpkin), some pie spice, some sweetness. Just an awesome, unique, evocative nose. Taste is bready must up front. On the sides, there's an unfortunate creamed corn flavor. The finish is musty & sweet and sticks around for a while. It's not very complex but the musty pumpkin flavor is unique enough to keep things interesting. Mouthfeel is medium. Decent carbonation. In summary, the nose is huge, the taste largely follows through. Aside from the creamed corn flavor, it's a unique, tasty beer. I don't think 3 years of age hurt or helped."

"O: Unbelievably good. I need to find this again this fall and try it fresh. It's really good and a must try if pumpkin beers are your thing."
""

"Anyways like I was saying, Pumking is the drink of drinkers. If you like pumpkin pie, pumpkin stew, pumpkin salad, pumpkin bourbon, pumpkin eggnog, pumpkin yogurt, pumpkin pepper, pumpkin gumbo, pumpkin deep fried, pineapple pumpkin, pumpkin kabob, pumpkin and potatoes, Cajun pumpkin, pumpkin salad, pumpkin ice-cream, pumpkin gelatin, pumpkin oil, pumpkin butter, pumpkin fries, pumpkin on the barbie, pumpkin and pumpkin, this drink is for you. Always a favorite around Halloween, it's the perfect chilling drink."

"Poured hazy golden orange, with a half inch head that quickly settled to nothing, leaving no lacing in the glass.  Aroma is just like a fresh loaf of pumpkin bread fresh from the oven. I also get a slight hint of vanilla. The flavor is big pumpkin up front, with some nutmeg and cinnamon, with a lot of bitterness in the back end. The 8.6% ABV is very well hidden. Mouthfeel was kinda thin, almost a little disappointing, carbonation was nice. Overall, this is my favorite pumpkin beer so far. Definitely will be buying more of these before they're gone for the year. Really glad that Southern Tier has finally made it to Colorado."

"In general, I am not so fond of Pumpkin Ales, but I found this one is quite interesting, aroma is to die for, and with very present spices that are not exaggerated. I would sure have it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"One note I'd like to make is to expect a sweet beer. The finish has dry aspects, but this is definitely a dessert. It is also complete in itself. Don't pair it with anything. I've had other pumpkin beers and none was ever this sweet or flavorful. Just drink it in place of pie. There's really no other use for it."

"Bucky purchased Pumking from his local LCBO in a brown, 650 ml bottle with a bottling date of July 11, 2012. Pumking has been brewed since 2007, and is 8.6% alcohol by volume. Pumking poured a hazy dark orange colour, with the orange becoming much brighter when backlit. A fairly aggressive pour produced about 1""" of fizzy white head, which burned itself out within 3 minutes, leaving no spotting or lacing. The beer's aroma was wonderful; pumpkin pie spices and graham cracker pie crust...I swear! Its taste was sweet and dominated by the graham cracker pie crust, with distinct pumpkin pie spice flavours and maybe just a hint of vanilla. No bitterness here at all. Pumking was characterized by a medium level of carbonation, just right for its type, and a smooth mouth feel. It is light to medium bodied, but actually feels a bit heavier than it is due to the rich flavours. At $8.95 per 650 ml bottle the price tag is fairly steep, but a few bottles as a seasonal indulgence won't break the bank. Overall, I can't wait until next fall for the new seasonal batch!"

"Overall: Thus far, best pumpkin ale I've had. I'd love to try one fresh, and in season, as I believe in season may have a placebo effect. My brain will tell me it's better in October or November, just because."

"The aroma has big, bready malts up front, with a good amount of pumpkin to back it up. It smells almost like zucchini bread, with a bit of a sweet corn aroma as well. The flavor has more of the pumpkin up front, with the malts taking a back seat. Tons of cinnamon and clove come through as well, and the higher alcohol content makes itself apparent. The mouthfeel is a bit chewy, so this beer is kind of like a pumpkin pie in a glass. One of the best pumpkin beers."

"As Pumpkin Beers go, this is the gold standard. My wife says it's like a pumpkin pie without the crust. She's right the beer does have more of a dessert feel with its creamy finish. Limited release every year is worth the wait every October. Sometimes difficult to find in in the PA / NY region it's produced. Stock up if you can!!!"

"have had this one a couple times, great notes of pumpkin and a yammy finish. it's a deserty beer, one that you'd drink just 1 or 2 of I feel but REALLY enjoy them. after having it on draft, and in a bottle, it's good either way. 1 of my favorite beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The hype is deserved as this is the most """pumpkinny""" of the fall beers I've tried. It's not the best, tho. I'll take Indeed's yamma jamma over this any day."
"Unlike some pumpkin beers, Pumking isn't just in your face candy-like pumpkin spice flavors, nor is it too malty. You get nice notes of the pumpkin spices but you do taste something slightly vegetabley and earthy as well - almost a true pumpkin / squash flavor. It's one of the few pumpkin beers I drink on multiple occasions over the Fall."
""
""
"Over all in my opinion a fantastic beer. I am a very big fan of pumpkin beers and in my opinion this one beats all others. It was a nice amber color with a white head. I have never tried this beer on tap only in the bottle but I would recommend it to any pumpkin beer lover."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I don't understand why people look forward to the novelty of drinking the simulacrum of a seasonal dish rather than eating the real thing. I suspect having 9 months to forget how regrettable it actually is has something to do with it, but also the willingness of folks to buy into the idea of a beer representing picturesque pumpkin pickings and redolent autumnal vistas that it can't possibly deliver on shouldn't be discounted either."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, not to my taste. Tastes nutty and spicy, but not very good. Ended up with indigestion later. Different than most pumpkin beers because the pumpkin spices seemed to be absent."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - 4.25 - Great beer, perfect representation of a pumpkin beer. I think most October beers could learn from this one. This is a very good example of a high gravity pumpkin beer. As opposed to 2003 Bell's Eccentric Ale - a very BAD example of a high gravity pumpkin beer."

""
""
""

""
""
""

"So smooth and flavorful. Not at all too sweet. A whole bottle does whack you pretty good. But it's delicious, with the right feel and burst of spices. I think it's as good in the bottle as it is fresh on tap. But I can't wait to see how it does after aging a couple more months. So solid and consistent. Goes great with food or as desert."

"Overall, a solid beer. I've seen people suggest that Warlock is just Pumking with more bitter, roasted components, and I'm inclined to agree. If I want a pure pumpkin beer (rather than a pumpkin stout or something), there are others that I'm likely to reach for first. However, this one is pretty solid and worth a try for anyone who hasn't sampled it before."
""

"O-this beer is what every other brewer is trying to become. Can't believe ABV it's hidden well"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- what I like the most about this is it stays true to the style of the beer. When it says pumpkin, that is what I want to taste. It's not masked up with pie spices and fake flavors. This one is as pumpkin as it gets."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is quite a different October brew. It is heavy in pumpkin spice and can be initially delicious, but it goes down like a soft drink (soda/pop/cola/whatever the yankees call it). I'm on the fence with that feeling. The alcohol is almost not detectable in the aroma or taste to myself."
"Beer's body is medium-heavy to medium, with carbonation in a range of medium to medium-high, resulting in a mouthfeel that borders fizzy, but never quite reaches it, resulting in a smooth, foamy mouthfeel overall. The carbonation complements the body's thickness quite nicely, the beer is quite pleasant on the palate. Finish is dry and leaves a lingering dryness and substantial sweetness on the palate, compelling another sip."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O/D - Great drinkabiliity. Lovely pumpkin element that really worked. I don't typically enjoy pumpkin beers, but I love pumpkin pie, and this did it for me. A really neat beer."
""
" The beer tastes like a liquid pumpkin pie."
""
""
"Pours from the 22oz. bottle a light copper color with a 1 1/2 finger slightly off-white head. Lively carbonation is observed, there are quite a few bubbles rising in the glass. The room is almost overwhelmed with the aroma of spice (cinnamon, nutmeg, etc.) and a sweet caramel-like aroma. A slight aroma of pumpkin is picked up. 1st sip brings a dry dose of the aforementioned spices...a little TOO dry for my tastes. This could use some more malt or maybe a hint of brown sugar sweetness to even out the dry bitterness! Mouthfeel is medium, not watery or heavy. Overall, a bit of a disappointment. WAY too dry & bitter, almost unpleasantly so! Perhaps I got a bad bottle, unfortunately (or maybe not) it was among the last ones of the season, at least at Total Wine and More @ Claymont, DE. I'll have to look around and see if there's more somewhere out there, otherwise i'll have to wait a year to give this another chance. From all the reviews i've read, I was expecting something much better."

"DATE TASTED: November 2, 2013... GLASSWARE: Chimay goblet... OCCASION: post-Halloween weekend relaxation... APPEARANCE: beautifully clear, orange body that frames a bubbling cauldron of steady effervescence; a thin ring of white head produces a dearth of lacing--appropriately dramatic and dark... AROMA: sugary pumpkin, almond nut/butter scents weave with vanilla/cinnamon/nutmeg--complex and rewarding...PALATE: at 8.6% ABV, impressively smooth and medium-bodied; goblet-worthy smoothness with a delayed warming texture ...TASTE: brilliantly caramelized malts that provide a formidable base for the pumpkin puree; bewitching, even/especially for those of us not entirely agog over pumpkin flavored anythings...OVERALL: a victory in the genre...hate to make generalizations, but Southern Tier is bold, flavorful and easily drinkable in seemingly all of their beer profile--a possible Top Five US Brewery, if I were to draft a list..."
""
""
"Overall: Probably the best showcasing of the actual pumpkin flavor I've tasted. The pie crust flavor really takes this to the next level. The sweet flavors are well balanced by bitterness. I really like this one!"
"There are many many bad pumpkin beers but this is one of the better. Stands toe to toe with any of Elysian or Dogfish efforts in the pumpkin quasi-style."

"This beer may have been overhyped before I tried it. Friends loved it. Bars were draining kegs of it in Richmond left and right.  Pours to a light golden orange.  No head.  750ml bottle.  Draft is significantly better.  Brewed with pumpkins, 2 varietals of hops and malts.  Clean.  Crisp.  Pumpkin taste but not overly sweet like a pumpkin pie.  Little spice after taste.  Very drinkable.  Can down a few.  However, I think it holds to 3rd on my list behind Williamsburg Akewerks Pumpkin and Schlafay."
""
""
""
"Overall 2.5: Not my favorite beer. I rarely (if ever) stop drinking a beer and get rid of it, but I did this time. In my opinion, there is just too much going on here in this brew and most of it is not to my liking. This Halloween pumpkin beer was certainly all TRICK and no TREAT for me. I'll never look at Pepe Lopez the same way."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I really was excited to try this beer, after reading so much about it, but it came up short. I got an overwhelming amount of graham cracker in the aroma, and the alcohol was just too up front. It was an easy drinker though, and the colour was true to style. The hops take a back seat to the malt, but I would have liked less graham cracker aroma and taste, less vanilla, more spices. The pumpkin was there in the background as well. I think this is one of those beers with so much going on that personal tastes really come into play. A few tweaks here and there and I would have loved it, but then it would have been a different beer. Worth a try."
""

"Poured into an English pint glass, this beer is a very light orange color, with a small head that fades pretty quickly away to just a film. The aroma offered is very nice: sweet malt, with a subtle spicy mix where no one component really dominates--I can pick out nutmeg, but barely--the blend is really nice. The flavor continues the perfect blend of spices, though it borders on being too sweet for me. There nice vanilla notes I didn't pick up in the nose. There's some bitterness at the end but overall it's on the sweet side. The body is delightfully light for the strength. Personally, I'd appreciate a smaller-sized bottle, but this is a very good pumpkin beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This beer made me believe that pumpkin ales are worth my consideration. My first two pumpkin ales were Shipyard <vomit> and Blue Moon <blech>. Then I had Terrapin Pumpkinfest and it was better than the aforementioned abominations, but it didn't convert me either. This offering may have made me a convert."
""
""
""
"O: definitely in my top 3 pumpkin beers! Arguably my favorite. It has so much complexity and depth of character it is truly one of a kind. A highly recommended seasonal favorite."
""
""
""
""
""
"I think pumpkin beers just may not be for me."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pale golden colored with minimal head that vanishes quickly. Great clarity with low carbonation. I get pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg and perhaps a bit of clove. The flavor is aggressively spiced in a similar fashion to the Warlock that I had just tried , but the baseline beer is much lighter in body. This is an aggressively spiced pumpkin brew that offers a lot of flavor. Pumpkin, with lots of cinnamon and nutmeg is what you get with the taste."
""
""
""
""
"I really wish I had another bottle of this for Thanksgiving or something. This far less sweet than I expected, and the notes of spices and slight vegetal character, as well as the creamy mouthfeel, made this a unique drinking experience as far as offerings in the style go. I'd gladly have another - maybe on-tap - but it's definitely recommended to split. I split EVERY bomber I buy anyways, but this is definitely something that wouldn't be the worst idea to offer in 4 or 6 packs for the sake of practical drinking."

"O - A very drinkable pumpkin beer. This makes a real nice desert beer."

"Nice potently spicy pumpkin ale. One of the spicier around. Not actually my favorite, feel like the spices over ride the actual beer qualities."
"Overall - best pumpkin beer our there,what better day to enjoy then on Halloween !"

""
""
"Delicious! Among my favorites of the style."
""
""
""

However, other buyers seem to have caught on since when I went back to a location that supposedly still had inventory, they were all gone. Will keep looking for this marvelous beer in hopes that I could try it once again."

"Cigar City (have not tried) is really the only contender IMO to Schlafly Pumpkin Ale and this is one of my favorite styles of beer"

"Pours a clear orange with a thin tan head. Massive aromas of eggnog and nutmeg. Taste begins with some some huge cinnamon, then some pumpkin, followed by some cream. The finish is a spicy bitterness. Mouthfeel is good. Overall a very flavorful pumpkin ale."

"The aroma stuke me as the most interesting part of this beer. Almonds, cookies, and Indian cuisine we flavours in this strong Pumpkin beer. in the taste these elemants were there to, but way less than in the aroma. Orange collored and a thin layer of foam. If it was possible I would have snifted this one instead of drinking it."

""
"O: I was skeptical buying this beer for $8 living up to the hype...this blew my understanding of what you could do with pumpkin in beers and is the # 1 must buy for the season so far. If you can find it, buy it in bulk to share with those friends that appreciate a good beer."
"The taste tones it down a little bit, with the caramel malts and hops certainly more noticeable than on the nose. Don't get it twisted, this is not a hoppy beer by any means, just that I didn't really notice it on the nose, but it is here somewhat in the flavour. The sweet pumpkin pie still drives this beer, as well it should. Creamy and round, it's surprisingly drinkable, and the 8.6% is well covered. Not entirely surprisingly, I liked Warlock better (I adore big creamy stouts), but this is a top tier (no pun intended) autumnal liquid. Reading the admonishments that it 'wasn't as good as last year (nothing ever is, is it...)' had me slightly worried, but, having never tasted 'last years,' this stands on its own as an extremely enjoyable beverage experience."
"O- A great, interesting pumpkin beer. It's great in small doses. The alcohol really hit me. I prefer Schlafly's, but I'd definitely hit this up again and will look forward to this on a yearly basis."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The aroma of cinnamon and vanilla was obvious and inviting and the taste matched the expectations that were set by the smell. The vanilla added a smooth and creamy feeling that was not overtaken by the high alcohol content. On a fall night this beer is a fine way to start and end an evening."
""
""
"O: doesn't live up to the hype to me. I like my pumpkin beers meatier and not quite as sweet. This is very good though and makes for a wonderful dessert beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O-Not only tastiest pumpkin beer around, it's one of the better tasting brews period. Smell is a work of art. If Pumking looked and felt better this beer would be a whale. Look and feel are great mind you, but get pushed aside by the amazing smell and taste."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours (as un-pun-intended as this can get) a warm, pumpkin orange with about a pinky of white head. Aroma is graham crackers, vanilla, cinnamon, and of course pumpkin. The taste is creamy vanilla and cinnamon, rounded out with a bit of biscuity malt and slightly bitter hops, with a surprisingly light, non-sticky mouth feel. I've read plenty of evaluations decrying this beer as having gone way down in quality (I've even seen the term """undrinkable""" used), but to me it's still a damn sight better than just about every other beer of its type out there."
""
""

""

"O - Not a poor beer, but I'm disappointed. I've read from other reviews that the recipe for this year's version may have been changed. I'm assuming that's correct, as this is a highly reviewed beer, but more recent reviews haven't been as kind. The pumpkin taste is artificial, and the mouthfeel is sticky, yet thin. I would drink this beer again if it were offered for free, but I'll never purchase again."

"Overall - one of the better pumpkin beers I've reviewed this year. I wouldn't mind just a little more malt backing and maybe just a little less IBU's, but this is labeled as an Imperial and I think they hit the mark pretty much right on. Great beer guys, I would definitely go back for seconds."
""
"I heard a lot that this beer was liquid pumkin pie. To me it has a nice beer base which dosent get overthrown by the pumpkin and spice flavor.lighter on the color, nice head, good carbonation.. good and hoppy, fresh tasting and well balanced. Its by far not a bad choice and shouldn't dissapoint."

"Pours orange, with a big white head that disappears. Sweet vanilla cookies on the nose, some rose blossom, hibiscus. Very little noticeable carbonation. There's quite a bit going on taste-wise, though the pumpkin flavor is muted. Instead, there's a good deal of sweetness up front, plus coriander, cardamon, basil, more vanilla, some white pepper, and an aftertaste that reminds me of being sick and spoon-fed benadryl or old cough syrup. There's a medicinal bitterness and tang (eucalyptus, anise), which lingers too long for my taste. It's nicely balanced beer in terms of its body, with subtle carbonation. I'm not too sure what makes this a pumpkin ale, other than it's orange color, and that the label says """Ale Brewed with Pumpkins.""" A spiced fall ale, perhaps. Heck, it even has some qualities of a winter ale. A mixed bag."
"Overall: fantastic and boldly flavored. No lack of flavor at all! Strong pumpkin pie with a lot of sweetness reminiscent of whipped cream topping. Great nutmeg and cinnamon spice flavor. Slight hop bitterness on the finish brings it all together to avoid it becoming cloying. However, I still highly suggest this beer!"

"Bought a bottle at Table and Vine in West Springfield, MA. Attractive gold-amber appearance with lots of carbonation and a thin, creamy head. Aromas are incredibly strong to the point of a bit overwhelming. A definitive sweet smell of pumpkin, strong cinnamon, maybe a little vanilla. If the aromas were just taken down a notch a bit, it may have been less overwhelming. Otherwise, these are mouth-watering aromas. The taste was dessert level sweetness. I liked it, though I can see how some might be taken very aback by how sweet this is. Definitely could taste a strong, baked pumpkin pastry flavor to the beer, as well as that vanilla I sensed a bit from the smell. The mouthfeel is what perfectly supplements this beer as a very sweet, dessert-like beer to have after supper. This was a very creamy drink with a medium carbonation. That adds to that flavor quite well, so if you want a dessert-like, seasonal beer, I would highly recommend this beer."

"Usually I find Southern Tier beers quite good, and I hope that this was a bottle issue rather than this beer. I may give it another shot and re-review."
""
""

"I am not too familiar with this style, but I did enjoy this one. Has a nice mix of flavors that work well together, and the alcohol is very well hidden, making this one drinkable and dangerous. This is my first beer from this brewer, and I am anxious to try more from them."
"I have to admit that this is a pretty good beer and much better than the first time that I had it."

"As far as big pumpkin ales go this is a solid candidate, it has enough of a different slant in the flavor to perk the senses and then back it with a pretty well built beer. The initial taste is a bit too sweet I found but it has a lot of different levels to it which is cool. Lots of richness and a sweet roasty character. Pumpkin flavor is very apparent with lots of cinnamon and nutmeg but also has a quite a bit of complexity to it. Worth trying. 4"

"Overall- Given the trendy appeal of pumpkin beers and the frequency of which they're produced poorly, this is probably my favorite pumpkin ale just on the authentic pie like smell alone. Although the strong wash of alcohol kind of takes away from the satisfying sweet pumpkin experience. Overall a well crafted and unique fall beer. I'll continue to look forward to it every fall."

"Overall: When it comes to pumpkin beers, this is the King for a reason. Insane level of pumpkin/spice flavor. If it wasn't for that lingering alcohol heat this would be out of this world."
""
"Pours a darker yellow/burnt orange in color that is slightly hazy. Very thin white head that leaves very little lacing. The aroma of fresh cut pumpkins hits you right up front with some grains/hop. Very nice actually. The taste was fantastic! Perfect balance of flavor. No harsh aftertaste either as one might think with the high alcohol content. Overall, one of the best pumpkin ales out there I tried. Love this time of year with all the autumn brews."
"The one draw is that the feel is sharp, thin and tinged with alcohol. Nicely crisp but a touch abrasive this could use a bit of thickness."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Solid nose of fresh pumpkin pie - all that's missing is the freshly whipped cream.  Taste is nicely toasted malts that suggest a thick, completely baked pie crust in the finish, a touch of light caramel, and the spices from the nose, most notably nutmeg, followed by some ginger and just a touch of cinnamon.  Perfect to serve with Thanksgiving dessert."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured gently into a brandy snifter, very light and average sized head. The hype for this beer seems to be mostly placed on the smell and indeed it somehow captures the most pleasant and creamy aspects of pumpkin pie spices. First sip was nearly all vanilla with a touch of spice, but the proceeding sips are increasingly complex with english ale, more spices, and even a touch of raw pumpkin meat drawing me in. As with the smell, I immediately and consistently got an exceptionally smooth and creamy texture. It's almost too drinkable considering the the complex flavors and high ABV. Pumking is a different kind of sipper due to the candy like flavor and mouthfeel. This beer is a special occasion in and of itself, glad I got to finally try this."
""
"I often tell people Pumking is my favorite beer of any style, hands down, even though I'm a hop head. This is one that I store so we can have a triple vertical every Thanksgiving, along with my pumpkin pie. It ages in an odd and inconsistent way: the booziness advances and retreats with time, as does the pumpkin flavor. It's arguable whether it's better after the pumpkin spice pulls back a little but what isn't is that it's absolutely amazing when fresh. It's all about the spice and the vanilla notes, just like my pumpkin pie, with the pumpkin crouching in the background. But don't bother drinking it with a cold: the wonderful aroma is 90% responsible for the great taste."

"This beer is something to write home about. Im not a beer expert. I just have a good palate. I know that everyone who tastes it loves it. I like the finish when the oxygen hits your mouth after you swallow. The beer is only sold in large bottles, i think that is to make sure you pour in a bottle, however, it could also be to make sure you have a good time."

"Great tasting beer with a ABV of 8.6 % you can't go wrong. My favorite Pumpkin Ale so far. No need for that caramel sugar rim to enhance flavor not overly sweet just enough spice. This is the seasonal beer you want to be drinking. You can find it on tap at the Village Traven in Salem, MA"
""
"Light carbonation lends itself to a flavor that's not naturally assertive."
""
""
""
""
"I buy a case of this when it comes out and split it with another friend of mine who is obsessed with it. It's definitely drinkable and definitely has some good flavor, but I do feel it's a bit overhyped."
"Pouring it out of the 22 is nice and adds to the enjoyment. Drink it from a goblet as directed. The taste is excellent for pumpkins, especially ones high on the abv. One of the best. The viscosity is a little thin and there is subtle changes only after a little bit of warming but overall this is outstanding autumn brew."
""
"From a 22oz bomber... poured a deep amber color with rich tan head. Immediately picked up more of a sweet, biscuit than traditional pumpkin pie spice on the nose. The mouth feel is full, and again I get a dominating vanilla cookie flavor and subtle pumpkin pie spice with a nice alcohol warmth. I have friends who are nuts about this brew, but it was too sweet and almost cloying for me."

"O - Smell leads you to believe that you are getting a sweet spice bomb, but the taste is really nice. Let down by the watery mouthfeel."

"I won't be asking for this again. I prefer Dogfish Head's Punkin Ale because it's more vegetal and less dessert-scented. This beer would be great for someone who doesn't mind a sweeter beer with some artificial notes."

""
""
""
""
"Sadly I was not impressed, despite all of the good recommendations. Strong caramel maltiness on the nose, a bit of pumpkin, and the usual accouterments of spices: nutmeg, ginger cinnamon, etc; overly sweet. I got more spices on my tongue when I took some sips, the caramel malt and the pumpkin don't go well together, and I think the hops add a strange off note. The pumpkin finishes quickly, leaving the spices and that sickly sweet taste I got so strongly on the nose, and the odd hop off taste."
""
"An outstanding job"
""
"Served in a tulip glass chilled, appearance was mildly cloudy, bright orange, amber color with a wonderful pumpkin, nutmeg and cinnamon aroma. Smooth, clean, refreshing. I had the White Gourmet pizza and the combination worked well. The taste was true pumpkin with a nice nutmeg and cinnamon undertone. Perhaps the day in the sun visiting every animal display (yes, every one) set me up to enjoy any cold beverage, but I do not think so. This was a delightful beer that I would recommend. (A subsequent purchase of the same in a bottle produced a less enthusiastic but still positive experience.)"

"Had this beer on tap at sweet cheeks, outside Fenway park last night. It was the first beer I ever sent back. To me, it tasted just like I would imagine a Fenway park urinal would taste. Try it for yourself - I handed the beer around the table and 3 of my friends agreed with me. It has an articial sweet mintiness that overwhelmed any subtle pumpkin notes. though one of my friends actually thought it was decent, tasting pie - which I see some other reviewers also noted."

"O: The best pumpkin beer I have ever had hands down. Southern Tier strikes again. The balance between the pumpkin and the graham cracker make this beer a great seasonal choice."
""
"Pours out a bright coppery orange with a thin head. Smells like pumpkin pie and graham crackers. That's it. It smells amazing. The spices don't hit me over the head as much as I would have expected, which is a good thing. I pick up some pumpkin along with the baking spice, so it isn't too hidden. Fairly sweet overall, which seems appropriate. Finishes with a surprising and welcome bitterness. I get some of that graham cracker in there too. Mouthfeel is fairly full, and the carbonation isn't too lively. Delicious beer. Dessert in a glass."
""
""
"I've tried several pumpkin varieties and this particular variety is suitably labeled. This is simply the best pumpkin ale I've had. Very flavorful without being over the board regarding the pumpkin flavors. The pumpkin pie spice flavors come through beautifully. Sip this one and savor it."

"D/O - A very seasonal representation of SHV beer, that pumpkin enthusiasts would enjoy. It may not necessarily offer anything different than other commercial examples, but it seems to employ a variety of what the rest do."
""
"O - a very good pumpkin ale. One of the 3-4 I look for. Not something I can drink everyday but what pumpkin ale is? Not sure if its quite as good as a few I've had, but its sure as heck better than nearly most I've had. Pumking is definitely something I buy every year and remains a part of my Halloween party lineup. A real classic Fall seasonal."

"Overall I wasn't a fan of this beer and I thought it wasn't a great example of the style, i feel like this was more of a dessert beer version of the style but the problem was the sweetness and spices covered up most of those natural pumpkin flavors and that seemed to really hurt this beer. This beer didn't have the best drinkability, it was somewhat smooth and not filling, but the flavor didn't do a good job at holding my attention and half a bomber is more than enough for me, there's no way I would want to drink a whole bomber to myself, it would be way too much and I don't think I could do it. What I liked the most about this beer was the mouthfeel and appearance, they both worked well with this beer and the appearance was pretty good. What I liked the least about this beer was how over the top all the flavors were except the pumpkin, it didn't highlight the pumpkin, it just covered it up. I wouldn't buy this beer again, it just not something I enjoyed and I would only recommend it to people that prefer their Pumpkin Ales heavy on the dessert side. All in all this beer just wasn't for me, I could see how some people would like it but to me it just wasn't something that I would want to revisit. I wish it was much more balanced since the pumpkin flavors only showed up a little in the background. I think Southern Tier is a fairly solid brewery, but I haven't liked any beers from the Black Water series, I don't think this it's as bad as Creme Brulee but it isn't much better either. I appreciate the attempt but this one was a miss for me, better luck next time guys."

""
"This is a slam dunk. I'm not one to go with the flow (I love imperial stouts, but I'm not a fan of BCBS), but in this case, Pumking is a brew that lives up to the hype. I highly recommend this gem, but you better act fast and get it while it lasts or it will be gone before the leaves even begin to start changing colors!"

"OK, I now know I probably just don't like this style. I love Southern Tier so I figured this was a good bet for my first pumpkin beer. But I thought it was just awful and poured it out after 1/4 glass. I like spiced beers but the spices here not only overwhelm the standard beer ingredients; they are just distasteful. Other types of beers are an acquired taste, but I think you have to be born with a taste for something like this."

"O: I thought this beer was awesome. The alcohol flavor is a little off putting but the smell and the other flavors are quite a treat. This is definitely one of the more bolder pumpkin beers around and if you're looking for something this fall with a kick, at 8.5% abv, this is it."
""
"O: I have been looking for a good pumpkin flavored beer since I typically enjoy these flavors. This one was indeed better than some of the others that I have tried, but I'm not sure I want more than one..."
" Just like the aforementioned odd case, this beer proves itself to be a incredibly hard to rate and examine. It strays so far from what ( even ) craft beer drinkers might think is the norm (or the norm 'spectrum' ) regarding balance and complexity that you really have no choice but to give in completely to the sensatory impulses and forget about checking criteria boxes."
""
"O - I must say I'm not a big fan of these overly flavored beers, but I think Pumking does it really well. Until now Brooklyn Brewers Post Road Pumpkin Ale was the only pumpkin beer I've really liked since the flavoring is more subtle than most. Pumking takes the opposite route yet I still really enjoyed it. Many pumpkin beers can have a cloying sweetness but this beer does really well avoiding that. It delivers on the Fall time flavors yet because of it's thin body is still very drinkable. I'll definitely be picking this up again as we creep into Fall."

"Yes, the emperor has beautiful clothes. Wow, I expected Pumpkin Pie in a bottle, and I really like pumpkin pie. This was not at all close to anything pumpkin. I got the the very tangy graham cracker taste up front and thought what followed would be pure enjoyment. It was pure bitterness. There was nothing discernible, but bitterness. When it warmed up, it was a tad more drinkable, but never was enjoyable. I've had many pumpkin brews, but this was the worst. Too disappointed to even go through the ASTMO analysis."

""
"Not a huge fan of pumpkin beers, but I am going to review it for what it is. Poured into a tulip glass, bottled 7/22/13. Pours a light orange, with a one inch head that leaves some spotty lace. Smell is like a well made pumpkin pie. Cinnamon and nutmeg to go along with the aggressive pumpkin smell. Taste matches the smell, with a hint of orange and a little caramel. Body is medium thin for its heft, would prefer a little more life, not dry, and goes down easy enough. I can see why this is a pumpkin legend, pumpkin pie in a bottle."

"This beer excites both the nose and the palate in so many ways. This has a strong character that is beer not desert. The sour bit of authentic pumpkin flavor make it for me. It gives it depth and a longevity on the palate. The balance is perfection. It's a pumpkin ale. You could serve it with gingerbread cookies or you could serve it with carrot and ginger soup. I like it so much more than I thought I would."
"Overall: This beer is an exception for me. I normally distrust celebrity beers because most of the time, they aren't all that good (Founders KBS and Victory Golden Monkey come to mind). But this beer makes me want to put on a child's elephant costume and throw a Drunkin Pumpkin Carving Party because let's face it: this beer is all that good. Sure, the taste isn't very complex but the aroma, spice, sugars and mouthfeel balance themselves so well that it doesn't need to be. Now go buy a case and come to my damn party."
""
""
""

"The beer looked orange in color like the flesh of a pumpkin, with a striking clarity. There wasn't much of a head, and the carbonation bubbles formed wispy streamers. The smell was quite a bit like pumpkin pie, with the vegetable smell mixing with cinnamon, and dough. The taste was much more intense than I was expecting, as there were flavors of pumpkin, cinnamon, vanilla, and nutmeg up front, followed by a surprising hop presence. The interplay between sweet, spicy, and bitter was very well done. The finish was dry, and showcased the spices. The body was a little thicker than medium, with a little sticky coating in the mouth. I usually don't go for pumpkin beers, but picked this up based on the recommendation of the store owner, and glad I did."
""
""
""
"Overall: This year's run is not bad, but I think 2011's run had more body and layered flavors. The bitterness at the end ruins the light flavors on first tasting for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A little strong on the spice, which is nice because too many seasonal beers are overly sweet without the character. Looks like a typical golden, lightly amber color. Mid to low carbonation from the 22 oz bottle. This was my second try of the season, which was consistent with the first. Definitely pick one or two up."
""
""
""
"I love pumpkin beers and this one took the cake. As soon as you hold it up to drink it the smell of fall goodness is right there! I have tried many different ones and this is hands down my fav. Southern Tier is one of my favorite brewery's. I just recently found them and have liked everything i have tried. I'm not sure how I missed them!"

"Overall - Solid and tasty. One of the better pumpkin beers out there. Maybe a little over hyped but still good enough to enjoy to get you ready for the fall seasons."
"4 growlers later and going to hit the Pittsburgh beer distributors for the 7 cases I have on order across two beer distributors. Hard to get yet only 2 and 1/2 hours away from where we live. So we make the pilgrimage up to the brewery at least 3 times over the Autumn season. We haven't even hit September yet and have hit the brewery 3 times...Yo Bitch. So the scoop is, ST will have bottles weekend of Labor Day, for now it's $5 glasses and Growlers. So we are getting primed for the upcoming season. The Warlock which comes out in September should be tasty, I'm already thinking Black & Orange with the King /Warlock. Actually had some King left at the bottom of a growler which sat for 2 weeks in the fridge... Talk about taste coming out... Yeah it lost carbonation Bitches but the flavor was 10 times more intense... This beer winters well. If you read this far on more piece of TRIVIA... ST made more Pumking this year than they did of all their beers in 2011, this from the wife of one of the owners."

"I'd heard quite a bit about this from my fellow sots but hadn't pulled the trigger until now. Part of it was that I thought it was a bit pricey for a pumpkin ale; which it would be except this is different from all the rest which are kind of boring tbh. I know it sounds trite to repeat what everybody else says about tasting like pumpkin pie, so I won't. What I will say is that it has an incredibly creamy taste to it which, either by itself or in conjunction with something(s) else, serves to mask the alc which at the end of 22 oz is definitely felt. It doesn't feel right to give something this sweet a higher grade for a beer although maybe I'm a prisoner of my history."

"This is the perfect pumpkin ale to me. It has by far the best smell of any other; it's just like pumpkin ice cream. The taste is consuming spice and loaded with pumpkin. Drink it slow and savor it. Few beers have this much flavor. It really is sensory overload in the best possible way. I will definitely get this again.

"Overall: This is a great beer. It has been aged for a little over a year and I am curious to try the fresh version to see if the pumpkin taste is stronger. I feel like the spices in this one were pretty heavy towards the finish."
"overall: One of my favorite pumpkin beers, with age it loses its sharp cinnamon profile in favor of more tame pumpkin pie notes, and in my opinion it's for the best. It truly becomes a can of pumpkin pie, sorry for the lack of a better description but that's the only way to accurately describe this beer. I'm excited for this years release."

"Please understand when I say I loved the 2012 version of this """classic""". It tasted so true to pumpkin pie my wife, who is not a beer drinker, and I couldn't get enough. The 2013 version, of which my wife had me buy a case, tastes to me like burnt brown sugar. I can't get past it. There is a half case in my cellar."
"This is by far my favorite beer that I have tasted. The Pumking is the perfect drink during the fall with great pumpkin, cinnamon, and vanilla flavors. Great to have with dinner or just having a casual drink. I can't wait until this is on tap again!"

"Overall: Pumking is definitely an interesting take on the pumpkin beer. It does achieve in evoking thoughts of pumpkin pie and the autumn season. Drinking one definitely feels like it's time to bring on the season. I enjoy having one of these in the season, but I don't find it something I would really seek out all the time or of which I'd buy excessive quantities. Still, it's definitely worth a try as the legend it is. Those that enjoy it really seem to love it, so there is value in finding out if it meshes well with your palate. During the season it seems to available just about anywhere, and at $6.99 a bottle (in this area, at least), it is reasonably priced, so it's worth at least one try."
"One of the best pumpkin beers of the fall season. There does not appear to be a lot of actual pumpkin involved, but the beer is spiced very nicely. On top of that, the 8.6 alcohol percentage is blended very well. This is one of the lightest pumpkin beers out there but it makes up for it in spice."

"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 9/26/2012. Pours fairly crystal clear golden amber color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of huge pumpkin pie, gingerbread, cinnamon, nutmeg, brown sugar, clove, caramel, pie crust, and light herbal. Insanely amazing aromas with outstanding balance, complexity, and strength of malt and spice notes. Taste of pumpkin pie, gingerbread, nutmeg, cinnamon, clove, brown sugar, pie crust, caramel, and light herbal. No bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of pumpkin pie, gingerbread, nutmeg,cinnamon, light clove, brown sugar, pie crust, and light herbal on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic flavor balance and complexity; with an outstanding balance of malt and spices; and zero cloying sweetness present after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium full bodied; with a slick and lightly syrupy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is extremely well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a world class pumpkin ale. Incredible balance and complexity of malt, pumpkin, and spice flavors; and insanely easy to sip on. A very incredible pumpkin ale offering, and one of the best ever made without a doubt."

"This beer has a great dark orange color, and tastes exactly like pumpkin bread, and its delicious. i have recently fallen out of love with many pumpkin beers, but this one was pretty different and interesting. i really enjoyed it, and it was really well done as a pumpkin (bread) beer. Also it smelled like pumpkin and spices, kind of like the house smells after you bake some pumpkin bread."

"This beer gets a lot of hate, and to me, for no apparent reason. On the opposite end of the spectrum, the reverence this beer gets with drinkers is an embellishment. Regardless, this is still a most enjoyable pumpkin ale with blended spices, brown sugar notes, vanilla, and creaminess in the body. Would love to try the oak-aged version."

"The beer is slightly hazy and autumnal orange colored with a soapy white head. The aroma offers Fall spice, pumpkin bread, brown sugar, rum, malt, cinnamon, pie. Wow. Fabulous scents coming from this beer. Delicious flavor. How is it possible I haven't crossed paths with this beer before? So complex and wonderful. Great feel as well. Thick and syrupy. Not cloying, but sweetness is present throughout. A great beer to split with a few buddies."

"This one I like out of the bevy of pumpkin type products. Lots of pumpkin pie like flavor, nice mouthfeel. Not overly sweet. Definitely can taste the actual pumpkin, so better balanced versus other of this style. Not overwhelmed by the pie spices for a change. A good dessert option - not something to drink a lot of or very often."

"Overall: Yea, it’s a good one. Overall I’d say it’s just very clean with lots of strong flavors but nothing really overpowers anything else. Tough to find any complaints, although some may find it too sweet (I think pumpkin beers should be sweet.) One of the top pumpkin beers I can remember trying out."
"O – Overall this is probably the second best pumpkin beer that I have had after DFH Punkin (and the two are incomparable). It is a very good beer and I will certainly come back to it but it doesn’t enter into my top echelon of beers. Nonetheless, a big tip of my cap to southern tier. Very well done."

"this beer is a polarizer for sure, but if you like pumpkin beers, youve got to love pumking! it pours a very understated pale pumpkin color, right on que, with a few inches of lazy and patient white foam. the nose is incredible, as much like a christmas cookie as a pumpkin pie, this beer has staying power beyond fall into the holiday season because of its unique spice bouquet, which prominently features clove, vanilla, and allspice. there is less squashy aromatics and forward flavors in the draft version than from the bottle, im not sure why. it still tastes like fresh raw pumpkin, but i think the spices intensify in the keg somehow. its still well balanced, with sweet cookie malt and gentle cinnamon up front and the vegetable spice finish on the back end without all the sugary vibes woud expect. the alcohol is also dangerously well disguised. the mouthfeel i thought was also exceptional, really smooth but not heavy at all for a beer of this magnitude. overall one of the best pumpkin beers out, and not least because of its wide seasonal appeal. amazingly well made, this could be southern tiers best offering."

"Pours a very clear bright pale orange with a two finger frothy off white head that slowly recedes to a patchy quarter finger creamy head. Aroma is graham cracker crust, pumpkin pie spices, and vegetable sweetness. Big sweetness up front is followed by mouth coating spices. Like drinking liquid pumpkin pie. No perceptible alcohol. Mouthfeel is exceptional. Smooth and creamy, just a little sweater and it would be cloying. First time reviewing Pumking after having it numerous times. Among the best pumpkin beers available. Big and bold like Southern Tier does best. I can see how some would be put off by Pumking, its a love/hate beer."

"I ran into this delicious pumpkin beer at one of my favorite watering holes, Four Moon, which is around the corner from me. Wouldn't luck have it that after having a couple and promising to be back for more with the next moon rising, there was none to be had. After weeks of searching and kicking the cats I stumbled onto it. My favorite place to go for ribs is Twin Anchors. There may be better ribs but not better establishments. By accident last week I stumbled in and found my self looking at their beer menu. """Hey, bartender, it says here that you have Pumpking here""". I'm sure that the menu isn't up to date but """Oh yes it is. We have several cases of it""". What? I'll take 4 to go and I"""ll be back!"

""

"O: Finely got to try this one and I think it lives up to the hype around it. This is definitely a beer for the pumpkin lover."

"The diacetyl and graham cracker flavors that are intentionally added are the icing on the cake that really make this beer pumpkin pie in a glass."
""
""
""
""

""

""
""
"Appearance is a hazy golden orange supporting a thin head leaving nil lace. Smell of pumpkin and light spice. Taste has whats in the aroma with a good punch of the pumpkin and the sweetness of the caramel malt with good balance of the hops. Mouthfeel is medium with good carbonation. A different enjoyable Imperial that would be good with pumpkin pie."
""
""
"Poured into a snifter from the bottle, Pumpking was a copper color with a very slight off-white head. It leaves a generous lacing around the glass to note staying power. The aroma is graham cracker, cinnamon, nutmeg, and pretty much everything else about pumpkin pie except pumpkin. In the initial taste, one get sour pumpkin, cinnamon toward the back of the throat, a heavy dose of clove, and a hint of nutmeg. One gets a little of the sliminess of pumpkin in the mouthfeel and a certain degree of acidity in the slightly thicker than average ale. For my money, I think this is the best pumpkin ale you can buy despite a lack of pumpkin in most phases of the beer. It is a polarizing beer to many because pumpkin is masked to a great degree. Allow the other elements of pumpkin pie appear nicely though."
"Overall this is a holiday winner. Definitely worth a try even if not your style beer."

""
"Overall, it’s a great seasonal beer. Try to stock up whenever it’s out."
""
"This beer is amazing. Smells delicious, pretty much like sweet pumpkin. Taste follows the nose, absolutely delicious and smooth. For 8.6% alcohol, you cant taste it at all which makes this my new favorite beer. I HIGHLY recommend trying it to anyone."
""
""
"Hazy, but refractive amber with a thick white head that eventually recedes to form a lasting ring. Aroma of fresh pumpkin pie and pumpkin pie spice. Flavor matches the aroma, and I think (unlike many other reviewers) that the body is creamy and ideal to support the flavor, and I don’t think it’s on the thin side for an imperial. Finish is long and on the dryish side, and it leaves you craving another swallow. My favorite example of the style."
"Poured this Pumpkin Ale from a bottle, into a pint glass. This ale poured a dark orange color, produced a thick white head and produced an above average amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma consisted of canned pumpkin, spices, namely cinnamon and nutmeg. Full bodied, this pumpkin ale had a sweet malted grain base, brown sugar, vanilla bean cinnamon and nutmeg. I am a big fan of Pumpkin Ales, and while I dont dislike this brew, i do think that the amount of spices used was out of balance. To much cinnamon, in conjunction with the brown sugar- Average."

"Easily one of my favorite pumpkins although this one might be polarizing. The sweet scent and flavors almost overpower and the spices definitely dominate. Much different than many pumpkins that lean too heavily on ginger or cinammon, I enjoy an allspice-like taste to the beer. The combination of smell and flavor are about as close to a real pumpkin pie as I've ever tasted a beer. If you like pumpkin pie you might like drinking one too."
""
""
"Poured from bottle into a DRH snifter. Nice looking amber brew with a small off white head. Carbonation active on the pour. Smell is like a fresh pumpkin pie! Fantastic aroma that just keeps your nose coming to take a whif. Obviously notes of pumpkin, nutmeg and seasonal spices. The taste follows the nose closely, but adds a tart finish that can be a little distracting. Like most Souther Tier beers, it's pretty over the top with flavor, which can make it unsessionable. Otherwise, it's a true pumpkin beer. Feel is what you would expect. Lots of carbonation and has a dry feel. A bit thin, but decent to medium. Overall- A very interesting, true pumpkin beer. The smell is out of this world and the taste is pretty solid. I wish it were a bit less tart on the finish and more sessionable. True to the ST roots of flavor. A must try-"
""
""
"O: Overall, I think this is a great example of a pumpkin ale. This seasonal classic is certainly something I'll be coming back to next fall, if I fancy some pumpkin ale."
"O: Stands toe to toe with Pumpkinator. If you like pumpkin ales, this one should be on your list. Highly recommended."
"fantastic on tap, maybe i will try a bottle."
""
""

"OVERALL: This is what other beers in the category should strive for. This is an exceptional beer, let alone an exceptional pumpkin ale. The best in class."
"O: This is a special beer for the Halloween occasion. Perfect aroma and flavor with a good story behind it. If you only have one like me, it deserves to be saved for about this time. Best Pumpkin beer I have had this year!"
"O - Pumking could be the quint-essential fall beer. Warm and soothing with alcohol, it'll make you feel good on a cold day and really adds to the best season in the universe. Not overly spicy, more pumpkin does the work in developing that sought-after pie-like flavor. Nicely balanced, this pumpkin beer, while strong and assertive, still carries beer characteristics with it,"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall. I really wasn't expecting to like this beer. Not a fan of most really sweet beers like ST's other offerings, but this one hit the spot. Will drink again, if not this year, next year for sure!"

""

"Even though I ranked this beer mostly 4, I threw in a five in the overall box category because, quite frankly, I just like it. The taste and the smell and the feel individually are good, but they combine at the moment of drinking into something special. I also like that this beer as a sweet, but not to long, after taste."
"Mouthfeel is flat and slightly sticky. Overall, the flatness is a big detractor to an otherwise tasty pumpkin beer."
""
"I have tasted the fresh bottles and have tried one that was stored for a year. I prefer the fresh, being that the fresh pumpkin and vanilla essence had deteriorated in the aged bottle."
"This beer is my favorite! I think I have consumed 2 cases of this beer all by myself. It's a hard beer to find. When they sell it at Whole Foods you have to request it because it's not on the shelves and they only allow 1 bottle per person per day. This beer smells amazing! It smells like vanilla pumpkin. It tastes like vanilla pumpkin without all those spices like nutmeg and cinnamon that can be overpowering. It's smooth. Just amazing!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Letting a bottle of this age for a year was a great idea. It was even better than I remembered. Imagine the best pumpkin pie you have ever had made into a beer; that is what you have here. This is by far the best pumpkin ale I have ever had and one of my favorite beers."
"O- I look forward to my case of this every year... this beer has pretty much ruined every other pumpkin beer to ever touch my glass... another pleasing offering from ST!"
"Overall, glad I finally tried this one but I don't think I'll be revisiting it. Just not really enjoying the taste of this beer so much."
""
""
""
"I found the body to be on the thin side of medium, I kind of wanted a bit fuller feel. Drinkability was surprisingly good, the beer was gone pretty quickly. Overall, probably the pumpkin beer I've liked best. Certainly worth trying if you see it."
""
""
""
""
"T: If the taste was as sweet as the smell, this probably would be a bit much. Luckily, it's not, but it still has a ton of great flavor. Opens with some cinnamon and a touch of pumpkin flesh. Then comes a hit of nutmeg and a finish of toasted malt, more pumpkin and some vanilla. By far the best pumpkin beer I've had. I really wish they would distribute this out here."

""
"Overall: Sweet Jesus! How long has this beer been out? Why haven't I had this before? Why can't I drink this every day? I'm usually pretty skeptical about pumpkin ales, but, man, this is an absolutely fantastic beer. So many complex flavors come together to create a great finished product. I can't recommend this one enough."
""
"But seriously, this has some great tastes that compliment the pumpkin which is decently present in the taste. It has a bit buttered popcorn note which is super weird but it's there whether you like it or not!"
"Had it on tap then had to go out and buy a bottle. I believe it was slightly better on tap but it may because I was so surprised. """Pumpking""". Is so much better than other pumpkin beers. It's very delicious like liquid pumpkin bread. The pumpkin taste is not strong. It has a beautiful orange/copper clear color. It has a very bready quality much like cinnamon rolls, sugar cookies, and pumpkin pie. Most pumpkin beers you are good with just one. This one I kept drinking, then realized the alcohol was 8.6%."
"Overall: Excellent pumpkin beer. Not the best I've had but it's well up there and certainly going to be on my to-drink-again list."
"May be too sweet for some people but I think it's needed in a beer like this. Best pumpkin beer I've had but I haven't had Rogue's Yet..so, so far it's my number 1."

"overall - I'm a fan. Probably slightly biased since its limited and hard to find. The taste is not super spicy and has a sweet semblance without being over sweet on the taste buds. Worth picking up a few bottles every season."

""
""
""
"I have tried at least 15 different pumpkin ales and this one is by far the best. Tastes like pumpkin pie with whipped cream in a bottle but yet still tastes like beer and is 8.6%. I was blown away at how smooth and creamy this beer was. It is quite pricey at $9 for a 22 oz bottle but if you are a fan of pumpkin beers, it is worth every penny."
"Cheers."
""
"I don't usually drink pumpkin beers because of there overpowering taste of coriander . This beer has a very nice color almost like an Octoberfest but more red. The smell is that of fresh baked sweet pumpkin pie. Poured into a tulip glass or pint glass ( tried both) served at 40degrees. Taste notes nutmeg , coriander, pumpkin vanilla and cinnamon and sweet. Nothing is out of balance this is a perfect pumpkin beer. For 2012 Southern Tier nailed the Pumking."

"D- in my neck of the woods, the only beer that created such hype was Great Lakes Xmas, but now it's available at every grocery store, bar, and drive thru. This year, pumking jumped in and suddenly everyone was asking me where to find it, if I could get it on tap, etc. It was nowhere to be found, as if all the bars with access to that particular distributor hogged up the limited supply for my area. When all hope was lost for us to even TRY it so see why it is in such demand, one of my buddies found a ridiculously decent supply at a local and very unassuming store that will for now remain nameless. Best pumpkin ale I've ever had, flat out. Whatever gives it the cookie sweet aroma and balance of flavor is what wins. 8.6 abv isn't huge, but this one is still extremely drinkable. Take me away, lord Puca."
"Pours a clear, orange/copper color. 1/4 inch head of a white color. Slight retention and slight lacing. Smells of citrus hops, floral hops, liquor, slight alcohol, spices (pumpkin pie), slight sugar, and a hint of pumpkin. Fits the style of a Pumpkin Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of alcohol, liquor, floral hops, spices (pumpkin pie), and slight sweet malt. Overall, pumpkin is hardly discernible, and the alcohol is dominate in aroma and body."

"I am planning to stock up on this for the holidays (Halloween, Thanksgiving, if I"""m lucky may last until Christmas/NY :)"
"This beer is always a treat. I am only lukewarm on pumpkin beers but the southern tier version is always a favorite. Poured from a bomber bottle, the beer pours a light copper hue. The smell is light vanilla, pumpkin and nutmeg. As far as taste, I best describe this as a piece of pumpkin pie with whipped cream. The beer is not heavily spiced and really resembles a piece of pumpkin pie. There is a creaminess to the flavor to balance the pumpkin notes. Rich and way too drinkable for the abv. A very tasty treat. I have enjoyed this beer with pumpkin muffins but I would match this beer with other non pumpkin desserts to fully appreciate the ale and dessert. Try this with plain cheesecake or vanilla ice cream."

"O: A satisfying Pumpkin Ale and probably one of the best of the style, albeit this style is very subjective and open to interpretation by the brewer. While I'm not a huge fan, I'm rating this according to style, where it scores quite well in my opinion."
""
""
""
""

""
"Overall: the smell and taste of pumpkin spice is perfect and brings to mind visions of fall, but the sweetness and flat mouthfeel quickly start to outweigh those qualities and make it tiring"
""
""
""

""

" Overall: Another side of the spectrum of pumpkin beer. Not like the pumpkin pie as the others have reminded us of, but definitely unique. I would completely drink this again. Super delicious!"

"O- I'd like to say that this king deserves the crown that everyone wants to give it, but I'm not entirely convinced. Horseheads makes a pumpkin ale that may give this one a run for its money. I'd love to do a side by side with these two."
""
""
""
""
""
"By far the best pumpkin beer I have ever had. The only disappointment is they do not brew this beer year round. But I guess that is what makes it even more exceptional. This beer never last long when ever it is tap so do not hesitate get one when ever you can."
""
""
""
"O-Quite possibly one of the best pumpkin ales I have ever had. I highly recommend this brew to anyone who likes pumpkin ales. EXCELLENT!"

"Overall: one of the best pumpkin ales I've had. Highly recommended to anyone into the fall/pumpkin styles."
"I just love this beer! I bought 2 cases of it at $6.99 per a bottle. It's a hard beer to find. When they sell it at Whole Foods you have to request it because it's not on the shelves and they only allow 1 bottle per person per day. They sell it at Churchkey for $18 a bottle. This beer smells amazing. Smells like vanilla pumpkin. Tastes like vanilla pumpkin without all those spices like nutmeg and cinnamon that can be overpowering. It's smooth. This is my fav beer of all time so far."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Most flavorful pumpkin beer out there. If you don't like sweet/sugary flavors, this is not your beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"overall: amazing achievement. Bravo Southern Tier. Alcohol is imperceptible."
""
"Crisp up front with a very pumpkiny finish. Pours about the same color as a marzen with an excellent aroma. Overall a bit too sweet for me on the finish but a good novelty beer. I still prefer Weyerbacher Imperial Pumpkin to any other pumpkin beer I’ve tried."
""
""
"This is a great pumpkin beer. It certainly has enough competition but it's the best I've had. It really looks like a pumpkin, it has that perfect orange tint. You can really smell and taste the pumpkin in the beer. It's been said before but I'll say it again, the beer really benefits from the real pumpkin in it. The mouthfeel is perfectly creamy."
""
"Overall, I do enjoy Pumking but it is not at the top of my pumpkin ale list like it is for a lot of other people. It is a different brew than the other, more heavily spiced pumpkin ales for sure. Enjoyable but there are still a few others that I would choose over this one if given the choice (Schlafly and Good Gourd to name a couple). Overall a solid brew."
"It's very clear that I need to buy another bottle or two before it goes out of season. This is a really special beer that you must try if given the opportunity."
""
""
""
"I really enjoyed this beer. In the past I had said that there were vanilla notes that I didn't like and the spices were too intense. That doesn't seem to be the case with the 2012 batch. The pie crust and whip cream notes were fantastic. I'm not sure how ST pulled that off, but I'm impressed. This was an all around great beer."
""
""
"OVERALL IMPRESSION: If you enjoy a good pumpkin beer but tire of the in your face stuff and the heavies, this is a good reach. Given some of the interesting twists in Pumpking, it's much more interesting than other examples I've had. Neophytes to the style might find it a bit on the funky side, but I'll be chasing down more of this stuff."
""
""
"O-Southern tier does a good job for their sweet, specialty beers. This is a prime example and my favorite pumpkin beer."
""
"My first time with Southern Tier's Pumking and I have to say, this is the best of the pumpkin ales by far in taste. The coloring is a nice copperish orange and great lacing on the glass. The aroma and the taste put you in the mind of a pumpkin pie as I seriously feel like someone just liquified a pumpkin pie and gave it to me in a bottle. This beer is amazing."
""
"O- I can't drink a ton of it, but once a year, it's a nice treat."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Wow, this beer was very delicious. I really underestimated this brew once I laid first eyes on it. The overall flavors of pumpkin, spices, and caramel cream and vanilla really brings this beer full circle. I would totally enjoy this brew again"
""
""
""
"O: This is my favorite pumpkin beer. Too many pumpkin beers smell just of pumpkin spices and not like the actual fruit where this one actually finds the smell and flavors of pumpkin. This beer sets itself apart from rest. I love pumpkin beer, but this one does it best."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is the first year I have gotten into trying a bunch of pumpkin beers. What I have learned is there is a big gap between the good ones and the bad ones. This is certainly one of the good ones with a phenomenal aroma and very good taste. Pumpkin pie in a glass. Rich and tasty, this probably isn't for everyone, but I really enjoyed it."
""
"O: Alcohol is very well hidden and the beer is really quite delicious - the sweetness is not overbearing or cloying and there is a light amount of hop bitterness that helps to balance it out. Annually, one of my favorite pumpkin beers that is easily accessible in the area.Very appetizing in the smell and the taste."
""
""
""
"Note: Absolutely love the pumking bottle label... WICKED!!! :P"
"Overall, a good pumpkin beer. I'm not a huge fan of pumpkin flavor beers, but I still enjoy trying them. This one isn't bad, but I'm still searching for that one that changes the way I look at pumpkin beers forever."
""
""
"Overall - Wasn't completely blown away by this beer. I feel like if they toned down the malt they could even market this as a Christmas eggnog beer. Lot's of those similar spices at play. Really interesting flavors, good balance between them and the malt. Definitely a great beer and worth a try."
"O: Good beer with more flavor than the typical pumking ale. Alcohol is hidden well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Lots of reviews say this tastes like pumpkin pie. I've never had pumpkin pie this good. Someday I want someone to present me with a fall dessert that tastes this good. Actually, on second thought, I'd rather they just give me a big pour of Pumking."
""
"Wow, if you like pumkin pie, try this...What a great fall beer to warm the pallet and watch a game! This is one of my favorite seasonal beers to bring in Hallow's eve, if you get a chance it's a must have! It's hard to find so good luck it sells out before you can tell your friends."
""
""
"Final Thoughts: This is right up there with the best Pumpkin Ales (which are few and far between). The added graham cracker taste sets it apart and makes it one to seek out as we head into October."
"O: Overall id say pumking is the KING of the pumpkin beers i have enjoyed thus far. Definitely a great brew."

"With dessert, we ordered a """dirty pumpkin""" (layered beer with a top layer of milkstout) which got me to thinking about bombing this with a shot of Bailey's. I'm sure it'll taste JUST like pumpkin pie. I'll update when I make this happen!"
""
"This beer has a pretty good nose. The first thing I noticed was the spice, nut meg creating that classic pumpkin pie aroma. The beer is incredibly smooth, with a nice hoppy bite. This is the first fall seasonal beer that I have tried this year, and It looks like its going to be a great year!"

"Southern Tier has an upper-tier entry pumpkin ale here. Pours a thin light amber with almost no head. Biscuity-malt smell with faint spices. I don't know what the prominent spice is in this beer (is it nutmeg?), but it is so overpowing that it covers up any semblance of pumpkin backbone. Regardless, this is one of the best pumpkin ales around and one that will be in heavy rotation for me as the temperature cools and leaves begin to fall..."
"O - The pumpkin used in these beer makes the world of a difference. The spiced complemented the beer rather than be the only resemblance of pumpkin. Appearance let me down with little head. Great smell from the pumpkin and spices. Great flavor complexity and good full feel to this imperial spiced beer."
"O: This is has been one of my favor pumpkin beers The spice flavor seems a bit more pronounced this year when I think of the past couple years but the pumpkin is still the main player. I look for ward to this beer year after year even though I'm not a fan of the pumpkin style because most are so heavy spiced you could just call a Christmas beer and you'd never no."
"Pours light amber with minimal head and no real lacing. Smell is very sweet, mouthfeel is good and alcohol is not at all overpowering. This beer is like a liquid pumpkin roll - very easy to drink for the strength of it, although I would only want one or two in a sitting due to the sweetness (a great fall desert beer). Not like any other pumpkin beer I've ever had - even if you're not a fan of pumpkins, I would highly suggest that you still check this one out since it may be one you would actually like."
""
""
"Excellent."
""
"(Overall) I really enjoy their 2X Stout and have found that Southern Tier is brewing unique exceptional products and this did not disappoint. I would rate it 1 of the 8 Pumpkin Ales I tried and can say that its unique. If you want to contrast it with another exceptional pumpkin try the Long Trail Brewmasters Series Imperial Pumpkin 4.5"

"O - Southern Tier has done it again! A very complete and well rounded pumpkin brew. I've had other pumpkin brews that captue the flavor of pumpkin, and even pumpkin and associated spices, but not pumpkin, spices and pie crust. This is one amazing brew, and highly recommend this for any pumpkin lover, and would definately buy again."
""
"O - I think this is the best Pumpkin beer made. I didn't care much for this style before trying Pumking. Now I try other Pumpkin beers just to find out if there's anything better. I haven't found anything that compares yet."

"Overall, it is a very good pumpkin sipper that is lacking enough body to back up the hardy flavors and be great."
"Overall, this is a pretty amped up pumpkin ale, but I can see why so many people like it."

"O - 4.25 - Truly pumpkin pie in a glass, which is great if you're me and you love pumpkin pie. Everybody kept saying this was the best pumpkin ale and I didn't want to listen because I had heard it was heavier on the spices, which is exactly what I don't like in a pumpkin ale - just a mouthful of spices. But they were right. This is the best pumpkin ale I've ever had, and I had basically given up on the style. The pumpkin component is right and the spices are deftly done and the accompanying flavors and aromas evoking buttery baked goods are just delicious. The whole thing is beautiful. If I had any way to make it better, I might make it a bit heavier and more robust. It was lighter than expected. Still very good though."
""
""
""
"O- I have to say, this really surprised me. For years I hated the thought of this beer and with time grew a appreciation for different things. I'm really glad I revisited this. Huge improvement in my palate and can't wait to get more."
""
""
""
"In sum, this is a remarkable elixir, as capable of eliciting memory of--and longing for--a taste as any beer I have encountered."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"-now for the taste.. wow. I was not expecting a taste even more delicious than the smell. Imagine biting into a delicious pumpkin pie while drinking one of your favorite ales. Now put it together. Incredible brew here. The taste stays in your mouth for a while, and warms you up really quickly. This is a perfect brew for the holidays, and I've already recommended to many friends and family."
""
""
""
"O – This is an excellent pumpkin beer. Obviously, it got high marks from me, but it would have gotten even higher ones if more of the actual base beer was apparent. Since the pumpkin pie aroma and taste was so outrageously well-done, I can’t give it less than a 4.5 in those categories. This is definitely the best pumpkin beer that I’ve had. I’d really, really like to try the beers from this category that are rated higher."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Great pumpkin beer - if others don't have a strong enough yet balanced pumpkin taste look no further. Appearance is a deep orange with a disappearing head and after a bit is almost non-existent. The smell is incredible with fall spices - brown sugar, nutmeg. A strong breads malt flavor leads into the taste. For those that like pumpkin bread more than just pumpkin this beer's flavor is as close as it gets."
""
""
""
""
"Also, I think this beer excels in a weizen glass rather than a conical pint glass to accentuate the aroma and bring out the head a bit."
"This is my new benchmark for a good pumpkin ale, no competition is even with the scope of what this beer has accomplished in my mouth."
""
""
""
""
"O. like i stated at the start this is a beer I wait and wait and wait for every year. I also for the last two years put a bottle aside to drink on Oct 31st of the following year. cannot wait to crack my 2011 bottle this year."
""
""
"O- A very solid pumpkin beer, a bit sweet but still very tasty (also at $6-7 for a bomber this is a damn steal)."
"O: Wow – this is by far the best pumpkin beer I have ever had. Excellent flavor and aromas and a good amount of alcohol."
""
""
"O - If you are looking for straight up pumpkin pie in a glass, this is the beer to try. Amazing pumpkin ale. Will definitely have again. And again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I've had several other Southern Tier brews - all very good. Just adds to the surprising let down."
""
""
""
""
"This is a rerate after being more accustomed to the style. Still not loving the nutmeg. Pour is a beautiful orange with big fluffy white head. Aroma of spice and wheat, a little dusty. Flavor is lots of pumpkin and nutmeg with cinnamon presence. Flavor is more of the same with a dirty wheaty finish that I still don’t like, some dustiness, slightly dry, and the nutmeg is just overpowering. I just don't get this one--and same goes for the other overly spiced pumpkin beers. Why not make these taste like pumpkin instead of liquid nutmeg?"
""
"O- I really enjoyed this one. It's worth seeking out. This one is more sweet and buttery than some of the other pumpkin ales making it seem more """rich""" The buttery crust flavor mixed with the pumpkin and spices is what makes this a great beer."
"Overall Drinkability: Probably my second favorite pumpkin ale after Dogfish Head."
""
"O: I'm very pleased that I decided to give this beer another try. I must have gotten a bad bottle last year or something. I shared the bottle with a friend so maybe drinking the entire bottle myself last year was too overwhelming. Anyway, a very delicious dessert beer and most definitely worth a try (or two)."
"D: drinks more like a pumpkin spiced latte from starbucks than a beer. this is the best pumpkin beer i have had to date. if you are looking for big flavors in this seasonal style, this is the way to go."
""
""
""
"Overall: A big tasting pumpkin beer in that it has truly captured the taste of pumpkin pie. If you are in the mood for a big sweet pumpkin beer, this is definitely one you should reach for."
"Overall - Who knows, maybe I got a bad bottle. I don't think so, I bought this at a very reputable joint and drank it well before the expiration date. Not exposed to high temps, did not get cold and hot multiple times. I don't know. But this was one of the worst beers I have ever had the displeasure of drinking. My buddy and I both drain poured most of our glasses, which I do not do very often. I'll never buy it again, I would like to try it again to make sure I didn't get a bad bottle though,"
"Mouthfeel: Insanely sticky and filling.  I've never been able to take down a bomber by myself without feeling like I ate and entire family's thanksgiving dinner."
""
""
""
"Overall: This used to be one of the great ones (pumpkin ales), but it has fallen off a bit. Gone is the gord-like pumpkin flavor that has been replaced with a flatter more chemical taste in the end. Not terrible, just not great (much better ones out there). Cheers!!"
""
"O - Excellent pumpkin beer. Not for everyone. The buttery taste for some isn't quite """there""". However, I love it!! One of my favs during Fall."
""
""
"Drinkability: Probably best Pumpkin ale we sell at Hop City, although I am interested to try the Weyerbacher pumpkin. With over 30+ pumpkin beers every season it can get a little overwhelming. I believe Southern Tier achieved exactly what they wanted here so congrats for that."
"2013 - (previous was 2012) - Had some of this on tap and it is a different experience. There is still a pumpkin pie aroma, but the taste is that of an extremely refined strong ale with pumpkin. Outstanding."
""
""
""
"O) This is exactly what you would expect from a pumpkin beer. It's spicy and has bold flavors and if you like seasonal spice-laden beers, you'll love this. It was a bit much for me and I could see maybe having one as a dessert beer after Thanksgiving meal? But overall it was too much spice for my liking."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This is, if not the best pumpkin ale I've had, darn near close. If the carbonation and body were worked it, it would verge on the perfect pumpkin ale."
""
""
""
"Best seasonal beer I had tried so far. The balance between spice and pumpkin was almost perfect, enough spice to compliment but not overpower the pumpkin (which should be the focus of pumpkin beer in my opinion). Definitely makes me way to invest time into trying more Southern Tier brews."
""
""
"O) A really good example of this style. Pumpkin beers can be disappointing when they do not have a pumpkin flavor that clearly shines through, and this one really delivers. Improves as it warms in the glass. I bought three bombers and will wait till late fall to enjoy the other two. This will be perfect sitting next to a fire."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The longer version: I expected something similar to Dogfish Head's Punkin, but this most closely resembled an absolutely horrid Michelob vanilla oak that I tried last year. All I tasted in the Pumkin was a very chemical vanilla taste. Maybe a touch of spice and some alcohol, but every sip was overwhelmed by the vanilla. And I love vanilla! But not in this beer. I very rarely regret a beer purchase, but this impulse buy was literally money down the drain."
""
""
"Overall - great beer that I will purchase every fall to help prepare me for the season ahead."
""
"O: If you enjoy chemical cocktails with mild stomach pain, this is your drink. I refuse to call this beer. I choked down half a pint and drain poured the rest of the bottle."
"Overall: This beer has potential, but the huge bready notes just terrorize this beer. The pumpkin is sapposed to be the star in a Pumpkin Ale, it certain was missed by a long shot in this beer. I am not sure what all the hype is surrounding this beer."
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a great """"pumpkin"""" beer, even though it doesn't have much in the way of genuine pumpkin flavors (realistically though, the flavor of raw pumpkin isn't all that exciting). If you're looking for pumpkin pie in a glass, this is the one you seek.""""
""
""
"You either love it or hate it, I'm a hater. Meh. I'm still not overly impressed by anything from Southern Tier."
""
""
"O-a delicious sipper, but due to the sweetness, not something I would drink a whole lot of"
""
""
"Overall- Was hoping for a little more here. The mouthfeel and smell were there but the taste just didn't get there for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-Gross. Not sure how I see this come up so often in discussion of """best pumpkin ale""". Rarely will I pour a beer down the sink, but I couldn't finish a third of the bomber. Would expect better from Southern Tier."

"O: I really like the cinnamon and graham cracker taste, but I'm slightly disappointed overall."
"O - A large, pumpkin-pie-with-whipped-cream liqueur. A sipper and a good one."
"8/31/2012. Updating review for 2012 version. I see i missed the tap version last year. I was lucky enough to get a sixtel of this wonderful beer this year for home. To update this years flavor, I am once again getting tons of cinnamon, vanilla, caramel, brown sugar and spices. Pumpkin flavor is again lower, but damn, how is this beer that good? Less hops this year, but creamier and smoother and the alcohol is almost non-existent on the tap version. What a superb beer I will enjoy over the next 2 months. The big question is, will I be sick of it by the end of the keg. Stay tuned."
""
""
""
"Best pumpkin beer I've had yet."
""
""
""
"O- Awesome stuff. Tastes like pumpkin pie. Everybody should try this beer if they can get it."
""
""

"The beer pours into a snifter glass like a liquid pumpkin, a beautiful murky orange with amber hints and a little white ring of small white bubbles that leave lazy lines of lacing on the glass. There is a nice steady flow of bubbles and odd enough, there is one spot on my glass where a straight line of bubbles is consistently running up the side of the glass. The beer smells like a pumpkin pie, pulpy with pumpkin meat and spicy with nutmeg, cinnamon, and clove. Sweet and caramel malts could be hiding in the back of the smell but they seem pretty light overall. The beer’s taste follows the nose; it’s a little cloying with the spices which leave a burn on the tongue but overall this beer is a liquid pumpkin pie. The meat tastes a little raw on the tongue and the spices are a little too potent but it comes together in a lovely sip. Mouthfeel is a little fierce with rapid pinpricks of carbonation on the tongue, but this mellows out mostly into a thin syrupy treat. Afterfeel is still tingling from the carbonation and a little burned from the spices. Overall this is a great pumpkin beer; the spice is a little too much, which holds this beer back from being amazing, but by no means stops it from being a great drink. For all you pumpkin beer lovers out there, try it!"
""
"O - This is hands down my favorite pumpkin beer. It's rare that any beer can have this many flavors going on without anything being overwhelming. Stock up, because in a month or 2 you are going to want another and it'll be gone..."
""
"I made it a goal to try as many pumpkin ales as I could last year. I got around to trying about 10 of them and this beer was the best of them all! I am starting my BA career by reviewing my two favorite beers ever GL Christmas Ale and Southern Tier Pumking. I was excited to pick up a growler of this and yes it is August and I hope to have this world class pumpkin ale while sitting by the fire in October. The appearance is orange with kind of a brown tint. It smells like pumpkin pie on Thanksgiving day while watching the Lions! I get a scent of sweet cinnamon, nutmeg and pumpkin. This world class brew tastes Exactly like it smells. It is the most flavorful pumpkin ale I have tried. It is smooth, sweet, majestic and not bitter at all! I recommend this for anyone who wants to try an amazing fall seasonal beer! It is truly one of a kind. I look forward to trying more Southern Tier beers! At 8.6 % it warms you up on a cool fall night."
""
"Next to DFH Punkin, my favorite pumpkin ale. I love that it has a kind of gramham cracker flavor to it. Really tastes like drinking pumpkin pie. Good carb level, and doesn't take a whole lot to get you to a pleasant place. Love drinking it out on the porch in front of the fire pit."

"An aggressive pour gets you a bit over a finger’s worth of off-white foam, does has a soft orange tint to it, majority smaller, finer bubbles which evaporate swiftly, lacing has minimal stickiness as well. While light and transparent, the liquid still has a bronzed metallic orange cast to it, yellows some around the rims, multiple swiftly paced beads of bubbles, good overall shine. The nose is extremely smooth and moves as if there simply couldn’t be a bump in the road, molasses, cinnamon, glazed piecrust, whipped cream, even some chocolate and nuttiness, the sweet spices here mask some of the pumpkin foundation, hint of fig or apricot fruit, strong lift without drawing attention. Medium-bodied, the carbonation is on the thin side and could arguably provide more structure. That said, has an overall dry texture even as the constituent parts are all sweet as hell. The pumpkin stronger while still paling before the clove, cinnamon spice, brown sugar, orange marmalade, crust flakes and more whipped cream and caramel. At times it seems to almost have a floral perfume. There is a loss of grip through the finish. If you want sweetness without undue heaviness, check it out."
"O: I don't know about this one, I'm kind of in between. I liked it, but it was a bit overly sweet for me. Having only sampled an 8 oz. serving, I think a bomber of this would be too much for me simply because its so sweet and rich. Overall however, its definitely a well done beer and if you're a pumkin pie beer fan, this is definitely a must try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is easily one of the best pumpkin ales on the market if one is looking for sweetness. Those that do not like a sweet pumpkin ale need not apply. Southern Tier has done a great job bottling pumpkin pie as a flavor and aroma, but sadly fall short in the appearance and mouthfeel (the latter of which would really sell the beer). Still, taste is what beer is all about, and in that respect this beer is a runaway success. I could probably forgo making pumpkin pie this year and just buy a case of these instead. 15.5/20"

"Overall – A sweet delicious brew. Like drinking a smooth liquid pumpkin pie. While not one I would want with great occasion it is a perfect dessert beer for the cooler fall days."
"ST is $!"
"Very bronze almost orange color. No head or lacing when I poured it. Smell reminds me more of pumpkin pie scented candles and I get a little buttery caramel. Taste is where I absolutely dig this beer. I get more pumpkin than pumpkin pie but the pie spices are there. I taste the caramel too. Very well balanced taste. Very smooth and easy to drink, and I just can't get enough of the taste every sip. I could see someone not being into this beer or pumpkin style in general, but if this is what you're looking for you're going to love it."

"Review from 9/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a rich orange amber with slight head, but nice lacing from what's there. Strong, delightful pumpkin aroma. Tastes of pumpkin, spices and malt; medium mouth feel, creamy. Sweet, but is nicely balanced. One of the best pumpkin ales. Delicious."

"Pretty exceptional, remains my favorite pumpkin beer to date (I've tried oh-so-many, none pass muster). Would love to include a more fleshed-out review, but it's been so long that I've had this beer. I now live 2,000 miles away from the east coast and have been missing it, every season."

"Bright copper colored, with a very light head that dies back quickly leaving a light ring and little chunks of foam that slowly slide back down the glass. Smell is pumpkin, cinnamon and nutmeg. Taste is pumpkin, nutmeg and a little biscuity malt in the background. The feel is light with lots of carbonation with a medium-dry finish and a lingering bitterness and trace of spices. Overall this is excellent, with a nice warming alcohol finish that isn't too boozy and a nice pumpkin taste that isn't overdone."

"This is a big mess. Diacetyl and DMS? This needs some work. Of the handfull of times I have had this, it is always pretty awful."
"O: Totally undrinkable. I pride myself in finding something enjoyable in just about every beer, but I found myself unable to finish this. It's not even the cloying sweetness, I can enjoy Choklat from time to time, it's the diacetyl that was truly aversive. I hope for Southern Tier's sake that I had a bad bottle."

"O- It's a pretty exceptional pumpkin beer and the ABV is QUITE masked. I'm glad I split this 22oz bomber with the wife or i'd be halfway drunk."

"Poured from bomber to pint glass. No dates. Pours an opaque orange color with a thin white cap, some retention and lacing, not much though. While it may not be an impressive looking beer it smells great! Smells like a pumpkin pie. Pumpkin, chai, cinnamon, vanilla, all spice. Very good. Literally smells like a liquid pumpkin pie. The flavor continues where the nose left off, though a bit softer. The nose was so powerful I expected the flavor to be as dominant. Tastes just like the nose though a bit softer. Mild bitterness. Lighter end of medium bodied with some carbonation. Overall, a very good pumpkin beer. It would have been nice to have a more dominant flavor, but it was still very good. Hides the abv very well. Enjoyable!"
"Mouthfeel is suitable for the style. Overall, I look forward to this release every year. It's unique and hearty, delicious."
""
""
"Overall one of my favorite beers and breweries. A superb pumpkin beer that I always look forward too. Easy to drink and enjoyed by everyone."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not only is the aroma a heavy blend of pumpkin and spice, but so is the taste. It is a very smooth beer and easy to drink, with a slightly dry aftertaste that makes you want to drink more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is by far the best pumpkin beer I've had so far. I wish I could get this in California more often. Superb."
""
""

""
"Definately one to revisit from time to time!"

"The beer pours a lovely, crystal clear orange color. A finger of white foam dissipates quickly. This is a very attractive looking brew. The nose is pumpkin and spice forward. The most pumpkin aroma I've ever smelled in a beer. Taste mirrors the nose with huge pumpkin pie flavors. Cinnamon, cloves, allspice, and brown sugar abound. There is a hint of hoppy bitterness in the finish which works well here. The beer is medium bodied with a nice mellow level of carbonation. Overall this is a quite enjoyable offering from Southern Tier. I am not normally very fond of spiced beers, but this one pulls it off in spades. Recommended."

"Every year I sample dozens of Octoberfest and pumpkin beers, but this one always delivers the best Fall spice/pumpkin flavor, with just the right amount of sweetness (cinammon/brown sugar) and cardamon, and a ton of upfront pumpkin with a crisp, not syrupy mouth. A gem that comes and goes too fast each year, in my book. So I typically stash 3-4 bottles and drink them into Spring/Summer. Delicious brew!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a small offwhite head with a yellow/orange body. Aroma of spicy bread with candied sweetness. Flavor was a little too overpowering for me; reminded me a lot of candy corn type taste. A fun beer to try but the flavors were too much for me; recommend trying this with a group or in small doses."
""
"O - Not your standard pumpkin beer. I buy this one every year and always enjoy it."

"O: Amazing aroma, great taste, and just an overall well well done beer. I will rarely give a beer a 5.0 but this is one beer that I feel is quite deserving of it."
""
""
""

"Overall: This is certainly one of the strangest beers I have had, but I thoroughly enjoyed it and will certainly be having this again in the future!"

"Throw in a little bit of marshmellow and pie crust or maybe graham crackers and you pretty much have this beer. I'm not really ones for pumpkin forward beers, but so far, I'd have to say my ideal one is something that is supplementing a beer or in tandem with another big flavor like hops a la Punkin or a bold stout. Well, and Ichabod the wild ale, that's damn good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"In my humble opinion, there are two broad categories of pumpkin ales. There are ales that carefully balance pumpkin and spices to create a subtle, well-balanced beer, and there are ales that just try to create a total pumpkin and spice bomb. Generally, the latter is an absolute disaster, but somehow Southern Tier pulls it off. The 2011 edition of Pumking is definitely better than the 2010 edition, but 2009 was better... I actually bought a case of it that year, so I remember it well."
""
""
"I feel like I am drinking a pumpkin pie when I have this beer. Spicy, sugary, lots of cinnamon and ginger(?). Some nutmeg. Body is solid; moderately carbonated. Don't drink it too cool - better as it warms a little. I could drink this while I eat some apple and pumpkin pie."

"O – Aggressive pumpkin bread flavor is stellar, but a bit overpowering."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark copper color with little carbonation and very thin lace of head. Smells like sweet pumpkin pie. Definitely can taste the 8.6% ABV here. Inject some alcohol into some pumpkin pie and this is what it tastes like. Goes down pretty with a very slight bitterness in the back of the throat. Overall this is a great beer and at $7 for 22oz bottle and 8.6%. I'll be taking my time enjoying this."
""

"O: This was the first Pumpkin Ale that I've ever tried. It's probably me, and I just might not like the style, but I would never try this beer again. That being said, this beer had THE BEST aroma that I've ever smelled in a beer. Even an amateur like me can catch a glimpse of some of it's greatness. I can see why it's considered excellent, I just don't consider it that myself."
""
"D/O: While the flavor and the smell of this beer are each remarkable when taken on their own, the whole ends up being somewhat less than its parts. It has a musty and savory quality that is likely attributable to the pumpkin, continually disorienting the palate until fatigue begins to set in."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Flavor leans to heavy on the pumpkin side for my liking. The rich pumpkin and burnt pie crust flavors aren't balanced out by the spices. Bitter hops are present but drowned out by the other flavors. That combined with a thick feel leaves me desiring a more refreshing brew. Clearly I'm in the minority with this one."
"Overall the best pumpkin beer i've tried and now the standard i'll compare to others. Will buy again next year."
""
"O - one of the more unique pumpkins I've tried in terms of flavour as it relies very little on the pumpkin pie spice angle, ABV is extremely well hidden making this a tasty and dangerously drinkable treat"

""
""
""
""
"Overall: I've noticed that this beer is quite polarizing, and I can see why. Many of Southern Tier's offerings are a bit over the top and this one is no exception. That said, I really enjoy sharing a bottle of Pumking during the Fall season."
""
""
""
"M: Medium bodied; nice mouthfeel, good crusty\bready mouthfeel and great carbonation. A bit cloying, but the slight alcohol note is keeping it in balance."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I look forward to this beer every fall as it is one of my favorite, readily available pumpkin beers. I feel that there are subtle nuances that change from year to year. ST should pick one way of brewing it and stick with it. Regardless, I still love this beer."
""
""
""
"O: A good pumpkin ale. I enjoy it, but it has a somewhat artificial taste to it--like pumpkin pie-flavored candy or the like. It really reminds me of a fall mix of shisha that I've had before, and I really can't get that out of my mind. Not that that's a bad thing."
""
""
""
""
"Perhaps the best pumpkin (pie) beer out there!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is an awesome beer as long as you don't drink it with the mindset of it being a pumpkin-forward beer. This is probably the best pumpkin pie-style beer out there. Just awesome."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: It's easy to see why this is one the most popular pumpkin brews every year."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is by far my favorite of the pumkin style beers. I have had this from the tap, the bottle, the growler, and even from the fermentor on one lucky occasion. This beer pours a little hazy but has a wonderfully thick head and balances itself out after leaving just a trace of lacing on the glass. I know it is a little bit on the sweet side but it is truly my favorite imperial stout. I went so far as to buy a 1/6 keg for my kegerator. I drink it out of a goblet and find that 2 or 3 beers later my life seems much less hectic. If you get a chance to try it please do. Dont let the $9 price tag on the bottle throw you. It is worth every penny."
""
"O: Disappointed I split this with my wife, as I am still craving more. This is the best pumpkin beer I've ever had, and I will make it a point to have several every fall, if possible."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - My favorite pumpkin beer. I'm generally not a huge fan of the style but I really enjoy this one. I might be a little biased in my review since pumpkin pie is one of my favorite foods and this beer tastes and smells just like pumpkin pie."
""
""
""
""
"The smell is like a pumpkin pie baking, it smells sweet like you should serve it with whipped cream but then again that would not go well. I like the burnt orange color and that it is semi cloudy. The taste is strong but not too powerful. I enjoy the different spices and how they dance on your tongue.I can't have only one glass and I usually drink it until it has been exhausted at all my favorite bars."

"D I have had three pints since starting this review about 10 minutes ago. I find it very drinkable considering its relative size, ABV and sweetness. It might be my favorite predominantly sweet beer. Overall this is a great beer. 4.5"

"Overall I think this beer just has too much Pumpkin taste and aroma for me. I do enjoy pumpkin beers, but there can always be too much of a good thing. This pumpkin beer just doesn't really do it for me. I'd say it's really about average as far as the pumpkin beers go. Thanks so much to McNuts for this bottle! I really wanted to try this and am glad I got the chance to."
""
""
"Wow, what a beer. Growler is a month old and just seems to have held up well. Taste compares well to a glass I had on tap. Very large and impressive head that settles after a while and leave a light covering. Some lace in spots. The smell of this one sets the bar for the style. Lots of pumpkin and spice. Nutmeg is big with allspice and cinnamon as well. A large graham crust take on the malt which is huge. This nose has me salivating and looking for ice or whipped cream. There is a faint alcohol edge that gives a mild sharpness. Taste is big pumpkin and spice. A sharpness pierces the perfect impression of pie for me, the hops combining to make a super dry and clean finish that combines with the pumpkin and spice to hang a bit too aggressively in the back of my throat. Not a deal breaker but it mars the overall smoothness of what is really a remarkable beer. The malt is so supportive and deliciously caramel bready. The pumpkin flavors fly and take wing atop this beautiful platform. Feel is surprisingly light as the flavors give notice to the weight. Carbonation just, ( I mean just ) off target as I would prefer a tiny bit more given the sugary sweetness to help break it up. Splitting hairs here. Still a good feeling beer. You are not gonna be sessioning this one, too strong, too intense. Just a great imperial pumpkin ale. Rich and yummy. Not perfect but so close that if this is as close as it gets I wont be crying."

"Overall this is hands down the best Pumpkin ale out there. I just wanna put it on plate and eat it. Such a great balance of malts and spices...Pumking is indeed the king."
"D-Overall this was a nice pumpkin beer. Had awesome aroma but i couldn't have more than 1 glass of this in a day. It has too much flavor and a little overly sweet. Overall it was still a nice brew"

"Overall - A very good pumpkin beer and much better than the only other one i've tried (Wychwoods Pumpking).. one for sharing though as 650ml would be way too much for one person... recommended"
"Pretty nice."
""

""
""
""
""
"Intangibles: This is a tough beer. It's seemingly stylistically flawless, but there's something that doesn't sit well. It's not exactly a drain pour, but I'm not exactly throwing myself down the basement stairs to crack the last bottle. That said, I feel it's much better with a year on it than it was fresh. That last bottle can wait til 2012."

""
""

"Taste is more of the same -- pumpkin pie up front, chased by a strong, dry, and pungent spice finish that obscures the relatively high 8.6% ABV. Delicious and a new pumpkin ale favorite!"

"Heavy on the spices, with less of the pumpkin showing through. Huge, spicey nose of pumkin pie seasonings and malty sweatness. Alcohol comes through a bit, but well hidden overall. Mild hops peak out every now and then, but play a supporting role. A pumpkin beer for people who love pumpkin beers, playing a bit to the stereotypes, but getting them all right. A great pumpkin beer, but not necessarily a great beer. Liking this less the more I have it and the more time goes on, but a classic nonetheless. For those interested in the other side of the coin try Dogfish Head's Punkn' and the Smuttynose offering."

"Overall: Very much like a pumpkin pie. Definitely the sweetest pumpkin brew I've tasted. Well balanced. Cheers!"
"Overall their isn't anything I can say about this beer that hasn't already been said. It is simply one of the best pumpkin beers available."
"Poured from a bomber into a tumbler pint, the beer is an orange-yellow coloring with a slight hazing and a thin, white film of head. Slow bubbling carbonation throughout the beer. Smells are like pumpkin bread, with a good dose of cinnamon and an overall roasted character. The beer's flavor is amazing. Sugary sweet, with a huge pumpkin and cinnamon component, as well as an underlying roasted backbone. Tastes like a pumpkin cookie right out of the oven. The aftertaste is creamy and rich, with pumpkin and buttery tones. The finish is quick and clean. Very impressive."
"O: this beer...surprised me in its grossness. What happened? Maybe I had a bad bottle, maybe I'll get it on tap and try it again. But for now, gross. Overpriced, too at $8 per 22 oz."
"This is a very cool experience. I thought I bought two bottles, and I am sad now... because I realize that this was my only bottle. And... I can't drive to find another bottle after finishing this bottle."
"Hail to the Pumking!"
"This is one of my favorite pumpkin ales. Pours an orange color with a white head. The head does not last too long. It smells of multiple roasted spices and pumpkin. Tastes almost the same as the smell. Good carbonation. Not one of the best beers I have tried but overall the best pumpkin ale I have tried."
"Drinkability: It's a smooth drinkable beer accompanied with good flavors and aromas."
"Price point - $6.99 for a 22oz bottle"
"D: Heck of a pumpkin beer, despite it being a little more sugar and spice than pumpkin in taste . Sweet, but refreshing. Deceivingly alcoholic tho, a testament to its drinkability."
"O: Overall this was just okay for me. I enjoy the pumpkin flavors of DFH Punkin rather than the big pumpkin pie spice notes this one has to offer. Couldnt finish bomber, should selling in smaller bottles. Still probably wouldnt buy again."
"o - a decent beer, but i don't understand the hype. as far as pumpkin beers go, this one doesn't do it for me. might improve with age once the hops fade, but i'll pass on a fresh one from now on."
"Overall: I've tried this several times and I just don't get it. It's better than a bad pumpkin beer, but it tastes an awful lot like buttered popcorn jelly beans."
"O - This is a very good pumpkin beer and its hitting the spot with the colder fall weather very easy to drink with is very good taste worth getting your hands on to try sometime"
"Overall, I'm glad I got to try this but I wasn't blown away. It all just seemed like too much. I do like some pumpkin beers but this one got a bit too sweet and cloying. Not sure I'll seek out again."
"P.S. to self try again next year."
"Overall- If you like your pumpkin ales to be sweet and be reminiscent of pumpkin pie, then this is quite the pumpkin ale to pick. The hops do add a bit of a sharp after taste on the palate that is a little out of place, but this pumpkin ale is still incredibly enticing."
"Great beer. Probably my favorite pumpkin ale so far. Strong pumpkin and spice notes with a butterscotch finish. Perfect amount of carbonation and surprisingly smooth for an imperial. Strong, spicy pumpkin aroma. Pumpkin and alcohol taste seemed to intensify as the temperature of the beer rose. All in all this is a great pumpkin ale."
"I still prefer pumpkin brews that actually have pumpkin flavor, but the spices are very well balanced in this brew and it's one I go back to every year."
"Overall: Well, like a lot of ST's beers, its a dessert. If you really have a desire for pumpkin pie in a glass...that gets you drunk, then Pumping is the answer!"
"Serving Type - Bottle."
"O: I had a few pumpkin beers this seasonand this was the best of the bunch. It combines a good pumpkin flavor without any overbearing sweetness or weak flavors"
"O: One of the best pumpkin ales out there. Big flavors that hide the high ABV."
"O: Very close to being great, but still a very enjoyable beer that I would recommend to anyone who enjoys the style."
"A little different take on the pumpkin ale - rather than focusing on the pumpkin, the emphasis is more on the pumpkin spice, and the overall effect is as much a spiced winter warmer as a pumpkin ale. Nutmeg holds center stage, but in the background, there was a bit of an almost-odd butterscotch, caramel candy sweetness. Mouthfeel was a little slick at times, and leaned toward astringent at the end."
"O: A really solid pumpkin beer with authentic flavors."
"it served cold although it holds it's own at warmer temperatures. As a guy who traditionally enjoys a more hoppy beer, I appreciate Pumking because it provides a welcomed change of pace. After a summer of light """clean""" beer I can't wait for the fall where thicker, heartier beers begin to surface and Pumking is always my first choice."
"O: I probably drank 8 or 10 pumpkin beers this month to explore the style, and intentionally saved the best for last. This is the clear winner (I can forgive the mouthfeel) and one of only two I will get in the future."
"Drink- I wanted this to be so much more. I really wanted creamy, pumpkin, spice, biscuty crust. I got some water, spice, nutmeg and some banana. I WILL SAY <-- Please notice the caps. Just because this was not what I wanted, I will score a D or C-. This deserves its B range rating for being a good and impressively masked 8.6 giant seasonal."
"overall - great brew, good pumpkin/spice/gingerbread flavor, festive and tasty, easy to drink/sip"
"O - what an amazing seasonal brew, granted i find it hard thinking of this as a beer, anyway i will say that i did crack this bomber alone which i rarely do and this is going to be the only brew i have tonight which is fine but a definite sipper. i did not think this beer was cloying by anymeans or too boozy. well done and i like the twist, hurry up to TX."
"One of the worse pumpkin beers I've had. Not much pumpkin flavor at all, and what's there isn't great. More like a spiced pie crust beer. Weird and not all that good. Unlikely I'll finish this bomber. I find it surprising that's it's rated so highly by so many people."
"Big thanks to Illudium for the sample. Happy Halloween!"
"O- Will enjoy every drop. Very good seasonal, although I would be less inclined to purchase outside of Fall."
"Serving type: bottle 6.99 1pt6oz"
"This rates pretty highly, so Southern Tier must be doing something right. Maybe I just don't dig pumpkin beers, let alone those with an 8.6 abv that bring back childhood nightmares of being laid up in bed with a hacking cough. This was purchased two weeks ago, and I'm thinking it may improve with age....but I shouldn't need to hold onto it for a year to enjoy it. Nine dollar drain pour."
"Not for everyone; many friends concede that they enjoy it but far prefer more subtle pumpkin tones. To me, it's a rare seasonal treat."
"Poured my allotment into a pint glass. Pours a slightly hazy orange with a good finger-width off-white head on top. Spotty lace left behind. Nice sweet nose with notes of nutmeg, pumpkin, cinnamon, toasted sugar. The mouth is moderately full. Carbonation is still good. I wasn't a huge fan of this beer fresh. I know this seems to be the standard for this style, but it was overly sweet and spiced I remember. I really liked this beer better with some age on it. The nutmeg is still there, but it is much more balanced with a mild sugary sweetness, backed up by a good pumpkin smack. I couldn't have a bomber for myself, as the flavors are a little tiring, but it was a nice beer to split with a friend in the midst of a pumpkin-carving-slaughter."
"Taste is almost all nutmeg. Nutmeg with subtle cinnamon up front. Very strong pumpkin flavor. Dry finish. Does not linger. I couldn't drink this all year long, but an amazing seasonal offering."
"O – Loved it. Plain and simple to date its my favorite pumpkin beer. Its definitely sweet but that fades quickly to a nice solid brew."
"For me very much Christmas spice associations in this beer, a dessert alternative at Yule!"
"I like this beer served quite cold...keep it refreshing, but as it warms up it does start to change its properties."
"I recently had 8 friends judge a taste test including 19 different pumpkin ales and Pumking came out on top by a mile. You can read about it here: http://tristatebeerblog.blogspot.com/2011/10/great-pumpkin-tasting-results-and.html There is something about this beer that does make it the """King""" of Pumpkin Ales."
"O - Wow - most pumpkin beers are over the top American Browns with spices added on top. This one is genuinely pumpkin pie in a chalice."
"O - the perfect pumpkin beer. It's the best one I've had."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Overall this is named Pumking for a reason. My favorite Pumpkin beer available."
"1 year old bottle from John. Pours a clear orange copper with a small head. Nose is singularly pie crust, almost no pumpkin element but some faint spices. Very odd approach to the normally lush pumpkin pie nose in good pumpkin ales..."""let's go for the crust""". Mouth is also crust-forward, throughout the palate with little bitterness to speak of. Some pumpkin meat in the mouth too, and nutmeg. So much cooked pie crust, bready, buttery. A crust bomb. As this breathes it becomes more buttery, salty, crusty. Gross."
"WOW Fed Ex just dropped a case of 22 ounce bottes off...this seasonal beer is just awesome, highly recommneded on tap if you can find some, My craft beer bar gets a keg every year and it lasts maybe 3 weeks. FIlls the mouth with fall flavor and has a great fragrance. Watch for gobblins and enjoy a glass of this great beer."
"Beautiful light copper, smells like pumpkin pie spice (lots of nutmeg) but also with a deep creamy richness... mmm. The flavor is vanilla/butter (something that actually manages to taste like pie crust? I don't know where it comes from, but it's creamy and I love it), caramel, beautiful rich pumpkin and spice. Very creamy but also sugary mouthfeel so that it weighs on you to some extent--there could be more carbonation--but hey, this is Thanksgiving dessert, right? I don't know if I could ask for a better pumpkin beer--this absolutely deserves its reputation."
"i will say that the young lady who was sitting next to me loved it and proceeded to finish the entire bottle."
"O: This is the best pumpkin beer I have tried, without a doubt. I'm not a huge pumpkin fan, but Southern Tier makes me like pumpkins."
"All in all, not a bad pumpkin beer, but perhaps served best when you have a cold and your nose isn't working up to snuff."
"Overall: a solid pumpkin ale. Southern tier has mastered the flavored beers."
"All hail the Puca the Pumking!"
"To this day I still have yet to find a Pumpkin Ale that can top Pumking. You have to like the style, have to like in your face spices, and have to be okay with a certain sweetness. Southern Tier takes most their beers to the extreme, which I love and this is no exception."
"Taste sweet, hoppy, spice, and pumpkin...really great balance and unique interpretation of the style. I would say it is my favorite pumpkin ale and I look forward to it every year. Just buy it!"
"The mouthfeel was rich and creamy. Drinkable, not cloying. Adequate carbonation. Nice."
"Strong spice characteristics, but very little bitter to balance the sweet malt. This is my #2 best pumpkin of 2011."
"The only thing that would prevent this from being my go-to pumpkin is the price. I think there is at least one better option in a six back but I'll certainly look forward to a Pumpking from time to time."
"This is a dessert beer. The flavcrs are huge! Maybe a bit less spice, but an unforgettable beer."
"It may be evident from my review, but I really enjoyed 2010 Pumking. Though I suppose my palate may have changed in the intervening months, this year's batch is really not a very enjoyable beer to drink. The tantalizing mixture of sweetness and spices that defined past vintages is totally lost here. A big disappointment for me."
"Clear orange in body with fading white bubbly head. Mmmm, one of the best aromas around: pumpkin spice, pie crust, cinnamon, whipped cream, caramel. A dessert beer: pumpkin pie, whipped cream, intense spice, burnt crust turns to warm booze toward the finish. Medium body with a slick mouthfeel. Definitely warms the belly during the Fall months. Tasty, almost borderline delicious, probably the best big pumpkin beer."
"D: Although this isn't something I would want to drink every day, it's near perfect for when you're craving pumpkin in the fall."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with below average carbonation. Pretty smooth overall. Overall, this is a pretty good brew. I love the way it takes me back to my younger days of eating my mother's pie. Definitely worth grabbing a bottle or two each fall!"
"Overall: I have had this on draft several times last year at the Union Brewhouse and about time I had to review it. Out of all the pumpkin beers I have tried over the past few years, this seems to be amongst the top ones. Will look forward to having more of this beer in the future."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the huge spice on the nose, and with an equivalent strength in the taste. There was pumpkin, nutmeg, clove, but it was at times a bit too bitter. The mouth coating was actually weird, with thick, oily metals, making it downright unpleasant. Where it really lost points was in the lack of overall richness and warming that one might expect from such a classically seasonal brew."
"Overall: I haven't had any pumpkin beers that I love yet, but this is one of the best ones I've tried of the style. It's quite sweet, but 22 oz was almost too much. One of these as a desert beer is good, but I'd only want one in a session. Nice beer for the season."
"O- Great Brew. Best Pumpkin of the Year, again. Get one now."
"Overall this is a great pumpkin/holiday beer. Big flavors that are very natural and real. Great balance. Probably my favorite pumpkin beer now. A must try if a pumpkin beer fan."
"Overall: Very good beer overall. One of the best pumpkin ales available. Definitely worth trying."
"Overall, I liked it enough to buy another one next fall but not enough to stockpile it and not enough that I will be counting down the days until it comes out again."
"M: EtOH, with a bit of cloying heaviness"
"Overall / Drinkability: Quite nice. I shared this beer but I could see myself finishing off a whole one of these on my own. So very drinkable. Strikes me as very much a dessert beer though - not sure how I would pair this with food. The only drawback is the lack of lacing, but the color is still good."
"O: an enjoyable pumpkin beer although don't expect it to have a very strong presence."
"Thanks #2."
"Pours a light hazy orange with visible active carbonation and a minimal layering of frothy head that quickly dissipates. Aromas of sweet potato, strange medicinal pumpkin, vanilla, and chi tea. Very flavorful, with strong notes of vanilla and pumpkin. A bit spicy on the palate towards the end of the sip with some remnants of cinnamon and nutmeg. Slightly over-sweet pumpkin flavor throughout the sip with a noticeable alcohol presence. Mouthfeel is highly carbonated and quite thin. Overall, not my first choice for a pumpkin ale this fall, but it is definitely different from those I have had in the past."
"Overall, this is like liquid pumpkin pie mixed with rum and brown sugar in a bottle. Wow. This is a bit much to take for one person. Plan on splitting one of these bombers with friends during a pumpkin beer tasting event. This is an experience that you should try at least once."
"Overall, a pleasant desert beer. Smells like cake, tastes like beer. Tasty for the style. Very unusual and worth a try."
"I didn't really expect to like this beer as I'm not a huge pumpkin fan and have been very up and down on southern tier, but this is quite good, very unusual and one of the few pumpkins I would go back for."
"By far the best pumpkin beer that I’ve tried to date. I find most pumpkin beers taste like beer with added pumpkin flavor, but here it is a little more distinct in giving the full pumpkin pie experience melded with beer. There is a prominent element of sweetness, more in smell than taste; however, there is a reasonably good balance with the bitterness of the hops that it’s not one dimensional. I was concerned it would be too sweet, but it’s not. I would be curious to see how this beer changes with age. Still this genre is a bit of a novelty, but this is an enjoyable seasonal release. I would say overall definitely try this beer!"
"It can be difficult for me to dismiss personal preference and be objective when reviewing a beer, but I think I can pull that off here. This is a well-made beer, although it's a little too sweet for my taste. I could see this being a once-a-year-special treat or something to bust out for a special occasion, but the next time I seek a pumpkin beer I'll probably get something that isn't as sweet."
"Its definitely one I will return to, and I'm very glad I got to try it-- but Schlafly by a mile."
"O- a great pumpkin brew,that i like to have in the fall"
"D - I've found my favorite pumpkin beer. This has the real pumpkin flavor I've been searching for. Although a tad bit too sweet, this is probably the best example of the style."
"It's good, but not great."
"All and all an ok pumpking beer but just expected this to build up to the hype and the nose."
"O: It's almost liqeur-like in mouthfeel and flavor. Decent. Pretty tasty, even, but only in small amounts, and it's not terribly well balanced. I do wonder what this would be like with some age on it, but I'm not willing to go that extra step when there are better, cheaper pumpkin ales out there."
"A very pleasing light amber color with no foam at all. Heavy smell of sweetness with pumkin. Tastes like drinking Halloween candy. Couldn't even finish the glass it was so sweet. Might be something one would try if they want beer that doesn't taste anything like beer."
"Overall, just an average pumpkin ale, a little thin for my taste and a touch too sweet."
"Medium bodied and sluggish, though not entirely tepid. Meh, this seems to be really well liked, but it doesn't do that much for me."
"Very thin in appearance but nice light amber color. The only smell is of spice and something that reminds me of a pie crust. Slightly spicy, very sweet with a big pumpkin hit at the end. The bottle says they use pumpkin puree directly in the mix and I really believe it. This really is more like eating a pie than drinking a beer as there is almost no hint of hop, malt or anything other than spice, pumpkin, sugar and crust. Very different from other pumpkin ales I've tried. I'd call it hearty, filling, and something worth a try."
"Overall, a great pumpkin brew that resembles a pumpkin pie to thr max"
"Cheers"
"Overall: An excellent pumpkin beer. Worthy of the name. This is a sipper, but I could drink the whole bottle if I felt like it."
"If you wish to drink your dessert, this one is worthy. Of course, you must be willing to get a little spooky after an 8.6% bomber. As far as a pumpkin beer goes... this is by far the most pumpkiny...y, er pumpkinyest that I have met."
"O: I thought this was a great beer. I like the heavy pie crust aroma and flavor. A great blend of pumpkin and spices. Totally what I want on the first cool weekend of the fall. Will absolutely buy again."
"Can't complain about this one being bland like I find with so many other pumpkin ales. If anything, it's overloaded with flavor and I enjoyed it."
"O - I'm on the fence about this beer, but I think I lean more towards """awesome.""" It is certainly among the best pumpkin(g) beers that I have had thus far, and it worth checking out for comparison if you didn't like some of the other popular pumpkin brews."
"It's a knockout with artisanal goat cheese served over butternut squash puree. It would be a winner with Thanksgiving Dinner, or a slice of pumpkin pie. I recommend it with something savory, though, to balance the sweetness."
"EDIT: I've had it on draft subsequently and would recommend going that route if possible!"
"Pours a nice copper orange with 1-2 fingers of tight bubbly head. Smell is, well, pumpkin. Sweet pumpkin and autumn spices - cinnamon, nutmeg, etc. The taste is even more like pumpkin pie with a big dollop of whipped cream. Overall, an interesting brew and very unique even within it's style. I could have one or two these per year, but that's it."
"The body is light with good full carbonation. Overall for pumpkin ales this is the real deal. No nonsense pumpkin flavor, and that's generally what I'm gunning for."
"O- So it may be like drinking candy or a soda and therefore it's not """real beer""" but it's a f*ckin great beverage and that's all I care about. If you haven't had this yet, you have to try it whether or not you're a fan of pumpkin beer or beer in general."
"Overall this beer has potential. I've had a number of different southern tier offerings and I always find them to be to malty for me. This beer could be pretty darn good if they turned down the sweetness and spices a bit. Unless they change up the recipe or make a different version of this brew I probably wont be picking it up again any time soon."
"Copper/amber colour, ring of white head, no retention and no lace to speak of. Smell is of almond, pumpkin pie, cinnamon and spice, graham cracker and pie crust. Taste is of pumpkin, pie crust, almond and caramel, they really nailed the pumpkin flavour on this one. Low-med carbonation, sticky feel, full body, good weight. Really good stuff, last year I was on the fence about this and was going to pass on it this year but I'm glad I didn't because this is really good and certainly one of the best pumpkins around."
"O: Definitely a highlight of the pumpkin ales I've had. This is unlike other pumpkin ales, there is a sweetness and a grainyness that is not in any other."
"Clear, bright orange color with a head that quickly fizzles away to nothing. Crumbly graham cracker pie crust aroma...nice balance of pumpkin pie spices and a certain creaminess. A little heavier on the spices in the flavor, but not overly so. Again, sweet pumpkin pie, crust and all, this time with a little booze and a mild bitterness. Medium bodied and slightly creamy. A very dessert-like pumpkin ale."
"Burnt orange in color with a full head that retained well and left sticky lacing on my snifter. Spices are in the front and hit my taste buds hard. It certainly tastes like pumpkin pie in a bottle and stands up well with a hearty meal. This continues to be my favorite pumpkin beer."
"Glad to have tried and and will be looking for another one for this season."
"This is without question the best pumpkin beer that I have had to date. The beer manages to feature distinct pumpkin character that doesn't seem synthetic. Some might find the spices too overpowering, but I enjoy my pumpkin with a great deal of nutmeg; thus, I find that the beer achieves this. The biscuit-like bready-ness of the malt is also outstanding."
"O: I didn't enjoy this beer at all. The pumpkin and the sweetness were up front and center with this beer, which is obviously what they were shooting for. I enjoy many fruit beers, but the pumpkin was just so overpowering for me that it turned me off."
"It was sickeningly sweet, overly thick, and tasted like a pumpkin pie instead of a beer brewed with pumpkin. I was worried when I took a sniff and it smelled like dessert time on Thanksgiving... I was not pleased when it tasted like pie and had such a heavy thickness to it either. Give the Dogfish punkin a shot for a great example of the style."
"O: Easily the best pumpkin beer I've had, none of that artificial flavor going on. Couldn't drink it all day, but then again that's why it's release for this season only. Solid brew."
"Overall I used to really enjoy this beer but for my current tastes this is a bit too sweet for my liking. Used to be a top 3 pumpkin beer for me but falls way down the list compared to Weyerbacher and much lesser ABV examples like Smuttynose."
"O: Great pumpkin ale. I've had this before my palate really developed and I didn't like it. Glad I retried it, it's definitely a top notch pumpkin beer. Literally a fermented pumpkin pie. If anything I would say that the pumpkin is a tad bit overwhelmed by all the spices but it's still great."
"o - remember crocodile dundee, when he says that's not a knife..THIS is a knife? well, that's not a pumpkin beer, THIS is a pumpkin beer. like most of what i've had from southern tier, this is a style to the max. extreme pumpkin beer."
"A very good pumpkin ale, but I found I liked Weyerbacher's Imperial, which is spicier, just a titch more."
"Definitly a good take on pumpkin beers."
"O: An okay pumpkin beer but not the best I've had. It certainly is the most unique and one that I'll probably seek out once a year for a check-in to see how much better it was the year before ;)"
"Overall probably one of my favorite pumpkin beers next to screaming pumpkin. Although as an Imperial I was hoping to have more of a body. It was pretty balanced between hops, malts, and pumpkin. Glad the spices weren't too overpowering."
"Overall, this is a good beer and very drinkable. Not my favorite pumpkin ale but a good representation of the style."
"D: For me, who prefers sessionable beers, this is a sipper that I will enjoy over an evening, or a brew session.. like I am now."
"Overall: Very disappointing. Officially the worst pumpkin beer I've ever had. Even if I weren't expecting pumpkin pie spices, still a very disappointing beer."
"I really like this stuff, it's a perfect dessert beer. I will definitely pick this up again, and I may not even wait until next year. Highly recommended."
"Overall- O.K.! This is the big one, this brew is something I would drink every single day of the Fall. Somehow, they managed to capture the magic of a North-East Autumn. I've had a few pumpkin beers and this has to be the best. This beer is insane."
"Yet, it's a good fall beer."
"O: This is a very good pumpkin beer. The malts really make this one really unique in that I can literally taste the pie crust and the spices are kept in check. I have never been into the style, but this year it is slowly rubbing off on me!"
"It's not my favourite pumpkin ale, but is is certainly one of the better entries in the genre. Paired well with chicken stew, cheese danishes, pumpkin pie and vanilla ice cream in my experience."
"Poured a deep amber; clear, with a thick ring that stuck around. Smell is a glorious offering of pie-in-the-oven. Taste is superlative, simply an almost-perfect rendition of the home-made pumpkin pie I grew up eating. Mostly cinnamon for the spice, with gobs of pure, round pumpkin. Finish is a bit hot (suitable for a pie), but the abv is still masked well. Fantastic pumpkin ale. I don't think this one can be beat, by my taste buds."
"Verdict: A stunning seasonal beer and probably my favorite seasonal beer of any season. It is quite literally a slice of pumpkin pie in a glass that brings together all the best parts of fall."
"2014 update: Saw the newly designed bottles of Pumking at my favorite bottle shop on July 19th of all things! I simply despise the fact that fall offerings such as Pumking are available so early but I could not resist purchasing a bottle and consuming it super fresh. The flavor profile of the 2014 version is very bright – more so than the past few years. The alcohol was kept in check nicely, as well. This is the best version in at least 4 years."
"I have to say I was a bit disappointed after reading all the hype of this pumpkin ale. I bought 3 bottles and have 2 left but the best way I could describe this beer is that it was like drinking liquid potpourri. The beer did pour nice and had a pumpkin smell. At first I could taste pumpkin pie but once the beer warmed up, the taste went south. Im interested to see if the other 2 bottles I have react the same."
"O - This is a good beer if you're looking for something that resembles pumpkin pie, especially in the sweetness department. I definitely enjoyed it, although a bomber is a bit too big. Share it with a friend!"
"O-This is a decent beer. It may be a bit of a gimmick, but it is much tastier than many pumpkin ales that show up in the fall. The primary issue I find with this beer is that I am not sure when I would want to drink it. It's too spicy to take the place of a lager/hefeweizen, but also doesn't seem like it would scratch that pale ale itch or go well with most food. Effectively, to me, this is an unabashed gimmick beer designed to be consumed at the Thanksgiving table and nowhere else, and for that purpose, it is quite good."
"The more I drink it though the pumpkin comes out more and it becomes more well rounded. Definitely that initial reaction of full on gingerbread cookie spice is a bit overwhelming. Its good that now on my second glass from the bomber that I finally pick out the pumpkin taste which is definitely there but can be looked passed if you only have 1 glass of this. Definitely have more than one and you can taste cinnamon, nutmeg and real pumpkin a lot more. Definitely a unique rich and tasty beer for Halloween."
"Overall - I was disappointed in this, as was my wife, who had been looking forward to this one. I still haven't found one better than Good Gourd. Love that creaminess and true pumpkin flavors and this one lacks both in the taste. In aroma it can't be beat, though."
"Overall-A great pumpkin beer, but can be a little overpowering at times. The 2011 batch is better than last year's for sure."
"O: This is the best pumpkin ale I've ever had. Before this, my fav was Post Road Pumpkin Ale: http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/45/74"
"O) I haven't really had many pumpkin beers, but I've heard good things about this one, so I finally gave it a shot. I'm really glad I did. This is one delicious fall brew right here."
"O - Drainpour. Just couldn't drink this one."
"O: Has a great smell, but the lack of carbonation leaves the flavor a little unbalanced."
"O: I like this specific pumpkin ale, it was my first of the style and always a favorite. I really think the butterscotch notes add to the overall pumpkin pie flavor."
"Pours a beautiful clear sunset orange with tons of tiny bubbles rising to the surface. Produced a one finger head that dissipated rather quickly. The smell is unbelievable. Smells like pumpkin pie. Subtle spices and subtle pumpkin on the nose. The taste is similar to the smell, but the pumpkin is more present. This tastes like pumpkin pie. The mouthfeel was thin and watery with medium carbonation. Overall, the best pumpkin beer I have had to date. If I had to nitpick, I would prefer a creamier mouthfeel. I was expecting a malt bomb and a cloyingly sweet beer, but instead I got a perfectly balanced pumpkin ale."
"Do yourself a favor and steer clear of this abomination of beer."
"I would say that for the style this was close, but for me I couldnt stand to finish it....if that makes sense. If you like the pumkin beers try it, but for me, I coulldnt last."
"SkÅL!"
"Mouthfeel and drinkability - medium bodied, moreso than any of the 4 bottles I've had. Pleasant and spicy. Not very carbonated at all. Delicious. The sweetness can get to you after awhile."
"O - Best pumpkin beer I've had. A nice seasonal treat."
"This would totally be sessionable if it weren't so high in ABV, but i'm a one or two strong beer per night drinker so I will no doubt be buying more."
"Overall it's a really good beer, different than most other fall beers I've had. As mentioned, while the spices are there, they don't dominate like in most beers, allowing the actual smell and taste of pumpkin to shine."
"Well worth the $7.89 I paid for it."
"I don’t give a Schlitz for Pumking."
"Still Great, Still the King of the pumpkin Beers, Very subtle differences if any from previous."
"Pours a vibrant orange with a small head. Nice lacing left on the sides of the glass. Smell is mild pumpkin, spice, and more pumpkin. Smells identical to a pumpkin pie coming out of the oven. Initial taste is liquid pumpkin pie and finishes off with a graham crust flavor. It is a amazing how close this beer tastes to an actual pumpkin pie. This beer is very smooth and is bit of a sipper. Nothing I could slam because of how sweet it is. This is a prime example of how a pumpkin ale should be brewed. Great example of a dessert beer."
"O - definitely the king of the pumpkin brews in my opinion - it really is something special"
"O: Just not for me, even though I know lots of people like it. Might give it try if someone offers it to me, but probably won't get another bottle."
"O- its a good beer but its a bit too much for me. I think I would pass on it in the future."
"O: Overall, I do not like this beer. It is one of the few times that I don't really want to finish a beer. Not the worst I've had, but I wouldn't recommend it."
"O-Easily the best pumpkin ale out there. Did the tasting blind, and every one chose beer number nine which turned out to be Pumking. This is the pumpkin ale."
"Mouthfeel: Malt body is full, but not overly chewy. Proper level of carbonation for an imperial-style beer."
"Was in search of a pumpkin beer that tasted like pumpkin, not nutmeg or cinnabon buns. Pumking pours a beautiful, clear garnet, lots of vanilla and nutmeg emanate—no cinnamon. It's basically Pumkin pie with candy corn. Loved every drop and recommend taking at least two bottles at the store, they go fast."
"Again, this is not only my new favorite pumpkin ale, but it now sits as one of my faves from Southern Tier. Nice job on making a style I really don't appreciate into something worth drinking each Fall."
"Pours a clear copper orange color with a lot of carbonation floating to the top of the glass but ceases in about 5-10 seconds as does the head. The scent is like a pumpkin pie with pureed pumpkin, cinnamon spice, and carmel. The taste is the best I've ever had in a pumpkin beer. It's smooth and clean but with lots of flavor. Great tastes of pumpkin and spices that blended nicely togther with the malts and hops used. It's so good I almost want to go grab some cool whip to throw on top! A must try for pumpkin beer lovers!"
"Oof."
"A translucent golden/orange. Foams up a bunch like soap bubbles but quickly just becomes some small puddles. A lot of carbonation running up the sides. Aroma has notes of nutmeg, fresh cut pumpkin and dough. Flavor is crisp upfront with a lot of nutmeg and cinnamon. Buttery smooth, doughey pie middle that leaves. The pumpkin flavor carries throughout the middle and finish and it leaves a crisp bite. Part of it from the carbonation and the spices. Body is light for a lot of pumpkins out there and all the flavors are subtle but you know they are there. The alcohol content is a surprise."
"O: one of the better pumpkin ales I have tried and worth the effort finding it. Its really stands out for two reasons. One, the ingredients are high quality and you can tell in the flavor. Two, despite the heavy graham and pumpkin, you never lose the fact that this is indeed a beer. Well done."
"O - Another big ST beer, another winner. One of the top pumpkin beers out there. I look forward to this every fall."
"It's like drinking a boozy slice of pumpkin pie!"
"O- Best pumpkin beer (so far) of the '11 season! I hope to recreate THIS beer in my first homebrew. Graham cracker flavor is the key; we're going to use graham cracker flavoring in the second rack."
"O: This beer is exactly what I anticipated it would be, that being said - I don't dislike it, but do not subscribe as fervently as many in the forums do. It's good, about as good as every beer in the Black Water series - it's literally well done, but nothing more."
"I poured this beer from a 22oz. bottle into a pint glass. It has a great orange color body, with not a lot of head. The smell is of graham cracker, vanilla and spices. The taste first is like a pie crust, pumpkin, spices and malt. The mouth feel is nice and smooth and crisp. Overall this is the best pumpkin beer i have had so far."
"O: Well done Southern Tier. I'd love more of this but Total Wine has just recently sold out. Pumking is a beer I will continue to seek out every autumn."
"O: I was quite surprised when I discovered I actually didn't like something that ST made, but I can't get over the creamy/biscuity/bready taste. My favorite pumpkin ale is still smashed pumpkins, though, with punkin a close second."
"O: This beer is the best pumpkin beer I've had and one of the top 5 overall beers I've ever had. The Schlafly was really good, but this is the one against which all pumpkin beers are measured. Drink carefully though. It tastes good enough to slug down, but it is still a 9% ABV brew. Cant wait to revisit this one!"
"Probably my favorite pumpkin beer so far. Smelled delicious, tasted like nutmeg cinnamon pumpkin cake, and looked like fall poured into a glass. A beautiful orange color with an off yellow foamy head. I love this brewing company and will definatly have another if my local shop gets more. Drink next to fire with a dog at your feet."
"Overall this is a decent tasting brew that is at least different, and I would like to try some more Pumpkin Ales. I think this one could be better, but I don't really know how (maybe some aroma hops). Cheers!"
"I first had this at the Lundeen's Brew-Ha-Ha!!! yesterday and was upset to see it gone a few minutes later. Damn fine purchase though and I suggest it if you like pumpkins in your beer!"
"Another great pumpkin ale in life. Poured into a snifter, a nice orange-amber with just a slight haze, bubbly with a patchy layer of white bubbles for a head. Truly amazing aroma of ginger snaps and pumpkin pie...not subtle, but full of pleasant aromatic pumpkin and spice, just like it's supposed to be. Taste was not quite as tremendous, but still very good. The flavors were a bit more subdued than the aroma, which is just fine. A sweet malt base with a background of soft pumpkin, overlaid with vanilla, spice, and cinnamony pie crust. Gentle hop bitterness and alcohol warnth in the finish. Medium body, and very drinkable."
"Overall, a really out there pumpkin beer. Sweet and delicious, full of pumpkin spice. May have to pick up a few more of these this fall."
"Had this for the first time amongst a little pumpkin ale taste comparison at home. This beer is in a league of its own... The color is a clear golden orange, with a tiny head with no retention. The aroma is incredible - it's hard to believe how it truly smells like pumpkin cake, vanilla icing and all, gingerbread, graham cracker, cinnamon, etc. The taste is very similar to the aroma with a light hop finish and medium mouth feel. The alcohol is masked VERY well. How exactly do they make a beer that tastes this way? Does Willy Wonka work at Southern Tier? Truly incredible. I def. will be buying more this season. I could drink this for breakfast! In all seriousness though, this is a dessert in a glass. The only question is - is a beer supposed to even be like this? It doesn't really taste like a beer... I suppose that's what the other pumpkin ales are for."
"Until that happens, it's just the prince."
"O - Overall, this is a nice pumpkin ale. Probably like DFH Punkin better but this is a nice change of pace."
"I recall, many year ago, having one of my first pumpkin ales, and being absolutly blown away. Each fall, I seem to stock up on various pumpkin flavored beers, eagerly searching for a similar experience. Each year, however, I seem be disappointed. Until, that is, my wife bought this beer for me. Wow. Hands down, this is the best pumpkin ale that I've ever had. It's aroma is exceptional, intense, and enchanting. The flavor is rich, layered, and nearly overwhelming. Pumpkin and spice, strength in alcohol, some malt, and near perfect balance. It does not seem at all artificial, a fault of many pumpkin beers. It's a dangerous beer, with it's high ABV, but it is also very rewarding. Great stuff."
"This is pretty much what I want in a pumpkin ale. Subtle is sometimes nice, but I also enjoy drinking a pumpkin pie from time to time."
"Outstanding brew, dessert in a bottle. One of the best pumpkin beers there is in my opinion and really worth grabbing when you see it. If you aren't into pumpkin beers, this might be the one that changes your mind."
"Pours a medium orange with a white head that fades fast. Smells like a pumpkin candle, sweet with obvious pumpkin. Small spice notes in there as well. The taste follows suit, the spice is higher in the flavor, huge pumpkin flavors up front with the ABV not hidden at all. Spice of cinnamon, vanilla, nutmeg, and a hint of clove. The mouthfeel isn't as smooth as expected, and the alcohol is somewhat harsh. Overall a very pumpkin beer, powerful flavor that could turn some away. The spices are the main focus, and are done well. A nice fall beer, could be a desert beer due to the sweetness."
"O: A bizarre beer but not bad. That big buttery note is fatiguing on the palate."
"this beer pours a really nice gold color. The smell is very complex, I'm detecting a surprising amount of vanilla, ginger and molassis. The taste hoppy at first but that quickly passes and leaves a really nice mix of vanilla, pumpkin and spices behind. This beer has one of the best after tastes I have ever tasted. I am sad that I just grabbed one of these... I need to go back and get some more."
"O- My 1st attempt at a pumpkin beer. It was good but wasn't amazing for me. My wife and split a bomber and she thought the same thing. I will be trying more pumpkin beers in the future, I may just need to try more to develop a palatte for this style of brew."
"Overall (4.0): Full disclosure: I am not into pumpkin beers. They’re not my style. But, I appreciate diversity and wanted to take notes on a well-regarded one, and I can see what people like about it—I just don’t care for too many spices in my beer. I actually would’ve liked to see more pumpkin in this beer! Frankly, this is less of a “pumpkin ale” and more of a “pie ale.”"
"O- Liked the 2 bottles I had this year more than Pumking on tap. For some reason on tap the spices were even more pronounced and almost too much! Still the best pumpkin beer out there though."
"This would have been a great beer... if it didn't taste so artificially sweet. I don't know, it had a bunch of flavor, which I liked, but had some sort of too sweet, too artificial taste to it. I want something that tastes like brewed pumpkin, not brewed pumpkin loaded with splenda."
"Can't recommend this enough."
"Overall this is one of my favorite beers for the fall season. I would recommend this to anyone interested in trying a pumpkin beer. I am a fan of pumpkin beers and have tried many and ever since my first """Pumking""" it's been hard to find another brew that compares. I'd say the weyerbacher gives it some competition but this still takes the cake for me. I'd love to try one of the Elysian pumpkin brews but I haven't been able to find it here in good ol' Connecticut."
"Too many pumpkin ales are OVERSPICED. Not here...a well controlled, yet large beer that fits perfect for the season. Big fan, and I feel better about this beer now...curious if anyone else feels really let down about last years batch. Just thought it was bad!"
"For my records: Purchased 9/21 at PLW."
"Damn tasty and like nothing I've ever had before. Highly recommended for a new take on a pumpkin. Given the sweetness, robably only enjoyable once a year though."
"Great pumpkin and darker confection sweetness in this one, with a nice spicy finish. Been wanting to try this one for as long as I remember and glad Southern Tier finally started to distribute here in the last year or so."
"Update: I really loved this beer, however the second glass after dinner was horrific, it was almost impossible to get down. This is definitely a dessert beer, despite the word on the street. I did not take away any points from the score because the first glass went down smooth. Cheers!"
"O: B+"
"This is the best pumpkin beer that I have had so far. Most remind me of a light beer with some pumpkin pie spice sprinkled on. Great brew with lots of flavor."
"2011 bottle poured into duvel tulip. Aggressive pour yielded no head, some remnant bubbles. Very wonderful orange. Nose is fruit cake, candy corn, pumpkin mash, clove/assorted spices/gingerbread. Taste is sweet; candied ginger, candy corn, brown sugar pumpkin pie. Mouthfeel is good, low carb goes well with the sweetness and complex flavor. Overall, im surprised it was this complex. I've been going thru a few different pumpkin beers this season and southern tier definetely stands out with this one."
"Overall - its a f***ing amazing beer. Amazing and unique on all levels."
"I don't have lots of points of reference on pumpkin ales, but this one tastes pretty good. Wouldn't order more than one at a sitting, but can't say there's anything wrong with it at all."
"My only complaint was that it reminded me more of christmas than halloween since the pumpkin taste was faint and the ginger bread cookie taste was so strong"
"O - VERY DISAPPOINTING! Up until this brew, I really enjoyed ST... Not too sure I'll be hunting their others, after this one... Drain pour."
"It pours a nice light copper/orange color and the aroma almost hits you immediately. Smells of pumpkin pie. Cloves, Nutmeg, pumpkin, vanilla, etc. When you take the first sip its like a punch to your taste buds. First time I had this beer I wasn't ready for how pleasant it would taste. I actually did throw some random punches after taking my first sip. Once again, Awesome! This beer is a must try for any pumpkin beer fans out there."
"Taking this down a little bit. The vanilla grew cloying after a while, began to taste the way vanilla-scented candle wax smells."
"Overall: This is a pumpkin beer but to a ridiculous level. It's unlike any pumpkin beer you've had. You don't want a ton of this, but you MUST experience it."
"Too often, pumpkin ale is the flavored coffee of the beer world, and this one was certainly not an exception to that rule. Far too much pie spice--cinnamon, cloves, etc.--drowning out everything else. Hard to tell if I was tasting any pumpkin at all or just the spices. Also a sweetness that I found cloying, though it really wasn't very sweet--again, exacerbated by the excessive spicing. A pretty beer, beautiful pumpkin color, but ... pretty only gets you so far."
"O-I really wanted to like this beer.I really did but in the end it was a serious disappointment.At one point,I would've swore I was drinking Killians Irish Red."
"O- this is most likely the best pumpkin beer I've had. It's not for the sugar-wary though, but if you have a sweet tooth, (I usually don't) this is a perfect beer for you. Got a gf/bf who doesn't like beer? Let them give this a try."
"Overall Drinkability - Decent novelty beer. Wouldn't get again."
"Pours an interesting orange color with sharp clarity. Nose is very reminiscent of pumpkin pie. Lots of inviting spice notes and a bit of graham cracker. Palate is very spiced up with a fair amount of sweetness. Cinnamon and nutmeg compliment sweet and bready malts. Mouthfeel is fluid and light on the tongue. In small doses, this is pretty tasty but the bold spices can wear down the taste buds rather quickly."
"Overall - Probably my 2nd favorite pumpkin beer behind Schlafly (which I was disappointed in this year's effort). Unique in terms of the 'pie crust' character that this one employs. Another great Southern Tier brew."
"Overall – Not my favorite pumpkin beer by a long shot. Too sweet and artificial. Give me my DFH Punkin!"
"Overall - This was my first pumkin ale, and I was blown away by the flavor, I totally get pumkin"""g"" pie from this. I would not want this year around, but it is a great change of pace, and I look forward to enjoying this annually from now on. Try Pumking if you haven't yet."
"Tastes like fall, but in a way I wasn't expecting. Works far better than most other attempts at the Pumpkin Ale style. In fact, it just might be my favorite. Would pair beautifully with Autumn desserts."
"For me, Southern Tier is hit or miss. This one is actually very good. First off the smell on this one is amazing. I smell vanilla, nutmeg, clove and of course pumpkin. Oh yeah and cinnamon. The head was small and dissipated quickly. The taste is cinnamon upfront followed by pumpkin. The alcohol is there, but it is fairly well hidden. One of the better pumpkin ales I've had but not the best. That distinction falls to schlafly's pumpkin ale. Still, if you don't fall within the states that Schlaflys distributes to, this is a good second."
"O: Overall not a bad pumpkin beer at all, although it's not my favorite style, I would drink this again and again."
"O -- this is one seasonal pumpkin beer I look forward to each year, and I was not disappointed. This beer is definitely a sipper for me as I enjoy the meld of flavors that develop after each sip. Definitely one of the more complex tasting pumpkin beers (not all spice up front). Compared to previous years, this one seems a bit more heavy on vanilla and a little more creamy in mouthfeel, but overall an awesome beer (if you can find it)."
"It's a transparent amber-orange color with no head or lacing. A few streams of carbonation bubble to the top. I smell pumpkins, cinnamon, nutmeg, and creamed corn? I taste pumpkin and cinnamon, and thankfully, no creamed corn. The sweetness is well balanced with the pumpkin spices. It has a medium body and I think it could be carbonated a little more. Alcohol, at 8%, is hidden nicely. I may get it once a year just to have during the season. I'll have to try other pumpkin ales to have get some perspective on the style. Overall, good, but not overly impressed."
"O- Simply outstanding... and that's all I have to say about that!"
"The smell is magnificent; unfortunately the appearance and taste don't quite stack up to the expectation it sets."
"o- not as thick as other pumpkin ales i have had, its decent. i am not into pumpkin beers, but because this one is from southern tier thought i would give it a try. its good, but not one i would buy again just because i am not into the whole pumpkin thing."
"Overall this is a solid pumpkin beer that is great for drinking on a cold fall day."
"so far this is a pretty good beer but i think i prefer it a little thicker in taste and mouthfeel more like Hoppin' Frogs which i think is my favorite pumpkin this season. but, it is only halfway through september."
"First tried at the brewery prior to 2011 release. Good then and good now. I'm not a fan of flavored beer but it seems appropriate to enjoy this one in anticipation of the fall. I've tried several pumpkin brews but like this one the best. It has the sweet qualities present in many of ST Imperials ... and pushes the pumpkin flavor and color forward better than any other product I've sampled."
"O: Pretty decent Pumpkin Ale with most of the common ingredients and flavors. This one doesn't seem to be overly spiced like others but is very sweet. Not my favorite for the style but I can definitely see why it is for others."
"I finally managed to get my grubby hands on this beer. After reading so many rave reviews, I am happy to report that it did not disappoint in the slightest. For me, every pumpkin beer I drink will be compared to Schlafly's (my personal favorite). This one, while not as good as Schlafly's in my opinion, was good enough and different enough to make me want to pick up a few more bottles. I'm saving one for Halloween night. Boo!"
"This is the best pumpkin beer Ive had to date."
"On the thin side but good pumpkin/spice/booze balance."
"Overall - This blew me away, I have to find more of this beer!"
"O: Drinkability is not high, but overall this was good. 22oz bottle was a bit too much though."
"O - I'm struggling to understand why so many people rate this highly. I was really hoping to like it since it's readily available here, but after trying a really great example of the style (CCB Good Gourd) recently, this is almost offensively bad. I even checked with the store - it's this year's release. What a huge letdown."
"Overall - One of the best pumpkins I've had. It's very very good. Not at all what I expected actually, but I think this pumpkin has so much balance. Very well done."
"O: A solid pumpkin beer but could have been better."
"O: Still my favorite pumpkin beer. Definitely affordable for what you get. A tasteful use of pumpkin and spice, but with a different take on the style, than what I've seen. At least compared to the 14 or so commercial examples that I have access to here in Maine."
"O - This was certainly worth the wait! Probably the best Pumpkin beer I've ever had, I can't wait to get more of this!"
"O: WOW! Amazing beer. Been waiting to try this one. Not disappointed at all. If you are thinking about trying Punmpkin ales or intrigued by the style, then give this a shot."
"O- overall, this is a fantastic representation of the style. On draft, I cn say this is the best pumpkin ale I have ever tasted."
"All in all, Pumking fits into the second tier of my patented Pumpkin Beer Hierarchy next to DFH Punkin' and above the Weyerbacher. The top tier remains static: Frog's Hollow Imperial Pumpkin Ale by Hoppin Frog, and Devious Imperial Pumpkin by Bethlehem Brew Works."
"I think this year's version is much better than last year. Not my favorite pumpkin beer, but a solid competitor."
"An automatic F."
"O- It's just not fall until you have a Pumking. I don't like a lot of ST's brews but I can't go without this one. Always a treat. This re-review has me raising my old score- this one's a winner."
"I am very disappointed but I see others like it. That is fine but not the beer that is says on the bottle. This is awesome beer for the winter just needs a little more malty taste. Cheers!"
"O: I really enjoyed this. Not too sweet and it really gave the feel of drinking a pumpkin pie. I need more."
"Regarding the actual 'drinkability', when I had this on tap last winter, it was served in 11oz portions, and rightfully so. This is definitely a sip + enjoy, so share that big bottle with someone."
"This is a powerful pumpkin ale, just as you'd expect from Southern Tier. My friends and I describe it to newcomers as tossing a pumpkin pie in a blender and hitting puree. It's very spicy and very sweet, not to mention somewhat strong too as far as pumpkin ales go. IMHO, one of those beers you pour in a glass and enjoy slowly like a port wine. Definitely something to try if you are in to pumpkin brews."
"It finishes with brown sugar sweetness and a little cinnomon and some other dry spices that I can't put my finger on. The sweet and spicyness leave a great aftertaste."
"O - Not that great of a pumpkin beer. Treat and Schlafly Pumpkin blow this one out of the water. I would pass on this if offered again. Not recommended."
"Carbonation is moderately lively. Crisper and more refreshing than I'd anticipated. Finishes surprisingly dry, without too much lingering and no cloying. This is a fairly unsweet beer for Southern Tier, although it is sweeter than many other pumpkin beers. Definitely one you need to try if you're into this style."
"Flavor is sugary. It just isnt great. The pumkin is fine but it is over-spiced and over-sweet. Candy corn mixed with pumpkin pie comes to mind. Hilarious that this is considered the pinnacle of this style. The hops also just really dont work here."
"O- I now see why this is the quintessential pumpkin beer and very glad I tried it. This beer is great, not too much spice and not too much sweetness but still big on flavor. Every pumpkin beer I have had is too rich or not flavorful enough, too thin or heavy in body, but this beer strikes the perfect balance."
"Truly, this is one of the best pumpkin ales of all time. If you're really in a mood to travel to pumpkinland this is arguably the #1 choice. I'd rate Dogfish Head's Punkin Ale at a close #2 (easier to casually down 1 or 2 of those whereas this you really need to be in the zone to take on a Pumking bomber). Punkin Ale edges out Pumking in the spice department, but Pumking takes the cake in true pumpkin pie flavor. I've had the opportunity to try several other pumpkin ales already this fall, and all were fairly decent (Smuttynose's offering probably being the best out of that batch). Where do I start with Pumking? This is not for the fainthearted first of all. This is a thick, strong concoction that will leave you feeling like you just devoured the tastiest pumpkin pie of all time. It has a good balance of spices and a thick layer of caramel. The pumpkin taste is perfect and the ABV on this bomber is 8.6% so you WILL be buzzed if you are a lightweight. Drink responsibly. The guy that orders for my area in metro Chicago failed to order these last year and I had to order them (at a high price) from a couple stores out East. This time they are not playing around, and DiCarlo's up in Mundelein managed to get like 20 cases. Let's send Southern Tier a message that this is a hit (much like Punkin Ale), and have them ship more of these bad boys out here ASAP! Cheers to all, and may you all enjoy this wonderful fall season, arguably the best time of year for beer aficionados."
"Pumpkin Ale Pours a golden amber color, with a decent size white head. The smell is strongly like pumpkin, some spices, very similar to pumkin pie. The taste is strongly similar to pumkin pie, creamy, lots of pumkins flavors, a bit of cinimmon. Good strong flavor, very nice on the palette. Overall a fantastic pumpkin ale, almost as good as dogfish head."
"Pours an orange color w/ a bubbly thin off white head. Good carbonation, not much in the way of lacing. Beer is very clear, and easy to see through. Nose is fantastic, although a little sweet for my taste. Pumpkin, caramel, gingerbread, vanilla. If I closed my eyes I would swear I was smelling a piece of pumpkin pie. Taste is fairly close to the nose, but the spices (nutmeg, cinnamon) come out a little more, along w/ some malt. The taste is not quite up to the level of the nose, but it's pretty close. Still, a 4 is all I can give this category. Feel is medium, and very sweet, but it goes down smooth just the same. Very nice. Just a little on the sweet side for me. Finishes fairly wet, with a nice chestnut/nutmeg/pumpkin/cinnamon aftertaste. Overall, this is definitely a different animal than the other Pumpkin Ales I've tried. It's like literally eating and smelling a piece of pumpkin pie. You can even smell and taste the little burned areas of the graham cracker crust... Nice- I enjoyed this one. Cheers."
"O: First off, this may just be my favorite seasonal beer. It is a flavor-packed and interesting pour. The beer's only trait that may hinder on people is the amount of spice and sweetness packed into it. Overall, a great pumpkin ale."
"Thanks to merc7186 for this one"
"O- I've had this now for the last two years and think this is my favorite pumpkin ale I've had. Just a huge amount of pumpkin pie in the aroma and taste."
"While a bit early for the Puca, as All Hallows Eve still blows in the wind for a few nights. We tried this bomber to welcome in coming of the Autumnal Equinox. It appears off-amber like a leaf two weeks before dropping onto the front lawn. It smells like mama's kitchen in late November around 4:47 p.m. just before the """pumking""" pie comes out of the oven. The rooty pumpkin flavors are abundant but not overwhelming, as they are balanced with nutmeg, clove and caramel, just like mama's pie. Puca indeed carried us on the journey of our lives, forever changed!"
"Overall its a great beer and one that I would look forward to enjoying once or twice per season."
"The rest will either be dumped or used for some kind of cooking. Maybe a brine?"
"O: Sweet and underattenuated, but it works. 4.5"
"This is exactly how an imperial pumpkin ale should smell, taste and feel. Loaded with spices and sweet caramel malt while maintaining good balance and drinkability. This is definitely worth seeking out if you're a pumpkin or looking to get in the mood for autumn."
"Absolutely, delicious despite my critiques. Top notch. DFH's Punkin did better on the spice blend. There is a lingering bitterness from hops and spice aftertaste. Overall, an awesome beer. The dry finish actually makes this more drinkable than their other rich dessert beers. I think I can drink this one alone."
"This is the best pumpkin ale I've had, although the list is admittedly short. I don't intend on drinking too many more of these this year, but I will sure as hell be picking some of it up again next year."
"Impeccable shot at imperializing an autumn classic. Smells unlike any pumpkin beer out there. Overall very creative, and delicious. A hair away from being 5s across the board."
"O - Great pumpkin beer with amazing pumpkin flavor. It can totally be seen like eating a piece of pumpkin pie. Great fall beer. Though with the amount of cinnamon I probably would only have 1 (1 being at least a 22oz bomber). Well done Southern Tier."
"big thanks to mjtiernan for sending this out in a trade. poured from bottle into a pint glass. color is a shade of copper with amber highlights, pretty clear with a half finger head that disappears rather quickly leaving no lacing and the beer looking flat. smell is of sugar and spice and everything nice. taste has cinnamon, sugar, graham cracker crust, hint of allspice and booze is well hidden. mouthfeel is a little thin but with all the flavor you dont notice it as much. overall a very good and very sweeet beer. now if only they could figure out to put a big head on it, it would be like having whipped topping on my pie!"
"Well I think this beer needs to be renamed pumpkin pie, but it delivers what it says. My only thinking though, is that it seems so blatantly obvious I wonder if this has artificial flavoring in it??? Crazy!"
"O - This has good drinkability. it goes down easy, and it has a very nice and interesting flavor. This is definitely one of the more bold pumpkin beers that are out there. Also, I thought that this has more of the actual pumpkin flavor versus fall spices, which a lot of other pumpkin beers focus on I feel like. Overall, I think this is a great beer, and it is perfect for this season. If you are into pumpkin beers, or trying them out, this one is a must have."
"Might be the best pumpkin beer I've had."
"Overall I believe this beer is a little too hyped up. It is kind of a novelty, but it has too many flaws in my eyes to consider buying it again."
"Pumpkin pie orange in color with a light haze. Poured with a short foamy white head that slowly dissipated. Sweet pumpkin pie-like aroma with cinnamon, brown sugar, rum-like sweetness, nutmeg, and spice. Light bodied with a buttery smooth oily feel. Sweet malty, pumpkin flavor from beginning to end. This is literally like drinking pumpkin pie....without the whipped cream. Texture thins at the finish, unmasking the higher abv, but the cinnamon and spice subdue the alcoholic heat. A truly unique and noteworthy pumpkin ale."
"Overall. This would be a perfect beer to split amongst friends or family while enjoying dinner or some pumpkin pie."
"Overall it's on of the better pumpkin beers I've tried."
"O-One of my favorite fall beers. has great flavor and aroma"
"O: I'd heard a lot of good things about the Pumking and perhaps had inflated expectations. It's radically different from any other pumpkin beer I have had which makes me recommend it on that alone. That being said, it's boozy and imbalanced. Is it bad? No. Is it the best pumpkin beer I've had even today? Not even close."
" ~ This is a once a year brew for a reason. I don't think more than one of these bad boys is gonna be on my fall list. That being said, it's very unique and it's nice to try something new every one in a while."
"O - This is a fantastic beer and lives up to its name. I've had this beer numerous times in the past and can't believe I haven't reviewed it until now. (???!!!!) This is a well known selection from Southern Tier (one of my favorite brewers) and definitely an assertive beer for the style. This one garners a love/hate reaction from people because we all know that's the reputation of pumpkin ales, you either love them, or you hate them. The gap between the two may be a little wider for this one since it's so bold. I always look forward to its release each year."
"O - man i love this beer. boozy pumpkin pie in a glass. yum."
"I really enjoyed this one. As far as pumpkin beers go, this is probably the best I've had."
"Overall, I've only had a handful of pumpkin beers in the past, but this one is among the best."
"I poured from a bomber into a snifter, clear orange pour with minimal head. The aroma is strong pumpkin pie spices. The pumpkin pie spice is prominant, vanilla, and of course pumkin. It finishes with sweet pumkin. The body is light, low carbonation, no hint of alcohol. While I am not a fan of Pumpkin beers, this dissapointed me. There have been a ton of threads about how great this beer was, but sadly it did not work for me."
"I like this beer for what it reminds me of, cool weather fall surrounded by changing colored leaves. You can't expect to drink a fall beer without strong spices of the season. I'd recommend this beer to friends for sure."
"...and after trying other pumpkin ales all season, I'd rank Pumking as tied for my favorite with Smashed Pumpkin; and followed by Heavy Seas Greater Pumpkin and Punkin."
"Overall, I was pretty disappointed. Lots of people told me this was the best pumpkin beer out there, so I had to try it. I guess I'll add this to my """way overhyped""" beers. Just tasted artificial and overspiced to me. I'd like to see a much more balanced beer."
"Most of the other pumpkin beers tasted seemed to taste mostly like beer with a hint of pumpkin or spice. This felt like it delivered, and certainly lives up to its name as the Pumking."
"overall i was quite impressed with this. extremely tasty and well balanced."
"Quite a spicy beer that's taste is almost over the top, but maintains decent drinkability. For me this is a once a season beer and again I'm glad that I split the bomber. Not my favorite style, but I appreciate the creativity involved in this brew."
"Pours a clear light copper orange with a 1 inch fizzy orange-white head that fades to an oily film on the top of the beer. No lacing on this one on the drink down. Kind of a disappointing appearance. Smell is very complex with caramel malt, biscuits, actual pumpkin puree, and a wide array of pumpkin pie spices - cinnamon, clove, nutmeg. Taste is of malt/bread/biscuit/crust, unsweetened pumpkin puree, brown sugar, and the aforementioned spices. There is a slight spice bitterness that sticks the the tongue after each sip. This beer has a higher level of carbonation with a crisp and dry finish. Overall, this is a good pumpkin ale that is somewhat different that I was expecting. I was thinking that this could be a creamy, sweet pumpkin milkshake of a beer but I like this one as it is."
"i do have to say it does have a very nice appearance and potent smell of october or halloween"
"I do not know why I continue to take enormous gulps, my lips are all sticky and I think the alcohol is going to my head. I recommend this beer to the person who wants to get drunk ASAP and is dressed in a Halloween costume"
"O: I've shared this beer with enough people to know that it is generally well regarded, even though it it not my thing. My preference would be to back off on the spices and let that rich, smooth and sweet base beer shine through a bit more, and then to further move the spice character away from nutmeg and more towards ginger and vanilla. But it is a lovely beer and strong enough to be a sipper to share with several others (especially packaged in a 22 oz bomber)."
"Very warming boozy quality with an overly-carbonated, soda feel to it. A nice fuller bodied beer that can use with less carbonation. My ride with Púca, short. His advice, to try the other pumpkins out there."
"Pours a very transparent copper orange color that had carbonation throughout drinking it. One and a half finger head that didnt last long and didnt leave much lacing. When i smelled it nutmeg was the most dominate scent, then cinnomin, then alcohol. When I took a sip I tasted cinnomin first however, followed by malt, nutmeg, and and unpleasing alcoholic aftertaste. Thick and dry mouthfeel. This is a good pumpkin beer, but to be honest I was expecting a lot more. I will be buying it again, but at $10 a bottle at my local store im going to be sticking with dogfish head punkin ale through most of this fall."
"O - If someone asked would I drink this again, my answer would be yes, cause it """was""" a decent beer. But I would say no, if I were looking for a """pumpkin""" flavored beer with that """wow""" factor."
"Overall: One of the most memorable beers I've ever had. Such a distinct yummy taste, One of the best seasonals I've ever had and I would definitely try again and plan on doing it soon! Best pumkin beer I've ever had."
"this is a modest pumpkin beer. it is as much a beer as it is about pumpkins. i wonder what a beer would be like with a more aggressive pumpkin flavor??"
"This one I will have again. Very unique smell for me....which ended up being a cross between eggnog and graham crackers. Not too sweet. Wouldn't drink more than one."
"Overall: Crazy good, I must say. Kudo's to Southern Tier. A perfect option for a chilly September/October night."
"This was my first time having Pumking, and I was really impressed. It's really competing with DfH's Punkin and Weyerbacher's Imperial Pumpkin for first place in the pumpkin ale category for me. I'll definitely be seeking this one out again."
"Picked this up at Julio's today, been looking up to this one for so long, not exactly what expected. Pours a coppery, dull orange that I have never seen in any other beer. A lack of head and lacing bring the appearance down a bit. Smells and tastes of an EXTREMELY strong pumpkin and spice, it is a bit too much for me personally but that is personal taste, it definitely lives up to the pumpkin taste and style though. It literally tastes and smells of a yankee candle pumpkin candle with a bit of malts and tiny hops, certainly dominated by pumpkin spice though. A bit too much nutmeg and sweetness in here for me. Mouthfeel is good here, the lack of head is deceiving because the beer is nicely carbonated with a creamy medium body. Drinkability brings in my personal taste here, I could not stand this taste for more than one glass of this, it is overwhelming for me. If you like pumpkin and spice than this is for you, it was not for me as much as I thought it would be."
"This was an interesting brew. I loved the color of this, first and foremost. It was a beautiful hazy orange with a thin white crown. The nose was unbelievable. This is SUCH a fragrant beer. You get the pumpkin, the spice, everything. In your face. I split this bottle with a friend, and it took me half of my glass to wrap my head around what was going on with this. This actually tasted like pumpkin. While it had the a lot of the spiciness typical of this type of beer, this was just different than anything else. Sort of a pumpkin pie thing going. It was definitely on the sweeter side. The alcohol is nowhere to be found on this. This feels great in your mouth. It's smooth, almost like a stout. Absolutely beautiful. I'm glad I have another bottle of this left."
"very light amber color with a white head that sort of diminishes more quickly than preferred. smell is amazing with hints of something like butterscotch and burnt sugar and graham crackers. taste follows the nose and incredibly smooth. Sweet, but not overly so and light-bodied though it seems to go right with this one. No hints of the 8.8% ABV here. this is what a pumpkin beer should taste like."
"O - Not what I was expecting at all. It was a bit thin and the aroma and taste reminded me of ¢25 packets of oatmeal which I made growing up. However the pumpkin was real and noticeable. A super fresh example of a beer I've been dying to try since I missed it last year. A very successful pumpkin beer, but I have yet to find one that is excellent."
"What makes this beer so special is the attention to detail. What blows me away every time is the whipped cream. I have no idea how they do it but the flavor is seriously here. This is what people look for in Short's beers, but Southern Tier really delivers here."
"Pours a very pretty clear burnt orange with a two finger head that turns to a thin lace of thin bubbles and slimes across the glass. The smell, wow, it smells like a well spiced pumpkin pie fresh out of the oven, with subtle scents of candy corn. The taste offers the same, warm pumpkin pie, generous spice and a faint layer of alcohol. Medium on feel, nice smooth, delicious. This is what a pumpkin ale should taste like, a friggin pumpkin! This truly is a great beer look forward to it every fall."
"O: Under the Fall pumpkin style, this ranks among the top that I've ever had. Pumpkin seems like a very hard flavor to harness and Southern Tier has clearly mastered it. This beer is great standing alone, but would make a fantastic dessert beer at the Thanksgiving table. It's definitely got a Jelly Belly/Willy Wonka full-flavor experience going on."
"Pours a deep orange color with little head. Very still looking beer, this is a 2010 release. Aromas are of sweet pumpkin pie, delectable and syrupy nose. Flavor is a perfect match, chewy graham cracker and sweet strong pumpkin candy. Spice level is much subdued since the fresh release, I love this beer with a bit of age on it. The light bitterness dissapears and the rich sweet pie-like character shines through. Definitely the best pumpkin beer on the market."
"From beginning to end this beer is by far the best pumpkin flavored beverage i've ever had. Shipyard pumpkin ale is great too, but Pumking blows it out of the water. This beer is not too heavy, it's a perfect size to drink at an event. The only bad thing about it is that it might lose it's chill after holding on to it for a while, but so does any large beer of the same container."
"Overall, I think this is a delicious beer, and would make a perfect compliment to a Thanksgiving dinner, with perhaps a second bottle around to pair with dessert. And then a nice fire to fall asleep in front of. Ah..."
"Overall-Something might be wrong here. I've heard good things about this beer, and was looking forward to it, but it was just messy. Is it not good because it's a year old? did I get a bad bottle? Not sure, but I don't think I can finish this bomber. Very dissipointed."
"o: best pumpkin beer I've had to date. I can't imagine it getting much better than this. I could drink this all throughout the fall and look forward to taking part in this experience again soon."
"Overall, I really thoroughly enjoy this beer. Some may call pumpkin beers a novelty, but I say its a now pretty well-established style, and this might be the best of them."
"O- Pretty awesome beer. Super pumped I had it on tap."
"THE PUMKING ROCKS!"
"This brew has a medium body and thick viscosity- with a very smooth, slightly bubbly feel. Overall, this is on the extreme end of the pumpkin scale for a pumpkin ale. If you like a """hint""" of pumpkin in your Halloween ale, this will knock you over. However, if you want to taste bold pumpkin and spice flavors, this is your ale!"
"O - Very well balanced pumpkin ale, one of the best I have ever tasted. ABV is well hidden but does come through in the taste as you continue drinking the ale. I would highly recommend it."
"Heady start as the foam almost crests over the top of the glass, bright golden orange color. Smells of pumpkin bread and vanilla wafers, a very sweet nose. Very smooth big body. Pumpkin to start then sweetness, soon the spices kick in as well as the hops. Alcohol does not chime in until a few sips in and quickly warms the mouth. A slow sipper due to the more robust flavors of spice and malt sweetness ... the alcohol as well. Certainly worth a go, I bet some pork loin would love to be brined in this."
"Overall: Pretty good, somewhat sweet, although less pumpkin-y than I expected."
"It's like drinking a slice of pumpkin pie. The best pumpkin beer ever! Most Pumpkin beers do not have this favor! My friends and I love this seasonal release. Southern Tier doe not make any beer in this class of brew. after one taste, you will be a punking fan."
"The beer pours out as a clear copper color. The smell of spice and brown sugar rise from the glass along with some pumpkin and other seasonal spices. The taste of the beer reminded me of a Ginger Snap cookie but in a liquified form. It's spicy and sweet. The mouthfeel could be a little thicker I think but overall it's a really good Pumpkin ale and I enjoy it every time I have it."
"Delicious, pumpkin-y and spicy (but not overkill). A very nice medium-rich beer - good for a fall night or an afternoon of carving pumpkins. Nice paired with a hearty stew or a few gingerbread cookies. A bit pricy at 8-10 dollars for a 2 serving bottle...worth it if you have it once a year as a seasonal treat."
"I'm glad I gave this one another shot, as I really did enjoy it this time around. It's now a favorite in a style that sadly is only around for a couple months a year."
"This one's going down the drain, again. I'm glad other people like this stuff so that I can easily send out the couple remaining bottles as extras."
"a beer to drink in small quantities. great for sharing great for dessert. a winning beer."
"Overall, there is no doubt that this is the best pumpkin ale I have ever had, and I really can't imagine one being any better. I like pumpkin pie a lot, but I would take this over pumpkin pie. The gold standard for the style, no doubt about that."
"Overall an absolutely stunning rendition of a fall favorite. While a lot of examples of this style come off contrived/fake tasting, this one rings true and as natural as can be. You can actually taste a heavy whipped cream dollop on the top and the flakey buttery crust too. Just perfect!"
"The only thing I could ask for is a little more of a creamier mouth feel. The aroma and taste probably gets better as it warms a little, but I drank it too fast to find out."
"O - An amazing brew, superbly engineered and executed. It is unabashed intensity at its best, and mediocrity is clearly exiled in every aspect. I can see how this may be a little much for the traditional or timid, but that's the point. This is unbridled inhibition, passion, and creative catharsis - brace yourself for an icon of Pumpkinsanity."
"Overall I think this beer is pretty phenomenal. I always look forward to October when I can get my hands on it and not a year goes by that I don't celebrate the arrival of autumn with at least 1 bottle of Pumking."
"The CPJ"
"Great job Southern Tier!"
"D: Awesome beer. A must try for anyone who has a love for this style."
"D - The alcohol is not even noticeable, great brew from Southern Tier, never let down!"
"The draft variety of this beer is just unbelievably rewarding. The color is deep amber and smell fragrant smelling of pumpkin pie spices, most notable being allspice but it is not overwhelming. Mouthfeel is smooth and slightly grainy and goes down smooth and gets tastier as it warms. As you drink down one the warmth arrives slowly as the high alcohol begins to kick in. The finish is like a full taste of pumpkin pie,including crust. It is tough to put down more than two 10 ounce goblets at one sitting as this is like drinking dessert. I can't wait till next Fall to test the 2011 batch. This is another outstanding Southern Tier product as all their beers get better with time."
"D and overall impression: Drinkability is as good as a pumpkin beer can be. Can't have too many but a couple will do the trick. Overall, the best pumpkin I've had. Can't wait for next year. Skal."
"Drinkability- This one is real smooth, fresh and aged. Great with dessert or on its own AS dessert. I could drink a couple bombers, but I'll stick to one. Very good flavors, don't wanna overdo it on your mouth. After this one, get a nice Imperial Stout or something of the like to keep up the big beer profile and make it an early night. m/"
"I perfer the Smuttynose pumpkin over this one as it's much easier to drink (much less sweet). However, Southern Tier's Pumpkin is a nice dessert beer."
"This is definitely not a flavor profile that will agree with everyone, but I enjoyed it."
"I don't normally like this style of beer, but this one I like a bunch. Other than a friends homebrew, this is the best pumpkin beer I have had."
"Pours an orangish brown color with a thick tan head and a good amount of lacing. Smells of pumpkin, cardamom, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Tastes of a pumpkin pie explosion with tons of cinnamon and nutmeg, but too many malts. Mouthfeel is medium and carbonation is light. Drinkability is okay."
"3.5 D: I expect ST to get this brew back on track next year. If they don't I'll be incredibly pissed considering I love pumpkin/pie spice brews and so few quality ones exist."
"Poured from bomber into dimple glass. Wow, what can I say about this beer! It felt like I was eating a pumpkin pie when drinking this special brew. Pours harvest orange with a small, fizzy, off-white head, somewhat diminishing with spare, if any, lacing. Somewhat disappointing on the lack of head or lace. Aroma is heavy malt (cookie, cereal, straw, biscuit), average hops (grass, herbs), average yeast (dough, leaves) with notes of pumpkin, cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg, and brown sugar. There is an interesting mix of lightly buttered biscuits and sugar cookies that permeates above all the typical """pumpkin beer""" spices that is rather intriguing and inviting in a raw dough kind of way. The pumpkin is not too much nor too little yet is much more present than most pumpkin beers. Medium bodied, aided by the uncharacteristically high alcohol content, alcoholic texture, average carbonation that fizzles away rapidly, and a chalky yet dry finish. Long duration, moderate sweetness, acidity, and bitterness. I am quite taken by this pumpkin beer as it seems to nail the one thing others cannot - it gives the pumpkin flavor along with spices (typical) but also adds a freshly baked crust to the aroma and flavor."
"But that taste, wow, it can be broken into two distinct parts. First, there is a hoppy IPA, with citrus and a dry mouthfeel. But the IPA is quickly overwhelmed by a very heavy sweet and spicey pumpkin finish. If you'd like to drink your desert on Thanksgiving then I'd highly recommend Pumking."
"I liked this beer last year. What happened?"
"Maybe this would be better right off the bottling line, but in its current state I thought it was unbalanced in favor of spice and hop flavors. A little more pumpkin in the mix and a smoother mouthfeel would encourage me to rate it a bit higher."
"overall, its just average in drinkability. the high alcohol content for one, but more importantly, just like I couldn't eat too much of a pumpkin pie in one sitting, i got a little tired of this too."
"Some dangerous drinkability here as always. Creamy and slick but less cloying than previous versions. Mellow, fine textured carbonation. Still indulgent and dessert-like with, of course, huge flavors and aromas. Overall on-par with previous versions but certainly a bit different. A masterpiece of seasonal enjoyment once again."
"D - I really enjoyed the pumpkin flavours, and I would recommend it to any pumpkin ale fan, however, the bitterness was a little much at times. I had to crack another beer halfway through the bomber in order to finish it. Most certainly couldn't have more than one bomber."
"D: Overall, this makes a great fall/winter beer, alcohol is well-hidden for 9%abv. Definitely will look for this next year when it comes out to try it fresh."
"D - Almost a chore to drink. While I like the aroma and the feel, the taste was just.. wrong. I generally don't care for spiced ales, but I was ready for this to be an exception. Too bad. I'll try it as fresh as humanly possible next year to see if it was an issue with this bottle, but I doubt it."
"D: ...Alcohol is totally hidden, and the drying quality makes you want to drink more... this is very high in drinkability."
"Easily the best tasting beer by Southern Tier. I remember the days when this would sell out in August or September and not be around for Halloween. I stocked up and saved it for October back in the day. PERFECT Pumpkin taste and aroma. Tastes more like pumpkin pie than pumpkin. Nice malty flavor tops it off."
"Off tap at the Ugly Duckling in Manlius this beer, which I'd been seeking on tap for months, was a clear, orange color. The retention of the khaki head as a skim was ok and it left spotty lacing. The aroma was a fresh and inviting blend of pumpkin, spices, boozy warmth, caramel malt and brown sugar. The flavors were just amazing. Homemade pumpkin pie in a bottle. The pumpkin tasted fresh ,the spices all present but well balanced, the creaminess of the mouthfeel conducive to a pie-like experience. Wow. The alcohol was also well concealed. The mouthfeel was creamy and rich, the body full and the carbonation light. I believe this is the best Pumpkin beer made in the world right now and it's absolutely worth tracking down."
"D- All and all this is one excellent holiday beer with smooth and sweet qualities that make it a great addition to a turkey dinner or any large meal. Cheers to the innovations of the craft beer movement!"
"Love the brewery, love the beer's name but the overall sweetness of the beer is overwhelming for this guy."
"D - The alcohol is expertly hidden, but does become pleasantly noticeable at the very end. I tried to slowly savor this, but next to impossible. Wish I would've gotten ahold of a bomber of this."
"EDIT 09Nov2011 - It's about a year later and I'm re-trying this beer. I still like it and I'm not changing any numbers. It smells so good... the rest of my comments and ratings stand. It's a good pumpkin beer for sure!"
"This is the best pumpkin beer I've ever had, hands down."
"This beer pours an orangey amber clear with a little white head that dissipates quickly. The smell is powerful and interesting, like the dessert table at thanksgiving. Nutmeg, cinnamon, some minor bitterness and of course pumpkin. The taste follows the nose with some sweetness on the back end, butterscotch and toffee. The pumpkin in it is really strong that it almost doesn't taste like real pumpkin, almost a bit chemically. Very strong spices as well and I thought I tasted a bit of mint. This full bodied beer is kind of a relentless assault on the senses. I wish it was a little more delicate, decent enough though."
"DELICIOUS, MUST TRY!"
" the taste profile is gourmet pumpkin pie. Depth of spice maybe hops additions give this a slighly bitter edge to what is an alchoholic sweet style beer. great finish and great mouthfeel make this a champion beer for its style. Kingly but subtle. Sublime is the word. Greatly enjoyable, and after comsuming three quarters of the case, this beer deserves its rep. Best most complex pumpkin beer that I have drunk so far- so says the great pumpkin lover."
"D. I dig graham crackers, but i'm buying different Southern Tier beer."
"Drinkability - I am pleased with this beer, its solid and delivers what I came for, PUMPKIN! There is a reason why this is the king, it will forever be a memory to me!"
"Southern Tier Pumking is a beer I have really been looking forward to, so I saved it for Thanksgiving to have with family. We all enjoyed this and liked the comparison to my own pumpkin beer, a roasted pumpkin and lightly spiced brown ale. Pumking was a vibrant orange with a fiercely spicey nose. it smelled like cloves cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger spice and off freshly roasted sweet pumpkin. The beer tasted like a caramelly sweet piece of ginger bread with a lot of spice, maybe too much and there was a little butterscotch, which might be a flaw normally went well in this beer. The only fault that I can find in this beer is the over utliization of spices which infiltrates every square milimeter of my mouth and lingers on. There is no delicacy or deftness in the spicing, just a wallop on the head, which negatively affects its drinkability."
"I love this beer and would argue that it is consistently one of the best pumpkin ales brewed each year. I can't wait for next years batch to see if they develop it even further. Thanks Southern Tier!"
"Drinkability is relatively high. The ABV is moderately high but well incorporated. The flavor profile is also nice, however it seems it will be a bit of a task to repeat this taste for an entire bomber. Overall not bad."
"A great choice for a Thanksgiving Day beer, but might be a once a year beer for me overall."
"Truly great stuff! Best pumpkin ale? Maybe not as drinkable as milder ones, but that flavor is unmatched."
"Overall an excellent pumpkin beer. I prefer this to the others I have sampled."
"D: Everything about this beer reminds me of a fresh baked pumpkin pie. The label suggests it's a halloween beer, but I think it works best as a desert beer for Thanksgiving dinner."
"This is a tasty beer, although it is almost a dessert rather than a beer. Definitely worthy, a very good pumpkin beer."
"Overall, all I can say is """Good job, Southern Tier! You really nailed it with this one!""" Now that I've tried it, I can see exactly why so many people are praising this beer. Wonderful stuff!"
"Mouthfeel is fine. Drinkability poor."
"This marks my second Pumpkin Ale, with the first being Brooklyn's Post Road, and for the most part I was very impressed. It looks great and the nose is near perfect, but the alcohol could really use some toning down. I think that would allow for all of the sweet and spicy notes to really shine and increase its drinkability many times over. With its hefty price tag, I think I'll stick to Brooklyn's Pumpkin Ale for when I have the urge to drink a spicy pumpkin beer, but I'd say this one is still worth a try."
"This beer needs to be cleaned up a little bit. The ethyl is too easily detectable in here. Anyhow, feel wise it's warming, a little crisp and oily at the same time."
"Overall this was my first pumpkin beer and I chose to try one of the best to represent the style. Well although I did manage to try and like this style, the flavor in this beer was just way too much(and not in a good way). It would have been better if the Nutty flavor in this beer was not overdrive."
"D - meh. its not a bad brew, but not the standout that I've read about. i've definitely had better, but on the same not I've had much worse."
"D: If it wasn't for the high levels of alcohol, I could enjoy this one over and over in one sitting."
"Deep golden orange in colour with abundant eggshell foam that laces patchily. Intense aroma of pumpkin, vanilla, brown sugar, and pie crust. Sweet and malty, bursting with pumpkin flavour as well as vanilla, cookie dough, and an earthy bitterness in the finish. Alcohol is noticeable but not overwhelming. Medium bodied with fine carbonation that makes it feel soft and fluffy in the mouth. I like pumpkin beer, but only in small doses. A 6'er of DFH Punk, for example, took a few months for me to finish last year. Considering this is like pumpkin beer on steroids, this was shockingly easy to drink. I was worried I would fatigue on it part way through, but there was no such problem. I don't think I'll be rushing out to buy more, but I could see this being a nice treat once every Autumn."
"D: The taste is complex, interesting, but not sure if I'm on board. Would rather have a weyerbacher or dfh pumpkin."
"Basically, this is like liquid pumpkin pie with a kick. And this could be a great Pumpkin Ale, if they put a leash on the spices and cleaned up the finish."
"Final Thoughts: Well, after two lackluster brews, southern tier continues to disappoint me. It's a shame too, as it started out so nicely. Now one thing I did notice is this one seems to be 7.9% so maybe I got last year's batch. I doubt it, but I wouldn't put it past the LCBO. Either way, this one is a pass, the so called best pumpkin ale, I did not find to be even remotely nice once it touched my lips. One more strike and Southern Tier strikes out for me."
"Southern Tier is my hometown brewery and I was fortunate enough to get this from a trade with an old friend. Nice clear, orange pour with a pretty quickly fading head and decent lacing. The huge smell is totally incredible when you consider it's beer. I've had plenty of pumpkin beers, but none of them smelled like this. Sugary, spicey, with tons of caramel and the fresh pumpkin pie aroma is awesome. The taste is much the same as the smell. Big and complex. Lots of cinnamon, brown sugar, nutmeg and the most authentic pumpkin pie flavor ever in a pumpkin beer. And the best thing is that Southern Tier does all this without making it sickly sweet like most pumpkin beers I've tried. Very smooth with just the right amount of carbonation. It's sweet, but the bitter hop bite offsets that and reminds you that it's beer. I had totally forgotten that this was a 9% Imperial until I reviewed it. Southern Tier is arguably the best at disguising high alcohol beers. Drinkability is huge when you consider this is more of a dessert beer and an Imperial. I would love to reduce this and pour it over vanilla ice cream, but I've only got 4 and I'm drinking them all! Another top notch beer from Soutern Tier. Thanks for making this possible Torry!"
"Overall a great, unique pumpkin beer. Like all of their imperials, Southern Tier aimed high with this one. The result is fantastic, but not the most drinkable beer. I can't see myself drinking more than a few of these a year, but I'll always look forward to breaking open a bottle of this one (as long as I don't have to finish it myself)."
"This is easily my favorite pumpkin beer, although at the same time, its sweetness makes it hard to drink a lot of, though I tend to have a similar issue with other pumpkin beers."
"What I had was a gorgeous, heady brew with a caramel to amber color and thick white head. It smelled like the day after Halloween, when all the frat boys have smashed pumpkins all over the street and there's a crisp chilly autumnal flavor to the air. The flavor was rich and delicious, with plenty of pumpkin and a hint of spice - not like the pumpkin pie-in-a-glass style that afflicts so many of these beers. I will definitely drink this again. With any luck, it will be sans hippie dingbat."
"D: Pumking is not my favorite pumpkin ale, but it's still nice and enjoyable. This would be great with something sweet."
"I've seen them on tap and in 22 oz bombers. The 22 oz is a bit much to drink by yourself. Share with someone you care about!"
"Had it on draft at Sheffield's in Chicago this past weekend. Anytime that you can get a Pumpking, a Founder's Breakfast Stout, and a Smuttynose IPA all on draft at one sitting, you know you're at a decent bar. In any event, this is hands down the best pumpkin ale I've tried. I think I spent more time with my snout hovering over the tulip glass than I spent actually drinking it! The aroma is perfect with great nutmeg, cinnamon, and clove notes. Smells, and to a large extent tastes, just like a pumpkin pie. Could have used a little more head (could have been a bad pour), and the head could have been a little creamier. Aside from that, delicious. Rarely do I feel that I can drink two fruit beers back-to-back, but I certainly could have done so with the Pumpking...that is, if I didn't have a Breakfast Stout on deck."
"Southern Tier Pumking is simply the best pumpkin ale on the market...there is nothing close. I tasted this beer out of the bottle and on tap, and both were excellent. i work at a pub and have had the opportunity to try many examples of pumpkin ales. Again, this is the best. Pumking smells amazing and follows with an equivalent taste. Highly recommended."
"Happily encountered at The Grill Next Door in Haverhill, MA, this seasonal offering is a very clear, light yellowish-amber color with a modest white head and marginal lacing. The aroma brings a deep herbal pumpkin with cinnamon malt and toasted sweet potatoe, marshmallow sweetness. Awesome and so tempting. The taste offers similar tasty ideas with allspice, graham cracker and squash/pumpkin """malted""" together for a desert-like medley. Deliciously unveiled in a medium bodied brew with modest carbonation that gives a mellow mouthfeel with fair drinkability at best. This is sweet and autumnally tasty stuff that is probably best enjoyed one glassful at a seating. Alcohol is not highly evident but notable."
"I'd sworn off Southern Tier's sweet beers but caved in and decided to give this a try. Glad I did, not my favourite pumpkin beer but not the worst either."
"Side note: This is my girls favorite brew."
"Apparently this year is a bit worse than previous years, so I'm hoping I can try a vintage version of this..."
"There is a lasting aftertaste of hops, alcohol and pumpkin. This is a medium bodied offering with a moderate amount of carbonation. I feel the boldness of the alcohol hurts this brew a bit and takes away from it's drinkability. The nose was fantastic but the unbalanced hop and alcohol character was a distraction with the pumpkin taking a far back seat. For being considered the pumpkin beer that all other pumpkin beers are measured up against, this one fell short."
"Pours a copper color with an orange tinge that already suggests pumpkin. Big but short-lived head, slightly off-white. The aroma is massively pumpkin-y. The aroma is spicy as well, the pumpkin and additional spices blending with spicy hops. The taste follows suit. I'm going to go ahead and declare this the best pumpkin beer I've had this year. Pumpkin (meat, not spice) dominates this beer. There's that great vegetable sweetness, and if I'm not mistaken, there's some caramel as well. Unlike many pumpkin beers, the spice here takes much more of a supporting role, rounding out the sweetness and serving as an effective substitute for bitter hops to clean up the finish. Sweetness does linger a bit, but believe me, that's a good thing. It stays very drinkable throughout, with no hint of the rather hefty alcohol content. I regret waiting until so late in the season to try this one. It really exemplifies what a pumpkin beer should be."
"Taste has that unique flavor of real pumpkin melded with caramel malt, the spicing is a bit lacking though and pumpkin isn't the most delicious of ingredients without a decent amount of spice to compensate, the strength is well hidden and you'd never know it was 9%, crisp carbonation."
"Drinkability: Dessert beer - split this bomber with a friend!"
"This is probably my favorite fall beer. It combines all the great flavors of fall with a smooth, sweet, spicy finish. WOW!"
"perhaps the best pumpkin beer I've ever had, 2009 so a year has treated it quite well. thanks liamt07 for sending this gem my way"
"This is a little extreem for a pumpkin beer but is worth a try, king of the style, not to be taken lightly."
"Drink - If you're looking for a beer that tastes like pumpkin pie; you've come to the right place. There is a reason this beer is referred to as the King. I'm not sure the bottle needs to be 650ml.. you'd be well advised to find some friends to share this one with. A little goes a looong way. It's a once a year type beer that I'm happy I tried."
"D: The beer is very easy to drink because the sweet flavors in the taste aren't cloying because of the underlying hops and the alcohol content is very well masked."
"Overall: hands down the best pumpkin beer I have ever had!"
"This isn't something i'd drink more than a bomber of in a night, but it is a great beer to enjoy on Halloween. Very filling, and quite buzz inducing. I'm happy to have had the opportunity of tasting this unique beer."
"Drinkability -- This is the best pumpkin beer I've had to date, possibly the first I've really enjoyed. My only quips is that the sweetness needs to be dialed back (I've heard that this year's batch has been especially sweet) and the mouthfeel could stand to be fuller. Aside from this, the spicing is on point and pumpkin flavor is in the forefront. There's a reason this beer has been singled out as one of the top-rated pumpkin beers. A must-try."
"Making sure to save some for halloween and thanksgiving..."
"Brooklyn Post Road may be the best all-around as far as look/taste/feel, and Smuttynose may have the best pumpkin flavor, but Pumking sports the most mouth-watering aroma and overall drinkability. I still don't have a crystal-clear view on what a pumpkin ale should or could be, but this sets some kind of standard."
"Cheers!"
"Pumpkin beers aren't really my thing, but this is a decent one to drink. Still, though, I'm okay with this once a year or so."
"Morey's Bottom Line: A fantastic Pumpkin Ale. Southern Tier knows how to hide the alcohol in their big beers. Well Done and highly recommended."
"This would be a great one to bring to a Halloween party simply because the bottle looks kick ass, and would inspire some conversation and tasting."
"I remain a huge fan of Southern Tier, but this is a beer I'd be hesitant to purchase again."
"Happy Halloween!"
"Note to Self: Ranked #6 Pumpkin Ale when I tried it"
"I can best sum this up as a novelty beer...I have a love/hate relationship with it in a way. It's worth trying at least once because it's just so damn wacky, probably worth it just to smell it. I myself will probably get this at least once a year during the season."
"At 9% alcohol a single 22 oz bottle makes a real nice fall nightcap. I've been impressed with Southern Tier's quality. The Old Man Winter I tried earlier this week is also very nice."
"Taste is a lot like pumpkin pie on the finish, it's a bit overwhelming and it's gonna be hard to finish this all. The alcohol is very well hidden though. Mouthfeel is a bit light but has a crisp carbonation bite."
"The mouthfeel is very good. Nice and crisp. A little on the boozy side, but I'm almost sorry I am sharing my bomber. Very drinkable"
"I am really enjoying this beer. I'm not always a huge fan of Pumpkin beers, just one or two every fall is enough for me, but I could certainly drink a couple bottles of Pumking. It works very well as a shared beverage. I'm splitting this bottle, and that is perfect for me. When I finish I'll be satisfied but excited to try it again."
"Got to try this again a year later and this beer has really grown on me. By far the best pumpkin beer I have had to date. Love the cinnamon, pumpkin and spices flavours through out. So easy to drink for the high percentage too. Glad I have a few more bottles."
"As far as pumpkin beers go, this is one of the best I have had. I don't typically prefer pumpkin beers, but this one is suprisingly drinkable and unique. Splitting a 22oz was easy."
"One of the best Pumpkin beers i've ever had, certainly one of my new favorites."
"This is my second tasting and it only gets worse. My apologies to those who liked it. I give Southern Tier credit for listing ingredients-- very good for educating us drinkers-- I mean consumers."
"The aroma is strongly pumpkin pie with pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg, clove and the bready crust. Finishing with a bit of alcohol. It's really amazing. The flavor is much milder than the aroma. The pumpkin and spices are still there, accompanied by orange and anise. The alcohol doesn't show itself in the flavor. Carbonation is moderate. Overall I really like this beer better than any other pumpkin beer I've had."
"Another drain pour for me... Bitterly disappointed here... Waited to try this for years... Won't be a second one if this is what I can expect..."
"Overall a very interesting beer, probably the most intense pumpkin beer I've ever tried. Unfortunately the spices aren't well balanced and it tastes too much like egg nog. Not something I would go out and buy again considering the price, but definitely worth a try!"
"Very good but a little disappointed from all the talk about it. Still would order it again but 1 or 2 is enough."
"Overall, I would rake leaves for a couple hours to earn a couple of these. The execution by Southern Tier is ever so fitting to the theme! WIN"
"Cheers..."
"M: Really smooth in the mouth, despite the 9%ABV. I liked the full body and moderate carbonation. It went down too easily :) Drink-ability was excellent as well. I'm gonna buy a few more before they sell out."
"D: For all the accolades Pumking receives, it's not the best pumpkin ale I've tried this year. It's in the top tier, for sure, but I've had several better."
"Edit: After having this a few more times as well as several other pumpkin beers, the aroma and taste don't get much better than this. Its like liquid pumpkin pie, with a dollop of whipped cream on it. I didn't see myself buying this again? What the h was I thinking? I've bought it several times since."
"D/N: Although this beer has big character and is far from what people would think as a traditional beer, Pumking wins by successfully balancing bold, seemingly contradictory flavors with lots of alcohol. Unlike other desert beers, this one actually gets easier to drink as you sip through the bottle."
"southern tier brewing companypumking--Imperial Ale Brewed With Pumpkins--Bewitched & Brewed With Pagan Spirit--2010. 9.00% ABV on Bottle, 8.8% ABV on Web Page. 50 IBU's? (4.75 / 5.0) Thin white thin lace head. Clear bright thin pumpkin orange gold color. Rich floral fresh pumpkin pumpkin spice floral hop front. Smooth creamy rich mellow sweet cloying pumpkin caramel spicy body. Dangerously smooth pumpkin pulp earthy mild hop end. Sampled 10/24/2010 from 22 oz. Bottle purchased for $6.75 at PCC--Fremont, Seattle on 9/7/2010."
"The Pumking smells very good but is over hopped and over spiced for my taste, and ends with a kind of cloyingly bitter sweet sensation in the mouth as you get further into the 22 oz. bottle. It's more a novelty then a serious beer. One was more than enough."
"Definitely one of the most enjoyable Pumpkin Ales out there."
"D - An interesting beer but too spiced up for me. The cloves really dominated the palate and even overshadowed the pumpkin flavour at times."
"I find this much easier to drink (and less sweet) than some of the others in the Blackwater series, but this is still a beer to share. That being said, the alcohol is quite well hidden."
"Like with many folks, I can't justify I high score for drinkability, because 2/3 of a pint is more than enough. Sharing was a smart idea. The flavor is so potent, so hearty, that more than a pint or two a season would be simply too much. Southern Tier need not worry about this - pumpkin ales are a seasonal treat that many of us look forward to but only so few can drink in vast quantities; fortunately their Pumpking can rightfully claim to be among the best of the patch, so when I want my pumpkin ale fix, theirs will be almost certainly be the one I call upon."
"to sum up, great for what it is, my favorite pumpkin ale of 2010, but make sure you have a friend to split the bomber with."
"Without a doubt, *the* best pumpkin beer I have had the opportunity to try. Very well crafted, simply delicious!"
"EDIT: Revisited over a year later (10/08/11), better nose and flavour than I recall initially. One of the ebst pumpkin beers going - loads of crust, ginger snap and true pumpkin pie notes. Awesome. 35/45/4/4/45"
"D - Not really there, this is a heavy handed beer that beats you over the head to let you know it is a pumpkin beer."
"I liked this much more than the St. Ambroise pumpkin, but not as much as the Great Lakes, Grand River or Taps Brewing Pumpkins."
"D: Much better than the two other pumpkin beers I've had (from DFH and some other horrible one). Great to try but I wouldn't want to have more than one of these every few days. Thanks again Michael for the great brew!"
"The mouthfeel is soft, and on the heavyish side of medium. Drinkability, especially given the high ABV, is the really spooky part of this beer!"
"Jake"
"D- Very interesting take, I really enjoy it and it's probably one of my favorite pumpkin ales this season!"
"M & D- Mouthfeel is a little cream, but not too thick. Drinkability is great. The bomber is a perfect amount. I could drink one a week Oct- Nov."
"Not gonna lie here, drain-poured half the bottle. I'm no pumpkin beer conniousseur, but I've had my fair share, and this was by far the most unpleasant. Really not understanding all the positive reviews."
"Not was I was expecting. I doubt I'll have another."
"Future outlook: A solid beer worthy of giving another shot next time around."
"The number one rated pumpkin beer according to BA is poused into a goblet for my sensory appreciation. A light orange colour fills the glass, and is topped with a khaki coloured head atop. Smells like a pumpkin pie, but there's something else here that I don't usually detect with pumpkin beers. The usual suspects are there with the pumpkin, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, coriander, etc. but there's another presence I can't place my finger on, but it puts it above and beyond any others I've had of this style. The taste is simply sublime, with that mystery flavour coming into play even more so in the taste, and the 9% alcohol is barely noticeable. The mouthfeel is pleasant though not overwhelmingly so, and the drinkability is superb. A sure classic for the fall season"
"D: No. We had this side by side with an actual GOOD pumpkin ale (from Kern River). The difference was like night and day. This tastes like some cheap, awful, alcoholic candy. Drinking beer from Southern Tier's Diabeetus imprint feels like a battle. And this is another victory for them."
"And no other (NONE!) have come close to pumpkin pie as this beer has."
"I have heard good things about Southern Tier Brewery. Pumking, cool name. Pours a bright, translucent orange color with a quick fizzing white head and some fine lacing on the glass. Enjoyed this one at the optimal temperature suggested on the bottle, 40 degrees and in my prized Duvel goblet for the optimal experience. Smell was very autumn inspiring with a mixture of ginger snaps and eggnog yeilding a big, complex nose. The taste is similar to the smell with that ginger snap foward taste and a bitter finish from the hops on the sides of the tonuge. I do not detect much pumpkin because most of it is masked by the spices and hop bitterness but it is rather tame and semi-drinkable despite the high 9% ABV. Not a bad imperial."
"Pours a pretty clear pumpkin orange color with a healthy 1-2 finger white head. Leaves a lot of abstract lacing along the glass. Aroma - very strong biscuits or pie crust. Taste is like a sweet biscuit with pumpkin flavors and nutmeg type spices mixed in. Mouthfeel is kind of thick and syrupy - not very carbonated. Would recommend this as a desert beer to compliment some carrot cake or spice cake or (!) pumpkin pie."
"Pours a clear orange amber with a thick off-white head. Good lacing left on the glass. Smells like fresh pumpkin pie. Sweet bready malts with nutmeg and ginger spice. Nice pumpkin flavor in this beer, but not too much...done quite nicely. The smell is definitely better than the taste in my opinion. Nice mouthfeel...not too thick. Very drinkable for 9%, but I'd probably only drink 1 in a sitting so to not get sick of that pumpkin flavor..."
"The taste is surprisingly light, very true to taste of pumpkins. Not overly spices like some variety, this one comes the closest to pumpkin pie! Delicious sip yields the pumpkin taste and slight spices which soon fades into a lingering yeast aftertase. Light and foamy mouthfeel. Just picked this guy up off the shelves, should have let it cool a bit more but overall this is a high note for the fall/october beer releases. Drinkability is high, but one bomber is plenty."
"D - A bomber is probably pushing it with this one. The spices really give you that heat burn feeling in the chest that another sip helps to tone down. It's a bit hot but I think if you can grab one to cellar it will be great for next year."
"Holy Alcohol Batman! This is my second or thrid year in a row getting the King. I've been on a quest for my favorite pumpkin beer and this has fallen down considerably. Really bitey from the alcohol. Really really Almond-esque and the nutty characters weren't accentuated by any spices. Overall this is not very drinkable unless it's time to get pumpkin drunk. The carbonation and appearance were both fine."
"I love Southern Tier, I love most of their offerings, and I love pumpkin beers, but this beer is flat out awful."
"The taste has a strong and lingering hop character and the malt taste is also very present, although there is certainly the sense that one is biting into a delicious piece of pie, pastry, filling and all. The texture of this beer is light, caramel-like and creamy; generally a delicious brew though perhaps I wouldn't want it all year long."
"Pours a bright orange colour with thick head and nice rings of lacing. Smells of lots of pumpkin with some hops and caramel. Flavour has a nice bitterness to it, with some of the syrupy sweetness I expect from some of the Southern Tier beers... though it works much better in this one than in some of their IIPA's. Thick syurpy mouthfeel. Quite a nice pumpkin beer, different than many others that I've had in that is less on spice and bigger on the pumpkin."
"UPDATE: Thanks, ktrillionaire. The commonality between this and Choklat is a syrupy taste."
"The most pumpkin-y pumpkin beer out there. As it was poured in a chalice, the color is a light orange color, a little cloudy almos no head. The smell is just like a sweet pumpin pie... nutmeg, pumpkin, and sugar. This beer is too sweet for my taste to have more than one ever once in a while. But I did enjoy every drop!"
"Drinkability-Yes yes yes I would definetly drink again. The longer it sat the better the flavor got southern tier never ceases to amaze me!"
"D - This is phenomenally delicious as a desert beer, but the confectionery flavors are so rich and saturating in nature that I can not tolerate a second glass."
"Overall this is one of the best pumpkin ales around, hands-down. Alcohol content is a bit high and creeps up, but for the wonderful, unique mix of aroma and flavor in this one, nothing can deny this king his throne."
"Pours a very light gold, 2 fingers of head.  Smells like grahm crackers, pumpkin, mostly like pumpkin pie.   Tastes like pumpkin pie, grahm crackers, allspice, wow, really good.  You can taste the alcohol at the end, but other than that this is a really good pumpkin beer.  Mouthfeel is medium, drinkability is high for this style.  One of the best. "
"price:$6.99 with tax."
"Pours clear orange with a giant bubble head. The aroma is woody and cinnamony and very strong. The flavor is absolutely amazing. It is mostly vanilla, in fact shockingly vanilla. Lots of cinnamon, allspice, ginger. Jesus, is this pumpkin pie in a glass or what? Amazing."
"This stuff is one of the better beers I have tasted"
"The only true point lost on this brew is in the drinkablility. The high ABV on this brew, might turn some heads away. However, this is surely my pick for the Pumpkin ale of the season...theres a reason they call it PumKing"
"This pumpkin beer is completely different than all of the others I have had. This may be my favorite of the bunch. Easy to drink without being too much pumpkin. I really enjoyed the bready qualtiy to this one. Phenomenal!"
"Overall this is a great pumpkin ale. Not highly drinkable, maybe one or two but it's not a session beer. Highly recommended!"
"Will have to open my bottle of 2010 to compare, but IMHO the draft will be tops..."
"Really disappointed wanted to like this one. I really enjoy pumpkin beers at this time of year ."
"d- im set with a bomber of this it's very filling. a slow drinking beer."
"Served from tap into a standard shaker. Poured a nice copper with a one finger white head that subsided slowly to a minimal amount. Maintained nice lacing throughout. The aroma was comprised of pumpkin, pumpkin spice, brown sugar, and granola. The flavor was of pumpkin, pumpkin spice, and pie crust. It had a light feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was seriously like drinking a pumpkin pie. I don't know how they pulled this off, but it is quite good. Definitely one of my favorite pumpkin beers I've had to date. Great for a dessert brew."
"Drinkability only loses a point due to high ABV. Taste, mouthfeel and overall enjoyability make this the pumpkin beer of choice for me for this holiday (Halloween/Samhain) season."
"d- i can't explain how disappointed i am that i didn't like this. i waited forever to try this and gotta say that i wasn't a fan at all. i just couldn't shake the sense that i was drinking a candle. sad."
"Overall, its a good seasonal/specialty beer, but I wouldnt drink this too often."
"This is a decent pumpkin ale, especially if you enjoy a good dose of diacetyl (I typically don't and the review numbers reflect this). It is fairly drinkable, but surely a novelty, and not one I'll seek out again. For my tastes it reminds me too much of the butter flavored sludge that movie theaters put on their popcorn."
"D: The flavor of this beer just doesn't do it for me; that being said, I wouldn't have more than one - although, I might give it another try before its gone for the year."
"Drinkability falls to the way side with some of the harsher flavors that I had to push through."
"Pour was a clear amber orange out of the tap with a fluffy light tan head. Not a lot of retention. Smells just like pumpkin pie...a real earthy sense to it. Tastes like drinking pumpkin pie without the hang-up of crust and whipped cream. I'm not typically a fan of this style, but I have to make an exception here. This is really good. I really liked that the sweetness was left out, especially with the highish ABV. I was floored when the owner told me it was 9%. You can't even taste the alcohol. Feels creamy and slightly sticky, which really match the flavors. Drinkability is up there."
"D-The onslaught of spice on the palette is making it hard to finish the bomber of this one. I just keep tasting those spices over and over again even when taking breaks to critique the beer. Time might this beer's best friend as the spice is way too overwhelming for me."
"D- Very good pumpkin beer and will buy it again. It would be better if was thicker and creamier with the 9% ABV hidden more. Really enjoy the pumpkin pie flavor of the beer."
"Pumpkin orange with a creamy light tan head. The aroma is amazing, pumpkin pie with vanilla cream. Not much in the way of trad malt or hop notes in the nose. The flavors in this brew far exceed that of the average """pumpkin spice""" brew, it's like pumpkin pie custard with vanilla whipped cream. Medium bodied with smooth and steady carbonation. Good drinkability for being 9% alcohol but I probably would not drink more than one of these in a sitting."
"this beer poured a clear """pumpkin""" light amber colored brew in my Duvel tulip glass. It smells strongly of pumpkin pie, just like a slice of pumpkin pie. Taste is also just like a pumpkin pie, with like 9% of alcohol poured into it. Though very tasty it is a bit overbearing. The mouth feel is good and I am still blown away by the flavors. Though I could drink more not in the same night. Great beer just a little overwhelming on the flavors."
"This is a very unique imperial pumpkin beer. Sweeter more than spicy, If you like pumpkin pie you will like this beer. If you desire spice head for Weyerbacher Imperial Pumpkin."
"D= I've been waiting for a good decent pumpkin beer and this one is the winner by far the best one I've had and it had a really good price on it too. This one really taste like pumpkin."
"D: Was great, but wasn't for me really. I will drink it again if its around but if I had a choice I'm going with something lighter."
"In closing, is this the ultimate pumpkin beer? I don't know about that. I think for now that title belongs to Elysian Night Owl. This is certainly a good brew and a fine example of one of my favorite seasonal styles."
"mouthfeel. It is like eating pumkin pie, if you ate the crust end first. I like this more then most beers of this style. I could have one however and be content. The same with thanksgiving, the pumpkin pie is the ending, I'm stuffed after this one."
"Drinkability - Awesome. Every time I take a sip I just want more. One of the most flavorful pumpkin ale's I've ever tasted. Could drink this as a session beer. Just make sure someone takes my keys.."
"Enjoy this fine brew, if you are looking for """pumpkin pie""" taste, this is your beer!"
"Had a case of bombers and it is really hard to keep your hands off of this beer. Just awesome."
"Notes: This could be a great beer if they thickened up the body. It is Imperial after all. As mentioned, the hop bitterness was also out of place. I am not a fan of the Creme Brulee Stout, but I feel that if Southern Tier took a page out of that book and went balls to the wall here and made this strictly a sweet dessert beer, it would be much better. It feels as though they have diluted it and restrained the sweetness in an effort to keep it more on the beery side. I can't praise the nose enough, but after that I think this beer was average in almost every other way. A few tweaks in the recipe would make all the difference."
"Overall: I have a had a few pumpkin beers in my time, and this is the strongest one I have had. The aroma is fantastic, however, the spice lingers on the finish too long and reduces the balance of the beer, adding a bitterness. It is still a great fall seasonal release, however, be aware that is has a lot of flavor."
"The perfect autumnal warmer. Treat yourself to a pint over Thanksgiving dinner, or while masterfully carving pumpkins on All Hallows Eve. Booya!"
"Overall, not impressed given the hype everyone lauds over this. If it tasted like pumpkin instead of popcorn, I would've liked it better. DFH Punkin, Weyerbacher Imp. Pumpkin and Terrapin Pumpkinfest blow this beer out of the water."
"D: It's very flavorful and easily drinkable despite the high alcohol content."
"Southern Tier really likes using their hops, and it shows with the number of imperial selections they have, but in this case, it counts against them. A lot of brewers in North America have been putting most of their focus on hops lately, often hopping beers out of thier style, and I feel this is what happend here. The pumpkin was too short lived before it was shoved aside and overwhelmed by the hops, which took center stage, leaving just the spice in the end. This doesn't mean I hated it, I'd drink it again happily if someone offered it, but in my opinion a pumpkin ale just isn't right for a big hop and alcohol content to be the center of attention."
"Not much pumpkin to it and a jumbled mess of other flavors. It left an astringency on the back of my throat that I couldn't shake. This has to be one of the most overrated beers ever."
"The mouthfeel is very full and heavy, almost chewy except for the empty end of the taste. Carbonation level is good. The drinkability is low though. I've had many of the other ST dessert beers and can appreceate that style but this example just falls flat. God thing my wife loves it because I had hard enough time finishing my half of a bomber."
"Pumking may be my new favorite Imperial style pumpkin beer, thought there are several in the style I need to try yet. Until I do however, this beats the rest in quality and intensity of flavor though I have to remark the vanilla borders on feeling artificial. Artificial or not, the flavor is well integrated with an authentic pumpkin flavor independent of the traditional pumpkin spices which are easily overdone in other pumpkin ales. Very good and highly recommended though perhaps not to everyone's taste as demonstrated by my wife who did not enjoy this in the least."
"I had this at a great restaurant in Cleveland called Melt. I really need to find it here in NC."
"ST brews tend to be very potent versions of the style. Some like this more than others. In this case I think they do an incredible job of following the style, making a high ABV very drinkable, and making a beer that stands out. Glad I tried this."
"Flavor is like the aroma, but stronger and more artificial. Tastes like corn syrup and pumpkin pie flavored sugar water. God this is bad. If I wasn't at an outdoor tasting festival it would have been a drain pour. I struggled to get the 5 oz sampler down."
"I wanted to like this so badly. I wanted to fall in love with a fall beer that was reminiscent of the smells and flavors of the season. This sucker is reminiscent of autumn, only if fall was fabricated by Hallmark. Nothing natural about it. It should come with silver glitter floating inside to complete the effect. Poured about 6 bucks of beer down the drain, after sharing with three other people."
"D: This is just terrible. A waste of $7. if you really want a nice pumpkin ale, stick with Cottonwood. It is by far the best one out there."
"D- All good review, save the drinkability. I suppose that I may have a slightly skewed perspective, but I couldn't honestly even finish the bottle is was so rich."
"This is what I have been waiting for. If you're looking for a pumpkin beer that isn't watered down spice and actually tastes like pumpkin, seek this out and don't turn back. This is what a pumpkin beer should taste like."
"Between this and their Creme Brulee, Southern Tier is a personal favorite brewer. Love it."
"D: Yup. That's it right there. Nearly perfect."
"Overall impression: Not something I'll revisit. I'm beginning to wonder if a pumpkin beer focusing on the pumpkin actually exists."
"Price = ? at Witherspoon Wines"
"D: Probably the best pumpkin ale I've tried so far. Exceptionally drinkable."
"D - very drinkable for a 9%...but awfully bitter for a pumpkin/spice ale. Glad I tried it, not sure I'd order a 2nd."
"I had high expectations going into this one, and they were met. A very unique pumpkin brew, with very nice balance in flavors. I might have to stock up on some more before they're all gone!"
"Drinkability - This is a good beer, but it's something I can really only have once a year. Really good, it's a close call between this and the Dog Fish Head."
"I had a Southern Tier Pumking yesterday after I finished cleaning the beer lines at the Lodge in Hilton Head and was blown away by how true to the flavor of pumpkin it was. I like other pumpkin beers, but find that so many are more """pumpkin spice""" than anything. This beer tasted like what a pumpkin smells like when it is being roasted in an oven. It is more honest to name """pumpkin beer""" than others I've had."
"I would definitely drink this with a Thanksgiving meal for a massive taste bud orgasm. This is my favorite """fall""" beer and hope everyone tries it at least once in their lives. Remember, this has an ABV of 9%, the alcohol is not present in the taste so drink slower and savor the beer, as it should be done regardless."
"Very unique beer - even among pumpkins. The aroma was super and the taste very good. Overall an excellent beer!"
"What a treat this beer is in the Fall! Copper body with a thick fluffy white head. This beer smells pretty much like pumpkin pie. In terms of pumpkin beers, this one is pretty extreme for the style. Literally liquid pumpkin pie in a bottle. Big spicy pumpkin pie flavor, caramel, some burnt sugar notes. Not exactly a beer that I can drink more than a few times per year, but definitely enjoyable for the style."
"M: Very creamy and thick. Finish is very wet, but with enough alcohol to balance. Wait about fifteen seconds and it tapers off to a medium."
"Taste like healthy portion and vitality of yeast culture. Very clean and lacking in booziness even though it is 9%."
"The BEST of the pumpkin beers."
"D - While the taste is spot on for what I think a Pumpkin ale should be, the slightly syrupy character makes this hard for me to drink a lot of."
"I'm not a big fan of pumpkin but I know a big pumpkin flavor when I taste it. This is spicy despite no use of spices in the brew so presumably it's from the yeast or hops. My wife loves pumpkin and is not much of a beer drinker and really liked this beer. The only thing I was not too fond of is its dry witbier-like mouthfeel. It is however a fine compliment to pumpkin pie since it is rather dry.The 9% alcohol is nowhere to be found in the flavor and this is just a great big pumpkin beer."
"This was the ride of my life for pumpkin ales. 9% abv and you cant even taste the heat. This was my 4th Pumking this year and i plan on tasting more and more. Great consistency from bottle to bottle. I recommend you drink this one soon."
"(D)- I always look forward to this every year now after trying it for the first time last year."
"In my excitement for this year's Pumking, and in an effort to reduce the chances of my local distributor running out of Pumking early like they did last year, I purchased two cases. I paid $190 and all I got was this lousy remembrance of a good beer."
"If you love pumpkin pie and simple, well-made beer, this is perhaps the beer for you. The apparent high alcohol hurts the experience (though I'm sure other less immediately apparent aspects of the ABV help the experience; I am no expert brewer), but not enough to keep me from enjoying the beer. Like Southern Tier's Crème Brûlée, this beer successfully straddles novelty and substance."
"As far as Pumpkin beers go, drinkability is quite good. Overall Pumking is an really well-crafted example of the style. Recommended."
"Overall-BIG pumpkin beer, tasty and tastes like real pumpkin. At the same time, I could have used a bit more in the aroma, I'm not entirely sure what (more spice?), but it didn't quite do it for me. Otherwise, I found this to be an extremely pleasant sipper, and absolutely perfect for a cold fall day."
"Drinkability: This is an excellent beer. Big spicy pumpkin flavor with balanced sweetness and concealed alcohol. My favorite pumpkin beer to date."
"Not the most drinkable beer in the world but it tastes great for the one or two glasses I can drink."
"Unique and definately worth a try. Pumpkin Ale on steroids."
"I am growing fonder and fonder of southern tier."
"Pours a deep copper/Orange, with a thick lasting head, It took several """sniffs""" before I could come up with the Aroma, It has the Spice, but also the smell of pumpkin, like when I carve them at Halloween. And the smell I couldn't figure out was Graham Crackers. I told my friends that and they thought I was nut's. But I looked at some other reviews, and they said the same thing. Nice Balance of Pumpkin and Spice, and unlike other Pumpkin beers, this really stays good all the way through to the end, I think I like a more Spiced beer, but this was a top 5 Pumpkin Beer."
"It poured very nicely to a bright orange unlike any beer I've had before. It poured with a thick, creamy head that slowly went away. Smell; this was the first pumpkin beer I've had, so I was completely shocked by how pumpkin pie-like it smelled. It was sweet with the accents of various spices. A real treat. Tastes excellent. Simply excellent. Pumpkin pie; pumpkins, definitely some nutmeg and spices more in the taste than the smell. A great background to the beer also. Mouthfeel is a bit dry, but light and smooth. Overall an excellent brew to drink, especially this time of year. It really gives you the feel of the Fall. I look forward to getting more for the holidays."
"D - This beer has the most remarkably realistic pumpkin pie aroma I have ever encountered. Most pumpkin ales taste like bad spice soup while some manage to become an interesting combination of malt and spice, but none ever really smell like pie, at best they smell like something that can remind one of pumpkin pie when the idea is suggested beforehand. This beer on the other hand is really something extraordinary, it truly smells like home made pumpkin pie, right down to the bready note of pie crust. This aroma is remarkable and quite pleasant, but I am still not sure it makes for a good beer. The flavor is a bit of a mess with heavy toast and musty hops that just don't make me feel like I want to finish the bomber sitting in front of me. In the end, I have to regard this as an interesting technical exercise rather than a normal beer. The aroma is genuinely impressive and my hat is off to the brewer for their achievement, but the beer just isn't all that pleasant to drink. This beer is a must try, but at the same time not one that I would drink again."
"Pumpkin beers aren't for everyone, but """Pumpking""" even perked the interest of my hophead friend. Southern Tier is the Jelly Belly of brewing with their amazing flavors. This pours with a perfect burnt orange tone as if it were straight out of the patch. It has a sugar/spice pumpkin scent that stirs up Trick or treat nostalgia and has a taste to match that emotion. It finishes off with a spicy malt feeling on the tongue. Southern Tier has created a real treat here that I highly recommended this season."
"All together and Southern Tier has put together a heavy weight pumpkin ale that I'd buy again without hesitation."
"This is one of the most drinkable pumpkin beers I have had and is quite good. Very different from a lot of other ones in that the spice is not the main flavor component. I think I may have to look into getting another bomber of this."
"D: This is one of the more interesting takes on a pumpkin beer I've had. They didn't go for the pumpkin pie flavor that many breweries do by adding spices. According to the bottle it's only malts, pumpkin and hops. The pumpkin flavor on it's own is harder to pick out than that of the spices associated with the pie. Overall though I found this beer enjoyable once I got past my expectation of """pie""" flavor."
"D - like drinking a pumpkin pie could have this all night in fact im writing this review from notes i scribbled down and i am craving this beer"
"Pours a vivid orange color with nice 1/2 inch white head that dissipated quickly. Smell is filled with pumpkin up front. In fact of all the pumpkin beers I've tried this has the most up front pumpkin smell. Plenty of spice present as well with some vanilla present as well. Taste is in keeping with aroma. More pumpkin forward than I was expecting in taste as well. Has a nice spice mix to balance the pumpkin. I like the creaminess as well, really feels almost like a hint of whipped cream is there. Alcohol is well masked considering the ABV and the beer goes down easy. Can't say that I would want the entire 22oz beer myself, but it's perfect for sharing the bomber. Definitely going to pick up some to cellar for Thanksgiving."
"D- I would never be able to tell you that this is 9%. Great flavors and a nice balance make this a pretty good beer. I can't wait for Thanksgiving to break one of these out."
"I was very excited to find this at one of my local stores, so I bought four of them. With a good amount of anticipation, I poured this and found the appearance to be average. It is a very light amber orange color with a 1 inch white foamy head. The smell was unique and not what I expected. I thought I would get more of that spicy cinnamon pumpkin / seasonal smell. Instead, it smelled more like fresh pumpkin. First taste was really nice. It tasted exactly like it smells and I really enjoyed that fresh pumpkin flavor. But, after about half a pint, I grew tired of the taste and decided the pumpkin was overwhelming. I let it sit for a while, cleansed my palate and dove back in. Again, after a few sips I was tired of it. How am I going to finish this bomber? At least it was smooth and the carbonation was just right. I just poured the rest of the bomber into my glass and have half a pint left. I'm not certain I will finish but I am glad to have tried Pumpking."
"Drinkable? Hell yeah, in the same way that warm pumpkin pie is eatable. One good sized beer, though and you're done. Too sweet and desert like for more than one at a time."
"I saw some recent poor reviews of this beer, but I've had many pumpkin ales this year that were reportedly """great", but which I felt were passe. If you're looking to drink pumpkin beer all day long, look elsewhere, but if you want a single, unique pumpkin beer, give it a shot."
"Forget the ASTMD really... last year was a huge smell of pumpkin pie.. great buttery sweet taste.. a real treat.. this year i've drainpoured it a couple of times after a couple of sips... i was so heartbroken this year i didn't want to stop trying it after the first couple of disasters... but now it's been too many and i guess i have to let go... all the magic is gone, the great pumking is just a shadow of a memory!! : ("
"Bottle. Whoa, yippee! a pumpkin beer. Pours a clear reddish hued golden color with a very slight head. Strong smell of pumpkin, nutmeg, and graham crackers. Its a weird beer for sure for me. It tastes like pumpkin pie that is not very sweet and a few days past its prime. I really don't understand the love for this beer. Sweet malty upfront flavor followed by an odd pumpkin spice kick at the end that lingers far too long. Medium mouthfeel."
"I don't know why this beer is rated so high. I think this is a terrible example of pumpkin ale. Shipyard Pumpkin Ale may actually be better than this..."
"Drinkability is still limited to one bomber. I would like to see a 4 pack of 7 oz beers that southern tier would release. This is meant to be split."
"Autumn is my favorite season, in part, because of all things pumpkin (ale, pie, muffins, pancakes, etc.). Southern Tier's Pumking is certainly one of my favorite Fall seasonals and probably tops in the pumpkin category."
"A: The head is somewhat thick and slightly rocky, good head retention, medium orange in color and crystal clear - 4.00, S: The nose is truly the essence of pumpkin pie, a creamy aroma complete with all the standard spices, thick and sweet - 4.50, T: Like the nose Pumking's flavor has an uncanny resemblance to pumpkin pie, at 9% the alcohol is perceptible but generally very nicely masked, there is a sharp bite on the tail end of the taste that shows hops are in there, very sweet and with unmistakable nutmeg and vanilla with a touch of cinnamon, very nice palate - 4.50, M: The mouth feel of Pumking has some body to it - 4.00, D: An exceptional pumpkin ale, truly catches the heart of what a the style should be, worthy of seeking out, great holiday beer - 4.50"
"D-this is such a hit or miss style with me (mostly miss). I have to say that I like this version. Not heavy on the spices. Its pumpkin flavor guys not pumpkin pie flavor. Great beer with Thanksgiving food, if I can get it then."
"S - Personally, I thought it was a mildly, nutmeg/clove spiced aroma, strong notes of pumpkin, with a hint of """roasted-ness""" up front. However, in the back, the tase became breadier. I like the idea of fresh baked cookies, but this might be a stretch."
"D: This is pretty good and I'm glad I have a few more to tide me over for the next few months. I hope to drink this every autumn."
"D- Not the easiest beer to drink. Very sweet, almost have to drink it as a desert. Not easy to drink a whole lot of this beer, but I would highly recommend trying it."
"D-This is an excellent pumpkin beer, probably the best smelling one by far. The beer loses points for the taste, too spicy which overpowers a lot of the taste."
"My god. This beer is phenomenal. They nailed it spot on with the name; it truly is the king of pumpkin beers."
"Drink is very great, one of the best fall beers I have ever had, if not the best!"
"D - In my opinion this is the pumpkin beer king. At 9% this one can get dangerous though."
"Overall, what is the point of a 9% pumpkin beer? I just couldn't figure it out. It's not bad, but it sure isn't something I will go and buy again. Just wasn't for me."
"M/D: Medium to full bodied, carbonation gives a slight prick on tongue. Drinkability is very nice. A more than solid representation of the style, though the taste was a slight light down after the amazing aroma."
"D- Drinkable Beer, but not the best of it's kind for sure. The Pumpkin flavour conflicts with the hoppy bitterness, and also some more spicy flavour (cinnamon, nutmeg etc.) would really pull the pumpkin out and make the hops less pronounced"
"For some reason, I remember last years version quite different (sweeter, fuller, more pumpkin)."
"D- doesnt get tiring at all for me , very possible others would find the pumpkin a drag after awhile but i enjoyed it throughout this bomber"
"mouthfeel is a bit thin (docked points there); moderatedly carbed. the kind of flavor-packed beer that, while bar-setting, you're good with the bomber. for my money, hands down the standard by which all pumpkin beers should be judged."
"How'd that pumpkin become king? I didn't vote for him... The brew pours a hazy orange amber topped by a finger of white foam. The nose is a panoply of brewing and baking scents: cinnamon, brown sugar, clove, pumpkin pie filling, nutmeg, pumpkin seeds, and Golden Grahams. Damn, this be smellin' good! The taste veers off this course a bit, holding notes of orange peel, brown sugar, pumpkin shell, potato skin, rye bread, and sour cream. It may not conform to the smell's template, but it really ain't too bad, either. The body is a light medium, with a moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, this is a solid punkin brew, one of the better I've yet had."
"Strong alcohol flavor yet very smooth and warming"
"Another good dessert type beer from Southern Tier!"
"Had this on-tap at Jacob Wirth tonight at the Harpoon event mishap. Poured a hazy burnt orange color with a tan head that was pretty small and faded fast. The color was great, but it loses some points for the lack of head formed. The smell was cinnamon and clove with a hint of vanilla and earthy pumpkin. Some molasses and brown sugar, too. The taste was much like the nose, but with the addition of sweet cream and a buttery malt flavor. The taste of this beer was exceptional. Mouthfeel was rich and viscous, velvety. Carbonated like others of the style, but much heavier overall, it drank like a stout. The great taste and feel to this one make it very enjoyable and the alcohol is very well hidden. This may be my favorite of this style yet."
"D: If you want to drink a pumpkin pie, this is it, though not quite as sweet. Overall, I was impressed."
"This beer is not quite the end all be all of pumpkin beer, though it is good. It pours with a orangish hue. The smell is of pumpkin and spices, but the taste is a bit more hoppy than the smell lets on. Nicely carbonated with a dry feel, though I could not imagine polishing off more than 1 bomber of these in an ever. Not bad if sought out for under 6$."
"D - finishing a bomber is near impossible. That would seem like finishing an entire pie."
"For me, this displaces DFH Punkin as the best pumpkin beer."
"I always look forward to pumpkin beers. I'm not as crazy about Pumking as some folks are, but I do enjoy it. Something about this seasons brew makes it slightly less enjoyable than last years version. Of the handful of pumpkin beers I've sampled this year I think Smuttynose has been my favorite."
"D - High spice level and ABV makes it more a sipper, but is thoroughly enjoyable and tasty. I do recall liking last years a bit more, but I'll still be picking up a few more."
"Bomber poured into a pint glass. This is a light amber/brown color... fizzy with medium head. Smells include sweet brown sugar, pumpkin, clove, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Taste is heavy on pumpkin and nutmeg.. light dashes of cinnamon and a slightly sour finish. Even though this is fairly strong it is hidden pretty well. Solid pumpkin beer."
"All in all, this is a great beer. One of the few that tastes better than it smells. It tastes just like a pumpkin pie. Awesome! You definitely have to try this one if you get the chance. Best pumpkin beer yet for me!"
"D- good beer, probably the best you can get for the style. Maybe a little too big...still a great beer"
"Drinkability is high. A bomber of this is not out of the question what so ever. Every sip warrants another."
"Pours a slight hazy burnt orange that is lighter in color than I would expect it to be. The head is a nice ecru froth that slowly fades away to never be seen from again. The smell is fantastic! It smells like pumpkin bread, it's making me salivate thinking about it right now. That translates into an aroma consisting of a bready yeast smell affixed with the actual pumpkin smell and the pumpkin spices which seem to be all-spice, nutmeg, clove, cinnamon and perhaps a hint of ginger. The taste however is a giant let down from the smell. While it's not foul in anyway I expected to drink pumpkin bread and I'm not, probably shoulda seen that from the color. The taste is clearly of the pumpkin mixed with a booze flavor that is more consistent with vodka than anything. After the pumpkin vodka flavor you get the aftertaste of the spices and that is all that you are left with. The carbonation is nice and crisp on the tongue which helps dilute the alcohol flavor. If you're in the mood for pumpkin ale definitely buy this, it's pretty damn good. I warn you, you must be in the mood for this to really dig it."
"D - being that it's so overwhelmingly pumpkin, I couldn't drink a lot at once. Nice treat this time of year."
"D- This has set the bar for pumpkin ales for me. An incredible beer, and one that I enjoyed a lot despite the fact that I normally stray away from this style."
"Notes: As I said, I taste so much ginger, but maybe I am just over-perceptive of it. I love pumpkin beers, but there is such a variety since they are all spiced, you have to find the ones you like. This one, while being highly regarded, just isn't for me. I still rated it fairly high, because it is a good beer and I don't want to punish it just because I don't like a certain ingredient."
"Poured from bottle into oerbier tulip. An amazing orange light copper color with a thin white head that settles to a ring. Smell is cinnamon, allspice, pumpkin, butter, light bread dough, a little brown sugar and some rosemary - not much hops. Taste follows smell, cinnamon and buttery dough followed by brown sugar and pumpkin. Not too sweet, not too spicy, this one is just right. Slight hop bitterness finishes. Mouth feel is a moderate carbonation, just enough to finish clean. For 9% and the given style this one is very drinkable. Not all of ST's beers hit the mark, but this one is good. My favorite pumpkin beer so far."
"A note to all the haters of Pumking.... You are analyzing too much into this. ST has crafted an ale that truly exhibits properties of what was intended... a pumpkin ale that is consistent to craft beer. To put this brew down is nothing more than some holier than though beer geek getting off on dissing a masterpiece. Great job ST"
"D: A bit strong, but very drinkable. Tasty, delicious and the smell is killer."
"Best pumpkin style beer I've had because when I think pumpkin ale I want the pumpkin flavor to pop and have the spices back it up, not the other way around. This one hits the nail on the head and has a great balance of pumpkin/spice and sweet/dryness."
"Definitely an upper-echelon pumpkin ale and well-worth grabbing a bottle and drinking one when the weather turns cooler."
"a dangerous beer, soooo tasty and the alcohol is hardly noticable. i could session this all night. this is unlike any pumpkin ale out there. an absolutly must try for the season."
"This is one of the best fall beers around. It is so unique and tasty, I think that any type of beer drinker should give it a shot."
"Maybe it was a bad batch or something because we could barely finish the beer it was so bad. I will defiantly be avoiding this beer in the future."
"D: I will finish this bomber, enjoy it, however, with all the pumpkin beers out there, i probably won't buy it again. It has nothing to do with the quality of the beer, it is a quality brew. Pumpkin beer is now everywhere and it is such a seasonal, nich beer that I will try a few and then get tired of the flavor profile. Overall, not bad at all!"
"I very much look forward to having this beer for the fall season and will miss it when it is gone."
"Overall, this is what pumpkin beers should really aspire to taste like. I saw this on tap and though I have generally despised pumpkin beers so far, I figured I'd give it a go since I've never seen it on tap near my hometown. I'm happy with my choice. I think if I were to go for another pumpkin beer in the future, I'd go for this one."
"truly is the pumking!!"
"D - All in all a nice pumpkin beer. Not quite what I was expecting (maybe a bit less bready taste?) but still, really good. Spices not quite strong enough in this one though."
"D: Sorry, Great Pumpkin Ale, this is still my fav"
"D- Could definitely have more of this, and I've already had a full bomber... Definitely a good/great pumpkin beer, one of the best I've had."
"My favorite pumpkin ale yet...I like it because it actually has some balls. It's good to have a higher alcohol alternative to all the low abv beers traditionally drunk in the autumn season. This beer was exactly what I was hoping for when I saw it in the store. Try it."
"By the way, I think the recommended serving temperature on the bottle, 40F, if way too cold. I drank today's sample from the refrigerator and let it warm up to about 60F before I finished it. This beer really comes to life at about 55 to 60F. The next one I'm trying straight from my basement, where it will be right around 60F to start."
"So, this is my first Pumpkin Ale. Pours a nice golden brown/copper color. Big head that decreased to just a film on top. Smelled very nice, nothing spectacular - a bit of pumpking in the smell. Taste - this is where I don't quite get it. I don't taste the pumpkin pie that a lot of people mention. Not that it's bad - I just don't taste pumpkin or anything other than a creamy beer with a light nice spice that was more noticable as it warmed. This is a very smooth beer, very, very enjoyable and it hides the 9% alcohol dangerously. This one could sneak up on you without you realizing. Also has a very, very creamy mouthfeel. This is the best part to me. I like this one better than any of the Octoberfests I've tried so far this year. Maybe pumpkin ales are the way to go for me in the fall. Actually I'd prefer this to most brown ales I've tried, too. Not something I'd crave all of the time but I felt like I could drink quite a few of these as long as I could stand up to the rather high alcohol content."
"Bravo Southern Tier on easily the best Pumpkin Beer I've ever had."
"D: This is definitely an upper tier pumpkin ale. I am a big fan of pumpkin beers and this has a nice distinctive taste to it and at 9% abv, it's one of the stronger ones out there but doesn't have a hint of alcohol taste. I had to search for this beer and it was definitely worth it, a must try pumpkin ale."
"Bottle says to pour into a goblet so I obey and this produces a crappy head and still looking beer (however maybe its suppose to look this way). The color is real lovely coppor orange tone. Smells like spices, vanilla, cinnamon and pumpkin. Nice rich taste from the caramel malts and assertive hopping. Great spice flavor without being overwhelming and a nice pumpkinn flavor on the finish. Feels nice a thick on the palate. This is probably the single most drinkable pumpkin ale I have ever had, bring it on."
"I had to dock a point for the cloying aftertaste. 22oz is too much for this brew. I'd love to see it in a four pack. Until then, find a friend or two to split the bomber with. Solid pumpkin brew, taken in small quantities."
"D: Easily my favorite pumpkin beer. So happy to see this sold in Maine now. Some alcohol comes through but it's really not that bad considering the ABV. Second half of the bottle was a little cloying, but that's too be expected as normally I would only drink one glass in a sitting. Recommended"
"D: Goes down easy for a big beer. It nails the pumpkin flavor but if the spices were stronger and more complex, it would really go to the next level."
"D- Overall, Pumking is without question towards the top of my list of pumpkin beers. If you are a fan of the style, this one is a must try."
"Drinkability - Should have bought more than one. Shared the bottle, should have kept it for myself."
"This bottle definitely did not have the standout """pumpkin pie""" aroma or taste that was present in other reviews. Another week or two might have brought down the diacetyl presence and imparted more of the pumpkin flavor. Was still a nice brew, will go back for more."
"Overall this is an absolutely awesome pumpkin beer. A great dessert beer, but careful not to get overloaded on spices and pumpkin."
"Pours a clear medium orange color with one finger foamy white head, couple spots of lace. Smell: canned pumpkin ready for making pie, a little spicy hop, pale malt, and pie crust (!?). Taste: pumpkin pie if you left out some of the sugar...similar to a belgian pale with a bunch of pumpkin dumped in. Pretty great. Drying, pie spice finish."
"D- The ABV on this one almost limits it. Almost. Like I said earlier this beer ranks number 2 for me in the pumpkin beer catagory. Go Southern Tier!"
"I definitely have to be in the right mood to enjoy a pumpkin ale, but as far as rating per style, this one hits the nail on the head, and is very drinkable. Though the transition from sweet malty pumpkin and spice notes to the bitter finish keep this from getting a better grade."
"D- fairly easy to drink, i'll be honest I am not a huge fan or anything pumpkin, however this is a very tasty well crafted beer, it's a nice one as the weather changes and heads into fall"
"Overall, per style, I now know why this beer is rated so damn high on the site.... great pumpkin beer and I will easily come back to this one year after year"
"Draft. Pale orange like an unripe loquat. Smells just like a pumpkin pie. Taste like a pumpkin pie with a lot of spices. Nutmeg is the strongest spice with some other maybe vanilla and cinnamon included. Has a sweet imperial aftertaste, but the mouthfeel is light to medium mouth feel. It was good and I was ready for it in September. It might be a little much in November. Don't know how many of these I can drink in a season...but the first one was very tasty."
"Drinkability I rated somewhat low, cause it's so spicy and flavorful, you can only have one or two."
"I liked the beer."
"One of the best Fall beers made. Period."
"D: If you like all that """pumpkin pie""" spicing in your pumpkin ales, this one might not be for you. I applaud Southern Tier for being able to create a flavorful, 9% ABV ale that had a true pumpkin flavor rather than just spices and vanilla. I'll likely pick up another bomber for the season."
"Seriously what was so WRONG about the previous years recipe? And why is everyone hopping the crap out of pumpkin beers? If this doesn't change I may swear myself off the style altogether..."
"This one is okay not sure if I would have again other than at a thanksgiving meal. It is just like previous reviewers have said pure pumpkin pie."
"I am glad i split it with a friend it would've been hard to finish... I felt like I was drinking on my mother's favorite Yankee candle... though I can see why people may like this beer and find it interesting I'm much happier with Akron's Pumpkin Ales at my disposal"
"D - Pretty low. I had trouble just finishing my first glass, and I struggled to polish off the bomber. A 12 ounce pour of this beer after dinner would be about perfect but the sweetness and warming alcohol make this very hard to finish a bomber. Another example of the large bottle format detracting from a beer."
"Overall: I know I'm copping out, but I really want to try this one again next to Schlafly's. My wife likes Schlafly's better, but I'm still not sure. The nose on this one alone may put it over the edge."
"D: Drinkable for the style but still 1 bomb is good for me. This is the best pumpkin beer out. Beware do not let this beer warm though because the alcohol becomes too prominent."
"d - A really good pumpkin ale. I thought it smelled amazing, but wish the taste was a little sweeter as opposed to spicey. Never the less, a great fall beer I will definitely have again."
"The best pumpkin beer in the world."
"I have to say that this is only my second experience with pumpkin ales. So, maybe I just don't get it yet. I may try this beer again if I see it on tap but probably won't by it in the bottle again."
"Pretty surprised by how much I enjoyed this. Pumpkin ales usually not my thing and most of ST beers I find undrinkable. Actually this is the best ST brew I've had."
"Overall, I was always hard on pumpkin beers, but this one is actually a quality beer. By far the best pumpkin beer I've had. A great beer for the season. Will have again for sure."
"Southern Tier knocks this one out of the park. Truly the best pumpkin beer I've ever had, and quite possibly one of the best beers in general. If you don't like pumpkin brews, this may not be for you. But damn is this delicious!"
"Talk about a let down. I hope last year's wasn't like this ( 7.2% last year? ) because this surely failed to live up to the hype. I will never buy this beer for personal drinking again. Ever. If all I did was smell this, awesome. Too bad I had to drink it. It has a distracting heat, flavor, and feeling."
"This might be a beer I need to review again, in say about a year after I've sampled many different pumpkin ales."
"D- well I'm in quite the pickle here. This is tasty and a very good pumpkin ale. My problem is this beer used to be so much better. The first time around this stuff was damn near a stout now its like a pumpkin ipa. Is it still the best pumpkin ale out there, yes. Just a shadow of its former self. Such a shame."
"Medium bodied with assertive alcohol on the tongue, but not overpowering. Bitter finish due to the hops. Drinkability is pretty good. I know people say how """the alcohol was barely noticeable""" all the time, but in this case it is true. It tasted closer to 7% than 9%... Two bombers over the course of an evening would be doable."
"D - Extremely drinkable and hard to tell that its 9%."
"Wow - I like this style brew. It certainly isn't my favorite style to indulge in, it has its place for sure. To me this (so far), is the best I have had of this style. Not overdone, perfectly drinkable and very tasty. Try a few every year to usher in the fall season. Very good stuff."
"Absolutely love this beer. Smell and taste of pumpkin, which so delicious. The taste of pumpkin actually makes you want to drink more and more. Unfortunately this beer is 9% ABV, so drinking a couple you will be completely wasted. Worth it to taste and worth it to smell this pumpkin ale. No other beer like it."
"Notes: With the high ratings this beer gets I was shocked at how underwhelming I found it. I DO like pumpkin beers. DFH Punkin Ale and Brooklyn's Post Road are great. I just found this one to be lacking. I expect more sweetness and boldness of flavors in a pumpkin beer and this one had neither. I may try it again though. Perhaps I just had a bad bottle."
"I will be buying a case or two or three of this, to last me until next year."
"D: one bottle as a treat is a pleasure to drink, would not drink all the time but one or two bottles a year, will do, The best pumpkin beer i have ever had."
"D- doesn't go down too quick (which is probably good @9%) but is definitely drinkable as a dessert/seasonal brew. Obviously not intended for every occasion."
"Drinkability: Highly drinkable, will be drinking as much of this as I can over the next couple of months."
"When/if you find this on your shelves, give it a whirl. You won't be disappointed."
"I loved this brew."
"drinkability is a fail for me. pumpkin puree makes this suck."
"Oh, pumpkin beers. This one fails to break the mold of similar brews which consistently disappoint me."
"Drinkability: This is a fantastic brew- the alcohol is well-masked, and the flavors are intense but all of them work well together, while the high ABV is well masked. One of the most beautiful brewing masterpieces to ever pass my lips. I have liked the other pumpkin beers I have tried, but this one is by far the best- not only is this a great pumpkin beer, it is just a great beer. I will be enjoying this one all Autumn long, but as soon as fall turns to winter, I don't know what I'll do about the cravings I will inevitably have."
"D: Very complete pumpkin beer. Other years have been a little too candy-like and this years higher abv is unnoticeable."
"Overall- In my opinion this is the best pumpkin ale out there. Bought plenty of this to get me through the fall this year. This should mellow out a bit and probably improve in a few months."
"Now!"
"drinkability: great pumpkin beer, probably one of the best I have had. Amazing nose and flavor."
"There are way better pumpkin beers out there. This one is like a candy bar that happens to have 9% abv."
"D: Well, the 9% abv does not come through at all; it is quite sweet, but it is a very nice dessert beer and tremendously better than any other other pumpkin beer I've tried. It is also a nice change from other dessert type beers like imperial stouts and barleywines."
"Salud!"
"D: The beer is not quite what I expected from Southern Tier. It's a good pumpkin beer, and it smells pretty good, the taste is alright but I feel it should be sweeter or spicier. They definitely have the """pumpkin""" part down. It doesn't seem to """meld""" well with itself enough to be a constant drinker."
"Pours a light brown/amber with an off-white head. Smells of pumpkin pie, cinnamon and spices. Big flavor. Graham cracker, pumpkin pie and vanilla are the most dominant. Very well done. Hints of cinnamon, all spice and brown sugar as well. Slight hops and a bit of an alcohol warming as well. Very sweet beer. Creamy mouthfeel and very rich."
"O: Not my favorite Southern Tier selection by a long shot, and not my favorite pumpkin beer either. Still, this beer is quite respectable and may improve over time."
"I will be picking up a few to cellar for the holidays!"
"D- Man, I dont know what I was thinking last time I had this. This stuff is incredible. I need to stock up..."
"One of the more intense pumkin ales I've gotten my hands on, and it's definitely not disappointing! Smells like Halloween. Delicious spicy scent of nutmeg, exactly like some tasty pumpkin pie. Taste pretty much follows suit. Doesn't taste anything like your typical beer, but it's something to be sought out in its own right. An autumnal treat to be savored. Really enjoyable, very mealy, wouldn't want more than the 22 oz bottle I had, but thoroughly loved what I did have. A great pumpkin ale."
"Drinkability: I really didn't like this beer. It's far too sweet and nothing like you would imagine it to be, being an imperial pumpkin. It doesn't feature enough pumpkin or spices. I'd recommend anything that isn't Pumking. This beer could give you diabetes."
"D: 4.5"
"D: I dig this. I would drink a ton of this if it were available in the Bay Area."
"Enjoyable but the mouthfeel could use some work."
"D: similar fate as the mouthfeel. For me, just like with actual pumpkin pie, only with an extra pound of sugar mixed in."
"O- Weird beer, wonder if it was better fresh?"
"It also has a hefty """physicality""" to it, that makes it seem almost as if it is filled with pumpkin bits."
"Taste has mellowed out and melded together a bit over the past 7 months, which is a good thing when having so many of them in the cellar. Having said that, I do not see it improving much more and a fresh Pumking around Halloween will be better than a year old version. The spices are there aplenty, with nutmeg and allspice leading the way but I am sure there is a gaggle of others tagging along for the ride...perhaps some mace and cinnamon. Caramely malts have a hint of toast, but this still remains one of the sweetest beers I have ever had. A bomber is almost too much to handle by myself. Not that there isnt some hops in here, there is on the finish and combine with the spices to dry things out a bit. But, wow...talk about a dessert beer. Very good brew, and one of the most unique and finest examples of the style. Every beer lover should get the opportunity to try this concoction at least once!"
"Overall - This is a different beast from the bottle than on tap. Much better on tap IMO."
"M/D - Very good brew from Southern Tier, one of my favorite pumpkin brews, sold spices mixed with caramel and malts, a for sure pick up. I will get this again!!!"
"Drinkability: This beer screams fall, and I can't imagine drinking anything else but this delicious beer fresh off tap during the fall season. Pairs great with most of the food of the season as well. Probably the best pumpkin ale I've ever had the pleasure of drinking."
"Best pumpkin ale out there (that I've had). Nice and big, with hops, with actual pumpkin, with 8% alc. Great fall/winter brew. One i will look for every year."
"D - I'm not a pumpkin pie fan, but this is really, really good and by far the best pumpkin beer I've ever had. Amazingly smooth for its ABV, too - I had NO idea this was 9%... until I was about halfway into the large bottle."
"Drinkability:"
"I have wanted to try this one for a very long time. I am not usually a big fan of pumpkin beers but I really hope this one wins me over. Body is a glowing orange amber that hosts a two finger frothy light beige head that has decent retention but leaves no lace. Nose is absolutely delicious by itself with distinctive tones of pumpkin bread and creamy eggnog. With first sip you get a very soft pumpkin profile, not harsh at all. Sweet bready notes are all over the tongue. A dusting of cinnamon and graham crackers are easy to pick up on the sides and back of the tongue. This beer is velvety for the style and a lot like cake as it provokes thoughts of desert. Mouthfeel is very much like sweet dough with a hint of spice. This beer is so lovely drinkable, be it somewhat thick and sweet. I wish I had a bunch of this in the cellar for the holiday for many years to come."
"Overall I love the taste and smell of this beer, if they can add better head retention to it this could easily move way up my list. A little whipped cream with the pumpkin pie would be awesome."
"Bottle. Many thanks to Hogtownharry for this one. Very nice appearance, bright orange pour, with a bit of white head. Lots of pumpkin in the aroma, a hint of spice (gingerbread), something roasted about it too, pumpkin pie. Taste is very desert, pumpkin pie, not very sweet with definite alcohol presence. Mouthfeel is quite full a little too aggressive."
"I'm glad I split this with my dad the day after Thanksgiving. Next year I'll try it again. Not very drinkable to me."
"A very smooth mouthfeel, creamy like a cream sickle but frothy like a spiced pumpkin cider. I often avoid pumpkin beer, but Pumpking will get a repeat visit from this avid fan of Southern Tier who is being won over to such alternative Fall beverages. Terrific stuff."
"Definately worth a try but overall this is not much more than a novelty beer, a good one though. that said, 22 ounces was plenty...time to move on now."
"Overall, this will be a hard one to finish, I have had several and usually mix with Boulevard Wheat to thin out the cloying flavors. OK, but not as good as last year."
"I don't find it as harmonized and smooth as it should be."
"for us dutch its a strange beer we dont taste pumkin that mutch."
"Pumking is THE king of pumpkin beers in my opinion. I like plenty, but love few, of this unique but often overly perfumed and overly spiced style. Southern Tier's offering appeals to me because, despite the distinct pumpkin-pie flavouring and spices and high alcohol, it drinks just like an easily quaffed, quality IPA. I cannot recommend it enough."
"Pours orange with a small white head. Aroma is strong pumpkin with caramel malt and toasted malt. Very inviting. The flavor is very strong, with pumpkin and pumpkin pie spices (cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice and ginger). The spice gets less apparent as it warms up. The beer is very sweet and has a creamy mouthfeel. Medium mouthfeel and low carbonation. Best pumpkin ale I have ever tried."
"Poured out a nice copper color into my glass. Smells like I am about to drink a pumpkin pie. Taste just like it smells, right up front is the pumpkin pie filling. followed by the taste of the graham cracker crust and then a subtle finish of the whipped topping(vanilla). Just sweeps across the tongue. I can do a bottle but after that it would be hard to try and do another. Great a bottle at a time but anything more might be to much for me."
"D: So easy to put down."
"O. I would say it's arguably the best Pumpkin Ale I've had."
"Drinkabiliy is average, I do rate on a curve with imperials with tons of forward flavor, but lacks the allure of others I have had due to it's extreme nature."
"This beer is a gem, comming from a guy who has drank a ton of Pumpkin Ales and haven't enjoyed many."
"D: For the money I don't think there's a better pumpkin/fall spiced beer out there. I've had many, especially those that are more prominent on the pumpkin flavor, but this beer just seems to do it *right* in so many ways that I keep coming back to it each year. Truly a fall treat to look forward to as summer draws to a close."
"Overall, a great smelling pumpkin beer that is the best tasting one I've had yet. The heavy spices took down the taste and mouthfeel somewhat. Recommend as it's the best pumpkin ale that I've had. Rotation: not avail TX - got in trade. As said before, not a huge fan of the style and generally only have 1-2 per year so won't be a player in the rotation. Would try on-tap though."
"Drinkability: Not bad, but it didn't live up to the hype for me and I have definitely had better offerings over the course of the season; that strange metallic bitterness really is the overall downer to it."
"Pours a pumpkin orange with a quickly dissipating white froth and decent lacing. Strong roasted aromas of nutmeg, cinnamon, roasted hazelnuts, cloves, cooked pumpkin, & grains are followed by flavors of vanilla, roasted nuts, spices, & a hint of molasses. There is a bit of heat on the back end. Definitely a food beer, although you can absolutely have this for a meal instead. Overall a good & roasty beer that, unfortunately, I find over spiced. I was really looking for a better/thicker mouthfeel and a more profound pumpkin presence. I had found a lot of hype surrounding this beer and I felt a little let down. It's good, but not worth the hype in my opinion."
"D: This is up there with DFH Punkin as one of the better pumpkin beers that I've had. It excels in the body aspect and is much richer and fuller compared to a host of others. Definitely worth seeking out and worth a try."
"D- Easily quaffable, but the flavors are best revealed when sipped. I think that the richness of this beer makes it best for just one or two glasses before moving on to another style."
"Side Note: This beer pairs wonderfully with homemade pumpkin pie!"
"The Imperial Pumpkin pours a brilliant orange color with a 2 finger lacy head that hangs atop. Lots of carbonated bubbles are present. Nose is spiced nutmeg, cinnamon, and of course, pumpkin. Taste is similar to the nose but what really surprised me is how smooth this is with the 9% abv punch. No alcohol is noted in the quaff and the taste is very complex and nice. Mouth is medium body and drinkability is solid. I love the taste and the big punch it carries. This is my time of year and def my type of beer."
"Draft @ Sierra. Amazing bright orange color with aromas of rich spice, nutmeg and pumpkin... almost creamy nose. The palate follows perfectly with those notes and is the best pumpkin I've had yet. Liquid pumpkin pie like mom used to make. SO rich and flavorful that I couldn't get over how this was the best fall beer to date. Nothing cloying or harsh about it. Viva la Fall!"
"It's a festive tasting drink. I'd say it was probably more vanilla and clove than pumpkin but whatever - I'm not pumpkin loyal! It was nice to try it. We are all better off for people like Southern Tier trying new stuff out but having said that, I don't think I want to have another. It's definitely a taste thing - I'm sure plenty of folks will enjoy this."
"D: Flavorful, goes down ok, not too filling, strong kick, decent representation of style, I can where some people might like this beer as it's quite different from other Pumpkin ales, but I just did not like the beer very much."
"Drinkability:I've had this before and probably will again. A very unique pumpkin brew. Kind of in it's own league. This brew is really growing on me. Glad I didn't review it earlier."
"Drinks very well and is undoubtedly enjoyable. Alcohol seems to be masked and delivers no ill effect from the higher abv pumpkin ale. In the top two in the category if you ask me."
"Medium bodied with a huge spicy pumpkin pie flavor. Lots of cinnamon, brown sugar, clove ginger, nutmeg and a very strong pumpkin presence. There's a slight touch of vanilla and some sweet/caramel malt. The ABV is extremely well masked without even a slight touch of alcohol heat making it extremely quaffable. Probably the best example of the style I've had yet."
"this beer looks like pumpkin pie. the head looks like whipped cream on top of pumpkin pie. this beer smells like pumpkin pie. this beer tastes like pumpkin pie. in my mouth, this beer feels like pumpkin pie. if you like pumpkin pie, you will like this beer. if you do not like pumpkin pie, you will not like this beer. i really like pumpkin pie, so i really like this beer."
"Poured from a 22oz. bottle, the color is an amber-orange with a small to medium head that is very cloying to the glass. The smell is immediately pumpkin with ginger, cinnamon, allspice. Upon first taste you can taste and smell all the spices and pumpkin but it's the aftertaste that gets the win here. About 2 seconds in you start to taste gingerbread/graham cracker crust of the pie. The aftertaste is even more pleasing, leaving you feeling like you just ate a slice of pumpkin pie. Mouthfeel is heavy and thick but not overwhelming. Drinkability is extremely high as are most of Southern Tier products. This is top shelf right here, arguably the best pumpkin ale out today!"
"Drinkability pretty high. Nice pumpkin beer overall, but maybe not quite the king of pumps (or pums I guess - what happened to the other P?)."
"Drinkability: I would have this again although just another one, and Would recommend this to someone who enjoys a liquid pumpkin pie."
"This is, by far, the best pumpkin beer I've ever had. It is so warming...the alcohol is perfectly balanced with the malts and spices...it is completely drinkable, and one that, when it's gone, I wish I had more."
"-i think i might like it more if it had a different name. overall, i dont think i could drink a whole one to myself"
"It is true that this beer has an interesting, unique flavor compared to other pumpkin beers. I would call it more sugary than pumpkiny/spicy. There are other pumpkin beers that taste much more like pumpkin to me. The sugar taste in front and hops at the back just didn't combine in a pleasing way for me."
"D:"
"Notes: I've had my share of pumpkin pies, maybe not enough, and I rather like them. But this one is certainly not close to anything I've tasted before. It's as if the cook dropped the whole jar of spices and a pack sugar by accident and let them roll. I like what ST does with this provocative beer that often are hit or miss for drinkers. This is the first one that is a miss for me. I don't know how to use it... It could be a dessert beer but I don't have the audience that would like this type of highly spiced flavor for a pumpkin pie. Not a bad ale but it's not much of a pleasing brew for me, and I'd rather choose quite a few other pumpkin beers ahead of this one."
"Light-medium body, and I'd almost call it undercarbonated, and a little thin. That said, it's still incredibly easy to drink for a beer weighing in at 9%. Very good pumpkin beer, but I've got to give the title to Smuttynose."
"Although it's Imperial it doesn't feel or taste like a big beer. It's very smooth, I feel as if I could drink a six pack easily."
"It was served with a finger of foamy, bubbling ecru head that quickly gave way to wispiness. Color was a (fittingly) orangish deep-amber with NE-quality clarity. Nose was like sniffing a pumpkin pie fresh out of the oven: cinnamon, clove, and nutmeg. It was like Hallowe'en in a glass. Mouthfeel was full, almost creamy in its texture. The interplay of the spices on the tongue was simply heavenly. If I closed my eyes, I could envision Thanksgiving dessert. Therein lies its Achilles heel - it is a novelty/dessert beer. It is too sweet to be sessionable, but it is a treat while it is available. Get some today! May I die in the early Spring so as not to miss out."
"Drinkability: Believe the hype, this is the best pumpkin ale there is. It tastes like pumpkin pie, and despite the high ABV remains light and smooth. Delicious."
"D: This beer is a special treat and a great beverage for Halloween. It is delicious, but the flavor can get overwhelming over the course of 22oz, this one is better to share and enjoy in small servings."
"I've been saving this one in my basement for quite a while and it has definately aged nicely. Without knowing what it's like fresh or having a date on the bottle, one can only guess. One thing is clear, though. This is a great pumpkin ale."
"I suspect this is a very fine example for the style. I admit I don't care for the style, but tried to rate according to style. This is clearly a well-crafted beer, and I am glad for the diversity. I will stick to pumpkin pies and sweet breads."
"D: I could definitely drink a bunch of these. Nice and crisp and it really does taste like pumpkin pie. If you don't really like pumpkin, I can see one not really liking this. However, for anyone that loves pumpkin pie or similarly flavored things, definitely try this. You will love it. Happy Halloween!"
"Overall- best pumpkin brew i ever had. highly recommend anyone who wants a nice hearty halloween treat."
"Cheers!"
"D- Good for a very heavy beer. Could drink a few of these, but then may get hit by the alcohol train a half hour later."
"Drinkability: This is very good an interesting for the style. One of my favorites in the style. I love the vanilla in the beer and the strong hops bring something new to the table. I could have a couple a season. Big points for making a pumpkin beer complex."
"they say 'Why are you dressed like it's Halloween?""" - Ministry"
"D - Flavors are just a bit overwhelming to call this a session beer. That and the high abv, makes me think this is a one and done beer. Also, the well hidden bitterness eventually builds up on you. Not to say that every drink isn't pleasurable, but rather a night cap beer to go with desert."
"This is the pumpkin beer by which all others should be measured. It's rich amber color is warm and inviting. The aroma let out becons memories of thanksgiving desserts past. Some may say it is too sweet for a food pairing, but I disagree. The brewers at souther tier have found the perfect balance of spices and seasoning to make the Pumking by far the best seasonal brew i have ever tasted. It is in short supply for Rhode Island so the wife and I bought a case of 22's. I highly recommend picking up a bottle, if you can find it."
"Overall, this might possibly be the best pumpkin ale ever. It is definitely the best I have ever had. Great job Southern Tier. I'm glad I have another one of these in the cellar waiting for Halloween."
"Pumking has become my gold standard in the Pumpkin Ale category. It's tough to imagine a better one of its kind."
"Good carbonation in the mouthfeel. A tasty beer, drinkable for the bottle, but not like you could have many more."
"D- I could drink several pints of this beer with an easy drinking 9%ABV."
"There is a lot going on in this beer, but somehow it is all brought together into one excellent package, Try it."
"D: This is one strange beer. However, I must say I enjoyed it. It definitely achieves what it sets out to achieve - being one big pumpkin beer. I wouldn't want to drink a whole lot of it though, nor drink it very often."
"D- I only want one of these and I don't think I will be getting another. It is just too strong on the spices and sweetness. If you like sweet pumpkin pie, you will love this beer. If you like ale in its traditional fashion, you probably wont like this very much. Go get one and try it and decide for yourself."
"Love what Southern Tier's been doing with their Blackwaters, IPAs and this. Their beers are not for everyone, true, but I think they do well what some people look for."
"As far as drinkability, even though it's good...I find it hard to finish a whole bottle by myself. I rather share...it tends to be really sweet...and it gets a little overwelming as you try polishing a bottle in one sitting by yourself."
"A big, almost barleywine, with pumkin. A good winter (or fall) warmer. Lots of complexity."
"D- i could throw this back all day. I will venture to get a case of this eventually."
"This beer came pretty hyped. I don't think it's my thing. I think can appreciate what the brewer was going for, but I won't seek this out again. My personal taste will probably color the score a bit, but I tried to see it as it was intended. As I said, might be a good dessert with a hearty autumn meal, or while burning some leaves in the yard."
"I found this to be one of the more rewarding pumpkin beers I've had - it's the only imperial one I've had. I think that this and Punkin' from DFH are the class of this style. The smell and taste set this one apart."
"D: Quite drinkable and a very good pumkin brew, but the ABV does eventually catch up and there's only so much pumkin pie you can drink."
"Drinkability: I think it's pretty good, but its intensity, unfamiliarity and imperial ABV hold it back in my opinion."
"Drinkability: This is a well put together beer. The higher ABV is well hidden, but on a weeknight it's a bit limiting. I don't think I can handle more than one of these before having to hit the hay."
"The aroma is like alcoholic pumpkin pie. The pumpkin and spices come right through the caramel malt and alcohol. The appearance is orange gold with a foamy head that dwindles to nothing pretty fast. The flavor is like the aroma with a tad bit too much bitterness but still very good. The palate is smooth but not as thick as I had wanted it to be. Overall this is a great beer."
"I could never tell this one's has such a high ABV, which hinders the otherwise great drinkability. I like punkin, and I have issue with some other pumpkin beers I've tried in my search for """the one.""" This is it."
"One thing that bothers me, is that there are many pumpkin brews from the mid-west to the east coast... but not on the west coast, where I know a good many pumpkins and squash grow. It throws me off to say the least, and I can only imagine a Sauvie Island pumpkin seed pale or something of the sort here... in OR."
"Drinkability - While I feel this is one of the best pumpkin ales I've tasted, I'm not sure how much of it I could take. Hands down its what I had been looking for in taste and quality but after a while the novelty will wear off. However, the beer is exceptional and really a great pumpkin beer."
"Wouldn't plan on drinking a lot of this in one sitting, but will definately have it again."
"uscaptainsblog.blogspot.com"
"Southern Tier is usually top notch, but this is bottom shelf rail booze."
"Halfway through my half a bomber I looked forward to not having to drink this anymore."
"Very impressed. Will definitely be enjoying again this fall, provided that I can get my hands on it! Thinking about getting half a case for the family thanksgiving gathering... I could see this being a very approachable beer even for non craft enthusiasts."
"It loses some points for its drinkability, but gains em back with originality. The aromas and flavors are unique and incredible. Get some!"
"Overall: This is the best pumpkin beer out there!"
"Next..."
"Taste has more of that pie crust and bread flavor coming through. It is a sweet beer, however a nice balance for this style. Drinkability is slightly above average for what is an ideal dessert beer modeled around the taste of an autumn dessert. Drinkability is better than expected, the abv is fairly hidden in this pumpkin ale that Southern Tier which had been sitting in my cellar for a few weeks. I am glad that I finally cracked it open, might buy another before the time passes on by."
"Definitely the best pumpkin ale I've had to date. Something that actually tastes like pumpkin seems to be a difficult concept to grasp for some breweries, but Southern Tier manages to get it right with this flavorful brew. Something I'll very likely continue to have going into the fall months."
"Kind of an odd beer, in that it's so over the top, that it barely resembles beer anymore. Tastes good, but not balanced."
"D- It isn't bad, but the strange bitterness is sort of off putting."
"Drinkability: This is the most extreme pumpkin beer period. Love the idea but for me this almost vomit inducing. I couldn't fail this in a right mind because it could be appealing to some people and it accomplished its purpose but its impossible for me to drink."
"Great job by ST"
"This is a true pumpkin ale, definitely the best one I've had. It's also a damn fine beer. It's got a copper orange color with smallish head... the aroma is amazing. It smells like pumpkin cookies--cinnamon, nutmeg, and some bready sweetness underneath. The taste follows--cinnamon, nutmeg, a real pumpkin flavor (like pumpkin pulp), and a decent amount of leafy hops on the finish. Delicious beer, one of the most interesting I've had. Mouthfeel is a little thin, but this ups the drinkability. Just a fantastic fall beer. Nice work ST."
"One of the best and most balanced of the pumpkin beers I've ever had. A little less alcohol would have been so much more is taste though."
"If they could balance out that nutmeg finish, this would be the best pumpkin beer I've had."
"D - Pumking is easily the best pumpkin beer on the market. I can honestly say that nothing even comes close to this masterpiece (with perhaps the exception of Selin's Grove's pumpkin ale... but how many people have had that?)."
"D: One of my favourite pumpkin beers ever, Southern Tier is making some great stuff, wish I could get this around here."
"D: A great flavor and aroma, but like actual pumpkin pie, I'm not sure how much of this I could actually drink."
"Drinkability: Easily the best pumpkin beer I have had. Doesn't really seem like a beer, more like liquid pumpkin pie. However, between the alcohol and very un-beerlike taste, it is hard to drink too much."
"I applaud the creativity of this beer and the style in general. Very cool name."
"Drinks pretty darn easy, although I can feel the ABV asserting itself at the end. One of the better Pumpkin beers out there IMO"
"D- I'm not a big pumpkin beer drinker but this one does it for me. Balanced and not over spiced, I would definately sit down and have one of these a couple times each fall."
"Drinkability: Its a very strong flavor. Sweet, though not sickenly sweet, though it needs a point of savory to be more balanced. I think the beer is sweeter than pumpkin pie itself! Definitely a dessert beer. I dont think I could drink more than one, and at 9% ABV, I really shouldn't. After drinking a full glass, I can say that it is Way too sweet. I nearly poured it out."
"I'm impressed."
"D) A delicious brew. Not one that you chug. A slow sipper. Nice, easy and enjoyable."
"D: The 9% alcohol is extraordinarily well hidden, and my bomber disappeared in no time. One of the most easily drinkable high gravity brews I've ever had. If only this was available in my neck of the woods."
"Taste- With an amazing taste that follows the smell, it tastes just like moms pumpkin pie. The first sip to me was a bit overpowering, only because no beer i've come across has had this much pumpkin flavor, but after the first sip I knew what a pumpkin brew should taste like."
"Drinkability: Excellent for a pumpkin ale! Look, whoever is giving you advice like, """don't bother with Pumking""" is no friend of yours. Take your vengeful fists and clock that mofo in the mouth and spit on their prone, beaten body, because they aren't helping you at all. Oh, and Happy Halloween!!"
"This beer pours a a nice bright orangey copper color with a 1/2 finger of off white head that recedes rapidly, leaving wispy spotty lacing on the sides of the glass. The nose is amazing. I have to say, I just kept going back to smell this one before every sip..and sometimes just to smell it. Nose is mainly of pumpkin,butter, vanilla, and just the right amount of spices. Most pumpkin beers go all out with spices, but the spice are more a background hint in this beer. Taste is some caramel malts up front lending to a buttery, pumpkin flavoring, hint of vanilla mingle and finishes with a touch of nutmeg, more pumpkin and vanilla. Medium bodied, mild carbonation, nice creamy mouth feel, slightly oily in the finish. I like me some pumpkin beers, so I could session this one any day, any time."
"A one finger head right after the pour, that recedes to a small island of foam andring. Good medium copper hue with a very strong column of bubbling. The aroma is hearty pumpkin bread, strong malt notes and a well integrated pumpkin aroma. The taste is equally bready and pumpkin-ey, but with more emphasis on spices. Notes of numeg, cinnamon, and brown sugar come throuh in the middle. The finish is a dry, grainy pumpkin bread. Good sipping beer on a brisk october evening."
"On draft definitely prefered over bottle, but the best pumpkin beer available today regardless of the serving format."
"D: Very pleasantly surprised by this beer. Perhaps one of the best fall seasonal (pumpkin) beers I've tried. This is definitely a cookie or pie in a bottle going down easy without being cloying or overpowered by bitter cloves or cinnamon spice. A little too sweet to be a session beer (20oz was more than enough) but would definitely serve this at our annual pumpkin carving party as a specialty beer aimed at capturing a moment in time specific to the season. Nicely done considering it's intended purpose."
"Drinability: I was hopeful...and found this incredibly lacking."
"Absolutely the best Pumpkin beer I have ever had, and definitely one of the best Fall beers."
"D: Hands down the best pumpkin ale I have ever tasted. In spite of the abv, I could really sit back and enjoy a nice session with friends and family..."
"Overall, far and away the best pumpkin I have ever had. Big flavors and big ABV. A fragrant, flavorful and unique pumpkin brew. Highly recommended."
"Mouthfeel matches the flavor profile very well."
"D: Yeah, this one tastes just like pumpkin pie. I guess if that is what your looking for, this one more or less hits the nail on the head. However, I don't see it as much more than a novelty beer, one which I could possibly drink once a year, and even then, I think a bomber is too much."
"Wow I can see how that aroma came from the pumpkin in this flavor.. wow. Very smooth, lightly spiced if anything. Definitely a dessert beer... seems like the kind of an exotic taste you'd find in a dessert at a very upscale restaurant.. I don't think I've really had anything like it. By far the best use of pumpkin in a beer I've seen. I think you can sense the alcohol in this beer but there's not heat in the flavor.. I think this would make a wonderful liquor."
"Poured this into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass. Poured a golden orange color with a cream colored head. It had average lacing and a slight haze to it, but mostly clear. The smell was very good. A lot of pumpkin beers tend to just smell like beer with pumpkin pie spices, particularly nutmeg and cinnamon, this was a little different. It did have a sweet aroma to it, but you could actually smell pumpkin to it with some malts. Very nice, I really liked it. The taste is much like the smell, it has a very bold taste. Again you could taste the pumpkin, almost natural followed by some sweet hints of pumpkin pie spices. I would have given the taste a much higher rating but it had an earthy aftertaste that I wasn't very fond of. I found both the mouthfeel and drinkablility to be good. My wife and I split a 22.oz bomber after dinner and enjoyed it. A solid brew by Southern Tier."
"God bless you Southern Tier. One of the top 3 beers they brew."
"drinkability is ok - a bomber is more then i wanted - if only they put this in 12oz"
"The first half of the bottle is kind of boozy, as I said above. If you make it past that point though, this is easy-drinking and delicious."
"In conclusion, this is one of the finest - if not the best - pumpkin beer that I've ever had. And I base that on two things: one, it's more than just a spiced beer, it actually tastes like pumpkin, and secondly, it's not overly spiced. Worth trying."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass. Pours a burnt orange color with about a one finger white head. The head reduces to almost nothing pretty quickly and leaves little to no lacing at all down the sides of the glass. The smell right away is very strong, maybe one of the strongest I've come across for a pumpkin ale. Right away it's a strong scent of spices and pumpkin and just smells really great. The taste is the same, spices right away and pumpkin. The taste pretty much explodes in your mouth, one of the most pumpkiny beers I've had. I've heard this one is like drinking liquid pumpkin pie and now I believe it. Very flavorful, it's everything autumn in a beer. A high ABV one this one but I didn't notice it a bit. Highly drinkable, I'm going to pick up quite a few more to last me through autumn. Easily the best pumpkin ale I've had yet."
"Balance between moderate alcohol (don't mean to say that 9% is moderate, only that it is not overpowering in the mouth), moderate hops, and sweet, spicy, starchy malt is wonderful. Finishes well and retains its body throughout."
"Drinkability on this one is pretty good, but a bomber of this stuff might be too much. A very well crafted beer, in my opinion, but I don't know why they don't offer this in twelve ounce bottles; I'm someone who loves pumpkin-anything, and this is even a little much for me towards the end. Overall, I'd say this is a must for any pumpkin ale fan, but if you're looking for something with a more toned-down malt presence, you may want to look elsewhere."
"2009 batch. From the 650 ml. bottle. Sampled on September 29, 2009. There is a handsome, rich orange-amber pour but there is little to no head or retention. The aroma is clearly of pumpkin spices but there is a lot more to it including sweet brown sugar, malts, and maybe even some butternut squash. More creaminess to the mouthfeel but overall it tends to be heavier and appealing. The taste is quite unique. It has this odd mixture of sweet and sour like an Oriental restaurant. There is also a tartiness to the overall experience. This is quite unique and one of a kind. This also has a bit of a punch at 9% ABV. Highly recommended. Maybe another reviewer can get a better handle on what sensations affect the taste buds."
"this is not your typical pumpkin beer, actually this is not your typical BEER at all. appearance is semi normal, pretty golden orange copper, with a tiny head cap. smells of cookies and pumpkin pie. REAL pumpkin. it says right on the label that it is brewed with actual pumpkin and you can tell, and it is appriciated. taste is mainly sugar cookie up front. but you can definatley get the real pumpkin in the finish. this is the SWEETEST cookie.... i mean beer i have ever had in my life. mouthfeel is silky and smooth but drinkability is rough because of the insane amount of sweetness. i understand why people like it so much but for me, next time i open one i will be sharing the bomber with someone."
"With that said, this is the worst beer I've had in a while. The only redeeming quality is the appearance. If you've ever eaten a buttered popcorn flavored Jelly Belly, then you now know what to expect in both the nose and the tastejk. And it's not like it's in the background or anything. I can't find any pumpkin in the nose- only butter. There's a slight hint of spice and pumpkin on the back of the palate, but it's crushed by the rancid popcorn taste. I almost gagged. Perhaps I got a bad bottle, but I don't think I'm the only one who wonders where ST went wrong here."
"Amongst the pumpkin beers, I find myself liking some of the others much better (Weyerbacher Imperial Pumpkin for instance). I've tried this twice and each time came across not very impressed. Simply not my cup of tea."
"D- Very. Tastes great, but could see the abv catching up with you eventually"
"Poured from a Southern Tier bomber, and with the first whiff I could tell this would be another dessert beer. The beer is clear pale orange / pumpkin colored, with a whipped foamy head. The aroma is pure pumpkin pie, not just the spices but actual pumpkin in the pie. Sweet caramel malt, burnt sugar, ginger cookies. The taste is massively sweet, to the point of cloying, bitter on the back of the tongue, nearly undrinkable in its non-beerness. I've come to an understanding with Southern Tier beers, shy away from the ones with food in the name and definitely jump on the hoppy beers."
"Pours a two finger off-white head that fades quickly to a ring leaving no lace. Clear copper/amber color. Spicy sweet bread nose. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Flavor is sweet, cinnamon, pumpkin. Higher ABV is hidden. $6.49 for a 22oz bottle from Manchester Wine and Liquors Manchester, CT."
"Drinkability - Despite the artificial taste, this beer is easy going, could lead to a messy night as the alcohol is completely masked."
"Happy Holidays!"
"mouthfeel is full-bodied and nutty. pretty drinkable at 9%."
"I'm not a big fan of pumkin beer but I bought this because I think this brewery does really interesting things with beer flavors. The color is a good orange/gold. Decent carbonation but the best thing is the flavor and aroma. A lot of breweries use spices to create the pumkin experience, as those spices are what are typically cooked with pumpkin. I don't think this brewery does that. It' has a strong pumpkin flavor and aroma without all the winter spice which, for me, doesnt' work in beer. I think this is a great beer with a flavor that works for many occasions."
"D: as I mentioned, I love pumpkin pie and really enjoy a good pumpkin beer. This and DFH Punkin Ale are right up there as my favorites in this style. I'll definitely go out and grab another bomber or two to enjoy with a real slice of pumpkin pie at Thanksgiving."
"Served in a tulip. Poured a translucent copper with a quarter inch skim that quickly dissipates into a bullseye. The nose is the best feature of this beer; pumpkin pie in a glass - cinnamon, graham cracker crust and all-spice. Taste consistent with nose; however, some caramel comes out, as well as a little booze. Mouthfeel is medium/light, with a pleasant and consistent level of carbonation and a little alcohol heat at the finish. Good drinkability on this, but definitely a sipper, as with most of ST's big beers."
"The smell is slightly happier than the taste, but it's still incredibly tasty, and I'll be stocking up and waiting for the next brewing season."
"This beer is a MUST HAVE for pumpkin beer lovers, and I highly recommend having it on tap. Out of the bottle a lot of the character of this beer is lost for whatever reason. TASTY!"
"The lack of alcohol and sweetness makes this beer dangerously drinkable at 9%, but unfortunately its not tasty enough to really be enthusiastic about the entire bomber."
"D: I wouldn't say I could drink a ton of this just because of the style. Pumpkin beers aren't supposed to be big session beers I don't think. However, this one does a pretty good job of having a nice balance of tastiness, intrigue, uniqueness and complexity that makes me want to keep taking more sips. This won't be my favorite beer, but I could see myselfl probably picking one or two up every October."
"Overall a very nice Imperial Pumpkin. Worth the money in my opinion and one I would buy again."
"Complex and well balanced. This works best as a nice post-meal treat."
"D - Good fall seasonal that fits well with the cool evenings. Nice and crisp...just feels like autumn. Gotta make sure I pick up another bottle and save for Thanksgiving...high level of alcohol limits drinkability, but is difficult to detect while drinking. This one could sneak up on you..."
"A very big beer. The nose on this is amazing, too bad the taste falls apart. There were elements in the taste that i just found very off, the sour pumpkin, the metal like bitterness, almost astrigency, maybe from tannins or grain. I actually couldn't finish it, which is too bad, because its one of the best smelling beers ever."
"D- For a pumpkin beer any of whIch I would probably top out at havibg 2 this is pretty darn tasty."
"This beer is by far the best pumpkin beer that i've ever had. i like the pumkin pie taste and they've nailed it. from the aroma full of malty cinnamon nutmeg and yes pumpkin to the full body and warm alcohol going down, it is one of the best parts of fall."
"D: This is a very unique pumpkin ale from Southern Tier. This is a dessert as much as it is a beer. Very interesting and wonderfully brewed. Perhaps not my favorite style, but on a cool, clear night like this, it's close to ideal."
"I poured two glasses out of a 22 ounce bottle and as I smelled it, I said """oh, my god""" and walked away with both glasses. As I was tempted back to share with the other three people, someone else also said """oh, my god""" Definitely my favorite pumpkin beer ever (I love pumpkin and beer) After my first few ounces, I've already tried to order a keg. Not perfect, but damn close."
"Drinkability - Quite drinkable, especially for a 9% beer. Still a beer that is best split due to the s."
"On tap, I would have to say Pumking is just slightly better than from the bottle. Either way, this is liquid pumpkin pie, whip cream and all. Deep amber color with creamy small head of foam. Nice lacing. Smells and tastes just as described above. Rich, sweet and satisfying. I may bring this to Thanksgiving for dessert instead of the actual pumpkin pie. The best Fall beer out there. This is a must try."
"Drinkability - I've had several Southern Tier offerings and for my taste, they seem way out of balance. Far too sweet is this one. I'm not sure how I can use this beer. Dessert? After-dinner? Hard to find a place, other than as a novelty. Needs more balance, in my opinion."
"Conclusion: Definitely a different sort of pumpkin beer; it's like a really, REALLY boozy pumpkin gingersnap cookie...odd, but delicious"
"Poured a pumpkin orange with a generous head that quickly faded to a bare collar. The aroma was exactly that pumpkin pie smell, nutmeg, cinnamon, amazing. The taste was also like pumpkin pie, but with a nasty, bitterish aftertaste. I could not appreciate that aftertaste, but it did not entirely spoil the flavor. The feel was medium bodied with good carbonation. Drinkability was good. DFH Punkin' didn't smell so much like pie, but I preferred it."
"Overall, easily the best pumpkin beer I have ever had. Great balance and nothing was overdone. If I had to drink a pumpkin beer, this is the one I would choose."
"D - I bought a 24oz bottle and I think I could drink three or four of them."
"Still very good; an ideal finish to a large holiday dinner."
"The taste is just too packed with ABV for my preferences. The beer has just too much booziness and throaty burn on the way down. The nice pumpkin, allspice, nutmeg, and cinnamon is very enticing. If this beer could have been toned down in ABV, I certainly would have appreciated it better. This beer is harsh due to the ABV and it detracts from the many positives that recommend it. I'm deducting points from mouthfeel and drinkability."
"Very good. This beer, along with Smashed Pumpkin and Pumpkinhead are probably the only three examples of pumpkin beers that I like. All three are worth a try but if you really, really like pumpkin pie, pumking will satisfy that craving."
"This was an interesting one to review. I am not the biggest pumpkin pie fan and when I have it I make sure there is plenty of whipped cream. All of the components of what a pumpkin beer are supposed to have are evident in this beer but I personally found them to be a little much. If you like pumpkin beers, this is the one for you. If you are like me and typically don't buy this style, I suggest sharing it as it is very spiced."
"I like it but, with the alcohol burn it's a bit intense to drink. The intial moments of the brew are excellent - clearly a well made ale."
"D- Suprisingly (to me) good. Pumking is a reasonably complex and well blended combination of flavors. I will buy it again."
"In ending i don't know where the hype comes from on this stuff but Schlafly's Imperial Pumpkin Ale blows this stuff away."
"Drinkability: Obviously, you have to be in the mood for this one. It is seasonal and it is pumpkin but as far as I am concerned, it is the best pumpkin ale on the market."
"After reading all the great reviews of this beer I was looking forward to trying it. Well...it was a bit of a letdown for me. This beer poured beautifully but from then on it was a little too 'over-the-top' for me. In both the aroma and the taste, the spices were way too strong. I wasn't sure if I was having a beer or drinking some kind of pumpkin pie smoothie. The cinnamon and the allspice and the clove were just so overpowering that, despite it's $9 price tag, I had to make it a drain pour."
"What a delicious beer."
"Taste: Much more of a pumpkin flavor than any other pumpkin ale I've had. Overly sweet, this beer is definitely not dentist approved. Not overly spiced like some beers of this style tend to be. The alcohol remains fairly well hidden. Only a tiny bit of alcohol warmth."
"D- This is a great beer, but a little sweet making it something to savor. This is not a beer that you are going to have trouble putting down, but that is not necessarily a bad thing. I feel like this makes it a great dessert beer, just not something I would drink a multiple of, especially in a bomber."
"D: tastes great, and i'll have to problem putting this one away, but not really a session beer by any means."
"Drinkability: well they only make this during the fall season but aside from that it is very good. Definitely drinkable with a cinnamon or vanilla spiced treat. This thing is packed with alcohol but hides it very well, as you drink it, you barely notice it."
"Overall: As the leaves fall these bottles will surely pile up. Fitting for the festive season upon us if an Oktoberfest brew isn't your thing. My favorite pumpkin ale considering this one actually tastes like what it sets out to instead of just having some spice."
"Cheers"
"I was very excited to find Southern Tier Pumking on the shelves of the local bottle shop, but I'm more excited to see it gone."
"The nose of this beer certainly makes it go down smooth and makes me want more."
"Um...interesting? I got this for myself as a reward for a 30 mile training run and it ended up down the sink. I want my miles back."
"Pours a bronze golden color with a scaredy cat head, carbonation looks to be high. Nice looking beer overall. Heres where it gets rough for me. This beer does not smell appealing (to me) at all. All I can smell is a nutty, corny scent that is near repulsive. The taste mimics this. Mouthfeel is on the creamier side, with a good amount of carbonation. It barely hints at pumpkin to me, if that. I'll forget southern tier brewed this one and maybe give it another chance in the future, maybe I just don't get it yet."
"D-This is an interesting beer, but not a great pumpkin ale. Weyerbacher Imperial Pumpkin is far superior to this ale in most every way."
"D) Obviously this is a seasonal treat, and one to be savored, particularly with 10% ABV. I enjoyed the bomber over the course of several hours. At one point I ate a cupcake with it, and the sweetness went with the beer terrificly."
"Man this is about this about the best pumpkin beer I ever had. Sure, it's spicy, malty, and rich. But the really good thing is that it has a certain roasty dryness which makes it much less cloying. Poured with a nice off white head and some lace. Color is a medium amber. Aroma is pumpkin pie and spice and definite roastiness. Flavor's the same. Great body and carbonation. Finish is good too, especially due to the dry roasted character. Alcohol is subtle, but present in the very end of the finish. Super rich. Definitely not a session beer."
"Looks golden, not much head. Smells like I'm gutting a pumpkin. The taste is incredible, I can hardly detect the 9% ABV. All I taste is pumpkin and liquid. Might be a bit too rich to be the only thing I drink, but it's definitely one of the best fall beers I've ever had."
"Waited along time to try this jammy and was well worth it. This is my first of many that I will be enjoyong this fall season. Just a couple brews left to try from the ST and you can say mission complete..."
"Exceptional brew!"
"I'm really surprised by this Southern Tier offering, since I usually find their beers to be so exaggerated. The pumpkin i this beer is subdued, too subdued for me. And I'm a big pumpkin beer fan, so I was excited to try this, thinking ST might be the right brewery for the style. But this isn't my favorite pumpkin beer."
"The lack of balance in this beer is too big to ignore. There's nothing there to counter balance all the spice in each sip. Overall, the spices are tasty and are a nice blend, they just went too far in the quantity they added to the beer."
"I finally decided to crack into this Labor day weekend and boy was I disappointed. The appearance is ok, the color is as expected. What really threw me for a loop was the strong aroma of nutmeg and cinnamon. Not only did the smell let me down, the first taste did as well. This may have been the hardest 22oz I have ever fought through. It was terribly sweet and impossible to choke donw. I really expected more for this as I usually love Pumkin Pie... oh well. On to the next brew..."
"Its going to take awhile and lots of sipping to finish this beer but I'll do it and I'll be better for doing so."
"While it poured a pleasant golden amber color and smelled like an odd mixture of spices and pumpkin, at first sip the complexity of flavors was overwhelming. I tasted what seemed like pumpkin pie, but all in all was overpowering and too sweet for my palatte. I found the taste to be metalic in nature with a unflattering after taste. I could not finish the tulip glass I was poured and that is something I hardly ever do - waste beer."
"D - This is my favorite pumpkin beer. I have been excited to drink it this season, ever since tasting it for the first time at Cambridge Common last fall, late in the pumpkin beer season. I'm excited by the idea of drinking this brew with some crispy sweet potato fries for the perfect autumn fatboy pub fare. Hooray for deliciously quaffable pumpkin beer!"
"Pours a Golden Orange. Not much of a head or lacing. GREAT smell. Aroma of nutmeg, pumpkin, and spices. A Very fresh spicy smell. The taste is good as well. The first sip is nutmeg, followed by malt and a little bit of hops. One of the best pumkin ales I have had. Very drinkible as its not too sweet, yet you still get that great pumpkin/nutmeg flavor. The flavor is not an artificial one either but a true nutmeg flavor. I will be stocking up on these."
"Alcohol was not apparent in the smelling or the sipping. This would normally give it high drinkability, but I found the spiciness/bitterness of this beer really slowed down the sipping, and left me happy to just have one."
"Na Zdravje!"
"Drinkability - Very drinkable for such a relatively high ABV. I had 3 of these in one sitting without a problem."
"Well the people at Southern Tier certainly enjoy taking creative licensing when brewing beers, I just don't agree with the style in which they chose to do so."
"D - I think these are pretty easy to drink, but I can only do so much sweet stuff. A great pumpkin ale though, would love to get my hands on some more."
"D - If kept decently cold, I could have another. As it got warmer, the flavor and smell became a bit too much for me. Maybe they put in a dash too much of ginger. Would have wished for a bit more nutmeg and cinnamon."
"Drinkability is great. I could and would drink another if I had another bomber. Even at 9% this beer beckons you to drink her. You won't be able to stop once you start!"
"D= I'm already getting sick of it after about halfway through. Not that drinkable. Let me down."
"I'd say one of these for the night is enough--even for a while. Only a slight alcohol base is noticed--the 9% is superbly hidden. This brew is out in left field--everything that such a flavored beer should accomplish."
"D: Very drinkable...again, more so than you'd think at 9%. On a cool fall night, this is THE beer you need to get your hands on. Way to go Southern Tier."
"A 22 ounce bomber bottle poured into my nonic pint glass. Pumking appears a clear deep amber color with a good two fingers of dense light rust colored foam. Nose and flavor consist of brown sugar, graham crackers, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, pumpkin bread, sweet caramel, a touch of alcohol. Liquid pumpkin pie right down to the crust and fresh dollop of whipped cream. Rich, flavorful and full bodied with adequate carbonation. Very nice!"
"D- I have tried this a couple times in hopes of loving it but for me, I can't polish off a full bottle, maybe half."
"Pours a nice md-orange color with a nice amount of head and a bit of nice lacing. Nice scent, very malty and sweet with some nice pumpkin spice. Overly sweet taste, there's no way I could do a bomber of this; nice pumpkin spice with a bit malt flavor, but it also had a huge whipped cream flavor to it. Good in small tastes, but not even a pint; just too much desert. Goes down fine for the ABV, but much too sweet."
"D-Very easy and pleasant to drink, with the abv however you may want to share this. The problem is you wont want to...ITS SO DELICIOUS."
"D: Probably the best pumpkin ale I have ever tasted. I couldn't have more than one in a sitting though. Forget the pie. I'll have one of these instead with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side."
"Highly recommended."
"Overall, just what I would expect from a pumpkin beer. Probably the best pumpkin ale I've had but then again I don't have much to base it off of. I think I've only had a few different ones. Great offering from Southern Tier, just not sure why my buddy didn't like it."
"This is my 3rd year of having this beer and ive always wanted to review it, but always been to busy, so i cracked one tonight and remembered why its one of my favorites from the first sip. if you like pumkin pie this is a must try, if you dont i wouldnt advice it."
"Pours a copper orange color with a thin head and no lacing. Smells of pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg, gingerbread, brown sugar, and vanilla. Taste is the same. Just like pumpkin pie in a glass. There is sweetness, with some hop bitterness. A nice combination. The alcohol is somewhat hidden, but is detectable. Medium bodied with decent carbonation. Also quite drinkable. I like this one a lot."
"D: Such a wonderful brew with so many complexities. I'm definitely going to be picking this up more often in the fall."
"seriously this is a great beer. did i mention that it tastes like pumpkin? cause it does, alot. best served not ice cold. must now go buy more."
"D: A pint or two is perfect. Probably couldn't have to much more than that."
"D = Gets a little too cloying, too quickly to really rank high on the drinkability index for me."
"I have to preface this with I don't drink Pumpkin beers often, they are my wive's favorite seasonal, so I try them with her. This was an interesting one. First thing, the color, orange. The carbonation are gigantic bubbles and the smell, spice, all spice, nutmeg, something else. I don't detect the alcohol or the hops in the smell at all, even though the bottle claims that the hops are there. they are lost. the flavor of the beer is overwhelmed with spice. I realize that this is the point of these beers. There is an odd aftertaste of nutmeg. I'm pretty sure it was nutmeg. I don't really detect any OBVIOUS pumpkin in the flavor. There is a bright sweetness in the beer that I feel blocks out the pumpkin flavor. If I concentrate I can detect it, but it is not forward. It is hard for me to rate this beer, so I gave it a higher rank that I normally would have. I think it accomplishes what the makers want to accomplish and pumpkin beer fans will probably be relatively pleased with this beer."
"I am asking the store to order me a case of this one so I can have one on special occasions over the holidays, I like it that much. If you see this one please please please give it a try after a good fall meal, it is truly outstanding. Each sip leaves me wanting more. This beer is so good and it is sad that it only comes once a year. Another amazing big beer from Southern Tier!"
"overall: Clearly the best pumpkin beer i have ever had and the best from a larger production brewery for sure, the abv is not evident at all which is dangerous, well done southern tier, i think people are rating this just as a beer, cause as a beer its good, well really good but within the style its king , says so on the bottle too"
"The king has a dirty orange brown look to it with a lot of bubbles within. Overall a nice off white/tan cap sprung above the liquid. Smells consisted of NUTMEG, pummkin,with a big dose of spices with sweet malts backing. The taste is pretty much the same with no intrusion of hops giving off bitter vibes. This one is silky smooth with some minor heat but a big aftertaste of octoberness. A well above medium feel with great drinkable capabilities. I hate pumpkin beers, but for some reason ST always pushes the envelope, and with this style, it works."
"As my first Pumpkin Ale this one is a winner."
"Drinks great, & the ABV sneaks up on you. This beer reminds of so many good things about autumn (including my wedding -- my wife & I toasted with this). A little jarring that they introduced it in mid-August this year, but what the hell? Another example of what Southern Tier seems to really shine at: rich, delicious dessert beers."
"I love all things fall like no other. So when my local beer shop got this in I had to jump on it. It pours a clear orange hue with a tiny bit of creamy beige head. The aroma is unbelievable! It smells so much like pumpkin pie it's ridiculous. I feel like I'm standing in the local farmers market, buying a bag of apples and a fresh pumpkin pie. I'm so longing for those crisp cool afternoons with college football and a warm hoodie. They say the olfactory senses are the most linked to memory. This beer is like a scrap book of autum. The flavor is a tad less of a memory kicker. Pumpkin flavor is there but, I'm getting more vanilla and a smooth nuttiness. I taste clove and nutmeg which is a given in anything pumpkin. At least if it wants to feel like pumpkin. The alcohol is very present with a nice warming effect that is felt with every sip. I can't wait to sip on this beer once the weather turns here in Wisconsin. I can imagine sitting by a fire on a cool Saturday afternoon and toasting with the King. The Pumpking."
"D - This isn't my style...but I really liked this one...the nose is amazing and the flavor all mix together nicely...this one tastes like a pumpkin pie...but just watch out for that 9% ABV!"
"Is if Fall yet?"
"Notes: Definitely one of the best pumpkin ales out there. The spices in this are not as intense as others, and ST really captures the """pumpkin pie""" flavor, crust and all."
"D: i gave it a relatively low drinkability, not because its not the best pumpkin beer ive ever had, because it is, but because the spices and tastes are so unique and overwhelming that i really wouldnt want more than one. This is a special occasion beer, not something you have every day. I keep a stash for halloween and thanksgiving."
"Pours an amber/orange color with a little over a finger of head in my 25 oz. snifter. Smell is mainly spices and pumpkin pie. Upon first sip I feel like I am chewing on a ball of nutmeg. This is very unique and unfortunately rather gross for my palate. I suppose if it was reviewed to style this would be a high score, but in the grand scheme of things it is just not a drinkable beer. There is an extremely unpleasant aftertaste that almost made me want to vomit....it didn't taste that bad actually going down though, just in the aftertaste. I had to drain pour this, it is not for me."
"Pours a golden amber color with a nice one and a half to two finger head. The head gives way to very good lacing. The aroma is of pumpkin and some nutmeg and a hint of vanilla. The overall taste is very good. It is of pumpkin and some nutmeg with a hint of vanilla. There is a small hop presence in the taste as well. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. It has a light carbonation. The drinkability is very high which could be a problem since it has a higher alcohol content than most pumpkin beers. This is one of the top pumpkin beers out there. If you see it go for it and try it."
"I loved this beer style in general. Fall is my favorite season for beer. I particular love pumpkin ales. I think Southern Tier put a new wonderful twist on it with the vanilla."
"This beer would've been good with dessert. It is certainly unusual and worth a try if you like pumpkin ales."
"Holy fucking shit. I had this beer on tap with a sugar/cinnamon spice rim and thought it was great, but just sitting back and enjoying the base of this beer, wow!!! This is hands down the best pumpkin beer ever brewed. This is amazing. it's like drinking a beer brewed from pure pumpkin"
"22 oz. bottle, fall 2008 version, sampled 9/24/08. Brewed to 19 plato with two-row, crystal, and pureed pumpkin; bittered with magnum and finished with sterling. It pours a crystal-clear copper, with medium carbonation, and a finger of tan head that attempts to lace the glass. Lots and lots of pumpkin in the nose, along with spices and toasted graham cracker. The aroma refuses to quit. Fairly similar flavor, with notes of vanilla, nutmeg and cinnamon complementing the pumpkin rather than overwhelming it. There's a breath of alcohol at the start, but this airs out over time. In addition, there is a light sweetness, and some late hop bitterness that is a touch high, but necessary for proper aging. Not too heavy on the palate, with decent carbonation and a nice finish. This is a pretty delicious brew, delivering probably the most authentic pumpkin pie flavor of any in the style, going so far as to include the graham cracker crust. It also seems engineered for aging - what with the higher-than-average alcohol and bitterness. I'm quite confident the flavor will mature and improve over a year or two, by which time this will be a divine autumn beverage."
"One drawback is the 22 oz bottle size. I find that towards the end the general sweetness is becoming too cloying and makes the beer a little less enjoyable for drinking."
"This is OK but not really something I would look forward to drinking two glasses of a night. Sweet taste starts to get old after a while. That plus I'm not too fond of hazelnut flavor anything except hazelnuts. Same as Coffee should be coffee flavored!"
"I don't know if this is really my thing. Definitely a sipper and I feel it needs to be paired with something to offset the monster flavors: cheese, dessert, something. Just a little too spicy and pumpkin-y without the basic tenants of beer being there to balance it out. That said, if it were Halloween or Thanksgiving I might seek this out again to give it another chance."
"D: Dangerously drinkable. The alcohol is so well hidden and the taste is so spot on that one could easily get into trouble. This beer has risen to being well within my top ten """most delicious""" list. Love me a pumpkin ale. If you're also a fan of the style, there simply is no substitute that will take you back to the family Thanksgiving dessert tradition like Pumking does."
"Now this is a pumpkin beer. If you want to know what this tastes like, let me put it to you like this: Yankee Candles Pumpkin Spice candle in a beer form. The minute you pop the top you are hit with an abundance of pumpkin and spice of which I've never seen in a pumpkin beer. This is extremely well done. I think the only thing that this would need would be some kind of sweetener to balance out the taste a little bit. The spice is abundant and dominating. At 9% you're going to feel this one a bit as well. This would be absolutely wonderful to drink outdoors sitting around a campfire. My new favorite pumpkin beer without a doubt. I'll surely be drinking a few more of these. Well done Southern Tier."
"This is a good pumpkin beer, with the title of it being """too much""" this beer is a nutmeg bomb. It smells like straight pumpkin spices and ginger bread. At 10% or so, this is the perfect beer to sit around the fire with on a nice october night. It must be served ice cold, or it gets a little """boozy""" It is sweet and a little syrupy but overall satisfying."
"CHEERS! Beertracker"
"One of the best beers I've had. Period."
"Only negative is you cannot drink more than one or two of these."
"D - This offering by Southern Tier has really impressed me, again, as a seasonal treat beer, this was awesome and really allowed the pumpkin to shine"
"I loved it!"
"Not very good, even for a pumpkin beer. Would not get this again."
"May try to age a bottle or two to try in a month or so, but right now, the lingering finish kind of throws off the whole beer. The spices just overwhelm the beer. And this is from a fan of Pumpkin beers, too."
"The taste is unlike any pumpkin beer. It is liquid pumpkin pie. This is not a subtle imaginary taste, oh no, and the 9% ABV??? undetectable. (Be Careful) The rich creamy vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg and incredibly prominent pumpkin flavor make this truly a dessert beer for a king. Hence the name..."
"N.B. I find it amusing the Southern Tier notes that this is an """Imperial""" Pumpkin Ale - maybe it's time for a new category?"
"Cheers!"
"smooth texture and soft carbonation make it luscious on the tongue. medium to full body which is not thick or syrupy... highly enjoyable. dare i say, sessionable?10/4/10/5/19/4.8"
"The whole package is sweet, and dessert-like, but not so much that it detracts from an excellently brewed beer. The aroma is a revelation to me, and it seems to have a lot in common with Rogue's Hazelnut Nectar. The real wonder is that it actually delivers in the taste, and I would take this over the traditional Thanksgiving dessert in an instant."
"Standout seasonal beer and one of top rated beers for style."
"It's a nice beer and all, but strictly a seasonal treat in my opinion. It's not something I would drink more than one bottle in a sitting, and not to often. Great treat, but not a daily drinker."
"This beer was not very drinkable. The nuttiness didn't work for me. That combined with the sweetness was a bit much. I shared this bottle (22oz bomber) with one friend. I found myself wishing that I had shared with 2 or 3."
"Drinkability: This is an incredible beer. I've never had anything like it. I think anyone could enjoy this beer, regardless of palate maturity. A fun approach for a fall beer that I could drink early and often."
"Drinkability is obviously low. Five other guys passed on having any more of this beer - and so we had to pour the rest of the bomber down the drain. The bomber was still more than 75% full. That isn't a good sign."
"Not sure how this beer is possible? Much like Creme Brulee and Choklat, the craftability that Southern Tier cranks out to be more like food is very impressive. Also not sure how or why this is 9%? It does have some warming abilities behind its quaffable nature to be found as you go. But beers at this high of ABV usually have a thicker, heftier, more malt laden type of character, and this really doesn't have that. It has a very decievingly clean and crisper smoothness that seems more like a simple pale-like ale. Just goes to show the boundries of brewing continue to be broken by impressive craft brewers like Southern Tier."
"D - Best pumpkin beer I have tried. Not sure how many other places use real pumpkin but I think you can really tell the difference. The real pumpkin creates a fresher taste and a different spicing."
"(rated Oct 16, 2007)"
"the aroma features even more of that biscuity element. it's a funny characteristic; i'm enjoying the beer but it's a kind of nutty sweetness that i'm not sure i could drink gallons of"
"I'm trying to rate this beer for what it's supposed to be and not what I think of it. It's an interesting beer but I don't think it's a style for me to get excited about."
"EDIT: Did they change the recipe? When I had it, it was 9% ABV. I'm going to have to try this again."
"D- For the experience, 5+. Pumpkin pie in a bottle. For drinkability on its own, and being able to session/drink a lot of, no way."
"(NOTE: more positive re-review forthcoming)"
"Pours a clear amber with a smaller white head. Nose is a lot of spices. Nutmeg, cinnamon, cardammon? Flavor is much more spice forward than I remember last years being. Wasn't it all about the pumpkin last year. I mean it's still nice, but the spices are too high IMO. Feel is good on both liquid and carbonation. Nice to drink, but too much spices. Tone it down and bring back the pumpkin flavor and you've got something very good."
"Tastes of pumpkin pie spices, some hop bitterness and sweet caramel malts. This is one hell of a treat for my big nose."
"Pumking's an interesting beer. It's good. But, it could be quite a bit better. If the pumpkin pie flavor were more pronounced, I'd like it quite a bit more. As it is, the pumpkin taste is just a little too strong. That being said, it's more than solid in all other respects. It's definitely one to try."
"Drinkability: This is the best and easy drinking Pumpkin Ale that I've had so far. I loved the pumpkin bread smell and taste and i loved that it wasn't overly spicy with cinnamon and cloves. This one changed my mind about Pumpkin Ales. It is possible to make a great Pumpkin Ale! If you love pumpkins, then this Southern Tier seasonal is a must try."
"Copper coloured ... big white foam head .... Oh my big pumpkin with something a bit unpleasant in nose (wife says popcorn and id say shes sopt on, and i dont like popcorn)... rich yeasty vegtable pumpkin ... its very veggy ... again some popcorn... and quite unlike other pumpkin beers ive had ... really dont like it"
"The beer poured a slightly cloudy honey-amber with a dense, thick, white head into a pint glass. The smell was of pumpkin pie - no joke - pumpkin pie. The taste was actually like drinking a slice of pumpkin pie, complete with the pumpkin and spice flavors - very unique and cool, I must admit. Good carbonation and lacing. I am not in any way a fan of fruited or otherwise spice-enhanced beer, but I must admit that this offering from ST was not bad at all."
"this guy describes it well, """almost like an over spiced pumpkin cheese cake""" he liked it, i didn't. to each their own, that's the beauty of beer!"
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a clear slightly dark golden amber. Had next to no bubbles rising, and was completely clear. The head was very thin, made up of very small milky white bubbles. Smell was very spicy, nutmeg and ginger with a touch of molasses. Very small amount of smoke, almost like smoked pumpkin. Absolutely no """beer""" smell. Taste was pumpkin, hidden behind a little bit of spicy sweet, almost like an over spiced pumpkin cheese cake. Coated the mouth very well, but left a bit of bitterness on the tongue that I couldn't place why. Very good to sip, a different twist on the usual """pumpkin/pumpkin spices""" beer."
"3.6/5"
"Very good beer, but I don't think I could drink more than 1 or 2 in a night."
"Recommended! One of, if not my absolute favorite fall beers."
"Wow...I don't even know what to say...This beer is awesome. A nice, coppery-orange color that hits you in the face with aromas of pumpkin, spice, nutmeg, cinnamon and tastes exactly how it smells...delicious. Mouthfeel is a little thin, but I think at this point in time, I'm just trying to find something to criticize. You definitely have to try this beer...regardless if you're a fan of pumpkin or other spiced-type beers, this beer is impressive."
"D: It tastes great; there is no getting around that. Spices galore and on this November night... it just seems appropriate. It is the best of its style I have had the past few years, maybe of all time... very authentic. That being said, I am not sure I could have another and I find myself feigning a nice hoppy IPA afterwards to strip away some of the lingering flavors. Not a session beer, a seasonal beer and a great one at that."
"Cheers sleazo for the Secret Halloween brew! poured orange amber with a decent cream colored head. then came the sniff. a great combo of pumpkin and spice with a whip cream kind of sweetness. all i see is pumpkin pie! the same wonderful pumpkin pie essence translates in the taste with a delicious amount of roastiness that balances the sweet pumpkin just about perfectly. like a dessert bottled. i believe this to be the best pumpkin ale i have ever had. i dont think i could kill a bomber to the dome but what a treat to split with some friends!"
"Pours an orange/gold with a small head with minimal retention and some lacing. Smell is of nutmeg, some cinnamon, all spice, and vanilla. Wonderful nose. Tastes like liquid pumpkin pie while not being overly spiced or sweet. Nutmeg, cinnamon, vanilla, and pie crust. Has nice creamy mouthfeel to it with great carbonation. This is one of the tastiest pumpkin beers I've had."
"Poured a pretty clear, orange/rusty color with a nice creamy head that retains very well. As soon as I opened the bottle, huge aromas of oatmeal cookies and graham crackers smacked me in the face. More notes of vanilla, cinnamon, pumpkin, and nuts were savored in the smell as well. What an amazing aroma this beer puts off. And the taste follows suit...huge flavors of windmill oatmeal cookies, graham crackers, vanilla, nuts, cinnamon, nutmeg, light hops in the finish. I usually cant stand pumpkin/spiced beers but this sucker is absolutely delicious. Simply amazing."
"Lighter orange to amber appearance with a white head that fades fairly fast. The nose is somewhat restrained - malt and baking spices. The taste of this brew is intriguing - it reminds me of my wife's pumpkin swirl cake - nutmeg and cinnamon dominate with pumpkin playing a secondary role. Nicely done. Medium body - nothing too funky here. This beer is very drinkable given that I normally do not like """novelty""" beers and the 9% ABV. I will buy a couple more bombers next year around Halloween."
"Drinkability and Conclusion- Easily the best pumpkin beer I've had overall. I'm usually disappointed by pumpkin beers, but this one lives up to the hype. Amazingly drinkable for 9% and for a pumpkin beer. I had no problem getting through a bomber of this myself. This one makes it on my perennial seasonal list for sure."
"D - The effort is greatly appreciated as this is an inspired and unique Pumpkin Ale... A sipper, especially by Pumpkin Ale standards..."
"A great example of a quality pumpkin ale. Had this on Halloween and enjoyed every sip."
"This is the most authentic pumpkin ale I've tasted in recent memory and a perfect drink for Halloween evening."
"Goes good with pumkin seed :) Happy Halloween!"
"Notes: What a great evening for a Pumking."
"Drinkability: While the taste is quite interesting - it's not the most refreshing. I mean just think of the concept of drinking liquid pie crust. An interesting seasonal- just not my favorite."
"This beer def. lives up to its billing as the top pumpkin ale. Very good. Mouthfeel and spices sort of remind me of egg nog."
"D - This would get gross eventually. SPECTACULAR beer if you try just one. Old George W. knew what he was doing when he wanted to add this fruit to his beer."
"D - This one is not my cup of tea (or glass of beer). It was enjoyable to try, but I was not big on it because it was so overpowering in its smell in taste, neither of which I really enjoyed. I like pumpkin ales, however this one just didn't do it for me."
"Big thanks to bwyker for throwing this in on a recent trade. First whiff is pumpkin...bread. Yep, straight pumpkin bread and not pie. Nice orange color, white head. Ok, maybe this does have a little pumpkin pie to the aroma. The taste is pumpkin bread, pumpkin pie, graham cracker crust, mmm. I only need about one pumpkin beer per year and this one hits the spot."
"Southern Tier Pumking pours a dense pumpkin orange with slight amber hue. A little fizzy carbonation makes its way thought the viscous liquid, but not much. The smell is very pleasant, yielding a moderate to strong pumpkin aroma. This is by far the best example of a pumpkin tasting beer I've ever had. The taste is strong with tons of pumpkin flavor and a good alcohol kick that isn't evident in the taste, but in the head. Mouthfeel is heavy, dense, and feels like puree pumpkin nectar. Overall drinkability for this brew is fantastic. Its everything and more I could have wanted in a pumpkin beer. The best standard I've seen for what this brew should be."
"Perhaps the most authentically pumpkin-like flavor of any pumpkin ale I've had, and the carrot cake element is not only uncanny but ridiculously delicious. Like sitting down with a fresh baked pie and a big glass of creamy milk, Pumking reminds of Thanksgiving, raking leaves, and cozying up by the first of the season's fires. Next time I bring home a bunch more than just two frickin' bottles. Superb."
"A roller coaster of thoughts for this beer. Everyone told me how amazing it was and that I had to try it because it was hands down the best. Then one of my better beer buds got 2 bottles, he had the first by himself and say it was such a disappointment. Not a bad beer but it didn't live up to the hype. He brought in the second bottle to try and as you can tell, I thought different. Oh yea, he changed his mind too, said the first must have been a bad bottle..."
"This beer certainly pushes the limites of pumpkin ales. Forget the subtle aromas and flavors of pumpkin ales of a few years ago. It is really the spices that give this beer it's orginality. Sweet and smooth, with smells like a pumpkin pie baking in the oven. I could not tell this beer was 9%. Scary. It'not even heavy for this style. It sweetness is the only part that lets you know this is one beer you need to be careful with."
"A very nice Pumpkin beer."
"On tap at Buckeye Beer Engine. I'm not much of a fan of pumpkin ales, but at least they're generally drinkable. This one lacked balance, in my book. Too much malty sweetness with not enough backbone for my tastes Aroma was nice, though. This was a 3-4 sipper. Couldn't make it through the rest of the pour."
" The aftertaste was pretty doughy - the pie crust flavors dominate with the pumpkin mellowing out and lingering along with it. This is strong as I said before, but the alcohol doesn't overpower. Rather, it complements this silently strong beer, and that's not a bad thing. It's refreshing to see a Pumpkin Ale that doesn't taste its overspiced brethren...and having it draw me in until I got to the bottom of my glass was just the icing on the cake! If I ever went trick-or-treating again, I'd want this in my bag over all the chocolate in the world..."
"M/D - Medium bodied and near perfect carbonation. The tastes are a little sharp on the tongue. Enjoyed a few sips of this one but after about 8 ounces it just became a bear to finish. I couldnt even get through the bottle."
"This beer improves as its body warms. Nice balance of traditional ale characteristics blended with seasonal spices and flavors. I will be seeking this again next fall."
"All in all Pumking is a first rate beer."
"Pours a clear amber with 2 fingers of foamy off-white head. Good retention and ok lacing. Smells of pumpkin, nutmeg, flour, brown sugar, cake, and cinnamon. Tastes of pumpkin meat, nutmeg, a touch of cinnamon, cookie/cake, roasted pumpkin seeds, and brown sugar. Medium in body with good carbonation. Creamy and smooth, airy and cake-like with a nice balance between spices and pumpkin. Last year's batch was a little too pumpkin meaty for me, not enough spice, but this year's batch takes the cake and is a great pumpkin ale. I'd drink this by the case if it wasn't 9%."
"Finsihes with lingering, warming spice, toasted pumpkin seeds, and brown sugar."
"D- its alright, idk the taste is good, but I find myself struggling to take each next sip. ohh well"
"22oz. bomber: This one pours a slightly hazy, darker golden color. There is a slight orange tinge to it. There was a small off-white head on it that dropped away rather quickly, and leaves no lacing. The aroma is interesting. Missing is the pumpkin pie spice that you usually get with this style. I get mainly pumpkin and cinnamon. However, there are some other aromas. There is an almost funkiness to it, but not in a bad way. The taste is interesting. There is the pumpkin, as well as clove and cinnamon. There is a dryness and a touch of sourness to the brew. Also a nuttiness in the flavor profile. This is an interesting take on a pumpkin beer."
"One of the best Pumpkin beers I've had. Beer pours a nice copper color with a small head and not much lacing. Big aroma of vanilla, nutmeg and allspice, like someone just took a pumpkin pie out of the oven. First sip is surprisingly smooth and creamy, not what you normally find in a pumpkin beer. You really taste the vanilla and other spices. One of the more drinkable pumpkin beers I;'ve had and would recommend it to anyone who likes the style."
"D: I would certainly have more then 1 in a sitting, a great dessert beer, with a high ABV of 9%."
"Poured into a goblet an opaque amber color. Very little head quickly disappears altogether. Aroma is pumpkin, clove, nutmeg. Mouthfeel is medium with good carbonation, a little syrupy. Taste is lots of pumpkin and spice up front and in your face, vanilla, caramel, almond, with a bit of alcohol in the finish. Very much like a good pumpkin pie. Although I expected this to be a little sweeter, this is one of the better pumpkin ales I have had, although the 9% ABV is completely unnecessary. A welcome fall treat."
"Very interesting pumpkin beer with a very different flavor profile from most. This one tastes more like pumpkin custard- or even pumplin creme brulee. I wouldn't say it is my absolute favorite pumpkin (that would be Elysian's Great Pumpkin), but the richness and different tastes in this one make it very, very enjoyable indeed. Pours an orange amber with little head. Smells and tastes of pumpkin custard with a brulee crust and roasted pumpkin seeds. There is an eggy richness to this beer and the carmelized sugars are so deep and rich they taste burnt. This beer definitely shares some characteristics with Creme Brulee fro The same brewery, but it isn't nearly as unctous nor as sweet as that beer. Thee notes of roasted punpkin seeds adds a savory, almost salty nuttiness to the equation. The spice notes are also a bit different with lots of mace and nutmeg and little to no cinammon. There are also some squash-like flavors from the pumpkin and the pumpkin also adds some silkiness to the mouthfeel. A great beer and very different from the overly sweet pumpkin concoctions out there."
"This beer pours a amber orange color with a small white head that quickly disappears. Huge pumpkin smell with nutmeg and cinnamon. The taste is unmistakably pumpkin pie. The mouthfeel had medium body with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, I was happy with the bomber. Not as sweet as I expected (I thought creme brulee was too sweet). This is hands down the best pumpkin beer I have had. Another great beer from Southern Tier."
"Hands down, the best pumpkin ale ever out there!!! 2007 is not as pumpkiny as 2008,but if you combine both together, you get an awesome tasting. I challenge anyone out there with a bottle of 07', pour a couple of ounces in a snifter, then add the same amount of the 08 to the glass and let us know what you think!!! Someone needs to tell Southern Tier!"
"BUT..damn good beer, highly recommended...drink one and see..."
"This is a very solid Pumpkin beer. I should know, because I get my hands on any pumpkin beer I see. I would say this is easily one of the top pumpkin beers, if not one of the top beers I've had. The smell is really interesting. It has hints of amaretto, pumpkin, and spices. The taste has a hint of the amaretto, but more of the pumpkin and spices, with a little kick of alochol. Very smooth and warming, which is great for the cool fall nights. The only bad thing about this one, is that I can't find it in SC."
"D: This was an extremely unique brew. I'll admit that I bowed out earlier than the wife (just a bit too much pumpkin for me), but I still enjoyed this brew. Southern Tier is clearly about pushing the limits and I can totally respect and acknowledge that even if it's not my cup of tea (the wife LOVED IT though). I need to find me some more Southern Tier now!"
"D: Best Pumpkin yet. I could drink all Fall"
"D - This is a really nice tasting pumpkin ale. Absolutely the best one that I've ever had."
"Feels thick and foamy. Milky and chunky. Chewy. It's delicious and bursting with flavor, but also seriously heavy."
"Drinkability: This is a tough beer to review. On one hand, I see it as a great dessert beer, as it would go spectacularly with a big piece of pumpkin pie and vanilla ice cream. On the other hand, this beer is just too damn sweet. I couldn't even finish the pint I was drinking without starting to feel a little sick from the sweetness overload. Bottom line, if you want a well brewed, extremely sweet pumpkin beer, try this one. If your not crazy about an ale that feels like it's rotting through your teeth, stay away. If I was to have this again, I'd have one glass, then stop. Any more then that, and I might need dentures."
"Drinkability is pretty good, I have to admit, I was expecting a super sweet desert beer, but this is a nice, sturdy drinking fall warmer that emphasizes it's namesake vegetable. Still, I can see why it wouldn't be for everyone, and I would think if I went for a second bomber, I'd regret it. I bought this in Boston about 2 months ago and have cellared it since, but now that it's available in WA (and probably soon to be OR), it's might be making a regular fall appearance. I need to track another down and try cellaring it for a year. Better served warmer, like a barelywine (although it doesn't particularly taste like one)."
"D - For a 9% beer, it is very drinkable. There is some warmth from the alcohol, but no more than there would be if you were eating a piece of pumpkin pie. Simply a great beer."
"A one finger head right after the pour, that recedes to a small island of foam andring. Good medium copper hue with a very strong column of bubbling. The aroma is hearty pumpkin bread, strong malt notes and a well integrated pumpkin aroma. The taste is equally bready and pumpkin-ey, but with more emphasis on spices. Notes of numeg, cinnamon, and brown sugar come throuh in the middle. The finish is a dry, grainy pumpkin bread. Good sipping beer on a brisk october evening."
"D: Definitely a very drinkable beer. Pretty intense flavor that might be offputting after a few consecutive bottles, but I'm pretty sad there's not another bomber to pour."
"This is the perfect autumn beer. It pours a light bronze color. Strong smell of pumpkin, with some nutmeg-like spice. The taste was superb. Again, the pumpkin was strong, but not at all overpowering. There were also various spices present, most notably nutmeg and vanilla. Everything came together perfect. I can't imagine a better iteration of this style."
"I have heard that last year's batch was easier on the spices, which may have appealed to me more. The problem for me was that it was flat out too sweet. Much like the creme brulee, this would be better enjoyed after dinner shared with a few friends."
"D: I checked the bottle again just to confirm this was 9% as it drinks that smoothly. I think this is the most unique taste of the pumpkin ales I have tried to date. I am by no means an expert in this genre but it works perfectly for this time of year. It is something that you can gorge on for the Halloween season. Ode to Púca and brewed with the pagan spirit in mind. Take the kids trick or treating, carve some pumpkins, jam some Misfits or Gwar, dress up like a your favorite maniac, or go watch the Jimmy Stewart movie Harvey. At least give this beer a shot."
"D: My mouth watered waiting for this one to make it's appearance this season. IMO the best pumpkin beer out there. Though I savor it slowly, it is full of great flavors and highly drinkable for 9% abv."
"Overall this is a must try. Weyerbacher and DFH both make exceptional pumpkin beers but this is on a level all its own. I'm glad I had the chance to try it."
"Pours a transparent golden-orange with a large off-white tinted head. Aroma of (surprise) pumpkin, sweet malt and a variety of spices with cinnamon being the most apparent. The flavor has a ginger quality as well as pumpkin, cloves, almonds and light caramel. Long finish with a nice cinnamon and clove character that lingers on the palate. Medium to full bodied with an oily texture and small carbonation. Alcohol very well hidden."
"I really was looking forward to this beer and I thank seanpacheffddefa (sp?) for the sample."
"Picked up a 650ml bottle, opened and poured into a pint glass. Pours a nice light, orange, amber color. The smell is as good as it gets for a pumkin ale. Cinnamin, nutmeg come right to the fore front. Has a very sweet scent to it. The taste is also impressive. When smelling the beer you expect it to be overly sweet but it isn't. Very smooth, you feel like your drinking a well made pumpkin pie. It is a little thicker then some pumpkin ales I have has but this beer does not disappoint. Probaly one of the best Pumpkin ales I have had."
"Overall, wow. I have never tasted anything like this it was just tremendous. This was the most perfect fall dessert I could think of. Rich, sweet, decadent. This was better then I ever imagined it would be. Overall I was floored and would have to recommend this to anyone!"
"Beer has recently stopped surprising me . . . but that all changed with Pumking. The nose is all vanilla and bourbon, and you think you're in for another very sweet beer, like the creme brullee stout. Not so! Every sip is a journey across the palate. Up front there are strong cinnamon and brown sugar notes, widening to the promised bourbon. The interesting part comes at the end of your palate, where a cleansing hoppiness comes through to finish the sip and cleanse your palate. Without this hoppiness, the beer would be too sweet. With it, it's a fascinating, well-balanced, and extremely complex beer that made me do a double take. Every sip is a journey. I've already bought at least 5 of these, and trust me, I'll be back for more before this delicious seasonal disappears."
"Pours a very clear golden/amber with a large head that lasts. The head isn't huge,but it does leave good lacing. The smell is very pungent and nice with pumpkin,cinnamon,bread yeast,ginger,and alcohol. The taste is like the smell, full of pumpkin,bread yeast,ginger bread cookies,and cinnamon. This is like walking into a bakery,both smell and taste. The m/f is medium with all the flavors mixing well. I'm not one for fruit beers,but this is very good and just another quality beer from a great brewery."
"Medium bodied, silky smooth, not overly sweet or overly spiced, very nicely balanced. This could go rerasonably well with poultry or ham, but is really a nice dessert brew afterward. The best pumpkin brew yet and a good beer for cool fall weather."
"Drinkability - this is a more vegetal version of a pumpkin ale, which is a departure from the 'spice and cinnamon first, actual pumpkin flavor optional' mindset that is too common to the style. If you haven't had any examples of a good pumpkin beer with the actual pumpkin well-represented, look no further."
"D - It is very unique but I don't think I can drink to much of this."
"Overall, a great beer and wouldn't mind trying to find another before it gets cold."
"Wow! The aroma of this beer is amazing, reminds me of a sweet dessert. I can not exactly place all the spices in this beer but I do beleive there is a strong vanilla scent and perhaps nutmeg. the taste is just as powerful as the aroma which makes this a great final beer of the night. The flavor is too overpowering to continually enjoy unfortunately. I sampled this beer at the Publick House in a paddle and found that was the right amount. After finishing my paddle I ordered a proper pint and halfway through wished that I didn't. I love this beer but I could not drink more then 1 at a time. Would I reccomend this beer yes, would I have more then 1 round no. Please try this beer ,enjoy this beer in small samples."
"D: amazing pumpkin ale. great flavor, 9% is rough but well hidden. good brew and well worth drinking if you like spices."
"The mouth is silky with low levels of carbonation. The 9% will limit it a once a night beer for me. I enjoyed this one and will be picking-up more for the fall. Well done!!"
"Tends to finish on the thin side but this is really what a pumpkin ale should be like. Southern Tier took it up a notch once again."
"There is a lot I like about this beer, but it lacks in some departments (head and retention, a touch more bready flavors that linger, slight kick up in mouthfeel.)"
"Mouthfeel & Drinkability - Mouthfeel is nice. Overall M&D suffers due to level of spice which is too pronounced IMHO."
"Drinkability: I think this is an OUTSTANDING Beer, but one would be enough for me. It is very strong but very tasty! What a great way to celebrate the first day of fall. This is the perfect beer for HALOWEEN or Thanksgiving after the meal instead of pumpkin pie!!"
"Another NY craft beer tasting. I'm a fan of pumpkin beers after having my first at Chumley's a few years back. Lately, I've been disappointed at most that have been available. Pumking, however, raised my eyebrows a bit. Nice golden color with lots of spice on the nose, especially vanilla. Enjoyable mouthfeel though the alcohol is very present to the point of almost being metallic. I do hope that vanilla is not synonomous with pumpkin spice, as there was a lot of vanilla in the taste and I kept waiting for the pumpkin spice to take over. Instead, the spice hung around on the edges apparently lacking the self esteem to take the floor. 9% ABV to me means sipping and I was more in the mood for good pumpkin thirst quenching, but that is what it is."
"Drinkability: A sipper for sure. Colder it is the sweeter it is, which is odd. Let it warm a bit before putting it into whatever glass you're emptying it into. Certainly worth the $7 for the bomber, but I couldn't do more than one, and it may be an ideal brew to split with a friend or two also. A nice switch from the barley wines and RIS that will be consumed this fall, but be warned, it's much more like the pumpkin pie aspect than it is a brew with mild spicy pumpkin background. If you're not ready for it, you'll be disappointed possibly. Take to the Thanksgiving where you'll be; there will be some people really happy with your gift."
"i'd suggest maybe drinking this when you're already a little drunk with a slice of pumpkin pie. they did everything right with the smell, but didn't do so hot with everything else."
"Notes: The flavor is wonderful like a slice of pumpkin pie with cream toping! Outstanding!!!"
"I wouldn't jones for this year-round, but this is a very good welcome to Autumn. I haven't had a lot of Southern Tier beers, but what I've had has been very impressive."
"I cant give this a good drinkability... although the alcohol is well hidden, and the carbonation is fine, but after about 6 ounces of TRYING to like it I had to pour the rest, my gag reflex got the best of me on this one... now i need to go brush my teeth, or wash the flavor away with a really hoppy IPA."
"MF&D - I'm not a big fan of fruit/vegetable infused beer, but this one is about as good as they get. You don't even come close to noticing the 9%ABV, it goes down really nice. My only complaint is it is a tad bit on the sweet side. I'm not sure I could drink these all night, but it's definitely a nice fall treat."
"Becoming sweeter and stronger as it warms past the 40 degree suggested serving temp, it's a novelty in itself that ought to be shared around a campfire, at a seasonal party, or after raking leaves. Sneaky high alcohol has its effects and should be noted. Another impressive Southen Tier flavored beer. A new reason to look forward to fall!"
"This is my first review, and I typically do not review beers. I've tried hundreds, but this may rank in the top five. I highly recommend this beer, by far the best pumpkin ale I've had."
"D: Fantastic beer. The 9% is amazingly hidden but could sneak up on you. More than 1 pint would be pushing it a bit for me but that's probably only me, lol."
"Overall if you're looking for a true pumpkin pie tasting beer, this is your beer. I love pumpkin ales, and Southern Tier certainly has the blend of spices right, but this one didn't taste enough like a beer for me to really enjoy it."
"D- Wonderful. This beer goes down easily and is a joy to drink. If I could recommend one pumpkin beer to try this autumn, this wold definitely be it."
"Now, I'm back into digging pumpkin beers. This is a must try."
"Drinkability - Not bad the at 1st but the spice in this one was just to much for me. Iwould not buy this one again."
"I was a little dubious about this one, because I've had very few pumpkin ales that weren't just a mess of spices and therefore completely undrinkable...but I thought I'd try this since I'd heard good things. Poured a scarlet red/brown with a nice soft ¼ inch head on top. Smelled spicy, but in a sweet, freshly baked way rather than just of spices in a bowl. Nutmeg, cloves and cinnamon are all strong on the nose, particularly the cloves, which makes it smell like an old English Christmas drink. Taste is great....all the spices again, but mixing with a nice malty sweetness that backs up the spice supremely well. Slight roasted, biscuity quality. Overall the impression is remarkably like a pumpkin pie, but without betraying the idea of a beer either. A surprise, and a good one, for me."
"-Oelergud"
"By far the best pumpkin beer ive had to date, i feel that most pumpkin beers are way too spiced up and usually one is enough. But not this beer such balance, i wish the ABV was a little lower so i could have a couple of these, def. a nice beer to finish off the night"
"D-Crazy good! Pumpkin pie with the crust AND the spices...great. If I told you I kept ordering glass after glass to play kick the keg do you understand my 5? BTW, I won and kicked the thing!"
"This is a very interesting take on the style, I really, really like that the spices seem to have been left out of this beer entirely (or at least used differently than typical); the pumpkin character though is quite a bit different than I was expecting and not in a bad way. This definitely comes off as a bit cloying (which is typical of this brewery), though I now expect to get dessert when I crack one of this breweries beer open."
"I can't drink this whole bottle yet alone this goblet. I don't understand why this beer is so popular. No thanks."
"D: The scariest thing about this beer is the 9% abv that is very well hidden. For a beer of this gravity and style it is very drinkable."
"This years batch poured from a 22oz bottle. Pours amber/copper color with basically no head. Aroma was like that of banana bread and spices, couldn't smell the pumpkin at all. Taste at 1st was banana bread and spices almost nutty, after a few more sips the pumpkin started to come out. Not really sweet, a tad malty, little carbonation, but overall a good pumpkin beer."
"22oz bomber served in a chalice. Copper colored pour with a quickly dissipating head. Fantastic aroma of pumpkin pie spices, cinnamon, nutmeg even some bready pie crust. Taste is more spice with fruit. There is a bit of hop bitterness in the middle. The finish of spice lingers long. There is a little bit of alcohol as it warms. One bottle is plenty. Like the Creme Brulee, the aroma alone is worth the price of admission."
"D: The 9% alcohol is well-hidden but the strength of the flavor profile would limit me to one bottle (or half a bottle, as I split it with ksak). In hindsight, I can't say that I want to try another pumpkin beer again."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable. Worth popping open with dessert."
"Drinkability is great. I'll be grabbing at least 4 more of these for storage and trade, best seasonal I've had this fall, comparable so far only to SN's Harvest, but thats a different style all together. Try this!"
"Let me start with what I thought was the best part of the beer. It tasted like liquid pumpkin pie. A nice color and a rich aroma of spices. One sip and I wanted more. But, the alcohol level was a bit high for heavy drinking. On the other hand... I didn't notice any alcohol taste or burn while drinking the beer."
"D - Due to the low body of this beer and the myriad of flavors this beer becomes extremely drinkable even at 9%. I've never ventured past one bottle because my wallet wouldn't be able to take it as well as the fact that i can only drink so much spiced beer but this one definitely sits towards the top. Keep a bottle for yourself, no sharezies on this one."
"I am a huge fan of pumpkin products of all types, yet for some reason I am usually disappointed with pumpkin beers. This offering from Southern Tier however gives me a sense of renewed faith in the style. Pumpking is undoubtedly the best pumpkin ale I have tried to date."
"Certainly one of the best Pumpkin Ales out there. Pretty close tossup between this and DFH Punkin. It's a bit hard to drink though because the spices are so in your face."
"Pours a light copper with minimal head and lacing. The pumpkins really come out in the aroma. There is no mistaking this aroma. I just don't know if it makes a great flavor however. It lacks the usual spices one associates with pumpkins to round out the flavor. Even the high ABV is hidden by pumpkin. Hardly any beer qualities in the flavor. A medium body with low carbonation. If you like the taste of pumpkins you will probably enjoy this beer. I thought I did but it was just too overwhelming for me. I could taste pumpkins for a couple hours after drinking this bottle."
"This is the best pumpkin beer I've ever had, hands down. I really didn't know that a pumpkin beer could be this good. I always regarded pumpkin beers as little more than novelties that were good for a change of pace during the fall, and that was it. Not anymore. I'd drink this beer year-round. Of course, I imagine that during a chilly fall evening it would be absolutely sublime, but something this good can't be limited to one season. I may have to go out and stock up so I can at least have some for the whole winter. Anyway, that's enough praise from me. If you can find this, go out and get some immediately. Highly recommended."
"I love seasonal beers, be they in the spring, summer, fall or winter, but this by far is my most favorite seasonal beer. I have tried many of pumpkin beers, all of them unique and enjoyable, but this is deserving of the title of """King of Pumpkin Beers""". I've had this remarkable brew several times, and finally brought a bottle home to review. First off, this beer is amazing...it really smells and tastes just like a slice of pumpkin pie. There is an opaque creamy head when first poured into the tasting snifter. The color is a crystal clear orange, absolutely clear of any haze or sediment. The aroma is absolutely heavenly, with a mix of cinnamon, cloves and of course pumpkins. The taste is, well, you better get off your ass and find a bottle of this extraordinary ale before it's all gone."
"mouthfeel is light yet weighted, good carbonation, nice spice combo, a treat of a beer, another wonderful concoction from southern tier!"
"Other than the misleading name of the beer, this is a decent beer. I would serve it with turkey, regardless of the absence of pumpkin, because it is flavorful."
"D= This ale was a revelation. I am not usually a fan of fruit/vegetable beers but this was incredible and will definitely make an appearance at my Thanksgiving table."
"Very drinkable brew. This would go nicely with a few cookies or animal crackers or something with gingerbread maybe...very nice!"
"In typical Southern Tier fashion, this beer offered me more direct pumpkin pie flavor than any other Pumpkin Ale I have tried."
"What can I say, if you're in a pumpkin mood, look this one up."
"ok this is a very good beer but it does not taste like pumpkin pie .its a brown ale with more spice and for 9.0 the alcohal doesnt hit you to later . 7 bucks for a bomber i guess ill buy maybe 2 0r 3 more before halloween. southern tier makes real good stuff"
"Every year... this is the one that all others will henceforth be judged against, and that I will actively seek out when I can afford to."
"Drinkability: No taste of alcohol, but it's definitely up there - the 10 oz. snifter was just enough. That being said, probably the best pumpkin beer I've ever had. Very authentic and well balanced, well-spiced, and scrumptious. Recommended."
"Had on tap at Buk's in Boston. Served in a 12 oz tumbler, pourd a dark orange with a good size off-white head. Smellso fo cinammon and pumpkin pie with a hnt of roasted dark malt. Great flavor. Good sweet, malty base with a nice finish of pumpkin pie, cinammon and sugar. Not over done at all on the pumpkin flavor and does not seem artificial like some do. Great beer. Would session it, but at 9% it may be dangerous."
"A clear, orangish body presented itself when poured into a goblet (followed directions on bottle and chilled at 40 degrees) with minimal head. I could go in detail about the spices, cinnamon and nutmeg, and the mild sweet malt/bread malt smell but I will describe the aroma in three words: pumpkin pie crust. Well, four, burnt pumpkin pie crust (maybe a touch of toasted malt). The taste is even better than the smell, as it is straight pumpkin pie. I love pumpkin pie, so that's why I rated taste so highly. It is smooth, medium-bodied, with some pepper and clove tucked behind a massive rush of pumpkin, cinnamon, hazel and a touch of bread. This is pumpkin pie to me. As great as it tasted, and at 9% they hid the ABV well (there is a slight warming sensation, but not an alcohol burn), I could only drink one bottle of this. I think sessioning this would turn my stomach."
"D - Very nice but not something I could drink all that much of. This is a swell ale for handing out candy to the neighborhood kids and maybe as an after dinner treat come Thanksgiving. You know... with pie. :)"
"pumpkin pie in a glass, tons of nutmeg and a pinch of cinniman with generous amounts of pumpkin in the mix, so far this is the king of the mountan as far as pumpkin ales go. this has flavor for days. the alcohal is hiden well in this one is a beer amoung beers, the top shelf no question. this is a beer i will buy ten of so that i can have them all year long."
"Amber/ orange color with a thin off-white head. Serious aroma of straight-up pumpkin pie - crust and all. This one seems to go for a more nutmeg/ hazelnut/ amaretto angle rather than most of the cinnamon/ allspice versions out there. The flavor is wild-ass pumpkin pie in a bottle, more so than others - much more. It's so good that it's bad. I hate it. But not really. It's not so much sweet as it is RICH. Like graham crackers baked with Crisco. But I can't finish this. It's cloying. But the aroma is delicious - food delicious, and the first few tastes are like dessert. But I can't go farther than an eight ounce pour. Split the 22oz. bottle with three people."
"D: Very drinkable as I was able to finish it, and when it was done I just wanted some more."
"I thought this was one of the best pumpkin beers that I have ever tasted. It poured golden to copper and had a huge nose of nutmeg and spice. I did not find it terribly sweet but like a pumpkin cookie. It had some notes of gram cracker to. I think it hides the 9% abv very well not hot at all. I would have another. I think this bee would pair well with a pumpkin mousse pie very nice because of the gram cracker notes."
"D- It's highly drinkable, however the alcohol is not as well-hidden as in some other ST imperials."
"One of my favorite pumpkin ales so far. This one does a good job of mimicing pumpkin pie, which my mom always makes at Thanksgiving. Smooth and creamy with just the right amount of spices. Not really any notable hop bitterness (as it should be), mostly a sweet beer, with the balance coming from spices. Good job with this one for a beer that's very hard to get right. Recommended."
"22 ounce bottle. Served in a Sam Adams BL glass, the beer pours an orange/amber color with about an inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both decent. The aroma is very nice, it smells like nutmeg, pumpkin pie, cinnamon and brown sugar. Taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes pretty much just like a pumpkin pie would. Mouthfeel/body is medium and rich with mild carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's very smooth and easy to drink. Alcohol is well hidden. I think this is the most pumpkin-like of any pumpkin ale I've had before, it would be a great drink when the weather starts to get a bit cooler and fall gets here. It's a dessert beer (IMO), I don't think I could drink more than a bomber of this at a time as the pumpkin gets to be a bit too much. But with that being said, I think it's a pretty good brew and I'd buy it again."
"Tried this beer at a tasting a few weeks ago and decided to pick up a bottle recently. Beer is a crystal clear copper with a foam head that recedes into a nice lacing. Smell is fantastic, nice and spicy, much like a pumpkin pie. With the creamy mouthfeel the beer tastes like Dreyer's Pumpkin Pie ice cream! Very tasty beer that I will buy again. One of the best pumpkin beers I have tried."
"This would be perfect to top off your Halloween night. I still have yet to try it against my favorite pumpkin brew, Dogfish Head's Punkin Ale. Then I can decide which is the best. Long live Púca!"
"This is a winner from Southern Tier. No problem to drink a bomber at all. Alcohol is not noticeable. Everything about this beer compliments the pumpkin character so well. It's really a joy to drink, and I don't think I've ever downed an ST bomber so fast. I'm left giddy at the end of this."
"I'm glad I had a chance to try this beer, but I can't say I was very impressed. This will the be the first and last glass I'll ever get of it."
"D. Wow, what a tasty treat this was. I debated having another, but decided to move on. The best Pumpkin brew I've had to date."
"The bottom line: If you want pumpkin pie beer, then Southern Tier has got your brew. Very evocative of Fall, and a very effective pairing of the spices, pumpkin, and bread. If you like this type of beer, Pumking is a must try."
"Taste is more pumpkin pie. Just like the smell. Pumpkin of course, with loads malt that tastes like a graham cracker. Lots of spicy nutmeg, cinnamon, and all spice. A little more spice than I prefer. Nice vanilla flavor in there also. Mouthfeel could be a little more full for my liking but not bad. Not something you would want to drink all of the time but a damn fine dessert beer. Give me one of these instead of pie after dinner at Thanksgiving and I would be fine."
"D- Great seasonal beer, very interesting but its too much and over the top. I'd for sure have to split this one with someone."
"Pours a really gorgeous medium amber color with a very bright orange feel to it. A solid half inch of white head is formed but soon dissolves to a trace. Aroma is intensely of fresh cooked Jasmine rice, like right when you open lid to see if it's done. Wow; spices follow with a bit of ginger and clove, and then nutmeg and a hint of cinnamon. It's extremely bready as the rice note dissipates. Really solid for a pumpkin ale, I have to say. On the palate, the breadiness really flourishes with the spices evident but never cloying and a warm sweetness to give both a pumpkin bread flavor and to cover the abv. Carbonation is moderately low providing a richer, bigger body. This is a really world class beer, ST is simply shining with these BW series of beers. I wish them luck in continuing this success."
"The spices are all in check and make this guy pretty easy to drink. A good sipper with dessert around halloween."
"This would make a great bonfire night beer. It is definitely a right """time and place""" beer, not one I would sip at just any time of day."
"D: The alcohol is quite well hidden. Bitterness comes through quite a it more as it warms, which can be a little off-putting and changes the dynamic a bit. Certainly a sipper, this could be a reasonable 'time-to-time' brew. As far as pumpkin style ales go, this is a bit of a better take on the style, though."
"Drinks easily but with a pumpkin desert this would be absolutely perfect. I don't think this beer could be any more enjoyable overall"
"D-I could drink this all the time I don't want to but i could. I wanna have this with my thanksgiving dinner."
"This poured a clear amber color with a bit of white head. It smelled like baked pumpkin seeds and yeasty barley grain, with a bit of caramel malt and copper hops. It tasted strongly of sweet pumpkin mixed with earthy malt, and a yeasty pie crust flavor along with a sense of whipped cream. It was watery with no carbonation, and had a lasting but mellow pumpkin aftertaste. Overall this was definitely pumpkin, but not definitely beer. The flavor was clean and hid the alcohol well, and was great if you like pumpkin. Personally, I think it could have used more subtlety."
"A bit of head on the pour. Nice copper color. Smells great, of grandma's old pumpkin bread. Very spicy on the nose. Pumpkin, bread and cinnamon shine through. A bit watery on the taste, surprising because of the high ABV. Decent drinkability, but only one cause of the high ABV. A real treat that can replace dessert at thanksgiving dinner. Very intreging beer."
"Drinkability- Exccedingly high, which is what you will be after 2 or 3 of these."
"nice... my favorite pumkin beer to date. orange with a white head that leaves pretty lace. really smells of cooked pumpkin and graham cookie/ ginger snaps. well, well balanced taste with a burnt toffee finish. nice, creamy mouthfeel. i think southern tier did a fantastic job on this one. it would be hard to drink too many of these, so it looses points for drinkability, but big props to southern tier nonetheless."
"Never had a beer that taste more like Nabisco honey graham cracker crust. Awesome."
"Drinkability: There's too much going on in terms of spice to hammer this one away, but as a session drink around Thanksgiving - one to be shared - wow, this is a dandy. Love it."
"This is a tasty treat. Pick this one up if you see it."
"HV"
"Overall: My first brew from Southern Tier, and I'm impressed. This is a great pumpkin ale."
"By far one of the best pumpkin ales I've ever had. Weyerbacher was my previous favorite but this may take the cake."
"Very approachable. I'm sure it would pair well with food as well as a cool fall evening. A bewitching seasonal offering that I plan on revisiting again in the near future...BEFORE the next full moon."
"Mouthfeel is a little heavier than most pumpkin ales, which says a lot since most are on the thin side. Most excellent example of the style. A new fall favorite"
"Pours a clear dark orange/copper color, rapidly diminishing white head, little spots of lacing on the glass. Smells like a pumpkin pie, somehow it smells mostly like a pie crust (or maybe that's just the pumpkin being evocative?), and tons of nutmeg. Taste falls in line with the smell, only with a slightly vague bitterness on the back end. Slightly thin on the mouthfeel for me, some lingering bitter qualities, some nice mouth-coating sweetness/spiciness. I couldn't have been more excited to try this one...love Southern Tier and damn near everything they do, but this one let me down just a bit. Maybe too much anticipation?"
"Poured into a tulip glass out of a 22oz bottle. Deep orange color with about a 2 finger head. The only scent I got was pumpkin, like an old jack-o-lantern. The only taste I got was pumpkin. It was like biting right into a ripe pumpkin. The mouth feel was silky and smooth. I think the only thing this beer needed was some more spice to give it that pumpkin pie quality. But hey, to each his own."
"CHEERS"
"Mouthfeel is clean and light with a slight pinch."
"Bought an 08 bottle of this from Marty's In Newton today. Poured in to my Duvel tulip a clear orange color, with little heading. Nose is intoxicating. It smells as close to pumpkin pie as it gets with beer. Once again, Southern Tier hit a bulls eye with aroma. Taste has pie crust, pumpkin, spice and a hint of vanilla ice cream. Body is heavy, and drinkability is quite good. Alcohol is in there, and makes itself known, so this is one to be sipped. This is my second favorite beer from the guys at Southern Tier next to their Oat. By far the best Pumpkin beer I have tasted, with Weyerbacher following not far behind. Cheers"
"Decently drinkable, maybe my bias against the style makes it lower, maybe not. Good beer though, the more i drank the nicer it got."
"Definitely recommended..."
"The best pumpkin beer I have ever had, far superior to Saranac or Post Road. Ive tried several other beers from this brewery(Phil & Matts extraordinary ale, Hop Sun, Raspberry Wheat, Raspberry porter) and the only other decent one is the raspberry porter if you like porters. Ive seen great reviews for the rest of their beers but I totally disagree."
"2008 bottling from Whole Foods Vienna: I thought anise cookie before I even looked back at this review, must be dong something right. Much the same as last year and certainly a pleasure. No scores changed."
"Pours clear and light orange with a huge white head. Smell is big, rich and actual meaty pumpkin like more so than the actual spices which are present but in milder doses than usual. Taste and body are both dull and odd to me. The alcohol is hidden pretty well, but I was not a fan of this beer at all, and am coming to find I don't care for much of anything this brewer makes. Obviously many love it, but I have many other pumpkin beers I prefer."
"D- Most defininely a dessert beer. Way too much character (+ too high ADV) to session. Oh how I do love it though!"
"D: Overall a very good beer by itself, outstanding per style. It is what it is, a big alcohol spice beer. Some may find it a tad over the top spice and sweetness wise but southern tier always goes big on their beers and this is certainly no exception."
"Bottle courtesy of Hogtownharry: Poured a deep clear orangey color ale with a medium size foamy head with OK retention but no lacing. Aroma of cinnamon with loads of pumpkin. Taste is also dominated by loads of pumpkin and some cinnamon and light cloves. Body has a nice creamy texture with some average carbonation. I was really enthralled by this beer; I thought there were too much pumpkin purée and not enough spices. I guess I am more of a spices kind of guy then a pumpkin."
"Overall a unique and flavorful pumpkin ale. The flavor was a touch too heavy for my taste however."
"A trick and a treat - what every pumpkin ale wants to be when it grows up! Nice, pumpkin/amber color with solid head. Pumpkin, vanilla and plentiful hops emerge to smell like Thanksgiving dessert. Even drinks like the hoppiest pumpkin pie you've come across in a long time. Well-balanced with a nice, efficient finish. Something to savor during the fall - an after-dinner drink and dessert all in one. Amazing stuff!"
"D- 1 pint is definitely delicious and very tasty but it is so sweet I don't know if I could handle more."
"Pours a nice golden orange color, nice carbonation, nice little creamy off-white head, nice sticky lacing follows. The nose is malty, popcorn, pumpkin, nutmeg, cinimmon, and some caramel. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, popcorn, pumpkin/nutmeg, slight cinimmon and some caramel tones. The alcohol is hidden pretty well at 9% ABV. Medium body. Very drinkable, a different pumpkin ale, especially with the popcorn taste, never had one to date like this, recommended. Thanks Steve."
"Truly an amazing brew and I am dissapointed I only have/had one bottle. This is hands down the best pumpking beer I have ever had the fortune to consume."
"This one was a clear orange with an off-white head. Good staying power with a little lacing. The aroma was really spicy, lots of nutmeg, pie spice, quite perfumey. Spices dominated the flavour too, probably providing some of the bitterness as well. Nutmeg was quite strong throughout with some alcohol flavour and warmth at the finish. Fairly dry, medium bodied with average carbonation. Though it wasn't bad at all, this was just a nutmeg overload for me."
"Pours a clear orange, medium sized white head forms, leaves a nice lace ring, decent retention. Smell is wicked, lots of ginger, pumpkin, nutmeg, bread, cinnamon, some caramel, lots going on, very nice. Taste is similar, caramel and bread, pumpkin, lots of ginger, nutmeg and cinnamon, some cloves, very nice and clean spicy finish, alcohol is well contained. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation, very smooth, perfect spices and the ginger really differentiates it from most pumpkin ales. Thanks Tim!"
"Looks pretty much like an O'fest - orange-amber body topped by an off-white head. Aroma has a bit of spice and some caramel malt notes. Flavor has a lot of pumpkin spice notes, not a lot of hop notes in there, just enough to balance the malts. Mouthfeel is good, but maybe a bit astringent. Drinkability is still decent though. This is the first pumpkin type beer I've actually liked."
"Drinkability- This is the perfect Pumpkin Ale. Ive had quite a few of these Pumpkin brews in the last couple months and this one is by far the best Ive had, hands down. Its rich and smooth and really is exactly how Ive always pictured these types of brews tasting. Great job by Southern Tier and big thanks to LittleBreeze."
"Drinkability- A great after a holiday meal beer or just taking in the foliage. It reminds you of fall."
"Bottle at our Septoberfest party. This beer is a clear dark copper color with a medium off-white head with decent retention. Patchy lacing. Aroma of pumpkin pie and allspice. Medium-bodied with a very nice pumpkin flavor. So many pumpkin beers seem to veer too far into the spice side but this one has a very good pumpkin pie and caramel malt flavor with touches of ginger and allspice. The finish is sweetly spiced and completes the """liquid pumpkin pie""" equation. Well done overall."
"Good, full body, very soft carbonation, not overly sweet. Alcohol is so well hidden. This is the best pumpkin beer I have had so far."
"D-Town Hall makes a hell of a pumpkin and this is right there with that that. The graham cracker is truly unique and the pumpkin is pumpkin, not some all-spice mix...great beer...one of a kind....one everyone should try..splendid..."
"Even mouthfeel, moderately carbonated. Average drinkability for me due to overly corny, buttery flavor."
"Update: have had this since...I appreciate that the pumpkin really comes through without interference from additional holiday spices...pumpkin isn't an overwhelming aroma or flavor but they managed to get the pure pumpkin fully expressed in this beer. Top notch for style."
"D: With the first taste, this was certainly in my personal 'Top 3' of pumpkin ales (with Elysian & Weyerbacher). Rich and flavorful without leaning too hard on spice for content. Superb drinkability on it's own; all too easy to finish a bottle of this tasty brew. I will seek this one out next fall - East Coast BA's, you've been warned!"
"Southern Tier Pumking isn't the best Imperial pumpkin ale that I've ever had (Elysian Night Owl), nor is it the best all-around pumpkin ale that I've ever had (Smuttynose). Still, it's a more than worthy seasonal that lovers of the style owe it themselves to seek out."
"Drinkability is good. A bomber is a bit much for one person. But this is still easily the best pumpkin beer I have ever had. Lots of spicy pumpkin flavors, without a lot of sweetness... tasty beer! But it should probably be shared."
"Although this is one of the few Pumpkin beers that I've somewhat enjoyed, I don't have a lot to say about it. My single comment is essentially: """It's like drinking a ginger snap.""" It smells like a gingerbread cookie and tastes like a gingerbread cookie. I wouldn't want to drink a lot of it, but maybe half a bomber after dinner would be nice. The alcohol (guessing it's somewhat above average) is well-hidden as well (which just adds to the drinking cookie feeling)."
"Try it with a friend so you dont have to drink it all by yourself."
"Drinkability: Very good pumpkin ale. This is not a style that lends itself to drinking a lot of it, but this is about as good a the style can get. Very good job by Southern Tier. Especially nice on a nice cold night. Will search this one out again come next fall."
"Mouthfeel is full and very creamy, and the drinkability as good."
"It's an ok, pumpkin ale, but I think there are far better (Dogfish Head, Smuttynose, Pumpkin Post Road by Brooklyn and Cottonwood). Interesting, yet not all that exciting."
"Drinkability: Just too spicy for me."
"Bar none, the best pumpkin beer out there. What a great way to warm up for Thanksgiving tomorrow. I just hope the pie is this good."
"Drinkability - decent ale, but I'd want a change of taste after one or two, and the ale's high abv limits sessionability anyway."
"One of the best pumpkin ales I've had, I do recommend it. Still, the drinkability is limited with the sweetness and spiciness."
"After a few discriminating sips, this sucker found the bottom of the drain. What started out as an olfactory delight, turned out to be the most extreme example of what I generally dislike about most pumpkin beers."
"D: Crazy for its weight/strength."
"Thanks Mike and Jason for bringing. Above average pumkin beer, orange with soapy head, and noteable lacing. Significant carbonation behind nutmeg,allspice,vanilla, maybe some cinammon. Creamy carmel. hops kick in at the end. An aroma experience. 9% not perceived."
"Flavors are pretty much the same as my review above though I do notice a more hop presence. I just don't get enough pumpkin flavor out of this brew for it to be great, it has too much of a baked crust/cookie flavor."
"The beer pours an amber color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great. It has an awesome pumpkin scent that's almost pie-like. This has got to be the best aroma on a pumpkin beer ever. Not only do you smell the pumpkin, but you can smell the spices and the crust. The taste is awesome. This is as close to heaven in a bottle as you can get. This would be great with Thanksgiving dinner. It's liquid dessert. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate/good carbonation. This is a fantastic seasonal; maybe the best fall seasonal ever."
"Drinkability: Nice pumpkin ale with a slightly different twist because of the vanilla flavors I tasted. Still prefer Weyerbacher's Imperial Pumpkin Ale though!"
"Mouthfeel is buttery sweet and bitter...odd."
"Very complex. In the other pumpkin beers I have tried, I've enjoyed the more subtle ones (DFH, Smutty). Count this one as a win for the more """in your face""" versions. Only complaint is that the pie spices seemed to linger a bit much in the aftertaste."
"The taste does not disappoint! Starts off with toasted malts and subtle spicy hops. And then the spices and toffee malt goodness come on strong. Caramel corn sweetness and butteriness take center stage, accompanied by pumpkin pie spices, nutmeg, white chocolate, and candied pecans. Finish is sweet and caramel-y with lingering spices and faint spicy hop bitterness. Slightly warming. Full-bodied with a sticky, mouth-coating feel. Very well done! By far the best pumpkin beer I've ever had."
"This is one beer to savor over a crisp fall night. A version all the sweet artificial tasting pumpkin beers can aspire to be."
"D- Its a damn good pumpkin beer, especially for my first one of the season."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: This brew has a good body, nice and full and carbonation doesn't get in the way either. Finish is great, leaving an aftertaste that lingers for quite a while. This is a beer I'll seek out again. Mind you, this isn't the typical pumpkin ale, it is very unique however, it is very good. I don't know if I'd classify this in the same class as Dogfish Head and Schlafly since these are something that is almost completely different in style. In my mind they are traditional pumpkin ales, whereas this isn't, hey, as the label says, Imperial Pumpkin Ale. It is different from a pumpkin ale, I don't know how to describe this, you'll just have to try it for yourself. I guess you could say its kind of like comparing Granny Smith Apples to Crab apples or Kumquats to Oranges-same family but different."
"My goodness, I never thought I would say this about a pumpkin ale, but this is an incredible beer! I have found the one pumpkin ale that is worth coming back to again and again and again. I can only hope that this is an annual seasonal. Wow. Not sure what else to say...wow."
"It tasted great, that is it tasted like pumpkin pie and good beer. No idea what the alcohol content is and the website doesn't say either but it was balanced well with the flavors. It also had a thick body that was both good and bad depending on if you want to chug this beer or sip on it with thanksgiving dinner. Overall its a pretty drinkable beer and I would like to find more of this stuff."
"Pours a crystal clean and a distinctly rust orange color with a full finger lightly orange head that fades fairly quickly. The smell is really nice. Its got that meaty baked pumpkin pie and cinnamon nutmeg aroma. Adequately carbonated, the mouth feel is creamy. Full flavored, the baked pumpkin taste is hearty and the amount of nutmeg/spice is right on target...IMO, the spices in so many pumpkin ales are over done. This one is really good. I also recently enjoyed Gordon Gerski's version at the Power Plant Brewery in Parkville, MO. The smell, mouth feel and flavor of this one complement each other well. Very drinkable...the 9% ABV is well hidden. I'm going to stock up on these for the holiday. Well done!!!"
"Creamy and rich, medium-full-in body and super smooth. Light carbonation on the tongue. Big and flavorful, intriguing, and easy to drink in a non-session beer kind of way. A top pumpkin beer."
"One of the better Pumpkin Ales i've ever tried, very unique nose and taste, definately worth a shot"
"Good body and carbonation, this is a good Fall sipper. I wish I had another."
"This beer pours with some viscosity. It produces a muddied and murky orange beer with a thin white head. The lace is spotty. This is definitely not your typical pumpkin beer aroma. Instead of the bombardment of spices, this beer has some depth to the nose. It's very earthy and vegetal and smells the most like actual cooked PUMPKIN than any other beer I've smelled. And graham cracker. Big graham cracker notes. The nose is so strong and intriguing. I just keep picking it up to resmell again and again. It really grows on me and I like the aroma more and more. The spices on the nose are secondary and quite suitable. I get a little cinnamon and fresh nutmeg. The beer tastes like it smells. But I pick up some clove and ginger on the buds as well. Again, the spicing is fairly light, which is good. Then the cooked pumpkin base and crystal like maltiness can do their thing. Graham cracker maltiness is huge. Vanilla bean, pistachios and a little nougat add complexity. The alcohol is hidden quite nicely. For an imperial pumpkin ale, this does not feel """imperial""" in an alcholic sense. The body is medium to medium-full. I'd have to say this is one of the best (and easily the most intriguing) pumpkin ales I've had. It's like a subtley spiced pumpkin pie sitting on a very noticeable crumbly graham cracker crust with a nice dollop of homeade whipped cream on top."
"Appears a vibrantly clear amber hue forms a light thin white head and as it dwindles lacing sticking to the glass was pretty minimal. This was on tap at Fathead's a couple weeks ago, I had to give in to the Imperial Pumpking, plus I have this whole infatuation thing going on with most of Southern Tier's brews. Aromatics caramel roasted nutty brown sugar with melted butter, whipped cream, and an air of popcorn Jelly Belly jellybeans. Spices and alcohol are flowing as well but the nutmeg, allspice combo don't stick out as much compared to other pumpkin ales out there. Flavors bring to mind pumpkin chiffon pie with pumpkin puree', cinnamon, allspice, and nutmeg with a whipped cream sweetness but once again that buttery popcorn flavor came out thank god my portion was a 12oz snifter. Alcohol enters the mix with a smooth burn, but it's hard to get over that """circus peanut""" candy marshmallow creaminess it just gets cloying. Mouthfeel is full bodied syrupy sticky with residual sugars creamy bodied with even carbonation flows decently well in small sips. Drinkability is for me an absolute dessert only beer really hard to throw this into a drinking session, plus the high abv can stick it to ya. I applaud the effort to be original with the pumpkin ales but this extreme imperial effort fell short compared to the rest of Southern Tier beers on the market."
"I know, this is a huge review. 5s almost accross the oard. I do believe, however, that on BA we review according to the style as well as personal taste. This is perhaps one of the better pumpkin ales out there. It beats the heck out of Bufalo Bill's, O'Fallons, Blue Moon... weriously, nothing can touch this brew. Don't believe me, go try some, become addicted, and support the brewery to make more of this year round. Truly exceptional."
"Well done and keep up the good work!"
"Highly recommended. If this beer is sold in your area this fall, go out and get some!"
"Drinkability: A big, flavorful pumpkin brew; among the best if not the very best"
"We couldn't find any on the shelves at the local store and had to ask. I'm certainly going to go out of my way to get this again - next time, a case."
"Overall: The greatest Pumpkin beer on earth. That being said I havent had a few of the other highly rated ones but to be honest I can't see anyone outdoing this one. Pure dessert in a bottle. I am going to make a pumpkin float out of my last remaining bottle as dessert after Thanksgiving dinner. Can't wait to try it out. As always thanks a million to BeerTruth a true BA trading god."
"One bomber of this may be plenty as far as what the palate can handle, but at 9% that is plenty fine drinkability. Not precisely dessert in a bottle but it could easily serve as one, or pair really well with cake of some sort. Yes, definitely pair this with a pastry if you're going to eat something."
"Typical Southern Tier bomber etched on label bottle, no freshness info offered. Pours clear light glowing orangy amber. Long lasting near white head. The expected pumkiny/fall spicied nose. Plenty of more pumpkin notes in this full flavor, strong fall seasonal, sweetness and a winey note late. Nice fall sipper, with a long, spicy finish. More quality brew from ST. Not my favorite style, but I would go for this one again, if it a was fall and I had a hankering for a decent drinking pumpkin style brew."
"D- This is the most pumpkin tasting pumpkin ale I have had as of yet. And 9% ABV? I never would have guessed that. There is no detection of alcohol anywhere in this brew. I really love Southern Tier and I am on a Southern Tier kick right now. They really put out great beers that are great examples of the style. As far as Pumpkin Ales go-I do think I enjoy Weyerbacher a hair more due to its spiciness; but this brew definitely has more authentic pumpkin flavor."
"Overall- By far the closest to pumpkin pie I've ever tasted in a beer! 1 bomber is enough though."
"D- Not bad, but not my first choice. It was nice to try a different spin on a popular seasonal style."
"This beer is creamy with lighter carbonation. The bomber emptied rather quickly on me. Oh well, guess I will have to go get another."
"Drinkability: Decent. Good flavour, fairly well balanced. Better with a meal than on its own."
"Update. This might be my desert island beer."
"d - nicely done. goes down smooth and really takes this style to a whole other level."
"First sip delivers a big pumpkin wallop with some dry nutmeg/cinnamon in the aftertaste. It has some breadiness, contributing to a fuller mouthfeel. The spices kind of hang around in the back of the throat with a light bitterness. Everything is big and pretty well balanced. Like I mentioned before, this is a good one to share, not exactly a sessioner."
"Drinkability: I loved drinking this beer. I love the desert character that the spices and the pumpkin bring to the table, and I can definitely see myself sipping a few of these after a good meal or while relaxing in front of the television."
"D- Very rich and flavorful. This was actually kind of beastly. This is the king of pumpkin beers, but it is not necessarily the best one."
"Overall, the best pumpkin beer you will ever try. I'm going to pick up several more before the season is over."
"Drinkability: great tasting and easy to quaff pumpkin beer. I always thought DFH had the best pumpkin ale, but this is right there with it."
"After trying many different pumpkin ales through the years this is definitely the best ever! I was a little unsure about this 9% abv pumpkin beer but after you have one taste you know this stuff is great. The appearance looks great, the smell is amazing with the smell of hops, pumpkin, and spices. The taste is a mouthful of flavors with lingering suprises after you take a drink. The mouthfeel has a nice body but not too rich or thick and not too thin or watery, just right. For a 9% abv beer it is very easy to drink, I counldn't see having any problem sitting down and drinking a few bottles (22oz) of this stuff. It is truly the best pumpkin ale ever made and is rightfully named as the Pumking! Southern Tier once again creates a masterpiece of a beer. Can't wait to see what they have in store for the future."
"D-This one lives up to the hype. This is more roasted pumpkin with spices than pumpkin pie. Really unique and more pumpkin flavoured than any other """pumpkin ale""" I have had. This actually makes me rethink what I know about the style."
"Great Job by the Southern Tier Brewing group on this Pumpkin Ale!!!"
"Pours an amber, orange, brownish color with thick and creamy white head. Lacing on this one is fair and does not stick around for too long. Aroma is thick, heavy, and reminds me of grandmas kitchen on thanksgiving (although, we always had thanksgiving at my parents... odd); Caramel, cookie dough, sweet cinnamon and vanilla, and PUMPKIN of course. This one smells like a freshly baked pumpkin pie and I feel like I can put whip cream on the top of this one. Taste is heavily sweet with all the above aromas now tickling the palate. I find some cinnamon and nutmeg and this flavor lasts a while. Delicious beer to share, since it is a heavy one."
"So, I wouldnt want to drink more than a glass in one sitting but otherwise this is a startling good beer and loads of fun to experience."
"Bought a bomber of this from the Empty Pint a few weeks back. Had it adorning my bar until last night, when my wife and I decided to pop it open. Left it in the fridge just long enough to get a slight chill, then poured into a pair of tumblers. The golden-copper ale poured nicely, bringing out a half-inch of cream head, which faded quickly to a slight lacing. The appearance alone had reminded me of my aunt's pumpkin pie, with a dollop of whipped cream. The smell only enhanced that sensation. Nutmeg, cinnamon, allspice, ginger, and PUMPKIN. This was a glass of freshly baked pumpkin pie. The pumpkin flavor takes a backseat to all the spices. Nutmeg and cinnamon come out strongest at first, with a light malty hint, and a clove aftertaste dances on your tongue after the beer has left your mouth. The creamy ale is not too bold in any one respect, and feels quite pleasant in the mouth, and going down. It's hard to tell with all the spices that this is an imperial. This should be enjoyed as the dessert to your Thanksgiving meal. And just like said dessert, you shouldn't have too much of it. As I mentioned before, it would be easy to forget that this was an imperial."
"Drinkability: Fantastic - the 9% is unnoticeable on the palate. Just a phenomenal beer that I will certainly revisit this season before it disappears from shelves"
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability- well since this is my first glass I cant say I can down this entire growler because this beer has some pretty strong tastes in it but it is by far the easiest drinking 9.0abv I have ever had for sure. I agree with others it is very drinkable and therefore very dangerous."
"Cheers!"
"Pretty great Pumpkin beer. I don't know if I have had better. It just smells so damn good."
"I knew this was a great brew as soon as I popped the top and took a whiff, then continued to pour and consume. This was dessert in a bottle, I would love to try the draught if I can find it. The 9.0 abv is sure to warm your cool fall nights, try it if you find it."
"D: This is a damn tasty pumpkin and one I would gladly drink anytime. I hope ST keeps this one in rotation every fall and that more of it makes its way to MA."
"Save one of these for after your Thanksgiving meal. It'll pair well with dessert. More than one in the same sitting would be nauseating for me."
"Popped open a bomber of this last Sunday night and poured it into two pint glasses. The first thing you notice is the smell. This is one of the best smelling pumpkin beers I have ever had. It almost overwhelms your nose with smells of pumpkin and spice. This must be where the """imperial""" name comes in, as it seems to be a notch more that other beers. The taste is what I expected from a good pumpkin beer, and it's only amplified by the smell. The only drawback (minor) with this brew is that since it's so aggressively spiced, it would be hard to drink a few of these. This beer was a nice one-glass accompaniment to a nice fall season dessert we shared."
"It has turned a hater into a disciple. I'll buy this whenever and wherever I see it."
"The true King of pumpkin ales!"
"drinkability: good"
"Pours a clear light copper hue with a one finger white head that quickly dies down to a very thin layer with a bit of stickiness. Smell is pumpkin pie through and through with sweet cinnamon, whip cream, bready crust, and a hint of cloves. I love this smell, absolutely love it. Wow, on the tongue it's very creamy and tastes like real pumpkins unlike most others of the style that seems to be very artificial. Amazing spices makes the taste of this like I'm eating my very own grandma's pumpkin pie. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a decent amount of carbonation. I have absolutely no clue where the 9% abv comes from, but I can easily put this one down. No artificial flavors, no overpowering spices or pumpkin flavors, Southern Tier has perfected this style. Pretty skeptical about this style, but Southern Tier has completely reversed my feelings about pumpkin beers. Do whatever you can to get this beer. Southern Tier once again amazes and continues to make big beers that satisfy. One of a kind beer, truly the """King""" of the style."
"Looks nice and what do I get on the first sniff? Pie crust. Pie crust? Yeah, and nutmeg, lots of nutmeg. Same goes for the flavor, lots of nutmeg. there's maybe a touch of vanilla, and biscuit crust-like grains, but mostly nutmeg. I'm a little disappointed I didn't really get much pumpkin, but at least this beer was pretty unlike anything I've had before."
"D - Best pumpkin beer I have tried. Not sure how many other places use real pumpkin but I think you can really tell the difference. The real pumpkin creates a fresher taste and a different spicing."
"D=The ABV, the sweetness, and the spices all conspire to hinder the drinkability of this one. On their own, they wouldn't be bad, but altogether, they prove a bit much. I'll be able to finish the 22 oz. bomber, but wouldn't be able to drink much more of this. This is exactly what it should be... an excellent representation of a pumpkin beer that should be consumed once in awhile on a nice cool fall evening. I also bought a couple to put away for a bit... we'll see what some age does to this. Great to see brewers try beers like these. I will buy more..."
"Pours a orange-ish color with a white head that does not hang around. Aromas of allspice, cinnamon, and brown sugar. In the taste, a small spiciness but all pumpkin. A nice balance of taste. A smooth and somewhat watery mouthfeel with a big pumpkin and spicey aftertaste. Hides the alcohol very well, nice spice, and big pumpkin flavor. It might be the best one I have had yet."
"Mouthfeel here is medium bodied and creamy with a sturdy carbonation. Goes down really smooth with no sense of this being a 9% brew either. This is a damn fine pumpkin ale and quite possibly my new favorite as it keeps me coming back sip after sip. Intensely spicy and perfect for fall after a day at the pumpkin patch. Keep kicking ass Southern Tier! Glad to have ya in Chicago."
"Great amber color. The nose is impeccable with pumpkin pie laced by whipped cream. On the palate, it has the same characteristics of the aroma on the front, but the 9% abv shows up on the back. Overall, a great brew for those cool autumn nights and old pagan rituals."
"D: I was actually very surprised when I saw that this was 9% ABV. This is a pretty decent pumpkin beer all around."
"Pours a clear pumpkin orange with a thick white head that dies quick and doesnt really lace. Such a shocking smell. I thought Weyerbacher Imperial Pumpkin was huge but this takes the er.. pie. Literally like a fresh one of Grandmas famous pumpkin pies was shoved in my nostrils. Tastes the same as the smell. I feel like I should be putting whip cream on this beer. Big pumpkin, nutmeg, maybe cinnemon. Unbelievable. ABV is non existant. Full in the mouth and is thick but delicious. I didnt sip this, I ate this beer up."
"22 oz bomber. I like to take a sniff of the brew after I pop the cap to see what the first aromas to escape the bottle are, and this one surprised me. Creamed corn. Okay, moving on. The brew is a deep copper color with a small head that falls to a light coating over top. Clarity is excellent and there are a few bubbles in the liquid. The aroma is really giving me impressions of corn. Sweet cornbread, creamed corn, maybe some butternut squash with a mild to moderate nutmeg spice. These are all corn aromas I really enjoy, so it is not bad, just not what I am expecting from a pumpkin brew. The flavor brings definite pumpkin flesh flavors, but this one has a lot more sweetness that I can attribute to the pumpkin than others in the ilk. It still just strikes me as cornbread and creamed corn. The spicy nutmeg comes through well into the finish, and there is just a hint of bitterness on the finish which compliments the nutmeg. Mouthfeel is moderate with a solid moderate carbonation of fine bubbles. This is a nice brew. I like the contrast in how the pumpkin is manifested in this one, as a more sweet flavor. I just can't get away from the corn description on this one. A fine brew."
"Pours a golden orange,with a thin white head. Not much retention,with just a bit of lacing. Aroma is of a pumpkin patch.This beer just smells like autumn.It is is a medium bodied beer with light carbionation. Taste is of spiced pumpkin pie.This is by far the best pumpkin ale I've ever had.Excllent!!"
"9% ABV per label.I like the concept of the Imperial pumpkin ale but in the end it just didnt seem to hit home with me,poured into an impy pint glass a clear deep copper with some dark orange tint a thinner wispy head atop.Full on spice and alcohol in the aroma maybe even a bit much in the spice department,heavy cardamom and clove with a dose of vanilla bourbon it becomes a bit boozy after it warms a little.Spice and booze overpower the palate in my mind very spiced like the nose cardamom and clove with a lingering cinnamon that bourbon vanilla booze hits and hits hard making a bit tough to swallow after awhile for me some dryer toastiness tries to show thru but it faint.I think a little over the top for me I still like the concept but this was just to much for me."
"Probably my favorite pumpkin ale so far , highly recommended."
"Final Note: It's no wonder that this is the #1 brew of this style. If you like Pumpkin Ale, this is one brew worth searching for or trading for, by far, the best Pumpkin Ale I've ever had."
"9-22-07 - 3.5/4.5/4.5/5/4.5 - Got this one because I've been consistently blown away by everything I've had from Southern Tier (save maybe the mediocre Tripel). I was not disappointed here. I'm not even a big pumpkin ale fan, but this one was just incredible. Pours a red-orange color, with a samll head that drops quickly, leaving no real lacing. Nose is crazy spices, nutmeg and some citrus. Flavors are similarly excellent - tons of full caramel malt, pumpkin, nutmeg, allspice. Light fruit flavors floating around. Great body, full and creamy, with perfect carbonation. Overall, I really loved this one. A great dessert beer."
"It's my favorite pumpkin beer, what can I say. Far better on tap."
"Full bodied and smooth as silk, one of the tastiest pumpkin ales I've had."
"If you at all like pumpkin beers, this is different enough from the typical to be worth seeking out."
"D - Extremely tasty, possibly the best pumpkin ale I have tasted yet. The smell is like a pumpkin candle very fragrant and drawing you in each time. The mouthfeel and taste work together to make it a consistently excellent ale from first sip to last. I would definitely love a case of this. The spice is used conservatively, and with great skill making this very easy to quaff, absolutely great."
"D- This beer has a screaming big pumpkin flavor with spicy qualities that makes this truly an imperial pumpkin beer. I think I will be tasting pumpkin for days. It is so strong that it taste almost chemical and it is hard to finish the whole beer. The pumpking is so big it is offensive."
"D: Earthy and natural flavors and aromas combined with a surprisingly non-existant 9% abv make for a very drinkable beer. Very delicious!"
"I can't believe I'm saying this, but this is a pumpkin beer that works! I also can't beleive this is 9% abv. It's a good thing I'm sharing this bomber. Nice job Southern Tier and I hope more of your beers hit this market soon - I've enjoyed the IPA for a few years now on my annual visits to Buffalo."
"Overall I was pretty dissapointed, I dont really know what I was expecting put it wasnt this."
"I split a bomber of this with some good friends. I poured my portion in my Mikasa ale glass. Pours a definite pumpkiny copper color with a thin white head. The foam dissipates fairly quickly. Very clear and bubbly look to the beer. The minute I stick my nose in it, I'm hit with a sweet vanilla fragrance. It's almost overwhelming, but then the pureed pumpkin and the pie spices come through. Not a very balanced beer, but there's a lot to play with - and that's to be expected from a Pumpkin Ale. As we kept smelling the beer, one of the guys finally pointed out that the sweet smell is like the dollop of whipped cream on the pie. He couldn't be more right! The tastes really line up with the aromas. You could seriously pour this beer into a pie tin and call it pumpkin pie. Strong flavors of the pumpkin and the spices (cinnamon, nutmeg, clove), plus the creamy sweetness of the whipped cream. A bit bready (the crust, perhaps?), plus a slightly burnt flavor at the end, like burnt sugar. Medium creaminess to the beer - not as thick as a stout, but very creamy for an ale. It complements the sweet vanilla-y flavors perfectly. Overall, an awesome beer. I loved drinking it. It's perhaps a little too sweet, but a must for any fan of pumpkin ales."
"BY FAR - the best pumpkin ale I have had to date - I am not sure if it can get any better. Get your hands on this one if possible..."
"The mouth on this is second to none. Thick full and creamy with an everlasting finish. The flavors are basically identical to the nose. Graham cracker, gingerbread, nutmeg, allspice, toffee, and hidden pumpkin. For 9% it shows like 5%. Very easy going and so delicious. Truly the """pumking""" of pumpkin ales. Too bad we didn't get more to sell. Not as ageworthy I'd guess as the Weyerbacher Imperial pumpkin but just waiting for Thanksgiving to have with dessert, as dessert or during a Thanksgiving day game. Go buy a few of these while it's around for that day or you may be sorry."
"This was the best pumpkin ale I've had yet. I really enjoy Post Road and Smuttynose pumpkin, Dogfish Punkin and even Cottonwood Pumpkin was great on tap. But this blows them away. It has a flavor that the others cannot come close to. You can even taste the pie crust in it, it is really like pumpkin pie. The smell is just like a pumpkin pie candle, and I had to stop a few times just to enjoy the smell. The taste is outstanding. The alcohol is extremely well masked and the smell and taste really fool you. The spices really play a large part in the flavor, and I'm amazed at how well they went with this beer. Thanks to DrinkinBuddy and slagle9480 for this awesome pumpkin ale, and hats off to Southern Tier for really impressing me with this one. Highly recommended for any fan of pumpkin ales, this is my new favorite among the rest."
"Good job to Southern Tier."
"Pours a nice orange/pumpkin color with little white head. Lacing doesn't last too long throughout the session. Smell is phenomenal, if you're a pumpkin fan, this is your brew.(fall has come early) Smell is definately reminiscent of pumpkin pie. Allspice, cinnamon, cloves, and ginger are all present in this brew, followed by a nice slight hoppy piney finish.(cascade) Mouthfeel is smooth with suttle carbination, but not much, not malty, little thin. Not bad though! Drinkability is definately good, but since this is a very sweet style, one is probably enough in itself. This is a 9.0 abv (imperial pumpkin ale) but the 9 is definately lost in the spices of the delicious pumpkin pie. Great brew!!!"
