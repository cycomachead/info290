There was some pumpkin and cinnamon but not as much as I thought there would be. The taste was great with a lot of pumpkin flavor up front and then spices such as nutmeg, cinnamon and I think cardamom come through. Really liked this one.","WhiteHillsStore","Dec 13, 2014"

Aroma is pleasant aromatic, mostly vanilla, with some definite pumpkin pie notes. Taste is very smooth, malty and easy drinking. There is not much pumpkin or spice, but a subtle complex mixture of all of the above. Not as intense as the Neshaminy Creek imperial pumpkin "Punkless Dunkel", but nevertheless quite good and VERY sessionable. This delicious brew will please the palates of all but the most experienced beer drinkers who have destroyed their palates with over-the-top insanely intense brews.","wattoclone","Oct 07, 2014"

The aroma offers a yeasty allspice and nutmeg medley with hints of orange and clove. Nice. The flavor comes on pretty strong with grassy grain pumpkin and more allspice. Unfortunately my one gripe with this beer is that alcohol is more evident in the flavor than I'd like. I appreciate that it's an imperial (a misnomer outside the Russian stout family) and many of my favorite brews are high alcohol, but alcohol in itself should not be a "flavor". It doesn't ruin this beer for me but it does make this a bit disappointing. Like the aroma I pick up some clove and citrus notes, as well as brown bread malt and caramel. The body is medium at best and with a peppery carbonation there's a slightly creamy but tingly feel. Good for a bit of fall pleasure but short of expectations.","Durge","Nov 21, 2013"

Poured a dark red-orange with a one and a half finger off-white head that subsided to half a finger slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of pumpkin, spices, cinnamon, ginger, alcohol, and subtle nutmeg. The flavor was of sweet malt, subtle alcohol, pumpkin, cinnamon, subtle nutmeg, and spices. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty decent brew. I have grown to like Pumpkin brews more and more, and this one is a good example of why. The pumpkin definitely dominated the flavor and aroma on this one. While doing so, it brought a nice collection of spices to the game. Very well balanced and tasty.

3.92,3.7,4,4.5,3.5,4,4,"This pumpkin ale pours out as a deep copper color with a yellowish tan head. The head fizzles away leaving behind just a fee clumps on top of the beer. The smell is spicy and sweet smelling. The flavor of the beer doesn't really scream imperial to me, I found that the flavor was pretty much like any other regular pumpkin ale. The spices kick in right from the get go and the pumpkin is subtle in the background. The mouthfeel is carbonated and has a bite to it. Not a bad brew.","Knapp85","Dec 21, 2010"
3.92,3.7,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"D: Despite being 9% ABV, Hipp-O-Lantern drinks far more smoothly than it should. There's still a bit of a let down in terms of authentic pumpkin and spice flavors, but its pretty malt-forward with a bit of hop and specialty malt bitterness. I had a couple with ease and probably will again next year.","Gambrinus1184","Dec 18, 2010"

3.83,1.3,4.5,4,3.5,4,4,"Drinkability -- Not bad. Almost an Old Ale-cum-Pumpkin Ale: rich and fruity malt flavor with gentle spicing and adequate pumpkin character. One of my personal favorites of the style. Honestly, my only quip is the alcohol presence, while not terribly offensive, it should be really toned down for the style.","yeahnatenelson","Oct 21, 2010"
3.95,4.5,4,4,4,3.5,4,"D - This was a nice surprise...I did not know River Horse had a pumpkin ale, so I grabbed this one...not as good as Weyerbacher's Imperial Pumpkin, but it's a nice imperial pumpkin ale","thain709","Oct 19, 2010"
3.4,-10.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,"D - It's not exactly a chore to drink but it's certainly much boozier than it needs to be. This one has too much alcohol and not enough of what really counts in a pumpkin beer; pumpkin and spice. There is some room to make this an awesome beer though.","BeerFMAndy","Oct 08, 2010"
4.01,6.1,3,4.5,4,3.5,4,"One extra note: allow this beer to warm up to just above cellar temperature, as this will take the edge off the alcohol, and increase the depth of the smell and taste. Great job, River Horse!","EPseja","Oct 03, 2010"
3.89,2.9,3.5,4.5,4,4,3,"D - it's a decent tasting beer but the higher abv makes it a "one and done" beer.","JoeyBeerBelly","Oct 02, 2010"

4,5.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Taking a sip of Hopp-O-Lantern and it tastes great. It has an emphasize on spice, malt is also prevalent, and sweet, but not overboard. Mouthfeel is a proper balance for the style. Drinkability for an imperial pumpkin is surprisingly good. If you have access to this in your state, try it !","mltobin","Sep 29, 2010"
3.5,-7.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a mud puddle brown color with some amber highlights. Fairly small tight head that settles into a light ring. The aroma is primarily of pumpkin pie spices; nutmeg and allspice come to mind with a hint of brown sugar. A rather subdued aroma. The flavor has some noticable pumpkin flavor to it, with the nutmeg and allspice spices. Some solvent notes come through from the ABV, which hinders the nice pumpkin and spice flavors. Kind of a shame. The feel is moderate with fizzy carbonation which gives the beer a nice crisp feel. The ABV is noticable and leaves a little belly burn. A bit sticky in the end. I wanted to like this pumpkin ale but the high abv prevented that from happening. It is not bad, has some nice flavor, but there is just not a need to imperialize this style. Worth a try.","Gmann","Sep 28, 2010"
3.87,2.4,3.5,4,4,4,3.5,"D - I found this above average overall, I would be pleased to try this again. It was a fresh tasting bottle and spicing doesn't overwhelm the taste. The only thing prohibiting multiple tastes is the abv a good Imperial, but there are a few that rank higher IMO","Slatetank","Sep 22, 2010"
4.1,8.5,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Pours a slightly thickened light to medium orange with a nice off white head. A bit of lacing as it goes down. Nose is caramel, brown sugar, hints of cream, and plenty of pumpkin spices. Taste is the same with the more traditional, non-spice flavors taking the front seat. Well balanced. Mouthfeel is medium and a bit creamy. Drinkability gets a higher score as this really goes down well and is one of only a few pumpkins beers that I can actually drink twelve ounces of.","Thorpe429","Sep 16, 2010"

3.57,-5.6,4,4.5,3,3.5,3.5,"River Horse is only 20 minutes from my home so I always want to try their brews whenever I can and as a fan of a good pumpkin ale I had to give this fall seasonal from their Brewer's Reserve a shot. This is a really nice looking pumpkin, a rich dark-orange color with significant beige head. Elaborate lacing coated the glass but without much head retention. Some "pumpkin beers" seem to ignore actual pumpkin flavor all together but luckily River Horse kept it in the brew. This smells beautiful with a lot of allspice, cinnamon, pumpkin itself, and a little alcohol. The taste is much of the same but I couldn't actually taste the 9.00% ABV making it rather dangerous on a chilled autumn eve. Not much carbonation, the spicy flavor keeps your tongue occupied instead. The flavor wasn't as strong as it could have been which would be great for some folks but I really like my pumpkin beers to be fully flavored since I rarely enjoy more than one a night. Despite the higher ABV this is a pumpkin that someone could have a few of without being overwhelmed with spiciness. Not my favorite for the style but nothing particularly wrong with it either.","biggerboat88","Sep 12, 2010"
4.1,8.5,4,4,4.5,4,3.5,"Drinkability: this is a slow drinking beer but provides a sign that fall and football are starting. Definitely a well done beer, but alcohol will limit you to one per session.","Gavage","Sep 12, 2010"
4.01,6.1,4.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"The carbonation is low, and the beer coats the mouth which mitigates the thin mouthfeel a bit. The fact that it's 9% ABV really sneaks up on you, though. The ABV isn't on the bottle, so I can see drinking a few of these in a row and then getting surprised when my head gets funny. But this a very good beer. I was very pleasantly surprised. I can definitely see coming back to this one a few times throughout the fall.","CharlatanSin","Sep 10, 2010"
4.26,12.7,5,4,4.5,4,4,"Drinkability: Highly impressed by River Horse's offering, Hipp-O-Lantern shows what pumpkin beer properties should be all about, not overspiced and a medium malt backbone to keep it balanced. The highlight of this beer is the color, what a beautiful beer in the glass! The ABV is not too evident, but the added alcohol benefits this beer as it's not too thick where you wouldn't be able to grab another one. I've always been a fan of River Horse but they really put me over with this fall offering. Try it!","thespaceman","Sep 09, 2010"
