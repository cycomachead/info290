I personally would say this is your average seasonal pumpkin ale with more dry spice than actual true pumpkin flavor. Very seldom do you get a pumpkin ale that tastes like pumpkin and is not overpowered with dry cinnamon and nutmeg. Unfortunately, this beer falls into the dry spice category. Overall, feels ok and the balance is not THAT bad. Average beer","hophugger","Dec 10, 2014"

3.15,-9,3.5,3.5,3,3,3,"Overall I thought this was an Ok beer and I thought it was an average at best example of a Pumpkin Ale, it had most of the flavors and aromas that I look for in the style, but in the end the flavors that needed to stick out the most and be showcased didn't and that made for a bland and uninteresting Pumpkin Ale.  This beer didn't have the best drinkability, it was fairly smooth, watery, crisp, slightly prickly, not filling at all and the taste didn't do a good job at holding my attention, one is more than enough for me, I wouldn't want to drink another one.  What I like the most about this beer was the aroma, it seemed to be pretty true to style and it wasn't as light as some of the other aspects.  What I liked the least about this beer was the taste and mouthfeel, they were both just too light and they made me lose interest fast.  I wouldn't buy this beer again, it's easy to find a much better Pumpkin Ale and I wouldn't recommend it either since I think it's just not a great example of the style.  All in all I wasn't impressed with this beer, it left me wanting more in just about every aspect and it just wasn't memorable.  So far this is my least favorite beer from Brooklyn Brewery and it's on the lower end of the spectrum as far as Pumpkin Ales go.  I appreciate the effort and that you guys didn't go crazy with the spices, but in the end this beer just wasn't for me, better luck next time guys.","StoutHunter","Sep 24, 2014"

A steady stream of small, fast rising bubbles was visible, and pouring produced about 1""" of off-white head, which settled down after four minutes to a thin, foamy cap that left some modest lacing down the glass. Its aroma was of pumpkin pie spices and hops, with the pumpkin spices being a little understated for me. The beer's flavour was of sweet malts with a hint of brown sugar up front, transitioning to the pumpkin pie spices, and finishing with a mild hop bitterness that lingered for a few seconds after swallowing the beer. Again, I found the pie spices to be too subtle for my taste. PRPA had a medium carbonation that suited it well, and I would describe it as light to medium bodied. Overall, this is a decent pumpkin beer, but simply not in the same class as say, Southern Tier's Pumking Ale. PRPA sells for $2.45 per 355 ml bottle, and is reasonably priced.The beer is available from August through November.","BuckyBeerBeaver","Apr 13, 2014"

Nose seemed to rely more heavily on nutmeg and vanilla than cinnamon, although that was also evident. Sticky lacing began to form as the head fell while I typed, so all was in readiness for the first sip. Mouthfeel was on the thin side, although not outright watery. The taste was a bit more muted than I remember in this one, slightly spicy, but not enough to peg the meter in either direction. I did get a pleasant wash of biscuit malt on the finish, though, which gave it a kind of cinnamon toast-like aspect. Overall, it did not live up to my memory, but I have had far worse, especially this year.","woodychandler","Nov 28, 2013"

In my opinion, if a beer boats """Pumpkin""" on the label, it should taste like pumpkin. It was a stretch to get any pumpkin flavor from this one. The beer itself is not of a bad flavor, the review is based on the fact that this is a Pumpkin beer and there was very little Pumpkin flavor present (if any). There are some nice notes of spice and a light balance of some sweetness and fall flavor, but overall this is coming in far short of a good Pumpkin beer.","Brouwerij78","Oct 03, 2013"

Subtlety goes out the window as brewers try to make their offerings memorable by shoving various blends of pumpkin spice in the consumer's face. Brooklyn's 'less is more' take on the style is a refreshing change of pace. Brooklyn beers often take a culinary sort of approach, and that's just what Post Road does. Like a good chef, the architects of this beer seem to realize that when quality ingredients are used, these should be the main focus of the dish (or in this case the beer). The dish (or beer) should be allowed to speak for itself, and any spicing or accoutrements should be used sparingly and only to enhance the desirable qualities that already exist. The specialty malts and real pumpkin used in Post Road are the main focus, and as a result the consumer is rewarded with a very drinkable and authentic tasting pumpkin beer. Put down that lifeless glass of pumpkin spice that you're probably holding right now and give this one a shot.","ryan1788a5","Sep 28, 2013"

The flavors are fresh but simple, and hops are minimal, with the malt providing the canvas for this brew. Mouthfeel is on the thin side but not too thin, and the carbonation is medium-low. This beer goes down very easy, and the pumpkin flavor tastes natural and is in check. Overall, this is not an overpowering or bold beer, but everything works pretty well. I'd certainly drink it again.","DeFaz","Aug 09, 2013"

Thankfully, it was not a spice bomb so this ended up falling somewhere in the middle when it came to beers of this style. While not the best out there, this was easily enjoyable and shouldn't offend much of anyone looking to try out a Fall seasonal beer when the quench arises.","JerzDevl2000","Feb 10, 2013"

Unless you've tried all the other ones, I wouldn't put this at the top of your list and wouldn't buy it again.

I also pick up some of those pumpkin pie spices (cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg, and clove). The taste revealed something missing in the aroma: hops. Those citrusy and herbal hop notes hit the mouth on the first sip to lead the palate into this pumpkin ale. I got those bready malts with those pumpkin pie spices. I get some of the pumpkin too. There's some mild sweetness in the flavor that is balanced well by the spices and some of the hop bitterness. The body is light to medium with moderate carbonation.

This beer tastes and feels much more like a lager than an ale and while it offers a big nose, the flavor seems lacking even if it is off the pumpkin ale beaten path.

Sweet, rich pumpkin backbones with a dose of the cinnamon spicing that keep everything light and balanced. The aftertaste has a more complete, pumpkin bread flavor to it.

However, thatâ€™s how fruit beers are supposed to be. The fruit is supposed to add to the aroma and flavor of the base beer, not replace the base beer.

Some very nice aromas here, probably the most pumpkin forward aromas I have ever had in a beer. Taste of pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, bread, and allspice. No bitterness noticed, but there are some lingering notes of pumpkin, bread, allspice, and cinnamon on the finish. Taste is a bit on the watery side, but overall really solid and enjoyable. Medium carbonation and body; with a bit of a creamy mouthfeel that goes down very smoothly. Nice balance of flavors. No alcohol noticed in the taste or finish as expected.

I get notes of vanilla and caramel as well as light earthy hops. Pumpkin flows throughout. Taste brings a bigger spiciness as well as pie flavors but just enough. Big malt body counters with a full flavored ale backbone. A mineral edge combines with the hops to give an English style finish that leaves a good clean pumpkin and cloved nutmeg hoppiness. Nice.

The beer has a satisfying aroma and smells like pumpkin pie, cinnamon, and nutmeg. I poured it into a glass and appeared to be spot on for a pumpkin ale - orangish brown/light red with minimal head. The carbonation was moderate to below moderate. Upon tasting this beer, it was pleasant upfront with the cinnamon and other spices hitting you. Also, the pumpkin taste isn't as pleasant as other beers, as it is more bitter and """earthy""" as the other BA reviews suggest. I feel like something isn't being done with this beer to balance out this bitterness and it was too off-putting for me. The whole after taste made it very difficult for me to attempt another sip. I even tried to pass some bottles off to friends that also enjoy craft beer and they complained the bitterness made the beer unappealing.

Not very bold, I get a light malty backbone like straw, not a ton of pumpkin. Halfway through the beer I find the lack of flavors and a slight syrupy sweetness off-putting. Goes down smooth, some fine, vigorous carbonation off the back of the mouth. Overall this beer isn't for me, the flavors balance OK but it simply isn't assertive enough for me.

People looking for a beer that tastes like the dollop of cream on top of a pumpkin pie would not love this because the earthy pumpkin is more at work in this beverage.

It was a pleasant surprise, as I was bracing for the nutmeg kick most of these ales have. Creamy mouthfeel with a smooth finish. This is very easy to drink, almost too easy, bordering on being watery. As others have stated, this beer is a lot nicer when it's allowed to warm up a bit.

Pumpkin taste lingers behind. Mouthfeel was fairly carbonated up front but mellowed out rather quickly. Carbonation worked well with the medium body and slight creaminess.

Mouthfeel was a little under medium, and the drinkability is pretty high, as well.

Distinct smell, I thought, of a ginger ale with feint whiffs of orange or other fruit zest. Taste bitter with marmalade predominant and flashes of sour fruit.

Overall the spices do come out front but they aren't cloying and the beer itself isn't overly sweet, two big pluses. This is still a beer not an over spiced attempt at liquid pie. A bit of malt is detectable as well as some spicy hoppiness that brings everything together. The mouthfeel is pretty good the spiciness does tend to linger and get a little annoying after a while but that's true of most beers with spice. And as far is drinkability is concerned, this is a pumpkin beer which by definition is a style where you drink one and then you're done or move onto something else. One goes done well enough, actually much easier than many other examples of the style but its' not a session beer in my opinion.

Nice full pumpkin aroma with spicy hints of clove and cinnamon. Golden dark copper color with a huge creamy head that ultimately settles and leaves some decent lacing. Mouthfeel is good and crisp, wish it were a bit thicker and creamier though. Flavor has a nice balance, the pumpkin is easily detected but not overdone. Good spiciness of clove, nutmeg, and cinnamon. The aftertaste lingers for a while giving a nice sweet finish. Out of the ordinary and well done I'm sure there are better out there but this one still hits the mark.","kinger","Aug 12, 2008"

Pumpkin hit my nose first, natch, then some grassy hops and spices like pepper. Also picked up some yeast/sugar in there because I picked up faint traces of bubblegum. Cinnamon and bread malt come through in the taste, but it is more hoppy/bitter than smooth. Still, a medium body with the hops giving off light citric twinges. Caramel and maybe roasted malt mixed in too. Ultimately, just a little too much carbonation for my liking, as the beer was too sharp to be completely quaffable.

Well carbonated and generally a good feel, on the fizzy side as others have mentioned. Pretty refreshing, goes down easy but the bitterness and pumpkin flavor may not invite over indulgence here. It definitely puts a little bite on your tongue along the line of a grainy hop. I think it is both different and likeable but I would not be inclined to have more than one of these at a time I think. It's not stupendous, even as a pumpkin ale, but I must admit that I've only had one pumpkin ale that I really liked a lot.

Most of the pumpkin ales I've had this year have either been overspiced or underspiced, and it was nice to have a balanced one for a change. The feel was fizzy and creamy.

The aftertaste is drying, with cinnamon, allspice and ginger slowly emerging bringing a about a faint woody hop flavor and bitterness. I like a more residual sweet and toasty malt profile in my pumpkin beers; but this leans heavily towards crisp and dry. The body is a thinnish-medium with a mid to high carbonation that further lightens the mouthfeel. Finish shows mellow pumpkin pie spices and faintly perceivable pumpkin flesh and pale malt. This is a softer and more approachable Pumpkin ale than average and may seem unbalanced to someone looking for a malty ale with lots of pumpkin character.

Initially wonderful pumpkin pie flavors and malty caramel notes, but the flavors quickly weaken under the timid body and fall apart; leaving behind a hop bittering and a grainy bitey-ness.

Begins with pumpkin but ends with what seems to be some kind of rot. Not an awful rot, but just a bit, like when the pumpkin starts to go soft a few days after halloween.

The one pumpkin ale Iâ€™ve had that I liked was made for Rodneyâ€™s Oyster House in Toronto, and was thick and rich like a porter. Itâ€™s silky texture and slight sweetness even made it seem like pumpkin pie. This on the other hand was more like a Post Road Pale Ale with an infusion of some spices. I canâ€™t give this my recommendation.","Dantes","Sep 30, 2003"

Aroma: Wow, when I popped the top the pumpkin pie like tone just engulfed my senses very intriguing cinnamon and other spices blend perfectly with the malts used here somewhat of a nut quality comes by my senses as well, but it's safe to call it pumpkin pie. Flavor: A solid base of caramel malt blended with silky cream and spiced pumpkin weird and different but very quaffable. Mouthfeel is a bit on the light side for body but texture is silky smooth. Drinkability: I can honestly say one of these is probably enough not something to imbibe in quantity but to really enjoy and treat as a dessert or somewhat of a novelty not bad just not a creation meant to be drank frequently possibly a once a year beer here.","WVbeergeek","Sep 17, 2003"

It finished nicely bitter from the hops which helped cut down of the noticable sweetness. The only downside to this was after my senses became used to the pumpkin, the beer started smelling like warm milk. I'm glad to see that the pumpkin was not overdone in this one. Nice medium body and appropriate carbonation, I would say overall I really enjoyed this expereince.","yen157","Oct 03, 2002"

The flavor is obviously spicy, but reveals some soft fruity maltiness as well. The bitterness is appropriately light, allowing the spice to counteract the sweetness of the malt. Very well balanced. The finish is fairly short, with a lingering spiciness. Throughout the glass, however, the spice tends to build on the palate. Still, a very nice beer with alot of finesse.

Low carbonation; mouthfeel is quite slick and creamy. The pumpkin spices are also the dominant feature of the taste; what's nice is that you get the essence of pumpkin pie without the sweetness (I don't find this a particularly malty beer). A crisp hop bitterness follows the spiciness, and the spices return going into a relatively short finish. A fall seasonal that would also be a nice treat on a winter's night.
