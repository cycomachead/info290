"Great spice aroma and taste.  Good pumpkin flavor."
""
""
""
"O- one of the best pumpkin beers on the market.  The original imperial pumpkin ale certainly set the bar high"
"Above average to good pumpkin beer that hits all the traditional notes.  Full of cinnamon, clove, and bread, with a small hoppy backbone.  Definitely worth a try."
""
""
""
""
"Appearance hold an amber orange color supporting a thin moderate head leaving fair lace.  Smell has that nice aroma of pumpkin and accompanying spice,  Taste does not disappoint, having that night owl flavor, but more expressive.  Mouthfeel is medium with with good carbonation.  Overall a good pumpkin and spice flavor with a hint of alcohol."

"22oz bomber: This one poured a cloudy, darker golden color. There was a small off white head which didn’t leave much lacing. The nose is good. Pumpkin plus some pumpkin pie spices. The spices are not overdone. The taste is good. It is a bit sweet, but thankfully not sickly sweet as some others of these are. Good body, pumpkin as well as pumpkin pie spices. Not bad."

"If you are experimenting pumpkin beers, or if you believe this year is the year that you will make a breakthrough with them, let me advise you not to reach for this one. Perhaps more for the experienced pumpkin beer drinker."

"In the end, more of a spicy dessert brew towards Pumking."
"A good pumpkin ale, certainly in the upper echelon, but I wish it did a bit more to distinguish itself from others in the same style."
""
"Deep golden with a slight haze and minimal head. Aroma is spices from a cookie or pumpkin pie. Flavor follows with those spices in the lead but not overdone. They're joined by pumpkin and malts.  But there seems to be a slight off flavor to me.  Maybe it just the pumpkin but whatever it is doesn't quite fit.  A good beer but not one I'd need another of."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I have to say that this really was a good beer to definitely have again. I am thinking about picking another one of these up for Thanksgiving."
""
"D:  Not very drinkable for me. And highly disappointed based on the nose as well as the other great experiences I've had with Elysian including Punkuccino, Dragonstooth, and the almighty Dayglow IPA. If you don't like over top pumpkin flavor this could be the beer for you, but I feel it really has some off putting qualities to the flavor."

"This beer is heavy on the spice but the sweetness balances it out well. It has a great, strong aroma and is enjoyable despite the strong spices. Pumpkin finishes out the beer in a fuzzy and distractingly tacky feel. Alcohol is very gently warming."
""
"Not a huge fan of the style, but regardless, this was one of the better versions I've had in some time."

"The beer appears a radiant orange hue with a small head that rapidly fades to nil. The aroma offers cinnamon, pumpkin pie, brown sugar. Sweet and definitely true to style. Lots of brown sugar and cinnamon character. Thin body with low carbonation. Alcohol content well hidden. A tasty beer, though a little goes a long way. A good beer to share a few ways."

"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, 2013 bottling. Pours lightly hazy golden orange color with a 1-2 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of huge pumpkin flesh, pumpkin seed, cinnamon, gingerbread, nutmeg, toast, caramel, brown sugar, clove, allspice, pie crust, herbal, and toasted earthiness. Absolutely insane aromas with incredible complexity and balance of pumpkin, malt, and spice notes; with great strength. Taste of big pumpkin flesh, pumpkin seed, cinnamon, gingerbread, nutmeg, clove, allspice, toast, caramel, brown sugar, pie crust, herbal, and toasted earthiness. Lingering notes of pumpkin, pumpkin seed, cinnamon, gingerbread, pie crust, nutmeg, clove, allspice, caramel, brown sugar, herbal, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of pumpkin, malt, and spice flavors; with big authentic pumpkin presence and fantastic malt/spice balance; and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a smooth and lightly slick/syrupy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an absolutely insane imperial pumpkin ale. All around amazing complexity, robustness, and balance of malt/pumpkin/spice flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A world class pumpkin ale for sure."

"Great pumpkin. Well balanced mild spices. Nice aroma and taste. Nice pumpkin flavor. Definitely one of the top 10 pumpkin beers. Smooth rich flavor. Not watery like many of the pumpkins out there. Too bad beers like this are available for such a short period."

"A quality pumpkin ale that delivers what one would expect from the style."

"O-What a great smelling beer. The scent is really the highlight here, but the rest of the beer isn't bad. If you like your pumpkin beer on the dryer side, this brew is a good choice because it still provides some spice and pumpkin flesh without getting vegetal or overly earthy. I could use a bit more heft in the feel, but this is not quaffable by any means. Wow, what a great smelling beer."
""
""
""
"I really enjoyed this beer. I would put in my top three pumpkin brews so far. Good Gourd, Pumpking and Great Pumpkin."
""
""
""
""
"Overall one of the better pumpkin """beers""" that there are. This one actually tastes like beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- This is pretty much one of the highest rated pumpkin ales but it's not my piece of pie. I can drink it fine. There's nothing wrong with it but 22 ounces is too much for me. Definitely worth a try but I won't be buying it again."

"Overall – This is a very nice and tasty imperial pumpkin ale. A little on the drier side and more roasted pumpkin in nature with a nice blend of flavors and a great feel overall."
""
"I was dubious about pumpkin beer, with several misfires extending back a few years. I even thought that I might not even like pumpkin beer, even though I LOVE pumpkin pie. This beer really does taste like pumpkin pie. The price was moderately steep, but not outrageous, at 4.99 for a bomber, bought at the Albertsons in Livingston, Montana. Bravo to the brewmeisters!"
""
""
""
"Pretty good pumpkin ale, nice flavor and body, easy to like if you like pumpkin ales and well worth trying."
""
""
"Overall this beer is quite nice and a nice representation of what I believe a pumpkin beer should be like. I'd give it. 3.75-4."
""
""
""
"This beer lives up to it's name - this really is a great pumpkin ale. Poured from a 22oz into a goblet, hazy orange, with a thin white head. Kind of remeniscent of my childhood Orange Crush vice, just a little more rustic looking. Smells delicious, cinnamon, nutmeg, gingerbread, cola, cherry, and pumpkin. No alcohol on the nose at all. Pumpkin flavor is heavier in the taste, but I think the flavor is really well balanced overall, just a nice mosaic of spices and fruit. Sweet, bitter on the back end, and nice mouthfeel. Carbonation is perfectly appropriate for an 8% abv, and the mouthfeel is slick and not as heavy as you might think. Best imperial pumpkin I've ever had."
""
"It seems pretty light as far as ABV, but coats the mouth very nicely. The taste lingers on the palate a while, adding that slight pinch of aforementioned bitterness. As with Elysian's other pumpkin ales, I would highly recommend this one for the fall season."
"O-nice pumpkin ale with good pumkin flavor and a nice spice balance, a little hot though"
""

""
"Overall: this is a good beer, but as I said it's a little bit overwhelming for me. I like my pumpkin beers a little bit more on the subtle side. Decent, but hardly a session drink."
""
""
"Great beer. I love pumpkins. This bad boy is up there with the champions."
""
"Overall: The Great Pumpkin is a good pumpkin ale, but it cannot stand up to the likes of Pumpking. That said, I have heard that previous vintages of The Great Pumpkin have been better than the 2012, so I might have to revisit it again in the future."
""
"Mouthfeel is on lighter side of style with moderate carbonation. Overall a pretty good beer and unique in the style. I liked the low spice and that the real pumpkin and squash flavors seemed to come out more in it."
"Overall this is a great Imperial Pumpkin ale that trumps out even the legendary Pumking. Heck I think it's even better than """smashed pumpkin""" which some craft lovers raved about. I may have to grab another before they are gone."
""
"All in all a pretty solid pumpkin beer and much better than some atrocities I've had."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- The smell was to die for. The taste failed me in what was going to become my favorite pumpkin beer."
""
"I like this one, so you know it must be good, since I typically can't stand pumpkin beers."
""
""
"O: this was my second favorite from the elysian pumpkin series box and was a soild pumpkin beer."
""
"Impressive balance in this big brew. Nice showing from the pumpkin, but there's perhaps a bit too much spice. Their pumpkin stout, Dark of the Moon, is better."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: a very good but thinner bodied imperial pumpkin ale. Easy to quaff. Definitely worth trying this one."
""
""
"A big pumpkin beer. Huge spices, but enough malt and real pumpkin to balance it. Hits every flavor a pumpkin beer could have and remains drinkable. Not as solid as Night Owl, but for an imperial take, it's damn good."
"This is a tasty pumpkin ale. It's nicely balanced, and not extreme in any way. This is both a positive and a negative. Some pumpkin ales try way too hard. While this doesn't, it also isn't particularly mind-blowing."
""
"Overall: Another really good pumpkin beer from Elysian."
"Overall, it's good. Pumpkin beers are hit and miss with me but somehow this one tows the line. Thanks for bringin this guy 4DAloveofSTOUT."
"Overall: Really enjoyed this beer and was so excited to grab one of the last bottles of the season from my local spot. Upon first sip, this beer kept the pumpkin flavor true and went down pretty smooth, with the alcohol hint on the aftertaste. Only bad thing is I can't enjoy this again unless I run back right now...which I may do. Totally recommended. Cheers!"

"22oz brown bomber pours a light orange/gold color with a thin white cap that leaves a modest amount of lacing on the glass. Looks nicely carbonated. Aroma is spiced pumpkin pie -- nutmeg, vanilla, and some cinnamon. Taste closely mirrors the nose. Flavors are all very complimentary of each other and in good balance. Nice fresh pumpkin taste that is at just the right intensity. Augmented by the aforementioned nutmeg, vanilla, and cinnamon flavors. Think pumpkin pie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. The 8% abv is hardly noticeable in the taste. Mouthfeel is smooth and silky with just the right amount of carbonation to keep things from tasting too syrupy. Overall one of the much more successful pumpkin brews out there. Good festive flavor for this time of year."
"cheers LampertLand"
""
"D - A very nice Pumpkin Ale... Upper echelon without a doubt, but not as epic as I was hoping for - still falls slightly short of my favorites int he category... However, I will gladly indulge each and every fall and recommend you do the same..."
""
""
""
"Overall: Just a really refreshing pumpkin beer. The spices are not overwhelming or unbalanced, which can be the downfall of many pumpkin beers. Tastes like a desert somehow without being cloying sweet in the least."
""
""
""
""
"O- A very tasty pumpkin beer. Flavors come together very well. Will pick this up again."
""
""
"O: If you're truly looking for pumpkin pie, head toward the Schlafly corner. However, if you want to try a truly uniquie vegetable beer, seek this one out!"
"A tasty pumpkin beer. Its sweet but not overly like the other imperial pumpkins that are out there. Good spice profile but the malt lacks some depth."
""
""
""
"Poured from a 22 oz bottle to 16oz chalice. Appears a hazy Orange with little head. It has a really awesome nose that makes me think this what a pumpkin beer is supposed to smell like. Almost as good as a fresh pumpkin pie! Is really good but missing something that seperates great pumpkin beers. Alcohol presence lingers that 1 is enough! Mouthfeel is easy going besides alcohol detection, medium carb. If was looking for imo. Pumpkin and was only option would suffice. Other out there are better but has a good example of style."
""
""
"a great great beer, unique in the pumpkin ale world. it pours a shining orange to new copper color, with a skinny white head that fades fast. the nose is spicy, but not cinnamon, more clove or even ginger or something. there also plenty of vanilla sweetness and of course pumpkin. the flavor is different, its made with pumpkin seeds, and you can definitely taste the nutty earthy almost salty vibe they bring to the table. vanilla sugar and spice is also present, and so is the alcohol. there is a medium body, a little heavy because of the light carbonation, and a lot of alcohol warmth. this is a great beer, i feel like the pumpkin lends itself better to imperial ales, rather than smaller brews. it just provides such a big base. its a huge canvas on which to paint, and this elysian beer creates a clever work."
""
"This is how I like my pumpkin ales. Good for one or two but way over the top with sweetness and spice. Give it a shot."
"O- Wow. One of my new favorite pumpkin beers. Has the sweet/spicy/gourd ratio down to a science while also having a nice kick, yet is still smooth."
""
""
"O: I really like pumpkin ales a lot... the style is one I look forward to and seek out every year. The Elysian beers (they make several others) are always among my favorites - this is no exception. Just a touch sweeter (AT TIMES) than I like for a pumpkin beer - then a dirty bitterness would rein it back in. Terrific, overall, and definitely one I'll keep drinking and recommending."
""
""
"For a hyped-up pumpkin ale, I found this a bit lack-luster. Poured a somewhat cloudy copper-orange color with a small white head that receded to a ringlet. Aroma was pretty soft and mellow, with light notes of pumpkin and a bit of cinnamony spice. Taste was similarly mellow, not an in-your-face blast of pumpkin pie, but everything you'd expect is still there: pumpkin flesh, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, sweet bready malts. Medium body, and quite easily drinkable. Overall not bad; about on the same level as DFH's Punkin Ale."
""
""
"Mouthfeel is slightly heavy, and surprisingly fizzy for something that looked like it had no head. Overall, I'm somewhat underwhelmed. It's not bad, but it's not magic."
"Full bodied with a zesty spice presence up front that lingers over the pumpkin and sweet malt notes into a slightly dry finish. Strong clove, cinnamon, brown sugar and allspice notes followed by pumpkin puree, caramel malt, vanilla and nutmeg. Very dessert like and lacking the earthy vegetal quality that makes so many pumpkin beers so unappealing. Still, the strong autumnal spices and sweet malts make it feel like a beer. The high ABV is excellently masked without a trace of alcohol, making this complex beer extremely quaffable. One of the better pumpkin beers I've had. Up there with Pumpking and older batches of Southampton Pumpkin."
""
"This is definitely one of the better Pumpkin Ales that I’ve had. I’m usually not as much of a fan of the Imperial style and I thought early on that the alcohol here was going to get this one in trouble but I was impressed how this pulled itself together once it sat for a while and the overall evenness of the flavors an d freshness of that pumpkin character really carries this through to the end. I was pleased to find that this one delivered."
""
""
""
"O: A fine pumpkin beer that is worthy of your money and, perhaps, your Thanksgiving table. Sweetness is balanced by alcohol and spice, and the aroma is excellent."
""
""
""
""
"For an imperial pumpkin pretty light bodied and really smooth. Sweet ginger bread some vanilla and cinnamon raisin bread. Big pumpkin semi spicy finish. Well blended concise and tasty. Is it really the original imperial pumpkin? Who knows but it is a pretty good one."
""
"Overall: As of right now, only Dogfish Head is in the same level as this (until I have my first try of the fabled Pumking on Halloween). Amazing beer, and a steal for the $7.99 price I bought it for."
"Overalls - I'm not a pumpkin/fruit beer lover, but I loved this beer; sweet as pumpkin pie but in a refined presentation; stomach-warming alcohol complement; great stuff"
""
""
"VERY GOOD, NOT MUST TRY!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Very easy drinking. Well hidden abv. I personally don't think this can stand up against better Imperial Pumpkin Ales such as Schlafly, Williamsburg AleWerks, ST Pumking or CC Good Gourd. A little too spice forward for my tastes."
""
""
""
""
"Overall a wonderfuly well crafted ale, it's all here and done real nicely. The pumking killer indeed. I don't like pumpkin beers, but I am really enjoying this one. I also like the fact that this doesn't come off that sweet in taste, but has all those nice sweet aromas."
""
"This is medium to full bodied. There is soft carbonation. This is a nice take on pumpkin beers that doesn't overly rely on spice but instead real pumpkin flavor. Not bad."
""
"O: I really enjoyed this beer because it seems to provide the perfect blend of pumpkin and spices without being overly sweet or tasting like pumpkin pie. No alcohol is present in the taste."
""
"Great pumpkin ale. Would love to try more from the Elysian lineup. 4.5"
""
"Pours a copper tinted burnt orange, moderate cap of off-white froth, some decent lacing. Scent strong on spice, caramel and alcohol, lots going on and took a bit before individual components could be isolated. Same with scent, strong spice and caramel up front. Spices slightly overpower as it becomes hard to isolate cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger etc. Heavy malting and high ABVs also mask much of the muted gourd flavor. Some floral hoppiness to it. Medium to full bodied. A touch too much going on here for me to enjoy it all."
""
""
"O: Extremely well balanced - not too sweet, not too much pumpkin, not too many spices, alcohol is well hidden... This is just a very good beer, the best I have had in the style. Enjoyable and easy to drink, a great beer to sip on."
""
""
""
"The beer pours a clear gourd colored orange with an elegant, creamy white head that laces. The beer's nose is modestly spiced with unexpectedly potent notes of sweet yam/pumpkin. The taste doesn't disappoint either with heavy pumpkin sweetness and subtle spices making it like liquid pumpkin pie. The alcohol is very well masked except for a slight burn on exhalation. The beer is very well balanced with the pumpkin and spice harmonizing on each sip followed by a slightly pine/mint/licorice bitterness. Very enjoyable beer and a worthy pumpkin beer indeed. Completely worth trying and I appreciate the bottles unknown person I received them from!"
"M: A bit sweet and thick, suitable for the style but not my preference. One bottle is enough."
"Flavorful if somewhat unbalanced (bitterness and boozy tastes a bit too sharp for my tastes for this style of beer), yet I certainly like this brew. Better than the sum of its parts..."
""
"Overall: This is a very smooth and full flavor pumpkin ale. Great fall beer, I'd definitely have more."

"I discovered The Pumpkin King in Elysian's Pumpkin Patch four-pack. The Pumpkin King pours a slightly cloudy copper gold, one might even call it pumpkin orange. Like a lot of pumpkin ales that I've tried, it pours with very little head, so pour vigorously if you prefer some foam. The smell is strong pumpkin, pumpkin spices, and hops... exactly what I want a pumpkin beer to smell like. The flavor is surprisingly light on the spices, hidden behind the malts and hops, though they are still there in the form of background notes which I think adds to the perception of complexity in the flavor. The Great Pumpkin is definitely more nuanced than other """beat you over a head with one spice or another""" pumpkin ales that are a lot of fun to drink but not what I would describe as particularly delicious. At 8% ABV there is a distinct medicinal taste on the back end, although this is not unexpected and therefore not concerning, to me at least. Of course what defines a pumpkin ale is the actual pumpkin itself, and I'm happy to say that the pumpkin flavor is front and center. It helped to rest my pallet for a few minutes before dipping in for a few more sips so that I could experience the full pumpkin flavor over and over. Unlike a lot of pumpkin beers that I've tried, the pumpkin flavor was fresh and not too vegetablely. I think that the additional hops in the imperial style compliments the pumpkin flavor greatly, not only to mask some of the strong spice notes, but the floral and citrus flavors from the hops genuinely compliment the pumpkin. Imperial is the way to go for pumpkin ales, in my opinion. I highly recommend this beer as it is #1 on my list of pumpkin ales, for now at least."
"Came to the table in a goblet a deep pumpkin orange color with athinner white head atop.Aromas of cardamom and warming cinnamon,there is a decent shot sweet alcohol as well,a little toast s well.More pumpkin on the palate than the aromas with a bit of cooked pumpkin and pie spice,it's warming and the alcohol is pretty big.This a really good warming pumpkin ale,not overly sweet with some real pumpkin flavors."
""
"Overall: While I haven't had the opportunity to get my hands on Schlafly's Pumpkin in a couple of years, but I am willing to say Great Pumpkin is on its level."
"O- I fear I am a victim of """the BA Rating""". Had I never heard of this beer at all, is say it was average or a little above average. I stand by that conviction. Worth trying.. Don't break your back to get it."
""
""
""
"Lighter in apperance then I would have expected. Initially has a nice cap of foam but it fades and had no retention. Kind of a orange clover honey color with good clarity. Lovely subdued aroma of pie spices such as nutmeg and cinnamon as well as toasted squash. Nutty. Not artificial smelling which is nice. The flavor is very balanced, spicy with cardamom, cinnamon and nutmeg. There is also a real squash note. Some bitterness and a good backbone. Medium bodied, low carbonation, lingering bitter note. Not my favorite pumpkin ale, but a very, very good one."
"O- A solid pumpkin beer, definitely worth a try for pumpkin beer lovers, although it's probably not my favorite within the style."
""
" The flavor has a mild cinnamon taste which increases with some light bready malt and hint of spicy ginger with an earthy nutty toasted taste which suits the style, the middle gets spicier with some mild vanilla and sweet gentle cotton candy-like malt sweetness with a taste of alcohol which adds to the bite the cinnamon and clove elements provide. Overall a pretty tasty pumpkin in the Imperial realm, very drinkable if a little hot - not an every drinking pumpkin, but a good candidate for sharing and enjoyable Thanks a lot Adam!"
""
""
"O: As with earlier in this review, the nutmeg is overdone with a nice warming cinnamon presence. The body is great, the carbonation is at a good level. I prefer Night Owl as it is a little more subtle on spices."
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with good flavors and aromas."
""
"Overall I thought this was a great pumpkin ale. The nose is amazing; a ton of cinnamon, nutmeg and pumpkin. The taste is a light heavier on the spice, but the hefty malt bill helps to balance it out and offers plenty of complementary pempkin and caramel/brown sugar maltiness. Definitely one of the best I have ever had, maybe third only behind Weyerbacher Pumpkin and Midnight Sun TREAT."
"This is a great execution of a pumpkin ale. It's a totally different style, but I'm enjoying it almost as much as I remember enjoying Night Owl (note: must try these two side by side), and much more than Dark O' The Moon."
"Overall this is a different sort of imperial pumpkin beer than most out there. It is not as sweet as most other imperials out there which makes it more interesting. I am a fan."
""
"Overall, even though pumpkin beers haven't really been my thing, this is probably the best one I've had."
""
"I bought this because of all the hubbub I heard heard and even though I am not a huge pumpkin fan I figured I might as well. Orange color, two finger thick head, fluffy. Smells very spicy, nutmeg cinnamon, the usual suspects, not bad. the flavor was more of the same but for a split second I thought I was chewing a piece of cinnamon gum like Big Red or something. This was much better than Night Owl and honestly this probably was the best pumpkin beer I've had to date. Sadly though I must still say it was not worth the $9 price tag."
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. I gotta tip my hat to the folks at Elysian for making the most raw pumpkin flavored beer I have ever experienced. That is to be commended. Also, the spiced inclusion is enough to let you know it is there and then some. However, it does not cross over into the territory of being ridiculous and too much. For an 8% brew, it sure is imperial and the alcohol is not hiding. Is it a good pumpkin beer? Yeah, it certainly is among the best bottled varieties. Is it THE best? No, Selinsgrove destroys this in overall blended flavor, drinkability and enjoyment. If you want to taste raw pumpkin with a boost of alcohol, this is the beer to go for. I have no reservation about my purchase, I am glad I finally got to try it. I look forward to having it again closer to the holidays."
""
"Poured out of 22 oz bottle. Dark orange pour with white head, aroma has notes of big pumpkin spice, some caramel, toffee, lots of cinnamon, touch of nutmeg & some vegetal pumpkin. Taste is an equal mix of sweet squashy pumpkin flesh & some slight cinnamon, ginger, finishing fairly sweet, alittle (brown) spicy. Not a fan of the style as a whole, but this one is done pretty well. Would def buy again."

"O: Solid pumpkin ale. Not the best I've had, but it's up there."
"Overall, very enjoyable as it has been every year I have sampled it. I guess Elysian knows pumpkin! What really separates this brew from others in the style is how natural it tastes, almost to the point where you can literally taste the pumpkin seeds in the brew. Nothing artificial tasting about it, just a well crafted base beer with accompanying deep pumpkin flavors and spices."
"I found this a lighter body than I expected. Bitter, less sweet than expected, with a vegetal presence through the sip. Both wife and I were saying the smell really wowed us and the taste was a slight let down and the mouthfeel was deceptive. Definitely getting some pumpkin seed on the finish, but there is just a little lacking there in the middle to transition from the intense aroma into the actual beer."
""
"One of the best pumpkin beers I've tried -- really nice."

"Review from 9/2010 notes. Poured into a Nostradamus flute glass. Pours a medium orange amber with a slight off-white head, but light lacing. Pumpkin and malt aroma. Pumpkin, pumpkin pie spices, light fruit and malt in a nice combination. Complex and well integrated. Slightly bitter hop/pumpkin finish, probably from the pumpkin seeds. Medium bodied with some creaminess Excellent and one of my favorite pumpkin ales."
""
"o - Overall I thought this was a great pumpkin ale. The nose is amazing; a ton of cinnamon, nutmeg, and pumpkin. The taste is a light heavier on the spice, but a great pumpkin beer none the less and hope I can get it around Thanksgiving."
"Overall pure excellence."
"The beer pours a hazy orange color with a white head. The aroma is fairly straight forward and features pumpkin and cinnamon, as expected. The flavor is a little more complex. I get the pumpkin, as well as the spices typically associated with pumpkin beers: cinnamon, allspice and nutmeg. The beer is also quite boozy. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
""
"Overall, this was the best pumpkin beer I have ever had. I normally am not a fan of the style, but this was was awesome and I could drink a lot of it."
"D - Elysian knows how to make pumpkin beers. I enjoyed this nearly as much as I did Dark O' The Moon. I appreciate that they don't feel the need to obliterate all the other flavors with spices. Would happily have this again, even out of season."
"O - Quite possibly the best pumpkin beer I've ever had. This is right up there with Schlafly Pumpkin, MS TREAT, and the like. We easily polished off this bomber, and I could have gone for me. Great stuff."
""
"Overall, this is the best pumpkin beer I've ever had. Hands down."
"Enjoyed on draft out of a standard glass pint. The Great Pumpkin pours a hazy orange and gold color. Serious pumpkin pie smell - like you're just finished Thanksgiving dinner and you're diving into a fresh slice of homemade pie. Taste is similar - like mom's pumpkin pie with plenty of whipped cream. A smooth and delicious brew that drinks like dessert despite the high alcohol content. Mouthfeel is sleek with a bit of liquor on the finish if you swish it, smoother with a quick swig. One of the best pumpkin beers I've ever sampled and one I could go back to."

"overall: very high quality"
"O - Best pumpkin beer, hands down."
"O: Christ, this was awesome. This was the first bottle that was completely drained at a lineup of 20-odd pumpkin beers, and for good reason. If you like pumpkin pie, seek this out. I'm sorry to say that this bumped my previous favorite, Kern River Brewing Company's Pumpkin Ale, out of the top spot at the tasting. While KRBC's approach is very sessionable, this one bumps up the flavor to the point where a bomber split two ways is perfect."
"O: This is probably my favorite example of a pumpkin ale, and by far the best implementation of pumpkin in the brewing process I've tried to date. This is a world class beer and deserves gold for it's category at GABF and the World Beer Cup."
"Very nicely balanced, despite the high alcohol. Pretty viscous and rich without being heavy, highly concentrated. Medium body. Long finish. Really a great beer."
"The Great Pumpkin pours a deep copper color, with a ghostly white head. Intense pumpkin, sugar and spice on the nose, with a nice bready and malty backdrop to tame the spices. Overall one of the better pumpkin beers I have had, but it still does not stand up to Pumking, which until further notice is king of all pumpkin beers"
"Thanks Eric! Pours a copper peach with a fairly large head. Nose is rich pumpkin pie meat, nutmeg and cinnamon, pie crust. Awesome, rich, meaty. Mouth is slick and kind of dark, spices at the forefront, pumpkin pie meat really creeps out. Nothing bright or vibrant about this, but it's earthy, rich, and super enjoyable. I'm going to have to drop my score on Weyerbacher's which was the best I've had of the style before this."
"How come all the pumpkin beers with tremendous flavor and not a ton of residual sweetness have a weak aroma? Subtle caramel, vanilla, and spice on the nose, but put some of the beer in your mouth and the aroma kicks in hard. Tons of flavor. Reminds me of Schlafly but more roasty and with more caramel. A little smoother and a tad sweeter too, but not annoying sweet like Pumking. The pumpkin is tasted here for sure. Cinnamon, ginger, clove, allspice, vanilla, caramel. Full mouthfeel. A little alcohol tinge on the finish."
"Great great beer, wish it was one I could get more easily...If I put this against 2011 pumking, this would win...yet 2010 pumking was definitely better. I have made pumpkin beers before, and know it is definitely not easy to create and know what the outcome will be."
"O/D: I could put a bomber down, this is a mighty great pumpkin ale from Elysian, arguably the king."
"O: yeah, smells good, but tastes brutal for me. I like Elysian, and have previously enjoyed this beer, but wow, not impressed. Alcohol, sharp chemicals, bitter. This is not good."
"Overall this is a great fall beer that tastes like a pumpkin pie in a bottle without tasting artificial. I would drink this again in a heartbeat."
"- Solid pumpkin brew, and is more complex than some of the other big favorite pumpkin beers out there. Price is a bit steep, but that doesn't affect my judging of the fluid inside. Very solid, but a bit light for what I think an imperial should be. Nice complex, and balanced beer."
"O: Awesome. This definitely fights for Pumking for my favorite Pumpkin Ale so far. A must try... except that Seattle only got 30 cases supposedly."
"Now, all I want is the glass!"
"Overall: Aside from Midnight Sun's Oak Aged Imperial Chocolate Pumpkin Porter, this is the best pumpkin beer I've had. It's slightly better than Night Owl, which I opened next to it but I couldn't review because it didn't hold up. Night Owl, Great Pumpkin, and eventually world domination. Elysian is the master of this style."
"Overall: A perfectly balanced beer. Spices and pumpkin are prominent, but not overpowering. Somehow manages to not be cloying throughout the entire glass. 9"
"Majorly disappointing... Schlafly's offering wipes the floor with this..."
"Maybe you pretend it is the skull of your vanquished enemies. Either way, it has been spiced correctly, you drink to victory. It does finish a little sweet, the only drawback to an otherwise outstanding beer."
"While most pumpkin beers focus on spices and end up tasting like cinnamon or allspice dissolved in an unhopped ale, this beer tastes like pumpkin. A lot like pumpkin. There is some cinnamon in there but its not overpowering, restrained, this is actually a good beer overall. Shocking. I'd even drink this again."
"Pours a nice orange color with a bit of a white head. The aroma is fairly faint, but tends to focus on actual pumpkin flavors as opposed to an overload of spices. The taste confirms this, as there is some nice, sweet pumpkin and a bit of malt. Mild spicing in the background. Feel is nice and creamy with lower levels of carbonation. Drinks really well. I've been wanting to try this for awhile now; a solid pumpkin beer."
"Next review!"
"Overall this is thee best pumpkin beer out there hand down. As I drink more of this it is becoming a favorite of mine for sure. I just hope I can get this each year because it is on my list as a seasonal I must have."
"Drinkability is pretty good, your average pumpkin brew. The spices bring out the heat, even though it's not really that strong, at 7.8%."
"Overall, this is definitely one of the best pumpkin ales out there. If you are a fan of pumpkin beers this is an absolute must try. Don't be fooled by the relative mediocrity of night owl bottles (though its ok on tap). The Great Pumpkin is definitely where elysian's holiday spirit shines. Fantastic beer."
"This is, without a doubt, the best pumpkin beer I've tasted. Fantastic stuff."
"-not a great beer for me. i wish it would have tasted more like it smelled because the pumpkin didnt really come through much"
"Overall very solid indeed. Going by the nose one of the biggest seasonal I have yet to run across, just a wonderful example of the style that was very well received by all."
"Sample at Alan's HSC initation. Bottle from Elysian in Seattle. This beer is a clear copper/orange color with a thin light beige head that dissipates steadily. Rings of lacing on the glass. Nice pumpkin pie aroma with notes of cinnamon and nutmeg. Medium-bodied with pumpkin flavor at the forefront, backed up by sweet malt, nutmeg and cinnamon. The finish is spiced pumpkin goodness that lingers awhile. Very enjoyable overall."
"Drinkability: A splendid finish to a fine evening. The Great Pumpkin is a wonderful pumpkin ale and one I recommended, provided you're a fan of the style."
"D: Maybe my most anticipated beer and I was beyond pleased. Very drinkable if you like this style and really a good way to kick start the best month of the year."
"D - Pretty high, but it does get to be a bit much eventually. I mean you can only have so much pumpkin pie, right?"
"Ok, the aroma is a lot pumpkin pie. Brown sugar, llightly toasted bread, spices and a bit of orange. Tastes pretty darn close to pumpkin pie, too. The spice hits first then the brown sugar comes into play along with baked pumpkin. Representing the crust of a pie is the yeasty breadiness along with roasted malt. This is quite an experience. However, as it warms, it loses it's spice in the front and the pumpkin fades within the yeast and malt. Could use a bit more kick to it all the way through."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied and a bit slick with fairly strong carbonation."
"7/4/8/4/15 (3.8/5)"
"Thanks to wagenvolks for the share, 22oz bomber into 2 Brooklyn tulips. Pours a crisp orange with a thin diminishing head. The aroma is a huge amount of pumpkin spice with caramel malts right behind. The taste is more of the same, pumpkin spice is more predominate than in many other pumpkin ales, but still not over the top, the malts tend to shine through more in the finish, but the spices linger as well. The beer is fairly light and crisp with decent refreshing carbonation. This is certainly a very respectable pumpkin ale, one I would try again if given the opportunity."
"The flavor starts off bold and full of pumpkin pie notes, while a delicate lactic sweetness quickly gives way to a spicy booze onslaught. The aftertaste is a bit too massive, as tongue-lashing sweet and sour spices override the more delicate pumpkin front. Mouthfeel is creamy, but the body is a bit thick and syrupy to be a sessionable October brew (especially when you live in the Carolinas!). However, this was certainly an interesting craft beer experience, and easily the """greatest""" Pumpkin Ale I've tried."
"Poured a nice orangish with a quickly disappating head. The nose was pumpkin and spicey. Taste was pumpkin, nutmeg, spices and cinnamon. The nutmeg and cinnamon give it an extra kick and zing at the end. Mouthfeel was exceptional. This beer is very well balanced. The ABV seems light. The ABV and pumpkin taste was a bit more prominent on tap."
"Had this at the pumpkin festival at the Elysian in Capitol Hill. As the original reviewer noted, this is their Imperial Pumpkin- and a great beer it is. Probably my all time favorite pumpkin ale, and it is bottled too! Abv is 8.1% in 2007, and the beer is brewed with real pumpkin, roasted pumpkin seeds, and the malts are: pale, crystal 45, Munich, Cara-hell, and Cara-red. Spiced with cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and allspice in conditioning, and bittered with Magnum hops. Starting gravity 18.5 degrees plato. Pours a dark orange/amber with a creamy head and good lacing. Smells rich and sweet with notes of brown sugar and pumpkin pie spices. Tastes of creamy pumpkin, brown sugar, spice and fresh cream. Rich and full mouthfeel with a creamy finish. This is utterly delicious."
"[ADDENDUM] - After trying a carefully saved bottle this September I cannot recommend it more. Aged almost 1 year, the beer was fantastically spicy but smooth with a gloriously velvety mouthfeel. Buy a few bottles this year and stick a few in the cellar. Awesome!"
"Purchased a 22 at the brewery on Capitol Hill and served it in a pint glass at home. Appears orangish amber and a little cloudy with particulates. The beer poured with a thick ivory head and smelled of green apple and sugary pear directly after the pour, melding quickly into a strong, fresh pumpkin pie and spice cake. WOW! Smells like fall. Mouthfeel is substantial, a little syrupy, and good for the style. The taste was dominated by the spices of pumpkin pie: brown sugar, nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves. As it warms, the alcohol comes through. There is some hop bitterness in this beer toward the end, though mostly hidden up front by all the spice and caramelly malt. A strong beer, but it is still drinkable because it just tastes so good! Definately an excellent fall beer but one that will overwhelm your tastebuds after a few. Another great seasonal from the Elysian!"
"Definitely, my favorite pumpkin brew to date...I have never been overwhelmed by the style, but this one is the real deal."
"This is the Elysian Brewery's Imperial Pumpkin Ale. Yes the moniker fits because this is a brew fit for royalty. I seem to remember the ABV being something like 7.7 but I'm not certain. Anyway the body is is like autumn hued crystal ... perfectly transparent yet a crisp orange color. Head is a dense carpet of creamy foam. Oddly, you can't see any of the carbonation but you can feel it once you take a sip. Nose is big on nutmeg and cinnamon and yes of course, pumpkin. Flavors are much the same but this is certainly the beer that has done the best job of blending them. Pumpkin is thankfully big on the finish. I'd honestly say that this is the best Pumpkin Ale I've had ... previously it was Elysian's other Pumpkin Ale, Night Owl. Also, despite the ABV the alcohol is completely hidden. Probably would work like a charm as a dessert beer. This should become a very sought after beer ... I'm already hoping they brew it again next year."
