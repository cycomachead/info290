"Poured from bottle. Appearance is cloudy orange/amber. Aroma is full of pumpkin pie spices: nutmeg, cinnamon, clove; and a bubblegum note that may be the toasted barley. Flavors match the aromas with some pumpkin flavor on top of the spices. Medium body."
""
""
""
"Overall:  This is another very tasty offering from Harpoon.  It’s a very nicely balanced beer, and one that I’ll get again next Autumn."
""
"V - Good value, 8 bucks a six pack."
"O - a very decent pumpkin ale"
"O - I tried, but either Pumpkin beers are just a seasonal novelty to make cool bottle labels or pumpkins were just not meant for making beer.  I will continue to try these, but I have found very, very few that are worth a damn."
""
"This is so good. It's a liquid pumpkin pie, and that's a good thing. Much better than what I was expecting. I will get this again next year."

"I thought this beer was going to be a straightforward pumpkin ale but, as the UFO name might indicate, it seemed more like a pumpkin ale/wheat beer hybrid. While many people complain about pumpkin ales coming out earlier and earlier in the season, this beer might serve as a nice transition into autumn."

"I would enjoy this with Thanksgiving diner or a turkey sandwich."
"but not too much of the cinnamon flavor. Looks on the darker side of ales, smell has a pumpkin aroma..altogether a great pumpkin ale, and a new found seasonal favorite"

"Overall: I was rather surprised by this pumpkin ale. It's a medium flavored, easy drinking pumpkin beer. Not overly sweet or spiced. While I prefer a more aggressive approach, I would definitely recommend this one for those looking to try their first pumpkin beer."
""
""
"not the best pumpkin beer by far, but a good example that runs spice forward and shows what the style is about. Wish there was more pumpkin and less spice, but it works."

""
"Very nice seasonal offering!"
""
""
""
""
"A fantastic seasonal choice.  The light spices in this one give it a relaxed fall feel and make it a nice, chill on the patio kind of brew."
"Good pumpkin flavor, weird after taste.  Not my favorite, but could drink a bunch with out complaining."

"Pours out a cloudy amber with a full, thick head.  Smells primarily of pie spice, leaning towards cinnamon.  Flavor is pumpkin and pie spice forwarded.  The cinnamon stands out above all else.  Like dipping your finger into a bowl of cinnamon sugar, but not overly sweet.  Mild bitterness balances well.  Fluffy mouthfeel.  One of the better pumpkin beers in the more spice forwarded category."

"12 ounce bottle, stamp on bottle says enjoy by 02/15/14. Guess I can't complain, a buddy gave me a bottle of this a couple weeks ago so it was free. And I'm in the mood for a pumpkin beer so might was well try it! Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a cloudy orange/amber color with some sediment floaties noticeable. There's also an inch and a half off-white head with good retention, along with a decent amount of lacing. Aroma is nice, the brew smells like pumpkin spices and pumpkin. The taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes like pumpkin spices (nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves), pumpkin, and some bready malt. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy, smooth and easy to drink. I liked this brew, hopefully this upcoming fall I'll try a fresher batch of this!"

"The feel is bubbly and light with an effervescent, and lively spirit. This carbonated bubbling is more alive than lifting flavor from the palate."
""
"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before 12/15/2013. Pours hazy orange amber color with a 1 finger foamy white head with horrible retention, that reduces to a ring of lace quickly. Minimal lacing clings on the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of pumpkin, cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, ginger, wheat, bread, banana, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Nice aromas with prominent spice/yeast ester notes and moderate malt balance; with good strength. Taste of pumpkin, cinnamon, gingerbread, nutmeg, clove, wheat, brown sugar, light banana, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of pumpkin, cinnamon, gingerbread, nutmeg, clove, brown sugar, wheat, light banana, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Good balance, robustness, and complexity of malt, spice, and yeast ester flavors; with a good sweetness/spice balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a moderately creamy and smooth mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is good pumpkin ale. Good balance and robustness of pumpkin, malt, and spice flavors; and very smooth to drink. A pleasantly enjoyable offering."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A very well balanced beer. This comes off as malt balanced but not overly sweet, with some pumpkin pie spices present. Some complexity here, and I get a true pumpkin aroma and flavor to the beer--one of only three I've found so far in my tastings. Low carbonation hurts it a bit. I would happily drink more of this if I could find it!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a light copper with a finger of head that dissipated fairly quickly and left minimal lacing. The nose has both pumpkin and spice notes. The flavor profile also contains pumpkin along with a mildly spicy finish. Cinnamon flavor stands out at the very end of this nicely constructed, but light pumpkin ale."
""
"Pours very hazy orange golden color with a ring of head that last to the end. The smell is vegtable pumpkin and spice. The taste starts with a good bite from the spice and just a hit of pumpkin. Not to sweet moslty a clove and nutmeg story with yeast wheat finish. Mouthfeel is medium. A decent beer and a top 5 when it comes to pumpkin beers."
"O - quite good. Cheers."

"Overall/Comments: A very good pumpkin ale overall that has a nice flavor profile but is not a real stand out. The unfiltered aspect added a bit of intrigue to this offering. Classified as a Pumpkin Ale @ 5.9% ABV. Consumed 10/13/2013."
"O- I'm not much of a pumpkin ale drinker. Every other pumpkin ale I've drank has always been thick and spicy but this was a different experience and actually quite enjoyable. I would describe it like a light pumpkin sponge cake kind of beer."

"Enjoyed this one outside, on a beautiful and sunny fall day, surrounded by swirling fall leaves, right after taking the family pumpkin picking. The atmosphere couldn't have been better. The beer is a hazy, orange amber color and the head is faint and small. The spice smell is heavy on cinnamon, and a touch of clove. Some malt in the aroma, but the spice is serious. Balanced, and not too sweet. Similar flavor to the smell. Smooth and ful body. Satisfying for the weather. Nice, but not exceptional."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Aroma of pumpkin spices, cinnamon, allspice and pumpkin. The smell is fairly strong and is right for the season. In the taste, pumpkin, with sweet and vegetable notes, pumpkin pie flavor. Small bitterness and coarse leafy hop character. Medium bodied feel with lingering pumpkin pie flavor. Overall, this is a nice little pumpkin ale."

"I won't drink this again, but I'm glad I tried it. Onward..."

"On the lighter and thinner side of the pumpkin beer spectrum. Subtle spicing and more sweet malts. Ehhhh, middle of the road at best"
""
""
""
""
"Bought a six pack at Table and Vine. Appearance has a nice golden amber view. It poured a medium head but good retention. Aromas were definitely festive for me. My wife could smell the beer from a mile away and she said it smelled like biscuits. Extra aromas included spices like cinnamon, nutmeg, and of course the pumpkin smell. Delicious taste with a mix of that pumpkin flavoring with malts. Mouthfeel had a decent carbonation with a slight crispness. Overall, a really good, festive drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Pretty solid pumpkin beer. Better than most other pumpkin beers."

"O: Let me say that I do not like pumpkin ales. They are always too harsh and/or cloying and spicy for me. However, this beer really come across well to me. Less is definitely more with this style. Any amount of pumpkin spice will stand out compared to a typical beer so don't overdo it."

"Pours a hazy but bright orange colour with a limited off-white head that disappears quickly. Earthy aroma of spices and fruit with a respectable malt backbone. The flavour has a real depth to it, with light malts complementing the gourd elements. The spices are not overpowering and are not """typical pumpkin pie""" - there is a genuineness in here that is both surprising and delightful. Glad to have purchased."
"Overall - Interestingly this brew was completely different in a glass as opposed to right out of the bottle. In the bottle the drinkability was somewhat lower but it tasted like pumpkin pie, which was pretty cool I am not really a fan of pumpkin beers or fruit beers in general, but this brew was respectably done."

"Overall-- a very nice pumpkin beer. The hefeweizen wasn't a style that I thought would take to spices well, but this one does quite nicely. Very smooth and easy to drink and not overspiced."
""
"Overall- A decent pumpkin brew but nothing out of the ordinary. Easy drinking and a bit on the spicier side with a somewhat lighter pumpkin flavor overall."
"O: the bottle says that this is an ale brewed with pumpkin and spices. perhaps they just took their regular belgian white recipe and added the pumpkin to it. Overall a very light bodied pumpkin."
""
""
""
"Update on 9/5/13: I've had several of these this year after picking up a case and have decided this is the my favorite pumpkin ale of 2013. My guests from California agree."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel is creamy, pumpkin pie. I'm surprised the reviews saying no pumpkin taste, I disagree, and also now wonder if the UFO can, is somehow that much better than the bottle."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A hometown beer for me, and it lets me down. I have had UFO pumpkin before, and i didn't remember it being this low quality. Great appearance and smell, but the taste just brings it down. The mouthfeel would be great, except the taste brings it down."
""
"Great taste. I enjoyed every drop and bought some to take home. Now back in Australia I can't find anything that comes close I have tried a couple of other pumpkin beers that are available here but I am struggling to find a good pumpkin and spice beer."
""
""
"OVerall- Pleasant surprise. I'm pretty sure that it was an expired batch and it was still good so needless to say I will buy some of this years batch. Worth a try."
"O - Overall, if it tasted how it smelled, I'd be much happier, but it didn't, so of course, I'm not very happy. However, Harpoon does have a history of making good beer, so I can't be all that upset I guess. One bad beer doesn't make a brewing company bad, it might just have been a bad batch. But, I think I'll stick to the darker, stronger pumpkin beers from the likes of Southern Tier, Weyerbacher, and Dogfish Head."
""
""
""
""
""
"O-Not a bad pumpkin ale. I was afraid it would taste too much like soda because Harpoon doesn't usually make great beers, but this one is pretty good. The flavors aren't too pronounced, but the taste achieves a nice balance between spice and pumpkin. Pretty well done."
""
""
""
""
""
"Followed the instructions on the bottle to pour half and swirl up that yeast in the bottom. The smell was nutmeg and spicy. Poured dark and with a 1""" head. The mouthfeel was good although I didn't get too much of the pumpkin which I have been realizing the majority of the pumpkin brews are just beers that have a heavy spice and not too much pumpkin in them. Not one of my favorites but better than the bluemoon and harvest pumpkin."

"When you openly cop to being unfiltered, that speaks only one word to me - agitation! Following a vigorous wind-up of the beer, my pour got a finger of rocky, bone-white head that fell in a most unusual web-like pattern. The nose was beautiful! It smelled like I had lit a scented candle in my kitchen. Spicy, with notes of cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice ... it just smelled like Fall. That is my favorite, albeit fleeting time of the year and this took me right back. Color was a hazy yellowish-orange. Mouthfeel was a little on the thin side, but the spices had held up nicely. They melded together well and were present without being overwhelming. Oh man, I could go for some pumpkin pie right about now. That is what it really reminded me of - a liquid slice of pumpkin pie. Not overwhelming with spice or alcohol, but just right. Hold on, some little girl with locks of gold is knocking on my door. Sorry, sweetie, this is for adults. Finish was semi-dry with the spices really helping to mellow things out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall a great seasonal selection with a great sampler pack of 3 others if you can find it like this in your area. Great price ,I believe I had paid about 32 dollars."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I kind of forgot about this one in the refrigerator. The smell held up really well. The taste may have faded. It's a decent. I used to love this style, but Pumking ruined most of them for me."
""
"Comes out of the tap a hazy honey golden with a fairly thick pale golden fine-bubbled head. Aroma has malty and fruity notes plus hints of cinnamon and pumpkin. Malty flavor has hoppy and cinnamon notes, as well as a good amount of pumpkin taste. Unlike many other pumpkin ales I have tried, the pumpkin flavor does not dominate the others, which is a plus. Smooth texture has good body and a decent amount of fizz. Save it for fall - or enjoy it now."
""
""
"This is a middle-of-the-road pumpkin ale, worthy of those who enjoy this style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I poured this into a perfect pint glass, it has a nice murkey orange color body with a very little head that dissapears quickly leaving no lace behing. The smell is aromactic of spices, mainly cinnamon that i can smell. The taste starts off a little spicy with the cinnamon and spices, as it warms up a little bit the pumpkin comes into play and on the finish a nice little hop bite comes into play also. The mouth feel is really nice and overall this is a really good pumpkin beer."
""
""
""
""
"Pretty much what I expected from this beer. A below average pumpkin ale."
""
"Beer is medium-light in body, with medium-low levels of carbonation. Resulting mouthfeel is smooth, if not a bit stagnant in movement. Does not close out dry, but has moderate stickiness around the lips."
"Overall, the cola and fruity flavor is offputting. Definitely more dominated by spices than pumpkin. There are many better examples"
""
""
"This beer is amazing on-tap and really good out of the bottle. Best pumpkin beer out there in my opinion. Prefer it over Shipyard's Pumpkinhead, Long Trail's Pumpkin Ale, Imperial Pumking, and Wolaver's Pumpkin Ale. Enjoy in a warm place on a cold night for best results. Enjoy!"

"In fact, a trace of squash and a dash of cinnamon aside, the similarity to UFO White (or other commercial white beers) is suspicious. Spices notwithstanding, the beer has a notably zippy, orange-y, sweet, cracker-y wheat profile that is undeniably reminiscent of witbier. The departure from the heavily perfumed, spicy pumpkin ale to this breezier incarnation works for me but, to be clear, it's far from the epitome of the style."
""
"O: Interesting unfiltered pumpkin beer – worthy of a try."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pretty nice looking beer. Good head and decent retention. A hazy amber orange. Not much lace though. Nose is the best part for me. Smells like pie. Nice blend of spices and graham tinged crust. Pumpkin aromas are sweet and well balanced with the pale malt. Cinnamon is the front player as I inhale and the nutmeg leads back to the base aromas. Very nice. Taste is a big letdown. As good as the nose is the palate is not. Spices are a bit too forward of the malt and pumpkin. The hops are well done and there are some nice buttery notes as well but overall the beer is a bit disjointed with no connecting flow to the taste. To add the final blow there is a mineral edge in the finish that gives a platform for the spices to explode in a cascade of excessive bitterness. Cinnamon, clove, and pepper. It is better as it warms. but this is just not making it for me. Feel is light and crisp with a good carbonation. Very close to a solid brew but the details are taking this one down in my book. Maybe too much was put into the aroma at the sacrifice of taste."
""
"O: Now that I have reviewed this for the second time, my review is much higher than previously stated. There are a lot of artificial pumpkin beers out there, this is NOT one of those beers. One of the best out there!"
""
"12oz bottle courtesy of youbrewidrink, thanks man! Hazy orange appearance, cloudy really which is no surprise given that it is unfiltered. Smells of spice and spice and more spice. Flavor is the same, more spice than pumpkin and really nothing that wowed me. Overall, I am not a fan of pumpkin beers to start and this is one of the lesser ones I have tasted."
""
"O- Pretty good! The unfiltered makes it a bit different than most pumpkin ales. Worth a try."
""
""
"Found on tap at the Tuscan Kitchen in Salemn, NH this seasonal brew looks clear and golden copper colored with a healthy white head and great lacing. The aroma offers a classic, tasteful blend of wheat and pumpkin with a touch of sweet grass hop. The flavor is a very solid combination of slightly sweet pumpkin grass and tangy wheat with spice/cinnamon nuances. This is a nicely drinkable pumpkin brew with medium-light body and a clean, moderately carbonated, tingly feel. Not bad at all, would gladly revisit."
""
""
""
"D - An average at best Pumpkin Ale... Unfortunately this is neither one I can recommend nor seek out again given the wealth and variety of season offerings available... A very promising aroma is the highlight and is accompanied by sheer mediocrity in all other facets... Not really what I'm looking for in a Pumpkin Ale..."
""
""
""
"I remember one of my first craft beers was a UFO Hefeweizen...I guess it was part nostalgia, part ticking impulse that made me pull the trigger on this one. It pours a lightly hazy amber-straw topped by a half-finger of off-white foam. The nose comprises mild pumpkin pie, complete with crust, along with some bland wheat-like notes in the background. For once, it's unnecessary to list off the constituent spices and whatnot, 'cause here they just blend together too nicely, smelling almost too much like actual pumpkin pie for their own good. If only it were more powerful, this would smell amazing. The taste, though, makes me wish the exact opposite: The pie is still there, I suppose, but everything has gone rancid, putrefied. It's an all-out blitz on my tongue, finishing with a long-malingering sting of straight clove and black pepper. Imagine just chewing on those two spices in their raw forms. Yeah. This was awful, to say the least. Not only does it hurt as I drink it, but more pain follows while I'm trying to wrap my head around the maw that opened up between my perception of the smell and the taste. Damn. The body is a light medium, with a moderate carbonation and a lightly watery, lightly grainy feel. Overall, this has got to be one of the worst pumpkin beers I have ever had. It's still got a couple months on its 12/13/12 best-by date, but it seems like it's already starting to decay in the bottle. Shit, at this point I'd rather gnaw on a human bone dusted with cinnamon than take another sip o' this monstrosity."
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not bad - but definitely nothing stellar; a pretty easy drinking pumpkin beer - that's really about it. Lack of complexity and mouthfeel leave something to be desired, but it still has some decent pumpkin character."
"O: Easy to drink but not the strongest or most well-defined flavors/aromas of the pumpkin and spices. A good pumpkin beer but not a great one."
"Overall: Decent Pumpkin Ale, I would have this one again."
""
""
"I wasn't expecting much from this one but I was pleasantly surprised at how tasty this one was. I would highly recommend this one, especially for the price."
""
""
""
""
"Not as 'in your face' as most pumpkin beers, but still sort of bland overall. Beautiful orange cloudy appearance in the glass, not much in the terms of head. Medium bodied with some slight nutmeg, cinnamon, and fall type spices. Decent finish. Drinkable and alright, but nothing compared to some of the other fall seasonals out there."
""
"O: Certainly an enjoyable pumpkin that is less spiced than a lot of pumpkin beers out there, but also doesn't have much pumpkin featured in the taste or feel. Fits the season well, but is still more of a novelty pumpkin pie spice beer than anything else"
"Lightly toasted malts; slightly nutty. Pumpkin pie filling (squash and caramel and brown sugar) malts fill in. Nicely captured. Spices (nutmeg and cinnamon again) and a little orange citrus zest into the finish. Lingering malty pie filling and sugary crust. Medium bodied, with a creamy feel. One of the better non-imperial pumpkin ales I have sampled."
""
"T. A nice celery taste to it. Nice pumpkin, this is what you look for."
"O - Nice flavor and decent aroma, but not the best pumpkin ale. It does have the heavy spiced pie profile that I like, but it almost borders on watery and has no head to speak of after a half minute. Would have again, but not over quite a few others."
""
"Back when I was in my Pumpkinhead phase, I probably would have rated this much higher than that beer since the body is much better. For those looking for these type of beers, it's hard to complain about UPO Pumpkin."
"Smells like the empty pie tin after I ate all the pumpkin pie. Initial like an amber or dark ale middle has a moderate earthy pumpkin taste but with not a lot of spice. The end is the same subdued with a quick clean finish. No lingering taste. Good session beer do a pumpkin beer!"
""
""
""
""
"This isn't a bad beer, but the pumpkin and spices are down played by the other flavors. This is easy to drink and somewhat enjoyable, but there are far better pumpkin beers out there."
""
"Overall, and average to below average pumpkin beer. It is quite good at first but the flavors don't hold up throughout the entire bottle. Worth trying but I wouldn't go out of my way to seek it out."
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a cloudy caramel/orangish color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of pumpkin, some spices. Taste is spicier than the smell, nutmeg and cinnamon, some pumpkin, a bit of hops as well. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is an enjoyable beer."
""
""
""
"Overall a good beer, friendly to the palate and decent on the wallet."
"12oz. bottle served in an American Pint glass. Pours a hazy, dull orange with a quarter inch, frothy, bright white head embedded with craters. Nose expresses all-spice and a trace of cinnamon. Taste follows nose; however, it all comes off a bit watered down. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with an easy, even carbonation. However, as with the flavor profile, the body feels a bit watered down. Overall, a fairly drinkable, albeit somewhat lackluster Pumpkin Ale. That said, it's fairly quaffable in that none of the flavors come off over the top or cloying. Not bad, but there are better out there."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a copper tinted amber, fluffy white head, hazy and some particles. Scent brings pumpkin pie spices, lots of cinamon here, pumpkin pie filling, light clove and ginger. Taste more muted then scent dictates, malt comes in a bit more with some light brown sugar and dried malt sweetness. Lighter side of medium bodied, slighlty bubbly. Decent pumpkin, getting lost in the shuffle."
""
"Overall a very drinkable ale, fairly refreshing and flavorful without being heavy handed considering the style."
"light-medium body, sweet, yet refreshing. a very nice, sweet ale.. kind of reminds me of a wheat beer in certain aspects.. hmm"
"M- Light bodied, decent carbonation."
""
""
"O: this is a pumpkin ale I would come back to."
"Overall Drinkability: A good pumpkin ale."
"Perhaps the best of the UFO series. Not particularly unique, quite drinkable and appropriate for style. 4.0"
""
""
""
""
"Very good."
""
""
"O: Overall i would say this is a slightly above average beer. Pretty good but not the kind you run to the store and snag before it runs out. Definitely something i could see myself drinking a few of in a row without being too overwhelming. Not bad for a newcomer to the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O:Another average pumpkin beer; in fact, this one sits right in the middle of the road for what I’ve had so far this season. I don’t think I’d try it again, though it certainly put me in the autumn spirit for the moment."
"This--this is solid. As for pumpkins, it's medium spicy and a little dry, less sweet than blue moon's, less pie-ish than Schlafly's, not as zippy or alcoholic as Pumpking. So it falls behind each of those beers, since there's nothing all that characteristic about it aside from that it's a boilerplate example of its style."

"Overall: A nice and sessionable pumpkin beer. Nothing out of the ordinary, but certainly above average and certainly tasting like a Harpoon beer. This is one I will get again."

"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a bright, hazy, orange-copper coloring that is opaque, with a thin, filmy partial coating of bubbles on the surface. Aromas of pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg, and pastry crust. Smells are well blended and rich, but refrain from being overpowering. Very inviting. The flavors are light, with a touch of booze character escorting a subtle pumpkin and spice blending. Not nearly as flavorful as the nose alludes to. Overall, it comes off a bit watered down. The spices are barely discernable at all, and the pumpkin transitions into a sharp, quickly fading character of the aftertaste. Crisp, sharp, slightly overcarbonated finish cleans the palate, but does not really inspire a rush to drink more. I have to admit, this had me excited to try, but a bit confused at the end."
"Overall - While it's a good Pumpkin Ale, my favorite is still Tyranena Painted Pumpkin Ladies. The flavor, while good, could've been alot more vibrant even in it's colder state. Still, this is most certainly worth checking out."
"This is a can't go wrong unfiltered pumpkin ale. It's definitely worth a try and this particular brew is well balanced in terms of spicing. Nothing stands out in terms of spicing, but in its subtlety, it makes for an easy drinking yet flavorful brew. I love this type of brew and look forward to this time of year. For those who may have not yet tried a pumpkin ale, this would be a good choice to get started."
"Overall - It has a great scent, but the taste falls a little flat. It has a bit too much clove flavour that kind of dulls the palate. Still an above average brew that is worth picking up."

"T: There's the jacked up, sweet, boozy candy pumpkin flavor in some brews and then there's what I'd like to call the """Honest Pumpkin Ale""" with its true taste of pumpkin without the extraneous hoopla...This is an """Honest Pumpkin Ale""". True pumpkin taste honored, not drowned out, with the Fall spices."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: better than your average pumpkin beer, not an amazing beer but worth trying if you are going for some of these."
"O- balance is key to a great pumpkin ale and it is done effortlessly here."

"O: Another ho-hum pumpkin beer. The aroma was pretty nice, but the flavor profile left me disappointed, as usual with beers of this style."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A nice beer but not one I'd drink by itself. It's something nice to have around Thanksgiving. This would go great with some turkey, stuffing, gravy, pumpkin pie, and all the """traditional""" foods of that holiday."
""
"O - for an easy drinking pumpkin beer this is above average. Nothing too complex or crazy but solid. Not on the tier of Weyerbacher/Schlafly etc but still a decent option if you are looking for pumpkin beer that goes down easy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: this really is a great beer coming out of Harpoon. I enjoy most of their beers but feel that this really goes up a notch from some of their other seasonal ales. I will definitely be getting this again and love the price point on a 6 pack here."
"Overall: For me, nothing says mid-August in the sweltering heat of Georgia like an Autumntime pumpkin beer??"
""
""

""
""
"O- There isn't much special about this beer, however it is one of the better pumpkin beers I've had but far from the best. Nice pumpkin flavors that balance well in the beer. Easy to drink. Would recommend trying this if you like pumpkin beers."
""
"I'll definitely have a few more of these this season. The best UFO offering from Harpoon."
"O: Not much of a pumkin ale fan but this was pretty decent. Hard for me however to have more than one or two in a single session as the sweetness and spices tend to become a bit cloying and unappealing for me at least."
""

"Dark orange in color with a deep unfiltered haze. Poured with a dense off-white foam that slowly reduced to a wispy cap. Aroma is well balanced with sweet pumpkin and spice. Starts off with a thin watery feel that quickly thickens as the rich carbonation rolls through the middle. Sweet pumpkin pie like flavors that are well balanced with spicy clove throughout. Finishes with a touch of hop bitterness and spice. I'm not a huge Harpoon fan, but this one was pretty impressive."
""
"12oz bottle purchased in a 12pk at Market Basket in Somersworth. Pours a murky orange-amber with little to no head. Pumpkin pie spice intermingles with nut and clove. Pumpkin pie spice hits the palate first with nut, banana, and clove and lemon notes. Medium to light in body with moderate carbonation. Overall, not bad. An unexpected combination that works really well together. Super drinkable. I'll definitely be getting this one again."

"A spicy and rich brew that still has a very nice balance, not sweet and with some undelying hoppy bitterness. Quite drinkable, one of the better pumpkin brew for sure."
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve-ounce brown glass long-neck bottle with a pry-off crown, served a standard Pilsener glass."

"O: this is a nice feature of pumpkin pie flavors with a decent malt profile in the back. Worth a try."
"If you're really interested in trying some real pumpkin beers, I'd recommend Southern Tier's Pumking, Dogfish Punkin' Ale, Weyerbacher Imperial Pumpkin Ale, and Shipyard's Smashed Pumpkin. Let me know how it goes..."

"O: Not bad, very mild pumpkin and pumpkin spices. I expected a bit more for a 5.9% beer. Very smooth and drinkable though, that salvages a lot of points."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A well-crafted pumpkin ale. Highly enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
"O - This has good drinkability. It has a nice flavor, and i could easily knock back a few bottles in an evening. Overall, I thought this was a pretty good pumpkin ale. It has more hop presence than a lot of the other ones out there, which I like. I recommend giving this one a shot."
"Overall: At last, a pumpkin pie beer where the crust plays a prominent role; nicely balanced, without the spice excess that some brewers employ"
"The feel of this beer is light and crisp with a refreshing feel to it. It goes down rather easy and males for a good fall beer ."
"This beer tastes great. I feel like pumpkin beers are either great or bad, and this one is pretty great. Probably one of my fav pumpkins. No other pumpkins (that I have had) come close to the uniqueness that the hefe brings. Great, mild pumpkin and spice flavour. Its not overwhelming but very subtle and quick. I think its a great choice when buying a pumpkin brew, but probably would never drink more that one or two at a time. Well worth the purchase though."
"I think Harpoon made the right choice on putting a pumpkin offering in their UFO lineup, it just makes sense. A bit more flavor left from it being unfiltered make for a very well rounded brew. Too many times I have run into ultra filtered pumpkin beers that taste like soda ... not here. Worth a go."
"With this being an unfiltered pumpkin ale, I found it to be quite tasty! It has got a nice light color to it and is a very drinkable beer with the spices and pumpkin taste complimenting each other nicely. I drank quite a few of these and will be getting more as this is a nicely done pumpkin ale."
"D: A little tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a decent lighter pumpkin beer to drink for a while if you’re in the mood for the style."
"final beer from my last mix six i bought . poured from the bottle into a pint glass . the appearance is a hazy orange with a nice head. the spice seem to be the main presents in the armoma . taste is a bit of orange and some honey yet there seem s to be a bit of bitterness and some nutmeg. not a bad beer but it wouldn't be my first choice."
"The Rest: A decent pumpkin beer; it's a bit heavy on the nutmeg, but it is otherwise fairly crisp and not as heavy as some others I've had."
"If you see it in the cooler and you're curious go for it. It's a decent brew but don't expect anything too amazing."
"Poured an orange-amber, a thin collar is produced without any real head. Some bubbles and a thin film are left behind. Nose has some pumpkin pie without the crust (innards of a pumpkin pie?), pumpkin pie spicing - some cinnamon and allspice. Some light creamy and milky character that really adds a nice touch. Taste is lightly spicy, pumpkin character with some spicing similar to the nose. Light body that's somewhat watery, but still has some pretty good pumpkin pie 'innard' flavour. Good flavour, but lacks the whole package in terms of body and weight."
"The beer pours a hazy dark amber color with a 1/2""" off-white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a mild pumpkin scent along with a touch of cinnamon and nutmeg. The taste is decent as well. It has a nice pale and crystal malt base along with an excellent pumpkin flavor. The spicing is moderate at best with a modest addition of both cinnamon and nutmeg. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is an easy drinking pumpkin beer. It's flavorful without being too much so."
"Although the alcohol could have been toned down a bit, it didn't detract from this beer at all. This is a middle of the road brew that will offend nor excite few since it's not extreme. Most will be pleasantly surprised by the easygoing nature and likeability of this and for those who can't grab a slice of pumpkin pie, this will serve as a solid substitute."
"O-Another surprise of the tasting, after having a good bit of Harpoon beer I was worried about this one but it ended up tasting decent after warming up a little."
"Pleasantly surprised by this beer. Glad I was able to find it when I was in New England"
"I'm going to rate this as an excellent pumpkin beer, better, I think, than DFH's Punkin, on par with Brooklyn's excellent offering."
"Overall-Pleasant suprise by harpoon. I really enjoyed this one. Considering we don't get many pumpkin beers I will be re-visiting."
"Taste is a bit drier than expected with powdery nutmeg and cinnamon carrying the day. Kindy of 'dusty' tasting and the sweet pie aspect is all but lost. There is a fair amount of 'pumpkin' feel to the beer and the spices are not overdone...but I think the beer falls short of any sort of 'wow' factor. Im glad I bought a sixer, but dont see myself going back for more this season."
"This brew poured out as a nice hazy burnt orange color with a foamy cream colored head on top. The lacin in minimal but the retention is holding up fairly well so far. The smell is a little spicy, it almost smells a little sweet too. It doesn't have the biggest aroma to it but yet it does have enough to interest me. The taste for me was really quite good in my opinion. I liked the spicy kick that each sip had. The flavor were nicely balanced here. The mouthfeel was pretty good, had a medium body, good carbonation to it and remained smooth. Overall this beer to me was a really nice seasonal brew. Well worth the price and I would gladly drink it again."
"Pours a hazy amber orange with a thin head. Not much retention, but did have some laceing. Aroma is of pumpkin and spices. This beer is medium bodied and carbonated quite a bit. Taste is mostly pumpkin. Some spice there, but not a great balance. Very geniric.Not one of my favorites."
"A much better beer than I was expecting going into this review. Very drinkable at a surprising 5.9% ABV."
"Overall I guess I am on the other side of the fence expecting a nice bit of spice to balance overall pumpkin flavors. Without the spice it's like drinking squash in a blender. Will not buy again."
"Pumpkin beers seem to be split into two camps: the spice bombs and the highly vegetal. Harpoon does a nice job of reaching across party lines and bringing together the pie spice and vegetal pumpkin. Good stuff."
"Drink: Interesting, but average overall. Relative lightness makes it an easy drink, but the bitterness cuts into the spices and other interesting flavors a bit too much. Points for giving me nostalgia of gingerbread houses."
"The body is light and the carbonation is a bit full. Overall a tasty fall seasonal, but I would prefer a little bit of a drier pumpkin beer myself. This one is just a touch sweet."
"o- hate to mark it a 3.5 since its a good beer but the feel on the palate makes it a little less drinkable than others. but i enjoy it."
"O: The beer is easy to drink but seems like it could use stronger flavors of pumpkin and spices."
"O: Not the best pumpkin ale out there but what's there is decent. I'd like more spices in the taste but other than that it's a pretty average beer for the style."
"Overall, not a bad beer, and a good first attempt at a pumpkin from Harpoon. Good pumpkin session."
"O - This one turned out to surprise me...I honestly wasn't expecting much but it turned out to be one of the better Pumpkin Ales I've tried so far this year...the pumpkin pie flavors are there with a dry wheat malt"
"O: A very enjoyable, spicy pumpkin ale."
"Picked up a bottle at Abe's Cold Beer out of curiosity. I'd prefer the alcohol were lower, but otherwise it's an easy-to-drink American wheat/pumpkin hybrid. It pairs clean, pale wheat and barley with a mild (and more importantly, balanced) mix of pumpkin pie spices. It's sort of a subtle beer and some might find it watery, but I'd have another."
"I could take or leave pumpkin beers more so with beer with pumpkin in them but this one is just right. It has a good malt backbone and spices which are balanced perfectly."
"my local store keeps running out of this ufo pumpkin afer 2 trys I finally scored a 6er. I love pumpkin ales so I was really excite to try this one. When I first poured this ale I noticed how cloudy it is. It says """unfiltered""" on the label and it looks unfiltered. The colo is a nice golden brown, it reminds me of baked goods. The smell is full of holiday/pumpkin spices. The taste is a unique blend of malt, cinnamon, allspice, pumpkin spice, and maybe some ginger. All in all this is why I love the pumpkin ales- all the spices mix so well with beer. This is a pretty nice little pumpkin ale and it has my pallet ready for more."
"This pours a slightly hazy light orange with a decent foamy white head with good retention. The smell is good, full of pumpkin and spice. The feel is medium to light with good carbonation. The taste is a little disappointing though pretty bitter and dry, I get a little pumpkin and spice but its nothing like it smells, overall okay but not up to the smells standard."
"Pours a two finger cream head that fades quickly leaving some lace. Hazy amber/orange color. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Spicy pumpkin nose, flavor is spice and tart pumpkin, dry finish. $1.99 for a 12oz bottle from Jake's Market Springfield, Vt."
"Overall, a pretty pleasant brew and a nice change of pace from the heavier pumpkin beers you find this time of year."
"O-looks and smells got me excited, but this was a let down. the taste made me think of what might happen if a macro decided to brew a pumpkin ale. overall, its still a drinkable beer that isn't completely terrible. however, the pumpkin beer markest is large and this example won't make a dent."
"This is mostly unoffensive, although there are some strange malt flavors. The spices are decent, and the use of actual pumpkin is a plus. I probably won't buy this again, but I'd drink it again."
"Little disappointing it is more of the usual straight up pumpkin pie flavor with a noticeable wheat beer finish. The mout"
"Overall: Don't let this warm up. Cold, it's an easy drinking take on the pumpkin ale, with only a few off flavors, but once it warms, it falls apart and turns in to a discordant mess. Decent,"
"Overall not bad, I was expecting worse but the malts weren't bad, light hops are nice, the pumpkin or spices weren't overpowering but let you know it was there."
"started promising, but ended disappointing. Those that like the overly spiced pumpkin beers (shipyard, anyone?) may like this as it adds a touch of real pumpkin to it, but I don't overly enjoy it. I may recommend it to some gateway beer lovers, though."
"I love the fall because that means pumpkin beer. I really enjoy shipyard pumpkin and have a soft spot for harvest moon. When I tasted Harpoon's UFO Pumpkin it blew my mind. It was the first time it really tasted like liquid pumpkin pie. Although it's still well before fall it gives me that feeling every time I enjoy one. Looking forward to having it with cold weather foods!"
"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle stamped BB12/15/11-08:01-175N. Sample on August 18, 2011. It pours amber-orange with a bit of a haze and a thin head. The aroma has a nice combination of pumpkin, nutmeg, and other spices with a whiff of hops at the end. The body was thinner than I might have hoped. The taste had enough pumpkin flavor so that it lives up to its name but it was nothing that was out of the ordinary. It finished clean and crisp but all told, it was really fairly routine."
"I would drink this one again."
"Well done."
"Well, it's a pumpkin ale and it seems well done. This style is usually dominated by wanna-bes but I think Pumpkin UFO captures the essence of it well in a drinkable form."
"Interesting and certainly has the autumn pumpkin feel, along with another tart fruit hint. It is kind of like pumpkin fruit soda. The balance of flavor is lost with time and knocks this one down a level as it didn't start off too badly."
"I was excited to get in the fall spirit, and try a newly released pumpkin beer. I should of had my iPhone on me but I Made snap judgement. This beer has an ok aroma. The apearance is the best part about the beer. The Taste is bland pumpkin on the finish. It was hard to detect any spices, if I did they were barely used in this beer. Over all a very, very bland pumpkin beer. My bartender summed it up by saying """it tastes like budweiser mixed with pumpkin.""" I wouldn't go that far, but it wasn't good. Give it a shot, all I know is this one is not for me. Harpoon is not a bad brewery, they just need to tweak the next batch perhaps."
"Had fresh on tap at the Burren, it was really f-ing good. Awesome aroma. Get it on draft."
"Orange/red, pretty much burnt pumpkin. Small amount of head with a thick ring around the glass afterwards. Only an extremely small amount of haze. F.O Pumpkin. Nose is spicy nutmeg, pumpkin and sourdough. Light body with a crisp tingle on the tongue. Light bready malt body with nutmeg and pumpkin spices. Finish is almost nothing, watery, a bland dryness, and only a carbonation tingle."
"It sounds boring, but this is a fabulous beer. A perfect session pumpkin. Not over the top, not that mild, just right to drink a case or two."
"Make a 100-barrel pumpkin beer, guys. This one's not up to snuff. Kind of a harsh grade, but there's no way this is above average in the spectrum of pumpkin beers."
"Pours a hazy deep orange amber with a slight off white head. Doesn't stick around long and almost no lacing. Aroma of cinnamon and pumpkin. Flavor begins with a nice touch of pumpkin pie spices. Cinnamon leading the way. Also some nutmeg. Nice job not overpowering the pumpkin finish. Pumpkin pie filling finish which lingers into the aftertaste. Touch of hops in the beer. Solid drinkable pumpkin offering from harpoon which still maintains the characteristics of a beer. A lighter pumpkin offering for those of you who aren't looking to be overpowered by spice and heartiness."
"If you like the style check it out, nothing eye popping but definitely a solid addition to the UFO/Harpoon lineup."
"If you're really interested in trying some real pumpkin beers, I'd recommend Southern Tier's Pumking, Dogfish Punkin' Ale, Weyerbacher Imperial Pumpkin Ale, and Shipyard's Smashed Pumpkin. Let me know how it goes..."
"O/D: It's a solid harpoon addition, good for summer right now, I can see it being very enjoyable in the fall. It's an easy drinker, but with all the other pumpkin beers out there, I don't see myself picking much of this up."
