"Its the closest thing you can get to pumpkin pie in liquid form."
""
""
"An okay pumpkin ale with a good aroma but an average taste. But it does come with a nice abv of 8% making it a little stronger than some of the other ones."
""
"This was really good the first time I tried it, but the second six pack I bought tasted overly sweet with hints of bubble gum that kind of ruined it for me."
"I'm not big on pumpkin ales, but this one hits just the right note of subtle spice and clean hops. Perfect for Thanksgiving dinner."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"My wife's favorite pumpkin beer, she didn't used to be a fan of pumpkin beers until this one. Not too sweet or wimpy. Good choice for sure"

"Not a fan of pumpkin beers, but a worthy effort."
"O: The best pumpkin beer I've ever had. Bravo, Schlafly."
"Finally, it has a really nice orange color to it."
"this kicks off my lengthy Halloween season and carries me all the way through the holidays. nothing but warm happy feelings. I'll usually stock up enough to even have a bottle or two to spare for pumpkin beer bread at Thanksgiving and an ice cream float on my birthday. lately it seems to appear a little earlier every year, but I can't find it in me to complain. share this with your friends who are wary of beer and of pumpkin brews, and with those who are wasting cash on lackluster pumpkin ales from bigger names."

"O:  Interesting pumpkin beer.  I really enjoyed this one, but more than one of these in a session would be a bit much."

"Mouthfeel is thin and watery, with a little ABV burn, light carbonation and a very spicy finish that's typical of a pumpkin beer or winter warmer. This was good, but the spices need to be dialed back a little for me to really want to have this again."

"O: Overall tasty, but I feel like it has been hyped up a bit and gauging from the price of the 6 pack, that seems to be true. For a pumpkin beer, it's good.  For the price, Pumpking is more enjoyable."

"O â€“ Pumpkin beers are difficult, and this one strikes a good balance of pumpkin sweetness and pie spice.  Alcohol is well hidden.  Solid."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: tasty and drinkable, I don't need much more out of a pumpkin ale.  It didn't knock my socks off like some other reviewers here, but it's a perfectly serviceable pumpkin ale."
""
"During a pumpkin taste test between my wife and I, this won hands down. It struck the right balance between the spices (cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, and non sweet pumpkin) and a big Amber ale. Smell was the spices of a pie right to the nose. Delicious. The 8% was extremely well hidden. Best Schlafly beer I've had."
"This is a perfect pumpkin ale. The pumpkin really kicks through, not overly spicy but has that apple pie undertone. Smooth ale taste. A slight bit tart, in a good way. A mild bitter in the back of the mouth. Well balanced."

"I do believe there is a ceiling for this style and this beer has possibly reached it. Quite simply the best pumpkin beer I have ever had."
""
""
""
"O - I had this beer on tap four years ago. I remember liking it better then. Pumpkin beers are not as high up on my list as they used to be. That being said, this is a great example of the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- very few pumpkin beers are able to accomplish a balance with all of the necessary ingredients of this style, this is one of them.  The only thing that keeps it from being a higher rating is that the sweetness seems to linger a bit much as it warms"

"Aroma is real nice, wafts of pumpkin pie reminiscent of the filling. Aroma has hints of cinnamon and caramom. Good but lacked something i found. Was hoping for more pie flavor like in the aroma."

"The most balanced pumpkin beer."
"The texture is medium, slightly oily, and highly carbonated. overall i'd have to say i am really not a fan of the style, but i liked that the actual pumpkin flavor was there and not just pumpkin pie spice."

"Deep reddish-amber color. not much head, dissipates quickly. big pumpkin aroma, spices-nutmeg, cinnamon...pumpkin pie! big, creamy mouthfeel-medium to full bodied. taste is of pumpkin pie, filled with sweetness, spices. Not too sweet! also, not syrupy, but its a big pumpkin ale, and definitely a sipper. wish it was thanksgiving with this one."

"By far one of my favorite pumpkin beers of the season.  Put a cinnamon/nutmeg rim on the glass and you've got a glass of pumpkin pie."
"Intense aroma of pumpkin pie with a luscious deep orange-red color.  Taste is strong pumpkin pie, very sweet, with a malty finish that is as close to pumpkin pie as you get. There is an alcohol presence which detracts but overall a great pumpkin."
""
"O:  A good beer.  Maybe I judged it too harshly.  I just compare this one to Good Gourd and Alewerks and find those two far better."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"As for Pumpkin beers, this one is my favorite hands down.  Smooth with just the right level of pumpkin flavor, not pumpkin-pie mind you, while retaining it's characteristics as a beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: Probably the best fall beer I have ever had, perfect balance, great tasting, and makes the fall even more beautiful. Amazing beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"As of this writing, my new favorite beer.  Drank it at El Bait in Des Moines September 2014."
""
""
""
" If you want an easier drinking, subtle pumpkin, I would suggest the Dogfish Head. If you want a more filling one closer to pumpkin pie/roll, this is what you need."
""
""
"Velvety soft blanket of vanilla and cinnamon. Initially tastes and smells more like a sweet baked good than a beer, but a nice balanced beer profile soon emerges. Abundantly spiced, but not too sweet and cloying. Cool, piney hops bring up the rear and make for a clean finish. No hint of the big 8% ABV. Pretty impressive and dangerously drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"T: On the pumpkin beer spectrum that ranges from pumpkin pie to gourd in flavor, I would argue that Schlafly is more on the pumpkin pie side. In fact, I would say this beer tastes strongly of rich pumpkin pie filling. There is also something in the taste that reminds me a bit of apple cider.  The spices are great and really build as I was drinking. Despite the richness, this beer somehow managed not to be too heavy or cloying."

"Had another tonight (45 degrees). Wow, save all your bottles for cold fall evenings and pair with an apple or pumpkin dessert."
""
""
""
""
"If you can get your hands on it, do so! It is a much better value than Pumking. You can get a 6 pack for about $11."

"Schlafly beers range from drain-pour to darn near best-in-catagory, and this is their magnum opus. THE pumpkin ale of the Midwest. With sweet tastes of cinnamon-dappled pumpkin pie and smells of nutmeg and baked goods, this pumpkin ale is one that cannot be missed when fall rolls around. I always manage to pick up a few cases throughout the fall, and I'm sure this fall won't be any different. Phenomenal."

"Overall: 3.75"
"Amazing. This and O'fallon's pumpkin beer is the best pumpkin ale I've ever had and I make it a point to try all of them."
""
""
""
"Outstanding clean pumpkin ali with just the right amount of spice.  All the aroma you would expect yet very light and refreshing.  Pours a cloudy golden orange brown.  Little to no head."

"Overall a very good pumpkin beer.  Some pumpkin beers focus too much on the spices all the way through, but this one has a good balance between spices and the sweet mashed pumpkin."
""
""
""
""
""
"Out of several Pumpkin/Spice beers I've tried, this is absolutely the best yet. Schafly has yet to produce a beer that wasn't outstanding."
""
"Awesome pumpkin ale"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-Overall I like this beer it prefect for your pumpkin ale fix"
""
"Very strong with alcohol smell/taste.  But great flavor.  Better then most."
""
""
""
""
""
"T: Cinnamon, clove, and allspice. Vanilla smooths the palate, and then earthy pumpkin comes in. Floral and herbal hops, subtle perfume. Nice spiciness, drying cinnamon and crusty flavor gives needed body (4.25/5)"

"O- Hit the nail on the head for a Pumpkin Ale.  One of my new favorites."
"O - I had heard good things about this pumpkin beer, and I'm a sucker for pumpkin pies and spices generally.  This balances this melange of flavors against a more traditional ale structure.  The result is perhaps the most solid take on the pumpkin beer I've found to date.  Delicious."

"Served up at 50F in a Samuel Adams pint glass. Poured a Dark/Golden Copper, with a nice one finger cap, that quickly dissipated. At the nose, cinnamon, pumpkin spice, malt and cloves. First taste, medium body with a nice malt, pumpkin pie taste, that finish a little dry at the end. Probably because of the 8.0 % ALC.  All in all, a well crafted pumpkin ale to ring in the start of the fall season. Cheers!"
""
"I am simply not a fan. I know so many people that rave about this pumpkin ale and compared to other varieties available it  just falls short."
""
""
""
""
"Excellent brew, I always look forward to fall and this beer in particular."
""
""
""
""
"I'm not crazy on pumpkin ale, but if I had to choose one, this definitely takes the cake."
""
"The best I've ever had as far as the style goes. The only 8%+ pumpkin beer I can knock a few back of without too much nutmeg or cinnamon messing up the palate. Highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Advertises a """pumpkin pie""" flavor and delivers with no remorse or apology. Otherwise solid without any negative qualities. The degree of pumpkin pie taste in this brew is intense, and rivaled by none in my experience thus far; leans to the sweet side. Everything I would ever hope a pumpkin ale to be not only promised, but realized."
""
"Prost!"
""
""
""
"With its punchy yet balanced flavor profile and fuller bodied mouthfeel, Schlafly's Pumpkin Ale is one of the better examples of the style I have yet to dry. I really hope this brewery distributes to New England sometime soon."

"I absolutely love this beer. It has wonderful balance and a solid body with a rich taste! I feel that too many pumpkin beers have a very sugary taste but Schlafly nailed this one! I get a deep flavor of cinnamon, pumpkin, spice, clove and a very small tone of cranberry. It is layered wonderfully and is an absolute pleasure to drink!"

"Overall- Most pumpkin ales teeter one way or the other but this one gets it right. Best balance I've had from one yet. I'd put it over ST Pumpking for sure. Just wish I was drinking this in October and not June."

"Great tasting beer which appears / tastes to change slightly every year! I believe this was one of the first pumpkin beers I ever tried, and to date, is still my favorite. There are lot of things going on w/ this beer that make it a great try for people of many different tastes. I would recommend this beers as a must try to start out your fall season (every year!)"

"My pour created two fluffy fingers of deep-tan head with great retention. Color was a deep-copper (SRM = > 22, < 27) with filament-quality brightness. Nose was very sweet and spicy and since they were going for pumpkin pie, I would say that they hit the mark! The label mentioned """cinnamon, nutmeg and clove""" and I was having a tough time discerning one form another. Mouthfeel was slightly viscous, syrupy and this was one of the sweetest pumpkin beers that I can remember drinking. It seemed dangerously close to diabetic shock in a bottle. Each successive sip was unrelenting in terms of its sweetness and I was feeling kind of overwhelmed. The finish was (finally) both spicy and sweet, but if I have railed against unbalanced in terms of spices, here was unbalanced in terms of malty sweetness. Whew! Definitely NOT my cup of pumpkin, but as always, YMMV."
""
""
""
""
"Itâ€™s super drinkable at 8% and it feels like 6%. Itâ€™s a well crafted beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not a very complex brew in the sense that it is very spice-forward, with a touch of sweetness in the front and bitterness in the back. Not bad by any means, but nothing really stand out."
"O-an absolute great pumpkin ale especially for a 12oz best taste for the money compared to other pumpkin ales"
""
""
""
"Decent pumpkin beer not too sweet with lots of Pumpkin Pie spices."
""
""
""
"The beer pours a clear amber brown with little carbonation and no residual head or lacing. The nose is a rum-like mix of spices and booze, caramelized sugar, and some gourdy undertones. The taste transcends the beer's nose and appearance bringing potent pie spices to the forefront, big pumpkin sweetness, and hint of bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel is medium, sweet bodied, slightly booze, so spiced that it's gritty, but also with an elegant gourd presence, great drinkability, and has a mildly biting, bitter finish. I do enjoy this beer and think it's refined enough to do well at the dinner table, but would likely not be my go-to beer out at a bar."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A very good, very solid pumpkin beer. Very nicely put together."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This definitely goes in my top 5 Pumpkin beers. This kinda takes everything I like about DFH - Punkin: well balanced, Good Gourd: huge clove+sweet pumpkin, though more subdued and Pumking. Going to seek out more Schlafly now!"
""
""
""
"Pretty decent pumpkin ale, not overbearing on the pumpkin tastes but what is there is noticeable and pretty good tasting."

"I am a HUGE pumpkin beer fan, gotta love that time of the year when they start popping up on the shelves in numbers. That being said, I've had a number of pumpkin beers and nothing comes even remarkably close to Schlafly's Pumpkin Ale. The best way for me to describe it is like pumpkin pie in liquid form. You would never guess the ABV based on the way it tastes, goes down very smooth. If you are a pumpkin beer fan this is a MUST have for you."
""
"Price Point - $2.50/12 oz single"
"When I think of pumpkin beer I cringe. They're usually overspiced and incredibly sweet. Schlafly's Pumpkin Ale is adequately spiced, nicely pumpkinized and all around delicious. This drinks more like a beer than an overly sweet dessert. I would drink a couple of these in the fall. If you're a fan of pumpkin beers this is the best I've ever run across, give it a go. Thanks, Matt!"

"O: Pretty good, it makes sense why this is one of the more popular pumpkins. It might be a little too sweet for me, like ultra-fine grown-up apple juice, but drinkable, especially in smaller quantities."
""
"O: one of my favorite pumpkin beers! If your looking for a pumpkin beer that tastes similar to pumpkin pie, definitely go for this beer. All time favorite pumpkin beer."
""
""
"The finish is kind of bitter which stands out as it doesn't really poke through anywhere else. Overall fairly creamy, very drinkable, a good pumpkin ale. Without looking, I never would have guessed this was 8%. Alcohol hidden very very well. I'm going to bring a couple of these back to Seattle with me as my good friend and former roommate is a huge pumpkin (and pumpkin beer) fan and I think he'd really appreciate this one. Personally, I probably won't pick up another 6 pack for personal consumption, but it's definitely worth trying in season if you have any interest in the style at all."
""
"Overall - my favorite pumpkin beer for a session. The style holds a special place for me as it was the style for my first review many seasons ago. It is the only pumpkin brew I faithfully get every fall. Awesome brew, Schlafly!!!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: very similar to the Whole Hog Pumpkin I had a couple of days ago in both profile and overall quality. These are among the best pumpkins I've tried, and clearly the best of the 5 I've had over the past 3 days. More clove in the Schlafly; slight preference for the Whole Hog."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a nice seasonal ale. Going with the current trend of higher abv, which seems to work well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Considering I am not a fan of this style, this hits the right notes without being overly sweet like most pumpkin ales. Another hit in the Schlafly collection."
""
""
"I might not have had the best available beer when I originally reviewed this.  On my re-review, I am getting all of the good from the original review, and almost none of the bad.  The beer is perhaps a little on the light side, but I think the pumpkin spice is perfectly balanced against a background of a familiar beer taste (dark fruit tones), with a light amount of carbonation, but definitely not the flatness I got in the first review.  I actually bumped up my review over .5 on the re-review."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Lip-smackingly good. One of the few pumpkin beers I've really enjoyed this year. This is up there with Good Gourd in terms of how much this smells and tastes like pumpkin pie. The smell is really something on this one. Highly recommend if you are interested in pumpkin beers and haven't tried this one yet."
""
""
""
"O-solid pumpkin beer, but lacks depth of flavor and complexity of some others"
"The best pumpkin beer I have had....Hands Down. I Will admit I have only had a few different pumpkin beers some good some not so good. But I recommend this pumpkin brew for anyone who has not tried one as well as Veteran pumpkin boozers. Pick this up n stash it for later in the year."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is very good but not the greatest. An easy rating of 4 to 4.25 Very smooth and drinkable for 8% ABV."
""
"O - Incredible beer by all means, this and Alewerks take the trophy home for pumpkin beers this year, and probly all years to come. This lives up to expectations, and might even surprise you. I wish I would have bought more now."
""
"When it is released get it, mail order it, do whatever you need to do to obtain it if you are a pumpkin beer drinker, as it will change your Pumpkin Beer Life!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a great pumpkin beer make no mistake about it. The alchohol content seems much more balanced than Pumking, and the aftertaste is way more soothing, but I still like Southern Tier Pumking better because it just seems to have more of a pumkin pie taste and the higher alcohol content makes it more refreshing. But no question if I could find a case of this I would purchase it in a heartbeat."
"Wouldn't mind having one around the holidays."
""
""
"A buddy at work brought me one of these, otherwise we don't get 'em in Colorado. Poured from an unassuming looking brown bottle with a yellow and orange label into a Bulleit bourbon glass. Pours deep orange with a light yellowed head of foam that disappears before too long. Aroma is very discernible cinnamon, nutmeg and clove, heavy on cinnamon, and cola. Excellent flavor, again heavy on cinnamon, but thoughtfully balanced against the other spices. Sweet and malty, certainly """pumpkin pie""" like, as they say. Mouthfeel is medium, light carbonation, and the alcohol leaves a light tingle on the tongue. If you chew it a little the alcohol really separates out from the other flavors and you realize what you're actually drinking, which is a pretty high abv brew that is not playing around as much as the seasonal flavors suggest! Overall this did not disappoint, certainly one of the best pumpkin ales I've been able to try. Pretty masterful."
""
""
""
"O - Love this beer. One of the best pumpkin ales out there. Great use of pumpkin. Not too much but enough for you to know that its there. Like the higher abv of this beer also. Great fall beer. Might have to track down some more of this for Thanksgiving!"
"O: This one had been recommended and now I see why. One of the better pumpkin ales out there. The robustness of Schlafly's pumpkin ale makes it a winner. The flavors stand up like a defensive line and knocks you on your ass like a pumpkin upside the head. I'll be drinking more of this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A very good pumpkin beer and rates up there with Dogfishhead for me. It is a bit more muddled than Punkin and not quite as refreshing but this beer hits all of the proper flavor notes. A must try for the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a tasty full bodied pumpkin ale."
"Overall- this is a decent pumpkin beer, far from great in my opinion. After reading the hype I was unpleasantly surprised. I hope that I got a bad batch and next time i'll give it another go."
"Pours a honey brown with a small off-white head. Poor retention and no legs to speak of. Nose redolent of spice, especially clove and cinnamon. Just a hint of pumpkin detected. The best way to describe the taste is to compare it to warm pumpkin pie. The pumpkin that was almost undetectable in the nose come through beautifully on the palate, balancing the spice perfectly. Some alcohol warming. Finishes slightly sweet. Medium bodied with light carbonation. Overall, a very smooth and well crafted pumpkin ale."
""
""
""
"My first beer from Schlafly. Lovin' it."
"I will say up front I really don't like pumpkin pie, but I like this beer. There is just a lot of flavor here, and a lot going on. Very much a fall beer, everything about it is perfect for fall. If you like pumpkin beers, definitely try this one, I am ready for more of it."
"Its just great. If someone were to ask me to recommend a fall seasonal, as of right now this is the one I'd tell them about."
"Overall it's so much better than their regular beers it drinks so balanced. I have never had such a tasty and complex pumpkin beer. Well done guys!"
""
""
""
""
"Gonna try to put some away for thanksgiving. Gonna be nice with Turkey day dessert and as a night capper."
"As good as pumpkin beer can be. Schlafly in STL has got a lot of good things going, and this pumpkin ale is one of them. Great flavor, hint of nutmeg. Not too overpowering with fruit flavor as some other 'beers' have. Not something to pound, rather a beer to relax and drink 1-2 of while enjoying the fall scenery. Fits perfect with this time of year."
"Overall a really really solid pumpkin beer, how they all should be. Not too sweet and a great spice balance."
""
"The reputation for this beer is that it is the gold-standard of pumpkin ales. For the most part, it lives up to the hype. The color is a nice dark amber with an orange hue (from the pumpkin). The aroma is big and pleasant. The taste is smooth and enjoyable. The presence of nutmeg is a little too much for me, but that is the only complaint I could throw at this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A very good pumpkin ale and one of the best in my opinion. I'll have to start picking this up every fall."

"Poured a deep dark cloudy amber color ale with a medium size foamy head with OK retention. Aroma of nutmeg, pumpkin and cinnamon with sweet malt backbone is quite enjoyable. Taste is a nice mix between some nutmeg, cinnamon and pumpkin with lightly sweet malt backbone. All flavors are very well balanced with sweetness offsetting some of the spices so that nothing gets out of hand. Body is quite full with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Very well brewed with great level of complexity while retaining good marks for drinkability."

"o - overall, a really well balanced pumpkin beer. not in your face, not overly sweet...just a super solid pumpkin beer. that being said, if you don't like pumpkin beer...you probably won't like this. but if you are going to try any pumpkin beer, give this one a shot."
"The more I drink of this, the more I love it. The spice flavor is leaving my mouth with a tingle and a slight numbing sensation from the sheer onslaught of spice love. My palate is giddy with cinnamon glee."
"O: 4.25 Delicious. A great example of what this style should be. I will be getting more of this for the fall as I watch my beloved Indy Colts this Fall."

"Pours tan/ light orange into glass with a medium head. Instant smell of pumpkin pie and malt as you pour. The taste of the beer is strong with pumpkin, crust, malt with a medium thickness to it. Compared to other pumpkin beers I've bought this really is a step above them. Would love to buy this again. The perfect beer for fall."

"There's a bit of cola flavor that I'm not a fan of, but how they get that great graham cracker note in there, I'll never know. Reminiscent of pumking. Definitely a go-to seasonal."

""
""
""

" The taste is unique with some mild red grape-like currant and cinnamon mixed with subtle bread pudding like caramel and spice combo yet the malt also has a dry toasted brown sugar edge with some mild coriander citrus and orange peel element which gives a very autumnal taste interesting in ways most pumpkin beers don't surprise. I would recommend this to anyone in search of a twist on the traditional pumpkin ale -almost like mince-meat with that spiced fruity flavor yet doesn't sacrifice the flavor of an actual pumpkin ale either it is exceptional in every way."
""

"While this wasn't as strong as an Imperial Pumpkin Ale like Southern Tier's Pumpking, this was strong enough and made itself known somewhat quickly. This didn't necessarily win me over to the point where I had to rush out and get the others that are presently flying off of the shelves but the hype is real and if you love fall beers, get your hands on this. It's the best that's out there and bound not to disappoint, even if you don't have any pumpkin pie on hand."

"O: This is a really good pumpkin style ale, far above some of the others I've had (i.e. Shipyard), but the lack of carbonation really seems like it has some wasted potential."
""

"3) I'm considering a re-review since I was much more impressed this time than last. However, in terms of numbers, I still think this is overall somewhere in the 3.9-4.1 range."

"O: Enjoyable beer, better than most veggie/ pumpkin style beers out there."
""

"Pours a dark copper color. 1/2 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and good lacing. Smells of strong spices (cinnamon, all spice, nutmeg, etc.), sweet malt, slight alcohol, and pumpkin. Fits the style of a Pumpkin Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of strong spices, slight alcohol, pumpkin, and slight sweet malt. Overall, good appearance, strong aroma, strong body, and blend is overtly spicy."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Great spice flavors, and true pumpkin flavor, particularly in the aftertaste. Overall, a bit sweet for my liking, but I suppose it tastes like some pumpkin pie, for sure!"

"O: Overall a very interesting beer. I still think it tastes a lot more like apple pie than pumpkin though. If you're a fan of apple pie you'll really like it. If you're a fan of pumpkin beers I think you will enjoy it too. One notable positive attribute of this beer is that it is 8.0% and doesn't have a strong offensive alcohol flavor."

"O: This is the best of the """fake""" pumpkin ales I've had. It doesn't come near brews made with real pumpkin, the cloying sweetness really holds it back. The heavy spices are completely necessary to cover up the sweetness. I'd drink it again for sure, but wont be seeking it out."
""
""
"Medium body with a strong zesty autumnal spice presence that dominates up frot lingering over the sweet malts before a sweet pumpkin pie/dessert presence shows up in the finish. Peppery with ginger, clove and cinnamon followed by caramel malt, pumpkin purÃ©e, vanilla and nutmeg. Â Interesting how the flavor profile changes mid palate. Â Still tons of spice but more dessert like in the finish. Â Only a subtle vegetal presnce but it makes it a bit more organic tasting than a pure dessert beer. Â Nice balance of both approaches to the style. Â Decently balanced but could be a touch sweeter. Â "

"As I said, not my favorite style. However, as pumpkin beers go, this one might be my new favorite. I can't get it in MN so thanks to Shrode21 for the extra."
""
"Copper tinted amber in color, creamy off-white head. Scent brings nice balance of seasonal spices, crusty grains and pumpkin with touches of cream, vanilla and brown sugar. Taste follows suit. Usually one for the sweeter pumpkin ales that taste like pumpkin pie (as opposed to over spiced ones), but this one tastes more like a savory pumpkin dish with a light sweetness. Medium bodied, lightly creamy. Very impressed with this one, right balance of all ingredients."
""
"O - I was expecting a bit more. This is a great pumpkin beer with plenty of spices, malt, and earthiness kept in pretty well balance. Tends to get a bit sweet on the finish. I'm just not """wowed""" by it though. Glad to have slayed this want of mine but my quest for the perfect pumpkin beer continues."
"O: One of the best of its style. I'll drink a few of these each Fall, but not many more. Rather have an IPA."
"O: One of the better pumpkin ales I've ever had. Perhaps even the best. A contender with Pumking for sure, but at the same time it's very different. Pumking is sweeter and tastes more like pumpkin pie, right down to the graham cracker crust and the whipped cream. This is more of a strict pumpkin ale, for better or worse. Great flavors and well balanced. Wish they distributed this here..."

"Overall: My favorite Pumpkin ale so far and one of my favorite beers ever."

"pour is clear brownish red with a light tan head. Nose is spice forward, nothing overpowering. Lots of cinnamon and nutmeg with a touch of cream and maybe a note of honey. Taste is more pumpkin spice forward, well balanced, creamy full body and crisp highly carbonated finish."

"Overall: A must try!!!"

"O: This was a pretty sweet beer with very apparent pumpkin spices/notes. Drink it on the warmer side. Shame I can't get this stuff in So Cal, but I enjoyed my time with it. I think it may have benefited from a full body. Anyway I would recommend and buy. Savor Great Beer!"

"Poured half bottle into rocks glass. Nice bourbon color, not much of a head, and the head completely disappears. Nice spicy malty aroma and flavor. Get a bit of a pumpkin flavor with maybe a bit of pumpkin pie spices. Marynka hops Malts include 2-row and Crystal malted barley, Munich malt, wheat malt, chocolate malt, and I think I get a bit of pumpkin pie spices. I get a bit of cinnamon, nutmeg, clove and maybe ginger? A tad bit boozy for this low of ABV, but it fades quickly into a nice dry finish. Pretty watery mouthfeel. Over all I think this would be a good match to any Thanksgiving din din. The Great Pumpkin hasn't arrived, but this is a good brew to enjoy while you await his or her arrival."
""
"I've dumped my share of pumpkin beers and truthfully, despite wanting to enjoy them, rarely do. That said, this is certainly the beer pumpkin beer I've had to date and one that I'd likely hazard to drink again. Nicely done Schlafly!"

"Overall, one of the best pumpkin beers out there. Very well balanced and not sweet at all. I could honestly drink a couple of these in a sitting. One to pick up every year."

"I had this beer 2 times in a bottle at Churchkey and at Number 9 1/2 in DC. This beer is overwhelming with spices like cinnamon, nutmeg and all spice. I want to like this beer but I just can't. I could not taste much pumpkin since the spices take over the beer. I definitely did not taste any flavor of vanilla. I prefer some vanilla taste with my pumpkin beers."
""
""
"Beer pours a clear copper-brown with a thin white head. The aroma on this beer is phenonmenal - it smells like pumpkin pie in the absolute best way with a fantastic mix of pumpkin, brown sugar and spices. Like my experience with most pumpkin beers, the flavor isn't quite as good as the smell. The flavor is primarily pumpkin pie spices and brown sugar and the pumpkin flavor itself is a little buried in the mix. This is one of the better-tasting pumpkin beers out there in that it avoids being too sweet but still brings a pretty accurate pumpkin pie flavors. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied and maybe a little on the thin side without enough carbonation. I'm not the biggest pumpkin beer fan, but this is one of the better ones. It's great in small doses, but I don't want to drink more than one in any sitting."

"O - If it's a liquid dessert you're looking for, look no further than Schlafly Pumpkin Ale; it might as well be liquified pumpkin pie. Heavier than the normal pumpkin beer, it's got an understated kick with a finish that pulls you right back in. This is one fall treat that is not to be missed!"
""
"Overall: My favorite pumpkin beer. Really drinkable, not too sweet, and great flavors."
"O - An excellent affordable pumpkin ale. Stands up to those bombers pretty well and packs plenty of flavor to just keep sipping."
""
""
""
""
""

"Hands down the best pumpkin ale around. However the taste is very very sweet. Its like drinking a pumpkin pie. The downfall is that its nearly impossible to find because liquor stores only receive 1 case per store here due to its limit of tanks on their brewing facility. The nutmeg and spices are very distinct compared to any other Oktoberfest. Women love this drink as well. Schlafly outdid their-selves on this 1 of kind pumpkin beer. Wish it was around all year round."
"The beer was really good. I likes everything about it except, I'm trying to find one with a thicker mouth feel. This has been my first review. If you have the time please let me know how it is and what , if anything I should do different. Thanks!"
""
""
"Probably the best pumpkin beer that my wife and I have found. It was a nice rich copper color with an off-white head. Smelled heavily of pumpkin and a subtle spiciness. The pumpkin flavor was not overpowering but definitely let you know you had a pumpkin beer. I say this because many call there beers """pumpkin x""" but very few achieve the taste imo. This beer should be at the top of any seasonal pumpkin lover's list."
"Overall: I loved the nose on this one, but the flavour and mouthfeel were rather disappointing."
""
""
""
"O - This is one of the best pumpkin beers I have had. I am still searching for that perfect pumpkin that doesn't overdo it on the spices and has a rich, thick feel. This one comes pretty close. I was pleased to get this as an extra in a trade and I will probably seek it out next fall."
""
""
""
"Excellent mouthfeel and very full bodied. This is an excellent sweet drinkable pumpkin ale that really delivers in smell taste and all of the above."
""
"O- This is a go to pumpkin beer. I had heard its as good as Pumpking but I dont think it's quite there. This is a great representation of the style."
"I shall certainly try this title again."
""
""
"Poured out as a really nice looking clear burnt orange color. The head was white but it came and went rather quickly not leaving any lacing at all behind. The smell of the beer is really nice, it's got a good balance of sweet malt with spice notes. The taste of the beer is impressive, it's sweet with a light toasted note and the spices come in and make this beer an exceptional autumn experience. The mouthfeel is decent, it's carbonated and medium bodied, not too bad. Overall it's a very good Pumpkin Ale. very glad I got to try this one."
""
""
""
"O- this is my leader of the pack so far. Awesome beer."
""
""
"Overall - I'm spoiled by Good Gourd. This isn't a spice bomb, but it still doesn't let the pumpkin shine the way I want. I do appreciate that it isn't boozy as hell like Good Gourd, though."
""
"O: The alcohol in this beer is well hidden making this beer very easy to drink. There are very good flavors of pumpkin and pumpkin pie spices are well balanced. Definitely a great example for the style and one I will have again."
""

""
""
""
""
"Overall: I am going directly to the store and picking up a six pack of this for thanksgiving dinner, amazing, amazing beer!! If you like pumpkin pie, TRY THIS BEER"
""
""
""
"Overall - Excellent beer. On the sweet side, but it compliments the cinnamon, pumpkin, and butter flavors that dominate the taste. My only complaint is there's a little too much booze taste, this is an 8.0% beer and it shows. I still highly recommend it for anyone who loves warm, comforting fall flavors."
"Overall- Outstanding! Perhaps the best pumpkin ale I've ever had"
""
""
"This may be my favorite pumpkin ale out there. Smell and taste are great!"

"Medium bodied with modest carbonation. Smooth and easy to drink. Very nicely made. If I could get this more easily, I would drink it all the time."
"Never have I smelled a beer and been taken back to my childhood, but this is the exception. My mother would make pumpkin bread at this time of the year but one whiff of Schaflys and I was back in the 70's. the label states it is brewed with pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg and clove and its evident in scent and taste. Solely my opinion but this is easily the best pumpkin ale I've ever tasted. The biggest draw is that my wife has now decided to experiment with craft brews because of the ale!"
""
""
"Overall, this is a winner. I'm happy to have five more to ring in my favorite season."
""
""

"A great ale for the season. Really tasty, warming, fantastic smelling. Not hugely familiar with pumpkin ales, but I definitely like this one."
"O-Need to do a blind tasting of this and Pumking. Both are amazing and the class of the field."
""
""
"Down Side: After searching for this beer for a long time and finally tracking it down this year, I was hoping that (like Thoreau) it would be transcendental. It was not quite that, but it certainly is a solid effort at brewing a fall classic."
""
""
"O. A near perfect pumpkin ale. For me, it's between this and Alewerks Pumpkin Ale for the best in the land. Schlafly is more spice forward. Alewerks is more malt forward. Both are delicious. The disappointing thing, however, is that my distributor tells me this is it for NoVA/DC for Schlafly Pumpkin for the rest of the year. How is this possible?!? Hey Schlafly, people actually like to drink Pumpkin Ales on Halloween which is in late October. Heck, a lot of people like them through Thanksgiving. Disappointing that Schlafly has caved to seasonal creep that they are ceasing their Pumpkin in late September, but whatever. I've got two more six-packs of this baby and they will be enjoyed through the fall. Fantastic beer."
"O: fantastic beer, right up there with Good Gourd for the best pumpkin ale I have had. Thanks to Treebs for giving me this one as an extra! It's like pumpkin pie in a bottle."
""
"Deep amber/red in body with off-white head that fades to a film over top. Sweet aroma of pumpkin sweets, cinnamon, carrot cake, and light booze in the background. Light flavors of pumpkin treats, cinnamon, hazelnut, minor grass notes, light booze but not warming. Too light in body for the flavors here and light carbonation. A bit too watery for my preference."
""
""
""
""
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. Overall it is a well blended and nice take on the style. The spices here are really restrained and come out with just enough character to solidify it in the style. The touch of perfume edge that creeps out distracts just a bit along with the veggie edge that keeps this from being perfect in my opinion. Overall, it is solid and absolutely worth a try."
""
""
"Overall: Really nice pumpkin beer! Definately one of the better pumpkin beers that I have drank this year! This is a fantastic chioce for a fall beer!"
""
""
"Taste is tangy and heavy on the spice. This is very malty (think a brown ale), with all the spice and pumpkin touches bringing some balance to the sweetness. A superlative Fall seasonal, and among my favorite pumpkin ales."
""
"Overall, definitely a good pumpkin beer but still does not win out over ST pumkin and chelsea pumpkin pie."
""
"Overall: I think it's obvious what I feel about this beer - spectacular. I enjoy Pumking when I want an overpowering pumpkin beer but this one is just the best well rounded pumpkin ale ever. You know you're drinking a beer but spiced up pumpkin style! Awesome ale!"
"Overall: As ready as I was for a good seasonal ale, I was still pleasantly surprised by this selection. The brewer has done an excellent job bringing out robust pumpkin flavor without crafting something overpowering or too bitter. I'm glad I purchased this in a 6-pack and might well be back for more."
""
""
"WOW! What a great pumpkin ale! The overall appearance is a toasted orange color with about an 1/2""" head. Smelled of pumpkin spice and nutmeg with maybe a hint of all spice. The flavor was perfect. Not artificial tasting like some other pumpkin beers I have had. It was delicately balanced for a robust and very enjoyable beer."
""

"O: overall this is a great pumpkin ale"

"God damn this is good."

"O: very good pumpkin ale, definitely in the top 3 I have ever had."
"Drinkability: Solid. Having never drank an entire bottle of pumpkin ale before, I was a little skeptical whether or not I could handle a whole sixer â€” or even another bottle. But I am easily tempted to open another one of these."
""
""
"What separates the Schlafly pumpkin ale is its balance. The spices are there but not overwhelming; the alcohol is high but doesn't make the beer too sweet. Essentially, I would be excited to drink this on many an occasion, and that cannot be said for many pumpkin ales."
""
""
""
""
""
"o: an excellent pumpkin ale. really delivers on a range of flavors and doesn't come across as a light spice beer as some pumpkin ales tend to. i think Pumking is still king for me, but this is excellent."
"This is by far the best pumpkin ale I've had to date. It has a nice cinnamon start with pumpkin throughout. The head is OK...can't say that it was thrilling but ok. The taste was incredible, though. It is literally like eating a piece of pumpkin pie."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Flavor profile is spicy and marginally sweet. Lots of clove and nutmeg. Alcohol imparts a boozy tingle on my tongue and massages my throat as it descends. An excellent brew overall; one of the better pumpkin beers available in America."
"O: Finally, a good pumpkin beer. Itâ€™s not perfect, but itâ€™s the best Iâ€™ve had so far; great pumpkin taste, and an even better nose. Glad I got a six-pack, and I may just buy another."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: awesome! one of the best pumpkin beers there is, get one if you can."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Wow! This beer is like pumpkin pie in a bottle. So fresh and flavorful, it definitely replaces anything pumpkin that I'd want to eat. The appearance (reddish-caramel) and mouthfeel are both average, but the smell and taste are out of this world! There's a definite cinnamon/vanilla/caramel/nutmeg aroma that comes through as it warms. The taste is pumpkin-y, vanilla, bread-y, with a well-balanced tart and sweetness. I could have this beer again and again, and think it's easily the best pumpkin beer I've tried."
""
""

"Pretty good offering by Schlafly. In fact one of the first pumpkin beers that wasn't a drain poor for me."

"O - â™« This is halloween, everybody make a scene â™« Superior to prior vintages, which is saying a lot. The definitive pumpkin beer."
"Rich creamy mouthfeel. Light effervescence. Pumpkin pie in a bottle. Big and rich yet remains refreshing on the spicy finish. Well blended. Simple put, one of the best pumpkin beers i've ever had. Genuinely tastes like a cool slice of pumpkin pie! I love it. Oh and also, for that 8% alcohol, you can't detect a thing."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - really well done pumpkin ale. Not cloyingly sweet or overly spiced. Just rich pumpkin flavor with a balanced spice. Easily top 3 on my list of pumpkin beers. Seek this one out if you have any interest in this category. Really well done."
""
"O: so in all honesty, this is one of the best well balanced beers I have ever had. The brew isnâ€™t complex, but the components make up this beer sit in perfect proportions. This is THE best fall seasonal brew hands down in my opinion. ST Pumpking doesnâ€™t stand a chance against this one and neither does DFH Punkin. As previously stated, Iâ€™m not a huge fan of pumpkin beers, but everyone kept recommending this one to me. And now I see why."

"Overall: Nice pumpkin ale, a little on the strong side, the is probably a one per sitting beer."
""

"Best Pumpkin Ale I've ever had. Would never guess it's alcohol content would be that high based on it's taste. Mildly spicy, smooth taste. A beer you can drink one after the other without getting tired of it. Not too sweet either. Need to try others from Schlafly."
""
""
""

"O: Maybe this bottle is too old? (bottled 2011 fall)... not sure... but it tasted very flat to me... Not a huge fan of this beer."

"This beer pours with a nice looking light tan head that recedes to just about nothing very quickly. Leaves no lacing. It is a very attractive dark orange color though which I do like. Aroma is heavily spiced, cloves, cinnamon, and a bit of nutmeg. It also has a nice biscuity note which sort of makes me think of pie crust in this context. Very nice and well done. Taste does not quite live up. It has a lot of the same spices, but the cloves take over a bit for me. It also does not have the same biscuit notes which I really enjoy. Mouthfeel is medium to medium heavy, nice but could use a more creamy carbonation instead of the sharp carbonation it has now."
""
"Overall, a good example of the style, but slightly disappointing. I think this is rated a bit too high. Maybe this should be rated on the backside of the top 10 in style, but not the upper tier. This beer is solid, but by no means The Great Pumpkin, Good Gourd, or even Pumking level."
"O - Easily one of the top Pumpkin Ales out there, this deserves any and all praise it gets. If this had a wider distribution it'd easily knock Punkin Ale off it's throne."
"O- Best pumpkin ale I've had. Blows Pumking away."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - As far as Pumpkin Ales go, this one is quite nice. The rare times I'm in the mood for this type of beer, I'd drink one of these."
""
"All in all, it is the best pumpkin beer I have had, and I like the cognac similarities, it won't exactly warm you up after one drink, but it is an autumn beer not a winter draft. Its not as strong as an icen-bier or thick and complex enough to age particularly well."
""
""
""
"Found this at the local Caseyâ€™s General Store; very surprised. Copper/orange pour with a big head. Smell of nutmeg, cinnamon, malts, vanilla, cloves. Nice pumpkin pie flavor, why not call it pumpkin pie beer instead of pumpkin? Anyway, flavorful and smooth. I was surprised by this beer, very enjoyable."
"O: this is truly liquid pumpkin pie, this is undoubtedly atop my list of favorite pumpkin ales. seems to be very well balanced; not too sweet, not too spicy, and it has a good amount of fleshy pumpkin."

"Bright orange golden hue. Solid finger or more of white head. Aroma is straight up pumpkin pie. Right down to the whipped cream on top. I can even smell the crust. The flavor is similar to the nose if only a bit less intense. Pie spices and a touch of heat from the alcohol. Medium creamy body. Very nice pumpkin ale. wish this was available locally."

"overall, a very nice pumpkin ale, prolly my new second favorite, pumking being the fav here. has a very nice gingerbread crust thing going on, similar to pumking. id definatly seek this out again if it were available to me."
"Probably the last pumpkin ale I'll have this year, and what a note to go out on. The praise for this beer is warranted - I'm not sure there's a better exemplar of the style."
""
"O - Like I said, this one needs a little warmth before drinking it...cold, it wasn't the greatest...but after warming it became pleasant...an overall decent pumpkin ale that was probably my last one of the season"
""
""
""
"Nice imperial pumpkin."
""
"Overall: I have had this beer style many times before, and I have not had another pumpkin ale that even approaches this one in terms of quality, balance, and taste. Despite being an imperial ale, it does not have the alcohol taste that usually accompanies such a distinction, and although the spices are pronounced, they are not overpowering nor the only character of this beer."

"This has to be the best pumpkin beer Iâ€™ve had to date. Itâ€™s like Schlaflyâ€™s brewers found a way to perfect the pumpkin beer. Itâ€™s sweet, but not too sweet. Itâ€™s smooth, but not so smooth that you are going to drink an entire bottle and not realize that you just finished 12 ounces in record time. This is a pumpkin beer that in the fall, I would go out of my way to find. I could see friends and myself sitting around at a Halloween party or backyard bonfire drinking these."

"Descent pumpkin beer. Pretty spice forward. Good if you are into this type of thing."

"This is it! All I could ever want in a pumpkin beer! The spice and pumpkin are strong yet perfectly balanced. I picked up a nice bready note in the middle too. Everything in the aroma is in the taste. Schlafly held nothing back in this brew and I'm loving it! While I do love this beer it's not something I could drink a six of in one night which isn't really a bad thing to me. Get this if you can!"

"The body was medium and the carbonation was full enough. I wouldn't drink this one (or any pumpkin ale) all night but it is a nice fall beer."
"Color is ehhh. Not very exciting at all. No head, no lacing, ehh in color. Smell is of slight pumpkin, just pumkin, no spice. The taste matches the smell, pumpkin. Slight sweetness with not any other flavors able to be picked out. I like it, wife hates it. I apppreciate it as just a pumpkin beer, she wanted more of a pumpkin pie taste to it. The mothfeel is easy to drink, this beer seems a bit thin to me, which could help out the mouthfeel. Decent beer, pumpkinn beers are not my favorite, so wont add to wants, but would suggest it to people who do not prefer spicey pumpkin beers."
"O: This is a well-rounded pumpkin ale. You definitely get that vegetal gourd/pumpkin flavor and mouthfeel which I enjoy...and the spices aren't overpowering...they are proportionate to the actual pumpkin qualities. I think it's just a touch too thin and I could have done without that lingering astringency at the end. But overall, a very cohesive example of a pumpkin ale."
"Of the pumpkin ales I've had, this is a near-perfect blend of pie spices and sweetness. Would be an excellent dessert beer for the fall months. Wish I had readily available access to it, definitely one to keep an eye out for in the fall."
"O -- Great representation of a pumpkin ale, even if it is not my favorite. It's very easy to see why many people have this ranked at or near the top of their pumpkin ale list."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Poured a very nice deep burnt and rusty orange with some very nice initial head and a fair bit of lacing throughout. Excellent deep scent, huge sweet malts and a slight vegetable aroma, with nice (and not overwhelming!) pumpkin spices. Very nice flavors, with a great pumpkin spice taste (nutmeg and cinnamon) without going overboard, a nice malty sweetness, and an interesting floral/earthy/vegetable tang to it. Went down fairly well, a bit thick, but not bad; no notice of high ABV, either, so be careful!"
"Overall- What a great pumpkin ale. I prefer pumpkins that can get that sweet pumpkin pie flavor into the bottle, and this one does a fantastic job."
"D: This is way too sweet for my tastes, and one of the sweetest of the style that I've ever had. Â I lived in Kansas City a few years ago and LOVED this. Â I have been waiting to try this again since I moved, but this was a major let down. Â Overly spicy and too sweet. Â It was good once upon a time, but this is disappointing. Â "
"O - I really, really like this pumpkin. Actually, it's probably my new favorite. I don't like Pumking - I am not really into the overly sweet pumpkin pie beers, and much more a fan of the spicy flavors. This beer delivers with plenty of cinnamon, but doesn't back off of the sweetness. It's got the best of both worlds, and even though I am not huge on the sweetness, it fits in here very well."
"O: I enjoyed this pumpkin beer more than most I've tried this year."
"O - A good pumpkin brew with a lot of clove. A little too much for me."
"O: The best pumpkin ale I've had. I try as many of this style as I can get my hands on, but this is probably the only one that I'd truly describe as """pumpkin pie in a bottle.""" Absolutely amazing beer."
"O: These sweet styles are not my thing, but I believe a fan would really enjoy this one."
"Overall meh, too much pumpkin, way too syrupy and sweet, spices on the high end as well, just over the top. It would actually be much better as a slow sipper with Thanksgiving dinner or desert."
"Pumking is certainly the heavy hitter of the pumpkin ales, but in terms of pleasant balance, abundant flavor, and drinkability, this has to be my hands down favorite. Not to mention it's $8-9 a six pack..."
"12 ounce bottle, bottled on 10/7/2011. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours an orange/copper color with about an inch off-white head. The head retention and lacing are both decent. The aroma is very sweet and spicy, it smells like nutmeg, cinnamon, pumpkins, and brown sugar. The taste is just like the aroma, it's all pumpkin spices and pumpkin. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a little creamy and slick with moderate carbonation. The 8% ABV is well hidden. This is one of if not the best pumpkin ales I've ever had. $10.49 for a 6 pack of this is a great deal! It's too bad I have to go out of state to get this brew, because if Schlafly ever started distributing to Ohio I'd buy this whenever it showed up at the stores. If you like pumpkin ales, this is definitely one to get!"
"O â€“ I never seek out Pumpkin beers, because I donâ€™t love the style, but this is the best I have even had. For those people looking for Southern Tier Pumking, pass look for this!"
"O - I was really hoping for more of this beer after all the great reviews. Maybe I had built up in my mind what I thought it would taste like and when it didn't, I was disappointed. Overall, I just wasn't feeling the intense spice profile in this beer. I'll probably seek it out one more time to give it another go."
"The beer pours out a deep orange/brown in color with a rocky head which dissipates into brilliant lacing on the glass. The aroma off this beer is tremendous - with a strong (but not off-putting) pop of cinnamon and low notes of the pumpkin squash and nutmeg. The taste of the beer is of pumpkin pie up front, but it finishes with a dry pumpkin spice characteristic. Schlafly has dialed back a bit of the clove over the past two years and, for me, it's left a great smelling and tasting beer that really showcases the pumpkin and cinnamon spice. You wouldn't know it from the taste, but remember this is an 8% beer. Schlafly offers a boldness and spice worth seeking out."
"Overall: It's my go to pumpkin beer. This is a must have."
"As a one bottle snack though at this time of year. Two thumbs up and I definitely recommend it."
"Outstanding."
"O- I had very high expectations for this beer and I feel like that hurt it in my perception. Had I come in with no expectations I may have liked this a little more. The alcohol also made it tough to finish"
"One of my favorite pumpkin ales, so probably fitting for my first review."
"O- One of my top three pumpkin beers, for sure. The pumpkin pie concept is executed well without being too sweet or overbearing. Once again, great smoothness considering the higher alcohol content. If you don't like Smashed Pumpkin (Shipyard) or Pumking (Southern Tier) because they're too intense, you probably wanna give this one a try."
"Poured into a pint glass. A typical cream-colored head sits atop this but soon dissipates to nothing but a ring of cream bubbles around the edge. No lacing whatsoever. The color of the beer is a deep rich mahogany, it's darker color tells me what is in store. Mouth feel is perfect for the style, it's not light at all, its got just enough carbonation and is worth taking your time on. The taste is exceptional. This is easily the best Pumpkin Ale I have had. It's hearty, strong, and tasty. There is less """spice""" presence and more pumpkin. It tastes like a pumpkin ale, and not a spiced ale, as almost every other brewery out there produces. I almost hate saying this, but yes, it tastes more like pumpkin pie than anything else I've had. Be careful here. This beer is good, and the high ABV can sneak up on you. Highly recommended."
"O: excellent fall beer, one of my favorites for the season"
"O: What promised from its pour and scent to be a wonderful ale left me a bit disappointed. I think they should have eased off on the spices a little, and they could have had a scrumptious seasonal ale."
"Overall- If you can't tell from my excessive gushing above, I LOVE this beer. Truly the top of it's style for me... so far."
"Pretty well balanced on the spices, but lacking a little oomph overall and the mouthfeel is a bit thin. Still a good pumpkin ale, but I've had better."
"O- really nice pumpkin beer. Taste, scent and aopearanfe are great. I want more of this."
"O: Pumpkin beers aren't something I normally seek out, but this is a really well crafted, enjoyable beer. I'll drink it again."
"Overall, this was great. With constantly being let down by fall release pumpkin beers, this one shines through. I think I would still tip my hat to pumpking even though it's pretty sweet, but this was still a really enjoyable example of the style. whoa! just noticed this was 8.0% ABV!? nicely done schlafly! your overall just went up 0.5 :)"
"If you like the style, this is worth seeking for sure."
"O - Like a slice of pumpkin pie. My favorite kind of pie. Damn you Schlafly for not distributing in Ohio."
"O- Titosupertramp gave me one of these. I may have to buy a 6er. I am not a huge pumpkin beer fan, but this keeps the flavors subdued, yet still very pleasant. I think this has supplanted DFH Punkin as my favorite of the style to date."
"Notes: Slightly with more spice than my preferred point for the style and yet it felt like a charm, the malty sweetness balances very well the character and provides quite a memorable pumpkin experience. Well worth the try if one is into the style. Thanks Joon for the recommendation!"
"O: This and Pumking are the two top dogs in my book. This was a great representation of the style."
"poured awesome off the tap with good head on the beer and has a dark body. tons of spice in the smell but then its seems lighter than pumpkin pie. the pumpkin pie is huge in the taste and is nice and strong. sweet but pumpkin pie all the way through! about to buy another 6 pack to save in my fridge for the family."
"Cheers!!"
"Taste also just like a heartier not super sweet pumpkin pie. Gingerbread, orange peel, cinnamon snap, some hop esters, and a soapy pub feel over the palate. A very nice balanced brew. Too many pumpkin beers are too sweet or super clove-y, this is not. Nice and a winner."
"Not being a friend of pumpkin beers, this would be the one I would buy again. Great job!"
"First, I must say that this beer smells delicious. It is probably because it has so many of my favorite things: cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg. This is what I imagine a pumpkin pie beer to smell like. It pours quite dark copper color and not much head. When held up to the light, it has a beautiful vibrant dark red color. I was shocked to find it to be 8% ABV (the spices hid that so well). The carbonation on the beer was adequate and it had a lingering effect on the taste buds that I can appreciate. Overall, I am very happy with how the beer smells and tastes, but the look is nothing outstanding. Compared to other pumpkin beers, this is among my favorites so far."
"O- One of my favorites and have so far bought 7 six packs for either consumption or sending to family in Ohio. Will always come back to this as a style and season favorite. Touche Schlafly, touche!"
"Overall, this is a well-constructed version of a pumpkin beer. The 8% ABV is not noticeable in the aroma nor the flavor, but you can feel it."
"O- This is a great pumpkin beer that is not too sweet and the 8% ABV is hidden very well. I will definitely be picking more up soon!"
"Overall - Still not my favorite pumpkin beer, but it is decent. I feel that I have to grade it as a specialty/novelty brew, and as such, it does do fairly well. But, to repeat myself, the spice is the issue here. This could be a great pumpkin brew, with a hefty portion of pumpkin rind and that toasted pumpkin seed quality balanced with the malt. The pumpkin pie angle just gives it too much winter spice for me to thoroughly enjoy, for what it is."
"This was a surprisingly good beer. The pumpkin flavor isn't over the top, or too thin, and the volume of the alcohol is just right."
"O: This is an artfully crafted Pumpkin Ale and definitely one of the best of the season. Beautiful ruby red color, delightfully candy-esque, light on the spices, excellent mouthfeel and damn refreshing! The 8% ABV is non-existent."
"O: fantastic beer, one of my favorites of the style!"
"Overall, this is an excellent pumpkin ale. The flavors are very complex and well rounded. The spice doesn't dominate, neither does the pumpkin. However, the flavor is bold, just what I would look for in a pumpkin ale."
"O: A good beer that I'm only knocking down a notch for the almost sickeningly sweet aroma that almost scared me away. I could not drink more than two of these because that pumpkin pie spice wears out the palate eventually."
"Way too sweet, although flavors were there. I guess people like their pumpkin beers really sweet (Pumpking). Not for me."
"See, in lieu of beeriness by way of hops or malt, the new tack is to try and evoke beeriness from alcohol. That works, but the alcohol in the back end of this beer doesn't give off any yeast complexities. It just burns. The burn is pleasant, and against the pumpkin and spice nodes it's like you're biting into hot pie, but it's not quite my imaginary ideal."
"O - Overall, I really enjoyed this one, definitely one of the better pumpkin ales out there."
"O: Good pumpkin beer, but perhaps a touch too...bland. The 8% is absolutely undectable, and the beer is very drinkable, but it's not quite pumpkinish to make it memorable. I probably won't be buying another this autumn. Still, recommended."
"O: A good pumpkin beer that tastes nice without bashing you over the head pumpkin. I'd have another. If only the mouthfeel were better this beer would have the oomph it needs to go with the nice flavors."
"Exceptional brew. Well-balanced and delicious take on the style. Would definitely drink again."
"O: this is quite pumpkin foward. I can't recall a beer I have had previously with so much pumpkin/vegetable flavor. I like how the spices were played here, would almost like to throw a dollop of whipped cream in here."
"O- It's a little high in alcohol but it's hidden well. I wish I could buy a case for year round enjoyment from time to time. Going to try and make my six pack last... but probably won't be able to"
"Great for these early fall nights - just fits the weather and the mood. Best pumpkin I've had."
"Notes: Great pumpkin beer, probably the best one I've had as of yet. Actual pumpkin flavor is wonderful compared to pumpkin meaning pumpkin pie. The mix between spices and brown sugar, buttery sweetness is great. Very enjoyable and I'll probably have to get some more. Recommended."
"Overall: One HECK of a pumpkin ale. Very well balanced sweetness, while the spices are prominent and exhibit complexity. One of the best, if not THE best pumpkin ale I've tried."
"an excellent pumpkin ale here. amazing spices. the only thing hurting its drinkability is the booze on this."
"Pours a deep amber color with a quick fading off white color that leaves little retention. Smell is bursting with spices including nutmeg and cinnamon. Plenty of pumpkin and malts as well. Really good smelling beer. Taste is amazing. Complex with spices but a nice pumpkin finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Overall this is one of my favorite pumpkin beers. Not extremely session able but 1 or 2 is quite enjoyable."
"Overall this is an above average PA and I would buy this again above some of the others I've had as of late."
"The pumpkin ales arenâ€™t my go to beers by any stretch, but I recall this one being a nice sipper and a change for the norm. Instead I have to say Southern Tierâ€™s pumking was far far better this year. I feel like the malt is just not there and the spices are a touch stronger than in the past and with these beers those two elements have to be just right or the whole things falls apart. I wonder if this is a result of this beer being a touch inconsistent and me just getting a batch that didnâ€™t get it right. That said still a good example of the style. If you enjoy these flavors it is great. If however you want the beer to meld together, I feel that something went a touch wrong with this bottle and maybe this yearâ€™s batch is just a hair off. Stick with Pumking for your seasonal this year!"
"Taste and mouthfeel has a very well balance with a kick. This is a very nice treat in the fall. Good with desserts or just sitting watching football games. This to me is best pumpkin ale on the market. Cheers!"
"Pumpkin pie in a bottle. Honestly, the flavors are closer to a mixed drink or soda than a beer but for the style, it works. One of the must try pumpkin ales, pick it up if you can."
"O - This is one of the best beers I have tasted. Perhaps it's the feeling of fall creeping in and biasing my opinion. Maybe I am simply a pumpkin fan. Regardless, this is a beer I would not pass up if given the opportunity to consume. It's an instant classic that is sure to make anyone smile - even my Coors drinking relatives!"
"O - My favorite Pumpkin Ale...not just because I'm a StL homer."
"Very drinkable yet potent. Be careful this Fall with this one. At 8 %, It can catch up to you quickly. One of the best Pumpkin Ales I have had this year..."
"O: this is a well crafted pumpkin brew. The spices are assertive, but they match the big time malt bill nicely which seems to balance everything out. The end result is a highly drinkable and flavorful (and dangerous) beer perfect for Fall."
"A pretty solid beer as far as pumpkins go."
"O - Excellent beer for the style that encompasses a great ratio of dry/bitter pumpkin to spices to balance it out."
"Overall this is one of the better pumpkin brews I've come across, but not in the top for me. It is too heavy and thick on the palate. I am not sure exactly which aspect of this beer is not jelling for me, but I would definitely prefer a Weyerbacher Imperial Pumpkin to this any day of the week."
"Even though this is 8%, you can hardly tell. Could make a great desert on its own. Best pumpkin beer I have ever had."
"O: This beer is very easy to drink and has no traces whatsoever of alcohol. The taste has a very good balance between pumpkins and spices but much more pumpkin flavors compared to other beers in the style."
"Smooth, nutty, complex, and real (not artificial). Kind of on spicy side, but the fact that this is not as sweet as Pumking makes the spicy character more bearable. Easy drinking when cold and full of flavor. As it warms, it can get a little hot. Aroma could be better, but it has an attractive appearance, along with a great mouthfeel and flavor. You really taste the roasted pumpkin and roasted butternut squash. If there was any pumpkin beer that I would want to replicate at home, it would be this or Elysian's Great Pumpkin."
"Overall Impression- While this is one of my top 5 brews of all time, I just can't get enough of this one! It represents the Pumpkin Ale style PERFECTLY in everyway possible. I had to pop one of these before sending off over 48 brews to people all over the States. I recommend you trying this as well (have problems getting it, let me know! I'll be glad to make a trade for this)."
"Pours a clear mahogany body with two fingers of tan head that settle down to a slight collar without lacing the glass. Aromas are predominantly of toasty malts and pumpkin, with spices present but kept in check [I usually can't stand pumpkin ales with lots of spice]. Fascinating flavors. Big and chewy malts like molasses and brown sugar, with plenty of toastiness and pumpkin goodness. The spicy notes are stronger on the palate than the nose. Tastes like an extremely sweet pumpkin pie with a well-browned crust. Usually pumpkin ales that are this literal annoy me, but this beer has a hefty body and an emphasis on malt complexity that other members of its style lack. The 8% abv will be welcomed as the fall temperatures set in. Good stuff."
"O - so far the best pumpkin ale I've had...I think I said that about Smuttynose last year (which was very similar IIRC), but this one is better and is just about perfect in my book. I'm sad I only have 4 left of these, because I would love to drink these regularly and not have to ration them."
"Overall: I've been looking forward to this beer for months and was waiting for the right feel to break one open. Now that fall weather is here, this will be stocked in my fridge until I feel the need to switch to a winter warmer."
"One of the better pumpkin beers on the market, it actually doesn't get much better, Cheers!"
"Pours a beautiful orange color. The nose is awesome. Makes you jump back and go """woah""". Smells like pumpkin pie, spicy, a bit of cinnamon, very nice. Tastes like pumpkin pie. No sign of the ABV. Nice spice. Mouthfeel is medium to light with a decent amount of carbonation. This is a really good pumpkin ale. My first of the season this year. Glad they produced this. I recommend trying this if it is in your area."
"I've only tried a few pumpkin beers and all of them have been at beer tastings. They were okay, but the flavors were somehow out-of whack and they did not appeal to me enough to want to buy multiple servings. When I tried this one, I knew I was going to buy some. The pumpkin flavors and spices are dead-on accurate and the beer is darn tasty."
"Not bad at all-the aroma kicks ass-it smells just like liquid pumpkin pie. Unfortunately, the spice character gets a little muddled in the flavor, the alcohol comes through a little bit strong in the finish, and there's a slight astringency from the spices. Good, but not great."
"Overall - Again, I've been waiting for this beer all year, and it did NOT disappoint. If I could give this beer a higher rating than a 5 overall, I would."
"THis one is a winner."
"Overall: I've been looking forward to this beer all year, and it does not disappoint. I really enjoy pumpkin beers, and this is the best one I've found so far."
"Relatively thin in the mouthfeel. I must admit, I've never had a pumpkin beer that I've liked (or reviewed), but this one is changing my perspective. I can see this begin a regular in the fall, especially since I'm local to STL and am fortunate enough to be able to get it regularly."
"Pumpkin in the taste, remeniscent of pumpkin pie actually. Cinnamon too that rounds out the pumpkin, making for a really pleasant taste. Booze is not hidden, but rather flaunted in a way that adds to the overall spicy character. Boozy but clean aftertaste and finish. The sweetness of the pumpkin and cinnamon is delicate and complex, making for a really nice drink that is sippable but easy-going as well. Its actually a fairly straight-forward beer, but delicious nonetheless. It definitely has some good qualities for it. I'd like to try this same beer in a lighter ABV and see if the sweetness is a little more pronounced, but this works too."
"EDIT 10/10/11-- Has a fresh sixer bottled on 10/6. I noticed this time some subtle banana notes and a much thicker mouth feel. I also caught some hop bitterness that keeps the sweet from taking over. In fact, it balances it out nicely to where I'm not even concerned about it being too sweet. Drink this one as fresh as you can get it. It improved, and I have adjusted the grade accordingly."
"O: Very good pumpkin ale. My first try of this style, and I don't know if I'm going to find any better than this locally. I'll definitely be picking this up in sixers once it cools off near Halloween."
"Served on tap at the brewery in a goblet. This Pumpkin Ale poured a burt orange color, almost brown....one of the darker pumpkin ales that I have had. There was a very thin head...almost none...it was a light tan...retention was poor and almost zero lacing. The aroma was nice a strong smell of spice, nutmeg, cinnamon, and cloves are present. The taste of this ale is full bodied, has a base of caramel malt, pumpkin, sweet honey, squash and spicy cinnamon, nutmeg and clove. This is a big beer, a sipper. Decent session beer, but its not something that I could drink a six pack of in a sitting. Not my favorite Pumpkin Ale- I prefer something a bit lighter- but It was not bad. Overall slightly above average"
"o-one of the better pumpkin ales ive had in the past few years. glad i took the recommendation. its what you expect from a pumpkin ale but so well balanced that it doesnt make you think of a pumpkin pie or pumpkin candy. and the 8% is well hidden. careful with this one ;)"
"O: Falls just short of my all time favorite pumpkin ale (Weyerbacher) and thats saying a lot. This is a great overall beer that I could definitely drink a few of."
"I liked this beer more than I expected. Have always staid away from pumkin ales but I could/would drink this anytime of year."
"So so. Tastes are rotting pumpkin meat, teeth, a shit of a lot of spices, floral flowery flavors, booziness, wrapped licorice, pie crusts and hops. Smells like a pumpkin-based soda with lime and apricot and oranges. Again, sometime, then? Yessiree!!!"
"o: wish I had some turky to go with this as a midnight snack. I would rather eat this with some food as it reminds me as a casual sipper at Thanksgiving, though even on its own the flavor is tremendous here. Nice spice and while it doesn't remind me as much of pumpkin pie as it does apple pie, it gets the job done...and at 8% hits the spot without a hint of booze."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is an amber-orange color with an almost non-existent head. Nose is definitely what you might expect from a pumpkin ale, all spice with some malty caramel sweetness. Cinnamon and all spice and cloves dominate. The flavor is more of the same, almost reminds me more of apple pie than pumpkin. Initial malty caramel sweetness followed by a spicy finish. Mouthfeel is a light medium body with minimal carbonation and a drying finish. Overall a drinkable beer, some alcohol is noticeable but I would not guess it is 8%. Probably as good as a pumpkin beer can be."
"The CPJ"
"Drinkability:This one is a good easy-drinking pumpkin ale. I've had better, but I've also had much worse."
"Pours a deep reddish brown with nice cream colored head. Goes to a ring and a little floating island. The smell is rich sweet malt, clove and other pumpkin spices. Nicely blended. The taste is nice. Well integrated flavors. The sweet malt and spicing blend seamlessly. I'm not a big pumpkin beer lover but I'm into this one. Very nice mouthfeel - the body is on the lower side of medium with nice carbonation. Overall a very nice pumpkin beer."
"12oz bottle poured into a dimpled glass. One of my favorite pure pumpkin beers. Poured a slightly hazy amber/gold with a thin off white head. Great aroma with plenty of pumpkin pie spice, cinnamon and nutmeg. Medium bodied. More pumpkin pie spice in the flavor. Some malty sweetness and a little burnt sugar as it warms. Pretty drinkable for a spiced beer. Alcohol is fairly hidden. A great fall seasonal."
"Its the great pumpkin Charlie Brown."
"Drinkability: I always enjoy a good pumpkin beer and this one is definitely one of the better examples of the style. Very good and I would definitely try again if I had the chance."
"Quite good. Not quite the great pumpkin, but a tremendous effort nonetheless. Wish I hadn't gotten shut out on the great pumpkin this year."
"The flavor is really nice with the sweet pumpkin, brown sugar, and spices really integrating together quite well. I couldn't believe that the alcohol was this high when I read it after drinking this one down a bit--it's not detectable at all. Feel is nice and creamy. Medium body with good carbonation. Overall, one of the better pumpkin brews I've come across and I'm glad to try this one this season."
"One of the more substantial pumpkin offerings out there. Nice deep orange color with a decent head. Fine carbonation, minimal lacing. Aromas are faint, but pie spices and bready malt are detectable. Flavor has a bold impact, loaded with cinnamon and graham cracker crust. Sweet pumpkin undertones shine through nicely as the finish lingers with sweet pie goodness. Yum."
"I recently had a pumpkin beer tasting with 20 different beers, and this was my favorite. Pumking is good in its own way, but I really don't think it's even on the same level as this one. A real treat to drink, and the pumpkin beer by which all other pumpkin beers should be judged."
"Big thanks to billab914 for this as an extra in a past trade! Served from bottle into a Stone nonic. Poured red-orange with a minimal off-white head. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, cinnamon, cloves, spice, and graham crackers. The flavor was of sweet malt, pumpkin, cinnamon, cloves, graham crackers, and brown sugar. It had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a pretty excellent brew. Totally reminded me of pumpkin pie only not with an overwhelming hit of spices like in some of them. In other words this was a GOOD pumpkin pie. The flavor in this one was nicely balanced and quite excellent. The aroma was very nice as well and made me start to look forward to Thanksgiving this year. Not a whole lot to complain about on this one. REALLY glad I got the opportunity to try this one."
"D-This is one spot-on seasonal that has great drinkability.No indication of 8% ABV."
"This is my personal favorite in the style because of the taste. I've had others with better aroma or more drinkability, but Schlafly Pumpkin epitomizes what a pumpkin beer should taste like, and taste is the most important aspect of any beer. I wish it was carbonated a tad better or slightly less boozy - either, would make it damn near perfect."
"D: Wonderful pumpkin brew, and definitely one that i'd be willing to use as a (slightly lower-quality) replacement for Southern Tier's Pumking, since that seems to sell out all too quickly where I live."
"(D)- Its really quite a solid pumpkin beer. Great spice and flavor."
"D - A top tier Pumpkin Ale that is solid all the way around and excels in terms of appearance and taste... A great well rounded example of the style..."
"Overall, this is one of the best spiced beers I have ever tried. Would be great for thanksgiving dinner as a desert."
"Good pumpkin ale. I like the fact that you can taste the pumpkin as well as the spices. The main flaw IMO is that it is too boozy."
"This is the best pumpkin ale I've tasted so far. Highly recommended"
"I can definitely see why this beer has received so much good word of mouth. It has great pumpkin flavor without having cloying sweetness...and it isn't boozy."
"M/D: Medium bodied, nice and creamy. Good carbonation. Have had a bunch of pumpkin beers this fall, and this one is easily my favorite as of now. The 8%? Didn't know it was that high till right now, this beer is that good."
"Poured from a bottle a nice amber coppery color with a bubbly white head that receded quickly. Smell is that of cinimon clove maybe a touch of ginger. Taste is heavy on the spice very much dominated by cinimon and clove perhaps some bready malt but this is all spice. Mouthfeel is sharp and tightly carbonated. Drinkability, this a nice beer however not one I wold session but more enjoy after a meal."
"D: This didn't necessarily say """pumpkin beer""" to me. It was much more of an apple pie beer, and a good one at that."
"I've never had a Pumpkin ale, so this will be my first time. Poured into a dimpled mug. First aroma and impression I get is of cinnamon, like a cinnamon red hot. Caramel malt in the background as well. The mall fizzy head quickly disappears. First taste is ... well, there's really no other way to describe this. It's like drinking a liquid pumpkin pie, right down to the crust. Clear pumpkin flavor up front followed by nutmeg, cinnamon, and clove. Pie crust malt sweetness and powdered sugar finishes. This thing is making me crave my mom's pumpkin roll. I'm going to have to pick a lot of this up for Thanksgiving in November. Delicious."
"has a very nice smell to it.. i am impressed and happy to be able to have tried it.. thanx again smutty33 cuz i would get this if it would available in my area.. it's a nice different change that i enjoy once in a while.."
"OK, it doesn't look cool or smell special but it tastes pretty good. Beer is sweet but not cloying and it has a nice cinnamon / nutmeg spice profile on a light bodied beer. The alcohol gives it a dry finish and a sweet start, I can't decide if these are good things or a strategy to distract me from the overall nature of the beer. Not my favorite beer but a decent pumpkin ale."
"Rich pumpkin spice throughout the front and finish of this beer. A light autumn pour is about picture perfect to style. A normal low balled session beer- this ale is an 8%er- zero bite- maybe the pumpkin spice covers its booze- either way- a nice treat."
"D- This is up there. If I had to pick five pumpkin beers off the top of my head as my favorites, this is in there. I may be forgetting one, but as of this moment I like this one. I would definitely drink it again. Goes down easy enough, the opening had some prickly alcohol problems, but they went away as the beer matured pretty quickly so I felt them unnecessary to note. It isn't like other breweries openings where you want to smack them."
"A very drinkable beer. Does not taste like 8%, and each sip invites me to have another. Very impressive, and it's too bad I cannot get it when I'm in Chicago."
"A thin head after pouring this dark copper brew into my mug. The aromas come pouring out from the start. Pumpkin pie all the way....the cinnamon, nutmeg, spice and pumpkin are quite evident. The taste, like the smell, is pure pumpkin pie in a glass. Outstading flavor profile that balance nicely with the crispness of the hops at the end of your sip. The high ABV is barely noticable and the great balance of flavors make this a session a beer in my opinion. Easily my favorite pumpkin offering of the season!"
"but then again I can usually only eat just one slice of pumpkin pie too."
"Shout out to Jeff for bringing this back from St. Louis."
"This was a nice festive beer for the fall, just a little too sweet for my taste."
"Lighter body, with too much carbonation. A bit of alcohol is felt. This was a little lacking for me, but it wasn't overspiced as many are. Also, there is a good malt character here as well. Worth trying."
"Thanks to Dave P for bringing a bottle of this back from his hometown of St. Louis. It poured a hazelnut in color with a off white/khaki head. It smells very richly of cinnamon and also has a good deal of nutmeg and other spices. It also has some light roasted malt aromas. The taste is pretty spectacular. The pumpkin and cinnamon are upfront followed by the nutmeg, maltiness, and other spices. It is a little sweet but more alcoholic than most pumpkin beers. It begins smooth and finishes with a crisp tingle of carbonation. It's a very, very good pumpkin beer. It's probably put it right up there with the DFH Punkin, and light years ahead of Pumking. Excellent pumpkin beer by Schlafly!"
"Reminds you of the holidays.... very much worth looking for...."
"Picked up in KC-MO on a Giants road trip. Let sit from October through August. Would only say the taste improved in that time. Easily my favorite pumpkin, and have had well over 15 assortments. The clove would have to be Schlafly's clinching note to put this at the top. Such a mouthfeel - warm, whole and entirely perfect for winter really. Finishes long and lingers. Solid head throughout, medium amber body. Pick it up were you to find it. Can't say there's a better pumpkin..yet."
"Though not my thing really, this is a pretty excellent pumpkin beer for what its worth."
"D - Pumpkin beers get a bad wrap, but I think if people gave some of the better ones a try, things could change. I normally don't like a """pumpkin pie""" beer, but this one is well done, and will be drinking it all fall, or at least until I run out."
"Drinkability: This beer does taste really good, and it hides the alcohol extremely well. It's definitely an awesome beer to sip on during the autumn season. Potentially dangerous because I'm sure the alcohol will creep up on you pretty quickly."
"All in all an outstanding pumpkin ale. Highly recommended. SO happy that I have access to it every fall!!"
"This would make a great beer with a dessert but can't pound many of them because of the combination of the taste and alcohol content."
"Overall, I enjoyed this beer. It's a great autumn offering and one I'd drink again, but not the best thing I've ever had."
"I always have high hopes for fall seasonals, but very few live up to my expectations. Coming out of the bottle this looks and smells great, it just doesn't deliver on the flavor."
"Poured a darkish orange with decent head but no lace. A wonderful sweet aroma of caramel and nutmeg spice smell along with some spicy pepper and cinnamon as the obvious pumpkin. A thinner body than expected with a good pumpkin base for taste. Smooth and easy to drink, the sweet caramel and nutmeg spice are clearly evident but perhaps the only drawback of this beer to me is that the spices and clove are laid on a little thick and dominate the finish, giving off a slighly sour hop feel which is a drag considering the nice balance the pumpkin/sweetness and spices have up front. A very good pumpkin beer but not at the top in my opinion."
"This is a great pumpkin beer if you like the style. Full bodied with great flavor. Well done, Schlafly!"
"This is a nice balance drinkable beer with a good spice flavor but an obvious beer as well."
"And I do love pumpkins."
"The flavors and alcohol are superbly done, but a little much for the drinkability."
"Thanks to great trader birchstick for this one. A very good looking rich amber with frothy light tan head. Aroma is rich, sweet, spicy and nutty. Flavor is on the sweet side, but has great pumpkin flavor with a bunch of spice. Just like pie! Where's my cool whip? abv is well masked too."
"This would probably pair well with Thanksgiving dinner. In fact, I may save one or two for the occasion. For the most part this will fulfill expectations of a pumpkin pie-like beer without being very sweet at all."
"pint at the Galaxy Hut, Arlington, VA"
"Other - No head because of a slow pour, and also no lacing."
"d - An outstanding pumpkin ale. It looks good, has a great mouthfeel, and an amazing smell. The only knock I would have on it at all is the alcohol in the taste. Will definitely be buying more of this one."
"Schlafly has done a fine job with this ale. I can't really think of many ways they could improve it. I always miss summer around this time of year but this type of beer helps me get through it a little easier!"
"Couldn't find any of the pumpkin in here - very heavy handed on the spicy, but damn tasty. I usually HATE pumpkin spice beers, but this is solid. Don't want more than one, but luckily, all I have is one. Thanks again chubbyswans. Good ups."
"D: I could have 2, maybe three. The simple flavors over and over would be to much."
"Edit: Got ahold of a six-pack, and while the aroma isn't quite as great out of the bottle, this stuff is still really tasty. I picked up a second sixer just in case we can't get anymore around here."
"NOTE: On 11/9/10, I did a pumpkin tasting with Williamsburg Alewerks, Saranac, and this one. The Schlafly still won! I continue to be impressed with this beer."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's definitely one of the better pumpkin beers I've had. I heard it described as Pumking without the whipped cream sweetness, and that really does describe it pretty well. A very welcome addition to the fall seasonals available in my area this year."
"This is my first pumpkin beer ever and I have to say if this style offers great brews like this, I must try more!"
"D/M: The carbonation is great and it creates a nice thick head that really coats the palate. Very thick autumn brew but very drinkable for how strong it is."
"its quite fitting to be drinking this tonight when we are expecting a foot of snow here..kind of reminds me of the holidays...i am truly impressed with this beer..wish i could get more...big thanks to ricky for the bottle"
"Drinkability: I would definitely have this againn but I wouldn't seek it out unless it was regularly available. I recommend this to someone who enjoys a solid pumpkin ale with a prominent spice open and a malty and pumpkin middle and a deceptively warming aftertaste. Definitely worth the try."
"Well done Schlafly. I am glad that this bottle made the interesting trip from Fernmaster to me."
"The palate opens quite sweet with brown sugar, caramel, burnt sugar before the nutmeg and cinnamon come through, along with pumpkin and crystallized ginger. Quite like a good pumpkin pie, this tastes pretty darned good. Medium-light in body with a higher level of carbonation than it needs, the mid-palate feels a little watery. The finish, however, is good with a moderate combination of ginger, cinnamon and pumpkin. Thoroughly enjoyable, I'm thankful for the chance and will seek out in the future."
"Taste leans more towards the sugar-coated gingerbread end of the pumpkin ale spectrum. A bit sweet, but it helps balance out the spices nicely. It has a great gourdy pumpkin-ness to it that seems to be difficult to get into a beer and missing from many examples of the style. I do not find the beer to be as tasty as the nose indicates, but it is still a damn fine pumpkin ale. There is just a kiss of alcohol that is probably accentuated by the low carbonation, but does not taste like 8% at all. Good beer, but the search for the perfect pumpkin ale continues..."
"D - Very drinkable pumpkin brew. Another great brew from Schlafly. I great brew for the season's but due to the spices I know I could do only a couple. A great brew to share amongst others."
"D: Flavorful, goes down ok, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, it's a decent beer but there are better ones that I've had in the style."
"Pours a very nice clean/clear dark golden amber/brown color, nice carbonation, little fizzy off-white head, with minimal sticky lacing left behind. The nose is really nice, malty, lots of cinamon/nutmeg/spices, and a good dose of caramel. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, very nice touch of cinnamon/nutmeg/caramel. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a pretty tasty brew, glad to have had a chance to try it."
"D: Very filling. This is one or possibly 2 beers at a sitting proposition."
"D: Among the more flavorful pumpkin ales I've enjoyed. A little livlier feel and better look and this would rank among my favorites. As is, the spicing and aroma draw me in and keep me interested. One I'll want again and may go to some lengths to acquire next fall. Good job, Schlafly."
"D - Very drinkable and you cannot even notice the higher alcohol content."
"Drink: Being 8% abv you would think it would pack a tiny bit of a punch, but it doesn't. As far as I know this could be fairly sessionable. And the flavors mixed with the nice mouthfeel make a pretty drinkable seasonal ale."
"As I said earlier, this is the best of the best in pumpkin ales. Great job, Schlafly."
"Drinkability: Wonderful flavors and smells; a very filling beer and the ABV is a tad high - while it's great, I don't think I'd want more than one in a night because it sits a little heavy and you can definitely feel the 8% creeping up in the back of the head."
"taste has some pumpkin,cinnamon,overall pumpkin spice dominates though.bit of alcohol warming in the finish. medium bodied,pretty drinkably. wish this was a regular in ohio."
"D: By and far one of the best pumpkin beers that I've had. I easily had a few of these on football Sunday. Too bad Schlafly doesn't distribute here!"
"Beer is definitely drinkable. It is nicely warming in taste and in experience, and the balance of the flavors is very impressive for this style. I enjoy the full-flavoring that is also in many ways subtle. I'll definitely try to find this one along with my Pumking next year!"
"Tastes spicy and sweet. mostly spices overpower the pumpkin but it is still a strong enough malt character that makes it a well bodied spice that isn't thin and lifeless. nice balance and a good mouthfeel, could be a bit over-carbonated and cloying. drinks easy but i don't think I could bring myself to put down more than two at a time."
"M&D - smooth and easy drinking, medium bodied, and lightly carbonated, one of the better pumpkin beers i have ever had, nice introduction to a brewery for me"
"drinkability: good"
"Poured from a bottle into a plain old pint glass. Good color and robust head. Aroma seems fairly typical of pumpkin ale. All the familiar spices are present. Medium strong malt aroma with notes of caramel and toastiness. Flavor is strong and immediate of clove with a mild bitterness and malt flavor. Clove is immediate and almost overpowering in my opinion. It led to a sharp flavor on the back of my tongue and an unpleasant lingering flavor in the finish. Simply too much clove in my opinion."
"Poured into my pint glass, this beer is a clear burnt orange with a nice white head that quickly falls into a lasting ring around the glass. The aroma is of clove, spice, and nutmeg. Smells pretty tasty! Speaking of taste... the first one is like I just bit into a slice of pumpkin pie. This is nice, not fake-tasting like a lot of other pumpkin beers I've had. The mouthfeel is a little thin but the taste lingers and somehow gets better after the beer passes through my esophagus. This is definitely my favorite pumpkin beer and I can't wait to have some more this Thanksgiving."
"D: In my opinion, Pumking has met its match. Slightly heavier on the spices and less sweet, but it also is very well balanced. It does have a few flaws and is not as good once it warms up but definitely a hit in my book"
"Drinkability: Non ninny pumpkin ale. Strong but festive. Put me in the mood for some good crisp air. I wish i was around a firepit with my bros in the cold weather."
"Drinkability was very good if you enjoy this style of flavored ale. This is by far the tastiest pumkin ale I have tasted to date. Highly recommended as it met and exceeded my expectations from last years report. Hope I can get at least a few more sixes before it is gone this year!!!"
"drinkability takes a hit for the 8% abv"
"The Appearance of this beer rocks. The pour is great with three fingers of foam. The head stays for a little bit then disappears after twenty seconds or so, perfect timing in my opinion. It gives you enough time to appreciate the appearance and smell the beer properly before tilting it back. It's a nice orange reddish color with a little bit of bubbling action. Schlafly's Pumpkin Ale may have the best smell of any pumpkin beer I've ever had. All of the spices are intense, the cinnamon, nutmeg and clove work in a perplexingly good culmination of flavors and scents. I walked around my house and put the beer under my roommate's noses and then slow on the cue I'd exclaim, """Smell.""" (As if they had a choice then.) I'm beginning a new thing of wanting the scent of beers made into candles, this is one such beer. But then comes the taste. I'm torn on this one like I'm Michael Bay's plot structure. Instead of the dichotomy of racism and explosions (Bay), it's my love for pumpkin beer and this beer too much of a pumpkin. The taste hits your senses in the face like it's Chris Brown. My immediate reaction was, 'whoa I love this beer' and then I thought, 'ow.' It's just too much at once. I love pumpkin beers, but there's just too much spice action in this one - so much so that it kills my enjoyment of the beer. I cringe every time I take a drink; it's just so sweet. I'll drink my 6pack and enjoy it well enough, but I don't think I'll buy another."
"Drinks pretty easy, the ABV is well hidden, but lacks the total package of say, an Ichabod, but I would certainly grab a sixer of this during the fall every year"
"WHOA! This beer certainly caught me by surprise. I was expecting a fruity but earthy subtle tasting beer. What you get is a big flavored spicy beer that is a bit like mom's pumpkin pie (but not as sweet). I could smell the spices right away and the taste was was very spicy with lots of cinnamon, nutmeg and more going on. Interesting to try for sure but not a beer I could drink several of. I will have it again though."
"I have had many pumpkin beers and this is the best that has crossed my lips."
"Bottle to pint glass. Pours a really dark copper color with a one finger white head. The head reduces to almost no head leaving little to no lacing down the glass. The smell is what I expect, pumpkin and spices right away. More pumpkin in the smell than some other pumpkin ales I've had so right off the bat I like this one. Taste is very pumpkiny and spices are also there. Very sweet tasting, pretty much liquid pumpkin pie. Great overall. A bit higher ABV but it's not noticeable. I'd love to sit back and have a few of these if not more on a Sunday or something watching football. Overall I might have to say this is one of my favorite pumpkin ales I've had yet and not only that but probably the best beer I've had from Schlafly yet. Great stuff I love it. I'll be picking up more and stocking up for when autumn actually gets here."
"D-Easy to drink and very nice to have this time of year, easy to session."
"Pumpkin ale is a style that I associate with Sunday afternoon NFL games, and Schlafly Pumpkin is the one that I will reach for above all others. I haven't had Southern Tier's Pumking, but it will have to be very impressive for me to prefer it over Schlafly. I really enjoy the more natural pumpkin flavors from this beer."
"D- I don't know if I could drink allot of these. Maybe in the winter or fall. It creates a warming feeling when consumed as well. Could be the alcohol and ginger. I would be willing to give another try when it isn't so warm outside. This bottle apparently is a year old also, which may have affected the flavor."
"Bottle at PPRBSG09. Pours a clear orange. Aroma of sweet pumpkin pie. Some crust too, but mostly pie. Flavor of cinnamon, sweet crust, and lots of pumpkin spices. Quite good (especially considering it's out of season). One of my favorite pumpkin beers."
"A 12 ounce bottle poured into a nonic Imperial pint glass. The ale appears a hazed rich amber color with an inch of fluffy off white, lingering foam. Nose and flavor are of medium roasted pumpkin meat and toasted grain, nutmeg, allspice, cinnamon, sweet caramelized malts. About medium in both body and carbonation. Without a doubt, one of the better pumpkin ales out there. Absolutely worth your time."
"Pours a very dark amber color with no head. Smell is nutmeg and clover. Not getting all the cinnamon that was advertised, but still a decent nose. Taste is exactly the same as the nose. Taste has a acidic, bitterness taste to it. Medium body in the mouthfeel. This is a very sessionable beer, but at 8% it will definitely be felt."
"Very drinkable. Good stuff!"
"D- I really enjoyed this pumpkin ale. If you want a pumpkin ale that actually tastes like pumpkin pie this is the beer for you. That said, I'm not sure this beer is exactly a sessionable pumpkin ale at 8% abv not to mention it is a bit rich."
" That is not the case here. It poured a medium-dark red with a hint of orange. A pumpkin pie scent is apparant in the smell. Hope began to build within me. After the first sip I was won over. It tasted like pumpkin pie and beer! Any man's dream during a crisp Autumn season. And it is so drinkable for 8% abv. Something to look forward to at harvest time. Very, very, well done Schlafly."
"Overall one of the best, most drinkable pumkin ales I have come across. Not really anything bad to say here. Solid all the way around!"
"D: Very, I could pound a sixer of these. My third favorite pumpkin brew, its some tasty shit. Pure dessert in a bottle."
"Well colored me impressed, as I believe that this may well be the most robust and possibly best Pumpkin Ale that I've ever had out of the bottle. Really strong stuff here that I wish I had some more of."
"Very drinkable. I'd love to have access to this on a regular basis."
"It has a dark brown/bronze amber body. It has a good head at first but goes away fast. It has some wonderful tight lace. It has both strong aromas of pumpkin and spice. In addition it has sweet aroma but tastes even sweeter. It is slightly spice just right and not over or under done. It has the taste of fresh pumpkin. The mouthfeel is pretty fizzy. Good representation of the style."
"Very delicious and very well done..."
"d - highly drinkable. good beer but still lacks the pop that pumpking and punkin have."
"12oz bottle, bottled on 9/10/08. Served in a shaker pint. Poured a slightly hazy amber/gold with a thin off white head. Great aroma with plenty of pumpkin pie spice, cinnamon and nutmeg. Medium bodied. More pumpkin pie spice in the flavor. Some malty sweetness and a little burnt sugar as it warms. Pretty drinkable for a spiced beer. Alcohol is fairly hidden. A great fall seasonal."
"D: This is probably the 2nd or 3rd best pumpkin ale I have ever had. Pumking is the king. Then Bethlehem brewworks version and this are neck and neck. A really nice beer all around. Definately surprised me."
"This is the best pumpkin I've had."
"Drinkability is fairly high. It's a solid Pumpkin with good flavor and well hidden alcohol. A great beer to drink alone or with friends."
"D: I could seriously drink this all day long and not be sick of it. One of the few beers that I am willing to buy in 6-pack form instead of by the bottle."
"I've tried New Holland, Michelob, O'Fallon, Harvest Moon, Shipyard, and others this year and the only one that truly captured the rich pumpkin flavor one would expect from a pumpkin ale was Schlafly. This is definitely my favorite of the season even ranking above my favorite MÃ¤rzens."
"Wow! What an amazing take on beer. Since the beginning of the season (fall beers that is) I have tried Michelob's Jacks Pumpkin Spice, DFH's Punkin Ale, O'Fallon's Pumpkin Ale, and Blue Moon's Harvest Moon and with out a doubt this is the best Pumpkin Ale available. The price is phenomenal for the 8% ABV and amount of beer (DFH's Punkin Ale is $10 for 4 while this is $10 for 6). The color is a dark amber/copper hue that has a nice yet subtle translucency to it. The head is a nice beige that recedes to a thin lace around the edge of the glass. The first sip is a fusion of a good ale and a great pumpkin pie. The nutmeg, cinnamon and pumpkin dominate your mouth and challenge you to find a more delectable flavored beer. I rate the drinkability as average because of the loss of flavor with every beer. I suggest waiting between beers, possibly drinking something else, rather than pouring one after another. I cannot wait to bring a sixer of this to thanksgiving."
"edit 09/09 - oh how my tastes have changed over a year. This beer is still fantastic, but I could drink several of these in a sitting, provided I didn't have to drive afterwards. upgrading 'drinkability'"
"Pours a rather intense burnt orange color with reddish highlights in the glass. The thick collar of foam rises well above the rim and is colored a pale off-white with the slightest orange hue. Active carbonation can be seen rising from the bottom of the glassware, feeding the massive head of foam. The nose is heavily spiced - cinnamon abounds, followed by cloves, allspice, nutmeg and a pleasant, caramel malty sweetness taking up the rear. This beer is the liquid summation of the word """festive.""" The palate doesn't disappoint in this regard either. Bursting forth with aggressive spices and warm, slightly roasted malt characteristics, this is like a baked pumpkin pie in a glass. The cinnamon is the dominant spice in this one. Perhaps because the spices are so heavy in the nose and on the palate, the alcohol is scarcely detectable though this beer weighs in at 8% ABV. Once you get past the spices, a solid well-crafted amber ale is waiting to greet you - slightly sweet, roasted malts and a complimentary hop profile leave this beer tasting surprisingly balanced for such a big, spice-heavy beer. The mouth feel is medium thick, but not too much so. The carbonation level is ample enough to keep this one from being perceived as too heavy or malt rich. Nice trick. The finish is smooth and warm, with a lingering spicy note or two hanging around. All in all, this is and has been one of my favorite pumpkin ales of all time. I am a spice head, so the aggressive levels of spice found here are not a negative for me, but some may find them too intense. While I could easily drink a few of these at a sitting, the well-hidden alcohol content prohibits that notion. This is a beer I'll stock up on and have on hand through winter's chill. Perhaps I'll even squirrel away one or two bottles and see what a year or two in the cellar does to the flavor profile - at *% ABV, this one should be able to handle it okay. Now if I can just keep my hands off of it for that long."
"Regardless though, I'll be buying a few more six packs of this while it's still available."
"Good texture, great flavor. Is it 8%? I wouldn't have guessed..."
"Overall, this pumpkin beer knocked the socks off of others I have tried. This was a great seasonal offering by Schlafly and one of the stronger offerings I have tried from this brewer."
"This is easily the best pumpkin beer I've had. Sure, there isn't a great deal of deviation within the style, but this left a great impression on me. Compared to the other big pumpkin beers like Pumking and Weyerbacher's Imperial Pumpkin, this was richer in pumpkin flavor, while also being more drinklable. The taste is just a nice mix of pumpkin meat with dashes of spice and a mellow malt backbone. A must-try for pumpkin beer lovers."
"A flavorful spiced beer with complex developments from the spice, nice fall/winter warmer. Only negative for me is the mouthfeel - could provide a fuller feel. No complaints overall - well designed and flavorful beer."
"Pours a nice clear amber with a very quickly fading head. Smell is fairly big for a pumpkin. Nice aromatic pumpkin pie like spiced nose. Taste is very nicely spicy and not just spiced, but truly almost spicy at times. Easily the best pumpkin beer I've yet had. Very nice, full, rich body, and robust pumpkin flavor. Was expecting another mediocre pumpkin beer, and I got a lot more. This was absolutely delicious and I'll be looking for this in Autumns to come."
"Drinkability: I LOVE THIS! This is my favorite of the available pumpin ales in southern Illinois followed closely by O'Fallon's Pumpkin Ale. Rich flavor that isn't weak and isn't too sweet. Even at 8% ABV the alcohol taste doesn't come across. Too bad this isn't a year round beer."
"D - Outstanding. This is an amazing beer, and I'm glad that I was able to try it at the source! Fall is my favorite season, and this is just about the perfect beer for that special time of year. I'll be picking some up next fall fo' sho.'"
"Finally, a decent pumpkin ale! Appears the color of pumpkin (on the inside, not the out) with a tiny head that disappeared fairly quickly. Smelled a lot like a pumpkin pie - cinnamon, pumpkin, brown sugar, nutmeg. Taste delivered what was promised and then some. Very flavorful. Mostly cinnamon up front followed by tastes of actual pumpkin (a first for me as far as """pumpkin""" ales go). Very tasty. Pretty thin mouthfeel, which seems to be a trend in this genre. All in all, I was very pleased with this. I'd become jaded as far as finding a solid pumpkin ales go, but then this gives me hope."
"Note to Self: Ranked the #5 Pumpkin Ale when I tried it."
"Thanks to xmarcnolanx for this one. Pours burnt orange with a head that fades quickly and leaves no lacing. Smells of baked pumpkin, pumpkin pie spices, brown sugar and cream. The taste is similar, and quite sweet and spicy. One of the bolder and spicier pumpkin ales I've had this year and quite creamy as well.Liquid pumpkin pie. Very smooth and fizzy and quite sweet in the mouth. Delicious dessert."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, spiced with pumpkin bread and roasted walnuts lingering into a thin finish."
"Amber to deep golden color. Slight spiced aroma-muted cloves and ginger. Reminds me of how Harpoon Winter was before it became the spice monster that it is now. Decent malty flavor with a whisper too much spice for me but still quite good. Quite bready and biscuit like. More like ginger bread then pumpkin. Very nice body-hell I just noticed the abv no wonder. A damn good and enjoyable beer overall. Some tweaking for my personal preference is all. I wouldnt pass this up."
"Flavors of nutmeg, clove, blended in with authentic pumpkin as well. Not overly sweet or spicy. Fuller mouthfeel, somewhat dry finish due to the spice, would be nice if it were a little less dry and tacky. Easy to finish a bottle, I had several in a row when it was fresh in the bottle (2 weeks old). I'm guessing the shelf life isn't the longest, but at 8% it should last a few months, no problem."
"This is the best pumpkin beer on the market. It pours a deep glorious orange as the smell of pumpkin pie just overflows. A good moderate mouthfeel. At a nice 8% abv this isnt a great session beer, but def a great mix up during the fall season. If you are looking for a pumpkin beer, look no further."
"Schlafly Pumpkin Ale pours a deep amber orange color. I can't say I care for the smell a whole lot but it does have a fairly strong pumpkin smell. There is pumpkin taste as well, but I found it to be pretty subtle. I definitely expected more from the taste based on the smell. The mouthfeel was smooth and goes down real easy, which was the best part for me. As far as the drinkability it was a nice change, but after a couple of these I got rather sick of the taste and just wanted something different."
"Good looking copper reddish body with an off white head. Pumpkin pie aroma complete with spices. Somehow I'm not crazy about the aroma though. There is an slightly skunky off-aroma in there that doesn't tickle my fancy. The flavor is pretty sweet and has a bunch of pumpkin flavor in it. The spices are more prevalent in the flavor than the aroma. It leaves a spicy aftertaste. It's not a bad beer, but not great either."
"A pretty good beer. I'm not one for 8% beers, but this one's pretty good."
"As of today, this is my favorite pumpkin ale. I was getting tired of watered-down light beers sprinkled with pie spice. The one has some balls. Well played, Schlafly."
"Drinkability: Awesome. I really enjoyed this pumpkin ale and thinnk it could stand up to other well known ones. Very good beer to drink with this season's plenty."
"D: I didn't notice the 8% until I was almost done with one bottle a half hour later. That was enough for me, but while drinking it, the alcohol stays well hidden. Just be aware of it. But with the great flavors and smooth creaminess, I'd want to drink these all the time. Pleasantly surprized."
"Thank you Schalfly for making a worth-while Pumpkin Ale. Rarely does the world get to sample a hearty pumpkin flavor, a very well-made base beer, and spices that contribute to the beer without overpowering. This beer does all this-- doesn't seem too difficult. This beer seems to have a very firm Amber malt toastiness, sweetness, cleanliness, and crispness. The low (but detectable) hop rates make way for the pumpkin and spice variety to shine. The pumpkin delivers a creamy, earthy flavor very similar to fresh-baked pumpkin pie. Mild notes of cinnamon, nutmeg, and all-spice decorate the beer without bringing undue attention to the frills. A mild buttery flavor also brings the beer into desert-range. This is all evedent in the aromas and flavors. The body remains firm, creamy, and relatively round; allowing the flavors to settle into a mellow finish of creamy-sweet pumpkin and caramel. This is likely the best Pumpkin Ale that I have had."
"D - One of the best pumpkin ales. Certainly the best of the five that I've sampled."
"Fantastic fall beer."
"Mouthfeel is the love/hate relationship I have with pumpkin ales. I love the flavor, but I always feel they are thinner than they should be. Pumpkin pie is thick and creamy, so in my mind I want a pumpkin ale to be thick and creamy. This version probably has more body than any other pumpkin ale I've ever had, but I feel it could be creamier. Still it is very smooth and very drinkable. I would like to age this and see how the spices age in a few months."
"Mouthfeel and drinkability: Full bodied with carbonation that doesn't get in the way of the flavor of this brew. Unlike some other pumpkin ales("""cough""" Jack's pumpkin spice ale cough""") it doesn't use carbonation to cover up what it lacks in body and flavor. Rather it compliments. This is a very very drinkable beer. I would drink this all night, in fact I think that I'll soon be buying a case of this. I don't care how much it costs because it is worth it. The very best pumpkin ale I've had to date."
"D- I like this as a colder fall brew, it wasn't very cold when I had it (80's and humid) so it might of detracted from my experience. I do like this beer, but wish there was a stronger pumpkin presence."
"I know that early February isn't the most opportune time to be drinking a pumpkin ale, but I figured that an 8.0%'er would hold up well being holed up for a few months. And it has. Schlafly Pumpkin Ale is one of the best damn gourd beers that I've ever had. Thanks jpm30."
"Drinkability is good, this beer is not too spicy, the pumpkin is noticeable and tasty and the alcohol level makes this a nice colder weather beer. Easily my favorite pumpkin ale, that I've tried."
"Smells like pumpkin, with some cinammon and brown sugar and alcohol. Light Orange colour, no head. Carbonation right up there as if club soda, but pumpkin taste right there, not sweet nor bitter. A good representation of this blooming style. Thanks for the hitchhiker, jpm30."
"Lots of thanks to jpm30! Prosit MK"
"A nice golden, orange colored body with a head that didn't stick around very long. The usual smell that is associated with brews of this nature, except more profound. The spices made more of a statement than most, really setting the tone for what was to come. The flavor was fairly bold for a pumpkin ale. The nutmeg and cinnamon were present, but the meat of the pumpkin was there at the forefront, followed by a taste of alcohol in the finish, which lingered on the tongue for awhile. Medium mouthfeel and drinkable, but I couldn't handle more than two in a night. I would drink again if I come across it."
"I Love Pumpkin Ales so I was hoping that Schlafly wouldn't dissapoint. They didn't. Poured from a """Special Release""" bottle into a glass with a nice head and a beautiful """pumpkin""" color that just lets you know the best is yet to come! The smell was, well, Pumpkin Pie! With aromas that captured the smell of a fresh baked pumpkin pie like cinnamon and nutmeg. Wow, the tatse was definately like a liquified piece of pumpkin pie. I would definately reccomend this as one to try! Too bad this is only around for a short time."
"This is slightly sweet and really does make for a decent desert option. Easy enough to drink as an after dinner beer but not by any means a """session""" beer."
"Final note: oh shit, 8%?? This AINÂ’T no session brewÂ…"
"Pours a clear light amber color with a tan head of large bubbles. Nice balance of pumpkin pie spice in the nose. Nutmeg takes the lead. Taste is immediately dry and spicy. A bit overdone on the nutmeg and cinnamon. Alcohol presence is readily noticeable. Medium body. Ginger makes an appearance in the aftertaste along with more cinnamon. Maybe itÂ’s still to warm for this one. I wasnÂ’t ready for the alcohol warming just yet. Still, an ok, drinkable pumpkin ale. Thanks H-OÂ’-P!"
"This beer would be perfect right after Thanksgiving dinner. At 8%, though, it would definitely be naptime. I could see myself drinking 2 of these, probably not more than that though."
"The mouthfeel is fine and despite the 8%abv, this beer is extremly drinkable. A nice beer as the season changes in these parts. Good effort from Schlafly."
"Clear orange-amber. A sizzling, quick building head of loose packed off-white bubbles of mixed sizes. Settles at a constant pace to a thin skim coat with a short collar and leaving no lacing. A single jetting carbonation stream rises. Aromas of liquefied pumpkin pie abound- cinnamon, nutmeg, a touch of cloves and a bit of crust malt. The label reads that ginger is included and there perhaps just a hint of its zing. Up front is some malt that is reminiscent of baked crust followed by rich pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg and a warming alcohol note. It is almost as if I am eating a piece of pie backwards, starting with the crust and ending with the point, the best part. The finish is cinnamon and a touch of spicy ginger. This is a nice medium-full bodied beer with a warming alcohol edge. Smooth, rich, and creamy like a piece of homemade pie. Nice overall and definitely on the maltier/richer side balanced with plenty of spices. Schlafly did this one right and for right now it is one of my favorite pumpkin ales."
"Poured by one of my St. Louis Brews buddies at 8th annual Hop in the City fest. I was given a generous portion. Very nice appearance. The second sample of the fest that followed a Randalized APA rolled out by brewmaster Stephen Hale. Following the five pound blast of cascades that the APA filtered through - the pumpkin spice flavors seen quite tame but the underlying malt flavors, carbonation and finish were satisfying. After a little rinse to clear the palate the flavor of pumkin came through better. I found the spicing a little over done. For me the test of this style is how well it holds up over the entire bottle. I had the O'Fallon last week and found it a beats Schlafly this year but both are well above average."
"I had this on tap at lunch yesterday, but this first review is for the bottled version. Dark copper to amber color, very clear and topped by a fizzy off white head. The head dissipated quickly. This beer is about 8% ABV, so IÂ’m not surprised the head recedes quickly. Wow, great pumpkin pie smell. Loads of spice, cinnamon, nutmeg, and whatÂ’s that? Pumpkin! It really comes across in the nose. Nice malty backbone too. The room fills with the aroma. The flavor dances in your mouth the nutmeg and cinnamon comes first, but the pumpkin shines through. What is a pumpkin ale without a nice ale base, and this beer does not disappoint. Wonderful dark caramel malt finish. The pumpkin and spice character lingers long after the drink blending nicely with a bit of alcohol. Big, full mouth feel. Great drinkability. This beer really is nice, and shines up there with other great pumpkin beers IÂ’ve had from Watch City and Smuttynose."
