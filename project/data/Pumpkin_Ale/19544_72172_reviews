"Got this on draft in Pittsburgh & it was love at first sip. The only pumpkin beer I've had that I have no complaints about as far as spices. Flavors are balanced not overwhelming fake or cloying. Can't even tell it's high abv goes down smooth. Extra good with cinnamon sugar rim on glass. Love this"
""
""
"Overall this is a good beer I just wish it had a stronger pumpkin taste."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall impression:  A big, bold, spiced ale.  The upfront pepper and clove character makes me think this was fermented with a Belgian yeast strain.  Enjoyable and worthy of aging."

"Pours dark amber.  Scant tan head.  Smells of pumpkins and pie spices plus vanilla and booze.  Taste follows.  Very good overall"

"O - This is an enjoyable pumpkin sipper.  As it warmed, it continued to please by offering up additional flavor subtleties.  It certainly deserves consideration among the higher ranks of pumpkin beers."

"O- This is a really great pumpkin ale.  The pumpkin pie spices are pretty prominent, but not over the top and quite a bit more hop character than usual.  The pie crust flavor in the beer was really impressive."

"This is very good. I don't really like pumpkin anything. Fat Heads once again took a blah style and elevated it. I will definitely buy another for next fall!"
"Pumpkin beers stand alone. It's not a style that I particularly love. Fat Head's absolutely nailed it. It's probably the tastiest pure pumpkin beer I've ever had."

"The best pumpkin ale I’ve found so far this year.  The appearance could be improved with some head and lacing – what’s the surfactant here, pumpkin or nutmeg?  The spices are not overpowering but add a delicate sensory experience.  The ale is sweet but not cloying.  The 9% ABV is not evident in either drink or aftertaste; instead, a slow heat rises in the stomach several minutes after consuming.  Just a darn good version of a pumpkin-based ale."

"It definitely has a boozy aftertaste, but it is not unpleasant. I am glad that this is very different from pumking. It is one of the biggest and best pumpkin brews."

"Spooky Tooth Imperial Pumpkin brewed by Fat Heahs Brewery & Saloon. This brew has an ABV of 9.0%. Now this Ale pours out a dark amber color with a thick white head. The color is almost brown.  The smell is sweet with spics and grains. This brew does smell like pumpkin pie.  The taste is bold with flavor. You pick up on pumpkin spice and the richness. For being a brew with an ABV of 9.0% this brew goes down smooth.  There is no bad after taste of nothing. Overall I'm giving this brew a 4.5 out 5. I will buy this brew again. Fat heads brewery & Saloon did a nice job with this brew."
""
""
""
"  Overall, a near-perfect 4.75 for Spooky Tooth Imperial Pumpkin - Fat Heads Brewery & Saloon. This was a great choice for today's weather, which seems to mark the official death of summer. I will probably pick this up again."

"O: This has pure flavors but overall it's a touch sweet and has a touch too much alcohol for my palate. Still recommended, I just think less sugar/booze would make it better"

"Ok Pumpkin beer... I like my Pumpkin beers way less boozy. The sting is too pronounced for my liking... Great taste though, would almost prefer it to be milder."

"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 8/27/2013. Pours very hazy/cloudy deep reddish orange color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin lace cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of big pumpkin, brown sugar, caramel, toast, biscuit, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, clove, and herbal earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt, pumpkin, and spice notes; with good strength. Taste of brown sugar, pumpkin, caramel, toast, biscuit, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, clove, and herbal earthiness. No bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of brown sugar, pumpkin, caramel, toast, biscuit, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, clove, and herbal earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of pumpkin, malt, and spice flavors; with a great malt sweetness/spice balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a moderately slick and lightly syrupy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice imperial pumpkin ale. All around good balance and complexity of malt, pumpkin, and spice flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering."
"Taste is smooth and the sweetness and spices are perfectly balanced. Drinks lighter than the 9%...though there is a bit of alcohol flare up on the finish. Lots of toast and caramel. Mouthfeel is thinner than most Imperial Pumpkin ales. Not bad, Id drink this again...would love to try it fresh on draft."
"O-A good pumpkin ale, but for the price for a four pack the beer isn't worth it."

"O - Not bad...not wowing me either. A different kind of pumpkin ale than I am used to having. This is one of those beers that doesn't really have anything wrong with it, but doesn't do anything to impress me either. Drinkable, enjoyable, not memorable."
""
""
""
"O - Good beer. One of the better ones we get in Pittsburgh, although slightly overpriced. I think it has a very good taste, and is well balanced. Not too pumpkin-y, but not lacking in that area. If you like pumpkin beers, I definitely recommend it."
""
"O- the malty sweetness balanced the spices well, the best part of this beer was the chewy and thick mouthfeel."
""
""
""
"If you want a candy-flavored pumpkin, check out the canned ale put out by the Onion Brewery. This is okay, but not worth the price."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is quite drinkable considering its strength because only hints of alcohol are present in the taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- For me a pumpkin ale is all about spice and pumpkin balance and this one really comes through with that. Was expecting a bit more sweetness and could due with a tiny bit more spice but I'd rather have less than more."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"A pretty interesting pumpkin ale that brings a bit more spice and a distinct syrupy sweetness that I haven't seen in other pumpkin beers. On that count, it gets points for standing out in a good way and is worth trying for sure, probably more than once. That said, there are still a few better pumpkins out there for my money."
""
"The taste is mostly pumpkin spice, with the actual pumpkin taking a backseat. Once again the alcohol is very noticeable. At the back of the mouth you get more of a caramel note and a slight toffee note as well. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with middle of the road carbonation. This is a solid pumpkin, not as drinkable as most of the others on the market, but it a imperial so that's to be expected. Take a little time to drink this one and it will be worth it."
""
"O: Spice! Heat! They don’t call it “the pumpkin beer with a kick” for nothing. I think the palate might have been a little too over-the-top to be great, but it’s certainly delicious otherwise – Fat Head’s continues to command my respect."
"The body is light but firm with lots of bite from crispness."
""
""
"Top tier pumpkin beer. No doubt about it!"
""

"Mouthfeel: This is a rather thick brew for a pumpkin but it does have a rather clean finish and not to bad of an aftertaste considering that I am not a big fan of pumpkin pie spices. This isn’t the best pumpkin that I have ever had but it is pretty good effort."

"Poured from the bottle into a goblet. Color is dark golden, head bubbles up but only slightly. Aroma is pumpkin, medium roasted malt and spice. The flavor is the most balanced I've ever tried for a pumpkin ale, full pumpkin flavor with a counterpoint of spice, neither one dominating, and then sweet malt. There aren't a lot of hops here, but enough to give the beer a clean finish. Mouthfeel is full-bodied but not overly heavy (less so than Dogfish Head Punkin), with the alcohol very well hidden. I have never before had a pumpkin beer that so perfectly combines pumpkin, spice, ABV and drinkability."
"Poured into a snifter, light tan head thins immediately, leaving a thin white ring in the glass, minimal lacing. Dark rich amber in color, but fairly clear. Sweet pumpkin puree, sweet malt, with a some spices noticeable in aroma. Taste is similar, with an added buttery/creamy feel to it. Aroma and flavor improve as it warms. It's smooth, with a slight bite on the end, not terribly hoppy, but definitely rather substantive, or chewy, as they say. Excellent finish. Overall, not a bad pumpkin beer, I'd give this one another shot sometime for sure. I think I'd prefer a bit more hops, but this good. Cheers."
""
"Overall in a way I don't like it just like I don't like the Bourbon Barrel aged heavy seas pumpkin. The alcohol in this taste like a regular pumpkin ale with a shot of rum or something added. Quite possibly the worst pumpkin ale I had of the season."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a medium to fuller bodied brew. This is rare for me to say this but I think the alcohol is a little too high and distracts from the overall experience. Overall there are a lot of positive and enjoyable things going on here. If you havent had it and like pumpkin ales, this is a must. Nicely done."

"O - This beer was new this year and quickly became a great go to pumpkin beer for me this season. It had the creamy, fuller bodied feel that I want these beers to have. Look forward to havving some next year."

"I bought a single of this at Belmont Party Supply, and it was definitely worth it. You have to know what you're getting yourself into here--this is a pumpkin ale, yes, but it's a strong one. The smell consists of brown sugar and pumpkin, and in the taste is the pumpkin, alcohol (it's not hidden at all but actually compliments the other flavors), brown sugar, and butter. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and carbonation is moderate. I generally avoid beers with a very high ABV as I find that the alcohol can distract from the taste, but with this one I found that the beer went down very easy and tasted great. The pumpkin flavor is fresh and bold without being overbearing, and the beer manages to avoid the overly sweet taste that some pumpkin ales struggle with."

"Deep ruby body, with all day tan khaki head flowing thick. Aroma has pumpkin spice, and gourd aromatics to boot. Perfume like but so decadent, it's pumpkin pie in a glass. Delicious so drinkable vanilla, nutmeg, clove, and cinnamon this is a perfect pumpkin beer. I'm glad I grabbed some. Great flavor I will up date this when I buy a whole four pack, I'm sad I just grabbed a single."

"12 ounce bottle. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours a reddish/copper color with about an inch and a half off-white head that sticks around a while. There's also a good amount of lacing. Aroma is nice, it smells like nutmeg, cinnamon, brown sugar, and pumpkin. Taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes like nutmeg, pumpkin, ginger, cinnamon, brown sugar and a bit of vanilla. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's coating with moderate carbonation. I think this is a good pumpkin ale, it's one of the better ones I've had. Definitely worth a try. $10.99 a 4-pack."

"Pours reddish brown with a two finger lingering in head. Smell is lots of nutmeg, cinnamon, some . Taste is lots of pumpkin, yam, earthy up front, lingers into cinnamon, nutmeg, roasty, and vanilla flavors. aftertaste leaves a slight spicy bite on your tongue, no seriously. Texture is what you'd expect from a 9% beer, almost creamy. Overall this one really impressed me, so well balanced for the style, not overly spicy, not overly malty, not overly pumpkinnny. Reminds me of pie with whipped cream on top. Well done fatheads, keep bottling these great brews. So happy to grab this amazing pumpkin ale."
"Excellent pumpkin ale. Finally an ale that tastes like pumpkin, spice and everything nice. (I have not had pumking yet). I try so many of these each year and each year I find a nice fall spiced beer but nothing with true pumpkin flavor While its not overboard and could be a little stronger in taste it is quite good. The smell of pumpkin spice, cinnamon and sweet pumpkin and a nice sweet malt. Delicious."
"I would not compare this beer to Pumking (that one is so distinct it's beyond comparison) and I don't think it's quite as good as Schlafly's. That one has more pumpkin flavor and a perfect blend of spices. However, this one definitely holds its own and the feel is to die for. Other than the lack of a strong pumpkin flavor, I'm not sure why this beer is getting lukewarm reviews. I think it's on the same level as DFH Punkin' Ale and certainly better than all but a handful of pumpkin beers out there."
"O - A good effort from Fat Heads. Recommended ! Cheers!"
"This is a solid Imperial Pumpkin Ale, but it's pretty safe and they don't exactly go outside of the box or try anything different, which Fat Head's is known for. It's not bad, but it's not exactly memorable."

"O: Decent, but I preferred Phantom Pumpkin over the imperial version."
""
"OVERALL: A fine pumpkin ale from the world class brewers at fatheads. Hides the alcohol very nice and has a great feel and agreeable flavor."

"O - Imperial amber with a bit of spice and pumpkin. Not at all bad, but nothing at all special."
""

"Pours an amber orangish color with a slight head which leaves a little lace. The aroma is of pumpkin along with the nutmeg and cinnomon. The taste has a nice pumpkin flavor which is rounded out by cinnamon and nutmeg along with a touch of sweetness and vanilla. The mouthfeel is moderatley carbonated. Overall it was a solid pumpkin beer, one of the better ones in the class."
"O: This is probably the strongest pumpkin ale I have ever had. It was a little sweet for me, but overall a very good beer."
"Notes: Another solid beer from Fat Heads which is quite consistent in my opinion."
