Flavors match the aromas with some pumpkin flavor on top of the spices. Medium body.","SierraFlight","Feb 26, 2015"

The cinnamon stands out above all else.  Like dipping your finger into a bowl of cinnamon sugar, but not overly sweet.  Mild bitterness balances well.  Fluffy mouthfeel.  One of the better pumpkin beers in the more spice forwarded category.","goochpunch","Sep 12, 2014"

And I'm in the mood for a pumpkin beer so might was well try it! Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a cloudy orange/amber color with some sediment floaties noticeable. There's also an inch and a half off-white head with good retention, along with a decent amount of lacing. Aroma is nice, the brew smells like pumpkin spices and pumpkin. The taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes like pumpkin spices (nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves), pumpkin, and some bready malt. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy, smooth and easy to drink. I liked this brew, hopefully this upcoming fall I'll try a fresher batch of this!","bluejacket74","May 16, 2014"

3.62,0.6,3,3.5,3.5,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before 12/15/2013. Pours hazy orange amber color with a 1 finger foamy white head with horrible retention, that reduces to a ring of lace quickly. Minimal lacing clings on the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of pumpkin, cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, ginger, wheat, bread, banana, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Nice aromas with prominent spice/yeast ester notes and moderate malt balance; with good strength. Taste of pumpkin, cinnamon, gingerbread, nutmeg, clove, wheat, brown sugar, light banana, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of pumpkin, cinnamon, gingerbread, nutmeg, clove, brown sugar, wheat, light banana, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Good balance, robustness, and complexity of malt, spice, and yeast ester flavors; with a good sweetness/spice balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a moderately creamy and smooth mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is good pumpkin ale. Good balance and robustness of pumpkin, malt, and spice flavors; and very smooth to drink. A pleasantly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Nov 20, 2013"

The atmosphere couldn't have been better. The beer is a hazy, orange amber color and the head is faint and small. The spice smell is heavy on cinnamon, and a touch of clove. Some malt in the aroma, but the spice is serious. Balanced, and not too sweet. Similar flavor to the smell. Smooth and ful body. Satisfying for the weather.

Delicious taste with a mix of that pumpkin flavoring with malts. Mouthfeel had a decent carbonation with a slight crispness. Overall, a really good, festive drink.","fitzy84","Sep 28, 2013"

Following a vigorous wind-up of the beer, my pour got a finger of rocky, bone-white head that fell in a most unusual web-like pattern. The nose was beautiful! It smelled like I had lit a scented candle in my kitchen. Spicy, with notes of cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice ... it just smelled like Fall. That is my favorite, albeit fleeting time of the year and this took me right back. Color was a hazy yellowish-orange. Mouthfeel was a little on the thin side, but the spices had held up nicely. They melded together well and were present without being overwhelming. Oh man, I could go for some pumpkin pie right about now. That is what it really reminded me of - a liquid slice of pumpkin pie. Not overwhelming with spice or alcohol, but just right. Hold on, some little girl with locks of gold is knocking on my door. Sorry, sweetie, this is for adults.

Spices notwithstanding, the beer has a notably zippy, orange-y, sweet, cracker-y wheat profile that is undeniably reminiscent of witbier.

Nice blend of spices and graham tinged crust. Pumpkin aromas are sweet and well balanced with the pale malt. Cinnamon is the front player as I inhale and the nutmeg leads back to the base aromas. Very nice. Taste is a big letdown. As good as the nose is the palate is not. Spices are a bit too forward of the malt and pumpkin. The hops are well done and there are some nice buttery notes as well but overall the beer is a bit disjointed with no connecting flow to the taste. To add the final blow there is a mineral edge in the finish that gives a platform for the spices to explode in a cascade of excessive bitterness. Cinnamon, clove, and pepper. It is better as it warms. but this is just not making it for me. Feel is light and crisp with a good carbonation. Very close to a solid brew but the details are taking this one down in my book. Maybe too much was put into the aroma at the sacrifice of taste.","scootny","Oct 28, 2012"

It pours a lightly hazy amber-straw topped by a half-finger of off-white foam. The nose comprises mild pumpkin pie, complete with crust, along with some bland wheat-like notes in the background. For once, it's unnecessary to list off the constituent spices and whatnot, 'cause here they just blend together too nicely, smelling almost too much like actual pumpkin pie for their own good. If only it were more powerful, this would smell amazing. The taste, though, makes me wish the exact opposite: The pie is still there, I suppose, but everything has gone rancid, putrefied. It's an all-out blitz on my tongue, finishing with a long-malingering sting of straight clove and black pepper. Imagine just chewing on those two spices in their raw forms. Yeah. This was awful, to say the least. Not only does it hurt as I drink it, but more pain follows while I'm trying to wrap my head around the maw that opened up between my perception of the smell and the taste. Damn. The body is a light medium, with a moderate carbonation and a lightly watery, lightly grainy feel. Overall, this has got to be one of the worst pumpkin beers I have ever had. It's still got a couple months on its 12/13/12 best-by date, but it seems like it's already starting to decay in the bottle. Shit, at this point I'd rather gnaw on a human bone dusted with cinnamon than take another sip o' this monstrosity.","TMoney2591","Oct 16, 2012"

The flavors are light, with a touch of booze character escorting a subtle pumpkin and spice blending. Not nearly as flavorful as the nose alludes to. Overall, it comes off a bit watered down. The spices are barely discernable at all, and the pumpkin transitions into a sharp, quickly fading character of the aftertaste.

4.17,15.8,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Well, it's a pumpkin ale and it seems well done. This style is usually dominated by wanna-bes but I think Pumpkin UFO captures the essence of it well in a drinkable form.","Brad007","Aug 13, 2011"
3.22,-10.6,3,3.5,3,4,3,"Interesting and certainly has the autumn pumpkin feel, along with another tart fruit hint. It is kind of like pumpkin fruit soda. The balance of flavor is lost with time and knocks this one down a level as it didn't start off too badly.","cbutova","Aug 10, 2011"
2.26,-37.2,3.5,2.5,2,2.5,2,"I was excited to get in the fall spirit, and try a newly released pumpkin beer. I should of had my iPhone on me but I Made snap judgement. This beer has an ok aroma. The apearance is the best part about the beer. The Taste is bland pumpkin on the finish. It was hard to detect any spices, if I did they were barely used in this beer. Over all a very, very bland pumpkin beer. My bartender summed it up by saying """it tastes like budweiser mixed with pumpkin.""" I wouldn't go that far, but it wasn't good. Give it a shot, all I know is this one is not for me. Harpoon is not a bad brewery, they just need to tweak the next batch perhaps.","bmwfan1987","Aug 09, 2011"
3.28,-8.9,4,3.5,3,3,3.5,"Had fresh on tap at the Burren, it was really f-ing good. Awesome aroma. Get it on draft.","BigCheese","Aug 06, 2011"
3.1,-13.9,3.5,3.5,3,2.5,3,"Orange/red, pretty much burnt pumpkin. Small amount of head with a thick ring around the glass afterwards. Only an extremely small amount of haze. F.O Pumpkin. Nose is spicy nutmeg, pumpkin and sourdough. Light body with a crisp tingle on the tongue. Light bready malt body with nutmeg and pumpkin spices. Finish is almost nothing, watery, a bland dryness, and only a carbonation tingle.","DrinkingDrake","Aug 06, 2011"
3.38,-6.1,3,2.5,3.5,3,4.5,"It sounds boring, but this is a fabulous beer. A perfect session pumpkin. Not over the top, not that mild, just right to drink a case or two.","taez555","Aug 06, 2011"
2.47,-31.4,4.5,2.5,2.5,2,2,"Make a 100-barrel pumpkin beer, guys. This one's not up to snuff. Kind of a harsh grade, but there's no way this is above average in the spectrum of pumpkin beers.","ShogoKawada","Aug 03, 2011"
3.6,0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Pours a hazy deep orange amber with a slight off white head. Doesn't stick around long and almost no lacing. Aroma of cinnamon and pumpkin. Flavor begins with a nice touch of pumpkin pie spices. Cinnamon leading the way. Also some nutmeg. Nice job not overpowering the pumpkin finish. Pumpkin pie filling finish which lingers into the aftertaste. Touch of hops in the beer. Solid drinkable pumpkin offering from harpoon which still maintains the characteristics of a beer. A lighter pumpkin offering for those of you who aren't looking to be overpowered by spice and heartiness.","uustal","Jul 31, 2011"
3.83,6.4,4.5,4,4,3,3.5,"If you like the style check it out, nothing eye popping but definitely a solid addition to the UFO/Harpoon lineup.","Skeeter206","Jul 30, 2011"
3.65,1.4,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"If you're really interested in trying some real pumpkin beers, I'd recommend Southern Tier's Pumking, Dogfish Punkin' Ale, Weyerbacher Imperial Pumpkin Ale, and Shipyard's Smashed Pumpkin. Let me know how it goes...","Leftfield00","Jul 27, 2011"
3.17,-11.9,3,3.5,3,3.5,3,"O/D: It's a solid harpoon addition, good for summer right now, I can see it being very enjoyable in the fall. It's an easy drinker, but with all the other pumpkin beers out there, I don't see myself picking much of this up.","mostpoetsdo","Jul 23, 2011"
