"Very spicy, but without a single over-dominant spice that's likely to throw you off, a nice (if strong) blend of flavors.  Body is pretty thick and adds a nice touch.  It's on the side of the more """festive""" pumpkin ales."

"Batch 1 (2012).  I sampled this beer on 10/20/2014."
"Very awesome brew is kind of like a spice beer"
"Overall:  I really, really like this beer!  As stated above, it’s basically an English brown ale flavored with pumpkins and spices, and I find it very delicious.  I’m definitely getting a bottle or two of this next year!"
""
""
""
""
"Yes! It's worth the wait. The Best"
"Tons of pumpkin, pumpkin spice, warming alcohol and I even got a bit of bourbon. Hands down one of the best pumpkin ales I've had to date!"
""
""
""
"Overall this is actually a decent brew, and the aroma seems to indicate a true pumpkin brew, but this really doesn't taste like one.  For that it's more appealing to me, but this really tastes like a winter warmer, or perhaps a pumpkin aroma version of Old Fezziwig?  Hard to score this one, decent, but to style not really?  So I'll be on the fence."

"O-Too much a brown ale and not enough of a pumpkin beer."
"Good but you must LOVE pumpkin to like this beer."
"A solid imperial pumpkin ale.  Nice and spicey!"
"Judging by the label of this beer """Over 28lbs of pumpkin per barrel""" you would think this brew would be screaming with pumpkin and spice flavor.  The only thing I could taste was the malt.  I don't know what has happened with the Boston Beer company as of late but it seems they are just brewing beer to say they brew beer.    The best pumpkin beer that I have had is Southern Tier's Warlock."

"Have you tired of pumpkin ales? Come to think of them as redundant and predictable? Try Fat Jack! Love it or hate it - and, trust me, there's a far better chance of the former - you're sure to find it an interesting take on the style. It's impossible to walk away from without an opinion. Don't expect as much of the holiday spirit, but be ready for a ton of character beyond the standard spices."

"Bottle: Poured a clear copper color ale with a nice off-white foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of cinnamon and cloves with light cereal notes is OK but subtler then I was expecting. Taste is also dominated by cloves and cinnamon with almost no perceptible pumpkin notes. Body is lighter than expected with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. A lot more tame than I was expecting…"
"Pours a one finger off-white head that fades slowly leaving a good lace. Clear amber color. Good carbonation and medium bodied.  Spicy nose and flavor is sweet spices with some pumpkin. Higher ABV is hidden  $7.50 for a 22oz bottle from Chase Street Market Plymouth, NH"

"No. Looks awesome, but just too sweet and cloying to enjoy. Sticky sweet. Not distinct enough as a pumpkin brew to be worth the bother. Disappointing."

"Mouthfeel is the best part, very rich, malty and smooth.  The spicing is just right/  Good pumpkin ale."
""
""
"22 oz bottle.  Pours amber with long lasting off-white head and nice lacing.  Aroma is of bready malt, grassy hops, pumpkin and spices.  Body is full and crisp.  Pumpkin, caramel, spices, herbal hops nicely balanced on the palate.  Finish is long, semi-sweet and spicy.  Delicious brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is my second bottle of the season and I'd say it is disappointing.  Won't be buying any Fat Jack next year."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall -  It's not bad, but it's not quite got enough pumpkin for my liking as the spices and strangely the cheery cough syrup flavor get the top billing here. Not my cup of tea."

"This poured a thick hazy autumn brown with a fantastic thick head. Spicy nose of cinnamon with hints of nutmeg, clove and sweet pumpkin puree. A little boozy but a lot of pumpkin gourd. Spicy anise, caraway, nutmeg but very little cinnamon come at the finish. Throughout I get a maltiness that had significant structure and volume. It is a very good example of pumpkin ale."
""
""
""
""
"1 Year Aged: Nearly identical appearance aside from some slightly increased haziness. The aroma is slightly more funky with some fruity tartness of sour cherry atop the predicted aromas of pumpkin, spice and malt for a incredibly curious but slightly more potent aroma. Despite having a flavor which comes through as shallow on pumpkin as the fresh vintage, the funk does manage to cut the graininess somewhat and make the beer slightly more enjoyable in flavor, otherwise most of the glaring imperfections remain. The texture and carbonation remain nearly the same, very slick and nearly under carbonated. In general it's just about as difficult to drink as a fresh Fat Jack and any aging just adds to the complications. If you have a bottle, I do not recommend storing it away."
"This may be the most under the radar pumpkin beer out there for craft beer geeks, simply because it's made by SA.  Don't overlook it; it's maybe the best non-porter pumpkin-style ale I've had yet."
""
"Of the pumpkin beers I've tried, I'd say this one is closest to Howe Sound's Pumpkineater. Low on pumpkin, high on alcohol. More brown sugar than pumpkin or spice. Well, okay. It's far from awful, but it's not what I want out of a pumpkin ale."

""
""
""
""

"All I could taste was the alcohol"
""
""
""

"Overall - enjoyable pumpkin ale.  For about the same price I'd probably reach for pumpking but this was worth trying"
""
""
""
""
""

"It's alright, pretty good pumpkin flavor. Still have not had anything better than Pumking by southern tier."

"Overall: Like I said before, I'm not a Samuel Adams fanboy at all. Yet this brew is balanced beyond belief! The reason why I might be enjoying this brew so much is that beneath the spices lays a nice Imperial English Style Amber Ale. I love me both American style and English Styles of the Amber Ales and Lagers. I think they nailed this one. This brew is recommended!"

"Overall- The sweetness for me detracted from this beer (And I'm into sweet flavors in beers). The sweetness is more in the way of caramelized sugar and its intensity took away from the subtle pumpkin flavor. The spices were adequate. The malts added to this beer should be revisited."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O:  it's not terrible.  It's middle of the road, pumpkin and spice.  It's not overly spiced, not overly pumpkin.  Just solid."

"I think this is a great pumpkin ale; surely one of the best out there (which isn't saying much). I'm surprised at the current rating of 82. The spices are there. The kick is there. The taste not only compliments the smell, but is more intense. It's what I want from this type of drink. The nutmeg and cinnamon stand out the most. The smell is very warming. There's a nice bite to the drink. I would certainly get this again."
""
""
""
"M-  good full body.   Thick and a creamy finish."
"Overall this works and it is a great treat (but not a trick). Bool, the end!"

"Pours a very dark brown with some ruby highlights that has about a good 1/2 finger off-white foamy head that settles down to about a 2mm layering on top and a bit more on the sides of the glass. Some spotty lacing is seen when sipped but not a lot. The aroma is full of pumpkin and spices! Very pleasant and makes me wish it was autumn! Lots more going on with the taste with a good amount of punkin flavor with some spice that probably consists of clove and nutmeg with some malts. Very tasty and medium bodied. Goes down easy with no bitter or harsh aftertaste at all. Perfect carbonation for this type of brew. One of the better pumpkin seasonals"

"Taste / Palate: There is a lot going on in this full bodied festive beer. The base has a solid gingerbread like maltiness with loads of cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice. It also has notes of vanilla and a very mild bourbon like boozy character. In the middle of all this there is a very mild squash/sweet potatoe like sweetness. The finish brings some light herbal hop bitterness and dryness which blends with the dry spice within. The dry spice lingers and begs you to take another sip."
"A very average and forgettable pumpkin ale."

"Some pumpkin beers are like pumpkin pie, some like pumpkin muffins and some actually taste like pumpkin. Fat Jack tastes like pumpkin bread. One of the better beers from one of my least favorite styles."

"Overall: This was much better than expected. I don't pick up much pumpkin, but the malty backbone and creaminess of this beer is very nice. The spices, dark malts and smokiness add a lot of complexity to this beer and makes you want to keep trying it. I know you will be shocked by this, but it goes very well with pumpkin bisque."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This offering is more full-bodied than most pumpkin ales. I enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone who likes this style."
""
""
""
"This pours a medium brown color with a creamy, off-white head. The aroma is full of pumpkin and spice. The texture is much creamier then I would have expected. The mixture of pumpkin and spice is just right with a great finish. Finishes with a touch of lingering cinnamon. It still doesn’t rival the taste of Pumking, but it is still very good in it’s own way!"

"O - Pleasant experience. I would buy it again next fall. My only critique is the pumpkin taste got lost in all the other things they got going on, which is really what the beer is suppose to be about, pumpkin ale, other than that, a great beer."
""
""
""
""
""

"Beautiful dark Amber color with a nice orangish head. Spices and a hint of sweet pumpkin. Excellent flavor, a real seasonal that is different from others I've had, the pumpkin taste is there but not over powering, nutmeg with a sweet after taste, no bitterness. Mouth feel: Medium carbonation and body. Overall: A very pleasant surprise. Sam Adams hit the mark with this one."
"Not bad. The fruitiness was offputting and the spices overwhelmed a bit, but very festive. I'm not big on ginger. My favorite part about this brew is the dry finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"in terms of flavor this is not particularly unique, a well spiced pumpkin beer, high in alcohol and big in flavor. in terms of feel it is different, very rich for the style, with a lot of body as long lasting stick to your guts sweet finish that makes it a pleasantly warming autumn offering. a gorgeous dark appearance, glowing the deepest amber and boasting a generous off white cream head with ring lacing as it drinks. aromatics of ginger and clove above sweet red and caramel malt. plenty of spice but keeping balanced flavors throughout, regal richness on the finish, really quite lovely. this fills me up a little, warms me up a lot, and genuinely ignites the holiday spirit in me. tis the season, and this beer is a perfect seasonal reminder of the beauty of the harvest and the months to come. I believe this is woefully underrated on BA."

"Poured into an oversized wine glass. Color was a dark reddish burgundy with a thick 2 finger off white head. Aroma was predominantly spicey, nutmeg and cloves. Slight earthiness akin to pumpkin as well. Flavor was peppery, with some sweetness from the pumpkin. Not overly spiced, or overly sweet. Nicely balanced. Felt decent in the mouth. A bit of bite, not overly thick, coated ok. Overall, a solid beer at the $6 I paid."

"Overall: A pretty decent pumpkin offering here and something I'd likely try again. Given its availability, worth trying if you like a full bodied pumpkin ale without too much pumpkin character."
""
""
""
""
"An enjoyable Pumpkin ale, one of the better ones I've tried, I like'em malty & with a little kick"
""
""
""
""
"Overall a good beer. I would say its actually one of the better pumpkin ales I've had. It's not blowing my socks off or anything, but its good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is an an interesting, novelty seasonal beer. I recommend it if you have not had it before, but I don't know I would order it regularly, therefore I can't rate it's drinkability very high."
""
"O: I was curious what Sam Adams would do with their shot at this style. Glad to see they took not only the balanced approach but a unique one, too. Balanced flavors, cross-varietal even, and an appreciably high ABV for the style. As stated before, make sure you want a beer, not pie."
""
""
""
"O: This beer is an outright Pumking clone: same sweetness, same vanilla-heavy nose, same ABV for goodness’ sake (8.5% for SA, 8.6% for ST). But there’s just something so special about Pumking that this beer doesn’t capture, something that makes it like taking a bite of the world’s best pumpkin pie: I’m guessing it’s the pie crust malt and authentic pumpkin earthiness that this beer is lacking. That said, this is an excellent pumpkin ale, and one of the best seasonal I’ve had from Sam Adams. Sweet, but satisfyingly so."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, the name is fortunately misleading, probably because the pumpkin pie routine does not overwhelm in favor of good beer, should be good for sipping on a cool fall day."

""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""

""
"Overall, it's an ok beer. A little underwhelming because I like the style and Sam Adams' bombers are usually better than their 12-ounce bottled beers. However, it's just a bit too spicy."
"O: This reminds me of setting around a camp fire in fall with the smell of pumpkins and spice crackling in the air. The pumpkin is not like your typical artificial pumpkin pie flavored beer but a more roasty and earthy flavor. It's quite nice and warming."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – A rather tasty pumpkin ale. It’s a little on the sweeter side for an imperial pumpkin ale, but is still balanced in many respects, as it has a good blend of booze, spice, and pumpkin to tame the sweet. Overall a rather enjoyable drinker."
""
""
""
""
"O - Sam Adams has always has unique seasonal beers, and this one, unfortunately, is a little disappointing. Sure it has some pumpkin, but I was hoping for more. A lot more, as a fall-themed beer, it's great, but as a pumpkin beer, it misses its mark."
"O: A pretty good seasonal from Sam Adams. This is a nice alternative to the droves of lighter/smoother pumpkin ales that flood the market around this time of year. A bit too sweet for my tastes, but good in small doses."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: for a pumpkin ale, this doesn't fit the bill. For an abbey ale, it's just right. Dark fruits overrule the pumpkin and stay all night for a pleasant sipper."
""
""
""
""
"Taste is a little milder than the nose would indicate with the malts holding their own against the spices. It has the typical Sam Adams yeast/burnt caramel character I seem to get in so many of their beers. It tastes a bit like sauteed pumpkin left in the skillet a little too long. Its ok...I wont buy it again, but I'll finish my half bottle sample."
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste surprises as well, as the beer is more hop forward than I've experienced with pumpkin beers. Caramel and toffee notes hit the tongue first, followed by subtle pumpkin and spice and a bit of heat from the booze. Smokiness shows up throughout and adds a layer of complexity. The beer drinks much more like an imperial stout or dark strong ale, with a thick mouthfeel and alcohol burn similar to those beers. Still, it is smooth, complex and overall quite enjoyable. I am impressed by this beer and surprised it doesn't receive more mention or love such as what Pumking gets."
""
""
""
"after having a few beers tonight I decided to take a shot at Samuel Adams Fat Jack. I've got to say, every time I passed this beer on my way to pick up a Pumking (if you haven't had it you need to find it and hoard it forever). I've got to say I'm pretty happy that I've picked pumking over this 99/100 times. I feel like it literally tastes like a slim jim. the smell doesn't add a thing to the experience and the taste is far off from what the label describes it as. do yourself a favor and pick up something you can drink without thinking about macho man randy savage"
""
""
""
""
"Would definitely drink again. Great pumpkin beer without being overly sweet."
""
""
"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a ruddy orange amber with a fine two finger pumpkin colored head that had great retention and lacing. Aroma is sweet bready malt with cooked pumpkin nd hints of pumpkin pie spicing, mild. Flavor is sweet malt, gentle but distinct smokiness, toffee, glazed pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger. Very nice, medium to heavy, creamy body. A quite sweet pumpkin ale, but good pumpkin pie character and I really liked the smokiness; like eating pie around an open fire. I think this might have been a bit cloying without the smoked malt, but kudos to Boston Beer for making this fun to drink. The malt support really makes this stand apart from many pumpkin ales that are all about spicing. I liked this more than I expected to and will add it to my Fall beer rotation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Well done!"
""
"O - Overall, one of the more interesting Pumpkin beers I've had so far this year. It's a solid take on the style with a lot going on in the nose and palate, but to me it doesn't overdo any of the characteristics that it's going for. In a sea of over-spiced and/or over-sweetened pumpkin-soda-beers, this one stands on the higher end and will definitely be a brew I'll look forward to. If you're someone who generally partakes in the Sam Adams stigma and would have avoided it because of the name, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised if you reconsider and pick up a bomber or five."
""
""
""
""
"Atmosphere is really nice. Nice head, and some thick lacing. Characteristic nose, consisting of pumpkin and fall spices. Bitter and pungent, high alcohol, combo of pumpkin, licorice, and wood components. Very robust. Overall, this is a good quaff."
""
""
""
"O: I saw this one advertised in """Beer Advocate Magazine""" and cynically thought it would be another macrobrewery's attempt to capitalize on the popular style, but when I saw it in the store I took a chance -- I'm glad I did, as this is a fine example of the style. The finishing taste was a little off, but just slightly; otherwise it was a very good beer. I think it's a little pricey, but I would (and did) recommend it to friends."
""
""
"O: The pumpkin ale category is very, very competitive, for sure. I firmly believe that a lot of the negativity on here is due to Sam Adams hate."
"Overall, I find this to fit in quite well with the other standard pumpkin ales out there and is definitely worth a drink."
""
"O: I was not disappointed. I prefer stouts and such, but would like to revisit this one."
""
""
""
""
"O: Good, but far from my favorite pumpkin ale."
""
""
""
""
"O- could have done without trying this one it wasn't great. The two row and 8% abv ruined this beer for me.."
""
""
"Appearance is a deep ruby hue with highlights all day thick textured tan head fills the glass, light sporadic chunky layered lacing gives you the idea of texture. Aroma has a hint of spice and earthy hop additions it's actually pretty muted on the nose. go figure. Flavor has it all ginger, all spice, cinnamon to the point where it almost burns you, it's a beer that actually feels like it's a heated addition due to the level of ginger this Fat Jack decided to take on. It's a big beer almost too much, calories I could guess at least 500 per 12 ounce serving. Residual sugars flood the mouthfeeel making it full to the bone. I want an easy drinking ale to come around."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: There is alot of alcohol detected when tasting this beer, that i don't detect when i smell it. I'm disappointed by the taste, after expecting a lot more from Sam Adam's special beers."
""
""
"O - Great fall pumpkin beer! Love the fact that the pumpkin isnt overpowering and doesnt mask the other flavors in the beer. Very well balanced. A very drinkable beer but one is enough (specially since I had a 22 oz bomber). Strong stuff and you can feel the burn"
""
"O: Top 10 pumpkin beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"There's no doubt that this is a good beer, but I think many are disappointed because it labels itself a """double pumpkin""" beer when actually the pumpkin flavor takes a backseat to the spice. There are flavors of nutmeg, cinnamon, malt, a bit of hops, and vanilla. The alcohol is well concealed in the taste, but there's nothing here that's particularly exciting. I paid around $8 for 1 pt. 6 fl,. oz. (hence the slightly lower """Overall""" rating) and frankly I wish I would've spent that money elsewhere, but the beer was still enjoyable."
""
""
"Overall: I was pretty surprised by this one. Sam Adams rarely disappoints, but this was a tier higher than I was expecting from them. I was expecting a top 15 pumpkin brew, but this is easily in the top six. The only thing keeping it from really excelling was the lackluster aroma. I'll probably go pick up a couple of more though before the season ends so I can have some in October."

"Pours a clear, dark brown color. 1/3 inch head of an off-white color. Good retention and great lacing. Smells of pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg, hint of allspice, and a hint of hop. Fits the style of a Pumpkin Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of slight roasted malt, sweet malt, hint of hops, slight pumpkin, and strong spices. Overall, good blend, appearance, and body."

"Heavy bodied mouthfeel with a nice appropriate level of carbonation."
""
""
""
"Aroma has decided pumpkin and cinnamon notes, plus hints of malt and cloves. It pours a clear mahogany with a fairly thick light, slightly pumpkin-orange head that leaves good lacing. Satisfying flavor has a malty core with a noticeable but not overpowering pumpkin tone, as well as notes of cinnamon, horehound and cloves and a touch of caramel. Smooth texture has good body though not a lot of fizz."
""
""
"Refreshingly suitable malt base to carry this spice-forward ale. Ginger up front but not overpowering."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I was expecting that imperial bite in the taste but was instead hit with a luscious malt base. On the palate it’s bready, toasted malts, a slight smokiness, and a great squash character; plus that same holiday spicing as the nose, very cider-like. There’s a light booziness and just enough bitterness to give a nice kick. Incredibly smooth and drinkable for an imperial pumpkin, Fat Jack is a great representation of the dark pumpkin style and it’ll definitely be a beer that I pick up again next year."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - This is basically their Harvest Pumpkin Ale on steroids. That's not necessarily a good thing, as the Harvest Pumpkin wasn't all that good to begin with. Drinkable, but not too terribly enjoyable, and I cringe at the thought of paying the full asking price for it."
""
""
""
""
"O- The nice malt depth with subtle spices have an interesting smoke hint and a pumpkin tartness that come through when it is warm. Nice solid pumpkin beer."
""
"Overall: A really solid take on the pumpkin ale style. Real pumpkin taste with a solid spicing that doesn't go overboard."
""
""
"Cheers to Sam Adams. I finally found it!....the pumpkin ale to beat all other pumpkin ales."
""
"Beer is medium-heavy in weight, with fairly modest carbonation considering the ethanol and heft. The resulting mouthfeel is slightly sluggish, a bit more carbonation would perhaps make the aroma more prominent and ease the sipping of this beer. I appreciate the heaviness of the beer, though, as this seems to complement both the heaviness of the flavors and the style in general. Ethanol warmth on the back of the palate and throat, not unpleasant. Finishes rather dry, with a bit of residual stickiness around the lips."

"O: Overall nice drinkability, not overly done spice wise but a blend of both worlds, real honest pumpkin flavor with just the right amount of spicing accent which doesnt come off like a pumpkin pie in a blender type of drink. Usually pumpkin beers are at one end of the spectrum or the other, a gag full of pumpkin pie spice, or just a bland amount of pumpkin pulp with little spicing, this seems to balance a nice sweet spot inbetween. Again sam adams achieves a nice balanced very drinkable beer that you just cant complain about."

"Thought this was well done... loved the color, dark brown, decent head rentention. The aromas and flavors were decent. Nothing spectaculr but a decent pumpkin beer with a nice big malty body. That was the best thing abiut the beer is that it had some substance to it, not a weak spicy pumpkin soda like so many on the market today. Pumpkin nor the spice was overpowering and the brown ale base was solid."
"Overall I thought this was a good beer and a pretty damn good example of the style, it had everything I look for in a Pumpkin Ale with some nice balance and a pretty creamy mouthfeel. This beer had good drinkability, it went down pretty smooth and the 8.5% alcohol barely showed up in the taste, I think one bomber is the perfect amount with this beer, I couldn't see myself drinking another bottle after this one. What I liked the most about this beer was it's balance and the fact that it wasn't overly spiced and the creamy mouthfeel was also pretty noteworthy. What I liked least about this beer was nothing, I can't think of anything that I disliked or would change about this beer, it's fine just the way it is. I would buy another bottle of this if it's released next year, it's a good all around Pumpkin Ale, and it isn't that expensive, I recommend this beer to anyone looking for a good Pumpkin Ale. All in all I was pretty satisfied with this beer and I would say this is one of the best Pumpkin Ales that I have had this year but I don't think it knocks the now retired Screaming Pumpkin off as being my favorite Pumpkin Ale, but this was a pretty damn good one in it's own right and I'm glad that I took a chance on it. This is much better then their Harvest Pumpkin Ale and it's worthy of being put in bombers, good job guys this is one good Pumpkin Ale that's really hitting the spot on this cold Halloween night."
"Smells of a sweet caramel apple with plenty of toasted bread and pumpkin pie spice in layers on top of each other. The flavor has the same breadiness and pumpkin pie spice but with a touch more cinnamon hotness and plenty of brown sugar. Fresh, meaty pumpkin is actually identifiable within the flavor profile, as is a mild sort of milk chocolate background nuance. The ABV is semi-hidden, but does show up towards the end of the sip as a rising heat, which also helps to dry out the finish."
""
"I'm quite impressed with Fat Jack, however I feel guilty for dismissing the Boston Beer Company's ability for excellence. I've seen a lot of great breweries spew off lackluster or ill-balanced pumpkin ales routinely. But the palate is certainly rewarded with a glass of Fat Jack on the eve of Halloween!"

"Overall: This is what I expect from an imperial pumpkin. Nice bold and sweet flavors. This has elements of an English barleywine. I love the deep rich caramel and pumpkin. I will pick this up again next year."

"On tap at Kickbacks in Jax. Poured into a small snifter. Light beige, frothy head, high retention. Body is dark amber to light mahogany. Lacing is sudsy and sticky. Aroma includes caramel malts, some brown sugar, light beef jerky (no idea why), maybe some cinnamon. Not really any pumpkin flavors per se, maybe they are there and the beef jerky smell is throwing me off. Taste is also not pumkiney, just hints of pumpkin pie spices. Tickles the tongue and lips slightly. Pretty tasty beer just a little less pumpkin flavor than expected from a """double pumpkin""" beer."
"Not something to throw down a sixer of at a Halloween party, but a nice sipper on a cool autumn night."
""
"Overall, not a bad effort, in fact it's a relief to not use the words """cinnamon and nutmeg""" at all in this review. And that alone makes this worth sipping."

"Overall: this is a tasty and flavorful pumpkin ale. Slower sipping than some other pumpkin beers, this one is satisfying. Worth trying this one if you can find it."
"Price Point - $6.99/16.9 oz bottle"

"Nevertheless, the long and short of it is: if you like spiced ales, or if you've never tried something like this, give it a shot. It's very surprising and interesting, though it won't be added to my list of favorite beers anytime soon. But at 8.5%? I'm a happy pumpkin, for sure."
"O - 4.25 - This is a solid winner. When you've given up on Samuel Adams' main line of beers as too tame, don't sleep on their special lines. There is quality stuff to be had. What I like about this one is the fullness of it. You're not left wanting. The spices are deftly handled and just a pleasure to smell, without being attacky and overdone on the palate. You can taste real pumpkin flavor and dream of mom's pumpkin pie to come in November. I can't wait. I'm basically a fan of anything double/imperial and this takes pumpkin ale where I want it to go."

"overall i have mixed feelings about this concoction. without any other amped up pumpkin beers to compare this to, methinks this is a pretty good ale. but the overly boozy aspect distracts a bit too much, crippling the overall enjoyment. find a way to incorporate the high ABV a bit better into the taste profile and this would be a fantastic fall seasonal."

"Big pumpkin up front with a nice spice bitter punch - definitely get cinnamon, ginger, and clove, but they are subtle and balanced - not obnoxious as many pumpkin ales can be. Has real creamy smooth mouth feel with caramel and roasted malt coming through. Alcohol is well hidden and it is very drinkable. I don't think I could love any pumpkin beer, but this is one of the best I've had, and it surprised me - I was expecting to not like it."

"This is a solid brew from Sam Adams. This new line of beers has proven to be quite inspired and at the very least respectable from a brewer that has come dangerously close to being macro. Fat Jack pours a deep red color with notes of cinnamon and big time nutmeg. Taste follows suit, but stronger and much more robust than their Harvest Pumpkin Ale. I wish it were creamier like an iced pumpkin or chai latte, but still it ranks highly in its field. Pumpkin ale fans should check it out!"
""
"Drinkability is okay. A lot of good sights and smell on this beer, but the taste is overpowered by some very smokey malts. I would give this a try, some would like it better than me."
"Ruby hue that shines when brought to the light. Its creamy off-white head dissipates to a thin mist in the glass. Aroma of apple skins up front, light booze, caramel, black cherry, mild pumpkin spice, and honeyed cereal grains. Tastes of caramel-dipped apples, pumpkin spice, nutmeg, undertones of pumpkin vegetal flavor, faint wood and a tingling boozy aftertaste reminiscent of a red wine or a liqueur. Medium bodied with light carbonation that leaves some slickness on the tongue. A sweet, slow sipper that showcases the vegetable nature of the pumpkin behind a sweetened exterior."
""
"M - Medium-to-thick body with balanced carbonation. Finish is sweet and sticky. More of a sipper this one."
"Chasing that elusive perfect pumpkin ale...this one is a contender, but it still falls a bit short. It's a clear reddish-brown color. The head is off-white and slim. Great aroma...pumpkin, spice (cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg). It's not a pumpkin pie smell, but is a rich, adult candy-pumpkin smell. Malt, a touch of smoke, maybe a fleeting caramel scent. The flavor is rich and intense, with a diminished pumpkin and some earthiness. Full body. Very nice beer, interesting and satisfying, but not quite exceptional."
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass. Pours a dark reddish orange, with a half inch of white head that leaves some lacing. Smell is pumpkin, cinnamon, brown sugar, and nutmeg. Taste is what you would expect, very straight forward. Body is medium, enough carbonation, not dry, and drinkable. Now I don't love pumpkin beers, but find this to be exactly what I expect from the style. A easy drinking 8.5 in my opinion. Solid pumpkin brew."
"O: a good pumpkin ale, overall. Smells great, though a little too boozy and lacking the complexity of the aroma."

"D - Fat Jack is welcome in my beer fridge any time... This is a really really good imperial pumpkin ale that I had expected to be slightly disappointed in given the reviews I've seen, bit I walk away rather impressed... Definitely in the top quartile of pumpkin brews I've tried... If there's any room for complaint its in the """double pumpkin""" labeling... Other than the slight heat on the palate, there is little or no indication that this is an imperial or double pumpkin ale... None the less, this is a highly recommended Pumpkin Ale and a damn fine job from Boston Beer Company..."

"O: Great flavor in this beer. I really did enjoy it. Unfortunately, not what I was expecting with a name like """Double Pumpkin""". I thought that it show cased the malts and yeast very well, just not the spicy pumpkin and autumn feeling pumpkin beer I was hoping for."
""
"O: Feels like a 'miss' for my palate but its not a bad beer overall. Just too much like pumpkin and not enough like sweet-pumpkin-pie-dessert for me. YMMV."
"O: Different take on the dime-a-dozen pumpkin beer. Starts off """meh""" but gets better as you drink more."

"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, batch 1 bottled recently. Pours crystal clear reddish copper color with a nice 1-2 finger dense khaki head with nice retention, that reduces to a good cap that lingers. Slight spotty lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg, caramel, toast, biscuit, allspice, nuttiness, and light herbal spiciness. Very nice and well balance aromas with good strength. Very pleasant. Taste of pumpkin, caramel, toast, biscuit, cinnamon, ginger, nuttiness, and light herbal. Lingering notes of caramel, biscuit, toast, pumpkin, nuttiness, and spices on the finish for a good bit. Nice balance and complexity of flavors, with a great spice balance; with no cloying flavors at all after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is extremely well hidden with nearly zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent imperial pumpkin ale! Great flavor balance overall with just the right amount of spices; very smooth to drink. A very pleasant and highly enjoyable offering."
""
""
"O: a bit over the top. nice pumpkin pie flavor and it really tastes of fall but it's a little too in your face. probably wouldn't be a bad beer to share but drinking it solo isn't a wise decision."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Pretty easy going down. Very nice and tasty and the spcies with pumpkin now bring this beer to a whole. The bitterness brought some very tight flavoring to the sweetness of the pumpkin malts. I will defiantly drink again."
"Overall, a really unigue and interesting take on a pumpkin ale. The malt character paired with the pumpkin provides an interesting base beer for the spices to play off. I did think the spice levels were a bit off for what they were going for. Lots of ginger and allspice created a more savory, less sweet character to the beer. Interesting, but not something I would buy regularly."
""
""
"Overall: Tried this in honor of pumpkin season and pleasantly surprised.it's a standout."
""
"Pours medium dark brown with some reddish hints. light layer of white foam. Malty smell, mostly caramel. Very minor hint of nutmeg. Some pumpkin taste, some cinammon. Not overloaded. All flavors mild and blended. Smoky too. Real flavor here, nicely done."
""
""
"Overall, this is a decent pumpkin-based beer, and it’s immediately obvious why Sam Adams chose to label this as a “Double Pumpkin” beer: the flavors are huge, and enough raw pumpkin has entered the mix to leave an oily sensation in the mouth after swallowing. The spices are slightly over-large, however, and the heavy alcoholic burn does somewhat detract from the flavors. And just at the edges of the beer is a very raw pumpkin flavor—not pumpkin pie-cooked, but raw straight from the gourd—which is also offsetting. Decent, but could have used a bit more fine-tuning."
""
"O - I really enjoyed this, despite it's obvious flaws (over-spiced, over-carbonated). Not as good as DFH Punkin, but better than most I have tried. If you enjoy autumn spices, give it a whirl."
""
"O - I think this may be my favorite pumpkin beer, and this is my favorite style!"
"Overall, a really great pumpkin beer and probably the best imperial variety I have had. Just wish I could find bottles of this."
""
"Nice full-bodied pumpkin flavor with a rich array of spices. Rich and creamy sweetness makes for a nice dessert beer. The typical pie spices can be a tad bit much as you work through all 22 ounces but they're not as over done as many other pumpkin beers can be. Overall, while many pumpkin beers lack the body to carry all the flavor, Fat Jack has a nice balance of heft to hold up all that is going on but splitting the bottle might be a good idea as the richness can get to you."
"My taste buds are introduced in a sweet fashion with dark malts and a little nutmeg and all spice but after a minute the moderate pepper-like bitterness kicks in and lingers briefly before pleasantly fading out. A nice pumpkin ale."
""
"O - This is a pretty good pumpkin ale. Glad I could try it on tap at 44 Stone."
"Overall - not a bad brew overall. It's obviously just a play for the seasonal, so it's a little overdone in that sense, but it's still a good tasting brew."

"O: If you like pumpkin beers this will be amazing. If not, then at least you can say you had one. Not my thing, but if it was, I would know I would like this beer."

""
""
""
""
"O. Well, it doesn't taste much like a pumpkin ale, but that's not to say it's not a tasty beer. The traditional spicy notes are subdued, which I don't mind in the least, but they are replaced by a lot of roasted caramel notes and a finish that reminds me of a strong ale or winter warmer. I detect little pumpkin character in Fat Jack, which makes it a bit of a disappointment, but as a lightly spiced strong ale, it's not half bad."
""
""
"Overall, a decent pumpkin beer. It's overly spiced with too much cinnamon. But the base is kind of a winter warmer old ale with some light roast and dark fruit that is kind of cool and plays well with the pumpkin."

"Overall: Not too shabby. I wouldn’t say it beats out Pumking, but this stuff is tasty and cheap. Get you some."
"Batch 1 - 22oz. bottle served in a tulip. Pours a translucent amber with a frothy, two inch, cream-colored head. As the head gradually collapses, delicate and consistent sheets of lacing are revealed. Nose expresses all-spice, a hint of ginger and something else that I can't quite put my finger on. Taste consistent with nose; however, a pleasant toasty, malty backbone asserts itself and a suggestion of brown sugar also comes out. Mouthfeel is medium-light in body with a smooth and even carbonation and a light, oily texture - there's almost a silkiness to it. Overall, a very enjoyable pumpkin beer. Flavors coalesce nicely without being overly sweet or cloying. A really nice job for the style I have to say. I'd love to see a variant aged in bourbon barrels."
""
"Vegetal, woody bitterness up front. Spices and malt move in quickly, though. Mulled wine fruitiness (plums, cherries) mixes with cinnamon, clove, and nutmeg. Some caramel/butterscotch flavors come through, along with a little smokiness. Finishes with lingering spices and fruit malt. Medium-full body with a slightly oily feel. Overall not as """pumpkin-y""" as, say a couple of better examples of this style, even though the spices are there. Still, not bad."
""
""
""
"Medium to full bodied with average carbonation. There is an aftertaste of pumpkin pie spices. Overall I like this beer pretty well, but wish the spices would have been toned down somewhat. Worth trying again."
""
""
""
"Overall: Good beer, not the most extravagant pumpkin ale but definitely a keeper this Autumn. I really like the pumpkin ales the give a zest that is definitely needed during the season, this is definitely a top five pumpkin but at the cusp of five. Drink up and you won't be disappointed. Salud!"
""
""
"O - Not a huge amount of pumpkin flavor, but still a really good beer. A darker feel to it than most pumpkin ales I have had. It does need heavier pumpkin and a touch more spice as well in the flavor. Overall a good beer, worth trying, but I would probably swing for a cheaper pumpkin ale that tastes just as good."
"Very tasty and worth a try."
"Good beer, room for improvement though."
"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a deep, vibrant, ruby-copper coloring, almost blood colored, with a thin, dense, frothy, foamy, off-white head of a solid quarter of an inch. Looks delicious. Aromas of roasty sweet pumpkin with a mild blending of cinnamon, nutmeg, and all-spice that smell like pumpkin pie cooking in the next room. Flavors are super-rich, with a solid pumpkin backbone that is roasted and sugary sweet. The spices are highlighting throughout in a sharp, contrasting overtone that keeps the body from hitting the cloying mark on the palate. Roasty sweet and earthy aftertaste, with a rich, smooth, clean finish. Very heavy palate, but very flavorful. If you like Harvest and/or Pumpkin beers, this one is worth a try."
"Overall a nice pumpkin beer to have on a cloudy Fall night though I wish the pumpkin was a bit stronger"
""
"Another one of an avalanche of pumpkin ales this summer, and I mean summer as these started to show up in July. I love this style and enjoy trying as many as I can so it's all good. This one is quite good, appearance is dark copper with a healthy off white head which persists. The aroma is sweet malt and pumpkin pie, and is its strongest feature. The taste is not as complex as the aroma but decent malt forward followed by pumpkin. Mouthfeel doesn't stand out but average. Overall a pleasant surprise from a macro-micro. I'll buy this one again!"
""

"Full in body, a little slick, and warming in the end."
"The spices, pumpkin, and malt come together well in the flavor to give that spiced pumpkin bread flavor I was looking for. The malt adds nice bready and roasty backbone here and the abundant pumpkin is definitely present in the flavor. There is some nice molasses type flavor adding some depth and sweetness here. Those spices really come through beautifully in the finish. There's some pleasant earthiness from the hops. I also pick up some of the alcohol as well. The body is medium to full with strong carbonation. The finish is pretty clean this beer lends itself beautifully to sipping. This is an excellent beer and one I would try again. It's definitely a step up from Harvest Pumpkin Ale."
""
""
"Overall: Very enjoyable seasonal brew, I will buy this again no questions asked!"
""
"Deep mahogany, moderate cap of tan tinted froth, gone quickly. Scent of toaste dark malt, brown sugar, bready yeast, seasonal spice and muted pumpkin. Taste brings malts to the front - toasted, bready, caramel and brown sugar. Pie spices and actual pumpkin quite muted. Slightly boozy. Medium bodied. Decent pumpkin, needs a bit more seasonal kick from spices and pumpkin."

"O- It's just an ok pumpkin ale. Not bad, but probably not worth the price."
"The feel has both crispness and smoothness but leans more crisp with a bit of a bite. It's got an even carbonation in a medium body."
"M&D - super sweet and super smooth, maybe too sweet, but the smoothness is nice and easy to put back, the spices, to me this falls into the same trap as most pumpkin beers, too much spice not enough pumpkin"
""
""
""
""
""
"O - not something I would want all the time but it good enough for a great meal with friends or family in the colder months. Also its a nice take on the style and is different from a lot of weaker, spice oriented pumpkin ales. Cheers!"
"This is a really delicious pumpkin ale. It's not over spiced and the pumpkin comes through nicely. There's a great balance here that most pumpkin ales don't reach. The caramel notes that come through smooth out the spices and offer some drinkability. The ABV is also well hidden. I will definitely return to this as the fall season approaches."

"This is a really good looking beer, deep dark mahogany brown in the glass with a huge rocky light tan head with lots of lace. The smell is dominated by the pie spices (nutmeg, ginger, cinnamon), sweet caramel malt and maybe a bit of chocolate. The taste is of the spices first. Those are backed by the malt which is pretty solid and well rounded with everything from caramels to chocolates represented. There is a bit of hop bitterness in there as well there is little to nothing in the way of hop flavor but the bitterness is there. The finish is relatively clean, just a little bitter, given the heavy spice character, the body is quite full and satisfying and the high alcohol is only very slightly evident at least to start but you'll feel it near the end. Overall this is a pretty good pumpkin ale. It tends to lean on the side of higher spiced versions but the spices are supported by a substantial malt base which makes it quite tasty and a pleasure to drink."
"O: A good idea with a fairly poor execution, but at least it's mildly drinkable. Sam Adams makes quite a few good brews - this isn't one of them. To be fair, this isn't my favorite style, but I nonetheless won't be repeating this one."
"Starts off as a homebrewed brown ale but there is smokiness that shows up quickly and lasts through the aftertaste. Thick body, almost oily; high carbonation. I don't sense """pumpkin""" per se, but this may be because the beer doesn't match the typical pumpkin pie profile. I applaud this. Overall, I like the complexity."
""
""
""
"When I tasted this beer I did not enjoy it at all. I tasted very little pumpkin and more just of smoke and some cinnamon. It reminded me similar to the taste of Samuel Adams Bonfire Rauchbier which tasted just smokey to me. I must say I was disappointed in this one but if you like the smokier taste to beer then you will probably enjoy this. I did not taste much Pumpkin in this one compared to the Sam Adams Harvest Pumpkin which was disappointing considering the price and how it was specially marketed."
"Poured out as a nice looking deep orange hue, a cream colored head on top. The head retention and lacing are moderate. The smell of the beer is spicy, not the best pumpkin spice aroma but still pretty decent. The taste of the beer is smokey, there is a good amount of smoked flavors in this one. The flavors of this are unique mostly because of the incorporation of the smoked malts. The mouthfeel was pretty good, has a nice sharp carbonation to it. The finish was sticky and dry. Overall it's not a bad Pumpkin Ale, not my favorite though either."

"...Fax mentis incendium gloria cultum, et cetera, et cetera... Memo bis punitor delicatum! It's all there, black and white, clear as crystal! You made a terrible beer! You sold me undrinkable swill that I poured into my glass - which now has to be washed and sterilized, so you get nothing! You lose! Good day, sir!"
""
"O: I guess I could have read the label more closely, but I didn't notice the inclusion of smoked malts in this beer. It doesn't completely overwhelm the rest of the flavor palate, but in my opinion it's not a welcome addition to this beer. Even taking the smokiness out, this is a simply average beer. Also, I learned that no matter how good they sound, I think I've gotta stop drinking pumpkin beer...I just don't tend to enjoy them."
""
"Appearance is darker than most pumpkin ales, a deep dark orange with a generous 2 fingers of head. Great retention with decent lacing. Nose is full of pumpkin spice with an emphasis on the allspice. Notes of cinnamon are present with a touch of the actual pumpkin in the background. The taste takes an unexpected turn...the malt profile overshadows the pumpkin qualities that were present on the nose. Lots of caramel malts are there along with mellow cinnamon character. No pumpkin present on the taste. The mouthfeel is moderate with high carbonation. I must say I had high hopes after smelling this brew, but the taste is a bit of a let down."
"O: This is what I think pumpkin beers should be like. Not over-spiced with fake stuff and a little pumpkin, but big and meaty with plenty of pumpkin to give this kind of heartiness and then a little bit of spice for the sake of the season. This is definitely one of my new favorite pumpkin beers. Don't expect one of those novelty """pumpkin pie""" beers, either, because this is definitely not it"
""
"Dark cherry-colored beer with a thick head of foam the color of pumpkin seeds. Aromas of spice, dough and pumpkin. Smells very much like a pumpkin pie. Tastes of sweetened pumpkin and light spices with notes of doughy bread and leafy vegetables. The spices that appear so strongly in its aroma don't carry over in the flavor. Still, this is an excellent autumn beer."
"Clear, beautiful mahogany below a slim, patchy white head. Subtle, spiced aroma: ginger, nutmeg, allspice...the typical pumpkin pie spice blend. A little fruity tartness pops up as well. Lots of toasty caramel flavors, pie spices, dark fruit, and sweet bread. Lightly warming on the way down, but never boozy. Very smooth and on the verge of full bodied. Not exactly pumpkin pie in a glass, but I like that the spices aren't overdone. Good effort."
""
""
"O - A very well done pumpkin beer. I find that these usually go one of two ways: either really good or really bad. This one is in the really good category. The pumpkin and spices make it taste like a piece of pumpkin pie."
"O: a really well rounded pumpkin ale, quite delicious"
""
"O: It's not horrible, just strange balance of flavors. Pumpkin is completely drowned out by unusually strong and uncomplimentary spices in the middle. Most pumpkin beers are very spice heavy but at least they compliment the flavor. This is more of a herbed/spiced beer than a pumpkin ale. Just doesn't work for me, unfortunately."
"Overall - This is a good pumpkin ale, and the alcohol is mostly felt between sips, and more so as it warms. The spice flavor is good, and I do get the pumkin meat, but I feel that a touch more sweetness would really make nice difference, and would really give the effect of a pumpkin ale vs. more of a spiced ale. Definitely worth a try, but a Pumking it is not."
""
""
"Poured from a 22 oz. bottle into a mug. This beer has a nice rusty-orange color with aroung half a finger of cream-colored head. Great smell that promised lots of pumpkiny goodness. The flavor was a little disappointing, though. This really should be called pumpkin spice and not really pumpkin, since the nutmeg was soooo powerful. Otherwise, nice malty sweetness and good finish. I'll probably revisit this one around the holidays, but I won't miss it if I can't find it."
"Overall a good addition to the pumpkin scene. Glad Sam Adams stepped it up a little and released this in compliment to their regular harvest pumpkin. Always been a fan of pumpkin beers."

"I'm not usually a fan of pumpkin beers but this is more of a beer-beer. Poured a 1.25""" beige head of medium life. The clear body is deep burnt sienna brown in masstone but held to the light it's actually a very deep winey amber color. Smells mildly of pumpkin pie spice. The taste carries less of the pie spice than the smell suggested and instead is a rich malt. Body and mouthfeel are full and rich. Quite nice."
"O: I thought this was a much better representation of a Pumpkin beer compared to their Harvest Pumpkin Ale which was watery and weak."
""
""
"O - After Samuel Adam's Harvest Pumpkin beer last year, Fat Jack virtually jumped off the shelf into my pumpkin ale-loving hands, but the beer doesn't live up to my well placed expectations. Looming much closer to a double amber or American strong ale, this beer is a malty beast with a touch of pumpkin to it; not quite carving out that """double pumpkin""" niche. While I find nothing offensive (warming alcohol could be hidden better, however) Fat Jack just doesn't really excite me the way other pumpkin beers do. I will say though, that after a fall of bold pumpkin beers, this one will do wonderfully as a """table beer""" at Thanksgiving, lightly suggesting pumpkin pie; foreshadowing dessert, and pairing well with turkey, mashed potatoes, and gravy!"
"Potent flavor and more spiced than other pumpkins I've had. Pretty good. There are still a couple other pumpkins I'd have before this, but this one is very enjoyable and I would have it again."
"Overall, close to being a really good beer. Its a little to caramel sweet and the mouthfeel is a little off. Addressing those two things and a solid beer exists underneath."
""
"The aroma was the best thing about this beer, (and the cool Tim Burtonish label!) it smells like pumpkin pie! however is tasted like liquid pumpkin pie as well YUCK! (and i really like pumpkin pie) i think the brewers focused far too much on the spices in this beer, having cinnamon, nutmeg, and one or two other spices. I feel the ale would have been much more well rounded if they had only used one or two spices instead of three or four.Flavors in this beer were just far too overbearing, nothing smooth or balanced, maybe overpowering because its a """double pumpkin"""...? Neither me or my beer padawan pal could finish this beer after four or five unpalatable swallows (we tried hard to like it) we ended up both pouring it. dont let your couriosity get the best of you with this one!"
""
"A clear dark brown with a thick tan colored head that laces the glass. Strong ginger, pumpkin and alcohol aromas. There's also some earthy peat in the smell. Flavors follow the aroma...Lots of ginger up front that gives way to a pumpkin, alcohol and smoky caramel malt flavor. The ginger flavor is a bit too much. This is full bodied and a tad syrupy, but it works. Rating it purely as a pumpkin ale, it is above average. Worth a try at $6."

"O-this really is a terrible pumpkin ale. However as a beer, it's not too terrible at all. It to me tastes a lot like a winter Belgian ale of anything, maybe a fall Belgian ale. It's unique for sure. An okay drinker"

"Probably the most drinkable of the imperial pumpkins that I have had. Not a style that I think needs to be imperialized but SA keeps this one in check for the most part. The flavors aren't big but they hit the style. I prefer their non-imperial version."

"22 ounce bottle, Batch #1. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a clear reddish/copper color with an inch light tan head. Head retention and lacing are both good. The brew smells like pumpkins, cinnamon, ginger, and brown sugar. Taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes like pumpkins, cinnamon, nutmeg, brown sugar and a bit of smoked malt. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit oily and it's easy to drink. Moderate carbonation. The 8.5% ABV isn't very noticeable at all. I think this is a good pumpkin beer, I'd pick up this one again. $7.99 a bottle."

"Overall impressed for Sam Adams, nice flavors, good malts, good portion of pumpkin and spices that don't overpower and stay on the quite lighter side, but still let you know they are there, light bitterness and booze, fairly tasty. Its really easy to go overboard on any of the flavors which it doesn't do. If I can complain about anything would perhaps be a bit more overall reddish/brown malts and a bit more bitterness."

"O: Sam Adams has only two lines of beer that interest me: their imperial series, most of which are """good""" and their specialty brew bombers (don't know what they call that line) - and this beer is one of those, and like the others in the line that I've tried, they are also simply """good""" - meaning they are not bad, but I would not buy them over other beers in that style. For example, this imperial pumpkin of theirs is good, but in a few weeks, there will be plenty better to choose from. Always worth a buy and try if you're a pumpkin ale person or a fan of Sam Adams' creations."
"O: Overall, not bad. Lots of flavor mid to late in the taste which threw me off in the beginning. Be sure to drink around 50F, as it tasted better after sitting for ~10min."

"Overall this one goes milder on the pumpkin side and evens it out with a nice malt flavor and it's not too sweet."

"O - Just an excellent Pumkin Beer, one of the best I've had!!"

"O – A very solid pumpkin beer, one of the better ones of the season."
"Pours a very dark copper with a creamy off-white head that settles to a nice cap. Nice aromas of sweet pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg, and the typical Sam Adams caramel malt profile. Taste is similar to the nose, sweet and malty with strong pumpkin flavors and a good amount of spices. Definitely taste like a double version the the regular Pumpkin Ale, that about sums it up. Mouthfeel is smooth and a touch sticky, with a medium-full body and good carbonation. Solid Pumpkin Ale, I'd love to see this bottled next year!"

"Had in Springfield Illinois on tap. Very good beer but one that you can only have one of. Heavy pumpkin flavor but balanced. A good dessert beer and a nice change of pace for Boston Beer. Have had a ton of pumpkin beers this fall and this one is towards the top..right below Pumking from Southern Tier."

"D/O Very good. I am always impressed with Sam Adam's less available beers. 4.5"
"A 32 oz growler from DeCicco's in Ardsley. Nice clear cola color with a decent somewhat creamy light khaki head. Some bits of lace here and there. Smell is roasty with toffee notes. Pumpkin is laced with a fair amount of spice. Some dark bread and dark figgy/plum sweetness. A touch of alcohol too. Taste is a bit forward on the spice but it works with the sticky sweet pie like malt and gourd blend to come across nicely. Broad malt core gives a good bready """crust""" for the pie flavors to ride on. Nutmeg, cinnamon, vanilla, they are all here and in harmony. As I continue with this one and it warms up the flavors really start to come together with a dark roasted pumpkin center and the spices doing a nice job of taming the fusel alcohol bits that come in the finish. The finish is clean and dry with light alcohol twang and faint graham, pumpkin, and toffee sweet brown bread. Quite drinkable in spite of the abv and spicy nature. Overall a solid player, kind of like a spicier, darker, roastier, Pumpking. The $7.99 for the growler really gives this a lot of value and I am considering another for the Thanksgiving weekend. I'll say it again, solid brew."
"Overall: Not too impressed with this pumpkin ale, would have preferred less spices."
"had this again by the bottle, tastes smokey and has a very balanced taste between the pumpkin and the spices"
"For an 8% Pumpkin beer from Sam Adams I was quite surprised! A Mild taste of Pumpkin and a dark amber color made for an enjoyable drink at a Clam Bake. Comparing to other pumpkins I would rank it right in the middle. Better than Blue Moon, Buffalo Bills,Shipyard, and New Holland."
"Ehh, I've been warming to the style in general this fall, but this """2X""" pumkin brew, really is not doing much to impress me...just too sweet and not enough spice..."
"Overall: While I enjoyed the Harvest Pumpkin from the mix-pack, I wasn't too keen on this. It delivers more alcohol and more sweetness, but not all that much more flavor than the standard-strength release, though I'm sure naming it Samuel Adams Slightly A Bit More Than Our Other Pumpkin Ale Ale would've been problematic for printing promotional materials."
"O: No balance in this. Way too sweet, and the alcohol is way too discernable"
"I poured this beer into a glass, it has a dark amber color body with just a little bit of fizzy head. The smell is cinnoman and nutmeg. The taste is sweet of brown sugar, i get some nutmeg, and a hint of pumpkin with some molases in there to. The mouth feel is good and overall this is a good beer."
"If you have the opportunity to try one, definitely do so! Not a beer I could drink everyday, but the best Pumpkin Beer I've had, and definitely the best I've had on tap. It's refreshing to see Bars and breweries embrace Pumpkin beers, and this is one of the better ones!"
"Overall, this is quite a nice beer. The highlights are the taste and the mouth feel. A nice treat by Samuel Adams."
"O: A strong big flavoured pumpkin beer. Sam Adams has made another classic, now only if they would bottle this. Nice to see a pumpkin ale of this quality on the West Coast."
"Like a jack-o-lantern on steroids. The best pumpkin beer I have ever tasted. Glad to see old Sammy coming up with something new and GOOD. Immaculate pumpkin flavor. The beer is darker than your usual pumpkin seasonal, but would you really want it any other way?"
"If you rate above a C for this beer, your membership here should be revoked. (If you do not read the sarcasm in this statement, take a deep breathe and read again...)"
"O: Although I do prefer the complexity of the double pumpkin to SA Harvest Pumpkin, it doesn't handle the blend of pumpkin and high ABV the way Weyerbacher, Southern Tier and DFH do. I'd likely have a couple on a cool night, preferably in front of a fire pit."
"Wow, never thought I'd see a new Sam Adams brew randomly at the Monk. Right on. It pours a murky brown-tawny topped by a finger of dirty cream-tan foam. The nose comprises cinnamon, nutmeg, brown sugar, toasted toffee, clove, and mandarin orange syrup. The taste brings in more of the same, though with a lightly buttery caramel flavor that offsets a decent amount of the spices. The body is a light-ish medium, with a light moderate carbonation, and a lightly grainy feel. Overall, a pretty solid pumpkin beer, slightly better than the usual SA Pumpkin, but the flavor offset hurts it in the long run."
