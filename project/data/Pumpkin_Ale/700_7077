The ice cold transcendence towards the warmer end of a 22oz is my favorite part of the beer. Much like a heavy German beer the flavor changes by the minute.

Spicy cinnamon, cloves, allspice, and ginger are balanced by woody hops. Sage, floral lemon zest, coffee and caffeine. Light vanilla and peach combine with spices to give impression of herbaceous squash, earthy and metallic. Metal on palate with lemon verbena bitterness. Overall, I think the malt presence is too weak in this beer at the moment. Bitter, nutty, astringent, not yet ripe squash that is compensated by heavy spicing, served without butter, lacking decadence and fullness. In the end, this is decidedly just a pumpkin beer masked by hops, spices, and lacking the an integral maltiness. I didn't imagine myself in James's pumpkin version of the giant peach.","orcrist_cleaver","Aug 06, 2014"

Beer stays covered as I imbibe. Smell gives a preview of the excellence in the glass. A big slice of pie with a healthy malt backbone that acts like a graham cracker crust to the lovely gourd caressing my nose with sweetness. Taste is full boat wow. This is without a doubt the best "pie style" pumpkin ale I've had to date. Imagine a perfect slice with a light sweetness. Now add the graham in the nose to cradle it as it fills your mouth. The swallow is bittered well by the hops combined with ginger in such a way that the hops never draw attention to themselves. Some how while being the perfect slice in the glass it is dry and quenching. Crisp light feel with a creamy fullness that is satisfying and sessionable at the same time. This is one easy drinking beer that still manages to be a full on "style" beer. No shirking the pumpkin here. At the same time you just keep filling the glass and draining it. You don't get overwhelmed or tired of it. Wish I had another growler. Superb beer.","scootny","Nov 27, 2013"

Appearance...pale burnt orange, slightly murky. Head fades quickly. Flavor...those spices come fast and furious with a hint of bitterness, giving way to a sweet malt finish. Not sure about any pumpkin coming through but those spices still convince you there’s a pie in there somewhere. Mouthfeel...low to moderate carbonation with medium body. Overall impression?

Aromas of big authentic pumpkin, clove, allspice, caramel, gingerbread, toast, cinnamon, nutmeg, and light herbal. Fantastic aromas with great strength and balance; this smells like I opened a can of pumpkin puree, very authentic. Taste of big pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg, gingerbread, caramel, toast, allspice, clove, and herbal. Minimal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of pumpkin, cinnamon, gingerbread, caramel, toast, allspice, nutmeg, clove, and herbal on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic balance of flavors with a ton of authentic pumpkin; awesome malt/spice balance; zero cloying flavors on the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly slick and lightly syrupy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with nearly zero warming noticed after the finish.

Not that I was time traveling back to the glory days of gladiator fights and chariot races, but a trip I had where an experience left me guessing, forever. So, I'm back at the hostel with a slew of two euro bottles of wine, and run into the other cast members of that week. I happily share my wealth, and drinking breeds more drinking, so we all wander off to a club. This is where somebody drugged me. When I come to, I'm back in my room and see this smokin' girl from Israel right in my face. My shirt is being pulled off. I black out. I wake up in the morning with three chinese girls across the room staring at me and giggling. I was in my bed with nothing on but my underwear halfway up. There was what seemed like dried blood all over the place. All over me, the bed, and the floor. I later found out that this was wine, which was puked up. And, I puked all over the girl and her belongings. What I never found out is what happened. Did she take advantage of me and sex me up without me knowing? I don't know. Where did my clothes go? I don't know. Similar feeling with all these pumpkin beers. I don't know. Don't love em. Don't hate em. Just don't know.","Toddzillamz","Oct 29, 2012"

First off, the brew is devastatingly under-carbonated, an attribute that contributes to a flat, thin flavor and slightly grainy texture. Second of all, the beer smells like the holiday section of Walgreens, only less saccharine. And for the record, I am not against pumpkin ales, quite the contrary. I love the full, hearty, festive flavor of a well-brewed pumpkin. I am also not against Elysian. They make a fantastic Amber, one of the best.

It's full bodied and it kind of leaves the mouth grudgingly. Afterwords, my tongue feels kind of grainy, but it's very silky while the beer is still in my mouth. Tart, caramelly malt with some medicinal hops and pumpkin pie spices all are tied up pretty evenly to make a well balanced flavor. At the finish, there's a sort of green apple sourness. Some parts of the flavor seem Belgian to me, but I can't narrow down why. This is a pretty interesting beer that's difficult to pin down stylistically.

3.87,-1.8,4,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Pours a rich coppery orange color with 2+ fingers of foamy eggshell colored head. Good retention and nice sticky lacing clumps. Smells of honey, grain, floury dough, pumpkin meat, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Tastes of lightly sweetened bread malt, and caramel up front followed by a touch of pumpkin, cinnamon, and all spice and lots of nutmeg. Finishes with some lightly toasted grain and a touch of floral hops. Medium light in body with good carbonation. Malty and smooth with a crisp, semi-dry finish. A good pumpkin ale low in ABV and easy to drink, but the pumpkin and other spices are a little masked by the heavy nutmeg.","HopDerek","Oct 14, 2008"

(Unless of course the pumpkin is mixed in with an imperial chocolate porter) haha. Still a good sessionable fall brew.

3.63,-7.9,4,3.5,4,3.5,3,"Pours copper with a rich cream head. Good retention and a nicely laced glass. Pumpkin in the aroma along with hints of vanilla and spice--mostly clove but some cinnamon and nutmeg. Flavor is rich with pumkin backed by spices with some nuttiness in the middle. Malts kick in--but not quite enough. A slight balance of hop spice in the end but not a "bite" The abv is just over 6 percent but the alcohol warmth is immediate and becomes more pronounced as the beer warms. Pumpkin flavors become more pronounced with warmth as well. This beer is good but slightly watery in the mouth as it seems to be in need of more malt. Its the alcohol that really gets me on this one. Its not something I can drink more than one of because its so warm. Otherwise I did enjoy it and found it to be better than other pumpkin brews.","LunaChick","Sep 26, 2008"
3.78,-4.1,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"22 ouncer, pours clear orangy amber, fine white lace all over the glass afte the head slowly cleared out. Nose is purely of a nice pumpkin pie, mostly about the pumpkin and less about the associated spices. More quality brew from the folks at Elysian. Understated in the approach, this pumpkin infused offering does not over do it spice/pumpkin flavor wise. Nice fall seasonal. Moderate sweetness, moderate hops, more pumpkin essence in the finish. Worth a try if you enjoy the style.","Billolick","Sep 25, 2008"

4.24,7.6,4,5,4,4,4,"D: Overall I found this to be very drinkable. Most likely will jump into a few more before the end of the fall season. At the very least I think having this closer to room temperature is worth a try. The aroma is one of the best I have ever smelled and the taste was quality. Just a little more body and a little more pumpkin taste and this would have been perfect.","erikm25","Sep 17, 2008"
3.75,-4.8,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"The actual pumpkin flavor seems stronger and doesn't seem to have a heavy nutmeg presence. The ale is still quite dry and the malt is perfect for a pumpkin ale, though very carbonated. Boosting up the score a bit.","Gmann","Sep 13, 2008"

3.92,-0.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Had on tap at the Capitol Hill location. Elysian's original pumpkin ale made with real pumpkin, pale, munich, and crystal malts; green and roasted pumpkin seeds, and with the pumpkin in the mash, boiler, and fermenter. Bittered with magnum hops. Spiced with nutmeg, clove, cinnamon, ginger, and allspice. 6.1%, starting gravity of 14.9 degrees plato. Poured amber with almost no head and lightly carbonated. Smells of vanilla, nutmeg, orange, and fresh pumpkin. Taste also has evidence of real pumpkin being used. Nice to find some creamy slightly slick real pumpkin flavors instead of just extracts and pie spice. Light spice on finish as well as a fruitiness throughout. A little thin and slightly undercarbonated, but still nice.","Georgiabeer","Dec 10, 2007"
4,1.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Again very nicely balanced. Drinks like a full flavored english brown with pumpkin pie spices and graham crackers added. A very good approach to the style; get the base right than add the spice. Creamy mouthfeel with light carbonation. Highly drinkable toffee laden, pumpkin beer. One of the better ones I've sampled.","mcallister","Dec 08, 2007"
4.47,13.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Poured beuatifully with lots of carbonation and a small white head. Nose is big pumpkin and spices right away.

3.9,-1,4,4,4,4,3.5,"Not a bad seasonal beer, and a big improvement over the only other pumpkin beer I've had (Shipyard). This might be a decent beer to crack open after a meal, but if you're having pumpkin pie for dessert, it might be overkill. I'm not sure I'd want to drink several of these at a sitting. Still, I enjoyed it as a stand alone beer after lunch while watching football.","woemad","Dec 02, 2007"
3.42,-13.2,3,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"This was the third beer that my wife brought back for me from Seattle. Thought it was a good idea to crack it open on Halloween. Poured it into pint glasses. Had the typical look and smell of pumpkin ales. Did not have a lot of carbonation (a bit of a let down) so not much head. Had a nice taste, but differed from most other brands, as the taste was more pumpkin than spice. The more subtle flavor made this beer very drinkable. This is a great example of the style, but not the best I've ever had.","morebeergood","Oct 31, 2007"
4.33,9.9,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Perhaps the greatest pumpkin ale yet. Jury's out on that, of course, but so far it's my #1 choice. [Addendum: Southern Tier's Pumking now reigns!!! But Night Owl is still wonderful.]","Metalmonk","Oct 31, 2007"

4.42,12.2,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"D: Not too heavily spiced, well-balanced between malty and earthy/hoppy traits, and with some heavier bitter backing notes. All in all, an ale I'll look forward to, year after year. Certainly recommended - although, with a caveat: this is NOT for everyone - will be way too tart and earthy for the spicy-sweet pumpkin ale lover.","msubulldog25","Oct 10, 2007"

3.53,-10.4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"The Night Owl came in a 22oz with no freshness date. It poured a hazy dark orange to amber color. It left some nice sea foam on the sides of the glass which stayed put as you drank it down. The smell was aromatic of more of pumpkin rather than spices which I have seen in a number of pumpkin ales. It seemed to be fairly simple. The taste was good and smooth and a tiny, tiny, tiny bit hoppy. It seemed to be a low carbonated and thin in the mouth. Overall should I stay true to the rating system I will try this beer for 9 years straight and see how it comes out each fall.","cswhitehorse","Oct 01, 2007"
3.68,-6.6,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a brightly glowing orange/amber color with an off-white head featuring tightly compacted bubbles. The foam reduces quickly leaving minimal lacing in a beer clean glass. The aroma is very nice. A lot of pumpkin and spices such as clove, nutmeg and maybe a little cinnamon. It really just smells a lot like pumpkin pie, which is very nice. The taste closely matches the aroma. Loaded with pumpkin and spices, and there's also a black tea-like aftertaste that I'm not sure what to think of. The alcohol is nearly imperceptible. The mouthfeel is soft with very little carbonation. This is my favorite pumpkin ale to date.","jakon","Sep 24, 2007"
3.8,-3.6,4,4,3.5,4,4," Palate is lightly sweet up front, with the pumpkin emerging to provide some depth of flavor. The spices come through at the back of the mouth, lending a mild, herby bitterness on the finish. At the same time, though, this beer is much milder on the spices than most pumpkin ales, quite a favorable character in my eye. Body is smooth with a touch of creaminess. Overall, a quite nice pumpkin ale that favors real pumpkin flavor instead of a large amount of pie spice.","ElGordo","Sep 24, 2007"

4.49,14,4,5,4.5,3.5,4.5,"Even though the aroma is beyond amazing, I still have to give the slight nod to Smuttynose's version as the absolute best. I'm amazed at the quality of this beer and I'm becoming more so with every mouthful. Maybe I shouldn't be surprised since I love Elysian's IPA and ESB.

3.52,-10.7,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3,"My first foray into the fractured margin of the world of pumpkin ales, and I'm just a bit disappointed. Elysian's Night Owl pours a dark, deep orange getting you in the mood for big pumpkin taste. When I take a deep whiff of this brew, it reminds me of the smell of a kitchen when a pumpkin pie is in the oven. The taste doesn't really overwhelm me, though. I was expecting a richer, butterier concoction, but this tastes like a pale ale with pumpkin spices added...","troutmask96","Oct 31, 2005"
