"I was happy with this beer. I didn't really know what to expect, but it turned out to be quite nice. The mix between the lemon and the pumpkin/fall spice is something I've never seen and so it was a unique experience, one that was quite tasty. I would consider getting this beer in August/September as a season-transition beer."

"had this last fall with some pizza was a lot better than expected  better than sam and all the other readily available pumpkin beers out there"
"Overall not quite as bad as I expected, delivers what it expected, plenty of lemonade and lemon shandy, with lots of pumpkin and pumpkin pie spices, although all fake and macro beer like, but despite being decent and delivers what it expects, it's still not very enjoyable and tastes fake. So pound it and move on, or maybe even dump it when I get sick of it soon."
""
"Overall: I don't love pumpkin beer or shandy but combining the two makes them surprisingly palatable. I could easily drink a couple of these. Fairly good overall, though probably not something I would regularly get."

"Delicious. My favorite beer. Looking forward to next fall"

"Great pumpkin flavor and just the right amount of spice."

"was it just me? or is this thing pretty good? never would have thought to do a pumpkin shandy, but the lemonade aspect of this does a lot of the pumpkin, livens it up without the need for fall spices, which i guess makes it pretty unique in the pumpkin beer world. also, are these guys new? this is the first ive seen from them but am indigenous to the area. its clearish and rather orange, strange looking really, especially for what it is. the taste is nice though, slightly tart from the citrus, rich and earthy from the pumpkin, clean in the finish, and indeed refreshing. im not sure the right context for this, as its too fally for hot weather with the squash, and too light in body and high in carbonation for a hearty fall beer, so its sort of stuck in no mans land out in the middle of september or something, but i like it just the same. uniqueness goes a long way with me, and this is certainly that. also appreciably dry instead of sweet like many other shandy types, so that helps it stay sessionable for me."

"From an ABC mixed six - it was terrible.  Poured a brown color almost like it was 'off'.  Very syrupy sweet, like fake lemonade.  Bessie had to finish it for me...."

"Wasn't crazy about this, something about wheat and pumpkin just don't go together. The wheat makes this beer really weird and almost slimy feeling as you sip when combined with the pumpkin. Was burping up pumpkin spice flavor for hours long after I had half a bottle and not in a good way. Just wasn't for me I guess."

"Sweet Pumpkin Pie... Lots of cinnamon mixed in.  Worth looking for."

"O. One of the worst pumpkin beers I’ve had. Don’t bother."

"On tap at World of Beer in Gainesville.  Pours the expected orange hue with a small creamy white head.  Aroma of nutmeg, sweet gourds, and more nutmeg.  I'm not getting much else here.  The flavor follows suit with an overly spiced nutmeg base--just like almost all pumpkin brews--and a little bit of malt sweetness to balance it out.  Thin body, mouthfull of spices feel.  Overall, this is better than the average pumpkin brew I've had.  But that's not saying much."
"Really sweet, and is the truest """pumpkin pie in a bottle""" representation I've ever tasted.  It really does taste like pumpkin pie (with whipped cream, even).  That said, this isn't for all occasions, as the sweetness may be too much."

"Jack-O Traveler Shandy brewed by The Traveler Beer Co. with an ABV of 4.40% This brew pours out a  nice light brown color with a bold white head.  The smell is rich with spices and pumpkin. You also pick up on some sweetness in the smell of this brew. There is a lot going on in the smell of this brew. Jack-O Traveler Shandy taste is different.There is a lot going in this brew.  You pick up on many spices and grains in this brew. This brew is also sweet. It puts you in the mind of cola. There is a lot going on in this brew.  I like how it is different form most pumpkin brews on the market. Jack-O Traveler Shandy has nothing overpowing in it.  The mouthfeel is nice and clean. There is also a sweet aftertaste to this brew.  Overall I'm giving this brew a 4 out 5. I would buy this brew again. This brew is a good drink drew."

"Another disappointing pumpkin seasonal beer.  Light with little taste or aroma of spices.  I'll pass.  Really had no taste."
"Certainly more of a spiced ale than either s pumpkin beer or a shandy, it opens with tons of cinnamon, his with a bit of pumpkin and malt sweetness, then lemon adds contrast, finishing with more pumpkin and some ginger."
"Pored into nonic glass. Half finger head. Dark brown almost reddish. Smelled like a pumpkin pie. Decent carbonation. Spices upfront. Cinnamon, allspice then pumpkin and malt follow. I liked it a little but it looked and smelled better than it tasted"
""
"Have not done a review quite like this one before, but I am just going to cut to the chase. The lemon just doesnt work as far as I am concerned. The pumpkin flavor itself is not bad, but the shandy makes it too sweet. It starts to taste more like a fall version of Mike's Hard Lemonade. If you want a different take on a pumpkin ale, I would recommend New Belgium Pumpkick. While not great, I think the sour tartness from the cranberry is a better spin. This one is fizzy, sweet, and was hard to finish."

"I love pumpkin beers and even though it's still hot where I live it feels like fall to me with a wide selection available right now.  Unfortunately this one let me down.  It is a shandy and the label does not hide the fact that it isn't going to taste like pumpkin ales so I can't accuse Traveler of false advertising.  It certainly isn't bad but there's far too much lemon taste in my opinion.  It tastes like a sweet lemonade swallowed with a mouthful of weak pumpkin pie.  The pumpkin pie taste is definitely there but it's competing too much with the lemon.  It was definitely worth trying because all pumpkin beers deserve a chance but I'll pass on this one next time I'm in the store."

"Delicious, light and refreshing. Perfect fall beer with a sweet addition of pumpkin. Nothing like the traditional pumpkin ales and porters of fall time."

"Pumpkin pie in a bottle. Hints of nutmeg. Perhaps a little over the top/strong, but pleasing.  Nice white head that dissipates quickly."
"O: Slightly sweet for a pumpkin beer but not in the heavy cloying pumpkin pie way but very easy to drink. Much more refreshing than a lot of other pumpkin beers but one that I'm glad I grabbed to try...must be the lemon."
""
"Light carbonated."
"Sickening sweet flavor made the mistake of buying a six pack. Neither the wife or me could make it through one. Ended up pouring the other 4 down the drain."

"Tastes like a pumpkin-nut muffin ... not a bad thing but with a light body, some lemon and prickly high carbonation, this is too much like a wine cooler."

"Very sweet, to much! Very pumpkin pie heavy. Smells great if you wake up Thankgiving morning yearning for a Pumpkin Pie! Did not like the sweetness!"

"I am surprised this works as well as it does.  A bit of lemon really complements the pumpkin spice. This one is over the top pumpkin flavor, but may be their best shandy."

"OK, This is the most interesting pumpkin beer I have had. The color and head, lacing, etc. are fine. The taste is very unique. It has a cold sweet flavor but not too sweet as to be undrinkable. Maybe a little molasses. The pumpkin flavor is very pronounced and it is not masked by a lot of nutmeg or cinnamon which a lot of the other pumpkins have. Overall, nice and drinks like juice more than beer, interesting !!"
""
"This beer tastes like diet coke."

"Overall it had promise its flavors were strange but mild. Worth trying if you love molasses in beer."

"I went with an aggro pour to try and stir up anything that may have flocculated while this was being held in abeyance. I still only mamaged too produce a finger of soapy, tawny head with moderate retention as a result. Color was an orangish-copper (SRM = > 9, < 13) with NE-quality clarity. Nose smelled like pumpkin pie spices - cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice. I did not really get lemon, but that's okay, since it would be kind of out of place. Mouthfeel was kind of thin, which is common to shandys, apparently. The flavors were kind of riotous in the mouth, loads of spices, the lemon peel asserting itself and even a molasses sweet-bitterness. The finish was semi-sweet and the molasses taste overcame the spices in an unexpected twist. This was a curious drink. I may not have liked it as much in the Fall, when I was inundated by Pumpkin Beers, but as an out-of-season break from Summer seasonals, it was pretty good."

"In summation... This was a really enjoyable beer and I recommend picking up a 6 pack during the holidays, maybe just to share with any family and friends who aren't avid beer drinkers. It's good. Try it."

"Such a surprising and fun taste that it's almost a spoil to say that it is alcoholic ( even at less than 5.5%). A really friendly beer, don't take it too seriously because it is meant to be a holiday palate stimulator to get you ready for thanksgiving. Really great for the fall season! Remember to judge it as it is supposed to be judged: a seasonal """candy""" beer low in ABV that is merely supposed to taste good and get your taste buds ready for thanksgiving"

"O- I wasn't sure about the concept of a pumpkin shandy, it was actually better than expected but not something I'd go after again. A different switch up in the pumpkin ale category"
"Overall: A good experiment that I didn't think would work. Better than expected, and refreshing. Drink it fast, though because it is best cold."

"Overall: This is by far one of the best pumpkin ales I have had so far. New favorite for me!"
""
""

"O: Very interesting. You definitely get both the pumpkin beer and shandy aspects. It works fairly well together, surprisingly. Easy to drink, and quite refreshing from the shandy part. Good enough for a single, it's definitely unique and one-of-a-kind"
""
"Overall: Well coming into this, I wasn't really expecting much. The beginning of this was actually not bad at all. Quite impressive. But the further I dove into this, the less interested in it I was. Not bad for a beginner, a let down for others. Nothing really pulled me into this so I gotta finish up with, better luck next time? Cheers!"

"Overall – A quite sweet pumpkin brew that is very easy to drink. A good go to if you are looking for something sweeter and pumpkin flavored."
"Lemon flavors tend to take over the taste as well. For an autumn brew this tastes more like a summer with a little pumpkin, nutmeg, and cinnamon sprinkled in. Cinnamon more so."
""
"Hey, there's a market for Boone's Farm too, so this will appeal to some people's tastes. Unfortunately, not mine."
""
"Overall this is a bad beer. More like an alco-pop."

"Decent shandy. I wouldve never thought I'd dig this."

"O: 4.0 Great Fall beer. The first day this Fall the temp does not exceed 80, this is the perfect beer to enjoy."

"Drank from a 12 oz bottle. First thing that popped out was the nice and pleasant smell. Overall not a bad pumpkin beer, good taste with subtle hint of lemon. Not very bitter or hoppy, in fact not at all. Good body and not too strong of an after taste. This is a decent beer and worthy of being on this website."
