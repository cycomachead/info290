review_text
"Not sure where all of these SPH beers are coming from all of a sudden, but I'm not one to argue, especially when a new pumpkin beer is involved.  This stuff pours a clear golden-amber topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam.  The nose is a blast of thoroughly sweet pumpkin pie spices, all of which are undercut by a strong (and sweet) vein of caramel.  The taste focuses on nutmeg, clove, and brown sugar, with the caramel being replaced by dried maple syrup, draining the majority of the sweetness from the proceedings, leaving only spice, spice, and more spice without any point.  The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel.  Overall, a generally solid pumpkin spice beer, though the heft of the spice on the tongue relative to all else will likely keep me from re-indulging in this during future pumpkin seasons."

"O- the addition of vanilla works well with the spicing, one of the better pumping beers I've had this season"

"this is one of the better pumpkin beers of the year so far for me. it has vanilla in it, which i think is a nice touch. it sweetens up the squash a little bit and makes the spices not seem so dramatic as they sometimes do. the color is just right, rusty amber, and the head holds on nicely. the nose and taste both show the grain first and then the spices and pumpkin later. cinnamon and vanilla are both doses perfectly. it has some body too, it feels like a fall beer, and i think is far better than a lot of the others i experimented with this weekend. my girlfriend liked it a lot too, we may end up with a sixer of this for the week. its really tasty."

"Decent deep pumpkin color, good head and ok lacing. Aroma is of pumpkin pie with spices. Spice and pumpkin blend togrether pretty well to make this seasonal ale balanced. Not too much spice, which is nice and not too overpowering. One of the better pumpkin seasonal ales I have had !!!"

"T/O: For me the flavors are here. Good soft nutmeg, roasted squash to give it some pie crust flavor, flaky biscuits, lots of vanilla. It tastes like a good pumpkin pie. Solid pumpkin with spicy cinnamon on the aftertaste. However, the taste seems incompatible with the mouthfeel, which rushes the flavor profile. Warming doesn't seem to take the pop feel out of it. Sad, because it comes across as good balanced pumpkin pie flavor, not too sweet with a good amount of bitterness from the squash. It looks light, feels light, and makes light of full aroma and flavor."

"Southampton Pumpkin would be a good beer if the flavor profile was missing the mineral water astringency and aspirin-like bitterness in the finish. Maybe this could have been masked with more vanilla or heavier spicing? With so many other great pumpkin offerings, it would be hard to justify coming back to this again."

"Beer is medium-light to light in body, with carbonation of medium intensity, leading to a mouthfeel that at first borders on fizziness, but never reaches it, quickly calming to a fully foamy and smooth mouthfeel that's rather enjoyable. Closes semi-dry, with light stickiness clinging to the palate and lips."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, Fall 2013 bottling. Pours lightly hazy orange copper color with a 1 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg, gingerbread, toast, clove, brown sugar, toffee, light vanilla, and toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of pumpkin, spice, and malt notes; with good strength. Taste of pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg, gingerbread, toast, clove, brown sugar, toffee, light vanilla, and toasted earthiness. Lingering notes of pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg, gingerbread, toast, clove, brown sugar, and light toffee on the finish for a short bit. Good balance and complexity of malt, spice, and pumpkin notes; with decent flavor robustness and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and moderately crisp mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very good pumpkin ale. Lacking some robustness of flavors; but has very well balanced flavors and is a nicely enjoyable pumpkin ale offering."
""
""
"Pours bright copper, big bubble white foam with full settling out. Light pumpkin nose with backing brown sugar. Taste is a light, watery, pumpkin malt. Cinnamon/nutmeg blended in, but very mellow. Just a touch on the sweet side. Average for pumpkin beers."
""
""
"O - I was really excited from the smell but overall disappointed after that. The flavor needed to be heavier and with more depth and I would prefer the body to be heavier. Unfortunately it is another mediocre pumpkin ale to add to the list."
""
"Great beer. Not crazy pumpkin, but self limiting. Clearly made by talented brewer's who wanted to say 'pumpkin' but not throw it in your face."
""
""
""
""
""
"o: a good pumpkin beer, but nothing mind blowing. i'd recommend picking it up and giving it a try - its nice and mellow, with a rustic pumpkin flavor, and not overly spiced. nothing offending here. could use a little fuller flavor"
""
"O: My least favorite pumpkin brew in a long time, due mostly to a collection of off-flavors and its thinness. Sorry to say, but this now inhabits the lower bound for pumpkin ales, as far as my experience goes (beating out the longtime contender, Sam Adams Harvest Pumpkin)."

"A pretty good pumpkin ale and one that I recommend. The beer is certainly different than most other ones on the market and if you're looking for one that resembles pumpkin, then this is the one."

"Atmosphere is pretty good. Nice head, and some fair lacing. Nose is characteristic pumpkin and fall spice. Harsh in its presentation, but tastes like it smells. Overall, this is a pretty good quaff."

"O- Pretty disappointed with this. I kind of expected better from Southampton."

"O: It's a pretty solid pumpkin beer but it's not something that wows me. I think it could be a lot better but it's not something I would regret buying. I would easily pick up a sixer of this without a second thought. If you can't find any other better pumpkin beers, you won't be at a disadvantage drinking this. It's a good enough beer that I am going to look for more beers from this brewery to try!"

"12oz bottle thanks mike67. Pours an orange amber with a small short lived beige head. Aroma and Taste of sweet mild pumpkin spices. Some light cinnamon, nutmeg, caramel malt and a bit of grassy notes. Palate is a medium body with good carbonation. Finishes with some mild pumpkin spices, caramel malt a bit of grassy notes and caramel malt. An ok brew to try, once is enough"

"While pumpkin ales make for a nice diversion, the whole style seems more gimmick than true craft. Still, this is enjoyable when one is in the mood during the season. Unlike other seasonal offerings; for me, Pumpkin Ales are only enjoyable during their season."
""
"D - Not bad, it is a pretty standard pumpkin ale but a little dryer than most. Might work a little better with a touch more sweetness."
"Overall: this is simply a pumpkin ale as expected. nothing memorable for a good or bad reason."
""
""
"A solid take overall. Nice balance of spice, malt, and pumpkin. It drinks like a beer and tastes like a pumpkin beer should. It's not the best or the boldest, but sometimes that's ok."

""
""
"O: Good pumpkin beer – worthy of a try."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the flavoring. While at times it bordered on cheapness, the heavy spice more than made up for it. That being said, things were a bit one-dimensional, and the drinker was left wanting a bit more in the way of big aromatics and thicker, heartier feel and froth on the lips."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Nothing special. I could drink it but I'd rather risk something I haven't had or go to one of the many other better October/pumpkin beers"
""
""
"All in all a mediocre pumpkin ale. I've tasted better."
""
"Less cider, smoother balance."
""
"O:  Im pretty sure this was infected due to the high acidity and tartness. Most pumpkin beers fall short of expecyations of a warming fall harvest brew that should be roasty, rich and have substance. This is yet another watered down pumpkin beer. It had all the flavors and the up pumpkin was the sure frontier, but it's too thin. This is one on the don't revisit list. Sorry Southampton. "
""
""
""
""
"Aroma has a malty core with firm pumpkin, cinnamon and cloves notes. Pours a somewhat hazy copper-amber, almost a pumpkin color, with a decent pale wheat head. Flavor has a malty core with subtle notes of pumpkin and cloves plus hints of cinnamon. Texture has OK body and fizz, not great but still acceptable. Overall, a decent it not top-of-the-line fall brew."
""
"Overall the beer seems to be lacking the malty backbone of other pumpkin ales, allowing the pumpkin to come through. I found the pumpkin to be well balanced with the other spices. For someone like me who isn't the biggest fan of a strongly malty taste, I ended up enjoying this beer despite being unsure on the first couple sips."
"Poured a 12 oz bottle into a standard pint glass,a fuller but not quite as deep as burnt orange color with a half finger white head that lasted well.Warming pumpkin pie spice aromas with nutmeg and cinnamon dominating,a bit of toastiness undereath the spice complimented it well.Like to many of the style for me it's a little too spiced on the palate,cinnamon,nutmeg,and orange-like cardamom flavors over top of a lightly toasted base,it's not overly sweet just a bit over spiced.Not a bad pumpkin ale but not something to drink alot of because it gets a bit to spiced...in my opinion."
""
"Pours a deep reddish amber color with a two finger head which leaves some lines of lace. The aroma is of cinnomon and pumpkin. The taste starts out with some cinnomon and spice before a medium size pumpkin flavor comes in. The pumpkin flavor is good but not over powering. The end there is a very good vanilla flavor. The mouthfeel is a little thin. Overall this is a solid pumpkin beer, I enjoyed this and will seek it out again."
""

""
""
"D/O: Not what I remember. Not sure if this beer has changed, my taste has changed, or if I was foiled by a sugar-rimmed glass in a great pub with great friends a few years back. It's thin and watery, and full of more """pumpkin pie spice""" and """vanilla extract""" than it is """pumpkin"""."
"O: This beer is easy to drink with pumpkin pie flavors that are not overbearing and a moderate ABV. Enjoyable and certainly a beer I would have again. Not overly sweet like some offerings in this style."
"Overall, it's a fairly decent rendition that builds up anticipation with its good looks and smell, but fails to deliver on what's initially expected. Instead, leaving with you with a good, though not great, autumn beer."
"So-so pumpkin beer. Almost lager-y. Heavy-handed with the pie spices. Many I'd drink before this one. 3.0"
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste was the same. Cheap, party keg taste. It was like someone took pumpkin spice from a Starbucks and sprinkled it atop of a Natty light. It was this beer's only saving grace but it left me highly disappointed. And I'm hard to disappoint when it comes to beer. ANY pumpkin beer I've had so far has been better"
"Pie + ice cream = very good. The addition of beer does nothing to diminish the equation."
""

""
""
"Pumpkinhead is more desirable than this and that's not something that I usually say. Check that one out or go for the imperials."
"12 oz bottle. Pours amber with a long lasting off-white head. Aroma is of citrusy hops and caramel malt. Body is medium and smooth. Taste is sour (infected?), pumpkin seeds, some hops and spices. This brew is bordering on undrinkable. Probably the bottle was bad."
""
"Mouthfeel is nice- medium light body, light to moderate carbonation, slightly sweet finish. I don't like pumkin beers ordinarily but I have enjoyed this grower. I would recommend this over shipyard or any of the others I tried."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Good, but not great. The spice flavors seem right, but it seems like it's needing/missing some stronger pumpkin flavors. Well done but not overdone! I think I just found a new beer to add to my Pumpkin Pulled Pork!"
"O: Slightly unimpressed. They can do much better and for all I know this is the same run of the mill pumpkin beer that they have been making for 10 years. I think its time to step it up a notch here and increase the body."
""
""
""
"OK, COULD DO BETTER!"
"O: A decent pumpkin ale, but nothing to write home about. Maybe I'm a little too used to the bigger pumpkin ales that come out this time of year, but I really want a little more spice presence in the flavor of my pumpkin ales. Nice drinkability to be sure, though. I would have it again if I am craving a sessionable fall seasonal."
""
""
"O: I prefer imperial pumpkins - so there's my bias; that said, this is an average beer - if you like low abv, vegetal pumpkin ales, this might be spot-on for you - if you don't, it probably won't win you over."

""
""
""

"D-Overall this is a drinkable beer but its supposed to be a pumpkin beer and i feel like this is a watered down version of one. No off flavors in this just not enough good flavors to make me get another glass. Its still a decent pumpkin ale but not one ill be reaching for again next october."

"I think this is it for me and pumpkins this year. Pours orange-y amber with slight haze. Decent sized head recedes immediately with little trace and no lace. Smells good pumpkin pie spices, good malt character and trace of the vanilla extract. Tastes like a good pumpkin beer, I'm picking up some pilsen malt, a nice honey/grainy character. Good pumpkin stuff out of Southampton, enjoyed thoroughly."
"D: Very drinkable. Could be a great fall session beer."
"The feel is a little too thin. High carbonation so it feels lighter on the palate."
"Medium body, pretty high carbonation, prickly and lingering on the tongue. Not bad for a pumpkin beer, captures the spice and season without turning into an overspiced or oversweet mess."
"Overall: A unique pumpkin beer. Drinkable, but has a unique smell/taste that I just can't place. Different than any other pumpkin beer I've ever had."
"Out of the bottle it has a copper color with a slight tannish foam head that leave a descent amount of lacing. Mild cinnamon scent to it."
"D/O- One of, along with DFH's Punkin, the most balanced Pumpkin Ales available. The spices never become over-powering and sweetness is nowhere near as cloying as some of the Imperial versions of this style. That being said, I still couldn't have more than two of these in one sitting. If you enjoy a more balanced Pumpkin, definitely give this beer a try. Recommended. Cheers."
"Authentic aromas, easy to drink, and with just a touch of sweetness & spice - all lead to this being a winner. Not my favorite, but one that I'd recommend nonetheless."
"O: I have been making a tour of pumpkin beers of late. Southampton's beer is enjoyable, but it is not complex. There is some nice pumpkin, a bit of of nutmeg and cinnamon, and some zing from the carbonation. If you prefer to taste more spice in your pumpkin beer, you will not find it here. Instead, you should expect more roasted pumpkin notes."
"This beer was tasted on a late September night out of a bottle. I found this beer more dark and deep in color than your average pumpkin beer. There was a strong presence of spices such as cloves and cinnamon, rendering this beer more like pumpkin pie as opposed to natural pumpkin. On the negative side, there seems to be more of a artificial taste to this."
"Pours a deep burnt orange, almost brown in appearance. The nose is more vanilla and nutmeg than pumpkin. Taste is the same - not very much pumpkin, but rather the spices that one may put into a pumpkin pie. Unlike some BAs, I do not mind pie spice in my pumpkin beer, but there needs to be pumpkin in it to balance the spices - this is lacking here. This beer also had an oddly acidic finish that was not terribly pleasant."
"O: The head and lacing was disappointing. The flavor was lacking solid malt backbone and hops that the Smuttynose had. The mouthfeel was also not as smooth or thick as I would have liked. Overall, not bad, but not great."
"Disappointing, particularly after having at least 3 fine 2011 pumpkin ales from other brewers."
"Overall, average fall pumpkin."
"Morey's Bottom Line: The color is beautiful, but the lack of a head/lacing is hard to ignore. I'm glad that I decided to purchase only a single bottle as opposed to an entire 6 pack."
"Really nice pumpkin ale."
"This poured out as a nice looking amber color with a fizzy white looking head on top. The smell of the beer had a decent amount of autumn spice on the nose. The flavor of the beer was spicy upfront and then faded into a sweet caramel aftertaste. The mouthfeel was pretty good, plenty of carbonation to it and a nice medium body also. Overall this brew is pretty good, it's not my favorite pumpkin brew but not a bad one at least."
"O - I typically enjoy the pumpkin pie variety of pumpkin ales. This one is nice, not a lot going on in the spice department, but if you're looking for a malty, chilly night brew with some spice notes, this one isn't bad."
"Pours a nice amber-orange with at least two fingers of fluffy white head. The nose and taste are both relatively subtle and not overpowering. Pumpkin leads the way with a good amount of cinnamon and nutmeg behind it, a long with a bit of brown sugar. There's also a bready touch from the malts, which give the impression of a nice amber base beer. Light body with medium carbonation make this beer very drinkable. Nothing in this beer is over the top or in your face. It retains a lot of the base beer's characters and never gets too heavy or sweet. Definitely enjoyed this one."
"O - a great rendition of a pumpkin ale and one ill definitely pick up again."
"Big fall spices with pumpkoin and malt flavor throughout. It has more of a presence of a lager with lower carbonation, to be honest. Not a bad, pumpkin beer though."
"M- Smooth and spicy, nice dry finish. Medium coating to palate. Bright acidity with medium carbonation. Finish is nice and spicy with a great lingering spicy flavor."
"This beer looks like a pumpkin ale and smells like a pumpkin ale, but the taste is way off. There is some spices there, but I cannot get past this vegetative quality. It tastes like beef vegetable soup to me. The mouthfeel is good, but for me the taste is not good. They may have tried to use the pumpkin too much and not enough spice to back it up."
"Nice looking brew, pours an oktoberfest-like colour, orange-ish and coppery. Not a huge head, some tracing down the glass. Scents of floral pumpkin, nutmeg, cinnamon...etc. Tastes a lot like the scent, but could use a bit more pumpkin spice. A bit thin, very enjoyable however, and easy to drink. Very easy to drink. Nothing offensive and not sweet, like some pumpkins can be. The scent of this beer being remarkable, and a good beer, but there are better pumpkin ales. But definitely worth a shot!"
"The taste is as close to drinking pumpkin pie as you can get. I have tried every pumpkin ale I could find, this is by far the closest to what I would like in a pumpkin beer."
"Poured a hazy medium orange/brown with and average sized off white head that was mostly diminishing and had poor lacing. The aroma was heavy of cookie malts and a sweet yeast with strong notes of nutmeg, cinnamon and brown sugar. It tasted slightly bitter/sweet at first but ended with a really nice bitter/sweet/malty flavor with nice hints of nutmeg, cinnamon and pumpkin that was left lingering on the tastebuds for a really nice long while. Mouthfeel was light in body and kind of watery in texture yet nice and creamy on the back end. Overall a very nice tasting pumpkin ale that left me wanting a slice of pie."
"I look forward to returning to PA to try something else from Southampton."
"Notes: In my overall impression is that this is a very well made and well balanced pumpkin ale."
"D: enjoyed this one, not a string pumpkin taste, the bottle says """brewed with pumpkin, spices, and vanilla extract""" but i could not taste or smell any vanilla and the pumpkin again was minimal"
"D: I prefered this one, and would recommend it as a starter for hoilday beer. Don't think i could it in the summer but that fll or winter day, anytime."
"Good pumpkin but not the great pumpkin."
"very drinkable, all autumn long and into the winter"
"D: I'd skip it."
"Pours hazy amber with a small, dense sticky and lacy head. The aroma is good, strong and cinammony. The flavor, however, is flat and spicy, with a disappointing lack of sparkle or vibrancy. The spice is dull and heavy and the mouthfeel is thick and dry. Very disappointing"
"This beer pours a nice amber with a large frothy off-white head that slowly dissipates leaving a fair amount of lacing behind. The smell is most definitely pumpkin, but also with some lighter malts present, maybe Munich/Vienna. The taste mirrors the aroma to a large degree. The pumpkin spice comes across well, not too in your face, but enough that you can taste it easily, especially in the after taste. This beer has a nice light mouthfeel, but still feels like it's able to coat your mouth with its pumpkin flavor. While this beer is tasty, it's such a specific flavor that I don't think I could drink more than a few of these, and even then only in the right season. Overall, though, a pretty good beer."
"The body is medium to light with abundant carbonation. The feel is slick throughout, until the finish where it dries out. Very drinkable with abundant satisfying flavors, touche."
"Pours a nice, moderate orange color with a white head and a bit of lacing on the way down. The nose brings forward some sweet pumpkin as well as cinnamon, clove, allspice, and a little bit of brown sugar. The taste is sweet pumpkin and light brown sugar as well as a good dose of spicing. Nice, creamy mouthfeel. Drinks really quite well for what it is."
"D/M: Subtle carbonation that helps bring out the aromas. It is very balanced with the amount of alcohol and really does not overwhelm. Great to enjoy a few of these."
"D - this is one of the better pumpkin beers I have had. As noted above, the malt profile is way more forward than the spices in this. I really enjoyed this and wish it was available in my area. Thanks BogleHill for the chance to try this!"
"I can say this was my least favorite pumpkin ale of 2010."
"Pours a nice golden orange with a fluffy white head. Very good retention and a bit of laceing. Aroma is of Pumpkin,spices and brown sugar.Medium bodied,crisp and carbonated. Taste is of pumpkin with hints of dark fruits. Spicy through out. Very nice."
"Flavor is malty and dry, some cinnamon in the back end, and toasted pumpkin flavors up front. It's fairly transitory and doesn't linger long on the palate. Feel is a little seltzer like and plain. Some maltiness lingers, with spartan touches of squash and cinnamon. Overall it's very clean, dry and utilitarian. Not a spice bomb thankfully, but it could use a bit more oomph to it also."
"It may be my nutmeg bias, but the heavy reliance on it was this beer's downfall for me. I don't feel it brings a lot more to the table. Not for me, thanks."
"Drinkability: This is a nice pumpkin ale that I'm enjoying sipping and would be fine with having another (which is not always true with pumpkin ales even when I enjoy them). I certainly would not mind having this one again in the future. I thought this a very good beer in that it shows off both the spices and a touch of hops."
"M/D: Medium bodied, with a little but too much carbonation for my taste. It sort of had a soda like texture to it. Not bad, but certainly not great. Would pass for other pumpkin beers."
"d-this beer has good overall combination of flavors and aromas that welcome you in and invite you to have more than just one"
"I felt lucky to have been able to go to the publick house while the pumpkin ale was one tap. I may even make the 1.5 hour drive back to Southampton just to pick up a growler. Best part of drinking the pumpkin ale was the rich and delightful aftertaste that reminded me of thanksgiving pumpkin pie."
"D- Very enjoyable to drink. Not a beer that should be pounded."
"Pours a light amber/orange color with moderate poof of soapy white head. Scent is light yet notes of sweetness and well balanced pumpkin pie spices. First sip is creamy sweet, well balanced notes of nutmeg, cinamon and clove with a good solid pumpkin background. Medium bodied, slightly creamy. Well balanced between pumpkin pie and fall spices, no overpowering ingredients, very drinkable. A good all around pumpkin for all crowds."
"D: The beer is very easy to drink and is quite sessionable."
"I've noticed 2 types of Pumpkin Beers. Ones that taste mostly like a """Pumpkin""" and those that Taste like """Pie""". I do like the spicy Pie beers myself, and this one is a great one. Hazy, deep amber with a thin cream colored head that seemed to stick around. A mild pumpkin aroma, with some cinnamon, nutmeg, and a delicate spiciness along with a toasty, caramel maltiness, Vanilla, and fruit?. Flavor is of slight pumpkin, pumpkin spice, Mouth feel is medium bodied, and though the spice and malt are present, it is generally clean, with a nice hop bite rounding out the finish. This one reminds me of Weyerbacher Imperial Pumpkin Ale. Delicious."
"Drinkability: The bottle describes this beer as not wanting to be over the top. This beer starts with a bang really sweet, but fades just as quick. With the light spicing, the beer becomes bland as the spices fade too quickly and what is left is a light marzen beer. I think with some tweaking this has potential to be really good. However, I have had better from the brewery and in the style. I would pass on this in the future."
"Clear, medium amber in colour with an off-white cap. It definitely smells like a pumpkin ale -- pleasant spices, nutmeg and allspice, cinnamon, malty sweetness and earthy gourd. Quite nice. The flavour was good, but it could have used a bit of extra malt to the fill out the flavour, a bit more biscuity perhaps. Solid, lingering bitterness beneath the pumpkin and spices, more nutmeg and cinnamon. Decent texture too. Medium to light bodied with average carbonation. I liked this beer and appreciate the flavour of pumpkin + spices rather than spices on their own."
"Overall...I can drink it particularly when a little warmer, but I don't want a bunch of them."
"I poured the beer into a pint glass, it has a nice light brown color to it with a 1""" white head, that lay down to a thin lace around the edge. The beer has a nice aroma of cinnamon, nutmeg and a hint of pumpkin. The beer has a nice taste of pumpkin pie spices to it and the nutmeg hits the back of the tongue, which is very nice i think. This beer is very smooth and is very drinkable. I would say if you want a good pumpkin ale than you should try this one."
"Cheers..."
"d - A pretty good pumpkin ale. Not my favorite, but something I would drink again. Kind of heavy on the spices in this one."
"Impression: The first pumpkin beer I've been able to say that I will def. get it again. You should try it."
"Maybe this is a great example of pumpkin beer done right, I don't know, but it's not a great example of beer."
"A pretty good pumpkin beer. It has good mixture of pumpkin and spice flavor without being underwhelming or over the top."
"D-not as good as some pumpkin beers I have had, but better than many others. Not bad, but not great"
"D - A highly drinkable pumpkin -I could see have several over the cours of a holiday meal or watching the game. I consider this one of the best since there is a sense of control on the part of the brewer to use the spice without letting it take over."
"And the pretty much beefed all that! It does taste pretty good as a beer (despite the metallic backbone) but never works as a pumpkin beer! More spice!"
"The aroma is sweet and spicy with pumpkin and malt. The appearance is dark amber with a foamy head. The taste is like the aroma but a bit chemical like. The palate is super smooth. Overall this is a better than average beer and pretty good but not my favorite pumpkin beer."
"D-the more you drink, the more bland it becomes, I ended up racing through this one just to get it over with"
"D: Fairly drinkable at 5.5% abv. Surprisingly not much lighter than the ST Pumking. However, this isn't meant to taste like pumpkin pie, and after trying about 5 different pumpkin beers, this only falls short of the pumking, and at 9% abv and very sweet, that is a whole different beast."
"D-This is a very drinkable beer, and an excellent pumpkin ale. It does not have the richness or the body and complexity of a Pumking or and Imperial pumpkin, but it may be one of the best sessionable pumkins I have had in along time. I love the style, and I very much like this brew."
"D - Absolutely drinkable. I may carry a couple around in the wagon while thee kids trick or treat this year!"
"Better than Shipyard's pumpkin."
"Pours a hallows amber with tints of orange. Smells of the usual nutmeg, allspice, and a nice dose of vanilla. Tastes right up there for a pumpkin ale. Not quite on the smuttynose dogfish level but one or the more solid offerings. I'm adding this to my list of go to pumpkin ale's."
"All in all this is one of the better pumpkin beers I have tried. Like most, it lacks flavor but has a great aroma. If I saw this next to a Pumpking or Punkin then I would have to pass."
"This drinks okay, but pretty average for the style. I like to actually taste some pumpkin/squash flavors & more abv"
"3.0 D: Every pumpkin beer I've had other than ST and DFH's have been a disappointment and this is no different. Easy going down, but mouthfeel sucks and taste isn't as good as it could be."
"D: Very good, but flavor not as bold as I would have liked. Still solid, and a very drinkable pumpkin ale."
"The beer poured from the bottle to reveal a medium copper color with little head and lacing. There was a nice crisp aroma of pumpkin, nutmeg and alspice. The mouthfeel was very light. The taste is light pumpkin followed by nutmeg. The taste isn't overly strong as with some of the type. The is the easiest drinking pumkin beer I have tried and one of the better in the category."
"D - ok pumpkin beer, but pretty standard when compared to others"
"F: Finishes pretty dry and with quite a bit of saison characteristics. Some light spices start the finish but fade quickly. A slight fruity malty taste seems to reveal itself again after the spices fade. It actually finishes very clean. It's a really nice take on a pumpkin beer. Almost like a Belgian Saison pumpkin and cherry beer. Lots of great flavors kept light and tasting great. I really like this one and might be one of my fav pumpkin beers now. I should try to stock up."
"Taste: warm, pumpkin pie spiciness and not much else. Very mild body, moderate carbonation, short finish. Body is a bit too lean, needs more of everything. Little malt flavor, little pumpkin flavor. Apparently, vanilla extract is in here, too, and, I guess...huh...pretty limpid,actually, needs more of everything."
"One of my favorite pumpkin beers that has just enough pumpkin flavor and spices to not be watery. Great orange red color. Nose is better than pallet which is a let down to some, but as my first official fall beer to the season I liked it. Pumking is better but this will do."
"Pours a clear orange/amber with a medium tan head. Smells, well like a pumpkin pie! Also a bit of caramel malt smell as well. Taste is surprisingly sweet up front, followed by a spicy vanilla and cinnamon middle, and a dry, bitter finish. Very nice. Mouthfeel is a tiny bit watery though, but carbonation levels are nice. Quite drinkable, this is a very good pumpkin ale, that is not overloaded with spices, and has actual pumpkin flavor. Recommended."
"D: Very flavorful and good pumpkin flavor without being overbearing."
"Liked brews from this brewery in the past, time to try their fall seasonal. Aroma is of nutmeg and little bit of pumpkin, not overpowering though. Taste is pretty good, a bit on the light bodied side, decent mouthfeel. I do like how the pumpkin isn't too strong here.. some nice nutmeg and cinnamon notes in there as well. An above average pumpkin ale for sure but doesn't hold a light to some of the best pumpkin's out there."
"D - Very drinkable and light due to low ABV."
"D - A little more in terms of body and moutfeel would have gone a long way and added exponentially to the overall enjoyment of this brew... As it is, its a very average pumpkin ale... I've had much worse... I've had much better... I would gladly drink again, but this is not one I'll seek out each autumn (or late summer since these pumpkin brews seem to come out earlier and earlier each year)..."
"D: Easy to drink during football games on a sunday. A very nice fall beer, especially if you enjoy pumpkin."
"Soft carbonation up front with lots of sweet pumpkin pie flavor as well as hints of brown sugar, cinnamon, clove, ginger, nutmeg, vanilla ans some subtle apple cider notes. ABV very well masked. The mouthfeel is slightly watered down but otherwise this tastes like liquid pumpkin pie. One of the better examples of the style."
"D- Very drinkable beer. Lighter body, carbonation, and good flavor"
"Taste the pumpkin and spices up front. Subsequent mouthfuls are dominated by the hop bitterness and a kick of carbonation. The bottle says it is spiced, but not too heavily to make it more drinkable. They accomplish their goal, but when you're drinking a pumpkin beer the spices are not a detriment to the beer if the beer behind the spices is good, and you can still taste the beer behind the spices. This beer could have done with a little heavier spicing and still would have been really good."
"Overall this is a solid pumpkin beer however it doesn't quite have the body to make it great. Still, it's worth a shot."
"Poured a clear orange body with decent head that had a spicy, cinnamon and pumpkin smell along with some sweet malts. Medium body with a noticeable amount of spice but has a great sweet balance of cinnamon, nutmeg and pumpkin that goes down easy.So far this is my #1 Pumpkin ale that I enjoyed."
"Poured a clear orange body with decent head that had a spicy, cinnamon and pumpkin smell along with some sweet malts. Medium body with a noticeable amount of sharp, peppery clove and spice but has a great sweet balance of cinnamon, nutmeg and pumpkin that goes down easy. Very sessionable pumpkin ale that I enjoyed."
"Pours a golden orange color with a one finger head that fizzes out quite fastly and leaves no lacing behind, making this one look like juice more than beer. Smells of nutmeg, pumpkin, some sour, and malts. Fades to pure malts eventually it seems. Tastes of pumpkin, nutmeg, malts, and spices. Taste is kind of weak on this one. Mouthfeel is watery with decent carbonation, smooth beer with no alcohol warming, the water is killing it here. Drinkability is decent, the taste is alright, the price was alright, probably wont get it again, not bad flavors to kill the beer because it is kind of weak in itself."
"Admittedly, this is probably my absolute least favorite style of beer but this one is loads better than the plethora of other over-spiced pumpkin ales that inundate the market this time of year."
"D- Overall a nice pumpkin ale with a great aroma and a good flavor."
"This is as good a mass-produced pumpkin ale as I have tasted and I've tasted a few I definitely did not care much for. Good job Southampton."
"This is a nice & tasty brew, great example of the style in my opinion, and very easy to drink with even a slight warming quality."
"Overall, not a great first experience with Southampton. This could be infected, or I could be interpreting this very wrong, but it just didn't do it for me. Still, I'm glad I got the chance to try it, Thanks Joe!"
"Overall - Not bad at all. Its a very solid pumpkin beer. I'd say its exactly how the brewer describes it. Definitely worth picking up a bottle if you're into pumpkin beers."
"Drinkability: One of the finer pumpkin ale's I've had this Fall. Balance is the name of the game with this one, the spice and the pumpkin work very well together in this brew. Although it's a bit thin in texture, the a fine brew I'll be looking for again."
"One of the pumpkins I would return to, along with Smutty's, Fisherman's PStout, and Capt. Lawrence's offering (draft only), depending on my mood. In this case, the mood would be considerable spice without hop flavor and still a pronounced pumpkin presence. Say that three times fast."
"D: """The difference... is drinkability""". Highly drinkable and enjoyable though rather bland in terms of complexity. A good session beer to have though as it doesn't overwhelm the palate but is still intriguing enough to peak some interest."
"D - goes down easily, but not a style of beer that I can have too many of."
"D: This is a pumpkin beer that I think would be best with food, maybe something like, I don't know, pumpkin pie? The alcohol presence made it a sipper, but I feel with a nice slice of pie I could put a few of these down. I'm sure the beer would lose some sweetness in the pairing, but I think it would be a nice counterpoint. Sounds like I need to experiment and report back."
"So, based on these new impressions, I have upped the score a wee bit."
"D - I am not enjoying this, will not buy or drink another."
"This beer pours a clear, dark amber/burnt orange color with a two finger white head. No lacing to speak of. The nose is pumpkin pie all the way! Cinnamon, clove, and nutmeg, with hints of pumpkin and malt make up the nose. Nicely done without any one spice overly dominant. Taste is sweet up front with pumpkin and caramel malts the first to hit your tongue. The clove, nutmeg, and cinnamon fill out the middle and finish to it. There is a bit of a sweet yet bitter aftertaste to it. Light to medium body, medium carbonation, goes down easily, somewhat oily, with a creamier finish to it. I am a fan of pumpkin ales. If you like pumpkin ales, this is one to sit with for a bit."
"D: At 6% ABV this is no lightweight pumpkin ale. That said, I made a nice little session out of it and found it to be just the right blend of sweet, spice and authentic pumpkin flavor for an autumn ale. Not overbearing and not artificial, this pumpkin ale is as close to that traditional colonial ale as I can recall."
"Drinkability: I hate when you get a pumpkin ale and it really is just a shot in the dark, whereas you get too much spice and not enough pumpkin flavorings. Southampton pulled off their pumpkin brew perfectly, combining just the right amount of spice to compliment huge pumpkin flavors, excellent aromas, and a smooth yet dry mouthfeel that succeeds all across the board. Besides DFH's Punkin Ale, this is the best I've had thus far coming into the fall season."
"D: Pumpkin pie in a bottle sums this one up. A nice take on the style. One of the best examples of this style I've had."
"If you like pumpkin beers, add this one to your yearly list of bottled versions to buy."
"Mouthfeel is a bit thin, low carbonation, somewhat dry. Tasty pumpkin ale, very drinkable."
"D: Very easy to drink this one. Could easily have a few in a sitting."
"MF&D - A little on the sweet side, so I don't think I could have more than 2 or 3 in a sitting. Great fall treat!"
"D: It don't get much better than Thanksgiving in June."
"ok, but just not robust enough."
"A 22 ounce bomber bottle shared with brothercannon. Poured into a pair of shaker glasses. The ale appears a clear dark copper color with an inch of fluffy light tan foam. Nose and flavor are of nutmeg, allspice, medium roasted grains and pumpkin meat, cinnamon, and caramel. A tad better than medium bodied and adequately carbonated for the style. Pretty tasty stuff as pumpkin ales go."
"Taste was nice - better than I expected. a little thin with a slight sour finish. Must confess that I am not a big fan of pumpkin ales but this really wasn't a bad experience"
"Good stuff..."
"Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied, sweet and very spicy. The spices could be toned down a bit. Alcohol is pleasant and slightly warming. This is a good pumpkin ale that has a real pumpkin flavor. A little too much spice for my liking."
"8/4/6/3/14 (3.5/5)"
"Nice seasonal brew getting one ready for the fall season."
"This Pumpkin Ale had a different type of feel from others that I've had in the bottle, being all around more mellow and creamy, but I still really dug it. A really tasty Pumpkin Ale that I've been wanting to try for a while now and finally got around too. I would seek this out again next fall."
"Notes from 9/20/07."
"Drinkability- I miss the old memories of this beer and want to visit with it again fresh. Sadly, I have a feeling I may never see this fine elixir again. In comparison to Pumpking last year, it doesn't quite place, but against many other pumpkin beers, it stands on it's own and is delicious. Where are you Southampton? Gone from Ohio? I want the Saison back!!"
"Drinkability: This beer is decently drinkable not great but different, if you're in the mood for a pumpkin ale."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a nice dark golden amber with an off white head. The head was 1 finger, lasted a minutes then left a ring around the top. Smell was mostly pumpkin pie mix, with a bit of cream. Taste was a subtle pumpkin , almost an aftertaste with the nutmeg standing out a bit too strongly. Felt very very smooth in the mouth, coated well, and not at all overly carbonated. Slightly bitter in the mouth. Easy to drink, but the bitterness kicked it down a notch and made one linger a bit longer."
"A very different beer for me as it is the first pumpkin ale i've ever tried. Seems a bit too extreme tho and a bit unbalanced but nevertheless an interesting experience. Worth a shot!"
"The nice thing is that the pumpkin and spice is well balanced, not overpowering each other. The negative thing is that those are the only flavors present and I would like something else there."
"I guess if you like less subtle pumpkin brews this one would be a winner. If you are expecting a piece of pumpkin pie then look elseware."
"All in all, not one of my favorite pumpkin ales, and this came as a shock, as I have had really great experiences with alot of other Southampton beers."
"GC"
"Poured into a pint glass, the head faded quickly on top of the clear copper ale. Smells of the pumpkin pie you'd expect. I think there's a nice balance of pumpkin and spice flavors, with nothing too overpowering to keep it drinkable. As it gets warmer, I got a little banana--interesting. Perhaps a little thinner than I was expecting, but I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this one to someone who enjoys pumpkin ales."
"Overall, a pretty decent pumpkin beer that could use some more malt and hop profile rather than all spice."
"I didn't feel the 6.0% ABV as I worked my way down my pint glass and since I had this after dinner tonight, I didn't have any desire to have desert once I downed all of this. If ya like your fall beers spicy, intense, and dark, this isn't yoour cup of tea. For people like me who want to ease into the cooler weather, this ia a great choice. This is one of the better pumpkin beers that I've had!"
"D: Southampton is completely hit or miss for me. This used to be a much better beer. They really need to overhaul their non 750 releases. This one was made up the road in Saratoga. They need to get these recipes tight on the Island before sending them up."
"D- This is (like ST Pumpking last year) is a very pumpkin-tasting pumpkin ale. Not much else too it. It's a good seasonal release but gets cloying toward the end."
"I do not like cloves, which is likely why I can pick them out so distinctly in the allspice in this beer, which makes it not my favorite beer, and perhaps why I dont find many pumpkin beers I like, but for what it is, it is a very fine example. If you like pumpkin beers this one is at the top of the style for me."
"This is probably one of the best Pumpkin Ales out there...Rich copper pour, leaving a light lacing. Nose of pumpkin is quite predominate,along with hints of the spices...cinnamon, nutmeg...I would highly recommend anyone to just taste this and compare to any other Pumpkin Brew out there...Southampton has a winner!"
"This beer pours a dark amber with no head. The smell is very nice, major overtones of pumpkin. The taste is nice, I don't get much hops, but the pumpkin flavor is very nice and a nice smooth malt finish. The mouthfeel is pleasant, the carbonation seemed a little low but this wqas nice for the drinkability and mouthfeel. The drinkability is nice for this beer I could drink a couple but pumpkin is not my favorite flavor when something like stone ipa is on tap but certainly a very drinkable and well crafted beer. Lots of Pumpkin in this beer."
"I've got a ST Pumking waiting on the sidelines that I'm anxious to open up and compare to this (I was intending to wait for a chilly early-fall day but I don't think I'll make it that long)."
"It pours a rich copper with some brown tones with a fizzy cream head that dissapates but does leave a nice ring in the glass and some lacing. It smells of rich spice--cinnamon,nutmeg,clove,and hints of vanilla. Not much pumpkin in the smell. Taste has a spicey bite from the hops that hits first. Malt comes in the middle and then the full flavor of spice and hints of pumkin come in. The pumpkin is not a predominant flavor in this brew. In the mouth its a nice transition of flavors and over all fairly drinkable. Overall a nice brew and definately something I would drink again."
"Have heard good things about this one so I am admittedly a little disappointed. Drinks OK - pretty clean on the palate so it's not like ya have to choke this one down. A decent offering but there are better ones out there."
"This is a run of the mill Pumpkin. Decent but nothing special."
"Pretty good, another more subtle version of the pumpkin ale. Spices a bit strong, but controlled by hops. Taste could use a bit more pumpkin and a bit less spice."
"D: Overall a solid good pumpkin beer that is refreshing and not overly done with spices making it much easier to consume then the other spice dominated beers."
"Pours a nice clean/clear golden orange/amber color, nice carbonation, nice little one-finger creamy tannish head, which leaves minimal sticky lacing. The nose is malty, pumpking, nutmeg, slight cinnimon, and some caramel. The taste is pretty good, follows the nose very well. Medium body. Drinkable, a tasty brew."
"I picked this bottle up about a week ago, I don't think it would have lost any taste character so soon, but I could be wrong. But overall, pretty refreshing."
"Drinkability: Tasty, but a tad sweet."
"This is the first beer from the brewer I have had. A nice light orange with a good head. No lacing. The smell is spiced pumkin. The taste is like a pumkn pie. There is a herbal taste as well. The mouthfeel is smooth and there is a sweet aftertaste. Drinkability is good. One of the better pumkin brews I have had. I will try to seek out other selections by the brewery."
"Not my favorite pumpkin beer, as I prefer something with more spice, but still highly enjoyable."
"Drinkability: A decent seasonal. I like the pumpkin but just one at a sitting."
"D- The drinkability of this is by far the best of any pumpkin ale i've ever had just because it is so light. A lot of people write off pumpkin beers because they are too gimiky with tons of spices and pumpkin or cloying. This one is neither and it would be easy to knock a few glasses back. With that being said, I respected the balance and would drink it again if someone gave me one, but I wouldn't seek it out. Glad to have had the opportunity to try it."
"Drinkability: very flavorful ale that is easy to drink and perfect for a cold fall day. One of the better pumpkin ales around."
"Poured from an undated bomber into a tulip, this beer is a gorgeous glowing amber with a thin white head that vanishes pretty quickly. Nose is a faint whiff of pumpkin overlaid with the spices from the bottle, the allspice standing out the most. Pick up a slight bit of gingerbread as well--really smells very much like a pumpkin pie. Taste follows the nose, with just a slight pumpkin flavor coming through, mainly the cinammon and allspice, definitely more mellow than some other pumpkin beers I've had. A little on the thin side, moderate/high carbonation, and a slighly dry finish. This is an easy to drink pumpkin beer, solid tasting, but maybe not worth the expense a bomber. Woudl drink again if I could find in 6 packs."
"Drinkability- A pretty solid Pumpkin Brew that I enjoyed. It's very easy drinking and easy to get lost in the brew and before you know it, it's gone. Big thanks to Walter!!"
"Mouthfeel was medium bodied with a little too much carbonation for my liking. This is completely drinkable and was a huge plus while in the beer store (Bruisin Ales). Has to be top two or three on the Pumpkin ale category for me."
"D: Decent, but not much here to make me want to revisit."
"Not a bad pumpkin ale. One bomber is enough for me, and it's not my favorite of the many pumpkin ales I've tried this season."
"I was greatly looking forward to trying this one. It poured a very nice orange tinted amber with a little bit of a haze to it and ample carbonation. A nice three finger head of white lace appeared on top and gradually faded down into just a film across the top. The aroma was very big, full of spices, lots of cinnamon and nutmeg were readily noticeable. The taste followed along the same line. A very spicy little ale with just the right amount of hotness to it. The cinnamon was particularly strong and had a great effect on the flavor. Very nice light body and ample carbonation made it go down very easily. Overall this was a fine version of a pumpkin ale that was rich in spice and had just the right amount of hop in the back to give it a little punch. I would defiantly pick one of these up again for next year."
"One of the better pumpkin ales out there, IMO. Pumpkin spices are present and blend well together without going overboard. Recommended for pumpkin ale lovers."
"Cheers!"
"drinkability: pretty good"
"The taste is quite good, with a spritzy flavoring of wheat, cinnamon, nutmeg, pepper, and other spices. The mouthfeel is a bit overcarbonated, but maintains a crisp and refreshing bite to the finish. Quite an easy beer to put away, I killed the bomber without much of a problem. I'll probably try this again sometime, but I'll reach for other pumpkin ales first come next Autumn."
"Bomber poured into a pint glass. Orange color with a medium-sized white head. Aroma was malt and pumpkin, with a hint of spice. Tasted mostly pumpkin pie spice, but the malt and pumpkin also showed through. The first impression was that it was too spicy, but it mellowed out as it warmed a bit. Decent beer, but couldn't drink a lot of these."
"Pours a light golden caramel with good initial head that dissipates, but traces remain. Smell is mellow...malt and pumpkin blend in an inviting aroma. Taste is likewise a blend of malt and pumpkin with spicy hints. Neither taste overwhelms the other. Mouthfeel is initially lightly creamy but finishes with a slightly crisp quality. As with other pumpkin ales, it might be a bit harder to drink too many as the pumpkin taste can get a tad overwhelming over time."
"This isn't the most exciting pumpkin beer I've had, but it may be the most well made. Nothing in the beer detracts from it at all. I would definitely recommend trying this one if you can get it."
"Got this bottle at Bruisin' Ales in Asheville, NC. Not my favorite Pumpkin beer, I expected more from this brewery. Pours dark amber with little head or lacing. The smell shows nicely balanced pumpkin and spice, with cinammon, nutmeg and allspice. The initial flavors are a nice balance of spice and pumpkin, but unfortunately it quickly falls off and the finish is a little watery and quite a bit toned down. The mouthfeelis a little too watery, and too tame. Easy drinking, but fairly forgettable."
"Beauty of a pour, pumpkin amber with a frothy ivory head, lots of lacing. And nuttin but pumpkin, spices, clove in both the aroma and taste. Yummy stuff. Creamy and filling in the body, this is a top of the line pumpkin ale. With the alcohol on the lighter side of 6%, this is one for a session."
"Appearance is a deep amber that starts with a healthy head but settles down after a few minutes. The smell is very spicy especially cinnamon. The taste is very sweet and malty, like pumpkin pie mixed with an Oktoberfest. The overriding taste is cinnamon that leaves a prickly spiciness in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied and fairly smooth. Drinkability suffers a bit from the sweetness. Overall, this is a bit too sweet for my liking but a nice change of pace to have each fall."
"22oz bomber from A-1 to-go in Gardiner. Pours a nice translucent amber-red with a good inch of off-white head. Smells sweet and spicy, with cinnamon, nutmeg, etc dominating. Tastes like pumpkin and spices, finishes clean, helping the drinkability. Full body with a good amount of carbonation, but not too much. Very drinkable, one sip definitely invites another on this one. Not the best pumpkin ale I've had, but definitely a great one, and another impressive offering from Southampton."
"There are a lot of other reviews on this beer for the details. I didn't consider it anything spectacular. We did a pumpkin-beer lineup last night and this beer was a bit disappointing. I'd call this a cinnamon beer, not a pumpkin beer. I'd recommend the Dogfish Head Punkin' (current #10 on the Top Pumpkins) or better yet, the Imperial Pumpking (currently #1) if you're looking for something with some Halloween spirit."
"Pours a clean copper color with a small white head, that did not last long. In the aroma, cinnamon and allspice, and just a hint of pumpkin. In the taste, same as smell, spices with a hint of pumpkin. A smooth and spicy mouthfeel, and a cinnamon aftertaste. A very nice pumpkin ale, nice spice and not too big. A nice balance as well."
"Thanks Southampton. I knew it'd be good."
"Southamptons pumpkin ale pours a comparatively light orange amber color, a bit of a deviation from its brethren. A gentle nose of autumnal spice along with supple pumpkin spice components greet you and never overwhelm you. A bit on the side of a refined seasonal; never out of balance or over the top. I would like to see a more concentrated version of the recipe, but enjoyable it is and a perfect selection for long-term pumpkin brew quaffing sessions."
"D - One of the better """spiced""" pumpkin beers but it doesn't have that natural pumpkin taste others have. Still a very tasty beer."
"This was meduim bodied and faded from mildly sweet into a bittersweet and hoppy/dry aftertaste that in my opinion is perfect for fall. This is very drinkable (even the 22 oz.) and one of the best pumpkins I've had this season."
"Pours a two-finger white head that vanishes quickly to a ring leaving traces of lace. Crystal clear amber color. Spicy pumpkin nose. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Flavor has pumpkin sweetness with a hop background, slight hop finish. 22oz bottle gift from Boston, MA area."
"Bomber w/o freshness info...first off I am no fan of the style, however, this one I found to be unexpectadly enjoyable, a pleasant suprise, if you will. Pours typical, semi cloudy dark amber, under a moderate tan head, that left spotty lacing and some tongues of sheeting. Nose is of ripe fruit, apricots and subtle fall spicing. Taste here is of a high quality, pumpkin, apricot, apple pie or tart. Soft fruity goodness, with no sweet sugary distractions. Pleasant and easy drinking, bring on a cool winter afternoon and some football games. Nice job here, as usual, by southampton. This one also would likely be a good beer for craft beer newbies."
"This was not what I expected, but I really liked this. Aside from the fantastic aroma & great color it, to me, has a lot of characteristics that one might glean from a single malt. In that I do like single malts, to me this is a good thing. The spice bite, sweet caramels, faint burnt aspects, all add up to a very nice beer and a great cool weather one. Ironically, I don't see this going with pumpkin pie, but the cinnamon & sweet malts could make for a nice foil to some spicy fare (Spanish/Thai/Middle East) as well as sharp taste like certain onions, dry aged cheeses. Actually, this might pare really well with a number of Middle Eastern dishes. Pleasantly surprised. I would definitely drink this again, and would recommend it highly to those who enjoy the occasional nip from a noser."
"Drinkability: One of the better pumpkin ales out there."
"This one is more understated than I would prefer but still enjoyable drinking."
"drinkable?: kinda, the fake pumpkin flavor gets to be to much """as it goes""""
"It pours a golden brown into my pint glass, with a short-lived, just off-white head that consisted of relatively large bubbles. Aromas of cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, pumpkin, and brown sugar waft up from the brew as I breathe in its vapors. It may well have the best aroma of any pumpkin ale I've head, with the exception of one. Oddly, no pumpkin ale ever tastes as full as it smells, and this is no exception. The flavors are mainly of medium-dark malts and the above mentioned spices (just not as big), with just a little hoppy bitterness at the finish. It's very nice, with a smooth texture and a lingering aftertaste of hops, malts, and pumpkin."
"highly highly recommended."
"D: I could easily drink a couple of these."
"bomber from Peace Street"
"Nice. I wish the """pumpkin pie""" quality came through a bit stronger, but all-in-all an enjoyable, well-rounded brew."
"Pours a dark copper with a decent head that diminishes to barely a ring. Aroma is very much dominated by pumpkin spice with some malt present in the background. The taste is a good blend of pumpkin spice and malts. The beer is medium bodied with decent carbonation. This is an enjoyable beer, but at $4.99 a bomber, not something I'd likely have again."
"Pours a pale orange with a thick slightly off white head. The aroma is dominated by the pumpkin and spices and this carries into the flavor which also has some malt background and finishes on the sweet side. Fairly high carbonations hurts the drinkability of this bottle."
"The flavor is probably the best of the patch to date. Nice pumpkin flavor with a good pepper and pumpkin spice profile. This is ranking right there with DFH Punk'n"
"For the style, Southampton's version is pretty average. Although it is not my style of choice, I have had better offerings."
"Overall- Possibly the best Pumpkin Ale I've ever had. Absolutely delicious. Worth the $4 for 1pint6oz."
"I'd put this one up there with Brooklyn's Post Road as one of my favorite pumpkin ales. If you can track it down, I'd recommend it."
"Final Note: I don't think the guy in the beer store was lying to me about the freshness of this beer, and I was very impressed with this brew from Southampton."
"Overall, very good. My favorite pumpkin ale to date, although perhaps CBC's needs a category of its own."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not as filling as most beers in the style but still makes a very good representation thereof. Although April might not be the ideal month to be drinking this type of beer, it’s kind of chilly tonight so the beer is actually hitting the spot a bit. It’s definitely one of the best I’ve had in the style."
"Drinkability- Not bad, but a bomber was more than enough for me. Part of this is just the style however. It's a hard one to get just right in my opinion, but this beer was uninspiring for me."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and smooth with a nice strong flow of carbonation. I enjoy drinking this brew and will easily finish the bomber off. A tasty pumpkin ale that ranks up there with the best ones I've sampled personally. I'll be seeking this one out again next year and hope to sample it a bit fresher when it comes out! Cheers once again to Southampton on a fine creation."
"The beer pours a dark amber color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a mild pumpkin scent along with a fine spice aroma which compliments the fruit scent well. The taste is decent. It has a light pumpkin flavor along with a slight cinnamon/nutmeg/allspice finish. It's light and highly drinkable, but not as bold a taste as I was hoping for. It goes down easy with good carbonation, but finishes dry and with medium bodied. I prefer a more full bodied pumpkin beer that makes a bolder statement. This is a nice beer, but nothing special."
"Drinkability - delicious and totally sessionable."
"Rich amber color and a crusty beige head that does reduce somewhat. Soft pumpkin spice in the nose with allspice leading the way and backed by hop fruitiness. Nice strong pumpkin spice and a nearly equal pumpkin flavor. Graham cracker bready, toasted light malts and balanced with a distinguished hop character displayed here but unobtrusive to the pumpkin pie focus. Medium body, moderate to high carbonation giving it a fizzy mouthfeel that's not bad but might have been better without. The finish is fruity sweet, dry spice, and pumpkin spices carrying over."
"This is the best pumpkin ale I've ever had and one of the best beers I've ever had period. I'm hoping to see another one of these around the store sometime soon, but being January, my chances are dwindling. However, I'm definitely looking forward to next year's batch."
"Poured a dark, rust color with a frothy and semi-soapy head. Just a bit of lacing was left behind in my pint glass. A thin film remains throughout the session. Moderate carbonation. Aromas of spices, pumpkin, grains, and alcohol. The taste follows suit with a smoothness and crispness that is quite interesting and tastey. A bitter finish that hints of autumn, leaves and the seasonal harvest."
"22oz. bomber: This one pours a clear amber color. There is a bit of an off-white head on it that drops off rather quickly. Fairly big nose of pumpkin pie spice, but not overdone. Nothing else can really make it through those. A somewhat thinner body to this beer. I taste some of the pie spices, but I get a bit of a metallic taste to the beer. Not one of their better offerings. Disappointing, since I really like this style."
"While it isn't the equal of my very favorites, Southampton Pumpkin Ale is very good beer. My worries about the generous amount of spices wearing away my enthusiasm over the course of the bomber haven't been borne out. I would love to have had a bottle with my Thanksgiving dinner; something that I'll be sure to keep in mind for next year."
"Overall: Thoroughly enjoyable. Yet again Southampton seems to add a new twist and some quality input into a style that has seemingly been brewed to death, and yet inject it with new life and vested interest. Damn this one is good!!! A Spicy Thanks! to the lovely Erica for this Holiday treat."
"I was really crossing my fingers hoping that this beer would be as delicious as Southampton's other offerings but alas, this is not the case. But look at the scores! Hmm... seems like another case of star-struck fans of the brand (can someone say Stone? Westvletern? Rochefort? Three Floyd's?) hoisting a mediocre beer to stardom based on it's name, not it's quality."
"Appears a caramel amber with an off white thick head leaves sparse lacing spread out but I must say the head did have some good resiliency. Aroma...pumpkin pie baby, with sweet crusty breadiness and hints of that underlying lovable gourd with the traditional spice routine of cinnamon, nutemg, and all spice. Flavor comes off creamy with pie filling sliding across the palate in liquid form quite the novel idea right??? (yeah I know but these Southampton guys pull it off a little better than most). Spicy layers with those same spices noted in the nose and bready roast malt layers leaves traces of caramel and more pumpkin pumpkin flavor almost vegetable in nature. Mouthfeel is even with smooth creamy carbonation definitely medium bodied brew but damn it goes down with ease. Drinkability is great much more thatn the typical pumpkin ale I like this one for the balanced spice profile compared to some other god awful pumpkin ales."
"The drinkability is good. I would try this one again. Prosit MK"
"Good stuff....happy holidays."
"Nice reddish mahogonay color, fairly clear, with a big just barely off white bubbly head that lasts for a while before settling into a thin crown. Great spice int he nose, starting with cinnamon and nutmeg, with some slight pumpkin and something meaty. The taste has good malt and bitterness underlying the heavy spice fomr the nose. There's some slight astringency in the way of an otherwise pleanet and long finish."
"Real pumkin pie. Sweet cinammon and brown sugar in aroma and in taste. Spices that could go for an xmas beer too.White ice cream head on orange body. Not for everybody. Good medium smooth mouthfeel vanilla ice cream. Mild secondary bitterness. WIth food unless you are a fruit beer freak."
"Overall, this is a very drinkable ale that is really not too far out there. I think it could be enjoyed by BA and BMC drinkers alike."
"22 oz bomber. The beer departs the bottle a goldened amber color with a finger off white head that settles to a half-finger over top. A setady stream of carbonation is seen hitting the surface of the brew, and clarity is superb. Inhaling over the glass brings me aromas of allspice, nutmeg, and pumpkin. I definately get some of the pumpkin fleshyness in there, make this one a lot like a nice pumpkin pie. This smells like a nice brew. Flavors present are really nice. The pumpkin hits first, followed with allspice and cinnamon, but finishing with a little kick from some spicey hop and a very mild bitterness. This is the first pumpkin ale that I have detected the hopping in the flavor and finish, and I think it really adds a nice component to the beer that compliments the spicing really nicely. I never would have thought that the bitterness would work in this style, but it is great. Mouthfeel is moderate with a light to moderate carbonation. It appears to have lost most of the carbonation after being poured, but retains enough to give it a nice bubble. This is definately a fine example of a pumpkin beer. The hopping really makes this one a cut above in my book."
"This beer pours a very clear amber color with a small head that falls quickly and doesn't leave any lacing on the glass. The aroma is very mild, but the pumpkin spices are present - nutmeg and allspice seem to be the most dominant. The flavor is very clean and refreshing. The spices are all there and they meld together very well to form a mild, but constant spice profile. The actual pumpkin character escapes me here, but the spices lend to that flavor enough for me. The spices hang onto the palate for a long while. The body is moderate and the drinkability is good. Very pleasant pumpkin beer."
"D - This is unbelieveable."
"Easy to drink. Sessionable. I wish it tasted as good as it looked and smelled."
"My first pumpkin ale! 22oz bottle from Bauer Wines in Boston for $5. Pours amber with little head or carbonation. No lacing. Pumpkin ales are generally not available in Canada, so this was my first sampling of the style. The pumpkin and spice flavours are enjoyable, although I was expecting them to be more pronounced, based on the label description. A nice drink, but I think once a year will do."
"Nice amber color, white head, leaving some lacing. Smell was pretty good, light smell of pumpkin and spice, definately some nutmeg. Taste has hints of tasting like pumpkin pie, but seems to be a bit bland. Don't get me wrong, there is enough pumpkin taste to notice, but just seems a little too light. Body was on the lighter side of medium, with quite a bit of carbonation. This was alright, but the one bomber I had will suffice. Worth a try."
"Enjoyable,one of the best pumpkin beers I've tasted. Would drink this one again,be great with Thanksgiving dinner."
"Overall, Southampton's Pumpkin Ale is an excellent beer. If I could change anything about it, I would increase the malty characteristics for a more complex brew. Either way, it's a very enjoyable beer, and highly recommended. Now I just have to try Dogfish Head & Weyerbacher's take on it."
"-TN"
"southampton has never dissappointed me, and this one isn't starting any new trends"
"Glad I tried this one."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink and an interesting twist on the style which, by other brewers, is either skewed toward pumpkin pumpkin pie or pumpkin flavor; this has both and bit of hops to boot"
"It is essential this beer be served above fridge temp, maybe into the 50s F. I found most of the flavors imperceptible initially while they shined after I let the beer warm."
"This brew was had on tap last evening. The brew poured to a golden amber color with a small tan head that did not leave much of any lacing. The aroma was very nice, fresh pumpkin pie with a fair amount of spice. The taste was excellent. Reminded me of Thanksgiving with the strong taste of a spicy pumpkin pie, picking up cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves and ginger that fads nicely to an adequate hop finish. A very smooth drinking pumpkin brew and one I will look for in the future. Not as pumpkiny as some others I have but that is actually welcomed. If you like this type give it a try, think you will be happy. As with most Pumpkin brews, I am not sure if I could drink a lot of it so this is why the drinkability is a little lower."
"Not once did I say """Egads! that's pumpkin!""" and maybe that's a good thing. A pleasing, easy drinking seasonal brew is what this is."
"D - Not too great. It is too spicy (from red cinnamon) and sweet to be ideal. I might try it again, but the red cinnamon is too strong on the flavor. I love my pumpkin ales with pumpkin pie spices in them, but pumpkin pie does not imply red cinnamon. Cinnamon, as in ground cinnamon sticks, is very far removed from the red variety. Oh well, I was glad to have gotten to try this!"
"Drinkability: For less than $5 a bomber, this is perfect for the season. I'm a fan of pumpkin ales around this time, and I could see this being for someone who wants a very drinkable, not heavily spiced brew with some spices and enough hops to balance things out."
"nicely drinkable, and a nice pumpkin ale that i would get again."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1""" tan head over the clear dark copper brew. Head fades slowly, with good lacing. Aroma is pumpkin sweet, with ample spicing as the label indicates. Flavor finds the same light pumpkin, but is almost overpowered by the spices, which dominate the rest of the experience. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both somewhat limited by the spicing abundance, but all in all, not a bad pumpkin brew."
"M&D - the only downside is that its a little bit overspiced, it leaves that grainy feel on my tongue, like when i have cinnamon on something, but it is one of the best pumpkin ales i have ever had. very tasty, even the girlfriend liked it (and she swears all beer tastes the same)"
"Dark copper in color, with a thin white head. Head disappears rather quickly. Some spices, mostly nutmeg in the nose. Slightly bready malt character, some pumpkin pie spices at the end along with some bitterness. Finishes dry. Light body. Rather simple, with a nice spicy finish. Not bad as far as pumpkin ales go."
"Overall, compared to other pumpkin ales, I found that the Southampton holds up extremely well: it neither overdoes the spice (as the Weyerbacher does), nor is it over-sweet and overdone (like Dogfish Head), nor is it too understated (like the Smuttynose). I have to say that this is probably my favorite pumpkin ale."
"After trying their outstanding Double White ale, Im always optimistic when trying a new beer from Southampton, and this one didnt disappoint. One of the more solid pumpkin ales Ive tried this season, its subdued with a more balanced spice profile; they arent too rich nor are they too mild and, overall, the entire palate is just a little more drinkable and easy going. Now, if you really like pumpkin ales and enjoy the richer examples of the style you might consider this one a little watery, but personally, I really enjoyed Southamptons above-average stab at the style. Recommended."
"Overall, this was one of the best pumpkin ales I have had to date."
"D: I really like the offerings from Southampton and this is no exception. Another pretty stellar brew. One of the better pumpkin ales--not to be confused with an o'fest."
"Drinkability: This is by far one of the best Pumpkin Ales I've tried, but again I've had very few beers of this style. Now I know why I haven't had many. It made for a nice fall season brew, but maybe I should buy another bottle and see if another one tastes like this. I sure hope it has more pumpkin taste than this bottle."
"Slightly chewy mouthfeel accompanies loads of cinnamon and nutmeg, which dominate the landscape in this pumpkin pie melange. Pumpkin is present in notable quantities, with their sweetness peaking by midsip. Finish is surprisingly bitter, with a burst of hops that lingers in the aftertaste. A very tasty pumpkin. Worth the cost of admission."
"Drinkability is excellent. The flavors are very balanced, something hard to find in a pumpkin ale. I'm glad that I purchased a case of this and another may be in order for Thanksgiving because this one will not last."
"Drinkability  This is neck and neck with the Smutty Pumpkin for me  I may like this a bit more. Ill have to drink a few more of these!!"
"Overall a very drinkable pumpkin ale. Perhaps the best one I have had up to date."
"A nice change of pace from some of the other pumpkin beers out there. I think there is a time and a place for some of those phenomenal Imperial pumpkin beers, but this is a nice one to enjoy with friends. Tastes great, but doesn't require you to sit and contemplate on it. Think of it as a pumpkin session beer."
"Thick medium carbonated mouthfeel. Leaves a dry moderate finish. Easy drinking and delicious."
"Sampled at the Blind Tiger in NYC on cask, then at the brewery on draught, then at Spuyten Duyvil on cask, then at Barcade on draught. Fun beer and without a doubt, the best pumpkin beer ever, although I still havent had Kuhnhenns version. Light golden color, a bit lighter than most pumpkin ales. Nice, aromatically, considering it is a pumpkin ale. Authentic pumpkin aromas, with light cinnamon and allspice. Flavor is heavily pumpkin accented, with very little spice, cinnamon and allspice. Loaded, just loaded with pumpkin flavor, although Ill be honest and say I was hoping for something just a little more substancial and of course, i loved the Weyerbacher Imperial Pumpkin."
"Overall a great brew, but an outstanding brewery!"
"My aggro pour created two fluffy fingers of tawny head with good retention that began to create nice lacing as it fell. Color was a coppery amber (SRM = ~ 13) with NE-quality clarity. Nose smelled just like pumpkin pie! The cinnamon was prevalent, but the vanilla was also present and the other spices stood in line behind those two. In looking at my cask review, the clove was in this version, but not as prevalent, nor was the mouthfeel as full and soft. This had a creaminess, but the carbonation was more prickly on the tongue. Finish was tasty, and it was probably one of the best pumpkin beers that I have had from a bottle, but it did not measure up to the cask version. I am now curious to try and find it on a draft account."
"Damn this was a good beer."
"Wow, what a shock... <sarcasm> another great beer from Southampton."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
" The pumpkin flavor is fairly delicate at the start, but it comes out more as the beer warms a bit. Cinnamon and nutmeg really spice things up. There are some small hints of sweetness to add to the complex array of flavors. The body is medium, with a very smooth mouthfeel. I did not want to share this one, but after trying it, I had to let a few people have a sip. They then ordered one for themselves. It is a very good drinker as well. They did an excellent job on this one."
