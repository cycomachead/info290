"Among my favorite fall beers to drink. They didn't overkill the beer with pumpkin flavor making it excellent."

"Chocolate porter with pumpkin spices. Not my favorite styles of ale but  is a delicious ale."
""
"I generally don't like the feel of pumpkin beers, because they are a bit too sticky for me. However, despite that, Punkin is a good drinkable beer, with clear pumpkin without overwhelming pumpkin spice. Some pumpkin beers are too sweet. This doesn't overdo it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Older varieties were much tastier.  The current seasonal that is being put out is still good but no where near as good as it was when DFH really kicked off distribution."
""
""
""
"Decent pumpkin ale.  Pours well, medium orangy amber color(at least to me) with a small head that dissipates quickly."
""
""
"I don't like pumpkin beers"
"Overall:  A very good pumpkin beer.  Great balance between the traditional malty/hoppy flavors of beer, balanced well with the pumpkin and spices.  In years past this has been my favorite, but I’ve since had some excellent pumpkin beers this season that have moved Dogfish Head’s Punk down on my list of favorites.  That being said, this beer will always have a place on my shelf in the autumn."

"Pumpkin beers seem to have lovers and haters with not much in between. Personally, I love them so long as they are not too pumpkiny. This ale fits the bill though the 2014 version is not quite as good as prior vintages. The head and lace are lacking in the latest vintage and this effects the mouthfeel which seems dry. Otherwise a really nice spiciness and flavor. If you like pumpkin ales I don't think this one will disappoint."
"V - Medium value, came in a four pack of bottles."
"Best Pumpkin beer out thee. Yes, better than Pumking"
""
"Overall, I thought this was a good fall/pumpkin beer. This is my first of the season, so maybe my thoughts will be different, after I have tried some other similar beers."
""
""
""
""
"A personal favorite out of the pumpkin category... somewhat boozey, good carbonation, nice aroma - pumpkin spice is perfect. Not too sweet."
"I really enjoyed this Ale. Not going to be very descriptive."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Great Pumpkin flavor. Can taste all the spices too."
""
""
"Hmmm.... a full bodied """brown ale"""... not so sure about that. Despite the misleading description, it has a remarkably pleasant appearance. It is jubilantly orange, with an inviting glow when it catches the light. In fact, the playful and vibrant orange color is the attribute I enjoyed the most about this beer. Not far behind is the aroma. The spices and pumpkin meat meld in to an alluring symphony. My wife declared that it is """mouth-watering""". She's not even a big beer drinker. As for the taste....This is a little bit on the cloying side with an initial sugary sweetness, followed by a harsh spicing regimen that sticks to the palate and never quite meshes coherently. The phenolic clove characteristics seem to override the malt presence and compete with a boozy fusel alcohol that rides through the whole experience. The pumpkin flavor is struggling to come through, as are the bready malts, but they get whacked in to submission by the booze and spice. Although not offensive, it's simply not the best-tasting pumpkin ale I've had. Not by a long shot. That said, the mouthfeel is quite nice. Creamy, perfectly carbonated with medium viscosity. Overall, this is a decent representation. I wonder if this beer would age well, perhaps mellowing some of the sharper edges with the spice and alcohol. Perhaps this one would be better with a slightly lower ABV? It's rare that I would suggest going smaller, but in this case, I feel like the higher gravity detracts from the beer. As with most quality brews, as it warmed and through the middle of the glass, the flavor profiles came together a bit more. Worth a try for sure, especially if you like palate-wrecking spiced beers. A tad overrated in my humble opinion. If you want a big pumpkin beer, try Weyerbacher Imperial Pumpkin. Of course, there's always Pumking for the over-the-top pumpkin experience.  Personally, I recommend Smuttynose if you can get it."

"O: Definitely one of the best beer-pie hybrids. Brought enough of that hedonistic pumpkin/spice theme while still providing real beer character. That wet dog flavor  was a major setback, but most everything else was spot on."

"I was expecting this to be more porterish in style, as is this is much more a straight shooter pumpkin ale with a moderately caramel malt body. Dogfish. Did  a  good job of keeping this in balance, it's one of the more pleasing and balanced pumpkin ales  that actually carries a solid pumpkin profile albeit with a good dose of spice. Well recommended and this was quite satisfying."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is one of the better offerings in this style, but doesn't quite match the quality of my favorite pumpkin beers. Although, I do think I could drink a few of these before getting overwhelmed by the pumpkin pie spices like many of the pumpkin beers around."
""
""
""
"P.S. I had it today again and did not notice the metallic aroma. Maybe it was the glass or maybe I was previously detecting detergent from the wash. Nevertheless, this time I detected a nice cinnamon and pumpkin aroma. I raised the score on the aroma."
"On sight, Dogfish Head Punkin Ale pours clear, pale gold, hinting toward a caramelish brown.  The scent it gives off is comprised of brown sugar, slightly caramelized, with hints of vanilla, allspice, and cinnamon.  The smell is vaguely creamy, with a hint of pumpkin.   On the palate, it starts off slightly sweet, with a moderate mouth feel, and a delicate carbonization.  Flavor wise, it’s full of brown sugar, light caramelization, cinnamon, allspice, and a touch of nutmeg.  The pumpkin element is subdued, but still present, in a distinctly squashy kind of way.  It finishes on the spicier side, with touches of butter and a hint of bitterness."

"Not as heavy on the pumpkin as I expected. Not bad."
""
""
""
"Easily the best pumpkin beer I've tried thus far & an excellent all round offering that falls short of being a classic but is very drinkable. Starting off quite spicy, I was initially fearful that this one would end up like some other pumpkin beers I've tried (namely Pumpkinhead from Brewdog) but thankfully this one was a lot more balanced & enjoyable, definitely one I'd pick up each year if it were available here in the UK."

"I feel like this is solid, if not particularly gourdbreaking. I actually prefer having a softer, sweeter base, as I don't have a particularly strong affinity for the sharper malts/amber base that a lot of pumpkins seems to use. That's just me, though."
"Overall: For me, this was a fantastic beer all around. I have very little bad to say about it, other than that I almost wonder if the name should be more like an """autumn beer," or """fall brew," or something like that, rather than a pumpkin beer -- although pumpkin surely comes in at the end. Still, I'm giving it a 4.75/5 so I'm searching for an issue, here. In reality,  It's the type of beer that would compliment a heart beef stew and work perfectly on a cold late-autumn day. The spices, hops, and carbonation are all perfect for me in this and the hint of pumpkin makes it that much better. I could go on and on, but this is a beer that ranks very high on my list of """must haves.""""

"I'm not going to do an in-depth review. I had this beer chill for a little and it was a lot more enjoyable. Definitely a wintery-feel to it. More spice than pumpkin, smooth as ever though. This deserves to be enjoyed."
""
""
""

"Overall - Balanced and easy drinking. GOES GREAT WITH HOMEMADE PUMPKIN PIE. I have a feeling that this may be the point of this Pumpkin Ale: to be a session beer that goes down easy, and in turn, multiples can be enjoyed. It's also a beer that most people can appreciate, including non-beer lovers. Very broad in its approach. Again, this is not nearly as bold as I thought it might be. Sam usually likes to push the envelope with his beers, but this one holds back. Still nicely balanced and nothing to complain about! However, I would have to be honest and say, it is a SLIGHT disappointment for me personally given that it doesn't differ too much when comparing it to other pumpkin ales on the market. Brooklyn Brewery's Post Road is not far off from this and is more widely available. This is still a great beer!"

"I'm not sure why it took me so long to get around to trying Punkin Ale. It's a very approachable pumpkin beer. Not too spiced and not overly boozey. It might not be my favorite pumpkin brew but it is very well rounded and incredibly easy to drink."

"This is my favorite pumpkin beer. The flavor of pumpkin is there but not too strong. The spices are aromatic but not artificial on the tongue.  It's a nice solid beer with some pumpkin added for flavor. Not a pumpkin with beer as an afterthought."

"This is one of the best pumpkin ales I have had.  I have been on the hunt for the best tasting one and this is right up there.  Has good pumpkin flavor, not overpowering and not as sweet as some of the others I have tasted.  This beer has a bit of a bite to it in my opinion.  The spices are very well blended for a delicious tasting beer!  Best of luck finding this gem this late in the season...although, I did find a place earlier today that still had several cases available.  Needless to say, I bought one!!!  Happy drinking everyone!!!"

""

"Overall - I was looking forward to this one, but quickly found myself underwhelmed by it's sugary flavor profile. As far as craft pumpkin ales go, it's middle of the pack, and this 4-pack will likely be my first and last go of it."
""
"Transparent copper colored ale. Nice head with solid retention.  Malty, biscuit aroma with added spices. Mild bready malt backbone. Subtle butter flavor. Hint of pumpkin. Assertive cinnamon and nutmeg spices. Mild hop. Medium bodied. Descent carbonation. Finish is a little off balanced from the spices. Eh, it's ok."

"Deep amber/copper color with small off white head. Aromas of caramel pie spice earth and a hint of chocolate. Sweet brown sugary with a bit of caramel and a hint of chocolate. Pie spices a subtle and balance the sweetness quite nicely. Medium body with light to moderate carbonation. I'm not usually a fan of pumpkin beer, but I could drink this one. Its a shame it took me so long to taste this one."

"Surprisingly subtle for a Dogfish Head beer. For better or worse, a lot of their beers are out of the ordinary. This was one essentially a brown ale with just the slightest hint of pumpkin taste."

"Enjoyed from a 12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. I think Dogfish Head got this """Punkin Ale""" right. It is a great brown ale with just the right amount of pumpkin and spices. The pumpkin flavor is not overdone and the brown sugar and spices add a nice touch as you sip this beer. I have been nursing the 4-pack for a week now."

"o: one of my favorite pumpkin beers.  its fairly straightforward, but i enjoy that the focus is on the actual pumpkin flavors.  theres no pie crust/spicy feel to this really.  its sweet and pumpkiny.   one of many joys regarding fall"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer is a fall classic. On the pumpkin beer spectrum that ranges from pumpkin pie to gourd in flavor, Punkin is certainly more toward the gourd side. It is very subtle, especially compared to other popular pumpkin beers like Souther Tier. This allows the beer to be totally sessionable while still giving some of the spicy fall notes people look for in pumpkin beers. Punkin pours a beautiful golden amber color with a wispy, foamy head.  It is also quite clear."
""
""
""
"Overall I like this beer, if you don't like cloves I wouldn't go for this though. I'm not normally into pumpkin beer but this was great."
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall I was expecting a little bit more to this, but in the end it is still quite good. I'd recommend a try, anyway."

"F- Like in the nose, it's pretty much spices. So overall not as interesting. Nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves up front, sweet base malt intersperses in there, giving it sort of a pie crust breadiness. Kind of nice, actually. The alcohol booze is stronger on the palate, especially on the backend which I suppose makes for a sort of a solid digestif. [3.5]"

"OVERALL:  Dogfish Punkin is a pretty solid beer.  I do appreciate that I can detect a lot more actual pumpkin flavor and aroma than in most others, but I would appreciate a little more sweet and spice.  I’m sure many people out there may prefer this, however."
""
""
"Overall: As the label says, this really is a perfect beer to warm up with. Spices are front and center, so fortunately they are excellently blended and really match up with the platonic idea of pumpkin pie. I would love to have this with a little vanilla ice cream or just whipped cream on the side."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Mouthfeel: Light Medium to medium in body with Medium to medium high carbonation. This is a perfect example of a refreshing fruit beer. The carbonation is a bit on the high side but still very nice."

"Nutmeg, a touch of cinnamon, and light brown sugar fill the nose.  A quick whiff smells like a cane sugar ginger ale soda.  Not much pumpkin in the taste, although it does give it some chewiness in the mouth-feel.  Would make a tasty Thanksgiving dessert option along side pumpkin pie with fresh whipped cream."

"Pumpkin flavored beer is not my favorite - that being said everything about this Pumpkin Ale is excellent, less the taste because of the basic spice profile for me.  If you like pumpkin flavored beer, get this beer."
""
""
""
""
"Taste - This is a complex beer, with none of the spices overpowering the pumpkin, which makes me happy after having so many pumpkin ales that don’t get that balance right. With plenty of taste, character, and subtlety, Punkin Ale remains one of my favorite pumpkin ales, and one I’d return to again. Only negative is the price (I paid $13.99 for a 4pk)."

"Im new to the pumpkin beers but this is hands down my favorite one yet! Southern tier makes a good pumkin brew but still like the dogfish (plan on trying more while they are in season). Funny thing is I have never liked pumpkin pie, which is why I had no interest in pumpkin beers but I finally tried one and instantly fell in love. Tastes more like the smell of pumpkin pie then the taste of one. tasty brew!"

"Color of clear amber with a off-white head that disappears quickly. Aroma of pumpkin, nutmeg, vanilla and other spices. As far as taste, the first thing that hits you is the carbonation, followed by the flavors of a pumpkin pie with a nice malt finish at the back end. Easy, refreshing drink for the fall. I recommend enjoying this beer while watching your favorite football team."

"Last year's batch (2013) was better than this year's batch, that being said not sure what happened. Still a great beer, it's more of a spice beer than a raw pumpkin flavor upfront. You get the usual cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, and a hint of some pumpkin. For 7% you can't really taste the alcohol content, best served a little bit on the warmer side to get the full flavors and aromas to pop. Not a real heavy beer, great for any fall day, and even winter. Not much head on this beer more like a half a finger then some lacing afterwards. Pours dark amber."
"This pours a semi-clear amber color with a slight head. The aroma is mild with pumpkin, clove, and spices. The flavor is rich with pumpkin and spices. The texture is perfect for the style, but the flavors could be a little bolder. Overall this is a top notch pumpkin beer that is probably one of the top10 in the market."

""
"Overall- A suberb pumpkin ale. Maybe a little on the sweet side but not to the point that it would detract. The fresh taste is there. Not too spicey either but enough spice taste to be appropriate. Definitely lives up to being on the top 5 pumpkin ales."
"Got the LTD. Edition Seasonal art series bottle. Looks as good as it tastes. Not the greatest pumpkin ale but definitely worth a try!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Pleasantly drinkable for 7% ABV, as the spice and pumpkin notes mask any alcohol presence.  What is particularly nice about this beer is how seamlessly it transitions from sweet to spicy to pumpkin pie to a malty graham cracker finish.  Quite a tasty pumpkin ale and one of the benchmarks of the style for sure."
""
"I generally thought I hated pumpkin beers, but every year I try to find a beer to change my mind. I don't love this beer but it is definitely getting me closer to liking them. This beer pours a very nice orange-goldish color. You can definitely smell the pumpkin, with various spices hitting you also. The spices like cinnamon and all spice takes the lead as far as taste and mellows into a nice aftertaste. It also has a very dense mouth feel to it. This makes me want to explore more pumpkin beers!"
""
""
"Pours perfect golden and smells honey sweet. First sip shows bitter roast. A perky bubbly body. There's not much pumpkin scent but some  Something earthy.  There's a sweet backing to this bitter ale. Spices and a woody floral scent and while it warms the malt develops some honey and biscuit.  Brown sugar and a light smoke quality.  Thin, slick mouthfeel. Alcohol is on the palate and a harsher finish that I would have liked."

"Im not much for Pumpkin anything I think its overhyped however I still try everything I can get my hands on. The lacing out of the bottle was minimal and the head was 1/4 in at the peak. It was light mouthfeel and the pumpkin and spices were secondary to the brown ale aspect which was nice. I wont buy again unless Im forced to buy anything pumpkin then its at the top of the list. (1st review)"
""

"As a brown ale, it's successful. As a pumpkin ale, it's middle of the road.  The spices and overall pumpkin flavor are just too subtle. Don't get me wrong, it is delicious. While it is a great pumpkin beer, it just falls short when compared to some other pumpkin beers out there."

"Overall, I think $12 for the 4-pack of this is pretty unwarranted for what you get, and you'd be better off getting a six of a number of pumpkins that I would consider better (or, get a six of DFH Indian Brown!). I think this ale relies heavily on ABV and the DFH name, and doesn't really stand out so much in the lineup of pumpkin ales. This is just a standard pumpkin ale to me with more alcohol; lacks the complexity or distinction that would land it in a $12 4-pack."
"cheers!"
"In general though, the pumpkin ales never seem to be that perfect  blend of pumpkin and spice."

"Dark orange copper color, thin white head fades fast and leaves a little lacing on the glass.  Pumpkin pie spices are subdued.  Nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves and vegetal pumpkin notes.  Taste brings more of that vegetal pumpkin flavors others shy away from.  Caramel like malt plays host to cinnamon, nutmeg and clove.  Seems like two parts with one carrying great vegetal pumpkin then sweet malt and spices but it never comes together.  Sharper on the mouthfeel than I'd like here.  Higher carbonation and slightly thinner end of medium mouthfeel.  Overall it's a decent pumpkin ale, not the best but I enjoy a couple every year."

"Found a bottle (2013 vintage, I think) and bought it immediately. I love this beer. Pours a cloudy orange with a coffee colored head. The smell is full of pumpkin and spice. The taste was very delicious with nutmeg and cinnamon up front and then sweet pumpkin flavor in the finish. An amazing beer for pumpkin lovers, one of my favorites."

"Deep amber golden hued with a half inch of off white foam on top. Excellent clarity. Light Brussels lacing. Aroma of pumpkin pie spice, nutmeg,allspice,and a faint whiff of clove. I taste pumpkin,brown sugar,amber malt,nutmeg,and allspice. You get a gentle hop bitterness on the fade. The mouth is smooth and moderately carbonated."

"Pours a slightly dark orange color with an off white head. Smells like the typical pumpkin spices like cinnamon and nutmeg. Also some malty aromas. Taste is pumpkin, spices, sugar, nutty and malty. Mouth feel is smooth with a medium amount of carbonation. I am a fan of pumpkin ale and this is a good pumpkin but not my favorite."

"DATE TASTED: December 23, 2013... GLASSWARE: Kisatsky Tavern pint...OCCASION: it's me (Vernon Davis) and an 18-point lead against Steven Jackson and Tony Gonzalez for the fantasy championship... APPEARANCE: solid, warm amber body; steady effervescence; nice two-finger head; cloudy white and consistent, attractive lacing... AROMA: cinnamon, allspice and hazel nut front and center; a veritable pumpkin pie in a glass, at least by its smell... PALATE: medium-bodied but feisty--not the usual walk-in-the-ho-hum-fall-forest body of a brown; aftertaste is nuanced and bold...TASTE: robust cinnamon overpowers the pumpkin; secondary nutmeg and allspice develop; the cornucopia builds with hazelnut and sugary ginger... OVERALL: I needed a beer big enough to celebrate a win and strong enough to kick in my teeth if I lose--and lose I did with barely a minute to gp in the game. This beer delivers what football so often does, a comfortable yet visceral drinking experience."

"12 ounce bottle into signature tulip glass, 2013 bottling. Pours slightly cloudy deep orange amber color with a 2 finger moderately dense cream colored head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of pumpkin, caramel, brown sugar, pear, apple, cinnamon, clove, toast, biscuit, nutmeg, herbal, floral, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Nice aromas with good complexity and balance of pumpkin, spice, and malt notes; with good strength. Taste of pumpkin, brown sugar, caramel, pear, apple, biscuit, toast, clove, cinnamon, nutmeg, herbal, floral, and herbal/yeast earthiness. No bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of pumpkin, pear, apple, brown sugar, caramel, biscuit, toast, clove, cinnamon, nutmeg, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish. Nice and well balanced pumpkin, malt, and spice flavors; but seems lacking in flavor robustness; with no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and moderately creamy mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice pumpkin ale. Well balanced pumpkin, malt, and spice flavors; but the flavor profile really doesn’t hit all the right notes for me. Still nicely enjoyable and smooth to drink overall."

"O: Easy to drink and enjoyable (probably one of the first pumpkin beers that I decided to try and a long time coming to write the review). The alcohol is well hidden and the beer really reminds me of pumpkin pie."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a pint glass, nice full head developed with good retention and lacing. Appearance was a clear, maybe slightly hazy, orange / amber color. Aroma had notes of spice and hop with some floral characters. Taste had a strong spice character, nutmeg and some cinnamon, with some toffee and hop notes. Mouthfeel was medium to full with some creamy characteristics. Aftertaste was dry with some lingering spice effects."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured out of a bottle into a very festive orange coppery color. I don't get much of a smell off of this one. Taste is immediately very autumn-refreshing. Sweetness with a good dose of the alcohol taste of the 7% coming through. The pumpkin flavor hits midway through the taste and not overpowering or chemically not many pumpkin beers. The pumpkin lingers with a bit of bitterness. It's good, not great."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Really, the best pumpkin ale I've had to date, although that isn't saying much since I'm hardly a pumpkin ale fan. Impressed by the well-blended mix of nostalgic spices and the actual presence of pumpkin flavors! However, I do feel there is some room for improvement. As tasty as those spices are, their large presence makes thigs a bit unbalanced."
"O: This is one of the better pumpkin beers Ive had yet. I wasn't super impressed by it, but, I will probably buy this again next year."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"At issue is whether or not my (unpleasant) experience is style-centric or product-centric; nevertheless, based upon this experience, I will not be tasting any pumpkin-styled seasonal beers for a long time. Perhaps I can exchange the unopened bottles for some strong IPAs or hop-centric Pilsners..."
""
"Let me start this off by saying I'm a huge pumpkin beer fan, that's the style of beer that originally got me interested in anything other than piss water (Coors, Bud, Miller, etc) after college. I'm not sure why people seem to like this so much, there are a lot of other better pumpkins out there that most people have access to. All in all I'd say its slightly above average but only because there are so many breweries out that make a shitty pumpkin beer only trying to cash in on the style. It's worth trying but for the amount you're spending on a 4-pack of this I'd go for a different pumpkin depending on what you have access to."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I am very disappointed in myself for giving this brew the rating I have. I love DFHB, I love the lengths they go for their consumers and for their own quality of product. However, this was unpleasant at times. I understand what they went for here, but a pumpkin is a squash, and I know they are very floral when opened, but if you bite into a pumpkin, it is very watery, little to no flavor. I can see the purpose of the brown sugar, but I would have liked to have tasted more of a sweetness throughout the beer. This was completely unbalanced. All in all, I will not be having this again. This beer needs to figure out what the hell it's aiming for."
""
""
""
"a good once-through brew but overall not overwhelmingly good enough to make me want to buy more. if you like a dry quaff, though, this might hit the spot."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A smooth beer, but overall rather minimal in what it is offering. Although subdued pumpkins beer are good every now and again (I am a bigger fan of the spicy pie-like styles) this one takes it to the extreme. Good for someone not huge on pumpkin ale, but too light for my taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Can't imagine someone disliking it... but can't see someone having it as their first choice."
"O - A fantastic big fall beer. It's not really the best if you are looking for a heavy pumpkin ale experience. The flavors are subtle but very good. Spices stand out on their own without muddying the entire experience"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall this is an awesome pumpkin brew. I enjoy how playful this beer is. I get nostalgic for mom's kitchen because it could almost be pumpkin pie in a glass. Huge props to Dogfish Head for their seasonal heavy hitter. You cannot argue with a beer that can invoke childhood memories. I enjoyed this one from start to finish."
"Another nice seasonal offering from DFH - from all of the pumpkin beers I've had so far during the holidays, this one is very welcome in my fridge and would work very well with food - especially what people tend to eat during the Thanksgiving holiday season. Vegetal, spicy, and slightly sweet, this is more the direction that I like these kinds of beers to head towards. Recommended for those wanting to try a good quality, mass marketed pumpkin ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very drinkable, not overpowering, you can enjoy an imperial pint or two with being sated, although you might want a palate-cleanser, even water, alongside."

"O: Solid pumpkin beer"

""
""
""

"I'm not normally this harsh, but I'm calling a spade a spade--this beer is totally unrefined and borderline amateurish. Don't know that I've ever found anything by Dogfish Head I enjoy, but even by that standard this is sub-par."
""
""

"Pretty fast dissipating head on a amber colored body. This beer really does smell like the holidays. Malty smell followed by spices and pumpkin pie. The taste is the same. Rich and deep malt flavor with with a nice alcohol middle and a spicy sweet finish. Great beer for the holiday season."
"O- My first pumpkin beer that I enjoyed, i like how balanced and easy drinking it is, loved the smooth sweet after taste, thought it could use a bit more pumpkin flavors in the forfront. If there are other pumpkin beers as good or better I may need to give more pumkin beers a chance."

""
""

""

"O- Overall this is a very good pumpkin ale good taste for the season"
""
"O - I have been noticing many Pumpkin ales, It was good enough to try more."
""
""
"Punkin is a quality pumpkin ale. It is not the strongest or the most spice/pumpkin forward, but rather a mild, easy drinking pumpkin flavored brown ale. It is a crystal clear light brown ale with some nice malty brown ale notes dominating the nose. There is a pleasant pumpkin and spice nose present but does not dominate the aroma. This holds true in the flavor as well, nice pumpkin flavor, but not overwhelming. Overall, Punkin is a soft, easy drinking brown ale with some pleasant pumpkin qualities."

"Dogfish Head Punkin Ale ---4/5."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O - Decent brew. You can tell it was brewed with """real pumpkin""". Nothing attention grabbing, like some other pumpkins I have had recently, just a simple well done pumpkin ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Still, very solid beer and especially for a pumpkin ale. Will buy again if no other new offerings for fall are around."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I'm a huge fan of pumpkin ales when they're done right, and DFH has done a superb job on this one. I've had a few others that have a nicer balance and bring out the pumpkin flavor more gracefully, but it remains a seasonal favorite every fall."
"O - This is a nice pumpkin ale in that it isn't dominated by the pumpkin spices, but rather drinks nicely like a normal ale."
""
""
"O: Good, and better than most pumpkin ales I have had. Waiting to try Pumpkinatora and Pumpking, but this does not quite match the flavor of Whole Hog Pumpkin. Good, but not quite worth the price and slight hassle to track down IMO."
"A balanced and refined pumpkin ale. Highlights spices and the clean malt bill more than the pumpkin. Look forward to this one every year."

"Overall a very good pumpkin ale."
"Overall - Maybe I'm being a perfectionist but yet again I found there to be too much spice in this brew and almost all of the others I have tried in this category. That said, the fade into a creamy pumpkin/brown sugar mouthfeel made up for it. This is the best pumpkin beer I have had so far. 100% recommend. I wouldn't expect any less from DFH."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: one of my favorite fall pumpkin ales because it balanced pumpkin and spice flavors with real beer and malt flavors. Sometimes pumpkin ales are overdone and overwhelming to the palate with sweetness and dessert like flavors. I like this one because it is one you can definitely drink a full six pack of and not completely fatigue your palate."
""

"Poured in a 16 oz pint glass at Max's Café, Gloucester NJ"
"O: It's not great, but it's better than a few others in the style I've had. It has potential as a pumpkin ale for those who don't like pumpkin ales. It's also reasonably complex and only offers a mild spice note. But to me, it still tastes a little uninspired. It's been a while since I've properly enjoyed something from DFH (I think it was a 2011 bottle of WWS), and this doesn't quite change my mind about that."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I have always held dogfish as one of the premier breweries in the states, and i remember this beer from a long time ago. I have been looking forward to it for a while, and i'm not disappointed but i come away wanting more. Good taste with great mouth feel. This is a good beer, it just doesn't do everything other than mouthfeel excellently."

"Don't usually go for flavored beers but this is such a well known seasonal beer I had to try it. Good, flavorful, sweet and different . Worthy of a repeat but would enjoy a glass at a time, not stocking up the fridge."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is great, there is a very dry harvest ale feel that has a perfect balance of bitterness that keeps this really crisp."
""
""
""
""
"O: A great beer for the season, couldn't think of a better way to celebrate the start of fall. This ale is definitely another example of DFH's creativity and ability to create high quality, complex beers. I haven't had many other pumpkin ales, but it's hard to try another one when this one is so good. Definitely check this out if you get the chance!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very complex tasting Ale. First taste is like a burnt pumpkin seed, second taste is like a pumpkin ale meets a porter. Don't be turned off by the smell and first taste, this Ale seems to taste better with each sip. This is not your typical pumpkin ale."

"So this was my First """Foray""" into Craft Brew and out of """Piss in a can hood""" call it beginners luck or whatever you want but this is a great tasting brew in all respects! its sufficiently bitter enough though not so much that it becomes hard to Drink, no real """up front Pumpkin flavor to speak of though its in the aroma for sure the taste comes into play after you've taken your sip and let your mouth warm back up a bit then you get that Pumpkin or should I say """Punkin Pie""" taste creeping in, not a bad drink at all its GREAT like it so much I pick up a case yearly and share it with my Bro's & Ho's respectably of course! =D"

"A clear, orange amber color with a respectable white head and modest lacing. The nose picks up fresh carved pumpkin with some yeast bite and freshly fallen apple (yeah, that's what I said!). The flavor brings out sour dough pumpkin meat with some clove orange and mulled cider over raw pumpkin guts. Hints of cinnamon and more mild yeast dough. There's a touch of lemon hop too very nice. The body is medium-light with solid effervescence and a slightly thin but frisky feel. A very authentic pumpkin brew."

"A pretty nice pumpkin ale that I get very year around September and October for Halloween. Worth every penny and highly recommend it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours medium brown with a thin off white head that disappears quickly. Loads of pumpkin in the nose, along with hints of cinnamon, allspice, and brown sugar. In the taste sweet pumpkin flavors take control at first. Middle of the mouth gets hit with more of the spices, followed by brown sugar for a sweet kick. Mouthfeel is medium with good carbonation on the palate. I'm not the biggest DFH fan but this is a great beer for the style. I will continue to grab at least one 4-pack every season."

"O - I've had Punkin ale many many times and it remains as one of my favorite DFH brews and one of my go to ales during the Autumn months. It's first class in creativity and quality. It is a pumpkin ale however and that isn't always everyone's favorite, but with that being said there really aren't any pumpkin ales that live up to the DFH offering. It's something about anyone can enjoy. It's not too sweet, too much spice, or too much pumpkin pie character. It's a well balanced beauty that's fit to enjoy. Ill always grab for this one."

"Overall a nice beer overall. This is a good balance for those who like pumpkin beers that don't sacrifice any beer flavor. The flavors aren't as bold as others of the style. I prefer a little more sweetness for the style. A good pumpkin ale to be sure, but not my favorite"
"Overall: A very decent effort again from Dogfish Head. I've never been disappointed with them, and they don't here as well. Always a bit bummed by the four pack... but whatever. Still not as good as a couple of others I've had, but definitely a top five in pumpkin ales for me this year."

"Not my favorite pumpkin ale, but still a great fall ale. Better than most. The color/ appearance is very nice, with a warm comforting taste. If you're looking for something especially 'pumpkiny' this might not be the right beer. However it is a full bodied, well rounded seasonal ale."
"This is a decent beer with enough flavor/spice to entice a pumpkin beer fan.  Overall execution for this year is quite good, but I think there are better options out there."
""
""
"2013 brown bottle (12oz) served in a snifter. The beer is amber colored with a white head that thins down to a light layer. The aroma is delightful, lots of fall spices. The taste is totally autumn in a bottle, lots of pumpkin pie spice flavor all the way through. Lighter bodied and it goes down silky smooth. Very good example of the style."
""
"O: 3.5 This is a great Fall beer. My first of the year! I would have guessed it at a 3.5-4% beer, very surprising this one racks up to 7%! I would definitely have this again if looking for a Fall beer. As it warms up the flavor profile becomes much more complex, with the pumpkin finally making an appearance!"
""
""
""
"Overall: There is no consensus as to what is the best pumpkin ale, but there sure are a lot of opinions. This and Pumpking are on the short list of the best in my opinion. This is pricey at $8.99/four, but this truly is excellent. This beer succeeds by doing less of what other pumpkin ales do (others often have too much pumpkin, not enough balance of pumpkin and spice, too much carbonation, or pumpkin that does not taste fresh). This is a must try."
""
""
""
""
"O- This is a fantastic pumpkin beer. Like I mentioned before, I think a lot of beers try to replace the taste and aroma of pumpkin pie, whereas DFH seemed to compliment the treat. This is one example of a milder flavored beer being better than others with more pronounced attributes. Delicious."

"Overall this is probably the best Pumpkin Ale I have had. I have hunted down many but this takes the top pick for sure. The smell alone makes this beer enjoyable, and it hits a one two punch with its smooth flavor. This is a great evening beer, when you are relaxing after a long cool Fall days work, or enjoy with a big Thanksgiving meal."

"O: 4 - I'm not really crazy about pumpkin beers but this is one of the best of the Fall crop as I prefer the spicy pumpkin beers to the more pumpkin sweet forward options on the market; a solid pumpkin that is generally above average for style; I'll continue to buy a four pack every Fall"

"Hands down my favorite seasonal offering of the pumpkin variety. Punkin is complex with multiple, delicious flavors throughout each sip. There's coriander, cloves, and, of course pumpkin flavor that dominate each sip. What's so fantastic about this is that you don't all these flavors at once; they wash over your mouth individually. It's like eating a delicious pumpkin spice-cake. My only complaint is that each bottle is 250 calories! I only drink one per sitting due to the calorie count. Other than that there's nothing I can fault this delicious beer over!"

"Poured this Pumpkin Ale from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. This Ale poured a burnt orange color, produced a average off white head, and featured average retention and lacing. The aroma of this ale contains fresh pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg and sweet brown sugar. Full bodied, this ale has a foundation of malted grain, fresh roasted pumpkin, caramel, cinnamon, nutmeg and allpice. Well balanced, this pumpkin ale has a perfect amount of pumpkin pie spice, the mouthfeel is exceptional, smooth and creamy. One of the finest Pumpkin Ale's that I have sampled- Prost!"
""

"Overall - One of the better pumpkin beers I've had. It has a lot of flavour but it isn't cloying in any way. I could actually drink a few of these. I'll but this again next fall."

"Pours a light copper color with a thin white head. Poor retention and minimal lacing. Smell is very light, not nearly as spice laden as some other pumpkin beers. There is a nice note of caramel malt, as well as a light """holiday""" spice mix. The taste is slightly sweet, almost no bitterness at all, and a noticeable alcohol characteristic at the end. Medium carbonation and body, the beer is quite drinkable for it's strength. Finishes fairly clean, overall a refreshing beer, not very much pumpkin flavor to speak of. It's also fairly difficult to find and expensive, so try it if you like, but there are better pumpkins in my opinion."

"Nice orange color with small head. Nice spice level - not too much, just enough and some actual pumpkin taste to it. Not as overwhelmingly pumpkin pie-like as some, but the spices are maybe a touch too intense. Not a huge fan of the style, but this is pretty decent stuff. Wife likes it giving it an extra thumb’s up - she actually went and bought her own stash. Hooray beer!"

"O- this one goes beyond most brewers concept of a pumpkin ale. The flavors are more complex with notes of vanilla sugar really sticking out and given the ABV, this one is very drinkable. If it wasn't for the 7%, I would call this a session worthy beer. Very good!"

"O - this has for years been my go-to fall beer; I'm not a big fan of Oktoberfests and this beer always makes me welcome fall; it's up there w some of the best pumpkin beers, although I've had better for sure; in terms of balance, flavor, and accessibility...this beer stands strong."

"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this was how serious the flavoring was. The “realness” of the flavoring really adds to the experience, as it can be easy with the style to use extracts and other additive flavoring. Here we are presented with a full flavor brew brimming with spice and fruit, making this a top competitor for the style."
""
""
""
""
"O: I'd say this is the best """pumpkin beer""" I've ever had but this is in a real class of its own. Whereas nearly everything else we are assaulted with in fall that claims to be """pumpkin""" often bears little resemblance to the actual gourd; this beer packs all of that earthy vegetal flavor of the real deal into a beer that is eminently drinkable and a real treat on a cold fall day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Even with the lack of spice, I am perfectly fine with that because Punkin does not sell itself as a spiced, pumpkin pie latte ale... this is truly a pumpkin, as in the orange/green/blue gourdes that grow in fields, type of ale, and it is beautifully done. Surely one of the best pumpkin beers I've had yet that really tastes like you've just roasted a pumpkin in the oven, pureed it and drank it down, and have it taste delicious. Where others have left it too light, this one hits the sweet spot in malt sweetness, complexity and hearty pumpkin goodness. I'd definitely hunt this one down another fall and recommend it as nearly everyone else does as a top of the notch pumpkin flavoured ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel: Medium mouthfeel. Another strong point of this beer, is it's drinkability. Some pumkin beers are just too much or just aren't that good. this is one you can keep coming back to. Carbonation is average, and finishes off with a nice subtle sweetness from the spices. A remarkable beer. And yearly one of my favorite pumpkin beers."
""
""
""
""

"improvements."

"Pretty good pumpkin beer. The price is a little steep, but it's definitely one of the more enjoyable pumpkin beers out there."
""
""
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: As Pumpkin Ales go, DFH Punkin Ale delivers on all the flavors you'd expect in addition to a nice malt bill. While I wouldn't say it's the best of the style, I would say doesn't disappoint. Would I drink it again? Yes, along with a lot of other good contenders for the fall season."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is unquestionably one of the better Pumpkin Ales out there. Dogfish Head has produced a very balanced, meticulously spiced beer that not only feels like fall, but warms you during those cooler months as well. You get a good dose of cinnamon & nutmeg on the nose and palate. Pumpkin flavor is mild, which benefits the overall profile of the beer. It does come through on the nose like a fresh pie. Good, dry finish too. I would buy a pack of these every season. One is enough for the season, but it's something to look forward to (like many great seasonals)."

"Poured from bottle into snifter. Fairly uneventful pour with a nice medium amber hue and a little 1 finger head. Looks like bubbly cider. Smell was of carmel, brown sugar and some spices. Very nice aroma. Taste follows the nose with a huge front end of carmel malts and great blend of spices (nutmeg, cinnamon, sugar, cloves). I like that it has the ale qualities and is more of a spiced brown vs. a pumpkin bomb. Very well balanced and great blend. A little hop finish, but focus is on the carmel and spice. Feel is medium with some carbonation and a bit of thickness for the tongue. Overall- A very solid spiced ale that has the balance of malts and spice. It's not over the top and IMO is one of the best I have had. Sessionable and easy to enjoy this time of year. Like that it is a brown first with the spice/flavor to compliment. Well done DFH- Will be having another soon!"
""
""
"Just tasted the pumpkin as I was exhaling a sigh."
""
""
"Appearance is rather average - color is dark amber, much like a strong iced tea, with a small head that fades quickly. The smell is a mix of various spices; scents of cinnamon and nutmeg stand out most. The taste is more beer-like than pumpkin-like. There's a solid malt backbone that gives some sweetness, with the spices adding a complimentary peppery flavor. It's a very nice balance. Mouthfeel seemed a bit on the thin side, and carbonation seemed high. A well-rounded pumpkin ale that emphasizes the ale over the pumpkin."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall this is a very nice seasonal beer, the alcohol is perhaps a bit more than I expected but this is a truly delicious beer. A definite grab in the fall."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - One of, (if not THE) best pumpkin or """autumn""" beers I have ever had. Ingredients blend seemlessly. In a market that seems to be flooded with numerous brews of this type, this one stand out. Already looking forward to drinking it again next year!"

"Overall: A fantastic pumpkin ale, the first one I can say that I truly enjoyed. There seems to be a tendancy for this style to consist of a run of the mill ale that is spiced like a pumpkin pie. You can tell this ale was built from the ground up to work as a pumpkin beer. My only complaint is that they call it a brown ale, and it is not brown, which threw me off at first. I wish I could get more than just the one four-pack, this is autumn in a glass."

""
""
""
"O - Completely cohesive from start to finish, Dogfish Head Punkin Ale manages to, almost effortlessly, take a nice and malty brown ale with gentle hoppy earth tones, a perfect beer for the season, and integrate real pumpkin and spice all while maintaining the bottom line; it's still a beer. I personally prefer my pumpkin ales a little more pumpkin-rich, but this beer is absolutely outstanding and warrants a try from anyone who's not yet enjoyed it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - For people who like a traditional version of the style and not over the top. Who would think that DFH would make a really good beer that isn't extreme for the style? Easily a fall favorite."
""
""
"Overall, this is a great pumpkin ale. I will definately buy this again and i highly reccomend this."
""
""
""
"Cheers!"
"O: There's better pumpkin ales out there, methinks. Still, a tasty treat."
"Punkin Ale is a very good pumpkin style beer. You have the hoppy character that is prevalent in all Dogfish Head brews and you can taste the spices usually found in a good pumpkin pie. The flavor of pumpkin is not in your face by any means but it is a great representation of a fall beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Second most important factor rating beer: I would certainly recommend this beer to others."
""
""
"O: I liked this ale. I would buy a four pack for sure. But be carefull the 7% will sneak up on ya."
"Overall - average pumpkin offering, no where near my favorite but I am more of a fan of the sweet and spiced pumpkin beers."
"o - overall, a great pumpkin ale. Malty but wonderful seasoning and flavor. DFH does this one really well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not a lot of words really except that this beer is the king of pumpkins. DFH scores big again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- My favorite of the commercial offerings so far which means I'll have to get some other examples to see how this years batch is shaping up!"
"O: Of all the pumpkin beers I've had, this is easily the best one. Rich, full bodied, and lacking in the over spice and spritziness that some others in the style have."
"O: Solid pumpkin beer. My first of the season."
"I didn't like the bottle label though. Would have liked a design of some sort you know."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: a good pumpkin beer, I'm not a huge fan of the style, but unlike the balance here, there is pumkin pie spice, but it is not overly done, the pumpkin flavor still comes through... One of my favs for the style."
""
""
""
""
""
"I have to give this beer high marks for being spot on for the style and I grade this as good as my all time favorite, Schlafly's Pumpkin Ale... Excellent beer. Will be looking for another six pack to age for future enjoyment."
""
"Overall a very nice pumpkin beer, with more bitterness than most, but as with most Dogfish beers, the balance is terrific."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"T: Definitely not as sweet as the smell would suggest, but retains that great pumpkin flavor. Toasted malt and pumpkin upfront with a tingle of cinnamon, some faint floral hops and a nice dryness with just a touch of alcohol."
""
""
""
"Poured from tap into pint at Gingerman SONO. Pours a healthy orangey color with a nice head. Very subtle pumpkin spice aromas, but you know you are drinking a pumpkin; nice sweet malt aromas as well. Taste is very subtle pumpkin spice, sweet malts, and some slight hop flavor. You know its a DFH for sure, and like usual, it doesnt disappoint. Its crisp and refreshing and not over bearing on the spice which is really nice - usually one pumpkin is all i can handle in one sitting, but i could drink lots of these."
""
""
""
""
"This is the best that a, in my opinion, weaker style can get."

"P.S. Dogfish, if by some absolute miracle you read this review... Please come back to Tennessee! We miss you. I met a couple other brew fans at our local Whole Foods where we were looking for some beer . we all 3 met in the beer aisle and reminisced of the days when it was always available. I'm sorry I took you for granted! haha. Cheers."

"Atmosphere is pretty good. Fair appearance with a great nose of fall spices. Flavor is malty and spicy. Very well calibrated. Overall, this is a good quaff."
""
""
"O - Overall this is a great pumpkin ale, the best one that I have had so far. Just delicious."
""
""
""
""
"Nose is cinnamon, pumpkin, nutmeg, molasses, some caramel malts and nutmeg. The taste is very similar. Cinnamon, nutmeg, brown sugar, malty backbone, molasses and coming in last is pumpkin. Its not the most pumpkin of the pumpkin ales but its my favorite. Although to be honest I don't experiment with them much because I have been disappointed so often (I'm looking at you Buffalo Bill's and probably some others I've forgotten)"
""
""
"O - This is my 2nd favorite Pumpkin Ale. The spicing is the best in the style. I am a big fan of Dogfish Head and this is one of the best beers they make. A Northeastern US autumn is not complete until you've had a Dogfish Head Punkin Ale."
""
""
"O: A well-crafted, easy-drinking, not overly spiced or pumpkin'd Pumpkin Ale. Great beer for the style. One of the best in my opinion. The question I always find with Pumpkin Ales is, could I have second? With this one, most likely."
""
""
"Overall - Even though I still prefer Painted Pumpkin Ladies, this comes in a VERY close for my overall favorite Pumpkin Ale. It's got rich aroma and flavors. On top of that, it's easy to drink and it warms you right up. If you can get your hands on it, I assure you that you will not be disappointed!"
""
""
""
""
"O: Pumpkin beers aren't my favorite, but it's nice to have a few each Fall. This one is up there with the Schlafly Pumpkin Ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"as far as pumpkin ales go, this is one of the top ones for me every year.. feels like i'm drinking a beer and not just pumpkin pie in a glass. it's kind of funny how taste buds change though, i used to get extremely excited over the pumpkin beer season.. but now i look in my fridge, i have maybe 15 pumpkin beers and all i'm craving is a blonde ale or an ipa."
""
""
"Overall, a decent pumpkin ale, but not the best of it's type. I enjoyed it, and it's certainly worth trying, but considering that this is usually marked-up from the standard dogfish pricing, you can ultimately find a better pumpkin ale for cheaper. Try Shipyard's Pumpkinhead if you like lighter beers or lots of nutmeg, Jolly Pumpkin's Parcela if you're partial to sours, or Shipyard's Pugsley's series for a similar, more pie-oriented, and equally tasteful pumpkin brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The appearance of this beer was a orange copper ale color that Id expect. The smell was one of the better from pumpkin beers. I was hit with the floral aromatics which included a hint of pumpkin. However, the smell was not all that overwhelming. The taste was overall good. A hint of pumpkin emerged followed by a light sweet after taste from the sugars. They say its a full body ale, but I somewhat disagree on that aspect. I think overall it was a more medium and went down smoothly. Overall a very good beer."
"Great fall pumpkin beer. The folks at Dogfish Head nailed this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
" There's a body to this brew that some pumpkin ales lack; a completeness. I don't get the sensation that I'm drinking watery beer with pumpkin spices added to the base. Beats most pumpkin ales in my book."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: More of a dessert beer, would pair well with potatoes turkey, steak, and rustic food. Might be a tad over spiced but its got a great flavor profile. Stands out among the many pumpkin ales. The only thing I didnt like was the tea bitterness."
""
""
""
""
""
"O-Punkin is not too complex of an ale, but I did find it pretty enjoyable to drink. Having it only available during the fall does play into its likeability, as at any other time it would be far less appealing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I think it's pretty obvious, I ust can't get enough of this!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Punkin probably still sits at or near the top among pumpkin beers for me because it's a solid example and feels great. It's exactly what you should be drinking this time of year... so I will."

"Dogfish Head just know what they are doing. Great beer."
""
""
"This poured with a two finger, white, fluffy head. The body itself is a cloudy orange-brown color. No visible carbonation due to the color. On the nose, it’s all those wonderful fall smells you hope for with a pumpkin beer: cinnamon, clove and hints of pumpkin. I’m all about pumpkin, so this is right in my wheelhouse. On the taste, there is a lot of hearty pumpkin which is sweet on the end. The fall spice is a little more subtle in the taste and lets the pumpkin flavor take the front seat. It reminds me of a less sweet pumpkin pie. The finish is quick, but the booze is easily hidden. This is easily one of the best pumpkin beer offerings around."
"O: Overall, a decent pumpkin brew. Not a lot yet this year, but overall very drinkable and reminds me of the season."
""
"O- Maybe I have a bad bottle? I don't think I would get this again. The beer is being trying to be bold and approachable at the same time, and it just winds up being confusing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I thought this was a good beer and a good example of a Pumpkin Ale, it had all those great pumpkin pie aspects without being over spiced and artificial tasting. This beer had good drinkability, it went down smoothly and had enough flavors to hold my attention. two would probably be my limit with this beer, it's a great choice for a cool fall night. What I liked most about this beer was the taste and the aroma, they were pretty good and just what I expect from a Pumpkin Ale. What I liked least about this beer was the high amount of carbonation, it was a little overboard and that made for a prickly mouthfeel. I would buy this beer again when looking for a good Pumpkin Ale, but it's a little on the expensive side so I can't see myself filling my fridge with it, but I recommend that anyone who likes Pumpkin Ales to give this beer a try. All in all I was satisfied with this Pumpkin Ale and so far it's the best one I have had this year, but it isn't the best one I have had, Screaming Pumpkin still has that title, but it was still good nonetheless and was much better then the last two Pumpkin Ale's I've had, good job Dogfish Head, this is one solid Pumpkin Ale."

"Outshines most other pumpkin beers. This is more balanced and less sweet than the majority of its style, and I like it for that."

"O-solid pumpkin ale, very drinkable, avoids the overly sweet approach that can make many of the pumpkin beers hard to drink in any quantity"
""
"O- overall i am a fan of this beer. Being in the industry I've tasted many horrible """pumking ales""" just poorly pieced together. This one by dogfish has its qualities without a doubt. I even have it on tap in my living room! Although I did tap an imperial pumpking as well because I feel like I can only drink maybe three or four dogfish's punkin ale before I get sick of the spices used in this brew."
"O - My 2nd favorite pumpkin beer. Tastes phenominal, and is superbly balanced... I just wish the beer was a little """bigger"""."
""
""
""
""
"I must say this is the first pumpkin ale that I've truly enjoyed. Most have done nothing for me. The appearance is a copper tan which poured an 1/2 inch head which quickly dissapated. The nose was actually kinda yeasty sour when first poured but when it warmed I could smell the cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg and brown sugar. I actually liked the taste when it was cold but again as it warmed one could tasted the cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg and brown sugar and the alocohol was not noticeable. It got beeter. Mouthfeel is kinda medium. Overall at this moment this is my favorite of the style and the first year thus far that I've actually enjoyed drinking on a regular basis. Have always heard all this hype and excitement about pumpkin ales, well the Dogfish Punkin Ale has ushered me in as one who,at least, is enjoying this offering."
"Overall, this is a solid pumpkin beer. This is the beer that I compare all other pumpkin ales too. It is the standard in my opinion and it sets the bar pretty high."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Feeds my love of fall beers. This one isn’t over the top or excessively complicated… it’s a pretty uncomplicated flavor profile that is both warming and refreshing. Very nice."
""
"O – This is a really tasty pumpkin beer. There’s a healthy dose of both pumpkin and spice while maintaining a good malt presence. I would kick back a bit on the carbonation, as I think it would help the mouthfeel and make the “full-bodied” description found on the label more believable. If the head formation, retention, and lacing were better, the appearance would get higher marks, as well. Still, this is a really nice beer; one of the better pumpkin beers and Dogfish Head beers that I’ve had."

"Overall – Good and tasty pumpkin brew. I wish it was available for more than just one season."
"o: one of my favorites, though this is definitely heavier on the spices and lighter on the pumpkin flavors. if i can recall back, I think I like this years better than last."
""
""
"this isnt as good as people say it is. it pours an orangish glowing brown color with a minimal tan bubbly head. the nose is very sweet, definitely brown sugar or molasses, nutmeg, and either some clove or some allspice. the flavor is overly spiced and overly sweet i think, it doesnt let the pumpkin shine at all. its heavy sweet up front and heavy spice in the back, and i never really get to the vegetable. in any event, its more of an after dinner drink for me than an all day beer, which is too bad because its football season now and i need an all day beer. the feel is okay, too sugary, but the body is nice and full and the carbonation is fine. if it wasnt for the sweetness itd be more sessionable. overall not my favorite pumpkin beer, and probably not worth the hype, ive got several others waiting in the fridge to compare this to..."
""
""
"O-My first pumpkin of the season was a pleasure to drink. This beer could have used a little more pumpkin and a little less spice, but I enjoyed it and will happily drink the remainder of my four-pack."
"Overall - I really do get the pumpkin here, and this becomes more prominent as it warms, I would recommend drinking this one closer to 50 degrees to get the intended flavors. This really is a nice pumkin ale, a great representative of the style. I will definitely drink a few more of these, and recommend that you give this one a try."
""

""
""

"O - DFH has crafted a good beer here, I just wished they had used more pumpkin. The alcohol could also be masked a little better, but I like that it's a somewhat big beer. Good enough to say that I'll likely enjoy another 4-pack around Thanksgiving."

"UPDATE: This afternoon DC is exhibiting some early Fall signs such as that burning smell in the air, and a bit of crispness when one walks in the shade...so I was in the mood to bust out the second DFH Punkin Ale from my 4-pack. And I'm noticing new things this time. A lot more brown sugar in the nose and taste than I noted in my original review. I don't know if I drank the first one too cold or what...but the caramel maltiness, brown sugar, and sweetness is coming out more this time around. Just thought I'd give a few additional thoughts on this one. I normally don't repeat beers very often because I'm on a """try everything you can""" kick, but I'm going to make sure I have this in my fridge on a consistent basis this Fall. Bravo, Dogfish!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Great beer to try! I had a few pumpkin ales, this is definitely one of the better ones. Everything comes together well, appearance, smell, taste/mouth feel. It is moderately priced at most retailers so don't expect the hugest bite out of your wallet, but it is definitely worth the try, and worth the buy... So if you see it get it."
""
"O - Lots of good things going on here, although most of these attributes are met with some countermeasure. I really want to lobe this one, but I have to revert to the Post Road."

""

"Tried this on tap, unfortunately, after trying a different pumpkin ale that performed much better. The pumpkin taste was too subtle, allowing the spices to slightly overpower it. Hoppy aftertaste, which I normally don't mind had a small twinge to it that I can't quite put my finger on right now."

"12 oz bottle. Pours copper with a short lived white head and lively carbonation. Aroma is of noble hops, spices and fruity notes. Body is full and crisp. Taste is spices, herbal hops, caramel malt, and brown sugar. Finish is long and spicy, while pumpkin shows up in the end. Nice holiday brew."

"D/O: """Pumpkin beer""" is not my favorite style. Let's be real: it's novelty beer. But, tis the season, and this is probably my favorite example of the style. Dogfish hasn't lost sight of the fact that they're still making a *BEER* here. The pumpkin/spice addition is pleasant, but not overwhelming. And it has great body, where other pumpkin beers tend to run a little thin. Enjoyable and repeatable every year, but not in huge quantities."
"O: Definitely one of the nicer pumpkin beers out there, although the feel could be a little better if it was fuller. Doesn't go overboard with the spices, which is nice"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A very clean and refreshing take on a Pumpkin beer , goes down easy and is perfect for Autumn ."
"O: This is a fantastic pumpkin ale. It's not in your face like most pumpkin beers, but it still delivers on flavor and is so far unsurpassed with sessionability. Hits the nail on the head with the autumn flavors. I'm not huge on DFH, but this is nice. Too bad their seasonal offerings are in four packs and quite expensive. Would love to see these in six packs."
""
""
""
""

""
""

""
"O: Good pumpkin ale overall, had better, but have also had much worse."
"Mouthfeel: Light bodied with a dissipating finish.  Pretty easy to drink for a pumpkin."
""
""
"While generally not a fan of the style, Dogfish does a nice job with this. Keeps the usually overwhelming nutmeg in check and focuses on the pumpkin more. Beautiful orange pour with a big fluffy white head. Flavor is light pumpkin, some pale malt sweetness, and just a hint of the cinnamon and nutmeg that is usually overwhelming in these brews. Light bodied, and just the right carbonation. I could drink this again."
""
""

""
""
""

"Clearing last year's batch to make room for this year's... still an excellent beer and has cellared well despit low ABV. Appearance in the glass is a dark brown with a good amount amber mixed in. Good head and a hint of cloudiness. Smells of Halloween and fall time - nutmeg, cinnamon, brown sugar, and pumpkin meat - amazing aroma. Taste doesn't disappoint and follows up with more of the same. Any fresh hops have faded away by now but not needed anyway. Great beer and looking forward to the next batch."

"Review from 10/2010 notes. Poured into a Nostradamus flute glass. Pours a medium orange amber with a light head and slight lacing. Spicy pumpkin aroma. Malt, pumpkin and spices. I like the finish this time better than the last review. This bottle has a pleasant mellow finish. Not as good as the Great Pumpkin or Pumking, but a nice pumpkin ale. I'll try it again next year."

Its sucks i have to trade for this beer now but i def. will get a 6er of this every october."

"Well this is definitely a treat, the Dogfish Punkin' Ale is the best pumpkin beer I've had yet this year! Great amount of pumpkin flavors, as well as spices, and the two are balanced nicely. I really enjoy the Smashed Pumpkin for it's heavy, up-front pumpkin flavors; and the Heavy Seas Great Pumpkin for it's heavy use of pumpkin pie spices. The Dogfish Punkin' Ale is not too intense in any direction or the other, it's balanced just right."

I stated earlier in the review, but the brown sugar stands out making this brew flavorful and sweet, but not to sweet. Great Job DFH"

"O - To me, the true test of a pumpkin beer is the ability to remind one of Fall and the feeling of Halloween. Upon reviewing this beer at the end of December, I was immediately taken back to feeling of attending Halloween parties and handing out candy to trick or treaters. This is a very well done pumpkin ale that is perfectly spiced and well balanced. A staple of the Fall. I look forward to it every year."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not impressed. The beer smelled quite good, but the taste took a dive and the mouthfeel was poor. No malt presence to balance out the cloying and drying spices. Curiously high carbonation and an overwhelmingly thin feel. My guess is this would be a massive hit among the BMC drinkers, as it tastes like a Miller infused with pie spice. Not digging it."
""
""
""
""
"O : I’d seen this one all over the place and had been meaning to give it a try. It’s certainly something unusual; the malt and raw pumpkin flavors seem to give this beer a sort of dual nature- sweet and mellow, but bright and fruity. It’s quite an interesting beer and I’d never turn one down, but I’m not quite sure what to make of it."

"Perhaps my favorite pumpkin beer. It's a tough call, but Dogfish Head's punkin' is dry, yet not bitter, spicy, but not overbearing, and vegetal, without being astringent. The flavor and aroma of the pumpkin is in the forefront here, with just enough spice to carry and enhance that profile. There's a subtle sweetness, that is not cloying and leaves the brew quite drinkable. This is beer, not a soft drink! Yet, the pumpkin is there and center stage. It's less pumpkin pie and more savory roast pumpkin mash. Fall in a glass!"

"O - I re-reviewed this ale. This is my third bottle. First was good, Second was off, and third was in-line with the first. I was looking for a bit more pumpkin, but nevertheless, a nice fall ale."
"O: Really enjoyed the beer. I would recommend it over most average to good pumpkin beers. Definitely on the more alcoholic side of other beers of this style. This beer came on heavy recommendation and I was not disappointed."
"Overall and outstanding Pumpkin Ale that was perfectly balanced and very flavorful."
"The feel of this beer is smooth and well balanced. There is a big pumpkin flavor but does not seem too big as it goes down and leaves a good spicy pumpkin aftertaste."
"(Reviewed 10/28)"
"Overall - I love this time of the year when the seasons are changing and DFH Punk comes out! This is probably my favorite pumpkin beer out there. Then again, I have yet to try Pumking by Southern Tier but I will soon enough (Thanks Keith!). I actually think the taste of this years Punk didn't quite live up to the aroma (or to last years Punk taste). But it's still quite good and definitely a winner in the pumpkin beer category. Very recommended."
"Mouthfeel is just over medium bodied and has a nice stickiness. Below average carbonation. Pretty drinkable for it's ABV and thicker mouthfeel. Overall, a pretty enjoyable fall beer, just wish it would come out later. Not the greatest pumpkin beer ever, but it's definitely a great fall brew."
"Medium body, high carbonation, sticky and lingering on the tongue. This wasn't bad, but not exactly something I'd want again."
"Don't know how anyone could rate this highly. I love pumpkin beers and this, considering the price, is as bad as buffalo bill's cheap swill."
"A nice, but not stellar, pumpkin ale... though more of a spiced ale than a pumpkin one."
"Cheers."
"O: A good pumpkin beer. Not one I'd want to grab more than a four pack of per season, but I do enjoy one on occasion."
"O- Well this one is a bit better than others I have had but the finish just is not what I am looking for. But I could drink this one again."
"Dogfish head is usually one of my favs but this year's batch showed to be a little weak. It was one of the 19 beers my friends and I sampled in a blind tatse test. It finished up in the middle of the pack. There were some real high scores this year. I posted the results at the Tristate Beer Blog : http://tristatebeerblog.blogspot.com/2011/10/great-pumpkin-tasting-results-and.html Enjoy!"
"O-Overall this is one of the best pumpkin beers brewed today. Nice balance of flavor and drinkability. Very good brew indeed."
"Though I've been fairly disapointed with many Dogfish Head's offerings lately, this is one I always enjoy and look forward to every Fall--certainly one of my favorite pumpkin ales."
"O – After recently having had an Avery Rumpkin, this tastes quite ordinary. A quality beer and that is where it ends. I’m not in love with pumpkin brews and would seek out other styles & beers. I do appreciate them not trying to recreate a pumpkin pie, but I am also glad I did not buy a 6 pack of this. 3.5"
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a caramel/amber color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of pumpkin, spices. Taste is nutmeg and cinammon up front, some mild pumpkin, a slight bitterness at the finish. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a good quality beer."
"O: An amazing beer, another home run from Dogfish Head."
"12 ounce bottle poured into my dimpled mug. Punkin pours a relatively clear orange fading to amber, with a small head made up of very tiny bubbles that rise maybe a quarter of an inch above the liquid. The aroma is at once arresting and intoxicating; liquid pumpkin pie. Spices hit the nose first, with nutmeg, clove, and spice arriving simultaneously. Pumpkin follows, though there’s also this candied yams type character as well. From the moment the beer hits your lips you know you’re in for a treat, as a crusty malt backbone holds all of the pumpkin pie flavors in place. This beer is roughly a month old; and the taste is somewhat faded. My previous experience with this beer was near euphoric; the age on the beer hasn’t done it any favors, and dropped it into the echelon of very good. That’s not to say this beer is no longer worth your time, as it remains one of the shining examples of this style. The malt in this beer acts as a framing, much as a pie crust does in a pie. There are no hops here, and why should there be … this is a unique beer and hops would just get in the way of the flavor profile of the spices and pumpkin. Too often brewers get heavy handed with spicing beers of this type, luckily the folks at Dogfish have not fallen prey to this mistake. A very enjoyable take on the pumpkin beer style and one I wish that I could sample more often."
"This is the perfect beer for September and October. Its hard to want to drink anything else."
"If i could still find this, i would buy more for the actually holiday."
"Overall: I like DFH and they never seize to keep impress me. I used to think that I wasn't a fan of the taste of pumpkin, this brew changed my mind. good job Dogfish Head on your fall seasonal again. 8.5 out of 10 as far as a pumpkin ale in my opinion."
"Pours a crystal clear copper with a 1 finger head that slowly fades, with minimal sticking to the glass. Smells of nutmeg, candy corn, fall spices clove, ginger, cinnamon. Very spicy on the tongue lots of clove and cinnamon, nutmeg, nice sugary malt, a slightly boozy finish. Light to medium on the feel, spicy and tasty finishes dry, low carbonation. This is one of the best pumpkin beers i've had, not too overwhelming, not too subtle. Well balanced and tastes natural. Good stuff, cheers."
"O: This is a very good pumpkin ale. Not my favorite style, but a very tasty example that I greatly enjoyed. I would seek this one out."
"Overall, this is a good pumpkin ale, though """good""" is as good a rating as the beer deserves. There's nothing stellar about the brew, and the slightly overpowering presence of spices somewhat detracts from the flavor profile. And unlike many pumpkin beers, the pumpkin isn't front-and-center here, but simply adds a layer of flavor to what is otherwise a brown ale (unlike, say, Pumking, which tastes almost exclusively of pumpkin pie). Perhaps this is a good thing, as the pumpkin flavors do blend better here than in many brews. I only wish the spices did the same."
"Overall: Pretty good, but not as good as other pumpkin ales I have had. I am kind of disappointed, especially in the taste department, but love the smell."
"Overall this is one of my favorite pumpkin beers that I seek out every year. While it is a tasty treat I doubt I could drink more than one in a sitting."
"Now this is a pumpkin ale. Pours a nice amber-orangish in the glass. Not very much lacing to speak of. Very sweet smell of spices hit you right away. You can definitely taste the pumpkin on this one balanced well with the spices. Very tasty but not sure that I could drink more than a couple of any pumpkin ales."
"O: A good pumpkin ale with a very nice nose. I'd prefer more vanilla and pumpkin in the flavor, but it is still pretty tasty."
"O- This is a great pumpkin beer. Thanks to bearsxco for this."
"A pumpkin beer for sure. Not a compromise, pumpkin is all over the place here."
"Really great pumpkin beer. If you're into pumpkin beers this should be at the top of your list of must tries."
"Overall a fine beer that does not make it into the top of its class. A few changes to make this beer live up to its smell would make it much better."
"Overall I really enjoyed this beer, one of my favorites!"
"O: If this had any head retention whatsoever, I'd score it a 4.5 overall..damn good beer. Also, it's pretty cool to drink a beer that started one of most well respected breweries in America."
"O: A great pumpkin beer; one of the best that I've had. I have tried many and all except Pumking has dissapointed (SA was pretty good). This is perfectly done...and I am no DFH fan. This on sale at 8 bucksish is a no-brainer for me. One of my 2 top PK beers."
"O - I'm not about the Pumpkin seasonal, but a couple people I love like them at this time of year, so I graciously tasted one or two. As Pumpkin ales go, I like this one. I visit the DFH brew pub often during the summers and I really dig their brews, so I'm not surprised that they make a good one. I think the flavor of this Punkin is more complex than most and, if you're into this seasonal, this one may be the one for you."
"mouthfeel - medium carbonation with a medium body. highly drinkable."
"O - Not bad, but not great. I'm beginning to feel like DFH is a little overpriced for what they're offering these days."
"A pretty good example of a well-rounded pumpkin ale - highly drinkable, yet nothing stands out as especially memorable."
"Overall an interesting beer to try but I'm glad I didn't get a 6-pack. Not feeling any need to come back to this one."
"Overall Experience- This is a great pumpkin beer, I usually will buy early while my store still has it in stock and will hold onto it until it starts to get a little colder out around thanksgiving. the high alcohol keeps you warm as is a solid 4 pack to pick up. With so many pumpkin ales on the market its hard to sort through them all. this is a pretty standard buy every year though."
"O: solid brew for any style, one of my favorite pumpkin ales."
"all in all, an interesting pumpkin ale. not my favorite, as the minerality and the vegetal quality of the pumkin is border-line offputting, but there's some interesting stuff that makes this one worth revisiting every year for me. and it's leaps and bounds ahead of most of the standard pumpkin ales."
"I give two Schlitz all fall for this excellent pumpkin ale. Yum."
"O: Not a terrible beer, it's just not a great pumpkin beer to me. Flavors are really mellow and tame, but the flavors mix well. The nutmeg/cinnamon aspect really dominates the drink for me, while the squashy pumpkin comes off as a secondary flavor via a slight linger. Perhaps I'd try this again on tap, but it really just tastes like another generic pumpkin beer to me. Though I will say despite being very tame/mellow, it's well balanced. A decent beer that is probably quite a bit better super fresh."
"O: a great pumpkin beer, the best I have had yet, wonderful blend of pumpkin flavor and spices, a great brew."
"O- A decent pumpkin ale, but the pumpkin wasn't very noticeable with the spices being more upfront. I always like to have one or two of these every year, but there are better pumpkin ales IMO."
"A roasted pumpkin color almost brown but glinting with orange loveliness. A moderate head fading after a few, leaving a light covering. The pumpkin is so well integrated into the solid malt core of this beer. It makes for a pumpkin bread like aroma with a firm note of sweet alcohol. Maybe a little too firm as it gives a bit of an edge that detracts a touch. An earthy hop balance is a nice counter to the sweet stuff. Taste is a unique combination of grainy malt and pumpkin that gives an overall dryness to the brew. Some nice spices with cinnamon and nutmeg. Lightly burnt caramel and fusel alcohol sweetness flow into a bready finish with earth and faint graham. Feel is medium weight and mildly carbonated. Kind of a cross between a regular and imperial. It is pretty drinkable so use caution. As it warms the alcohol tucks in a bit and the malt reveals a light coffee flavor that also shows in the nose. Drinkability goes up and the overall taste profile improves both just under the next score up. Good stuff this something to look forward to in the fall."
"O: I can't say enough about this beer. As I've been going on quite a fall-seasonal beer tear, this has got to be the best thus far. The pumpkin is right in your face and not hidden by any spices, which is pretty common with pumkin ales i feel. Also, there is a nice balance of malt and hops here that makes it very pleasent to drink. I love this brew. I wish Dogfish wasn't down in Delaware, cause I'd be soliciting at their doorstep trying to get in and bathe in the kettle every day."
"Overall (4.0): Punkin is very well balanced. What I hate about most pumpkin beers is the overemphasis on spice. Take a sniff, take a sip, and it’s half the spices in your cabinet flying in your face all at once with no tact whatsoever. Generally speaking I don’t like beers that are overpoweringly this, that or anything—I like the balance, the integration, the dance of flavors. This actually does that pretty well. My one complaint is, I wish there was some more pumpkin. I always seem to want more pumpkin from my pumpkin beers. Still, this is a good one and very well balanced."
"Overall: This was an easy to drink pumpkin beer. With a full body and full character, this is a nice fall sipper."
"O: This one is worth a shot if you like it more on the bitter side. This doesn't reflect a great deal of the pumpkin style to me, more of a fall offering. I wouldn't call it terrible, but i'm glad that I didn't get a six pack of this. *EDIT* Got better as it sat, but still not the best pumpkin I've had. Changed from 3.5 to 4"
"O: Well balanced. Doesn't taste artificial or over spiced, like many pumpkin beers."
"The first dogfish head beer I have liked. I do not enjoy IPA's at all, but this beer may be one of the best fall seasonal I have had. Hits of the fall spices and nothing overpowering. Easy going down. Very nice amber color. Slite hints of hops, but overall flavoring was key."
"D - Good seasonal drink; I'm not usually a pumpkin fan, but I would suggest this to those who are looking for a beer with good flavor, feel, and smell characteristics; definitely solid; great work again by the boys at Dogfish Head"
"O - This review is based on the pumpkin ale genre. Out of the bottle this beer is very good! I have never had it on tap but hope to change that. Of the pumpkin beers I have had this has the most body behind it. Some have the taste but are much too thin. This beer has the body behind it. Perfect for fall to early winter drinking. Great job DFH!"
"Overall - This beer is exceptional. It does not do things like pumpking where it is over the top and is not crappy like lagers with crappy pumpkin pie spice tossed in the boil or fermenter. You can TELL this has been well taken care of, i kind of wish the pumpkin shined through as much as the spices. Overall INCREDIBLY drinkable and dare me to say one of my favorite NON imperial pumpkin beers to drink...the answer is yes. Hats off to DFH for continuing great brews like this."
"O- A really excellent pumpkin ale, the flavor is awesome and has good drinkability. A very cool, tasty beer for fall."
"Overall, this is a great beer. Exactly what I would expect in a pumpkin beer from Dogfish Head. I'm glad I bought it. I will probably get more before the season is over."
"Cheers"
"O: Solid fall beer from Dogfish. It's not my first choice for a pumpkin ale but it's enjoyable. Would buy/drink again."
"M -Medium bodied with slightly high carbonation but incredibly smooth."
"An interesting beer, maybe a little too sweet for me and not enough out of the hops. It's a little unbalanced towards the malt side but something I would pick up again... Next year."
"The aroma of pumpkin pie spices is unmistakable. Cinnamon, nutmeg and a sweet pumpkin smell are easily distinguished. The head is white and beer, amber. I could use a little more hit of pumpkin on the palate though. The mouth feel is soft with a little carbonation. High alcohol content is a signature of Dogfish Head."
"Overall I need to say that I did enjoy this. I have had this many times in the past and hated it. I'm not sure if this years batch is better then years past or if my palate has tweaked itself. Hm..?? Go for it if you have the chance and the means. This is an expensive 4 pack."
"Overall, this is what you expect from a lower spiced pumpkin, the dryness of the abv comes through as it warms and the spices linger nicely."
"O: This is definitely an """off centered""" pumpkin ale. It has a bit more of a bite than its counterparts and doesn't feature the actual pumpkin tastes as much as some of the other fall beer, but it still finds a way to bring out the essence of pumpkin, and more generally, fall beer. I may be a bit biased, as this is the beer that first got me into craft brews, so it has a good amount of sentimental value for me, but it remains one of my favorites regardless."
"overall: unique essences for a pumpkin ale, unfortunately they are somewhat stronger and overpower the hop attributes, not sure if I could drink more than one or two without being overwhelmed by the spices."
"O-One of my favorite pumpkin ales, Dogfish never lets me down, great brew, perfect for the fall, glad I got a 4 pack!"
"O - despite some criticisms of finer points, this beer tastes great and is really easy and enjoyable to drink. It may not be a full feast for the senses, but I still liked this very much. Last years batch not so much, but this was just great. Maybe it should be looked at as a brown ale more than as a pumpkin ale, except for the color is kind of light for a brown. Anyway, I recommend trying it."
"This is the best pumpkin beer I've tried so far. Really like the body on this beer as well as the balance of spices and malt. I'm usually disappointed with DFH beers, but this one lived up to expectations."
"This beer doesn't compare well to Fisherman's Pumpkin Stout (another beer in my horizontal tasting), which does a good job of masking 7% ABV. I'm finding this beer to be too hot and a little too boozy. I probably won't buy this one again."
"O: A classic spice ale. This pumpkin ale is easily one of my favorites. Seems to have set the standard in my own opinion. A great compliment for when the season changes. Reminds me of playoff baseball and time to get ready for Halloween."
"Somewhat interesting brew, but not DFH's biggest success by any means. I'll pass next October."
"D: I can see why this gets alot of attention: Unlike some other pumpkin ales, it's very easy to drink more than one of. Isn't burdensome in spice or sweetness. A well done pumpkin ale, if only a little pricey at $8.99 a four pack."
"O: A little more subtle than some of the other pumpkin's I've had, but again, nothing special."
"I never thought I'd be that into pumpkin beers until I tried this one. So, you can pretty much say this is the beer that turned me onto pumpkin beers. Good job Dogfish head we love you."
"D: tasty, but i was expecting a little more meat on this one. super drinkable and it is hard to even note the 7% abv nametag. however, like i said, i was expecting some more punch of pumpkin/body."
"O A nicely spiced pumpkin beer; I just wish the brown ale underneath had a bit more umph to hold and balance the pumpkin"
"I got nothing out of it worth savoring."
"o: My first pumpkin ale. A bit disappointed as I wish the pumpkin was more predominant. Not a bad beer in itself but not something I'd go out of my way to try in the future. I'll have to give some other pumpkin ales a try."
"O: Overall it's a great pumpkin beer; one of the best that I've had. I find it hard to find a good pumpkin beer, and this one hits the spot as being well done. It has that nice hint of pumpkin and spice without going overboard. It's easygoing, and a nice one to sip and enjoy. Delicious!"
"I poured this pumpkin beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. I had seen it on the TV on a show about the brewery and wanted to try it as it sounded pretty good. I would have to tell you no I do not like it it at all. Poured it out in fact and will not buy again."
"Overall Impression- While it is the most reviewed/enjoyed Pumpkin ale, Schlafly still brings more flavor and strength! Had nice pumpkin attributes but the cinnamon was WAY to dominant. I enjoyed this thoroughly but could drink 4 more of these. Thanks again to LarryG for the trade!"
"O: As far as Pumpkin Ales go, I'm not very experienced. I imagine that this would pair very well with desert, but I'm not really sold on this beer being exceptional or exciting."
"Pours a light brown color with a two finger thick fluffy head. Feint aroma of cinnamon, clove and nutmeg. Taste follows the nose but intensified. Smooth easy drinking, slightly sweet but not too much. Great beer, something I will look toward to this time of the year"
"Overall, this is a classic in the Pumpkin Ale category - not just because DFH started brewing it over 15 years ago, but also because it represents the style spot on, and is really enjoyable in aroma, flavor, and mouthfeel."
"Overall, there isn't much of a pumpkin flavor, but still serves as a good fall harvest ale."
"Overall - A decent pumpkin ale here. I've had much better, I've had much worse. I would have liked for the pumpkin to have been a little more pronounced here, it's almost too subtle."
"Punkin’s not too heavy on the pumpkin flavors, but it’s enjoyable and drinkable. In the end, that’s all I really expected from it."
"Overall, probably the best pumpkin beer I've tried this year. A refreshing change from the liquid-candy-in-a-bottle approach that everyone seems to go for. Definitely considering buying some more of this one."
"Nice easy drinking pumpkin beer, one of the better one's so far."
"O - not amazing but so much better than most pumpkin ales. On tap is definitely the way to have it."
"This is a bit different than most pumpkin ales. This has much more spice coming from the nutmeg and cinnamon additions, and a nice sweetness from the brown sugar but not too overbearing. This is more of a spice type of beer with some pumpkin flavoring, rather than the pumpkin being the main focus of the taste. Definitely interesting and worth trying, especially if you aren't always fond of how sweet pumpkin ales can be."
"O - One of the better pumpkin beers I have had. Not the best, but it's very good with what they were trying to do. Would definitely buy again."
"M: A rich ale, the spices get a little heavy at times. That being said, I could see myself having another glass or two. Look at me, constantly evolving..."
"O- Not a bad beer. Mild pumpkin beer that isn't overwhelming"
"O: great fall brew."
"I tried this beer for three seasons in the past four - always wondering if it was just me or maybe I had purchased a beer leftover from the past year and not in the best shape, but alas it has always disappointed. Fans of it tell me that it is unique in that their is a significant hop presence. I just find it muddled and murky with regards to flavors, although I like their clean lines/packaging with regards to the bottle. I will stick with my choices of The Bruery Autumn Maple (not truly a pumpkin beer), Weyerbacher Imperial Pumpkin, and Southern Tier's Pumpkin (although it is not as good as past years and it seems that it is has much more vanilla flavor this year). Trying hard to get a friend to buy some CCB Good Gourd."
"Drinkability – This is a good beer, but I would have preferred more pumpkin and spice. Again, I felt the taste didn't match up to the smell."
"O: this is my absolute favorite pumpkin beer so far, although I have a pumpking in the cupboard I'm looking forward to! I had a few of these in a DFH off centered pint rimmed with brown sugar on a crisp fall night, and It was one of my favorite beer experiences of last year."
"overall I think it's one of the better pumpkin beers I've tried. Quite good."
"O- A very drinkable pumpkin ale that has a lot of balance."
"Recommeneded for a Pumpkin beer for at least once, but I felt once was enough and enjoyable. No need to revisit or spend more $$ on it."
"O- My first pumpkin beer. Quite tasty, and definitely want to revisit this one often"
"Overall: Heavy, not as great as other pumpkin ales but still receives my approval."
"Overall: I have never been a big fan of pumpkin ales. Dogfish definitely did this one right! The pumpkin is not the main flavor and not too strong. Best pumpkin ale to date. Cheers!"
"A good solid seasonal brew but not the home run I usually expect from DFH."
"Overall, this is a good beer. It is complex and delicious, but it was just too heavy for me to really enjoy it. I would drink it again and would encourage others to try it as well."
"Overall, not a bad pumpkin by any measure. It doesnt blow me away, but I am a tough customer at times. You could definitely do worse. Not sorry at all I drank it."
"O-The biggest shocker of the tasting for me. I almost think i need to go pick up another one to try. Last year I had this beer and though it was an A-, but the tasting gave a different result."
"O: I thought this was an awesome beer. That was the first time I had it and I would like to pick up a whole case of it. I don't drink pumpkin beers often and it was a nice change."
"O - No that impressed with this one. Thereare much better pumpkin beers out there."
"O: A very good beer. Like an IPA, just weird hops and malts! A lot of alcohol comes through for a 7% beer."
"O: Probably my favorite pumpkin beers of the ones i've tried, i have had ST and it is truly and amazing brew. However, for me i prefer more of a pumpkin beer than a pumpkin pie beer and this one fits the bill perfectly. I believe DFH has found a balance in this brew that would appeal to everyone."
"Tastes better as it warms up, but a little goes a long way. Raspy taste in the back of the throat. Oh, pumpkin? It does have a hint of candied yams."
"O: a good brew that is both complex and yet gently drinkable, another good one from the geniuses at DFH"
"Finally reviewing this stuff during, like, my twelfth tasting of it. Geez... It pours a clear tawny-amber topped by a half-finger of dirty cream-white foam. The nose comprises apple juice, cinnamon, nutmeg, and caramel. Save the light spicing, there ain't too much pumpkin (pie or otherwise) character going on here so far. The taste holds notes of mandarin orange syrup, cinnamon, green apple skin, brown sugar, nutmeg, and a very light bit of toasted rye bread. The pumpkin character is still pretty nonexistent, but at least the combination tastes good. The body is a rather light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slick feel. Overall, a more-than-decent brew, but not exactly the most pumpkin-y thing out there. Generally enjoyable, though..."
"I really enjoyed this beer. This was my first pumpkin ale because the idea never really appealed to me. It pours a nice brown/orange color. The pumpkin is very present in the smell. The taste and mouthfeel of this beer are excellent. This beer is smooth and drinkable with a sprightly carbonation and nearly creamy feel. The taste of pumpkin and brown sugar match the hops for a surprisingly balanced beer. Highly recommended."
"Price point - $8.99/4pk"
"Not a bad beer for the style, but there are better beers out there. Slightly disappointed coming from Dogfish Head."
"Pours a fairly dark amber color, with an off-white head which lingers along the surface and clings to the sides of the glass. Aromas of brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg and roast. Fairly full bodied, with nuts, figs, brown sugar and baking spices. Would go nice with thanksgiving dinner. One of the better pumpkin ales I've had."
"O - I was really let down. Too many spices going on in this beer and not enough pumpkin taste."
"O: Wow was I let down. After having Pumpking I was very happy to get a 4-pack of this and try them side-by-side. Punkin did not show up at first and when it did it left with its tail between its leg. Very disappointing."
"Orange/light brown body. Bottle popped and the carbonation shows. A lot of bubbles running up the sides of my pint leaving a thin head but something that does hang out for a while. Just like the label says there is a lot of the pumpkin and brown sugar in the nose.Also some pungent nutmeg. Flavor is balanced well between the caramel malt body, pumpkin flavor and spice. The alcohol of 7% does not show. The balance of pumpkin spices here is great. Crisp body that is light and refreshing for the higher ABV. A tingly carbonation finish."
"Reviewed along with 3 other Pumpkin ales. This had a clear, reddish-amber hue and a very small head, with minimal lacing. The aroma to me smelled more like your normal ale with only tiny hints of pumpkin and spice. The big plus is that this beer is very balanced- just the right amount of pumpkin flavor, roasted notes, sweets, and hops. This beer is very 'drinkable' anytime."
"Not bad, not bad at all but drinks more like a pale then a brown. Pump up the spices a bit boys."
"O: There wasn't enough pumpkin and spice in the nose and not enough pumpkin flavor either. The mouthfeel wasn't anything special either. I liked the Weyerbacher better."
"This is an incredibly well balanced pumpkin ale which makes it a real treat to have. Not the best pumpkin beer but in the upper echelons. Definitely not something to pass up."
"I got to try this beer on tap which was quite nice. The beer was a wonderful deep orange color and came out of the tap with about two fingers of white head. The head did not stick around but was replaced by a nice sweet pumpkin aroma that really set up this whole beer. The beer tasted sweet and of pumpkin, not pumpkin pie or pumpkin spice, but pumpkin. The beer finished sweet and left you wanting another sip. Overall it was a very nice seasonal beer. I would not want to drink it year round but it is a nice holiday treat!"
"As I come back to this beer, having been won over by DFH this past year or so, and having tried a greater variety of non-imperial and 12 oz pumpkin ales, I have to improve Punkins marks somewhat, because I appreciate it more than the first time I had some."
"O: Dogfish succeeded in producing a very good pumpkin ale. All the flavors of the pumpkin pie spices are balanced well in this beer along with the pumpkin itself. The beer never becomes too sweet, and there is even a slight hop bitterness backbone to balance. If you prefer your pumpkin beers to be on the sweeter pie side, this one may not be for you. The spice flavors, particularly in the finish, are powerful."
"As pumpkin beers go, this one should be the one you judge all others off of. It really is a solid find."
"O: I really expected a darker body for a """full-bodied brown ale.""" It's a good thing all the Brown Ale flavors seem to be there for the most part. Kudos to Dogfish Head for trying a different ale base for this pumpkin beer. Easily one of my favorite fall releases. With just a hint of pumpkin and spices, the caramel and biscuit malts shine through with brown sugar, a slight roastiness and a hint of cocoa."
"I enjoyed this and it has definitely countered some of the ambivalent feelings I've had about pumpkin beers. Kudos to DFH."
"Goes down very easy for a 7% ABV. Enjoyable beer, especially for someone who wants to try a """pumpkin""" beer but isn't a """pumpkin head.""""
"O - Solid offering from DFH. Very easy drinker and a very good fall beer."
"Overall: I'll have to say that this probably my favorite beer of the Fall season (Marzen/Oktoberfests included). Because the flavors aren't running amok, there are a lot of subtleties. A must try for those who enjoy pumpkin/spice beers."
"If you don't like spiced beers, stay away from this year's Punkin. I for one love this year's batch. The assertive spices really give this one a kick. I'll be drinking this throughout the fall."
"An enjoyable beer. Like many pumpkin ales though the spices take away some of the subtlety that I enjoy in a good brew. To be fair, though, this one does quite well at developing a flavor with some nuance."
"*interested to see how this compares to my growler review from last year*"
"Overall: Thanksgiving came early this year, and this is definitely a brew I am thankful for. But as my first pumpkin ale, it will be a difficult one to beat. Being new to this style of beer, however, I am happy I started with Punkin' because now I am encouraged to try others."
"Overall: The maybe my favorite dogfishhead and pumpking beer today but that is really not saying much. Worth a try for sure"
"Pours a copper orange with a slight head that lessens quickly. Transparent with no lacing. Few carbonation streams float to the top. It has a slight smell of corn (which I may be mistaking for the pumpkin) and cinnamon. Sweet malt background is well-balanced with the hops. Subtle hits of cinnamon and other pumpkin pie spices are noticeable but not overwhelming. It says it has brown sugar, but I'm not picking up any. The mouthfeel is rather thin, which is ok, but I think it could have a little more carbonation. Overall, its the best pumpkin ale that I have tried. I am getting more perspective on the style, and I think what turns me off is the smell of the pumpkin."
"O/D-If not for the metallic twang that sticks on the tongue, I would think this was a pretty decent pumpkin beer. That weird taste kinda kills the flavor. Four pack for $10. Not worth it. Pumpkin beers are not my favorite but I thought I would give it a try. One four pack is enough forever."
"Again, not my favorite style, but one I would buy again."
"Poured from the bottle into my Duvel tulip. One inch brown head on top of this beautiful brew. Nice dark brown color reminds me of fall. Smell was 100% pumpkin pie spice. Delicious aroma from the tulip for sure. Taste was typical easy drinking brown. I got more malt than hops (actually very little hop flavor). Perhaps the best thing was it didn't taste artificial like you'd think it could. Mouthfeel was of medium viscosity and very easy drinking for a brown. Not heavy at all. Would easily have quite a few of these. Need another one to wash down my pie..."
"O- This beer is both superb for type and superb. My experiences with pumpkin ales has generally been negative, but this one I love and wish I'd bought more than four. Definitely gonna be on the lookout when I buy beer in a couple of days."
"Medium body and ample carbonation round out the beer."
"Overall: I actually thought this was a nice beer, it was not too sweet, more malty vs. hoppy and smooth. I am definitely going to buy a 4-pack now, have been hesitant to spend the $$ not being sure I would enjoy this beer."
"Very nice head forms when this beer is poured. The hue is a nice reddish copper. The head remains for some time and leaves clear lines of retention. This is my first Pumpkin Beer. The smell is predominantly cinnamon and nutmeg with a slight hint of pumpkin and rye. Taste is all about lightly sweetened pumpkin pie. The dominant flavors are nutmeg and cinnamon, but the focus on those spices helps make this beer quite drinkable. The beer is a little light on the body. This beer needs to coat the tongue a little more considering it's a fall/winter beer. All in all, this is a good beer, and I enjoyed trying it, even though it is not my style. I still would recommend it to my friends."
"D - While I enjoyed the flavors here, the lack of a true pumpkin element was a bit surprising. However, the drinkability is nice and I barely noticed the high ABV. Overall it's a good brew and I would definitely buy it again during the holiday season."
"Overall a good beer. Not outstanding like some of DFH's other beers. I would recommend even to non-craft beer drinkers as it had good flavor combined with drinkability."
"O: Man...every year I'm really glad to see this beer again. This is such an exceptional beer. It makes me think of crisp, cool nights, families gathering around a feast and altogether good times. I should really buy a case of this stuff."
"O - My favorite pumpkin ale so far. Drank easily, without being cloyingly sweet or over the top with the spices. I really enjoy how it has some pumpkin flavor in there, and just enough of it."
"A bit of notice of the alcohol detracts some from the mouthfeel. One of the better pumpkins I've had."
"O: Alright, but doesn't really feel right to call it a pumpkin ale. It's a decent enough beer, but misnamed."
"Overall an enjoyable brew. Whilst not the best in terms of Autumn beers, it still offers a very solid pint."
"O: Not my favourite, but a worthy product, even if I do prefer some other pumpkin ales (notably, Williamsburg AleWerks'). Still, this is a good beer and a must-try for DFH aficionados. That said, I'm glad I only bought a single instead of a case."
"D - Not a bad brew, good brown ale, not too sweet, like the dry finish, leaves a nice after taste"
"The only critique I have is the head is not as full as I think it should be. Other than that a great beer."
"Overall: Basically a light brown ale with spices. Very pleasant and drinkable."
"The body is medium and quite smooth. I didn't pick up any alcohol heat despite the 7.0% abv. A very enjoyable drinker on a nice late summer Sunday."
"Overall-Awesome beer, one of the beers that got me into craft. Can't wait for the next.."
"Overall a good enough version...there are others that are better, sure. But most are not very accessible - this is."
"I've heard alot about this Pumpkin beer and it didn't disappoint, nice body and perfect not over-whelming gingerbread/nutmeg flavor..easy drinking and smooth, it left me wanting a second...and third...another Dogfish beer to look forward too come fall."
"O -- next to Southern Tier Pumking, this is one of the pumpkin seasonals I anticipate each year. This beer is incredibly balanced for a pumpkin beer; it isn't all spice and alcohol, but has a good balance of sweet and malty flavors. Made all the better by sitting outside and enjoying the awesome fall weather. Another great beer from Dogfish Head!"
"Overall: An excellent pumpkin beer. Very sweet and malty. The malty character of the beer is similar to an oktoberfest, plus you get the added pumpkin bonus. Hard to top this combo for a fall beer."
"Bad. Really bad. Tastes nothing at all like pumpkin and there are no discernible spice notes. Nice rich copper color but no head. Smells very alcoholy. Tastes just like diluted Jagermeister with a little farmhouse funk thrown in. I had high hopes for this one but was quite disappointed."
"O - Much better than fresh, but still not one I would revisit."
"Overall this feels very balanced, and gives a good mix of what is available in a pumpkin brew."
"O - Ive only had a few pumpkin beers but this is the better one. Not complex but the flavors and smells seem natural. Unlike the others I have tried. I will continue buying this every season."
"Drinkability - very drinkable well-balanced pumpkin ale. I can imagine sitting next to a chiminea on a cool fall evening munching on smores and sipping this smooth ale."
"i think i've decided i'm not much of a pumpkin ale fan in general but i will not turn this beer down if offered. one of my least favorite DFH but this is still saying a lot."
"Whatever carbonation is left helps the beer to melt over the tongue."
"A very nice approach to make a fall beer. Not really my favorite style if beer, but I must admit, for what it is supposed to be, a great beer!"
"O: I have to say I was really pleasantly surprised by this beer. I have never really been a fan of spiced beer, but this one is done very tastefully. Honestly, if it wasn't sent as an extra I probably never would have tried it! I might actually buy some more of this...."
"Overall: this is exactly how I want my pumpkin ales to taste. One of the best."
"O- My favorite pumpkin ale, bar none. While fall brings lots of delicious Octoberfests, I really look forward to this brew. Long live the king."
"Overall - This beer make me yearn for cold weather and great feasting."
" Overall, its pretty good... Pumpkin ales are mostly hit or miss, and this one is a thumbs up. It’s not as strong as a flavor as others I have tried, but it’s a good beer. It’s a bit overpriced at 9.99 for a 4 pack though."
"	The beer is lighter than I expected. The carbonation gives it a nice mouthfeel. It’s sweet, and refreshing with a spicy finish. I’d definitely like to try this with more pumpkin, and a headier malt profile to balance out the zestiness. As it warms I find myself enjoying it more and more. My first pumpkin beer of the season and from what I can tell it’s off to a good start!"
"D: Not a beer I'm begging for seconds. I don't want to be too harsh, I love Dogfish Head, but I am picky when it comes to pumpkin beers and Southern Tier's Pumking is just out of this world and at the same time I don't think Pumking really resembles a true pumpkin beer like this brown ale does."
"Overall: Oh yeah, I like this one! Love the idea of it being limited by the season as well. Will be buying a larger portion of this for the next month or two. Then look forward to it coming out again next year."
"O: A good beer with hints of greatness."
"O-great beer. Has a much more subtle pumpkin flavor the the beer which allows you to appreciate all of the ingredients that went into making it. It's not nearly as sweet as many of the imperial pumpkin ales and has more of a harvest ale fell where it shares many of the spices and components, but isn't overloaded with pumpkin. Well crafted seasonal"
"O - Bottle version very much like that on tap according to my memory and notes. A nice looking beer with very good mouthfeel, but disappointing taste. Stay away from this one if you don't like nutmeg! Boozy Punkin fairs poorly for style compared to the New Holland Ichabod Pumpkin I had yesterday: a beer loaded with natural pumpkin flavor. But Punkin is certainly an above average beer and a good choice as a Fall seasonal."
"To me this one was too subtle, I think. Really didn't hit the spot in terms of pumpkin flavor. If I'm gonna have a pumpkin beer bring it on."
"Pours a clear copper color with a creamy white head. Aromas of nutmeg, brown sugar, roasted malt pumpkin and a bit of alcohol. Toasted biscuit malt flavors with a subtle bit of baking spice and pumpkin, just enough alcohol to remind you that it's 7% abv. overall a very balanced and nuanced pumpkin beer. One to look forward to every year."
"O- Pumpkin isn't overwhelming on this and I really like their use of spices. A great fall beer and I highly recommend it to people wanting to try something a little different."
"Overall: A damn good punkin beer."
"O: I really like the smell of this beer, one of the better profiles. However, the taste was surprisingly subdued for such an upfront waft of goodness. The drying nature of the finish was a bit of a detractor, too. Not a bad beer by any means, but it doesn't really stand out among it's peers. At $8.50 a four pack, one has better options available in terms of value."
"This beer has is a coppery orange in color with noticeable carbonation, fluffy head with little retention. Excellent nose on this one, spicy and sweet it does succeed in smelling similar to a pumpkin pie, so well, done. The flavor is similar to the nose, very sweet with a blend of spices. This beer is uncharacteristic of others offered by Dogfish Head due to the noticeable flavor of alcohol; this can be a problem for some although I didn’t really mind it. Despite appearances this brew is not overly carbonated, its got a full body that tickles the palate. Another enjoyable beer by Dogfish."
"O: This is a real solid pumpkin ale and one of the only Dogfish Head ales that I hadn’t tried yet. This is by far the best pumpkin ale I have ever had."
"This is a very enjoyable and complex pumpkin ale. It was not overpowering and definitely not too sweet like so many other pumpkin ales. If you find this – be sure to grab it up."
"Overall, I think I can only handle this once a year, because the spices are too much for me. It doesn't mean it's bad, it's just a strong flavor profile. I would recommend this to anyone wanting to experiment with pumpkin ales."
"Pours a nice amber/orange color w/ a really nice two finger cocoa head. Really nice carbonation, and and decent lacing. Really nice looking Pumpkin ale. Smell is a little disappointing to me. It's got all the typical stuff, pumpkin, brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg... but it's just really on the weak side for me. I'd like a stronger more present nose in line w/ the style for a higher score. Ok... Fortunately, the taste doesn't follow the nose. It's full of flavor, and the spices explode in your mouth giving a great taste. Good, but not my favorite in the style. Feel is nice and malty, w/ a tiny bit of alcohol making itself known. Very full bodied, and a great malt backbone. Overall, this is a really nice Pumpkin ale, but I don't think it quite makes it up to my favorite for the style. Still, it's worth picking up if your in the mood for the style."
"This is the beer I've avoided for years because of the number of bad pumpkin brews I've suffered. Well, I was wrong. This is the one of the style that I will return to now that I know. What a great autumn beer."
"That said go grab one and see for yourself."
"O- Very nice session beer, well put together and made. Couldn't expect any better from Dogfish Head. I've finally found a Pumpkin beer worth buying. Cheers!"
"O - This beer is the defacto standard now for pumpkin beers in my mind. It isn't really like a pumpkin pie, so don't try comparing this to a Souther Tier Pumpking or Shipyard Smashed Pumpkin."
"Pours a beautiful golden orange color with a tiny heady and no lacing. The smell is so potent, but one of those rare good potent smells; lots of pumpkin and lots of nutmeg. The taste is just out of this world. This beer tastes like pumpkin picking, but to make notes, lots of pumpkin taste and lots of nutmeg. The mouthfeel is bright, light, and refreshing with a good amount of carbonation. This is my fall beer for sure. Perfect for autumn!"
"Nice copper color and tons of warm spices as soon as it's poured. Loads of pumpkin pie spice like cinnamon, clove, and allspice. Of course, the pumpkin in present, too. I'm getting more hops here than I have with other pumpkin ales, but they are spicy hops that pair quite nicely with the pie spices. Nice warmth from the 7% ABV, as well."
"O: Good, balanced. Favorite pumpkin ale so far."
"O: This is a fine ale. Not as much pumpkin pie flavor as I'd like, but this is definitely worth a 4 pack and I would buy again."
"Overall: C+"
"O- My favorite beer I've had from dogfish head."
"O Not as much pumpkin as I thought, but still a tasty beer. Very well balanced."
"Definitely worth a try, and to me one of the better pumpkin ales around."
"Overall, this is a good pumpkin ale. The flavors are well balanced. There are other pumpkin ales with a much stronger flavor profile, but many are not as balanced as this beer. It is not spice heavy nor pumpkin heavy. The flavors meld together well with a slight hop presence creating a nice complexity to the brew."
"Served in a pint glass. This beer has a clear copper color with a white head that doesn't linger for too long. The aroma is great, full of pumpkin and fall spices. Taste is sweet, a nice biscuity malt flavor along with the (not overwhelming) flavor of pumpkin and cinnamon. Very smooth mouthfeel, with a pleasant lingering aftertaste. One of the best pumpkin ales I've tried."
"This pours a clear amber color with a nice tan head which had good retention (miles better than the buffalo bill pumpkin I had last week). The smell is pretty good, I get some pumpkin, nutmeg, spices and sugars. Feel is medium to light. Taste is pretty good, its sweet, I get some cinnamon and brown sugar, pumpkin and once again a little bitterness in the after flavors which seems to be in all pumpkin beers (I like it though, its not a hop type of bitterness though). Overall this one is pretty good."
"Overall: The great pumpkin strikes! A really quality pumpkin ale that mellows the soul and zones the drinker into a fall setting; leaves tumble, but I don't have to rake 'em. Well done, DFH."
"Pours a classic brown ale amber with a thin collar of eggshell white foam leaving light lacing. The nose has allspice and cinnamon upfront, faint hints of banana custard and clove - the pumpkin is almost barely there to me and not sure i could pick it out had i not known thats what the beer is. The mouth is full of baking spices along with yeasty esters, the pumpkin is a bit more noticeable but so is the alcohol leaving a drying, astrigent feeling in my mouth. Far from an upfront pumpkin beer almost more of spiced belgian ale to me, really not a huge fan. 2011 release."
"Glassware: 12oz bottle into Snifter"
"O - My favorite pumpkin beer. Damn good beer period."
"I'm so sad this didnt live up to my expectations this year. Taste was very low key. Not much to taste, makes me sad. Possible my tastebuds have changed but I just dont know.."
"Overall: Like I said its probably my favorite pumpkin beer, because it still taste like beer. It also has a nice balance of spices, without overwhelming the pumpkin and hiding its flavor and aroma."
"Not sure why its packaged as a brown ale, it's closer to a pale ale."
"I can't understand why this beer is described as a """full-bodied brown ale""" on the box. Coming from one of my favorite breweries, and one that excels at Brown Ales (see Indian Brown and Palo Santo Maroon), I was thoroughly disappointed. Subtlety is not a word that I'd use to describe Dogfish Head, but this beer was so disappointing. I bought three 4-packs today out of sheer excitement and I've never been more let down with a beer."
"O: really nice pumpkin ale, I would buy more of this for sure."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass, the beer is a slightly hazed light brown coloring that is mostly translucent. The head started massive out of the bottle, but settles into a more reasonable half inch of off-white, big bubbled, frothy head. Aromas are heavy with spice, and I could pick up a lot of nutmeg and all-spice, with a sweet pumpkin background. Flavors are roasted, and you get a great blend of the pumpkiin and malt sweetness to balance out all the spicy characteristics. The beer laces the glass heavily, and the body is smooth and creamy, with a sharpness to it from the spicing. The aftertaste is surprisingly short-lived, with a slight pumpkin pie flavor, and the finish is spiced, short and sweet. Tasty fall brew!"
"89."
"Definitely an interesting take on pumpkin beer."
"O: This as my absolute favorite beer of 2010, unfortunately it isn't living up to memories this year. I attribute that, possibly, to the early harvesting of the pumpkins. I'll wait a month to buy another."
"Pours a deep amber-brown with a nice full head. The nose is fairly complex with an assortment of spices and a nice earthy hop aroma. Palate is balanced and delicious. The malts and spices compliment each other and the pumpkin flavor comes through in the finish. There is a nice viscous mouthfeel that coats the mouth very well. This brew impressed and is worthy of it's popularity."
"O: An easy drinking pumpkin ale. Not too sweet and not too spicy."
"O: Overall, this isn't really my thing and it was hard for me to finish my GF's wounded soldier, but that doesn't make it a bad beer at all. I think if yr in the mood for a pumpkin ale, this is a fine candidate."
"O - probably the best pumpkin beer I've had yet. It has more body than most, which is a plus for me."
"O: DFH is going more for the pumpkin pie flavor than actual pumpkin. This is easy drinking and really gets me pumped for fall, even with the upper 90 temps outside. Fairly solid for the style."
"Another pleasant pumpkin. Very reminiscent of Weyerbacher's pumpkin in blend of spices and delicious pumpkin flavor. Nice cinnamon and nutmeg flavors, hops are just noticeable. I can definitely sit and drink 4 of these. It's nice to have a pumpkin on a brown ale base. Excellent beer."
"Overall- A great success, pretty much my favorite pumpkin beer. Cheers!"
"very nice beer we got here!"
"The mouthfeel is a little heavier then average, but pretty normal for the style and size of the beer. Carbonation is moderate. Overall it's definitely one of the better pumpkin beers of the season. I'd probably put it in the lower end of my top 5 favorite pumpkins. Very solid beer of the style all around and one we buy every year."
"A nice seasonal from DFH, but this years (2011) just didn't bring the same intense flavors that I remember the last two years."
"I still have 2 more of these babies in the fridge, next time I’ll start much closer to room temperature as this ale got better the warmer it got."
"O - pretty good pumpkin brew for sure, just need to mellow out the alcohol burn on the back end"
"This is easily my favorite pumpkin beer, one of my favorite spiced beers, and I look forward to getting it each year."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability - I definitely prefer the tap version of this beer over the bottled one. It has a lot more of the fresh pumpkin taste I've been longing for. There is also a delicious mixture of spice throughout which stands out more in the tap-version. Very solid all around."
"O- One of my first pumkin ales and I really enjoyed it. Not overly sweet or spiced, a quality brew here."
"Incredible!"
"O - I can't say I have had many tasty Pumpkin flavored beers. This one is very tasty. I have a new favorite beer for the fall season"
"Overall a solid example of the style, but there are a couple that better meet my personal tastes."
"Overall this was tied with the Elysian for best pumpkin ale among our group (Elysian had better nose and flavor but fell short of the texture and finish of this one). It's really quite a lovely beer."
"From notes. Tasted from bottle at Lush Roscoe. Pours clear amber with a thin but frothy white head that leaves a nice lace collar. The nose shows nutmeg, brown sugar, orange flesh, and cinnamon. There is also some type of fruitiness, but I don’t think that without the influence of the name, I would distinguish it as pumpkin. The pumpkin flavor definitely does not disappoint, along with the cinnamon and nutmeg flavors. The beer is sweet, but not as sweet as the brown sugar on the nose would have suggested. The body is medium with average carbonation and a long cinnamon finish."
"This is probably my second favorite Pumpkin Ale that I've had. It had been first until I tried the Southern Tier Pumking. However, this ale poured out as a nice looking copper color with a fizzy white head on top. The smell of the beer has a pretty good spicy aroma to it with some malt in there too. The taste of the beer is pretty impressive compared to a lot of other pumpkin ales out there. The taste of pumpkin and spice really blend nicely together. The mouthfeel has a good solid body to it with a good amount of carbonation in there. Overall it's one of my favorite seasonals for sure. I look forward to the release every year. I normally pick up a 4 pack when I see it."
"T: allspice and nutmeg are very strong, drawn over a very hoppy ale for a base; the pumpkin element is too strong for my taste; had this been more subdued, I would have rated it higher."
"What an awesome beer. I had cases of this stuff last year, and got it on tap every chance I had, where it really shines. I can't wait for September to roll around to get more. What a marvelous combination of nutmeg, cinnamon, cardamom, vanilla, and other lovely stuff. It's got a bit of a bite, and the flavors are strong. Some might not be able to handle much of this at a time, but this could be a daily beer for me if only it were brewed 365 days a year."
"O - Very nice pumpkin ale that always reminds you of pumpkin pie but in liquid form."
"A very different beer, the spices makes it hard to grasp. But complex and intriguing."
"Overall - the flavors play together really well. I have great respect for Sam and his work over at Dogfish Head. His Brewing a Business is a great book and this beer is amazing for its ability to withstand some age still taste good. i was shocked at what this beer brought to the table 2 years later. Very good. Thanks Thorpe!"
"Cheers."
"Taste- very malty,and more pumpkin pie spice than actual pumpkin flavor. A wee bit much carbonation for my taste... I like it but I think this beer is way over hyped... honestly you can taste more pumpkin in Sam Adams Pumpkin Ale."
"Poured into my pint glass small head with a copperish/orangish tint to it. Smells like pumpkin but not too strong. Tastes just as the bottle reads pumpkin and spices. A bit of strong taste and mouthful but otherwise good. Overall a good beer especially during Octoberfest"
"overall, this is a pretty good beer"
"Drinkability - Verk drinkable. It makes me wish it was Fall."
"This beer really has most of the characteristics of a brown ale, but adds in the pumpkin and spices nicely. The pumpkin and spices are well balanced throughout the beer and don't overwhelm you at all. The head on this pour didn't get too big, probably 1", and didn't lace all that much. Very nice fall beer."
"Probably should have drank this sooner. A dirty amber color with a small head. The spices are nutmeg, cinnamon and some clove. The flavor has really weakened over the cellars time. Slight cloves and nutmeg but really mellow. The mouthful is good since nothing is overpowering and the alcohol, at 7%, is not noticeable. I really enjoyed this fresh but never reviewed it then, would have rated it higher."
"When I first tasted this, it was rather cold, and I was disappointed in the lack of pumpkin. It is, after all, a pumpkin beer. But as it warmed up, the flavors came through much more fully, and I was able to enjoy the spices, the malts, and the pumpkin in concert."
"Poured hazy burnt orange-brown with a nice foamy white head. Smell of pumpkin, sugar and spice, sweet malts. Pumpkin pie flavor and just a bit of bitter hops for balance. Mellows out a little when it breathes and comes up in temperature a bit. Medium mouthfeel, overall smooth, and very drinkable, depending on how much pumpkin you feel like drinking."
"2010 Vintage! Served from bottle into a Stone nonic. Poured red-orange with a half finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, cinnamon, clove, and pumpkin. The flavor was of sweet malt, nutmeg, cinnamon, clove, and pumpkin. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty tasty brew. I know that I was having this one a little late and likely past its prime going into it, but it still managed to be pretty nice. Not my favorite offering I've had from the style, but still definitely a tasty brew. All aspects of this one were good and in the right portions to keep you wondering what was next. A definite must try for any fan of the style!"
"D-I have to remind myself that the ABV on this is not all that low b/c I want to drink more and more of it...fall and this beer are made for each other."
"Overall. Good, easy drinking, and not overdone with offensive spicing. I actually tasted some pumpkin and enjoyed this."
"Get this even if you have you have yet to find a pumpkin beer you like, this one may convert you, it's really delicious."
"2010 bottle: Into a DFH pint glass on 3.23.11. this yields a clear and bright copper color under a well-sustained head. Also a great lacing throughout...The nose here is a deep and spicy one with notes of brown sugar, nutmeg and that overall lovely pumpkin aroma that fills the air when fresh pumpkin pie is baking...The aroma notes here are all very indicative of what I pick up in the taste as well. Mouthfeel is carbonated to just the right level where the flavors shine through beautifully together and the malt can work its smooth magic on the palate. I can't wait for next year's batch and hope to try this on tap and/or cask as well..."
"The cpj"
"Cheers!"
"The taste is a little disappointing in my opinion. Yes, I can taste the ingredients used but I expected it to be a bit more full-bodied. That's probably just my bias toward full-bodied beers talking but that's my preference. Even though the ABV is only 7%, you can still taste the alcohol well. It's still a good beer though. I definitely recommend it for the Fall season."
"Overall: A nice seasonal offering from DFH that unfortunately needs a couple months to condition before I can drink it. The peak for my own preference was mid January. If you can contain yourself you should try aging one for a couple months and see how you like it."
"Had this on tap at City Beer store in San Francisco. Reviewing from my notes from November. I thought I was going to miss this beer this year again, but I travelled from the east coast to the west coast and caught up with it. Pours an amber-orange colour with thin white head with some lacing. Smells of pumpkin pie pretty much, lots of cinnamon and nutmeg with brown sugar. Nice sweet flavour. This is just what you'd want in a pumpkin beer."
"D - Overall, very nice; a pumpkin beer that doesn''t overdo the sweetness or the spices."
"D: Not my favorite pumpkin beer, it needed a little more thickness to it and a heavier pumpkin flavor and a little less spice. Still a very drinkable beer though."
"D: gotta say it was a solid pumpkin and is probably one of my top five as far as the style goes. It was tasty and drank good."
"A beer that the quality has declined noticably over the years. I still prefer the tap over 12 oz bottle which is usually poured in a pint glass. Pours an orange-copper with a light ring of foam. Sugary aroma with light spice. Alcohol is very present in the taste, with ginger, nutmeg, and cinnamon in the background. Wow! Thin carbonation, decent body. What an interesting approach to pumpkin beer - high alcohol really surprises. Great spice, but where's the pumpkin?"
"D: Wonderful and warming. Slightly better with age, but after 3 months or 12 months it essentially drinks the same as it does in season. It doesn't age like some of Dogfish's bigger beers. One is good but two are better. This is everything you could hope for in a pumpkin ale."
"This beer is amazing. I can't wait until September so I can pick up a case. It has an amber appearance. It had a nice 1/2""" white head with good lacing. It has a nice roasted pumpkin and brown sugar scent. It tastes incredible, with the brown sugar and all spice being more relevant than an overwelming pumpkin flavor. I can taste the cinnamon and nutmeg as well, but it's not overbearing. It is a very smooth and drinkable beer, with the alcohol being hard to detect, which is preferential in a beer like this. It lived up to expectations for sure."
"D: This is solid but more pumpkin flavor would be nice."
"Smooth, yet lively mouthfeel providing a very drinkable ale in a style the is typically a one-off for me. Incredible balance."
"Dogfish Head's description led me a bit astray, as I expected some sweetness and a heavier body. I didn't get either."
"D - Very drinkable, one of the only Pumpkin beers that I can stand to have several of."
"Drinkability: I have not found a pumpkin beer I liked until this one. Oh how I wish this was distributed here. Could have several of these in one sitting. This might be a good one to share with BMC drinkers to open their eyes."
"Drinkability: A tasty and thirst quenching brew."
"DFH Punkin ale from 355ml into DFH globe @ 48*. Pours a nice light amber with a 1""" off white head that sticks around for a few minutes. Smells of light caramel malts, light cinnamon, a bit of ginger, and a pleasant hint of pumpkin. This brew tastes good, like really good. Light caramel malts up front with a good dose of the pumpkin, a bit of cinnamon, and a little clove. There is a tad of hoppiness to this brew but its really toned down. Overall a really good pumpkin ale with excellent spice notes. Now I wouldn't regularly pick up 4pk for $9.99 but I managed to find these on sale @ a weird package store for $7.99 a 4pk. I went ahead and bought the last 3 they had, and I'm glad that I did! Cheers!!"
"Good job once again Dogfish Head"
"This makes a pumpkin ale that is a must have each fall season!! Too bad it can be so hard to find!!"
"In 2007 I sample this beer. At that time, I did not think that it surpassed Brooklyn Brewery's Post Road Pumpkin Ale. It must has been an off year because there is no other pumpkin beer that can match Dogfish Head's Punkin Ale. It has the perfect balance of spice, pumpkin and brown sugar flavor. Fall is my favorite season and I think it is because Punkin Ale is the taste of the season."
"The mouthfeel isn't overly carbonated, and has a slightly creamy feel. I think this is highly drinkable and perfect for fall."
"Serving type: bottle"
"D - I could easily drink more than a few, but never have enough in the fridge. Wish I could get ahold of a case instead of 4 at a time."
"DELICIOUS, MUST HAVE!"
"D: Very good. I enjoyed this more as it warmed in the glass."
"D: A lot of fun to drink. Happy Holidays, drink up!"
"Pours an orangey/amber with a two finger light tan head. Good lacing and retention. Nice aroma. Cinnamon, all spice, nutmeg and pumpkin. The spices dominate the flavor, cinnamon and all spice primarily. Sweet malts. The pumpkin flavor is secondary, but present. Very fall-like, warming pumpkin beer."
"Drinks very well. I would certainly recommend as a great thanksgiving or holiday treat!"
"M: Very smooth, creamy mouthfeel. Nice medium to full body."
"D: Very high, really an enjoyable fall brew."
"I recall in years prior enjoying this beer much more than the present. Perhaps they've changed the recipe, it's difficult to say. The taste isn't as enjoyable as it once was; I don't understand the sweetness factor present now. I'll still see if I can snag this next year and find if anything has changed, but I'm currently no longer impressed by this offering."
"Poured a fantastic deep orange, amber with thin head. Nose is pumpkin and cinnamon. All-spice lingering. Honey-sweet malt presence. Sweet start with high carbonation. Pumpkin dominates the rest, and the all-spice has a clove-like effect. Crisp mouthfeel. Highly drinkable!"
"D: This is very well rounded. Most pumpkin ales a so full of spice that you may really only want them around the holiday. I think this brew is great year round."
"THe appearance of this beer is a copper color, with a white foamy head. The aroma smells of pumpkin and pumpkin spices. The taste is sweet, and the pumpkin pie spice is strong. The hops and the malt are almost lost in the spice flavor. The mouthfeel is medium, and I would consider this a drinkable beer."
"This is an awesome beer that screams fall. It is delicious, but because it's such a unique taste it's not necessarily one that you would want a bunch of in one sitting. I guess that's nice seeing as it comes in a four pack."
"D: Very easy to drink because it's not overly done on the spice end. Would be delicious with a pumpkin pie."
"drinkability; sits heavy in the stomach and the ABV is high but it taste so good that these factors are less of an issue."
"Surprised by how dry this beer is; I recalled it being sweeter and malt-forward. Maybe that's part of it's charm. Nevertheless, this is a solid pumpkin beer and I can see buying a 4 pack a year.... maybe more."
"O: Pretty good, but I still think Schlafly makes the best pumpkin beer out there. Still a solid effort and I'd pick up a sixer of this again if I saw it. Pretty drinkable but I think I'd get bored with it after a few."
"Smooth and slightly prickly, this brew tastes of more pumpkin pie spices. Sweet malts are complemented by the gentle warming of alcohol. Medium-bodied and very drinkable."
"Sampled during the Winter 2010 tasting, brought by Deuce."
"Punkin pours a deep, dark orange, that lightens and clears considerably when properly lit. The beige head rises to about two fingers in stature, but doesn't stick around all that long, nor does it leave much evidence of its former existence. Nose is pretty much what one would expect from a well made pumpkin ale. Pumpkin comes through, along with an intriguing blend of spices (cinnamon and nutmeg come through better than the allspice). Brown sugar was advertised on the bottle, and while it didn't show up in the aroma it comes through just fine on the front end of each sip. That and an improved allspice presence among the pumpkin and spices on the back end really take this beer to the next level. Carbonation is fine, middle of the road in terms of intensity. Punkin could stand to be a little bit more rich though, the body comes across as a little thin for a decent sized pumpkin ale. Punkin is a very good beer, it's got a great flavor but some of the other aspects are just a bit off. Still, another quality beer from Dogfish Head."
"I had to try this one. I picked up a couple of these. First off it has a darker golden appearance. THe scent is there with the punkin and nutmeg.The taste at first takes a little time to get used to because this isn't something you have all the time.Taste is punkin all the way. But once my taste buds got used to it.Drinkability became very easy.I also felt that 7.2 abv.I was ready to drink more and buy more the next day.Only thing is you get four for 8.99 or 9.99.Man I want at least six for that price.So I can share some with punkin lovers.But I will definitely buy more next fall."
"[This beer earns a score of 4.35 on draft]"
"I'm struggling to put down a whole one of these. It really tastes more like a winter warmer to me. Not as pumpkin ale like as I was thinking it was going to be. I will not be having this one again anytime soon. There are several other better pumpkin beers than this one."
"Poured into a Brooklyn Brewery pint glass. I have three of these left for thanksgiving, might as well review one now though. Pours a copper/burnt orange color, semitransparent. Surprisingly large head with outstanding lacing. Smells of nutmeg, clove, cinnamon, smells like a bakery. Massive amounts of cinnamon come to the forefront of the palate, with nutmeg and other, more subtle spices coming to prominence halfway through the taste, and the alcohol pokes its head through during the finish in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is decent, the finish is a bit rough, but it is full bodied and filling. This beer is definitely a sipper, but I came back time and time again for this one and I'm glad I saved a few for next thursday."
"Very nice head forms when this beer is poured. The hue is a nice reddish copper. The head remains for some time and leaves clear lines of retention. The beer effervesces continuously helping to maintain the head. The smell is predominantly cinnamon and nutmeg with a slight hint of pumpkin and rye. Taste is all about lightly sweetened pumpkin pie. The dominant flavors are nutmeg and cinnamon, but the focus on those spices helps make this beer quite drinkable. The beer seems to be a little light on the body. This beer to coat the tongue a little more considering it's a fall/winter beer. All in all, this is a good beer, and if one plans on drinking more than one, all is well."
"Pours a deep orangish copper/brown. Bubbly head that settles at a thin film after about ten seconds. Very strong pumpkin pie spice smell. Clove, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, anise, all these and probably more are in there. There is also a fresh pumpkin smell like when you carve into a jack-o-lantern. Flavor is malty sweet and fruity at first. More of that fresh pumpking smell/taste comes out. The spice takes over every other flavor quickly. In the end, the only other flavor is a hint of booze on my lips. I've never been a fan of the spiced pumpkin beers. Every fall I try to keep an open mind, but the spices always turn me off. It was hard to finish the bottle. If you are into pumpkin beers, this is a probably a great one. It's just not for me."
"Actually one of the better pumpkin ales I've tried but Smuttynose's kills this one, more depth and seems more authentic."
"While I personally still prefer the smell and mouthfeel of the Shipyard, I must say that this is a STELLAR beer. I think I'm headed back to buy the rest to have on Thanksgiving!"
"Overall an interesting beer, but not really what I'd hoped for, and not up to par with Dogfish's other offerings. In the past, this was an in your face nutmeg bomb, but it's now evolved into a more balanced nutmeg beer. I'm satisfied with my 12oz and may revisit in a year, but I'm glad this one doesn't have 5 friends in the fridge, and I won't be anxiously waiting for this one to come around again."
"D: I've read the posts that say that the Punkin' Ale this year is not as good as the one last year, better than the one last year, blah, blah, blah, blah... Whatever... I totally see the appeal of this beer to thousands, making it one of the top selling pumpkin ales (or seasonal brews in general) on the market. I dig it, and totally respect it."
"Really good pumpkin beer on of the best I have tasted because you get a """real""" feel of the spices and body is good. Tastes similar to a pumpkin pie. Warning: Could be too sweet for some. This comes in a four pack and I am always sad wishing had I more once it is gone. Seasonal beer as well."
"Poured to about a one inch head. Head was slightly orangish in color. Head didnt hang around very long but did leave a little lacing. Ale itself was kind of a goldish brown. Had a sweet smell along with pumpkin, cinnamon and nutmeg. Wasnt as strong as what I had expected. The flavor was actually mild. just of cinnamon, nutmeg, and pumpkin. Then again, nothing overwhelming. All the flavors were on the mild side. Felt good in the mouth. I thought the carbonation was about right. I wouldnt mind a few of these at Halloween time. I just dont think it would make a good session beer."
"This beer poured an orangish/copper color and had a large amount of carbonation. The beer had an aroma of pumpkin, spice-nutmeg I believe. It had a fairly strong pumpkin and nutmeg taste. It was smooth, light, and very drinkable for a fall pumpkin beer."
"D: This one is a great fall/winter beer. Drinking it on a cold NY night, and its really nice. Love the crispness you get here, especially with the carbonation and spice characters."
"its good not the worst but not the best the spice is bold and gets annoying after a while"
"Taste: Nice balance of spices, no one spice is too dominate. Good pumpkin flavor. Smooth and not too heavy, medium carbonation. Very drinkable, goes down more like a 5 or 6%."
"Overall: Another review done mostly out of memory. Not my favorite Dogfish Head brew, but then again, I like pretty much all their beers I've tried."
"Overall an excellent example of a pumpkin beer, it is worth trying."
"Always a treat to have Punkin on tap. A great looking pumpkin beer. For me, Punkin has the perfect balance of pumpkin spices in a beer. It doesn't even taste like a 7%, either, allowing great drinkability. This beer gets better as you drink it. The first sip might not come off all that well. Further into it, though, I find myself enjoying its array of spice flavors and not wishing for more or less spices. It holds up well over time, too."
"Amber with a slight chill haze. White head that quickly fades to a film. Poor head retention. Strongest aroma characteristic is cloves, followed by bready sweetness. Bit of a carbonation bite up front. Malty and sweet up front. Middle is redolent with cloves and also sweet. The alcohol also shows its head about here. A nice finish with a hint of hops. Medium mouthfeel."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle with 2010 bottling date. 2 fingers of immediate very bubbly head with awful retention. Diarrhea brown body. Little bit of lacing, but not much. Persistent bubbles. Hit of pumpkin pie off the bat. All those wonderful spices, nutmeg, etc. Some sort of Pilsner hop smell. Spicy goodness. Nice rich brown ale flavor. Toasty, spicy, slightly sweet. Light lingering bitterness. Very dry on the mouth. Sticky. Nicely drinkable for 7%."
"There was a more pronounced pumpkin flavor than the other pumpkin ales I've had this year. That being said, the upfront flavors are the aforementioned spices. There was a mildly malty flavor there as well. Finished bitter - didn't really get any of the sweetness that I was expecting after reading 'brewed with brown sugar' on. Medium body, medium carbonation, somewhat dry finish. It was a good pumpkin beer, but I think the spiciness would keep me from drinking multiples."
"D: A bit too sweet for my taste. Would try it on tap, but not out of the bottle again."
"drinkability - great example of a pumpkin ale, good flavor"
"Overall, a benchmark for the style."
"Nice pumpkin beer that shows all the right spice motes with a moderate ale as a base. Not as complex as Elysians Night Owl or as rich. Still a very drinkable example of the style that for a lot of people defines the genre. The golden colour is pretty in the glass"
"Drinkability -- Not terribly impressed by this one, honestly. Spice and pumpkin are muted, hops are too forward, and there's this strange astringency that made this hard for me to get into. Admittedly, this is one of my least favorite styles, so your mileage may vary."
"Last night, I finally had a chance to sit down and crack open the growler and was quite satisfied by this ale. It, of course, poured with abundant head - cottony, fluffy. leaving strands of lacing. Yellowish amber hue and clean. Wonderful balance in aroma and flavor. Spices are present, thankfully not in a pumpkin pie bouquet, but they merely lend touches to what is actually a lovely pumpkin/malt blend. The pumpkin (and some faint nuttiness) steps forward in the taste, while the malt and spices seem to lead the scent. What I really appreciate and enjoy here is that the pumpkin is featured quite well, not pushed down or muted by a loud lousy concoction of pie flavorings, as many of these ales are. The pumpkin comes across a little roasty as well. The beer drinks medium-bodied, clean, and somewhat dry. An all-around well-constructed pumpkin ale experience."
"Overall: If you like pumpkin, you'll like this; end of story. A lot of people think they like pumpkin, but actually like all the spices that pumpkin dishes are prepared with. Remember, pumpkin is a gourd; a vegetable, not a sugary cinnamon pie. That being said, I like this beer. Definitely one of the better pumpkin ales. It tastes natural and fresh, nothing artificial about this one at all. Make sure to let this one warm a little because the sweetness comes through with warmth."
"Mouthfeel/Drink-ability - Desert drink. Decent pumpkin brew. Taste is a mixture of nutmeg, spices and cinnamon.."
"Here's a seasonal I could drink year round."
"Drinkability - A great fall seasonal from Dogfish Head. Nice balance between spice and sweetness and a supremely creamy body. I wouldn't mind having a couple pints of this over the winter months as well!"
"O - there are better pumpkin ales out there."
"Edit: I now drink this every fall season. It is a great beer that I wish Dogfish would build off with other beers, as opposed to their constant IPA infatuation. I spoke with a beer distributor, who told me the Dogfish Punkin sells out day 1, and the other Punkin beers sit there for a month until they are taken. It is by far, the best Punkin beer out there."
"D- Would have been nicer if it had a bit stronger pumpkin taste, but overall a very nice fall beer"
"D- Swigging down a four pack is too easy. Absolutely elegant."
"D - too light on the pumpkin, decent spice highlights, a little thin and the alcohol was present, not the best i've had this fall"
"Poured a nice brownish orange color with a decent head that left a nice lacing on the glass. A lot of different scents in this like nutmeg, pumpkin, cinnamon, brown sugar, and a little bit of hop presence. Tasted better than a lot of pumpkin ales that I've had. Had a nice balance, the pumpkin was definitely there but not too sweet. You could taste all of the spices that you could smell, but none of them were too stong. Mouthfeel was good, went down smooth, nice medium body, and a decent amount of carbonation. Drinkability was good, and I would definitely have a couple more of these. Cheers"
"Definitely one of my favorite fall beers."
"My sister in law isn't generally a beer person,but I've been giving her small samples of beers. She's liked some big stouts and handled some hoppy IPA okay. She liked Saranac's sweet but uninspired Pumpkin Ale. This...was the first beer she handed back to me...could not finish a 3 oz sample."
"A nice, spicy, hearty fall ale, with a just a bit too much octane to make it a serious imbibing contender."
"One of the best pumpkin ales on the market IMO b/c it's taken in a different direction than most others."
"To continue with the perfection of this favorite brown ale, the taste was the complete embodiment of the nose, only with the liquid sustenance. It was lightly spicy right off the bat, keeping my tongue tingling with happiness while cinnamon, pumpkin pie, and a generous amount of caramel washed over it. All of this was accompanied by nutmeg, brown sugar and allspice - all of which are extremely complimenting of each other; no one flavor tries to dominate the others. The mouthfeel was smooth with a medium body, like a heavy silk, and everything is supported by just the right amount of carbonation. It ends slightly dry with very little bitterness, and pulls everything together with a comforting warmth from the 7% ABV...which gives it an A+ in my book."
"Fairly aggressive pour leaves 2 fingers on thick creamy head, which recedes after a few minutes leaving some nice lacing in my tulip. I get some spices in the smell, mainly cinnamon & nutmeg. Initial taste is of the spices mentioned in the nose, I get more and more pumpkin as this ale warms. A bit of a bitter finish, but not in a bad way. DFH Punkin is a very nice pumpkin ale, that is always worth seeking out when the leaves begin to fall."
"A solid pumpkin ale but not the best and I'm a DFH fan."
"The beer pours a burnt orange, with a white head that dissipates quickly. Delicious smell like a pumpkin pie, spicy with cinnamon nutmeg and the all spice. The taste brings a perfect medley of flavors, sizable malt flavor with all the spiciness of the cinnamon, nutmeg, and all spice. The beer is smooth with a nice sweetness and subtle presence of pumpkin. I can drink this over and over again."
"Pours a dark reddish brown with an off white head that fades fast. The spices are apparent in the smell but not overpowering. The smell has some great malt presence mixing well with the nutmeg. The flavor is a nice blend of nutmeg, cinnamon, and all spice. The bottle says it is brewed with brown sugar, so I expected some sweetness, but no sweetness comes through. This one has a medium mouthfeel, but has a hearty feel to it. This one is a great drinker as far as pumpkin ales are concerned, the flavors come together nicely, and do not overpower. This one is a great fall beer, very enjoyable."
"D - Very drinkable for a 7% pumpkin brown ale that is well balanced and not over the top with spices."
"Well, it's 7% ABV, but still wonderfully drinkable and not too, too heavy."
"Clean, with a nice hop bite. Still, it's a bit overbalanced toward the spices rather than the sweet malt or actual pumpkin. A nice beer nonetheless, but seekers of big pumpkin flavor should look elsewhere."
"D - Good, but not great. I'd like a touch less spice, a little sweeter finish, and a little more malt flavor. Still, it's worth picking up during the fall of the year. I have a bottle left from the 4-pack, and I'll probably hang onto it until next year to see how it tastes."
"D/O- Easy drinker. Wasn't ridiculously upfront with the cinnamon like another Pumpkin Ale I've had recently, which is good. Seems more 'balanced' with the flavors. DFH is famous for it's off-centered beers but this one seems to be right in the center of it's style...meaning if someone had not had a pumpkin beer, this would be the one to give them. Flagship for the style?"
"DFH never disappoints w/ this one. This is definitely one of the better pumpkin ales on a large scale. I can't go an October without this beer.. it screams fall."
"D: Although referred to as a """full-bodied brown""" ale on the label, this is more like a pale ale with aggressive spices added. The unpleasant flavors here may lend themselves more acceptably to the company of mild savory dishes, but taken alone they cannot help but be called into question."
"OK...if you're looking for pumpkin pie in a glass...go get a Southern Tier Pumpking. If you're looking for the flavors of cinnimon, brown sugar & nutmeg with some pumpkin hints, then this is your beer. Pours nice amber color and initial aromas are cinnimon and spice. Flavor is nutmeg with some brown sugar and slight pumpkin flavor. Very nice pumkin beer. I put this one at number 3 on my pumpkin beer list behind Southern Tiers Pumking and Weyerbacher Imperial Pumpkin Ale."
"Delicious and will always be on my shelf around this time of year."
"D: A superb fall seasonal, though it is rich and spicy enough to be enjoyed in the depths of winter, too."
"Drink- It's a very rainy day in So. Cal and I could easily put back 3 or 4 of these great beers."
"A slightly malty aftertaste gave this beer an amazing overall taste. Overall, this was a perfectly balance summer ale."
"This is definitely my favorite pumpkin beer. Dogfish really follow through with the spicing. Brooklyn and Shipyard have a bit more of a flat taste compared to this."
"D-One of the easier drinking pumpkin beers I've had so far, but the combination of light body and the strong spice tastes are not a very good match."
"D - A great pumpkin beer."
"M-"
"D - This stuff was really tasty and one of the better examples of a pumpkin ale. I enjoyed that it was a little less on the spicey side and focused on the pumpkin for a change. Highly recommended to any pumpkin ale fan."
"D: Tasty, but a tad too sweet to want a whole 4-pack or order a second. An enjoyable pint though."
"This is a very drinkable beer. Its flavor is a bit more subdued than a lot of pumpkin ales out there, but still decent. Goes well with a pumpkin dessert."
"It's decent if you are looking for the taste of autumn and I would have more."
"Drinkability: One of the best pumpkin ales I've tried. The ale masterfully balances the intense spicy flavors of cinnamon and nutmeg, with very nice, sweet, pumpkin pie. Also, the alcohol content is almost dangerously well-hidden."
"D. Always a good choice this time of year however no more than a couple at a time."
"D- Beyond easy. I was a fool to worry about buying a four pack of this beer. It is delicious with no faults I can give it. One of the better pumpkin beers offered each season."
"Enjoyable all around, yet not a memorable example of a pumpkin ale for me. As a brown I'd drink it year round for the extra perks, but for a straight-forward pumpkin ale I'd go elsewhere."
"Pair up with a stuffed pork chop."
"D- Though I didn't really want to drink a """pumpkin soda," I was hoping for a slightly stronger pumpkin taste. Admittedly, now that I think of it, that's probably not a realistic expectation for a beer. That said, this is an excellent ale that I would gladly pick up again. It's strong but not obnoxious, and goes very well with a hearty fall meal."
"D: An all around great brew and a true benchmark for the style."
"Drinkability - very interesting brew here. A little more bitter than I'd normally like, but still very complex. Would make a great food-pairing type of beer example."
"Not my favorite for the style, but definitely not bad. About as much nutmeg as I can take without it hurting my liking. That said, I like it, but maybe two is my limit."
"Poured into a pint glass. Showed a brownish amber/orange with decent head, little retention and lacing. Smell of pumpkins, cinnamon, bready malt and spice. Taste of bready malts up front, sweet pumpkin balanced by the blend of spices mentioned on bottle (nutmeg and allspice) to leave a complex finish. Great seasonal beer, hides the alcohol well."
"D - I like this beer but I don't know if I could have more than 3 in a session."
"I have to say that I'm very disappointed with this brew from DFH overall. There isn't anything that makes it stand out from other commercial offerings and with the flood of pumpkin ales for the holiday season this beer is little more than lackluster for my taste buds."
"Now this is a nice pumpkin ale! Nice carbonation. Appearance is that of brewed tea. This is only my 2nd pumpkin ale, so not sure if that is normal or not. Smell is very nice: pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice and brown sugar are all there. Ditto for taste. A very nice, full flavored pumpkin ale, without being too sweet or spicy. Mouthfeel seems perfect, and drinkability is great, despite a 7% ABV. A very nice blend. I would definitely pick up a 4-pack of these!"
"Overall this is the best yet representation of the pumpkin ale. The Dogfish Head crew delivers. Very high drinkability, glad I bought 2 packs. Theres the definite ale taste to it. Not overpowering as some as far as pumpkin pie type spices. Drinks like a true fresh pumpkin beer."
"Best pumpkin beer ever. Full and rich, tastes like ale and fall, drinkable but one will do. Doesn't taste like a candle, or like a scented budwater. One more perfect beer from DFH."
"D: Very high. The excellent mixture between spice and pumpkin helps this one go down easy and makes me almost reach for another bottle immediately. Although I do wish the alcohol hid a bit more behind the richer flavors, for 7% ABV, I could sip this one all day."
"D - Easy to drink but I think it could be better with some stronger flavors (more pumpkin!). Smell is the best part."
"D: very easy drinker.. Surprisingly good."
"Drinkability - This is a good seasonal brew but not one of my favorites from DFH. I would have expected more outrageous over the top spices, bigger malt, and more sweetness from the folks at DFH. But never the less easy to drink despite the alcohol and still a great flavored beer."
"This is one of the better representations of a Pumpkin flavored beer. It's maltiness holds up to the spices and the spices don't overwhelm the Pumpkin's roasty characteristics. The head was adequate and the carbonation was right on. Clear and beautifully orange/brown the color was spot on. Nothing to complain about. That having been said it wasn't something I would beg to bring around year-round or anything."
"Fairly drinkable."
"Deep orange in color with a slight haze. Pours with a thin white head that reduces quickly to a white, wispy cap. Sweet pumpkin, cinnamon and spicy aromas. Medium bodied with lovely carbonation. Spicy coriander flavors in the beginning that lead to sweet malt and pumpkin flavors and very clean finish. I'm not a huge pumpkin ale lover, but I am a DFH lover, so I was compelled to try this. I recall trying 4 or 5 different pumpkin ales last fall and each of them left me feeling like I was drinking a glass of potpourri. The DFH Punkin Ale was nothing like the others. The spice does not overwhelm the big malty character and the aftertaste is more of a sweet flavor than spice. Excellent pumpkin ale."
"D: I would probably drink this beer again, I'm glad I got to try it at least once."
" The mouthfeel is decent, and it certainly makes other pumpkin ales seem like childs play. There is a medium feel with creamy carb and just a really nice refreshing vibe going on. I like this beer and I'll revisit it again this season and next. It makes beers like Southern Tier's Pumking seem gimmicky by actually remembering to be a beer. Although it's not without it's flaws, the biggest of which is the notable alcohol, Punkin is a worthy Autumn seasonal just about any beer lover would enjoy."
"There's not much more to say. I loved this beer and thought it was absolutely perfect with Sunday brunch in the fall. Well done."
"Drinkability - I still buy this one, but only because I can't get my favorite in Chicago (Schlafly!). It's kind of boozy (tasting, not just in ABV), so I usually only have one per sitting before moving on to something else. There are two schools on pumpkin ales, and I land firmly in the more spice, the better, and I think this is in the more subtle arena. I alos think the balance is off, especially for the Dogfish guys."
"Overall- 2nd only to pumking as far as pumpkin ales go for me, but they are almost two different beasts all together."
"D- Overall a very good beer in my opinion. It went down pretty easy even with all of the spices. """Would I have another?""" why yes I think I will now. I will be sure to buy some more to make sure I have some for Thanksgiving dinner!"
"The beer has a nice golden pumpkin color to it with a 2""" white head, which disapates quickly to a thin white lace around the glass. The smell is like a unbaked pumpkin pie(cinnamon, nutmeg, and a hint of brown sugar. the taste nice of malts and pumpkin with a hint of spices. It has a very nice mouth feel and is very drinkable. I would not drink like 3 or four of these at a time, but after dinner or just to relax on the back porch in fall would good for me."
"D- the drinkability of this, for me, isn't too much. Definitely not a session beer, but goes well after work, relaxing on the weekend, etc."
"Drinkability: This one is a sipper for sure. I poured the bottle about an hour and a half ago and am only halfway with my mug. It's a good cap to a night though."
"D: more pumpkin would be nice. One of the better pumpkin brews and full of bold spiciness. Interesting beer"
"Pours a light amber into a DFH snifter, with a slight head. The smell is where this beer becomes impressive. Brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and a sweet aroma that may be pumpkin. The taste, however, is even better than the smell. Nutmeg, Cinnamon, pumpkin, and a delicious lingering brown sugar taste. It has a medium body, very drinkable. The only thing that prevents me from drinking several at a time is the price and the ABV."
"Drinkability: A decent beer. Overly spicy, like most other pumpkin beers. Goes down easy. Very appropriate."
"My favorite pumpkin ale that I wish I had all year round. When fall comes around I always pick up this beer. This is another example of quality dogfish head ales."
"D- This is by far the best pumpkin style beer I have ever had. I can't wait to try it out of the bottle."
"D: I have yet to find a pumpkin ale that I thoroughly enjoy. There are a few on my list for which I have high expectations. Here's hoping..."
"Pluses: punkin' obvious in the finish. A very good burping beer."
"Poured into a pint glass. The beer is amber with about a finger of smooth with head that leaves behind thin lacing. This one smells really nice. I can smell pumpkin for one, along with all the spices used in the making. I think the nutmeg comes out especially nice and complimented nicely with a touch of spicy cinnamon. This really smells like what I think a pumpkin beer should be; pumpkin followed by Autumn spices. As good as an aroma as a pumpkin beer gets in my opinion. The taste reminds me of pumpkin loaf. You know, the stuff they sell at Starbucks. Take that and add a nice malt backbone and you've got a solid form of this. Rich malts followed by nutmeg flavor finishes nicely with the perfect amount of pumpkin. Possibly my favorite pumpkin beer right here. The mouthfeel is good, the carbonation being nice a subtle to compliment the medium body. This leaves a bit of spiciness on my tongue after a few sips but it still drinks very well. One that I'll certainly buy every season it's available."
"Over all the best of the pumpkin beers I have had, right next to Four Peaks Pumpkin Porter (yes I'm a local and must remain loyal)."
"D. This is a decent pumpkin beer, but IMO nowhere near some of the imperial pumpkin beers like pumpking and Weyerbacher. It always amazes me that so many people like this so much."
"behind the pumking, this is my favorite autumn beer!"
"Serving type: bottle"
"A great full flavored beer."
"M/D: Thicker side of medium bodied perfectly supports the robustness of this seasonal. A little taste of booze here and there on the back end is somewhat surprising given the abv. Drinkability is good overall."
"D - This is a damn good beer."
"Beautiful color, as all pumpkin ales are. I wasn't very impressed with the head, seemed a little weak for me. But that's a minor point for an overall great tasting beer."
"Drinkability: A pretty solid beer. There is the right amount of malt/pumpkin character to add great taste and body, but not too much to make this beer """sweet""" or overwhelming."
"All in all, it's pretty balanced. Spices are good and It has more actual pumpkin flavor than most. The alcohol comes through more than I would have liked. One of the better pumpkin beers out there."
"Coppery brown, somewhat cloudy or at least not entirely clear, nice off white head that laces nicely. Definite nutmeg, cinnamon and allspice in the nose a bit of alcohol too. The taste matches the smell. The nutmeg is quite clear in the taste of this beer followed by a strong caramel malt base. Little to no hop bitterness but at the same time it isn't overly sweet like many other examples of the style. The mouthfeel too is good nice full body with moderate carbonation lead to a pleasant beer. This is my favorite pumpkin ale by far. I feel it does a good job of capturing pumpkin pie taste without being one dimensional and too sweet. Something I look forward to every year."
"A top 3 pumpkin ale in my opinion"
"D: A good pumpkin beer. I prefer the dry, subdued spice style of Punkin to the overly sweet, overly spiced, trying to be a pumpkin pie beers."
"Cheers!"
"Ultimately this is an easy drinker, and it is very well balanced - most pumpkin ales are such unbalanced cinnamon bombs that more than one glass can be a chore. I could easily session this all night, but at the going rate: $11/4-pack, I'd rather drink several other more flavorful pumpkin beers (or something better from DFH - Burton Baton has started showing up)."
"Overall - This is one of the better examples of the style I've tried. A nice, balanced fall ale that's bursting with pumpkin flavor. Perhaps an excellent Halloween beer? give this one a try if you like your pumpkin!"
"Well this smells great. Initially the aroma is kinda muttled but as it sits the aromas blend so well and smell like warm pie. Brown sugar and allspice are predominant. Color is a deep amber brown and glowing. Not great carbonation. Really nice melding of flavors. Some pumpkin beers are too spicy, this one's spices match with the malt body and carbonation to create a great package. Nice squach flavor backed up by allspice, brown sugar, cinnamon, and great malt charecter. Mouthfeel is also bomber, smooth caramelly. Overall high points are aroma and mouthfeel, followed by flavor, apperance is lacking. Drinks well for a pumpkin beer."
"I measure pumpkin beers against a Pumking standard, and that's a tall order. This stands up pretty well to what I want in a pumpkin beer, though. It doesn't have the extra spicy and savory punch of Pumking, taking a more laid-back approach. It looks okay, nothing to write home about. It smells more like beer than pumpkin, with malt, nutmeg and clove being dominant. Tastewise, there's a lot of nutmeg and some cardamom thrown in for good measure. It goes down pretty well, if a little watery, and leaves a tangy taste behind. I'd have paid for the four-pack, even if it's a little pricey, and I'll probably have this again before the season's out."
"Drinkability: I would drink this again. It is not overwhelmingly bitter while not being too sweet. It does leave a burning feeling at the back of my throat which I really dislike."
"This isn't something I'd want to make a night out of but tasting this next to other beers makes for a pleasing experience. Not too many pumpkin ales I've had have been terribly enjoyable so this one is head and shoulders above many."
"Drinkability: It goes down quite easily, but I believe I may get bored with the beer after a few. Definitely a decent offering."
"Drinking the beer alongside a pumpkin spice cake is a great combination. The cake really brought out the brown sugar notes that are in the beer."
"Pours a light amber into my pint glass. This brew really brings the fall season into full swing, glad to have the opportunity to review it this year. Aromas of your standard run of the mill pumpkin pie spicing, along with a kick of hops to throw you for a loop. Taste is amazing, a balance of scent and taste in this one, with a slight bitterness and spice to start that reminds me of a rye brew, followed by a flavorful jolt of fall spices and a light, light hint of sweetness to finish it off. Alcohol is barely noticeable, good balance of malt while somehow managing to still account for a hop presence in a pumpkin beer. Mouthfeel is great, not too light, not too heavy, almost perfect with a medium body and mild carbonation. Drinkability is extremely high...definitely a pumpkin ale I will be having again this fall-"
"D- This beer is the best Pumpkin beer I've had. Tastes just like Pumpkin pie, but better cause it's beer!"
"Drinkability> Found my beer to take to the pumpkin carving party!"
"This is definitely a good brew for when the leaves start to turn. At almost $10 for a four-pack, it damn well better be! Those boys in Delaware know what they're doing. Viva la Dogfish!"
"Great fall taste, and proves to be a successful seasonal beer. Has a smooth feel to it, and the pumpkin taste is subtle, so it still tastes like a beer (not a fruity mess), and it comes towards the end and even creates somewhat of an after taste of pumpkin. I loved it!!!"
"Great brew to get the fall rolling!"
"Top shelf Punkin Ale!"
"D- very drinkable beer, especially for a pumpkin beer. If you think you hate fruity beers, don't worry about this one, it's not an intense pumpkin flavor, more like a strong spicy brown ale with flavors that we associate with pumpkins and fall."
"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle. Sampled on September 25, 2010. It has a decent looking orange-amber pour with a fairly long-lasting but thin off-white head. The aroma has plenty of pumpkin spice notes but there is a soapiness attached to that. The body is medium to full. The taste has a good dose of cinamnamon and nutmeg mixed in with the pumpkin and it is fairly well balanced. It is not a bad beer and is great for the season but there are others I prefer."
"Drinkability--high marks for this one. I would drink this all night. The flavor is mellow and has just a hint of bite form the spices. Like I said, I don't think I generally like pumpkin beer (or spiced beer), but I am sufficiently enamored by this that I would keep having it all night (if the spices didn't stop me first)."
"D- It's not the strongest example of a pumpkin ale out there, it's worth a try if you haven't had it, but I won't go out of my way to find this next fall."
"Unfortunately drinkability is only pretty good. It is a very fulfilling beer, but after one you are done and probably want to move on to a different style, or if you are a die-hard, just more more."
"D- I'd get horribly sick of this if it was around the full year, but for a couple months...yeah, I'll drink it. Nice for the season"
"This is a good beer, but I have to give it average drinkability because it's just such a one-off kinda thing. I'll finish this 6 pack and i'll enjoy it but it'll take me a while. I know i'm going to have to be in the mood to have this. Strong notes of nutmeg, allspice, pumpkin and brown sugar for sure. It's like making beer from pumpkin pie. I expected something a little on the sweeter side though."
"D I like this beer quite a bit and can have a few at night when the weather is cooler. The 7% doesn't scare me away from having a 4 pack in one sitting but I won't do that often."
"D - Much like Pumking, I just can't get enough of this. Lot's of character and flavor."
"I'd go for this again, perhaps a little later in the season when I've had a chance to delve into some dishes that feature these flavors. Overall, pretty good stuff."
"12 ounce bottle poured into a tulip glass. Dark amber/medium brown color with a light creamy head. Smell has a real Thanksgiving pumpkin pie feel with a mix of cloves, nutmeg, and cinnamon. Really inviting smell. Taste has a great mix of spices with more strong nutmeg and clove flavors and of course pumpkin. Extremely drinkable and delicious. To me, this is the quintessential pumpkin beer."
"From other reviews of this style, Pumpkin Ale is an acquired taste. If you like this style of beer, then this is a pretty good example."
"Surprisingly, this was not 1 of my favorites, still good, but a few others IMO, are better (Weyerbacher,Southern Tier....) Poured a nice amber/orangish color with a small amount of slightly off-white frothy head that remained throughout the beer. The smell is wonderful, pumpkin is what stands out most, but you can also pick up some of the cinnamon and nutmeg. A little on the light side for a pumkin ale. The flavor doesn't have a lot of spice I can taste some nutmeg and a little cinnamon but it is mostly pumpkin. A beer I wouldn't mind having again, but a little expensive for the overall experience - $10.99 for a 4 pack."
"I would rank this beer a tad higher, if the price-point weren't so high. At $14 a 4-pack, I expect a lot from a beer, a lot. While this is a delicious beer, for the money there are much better seasonals."
"I have also had it before on draft with brown sugar placed around the rim of the glass. This may seem a little frutie-tootie for a beer, but I have to say the sugar compliments it well."
"DFH Punkin Ale poured a crystal clear amber with ample white foam that quickly dissipates. The aroma is dominated by pumpkin pie spice, nutmeg and allspice especially with an vegetative green smell from pumpkin. The beer is sweet up from with scant bitterness but a nice spice kick that lasts through the finish. The malt provide ample body and complements with a graham cracker flavor. The pumpkin also provides some body with a carbonation that is spot-on. For those that like pumpkin beers, this is good drinking."
"D - Very drinkable beer. This was my first ever Pumpkin Ale and I was thoroughly impressed. I would definitely buy this again. Perfect for the season, I could see myself having two or three of these on a nice fall day."
"D: nice autumn beer with just the right amount of pumpkin and spice flavoring"
"This was ok out of the bottle, but not much spice or anything going on. This beer was much better when I had it on tap recently; it was more spicy and had a fuller body then."
"I really like this beer. It looks good when initially poured although it lacks some retention. It tastes great. Not too sweet, but balanced and spicy without being in your face. It has nice mouth feel, soft and average to low carbonation. It fails mostly in the aroma which is really weird, because pumpkin beers almost always excel in the aroma. Strange. It is also strange how the beer can taste so good with very little aroma. Anyway, it is a fine beer, and definitely one of the better pumpkin beers this season."
"D= very drinkable, although for a pumpkin beer I I prefer a thicker and more sweet-pumpkin dominated style. Still great for what it is."
"Medium carbonation and the alcohol is also very well hidden, definitely a great finisher to Thanksgiving or a nice dessert beer."
"D- A nice full bodied ale that should be enjoyed, not chugged. Very enjoyable to drink."
"D- An interesting approach at the style and quite tasty. It went down pretty quickly. Another interesting and creative effort from DFH."
"Way maltier and far less """spicy""" than some of the pumpkin beers I've had. This brew seems to be working away from the sweet spices and more towards a more realistic pumpkin pie (at least as far I as remember) by not being overly sweet and somewhat savory (from the gourd flavor). The toasty brown ale malts show up and fresh bread and there is a slight hop edge, that's just slightly bitter, to add complexity to the flavor. There is a vegetable flavor, like pumpkin seeds and meat with the blend of spices balancing it out. Overall this is a well balanced and tasty brew, but I would have liked more push from all the pumpkin flavors. (I'm saying the pumpkin aspect is currently at a five, I think six or seven would be just fine) Body and mouth feel work fine."
"Drinkability: One of the better pumpkin beers out there, very flavorful and very enjoyable. Definitely something that goes well with fall."
"Drinkability: If you like the taste, this would be a drinkable beer. However, as it's not quite my type of beer, I will not be having this particular beer again."
"D: I was disappointed by this one. I could have sworn I loved this beer last year, but then again my palate has matured immensely. I'll lay down one or two bottles and see how they do with a little age."
"Pours a hazy burnt orange with a light head that hangs around for a while. Hard-hitting aroma of spicy pumpkin pie and nutmeg come through strong in the flavor, along with the raisins towards the finish. Slight, warming alcohol presence nicely offsets the pumpkin and malt sweetness. This is highly drinkable and my favorite pumpkin beer (and believe me I've tried them all--my wife loves them)."
"high alcohol and not a thrilling taste (at least for me) ranks it a little low. like i said before, i just must not like any pumpkin ale."
"A: Very good head retention - foam is dense and tightly packed, deep gold to mild orange in color, spotty lacing - 4.00, S: As expected the nose is loaded up with pumpkin as well as a strong infusion of nutmeg and some cinnamon, there is a thick sticky bun like sweetness - 4.00, T: The flavors pretty closely follow the nose with a definite pumpkin flavor as well as the cinnamon and nutmeg, alcohol is evident but does not disrupt the beer, there is a nice smoothing earthiness to the palate, I wouldn't expect to find hops in the beer but I am perceiving a bite - 4.00, M: Very creamy and thick mouth feel - 4.50, D: A very drinkable pumpkin ale, nicely spiced - doesn't try to overdo it, recommended - 4.25"
"Long story short, I ordered a log of it to put on tap at home."
"Overall i wish the aroma matched the flavor. It kinda put me off a little when i smelled nearly nothing and then tasted a plethora of flavors that all had their voice but melded together well. Would definitely buy it again."
"I am usually not so critical. I love Dogfish Head and don't mean to rip on them. Just being honest with this beer."
"This was very sweet, but not cloyingly though sufficiently sweet to be sickly if you drank more than a few ounces. Not what I would have expected from Dogfish Head."
"This was a flavorful beer, I was especially impressed with the genuine pumpkin taste. It was very easy to drink a few of these."
"Clear light brown brew turns bright orange when held to a light. From a moderate pour it gives a lovely thick and creamy light tan head, minimal lace. Smell is fairly hoppy but hard to characterize because it blends with a bunch of spicy fresh cinnamon and clove. Backbone is moderately thick malt that similarly blends with a sweet-starchy pumpkiny body, like pumpkin pie beer. Taste is also pumpkin pie, with a moderate hop adding oomph to the spice and a moderate bit of marzen-like malt adding body to the pumpkin. The feel is a bit harsh, too fizzy, and the pungent hop overpowers the creaminess. Finish is a bit of spice and warm vanilla."
"Seriously drink this beer if you like pumpkins, or if you just like beer it is too delicious to pass up."
"Overall: Very solid beer. This is a very good fall beer. It's definitely worth buying."
"I had this brew poured from a bottle into a pint glass. It poured a nice light amber color with a one finger head, leaving a little lace on the glass. At first smell, I could smell the apparent cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice, no notable pumpkin. Initially all the taste is of the added spices, leading eventually to a smooth finishing pumkin and spiced flavored ale. A little on the light side for a pumkin ale. A beer I wouldnt mind having again, but a little expensive for the overall experience - $10.99 for a 4 pack."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Overall a very good beer. Nothing over the top here, and also nothing to let you down. Great for getting you into the mood for fall. I really like the level of spice in this one, its enough to satisfy someone who is in love with the style, and low enough to still be enjoyed by someone who may not have had the style before or may not be a huge fan of the spicier pumpkin ales. Good beer and one I look forward to as a seasonal."
"I will admit I'm not a huge fan of the hop kick at the end, but all in all this really is just a wonderful beer that's perfexct for summer or fall. Chalk up another classic from Dogfish Head in my book."
"A pumpkin beer that still taste like beer. Subtle and well balanced flavors that aren't fighting for supremacy!"
"Punkin ale poured a dark, deep amber color with almost no head. Could smell a bit strong, but smells of pumkin pie. A nice strong flavor, very complex. Strong nutmeg, cinimon, and pumkin flavors. Nice smooth flavor, but full. Overall a grea unquie beer, best pumkin beer s far."
"D: gross. That's pretty much all I have to say. I'm huge fan of almost everything DFH does, but this is unacceptable. I'm not sure who they're trying to appeal to here (the Blue Moon Harvest Moon crowd maybe?) but I'm not buying it."
"For what it's worth, this is my favorite pumpkin ale, but I still only get it about once a year."
"Nothing stands out too much about this but it is a good balanced beer with some spice flavor and aroma."
"All in all, another excellent beer from Dogfish Head. Very drinkable, but the only downside is that it makes me want autumn to come when I'm still in for another month of hot, sticky, South Carolina summer days. Oh well, I'll grab another six pack of this and wish away."
"D = I look forward to this beer all year. It is a fall classic. It's somewhat price ($10 for a 4-pack) but totally worth it."
"d - not bad, but I don't have to come back to this one."
"D - Surely drinkable. Be a good beverage for Halloween through Christmas to get you in the spirit."
"D - Pretty solid pumpkin beer here, but for some reason I think it fell a little short of what I was hoping this would be given its popularity. I wish I had another to compare it to. That being said, I would definitely have it in my fridge in the fall if this was available in Missouri. Props to BogleHill for the trade and giving me a chance to try this...I have been trying to get my hands on this for a couple of years now."
"Pours an orange amber color, which is not as dark as I expected since the bottle describes this one as a brown ale. Still, it had a cream colored head that had a nice size and decent retention. Overall it looked about what I would expect a pumpkin beer to look like had it not said brown ale on the bottle. Smells of buttery pumpkins and squash with graham crackers, pie spices and molasses present, but not overpowering. The taste is clearly of pumpkin, with a proper dose of spice as a little bonus rather than the main taste. Sweet and biscuity malt centered beer with just enough hops to make the beer balanced. Feels nice and rich and appropriately carbonated. Tasty and reminds me of a good home-made pumpkin bread or pumpkin pie, not the overly sweet or spiced stuff found most places. This was a great beer, especially for a style that people can be so finicky about, I will seek this one out again."
"D - I could drink this beer all fall long and probably will."
"Pours a slightly cloudy, apple cider color. A tan head sticks to the glass, but is not that impressive. Smell is sweet, with cinnamon, nutmeg, and another potpourri scent. I get brown sugar at first taste, of course with gobs of pumpkin, which fades into a bitter and quite spicy finish. I'd like a more rounded pumpkin flavor. Feel is oddly sharp. Just a little too quick in its complexity, but it paired very well with a mushroom burger and pizza. I've had it on its own in the bottle too, and it makes a decent dessert beer. Overall, just not my sort of brew, but it's a good representative of the style."
"Overall- in the pumpkin ale category this is up there. i noticed on the first and second brew i could pick up the alcohol bigtime. once you get to the 3rd and 4th one more starts coming out but then you're left empty handed."
"I'd make this my go to pumpkin ale so much better from whats churned out for the obligatory fall brew"
"I poured this one into a DFH pint glass. It poured a light and watery auburn in color with a quickly dissipating cream colored head and had a lot of carbonation. The smell is heavier on the pumpkin than the spices, which is appreciated. It has slight candied sweetness to it. The flavor is stronger than the aromas and has a good, bold pumpkin flavor to it with spices trailing, maybe cinnamon and a slight amount of nutmeg. The mouthfeel is interesting. It poured so light and watery but it drinks a little thicker than you'd expect. It's very drinkable. I really appreciate that the flavor is pumpkin heavy as opposed to all spices. It really gives it a nice balance. The alcohol content is also better than most pumpkin ales. This one is definitely worth trying."
"2010. Pours a clear golden copper color with medium white head. Scent is nutmeg, pumpkin, cinnamon...as I'm typing this, I'm realizing it's exactly like it explains on the label. I hope the taste is just like this...And the verdict is.... Interesting. Very interesting. The taste is delicious! I get all the flavors mentioned in the scent, but with more spiciness and hop profile. I'm surprised by how hoppy it is. It's not very hoppy, but more than expected. The cinnamon, brown sugar, and spice just leave a great aftertaste on your tongue. Probably the best pumpkin beer ever made. The mouthfeel is almost perfect and the drinkability is very high. Great beer for the upcoming holiday season."
"Future outlook: I've typically more or less ignored pumpkin beers, but decided to give this one a shot. Very pleased and will be happy to have again."
"Drinkabilty - Well, im glad this bottle was given to me, so i didnt get stuck buying a 4 or 6 pack. One is fine for me, maybe two if i was eating pumkin pie. I wish the beer had more malts and pumkin and less spices. Ill stick with great lakes or smutteynose octoberfest."
"Pours a rich reddish copper color, appears filtered, but knowing all the additives this is not one you'd not want to filter. Has a nice thick tan head. Smells mildy soapy, but yet spicey, and a lot like pumpkin pie. Not detecting much alcohol in the nose for such a strong ale, can detect some maltiness in here as well, as a brown ale should. Now the taste of this beer is where it blows all the other pumpkin ales away, it is like an amped up pumpkin ale and everything else seems like a watery compromise, like a lager with spices and stale pumpkin powder. THIS beer however, is extraordinarily complex. I can taste the cinnamon spice on the tip of my tongue, and at times the spicyness almost feels kinda prickly on the tonque, in a good way, like it is fresh ground. The pumpkin melds together with the malts to give it breadyness that is comforting like, well, a warm slice of pumpkin pie. The malts do have a solid toffy flavor of a brown ale. Not much presence from the hops aside from a backend bitterness and slight whiffs in the cornucupia of aromas in my glass. . Mouthfeel is rich and full. I've been on the lookout for one of these for years, finally tried one (thanks to DiCarlo's Liquors of Mundelein, IL). This is the new standard for a pumpkin ale, everything else is wayy behind. Drinkability is my only concern, wish it was a bit less strong, but then again why mess with perfection?"
"D - Not sure if I'd want to drink more than one, but that kind of goes for all pumpkin beers. They're a great way to spice things up once in a while."
"Bless you Sam for another great year with great beers!"
"Cheers..."
"T/MF: Tastes remarkably like pumpkin pie but not overpoweringly so, not as thick a mouthfeel as pumpkin pie, I suppose that is because this is beer and not food, but I guess what I am trying to say is that this beer conveys the idea of pumpkin pie, minus perhaps the almost overpowering aroma of the pie, into a beer. The pumpkin, the sweetness, the spiciness is all there and melds perfectly together. It's really hard to imagine another beer being able to do the same thing to such a perfect degree. In terms of style the taste cannot be beat, at least as far as I can tell. Feel is not nearly as thick as I was expecting from a pumpkin beer that tastes and smells like pumpkin pie, but such a realization really does not detract all that much from the overall enjoyableness of this beer."
"D/M: Light to medium bodied with nice carbonation. Very easy to drink, and the 7% is hidden very well. A really nice pumpkin beer that isn't over the top like some others. It is more """beer-like""" than some others I have had in this style."
"Drinkability - I was very impressed by Dogfishhead's attempt at a pumpkin ale. I may sound repetitive but it's very very smooth. It's a lot sweeter than others that I have tried, they really aren't afraid to use their spices. Definitely a must."
"I think the beer is certainly pretty good in replicating the taste of pumpkin pie. The lack of overpowering sweetness is a good thing and keeps it from being artificial tasting. The ABV is a tad high here, and it harms drinkability."
"Very flavorful and a great fall brew."
"Overall a quality pumpkin ale. I am not particularly fond of this style, but this one impressed me and I would definitely drink this beer again."
"The mouthfeel for this beer is surprisingly thin for how strong it is but it is still a medium bodied ale. It is pretty drinkable and provides a nice beverage for the oncoming cold."
"D - Well I still don't like it. I wanted too but it still uses too much bitter English malt that makes it too overbearing to produce the spice I need to really enjoy a pumpkin beer. Still very solid but I will look elsewhere for a good pumpkin beer,"
"drinks well. its not a style i overly enjoy, but this one is drinkable and i tend to pick one or two up at the beginning of each autumn."
"DB- Between the alcohol and the spices, I would prefer to split even the 12oz. A good pumpkin flavor masked by way too much spice flavor and alcohol. I probably should have been ready for this. I guess unbalanced is most appropriate here."
"D: It's one of the better Pumpkin beers out there. Not overly spiced, just a good one to drink!"
"I probably wouldn't have reviewed this normally because I don't like pumpkin that much which is perfect for this beer because it doesn't have a big pumpkin taste. It's certainly a much better choice then most of the pumpkin beers on the market. It went quite well with a pumpkin chili I made!"
"D: Having had several over the last three years, I just can't drink more than one in one night. Too sweet for me."
"Made me think of thanksgiving day just wish I had a plate of turkey. If pumpkin could be in a bottle this is it. I know this an unorthodox review but let's be honest beer is about so much more than these staunch reviews you see. If there is a beer you enjoy just pour your heart out ( pun intended)."
"D- its solid enough not my favorite of the style but its up there."
"D - This is the best drinking pumpkin ale I have ever tried. Overall I have to give this lots of points for that fact."
"D-This was a nice brew but fell a little short for this style for me. I love pumpkin so I was left wanting somewhat."
"It's fun, but looses it's gimmick pretty quick. I got a little sick of the mouth full of nutmeg about 5 sips in."
"D - A very good Pumpkin Ale that I'd probably buy again. I expected a little more out of it but I wasn't let down really, in fact I liked it's balanced flavor profile. I could enjoy a couple pints over dinner for sure. I recommend that everybody give it a try at least once. Cheers!"
"d: Not very drinkable. It's a good pumpkin ale but maybe i do not prefer it so spicy. I am enjoying the buzz though."
"D: Another well made, drinkable beer from Dogfish Head"
"For a pumpkin ale, this is one of if not the most drinkable. Very well done all around."
"D- No hint of the high ABV and great as it warms as then the pumpkin really comes through!"
"Drinkable? Yes. Top fall choice. Drinkable, flavorful, with very little palate fatigue."
"D_Pretty well balanced pumpkin ale. Higher ABV than the usual but still pretty damn drinkable."
"If you like pumpkin brews, or have never tried one - you can't go wrong here. DFH once again bangs out another amazing brew."
"Pours dark copper colour looks like fall.. Very little head or lace left on glass... Hints of cinnamon and pumpkin. Pumpkin taste not over powering and goes down easy for a seven percent beer.. Finished finished while bottle in less than twenty minutes so can pound a few before creeps up on you.. Overall very good.. Waiting for pumking ..."
"D: A nice pumpkin ale that doesn't have too much pumpkin flavor. Pumpkin ales are some of my favorite beers to drink and this one doesn't disappoint, a very solid beer overall."
"D: Not my favorite of the pumpkin beers I've had, but still a solid effort."
"Nice frothy white head with great deep orange coloring. More nutmeg and allspice than pumpkin in the nose but still smells real nice. Kind of has a pilsner quality with spiciness backing it up. Nutmeg and cinnamon are the front runners and the pumpkin is somewhat present. All in all pretty tasty."
"Hearty, but very drinkable. Quite tasty."
"D- Surprisingly drinkable for a 7%, overall I am a little unimpressed. Maybe it was just this year's batch, but I remember a much greater pumpkin pie flavor with brown sugar. This was an early batch maybe the pumpkins were bad? I am trying to find an excuse; I will try this again in a month or two."
"D: This beer is very well balanced in that it is flavorful but not overpoweringly sweet. The mouthfeel and flavor make it easy to drink, and the alcohol presence is not too heavy. This is a very well done, and drinkable seasonal ale."
"Overall impression: Enough with the gimmicky pie spice beers. I hope to find a decent pumpkin offering this year (Weyerbacher and Smuttynose, here I come). In the meantime, I'll pass on this one unless I find it on tap with the brown sugar rim that is apparently all the rage."
"Overall: This is a surprisingly easy drinking pumpkin ale that doesn't try to go over the top on the pumpkin aspect. Though on that note I would say they could push the pumpkin in a little more. If you were handed this beer without knowing what it was you'd probably call it an Amber Ale with nutmeg added. Not necessarily a Pumpkin Ale. Definitely a nice drinking beer with an even blend of spices, sugar, and malt sweetness. I'd buy it again. But it could use a little more pumpkin."
"I hate to give any DFH a rating below an A but this one mildly disappointed me. It looks good and smells great, but the flavor is far too spiced and not enough pumpkin...its their, don't get me wrong, just needs more. The spiceyness made it a little difficult to drink more than one in a sitting."
"Moderate carbonation and a smooth mouthfeel. Cinnamon toast, brown sugar, and pumpkin up front. Intense and dry finish of maple and slightly bitter hops -- unexpected and very nice. Highly drinkable; by far the most enjoyable pumpkin ale I've tried. ABV is completely masked."
"Balanced, flavorful and seriously intoxicating. I've never had any previous years so I cannot compare, but this is setting the bar quite high for me."
"I don't particularly care for pumpkin ales, and can't imagine when I personally would reach for them outside of Thanksgiving, but I'm willing to believe that this is a good example of the style."
"d - A pretty good pumpkin beer. Not my favorite, but something I would definitely drink again. Heavy on the spices in the smell and taste."
"Excellent offering all the way through. Pumpkin spice aroma is definitely there and a bit of an alcohol finish. Hands down the best fall beer out there, in my opinion. Enough said."
"made better by the nutmeg, sugar and pumpkin spices. Again this is first a Brown ale, soft and malty, but then you get the nice sugar and nutmeg kiss. Not a super Pumpkin flavor, but it reminds you of all of the spices that make up a great pumpkin pie. Hats off to DFH."
"Another excellent offering from the boys in Milton, though its unfortunate I can only have this for two months a year."
"- Overall very decent.. a nice touch to a fall taste."
"This is a drinkable beer, but just doesn't impress me that much this year. I am not sure if it tastes different, or it is just that I have tried other pumpkin beers since I first gave this a whirl years back. Punkin remains a solid fall offering."
"i was underwhelmed by this beer last fall; not sure if my palate changed or this has, but IMO it has stepped up its game. not a favorite for best of its class but clearly it's in the discussion."
"D: Last year when this came out I drank about 6 mugs on draft at the bar I worked at. Now..I could go for none. Maybe I got a bad batch of bottles. I will revisit this and compare it to my bottles from last year."
"A quality brown ale that hints at molasses, spices (nutmeg!) and contains a suggestion of pumpkin (even pie [even cream!]). The pumpkin is mostly in the nose. I have to emphasize that these flavors are subtle- this beer wins points for not going too far in that direction. In a blind test, an amateur would not note the """punkin""" flavor, I am sure. Though it's 7% ABV (not bad), you can taste a slight amount of heat. Here's to the heat, though, I've been taking cold showers all week and fall is fast approaching. Wouldn't mind sucking down a few of these on an autumn night with some friends."
"D: The alcohol is no where to be seen in the nose or taste. Damn good pumpkin beer compared to others in the category and I won't hesitate to buy multiple 4packs each year."
"i didnt even get a good look at the alcohol percentage and it might be because i havent eaten very much today but i am feelin it after 2! weird"
"All in all, this is a decent brew. Not perfect. Ok to try once if you have access, but don't hunt it."
"Very good, impressive, may not be the best, as I have yet to try others in the stlye(and I will, as I love everything pumpkin and Fall), but will buy again."
"Overall a very good, eclectic, and lively pumpkin ale. This is akin to a pumpkin IPA rather than a pumpkin pale ale. Excellent."
"D: At 7% this isn't what most people would consider """session-able""" but the beer hides the alcohol so well you could probably go through a few of these without realizing how strong they really are."
"D - Probably wouldn't get this again. The viscosity is a little much for this kind of beer. There are a few better pumpkin ales out there."
"Dogfhish Head Punkin Ale is the Gold Standard for pumpkin beer. The past fall I engaged in a 18 beer pumpkin beer tournament. Dogfish Head prevailed as the best. The pumpkin flavor is there but not overwhelming or artifical and the alcohol taste, while noted, is not too strong, especially considering the 7%. The beer is incredibly drinkable, complex, and full of autumnal feel and flavor. Two thumbs way up!"
"Solid fall beer from Dogfish, pours light and foamy, has a light golden brown color, tastes of pumpkin and spices, has a malty quality to it as well, has a strong finish, that stays around for a bit after the fact. The bottle says its a brown ale, and it does taste like a light brown, or maybe more of a red ale with spice and pumpkin flavor. It is well done, not overpowering, but not subtle either, I think they got it exactly right with the amount of flavor and balance. Well put together, enjoyable."
"D - It's a good beer, I certainly enjoy drinking it, and could drink plenty of it, however it is not as exciting as I had hoped."
"D - This could be an addiction here. Im a huge Shipyard fan but this beer is right up there and actually gives me more of that fall/pumpkin feel than Shipyard."
"D: very drinkable, and for a bottle thats well over a year old the flavor holds up and may even be better. i will have to try a 2010 batch."
"Pours a very clear, orange red bodied color with a great off white head which leaves nice lacing. The color is glowing with orange and red hues. Huge huge pumpkin, nutmeg and spicy aroma. Really one of the better, more focused pumpkin beers. The flavor is completely balanced between all of the spices. Dry finish with a nutmeg finish. Graham cracker malts and a pungent yam, brown sugar and even marshmallow component. The complexity begs for a roasted pork dish and turkey legs. Mouthfeel is perfect. The weight of this beer is phenomenal. Really balanced carbonation with this brew. Drinkability lacks for me because it's such a specific flavor profile that really only falls into autumn months for me at least. Great brew, but not a year round kind of beer."
"Of all pumpkin beers, and I've tried a few, this is my favorite."
"D- I think this 4pk won't last me too long! Damn good beer, glad this could be my first ever pumpkin beer!"
"D - I like it, and fear that I will need more"
"D - Overall, a decent beer, (again) well-balanced, but nothing of real excitement to bring me back for more."
"D-very drinkable, the perfect amount of pumpkin and spice, and unlike lots of pumpkin beers is not watered down at all"
"A really nice fall seasonal that I'll be getting again for sure. I've tasted a few of these along the way and I'd say this one and Elysian's Pumpkin Ale have been the best I've tasted."
"Didn't quite have the nose I expected. Was kind of hoping for the whole room to smell like a fresh baked pie, but like I said. Never had one before. Looked fair white head capping a rich just slightly hazy brown body. Tasted of everything you would expect. Nutmeg, cinnamon abound. I liked the biscuity characteristics the most. Just enough there to make you imagine a brown graham cracker crust. This beer reminds me of a pumpkin spiced FatTire. Overall very happy with this one. My lovely girlfriend also enjoyed two, herself."
"M & D: A sipper. Could drink like water but why would you? Makes me anxious for summer's end."
"Good Beer. Cheers."
"D: Quite drinkable as I've come to expect from other Dogfish offerings. I'd definitely have another."
"D - Solid pumpkin ale. So much better than Harvest Ale, and unlike shipayard this actually had pumpkin. That all being said, I have had better pumpkin ales I just need to rediscover them."
"Drinkability? I can very easily sit down and make a 4 pack disappear."
"Serving type: bottle"
"D- This is what a seasonal beer should be. It matches the food of the season and is a relaxing drink. Only thing that could make it much better would be a more pronounced spice taste."
"Overall all, this beer tastes like America. It's got all the elements of the season, and brings back memories of my youth spent in the north. I love this brew, it really gets me excited for the season."
"D- this is hands down the best seasonal brew I can ever think of on the spot. The brew is delicious and spot on with the seasonal aspects of the fall. I can drink these nonstop. Another winner from DFH."
"D: The beer is definitely drinkable. It's a good beer but it feels like more could be done with it. If this were just labeled as a brown ale I would have never known it was pumpkin."

"very drinkable and a pretty good beer, but at a year old, the pumpkin flavor seems to have aged right out of this one. color me unimpressed. maybe i'll try again with a fresh batch this year."
"This beer is absolutely worth trying! There will be a 4-pack of these in my fridge ever season!"
"If I had a concern, in fact, it would be that someone who wants a pumpkin ale will want more flesh and someone who wants a beer that tastes like this would be averse to ordering a pumpkin ale. I may feature it and make a big point of selling it on the virtue of it being particularly balanced."
"Overall this is more like cinnamon toast than pumpkin (or even pumpkin pie); this is far from the go-to for the style for me, and this is a style I have had a lot of."
"D - Started out good, but got harder to drink as I went, got through the bottle with just a bit of difficulty at the end."
"Really an interesting and tasty beer that I will certainly be drinking more of in the future. YUM!"
"D - Started out good, but got harder to drink as I went, got through the bottle with just a bit of difficulty at the end."
"D: The beer is very drinkable. I would definitely try this again because the taste is rather interesting and complex for the style."
"D- I could drink this beer everyday and still want more. When it was first released in 2009 I bought up as much as I could and it did not last to 2010. I just happened to go into the beer store by my parents and found a case in there. Hopefully it last because it is easy to drink. Dogfish Head knows what they are doing with this beer."
"Hazy golden orange in color. Smells wonderfully of brown sugar, nutmeg & cinnamon. Not much in the hops department, but that's not really expected. Flavor is caramelly, spicy and warming. Almost makes me wish it were fall already instead of late spring. Almost. Has an interesting souring finish. don't know if that is a product of a bit of age or not. Regardless, this is a very nice pumpkin ale, probably my second favorite behind ST Pumking. Happy to finally have this soon in SC."
"And, aparently, it ages well?"
"Punkin is a solid pumpkin flavored beer, and when the season makes its way around again in a few months, I'll probably give it another try if I am in the mood for the style."
"D - Solid niche beer. I am glad I tried this beer and I would probably get it again in the fall but it wasn't something I would drink a lot of. Definitely one of the best pumpkin ales though..."
"Notes: I am very impressed with this skillfully crafted pumpkin beer and I think that you will be as well."
"D- Very drinkable, the best pumpkin ale I've had. Definitely recommend picking up a four-pack!"
"D - Highly drinkable. One of the best pumpkin beers. 4.5"
"D - Very few Pumpkins I would rate a session. While nice, it is not my favorite style and might skew my rating."
"Drinkability: Definitely more drinkable than the tiresomely alcoholic fresh version. If you ever buy a 4 pack, try one, see if it's too fresh, and store the rest for 6 months to a year before cracking them open again. Time definitely mellows out the alcohol and brings the subtle flavors to the stage."
"D - Gulping this one down too but in all fairness, since I've started drinking beer for the purpose of enjoying the flavor, I've noticed that I've been gulping nearly every beer I drink."
"The strong point of the beer for me was the mouthfeel. Everything else was 'meh'. Nothing special."
"As far as I'm concerned this is the best Pumpkin Ale I've tasted and possibly the best out there."
"Poured into a pint glass. It has a clear golden brown color. There was barely half a finger of head that dissipated after about two blinks. I had this when it was in season about 5 months ago so I am not sure if the head retention was different when I had it fresh. The aroma is still fantastic. It has a sweet overriding pumpkin smell with hints of cinnamon and caramel. The taste is very balanced. I is a little subdued compared to the aroma, but all the elements are still there. Strong pumpkin flavor up front that changes to smooth caramel malt notes on the finish. I could have a few of these in a single sitting. I look forward to getting some well in advance of Thanksgiving this year. I tried to pick some up last year the Tuesday before turkey day and they were sold out."
"D: Superb flavor with nothing too overpowering. VERY drinkable. I could go through a 4pack with no problems at all. Definitely, a """sit down and drink me endlessly""" beer."
"As far as spiced beers goes, I put this somewhere between Anchor OSA (very good) and Sweetwater Festive Ale (OK)."
"D: I love pumpkin beers and this is one of the best. Great flavor, and well crafted. I look forward to this one every year."
"Creamy and mouth coating with high carbonation. The aforementioned combination with the enjoyable interchange between the malt and hops character makes this brew highly drinkable."
"overall: this is my second pumpkin ale, and its january but it makes my long for the fall again."
"Nice experience with the first pumpkin ale I've ever had."
"A damn good pumpkin brew. One of the better ones I've had. A decent amount of pumpkin and not too much spices with a smooth medium body. Very drinkable, good fall brew that your mom/sis/grandma would even like."
"I am not a big fan of the style but this one isn't that bad"
"Picked up a single at Macy's in WR. Poured into a standard pint glass. Nice sunset orange color. Very bright, almost copper-like, sheen to the beer's body. Very hefty white head. Smells like a cinnamon roll. Taste was spot on for a pumpkin ale. Lots of Thanksgiving spices like sugar, cardamon, and cloves. Fairly thick body but light enough to make this quite drinkable. A bit high in abv for a normal pumpkin ale, hence the 4 pack route. A good fall beer from DFH."
"This is by far my favorite autumn ale. It works extremely well with just a little bit (or a lot) of age."
"2009 version of Dogfish Head's Pumkin Ale is quite better than the previous years batch. Full bodied, spiced brown ale, nose and taste of pumpkin, nutmeg, brown sugar, cinnamon, makes this brew flavourful and tasty. Mouthfeel is light, and taste is so quenchable. This year's batch just overcomes flavours from Dogfish past! They have the best batch by far! Thanks for getting better...can't wait for next year's batch!!"
"D - very easy, doesn't feel like a 7%, spice flavors are well integrated and not too strong, nails the style without becoming a caricature"
"Thoughts- This beer is more spice and less pumpkin, but the flavor is not overpowering like some I have had. This beer is a good stab at the style and something to drink around Halloween."
"Pours like nothing special, wouldn't know this was a pumpkin beer by looking at it. Aromas are delic, a hybrid of pumpkin pie and low alpha acid hops. Taste, one of the better (if not the best) pumpkin ales out there. No progression though, and you probably don't want to drink more than 1 of these per sitting, kind of a desert type beer, but not too sweet."
"It has a nice balance of sugar, pumpkin spice and malt. Nice cinnamon undertone. Perfect balance. Beautiful malt and spice balance. Just a hint of nutmeg. There a beautiful complexity to Dogfish's offering."
"Drinkability: I would definitely have this again and definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys a solid pumpkin ale which has a well balance of malts and pumpkin profiles."
"Drinkability - Could easily down one or two, but it's a rich beer and after that I might want something a little more spicy/hoppy."
"D: Very drinkable in limited numbers... one or two at the most, so this is no session beer. For the style, it is different than other Pumpkin brews I've had. There are two types of Pumpkin brews.... Those that taste like pumpkin pie and that that taste like this.... I think I'm leaning to the Pumpkin pie side but this was a very enjoyable trip to the other side."
"An almost perfect example of a fall beer."
"Overall Impressions: Good beer for those who don't like pumpkin beers (or think that they don't). Great balance of pumpkin aroma and maltiness in flavor. Nice beer for the season . . . at the top of pumpkin beers for me (pending further research). Maybe slightly high alcohol for style (4.3-6.2% for Brown Ale)."
"The smell reminded me of boiled and mashed pumpkin destined to become pie filling, much like my mother made back in the day, with light hints of spice. Taste was full with good body and spice predominant including nutmeg, cinammon, all spice and a bit on the sweet side as well. A nice smooth texture, a bit gassy. There is a light bitterness at mid-mouth with a finish that started out full and rich but got sharper with warming and a bit earthier. An interesting beer that, in my view, got less attractive as it warmed - it could have been the higher ABV that kicked in - but well worth a try."
"EDIT: After letting this warm up a bit (served at ~50 degrees) the sharpness dissipated improving its taste and drinkability a bit :)"
"D- This is very smooth for 7% ABV. don't usually enjoy pumpkin ale but this is a very nice seasonal. every time I pop one open and usually go for a second one. very nice."
"It's tough for me to say where Punkin' Ale places on my list of favourite pumpkin ales. I'm noticing it's a fine line between those that are too spice-dependent, too perfumy and those that are too inhibited, too understated. I find Punkin' (this year's vintage anyhow) belongs with the latter, which, although in someways is better than the alternative, still doesn't seem to satisfy my urge for a hearty, savory Thanksgiving-time tipple."
"Pours a golden orange in the glass with a creamy white froth and good lacing. Pronounced & perfumed aromas of roasted pumpkin, cinnamon, brown sugar, nutmeg, honey, baking spices, subtle vanilla, & caramel follow through on the palate. There is a little bit of hop bitterness to balance, but the malts, spice, & pumpkin are the real stars of this beer. Great carbonation/mouthfeel, balanced flavors, & a long finish help make this a great beer! Overall, one of the best pumpkin beers on the market! This beer is a perfect Thanksgiving beer!"
"O- Likable beer. Its a good representation of the style the only lets down is the overly spiced aroma. Tastes good."
"Bottle generously shared by MDS! This stuff looks rough. A hazy orange pour with no head, just a very thin halo of creamy being froth. But the aroma is good stuff. Pumplin and spicy bread dominates. Theres some brown sugar too, and some nutmeg, but it's mostly pumpkin, and it smells good. Taste is pumpkin pie too, pretty spicy, and very soft. Very creamy and drinkable. Just wish the taste kept up with the aroma. Thanks Mike for sharing a good beer from DFH!"
"Drinkability: 12oz at a time is enough for me, It's drinkable but not like something I want to go right back too when I finish my first one, the reasonably high alcohol would prevent me from trying to make a night out of these, but the snifter I had lasted me through my meal and the 2 ipas my friend drank with his dinner."
"I enjoyed this beer from start to finish. Poored very well and had a very nice color. The bottle was plain while the beer was the complete opposite. The beer foamed up nicely and settled perfectly. This beer tasted very sweet and had a nice undertaste. The pumpkin taste wasn't too overbearing. This beer is probably in my top ten for seasonal beers."
"D: Among the tops of pumpkin ales. Right up there with Pumpking."
"I will definitely drink this again."
"Pours an amber color with good visibility throughout. After an aggressive pour, no head is noted nor is lacing lining the glass. Smell is mostly thanksgiving day spices with lots of cinnamon and nutmeg. No alcohol is noted in the nose. Taste is pumpkin up front with the spices finishing out the quaff. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and drinkability is pretty high during the fall/thanksgiving time of year. Overall one of the better pumpkin beers for me."
"The mouthfeel is has a nice creaminess to it but finishes very dry for it's weight. The 7% abv sneaks up on you real quick, this drinks a lot lighter than it is."
"Mouthful seemed a little thin. It was a little spicier then I expected and I dont know if it had a definative """pumpkin""" taste to it. A decent brew but could have been sweeter and creamier."
"This is probably the best pumpkin beer I've ever had. It has a sweetness, but it's not too sweet, and the combination of the pumpkin and brown sugar are especially delicious. I could definitely drink several in a row. This would be good with pumpkin pie."
"Drinkability: Good, this beer is definitely worth a try again. Surprisingly the drinkability is pretty easy, you really can't taste the high alcohol content so the beer hides the alcohol very well."
"I would not normally order a pumpkin beer, but my local bartender pushed it a little, backed up by several patrons. It looks good enough with a decent creamy head and copper color. It smells like pumpkin pie, just what I would expect but not anything out of the ordinary. It tastes not too bad at first with a decent malt base and spicy flavor with pumpkin that is not overwhelming. As I drank it, it got a little more pumpkin flavored, especially in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is nicely carbonated and maybe a little chewy. I am not really into this kind of beer, but it is definitely more drinkable than others of this variety. If you like the fall pumpkin beer thing, this is certainly one of the better ones."
"Drinkability is quite good. A nice brew that goes down easy and is pretty tasty. I would say one of the better examples of the style I've had so far. It certainly would make a great session beer and I hope to have a few more before the season is out."
"D: Quite enjoyable for its style, but not the body that I was expecting nor come to expect. Still, tastes great, is simple and to the point, and very sessionable."
"D - This is a decent pumpkin ale...I like that this one lets the pumpkin flavors actually stand out more than the pumpkin pie flavors...as always a good beer to sample from Dogfish"
"D-It ok in D but, it's not something I would want one after another. But other spiced beers like Anchor's Christmas Ale I could session all night. It's just kinda plain after it's out of your mouth... But it's not bad."
"D- A good overall flavor and one of my favorite pumpkin beers. I wouldn't want more than two of these in a session, but it's one of, if not THE best, pumpkin based beers that we now get in southern California."
"This beer is calling for you to grab it for a picnic on a cool Sunday afternoon with a loved one- it wants to be enjoyed outside. Granted I wouldn't go out and buy a keg of it, but a few glasses had me lingering for the holidays to arrive. Perhaps it is my love of Fall that made this beer warm my senses or the fact that someone actually balanced a pumpkin beer for me to actually enjoy to drink."
"Buy Again? Every season."
"Drinkability:This was a very drinkable brew, nothing overwhelming in the least. There's just enough uniqueness in this brew to keep it interesting throughout, particulary the heavy sweet notes hiding in this thing. I'd definitely drink this again."
"D - was drawn to this beer bc of dogfish head brand not bc its a pumpkin ale, was very happy with this and is now become my go to choice for a pumpkin beer, in the rare occasions that i want one"
"pours an amber/orange color with a 1/2' head and fras lacing on the glass with a nice beige ring.. the smell is banana nutmeg cinnamon and pumpkin bread the taste is the same it has a oily pumpkin taste that i did not like followed by banana bread tastes and some spices overall ive had better pumpkin ales but this is still allright DFH is a solid craft brewer will try any of their brews ...this one is a one bottle try for me"
"Shows a deep, clear orange that seems appropriate for something made of pumpkin. A fair topping of bubbly white head quickly fizzles away to a thin layer, leaving no lace behind. Smells of pumpkin with allspice, cinnamon, and brown sugar over a biscuit & caramel base. It tastes like pumpkin pie filling with an alcoholic kick. All the spices in the nose are there on the palate as well, with a hint of nutmeg as it warms. Caramel base. Alcohol is slightly noticeable. Medium bodied and slightly fizzy. I think I'd like it a bit smoother. The spices make this fine beer a slow sipper, and I don't think I could have more than one."
"Pours copper with an off-white and long lasting head. Visible carbonation. Smells like a pumpkin beer. Not quite sweet enough to smell like the pie, but all the ingredients are present without being overwhelming. The flavor is fairly balanced, with pumpkin, cinnamon, and nutmeg coming through (can't speak to the allspice as I don't have much experience isolating it) without eclipsing the more conventional flavors of a good brown ale. There is a nice malty platform and the hops bring some tanginess and bitterness in the finish, keeping it drinkable. Full-bodied and perfect for the season, this pumpkin beer features natural flavors that make this one of the best pumpkin beers out there (used to be THE best, but there is a lot more competition these days)"
"Drinkability is really nice for a beer with 7% ABV. All kinds of spices and different tastes, but they all go so well together that you don't get hit hard by any one spice. A must try if you like pumpkin ales."
"-this was the most drinkable of the bunch, but i am beginning to realize that i am not much of a fan of the pumpkin beers"
"On tap at Kickbacks in Jax. Poured into a Unibroue tulip. Kegged in 8/2008. Aged for 15 months, in my opinion the perfect age for this ale. Head quickly disappears. Brown sugar, nutmeg, pumpkin and sweet malts seem to dominate as the hops have faded into balance. (If you want the hops, get it fresh.) Taste is also very sweet, much more so than fresh. ABV is totally hidden by the sweetness of the malts and spices. Great rounding off of the sharp edges with a bit of age. Love it fresh, and really love it at a year."
"D: First and probably last time having this."
"D: without a doubt one of my favorite pumpkin ales. definitely part of the regular fall rotation every year. a good balance of pumpkin, spice and sweetness that is well constructed from start to finish."
"Definitely one of the best pumpkin ales I've had and another great beer from Dogfish Head. I don't think the year of age really added anything but it didn't detract either. A very good example of a pumpkin ale and a good beer overall."
"D: Very nice.. One of the more mellow pumpkin beers I have had. Subtle and delicious without having too much spice."
"overall disappointed. Surprised because love the brewery and most beers they make are top notch."
"D: This is an in your face pumpkin ale. Unlike other pumpkin ales though it's not dominated by the pumpkin and spice, for that reason it's probably more drinkable than others for the style. The malts may get you though."
"D - It's drinkable. I could have a couple of these on Halloween night, passing out candy to trick-or-treaters."
"Overall, this is one of the lesser pumpkiny pumpkin beers I've had. This is not necessarily good or bad; it all depends on what you're looking for. The 7% makes this beer a nice midpoint between the many pumpkin beers in the 5% range and the bigger imperial pumpkins that rock the boat with 9%. The bottle doesn't lie when it states that this is a full-bodied brown ale, first and foremost. It just also happens to be a little pumpkin flavored."
"M:"
"D- I enjoyed one of these, and could perhaps enjoy one more... but I cannot see myself enjoying more than two. If it were a little less attenuated and if it featured softer carbonation, this beer could be amazing."
"Poured a nice amber color but the head was lacking. Nose is sweet and sticky with cinnamon, nutmeg and light pumpkin.Taste is not overpowering pumpkin like I wished but cinnamon and nutmeg were there. Mouthfeel is creamy, sordove bland in the taste and lingering. Not one of my favorites from DFH"
"12 oz bottle (from make your own 6 pack) to glass. Orangy bronze color, the head had a faint orange as well. Didn't really pick up on the pumpkin pie spice on the nose or on the taste, very subtle I thought. Quite sweet, and not much bitter. Some raisin perhaps. I actually got more pumpkin pie spice with New Belgiums Mothership Wit, but maybe that's just me."
"D - This is a nicely balanced """pumpkin""" beer. Not overwhelming at all. Easy to drink and the 7% is well hidden."
"Drinkability: I'm not a huge fan of this beer, but maybe it's because I'm just not a huge fan of pumpkin ales. This beer becomes smoother and tastier with each successive sip. I'd definitely buy this again if it were a little cheaper (I paid $11 for my 4pk); as it stands, I might."
"I get more of the pumpkin this time. A little sweet, but still pretty good."
"Medium carbonation and a medium body make this flow across the palate nicely. A very good pumpkin ale, but is any spiced beer really session material?"
"Had this on-tap at FTW Fall Beerfest. Dark orange-golden with cream-colored head. Pumpkin is prominent as is nutmeg and cinnamon. A little vanilla and a pumpkin pie filling flavor in the finish. Nicely done with the flavors and above average in all categories."
"Drinkability- good for the holidays."
"In a word: excellent!"
"I decided to try a handful of pumpkin beers today and most have been a major disappointment. Too light or too spicy or too sweet, but this is the best I have had so far. An awesome pumpkin beer, I would spend the 8 dollars for the 4 pack next time."
"Pours a medium amber with light tan head. Nose has the usual suspects of pumpkin and miscellaneous holiday spices. Reminds me of holiday cookies. On the palate the spices do a bit too much over the pumpkin for me, leaving the pumpkin and traditional brown ale characteristics in the backseat."
"Over all, a very good pumpkin ale, not my favorite, but up there!"
"D - I could drink these all day. Very drinkable and go down easy. Watch out though as the 7% alcohol will sneak up on you."
"uscaptainsblog.blogspot.com"
"D - Sam needs another go at this one. For a brewery that sells beer at a premium, this one needed some help. It lacked distinct pumpkin flavors, the spice aroma was faint, and the ale was lifeless."
"Decent drinkability. I wouldn't get smashed on a gaggle of these, but overall an enjoyable sipper."
"D- This is a very drinkable beer as long as you like pumpkin/fall beers. I would say anyone who doesn't have this is missing out on a very drinkable beer that they would miss for another year!"
"Drinkability: In my excitement to try this beer, I can't say I was disappointed but I wasn't exactly bowled over. Definitely a good pumpkin ale and I could see myself enjoying quite a few but eventually the spices would become too much. Overall quality beer."
"One of the greatest (maybe the greatest so far) pumpkin ales I´ve tried. This is a great seasonal offering and one I´m not shy to have often and recommend. The way it offers the pumpkin range with a gentle background of spices but without the often overpowering opposite way around is a win for my preferences so far. A great brown-pumpkin ale..."
"dr. I am such a tightwad that I'll finish it, but this is one offensive beer. It's the third bottle (three different days) of a four-pack, so I've given it a fair chance I think."
"cheers"
"Recommend music paring: Preston School of Industry - All This Sounds Gas"
"D: I've been wanting to try this one out as I figured if anyone could do a good pumpkin beer, it would be DFH. It's definitely a solid offering, and one of the better pumpkin beers I've had."
"Drinkability is better than other big pumpkin brews (Weyerbacher, Southern Tier), at the cost of some complexity."
"Medium amber-copper with a small, foamy, slighty off-white head that diminishes to a wispy film. Huge allspice and nutmeg on the nose. The brown sugar goes well with the malts. Taste-wise the spices aren't nearly as huge as the aroma suggested. Pumpkin and allspice were most notable but they didn't overpower like the spices in most pumpkin ales do. It has a medium body, dry texture with that pumpkin bitterness and moderate-low carbonation. I don't like spiced beers, especially pumpkin beers, and I won't have this again because of that. However, this is the best pumpkin ale I have have had yet."
"Drinkability: You simply can't have just one. Perfect for Fall or any season where good friends and family are around."
"Im glad I only bought one of these, not only are they expensive but I didnt really find the brew to be all that spiced or pumpkin. the beer was good, dont get me wrong. i just found it to be a lame example of the style for what I understand it to be. it was very balanced and had a good amber orange colour, but there was nothing that shouted out 'pumpkin pie' or even anything more than a simple amber with some spices added."
"Mouthfeel is sweet, with spice and finishes with those 2 dominant components lingering on my palate. Drinkability is good, but the sweetness will keep you from drinking this quicker than it should be. After all, this is a nice dessert beer, so relax while enjoying yet another great beer from Dogfish Head."
"D - Pretttyyy, Pretttyyy Pretty refreshing beer. Drinks smooth only leaving a pumpkin pie aftertaste."
"Overall I'd say this one is very drinkable for a pumpkin ale. The pumpkin flavors or spice notes don't really get tiresome, I could definitely see having more than one of these. Worth seeking out if you're a fan of the style."
"D: nice."
"Drinkability is very high for me. For 7% ABV this is very easy going and a definite have for the season."
"Another great beer from DFH."
"Pours an amber orange color with a two finger off white head which leaves a nice lace. Smells like pumpkin pie in a glass. Pumpkin, brown sugar, and cinnamon are present in the smell and the taste. The flavor is sweet and malty. Medium bodied and creamy, with light carbonation, and some hop bitterness at the end. This is a nicely drinkable beer. I could have this again and again."
"Drinkability- Amazing! I love it. I will drink it again and I'm going to go buy some more of it."
"D: There isn't really any alcohol flavor that i can tell, but the beer just underwhelms me and doesn't give me what I was looking for. I was hoping for sweet spicy pumpkin pie in a bottle here and this is much more like a lager with some pumpkin pie elements sprinkled in."
"I expected this beer to be more over the top, but as it is it's a well-crafted example of the style."
"I normally love Punkin Ale anyway, but they had it cask-conditioned at their brewpub a few weeks ago. Oh Heaven, you have found me! Same great punkin ale with flavors of brown sugar, spice, and autumn. But with superb creamy smoothness and a hint of maple syrup from the cask conditioning. Just line them up!"
"Amazingly drinkable. I could drink this on tap all night long."
"Drinkability - Unbelievably so. For 7% abv and being a pumpkin beer, I have to physically restrain myself (what a great picture that must paint) from running to my beer cabinet and opening another. Foolishly I only purchased a single four pack whilst in Huntington Beach for my good friends bachelor party...not realizing that if I did not have more self control the four pack would be gone as of tonight. Instead, I somehow have to make these last me until Thanksgiving. Perhaps I will give two to my fiancée and make her hide them where I won't find them. Anyway, all in all this was a great surprise and made me realize how cruddy the other pumpkin beers, that I had thought up until now, were somewhat good. I will seek this out next year for sure!"
"There is an odd bitterness to this beer, on the backend. Spice and maltiness up front. Thin, finishes completely. Not really feeling this beer. The bitterness builds, it is not hop bitterness. Not a repeat."
"drinkability - while this beer is good its definitely a dessert sipper for me"
"One finger head, dissapaited quickly. Very nice dark golden brown color. It smells faintly like pumpkin with some nutmeg and cinnomin in there. Taste is very rich, filled with nutmeg and cinnomin initially and a nice pumpkin finish. Very nice beer, one of my favorite fall brews and one of the most nicely crafted beers ive had."
"It's hard to give Dogfish a bad review, but I gots to be honest."
"D- This was my first pumpkin ale and I must say that I am pleasantly surprised. I'm not a huge fan of pumpkin pie but maybe if I started pairing it with beer I would enjoy it more :)"
"Another solid one from DFH. Perfect for a chilly fall night!"
"D:A good session beer. I plan on a few after this one."
"Drinkability - despite not really smelling anything the beer is interesting enough that even though I just bought a single, I may go back to the store and pick up a full 4-pack to share with the Mrs. She enjoyed it as well and it went well with dinner (ham slices and corn fritters)."
"Overall my favorite pumpkin ale so far. Enthusiasts usually reject this seasonal...but not me..."
"nice carbonation. medium to light body. slightly dry mouthfeel in the finish. pretty average punpkin ale you got here, nothing really stands out about this one. a nice sessionable beer in the fall season, but much better pumpkin ales out there that are significantly cheaper than this one."
"Overall very solid. I am surprised I had not run into this earlier and while it was very good, I almost wish it was just a little bit more upfront. Very solid and super drinkable, just needs a little extra kick for me to put it in the awesome range."
"This is a very pleasant seasonal ale."
"D: Great tasting pumpkin ale. Considering its light body, there are lots of amazing flavors happening in this beer. It's very refreshing and is a nice choice for a fall evening. A sweeter alternative to the many Oktoherfest style lagers out their during this season."
"Pours liquid pumpkin. Its a unique amber color. It smells like cookies and beer mixed together in a glass. Ok now I'm eating a piece of pumpkinpie courtesy of my roommate...words cannot explain. Drink Punkin with pumpkin pie! Its like dessert, perfect for a cool fall night. Very drinkable IMO."
"Drinkability - 4.0/5.0 - definitely would have again! Really great beer, price is higher than I'd like, but a small complaint."
"I'm rarely outright enthusiastic about a pumpkin - or any other flavored - beer, but this one is exciting. Pours a hazy amber with fine carbonation; not much of a head. Smells of all the pumpkin and spice goodness of many pumpkin ales but surpasses its competitors by using a healthy heap of biscuity and toasty malts. Unlike other pumpkin ales I've tried, the cinnamon and vanilla are not overwhelming - the sweetness is actually balanced by hops. A highly enjoyable beer."
"Left in the fridge after """Becktoberfest""" by my daughter-in-law. (Thanks """E.""" I Owe you one.) Tried it before, but this was like trying it all over again. Gorgeous deep gold to amber in the glass with subtle carbonation and a nice head that fell rather quickly, but left a ring of foam that laced the glass nicely all the way down. Pumpkin spices--cinnamon, nutmeg (I guess)--immediately evident in the nose, but quickly found them to be very well balanced in the flavor. Rich mouthfeel and recognizably buttery malt balanced with a nice hops bitterness, a subtle fruity spice (the pumpkin spices) all blended nicely on the tongue. Unbelievable balance and complexity. Easily (now) my new favorite pumpkin ale. The 7% ABV was a bit of a put off when I saw it on the label, as I assumed that astringency would be noticed as the beer warmed. That wasn't the case. This was incredibly drinkable from start to finish. Fantastic."
"Purchased at Three Cellars in Franklin, WI. Pours a bright, orange-amber body with an off white head that eventually falls completely. Aroma is sticky sweet sugar, like cinnamon buns. Pumpkin is also detectable in the aroma. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with big malt sweetness upfront in the flavor. There's brown sugar and pie spice flavors in there too. There's a little bit of hop bitterness in the finish and a slight alcohol warmth as it goes down. Very good beer for a cool October evening."
"Haxy orangey copper in color, i like the tea reference made by another reviewer below, so im gonna steal it, minimal head and ok lacing. Smell is of faint pumpkin pie spices (nutmeg and cinamon) with some vanilla and malty biscuit scents. The taste is a rather mild blend of biscuity malts, pumpkin pie spices and vanilla. Slight pumpkin flavor on the tail. Lighter bodied, slightly high in carbonation, still manages to be slightly creamy. Mild flavor, but unique in its combination."
"There is a nice caramel/toasty note. The spices are great and this makes for a drinkable pumpkin ale. Very tasty indeed."
"Overall, one of the better, if not best pumpkin ales I can remember drinking. Often the style gravitates towards one of two extremes: pumpkin-pie beer, or underwhelming squash-ale. DFH manages to find a great balance, and subsequently creates a great beer. Functions well as a dessert beer, or as an autumn warmer. Would and will purchase again."
"I poured my Punkin Ale into my beer tasting wine glass. It pours a pumpkin color, it looks like autumn. I expected it to look more like a brown ale referred to on the label. The white head did not stick around too long. The aroma reminded me of an amber with evidence of the pumpkin pie spices. The taste is caramel malts and more pumpkin pie spice (nutmeg, cinnamon, allspice) The mouthfeel is rather light for a beer of this sweetness. I probably wouldn't want to drink too many of these on account of the sweetness, not really a session beer. I have to admit, I did not dislike this beer, but was a little underwhelmed considering it's price point. I have had better pumpkin beers at the same price for a 6 pack versus this four pack."
"M - Great body, good mouthfeel. Again this is my goto Pumpkin beer. I haven't had many as good as this one."
"I'm not a big fan of the pumpkin ale style, and I don't think I'll have another of this one."
"D: This is a well crafted pumpkin ale. Very nice on a fall day. You gotta love October."
"the mouthfeel was suprisingly thick. medium carbonation and a bit sticky"
"Drinkability: It is definitely not too overpowering. Id say the limiting factor would be the price for me but otherwise i really enjoyed this beer."
"As for drinkability, I'll leave it at that. Maybe I just had a bad bottle, but I wont risk wasting another beer that somebody else may like to try it again."
"Pours frothy into a nice lacy head... color is similar to bourbon, but with LOTS of carbonation... aroma is as expected- pumpkin pie. Flavor is a bit thin for me, with a little too much pumpkin, and not enough malt to balance it out... it is much better than the macro pumpkin beers that always pop up this time of year, mainly due to the higher alcohol of this... if I put myself in the mind of a winter warmer, it becomes more palatable to me... I might like this to be a bit darker, with less pumpkin, and more spice... that might round it out better for me."
"The mouthfeel from the carbonation made the drink very refreshing there was some slight bitterness at the finish. All in all a very good very mild ale."
"Flavor is light, as is the carbonation. Slight amber sense to it, otherwise light in body and rather boring overall. Unimpressive. And from Dogfish Head, at $2.79 for a single, extremely unimpressive. Simple and subtle, yet don't bother."
"Certainly the best pumpkin beer on the market. It's best on-tap in order to get that perfect creamy head."
"drinkability: An above average pumpkin, and a pleasure to drink."
"Drinkability: With a month to go till Halloween, this one's got some definite mileage."
"This fall I'm going to try to drink more pumpkin beers to get a better idea of where I stand on them. Then I'll revisit this one with a better idea on style comparison."
"I can't 'crush it' because as pumpkin beers go this was solid, but not something I would drink again."
"Drinkability: Give me a campfire and a sixpack!"
"An easy drinker for anyone into seasonal beers and a good shift away from the typical pumpkin styled ales."
"This is the pumpkin beer I've been waiting for."
"The drinkability is really high on this one. Despite the sweet flavor you feel like you can drink a few of these. The alcohol is a non-factor and you just want more of this beer. Taste is great, mouthfeel is amazing, and you can put this one down after the first taste. Great beer!"
"Poured into a snifter, nice 1 inch head. Color is amber with a touch of red. Smells of Cinnamon and nutmeg, getting some sort of smell rotting vegitibles as well. Taste is mostly nutmeg with alltile cinnamon, i am getting no hints punkin flavor. Really this taste more like some winter warmers to me. Mouthfeel is slightly creamy but nothing to write home about. Though the flavors are not offensive this beer let me down and after i finish the rest of my pack i doubt i will buy this again let alone taste unless this is included at an event i attend. Not reccomended, so far the best i have had for the style is Punking."
"I thought that this beer was solid. It is very drinkable and has great texture. I do feel though that the pumpkin is a little under developed, basically i want to drink a pumpkin pie! This beer was a little too sweet at the beginning, which was a little overpowering, and could have used more hop character. Other than that it is a very tasty and a good summer beer, very pleasant!"
"Palate wearying nontheless."
"Pours an absolutely gorgeous orange hue that is impeccably clear and just a tad bit of pale head and some effervescence. Smell is a little underwhelming, especially knowing that pumpkin, allspice, cinnamon and nutmeg all went into this brew. I wish the nose was a little more powerful. Honestly I couldn't pick out any of those notes, just a general spicy nose. Taste was good, mouthfeel a little thin, drinkability fine."
"Pours a copper color with some slight red highlights and a one finger head. The aroma is of pumpkin but it isn't over powering, there is also hints of nutmeg, clove, and some allspice. The taste is of pumpkin over a caramel malt, there is also hints of nutmeg present. The pumpkin taste isn't overpowering and still retains a nice beer flavor. The mouthfeel is of moderate carbonation. Overall this is a good drinkable beer. This isn't the best pumpkin you will ever have but it is solid."
"Though never a fan of so-called spicy beers, DFH usually comes through by crafting such """spicy beers""" without them becoming too cloyingly spicy - or sweet. As this style goes, DFH does do it well enough."
"Easily one of the better pumpkin beers I have had. Amber in the glass with a nice white head. The falling head leaves plenty of lace in its place. Smells of spice. Nutmeg, vanallia, cinnamon, and sweet malt. Taste is alot of the same. Spice is more subdued than I originally thought. Close to the end there is a bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium bodied. This is a good rendition of the style. Every year a solid offering."
"D- I can drink a pumpkin ale or 2, but not a bunch. For the season, when I'm in the mood for a pumpkin ale, it would be hard for me to go with something other than DFH's offering."
"D: Not too shabby indeed. I wouldn't session, anymore than two is overdoing it to me. Wish it came in sixers and not the four pack though. Other beers seem to be better in this category to me, but overall this sure is one hell of a brew."
"While this is quite a drinkable beer, for Dogfish Head this tastes simple and uninspired. I wouldn't call this ale off-centered at all, more like a typical, clean, pumpkin ale that does not stand out in terms of flavors. Way overpriced for what it is as well. Still, a pretty decent pumpkin ale, despite missing the expectations I have for the DFH brand and price tag."
"Pumpkin ales are such a niche market--a definitively seasonal style. As such, I have relatively narrowed expectations. This one falls short. It's too sweet to sip multiples, and too strayed to serve seasonally. Though I have enough respect for DFH to keep trying every year, this is far from the go-to for the style."
"This is a very good and flavorful beer. Something that is perfect for fall. I'll take this over any watery and thin American made O'fests any day."
"Taste is total opposite from its smell - sweetness from the malt and caramelized sugar is actually more predominant than the pumpkin. But towards the middle, the subtle spiciness from the cinnamon and all-spice becomes present on the tongue and finally ends upon a slight hop bitterness and boozey heat. Good overall taste with a bunch of flavor components. This pumpkin ale has a medium-bodied mouthfeel with adequate carbonation. Drinkability is fair to good. Not one of my favorite beer styles but overall, it's pretty decent. Very fitting for this coming autumn season."
"D - The drinkability of this beer, for me, is very high, this is a great Pumpkin Beer and I wish this was available in New Orleans"
"d- good, i could have a few of these, this was my first pumpkin beer, and i think i was just envisioning them to have a pure, straight pumpkin taste that this didn't have, i did really enjoy it though, i prefered it while it was nice and cold, as it warmed the pumpkin spices got a bit intense, overall its definately a fall beer, perfect for the crisp weather."
"Drinkability: Very mild pumpkin ale, the alcohol is high but barely apparent. Very drinkable. One of the better pumpkin ales."
"overall a better than average punkin ale."
"Mouthfeel is OK. Decent cabonation, but not as full-bodied as I thought it would be. Drinkability is good, I could definitely drink a couple of these on a cool fall evening."
"Overall: Really surprised and a great beer. Cheers!"
"Pretty good drinkability, I can see myself enjoying at least two of these in one session. It was my first experience with a pumpkin ale, but I don't think it will be my last. It remains to be seen if I revisit this particular one, though."
"Pours a nice autumnal yellow/orange + hint of brown, delicate lacing. Smell: a nice toasted scent that when thinking of pumpkins reminds me of toasting pumpkin seeds, caramel sweetness, spice - i think primarily the allspice and a touch of cinnamon. There is a vague sweet squash smell, which I could be convinced is pumpkin. From 10,000 ft, I guess there's a pumpkin pie motif here, but I don't get that fresh baked pie scent I was hoping for. Taste: toffee, brown sugar, toasted, cinnamon and allspice (and maybe nutmeg). I don't really get pumpkin, but with the creamy start to the mouthfeel I can imagine eating a whipped cream heavy bite of pumpkin pie. Unfortunately the sip ends with a feel like eating ground cinnamon straight out of the jar. Overall, this is a nice beer without the added search for the great pumpkin. Too sweet for everyday use, but will be a nice compliment to upcoming holidays."
"D - the 7% ABV is decently hidden, though a little bit pokes through. Wouldn't go out of my way to get again, but I'd drink another if it was given to me. All in all, a pretty good pumpkin beer - not that I am a big fan of the style."
"This is not my favorite pumpkin ale, but it's enjoyable. The alcohol is not hidden well."
"Great seasonal beer."
"Drinkability: A well put together beer, but I'm not sure I want another one of this this season. I might try to get something with a bit more pumpkin."
"D: The perfect beer for pumpkin season."
"Poured a clear (almost bright) amber (SRM9) with a 1/2""" thick off white head that panned out quick. Moderate carbonation. A strong pumpkin aroma with a moderate complex cinnamon/nutmeg spicing. A brown sugar sweetness noted in the aroma and no real discernible hops. Smooth dense pumpkin flavor that is not overly 'pie spiced' and is sweet and warming. Pumpkin is not harsh and sweetness not cloying. Full body with lingering warmth and moderate spiciness."
"Flavor is well-balanced. You can taste the pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg and other spices, but nothing dominates. The aftertaste is actually kind of bitter, slightly hoppy and acidic-tangy from the pumpkin meat. Sweet, but not overly sweet like so many DFH brews. Sweetness is brown sugar, sometimes molasses. Carbonation is medium, though it appears lively. This is one of the better Pumpkin beers out there, with a nice alcohol kick as well."
"Although not a big fan of the style, this one seems to be the best of the bunch. For me, though, its one, and done."
"This one is not my favorite from DFH and it leaves a bit to be desired from me. However I do think it is the best of the style and is truest to form so it definitely gets style points."
"It's a frothy brew and the vanilla takes well to that with the cinnamon and brown sugar playing opposite. Hits all the taste buds. My only complaint is that I may have liked something harsher in there somewhere."
"Pumpkin Head is medium in body and more full than other pumpkin beers I've had, which I appreciate. Finish is very clean, happily, without being bitter. While pretty full-flavored, this beer isn't overpowering, and it's interesting enough to make me drink it quickly."
"D: I could get lost in the smell of this ale, but I wish it tasted up to the par of its smell. Still, a good effort by DFH."
"Soid orange in color with medium head slowly didapates into a thin lace. Very bright. Aroma has a solid but not overpowering pumpkin nose followed by spice and a touch of hops. Not too much malt aroma. Very pleasant. Flavor consists of a grainy malt right up front followed by pumpkin and a touch of spices to balace this beer out. Nothing is overpowering. Carbonation is on the lighter side. Overall this is one tasty beer. Well rounded, balanced and tasty. I love pumpkin beers, Id say this is in the top 5"
"Drinkability: Hands down the best pumpkin beer in the category, not only is it the closest to hitting the mark on actual pumpkin taste, but the added spiciness adds a zest that no other pumpkin ale on the shelf can offer. The 7% is well hidden, making this overly sessionable. This is the beer you want by your side on a crisp fall night! Get it now while it's still in abundance."
"Overall, a great beer that's perfect for the fall seasons and holidays. A highly memorable beer. The only hindrance is price - 9.99 for a 4 pack."
"Light copper color with a cream-colored head that dissipates quickly but leaves a rim with a moderate amount of lace. The aroma is spicy with cinnamon and nutmeg dominating. Not as alluring as I would like but not bad. The flavor brings more to the table than the aroma. The same spices are there but seem fuller and more developed. The cinnamon comes forward and marries with the fruity pumpkin taste that's subtle but noticeable. It nicely carbonated and somewhat refreshing which is nice given the spice-forwardness of this beer. Feels rather full bodied but doesn't stick to the palate. I could have used a little more hop fruitiness to balance it out I think but it wasn't a huge problem. Seems like a good pairing for an apple pie with a nice dollop of whipped cream."
"I was kind of disappointed in this seasonal brew from dogfish and I am beginning to think that most of their beers get more credit then they deserve because they all taste the same in just little ways. You can totally taste the alcohol in this one and even though the pumpkin taste is very good and very real it does not make up for how boring the rest of the brew is. I don't know if I just do not care for these pumpkin brews. I have had a minor handful of them, (not talking dogfish head) and still have one that i thoroughly enjoy. The only reason i come back to them is because i love pumpkin but have not yet found one that translates into beer. I would totally pass on this one, i think dogfish gets to much credit for beers that all taste the same in ways. Overpriced and not worth it."
"Drinkability: This is a good, well-made pumpkin ale with a nice balance of spices (think """pumpkin pie"""). It has good drinkability and it is pleasant throughout. While I won't want two or three in a row it's a nice change of pace on an evening where you are having only one beer or want a couple of different beers. Although I'll not drink one of these every night until they are gone, I'll be having more."
"Perfect to integrate a Brown Ale as a basis for a fall seasonal. It's full of flavor and great spicey/malty flavor. It's extremely enjoyable, and really hard to find much to critisize about. Probably the best Fall seasonal I've had so far."
"The mouthfeel is smooth and the body of the beer is robust. Carbonation is low, but fits well. Overall, this is a nice, highly drinkable pumpkin ale, but it is lacking in the pumpkin flavor department. I think this is a great beer for people who are not huge pumpkin lovers, but if you really want a beer with lots of pumpkin flavor, then Pumking is still the way to go."
"Overall it's a nice fall beer. If I'm looking for pumpkin, I won't crack one. If I'm looking for something to enjoy by the fire on a crisp fall evening, this is something I'd go for."
"one of the best pumpkin ales with good reasons very drinkable ,smooth on the mark pumpkin and spiced just right ..cheers enjoy i did .."
"On-tap at Woody's served in a standard pint glass a crisp dark orange with a decent off white head that lasts as a thin layer. Aroma is a nice blend of spice and sweet malts. The taste is a wonderful blend of cinnamon, spices and caramel malts. The beer is very crisp and refreshing and the alcohol is well hidden. This one is very enjoyable, one of my favorite pumpkin beers."
"Notes - Unusually laid-back for Dogfish Head, but it's still a solid choice if you're in the mood for something different. This is a must-try for pumpkin pie lovers like myself."
"drinkablity is ok, pretty smooth inital mouttaste, but after taste kind of lingers of a sourish beer taste"
"D- It's like drinking water so it's really pretty easy to drink"
"I will be enjoying this brew this autumn and into the future; although in moderation, the 4-pack offering and the price do not promote more frequent tastings."
"It was pretty good but I must say, I was expecting a little more from dogfish head on this one. Don't get me wrong, it's a tasty drink, but the problem I have with it is that taste of pumpkin goes away after a few sips and becomes more of just a mildly spiced ale. So it's a little more on the spiced side and a little dryer then most pumpkin ales. Also, not as sweet. I'd say give it a shot but don't expect the crazy dogfish style, this ones a little more on the tamed side."
"Drinkability is high. I can't even taste the booze. Really, 7%?"
"A great pumpkin beer. A lot of pumpkin flavor without being overly sweet like many pumpkin beers. I wouldn't expect a dry pumpkin ale from Dogfish Head because of their history of having very sweet beers, but this is a real winner."
"Not bad for a pumpkin ale, but nowhere near Schlafly. There are a lot of breweries producing pumpkin ales so I consider this one to be in the upper echelon. Dogfish Head is pretty consistent in producing fine quality beer and this is no exception. Definitely drinkable for the season as the pumpkin flavor isn't muted as it is in other varieties."
"The best harvest/pumpkin ales maintain the essence of """ale," with subtle touches of spice. With the vast majority, spice overwhelms ale. 2007 Punkin was the best ever and 2008 was too spicy. This one is somewhere in between, but far better than other pumpkin beers I've tried and a pleasure on cool late summer evenings. On the other hand, the bottles included in one four-pack are enough to do the trick."
"Overall its a very drinkable beer that i would definitely have again."
"The heat of the 7% is a little much for the light spice flavors not a horrible thing, but I think the flavors would come out a little bit more. Aside from it being a little boozy its a nice smooth high carbonation. A nice introduction into pumpkin beers for me."
"D- Not hard to finish this beer and possibly have another one although I this is not my favorite pumpkin ale, it certainly is in my top 2 so far."
"Another pumpkin beer for me to try. This one has some promise. Poured into my pint glass the beer is clear orange amber. About an inch of beige head caps my glass. A thin film of lace sticks to the rim after the head recedes. The aroma is of course pumpkin, nutmeg, cinnimon and vanilla. Basically a piece of pumpkin pie with whip cream. The flavor is not as strong. Some pumpkin follow by pumkin spice. Vanilla seems rather strong. A nice oaky flavor with a touch of hop bite coming in at the end. Not as strong a pumpkin flavor as I had hoped but enought to satisfy me. Medium body with moderate carbonation. Overall a well put together pumpkin ale. Not my favorite but definatley in the conversation for top ten."
"It's easy to drink and very sneaky at 7%."
"Beer poured an average head. Slight smells of nutmeg and other spices. The taste lacked strong taste, but was a mellow pumpkin taste. Pretty easy to drink, especially at 7% (says the bottle). Not a bad pumpkin beer, but there are better. I would expect something greater from this brewing company!"
"Drinkability: Pumpkin ales are sort of a fall tradition for New England Brewers. A lot of them are syrupy and undrinkable. This kicks the artificial flavoring in the ass, this a truly what a pumpkin ale should be, a beer brewed with pumpkin and spice. The taste is natural and is a really good beer not just for a pumpkin ale. This wouldn't be a staple of mine but I rated it so high because well its one of the best for the style."
"First comes the standard pumpkin/cinnamon/nutmeg flavor, but immediately following and balancing the sweetness is a roasty dark malt, almost a brown ale flavor. Very drinkable due to the subdued pumpkin spice flavor. Mouthfeel is great due to the carbonation. Also, according to the bottled on date, the beer is about 2 weeks old. Could drink a few, but sharing a 4 pack so 2 is it!"
"Drinkability: Its not bad, sweet and spicy is what your looking at, as far as pumpkin ales go, this is my first. I could have a few of these, it is kind of syrupy though, and it would be interesting to try it with pumpkin pie."
"Overall: Kinda wish the name was 'punkin spice' instead of implying you're going to have some pie like characteristics. First pumpkin ale but I already think others will reign over it easily."
"Mouthfeel is a bit watery and light. This beer is on the sweet side. Not bitter, all spicy. Very sharp and carbonated. Really the best Pumpkin beer I've had and the extra abv is a nice addition."
"The tangy, spicy, dark sugary sweetness of this beer is really alluring. I wish I had more of this as its very drinkable at 7%. Punkin' Ale is not something you'd want to drink one of and then move on to something else. You could get comfortable with a 4-pack of these. Loved it."
"a milder pumpkin beer. Very nicely done; plenty of character and balance with a deft touch. Poured with a nice off-white head and good lace. Medium amber color. Malty and spicy aroma, but not over done. Ditto the flavor. Body is good too, with good carbonation. Finish is nice and as it should be for this style. Very satisfying. Not a session beer."
"(D)- A solid pumpkin beer that has a great presence of actual pumpkin flavors that some lack. Its a great example of the style! Good stuff."
"I would like to try this in keg form. Best punkin ale I have tried to date!"
"Drinkability - Great beer for a fall evening, although I would have liked more pumpkin flavor"
"D: I would say this one is a keeper. The higher than expected alcohol content encourages me to enjoy one per session. But this is one that I will keep in my rotation of fall seasonal beers. If you get a chance to try it, go for it. It's worth it."
"Drinkability - This is a warming beer and is perfect for the transition of fall. Medium finish means food is not necessary with this one or anything to cleanse the palate."
"12oz brown bottle obtained at McKinnon's in Salem, NH. pours a crystal clear amber color with a half inch of off white head that dissipated within five minutes leaving a little bit of head clinging to the side of the glass. scents of pumpkin, nutmeg, cinnamon, and other spices. to me, it smells like warm homemade pumpkin bread straight out of the oven. tastes of pumpkin and spices graces the taste buds leaving a small after taste of the nutmeg. a toffee like quality plays in the background of the taste. moderate carbonation. one sip invites another. very tasty ale for the fall season."
"I love Dogfish Head, Sam and Co. make some of my favorite beers and I applaud their creativity and passion for extreme beers, but this isn't going to make it into my regular rotation of fall seasonals."
"Cheers!"
"drinkability is good. the spice is light enough to keep it drinkable and very tasty. overall a solid pumpkin ale. cheers!"
"D- very drinkable brew in my opionion. Lots of malt and adjunct flavor but still a light to moderate bodied beer. Easily kill fourr of these in a sitting. So far most flavorful pumpkin ale to date. Still have to try southern tiers imperial pumpking."
"drinkability is also great - some pumkin beers are too boozy over spiced or water thin - dfh nailed this one"
"It looks really good , very dark amber color to it. It might just be my nose, but I didn't really find too much aroma to it. It had a great taste, something did come across as maybe too much, and I think that was the nutmeg. Great mouthfeel, heavy enough to feel its character, but not to heavy, and very drinkable."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability - I could definitely knock a few back, that's for sure."
"I'm sure the fact that I had this on tap helped my cause a bit, too."
"This comes out of the tap a clear, orange amber with not much head - but that may be a result of the way it was poured. Rich aroma is mainly of pumpkin and cinnamon with a malty undertone. Flavor is mostly pumpkin with a cinnamon undertone, but there is enough malt so you know this is beer. Texture is fairly smooth, fizzy and pleasing."
"Final thoughts: This beers is actaully a little surpising. The nose is really spiced, but the flavors has sweet brown sugar, pumpkin, very light on the spice, and not really and bad or off flavors. Good for DFH again!Its got great drinkability and very refreshing."
"Another fine DFH."
"Overall, I was a little disappointed. I haven't had many pumpkin ales, but was hoping for something a little richer."
"If you want a perfectly balanced Pumpkin Ale, this is it. Alot of others use too much spice and not enough pumpkin or too much pumpkin and barely any spice. This is an exceptionaly balanced flavored beer. Pours a reddish brown with a 2 finger head that dissipates quickly ( as expected for the stle of beer) Original smell is of pumpkin pie. mouthfeel is smooth, slightly clovy with a taste of Cinnamon, and finishes clean with more spices and Pumpkin coming through. This beer is even better if left at room temperature for a few minutes after taking out of the fridge. After drinking this i almost don't even want to try any of the other pumpkin ales, i will be buying a case of this every season!!!!"
"The drinkability on this particular batch is quite good. I've not had Punkin before, but it's not overly sweet like some Pumpkin Ales I've had in the past."
"Notes: While not being blown off my stool by this beer, I can easily say it is a very good brew. I like my first taste of this style and can say that I will be trying other Pumpkin Ales this fall."
"Poured a crystal clear, medium amber, so it looked sort of like a pumpkin. A moderate head that faded quickly to a collar. The aroma was not that strong. The taste was nutmeg and sweet. The feed was medium bodied, oily and mildly carbonated at the tip of the tongue. Drinkability was good."
"D - good given the speciality of the style, now i want some pumpkin chocolate-chip bread, sugar cookies or carrot cake to pair with this amazing """liquid fall""""
"Second verdict - so-so. :-/"
"D - I like this don't think I would drink a lot, but if offered would not turn down."
"Still a little early for pumpkin beer or at least I think but at couldn't resist. From the bottle to a pint glass, pours a hazy dark orange/burnt orange color. Has a one finger head that pretty quickly goes to just a small head that is barely there. Leaves some lacing down the glass. Smell is spices and pumpkin right up front. Pretty typical of the other pumpkin beers I've had. Taste is as I was expecting. Pumpkin and spices right up front, and it's followed by that familiar Dogfish Head taste. Really good taste. Has a 7% ABV which isn't high or anything but no alcohol is noticeable in the taste. Really easily drinkable. Of the few pumpkin ales I've had this is up there maybe as the best I've had yet. Overall great stuff, I'll be picking up some more of these and save them for more of a better autumn day."
"Na Zdravje!"
"9/22/10 I Had to change my ratings on this beer its thru the roof in everyway this year. stunningly good best pumpkin beer out there by far"
"Drinkability: I am really enjoying this beer - the flavors are nice and perfect for a cool evening that is starting to border on early fall. While I don't think I'd crave something like this year-round, it really is a great seasonal and the flavors are well-blended and don't remind me necessarily of eating a piece of pie, but really add a nice dimension to the beer."
"This is a VERY good pumpkin ale and IMO one of the best out there. Spend the 8.99 and enjoy four of these on four separate nights. You'll come to enjoy it more each night."
"all in all - this one's up there with weyerbacher imperial as one of my favorites pumpkin ales. another job well done from the dudes over at dogfish."
"D- Excellent drinkability, not too much carbonation. These come in a 4 pack but I could have easily consumed twice that amount."
"D - An interesting and very tasty brew. Perfect for the start of fall and cooler weather. I will definitely revisit this one again."
"The first thing you notice is the spice smell, its quite intense, then there it the taste. The taste is quite strong of brown sugar to the point it reminds me of Hagen Daz five: Brown Sugar. The beer is a medium body feels crsip and bubbly. Fairly drinkable, not sure how much of this flavor I'd want but I wouldn't mind a few"
"Overall, probably the best pumpkin ale I have had to date. Balanced with good flavor and a crisp mouthfeel."
"Easily one of the best pumpkin ales, if not THE best. It does wonders paired with vanilla ice cream and cake desserts, too.The only pumpkin ales I've had that are on par with this one were brewed in tiny batches for on-site consumption only. It's usually a pretty tough feat to get the spices and pumpkin mixes right on the large scale, but DFH has done it. In this case, it's beer first, spices second."
"Drinkability- fantastic for a pumpkin ale. well rounded overall without too much spice. Currently my favorite example of the style."
"MOUTH FEEL: A medium bodied beer, slightly high on the carbonation, with a slight alcohol heat, but very creamy. Finishes just a tad on the dry side, with a lingering pumpkin spice."
"No complaints but no major raves either."
"CHEERS!!"
"drinkability: great pumpkin beer, probably one of the best I have had. Great session too. I like smuttys a little better. less spice more pumpkin flavor"
"M/D: Body is on the full side, very creamy mouthfeel. Alcohol doesn't have much presence."
"This beer is very drinkable, but at 7% ABV it packs a nice punch."
"A pretty good looking beer. Pours a color that's darker than amber, but slightly lighter than tea with excellent clarity. Doesn't really have much of a head. There was very little left by the time it was brought to me and what was left pretty much stuck around the edges. Had far less than average lacing, but all in all looked pretty nice. The smell was pretty good. Spices from pumpkin pie or pumpkin bread, followed by some roasted malts. I'm not really a fan of Pumpkin styles beers (with the exception of Cape Ann's Pumpkin Stout) but this was pretty good. It has the sweet taste that you would expect. However it's not overly sweet like most pumpkin style ales. I kind of wonder if there are roasted pumpkin seeds in this brew instead of the sweet pumpkin spices of most pumpkin beers. It actually tastes like a beer as well, not like it should be warm with a head of whipped cream topped with a little nutmeg and cinnamon. Mouthfeel is good, no carbination or alcohol bite at all. I'd say the drinkability is good too I'm giving it a 4 instead of a 3.5 cause I'm generally not a fan of this style but it was way better than I expected. All in all pretty good. I would not get this regularly but certainly get it again if in the mood and given the opportunity."
"Next time I'm definitely having this with some type of autumn dessert, be it cinnamon crumb cake, apple crisp, or dare I say...pumpkin pie!"
"This beer pours a light amber-gold color with a thick, rocky white head. The head recedes gradually leaving nice thick, sticky lacing. Nose was of pumpkin predominantly, I didn't get much else in the nose. Taste - well, I had tried this beer years ago and didn't like it. Second time around....FAR better. Taste is all pumpkin up front, ALL pumpkin, and then mingling in is a nice cocoa/chocolate taste. There are some malts present, but not picking up much spicing... it was pumpkin and chocolate and it was GOOD. Medium body, medium carbonation, nice thick creamy feel on the tongue. A beer that I once despised has now become nectar of the gods."
"Delicious and worth the wait to track it down."
"I am a huge fan of this style; however, this one has left me a bit disappointed (perhaps due to it almost being a year old) especially after being very excited by the smell. I will definitely try this again and see if I feel any different."
"D - It's tasty, but the whole thing seems contrived, like some sort of cheesy holiday beer. I was hoping for a 'pumpkin ale', not a 'pumpkin pie filling ale'. The pumpkin aromas and flavors come across as something of an afterthought. In that respect, I can't give this brew anything higher than a B."
"Good DFH brew, great pumpkin brew. Worth trying, bring some to Thanksgiving dinner."
"Not one of my favourite American brews, and yet again I have to say I'm disappointed with a style of beer I wish I could get to like. Have I just had bad examples?? Something tells me that there's a beautiful, wonderful pumpkin ale out there somewhere... Unfortunately, this isn't it."
"Am not getting much pumpkin, although there is a hint of spice on the mid - nutmeg I think, while there is a noticeable hint of alcohol on the back, but I think it's noticeable mainly because I wasn't expecting a heavy beer from the appearance and smell. Mouthfeel is quite nicely smooth but that booze hit makes me recoil just a bit. Fairly drinkable I guess, but again that zing marks it down a shade."
"Bottle Pours a hazy amber with a decent off white head, which produces good lacing. Has a delightful aroma of pumpkin, brown sugar, all spice, cinnamon, and a touch of nutmeg. Has an aroma of a ginger snap cookie. Just smelling this one gives me incredable amount of excitement. The carbination is soft. Has a light body. A soft duration, and weak finish. All the aromas come out beautifully in the flavor of this beer. Its a wonderful beer. Gives me visions of good halloween deserts. I'm slowly becoming a big fan of pumpkin ales."
"Bottle aged about 9 months from this past fall. Unremarkable in appearance. Smell still has a good deal of spicing to it. But in the flavors, the spicing has been mellowed out a good deal by the aging. it's much smoother than before. The flavour is less outlandish, but it works here. Mouthfeel is decent, straightforward fall pumpkin beer. A bit watery, but still better than a lot of Pumpkin Ale's I've had. The extra smoothness adds a bit to taste, but quite a bit more to drinkability. It doesn't make the beer spectacular, but adds a nice little chunk to the review average."
"Bottle. Just had to go off season for this one. Pours a darker copper color with orange hues and a nice thinner head. Smells like fall again cinnamon and nutmeg, feels great on the chillier night. Mouthfeel is full bodied and rich, aromas follow into the palate very well. Its like drinking pumpkin pie but not as rich, yet malty enough for you to believe you are. So smooth and rich decent dry finish. The hops have subdued and mellowed the beer out perfect. Winner!"
"12 ounce bottle poured into a nonic pint glass. Appears a clear rich dark amber color with around an inch of creamy off white foam. A minimal lacing is left on the glass with each sip. Smells and tastes of pumpkin pie spices such as nutmeg (most dominant), cinnamon, allspice, nice nutty roasted pumpkin notes, toasted grain, just the right amount of sweetness from the brown sugar. Maybe a bit more than medium bodied with ample carbonation. If you are a fan of pumpkin ales, this is one of the better ones out there."
"D: Everything gets to be a little much to have more than one, but this is a damn fine brew."
"Decent brew all around."
"i have backed off holiday brews for some time...this makes me want to jump back in...this HAS to be the best pumpkin ale i've ever had. i used to love this style a few years ago...orange veggies are a favorite of mine. this is like liquid pumpkin bread with a cheesecake somewhere in the vicinity. worth every penny and drop."
"Very Drinkable . After drinking so many porters of late, the 7% is welcome and not overpowering."
"Drinkability: This is very much like a pumpkin pie. I love how you get the sweet first, then the hops...sort of like eating the filling, then the different taste for the crust. This one definately has a beer feel to it. That said I do not think I could drink more than two in one sitting."
"Drinkability is great, hides the alcohol well."
"This one packs a wallop of spice. The warming feeling feels nice, but the taste could be a little nicer."
"Pours a slightly hazy copper color with a quickly dissipating mostly white head. Smells of sweet pumpkin spices like nutmeg and cinnamon. There are malts and a light floral hop aroma also present in the nose. First sip is all malt and spice with hardly any hops noticeable. By far, one of the better pumpkin beers I have had and a vey good example of the style."
"I have had this on tap also at The Flying Saucer in Fort Worth. I have to say I liked it better out of the bottle. Pours an amber color with an oily thin off white head. Smells of cinnamon, pumpkin, nuts. Taste very strong of pumpkin, come other spices also. Big flavor. Slight alcohol burn in the end. med bodied, fairly thin finish though. This gets better as it warms."
"Overall: The mouth feel is carbonated and slightly dry. The body of the beer is medium. The finish is slightly bitter. So far out of all the pumpkin beer this beer is very well made. The pumpkin is very flavorful bright and with spices. I really like this beer. It is like eating a pumpkin pie and drinking a well round brown ale. Kudos to Dogfish Head. I really like this beer."
"D: The best pumpkin ale I've had. A great fall seasonal and excellent beer to serve on Thanksgiving day."
"This is the most drinkable pumpkin I've tried to date and holds up to my expectations from DFH brewery. Nice with food too! Definetly recomended."
"Probably the best pumpkin beer I've ever had, which is not saying much as pumpkin beers always taste like farts. A successful attempt at a gourd beer."
"D - I think this is the best pumpkin beer that I've had so far it has a good enjoyable flavor perfect for the fall time"
"The beer pours a dark amber almost brown color with a nice cap of foam which settled into a ring around the glass. The aroma reminds me of pumpkin pie: sweet pumpkin, cinnamon, and brown sugar. The flavor is not as strong in the pumpkin category, but it is still there throughout. The beer starts with some grainy malt while the spice and a hint of hops become prevalent toward the end. A solid medium-bodied brew. Not overtly pumpkin in the flavor, but that is just fine with me."
"Mouthfeel is middle of the road - reserved carbonation and a medium body."
"Had a creamy feel that tickled the roof of my mouth, I could probably have 2 of these at most, like any other spiced beer."
"D- Fantastic beer that leaves you wanting another and another and another..."
"i feel like i need a little more spice..."
"Very interesting and good brew"
"But hey, this was made on just another day at the Dogfish Head Brewery...one could only imagine.... what could be next?...."
"Pours a clear brown-light brownish colored body, with a huge head, white, and lasting. Has a malty spicy aroma, some cinnamon, and nutmeg, weakish though. Has a nice taste of pumpkin, light malty taste. Somewhat bitter aftertaste."
"From the look of this beer i would not say this is a brown ale on appearence alone. Smell was not what i expected nothing pronouced some pumpkin and malty background hints of spice. Taste of this brew was pretty well balanced with a sweet malty flavor hints of pumpkin but not to overwhelming. It has a nice hoppy background as well, creamy texture. Not a big fan of pumpkin ales. i've always wanted to find a decent pumpkin brew but everytime i seem to be disapointed. Luckily this by far is the best one i have tried. Doesnt taste like a artificial pumkpkin soda its a beers ladies and gentlemen and pretty decent one. Not great but decent give it a try but my days of buying pumpkin beers are over."
"I'm not sure where this appeared from in January, but I'm not complaining. I had a pint (low-head) with my soup and pizza at Liberty St. Tavern. The hops have died down a bit since October, but this is still about the hoppiest pumpkin ale you can find. It starts with big, pulpy pumpkin meat in the aroma and flavor which is followed by a bitter burst of citrus. This isn't the most complexx pumpkin beer, the malts never really came out. But I'd say it's the most balanced and certainly one of the more pleasant to drink."
"date consumed: 19 Oct 2008"
"T -"
"D= high, overall this beer is by far my favorite pumpkin beer I've had. Its unique and delicious. The seperation the the real pumpkin taste and the spices blew me away great beer!"
"Pours a slightly hazy University of Texas burnt orange with a ring of white bubbles for a head. Pumpkin, nutmeg, and cinnamon aroma. More veggie than spice, but without that awful burnt Jack-O-Lantern that some beers get. Nice, spicy taste. The blend gives it a pumpkin bread flavor versus the expected pumpkin pie. More grain and some caramel malt show through. First pumpkin ale that has an ale flavor to it. A tad metallic at times, but easily dismissed. Lower carbonation enhances the flavor. Nice beer."
"I'd definitely drink this again. I wish it were more readily available. Not as much of a spice bomb as I expected from the nose, and more like a spiced brown ale than a typical pumpkin ale. Quite drinkable and certainly one to try if you like the style."
"6/4/7/4/13 (3.4/5)"
"Drinkability: I really like this offering from DFH. It's a shame that there isn't much pumpkin. I could drink quite a few of these."
"Beer pours a light copper and has a decent head which dissapates rather quickly. The smell is strong of malt, nutmeg, cinnamon and spices. The taste is of pumpkin pie with heavy nutmeg. This beer is a good beer for the season it is intended. I wouldn't say this would be a regular year round type of beer but it is one of the better Pumpkin Ales. The drinkability is fine and it pairs well with the Thanksgiving turkey."
"Cheers!!!!"
"This is probably the best pumpkin ale I've ever had."
"12 oz Bottle. Amber pour with a thin off white head. Nice lacing despite a somewhat medium to thin mouthfeel. Aroma of nutmeg, other spices and (surprise) pumpkin. Taste of malt and pumpkin with alcohol present. Lingering finish. Not a huge fan of pumpkin ales but this was pretty good."
"A fine beer to have on hand in the fall or holidays. Even your non beer drinking aunt or brother in law might like it."
"The Mouth feel is what really makes this one of my favorite beers, aside from that aftertaste. Smoother than melted butter and very creamy, the texture does not command too much of you, and it glides right down."
"Pours light brown, smells like pumpkin pie. Lots of brown sugar and ginger, pumpkin flavor. Sweet. A bit too much carbonation, some stinging alcohol there also which is uncharacteristic for a DFH brew. Average at best."
"(rated Oct 16, 2007)"
"This is an excellent winter beer, perfect for the holodays. It pours a hazy amber color with a nice frothy, sticky head that about 1 finger. Also has decent lacing. As for the aroma spices, spices and more spices. There are hints of hops, citrus and pumpkin, but boy are ther spices. As for the taste here we go. It starts out with the taste of hops and citrus and finishes with the spices. The mouthfeel is awesome. Absolutely delicious with thanksgiving dinner. This is a light bodied beer that is very drinkable. A must try in my opinion."
"A few friends of mine had a pumpkin beer tasting with 16 different pumpkin beers and Punkin' tied for first. Not too shabby."
"Amber orange, crystal clear with a big frothy head that has solid retention. Rings of lacing as it falls slowly to a ring during consumption. Smell is quite large and full of, well, pumpkin. It's pumpkin pie, no doubt. Amazingly, it has scent similar to a crust of the pie as well with its bready, doughy characteristic. Some light cinnamon and brown sugar. Taste has a bit much cinnamon for me. It's pretty harsh up front. There is still some brown sugar and other spices. Far from what I picked up in the nose in terms of balance. It's here and there with the flavors, never balancing them as one but showcasing them seemingly one at a time. Cinnamon up front for sure along with other spices, a little sugary sweetness and bready finish. Mouthfeel is well carbonated and smooth. Light dryness in the finish, maybe from the spice? The aftertaste brings memories of the crust, which isn't as apparent in the initial flavor. Damn, if only this lived up to the nose. Still not a bad pumpkin beer by any means. It's kind of big. I would enjoy one at a time but more than that is just too much."
"Pours a cloudy amber-orange with a small white head. Aroma of pumpkin, cinnamon and sugar cane. Nice amount of spice to balance out the pumpkin flavoring resulting in less of a pumpkin taste than I would have liked. Overall, a pretty good seasonal beer."
"HV"
"D: I take my hat off for the boys at Dogfish again. Just when you think they will always go for the extreme beer and assault you with multiple spices and bang, this is a more relaxed and low key version. Still quike pumpkiny in flavor but a great variation of the style."
"Not my favorite pumpkin brew but I would definitely buy it again. I'd like to try this one on tap to see if any different."
"golden amber crisp clear with a white head. lace. smell of spice, nutmeg and cinnamon mainly. pumpkin seed. taste is herbal with hardy earth. the cinnamon is nice. the nutmeg is a bit much. malt is buttery follow through with a mild hop. would like to see more malt bonding with the pumpkin. like that this isn't a sweet beer though. definitely more a 'season' though with the amount of herbal qualities this has."
"A truly terrific beer, great for the holidays. Definitely on the pricey side (51 bones or so/case) but worth it!"
"taste had a great pumpkin flavor (go figure) with a nice little alcoholic zing without being too much or overpowering. the spices shine through more in the aroma than in the taste itself, which provides a nice compliment and balance to the pumpkin flavor. the mouth gets a little splash of carbonation ast the pumpkin flavor spreads throughout the entire mouth."
"While I liked the beer, its not once I would drink often even if it was a year round brew. It drank well though overall."
"Drinkability was good. Fairly crisp and mildly bitter."
"A vast improvement compared with most other beers of the style, though I think I'd still rank Elysian's Night Owl ahead of it. I'm thinking a head-to-head of both beers might be interesting, accompanying a boycott of other pumpkin beers available in this area, as they are generally unimpressive."
"Overall, I've been wanting to try this beer for so long. I like it, but i wish it was a little better. I think i can say that about all the pumpkin ales ive had...i guess it is the style then- i think i like the idea of pumpkin ales more than the actual beer. But as far as this beer goes, i think it's pretty good, and a top one of the style, but if i'm not in the mood, i would much rather another one from dfh."
"This is a terrific autumn brew. The spices are prominent but not overpowering, and the sweetness is rich but not cloying. The pumpkin flavor meshes well with the Dogfish Head note I tried to describe above. I do find the alcohol to be slightly hot, and I'd love to try a version of this beer that falls between 5.5% and 6%."
"Taste is pumpkin, with a sweet cinnamon-y sugar finish. Body and mouthfeel are light."
"Bottle thanks to zathrus13, who sent this beer via footbalm. Thanks man. Pours a clear copper color with a medium white bubbly head. The aroma is full of sweet pumpkin notes, some spices, and a bit of malts. Interestingly, tha flavor has a large hop profile along with pumpkin and loads of spices. The finish is mostly bitter with a somewhat off-putting alcohol bite. Not bad at all. An interesting take on the style."
"This beer is the epitome of all things """fall""". The scent of cinnamon, nutmeg and brown sugar beckon to be slowly taken-in, and elicit thoughts of Halloween, cooler weather and home made pumpkin pie. It is a must have for a fall dinner with friends, sitting around a campfire or watching post-season baseball."
"D - This is a decent pumpkin ale, but not a masterpiece. If I'm going to go after a 7% beer, I want a more pronounced flavor profile that's better rounded. This one seems to be a bit jagged, much as many other DFH beers are, but also unbalanced. Would I have another after this one in my drinking session? Not likely... there are too many other better pumpkin ales out there."
"* It's a fine, balanced pumpkin ale, with a little more hops than expected."
"M/D: Medium body with good carbonation level. The beer was creamy and smooth and I could have had more than one. I will be having this one again."
"The deep amber ale tasted like a malty version of local apple cider until a wash a alcohol made its way into the moment and then it turned into something resembling barleywine. The taste was the reward of the aroma as it lingered on well after it was gone. It had me dreaming of scenes in the Fall...great ale."
"D- good seasonal for a cold fall day; probably a good compliment with Thanksgiving dinner."
"D- it would be easy to have a few of these on a cooler evening not a bad offering from dogfish head again."
"Drinkability- Very good spiced beer with lots of flavor. Would go well with any cinnimon or spiced dessert."
"Overall, one of the best pumpkin ales I've had. The taste is very well-balanced with pumpkin, spice, and malt. Smells and tastes like pumpkin pie. Highly recommended."
"Kinda put off by the big oak flavor and the bitterness. I was hoping for somthing a bit more sweet and desert like. Didnt like that peppercorn flavor either. Not a total loss though at 7% it should warm me up. :)"
"Drinkability: Very very drinkable."
"Drinkability: Pretty drinkable in my opinion. Not sure how many I could drink in one sitting, but one is good."
"Drinkability: Still one of the better pumpkin beers out there in my opinion, this one's solid across the board. Tastes authentic, it's well-spiced, and it's not overly cinnamon-ish (as many pumpkin ales are). Recommended."
"D. Too strong for a session but incredible taste and higly enjoyable."
"Bought the 4-pack for Halloween. The beer had a wonderfully festive orange glow to it with some really, really good lacing. Somewhat thin head after a relatively thick, orange-burnt brown head laces away. Aromas are simplistic and general than seasonally rich. Has that cinnamon hint but more bready, aspects sensed. Still, packs a spiced hint. Taste is generally sweet with a burnt, spiced bitterness. Generally well balanced and crisp, but definitely more desert-oriented thanks to its sweetness. Overall, an excellent pumpkin ale."
"d - this is the best pumpkin beer I have had thus far. It has a great balance of spices and hops. The alcohol is there in the right balance too, noticeable but not overpowering. This will be my benchmark for next year :)"
"Pretty good pumpkin ale, but like always, I would like to see more of an actual pumpkin presence. Aber color and a thick tan head. The nose has some sweet malts, spices and subtle pumpkin. The taste is a little lighter. Good spice presence matches well with the malts, but where is the pumpkin. Medium body goes down well."
"the NC Beer Monger is a fan of this beer!"
"this would make a great trick or treat beer"
"This is an example of adding pumpkin flavor to a great brown ale as opposed to just highlighting pumpkin and spice. Well done!"
"Nice golden orange color with a relatively nice thick head the disipates fast. A little astringent in taste to me even after pouring into a pint glass. Also had this on tap at one pub and enjoyed it much more. A little to spicey for my tastes but would still reccomend to try it."
"M/D: the mouthfeel is hurt by the light body that lacks a certain pumpkin bliss. this is a great beer but you have to wonder if pumpkin is central. i will continue to enjoy it, but wont say it is pumpkin central"
"Mouthfeel has a mild creaminess and a mild carbonation. I really like pumpkin ales, and this is a good one. I believe the key is the texture, and this one has a good balance."
"Overall I think this is one of the better pumpkin ales I have tried, and certainly is in line with the balance of the DF line. I applaud them for producing such a trifle and wouldn't mind enjoying one of these now and again in the fall."
"Drinkability- Smooth, nice and better on tap than I remember. I'll go for this again."
"Poured into a pint glass and gave a good inch half foam and reduced down to a great lingering lacing. The rich amber coloration was very clear. Aroma of spices greets the nose of nutmeg and cinnamon. When tasting there is a slight sugar malt content of the brown sugar. Aftertaste is that of the nutmeg, cinnamon and low hop taste."
"Drinkability is moderate. It's a decent pumpkin ale, and I could drink it again. I'm not wowed though."
"I love the styles of beer which I drink but once a year, for they fill me with nostalgia and cheer."
"Mouthfeel is well-carbonated and medium-bodied. Sweet clean aftertaste, very little hoppiness, semi-dry finish. Very very drinkable."
"D: This is a really good pumpkin beer from Dogfish Head. Very drinkable, I just wish it was easily available in SoCal like it is in NorCal."
"D: easy to drink and a great choice for fall beer drinking."
"Poured into a DFH tumbler. Murky copper with a pretty fluffy 2 fingers of near-white head. Aroma of cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg. Noticeable hop flavor on top of a slice of pumpkin pie. Spicy maltiness rounds this one quite nice. Hop bitterness evident on the finish."
"Drinkability: This is my first pumpkin beer, and I enjoyed it very much. I will definitely have to pick up another four pack. Though I enjoyed it I would probably tire of the beer if it were available year round. Now that I have tried a pumpkin though, I will be keeping an eye out for others."
"I finished the four pack in one sitting. I prefer Weyerbacher but this was still pretty good."
"D- As I was drinking the 3rd of the pack last night I was struck by an intense nostalgia for fall up north- and it's not that there's really anything in this beer that reminds me of specific things like pumpkin pie or mulled cider- just that this beer tastes of fall like nothing else. I am truly happy to have bought it and highly recommend it to all who are looking for a little fall in their lives."
"Medium to full bodied and quite spicy, I was apprehensive about the pumpkin flavoring at first, but quickly won over by this seasonal beer. Almost as if you're drinking in the turning of the leaves. I haven't found a Dogfish Head yet that I didn't like."
"Of all the pumpkin ales I've tried (about 4) this one is the best yet and I will certainly be buying this beer again. I'm looking forward to pairing it with some Holiday dinners in the near future."
"Overall: seems like a novelty, but a good one."
"Served: in a standard pint glass."
"Orangey-copper with a thin, bubbly head that has some decent stick to it. Festive pumpkin pie spices hit the nose first...nutmeg and allspice mostly with some actual pumpkin aromas. Some pie crust even as it warms. More pumpkin in the flavor while the spices fade into the back a little. Fruity esters creep in and blend with the overall sweetness. The strength is evident even though alcohol flavors are not really a problem. Medium mouthfeel with a slight, almost rindy bitterness. Enjoyable, but I wouldn't really want more than one or two."
"This is more watery than I would like. Feels a little thin. I was expecting a bit more robustness. Having said that, it is still quite drinkable, even given the higher alcohol. I like this."
"D - Not the best pumpkin beer I've had, but certainly better than most. The cloying aftertaste leaves me wanting a full, crisp beer to cleanse my beer-drinking palate!"
"Pours a copper color, little head and no lacing. The nose is very appealing, it seems like it has a nice mixture of pumpkin and spices. It looks like there is stuff suspended in the glass. Its not a bad tasting beer, for a pumpkin. There is a bit of an alcohol taste and the taste is not as good as the smell. I will try one of these every year just to check in, but pumpkin beers, no matter how i want to like them, aren't my favorite style."
"The taste is interesting with a mix of leaves, bread crust, pumpkin, spice, a hint of alcohol at first, with subsequent flavours of burnt pumpkin and toasty raisins. It's lightly sweet and zesty-spicey, with a spicey, leafy bitterness in the finish along with burnt pumpkin and toast. It's quite good, tasty, and interesting, but the burnt pumpkin taste gets a little tiresome."
"I think I made out a little better on the trade."
"D- the spices, though bold, don't get in the way of drinkability here. The base of this beer, supposedly a brown ale, really pulls it's weight enough to make you think you're not just drinking perfume the entire time like some other pumpkins."
"Loved this one, try the Weyerbacher if you did too.."
"Whether you like pumpkin beers or not, this is a well crafted beer."
"DFH does this one right every year. It's not a gimmicky beer, like so many other """offbeat""" seasonals. This years seems a little spicier than last's, and I may prefer it to this year's. But that's a close call. I'd like to see a bigger version of this that would age well."
"Drinkability- Very drinkable, its a bit rich and slightly heavy. But a very nice beer."
"The taste was great as well as the beer is clearly bodied: pumpkin, good ale with some hops, and finally the """banquet""" (nutmeg, brown sugar, and cinnamon each distinguishable). Very drinkable and even more enjoyable outside for the autumn effect."
"Given the heavy texture of some pumpkin ales, this one was a pleasant surprise. It was medium bodied with a little bit of carbonation that adds just a bit of tingle to the palate as you sip. However, the beer is so rich that I just can't see myself drinking more than one or two of these. Hence, the lower score on the drinkability."
"Medium bodied with a silky mouthfeel. I've only had a few pumpkin beers, none of which have been very impressive, so it's nice to have a pumpkin ale that tastes like...pumpkin. This one strikes a really nice balance between the pumpkin and all the spices. This would be perfect at a Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner."
"Overall: A very good beer. Usually not a fan of this style-But this is one beer worth trying-enjoy after dinner or while carving up some pumpkins!"
"Overall Impressions: During the late fall and through winter I normally settle down with a nice warm apple cider (non-alcoholic) from the local orchards, but this might have jumped from a chance substitute to a permanent spot in the starting line-up. Tied with Brooklyn's Dark Chocolate Stout for my #1 favorite seasonal."
"this is a good effort for a pumpkin beer. I had this beer 3 days after it was bottled. The color is a rich copper color with a weak head. the aroma is of nutmeg and definate pumpkin flavor. I have to say i liked this beer on the warmer side to enjoy all the flavor. a good pumpkin beer. mouth feel sweet but medium. drinkablity good."
"Pretty dark amber looks with average sized off-white head. Smells of pumpkin harvest, nutmeg, cinnamon and other pungent spices. The taste is perfect for the autumn season, lets go for a walk through falling leaves right now. Pumpkin pie, oatmeal cookies, cinnamon tickles the tongue and lingers for a delicious aftertaste reminiscent of ginger snaps. Through the snow to Grandma's house we go...Bottoms up!"
"Notes: This is a very drinkable beer a great seasonal beer as well. Cheers"
"I notice that some people compare this beer to Southern Tier Pumpking...with that said Pumpking is still the King. However those two beers are on a different level than other pumpkin beers. This offering is not over spiced and has a nice pumpkin presense. one thing i noticed with this beer is that it has the body of DFH indian brown ale, in the taste and nose. Very noticable burnt notes found in the indian brown ale."
"Very good beer. I know pumpkin beers can be looked at as a novelty, and to an extent they are, but I welcome the novelty. This is pretty much the standard to judge others by."
"DFH Punkin is a fine pale ale. The drink is perfectly-carbonated, fullish in body, and plenty pumpkiny and spicy, even for a pumpkin pie-lover like myself. Superb drinkability."
"Good pumpkin ale. Nice to have beers like this when fall comes around."
"D= A very drinkable punpkin ale, and one that will certainly appeal to fans of brown ale and pumpkin pie spices. I think I slightly prefer the Pumking from Southern Tier, but this is still a great beer."
"Pours a nice copper color, but with very little head and no lacing. Nice scent, very pumpkinish, with pie spice, although it's almost too pieish and not enough aleish. Nice taste, same with the taste, with a lot of spice and bit of hops in the aftertaste. Not the smoothest pumpkin ale, but not bad. It's worth a try, but I prefer Blue Moon's, it's easier to find, cheaper, and just as good (in one of the rare cases of a macro being just as good, or better, than a craft)."
"Drinks cleanly. Strong but tight. What a pleasant surprise!"
"rig-a-ma-role!"
"Medium-bodied but with a thick, chewy character undoubtedly imparted by the inclusion of real pumpkin in the mash. Despite the slightly elevated ABV, this is a wonderfully delicious ale, and just as with a whopping slice of pumpkin pie on Thanksgiving, it leaves you aching for more."
"Nice dark coppery color with a bit of head. Smells like punkin pie. and tastes that way too. I usually hate flavored brews but this one is awesome. Buy a twelver and pass them around this Thanksgiving. Yum"
"This is the best fall seasonal out there, this beer simply kicks ass. Double the ABV of a usual pumpkin/fall seasonal and twice the taste. It's full of brown sugar taste and just the right amount of pumpkin taste. I wish this was available all year as it really is just a good well balanced beer. Not just my favorite pumpkin ale, but one of my favorite beers ever."
"Poured a clear amber with nice foamy light tan head. Good retention and lacing. Smells of pumpkin pie spice, light pumpkin, brown sugar, and pie dough. Tastes of brown sugar and cinnamon, doughy bread, pumpkin pie spice, pumpkin meat, and slight alcohol. Medium in body with good carbonation. Sweet and malty with good spiciness. A good pumpkin ale with not too much spice or pumpkin to detract from the other flavors, very well balanced. Not something I would drink all the time, but definitely among my favorite pumpkin ales out there."
"D - A decent beer, but those phenolic flavors were far too distracting for my taste. I'll probably have it again, but I won't seek it out."
"Drinkability: This is a very good pumpkin ale, as well as a very relaxing beer. You can definately sit back on a nice autumn day and enjoy this one. Just pour it in a glass, as it tastes better then drinking right from the bottle. If you like pumpkin ales, you won't regret checking this one out."
"D: Overall great pumpkin beer, but a little sweet for my taste. However, it is tasty."
"This beer poured a translucent copper with a fluffy single-finger off-copper head. The scent is very reminiscent of pumpkin pie, with some sweet pumpkin and spices. The taste starts off with some malty sweetness that fades into some pumpkin and spice in the middle, but just a little. The finish is surprisingly clean after a little bit of hops. The mouthfeel is a little watery, but the carbonation helps to add to that crispness. This is a very drinkable beer is a nice balance between beer and flavored beverage, with a hint of what it's got without being overpowering."
"Not a bad Pumpkin Ale at all. I liked how this Pumpkin Ale relied a little bit more on the pumpkin that on all of the spices. I wouldn't mind another one of these."
"D = A good drinkable pumpkin beer, great in the early Autumn."
"Cheers"
"Full disclosure: I ordinarily do not drink pumpkin ales. I've tried several over the years and have failed to understand what the big deal is. But I heard a lot of positive comments from several merchants and a few customers about this ale, so I decided to give it a shot."
"The drinkability is pretty good, but I would get tired of the pumpkin taste after 2 or so."
"Pours a nice orange/light brown hue. Head is about 1 & 1/2 finger. A very round and robust flavor, the first thing I notice is the sugary sweetness and spice flavors. The pumpkin flavor hits around 3rd I would say. Mouthfeel is borderline sticky but just enough that it's not bothersome. A very interesting beer, worth a try but not a beer you could consume in vast quantities, it's just too heavy for that."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Excellent mouthfeel. The alcohol is not overpowering and the beer finishes sticky, but not too thick. I think this is a fine seasonal beer that really hits the spot if you are in the mood for something different."
"Overall a very good brew, and hats off to DFH for tackling another offbeat unique brew."
"Notes: Wow this was good. I really enjoyed the balance of flavor and judicious spicing which gives it a great drinkability."
"Crystal clear amber with a fine head. No lacing. The aroma is sensational. Large whiff of spices, brown sugar and pumpkin. Considering the smell, the taste is a bit of a let down. The pumpkin and spice flavors (nutmeg, cinnamon, allspice) make a weak appearance in the flavor. The mouthfeel is characterized by a big alcohol blast. The 7% lets you know it's there in the medium-body brew, and there is a very dry finish. Overall, an enjoyable pumpkin ale that will do just fine for autumn."
"Great beer, love it!"
"D- like drinkin punkin pie. not my favorite style, but i dig this one."
"mouthfeel is of cream carbonation, loads of flavor, everything i would expect in a pumpkin ale plus more booze :D"
"Similarly, the mouthfeel is on the spicier, warmer end of things. The carbonation is relatively light, but that's after the soda-ish fizziness of the Buffalo Bill. Drinkability really only suffers because I just don't love flavored ales. This is a good beer, but I don't want more than one or two bottles of anything that tastes like a dessert than I don't eat outside of one day a year."
"D - As pumpkin beers go, this is certainly one of the best. Not surprisingly, the aroma is the strong point; the yeast and spices compliment each other nicely. The spices aren't overwhelming, but they don't let you forget what you are drinking. The astringency in the finish is unfortunate, but overall this is a fairly well balanced beer. Still, it is kind of difficult for a pumpkin beer to be very drinkable; I only need one of these."
"Mouthfeel is crisp and refreshing. Not much alcohol burn or warmth. And no bad aftertaste."
"Verdict: While Pumpkin Ales are nothing new, I knew when I saw the neon orange pack adorned with the shark icon sitting on the shelf, I'd be in for something special. Punkin did not disappoint. Without a doubt, this is the best Pumpkin themed beer I've ever tasted. As I've come to expect from Dogfish, this beer is lavish, complex, and above all, unique. These are the kinds of beers that leave such an indelible impression on me that I can almost summon their taste just by thinking about them. Brilliant."
"Drinkability: Wouldn't buy this one again."
"D: I had this after Shipyard (which was a little """lagery""") so I'll take another run at this one. that said, seemed to grow tired of it quickly due to the pumpkin and slices; it needed something in balance. It too, like the Shipyard, was amply carbonated so a bit filling on that front too."
"overall, an excellent pumpkin beer, my favorite to date, something to look forward to when the leaves begin to change!"
"I am glad I tried this one before I bought it, and I will pass this one up in the future in favor of better pumpkin beers."
"Picked this up as a single for something different. Pours an orange amber color with a small off white head that quickly disappears. Smells of pumpkin, spices, cinnamon and nutmeg. Medium body, nice carbonation and a little on the sweet side. The taste is pumpkin and spices. Pumpkin pie in a bottle. I wasn't crazy about this one but certainly worth a try."
"Poured from bottle to pint a deep orange/amber color with a minimal off-white head and nice lacing throughout. Smells of cinnamon and nutmeg like pumpkin pie. Tastes malty up front with sweet cinnamon and spices and a late alcohol bite. Goes down smooth despite heavy spice flavors, has mild carbonation and almost creamy texture that finishes crisp. I would recommend this since I enjoyed it but I could not envision drinking alot of these."
"Very low drinkability; an interesting brew but excessively sweet."
"One of the better pumpkin beers out there. The nose is really sweet, but the taste is more dry and spice-like. This beer definitely makes you think of Halloween as you drink it...Trick or Treat for adults!"
"deep clear amber with an off-white diminishing head and a slight chill haze. aroma and taste can be summed up simply: pumpkin pie. the moderate caramel malt sweetness leads to a spicy almost-drying finish. light, creamy carbonation and a somewhat viscous. medium-bodied. this will be great with holiday meals. a must-try fall seasonal."
"D: Not bad for a gimmick beer. I didn't really detect any pumpkin, but it was pleasant enough."
"Very tasty and interesting brew. Tastes like a beer with some pumpkin pie-like spices more than a pumpkin beer, which I like. Drinkable but very sweet so I could maybe do 2 in one sitting."
"Notes: Not bad, but becomes a chore to drink after a while due to the excessive spicing."
"The best pumpkin beer I've had. Not cloying or spice overdosed like some others. This is pure pumpkin pie in a bottle. It's not something I'd drink more than a couple of times a year but with the holidays approaching quickly, I'm saving a couple of bottles."
"v: oz1 al3 3.175"
"A strange brew indeed that misses the mark in my opinion of what a pumpkin ale should be. No balance whatsoever and had to drain pour. Interesting, many of the DFH unique brews go this unbalanced route for me since the DFH 90 Minute is so fantastic. Seems like the beer was trying to do to much. Still waiting for another showstopper from DFH besides 90."
"With all of the spices in this one, I would have to limit myself to one or two of these. While they are a nice offering, the spices would get to me after a while."
"Overall: Almost more like a spice amber ale than a true seasonal pumpkin ale. Worth a try but not spectacular."
"Certainly the tastiest example of the style that I've ever had. Flavor is complex and satisfying. A nice brew for a cool fall day. Would probably match well with a Thanksgiving dinner. Yet again, Dogfish Head proves itself as a great brewery."
"Much better than that skank pumkin from Flavor of Love, you know, the one that spit on New York..."
"D: Fairly drinkable, but only one of these gets the job done for me. A nice after dinner beer interesting use of spices. Not a bad beer, but one was good for me."
"Bottle / Artwork - Standard Dogfish Head bottle... Nothing out of the unusual here..."
"I poured a 12 ounce bottle into a pint glass. The beer is a nice shade of orange, decent head, decent lacing. The smell is mild pumpkin pie spice. The taste follows-mild cinnamon, mild clove, faint pumpkin. The beer is light bodied, and somewhat heavily carbonated. The beer is pretty drinkable. A solid beer overall, but not my favorite style."
"D: Its yummy but not the best of the pumpkin beer lot. 7% is a bit high for drinking more than a couple on halloween. I like a pumpkin beer I can chill with while passing out candy on the front porch. Could be tasty with fall foods like turkey and mashed potatoes."
"The taste is quite substantial, probably the highest ABV pumpkin I have had, and not loads of carbonation or efforvesence. The beer is not well carbonated, a bit syrupy, and quite good. The taste is a nice melange of pumpkin, allspice, nutmeg, vanilla, and some hop presence underneath. The beer is a bit crisp, not much maltiness popping through, and a nice flowery hop emerging towards the finish. This is a very nice pumpking ale, although there is a bit more alcohol presence and residual ABV throatiness than I would have cared for. Worth seeking out. L'Chaim."
"D- i could pound these back and not even think twice about stopping. this would be a good case of beer to take tailgating."
"Smells of pumpkin pie spices and tastes the same. The beer is well built. Not a half-ass piece of crap like that Buffalo Bills garbage. Mouthfeel is fairly thick, and complements the sweet, spiced pumpkin flavor very well. Carbonation is fairly pronounced. Can't drink too much though, or I'd get sick."
"Yet another solid offering from Dogfish. One of the better pumpkin ales I've had."
"Reviewed on: 09-18-2008 1:10 am"
"Overall I was very happy with this beer. I was hesitant to spend as much as it cost on a 4-pack when so many other pumpkin ales were out there, but I'm glad I did. Be sure to give this one a try."
"In the past, I haven't been a huge fan of pumpkin beers, probably because they tend to lack much character and rely too heavily on the spices. Punkin Ale, on the other hand, is a tasty, well-balanced beer that I'll definitely seek out each fall."
"M/D - Medium to full boided and very creamy smooth. Fun fall beer and very drinkable."
"Drinkability- I really enjoyed this beer. It may not be what I expected in terms of pumpkin but it was still a fantastic brew. Perhaps I just need to get another bottle and give it another try!!"
"drinkability is very good for a 7% beer the alcohol is hidden very well ..great session beer"
"Overall, I like a pumpkin beer to be a little sweeter. If you don't like the sweetness of a lot of other pumpkin beers, this is for you. It has a lot of carbonation and a nice strong flavor. Not bad, but I prefer some other pumpkin beers to this."
"D- I've had much better pumpkin ales such as Night Owl from Elysian."
"Deep golden brown with thin head and little lacing. Nose feqatures pleasant level of pumpkin spice and a little ginger. Taste is a perfect balance of spice, acidity and malt. Mouthfeel is average but the drinkability is killer particularly considering the style again due to the balance."
"D: For a seasonal, this is quite good. I could drink a few :)"
"This is what all pumpkin ales should aspire to be. An absolutely delicious beverage, fit for those who don't even like """beer.""" I love this stuff."
"d. At 7% its a bit heavy, though the alcohol is not really noticable. Easy drinking, and am glad I had the oppurtunity."
"Punkin' Out."
"Served in a becker. Poured a brilliant translucent copper with a 1.5 inch frothy white head; good retention. Some watery lacing, but weak legs. Nose presents with cinnamon and nutmeg on a malty backbone. Pumpkin flavors revealed in the taste. Essentially, this brew is pumpkin pie in a bottle; enough said. Mouthfeel is between light and medium. Some carbonation present, but a pleasant creaminess comes forth in the middle. Good drinkability for the style. Flavors are not overbearing, but not a beer you would want to drink more than one or two of in a sittng."
"This is one of the best pumpkin beers I have had to date. Good job dogfish head. This would go great with holiday dinner or on a nice fall or winter day."
"A four pack is enough. I look forward to trying next years release however."
"I'll get more and I'm upset I only bought one bottle to try."
"Mouthfeel is clean and smooth...this is a very drinkable beer. Another winner from DFH, and I think I'll be picking up more of this in the future."
"Smells right off the bat like pumpkin pie and brown ale. """Very nice", as Borat would say. I had this brew last year and didn't much care for it. This year I am proud to say that I have come around on the Punkin ale, and feel confident to give it a definite thumb's up. This beer was top notch all the way. Good color off the start, with a rusty orange and creamy head. There was a lot of lacing inside that glass, which in my humble is the sign of a top quality beer. The beer was full of pumpkin spices, but the aroma isn't as powerful as the taste. The taste is full of a mix of pumpkin, pumpkin spices and that of a full brown ale. This is definitely a keeper...kudos to Dogfish Head!"
"D: A little on the bigger side, and that's okay. It's somewhere between gratuitous gulping and mindful sipping, and I can work with that. While I commend DFH for their experimentation and willingness to try unusual things, I find their brews to be rather touch and go to my palate. This is a fine example of an experiment that went the right way. Recommended drinking."
"Overall, this is a lighter-style ale for the ABV and the spices really come through."
"This is not my thing, but I think it's a pretty good idea - to ramp up the usual fall seasonal. It's nice and smooth and full, pretty impressive accomplishment even if I don't love all the spicing. That's not their fault but mine, so kudos to DFH (again)."
"D- For such a potent brew I could see myself drinking more than one of these in a night if I didn't have such a great selection"
"Could drink this a few more times, only in the season though."
"D - Killer autumn beer. Honestly this is probably the best pumpkin beer that I've ever had. Damn fine stuff from a damn fine brewery."
"D: This is a very drinkable beer. I would have liked something a little heavier, richer, and creamier. However, I will probably grab some more and throw on some Misfits or Samhain and celebrate the upcoming Halloween season. Compared to the couple others (of this genre I have tried) it is still a great beer that is well worth the time."
"Easily the best pumpkin beer I have gotten to try. The pumpkin flavors are present but don't make the beer not taste like beer."
"Only one or two of these a night for me, couldn't drink the bar closed on these."
"I always get excited by the delicious sound of a Pumpkin Ale, but my expectations are NEVER met. This comes as close as any to that flavorful imagined prototype."
"Alright so I had to even criticize this one because it really smells and tastes great. Pours a dark reddish-coppery color with no haze whatsoever. It smells and tastes just like a pumpkin pie and is delicious--no doubt about it. HOWEVER, I really wish that the thing would have a heavier body. It felt pretty thin in the mouth and going down, and I really like a holiday/spiced ale that you've gotta chew on. If they could do this without jeopardizing any other features of the brew, it would be perfect. Delicious nonetheless though and I'll definitely have it again!"
"Heavy carbonation led to a receeding two-finger head that sat on top of a transparent, auburn gold. I thought the actual pumpkin smell itself was mild, but there was a good sweet smell of cinnamon and brown sugar. A great pumpkin taste describes this beer, with a real smooth, creamy body. Mix in some cinnamon and nutmeg for a spicy kick and the sugar for some sweetness. Don't forget the spicy, crisp dry backbite from the hops that complemented this beer. My only problem was its lightness and great taste; I drank it too fast. A possible second to ST's Pumpking...still a grat pumpkin beer."
"Copper with an orange glow, poured from the bottle into a chalice. Light lacing. Nice cinnamon aromatic, fresh vegetal hops in the nose. Nutmeg, cinnamon, squash and raisin follow through the palate, surprisingly low in carbonation, but the bite of the hops on the palate enough to keep the finish nice and fresh. One of my favorite fall seasonals."
"D- I was craving a beer that would make me feel like it is becoming fall outside. It is otherwise hard to believe that in the 90 degree weather we are having still. However, on a rainy day, this beer hit the spot. I enjoy it for what it is and would like to try to invent my own brew of this style someday soon."
"A beautiful beer that's also great to drink - this may be my favorite Dogfish beer to date."
"A super satisfying beer, best pumpkin beer I've had by a long shot. I loved it. Should have got a sixer. Spices kind of take over and linger - one of these at a time is enough."
"The appearnace on 1st pour was a dark amber color with a good head . The aroma was full of malt and pumpkin pie spice and something extra maybe pumpkin . The taste is great with a mix of malt and spices . The finish kind of lingures inviting another sip . The body is not as heavy as I thought it might be with the pumpkin in it but it is very smooth . An excellent 1st pumpkin beer of the year ."
"D- A great brew and easy to drink. The only thing that maybe holding this one back is its sweetness but it would be easy to drink one or two."
"D: A well balanced seasonal beer. If you enjoy pumpkin pie and pumpkin flavors, this is one of the best ale's I have had."
"This is the first pumpkin ale I have ever had, and I don't see how one could get much better. Definitely one of my new fall favorites, with high taste and high drinkability."
"The flavor showcases the spice mix well, and I swear I do realy taste pumpkin. The allspice and nutmeg do a great job stimulating the palate with a spicy tingle. Caramel flavor but not very sweet, with just enough hoppy bitterness in the finish to make this more drinakble than your standard holiday niche beer. This one is definitely a winner for holiday meals or with that pumpkin pie. Probably the best pumpkin beer I have had, good job."
"A very palatable beer, but one that only seems right during the fall months. Festive nose and taste make a great Halloween beer. This one can get me in the spirit to decorate the house like a graveyard but more important it's a sign of the great fall and winter beers to come. Awesome."
"Found it at Amity Wine in New Haven, CT."
"Mouthfeel was stingy and watery. Very one-dimensional. Won't get this one again."
"D: Definitely drinkable, can't wait until the weather turns colder in Texas so I can have this fine ale on the patio with the cool fall air blowing."
"Certainly not a session beer, or even something that I would buy many other times of the year if it was available, but quite delicious. I definitely will be buying this one again next year!"
"D -It's really a unique beer with big pumpkin pie characteristics. Dunno if I could make this a session beer, but I will have another!"
"Overall It won me over. Happy Halloween"
" Smooth and creamy, wonderfully drinkable. Medium body with appropriate carbonation. The best pumpkin ale I have yet to have."
"Ahhh I'm so happy for this as the fall approaches. My favourite season tends to coincide with the release of amazing seasonal brews. Pours a deep, amberish colour with a thick head that disappeared quickly. The smell is the best part. Spicy, cinnamony, warm. It embodies the fall to me. The taste is much the same. Some people trying this with me found it to be too spicy and thought it was an odd flavour for a beer. I think it's great. Regardless of the slight bitterness, it goes down smooth. I recommend this highly , but I will admit that perhaps I am romantacizing a beer too much."
"Punkin is technically a good beer, but I'm not so sure I go back to it. Even though I could not taste much of the alcohol, it hit my by the end. Certainly not a chore to finish, but does not inspire repeat visits."
"Poured out of the bottle and into my glassware a brown amber with a foamy, slightly yellow head. Nice retention of the cap and good lacing in bands. Slightly sweet aromas of pumpkin, nutmeg and all spice. Classical brown ale flavors highlighted with a pumpkin twist! Pumpkin first, then toasted malt followed by nutmeg, allspice and cinnamon all at once. Bitter malty finish reminiscent of raw (unsweetened) pumpkin. Rich and creamy mouthfeel, medium bodied and lively carbonation. A great example of the style and worth tracking down if you like pumpkin ales or something different."
"I suggest aging this beer 9-10 months as I had. I really don't remember enjoying it this much when it was fresh."
"Pours a dark amber color with a decent head with good retenton. Smells of light pumpkin pie, all spice, nutmeg, but not too overpowering at all. Some hop spice in the aroma as well. Tastes of maltiness, all spice, nutmeg, and once again not too overpowering on the spiciness and pumpkin flavors. It's all really kind of """meh""" to me, to be honest. I don't get what the big deal is with this beer, and never have. Mouthfeel has lots of carbonation, medium bodied, and crisp finish. One is enough for me on this one."
"This beer is awesome. A dark orange color, with a head that lingers for a few seconds. You can smell and taste exactly what they tell you is on the label, cinnamon, brown sugar, allspice, nutmeg and pumpkin. Has a very nice malty aftertaste. Did I mention this beer is awesome? Probably tough to drink 5-6 in a nite (has a slight """heavy""" feeling to it). This beer is autum. Enjoy it while supplies last."
"pours up a dark pumpkinny orange color with a thin off-white head. a very warm color. good lacing. the nose is nutmeg!, pumpkin, spices, and sweet malts. the label is true to the taste. pumpkin, brown sugar, cinnamon, the works. also some sweet malts and crisp hops. medium body, medium carbo. I put this Fall time beer up there with Avery Twelve"
"the one negative i had was tasting the alcohol. its high and 7% but other beers i have had have a fuller flavor that covers the high abv. but this doesnt take away from the positives that make this a very yummy seasonal beer."
"D: Autumnal perfection."
"Looking forward to stocking this one for the holidays."
"D: Had a 12oz pour of this and that was fine. I love my Pumpkin Ales and this is a good one. Had a bottle this year and it was a little bit better."
"Everything about this beer just screams pumpkin. That word itself could really be the entire review. The beer is the color of a pumpkin (orange.. if you haven't seen a pumpkin) with a light white head. Aromas of pumpkin along with some light toasty malts. The hops kick in nicely in the flavor along with the- you guessed it- pumpkin, adding a little crispness and spicyness. The mouthfeel has a nice medium body. The alcohol isn't overly perceptible in the taste but after drinking half a bottle I could already feel it at work. The brown sugar offers a nice nutty complement to the pumpkin as well. This beer doesn't go overboard in any direction (ie pumpkin pieness) and I'd almost appreciate it if there was slightly less alcohol so I could drink more of them in sort of an Oktoberfesty/Fall kind of spirit, but overall was very pleased."
"The smell, flavor, mouthfeel is the epitamy of anything that is marketed as a """pumpkin ale""". This is fantastically flavorfull, balanced and extremely drinkable. Another classic from my favorite American brewery."
"This is only the second Pumpkin Ale that I have tried so far but it is very good. One of the better ones I've tried from DFH."
"One of the better Pumpkin ales out there on the market... Definitely a step-above from your average..."
"DFH punkin is easily one of the better pumpkin ales I've tried and leaves me wanting to have another. Some pumpkin beers strive for straight up pumpkin flavor, some for pumpkin pie, and this fits the latter quite well. Well done DFH!"
"Pours a nice reddish-copper color with ample head retention. The smell is mostly of spices. Reminds me of a candle store/gift shop in the fall. Taste is quite spicy. I was expecting this to taste like carbonated pumpkin juice, but there really isn't a whole lot of pumpkin flavor jumping out at you. It's nice, spicy will a hint of pumpkin in the background. Pumpkin is much more noticeable in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is smooth. Drinkability is great. I wasn't sure if I was going to like this much, since I've had bad experiences with blueberry flavored beers. But this was a nice surprise. It's not an overwhelming pumpkin flavor. There's just enough there to make it enjoyable. This would be great for a fall party, or even Thanksgiving dinner."
"Pours a nice golden orange with a thin white head. Not much retention,and just a bit of laceing. Aroma is of sugar,spices and pumpkin. Body is light to medium and carbonated. Taste is rich pumpkin up front with a spicey finish.Hints of brown sugar through out. One of the best."
"I like pumpkin ales, and this is a very solid one, even if drinking in August seems premature. Classic pumpkin ale appearance - orange body, bubbly white head and some lacing. Aroma is spot on - pumpkin and cinnamon with some sweetness. The taste is on the money too, again the pumpkin pulls through with the cinnamon, some nutmeg and brown sugar. The alcohol is extremely well-hidden. Smooth mouthfeel. Seems like the sort of beer that you would enjoy it the more you had, and one of the few pumpkin ales I would have outside of the season. 7% is damn dangerous though!"
"D: High simply because it is sooo delicious...Fall is my new favorite time of the year!"
"Although it is only mid August, I was pleasantly surprised to see that the Punkin Ale was out for sale. You would not know that this drink is 7% as it maintained its pumpkin and cinnamon taste throughout with no harsh after bite. A very enjoyable beer. One could easily drink a few of these."
"Overall it's a very enjoyable beer that goes nicely with a pizza, although alone it might be hard to drink as a session beer."
"D: Drinkability was fairly good per style considering its high ABV and spiced herb nature. Can drink one or two of these, but pretty pricey per four pack. Share this with friends around a campfire on a chilly October night."
"Upon post-drink consideration, I think this beer was going to be on the verge of going bad. I got it before it went and I'm glad I did. Excellent beer."
"This one grew on me with each sip; what seemed at first like a nice novelty had by the end of the glass become something I could see enjoying on a regular basis. Nicely done."
"Body is an orange amber in color that doesnt much resemble a """brown ale""". Head settles to an inch of light tan fading to a skim in a couple of minutes leaving no lace. Nose instantly noticeable with pumpkin and spice such as coriander and raw veggies. And then there is the taste that is very pleasant. Depth and complexity that I havent come to expect from pumpking beers. Bold mineral based richness up front with a nice hop feel to balance. Slightly carmalized malt teams with the spicey pumpkin tones that is present throughout this beer. The mouthfeel is a rich raw pumpkin and spicey veggie feel. This is excetionally drinkable for the style. One of the best pumpkin beers I've had."
"Taste is less spicy and more malty than the aroma suggests, fairly balanced when it comes to the spice but in a way it seems rather bland when compared to other DFH products."
"T: Medium bodied, creamy, with high carbonation. Like the smell, it tastes like pumpkin pie in a glass, but not in a bad way. Strong malt body, biscuit like and slightly dry. I'm a little late in reviewing this beer and it isn't nearly as good as it was fresh so I'm not letting that affect my score. This was slightly more sweet and less dry fresh. Still a good beer, but not for sitting around. However, the 7% is still very noticeable as it was fresh and the beer still tastes slightly hot in the throat. All in all, my favorite pumpkin beer."
"stingy dash of pumpkin pie spice."
"Decently hoppy for the level of spiciness that it has. Overall a very flavorful beer. Even though it is 7%, this could be very sessionable on a brisk fall day. Can't wait til next years'!"
"One of my perennial favorite pumpkin ales, although it might be too spicy for some. I find this recipe sublime, beginning with the smoky and woody nose. The taste of pumpkin is subtle, not too sweet, before handing it over to the cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice. Conjures up images of autumn leaves, a roaring fire, and hot homemade pie."
"Pours an orangish brown with nice off white head, some good lacing, pretty nice look to it. The aroma is kind of shy, but some very nice spices pop out, pumpkin obviously in there too. The taste is much better, the spices even more tasty, the pumpkin more dominant, and the malt base coming out more, maybe just a hint of hops toward the end. The mouth is pretty nicely carbonated, decent body, overall pretty nice. Can't say this is my favorite style, not by a long shot, but this seems to be the most authentic shot at the style I've had in a while, and thus a good beer to try in my book."
"D - A good easy drinkable beer in the fall."
"Pours crystal clear amber with a hint of orange and a crème head that falls quickly. Nose is of very muted pumpkins and some very mild spices. Smells more like pumpkin pie, but really subdued to the point that it is almost non-existent. Flavor is smooth with brown ale attributes and a gentle amount of pumpkin and spices mixed in. Smooth, yes. Just not very eventful really. Feel has a mass of big bubbles of carbonation hitting the mouth and the liquid feels good too. Very drinkable overall. As easy drinking a pumpkin ale as you are going to find."
"Crystal clear and light brown. Big white head with big pillowy bubbles in it. No head retention to speak of though. Smell of ginger and a bit of pumpkin. Taste of pumpkin pie and beer blended together. No carbonation to speak of, and medium body. Not something I would ever buy again, but worth trying once."
"D - All day. I love this beer. I wish it was available year round."
"Living in Michigan and loving to grill and be outside as much as possible, the fall is the last hurrah to be outside before massive amounts of snow set in. Fall also brings with it a plethora of seasonal beers including pumpkin beers. I've had many pumpkin beers and have been disappointed with each of them, however, this one is a different story. The clear pumpkin color of the ale coupled with the intense pumpkin pie aroma is a world apart from other pumpkin brews. The taste is complex - spicy, sweet, and and roasted like a piece of pumpkin pie. The mouthfeel is well carbonated and well suited to this style. Easy drinking as a dessert beer or as a reminder of why fall isn't such a bad thing. Highly recommended."
"Drinkability: This is a first rate pumpkin ale. Dogfish Head proves they can make an excellent beer, with out having to go to extremes."
"Notes: Not too bad of a pumpkin beer. I'm glad they didn't go overboard with the spices like a lot of other breweries do. The base of the beer is nice. Would be easier to drink if the alcohol wasn't so high."
"Overall, one of the most well-done pumpkin beers I've had. Nothing is over the top, and it fits the style dead on."
"Pours quite orange, little head dissipates quickly, light aroma of spices and caramel malts, flavors resemble a pumkin pie without being cloying and sweet, fairly balanced beer for a spiced ale, not overwhelming."
"D - this is a bit sweet, but I could totally have 2 of these. When it was on tap at BSP I would order at least one usually. By far the best pumpkin beer I've had (though I haven't had that many). Recommended if you're looking for a pumpkin beer despite the season being nearly over."
"Drinkability - this is a decent beer, but I'd want something different after two of these in a session, but then maybe this would go better with dessert."
"Pours a nearly brilliant golden-orange in color, topped with a one-fingered medium tan head and decent lacing. Nose is spicy, lightly boozy, and lightly tangy-sweet; inclusion of brown sugar is evident. My impressions on the first sip are of a sweet, smooth, and moderately full-bodied brew. Punchy . . . definitely wears its 7% with style. Light notes of cherry and angelfood cake, and even a lightly-spiced 'plain cake donut' - very nice. Mouthfeel is smooth and lightly tangy, lightly warming from the higher alcohol, and with remarkably good drinkability. Leans toward a dessert beer but I could easily knock back a few of these. This is the biggest Pumpkin brew (ale or otherwise) I've ever sampled, and yet it has remarkable balance, even to the point of a drier finish than I'd first expected. I'd say that this one might win over a few of the people who haven't yet warmed to the Pumkin-in-a-beer crowd, as it really brings everything together nicely."
"The pumpkin and spice taste is really upfront in this medium body brew when it hits the mouth. The cinnamon lingers a bit when the malt kicks in and everything finishes with a dry & hoppy bitterness. The taste of alcohol is pretty much all over it from start to finish. Not too overbearing but there's no denying that it's there. The better half said she liked it but had her thinking that someone tipped a little bit of a nut brown ale into the pie batter. I can't say that I've ever, that I recall at least, thought about having a doughnut or a bowl of ice cream with a beer before but entertained the idea while drinking this."
"This beer gets better as warms and is my favorite pumpkin ale of the season. Easy to drink and enjoy. Well done, DFH."
"Poured a rusty golden orange with a 1/2 finger head. The smell was predictable: spice, especially nutmeg and close, and pumpkin pie (both the pie filling and the bready crust). The taste was delicious and well balanced. Obviously, you have your spice, again with nutmeg and clove, but maybe some cinnamon in there, plenty of sweet caramel malts, but also a tangy, dry finish to provide the slightest bit of bitterness at the end. I'm a big fan of pumpkin ales, I always look forward to the fall, and I think this is one of my favorite examples of the style. It's certainly more complex, and much less over-the-top-sweet, as many of the other pumpkins out there."
"D - Nice seasonal for the autumn months. Don't know if I could drink these all night, but I'd definitely pick up a 4-pack of these next fall."
"Drinkability- I had big hopes for this one but its not the best Pumpkin Ale Ive had. Its tasty but a bit cloying and I really wish there was more spice in the taste. The nose was fantastic though and I wish it tasted like it smelled. Thanks again to YonderWonderer!"
"A very nice Pumpkin Ale. Not the prettiest or best I've had, but a very nice one. This would be a great sipper during the chill of Autumn as well as would be nice with some cheddar or some lively Mediterranean rim fare. I'd definitely make this a part of my Autumnal beer enjoyment. Definitely recommended if you like a nice spiced ale."
"I would have rated even higher, but the finish seemed short and a little stale. Overall, though, a nice twist, and even though Im not much of a fan of Herb-Vegetable beers, this was an enjoyable offering from DFH."
" The pumkin taste resided on my pallette long after the beer was done, and alothough it was quite a heavy and layered beer, I would'nt hesitate to have one or two more. It was truly a well done beer in perfect balance and in overall craft."
"D. All and all a great beer. Very drinkable, though I dont know if I could drink more then 2 at anygiving setting."
"D - The 7% ABV comes through a bit too much ere and kills the flavor party. Wouldn't be able to polish off more then one of these."
"Overall- Though I like some overly-spiced versions of the style, this one was a pleasant surprise. It kept the integrity of the base beer while the pumpkin and spice made for additional flavor."
"The Punkin' Ale seems to be one of those beers that I try and try with each year to love and it just never happens. Just way too over spiced with not enough pumpkin and a unnecessaryly high 7% ABV make this a one time a fall beer for me. If they want to keep the high ABV, they should make this an Imperial style and ramp up the flavor too."
"Another excellent fall installment from the brewers at Dogfish Head. I had a chance to sample some of the first batches this summer at the Milton brewery, but it never tasted better as it does at the end of the line and out of my fridge on this Halloween night. Almost makes me want to sip another and wait for the Great Pumpkin."
"if you are a big fan of pumpkin and allspice im sure you could session this beer, but i think it needs more of a cinnamon and nutmeg flavor to be a fall/winter choice for me."
"Note to Self: Ranked #16 Pumpkin Ale when I tried it"
" So to the beer. Good color, nice dark brown sugar color with decent glass lacing. hints of brown sugar, molassess and cloves in the nose. The beer, folks, is nuanced. It will not give you the pumpkin pie effect, more the effect is a good hoppy ale giving credence to the season and time. The pumpkin taste as well as aroma is subtle and is meant to be subtle to compliment the hops character. I find that this exudes a great balanace to this beer. I wonder what the hops are? still have not been able to figure that out because that is subtle as well but definitely presistant present. Look at this beer as a hopped brown ale with pumpkin overtones that. i feel, are consistenlty present from first sip through taste and finish. If you can approach that way and like hops, you will defintely enjoy this beer. This is the perfect beer to enjoy raking leaves or chopping wood. In my house, this is one of our standard thanksgiving fare. Great beer. Enjoy and thanks to Dogfish for keeping it a bit off center but still wonderfully excellent."
"I think that it's a good beer to drink, and will drink the 4 no problem, but not worth the money I would say.. I enjoy their other beers much more."
"The departure from the 12 ounce bottle produces a clear copper color with a stupendous off white creamy head that last longer than the energizer bunny, lacing is a solid sheet, which circumnavigates the glass. Nose is sweet with Pumpkin and spices like cinnamon and ginger and a touch of vanilla, quite a treat for the old schnozzle. Start has a nice pumpkin and malt sweetness, light bitterness at the back, top is light to medium in feel. Finish continues the sweet malt and spicy taste, the acidity plausible, aftertaste sweet and tart, a fine beer."
"D: Yummy, but. It's rich, and alcohol is a little heavy at 7 percent (not that you'd notice from a taste); a couple in one sitting is plenty for me. Still, as far as I'm concerned, this is the gold standard for pumpkin beer."
"Rest is all disappointing, aroma is of weak pumpkin and clove. Taste trys to make it, but lacks any real commitment to the Punk. This is just a brown with some spices thrown in. And an average pumpkin, but for the freaking high dollar cost ($13 a four pack)  the drinkability really lacks. Local beers at a lot better cost whip this ones ass."
"Pours a dark copper color with only a thin lace of head. Carbonation seems on the light side. Aroma is quite strong, I could smell it when it was sitting on the table, but has a pleasant clover and nutmeg aroma. I can sense nutmeg and cinnamon in the taste with a little pumpkin. Mouthfeel is highly carbonation, but still goes the the throat quite smooth and has a bitter aftertaste. This is one of the better pumpkin ales I've tried."
"d: far more balanced than the average punkin. the balance of the spices, pumpkin and malt make this one of the most drinkable pumpkin beers I have tried. I would reccomend it to fans of the variety."
"Drinkability: this is becoming a fall favorite for me. Even with summer still hanging on here in the south, this reminds me that cooler weather is on the way."
"D- I feel done after only a few sips. Not a drinkable brew by any means but not hard to get down."
"Poured the 12 oz. bottle into a brandy snifter. Poured with a fairly small head which settled quickly. Nice clear amber, slight brown color. It definetly had various aromas associated with pumpkin...cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg, along with a noticeable yeast aroma. Good flavors but the pumpkin qualities seemed to be clashing with the malt and hop flavors. A real pumpkin flavor was noticed in the aftertaste however. Nice body with adequate carbonation. Quite drinkable, no major complaints."
"Brew pored to a amber color with a smallish medium tan head that had retention through half of the beer but left no real lacing to speak of. The aromas are nice, possible because I have had a number of other Pumpkin brews this one does not seem to be in your face. The aromas are of your typical spices, nutmeg, cinnamon, brown sugar and some caramel. The taste is very smooth, again no one flavor is really sticking out but seems to have a nice marriage of flavors. Those flavors are similar to the aroma but I think a malty caramel backbone sticks out. The spices seem to be nutmeg, allspice, cinnamon, and pumpkin flavors. Over all this is a nice drinking brew, and at 7% I do not notice an alcohol flavor. This is one of the best Pumpkin brews I have had to date."
"D- A great example of the style. This was the first pumpkin beer I ever had, and it holds a somewhat special place in my heart."
"The taste perked me up a bit, as this """punk""" hit fairly hard for its style with a sweet, spicey body with a touch of alcohol, bitter hops, and lots of spice. The mouthfeel was dry, salty, and crisp across the palate with a nice bitter bite on the finish. It begins to really smooth out once the carbonation level drops. This is not a beer I'd look to buy again anytime soon, but the complexity is there. For its style, it's decent, but there are better pumpkin ales around."
"D - Best pumpkin beer Ive ever had, look forward to many more. Bought as part of a sample pack otherwise I would have easily been able to drink several even though a bit stronger than most pumpkins."
"Overall, this is the best pumpkin beer I have tried this season."
"This is the best of the """punkin'""" ales out there that I've tried. Not to mention the good buzz (7% per bottle). The only down is that in my area the cost is $8.99. If it came in a six-pack (it only comes in four; might be because of alcohol content laws in TX) the price would make it easier to have around the house more often."
"Not nearly as good as Southern Tier's Imperial Pumking or Weyerbacker's Imperial Pumpkin Ale, but better than many I've had. Certainly worth a try this autumn."
"Overall: Thanks HimerMan for sending me this beer. I am glad to have tried it. While not my favorite Dogfish Head beer, or my favorite pumpkin ale, I still liked this one."
"A great chilly fall day beer, without a doubt the best pumpkin beer I've ever had"
"O: It's a decent pumpkin ale, but I just can't force myself to have more than one in a sitting with all the spice."
"Beer pours a nice orange/brown and keeps a longlasting head of 1/4""" or so. The smell is a slight pumpkin with some cinnamon and nutmeg, pretty subtle. Not much hops, if at all. The taste was nice and smooth with no discernible aftertaste. There was a slight pumpkin flavor along with toasted malt. This beer felt goo in the mouth and had enough carbonation. A very drinkable seasonal beer."
"This is the best pumpkin ale I have had yet. I had almost given up on this style... almost. I would recommend this beer to someone who hasn't had a pumpkin ale before. Dogfish Head certainly knows how to keep it interesting."
"Pour a coppery brown with almost no head or lacing. All the smells advertised on the bottle came through: cinnamon, nutmeg, pumpkin (although not as much pumpkin as i was expecting). The taste was dominated by the spices with little pumpkin coming through. The maltiness was cut slightly by the bitterness of hops coming through. One of the high points of this beer was the smooth mouthfeel. The dominance of the spices hurt the drinkability of this beer for me."
"Bottle. Coppery brown pour, very lttle head retention. Aroma promised pumpkin, sugar spices, cinnamon. Flavor did not fully deliver. Slight pumpkin, sugar, some cinnamon. I felt it needed a little more of each of those flavors to really pull it off. Wife seemed to like it more than me."
"One of my favorite pumpkin beers. I really like the brown ale base, and the balance of sweeet, hoppy, pumpkin and spice. Pours copper with a thin head and not much lacing. Smells like pumpkin pie spices foremost, then fresh pumpkin and cream. Cinammon and nutmeg are predominant in the spicing. Taste is similar, but with the taste of earthy bitter hops added to the mix and running from start to finish. Spicy and creamy as well, and quite satisfying. Mouthfeel is full, creamy, and spicy and generally heftier than most of the other pumpkin beers out there. Delicious."
"Overall, not too shabby for a pumpkin ale. For the most part, this seems more like a pumpkin-tinged fall seasonal lager, but who am I to judge. If you're in the mood to try a pumpkin beer, this one's worth a look."
"D: A very drinkable pumpkin ale, with great complexity that doesn't get too out of hand; everything remains rather mild so as to be enjoyable. I could definitely see ordering a couple of these as the nights get cooler."
"It's hard to drink this beer without thinking about autumn. The flavors blend seamlessly, creating one of the elite brews of this style. Well done DFH."
"Solid beer from Dogfish Head. The longer this one sits out of the fridge the better it smells and tastes. I'd guess it's between 52-55 right now and it's tasting pretty good. Interesting pumpkin ale."
"This sure is a pretty drinkable pumpkin. Sturdy enough that you'll want to sip it, rich enough to reward your patience, yet tasty enough that you'll want another when it gone."
"The punkin comes in plain artistic label with a freshness date on the side. It pours a dark orange color, a little hazy, with lacing that follows the down the glass as you drink her. The aroma is very apparent when poured in the glass. Right away you smell a pumpkin pie. The cinnamon and nutmeg really jumped out with a brown sugar in the background. To me it was a complex beverage with a little hopiness with some esters going up my nose. The mouth is was pretty thin with a little carbonation. I would buy a six pack of this brew even though it comes from across the nation."
"Toasty amber malt, caramel, nutmeg and other spices. Mild level of acidity, but fairly average lager feel. Medium bodied with a good level of carbonation. Not overly sweet, one or two would be my limit due to the spice. One of the better pumpkin ales that's more widely available."
"Pours a rusty copper hue with a one finger white head that quickly dies down to just about nothing. No stickiness or lacing any where to speak of. Smell is of cinnamon and not enought pumpking. Lots of clove and nutmeg as well. I think the spices are a bit over the top and lack the pumpkin smell. Taste starts with an interesting creamy hop flavor with all the spices mentioned earlier. I really enjoy the hoppiness to this beer, but the flavors seem too artificial to me and a bit overpowering. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation, a bit too much actually. Just had the Pumpking from Southern Tier and Punkin' doesnt even compare to it. I put a 22 oz. Pumpking down easier than a 12 oz. Punkin'. This one is just kind of """meh""" for me."
"Tasted just like it smelled, with a bit more fizz than I expected. Not a bad thing, but the mouthfeel reminded me a bit of orange soda. I don't know that I'd want to drink more than one of these at a time, but it's a fine fall/winter ale."
"Overall this is a pretty good beer. Not much sign of the 7% ABV, the aftertaste is nice toasted malts instead of some overpowering spices. Pretty easy to drink actually, I could see having a few of these and then the alcohol giving you a kick."
"Not a very enjoyable pumpkin ale, I'll pass on this in the future."
"D - A solid tasty pumkin beer. Probably would be one of my favorite pumpkin beers if I didn't try the smuttynose before it."
"D- Decent characteristics but the pumpkin and alcohol become too much to drink too fast. This is only 7% ABV and it has the presence of one 10%+. Still looking foreward to other pumpkin ales but I doubt I will have this one again."
"A solid offering from Dogfish Head."
"This beer is wonderfully brewed. A lot of spices in this brew. A lot going on. I really enjoyed this beer, but I couldn't make a session of this. The 7% abv isn't noticeable, but the complex spicing makes this beer not ideal for sessions. I could still drink a couple of these, but wouldn't want more than 2 in a session."
"D: Drinkable, but not something I'll be drinking again."
"D- a solid pumpkin ale"
"Medium bodied, nicely carbonated, it's a hearty Fall ale but does not fill you up by any means. Nice drinkable seasonal from DFH!"
"This is one of the more complex pumpkin ales I've tried, with a toasted (burnt even) malt flavor up front, along with pumpkin pie spices, including cinnamon, allspice, ginger, and nutmeg, and followed up by the faint flavor of pumpkin/squash. There's even a hint of alcohol in the finish as the beer warms. Dogfish Head does an excellent job of balancing all these flavors, to the point where one doesn't dominate. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and slightly chewy. Even at a higher percent, this is a great beer to session on a nice fall night or with an autumn meal."
"Pours a clear tawny bronze hue, with an off-white foamy two finger head. Good retention produces thick wisps of stubborn lace. You can smell the pumpkin, ginger and cinnamon from a few feet away, and the allspice, nutmeg and toasted malt are obvious as well, with faint caramel in the background. Deeply toasted pale malt and medium crystal upon first sip- deliciously sweet with a hint of tang like muscavado or turbinado ester. A suggestion of dextrin and good dose of vegetal/squash taste transforms into a traditional pumpkin pie flavor complete with slightly peppery fresh ginger, spicy cinnamon, some faint clove and heavy allspice character. The aftertaste is a gradual fading of the malt and spice that reveals a soft but balancing woody english hop flavor and bitterness that balances the remaining malt and pairs nicely with the spices. Most Pumpkin beers I have tried are either light and overly spiced or have a well-rounded flavor but very mild in charatcer overall; this results in a poor mouthfeel, but Dogfish Head has matched a medium-body/residual sugar profile with medium-light carbonation that lifts the sweetness from the toungue in conjunction with the balancing spices/hops. The finish is also gentle and smooth but saturated with complex flavor. This beer really tastes like a slice of pumkin pie dunked in a hearty Northern English Brown ale and is far and away the best Pumpkin ale I have tried to date."
"Pours a clear dark amber color with an impressive white head featuring tightly compacted bubbles which immediately remind me of the Fred. Aroma is primarily of malt and spices such as clove and cinnamon. The taste is malt liquorish with a little pumpkin and spice. The alcohol is out in the open and noticeable. Mouthfeel is light and almost watery with restrained carbonation. Overall, this is ok and I'm enjoying it, but it's really not something I'll seek out in the future."
"D - This was very drinkable I found myself a little disappointed when the glass was gone"
"Pours a clear copper, with an orange hue. The head is think and fizzy, and dissipates quickly. The smell is mostly of spices, with pumpkin pie coming to mind. Taste is slightly malty with a nice, but not overpowering pumpkin flavor, and the spices stick around for a little while after the beer is gone. A light mouthfell, and drinkable for the style, and abv. This is not my favorite style, but one of the better fall seasonals in my opinion"
"Eric"
"A very nice pumpkin ale that I'll be drinking more of."
"Overall this is one of my favorite Pumkin beers, so far my favorite is Shipyard's Pumkinhead, but this is a very close second."
"Overall, reminiscent of Anchor's Christmas beer but with pumpkin. It's not quite in the same league, but still very enjoyable albeit a bit pricey at almost $10 a 4 pack."
"Got a four-pack of these cause of my constant faith in Dogfish Head. This one proved okay, although it might not be my style of choice. Pours a crystal clear orangy-amber color with a finger of white head that dissolves fairly fast and leaves no lacing. Nose is strong on numeg and pumpkin. Light roasted malt. A touch of spice. Taste is heavy on earthy malt. Light cinnamon and stronger nutmeg as the beer warms. Light alcohol shows up later on. Very light brn sugar as well. Body is medium to full with perfect carbonation. This one's interesting. Almost like liquid pumpkin pie. Not my favorite beer of all time but a nice change of pace. It's got the ingredients listed on the bottle, and they're pretty much all there in the beer."
"Tried a 12 oz. bottle of this from my buddy kboett77. No freshness date marked on the bottle. Pours a beautiful... well... pumpkin color. Lovely dark orange. Small white head that only sticks around the edges. Smells of pumpkin, bread, pumpkin pie spices like cinnamon, star anise, and sweet toasted grain. The flavors are sharp and dark: pumpkin, the bread again, pie spices. Mouthfeel is bright and effervescent. A tad watery, but not bad. Overall, a very drinkable Pumpkin Ale, and a fine example of the style. Not as smooth as some (such as New Holland's Ichabod or Weyerbacher's Imperial), but style a great Pumpkin Ale. I would gladly reach for this one again."
"This is another good offering from Dogfish head. Some people have told me it's too hoppy, but I don't think so. Decide for yourself, because it's worth checking out."
"What's not to like?"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light to medium bodied. Carbonation is excellent. 7% abv is perfect for this beer. Drinkability is good. I'd probably drink two, but no more. It just doesn't have session appeal for me. Overall, it's a good beer. Definitely a nice fall release."
"Mouthfeel is a little thin and drinkability is hurt by the level of spice. One and done for me. A nice holiday treat that I may or may not pick up again closer to Thanksgiving."
"I have to say right off the start that pumpkin beers never really inspired me. My girlfriend however loves them, and in trying many samples from many breweries, we've come to believe Punkin' Ale from DFH is by far the best. Built on a foundation of a rich brown ale and with 7%abv strength this is serious beer. Some brewers use only pumpkin and others use only pumpkin spices(nutmeg,cinnimon, brown sugar). DFH uses both in great quantity for the ultimate flavor and aroma of pumpkin pie. I also love the bright orange 4-pack. It makes it easy to find this beer as it flies off the shelves at all my local beer shops."
"Drinkability: Perfect for a nice fall day."
"This years batch seemed to have a heavier, malted taste compared to last. The balance is not quite as evenly matched as '06, but i've actually come to enjoy it more. This is my post-shift beer until the keg blows."
"The bottom line: a fairly standard take on the Fall Pumpkin beer. I don't mind it, but the spice combination used here isn't quite what I'm looking for."
"Pours a clean orange-ish yellow color, with a white head. Aromas of nutmeg, cinnamon and allspice. In the taste, nutmeg, cinnamon, allspice, and a brown sugar sweetness. A spicy mouthfeel, with a dry brown sugar aftertaste. Nice spices, yet a bit sweet. Not much of pumpkin presence, yet still nice."
"Best pumpkin beer I have tried and will have it again."
"A very drinkable beer. Highly recommend!"
"D: This years batch seems to have dialed back the """pumpkin pie spiciness""" of last years batch, and punched up the bitterness and alcohol heat. Seems slightly more ragged than last years version."
"Overall, an excellent pumpkin ale with a lot to offer. Perhaps not the best I've had, but it's up there."
"Drinkability: Loved the stuff fresh, this however is to be sipped and enjoyed. Could only have a few of these. Overall I think it aged very well. Wish I could have saved more but Can only be purchased around here in 4 packs and too good to try and age more then one bottle a year"
"This is one pumpkin ale I make sure to get every year."
"Pours a nice amber color with minimal head if at all. Aroma is very strong and pumpkin-like upfront. The spice shows very well. The taste is much of the same except I detect sweetness, brown sugar, pumpkin and a nice aftertaste. A second sip confirms just how malty this beer is. It seems well-balanced when compared to the pumpkin ale I had before it. I'd definitely recommend it over the other example of this style I had."
"This is an excellent pumpkin ale that has very strong and flavorful hints of pumpkin. It is very easy to drink with a strong but somehow not bitter after-taste. It pours beautifully with a dark amber light to it somehow and develops a great head that dissapates fairly quickly. Smells almost like pumpkin pie!"
"Pours a orangish-copper color with a small off-white head that quickly disappears leaving little lacing. Smells like pumpkin pie. The spices that I can pick out are nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves, and ginger. Underneath the spices I can detect some faint malt and pumpkin aromas. Tastes much like pumpkin pie. The spices come on a bit strong at first but soon yield to a nice combination of malts, brown sugar, and pumpkin, with malts being dominant. Towards the finish I get just a bit of alcohol astringency coming through, not overwhelming and I can't quite pick it up every time but its definitely there. The more of this I drink the more the spices make a comeback in the finish. Good mouthfeel, nice medium-ish body with low-moderate carbonation. Drinkability is average. I think one of these in a night is enough for me. The dominant spice flavors that only become more intense and ever-present as I drink this beer deter me from having another. I do, however, think this would be perfect for a chilly late autumn evening. So, bottom-line: this is a good beer that I would recommend but in my humble opinion this isn't the best or most drinkable pumpkin ale."
"Still, a great example of a pumpkin ale. Very well done. I enjoyed my glass."
"D: This beer is ok, but I would not say it was that drinkable. A lot of spices, especially nutmeg, eventually made me feel kind of sick and dizzy (and this was my first beer of the night!). The spices definitely got to me, and I'd be surprised if anyone could pound a bunch of these in a row."
"D - Very tasty, but a bit much for more than 2 or 3 I would say. The combination of the spices and sweetness make it not something you would want a session of. I enjoyed 2 pints and it was worthy of that in one sitting. A great example of the Pumpkin ale style. Dogfish head doesn't shy away from a true full pumpkin pie like flavor. Not just a spiced ale - this is the real deal. It tastes like I would love to make a pie from the leftover ale-soaked pumpkin meat."
"Drinkability: Horrible. To much alcohol...no pumpkin. I enjoy Pumpkin ales when they actually taste something like pumpkin and spice. This one really has neither."
"This is one of the better pumpkin ale that I've had to date, and it's a nice treat for the fall. Interestingly, I think this beer is best enjoyed on its own rather than trying to pair it with something similarly spiced. I've tried it both with a pumpkin chili that I made using the beer as an ingredient, as well as with an apple pumpkin muffin and some apple crisp, and I don't think there is enough malt sweetness in the brew to stand up to a sweeter, spiced food."
"Pours an octoberfest orange, clear as day. Mild white head that dies and laces as mild as can be but consistant. Smells of freshly baked pumpkin pie and lots of halloween spice and everything nice. Tastes as it smells with some nice malty backbone. A tasty brew indeed. Medium and a little creamy in the mouth. Nice tickle of carbonation and a nice octoberfest session beer. Cheers!"
"Overall, a solid beer. Not overpowering, just the right amount of """fall flavors""". Worth a try for sure."
"dark amber - almost brown with a great cream colored head and nice lace. i smell hops, malt, spice and a hint of sweet bready yeast. tastes like a really nice brown ale with a slight pumpkin pie finish. great fall flavor - not overboard. good creamy and full body. i really enjoyed this as an after dinner digestif. best pumpkin beer i've ever tried. go dfh."
"D-Simply put this is my favourite pumpkin beer on the market. Perfect blend of spices, nice ammount of sweetness and a low hop bitterness combine to really make this a delicious beer."
"On draft at Sunset Grill in Allston, MA. Pours a medium copper without much carbonation. Faint pumpkin and spice aroma. But the taste is strong pumpkin pie. This one delivers as promised - it's a straight up pumpkin ale with lots of flavour. Good stuff."
"Cheers .. C'Mon the Hoops !!"
"529 reviews, 514 applied as of this writing. Wow, this beer gets around. I finally had this during weekend (fantasy football draft day) and was very pleased with the brew. I'll leave the various descriptions to the 529 other posts and leave you with this - it definitely felt like fall football saturday (96 in Boston) and this beer was appreciated by all. Kudos to DFH for a fine brew that doesn't need to be extreme to be good."
"This is a great pumpkin ale. It's not sweet; pumpkin and spices dominate, while malts and hops are certainly blended well. I recall that of all the pumpkin ales I tried last year, this was my favorite. We'll see how that turns out!"
"D- The alcohol in this is very noticeable. I know some don't like that, but I actually do. Unfortunately, it is 85 degress outside. This would go great on a cool October night while taking the kids around Trick-Or-Treating. Well done by a great brewery who aren't afraid to try some new things."
"Pours an amber color with very slim white bubbly head at the top of the glass. No lacing whatsoever is left along the side. Smell is lacking a little bit, but I can pick up some spices, maybe some coriander. Taste is where I can find more of the spices and coriander. Get some of the pumpkin (punkin) in every other sip. Very nice sweet pumpkin flavor. Carbonation is a little strong too which is nice with the slightly warming sensation received as well. Not sure if I will buy anohter 4pack but this was a decent offering."
"As this is only the second """pumpkin""" ale I've ever tasted, I was pretty impressed."
"Pours a golden amber color with an average white head that dissipated fairly quick, no lacing. The smell is quite good, brown sugar, nutmeg, cinnamon, nice and spicy though not picking up much pumpkin. The taste on the other hand I do pick up the pumpkin. This really does taste like a pumpkin pie in a glass. Starts off with a nice peppery pumpkin flavor, followed by the sweet brown sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg flavors. A nice caramel malt backbone with a touch of bitterness to offset the sweet flavors. The feel is more on the light side, moderately carbonated. A great pumpkin ale to kick off the season."
"This is an excellent beer, and one I will be purchasing again in the future."
"Very good overall but at 4 for $7.99 a little more pricey than other very good fall brews."
"D: This is by far one of my favorite pumpkin ales. DFH does a really nice job with it, and I always look forward to the first 4-pack of the season."
"Drinkability - good solid beer, but I dont think I could throw more than two back at a time."
"Picked up in Green Bay, Wisconsin last November. Last straggler of a bottle that's been hiding in my beer fridge. Nice looking beer- good head and head retention, nice clarity and dark cherry oak colour. Smell is good and spicy- nutmeg and cinamon. Taste- the spice in the nose is there in spades in flavour and then some. Very spicy- probably heaviest spiced beer I've had to date. Almost seems like it would be better mulled than cold. I thought this would have lost some of its bite considering its age, but its holding up well. I have to say, its one of the more enjoyable DFH beers I've head (esp. compared to black and blue). It just needs a spoonful of coolwhip on the top and its pumpkin pie in the glass. Carbonation is appropriate and the finish is quite good. I wouldn't drink it by the gallon, but this last 12 ounce bottle is a nice treat at the end of a night."
"D- Very drinkable. A bit too many flavors that aren't beer for me to make it a session beer, but definitely an annual pickup for the holidays."
"Like I said, it's smooth, I'd say medium bodied, and very drinkable to me."
"M/D- Med-light body with moderate carbonation, not too sweet and very easy to drink....and overall tastes like you are drinking a big glass of the fall weather."
"Pours a clean/clear golden amber color, nice carbonation, tiny fizzy white head which dissappears quickly, some sticky lacing afterwards. The nose is of sweet malts, pumpkin, nutmeg, caramel, and cinnimon. The taste is malty, slight pumpkin, nutmeg, and cinnimon. There is a warm feeling of alcohol in the throat on the way down. Medium body. Drinkable, a very nice pumpkin brew, will buy more next year. I do have one more bottle for later though."
"Overall Impression: I was ready for a retro-seasonal; a nice reminder of Fall now that Spring has started. This has wintered nicely in my fridge. This is my go to Pumpkin beer, the only way to spend Halloween. Ive heard aging makes this even better, its a nice one to keep around."
"My thanks go out to Wasatch for this beauty!"
"Pours an amber color with an off white head that fades quickly. Smell is very good. spicy nutmeg and cinnamon then an earthy malt. Very smooth medium body and a sweetness from brown sugar. A nice hop and carbonation adds a pleasant complexity to it. Very drinkable."
"So not the beer I expected, I thought that there would be a lot more pumpkin in there."
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve ounce brown glass long neck bottle with a pop off crown, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"This brew is the closest thing Ive tried to what you might call an Imperial pumpkin ale. Its a bit beefier than most, with stronger, more complex flavors. Its still got all those familiar pumpkin flavors; allspice, cinnamon, nutmeg, the somewhat eclipsed pumpkin malt character, and some roasted notes. But, compared to most other pumpkin ales, the spice profile is bolder; the variety of flavor is more complex, the roast character is heavier and its noticeably drier. If you like pumpkin ales, but want more refinement, this might be your favorite once you try it. Recommended."
"Beer poured a copper color with an OK white head. Nose is pleasant, of allspice and malt. Taste is malty, accented by spices and a bit of a dry hop. Mouthfeel is OK,could be a bit heavier. Overall drinkability is OK. This is a nice representation of the style."
"Thanks for throwing this one my way MuenchenerKindl,"
"Overall Impression: Very interesting beer. Reminds me of a Christmas Ale or Holiday seasonal. I feel the bitterness was just a tad over powering over all of the other flavors. Clean fermented and you can definetly taste the alcohol in this one."
"Thank you Chadbrew!"
"D- Very nice on a cold day."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle, into a pint glass. The beer poured a dark copper, with a 3/4 inch head, that quickly faded. Very little lacing left on the glass. The aroma was more pumpkin, than other pumkin ales that I've tried, also with not as much spice in the nose. The taste is alot like the smell, being a basic brown ale, with pumpkins added, but with the other spices taking a back seat. Not as rich in spice as other pumpkin ales that I've tried, but still nonetheless, a great pumpkin beer. A welcome addition to any session, as long as the wallet can afford it. Its a bit more pricey than other beers in the style, but definitely one worth enjoying a few times during the season."
"D- could be sessionable but abv% is 7, so not a great idea. easy to drink and enjoyable at that. this is a role model for pumpkin brews"
"Ive never had a pumpkin ale before, but this one was tasty. The alcohol crept up slowly toward the end, so I dont know quite how many I could enjoy in one sitting. Its easily a fun, enjoyable single, but I could see pairing this with some good food and having a couple. I enjoyed it and would easily enjoy another!"
"Drinkability: I have been critical of this beer in the past, and had an awful experience with it on draft earlier this year, but this year's bottled version has won me over; the fusel alcohol problem is gone and it has a nice flavor profile"
"This is about the best of the Pumkin's I have tried, The beer itself is a nice glowing orange and there is not a real big head to speajk of. No lacing. The smell is of punkins and spices. The taste is of spice and pumkin. The mouthfeel is smooth and the drinkability is good. A good, accurate representation of the syle."
"This was a pleasant pumpkin ale. It poured a hazy golden yellow with an orange hue. The foam was medium and white with some lace on the glass. The smell of spices was sort of weak compare to some other pumpkin ale's. Upon tasting this ale, spices was evident on the palate. There was nutmeg, pumpkin, a touch of all-spice and cinnimon. The finish had a touch of bitterness that even made the flavor of all the spices more inteness."
"All in all a decent brew, doesn't really stand out as great like some of Dogfish Head's other brews."
"Bottle. Little head with no lacing. Less pumpkin aroma than I was hoping for, more ginger notes and citrusy hop aromas. Nutmeg and ginger and malt notes on the palate with shades of molassas and burnt sugar. Stayed malty, even with evident hop bittering. More a gingerbread beer than a pumpkin beer."
"Drinkability: The pumpkin flavor was subtle to the point of being absent. Sure, there's plenty of spices, but the missing pumpkin flavor was a disappointment, and made for an uninteresting beer. I guess $8.99 doesn't get you much pumpkin these days."
"keep on trying DFH I love the intresting efforts, and when you get them right, its such a treat"
"Drinkability is only about average, even for a pumpkin ale. The spice profile is just too strong to drink more than one of these per sitting."
"A color shows itself to be reminiscent of amber waves of wheaty grain, and maybe a pumpkin or two. Good bubbles and a little lacing. Two finger head after the pour and a receding foam as the drinking goes on. Plenty of sweet pumpkin pie aromas like nutmeg, brown sugar, cinnamon, and of course the main attraction. The best tasting pumpkin ale I've had so far, untl sometrhing better touches my tastebuds. A little lagery, but still in tune with the fall season. Spicey and sweet with the fruit of the great pumpkin."
"Sorry DFH, love most everything you do but this didn't do it for me. I was thinking maybe, Indian Brown with roasted Pumpkin in the mash wold make a fantastic Pumpkin but that is not with this is."
"The body has a mid feel with limited carbonation. Surprising ABV as there is a light wispy flavor. Overall a good seasonal beer that should come back next year, unlike Aston Kucher, who should not."
"Dogfish Head does an excellent job of making their beers a little bit different than everyone elses. In this case they make their punkin ale a little bit better than everyone elses."
"This beer poured a very pretty reddish orange color with a 1/4 inch head that lingered in the glass. Aroma? What else but pumpkin pie, holiday spices and caramel malts. Taste was very well balanced between holiday spices(cinammon, allspice), bitter hops and sweet malts. I could also pick up on a bit of brown sugar in each sip. Mouthfeel was medium bodied and quite smooth and easy drinking. I could pick up a slight alcoholic note as the beer warmed to room temperature. Drinkability was fairly high. The spiciness is not overly cloying and is in just the right proportion with the malt character and the hops. Overall, a nice Fall/Thanksgiving offering from DFH that makes the holidays more enjoyable."
"D - I have this in my top pumpkin selections. I'm currently aging one - just to see how it changes over time - but I plan on making a Halloween tradition out of this beer. To be honest, I expect no less from DFH..."
"I searched everywhere for this damn beer! I finally found the last case at Total Wine in Cherry Hill, NJ while i was there for work. This beer is seriously fall in a bottle. When i first had it and read the label, it claims to be a brown ale, it tasted more like a vienna lager/oktoberfest styled beer. However it was not disappointing at all... just caught me off guard a little. The spices and pumpkin are not overbearing at all... the perfect amount. This beer actually inspired me to brew my own pumpkin ale! Cheers to all who can find it/drink it!!!!"
"M - Very smooth, refreshing, and drinkable. This is one that I could have all night"
"D - Most likely pass on this brew due to the bitter finish. I'm not a fan of brown ales. I would not consider it a disappointment and would recommend to any brown ale drinking."
"D- More crisp than the 05 but stronger individual flavors. Need probably about 6 months to just blend perfectly. I need one in between."
"Ordered this one to start up the evening and was pleasantly surprised. Poured a light, glowing orange-yellow with generous carbonation. Was very surprised at the hop chracteristic and very subtle use of what seemed like cloves and allspice- much less pronounced than other pumpkin ales I've had. Finished dry and very mildly malty-sweet. Very refreshing, very seasonal, drinkable beer- just not so sure the novelty would last year round."
"A: Deep copper with thick creamy froth and excellent retention. S: Earthy pumpkin with hints of spicy sweetness T: Excellent smooth and mild pumpkin flavor with interesting notes of raisins and pumpkin pie spices. M: Medium body with long lasting taste retention and a clean finish on the palate D: This is a very tasty seasonal with excellent and unusual flavors that is very drinkable and easily sessioned."
"Notes from bottle: Bottled 9/28/06. """A full-bodied brown ale brewed with real pumpkin, brown sugar, allspice, cinnamon & nutmeg.""""
"D - Not too awful. After one, I don't exactly look forward to a second, but the beer itself was not a struggle to drink. This is one of the most pumpkin flavored pumpkin ales around, but it is lacking in the pumpkin pie spices. If that is how you like you pumpkin ales, then go for it, but I'll sooner take Weyerbacher's Pumpkin."
"This is a good pumpkin ale, though it is my first one. I was expecting the spices to be somewhat """too much""" but they were right on. They were sublte and balanced yet easily detectable and pleasant. A very fun ale overall. Recommended."
"Cheers to you DFH!"
"Dont get me wrong, this brew is well balanced and highly drinkable on a cool autumn day!"
"Great stuff. I love it."
"Bottom line, an original entry into the pumpkin beer category. Not as good as the Post Road, but tasty indeed. DFH rocks."
"d - medium carbonation. this is a well-balanced beer with a lot of nice flavors throughout. great fall beer and one i enjoy."
"Kudos to the crazy folks at Dogfish Head for putting out a tasty pumpkin ale that's more than just a marketing gimmick."
"The taste has a high maltiness followed quickly by a bit of pumpkin and spice and then hop flavor. The 7% abv gives the mouthfeel a nice sharpness. This is the best bottled pumpkin ale I have tried this season. I would like to taste this in draught form to see how it compares with other pumpkins I have had on tap."
"Maybe not an everyday beer, as the flavors are on the wild side, but certainly a must at the Thanksgiving table, and an overall excellent seasonal brew. Could probably even appeal to beer drinkers who usually don't go for this sort of thing."
"Notes: A solid pumpkin ale. Will be on the look out for it next year."
"I've never had a pumpkin beer before, and I figured if there is one to try it would be DFH. Pours coppery orange with a nice head that faded to nothing is 10 seconds flat. The smell is not spicey and stong the way I expected, though I am getting some nutmeg, but mainly it's just a malty smell. The taste is slightly tart, with a suprising amount of cinnamon, along with nutmeg, and malt. There is a slightly bitter finish, but not hoppy, more a combination of bitter barlery and some kind of tannin from the spcies. This whole time I'm wondering if there are actually hops in this. I can't really taste them, but sometimes I think I can smell them. And this leads me to the question of the hour... which flavor is the pumkin? This certainly does not have the hearty and rich character of a pumpkin pie, and even then, what do you taste more in a pumpkin pie... the pumpkin or the spices? I've got to attribute the sour/tartness to the pumpkin, but having no experience with pumpkin brews, its complete speculation. The mouthfeel is pretty typical for a DFH brew, that being a full medium body with a watery, dry finish. Overall, this beer probalby left me with more questions than answers, and for that reason alone I enjoyed it. On top of that, it's a drinkable beer with unique flavors."
"Props to the 7% ABV on this one, a very distinct approach at pumpkin beer in my opinion. One of the necessary drinks in the genre."
"Once again I'm not a Pumpkin beer guy normally, I've reviewed one and thought a counter point would be a good idea, especially when its a dogfish head. Poured an orangey amber color with golden high lights. The head is a white foam color, leaving some lacing, with decent retention. Smells just like it says subtle, but real pumpkin, brown sugar, spice, cinnamon and nutmeg. Smells more like an ale with pumpkin/spicing added sparingly, not an over powering smack in the face of synthetic pumpkin pie. Honestly the the smell is not terribly enticing, but its equally not dispelling. The flavor is not as sweet as I expected, its got a bit more tartness and a nice tinge of bitterness. It maintains a nice crisp flavor, some malt complexity and a mellow pumpkin spice finish. For me I'd prefer this type of pumpkin beer to others that use a syrup to flavor and are more forward front with their over sweet pumpkin flavor. Personally this is not as good as some of Dogfish heads other seasonal brews (aprihop) but its definitely not bad. If some one wanted a pumpkin brew, so far I'd say this is the way to go."
"Overall, I really didn't care for this beer. It is one of the worst pumpkin ales I've tried. Quite disappointing. I may pour it down the drain instead of fnishing it. I hope people who try this as their first pumpkin ale will not give up on the style. There are many other ones out there that IMO are much better--Cottonwood, Edenton, and Post Road all come to mind."
"Looks ok, nothing special, thin amber. Smells like beer I don't really care for. Over-spice is all you get. Tastes like it smells. Light bitter finish, not in a good way. Lacks bite in the mouth. Finish lingers but is hurt by over-spiced imbalnce. So-so drinkability. This is the kind of beer that makes people not like DFH so much."
"Drinkability- More flavorful than most pumpkin ales, but the flavor choices to me were a bit odd. Not sure if I'll seek this out again or not. It's certainly decent, but maybe it needs to grow on me."
"Pours orangey-amber with a small white head. Definite pumpkin pie spice aromas. Has a lot more pumpkin pie flavor than other pumpkin ales, but without sacrificing drinkability. Has an interesting subtle caramel finish. A great change of pace for the season, will definitely be having a few more this fall."
"I am going to get a load of these to bring home for thanksgiving for sure."
"D: A decent beer, pumpkin or otherwise, but not one I'd have to drink again. Spices seemed subdued, less than I'd hoped for; I was underwhelmed. Worth a try, I guess..."
"Thanks to jwc215 for sending this in a trade. A nice pumpkin ale. Poured a very slightly cloudy orange colour with a white foamy head that faded away very quickly leaving a ring of frost around the edges of the glass. Smell is sweet malts with a muted but present portfolio of pumpkin pie, cinnamon, nutmeg, and a maple syrup smell hidden way in the back. Very nice. Taste is more of the same, finishing mildly sweet and leaving all these flavour profiles in your mouth many seconds after you've swallowed a sip. Mouthfeel is a bit heavier than I was expecting. Not offensive, simply heavier than I thought it would be. Another pleasant offering from DFH."
"I dont know why it is so hard to make a good pumpkin beer. I have had two pumpkin beers (Post Road and Cottonwood) that are actually pumpkiny and balanced and the whole nine. I love this style and wish there were more offerings that tasted like pumpkin and the fall season, etc. Sigh..."
"At this point, the best pumkin beer I have tasted. I often like the first few sips of a pumpkin, but then I get sick of it. Not this one. Smooth and delicious, it has a nice copper hue with incredible aromas- just like on the bottle- allspice, cinnamon and nutmeg. But it is not overpowering. I think this due to the hops. This is not a bitter beer at all, but there is hint of it,which keeps this beer crisp."
"Pours a dark orange/amber color with a descent off white that leaves a nice top lace all the way to the end. The nose consists of sweet malts, nutmeg, and cinnamon. The first sip shows a huge peppery spice ester character, toasted malts, and considerable hop addition. Roasted barley, yeasty. The alcohol presence is fairly potent and mixed with a high hop content it seems to blend the pumpkin pie spices almost too well. Its difficult to discern between all of the spices. Moving down the glass I found some more notes of caramel, cinnamon, and smoothed out roasted malts. The alcohol strength fades a little making way for some pumpkin pie flavor."
"Poured a dark orange/copper color with a nice head to it that soon vanished. Nice and creamy. The smell is a wonderful nutmeg and cinnamon with a taste of pumpkin. Not overpowering though. It has a great after taste. I highly recommend this pumpkin ale, it is one of the best I have had."
"Bottom line - it's a nicely spiced pumpkin ale. It's not as over-the-top, or unusual, as other offerings from this brewery. It's just a well-done, enjoyable pumpkin ale. It's one worth considering to accompany a pumpkin pie dessert on Thanksgiving, or just to have when in the mood for the style."
"Edit note: I have to disagree with the recommended serving temperature of this beer: 45-50°F. I really feel that it had a decent start at 55° and sort of came into its own at 60-61°. Personally, if I have it again, I'll shoot for the warmer side."
"Mouthfeel is medium and very clean. Not nearly as powerful as most pumpkin ales, relies much more on the """ale""" and less on the """pumpkin.""" I'm not a big fan of the style but this is by far the best I've had."
"Oh god. I'm not going to drink another one of these. I will crack another one open to see if it's carbonated, but the rest are going to my mom who happens to like alcoholic pumpkin soda."
"This poured to a lighter side of copper color into my Duvel tulip. There was a moderate and fast decreasing head that was easily restarted via twirling. The smell was crisper than expected. It was cinnamon., pumpkin pie spices, rich malt and hop balance. This really grew on me as the glass waned. The finish was as crisp as an apple, with hints of sweetness and flavoring hops.I was not expecting such full bodied quality and hop balance. Such great carbonation and crispness. This beer is a credit to the class; the reason why pumpkin beers deserve attention in the autumn season."
"D - I could drink this often in the cold months."
"Am I the only one who thinks this?"
"I'm not a big fan of pumpkin beers. I'm not even a big fan of pumpkin pie, don't shoot! And don't tell grandma."
"Unlike most pumpkin ales, this is a definitely more of a sipping beer."
"Great drinkability easily a perfect drink for the fall season. This is the perfect beer before the dark beer season. A great way to give a beer a seasonal novelty, but this one is definitely something that can be drunk on any fall day."
"If you like pumpkins and want something hearty, spicy, and sweet, then I'd definitely recommend this one from DFH. One of my faves of the pumpkin ales being offered this season. Cheers!"
"This is the best pumpkin ale I've had. It's balanced enough to drink more than one and isn't just for special occasions."
"Overall a nice BROWN ALE. I don't really get the whole pumpkin label though."
"Pours a copper color with a frothy white head that maintains body and leaves some scant lacing. Moderate bubbles. I smell mostly toasty malts, caramelized pumpkin, and spices. No hops to speak of. A malt backbone stands out most in this beer, not letting the flavorings take hold. Some roasted pumpkin and toasted spices come through. Bittering finish, but no real hop flavor to speak of, above the other flavors. Mouthfeel is of moderate and soft body. Really drinkable for what this is."
"My first pumpkin ale, and kind of a letdown. The flavor is just not what I was expecting at all. The spices and alcohol were too much, and I didn't really enjoy it. It wasn't horrible, but I wouldn't get it again. Not recommended."
"The pour into my Fuller's nonic raises a one finger creamy light tan head over a clear copper body. It looks thin. Lacing is sudsy but still somewhat substantial. The head falls slowly to a glass ring. The nose is all about the strong pumpkin pie spices: nutmeg, cinnamon, and allspice. The pumpkin scent also comes through strongly, and I can easily pick out the brown sugar, too. There's also a dry toasty aroma that doesn't jive well with the rest of the nose. The taste is fairly dry, and dominated first by bitter toastiness, with the spices and pumpkin flavor in the background. The artertaste is fairly clean, too. There's nothing stand-out about this here. The body is medium, with sharp carbonation. I feel that a smoother and sweeter beer would be much better than this dry mess."
"While I am not the biggest pumpkin ale fan, this one wins me over. It's beer first, pumpkin and spice second, and overall just quite good. The ABV is notable only in the nose, so it's sneaky, but worth the minor peril. I'd say it's a Thanksgiving treat, but I want it again sooner than that."
"A great beer, one I will get again."
"Overall, its the best pumpkin beer I've tried so far."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle, well carbonated, clear orange punkin color, white 2 fingure head some lacing. smooth malt taste followed by a punking and spice combination, great balance, alcohol aftertaste. average mouthfeel, overall good drinkability. One of the better punkin ales I have had this year, no over the top spice or punkin flavor, great balance, a little heavy on the alcohol."
"Having tried this both on tap and bottle i must admit it is my least favorite pumpkin beer of the season. I know i know how can i say such a thing. This was always my favorite but after trying wyerbacher and smuttynose there is just no comparison. There is a small amount of spice smell and scents however nothing compared to the other two. Tastes more like a brown ale than anything else. I could definetly drink more of it than the other two but it is also a lot pricer which knocks it down a peg or two."
"Good finishing hop bitterness to counter the sweet malt and spices. Very nice effort from Dogfish Head."
"Pours an orangish amber with a very modest head that diddipates quickly. Smell is pretty amazing, strong spices; with a bit heavier pumpkin smeel it would smell like pumpkin pie. Taste reiterates what the smell implies, spice with faint pumpkin. Leaves a tingle in your mouth."
"The aroma and taste of this beer was loaded with brown sugar, cinnimon, allspice and nutmeg. The pumpkin taste was extremely faint and hiding behind all the other tastes and aromas. The mouthfeel was sort of grainy, with bubbles present on the tounge. There was a slight alcohol feel to it also but rather slight. The finish was loaded with residual sugars that loaded the tounge down. The beer was alright but not really impressive."
"I have been craving a pumpkin ale lately, albeit I have never actually had 1 I enjoyed. This one poured a pumpkin orange color with a decent off-white head that went down to a fine foamy layer of head. Smells like artificial pumpkin and spice, not too bad actually. Taste is ok, it starts out with a nice spice and pumpkin and then changes to something I can only describe as wet dog. It just really doesnt do anything for me. Not really too special in my opinion. Mouthfeel is thin and dry. I can see some people liking this beer, but its not for me, think i'll steer clear of pumpkin ales till next year."
"there was a lot of talk about how this is a high quality pumpkin ale, while shipyards pumpkinhead was a bad one (Even a bad beer overall) but although i feel this DFH punkin' is better than Shipyard Pumpkinhead, they're close, i like both."
"Poured into a pint. Color was slightly lighter than the bottle, with some head that lasted the entire drink. Didn't notice much in the aroma. Had a slight hint of spices, but nothing overwhelming. The flavor was subtle, a nice beer, not quite what I was expecting. Tasted almost roasted pumpkin in the beer. Nothing to blatant, but left plenty of flavor. Very pleasant to drink, coated the mouth nicely. Nice beer overall."
"D: High abv is consistent with all DFH brews, but is sufficiently masked. A good seasonl--I'd induldge next year."
"Pours a glowingly orangey-amber with a one finger bubbled head and chapagne like carbonation. This claims to be a brown ale? Hard to see. Aroma is rathery pumpkin-like, a bit of hops detected, not much in spice aromas...or maybe the nutmeg and allspice are simply making me think pumkin? Hard to tell. Taste wise its actually a bit pumpkiny, definitely hoppy, and more of a pale ale in style, with yes, a legitimate pumpkin flavor! Spices are subdued and acompany the hops in the finish if any. The 7% is not present in the flavor, which is rather thick. Mouthfeel is medium, and by the now the carbvonation has settled, so okay at this point. Drinabilitywise, It's the best pumpkin beer I've tasted yet by far, though a little less hops could make the pumpkin shine through a bit more, and some might crave more spices. Never knowing the 7% abv here is scary, and the label is the only way we'd know. My favorite brewery does not disapoint, but this beer doesn't make me want to make room for it in the stockpile. Nothing I'll buy in four packs, but I can see grabbing a single or two of this per season for variety."
"Nice golden color with a thick creamy head. Nose gives off lots of cinnamon, and rotten pumpkin. The taste is of a big amount of clove and nutmeg, with a metallic flavor, and just a tiny bit of pumpkin rounded out by malt and a citrus/spicy hop. A slightly heavy finish with an average mouthfeel."
"Dogfish Head brewed up another winner with this ale. I would probably say that of all the pumpkin ales I've had, this one is my absolute favorite: just the right blend of sweetness and spice. If I had a slice of pumpkin pie with it, I think I'd be in heaven."
"Bought in a four pack. A bit expensive but since I love Pumpkin Ales, well worth it. This was a pretty tough beer. Poured a beautiful dark orange amber colour. The head stuck around much longer than other Pumpkin Ales I've met but still not as long as I'd have liked. Spices (especially Nutmeg!) overpower any pumpkin flavor there is and the alcohol is very tasteable. Also sense somewhat of a toasty flavor in the finish. Very nice beer and is very hearty. 7.0% is a bit of a kicker too. Nice beer but only for the tough among us. I only got through about two before I needed something a tad lighter. Excellent effort by Dogfish but one word of advice (and this is according to MY taste, not everyone else's) turn it down just a tad. This could be very enjoyable on a snowy winter's eve."
"EDIT: I clarified some points of this review about 30 minutes after drinking, as the gravity of my actually enjoying a pumpkin ale really set in."
"A 4pack of 12oz bottles. No date when packaged. It was an orange color with a thin white head. Nicely carbonated, some decent lacing. It had a sweet, spicy aroma, mostly nutmeg. Pretty sweet taste all the way through, and I thought a fairly sharp spice presence (? allspice). I found it to be a little thin in the mouth, and not a beer I would want a lot of."
"D: To me this beer is like a Belgian style pumpkin brew, the alcohol comes through as sweet bourbon. A very nice balanced and nicely spiced beer but not my favorite for the style."
"D: Probably the best pumpkin ale that I've had, but with that said, I'm not a huge fan of this beer. It seems that this is probably what it is supposed to be, but I'll probably pass on buying it again."
"Pours deep copper in color with an off-white head that leaves a good amount of lacing on the side of the glass. Aroma is dominated by spice with a bit of pumpkin as well. Medium bodied mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. Taste is much like the smell in that the spices immediately grab your attention. Overall, the heavy use of spice is a bit of a detraction for me but nonetheless it is a solid pumpkin ale."
"Those DFH guys can really brew some interesting beers."
"This is a damn good pumpkin ale. I'll be in a rush to buy more before it's history for another year!"
"Yet another great craft from DFH."
"Mouthfeel is crisp and clean, very pleasant. 7% alcohol limits drinkability, but still, it is pleasant to consume a 4-pack over the course of an evening."
"Bought at Sam's Marcey St. for 8.99 for 4 12 oz bottles."
"Nice copper hue. Not much in the way of head. What can you say about the smell and taste? Pumpkin pie pretty much sums it up. I will say that the spices don't go over the top making this the best pumpkin ale i've had. Overall a nice fall beer that is a very good interpretation of the style."
"12oz brown bottle pours a light amber/orange with a 2 finger head, good longevity and very nice lace. Smells just like pumpkin pie before it gets baked. Lots of cinnamon, nutmeg, brown sugar etc. Again lots of pumpkin pie taste - cinnamon etc. Alcohol does come through a bit at the end and leaves a nice brown sugar flavor mixed with some bitterness. Creamy and smooth and one of the best pumpkin ales out there. Unfortunately I still find it hard to drink more than one of these in a sitting - its just a pumpkin ale thing, no matter what the brand."
"Probably the best pumpkin beer i've ever tried though i've only tried like three."
"12oz. bottle. Brown ale brewed with pumpkin puree, brown sugar, allspice, cinnamon and nutmeg. Poured a clear dark gold/amber with a moderate white head. Aroma was all about pumpkin, with some spice notes (nutmeg) and sugar. The taste was a quick sensory snapshot where I immediately thought of pumpkin seeds - the kind you make after carving a jack-o-lantern and then roasting them in the oven. Malt was toasted, caramel/toffee in the middle, and a very minor hint of hops at the finish which seemed to increase as the beer warmed. Body was light to medium, carbonation was medium, and it was slightly drying. Of the 4 pumpkin beers I have tried, this was the most subtle. It was a really good brown ale, with hints of pumpkin and spice. Well integrated, and I would be happy to drink it again. As a final note, a dangerous beer, because you don't get a hint of the 7% ABV."
"12 oz bottle found at Florians Market in Auburn. Orange, almost red body with a half an inch of off white head. Smells vegitable-ish and somewhat hoppy. Very tasty. This is a beer that tastes much better than it smells. Tastes malty and spicy. Pumpkin is also present. Medium body. I like it. Probably will be getting it again if I can find and afford it at the same time..."
"A beer to drink a few times every fall. Get a four pack and introduce some friends to it. It's better than most of the other attempts at pumpkin ale. Maybe the fact that I typically skip the pumpkin pie at thanksgiving has something to do with it. If that's your bag, however, definitely check this one out. This is one case where DH's overattention to detail definitely pays off."
"Pours copper colored with a frothy white head, leaving some lacing on the glass. Smells like pumpkin pie. Taste is spices and a little bitterness. Light bodied. This is probably the best pumpkin beer I've had, I wouldn't want to session with this but its pretty good. I also wish this one wasn't quite so expensive."
"Full, silky mouthfeel, a very nice beer for a cool fall evening."
"Light plus bodied, nicely carbonated. I would have rated the drinkability higher if I liked the taste more."
"It's a modestly carbonated beverage that is slightly heavy (as the alcohol content would have led me to believe), but is still entirely drinkable. Another solid offering from Delaware, who'd a thunk it?"
"It's on the hoppy side, starting spicy and ending bitter. The pumpkin and its associated spices come in almost as a second thought, and this increases my sip frequency as I try to seek them out. I'm not picking up much of the 7% alcohol, and this, coupled with the thin mouthfeel and great flavor, really makes for a drinkable beer. Starting out, I was concerned that the pumpkin would be a bit gimmicky, but this is 100% good beer."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle with bottled in year date notched (notch was for 2007 which was interesting since it's 2006). Had a l little head that quickly dissapated. Smell was kinda weak. Could smell the pumpkin and other spices but they were barely there. Same thing with the taste. Not bad by any stretch but then again nothing unique. Read some real good reviews on this one so hoping my bottle was off and will try again. (3.5,RB,T,Y)"
"Rich and spicy, iwth a creamy finish. Good beer for Thanksgiving, may even go will with some pumpkin pie."
"I wasn't impressed as much this year; it is ok and I don't mind that it's subdued, but just not enough going on to keep me interested."
"Served in a pint glass, it pours a copper color with a small off-white head. It smells like pumpkin, nutmeg, cinnamon and some brown sugar. It tastes like pumpkins, spices, cloves, brown sugar, nutmeg and some caramel. This definitely has more pumpkin taste (and taste in general) than the other pumpkin ales I've had. It has a medium body, with a nice, smooth mouthfeel with just the right amount of carbonation. It's pretty drinkable too, you can't tell the 7% ABV when you're drinking it. Overall it's a pretty good beer. Easily the best pumpkin ale I've tried so far."
"Beer poured a nice strong copper color. This is a very impressive presentation after the pour. Mild creamy white head had some good retention. There was mild lacing around the glass. Smells clean, light, and sweet. There are many different hints of cinnamon, malt, and nutmeg. Very pleasant smelling beer. Light pumpkiny flavors come into the nose on a deep smell. Great first taste with a light malty bouquet. Mild pumpkin flavor not extremely over powering. 7% ABV is hiding quite well. Maybe thats why it comes in a four pack. Hints of cinnamon and caramel malt flavor. Brown sugary mix on the tongue. Very nice mouth feel and drink ability. Mild after taste of pumpkin pie. Great seasonal offering for the fall. This beer really captures the autumn feeling and a great Birthday this September, 16th 2006! I recommend giving this one a try. Not your ordinary pumpkin brew. Dogfish makes another winner for me!"
"A nice maltiness displayed here, but the pumpkin flavor is merely a detail. Interesting enough to buy a 4pk for the novelty of a 7% abv Pumpkin Ale."
"Drinkability: Again, nothing special. I guess it might be sessionable, but I'm not sure if I'd want to try it."
"Punkin' Ale definitely nails the head on the style. This is a must have fall beer, and one I highly recommend."
"Wow! I still can't get over how smooth this is. This easily rivals my favorite pumpkin ale and presents a new benchmark in smooth, spicy flavor."
"D: Very good drinkability. It's usually tough to drink more than one or two pumpkin ales in a row. That's not the case with this beer. Excellent stab at the style."
"Drinkability - Easy to consume and looking forward to another"
"Nice reddish mahogany color with a soft white head. Aroma is rather light, though pleasantly spicy. Plenty of malt at first taste, with just enough bitterness to offset it, and a very nice, well-balanced spiciness. The cinnamon is particularly subtle but delightful. This is probably the best-balanced pumpkin beer I've ever tried. Very nice."
"A clear amber colour in the glass. Big foamy head that settled down quickly. Some lacing in the glass. Nice aroma with nutmeg, cinamon, pumkin and brown sugar noticeable. Flavour is sweet but spicy. Soft malt and pumpkin with a bitter pepper and spicy finish. The pumpkin flavour is subtle and doesn't overpower. Probably the best pumpkin ale I've tried. Makes me think of thanksgiving and cool autumn evenings."
"Pours a perfectly clear gold-amber with a nice head that retains well. Smell is pretty good. Nice aromas of sugar/spice cookie, cinnamon, nutmeg and obviously pumpkin pie. Taste is a myriad of spices and obviously pumpkin. Subtle notes of citrus perceived. Mouthfeel has a dough-like presence as the beer is full in texture with a medium-full body. The brew finishes in a swath of spice and cooked """punkin""". Not too bad, certainly a good spiced beer. To me it gets a little bogged down in it's spiciness. Maybe it's because it isn't fall yet, I don't know. Still enjoyable and recommended."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability: It's obviously not an every-day beer, but for an off-beat beer it's pretty accessible and there's enough complexity to appeal to serious beer drinkers, as well."
"I wish I would have poured this into a glass because if Dogfish Head does anything right, they just look cool. This beer tasted pretty good, I only had one as a result as it was given to me from my boss to try out, but that one I had was above average. It didn't have an overwhelming pumkin taste, in fact it was kind of understated, at least as far as other beer lovers have lead me to expect. The smell was another thing, however. The smell was very very good. A strong aroma yet you weren't knocked over by the alcohol smell."
"Medium body, light carbonation. Good balance. I like that the pumpkin isn't overwhelming like some other examples I've had. Nice overall blending of flavors. More of a alcohol kick than I was expecting....but it's hidden pretty well. Drinkability is good, but probably only one in a sitting."
"Drinks allright, I'd say this probably if not the best pumpkin ale I've tasted. I usually ain't too wild about them. Maybe because of the way DFH used a brown ale base, it works for me. I can see whipping a few of these out turkey or Christmas day!"
"This is a spicey, sweet brew that is really easy to drink. Nice way to get ready for the fall season."
"D: A bit too high in abv for me to consider drinking too many of these at a time, but this was nice. I'll still reach for the Post Road/Brooklyn pumpkin ale first (7 bucks a sixer for the Post Road is FAR cheaper than what six of these would cost in my neck of the woods), but this was pretty good."
"D- I have had few pumpkin style ales before and I could only drink one at most because it was so sweet or didn't seem like beer. This one is different and hits the mark for style in my opinion. I can drink these all night. It is so smooth and doesn't overwhelm the taste buds. This one is a winner."
"D - I wonder if can age, to bring the flavors together....That is what I am hoping."
"If you're looking for an overly pumpkin, thick desert style beer, this isn't the one. Very drinkable. A very nice """ale", but not a great pumpkin ale. As NJPadrefan said before, I would definitely go for Brooklyn's Post Road over this offering from Dogfish."
"I dont think I would order this one again. I didnt care for it in the bottle and I dont care for it on tap."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: This beer beer has a creamy medim body. This beer was very easy to drink. I enjoyed the beer in terms of a spiced herbal beer experience. I didnt get any pumpkin smells or flavors to this beer. I will buy it again as a good herb/ spice beer. I had the beer cold and nearing room temperature. The beer seemed to wake up nearing room temperature. I still didnt get any good pumpkinness out of the beer."
"Appearance looks great! A clear crisp and inviting brownish orange with a thin foamy head with a strong lacing. Smell is strange and sour with pumkin flavors. The taste is very sour pumkin rind flavor with the sweeter pumkin aftertaste, I'm not fond of this style I don't think. Mouthfeel is a bit watery and light bodied with much carbonation. Overall this was a bit dissapointing and I don't think I'll ever try this again."
"it's lively and sticky: slightly spritzy but syrupy. funny aftertaste, too. i think maybe i don't like pumpkin beers. oh yeah, and it doesn't resemble a brown ale in any way"
"The problem is that DFH brown ale is one of the great great beers around. This is not as good. Go with the brown ale DFH."
"Give me a Post Road!!"
"Purchased from Spirit Haus in Amherst Massachusetts. Poured from the bottle into a pint glass a nice orange color, and a nicely sized white heading, that quickly faded to a thin lacing. Aroma was pleasing, with some definite pumpkin pie presence, as well as other spices. My only complaint with the smell was there seemed to be a somewhat sopay presence to it, not becoming at all. Taste was about as close as ive seen to a brewery really capturing the pumpkin taste without making it seem too artificial. Mouthfeel was relatively medium in size. As for dinkability, one was enough for me. Even though I have the utmost respect for this breweries attempt at the style, it is simply one that ive never really enjoyed too much. I suppose if you are interested in the style, this might be a good starting point. This is the best example of the style ive tried to date, and even then I wasn't very impressed."
"Punkin' Ale pours a medium copper color with an off white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The first thing I catch in the smell is clove. I think there is some pumpkin and other spices also noticeable, but clove really dominates to me. The taste also seems dominated by clove. Other pumkin pie spices are also present in the background. Definitely worth a try."
"Overall: Flavorful and pumpkin pie-ish without being a spice overload. A nicely done Pumpkin Ale."
"D: I cant seem to put this down. Very surprised. Thought I wouldnt like this beer to much, seeing as I have never had a good pumpkin ale. I keep on drinking and the 7% abv? I think thats a myth..."
"The drink ability is very good, in fact this is a beer is unsurpassed as an example in this style is."
"Seeing this beer with a date on bottle of 8/7/06 only means that fall is on the way. Pours a nice amber colored with a fluffy head that leaves some lacing behind. The smell is amazing on this finely crafted brew, let me first say that I'm a big pumpkin fan, any type from seeds to pie to just eating the damn thing while carving it. I can smell a very strong spiced pumpkin smell, like when you first start carving one and sticking your mug directly inside the pumpkin, also smell a bit of clove sweetness in there, I truly love the smell of this crafted beer and whish they would bottle it as a cologne. The taste is awesome what I smell I taste, just with that bit of hop bitterness that we all love from those crafters at Dogfish, awesome. Don't be fooled when you drink that 4 pack and wonder why it went down so smooth, the alcohol is so well hidden that I can't even detect it. Seeing this just makes me smile knowing that summer is over and fall is upon us, simply beautiful."
"Clear, deep copper colour. Thin head dissolves into a pillowy ring that lingers on. Light roasty malt hits the nose initially, reminds me of an Oktoberfest lager. Inhaling more deeply the faint pumpkin spice notes become evident, nice and cinnamony. The taste carries a toasted malt flavor with a decent sweetness. The pumpkin spice is again very subtle. The finish has a slight sour/bitter touch to it. Not very alcoholic though. Decent brew overall, better than other pumpkin beers I've tried, although it could have had a little more of that flavor to it. I think I would try it again."
"Pours a golden, nearly completely clear, pumpkin-orange, with little to no foam. Very light carbonation. Smells of candy corns dipped in maple syrup. Most of the punkin in this beer comes out in the taste. To me, it tastes more like lager yeast than an ale yeast. Starts with a well-balanced, light malt sweetness and ends with everything on the label (pumpkin, brown sugar, allspice, cinnamon and nutmeg). Much more mellow, in a good way, from what I would expect from DFH. Smooth, light (maybe a little too light, believe it or not) and balanced mouthfeel. Definitely easy to drink. Unlike other pumpkin ales that Ive had, its not overwhelmed with pumpkin pie spice to a point where you cant finish a bottle. Pleasantly surprised, though not super excited."
"However this is still a good beer but may just be a bad batch. Will definitely drink again in the near future and for years to come."
"Gorgeous color, a bright orange-amber with subtle carbonation. Smell is pleasant and strong, lots of nutmeg in the nose. Really enjoy the taste, very sweet, pumpkin flavor really comes through (which is nice for a change in a pumpkin ale), and doesn't overpower any of the other flavors. Mouthfeel is good, light and bubbly. Aftertaste is very pronounced. It's sweet so I wouldn't want to drink a case of it in a row, but it's just an outrageously good beer when you're in the mood to enjoy something complex. Probably the best Autumnal seasonal I have ever had."
"Once agian, dogfish does not disappoint. Nice pumpkin ale that isn't overly """pumpkin-ey""". Balanced well by spice, this is a nice subtle beer from DFH, not the typical in you face monster they are known and loved for. Very nice all around."
"Nice easy-to-drink spicy brown ale with a bit of a kick. Good representation of the style."
"Drinkability: One of my favorite styles for the fall, and something I get excited about when the time comes near. This is one of the better styles you can get, and though it's slightly pricey at about $9 a 4-pack, it's a tasty treat, one that you can manage to spread over a few days with the ABV being 7%. Thanks for the first pumpkin beer I've had in anticipation of the fall season. Keep bringin' it, DFH."
"Farily drinkable except for the mildly annoying aftertaste. Although, I'm not a huge fan of spiced ales, so I was suprised that I liked it as well as I did. I could drink this again - probably next year...."
"The sight of this beer is a good sign that summer is on the way out. I had this years edition at the brewery in Milton last week. The beer poured a hazy dark orange color with a medium tan head and solid lacing. The aroma is spicey. Nutmeg and cinnamon dominate the nose but also leave way for a pumpkin aroma. The taste is equally spicey and some really good pumpkin flavor but is it not overwhelming and doesn't taste like a slice of pumpkin pie, it tastes like a pumpkin beer and that is why I enjoy the DFH brew so much. It is well balanced and has a nice mouthfeel and they do a very good job of hiding the 7% abv."
"Perfect light amber color with a small whitish head that is gone within the minute leaving nothing. I suppose this isn't surprising given the light and fizzy body. Smells like sweet maple syrup - maybe a touch or coriander thrown in for good measure. Tastes, ah, shucks. Bummer. Well, you know, I read the bottle and I was expecting a horror like the Shipyard. Thankfully, it's not that. The spices are light and easy. Ok, half way through the bottle I now get a whiff of pumpkin pie spice on the nose. But the flavor... It's awfully dry (and crisp) - which I find very surprising. Then there are these Thanksgiving spices floating around, and all, but there is an overwhelming sour note to it all. Is that the hops? Do I have a bad bottle? I don't know! I don't know what it's supposed to taste like! I'll certainly be fair and give this one another go at some point, but, whoa."
"D: With a beer like this, you are always going to have that cinnamon flavor in your mouth for a while, its just par for the course. Take the good with the bad. This would be a great Thanksgiving dinner beer"
"Pours a nice clear dark orange / amber color with a thin off white head. Smells almost like a pumpkin pie. Pumpkin, nutmeg, allspice and slight bready aroma. The taste follows the smell... pumpkin and spices blend nicely. The best tasting pumpkin ale I have had. Creamy mouthfeel but a tad thin. This would be a good beer for a crisp fall evening."
"orangey brown. clear and bubbly. small head. nutmegs and spices and hot pumpkins on the nose. taste is not as terrible as ive anticipated. some cimmamon and nutmeg flavors but mostly pumpkin. kind of like drinking a liquified pumpkin pie. a little thin and i dont need to ever drink another, but its certainly the best pumpkin ale ive tried."
"D: It goes down easy and there’s almost no hint of the 7.00% ABV. If you don’t find it filling (and I don’t) you could drink a lot more than a 4-pack in one sitting. When I went into the liquor store, I didn’t expect to buy this beer, but it was on special and the price made it irresistible, given the rep of DFH. While I liked the beer and it was more than what I expected from a beer of this style, it’s not something I would want to drink very often. However, if I do decide to drink it, I’d make short work of the 4-pack."
"Clear, dark oranger copper body with a finger of loose, slightly fizzy, off-khaki head. Sugar wafer malt and rummy fruit aromas give way to whiffs of pumpkin pie, allspice, cinnamon, and a bit of nutmeg. Smells like the spice rack fell in the pot. Not overpowering though; I think the fruity alcohol helps the spice smell and taste less artificial. Lightly toasted malt flavors combine with sweet pears and pie crust. Spices, especially nutmeg and allspice throughout, and most notably toward the finish. Nice complexity and quite tasty. Medium bodied ale, with a relatively lively feel that helps fight any cloying or spiced-out tendencies. Light toasted malt in the finish and residual spicy sweetness and a maybe some orange peel/marmalade. I can't imagine drinking pint after pint of this, but this is definitely the best pumpkin beer I've had (so far)."
"Cheers2Beers"
"cheers..."
"small lacey head, orangey. Spicey cinammon, spicey,allspice, nutmeg, some maltness spice chest, chia tea with some hop bitterness. Drying, very vegatable taste. No expiry date. Gourdy taste. This tastes like a beer rather a fruity sweety cooler.Medium to full mouthfeel."
"I definitely would not drink more than one!"
"Bottled on date of 08/25/05 is printed on the neck of the bottle."
"Has a """packaged in""" date on the side which is useless since it wasn't actually marked. Nose is mellow, pumpkin pie spicy. Pours an orange amber color with minimal head. No lacing during consumption. Carbonation is low, mouthfeel on the lighter side of creamy. The taste is spicy, but nicely balanced with the hops. The finish leaves a spicy note on the tongue and ends with a pronounced bitterness. Overall a pretty nice beer."
"This beer poured a pleasant golden brown with a thick white head. It smelled spicy and fruity. The flavor was spicy like cinnamon or cloves, slightly sweet and mellow with a sharp bitter finish. I really liked the spices and it had a great aroma, but the biterness was a bit more than I prefer in a beer of this type. overall I liked this beer."
"Rich amber color with little head. Aroma is very spicy, full of nutmeg, cinnamon, and a little brown sugar. The spices are also prevalent in the taste, but also some pumpkin and a little vanilla. Medium bodied, with the perfect amount of carbonation. I usually enjoy pumpkin beers, this is a favorite of mine!"
"Lots of spicey flavors as mentioned in the smell. Nutmeg, clove, allspice, cinnamon. Some pumpkin flavors in there as well. Fruity malt behind all the above. Some hops in the finish, medium bodied and lightly sour. Pretty easy drinker around the holidays. I have found my new regular for my once-a-year pumkin ale fix!"
"One of the best, if not the best Pumpkin Ale around. The soft orange color of this beer with it's intense carbonation and mighty head is quite appealing. Aromas of pumpkins, roasted malts, and seasonal spices come out. Together, the aromas remind me of fallen leaves, a cool breeze, and the season of Fall. The taste is smooth and sweet with the pumpkin flavor taking a back seat to various spices. The sweet flavor is never overly dominant or too sweet. The carbonation adds a level or richness that exploits the spicy backbone. A very interesting beer that can be had with mildly sweet fruit-based desserts like tarts and parfaits or with seasonal dishes."
"Cloudy honey-orange in color. Zesty off-white head lasts and clings to the glass. Aromas chock full of canned pumpkin pie mix, liberally doused with some nutmeg and other spices. Flavor translated well. Pumpkin flavor comes through very nicely, unlike other pumpkin ales I've tried. Sweet malty companion adds to the character. Solid mouthfeel. Not thin at all. Hard to believe this is 7%. Drinkable. Well-done."
"Very drinkable, dangerously so! I could knock back a six-pack on a cool fall day. I am very impressed with this beer. I now want to taste more beers like this I wonder if any can match it. Ive heard good things about a couple other Pumpkin Ales; I will try them next fall. I want to thank RedHaze for the bottle. It was lovely stuff, thanks! To nonbelievers try this Pumpkin Ale. You will convert."
"I employed a very gentle pour as I was not sure whether any lees were present. I could not see any, but that means nothing. I had no head initially, but I swirled it and got a finger of tawny head that lasted only briefly. Color was Amber to Deep-amber (SRM = > 9, < 13) with NE-quality clarity. Nose had really evolved to the point that the cinnamon and nutmeg stood out like a pair of sore thumbs! Spicy. Mouthfeel was medium and the carbonation was nothing like I had noted in its on-tap form. I liked this a bit better, actually. The taste was mellow, very spicy, but not as intense as it may have been. This really seemed to have aged well over the decade-plus. It took on a brandy-like quality that I found quite interesting. The label reads """7% Alc. by Vol.", but it was packing some heat. The spices really dried it out to the point that pumpkin and brown sugar were afterthoughts. It was bitingly dry and still slightly hot, reinforcing my brandy idea, but I may revise that to """sherry""". Either way, it was different!"
"The body is fairly big in this beer: nice and thick and velvety smooth. Honestly, I think this is the best Dogfish Head beer I've tried, and I've had almost all of the non-retired, non-uber-special releases. If not the best, it's definitely the most interesting. I would drink more of this stuff if it was available, but I don't think it was quite good enough where I would seek it out in an online purchase again. If I see it in a store, though, it's mine... Keep in mind I'm not a fan of pumpkin beers, and for the most part I think Dogfish is just slightly overrated."
"Notes: A good fall seasonal. This style complements salty food very well due to its sweetness. The beer balances the flavors of most meats. Dogfish Head succeeds in producing a quality pumpkin ale that is a truly unique beer experience."
"Taste; there's definitely pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg and maybe some allspice. Even with all of the spices in this beer it's not as overwhelmingly sweet as some other pumpkin ales I've had. Mouthfeel was a litlle thin, and there's not much carbonation. Kudos to DFH for making a pumpkin beer that actually tastes like it's a beer."
"Punkin' Ale is one of the better versions that I've run across. It doesn't seriously challenge my clear favorite (Smuttynose Pumpkin), but it's definitely worthwhile and is deliciously different. If you have any interest in the style whatsoever, I suggest you get Punk'd as soon as possible."
"Prickly, carbonated mouthfeel just short of being too much. Great action that brings out the individual flavor notes. Quite drinkable for a pumpkin ale. The alcohol isn't detracting at all but it certainly does not go uinnoticed."
"12 oz. bottled in '05. Pours reddish/amber with a thin tan head that reduces to almost nothing. Smells of cinnamon, allspice, faint pumpkin, sweet malts, and some nutmeg, but it's not as strong as I'd like. It has a medium body that is a a bit tingly and a flavor similar to the aroma but with additions of roasted malts, green/citric hops, some bitterness and alcohol. Above average, but not the best."
"The nuttiness of most brown ales is replaced by the pumkin flavors and complimented well with the cinnamon, nutmeg, and spicey flavors. This isnt a beer I can have more than 1 or 2 of, but a very well crafted beer."
"This beer was very smooth throughout, nice silky full mouthfeel. The nose pretty much confirms the flavor throughout the beer, with spicy and sweet hints. They didn't overdo the pumpkin, but there is enough where a first timer may say """Hmm, Pumpkin Ale. Interesting""" I would recommend it to anyone, as it is probably the nicest pumpkin ale I've had. I'm a convert now to this beer style. DogFishHead, nice job once again."
"This is the second pumpkin ale I have tried, and, it is the best so far. Highly recommend for its unique flavor."
"One of the best pumkin ales I have tried. This one is right up there with Post Road. I would love to try both of them side by side sometime."
"Mouthfeel is medium and carbonation is medium-low, a good and almost creamy combination that melds well with the flavor. This beer tastes good for what it is, and I'm glad I tried it, but since I'm not a pumpkin pie fan I'm not sure I'd want more than one of these in a session. Also, as it warms the alcohol really pokes itself through; I think 10 minutes out of the fridge might have been better. I'd rather have one of these than a slice of pie, though!"
"Would I have this again? Yes but if I had a Rocky River Monster Mash in front of me this would lose badly."
"In terms of drinkability, I only had a half pint, but I could definitely have another. Based on my positive experience with this beer, I will be drinking more Pumpkin Ale in the future."
"Slàinte!"
"Poured a golden amber, with a modest tan head of dense bubbles, relaxing to a collar, and leaving modest lacing. Lots of spiciness such as clove, allspice, and nutmeg. There is also malt sweetness and spiky hops. The spice is bold on the tongue, followed by hops. The malt starts to show as well, but it is the hops and other spices that seem to come to the forefront. Nice mouthfeel, mild carbonation, this is a nice pumpkin ale, but I did not find much in the way of pumpkin in the flavor. Nicely balanced, this is a nice beer for those cooler afternoons spent outside around a fire."
"--Joey"
"As a spice ale, pretty good.. As Pumpkin, doesn't do it for me."
"This is one of the best Pumpkin Ales I have sampled to date. Unlike Blue Moon, Post Road (yes, I know it is brewed by Brooklyn--and I usually really like their products), Dogfish head uses a brown ale base (I'm guessing their Indian Brown), which gives this punkin' a little more complexity and body than some of the competitors. Likewise, the slightly higher ABV (7%) helps cuts a lot of the potentially cloying sweetness created from the allspice, etc., resulting in a tasty seasonal ale. I usually enjoy the punk for about a month, then it is time for it to retire for another year...until the breeze turns crisp and I start to think of Autumn seasonals one more time. Speaking of seasonals...Mad Elf coming soon!"
"Goes excellent with chocolate."
"($7.99 / 4-pack)"
"Recommended by me but your girlfriend might not like it as much as a BA will."
"Trick or treat? This is one is a treat!"
"This Dogfish offering poured a bright orange with a golden hue. Head was smallish and lacing was minimal. Aroma consisted of brown sugar, ginger, and some caramel sauce. Taste lacked the pumpkin I was looking for. Lots and lots of brown sugar, way too much for my liking. This is overly sweet. Body is on the thin side, even after it warmed. Finish is a little tart almost and the alcohol gets noticed a bit. This just isn't my cup of tea, I had this along with four other pumpkin ales and it didn't really impress. The Michigan Brewing Co.'s offering was way better."
"Drikability is excellent. I enjoyed 5 of these to myself and still wanted more. You really can't go wrong with this one."
"This is a nice try by Dogfish Head but I must regretfully report that I'm still looking for a pumpkin ale I can drink easy and clean all autumn."
"another example of a fine brewery!! dogfish head punkin' ale is the best of the pumpkin beers i've had!"
"Interesting beer. Even though it's not exactly my cup o' tea (or rather my pint o' ale), I find it strangely intriguing. Rich like fall foliage. And the draft I tried a few weeks ago was even better."
"Mouth feel is light to medium bodied and is highly carbonated which hinders the drinkability for me."
"Ooh.. love the neon orange 4-pack box. What a fine statement of punk! The beer is good too, one of the best of it's kinds actually. A tad sweet for me personally, but I think it should remain high ranked for the pumpkin-ale style of brew. Enjoy it while carving out a demonic little jack-o-lantern, and watch out for the 7.0% ABV!"
"overall: this is an excellent pumpkin ale. definitely deserves higher ratings. very tasty and drinkable and perfect for the season. i'm not a big octoberfest fan, but this makes me want to search out more pumpkins to sample. excellent must try for the style."
"This is a genre that I'm not a big fan of.This is a fine dark amber looking beer with a big two finger head.You can really smell the brown sugar,cinnamon,and pumpkin.This tastes exactly like it smells.This is the only pumpkin ale I've had that you can have on a day other than Thanksgiving.This tastes very good and festive,but more importantly,it's not overly spiced.So many of this type are.This has a nice full m/f and it's a beer that I could watch the leaves change and fall with a full pint."
"Pours an amber/brown color with an off-white head. Smells very nice- like a pumpkin pie or other pumpkin dessert with lots of spices- cinnamon and nutmeg. Tastes much like it smells. Nice sweet malt but with substantial spice and pumpkin flavors- very tastey. Mouthfeel is nice and creamy with light carbonation. Definitely drinkable and great in autumn and for halloween and thanksgiving."
"Clear and bright amber-orange color with a small off white head that doesn't last, not much lacing either, aroma of cinnamon and allspice. Pumpkin , ginger, nutmeg and cinnamon flavors. Medium body with a smooth and creamy mouthfeel, not overdone with spices. Very drinkable for 7% alcohol, I will try to get another bottle."
"This is one of the best Pumpkin Ale I've ever tasted. This ale pours a nice amber color. As I lifted the glass to my nose I smelled some great spicey, nutty, pumpkin essence. The first sip just accentuates all the previous aromas I talked about. Honey, pumpkin, floral, spice (cinnamon, nutmeg, brownsugar). It is very drinkable and smooth a def must try."
"Overall: I have had one or two other pumpkin brews and didn't like them so I almost didn't buy this the other day; then I decided to grab it anyways and am very glad that I did. An excellent brew for those cooler late autumn evenings before the winter beers are released. Well done!"
"Burnt orange 'with a rapidly disappearing head. Nose is dominated by a bready malt scent with a touch of cinnamon (sans sugar). Taste is spicy malts, but no discerning traditional pumpkin flavor. Like a Fall Warmer if such a brew existed. Tastes like a nutmeg brew. Medium mouthfeel that is quite satisfying. This is an easy quaffer, dangerously so at 8%. I thought last year's version was much tastier."
"This is my favorite of all of the pumpkin ales that i have tried. very nice orange, brown color, not much head and little lacing. The smell is great, tones of pumpkin and pumpkin pie spice are prevalent. Flavor wise, it could have more pumpkin but the spice is still very much present, nutmeg, cinnamon, even a bit of clove. light to medium bodied, i could drink a few of these and still be loving it. Quite a vast difference between this and say shipyard or blue moon - blah!"
"Strong alcohol backbone, and DOES taste surprisingly like pumpkin pie. No aftertaste to speak of, for better or worse."
"As to the drinkability, I will most definitely buy more of this brew. Hopefully it is still available by the time I go to pick up beer again."
"Pours a clear orange/brown, virtually no head, and no lace. Smell is nutmeg, sweet rich malt, some pumpkin, rich malt, some cinnamon. Taste is sweet malt, lots of spice, little bit of pumpkin and a little alcohol. Mouthfeel is smooth and medium bodied, medium carbonation, warming. Not bad but disappointing."
"Overall: Possibly the best pumpkin ale out there. I expected nothing less from DFH! Great fall time brew that really is an experience to drink on a nice, cool, late fall day."
"Not what I was expecting and not one of the better DFH beers IMO. Didn't have any real pumpkin flavor and smell. Alcohol was fairly well pronouced as I warm up after drinking this brew. An easy drinker but not one that I will seek again."
"Not bad, and I'll drink it again. But so far my top prize for this style of beer stays with Weyerbacher."
"Drinkability: Well, still not my style. This appears to be an alright beer, but I'm just not converted to the style by it."
"Pours the color of autumn, falling leaves, a crimson sunset color with a good amount of thick lacing. Bready pumpkin pie, nutmeg and raisins fill the nose. Flavor is reminiscent of Irish soad bread (could be the raisins again) and darker fruits, a hint of anise(?) to go along with a so-unartificial pumpkin flavor and spices. Hops and alcohol are present in the finish; a nice compliment to the chewy malt. Finishes slightly dry, leaving you wanting more, provided you're into the kickass pumpkin ale you're imbibing. Light carbonation, utterly smooth and easy drinking. Being that the Southampton version isn't widely available (my true fave of the style), this is the standard. Great stuff."
"D- Very nice, a great fall brew, alcohol shows its legs after an entire bottle"
"I really wanted to like this beer so that I could say it was """just like Grandma used to make""" and point out how subtley macabre that phrase is--USED to make? Why doesn't she make it anymore? What happened to Grandma?!--but oh well."
"A unique brew that has a combination of flavors that might be a little too much. The pumpkin and spices are a nice mix but, a bit over the top. The pour is a nice foam and large head. It certainly reminds me of a thanksgiving day with pumkin pie. The taste is probably the best characteristic about this brew."
"D- This is a good solid beer that has some spice added to it. Most beers in this style tend to put the spice before the beer. This also has a good alcohol warmth to support the malt and spices. The smell was a bit of a put-off but faded."
"Drinkability and Overall: For this time of year (especially with it being 50 degrees out right now), this beer is quite nice. God I love fall beers, I just can't wait till winter. Anyways, easily one of the better Pumpkin Ales I've had."
"The beer has a well hidden 7.0 % ABV and any caramel sweetness is well countered by the 24 IBU hops."
"Very slick mouthfeel. Medium body and light carbonation."
"I haven't had many pumpkin ales but after drinking this one I am very eager to try more."
"Pours a dark coppery-orange color with a pillowy white head that quickly dissipates into a thin covering. Good carbonation, lotsa bubbles rising forth. I smell a malty pumpkin aroma. Taking a sip, I get a lot of spice (cinnamon & allsipce), malt, pumpkin and a hint of brown sugar. Nice medium mouthfeel. Overall, a nice harbinger of fall, brings on thoughts of football, Thanksgiving dinner, and changing leaves. Dogfish Head goes out on a limb and scores another winner!"
"Well, like I said, I dont think this year's Dogfish Head Punkin is as good as last year's, but it is still the #1 pumpkin ale, as far as I'm concerned, and well worth the $7 / 4-pack."
"Much warmer and heartier than the other pumpkin ales I have had - which tend to be more watery. This makes it an ideal start to the fall season."
"An impressive offering that is highly recommended!"
"Nice, is all I can say. Wish I had bought more than one."
"Overall this is one sturdy and well crafted pumpkin ale. I'm starting to look very much toward seeing this ale surface in my town this time of year - well worth the wait. This is probably the best bottled pumpkin ale I've had in my 10+ years of drinking craft brew."
"Would be good with a big dinner served this time of year of Turkey and stuffing.... :-)"
"I do believe that DFH is/has expanded too quickly as I think they can be inconsistent. But when you get down to it or not, DFH is a prety good brewer. This pumpkin is very good-excellent for the style."
"all in all, above average pumpkin brew....had been wanting to try this for a while so I was excited to find it"
"Dogfish Head Punkin' Ale pours a clear redish orange with a thin off-white head. Small bubble rise throughout. Aroma is heavy on the nutmeg, with some cinnamon and allspice as well. Taste is slightly sweet, with more of the above spices and some slight (maybe imagined) pumpkin flavors. Spices are not overwhelming, however. Amazingly, this beer has a hint of hops in the finish - much different from other pumpkin ales I have had. Fuller bodied than most others as well. Quite drinkable, but maybe a bit strong to have more than a couple in an evening."
"Starting to like pumpkin beers... a lot. Pours a vibrant and glowing brown color. Slim head. Nose is full of pumpkin pie spice. Feel like I am at my momma's Thanksgiving Day table. Flavor is full of the same and quickly followed by some plump pumpkin tones. I am gonna have to put a few bottles of this away for Turky Day and momma's pie. Mouthfeel is light and very pleasant. Very drinkable, nice dessert beer."
"D - Drinkability is middle of the road, it goes down easy and smooth, but afterwards you won't be amped for another. It is good, but you either need a fall gathering or be really in the mood for it."
"poured a medium copper color with moderate white puffy head that fell to moderate ring. Left some clinginess to the sides of the glass. Smell is a mixture of spiciness and alcohol. Taste is very dissapointing because there seems to be more of the pumpkins spices (nutmeg, cinnamon) prrsent than actual pumpkin taste. Finish is also too dry for my liking with an odd taste present that seems almost like seltzer water?? The taste hides the 7% alcohol very well, but this was not what I was expecting."
"Pours an attractive ruddy amber/brown with a short khaki bubbly head. Smells delicious, sweet and spicey, caramel malts maybe a little bubblegum. Taste is much more like genuine pumpkin pie and less like pumpkin puree compared to O'Fallon's offering. Caramel malts lay down the brown ale backbone, with well-integrated infusions of nutmeg, cinnamon, and pumpkin pie filling. This is a desert of a beer. On the sweet side, but does so quite well. Mouthfeel is full for a brown, but still velvety smooth. I could drink a couple more of these no problem, but probably not more than that. This is a damn tasty brew, easily superior to O'Fallon. Just like Grandma used to make. Try it if you can find it."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and fairly dry in the finish...no lingering """off""" flavors which makes this offering from DFH highly drinkable. I should know b/c I drank this one among others all day and night this past weekend...and it still tastes great."
"2005 edition. 12 oz bottle pours a clear orange/copper amber with a small beige head. Good retention and some patchy lacing. Cinnamon and allspice fronnt a bold array of pie spices that assault the nose. Not at all timid. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with strong carbonation and some spicy bite. Tastes like pumpkin pie, with some essence of fresh pumpkin, caramel malt, and aggressive pie spicing. Some mild heat from the 7% abv adds to the fresh baked pumpkin pie effect. Spices dominate all the way through, however, and are a bit overdone. Still, nicely drinkable and always one of the better pumpkin ales to be found."
"Overall impression: This one was a Monday morning post-Oktoberfest hair of the dog. Very tasty - great for desert (or breakfast!). Definitely one of the best pumpkin beers I have tried."
"Drinkability is decent. One of the better pumpkin beers out there."
"Drinkability -- Of all of the pumpkin beers I've tried this year, this is the most drinkable. I could probably handle three bottles at most in one sitting. The pumpkin style is not one you can stick to all night. There is a slight possibility I may buy another four-pack before the fall is over."
"Finish is heavy on the cinnamon. Not as sweet as I thought it would be, (that's good), But the cinnamon kind of overpowers everything in the end. One is enough for me."
"My favorite pumpkin beer. Well, one of two that are distributed in my town, so I guess that's not saying much. But it's still an excellent beer, as far as beers go."
"The spicing level and the fullness of this beer designate this a bit more than a quaffing brew, slow sips seem mandatory, and I would be hard pressed to down a glass of this beer. This is all ok though, as I dont mind savoring the interplay of spice and caramelized sugar notes. Where is the pumpkin? I am not too sure, as is typical in spiced versions the pumpkin is really not noticeable. This beer is quite enjoyable and is one of the better examples of the style that I have had."
"A pretty well-balanced pumpkin beer. I think I like it a little better than the Cottonwood one, which I drank a few of last year at this time before our ABV cap was lifted."
"Overall a very good beer. The best pumpkin beer I have had."
"This is my first pumpkin ale, and I'd have to say it's pretty good. The spices are pronounced, but not overbearing. The pumpkin is somewhat muted, but present. I'd say this is well balanced, and pretty damn yummy!"
"A beer that pours a deep copper color. A slight copper-ish/tan head on top. Fades to a thin lace then spotty patches. So far so good but after the appearance, this beer falls apart. Aroma is of spice, nutmeg cinnamon a bit of malt but very little pumpkin. I found it (the pimpkin) hard to find. Taste matches the aroma. Where is the pumpkin? I was hoping for a gritty earthy tone of the pumpkin to complement the spices but was let down. Medium body and carbonation. Drinkability is great if youre into spiced beers but as for a pumpkin beer goesthere are better"
"John"
"Overall = By far the best pumpkin ale I've had. I look forward to soon comparing this one against Smuttynose's version."
"Pours a dark copper hue with a thin beige head that dissapates quickly. Aroma is pumpkin, spices, sweet caramel malt, and vanilla. Flavor begins with a light pumpkin and spices flavor followed by a slightly sweet malt character, and a lightly bitter hops profile and a bit of an alcohol bite in the finish. Interesting, but not very pumpkin tasting and overall not impressive. Mouthfeel is crisp with medium body and moderate carbonation. Descent but there are cheaper local pumpkin brews that are superior (Cottonwood)."
"Flavor is slightly sweet and heavy on the nutmeg and allspice over the pumpkin, but this is often the case in pumpkin ales and doesn't really bother me. It's by no means an overspiced mess. My one real complaint with the taste is that the alcohol is a bit hot and apparent for my liking. Overall, though, this one shows a good amount of restraint and makes a pleasant-drinking pumpkin brew."
"Of course, the fact that it tries to be a badass while being a sweet lil' pumpkin only adds to the joy."
"Pours a clear, orange, coppery, brown with a small lite tan head with a creamy swirl that remains throughout. Smells amazing, lots of allspice sweetness. Wasn't as impressed with the taste. Wanted more pumpkin flavor. Maybe more cinnamon too. Some hop profile, seems floral. Has a hot flavor from the alcohol level. Almost tastes perfumey and pepperish. Mouthfeel is ok. Average malt body, with ok carbonation. Somewhat spicey on the lips. Warming too. Overall drinkability, I've had better. This is ok, but I think it needs to be pared with something to tone it down, like vanilla ice cream."
"Drinkability: Although I generally gravitate toward the German brews with their adherence to the restricted ingredients of malt, hops, water, and yeast, this is a pleasant, enjoyable ale typical for the creative brews produced by Dogfish Head."
"Drinkability: Are you kidding? I'll drink this until I see the Great Pumpkin. 7% ABV is hidden, and I'm sure I could put away the 4-pack before I knew it."
"Fruit beers generally taste gimmicky and imbalanced to me, but when they work, they're among my very favorites. Dogfish Head knows the trick. Along with the great Aprihop, Punkin' is one of the best fruit beers out there, and one of my favorite beers overall. Pumpkin is such a nice fruit to blend with beer. It doesn't overwhelm the beer or add cloying sweetness. It mixes perfectly with hops and other beer flavors. Punkin has nice spices, a subtle sweetness, a fantastic smell, and an aftertaste that is complex and endlessly pleasurable. I love this beer. Its use of pumpkin is nuanced enough to allow this to be a session beer. Although it's seasonal, it could be sipped year-round. It's that good, that smooth, and that well-made."
"I don't usually like novelty beers like pumpkin ales (they tend to hit you upside the head with too much spice), but this one is actually fairly pleasant."
"Wow. They put a lot of stuff in it to legitimize it per style. Looks creamy and carbonated coper to orange. Loosely knit carbonation that may fade, yet laces nicely. Smelly sweet fruity and malty albeit ordinary. Spiciness and sharpness give character. Tastes moderately sweet, yet gives extra complexity with allspice, cinnemon, ginger, pepper, nutmeg, and body building malts. Spices give a lot of complexity, yes still conveys hop balance and alcoholic warming through the body. Finishes a dry and harsh in the alcohol--fusal. Utimately a pumpkin flavored beer worth drinking. Dogfish Head is simply incapable of brewing a bad beer."
"Clear deep coppery orange, moderate off-white head. Aromas of cinnamon, pumpkin and malt, maybe a bit of something like nutmeg. Slightly aggressive carbonation, full, slightly viscous body. Pumpkin sweetness to start, some bitterness, blend of spices, very nice. Finishes very balanced, slight spiciness and alcohol warmth. Quite a drinkable brew. Definitely one of the best pumpkin beers I've had."
"Overall, a great pumpkin beer. DFH really knows their fruit beers, and this is no exception (although technicall a gord beer). Anyway, I've had this one several times and while it's a fine beer to drink on occasion, I just can't see drinking it on a regular basis (which is why the drinkability score is so low). That said, an good beer for the style, but not really up my alley."
"A very drinkable beer. Nice cozy feeling after finishing a couple, sort of like a nice buzz on Thanksgiving."
"Just a shade of filmy carbonation at start. Light brown to amber hue and crystalline. Pumpkin pie sweetness to nose, with all of the spices mentioned on the label  allspice, cinnamon, and nutmeg. On mouth, less pumpkin than expected, some strong malt character that lends it a medium body while the spices leave a lasting impression on the tongue. Eh, give me a CBC over this one any day of the week."
"I finally got around to drinking this one again. It poured a clear copper color with a white head that fell eventually to a ring around the glass. The smell was of cinnamon, nutmeg, and reminded me of pumpkin pie... go figure. The taste was surprisingly sweet, with heavy flavors of the spices and a some hops at the end. The mouthfeel was smooth, medium bodied and nicely carbonated. I couldn't drink more than two of these at one time, but overall, this was a fine example of a pumpkin ale. Next Thanksgiving I will be getting more of this."
"A unique take on the pumpkin ale style. Nice maltyness, but the spicing is a bit different - pronounced emphasis on allspice with a touch of spruce resin in the background. This really struck me as being more like a spiced Christmas ale, and called to mind this year's version of Anchor Our Special Ale (OSA light?). Very nicely done - intriguing. Thanks to far333 for the sample."
"On a footnote, I'm glad DFH isn't afraid to go out on a limb and be creative with beer, keep up the good work guys."
"A decent shot at a slightly rare style. Low filled bottle, and a copper color to the beer, despite the label saying it was a brown ale. Smells of spices, cinnamon and nutmeg mostly is what I get. Taste is not quite there, and there is a slight oxidized/vegetal/wet cardboard aftertaste. No hops that I can taste are present. Nice creamy mouthfeel, and very clean. A clean beer, but not something I'd search out again, especially at $2.59 a bottle."
"This bottle was proof that cellaring works. I had my first five, yeah five, Punkin in November 2004 and was not impressed. It was a decent brown ale but not a Pumpkin Ale. This bottle, however, was exceptional. A nice, clear amber beer with a sturdy two finger head that stuck to the glass and laced all the way down. Wonderful cinammon in the nose and on the tongue. Delicate, fruity hops in the finish created the need for another sip. I could have drank this all night but only had two left."
"The beer has now warmed and I'll dump the last bit in the glass (saved in case there was sediment). Yeah, I think there was sediment, but not alot. Smell is different now that the beer has warmed. The pumpkin character now prevails and, unfortunately, the wet cardboard has reached the smell. The clove is a bit stronger and the nutmeg a bit gentler, but it could be my taste buds acclimating. I'm also getting a faint nutty flavor that goes along with the caramel. This is a really good beer and I'm sad I have just one fine gulp left."
"Light copperery color, offwhite head. Malty aromatics with heavy pie spices including nutmeg, clove and cinnamon. Sweet flavor of pumpkin, nutmeg, cinnamon, all spice, roasted malt, caramel, slight hop bitterness. Medium palate, finishes syrupy. Overall, a pretty good brew, worth trying once."
"This was a Christmas gift from my Father, who is appreciating all the beer I have been letting him explore with... -My Dad who thought that he was finally a beer snob when he found Molson, but now is obsessed with Double Bastard! My darling Father who must have remembered me saying that I love Dogfish Head, and knows I call people Pumpkin, and gave me this 4pack at Christmas Eve. -Which was the first of the experiments with my beer opener beltbuckle (ask my horrified and wet friends, and ex-friends), and my punkin coated step-brother Ian...! -Well, everything was punkin coated, but hey, what are holidays for!"
"Crystal clear, golden amber color, with an off-white head that sticks around a little while (perhaps surprisingly long lasting given the 7% alcohol). Aroma features a dash of pumpkin spice and malt, and some slight fruity esters. The aroma is a little underwhelming in its intensity, however. The flavor is very nice, featuring a full bodied beer definitely tilted toward malt with complimentary pumpkin spice flavors taking the place of strong hoppy notes. Enough bitterness at the end to balance. A pretty good spiced ale, but I think it would be better if it were more spicy."
"This ale poured a clear, coppery color with off-white foam that settled quickly. The smell improved as the glass of beer warmed. It was slightly sweet and malty with hints of spices (allspice and cinnamon) and a whiff of alcohol. The taste was slightly sweet (brown sugar) up front followed by a tangy maltiness with a touch of spices (allspice and cinnamon?) and hops in the finish. There was a touch of alcohol and the hop bitterness and spices lingered in the finish. The mouthfeel was smooth and tangy with medium body and moderate carbonation with some pumpkin texture. It was ever so slightly warming as well. This was a decent pumpkin ale, and improved as it warmed up."
"Bottle: Poured a deep amber color ale with a medium head with below average retention. Aroma is quite spicy (probably some cinnamon and the pumpkin) with some malt also noticeable. Taste is also quite spicy with cinnamon being the most recognisable spices with some pumpkin on the side. Not bad but I wouldnt drink a whole lot of this either."
"poured a nice copper color with off white head that stayed around for a little while. aroma nice rich pumpkin pie like grandma use to make. flavors pumpkin cinnamon,nutmeg, nice smooth mouth feel. this is one of the better pumpkin beers I have had so far"
"Solid, but not spectacular."
"This is a good Pumkin beer--it is not overwhelmingly sweet but a very nice example of the style. I thought this was a very good beer that was worthy of another sample."
"This is one of the better special flavor beer."
"This beer sucks pumpkin ass."
"12 oz. bottle, packaged in 04. Pours a slight hazy amber liquid with a thick foamy off-white head. A few small bubbles coming off the bottom of the glass. Good head retention, there was a fair amount of lace on the glass. Smells of pumpkin pie spices, cinnamon, nutmeg, etc. Sweet toasty malt combined with the spices make for an interesting brew. Only slight bitterness. Medium body with moderate carbonation. Good mouthfeel, not overly carbonated like other pumpkin brews. This is the best of the pumpkin beers that I have tasted. Nice mix of spices with a slightly darker, more flavorful malt character than most. Decent drinkability, but really isn't a session beer. Another hit from DFH."
"Drinkability - good stuff, but not my favorite. A good Halloween beer for next year's party, but a little too pricy for regular consumption."
"Drinkability: Very good. Not to sound cliched or trite, this is one pumpkin ale that gets my respect. Very complex."
"Nice beer with a singular mission. Not my favorite taste in a beer, but enjoyable enough for an occasional detour."
"A nice dark amber beer with a very small tan head. There was a sediment at the bottom which I didn't pour into my glass. It smells like a good ale, but with a heavy nutmeg aroma. This isn't as bad as many other Pumpkin beers I've tried. The taste is ok, I just don't like this kind of crap in my beer. The mouthfeel is good, without the decent body and 7% alcohol this beer would be undrinkable (by me). As for drinkability, yeah I might have another one- next year."
"Mildly drinkable - a complement, IMO, to the style!"
"best pumpkin ale I've had yet!!!"
"It seems like they threw everything but the kitchen sink in this beer. Some things work quite well. Others are just a distraction."
"Overall, I liked this one. A good showing from this good brewery."
"Tastes not nearly as spicy or sweet as the nose portended. Round and excellently mellow. Taste is set up as a combination of sweet and flavorful and dry and hoppy. Full mouth flavor of nutmeg, cinnamon and allspice--tinged with sweetness quickly shifts over to a spicy, dry hop aftertaste. Sweet malt medium body. Very balanced brew and the alcohol being mostly imperceptible. Mellow and mild."
"A clean amber beer with a foamy off white head that flattens out quickly. The aroma is mostly pumpkin with subtle hints of spice in the background. I belive I could pick up cinnamon as the predominate spice. The spices start off the taste, wrapping themselves around the tip of your tongue. This is quickly followed by the sweet pumpkin flavor finishing off on the back of your tongue."
"This is one of the more solid pumpkin beers I've tried. I like the combination of added pumpkin spice and flavor to a brown ale. The slightly higher abv, than most other pumpkin ales, is fitting for a cool autumn night."
"ng"
"Poured this one out on a cool fall evening after raking leaves and watching college football on TV. This one pours out to a dark gold, almost brown in the glass with a slight head. The aroma is that of spice, which reminded me of a cross between a pumpkin pie baking and a pork roast loaded with thyme and rosemary. Weird? Yes, but true. The taste is quite good, with a nice dose of malt mixing with the spices. One of the best pumpkin ales I've tried."
"This pours an awesome orange color. It's clear with not much head at all. I get a mild spice aroma off this, with malt and maybe some pumpkin, sorry punkin', in the background. The flavor is definitely sweet with a nice toasted malt flavor carrying through to a spice finish. The spices seem more of a mouthfeel than an actual flavor, without any one spice dominating or even coming through at all. It finishes a little warming. Overall this is a decent pumpkin beer."
"This beer pours a nice clear orange-copper color with a 1.5""" head of off white. Head retention is slightly above average, and a tight quarter inch stays throughout the drink. The smell is of nutmeg first, then pumpkin. Lots of spices in this beer, but they don't really get in the way as in other pumpkin ales. The taste is balanced with real malts giving ground and imparting a sweetness that does very well with the nutmeg and cinnamon flavors. Very reminiscent of pumpkin pie. A nice pumpkin flavor lingers in the aftertase. Body is well carbonated, and drinks lightly. 7% alcohol is well concealed. It's easy to have more than one of these. I look forward to it each year."
"The aromas of this orange/tawny liquid are of split, mashed and boiled grains. Starchy and beery. On the palate it is creamy-textured and admirably balanced between bitter malty beer flavors -- reminiscent of a run-of-the-mill amber or brown ale. Subtle spiciness and gord-flavors can be decoded from the experience, but it requires some effort."
"The beer pours a nice amber color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a slightly malty scent which is overpowered with pumpkin and nutmeg aroma. The taste is good as well. It has a very smooth pumpkin flavor that goes down easy and finishes a bit warm. It has a complex array of seasonings along with excellent balance. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn good pumpkin ale. This and Smuttynose Pumpkin Ale are among the best."
"Love me some Dogfish, so I was eager to try this one. Perfect weather for it. Pours a nice amber color with a very fluffy head that doesn't go away. The aroma is wonderful - nutmeg, pumpkin pie spices and pumpkin. Smells like a pie, as it should. The flavor has a subdued pumpkin flavor that is backed by the nice mixture of spices. Well done. The drinkability of this brew is a little low because of the spices, but I could see myself drinking lots of these, just one per day. Dogfish scores again!"
"Edit: Trying the 2004 batch here. The color is amber gold. The feel is moderate to thick. Overall, a nice beer, but not as exceptional as last years. I'm gooing to knock the appearance, taste and drinkability down."
"Mouthfeel was medium to heavy given the stickiness. I would definitely have a few, even though I was disappointed in the flavors. I've had plenty worse, but there are better out there."
"Mouthfeel is good and this baby goes down smooth. A few of these on a cold fall evening would be wonderful. Drinkability is good as well. This is damn tasty and I could finish the 4 pack in one night if I was in the mood. This gets me in the Fall / Halloween spirit and I highly recommend this seasonl brew to all. DFH does not fail to impress me yet again!"
"This pumpkin ale looks and smellls better than it tastes. Being a pumpkin lover, I was hoping for a pumpkin flavor, but it really was not present. This is not to say that the taste is not enjoyable. The taste is somewhat spicy being overwhelmed by allspice, nutmeg and cinnamom. There is a pleasant mouthfeel. Given the spices, this is not a highly drinkable beer. But it it certainly worth giving a try. Enjoy!"
"Due to the spices, though, I couldn't drink too many of these... I'd get sick of it after about partway through the second."
"Recommended."
"-Oelergud"
"All the flavors that should be there are there... the malt and pumpkin combine to give a warm toasty and slightly sweet & fruity flavor, while the nutmeg and cinnamon compliment rather than overwhelm the very present hops. Definitely not a novelty creation, but a beer that celebrates the season."
"Ive come to really appreciate and anticipate the annual apperance of pumpkin beers. This ones an outstanding example of the class. Pours a clear, dark-copper color with a thin white head. Brown-sugar, pumpkin, and pie spices compose the aroma. The spiciness is folded nicely into a faint alcohol smell. As you work through the glass, nutmeg seems to stand out as the dominant spice. Pleasing alcohol warming (nice in the Autumn outdoors). The pumpkin taste is present all the way through the taste. Finish is rather hoppy for a pumpkin beer. Overall, this is one of the beer pumpkin beers Ive had."
"Pours a two-fingered white head leaving a good lace, pale amber color. Light carbonation. Sweet spicy nose. Starts sweet - the brown sugar comes through - that hints of pumpkin, smooth very easy to drink. This could be a session beer except at 7% ABV one must be wary. $2.30 for a 12oz bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"This is coming out more """negative""" than I'd like...this is a good beer, maybe too strong for the style though."
"Although the Pumpkin Ale's are not typically my favorite, I have to admit that this took me by surprise. I picked this one up because I fell in love with the Aprihop that I had at the Boston Beer Summit. This beer did not disappoint me either! The nose of the beer is strong but not overwhelming, and leaves enough room for you mouth to make up its own conclusion. The finish was very nice, and not too long. Overall I would consider this ale highly in this category and would be something I look forward to having every fall!"
"The funny thing is that it is very drinkable, actually superb, but the pumpkin thing just brings you back to that one time of year. Perhaps if it were different, then it would be different. But alas and alack.... Mouthfeel is nice. The aftertaste leaves that umami sensation in your mouth, o you really can't complain. Though some may call this a novelty beer, it could gain acceptance if people would shake their associations with Thanksgiving. All in all, another superb offering from DFH."
"Pours a very clear, orange color... almost irredescent. Small head disappears pretty quickly. The aroma is all pumpkin pie spices: nutmeg, big-time cinnamon, and a big waft of allspice. Maybe even some spicy hoppiness in there as well. Taste is really great for a pumpkin ale - it's mainly a very spicy tasting brew up front, then some sweet candied pumpkin and then a nice bitter finish that lingers for a while. Like one forum poster said, """pumpkin pie in a glass.""" No doubt about it. This would sit perfectly against a plate of turkey on Thanksgiving Day. Mouth is medium to full, slightly oily and smooth. It's very drinkable. You're definitely thinking about glass number two right away."
"A good treat for the upcoming days of fall. Doesn't make you feel sick from the pumking flavors and is well controlled at that."
"12 ounce bottle, with freshness info notched onto the label. 2004 batch. Pours medium golden almond in color, clear, with a white head and leaves a decent amout on lacing. Bready malty nose. Full bodied and rich mouthfeel. Nice depth of malty body and flavor. Pumkiny undertones and spices evident but in background, adding to complexity and intrigue. Usually this is not my favorite type of beer, but this creation is a winner. Tasty brew, an obvious choice to go with hearty fall dishes, can you say Thanksgiving dinner?"
"Just tried the 2004 version. Looks like another interesting beer from DFH. What surprised me most about this beer is that for a spiced beer it is remarkably balanced. It is true that it exudes pumpkin pie smell and taste, and you can pick out lots of spicy notes, but you can also taste the malt and the hops. Wow!! As for drinkability, I tried to have two in a row, and there is no doubt this one is at 7% ABV. If I don't need to do anything after drinking, the drinkability index improves, but otherwise, one in a session is probably enough. I'll need to pick up a few more 4 packs. Good job DFH."
"buy this shit for haloween parties. i know i will"
"The funny thing is that it is very drinkable, actually superb, but the pumpkin thing just brings you back to that one time of year. Perhaps if it were different, then it would be different. But alas and alack.... Mouthfeel is nice. The aftertaste leaves that umami sensation in your mouth, o you really can't complain. Though some may call this a novelty beer, it could gain acceptance if people would shake their associations with Thanksgiving. All in all, another superb offering from DFH."
"Very excited to try this one. Poured out a copper, ruby-like color but didn't have anything special for a head on it. I must say that the color is quite impressive. Aroma is pretty much assumed in this style of beer. I thought it was nice and balanced but not a lot of depth to it. The thing I liked about the taste of this beer is that it actually had a pumpkin taste to it and not overloaded with spice. Granted, I love spiced beer, but it was nice to have a pumpkin ale and not have it focused on the spices. Very enjoyable beer and smooth for 7% abv. Glad I bought a 4 pack, but not my favorite pumpkin ale."
"Deep orange-brownish pour with a little bit of head. Very balanced aroma consisting of cinnamon, nutmeg, and bread malts. The taste was outstanding. Same as the aroma, nutmeg and cinnamon, but this is where the PUMPKIN really shines through. Perfect for those cool fall evenings. This is a beer that I hope will still be available to me when November and December come rolling around. A must try!"
"Draught @ CTRiver Brewers Festival: This may be the best """Pumpkin""" beer that I have had yet. This one pours an orangish-amber color, with almost no head. There is a wonderful aroma of pumpkin pie spices. Also some maltiness in there too. The taste is a nice blend of the pumpkin spices with a good malty beer. Some hops also. This was really excellent."
"I'm having this beer in a flight of pumpkin ales (a New England specialty, it appears). I'm not a big fan of sugary beers, like scotch ale. That said, this might be an excellent dessert beer after a hearty meal because it is not sickly sweet. Perhaps a true specialty beer."
"Just a good pumpkin ale right here. Got a pint from supposedly the first tapped keg of this year's batch at Blind Tiger in Manhattan. This pumpkin ale is sweeter and maltier than the only other I have for recent comparison, which is the Smuttynose Pumpkin. There are nice hints of allspice, clove, and maybe cinnamon. The beer also finishes quite dry with a very earthy pumpkin flavor. A Dogfish Head guy (owner, I think?) was at the bar, and gave a little summary of the beer, saying something about fermenting the natural sugars in the pumpkin flesh, which I would imagine contributes to this quality. Anyway, I thought this beer was highly drinkable for a pumpkin ale, and if I wasn't at the Blind Tiger with so many other brews to choose from, I could have knocked back a few more. I'll certainly be aiming to do just that again sometime this fall."
"Light brown color with a hint of red. Odors of light nutmeg and pumpkin, maybe a little brown sugar. Malty sweet flavor at first. Light pumpkin pie flavor in the middle. And light alcohol and hop finish. Overall a balanced approach, nothing too hardcore."
"Drinkability and overall: Finely crafted and nicely balanced. Hops, spices, and some sweetness (from the pumpkin or malt, not sure) all manage to co-exist in perfect harmony. This is definitely a unique brew and a good way to get ready for fall."
"Poured a very nice deep orange color with a good head that seemed to linger.Good aroma-a really nice mix of spice,malt and pumpkin.Very good malt flavor upfront.The pumpkin actually comes thru in this one-the spices are subtle though definately present-especially compared to some of the other pumpkin brews.Full bodied as is found with most of the Dogfish brews. A very drinkable beer.So far Id have to say if youre looking for a pumpkin brew,try this one."
"This poured out a slightly hazy amber hue with a light tan head of decent size. The head drops to a cap of bubbles leaving little lacing on the glass. The aroma smells of nutmeg, cinnamon and pumpkin spice, almost exactly like pumpkin pie. The taste had a lot of the same spice elements in it with a bit of malty sweetness like brown sugar. The aftertaste had a nice spice lingering about. I will have to try this with some pumpkin pie because it tastes great and would go perfect of course. The mouthfeel was about average with a light to medium body. Drinkability basically depends on how much you like pumpkin pie type dishes, in my case this is a very drinkable beer that I look forward to each year. Definitely give this one a shot especially if you are looking for a pumpkin ale."
"Ahh, autumn. I love this time of year. The cool, crisp nights (its actually 90 degrees in Boston today), the colorful leaves. Most importantly, fall beer: Octoberfests and Pumpkin Ales. I started out with Dogfish Head Punkin ale this year. It poured a medium brown with just a slight head, and a mild lace. You can catch a hint of the cinnamon the nose before the nutmeg hits you. Its the spice that dominates. This carries over into the taste. Nutmeg up front, and pumpkin in the middle. Just a touch of the malt on the back end. It has a medium mouthfeel. With the spice flavors, this would seem to be a great warmer. Im not sure I could drink to many of these though do to the heavy spice influence."
"Pours a (what else) pumpkin-orange color, with light and lacy cream colored head. Smell is of nutmeg and cinnamon. The bottle claims that the beer is brewed with real pumpkin, brown sugar, allspice, cinnamon and nutmeg, and they are right; I can identify each flavor in the brew! Not much hops to note. This is a fun brew to find, especially if you find a four pack on sale for four bucks like I did. However, I won't be making this a regular brew, as I can't drink many of these before longing for more traditional beer. A good idea for Thanksgiving dinner, perhaps?"
"Clear copper body with a medium cream-colored head that fades into a creamy ring around a stormy weather pattern. The aroma is really more spice than pumpkin, but the spice isnt overwhelming. Theres a slightly cake-like and caramel malt underneath. The flavor is lightly sweet and mostly balanced except for a bitterness that doesnt seem to quite fit in with the rest of the flavors. Ive had better pumpkin ales."
"Scores are per style...based on the fact no-one has been close to them on this style.."
"Malty and sweet with clove, pumpkin and nutmeg bursting forth on the palate. One of the better pumpkin ales around during the fall."
"I know its not really the season for this beer but what the heck. I might have been even more let down if I tried it around Halloween. Pours a luminescent orange/copper color with a medium thin beige head. Head retention is pretty weak, and thin lacing. The aroma is spiced with cinnamon and ginger, as well as malt. The mouthfeel is kind of syrupy and sweet, with malt, cinnamon and brown sugar flavors. It becomes overbearing at times. The finish retains the sweet character and is pumpkiny (?) and malty. This is a decent seasonal, it is just a little too much in the sweet department at times."
"Quite a tasty spiced beer. I can really taste the allspice and cinnamon flavors the whole time the beer is in my mouth; I like the creaminess and the carbonation as I think they add to the experience. Smells OK, nothing to write home about but certainly tasty. This beer reminds me of Harpoon's Winter Warmer, one of my favorite holiday brews."
"Pours golden-orange with a transient head, smells like butter squash and ginger. Very sweet and sugary taste of ginger, allspice, and pumpkin seeds with a great mild hoppiness and cinnamon flavor that makes it splicy in the mouth, but leaves a clean finish. A bit too sweet to be especially drinkable, but I can't think of any pumpkin brew (except maybe Southampton) that I could drink more than 2 of anyway. Worth dragging all the way home though."
"Pours out a brown amber with a big off-white head. I do taste the pumpkin, butI wish I tasted it more. Balance is solid, and flavor is tasty-good. Certainly a beer whichh I enjoy drinking, but not up there with my favorite pumpkin beers. Try it, itisquite easyto driinkkk."
"I thank Mr. Cokes for the sample."
"A nice beer for something different, as with many other flavored beers, I wouldn't recommend consuming more than one or two. The flavors aren't good in large amounts."
"The color is a cloudy orange. It is warming for those cool fall nights and has a pumpkin spice aroma. The taste was of nutmeg and cinnamon finishing off with brown sugar. The alcohol content was too overwhelming. The spices were not well balanced with the maltiness. The aftertaste was great, but the beer itself was just okay."
"One of, if not the biggest, seasonal pumpkin ales out there. Perhaps a bit over-wrought, with too much spiced sweetness. I feel like I'm drinking a candy store, especially when it warms up. Perhaps a bit more punkin and grainy malt, and less allspice and brown sugar. I can appreciate the effort and laud the inventiveness, but it's not for me. Well worth the money for the pack, for the experience alone, but I'll stick with marzens come september."
"Second best pumpkin beer I've ever had -- the first being Kuhnhenn's bottled take on the style."
"I've had this beer in my fridge for about 4 months. The aroma is dominated by nutmeg and pumpkin, maybe even some clove. Off-white head leaves a little lace as it fades to a film. Transparent amber colored beer with an orange hue. The pumpkin pie aroma carries over into the flavor, but isn't as strong. There's some hops down there that can't quite make it to the surface. It's not as thick as the aroma suggests, the flavor is pretty strong but doesn't stick to your tongue, I wouldn't call the finish clean, but it doesn't hang around long either. It definitely leans more towards the pumpkin pie end with spices present. Loads of flavor and aroma are probably too much for half the beer drinkers out there. If you don 't like pumpkin pie stay away, otherwise I'd say drink it closer the bottling date so the hops have a fighting chance."
"Quite """alcoholic""" in its linger."
"Dogfish did a great job with this brew. The pumpkin is well balanced with a strong sweet backing (brown sugar?). The combination works well. Very easy beer to drink, though even at a holloween event, it was hard to drink more than two. This is far more than a simple """me too""" beer brewed with pumpkin, it's a beer that very well might define this niche style. Though not really something I'd normally do with a brew, I have discovered that this a great beer to cook with!"
"Good looking burnt orange brew with white head that falls to ring of ever rising bubbles. Smells wonderful pumpkin, nutmeg, allpice and touch of cinnamon, Thanksgiving in a bottle had a couple of bottles with Thanksgiving dinner went well, saved a couple for review as you can see I tend to procrastinate. Only got to try three pumpkin brews this year due to my location in Budwiser is King land this one tasted the most spicey of the three. Great fall brew but, wouldn't drink on regular basis, as I would the other pumpkin ale I reviewed. Tastes like it smells mouthfeel is on light side of medium good spice beer for the occasion."
"This pours an orange color with a small white head. It smells fantastic, spicy like pumpkin pie. There's allspice and cinnamon and even some clove I think. The taste is similar to the smell. There is a definite spice taste with a hint of pumpkin. The mouthfeel is thin and bubbly. This is a good spiced, drinking beer in my opinion. There is a good spiced drinking beer."
"Thanks to TwelveVoltMan for securing a 4 pack for me!"
"Pours a medium brownish with some golden ruby highlights and a sort of khaki head. Smell is of spice and a bit of vegetable and pumpkin. The taste is pumpkiny up front and then just melds into a spicy malty mess followed by a drying hop finish that just jumps the train off the track. Drinkabilty was low as i was able to finish the beer, but wasnt going begging for another. Not one of the best pumpkin beers I had last year. Cottonwood was by far a more well rounded beer IMO."
"Definitely the best pumpkin ale out there. Leave it to the mad geniuses at DFH to make a pumpkin ale that is only not a novelty, but is a damn good beer! Delicious, and absolutely one I'll have next year!"
"As far as pumpkin ales go, this was one of the better ones I had. Good cinnamon/nutmeg scent to it. Looked beautiful in the glass, orange-amber color. Taste was pumpkiney, but a good dose of hearty malt along with it. Due to the taste, I doubt anyone is downing a bunch of this all night."
"Hazy tawny bronze. Thin, but stiff and dogged head leaves sparse lace. Aroma comprised of buttery caramel and nutmeg, with medium toffee and nutty brittle tones. Understated cinnamon and ripe fig esters as well. Very well rounded and appetizing aromawise. In flavor, a browned butter drizzled toasted biscuit impression is the dominant malt presence. Stately, slightly herbaceous allcpice and citric hop combination is an undertone. Lightly bittered, with balance skewed towards caramel, but sweetness never becomes cloying. Subtle bubblegum esters emerge as it breathes, helping facilitate a candyish overall suggestion. Well calculated and integrated pumpkin spice presence. Full dextrinous body and viscous, but not syrupy in mouthfeel. Finishes with soft alcohol warmth and brown sugar sweetness, lending a lingering spiced hot toddy impression. An excellent """pumpkin""" ale, with judicious spicing and a simple malt backbone with girth. Very tasty and well crafted."
"I'd like to give big props to my bro Mikey up in CT. Thanks for the eye opener man!!!"
"I'm a huge fan of Dogfish Head, but I can't say I care for this beer. It needs more malt or hops to balance the spices, which overpower the brew's taste. If you're interested in this style, I'd suggest trying Post Road Pumpkin Ale instead."
"Dark brown with orange hues and an impressive white head. The aroma is cinnimon with nutmeg. A lot of brown sugar comes through in the taste along with the spices. At 7% alcohol, it's pretty strong for a pumpkin ale, but it is one of the best on the market right now."
"I expected more. Dogfish is generally about more of everything. I would have expected more pumpkin, more spice, more everything..."
"If you like pumpkin beers give this one a shot!"
"Generally I am not a great fan of the pumpkin spiced brews, but this one was really good. The color was a deep amber with a thick creamy head, the beer had little cloudiness. The smell was clearly spicy with the pumpkin pie smell. The taste - again spicy and hoppy - I think nutmeg was the leading flavor driver for this beer. It almost tasted rum-like at the hoppy finish. Drinkable as far as bold spice beers go."
"not quite clear, amber orange ale with a thin white head. smells of pumpkin pie with the spices and nutmeg especially, being most evident. not very strong smelling, but what's there is really good. big malty taste, the nutmeg and brown sugar are very apparrent, nice pumpkin flavor underneath it all, some hops balance the taste out rather well at the end. good reasonably full mouthfeel. my first pumpkin ale, and i'm really impressed. hope there are others equally as good. for anyone who hasn't had one before, start here."
"An enjoyable libation for the Halloween time of year maybe?"
"Best of the pumpkin ales. Even more enjoyable from draught."
"Even though I haven't had many, this is the best pumpkin ale I've tried. The color is a nice dark orange/amber, fall color, which puts me in a pumpkin/autumn mood. It smells and tastes like spicy pumpkin, almost like a pumpkin pie, but not as sweet- it's got a good balance. I love pumpkin flavor, and the spices that go with it, and this beer met my expectations."
"clear autumnal reddish brown. small, white frothy head. sweet baking spices on the nose. full textured body, smooth and creamy. huge spicey, sugary flavor...finishes dry from a gentle hop bite. quite different than most pumpkin ales, and is better for it. spice profile is interesting without being overwhelming. a great fall treat."
"As a general foe of pumpkin beers, I must admit that this has impressed me. Still, not something I'd run out to try again, but this is the best of the lot I've tried. And I've given the ratings accordingly."
"And cheers to 36PoundLoveChild for providing!"
"I've never really been a fan of flavored/spiced beers, but this one breaks those rules."
"Pours a deep brown liquid. The aromas of cinnamon, allspice and brown sugar come through a hint of malt. The flavors of the malt, spices and a bit of pumpkin flow through out the brew evenly with an ebbing and flowing bitterness level. The body is smooth supporting a deep alcoholic warmth that is very nice in the recent dropped temperatures."
"F"
"Dogfish did not overdo it on the spices, which was nice. It looked very good, but to be honest, the bar was dark. Not an overwhelming pumpkin taste but it was definitely noticeable. Very very smooth. This is a great beer for the fall. Not a complex beer, but great to have."
"This beer poured a medium amber color and formed a nice foamy off white head that left laticed lace as it subsided. Some carbonation was present. An aroma of nutmeg, cinnamon and other spices. The flavor was of malt, nutmeg, cinnamon with a slightly astrigent finish with a warming feeling of the alcohol present. Not a fan of this style, but Dogfish seems to pull if off better than most others."
"This beer poured out a very clear light amber brown color and had a thinning white head of foam. The aroma is special to this beer  Heavy with spices, including pumpkin pie spices, cinnamon, cardamom, clove and nutmeg. Its an earthy and festive aroma. Perfect for Autumn. The same things that come out in the aroma transfer directly to the flavor during the first sip. The spices are definitely in the forefront here. Theres some hop bitterness and some malt body - it reminded me of a spicy and light nut brown ale. An excellent seasonal, and a beer that doesnt hide what it truly is."
"i was quite wary of this one, as i had only had one pumpkin ale in the past (forget which one, but it was a while ago) and it was simply awful. the DFH punkin' ale is quite the opposite of that. this could surprisingly be a fun session ale. it pours a nice amber colour with a minimal head that does not hang around for very long, but leaves a solid lacing. the smell scared me at first...ginger, nutmeg, cinnamon and of course pumpkin. it reminded me quite a bit of harpoon's winter warmer, a beer that i loathe. thankfully, the taste of this one made me forget the similarities to the winter warmer. it echoes the smell, relying a bit moreso on the pumpkin flavour upfront with a spicy finish, but everything is quite subtle and subdued. flavour is not shoved down your throat, but hinted at throughout, which made this brew that much more enjoyable. i'll definitely be looking to sample this every fall from now on."
"12 oz bottle, part of my recent BIF 3.0 package. Poured a deep amber, with a fairly good head that didn't stick around long, and minimal lacing on the glass. Aroma is allspice and maybe a hint of cinnamon, but weak and even lacking in pumpkin. It smells more like a spiced ginger ale. Taste is more of the spicyness with some hops thrown in. This isn't a bad beer, for my first punkin beer, but I find it a little lacking in the body. It has a good start and a decent finish but it needs a kick in the middle."
"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a deep amber color with one finger of head. There is just a little bit of lacing left on the glass. Aromas of pumpkin, ginger, and nutmeg fill the top of the glass, very spicy. The taste is very subtle at first, just a little sweet. The finish has all the spice and lots of pumpkin and cinnamon coming through. The mouthfeel is very thick and strong. The drinkability is fairly nice for a 7% brew. A great seasonal treat."
" This really strikes me as a pumpkin beer as opposed to many beers that strike me as beer with pumpkin added. Simultaneously tart and spicy, the flavor profile of this beer really works together with the solid body to make a great drink."
"The feel is first rate being medium and smooth with a clean and crisp finish. My drinkability rating fairly high for the ABV as this dimension simply didn't come through in the taste."
"As others may have observed, this is more like """pumpkin pie ale""" than """pumpkin ale""". The pumkin & spices really stand out. I like that. I'm just trying to figure out what food to have w/ this beer. This is not a session beer, because the flavor is too unique. You need to have this one with a meal. Picture a nut brown ale, with a pumpkin flavor, and the nose of cinnamon & nutmeg and you have this one."
"Poured a small head that disappeared quickly.Left a watery looking lace that wasnt too appealing.Clear amber in color.Medium bodied with good carbonation.Very spicy taste with a dry bitter finish.Its hard to make out the individual tastes of each spice.Comes across more of a ginger taste.More body,carbonation,and less spices.Leaves a wheaty and dry after taste.Not the best but not the worst Pumpkin Ale I've had."
"Definite smell of pumpkin, nutmeg and allspice - but the brown ale is behind it all, too. Tastes of pumpkin pie - not sure what constitutes """pumpkin pie crust," but it's there in the background. But unlike other pumpking beers, it's not overwhelming - which is good. I could drink this year-round. Immediate hoppy aftertaste - and that wonderful, lingering pumpkin pie."
"After sharing some with my friend, he came up with a very good point, the beer tastes not like pumpkin pie, as so much as it actually tastes like GINGERSNAP beer. taste for yourself"
"s.d."
"Prost"
"Amber color with a quickly dissapating head. The smell is pleasant, like walking into a bakery. Cinnamon, nutmeg, and pumpkin all apparent in the nose. I am not a big fan of fruit beers but this is very good. The taste of the fruit does not overpower the fact that this is a beer. Finishes with a nice flavor on the tongue of cinnamon. Overall a good beer from this excellent brewery."
"Glowing amber with a fizzy, shortlasting head. Nose is an impressive blend of cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg, and a pumpkin carving contest. All of these flavors come through on palate with an emphasis on the zesty, spicy characteristics of the cinnamon and nutmeg. Spritzy carbonation entices the tongue. Perhaps the most viscous, full-bodied mouthfeel I've noticed in a pumpkin beer. Warming alcohol is noticeable on the prolonged finish. This is a well-done, drinkable pumpkin ale that sets itself apart from others. The spices and alcohol content keep this beer from becoming overly drinkable and refreshing, however."
"Clear brownish orange color. Small head that disappeared quickly. Nice smell, spice dominates. Allspice, nutmeg & Cinnamon really come thru. The pumpkin & nutmeg step up in the taste with the brown ale making a nice backbone. Crisp tangy spicy on the toungue. Very drinkable. A nice brew."
"Backwash: This is probably the best pumpkin ale Ive ever had, closely approximating what I remember of the one I had at Rodneys years ago. As I mentioned in my Post Road review(before knowing about this), the Rodneys version was also based on a brown ale, which made for a more successful result. This beer really transcends its status as a seasonal novelty beer and becomes something Id be happy to have almost anytime. My one cavil is that it is too hoppy, which competes with the other flavors. Id prefer a slightly gentler British-style brown ale feel. To see if the hops mellow, I plan to put one away to age. Pricey."
"Poured a clear amber / orange color with a thin head. A definite spicy aroma is quickly noticed. The taste is a nice balance of sweet and spice, as cinnamon and nutmeg are clearly evident. The body was slightly thin, and the spiciness lasts a bit on the tongue after swallowing. The higher alocohol content is barely noticeable. Nice beer to sip on a chilly October evening while sitting looking at your carved pumpkins, though it is not a beer to drink several of."
"Appearance: Copper amber orang when held to the light forms with a cream colored relatively thin head that leaves behind speckled lacing. Aroma: First thing evident is the spices nutmeg and cinnamon with some mild pumpkin tones. Taste: One of the better ones I have had this fall not as resdiually sweet or cloyingly syrupy lacking some of the pumpkin flavor that others have more of but the spices are dead on here along with a decent kick in the acohol department at 7%abv that's not too shabby. Mouthfeel: Some residual stickiness still has the syrupy extract like feel but this one's not nearly as bad as some of the other pumpkin ales out there, good carbonation enjoyable. Drinkability: A definite one at a time beer but to be enjoyed surely every fall."
"This made for an excellent snakebite."
"Notes: Soft, warming, and spicy, this is a nice pumpkin ale. I'm not as excited with it as I thought I would be, but it's a must-try for the fall season."
"Hazy orange color with an off-white bubbly head that settles quickly. Nose is equal parts punkin and spice, and just a bit of alcohol, plus some sweet honey and toffee. Flavor is very balanced between punkin, malts, and spices. Would have liked more pumpkin to come through though. Finishes a bit sweet, with sweet pear and alcohol tingling the mouth in the finish. Pretty good, but not as good as I expected."
"Pretty good for a fruit/vegetable beer spiked with spices."
"Drinkability: This is kind of a weird beer, as are most pumpkin ales. Worth a try if you consider yourself a beer geek. I picked this up for an impromptu beer tasting for a group of friends. We all found it interesting, but I don't think anyone was overly impressed. I'm finding it hard to finish the bottle. This is definitely one to share."
"Sweetish bubblegum, pumpkin hinted nose. very clear filitered bubbly light orange look. Very lively in the glass. Upfront a smooth pumpkin nutmeg, and cinnamon taste dominates but then the second layor of flavor is crisp and has a hip sting.. not flowery or citrusy hops... clean stings of hops. Also after you swallow the spice and slight white pepper dryness (abv) stays on the tongue. The more you sip the beer the more prominent the pumpkin stands out. Lively coating mouth slightly viscous to the tongue. A nice treat for an October night. This would be something you either like or hate.. and well... I like it.."
"I have to say this one is the best pumpkin ale I have had a real nice brew.Pours a burnt orange color with a real nice creamy 1/2 inch head that leaves some nice lacing,aroma is of some serious nutmeg and cardimum with light cinnamon notes.Taste hits with a real pumpkin flavor with the sices hitting after the initial pumpkin flavor so you get the whole spectrum of flavors.A great all around beer definently with the weather changing right now.Very nice,had at Tavern 616 in North Wales,PA."
"Pours with a beige colred head sporting short head retention that settles quickly onto clear amber/light red liquid ( the label says this is a brown ale...but I don't see anything brown about it). Nose is spicy with nutmeg and allspice, malt and hop...with slight """punkin' """ aromas lastly. The taste is a sharp blast of goodly hop bitters followed by some ale yeast-based fruitiness, sweet malts, spiciness and a touch of alcohol which leads into the finish, which is lip-smackingly bitter and long. The most bitter example of pumpkin ale I've had the pleasure to drink...a hop-heads' pumpkin ale if you will."
"Someone should send a bottle of this to Shipyard, so they understand what a """Punkin""" Ale is supposed to taste like. It pours an orange tinted amber with a fading white head. Pumpkin, nutmeg, allspice, malt and alcohol fumes (in that order) make up the aroma. The malt body could use a bit more oomph, but it's far more substantial than that weak-ass Shipyard. Flavors of pumpkin pie come to mind - as it should. Pumpkin and cinnamon dominate, as allspice, sugar and nutmeg offer a nice supporting touch. A mild lime-like bitterness seems almost out of place, but after a few gulps, seems to fit in with the """Punkin""" gang. Warming alcohol provides the expected punch when you smell and taste it."
"Crisp carbonation starts you into what becomes a very smooth bodied beer. It is pretty full in that category, and it is loaded with complex flavors. Pumpkins do not dominate, but you can get a good taste of them. The spices are the real story here, and the perfect balance of the flavors creates a really great brew. I had a small sample of this at Sippin' By the River, and everyone was shocked when I said """ this is pretty good""". I was a full out pumpkin hater before this beer. After a pint on draught, I may never look upon a pumpkin ale negatively again. A very nice brew indeed."
"My first pumpkin ale....quite good...spicy aroma..very little head, but color was like a light pumpkin pie...Taste was interesting..a malty flavor, but with alcohol kick. Aftertaste was good for such a high abv. The taste lingered just a bit in the back of the palate...just enough to invite you to sip more. Mouthfeel was chewy in a nice way...similar to a desert. Easy and pleasant to drink. A nice change of pace."
"For such a full flavored beer at 7% abv I found this beer to be quite drinkable. I just wish it came in 6 packs for the same price."
"Note: this beer gets better as it warms. The distinctions of the aromas and tastes become more prominent with each degree increase. I really liked this beer and would get again and again. Great representative of its style."
"Pours a clear deep amber, smallish white head that mostly lasts, leaves decent lacing. Aroma is sweet, spicy (cinnamon, clove, some nutmeg), maybe a hint of alcohol. Flavor is somewhat sweet, quite spicy, slight bit of alcohol in the end. Medium body, minimal carbonation, lasting spice flavors."
"Nice orange pumpkin color, not much head. Smells of allspice, cinnamon, a bit of nutmeg and bitter pumpkin. Hmmm just like the bottle says. Faint aromas, but nice and intriguing. Taste is dominated by the Dogfish Head brown sugar, only subtle hints of the spices and pumpkin. Nice that it's not artificial tasting, but I would have liked the spices to shine through more. I'd like to try this again."
"If I were to choose between bottle and tap (I have had both), I would go with tap."
"Overall I was a little disapointed by this beer. It had a very interesting nose, but the flavor itself was more along the lines of a middle of the road american pale ale with some pumpkin spice in the background. Not bad by any means, I was just expecting a bit more from such a great brewery."
"Comments: I was a bit hesitant to try this because I don't like pumpkin very much, but it was suggested that there are enough other flavors present that I might like it anyway. I did - very much. You just never know. The brown sugar was fantastic. Yum."
"A golden copper colour, with little head or lacing. Nose is a little spicy and sweet. The taste is quite something, though. I've never had a pumpkin ale before this. I'd call the flavour as something of a cross between pumpkin pie filling, mulled cider, and an amber ale. Quite sweet and spicy, with a slight hoppy finish... That being said, this is also like pumpkin pie and mulled cider in the fact that it's really not for imbibing in quantity, as the flavour can overcome you."
"The flavor is very reminiscent of pumpkin pie, but make no mistake, it still tastes like beer. The amount of pumpkin and spices is not overdone and make for a different, but quite smooth and drinkable, beer that was very enjoyable on Thanksgiving. Thanks to NeroFiddled for the sample of this brew."
"Each year at The Grey Lodge the anticipation and legend of this beer increases.From what I can tell due to its extreme scarcity, that is true at a lot of places. This beer is everything seasonal beers should be and should be about. And to think two years ago we got a barrel around Thanksgiving because they couldn't get rid of it. This year all were gone before Halloween."
"Nice orange-copper color with amber highlights.  Pours with an attractive creamy head that lasts well and leaves a nice lace.  The aroma has a distict pumpkin scent, with nutmeg and perhaps clove.  The taste is very spicy, with a subdued punmpkin note.  It still presents a nice malt flavor, with hops noticable on the finish.   A hint of sweetness helps blend the flavors together.  The mouthfeel is fairly typical for an ale, noticable but does not coat the tongue, with a relatively clean finish due to the hops.  Very enjoyable.  Thanks to Nero for making this sample available."
"Nice amber color but unfortunately not a big head, little lace. Great taste though, not overwhealming like some pumpkin ales can be. Not like eating a slice, but more like putting your finger in the batter and tasting. Cinnamon, clove, nutmeg and hops, and a finish that leaves you wanting to put whipped cream on top. Yeah, I liked this one!"
"Deep copper in color with an off-white head that holds well and leaves some good lace. The aroma is quite bold with nutmeg and what I perceive to be All-spice. The body is light-medium with a standard carbonation and a lightly zesty mouthfeel. The flavor shows the unique Dogfish Head character and starts with a good blending of sweet malt & spice, reveals a myriad of spice flavor as it crosses the palate, and finishes with a dry and peppery spiciness that lingers briefly. Bitterness is present, but plays a supporting role to the spice which acts as the main balancing agent (and dominant flavor). The spices are fresh and flavorful - much more so than the generic spicing usually found in pumpkin beers - and the beer has a very distinct character of its own which usually cannot be said of spiced beers. Very nice, and well worth trying."
