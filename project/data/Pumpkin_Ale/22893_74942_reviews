"Overall:  This is very good beer!  I love the strong flavors of malt, roasted pumpkin and pumpkin pie spices.  I’d certainly get it again!"
""
""
""
""
"Poured out of a bottle into a tulip. This is the most pumpkin forward pumpkin beer I've had. Spices are there but very subtle.  Very low carb. This is release #21 so some of the spices may have fallen out, also the bottle looked underfilled to my eye. Overall a very pumpkin foward beer with not a whole lots else going on. I enjoyed trying it but probably won't grab another unless it's super fresh for comparison."
""
""
""
"Pours a dark and toasty blackish brown color with an off white head.  The aroma is very roasted with some pumpkin and spice notes also coming forth.  Upfront in the flavor there is plenty of roasted character followed up by the pumpkin pie taste and mocha even.  Just a bit of spices mainly just pumpkin and roasted malt here but they definitely work well together.  Full bodied well carbonated ale.  The Pumpkin Stout is becoming a big trend in seasonal beer here in the states.  With these flavor combinations, it can easily be understood why."

"epic and dc brau definitely bring the flavors in this beer, definitely roasted flavors with a warm finish"
"O-A good pumpkin beer, wish it leaned more pumpkin than porter."
"O - Really great complex brew, lots of different traits on this one that make it worth getting. Glad to have gotten it."

"Ignoring the pumpkin aspect of this, I really like the milky charry chocolatey coffee and nutmeg that this offers. The pumpkin isn't pronounced enough for me to really think of this as pumpkin beer, or to distract from the above mentioned flavours that just so happen to be right up my alley."

"Release 19. Poured from the bomber in to a stout/porter glass and allowed to warm considerably. Aroma of pumpkin with lesser notes of chocolate and roasty malts. Taste is the same, with some warming alcohol from the 8%+ abv.  Medum-heavy mouthfeel that sticks around. By the end of the bomber, I was wishing I could try the base porter without the pumpkin spices."
""
""
""
"This is a good beer to pair with fruit, like apples or pears...or even a peach would be good, I'd venture--if you can get one during the season of its release. I'll admit that I have rarely been thrilled with pumpkin beers, so my lukewarm perspective may be slanted. But, it's a creative brew, not cloying or out of balance, so I'll take it as an autumn accompaniment to football season."

"O- a different take on a pumpkin ale that worked nicely with the robust porter.  I'd like to see more pumpkin porters/stouts"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - an unexpected surprise; this may be one I seek out each Fall!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Great beer, very much a porter with a hint of pumpkin and spice.  Not an overwhelming pumpkin flavor"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice, solid porter.  Needs to be a bit warm to enjoy the flavors.  Coffee, smoked malt and a bit of squash and earthy flavors in the back."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Straightforward in body and flavor, with cola adding drinkability. Striking bitterness. Not dry for a porter. Pumpkin flavor is simple and smart. I appreciate the restraint on spice. Overall, a good beer, and a fun play on a porter, but the flavors are too restrained to be especially memorable."

"Overall: outstanding. It's not an overkill like other pumpkin beers are. It is well executed in a porter. The smell was truly outstanding."
"Overall this is a pumpkin spice porter."
"Finishes easy and I enjoyed this beer."
""
"O: This is a very well made porter/ pumpkin ale hybrid. Not as smoky as a great porters go, not as overpowering and robust as most great pumpkin ales go, but a damn solid hybrid beer made by two great beer companies that I will introduce friends to."
""
""
""
"Overall: I really enjoyed this as for me it was a porter first, with support from the pumpkin and pie flavors. If you're looking for a pumpkin beer that isn't overly sweet, or heavy this is for you."
""
""
""
""
"I would absolutely buy this again. IN FACT I WILL"
""
""
""
""
""
"Not outstanding, but very smooth. Goes down easily for its strength, which is substantial. It's all about smoothness with this one. Flavors are well blended, body is gentle."

"Release #13...slc#1169. Pours dark deep mahogany with some ruby tones when held up to the light with a nice white foamy head. Smell is pumpkin pie spice, malt, chocolate. Taste is bitter and sour, sweet pumpkin pie flavor followed up by a sourness that leaves a lingering allspice/cocoa flavor on the back of the palate. Mouthfeel is bubbly and thin, unlike a true porter in my eyes. Not as thick as a stout should feel. Overall.. Combined with aroma and flavor this type of beer is ideal for me, just wish the sweetness of the aroma permeated through the taste into something creamier and bitier. The sourness of the after taste, and almost acridness takes away from what the aroma promises, but overall decent."
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer purists that want ales to lead with more Porter character will enjoy the subtlties of the pumpkin influence found here. But the true pie flavors won't command the taste in the way that most modern pumpkin ales do."

"Overall/Comments: I was expecting a bit more out of this offering but I will say that it was still a pretty good overall beer that was very drinkable. I would have like to see a bit more prominent pumpkin flavor. Classified as a Pumpkin Ale @ 8% ABV. Consumed 10/27/2013."

"DATE TASTED: October 26, 2013... GLASSWARE: HopDevil nonick... OCCASION: offering PSU some comeback inspiration... APPEARANCE: jet black body; oatmeal-thick brown head; lacing is uneven but thick as well... AROMA: crisp, candied flavor; toasted nut and oat undergird thee spiciness that is as much holiday as mischief night...PALATE: slightly warming, medium-bodied and drinkable--the IMPERIAL aspect is so subtle one quickly/nervously sips...TASTE: pumpkin, apple, peat and an odd funk of medicinal/plastic bottle vodka that takes the rating down a click--still big and old...OVERALL: of the handful of fall bombers I bought, this dares to blend the fall and winter seasons, and it does so deftly; a powerful punch of alcohol by the bottle's end only endears the drink more...more the Galloping Hessian than the Great Pumpkin, in terms of its substance and strength..."
"Overall: Not a bad beer. This had better balance than many of the pumpkin beers I've had so far. I think the darker malts add complexity, and play well with the spices. Not a lot of actual pumpkin character comes through though. Just like most of the prior examples this has an astringent note--I'm starting to wonder if that is from the spices or from pumpkin itself..."

"i have never had a pumpkin porter- so i was excited to try this one. it pours a deep brown- basically black, (held up to the light you can tell it is actually brown). the smell is filled with chocolate roasted malts. there are also hints of vanilla and spices riding along but the chocolate malt is the main force here. the taste is it rich and dark, after the 3rd sip i can start to taste the spices come through. this is a pretty good beer. i like the idea of the pumpkin porter and this one is good- if i ever see anymore like this ill give them a try."

"o: again - this is a year old. its an alright porter, however the pumpkin qualities (while there) are nowhere as present as i'd like them to be. perhaps they're stronger in fresher bottles. it can stand on its own as a porter, but if you're looking for a pumpkin porter - this year old bottle won't give you what you're searching for"
"Good thick head. A solid rich dark color, moderate lacing. Carbonating Is on the lighter side, but not weak or flat. Smells strongly of nutmeg, vanilla bean, but not so much pumpkin. The taste however taste like pumpkin and vanilla. I definitely have the urge to make a pumpkin porter shake with this one. It's got a pleasant mouthfeel, has a good crispness to it for a porter. Very drinkable, overall, my favorite Pumpkin Porter next to Four Peaks."

"Finally, the beer drinks smoothly with a creamy quality and the alcohol is pretty well masked. A good beer, yet something seems to be missing. I can't place my finger on it, but this beer certainly doesn't quite compete with the best in the business. Good but not great."

"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass; release #12 bottled 7/22/2012. Pours nearly opaque clear dark reddish brown color with a 1-2 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of chocolate, pumpkin, caramel, cocoa, roasted malt, cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, toast, vanilla, dark bread, ginger, and roasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt, pumpkin, and spice notes; with great strength. Taste of big chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, pumpkin, caramel, cinnamon, toast, clove, nutmeg, vanilla, ginger, dark bread, and roasted earthiness. Lingering notes of chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, toast, pumpkin, cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, ginger, dark bread, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic balance, complexity, and robustness of dark malt, pumpkin, and spice flavors; with a great malt/spice balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very creamy and moderately slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent pumpkin porter! All around great balance, robustness, and complexity of dark malt, pumpkin, and spice flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."

"22 ounce bottle, Release #9, 8.1% ABV. I checked Epic's website, and it says it was brewed on 6/26/2012, packaged on 7/8/2012. Looks like our local beer stores are still selling last year's bottles since I just picked this up a few weeks ago, kinda surprised since I didn't see it around last year. Oh well, this should still be good. Served in a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass, the beer pours dark brown with about an inch tan head that stayed around for a long time. There's also a good amount of lacing. The brew smells like roasted/grainy malt, pumpkin, nutmeg, cloves, bittersweet chocolate and cinnamon. Taste is similar to the aroma, but with the addition of some ginger. Nice mix between pumpkin and porter. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's coating, smooth and easy to drink with moderate carbonation. I liked this brew a lot, although I would like to try a fresher bottle of this at some point. Definitely worth a try. $5.99 a bomber."

"Flavor-wise, this beer comes across like a rich, chocolate-spicy pumpkin cookie. Somewhat light feel overall, but the aroma and taste make this a beer worth exploring. Excellent depth and complexity with the flavors. A really good, interesting twist on the pumpkin ale style."

"O - I originally had this beer on tap and loved it. It is not as great out of the bottle. This is definitely a beer that improves as it get closer to room temperature. Porters and stouts are a style I think is better suited for pumpkin beer. The chocolate and roasted malts are complimentary to the pumpkin spices."
""
"O: I've had several pumpkin porters/stouts recently and to me they just don't work as the pumpkin gets hidden. That being said, pumpkin advertising aside, this is a decent porter, but not worth the $12 price of admission"
""
""
""
"O: Not bad, (I"""m only like 4 beers in, but...) Epic still hasn't disappointed me! Thank you!"
""
""
"O - Interesting but would rather have a full blown pumpkin beer."
""
"Busy looking orange label that I probably wouldn't have realized was a pumpkin ale had I not read the fine print. Says it is a pumpkin porter, though, which sounded intriguing. Pours basically black with a thin off white head. Looks good! Cinnamon, nutmeg, and chocolaty notes on the nose, maybe a hint of vanilla, which comes through more in the flavor. Didn't get a lot of pumpkin flavor from this though. Certainly get chocolate, vanilla and spice. I think it would be more accurately described as a """spiced vanilla porter with hints of pumpkin", but I didn't think this was an """epic""" pumpkin ale or anything, actually kind of suprised by the higher ratings. But what do I know? Anyway, recommend for someone who likes vanilla porters. Not for me."
""
""
""
"Rated to style. A nice brew, very well done for a spice (pumpkin) brew. Recommended for the connoisseur of fine pumpkin ales."
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel/Overall: Medium bodied with perfect carbonation. Very good mouthfeel. Overall, besides the aforementioned dryness, this was an excellent pumpkin beer. I enjoy a good pumpkin beer when fall rolls around, but most of them end up being misses for me. This however was one of the better and more creative efforts I have tried."

"Overall: Amazing beer. Quite complex, a nice change from the usual pumpkin beer suspects. My favorite pumpkin beer to date. It's almost like a flavorful pumpkin ale, with less spice, and then chocolate undertones added."
""
""
"Poured into an Elysian snifter. Pours a very dark mahogany brown with a thin light tan head that dissipates to patches and a thin ring around the glass. Aroma of toasted malt, roasted pumpkin, hints of vanilla and dark dried fruit. Flavor of light toasted malt, mild pumpkin, burnt toast, light vanilla, some nuttiness; finishes with charred, non-aromatic coffee and bitterning hops. Medium bodied. An interesting take on a pumpkin beer that leans more towards a toasty porter than most, but does not have the body or heavy malt of a pumpkin porter. A nice change of pace on the boundary of the two styles. It will not knock Elysian's Dark of the Moon or Great Pumpkin off their thrones, but is a pleasant alternative."
""
""
"Overall-This is a great beer. My issue with it is the fact that there is almost zero pumpkin in it. With last years brew the pumpkin with subtle but it was definitely there, a great fall weather, Thanksgiving beer. This year this is just straight porter with very little pumpkin to speak of. One of the things I like most about Epic is that their fruit beers aren't usually overpowering, the beer still holds centerstage and the fruit just adds another layer. Don't get me wrong, this is a really good beer. It's just not a pumpkin beer."
""
"o.a. nothing special."

"I'm pretty bummed to find out that Release #9 was bottled in July of 2012. This beer started hitting shelves in my area, so I assumed it was a fresh version. I'm not sure what the deal is with that. I would assume this beer would be tastier while fresh. It's not bad, but I was really hoping it would be more vibrant. I think I'm being nice too."
""
""
""
"Overall I thought this was a good beer and a pretty good example of the style, the pumpkin flavors worked nicely with the porter base and the balance was also pretty nice. This beer had decent drinkability, it was smooth and not too filling, with some nice flavors that held my attention, I could drink a whole bottle of this but more than that and I think it would start to wear on me. What I liked the most about this beer was the aroma, it was pretty good, it was so unique how it smelled like a bag of mixed Halloween candy. What I liked the least about this beer was the mouthfeel, it just felt a little too watery for the style. I would buy a bottle of this again next year, I would like to try it fresh, it's expensive but I got 20% off since it was older stock, but I think $12 is too much for this beer, I would recommend this to anyone who likes pumpkin beers. All in all I was happy with this beer, everything worked well together and the spices weren't overdone. So far this is up there as one of the better Pumpkin Ale's I have had. Good job guys, this was a nice collaboration and I will be on the search for more brews from both brewerys, keep up the good work."

"O - Not a bad porter.. A great scent on this one."
""
"The porter attributes are definitely still all the showcase here. The pumpkin is not over done. Very nice and extremely complex for a sweet pumpkin beer. Just well crafted all around."
"Lighter medium body, decent carbonation, thin, watery and sticky on the tongue. I'm notorious in my group for hating on pumpkin beers, and stuff like this is exactly why. Simply too much in nearly every category - too sweet, too boozy, too spicy, too thin. I enjoy some of Epic's beers but this is a pretty large miss for me."
"Black body with a light brown head. Good retention and spots of lace. Nose has some light pumpkin pie spicing, some roast, smoke and some peripheral vegetal and anise. Taste is roasty and drying, cocoa, pumpkin pie spicing midpalate and into the finish. Creamy thinner medium body and medium low carbonation. A nice pumpkin spiced porter, much nicer as it warms."
""
"Overall: 3.0/5 Flavors weren't in balance, too much spice and bitter aftertaste turned me off."
"And the spices could have been betterMediumm mouthfeel. Liam's bottle."
"A"
""
""
""
"A decent beer in its own right, but Pumpkin Ales with Porter/Stout bases have never really done it for me. Pretty easy drinking at 7.7%. The alcohol is well hidden."
"Would I buy it again? Yes."
""
"Opened this bottle with a friend on Thanksgiving. Poured into a pint glass. Pours a dark brown with a small beige head. The aroma is pumpkin, bread, vanilla, and fresh cookies. Moderate carbonation bolsters this beer, but there's some slickness to it that detracts from it a bit. Finishes with a little snap of bubbles. Good flavor profile with obvious pumpkin, though it's not as bold as some in the style. It melds well with vanilla sweetness, milk chocolate, light coffee. Well-rounded flavors that aren't pronounced in any one area. A pleasant bounty of holiday flavors. A good pumpkin beer, that isn't a one-trick pony. A nice Thanksgiving treat."
"Bitch, bitch, bitch, DC... Anyway, this stuff pours a clear tawny-orange topped by finger of khaki foam. The nose comprises mild roasted malts, light vanilla bean, light coffee, brown sugar, watered-down molasses, and a touch of dark greens. The taste brings in more of the same, with the spices coalescing into the roast, creating a full, rounded, thoroughly """dark""" flavor combination. In the background lurks a bit of what seems like pumpkin seeds (never tell me there could be pumpkin involved...). The body is a limber medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda drying finish. Overall, a very nice pumpkin porter, one that finds a way to not only not overdo it on the spices, but to have them actually augment the otherwise mild roastiness. Good times."
"O - Sort of reminds me of Hershey's chocolate milk spiked with spices. Which gives me other ideas obviously. Nice porter."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a very good porter, I would drink again"
""
""
"Cola-colored with a frothy beige head. Aroma of spice and roasted malts. Balanced, with hints of spice and pumpkin but also more traditional, roasted porter flavors. Vanilla, nutmeg, allspice, cinnamon, ginger and cloves according to the website, and I think I can pick up most of those (definitely the vanilla, allspice and cinnamon). Overall, though, really balanced -- as much porter as pumpkin, which I respect and appreciate. Spiced to enhance flavor, not overpower it. Just really well done and great for a chilly Saturday afternoon."
""
"Overall a really good imperial porter and a perfect beer for a chilly Halloween night."

"overall: one of the better pumkins i have had, would buy again next year, and enjoy the epic fermentation eithout representation series of beers throughout the year."
""
"This has to be the best if not a close second best pumpkin beer I've ever had. It poured dark brown with light head into a snifter. The smell is of cocoa, pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg and peanut butter. The taste of this beer I only can describe as a peanut butter cup made with pumpkin spice. This beer goes down extremely smooth and creamy. Overall I loved this beer, of course I love peanut butter cups and pumpkin spice stuff. So if you like both those things just imagine them combined."
""
"Finishes well, aside from a bit thin mid-mouth taste this beer just hit me right on a fall night with a real chill in the brisk wind. Seemed just about perfect for the occasion and the best pumpkin styled porter I have had."
"O= This is a great beer. Super nice pumpkin flavor to it and a great overall beer. This is the second great Epic beer I've had in as many days. They are winning me back."
""
"Overall, I would say that this is a very average (at best) pumpkin porter. I am not a huge fan of """clove forward""" pumpkin ales and this one is definitely clove dominated. Wish there were a better representation of other spices and a heavier chocolate element personally. I actually ended up drinking about 2/3 of the bomber and pouring the rest of it out. Something about it just got very off-putting to me after a while. Too bad...I was looking forward to this one."
"Note: Release #7"
""
"O: A very interesting take on a pumpkin beer, the pumpkin and pumpkin pie spices really add to the depth of flavor of the porter. Enjoyable and pretty easy to drink - the alcohol is well hidden."

"I am not a pumpkin beer fan. I always feel like I want to be, and then I find myself overwhelmed with cinnamon and nutmeg. This one gets it right, and in my opinion is the best pumpkin seasonal out there. I will be buying more tomorrow."
""
"This beer literally tastes like pumpkin pie with a scoop with a whipped cream on top. Rich creamy mouthfeel with a bold pumpkin flavor up front. Sweet biscuit malts are followed by big pumpkin flavor and fresh vanilla. Semi-smoked dark malts with an earthy hop bitterness. The Balance in this beer is impeccable. Cinnamon, allspice, cardamon and clove make an appearance on the back end of tongue while the beer finishes with big whipped cream and chocolate flavor. As much as every pumpkin beer wants to be """pumpkin pie in a glass""" this is the only beer that has truly pulled it off while still having a big beer flavor."
"Taste starts with bitter cocoa nibs and coffee. Slightly sharp and almost astringent. Milk chocolate and roasted barley settle in. Some gourdy sweetness as well. Vanilla and ginger show up in the finish with lingering roasted bitterness. Medium-full body with a slightly slick feel. Tasty and well done."
"O- a nice pumpkin ale. Very smooth and tasty, for me this one is better than the ever-famous pumking."
"Pretty good, I have yet to be disappointed by these guys."
""
""
"o: a wonderful mix of two style, with equal representation for both. after the disappointment of Starr Hill's pumpkin porter, it was nice to have one done right."
"8%ABV. per bottle label.Poured a deep roasted chesnut brown with a thinner light tan colored had atop.Aromas were on the lighter side with some vanilla and mild roast mainly.The flavor of this beer makes it with its complexity and how good it is,lightly roasted with some pie spice but the pumpkin flavor really stands out,a lingering vanilla flavor over top of roast in the finish.I think this beer is vastly underrated,it's complex and flavorful.I think Epic makes some top notch beer,this is top notch for the fall season.Got get some."
"O: The close to $9 price tag for the bomber is not making me happy, but if this is going to be a regular offering in Southern CA in the pumpkin beer style, I'll certainly buy it because it is a good beer in the end, and frankly it doesn't get much better than this in the pumpkin beers offered in the Southland. We don't get Pumking of course. Epic continues to make good stuff."
"O - Saved this from last Spring when I bought it. Enjoyed with one with a friend. Really good porter. I recommend trying this one as it is different but delicious."
"Pours a clear dark brown with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, lots of pumpkin pie spices, and some cocoa aromas. Taste is much the same with a nice spice finish. There is a mild amount of roasty and spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with some solid aromas and flavors that make it tasty and easy to drink."
"Pours a deep amber to black in color with a tan head. In the aroma, notes of vanilla, cinnamon, and nutmeg. In the taste, spicy upfront with a small roast, to a smooth nutmeg and vanilla in the end. A spice like bite and a medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry roast to pumpkin pie like aftertaste. A little pumpkin pie flavor in a nice, mellow porter."
""
"O: It's good, but it's not amazing. The flavors are nice, but it's too watery for my tastes and the booze is evident in a 7.6% beer. With so many pumpkin beers on the market, I'd skip over this one and try some of the others."
""
"Medium carbonation with a medium body. The finish is ever so slightly drying to the palate. It's a beer to enjoy, not a session beer, and I will treat it as such."
"Brewers' Commentary: """Our first ever collaborative beer has all the familiar flavors of the season, but done with Epic style. To a base of strong, roasty, and chocolaty porter, we add 200 pounds of real pumpkin per batch, five spices and whole Madagascar vanilla beans. As you pour this deeply ruby brown beer, you’re greeted by the aroma of fresh cut squash,followed by rich chocolate. The flavor starts sweet with marshmallow,vanilla, and some pumpkin pie, then yields to a coffee roast and darkchocolate dryness. This beer is a great introduction for curious drinkers and a special holiday treat for fans of the style.""""
"A nice big glass of Pumpkin Porter, not really the season but damn it's interesting and a collaboration with DC Brau and Epic no less. Pours pitch black maybe light ruby highlights as it pours, dark tan head foaming thick. Aroma bright spice, big fleshy pumpkin gourds, with dark caramelized sugars coating the malts and vegetable additions. Beautiful beer I'm really enjoying the blend of flavors as it warms, fruity/gourd flesh...sugar coated dark roasts mix into a unique and wonderful beer along with light pumpkin spice enjoying every sip. Mouthfeel is a bit thin with even carbonation strong spices left behind between sips. Wonderful roasted malt pumpkin spice blended nicely with a moderate alcohol level, so interesting...I've never had anything else like this quite nice, something I will seek out again in the future."
""
""
"I really like this beer. It's got great pumpkin aroma and flavor, and the mouthfeel is exquisite. Main complaint is that the porter isn't more present (and since they bill it as an """imperial pumpkin porter", that's a problem)."
""
"Overall this is the first Epic Brewery beer I ever had and it lived up to everything the guys at Vintage Estate told me it would be. If they keep on brewing it I will have to pick up a second bottle eventually. Worth trying if you seek tasty, obscure beers."
"im a huge fan of pumpkin beers, so even out of season i was stoked to try this one. not sure ive had a pumpkin porter that wasnt made by a homebrewer before. pours a glowing ruby brown color quite dark but as much brown ale as porter in appearance. small tan head. smells quite sweet, chocolate, vanilla, candied yams. like thanksgiving dessert. flavor is complex as anything, fresh pumpkin takes over in the beginning and wanes to a chocolate coffee dark roasty malty finish. i really enjoy the flavor trip of this one, constantly changing. mouthfeel was nice, could use a bit more carbonation in my opinion to carry it forward, but its medium body make it plenty drinkable. maybe a little too sweet for me, but it works here. overall a fabulous pumpkin beer, i think the squashy flavors work very well in a dark fuller bodied brew. i hope to get my hands on more come autumn."
"Pours a dark brown color with a two finger khaki colored head which recedes to skim and leaves gobs of sticky lace on the glass. The aroma starts out with a chocolate and roasty character which then gives way to a vanilla and pumpkin. The aroma's seem to be fighting each other though and do not flow evenly into each other. The taste follows suit, with a the coffee and dark chocolate characters coming first along with a roasty backbone. The pumpkin then comes through at the middle and the back. Again it seems to be fighting itself just a little bit. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated and sticky. Overall it was an okay beer, it seemed to get in the way of itself a little. The flavors were nice but it didn't seem to flow."
"O: A good offering from Epic Brewing / DC Brau. This was my first DC Brau, which is disappointing because I live right outside of DC, but their distribution is poor. At any rate, a nice Imperial Pumpkin Porter. Easy drinking brew. Would definitely drink again."
""
"O: Overall a nice pumpkin influence and spicing with a decent imperial porter malt base. Worthy a try."
"This was solid, being an Imperial Porter with a nice range of flavors and enough of an ABV to help take the chill off a bit. This was a tasty sipper."
"Overall: a bit dissappointed with this as the vanilla beans really show through here without the woody tones a bourbon barrel beer may have. I really didn't taste any pumkin here as to me this was more of a vanilla porter."
""
"Interestingly enough, this beer does actually have some real pumpkin noticeable in both the aroma and flavor; it is light, but certainly adds some tartness and a bit of a squash / vegetal note to this beer. The spice character here is actually somewhat restrained compared to most pumpkin beers and it actually works pretty well. I am surprised that I am not getting an anise aroma or flavor from this beer though as that seems to be one of the more noticeable notes in beers that have had Five-Spice added to them; though perhaps this blend of Five-Spice is different. An interesting go at a Pumpkin Porter; it could really use a touch more body and rounded malt flavor to balance out the spiciness and the roast bitterness that can be a touch distracting in this beer."
"From the first sip pumpkin hits you, but then fades to chocolate and keeps you coming back for more. A great, great beer especially for the colder months."
"O. A pretty decent beer, but could use a more over the top pumpkin flavor. It was very blended and more simple than what you normally get from Epic."
"D-I like this more than most pumpkin beers as I feel that a richer base beer really works in a spiced beer's favor. However, I think I prefer Summit's take on a Pumpkin Porter to this incarnation."
"Overall, I could take it or leave it. This was an interesting blind beer, but I can't say I'd seek out more."
""
"The mouthfeel is good, an appropriate medium body with moderate carbonation setting the stage for a fairly thick and creamy brew."
""
""
"Overall a solid brew enjoyable and fun to drink surprised I haven't seen a pumpkin porter before."
"O - This was a pretty good porter overall, though there was a bit too much ginger and vanilla flavor that pushed the pumpkin back into the background. The mouthfeel was nice and smooth, and the best overall feature of this beer. It was nice to try a mix of pumpkin and porter flavors, but this wasn't a brew that stood out for me."
"I enjoyed this offering. A light porter, but full on the spice and pumpkin to make this a solid offering. I appreciate non-traditional takes on the pumpkin ale. Not every one has to be an amber or brown base."
""
"D: This was a surprisingly good pumpkin porter. The scent was generic, but the taste was unique and well balanced. It had nice body too, with well hidden alcohol, so it was easy to drink. Recommended to at least try."
"Overall: I really enjoyed this beer. A nice seasonal offering from Epic and one of my favorite autumn seasonals this year. This could be one offered to newbies, if they enjoy porters in the first place."
"This beer isn't bad, but it is fairly uninspiring and lacking any depth of flavor. As my buddy said, “if you're going to call a beer an imperial pumpkin porter, it better have pumpkin. Or at least taste like an imperial porter.”"
""
"This is a fantastic beer! I'm surprised it hasn't received higher reviews thus far. I'm typically not a fan of the pumpkin infused brews, but I could drink this at any gathering. It is very sweet, certainly there is the flavor of pumpkin but it isn't overwhelming in any sense and it feels mush less cheap that the typical Sam Adams entry. It pours a good frothy head that dissipates relatively quickly. The aroma is pleasant. The mouthfeel is smooth and agreeable without an overriding sense of alcohol or sweetener. I drank at about room temperature and was only disappointed when the bottle was empty. The brew is flying off the shelves in the D.C. area and I haven't met anyone not thrilled with the product."
"O: I think this is a good spiced winter porter, but could have used more flavor of the pumpkin. Otherwise, I think the brewery should go a little lighter on the vanilla bean, cinnamon, clove, and whatever else was used in this beer, if they would like to market it as a pumpkin porter."
""
"O: This one really surprised me. I was in no way expecting this to be as charming as it is. DC Brau & Epic have assembled one of the better pumpkin beers of 2011, and one I could actually stomach more then 5oz of. I hope this sees the shelves again next year. Well done, gents."
"Overall this was an interesting experiment that is somewhat successful. It still has the roasted dark malt qualities of a porter with a subtle pumpkin presence. The spices are what really give it a seasonal feel. They are a bit heavy for my liking, overpowering the other notes a bit but this is still a pretty solid beer."
"Overall this was a pretty good beer, but fell short of my expectations. It's basically a good porter with very light hints of spice and pumpkin. The aromas got my hopes up thinking I found a Mid Sun TREAT replacement but the flavor profile fell miles short. Not bad, just not amazing. I wouldn't turn it down if someone gave it to me for free but I don't plan to revisit anytime soon."
"D/O: I genuinely enjoyed this brew. It didn't seem like """novelty beer""" to me, as most pumpkin's do. Repeatable."
"O- Surprisingly impressed. Probably not something I would drink often but solid."
"4.0 D: There aren't a lot of great pumpkin beers out there, but this one at least gets close. Solid all-around aside from maybe the mouthfeel."
"Overall- A great tasting beer, but a big let down for being an imperial pumpkin porter. Its worth trying, but don't rush for this one."
"O - I found Epic/DC Brau's collaboration to be a good one. Pumpkin + Porter is a great combination and I hope that this beer will make a future appearance in both's lineups. A nice seasonal to close the Fall out with!"
"This is only the second pumpkin beer I've had that combined the pumpkin with a darker roasted beer, and I'm totally sold as a fan. While Pumpking still reigns supreme, these darker pumpkin beers are, in general, much better tasting than the typical ale style pumpkin beer. Definitely recommend this one if you can find it!"
""
"Overall perhaps porter and pumpkin equals success! Quite suprised with this one, neat take and another good brew."
""
"O: Not my favorite BUT not too overpowering in any sense. Both the pumpkin and porter aspects were light and worked ok together. I would prefer a touch more roastiness."
""
"Other reviewers were disappointed with the lack of pumpkin present. Frankly, I was pleasantly surprised as I'm not sure I really want a pumpkin bomb. So, before you imbibe set your pumpkin expectation low and enjoy the excellent porter with nuanced pumpkin and spice."
"Overall...not a horrible beer but it wasn't what I was hoping. I bought it simply because it was a PUMPKIN porter...and it has no pumpkin taste to it at all. So if this was simply a porter it would be great, the label says otherwise. I know Epic makes some good brews and this probably just needs to be tweaked some more to perfection. I can't knock it, but can't say I'd recommend this batch."

"Poured from bomber into tulip glass. Pours deeply ruby brown beer with light thin off-white head. Aroma of fresh cut squash, followed by rich chocolate. The flavor starts sweet with marshmallow, vanilla, and some pumpkin pie, then yields to a coffee roast and dark chocolate bitter dryness. Medium to full bodied. Did not pick up very much pumpkin on this one though I did recognize some of Epic's and DC Brau's typical traits from their flagship brews. Quite disappointed with this interesting offering."
"O- overall a decent brew, but didn't meet my expectation for an imperial pumpkin porter. I was hoping for more body and more spices."
"Medium body, lighter carbonation leading to a nice creamy feel. A bit of warmth, but really seems to fit in well. Nice beer."

"M/O: Very rich and drinkable beer. Good blend of flavor with some good carbonation and not overpowering alcohol."
"o - Overall a pretty good beer. Basically a good porter with very light hints of spice and pumpkin. Not a lot of pumpkin so it that is what you're looking for, just go with a normal pumpkin ale, but if you like porters, worth checking out."
"Pours an opaque deep brown to black color. Some faint pumpkin and spice aromas, but these are not as dominant as in many other pumpkin beers and give way to roasted malt aromas. On the palate, the pumpkin flavors are very restrained, I'd say they take a back seat to more typical roasted malt flavors of a porter, with some stout-like bitterness. A very drinkable and not overpowering pumpkin ale."
"O: epic brewing continues to impress my taste buds."
"Beer is not as pumpkiny as one might like, medium bodied, interesting but boring at the same time, mostly allspice coming through, it was fine but the Brau version was better."
""
""
"Pours a nearly-black deep brown color with a thin light tan head and not much in the way of lacing. Thin tan collar as it goes down. The nose carries some light pumpkin spice and plenty of porter character. Fairly roasty with a bit of chocolate. Faint spice. Flavor has chocolate and a fair amount of roast. Medium body with light carbonation and a nice full mouthfeel. Not over the top in any direction. Well done."
""
"Bravo Epic and DC Brau... you should be very proud of this one."
"Otherwise it's fairly similar and am overall pleased with it, I just think DC Brau might have the edge here."
"Pours nice and black with an attractive small-bead foam tan head. The sniff is not attractive, what little of it there is. Even after warming there is barely a thing to snuff on. Mild roast, slight veggie pumkin-squashiness, but most prominent is a metallic taste. I can only smell spices if I try to imagine it really hard with my brain parts. Taste follows pretty closely to the smell. A metallic twang on the finish really makes it hard to swallow. A bit light on body but the carbonation helps lend a nice fluffy full feeling. It's just not there."
"Notes: Glad to see a collaboration that tries something a touch unusual, and involving one of the best upcoming breweries in the region. EPIC on the other half of the equation is a nice surprise, this combo is among the best stuff I've tried from them."
"O: This is an interesting beer, I think its the 1st pumpkin beer ive had thats been a dark beer. I kinda like the balance between the roasted malts and pumpkin."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied and carbonation is moderate. Overall I thought it was a pretty good beer. I really liked that the spices were a little more reserved in it and some actual pumpkin seemed to come out. There are tons of spice bombs out there so it was a little refreshing for me that this was a little different. The porter characteristics were nice as well and the flavors worked pretty well together. Overall a pretty nice beer of the style."
"O: In all fairness, I've never had a Pumpkin Porter before. That being said, I was disappointed by this one. Maybe I just don't like the style, but I felt that the pumpkin/porter flavors could have been integrated better, as the porter side of this beer dominates the pumpkin. The smell gave me a lot of promise, but ultimately, the taste didn't live up to it. Also think the carbonation on this needs to be ratcheted up a touch. This one is slightly flat, sticky sweet, and really heavy. A decent brew and worth checking out, but I don't see myself revisiting this."
