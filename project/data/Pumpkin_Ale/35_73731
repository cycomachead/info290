The aroma is slightly more funky with some fruity tartness of sour cherry atop the predicted aromas of pumpkin, spice and malt for a incredibly curious but slightly more potent aroma. Despite having a flavor which comes through as shallow on pumpkin as the fresh vintage, the funk does manage to cut the graininess somewhat and make the beer slightly more enjoyable in flavor, otherwise most of the glaring imperfections remain. The texture and carbonation remain nearly the same, very slick and nearly under carbonated. In general it's just about as difficult to drink as a fresh Fat Jack and any aging just adds to the complications. If you have a bottle, I do not recommend storing it away.","Jadjunk","Oct 29, 2014"

Some spotty lacing is seen when sipped but not a lot. The aroma is full of pumpkin and spices! Very pleasant and makes me wish it was autumn! Lots more going on with the taste with a good amount of punkin flavor with some spice that probably consists of clove and nutmeg with some malts. Very tasty and medium bodied. Goes down easy with no bitter or harsh aftertaste at all. Perfect carbonation for this type of brew. One of the better pumpkin seasonals","BeerWithMike","Aug 26, 2014"

It also has notes of vanilla and a very mild bourbon like boozy character. In the middle of all this there is a very mild squash/sweet potatoe like sweetness. The finish brings some light herbal hop bitterness and dryness which blends with the dry spice within. The dry spice lingers and begs you to take another sip.","generallee","Aug 15, 2014"

But there’s just something so special about Pumking that this beer doesn’t capture, something that makes it like taking a bite of the world’s best pumpkin pie: I’m guessing it’s the pie crust malt and authentic pumpkin earthiness that this beer is lacking.

Caramel and toffee notes hit the tongue first, followed by subtle pumpkin and spice and a bit of heat from the booze. Smokiness shows up throughout and adds a layer of complexity. The beer drinks much more like an imperial stout or dark strong ale, with a thick mouthfeel and alcohol burn similar to those beers. Still, it is smooth, complex and overall quite enjoyable.

Aroma is sweet bready malt with cooked pumpkin nd hints of pumpkin pie spicing, mild. Flavor is sweet malt, gentle but distinct smokiness, toffee, glazed pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger. Very nice, medium to heavy, creamy body. A quite sweet pumpkin ale, but good pumpkin pie character and I really liked the smokiness; like eating pie around an open fire. I think this might have been a bit cloying without the smoked malt, but kudos to Boston Beer for making this fun to drink. The malt support really makes this stand apart from many pumpkin ales that are all about spicing. I liked this more than I expected to and will add it to my Fall beer rotation.","LiquidAmber","Sep 23, 2013"

It's a solid take on the style with a lot going on in the nose and palate, but to me it doesn't overdo any of the characteristics that it's going for. In a sea of over-spiced and/or over-sweetened pumpkin-soda-beers, this one stands on the higher end and will definitely be a brew I'll look forward to. If you're someone who generally partakes in the Sam Adams stigma and would have avoided it because of the name, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised if you reconsider and pick up a bomber or five.","lambpasty","Sep 21, 2013"

The resulting mouthfeel is slightly sluggish, a bit more carbonation would perhaps make the aroma more prominent and ease the sipping of this beer. I appreciate the heaviness of the beer, though, as this seems to complement both the heaviness of the flavors and the style in general. Ethanol warmth on the back of the palate and throat, not unpleasant. Finishes rather dry, with a bit of residual stickiness around the lips.","falloutsnow","Nov 18, 2012"

Usually pumpkin beers are at one end of the spectrum or the other, a gag full of pumpkin pie spice, or just a bland amount of pumpkin pulp with little spicing, this seems to balance a nice sweet spot inbetween.

Nothing spectaculr but a decent pumpkin beer with a nice big malty body.

4,10.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Overall I thought this was a good beer and a pretty damn good example of the style, it had everything I look for in a Pumpkin Ale with some nice balance and a pretty creamy mouthfeel. This beer had good drinkability, it went down pretty smooth and the 8.5% alcohol barely showed up in the taste, I think one bomber is the perfect amount with this beer, I couldn't see myself drinking another bottle after this one. What I liked the most about this beer was it's balance and the fact that it wasn't overly spiced and the creamy mouthfeel was also pretty noteworthy. What I liked least about this beer was nothing, I can't think of anything that I disliked or would change about this beer, it's fine just the way it is. I would buy another bottle of this if it's released next year, it's a good all around Pumpkin Ale, and it isn't that expensive, I recommend this beer to anyone looking for a good Pumpkin Ale. All in all I was pretty satisfied with this beer and I would say this is one of the best Pumpkin Ales that I have had this year but I don't think it knocks the now retired Screaming Pumpkin off as being my favorite Pumpkin Ale, but this was a pretty damn good one in it's own right and I'm glad that I took a chance on it. This is much better then their Harvest Pumpkin Ale and it's worthy of being put in bombers, good job guys this is one good Pumpkin Ale that's really hitting the spot on this cold Halloween night.","StoutHunter","Oct 31, 2012"
3.7,2.2,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Smells of a sweet caramel apple with plenty of toasted bread and pumpkin pie spice in layers on top of each other. The flavor has the same breadiness and pumpkin pie spice but with a touch more cinnamon hotness and plenty of brown sugar. Fresh, meaty pumpkin is actually identifiable within the flavor profile, as is a mild sort of milk chocolate background nuance. The ABV is semi-hidden, but does show up towards the end of the sip as a rising heat, which also helps to dry out the finish.","WastingFreetime","Oct 29, 2012"

Not really any pumpkin flavors per se, maybe they are there and the beef jerky smell is throwing me off. Taste is also not pumkiney, just hints of pumpkin pie spices.

The spices are slightly over-large, however, and the heavy alcoholic burn does somewhat detract from the flavors. And just at the edges of the beer is a very raw pumpkin flavor—not pumpkin pie-cooked, but raw straight from the gourd—which is also offsetting.

As the head gradually collapses, delicate and consistent sheets of lacing are revealed. Nose expresses all-spice, a hint of ginger and something else that I can't quite put my finger on. Taste consistent with nose; however, a pleasant toasty, malty backbone asserts itself and a suggestion of brown sugar also comes out. Mouthfeel is medium-light in body with a smooth and even carbonation and a light, oily texture - there's almost a silkiness to it. Overall, a very enjoyable pumpkin beer.

Looks delicious. Aromas of roasty sweet pumpkin with a mild blending of cinnamon, nutmeg, and all-spice that smell like pumpkin pie cooking in the next room. Flavors are super-rich, with a solid pumpkin backbone that is roasted and sugary sweet. The spices are highlighting throughout in a sharp, contrasting overtone that keeps the body from hitting the cloying mark on the palate.

The smell is dominated by the pie spices (nutmeg, ginger, cinnamon), sweet caramel malt and maybe a bit of chocolate. The taste is of the spices first. Those are backed by the malt which is pretty solid and well rounded with everything from caramels to chocolates represented. There is a bit of hop bitterness in there as well there is little to nothing in the way of hop flavor but the bitterness is there. The finish is relatively clean, just a little bitter, given the heavy spice character, the body is quite full and satisfying and the high alcohol is only very slightly evident at least to start but you'll feel it near the end. Overall this is a pretty good pumpkin ale. It tends to lean on the side of higher spiced versions but the spices are supported by a substantial malt base which makes it quite tasty and a pleasure to drink.","fank2788","Sep 01, 2012"

3.8,5,4,4,3.5,4,4,"O - After Samuel Adam's Harvest Pumpkin beer last year, Fat Jack virtually jumped off the shelf into my pumpkin ale-loving hands, but the beer doesn't live up to my well placed expectations. Looming much closer to a double amber or American strong ale, this beer is a malty beast with a touch of pumpkin to it; not quite carving out that "double pumpkin" niche. While I find nothing offensive (warming alcohol could be hidden better, however) Fat Jack just doesn't really excite me the way other pumpkin beers do. I will say though, that after a fall of bold pumpkin beers, this one will do wonderfully as a "table beer" at Thanksgiving, lightly suggesting pumpkin pie; foreshadowing dessert, and pairing well with turkey, mashed potatoes, and gravy!","BeerFMAndy","Aug 22, 2012"

(and i really like pumpkin pie) i think the brewers focused far too much on the spices in this beer, having cinnamon, nutmeg, and one or two other spices. I feel the ale would have been much more well rounded if they had only used one or two spices instead of three or four.Flavors in this beer were just far too overbearing, nothing smooth or balanced, maybe overpowering because its a "double pumpkin"...? Neither me or my beer padawan pal could finish this beer after four or five unpalatable swallows (we tried hard to like it) we ended up both pouring it. dont let your couriosity get the best of you with this one!","Beerlover","Aug 21, 2012"

For example, this imperial pumpkin of theirs is good, but in a few weeks, there will be plenty better to choose from. Always worth a buy and try if you're a pumpkin ale person or a fan of Sam Adams' creations.","Greywulfken","Beers"

3.65,0.8,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"A 32 oz growler from DeCicco's in Ardsley. Nice clear cola color with a decent somewhat creamy light khaki head. Some bits of lace here and there. Smell is roasty with toffee notes. Pumpkin is laced with a fair amount of spice. Some dark bread and dark figgy/plum sweetness. A touch of alcohol too. Taste is a bit forward on the spice but it works with the sticky sweet pie like malt and gourd blend to come across nicely. Broad malt core gives a good bready "crust" for the pie flavors to ride on. Nutmeg, cinnamon, vanilla, they are all here and in harmony. As I continue with this one and it warms up the flavors really start to come together with a dark roasted pumpkin center and the spices doing a nice job of taming the fusel alcohol bits that come in the finish. The finish is clean and dry with light alcohol twang and faint graham, pumpkin, and toffee sweet brown bread. Quite drinkable in spite of the abv and spicy nature. Overall a solid player, kind of like a spicier, darker, roastier, Pumpking. The $7.99 for the growler really gives this a lot of value and I am considering another for the Thanksgiving weekend. I'll say it again, solid brew.","scootny","Oct 27, 2011"
