In my opinion, there’s no balance here at all, the sourness of this beer just overpowers everything, and I can’t taste much of the malt or sweetness.  Sour fans will probably love this beer, but alas, I do not.  Sorry New Belgium, this one was a strike out for me.","Jeffreysan","Jan 26, 2015"

3.75,10.6,,,,,,"At first taste, this beer was too sour and too much cranberry flavor.  It lacked any hop flavor or aroma.  I initially rated it 3.375. However, as I have worked through the 6 pack over several weeks, it has grown on me. It is still sour and needs hops, but the after taste is that of pumpkin spice reminiscent of Belgian beers or a fine hefeweizen. In the end, New Belgium lived up to their goal of brewing in the Belgian style however untraditional. Thus the improved rated to 3.75.","Dandub33","Dec 08, 2014"

Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also the addition of some nutmeg, tart cranberry and some earthiness.  The cranberry gets stronger as the beer warms.  Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit slick and has moderate carbonation.  It's also easy to drink.  I think it's a good pumpkin ale overall, the addition of the cranberry puts a nice spin on it.  I enjoyed it!  $8.99 a 6-pack.","bluejacket74","Sep 16, 2014"

It’s a well-balanced mix, and Pumpkick is an easy-to-drink, light-bodied pumpkin ale that maybe isn’t huge or overwhelming, but is quite drinkable and one I’d easily purchase again.","secondtooth","Sep 15, 2014"

I can't taste any pumpkin nor anything else for that matter. Refreshing but not much going on. Still don't know why they call this pumpkick as there is absolutely no pumpkin whatsoever. Should have called it cranberry kick. It's a so so beer that to me is better enjoyed in the summer. If you are a pumpkin fan this will be a big disappointment.

Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, brown sugar, toast, brown bread, floral, light cranberry, and herbal earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of malt, pumpkin, and spice notes with slight cranberry presence; and good strength. Taste of pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, brown sugar, toast, brown bread, and herbal earthiness. Minimal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, brown sugar, toast, brown bread, and herbal earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice balance and complexity of malt, spice, and pumpkin flavors; with nearly zero cranberry presence and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and fairly crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice pumpkin ale. All around well balanced malt, spice, and pumpkin flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Sep 30, 2013"

I will buy more this season for sure.","StonedTrippin","Sep 28, 2013"

But they don’t play well together and the dry, lingering and somewhat unpleasant finish (like licking a piece of chalk) doesn’t help. Avoid.","elNopalero","Sep 14, 2013"

Smell is of malt, pumpkin pie spice, and slight cranberry aromas. Taste is much the same with slightly tart berry and pumpkin pie spice flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an average beer that smells pretty good with the pumpkin pie spices working well with the cranberry, but the taste of these two aspects does not mesh all that well in my opinion.","UCLABrewN84","Aug 31, 2013"

Pours a medium coppery amber with a half finger white head that dissipates to patchy foam and light ring around the glass, leaving patchy lacing. Aroma of cooked pumpkin, cinnamon, faint malt, very vegetal. Flavor brings in more of the cranberry juice, with pumpkin, grassy hops, holiday spices and malt that is covered by the pumpkin and cranberry. I bit on the sour side, as might be expected from cranberries. Light bodied with active peppery carbonation. An interesting take on an pumpkin ale, but not my preference for malt body; a bit too light malt and a bit too sour. The beer is only modestly sour, but perhaps unbalanced by it.

Nose starts with heavy fleshy pumpkin character that comes off in a vegetal way. Mild notes of allspice and clove follow that and not much cranberry character to speak of, maybe a tinge of cran tartness at the finish. Taste is very nondescript in terms of pumpkin character. There is a wave of light cranberry tartness that seems to neutralize the pumpkin spices. The spice picks up a bit towards the finish with allspice being the most prominent note. The flavors are a little muddled which seems to make this beer lacking in the flavor department. Mouthfeel is light and well carbonated. Overall, this is a very mild flavored pumpkin ale and he cranberry doesn't come through in that thanksgiving dinner kind of way. Come to think of it, I'm not really sure why cranberry is being paired with pumpkin in the first place... It works with turkey and stuffing, but can't say I've ever really paired it with pumpkin pie. But I digress, this one is very forgettable.","homebrew311","Aug 23, 2013"

This beer had decent drinkability, it was smooth and not filling, but the taste didn't do a great job at holding my attention, one would be enough for me, but if I was offered a few of these I could probably dink them but I don't think I would enjoy them that much. What I liked the most about this beer was the appearance and aroma, they were both nice and the highlights of this beer. What I liked least about this beer was the mouthfeel, it was pretty bland with not much life to it. I wouldn't buy this beer again, 12 is enough for me for the season and I think I'll save one or two of these for October to see if my opinion has changed. I wouldn't recommend this as a good Pumpkin beer, it's priced nicely, but it's not really a bang for your buck. All in all I wasn't impressed with this beer and when it comes to Pumpkin beers it falls right in the middle, it wasn't great or memorable by any means but there wasn't anything offensive about it. New Belgium is a pretty solid brewery, but I think they missed the mark with this one and I would like it better if the pumpkin and cranberry flavors were highlighted more, better luck next time guys.","StoutHunter","Aug 16, 2013"

With monsters like Southern Tier Warlock & Pumpking, Saint Arnold Pumpkinator, Rogue Pumpkin Patch, and DFH Punkin out there, this one is decent, but not mind-blowing. However; if you want a pumpkin beer that is light and easy to drink, that also packs a decent punch that just might club you over the head, and then take your wallet when you aren't looking, give it a try. You might not be too impressed, but you won't necessarily be let down either. Cheers!","StuporJew","Aug 13, 2013"

I didn't even know you could juice a pumpkin... Anyway, this stuff pours a clear auburn-bronze topped by a finger of off-cream foam. The nose comprises white toast, a pinch of clove, a half-pinch of cinnamon, a half-dash of brown sugar, mild caramel, and a strange mini-undertow of what seems like chicken gravy. The taste brings in more of the same, with the spices all blending together into a muddled stream of near-nothingness that culminates in a gulf of rather hard water. This also serves to water down the caramel a bit. Still no sign of the cranberry (though there is a tinge in the back of the finish, but that could just be psychosomatic). The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slick feel. Overall, a pretty meek little beer, one that not only doesn't bring the spice, but one that doesn't really try to express itself in much of any way. Boo this.","TMoney2591","Aug 12, 2013"

3.93,15.9,3.75,3.75,4,4,4,"The beer pours slightly hazy amber with lots of visible tiny bubbles and a thin, off-white head. The aromas of pumpkin and cranberry are present. I also get some mild earthiness and along with the cinamon, nutmeg, and allspice. The taste follows the nose. The spice is present in the front and back along with plenty of pumpkin and cranberry. You would never guess this beer is 6% ABV. The body is medium to full with spritzy carbonation. This beer still drinks pretty easy despite that. This is a very good beer.","acevenom","Aug 05, 2013"
