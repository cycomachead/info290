"Taste is cinnamon, clove, toasted malt, with light maple in the background.  The maple is not as pronounced as I would have thought it would be.  This to me is a slightly above average pumpkin ale.  I do have others that I prefer in the style."
"Very flavorful creation.Unique taste right from the start.The squash works well.I can drink this beer anytime,not just in the Fall.Nice abv.adds to the experience.Overrall,this beer is tremendous."
"So, working under the impression that what I have in front of me is anything like what it's meant to be like fresh, I think that this is a really interesting beer. For the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays, and then going forward into the colder months, I occasionally enjoy a spiced beer with my meal, followed by a Barleywine after dinner as I relax - and this beer combines both of those into one! Well worth trying!"
"Amber to copper in color with a touch of head.  Smells a bit like raw squash with background (all)spice.  Taste is dominated by allspice, nutmeg, maybe cinnamon with background squash flavor and a lite sweetness.  Carbonation is lighter with a medium  body.  Overall a different take on a pumpkin and worth a try."

"Smells great... but too sweet and too much spice. Had great body... and nice tan head."
"Mouthfeel is rich and smooth.  This is one of the better Pumpkin Ales out there."

"O –  Definitely  try if you get the chance."
"This didn't work for me, but someone who likes squash might dig it a bit more."

"I am not a fan of pumpkin ales, but this one blew me away to the point where I actually sought it out and bought it in the bottle.  The label states it is made with butternut squash.  The beer is well-balanced, with the slight sweetness and taste of maple, and just enough spice notes and pumpkin (squash?) flavor to make it known, but not diminish the flavor of the beer."

"Pancakes. This is what you drink with pancakes. Strong maple aroma and taste dominates. Fantastic for those with a sweet tooth. ABV doesn't hit until it is too late."

"Overall – A rather nice and sweet thick and tasty pumpkin pie flavored brew with a huge maple syrup presence.  While at 9.5% abv., the alcohol is barely detectable and makes for a fantastic sipping dessert brew. Definitely one to try if you get the chance."
"Overall: Pretty good, although maybe too subdued. A little more pumpkin and a little less spice and this would be stellar."
"awesome beer"

" The taste is good with light spice up front with more of a fruity yeast flavor and subtle maple type fruity earthiness with sweet element and light spice mid palate. The taste carries a subtle vanilla-like earthiness which also comes off sweet with mild floral aspect. The maple taste comes through as a sweet woody taste with alcohol adding a dry quality to the finish without tasting hot. This is a very good beer, nicely flavored with pleasant spice profile and moderate sweetness that works well with moderately high level of alcohol for the sake of complexity yet still drinkable for the strength"

"My favorite pumpkin beer by far. I have had Pumpking, Warlock, Schlafly Pumpkin Ale, Punkn; IMHO the Maple Mistress is better then some of the """best""". While all of the above will satisfy your taste for pumpkin, the Maple Mistress had a number of other flavors that will awaken your palate."

"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a pretty orange/copper color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is like pumpkin pie. Taste is unique an d quite good. Maple and pumpkin dominate, with alcohol not far behind. A good bit of spice, and a tasty treat of a beer. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is worth seeking out."

"Pours a dark hazy copper amber with a short lived medium beige head. There is an essence of pumpkin and vegetable along with some mild notes of sweet spice and maple. Taste is sweet flavors a spices and some bit of malt with some bitterness. Palate is a medium body with moderate carbonation. The finish is same as taste, a combination of sweet spices, squash pumpkin vegetable and mild bitterness on the end. A bit strong ( on the alcohol ). Malt and maple flavor is weak. Overall though just an OK brew."
"Terrible beer.  Maple syrup does not belong in a beer."
"Very malty with just a hint of punpkin.  This beer should not even have pumpkin in the tittle"

"This is absolutely the worst pumpkin beer I have ever had.  First I went to the brewery to try the beer and it was completely warm and flat when it came off the tap.  Very disappointed!  I met the owner who told me the beer was not flat and if I did not like the carbonation then to leave.  Besides the terrible beer the owner of the brewery was completely rude.  I assume he was the owner.  Short awkward looking guy with a tattoo on his arm.  He must be very insecure when it comes to his beer.  I would never buy this beer again or go back to Saucony Creek."

"Must say did not realize how high the ABV was on this until got on this website b/c I didn't get any booze at all in the finish."

"O- Spices and maple syrup are the main flavors, pretty done. Glad I pick this up, will pick up up again next year when it is fresh."

"O- An interesting take that plays well with the maple and spices. The pie crus flavor of the malt was an inspired touch as well"

"Pours a brownish-copper color with a finger of off-white head. The head retains for quite some time and leaves some lacing on the glass. The most pronounced note in the nose is pumpkin. The flavor profile has maple and brown sugar upfront. The taste of the pumpkin is completely overwhelmed by the maple and brown sugar. The finish is semi-dry with an alcohol bite that sneaks up as the beer warms and becomes unpleasant by the end of the glass."

"Split this bottle with another in a wine glass. I've been anxious to try this beer. I see it locally a lot. It has a thick mouth feel, very sweet cloying cordial like dessert taste. Delicious sipper on a cold night. Very impressive. Kind of a silly looking bottle although I have seen worse."

"Pretty darn tasty beer, and given the massive variety of pumpkin ales out there, this one has some nice, unique qualities."

"Brew Dogs would have me say, """Hello!""" to the beer as I bring it up to my nose for a sniff, but that is for landlubbers! Ahoy, me lovely, I said as I watched the dense, creamy two fingers of tawny head slowly fall into the surf. Color was a hazy orangish-amber (SRM = > 17, < 22). I am not a fan of filtration, so cloudy and hazy are okay by me in most beers. Nose had the usual suspects - cinnamon, clove and nutmeg, but not in overwhelming quantities. We may get along, lasses. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full, not quite creamy, but close. The flavor was semi-sweet with the maple syrup getting a fair shake, but not overtaking the spices, which was my fear before opening it. The potential for cloying sweetness existed, but the brewer held fast. Properly moored alongside in Siamese-fashion, I settled in as the wench proffered pancakes with butter and syrup and a hit off of her bottle of rum. Yo, ho ho! Warming, I began to sense a bit of alcohol heat, reminding me to be aware of its ABV. It finished with a warm semi-sweetness, very evocative of pumpkin pie. I kissed the mistress, requested permission to go ashore and headed off on my next (mis)adventure."

"Pours an amber caramel color with a finger of foamy head. Actually really nice head on this considering the abv. Huge sugary sweet aromas - maple, caramel, cinnamon, and toffee. taste is really nice. all the same flavors as the aroma with a hint of vanilla or bourbon maybe. Its just a tad too sweet. Its so easy to drink being nearly 10%abv which is dangerous - I find myself drinking this fast. Overall, nice pumpkin brew and worth a visit."

"It is pretty cool to see this beer at almost every bar I have visited, and that Saucony Creek is getting love from the local markets. Congrats Matt, Mike and the crew"

"O: I'm very surprised but this is fantastic, and one of the better pumpkin ales I've had in some time. Absolutely worth a try for the fall season."

"As I sit here and sip this beautifully crafted Ale, I gather my full opinion of what's going on inside my mouth and brain. Not only is """Maple""" in the title of this beer, but """maple""" definitely shows itself. There is a hint of something different, which would be the butternut squash, that adds just enough difference to separate this pumpkin beer from the next. Another piece of the recipe would be the pirate rum spices that mix so perfectly with the pumpkin and maple creating a beautiful brew. Well done, I will be waiting for fall next year."
""
"O - Its ok, something I'm glad I've tried, the maple is done right, its just too much, and the complexity is there too, but needs evened out."
"Overall very nice! It doesn't seem too sweet to me as other reviews suggest, totally solid and deceptively drinkable at 9.5%."
"I bought this on a whim for novelty value because it wasn't too expensive. I found it so good that it's one of the few pumpkin beers I liked so much, I'd buy again (not that I dislike pumpkin beers, but I've had so many that they hardly ever stand out)."
""
""
"O: Very tasty, although the pumpkin isn't very strong, certainly not next to other """pumpkin""" ales. If you set aside that expectation, you won't be disappointed."
""
""
""
""
""

"Other pumpkin ales I have tried and liked (but did not purchase in quantity) include UFO, Tommyknocker, Ichabod, and Southampton."

""

"This beer has a brownish color body with a small white head. The aroma is sweet of malple syrup. The taste has a subtle pumpkin flavor that is balanced with the maple syrup. I also taste a little spice. The mouthfeel is nice just a little thick and leaves a light after taste on the tongue."
""
""
""
""
"O: too sweet on the maple, I think if it were more subdued, it could be a really good beer. That said, it was more enjoyable than I anticipated."
""

"Not bad overall, a couple bottles every fall would be a good thing."

"D - A fabulous Pumpkin Beer that doesn't pull any punches and doesn't even attempt to hide it's potent 9.5% ABV punch... A delectable sipper to say the least... What a terrific offering the little known Saucony Creek Brewery... I will be sure to check out their other offering when provided the opportunity... If push came to shove in a blind taste test, I'm not sure I would peg this as a Pumpkin Ale, but rather an autumnal seasonal offering with some barleywine and old ale characteristics... Complex, assertive, and quite enjoyable..."
""
""
"Overall a really enjoyable fall offering from a local brewery! There was much more going on in this brew than I was expecting: rum-like flavors, not an overpowering sweetness or pumpkin flavors. Spices were well integrated and added a nice layer of flavors. If you can get this: DO IT!"

"Sweeter than expected, yet had a heavier alcoholey taste to it that showed every bit of its 9%+ ABV. Definitely an autumn beer that hits you in the middles (of the tongue, as opposed to the tip of the tongue or the back) and lingers there for quite awhile. Highly recommended for any pumpkin pie, cinnamon, nutmeg, caramel, or toffee aficionados. my only regret is that I drank it all before thinking to write a review."

"It is always great to buy local, but if you can find this beer, I recommend it."

"Overall I like this stuff a good bit. It's not a favorite but I'm a solid IPA guy. That being the case a few non IPA's have made my hits list and this one comes close to cutting the mustard but it's just a tad too sweet in the end for me. Along with a Nicaraguan cigar or some type of seasonal food this would do very well. Pumpkin or apple pie is very obvious. German sausages could be nice as well or something with anise as a base. Maybe traditional german pork and kraut like on new years."

"This beer is sweet and might benefit from a food pairing to lessen this. Otherwise, it is extremely smooth and easy to drink. Quite enjoyable."
"I'm at odds. I kind of like the blend and flavor but it finishes on the cloyingly sweet side with a syrupy smack that leaves you with a sugar high halfway through. I'd hate to say it but I'd like it a bit drier. A 12 ounce bottle is too much for one person to handle. Split it with a friend when it gets folder out in the Fall and maybe the warming sweetness will fair better."
"Hides the alcohol well. It's okay."

"I am not a huge fan of Pumpkin styles but I really enjoyed this new bottle from Saucony Creek. The bartender at the Fleetwood Grille also rimmed our glasses with a cinnamon brown sugar mix which enhanced the experience. You could definitely taste the butternut squash and the maple finish."
