"Overall:  Delicious beer!  Tons of pumpkin pie flavors, but not too sweet.  I’ll certainly get it again next fall."
"O - This beer is really up and down.  Great look, weak aromas, easy drinking taste, but average comlexity, good body.....seems like a mild IPA.  If the label didn't have a pumpkin on it, I wouldn't know the difference."
""
"O - The bitterness is high and the pumpkin is low.  Not exactly what I expected from a pumpkin ale."
"I have been drinking Cisco's beers since they started, but I had yet to try their pumpkin ale.  On the pour everything looked great: rich amber color, really nice head, off-white in color, with fine lacing.  The pumpkin aroma was very slight, and so, alas, was the taste, which was mostly a hoppy bitterness.  I could only make out a little pumpkin flavor, and no spices whatsoever, as the bitterness overwhelmed.  If you want your pumpkin ale to taste more like a pale ale, this is for you. But if I get a pumpkin ale I want to taste the pumpkin, and this beer didn't hold it's own in that regard."

"Overall: Decent autumn beer. I like that it's spiced up front. I had this with some squash tacos and it was a nice autumnal pairing. Not my favorite pumpkin ale - that's still Smuttynose, as of now - but not half bad."
""
""
"O:  Some guy at Hop City in Atlanta convinced me to buy this one.  He thought it was the shit in pumpkin beers.  Wrong!  A real waste of sip and  money.  Pass on this boring offering."

"Noticing the Julian dating after purchase, I realized Pumple Drumkin was canned mid July, 3+ months before consumption. I'm wondering if there is a hop presence that may have been more noticeable closer to the canning date. Next season I'll seek this one out closer to the canning date to see if the hops are more of a factor. Easy drinking Pumpkin Ale, worth a shot."

"Light, almost watery, to me the beer tasted like your average pale ale with grainy hops and minimal sweetness but then had some pumpkin notes added it (and the pumpkin is minimal at best)."
""
""
"I can only hypothesize that the 90-pt rating from """the bros""" is because if I was sitting with a bunch of pumpkin beers, and had taste fatigue, I might find a plain old IPA to be a refreshing change.  But when I come in from work for my one beer (not one of a tasting panel), this one sorely disappointed me."

"I rarely - if ever say this about beer. I've been drinking craft beer whenever i can find it and found this at a grocery store near me that sells mixed 6 packs where you can choose them. This was the last one I picked out since I hadn't had it before. It was in a can, not a bottle - so maybe this contributed to the flavor of the beer - or got a bad banch of it. When i first smelled it - it smelled like it had skunked or been sour, but tasted it and it tasted just plain horrible. The pumpkin spice that its advertised as being a """pumpkin beer""" was missing, and tasted very, very watered down. This was the second time I've ever poured out a beer - after my horrible experience with a 3 year old can of Narragansett Bock...it tasted almost just like that. Perhaps it wasn't fresh - or in a can like I said (I've had Cisco's Whale Tale, and Grey Lady and they're alright) but I will have to follow this up sometime in another form. I do not recommend!"

"Worst beer I ever had last year.  Dumped the rest but one down the drain to save some other soul from having to endure the taste.  Tried the one I saved again just too be sure and it hit the drain too.  Too scared of loosing my beer palate to attempt buying it this year.....  Yuck.."
"Pours a clear orange color with a head that dies quickly.  The aroma is fu of pumpkin pie spices.  The taste has a fair bitterness along with spices and a but if vegetal pumpkin.  Hoppy pumpkin ale, interesting.  Still, had the spice and pumpkin notes.  Easy to drink, not a bad ale."
""
""
"Not... not bad.  But a strange flavor, the beginning dully sweet and the end sharply bitter.  Just doesn't hit my pallet quite right."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Good pumpkin beer that complements slight pumpkin and spice well, as well as keeps the integrety of a beer flavor ( not overkill on the cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, etc). Medium mouth feel with more pumpkin aromas than taste. Good session pumpkin beer overall and would recommed  for those who dont want too much spice in their pumpkin seasonals."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Despite its medium-bodied upstart dissolves quite effortlessly in its finish, a spicy, heated and drying tactile sensation follows to offer a moderate sense of drinkability and sociability to the session. Its dry starchiness is laden with skeletons of spice and sweetness that aridly reminds the palate and memory of pumpkin pie."
""
""
""
""
"[Mouthfeel: 4.0] This beer has a creamy, smooth flow but is strongly crisp at the same time in its medium body.  There's a lingering bitterness in the finish."

"O- a different take on the typical pumpkin ale, the increased hop bitterness played well with the pumpkin spices"
""
""
""

"Draught: This one pours an orangish-gold color. It has a bit of a white head on it. Not much lacing. The aroma is OK. Some pumpkin spices, hint of malt. Not much else. The taste is very similar. Some pumpkin spices, a bit of malts. Rates a """Meh""" at best."
""
""
""
"Overall: This beer is not good. To be honest it has the harsh and metallic flavors that I associate with old-style homebrew (before we really understood the need for fresh ingredients and sanitation...) Sj and I had to pour this out after a couple sips. Not a great start from this brewery, but I'd still try another of their beers before boycotting them."

"Did anyone else see today's """Brevity""" comic strip in which Linus goes into shock upon hearing a young woman exiting Starbucks say, """This is a Great Pumpkin Latte!""" Ha!"
"This was fairly drinkable the other night after my tastebuds were fried, for what that's worth"
""
""
""
""
""
"I had to pour most of it down the drain. I don't know if this was a bad batch or if this was what Pumple Drumkin is supposed to be, but it was not an experience I'd want anyone to have to repeat."
"O- It’s drinkable, Really looks good but I would have to admit the flavor profile on this is off. The metallic finish doesn’t do it justice."

"An okay pumpkin ale even though it's not as rich or as thick other ales."

"Pours a two finger cream head that fades quickly leaving some lace. Clear amber color. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied. Spicy pumpkin nose and flavor has only hints of pumpkin with more pepper and hops. $2.70 for a 12oz bottle from Julio's Liquors Marlboro, MA."
""
""
""
"O: Not a bad beer, but not a good representative of the already under-siege pumpkin style. Don't know what happened with this beer, but you can do better."
" The flavor is good actually it impresses me with more flavor than the aroma lets on with some gentle woodiness of ginger with a light nutmeg like aspect and perhaps some clove adding to the taste of slight fruitiness from the yeast. The malt takes a back seat but still supports the rest of the flavor profile adding some sweetness to the spice and yeast which is pretty seamless. Overall I recommend this to fans of the style since I enjoyed how balanced it was, I like the fact that you get the spice without it overwhelming the taste...it compliments in every way."
"Loving the canned beer revolution, this one pours a copper bronze hue bright filtered large khaki tan head, forms thick and textured foam. Fine speckled lacing left behind is layered nicely in even patterns. Aroma is packed with pumpkin pie spices including nutmeg, cinnamon, all spice, and hints of clove. Gourdy goodness with some actual vegetal pumpkin aromatics here. Refreshing quaffable pumpkin ale, not overly spiced but there's a great base beer underneath the pumpkin pie spice. It finishes rather clean the spices don't linger, thank God. Solid effort outta Nantucket, such solid beer made in a can I'm ready for more of this caliber of brewing offered in cans."

"bitter flat non carbonated pumpkin tasting ale, the appearance is the best part of this ale. This is my first time drinking it and to me doesn't taste anything like pumpkin. The label I think is the best part of the beer the little pumpkin dude is the cutest little thing."
""
"O: Good taste and aroma, not so certain about the feel. I've had 'pumpkin ales' that transcend this in spicing and aroma; this is 'good' at best."
"Overall a fair pumpkin beer. I like pumpkin beers that are either interesting beers with light spicing or complex, spiced beers with good balance. This is neither--it's a decent beer, but nothing stands out about it. The spicing is so much in the background, so it doesn't stand out as a pumpkin beer either."
"So glad the Fall season has returned, cheers!!"
"Like the aroma the taste is just rather bland. Some malts can be found but little sweetness. A short-lived low bitterness at the end. It has a cardboard-like character I'm sorry to say. I always look for the positives in every beer I review but this was quite frankly a very weak pumpkin brew. Maybe I had a bad bottle."

"A nice-looking beer - golden and orange highlights, white head, very good lacing throughout the entire session. Not much doing on the nose. Nothing offensive, to be sure, but nothing overly special: some coriander, very faint pumpkin, orange peel. The taste is much more intense. For me and my preferences, this is a good tasting pumpkin spiced ale in that there's a heavier emphasis on the spice flavors and not on the pumpkin. So it's not like you're quaffing some beer out of a hollowed-out orange squash, but rather the spices and other ingredients used remind me of autumn: mulling spices, fresh ginger-snap cookies made with molasses, cinnamon sticks, nutmeg, allspice, corn, candied citrus. A lighter-bodies beer, and for me a bit too much carbonation."
""
"Perhaps if it was not labeled a pumpkin beer I would have liked it more, but given the expectations it was definitely a let down. One caveat is that I switched off drinking tastes of this with another brand's pumpkin beer version. The other brands pumpkin beer had much more pumpkin and spice taste which only served to accentuate such absence in the Pumple Drumkin."
"This is an awesome pumpkin beer. Appearance is a bit darker than most and the pumpkin flavor is very understated, which I prefer to the pumpkin-pie-in-your-face varieties. After a few sips I almost forgot I was drinking a pumpkin ale, it tastes more like a pale ale with a nice hop character and dry finish. But as the hops fade a lingering pumpkin aftertaste surfaces until the next sip. First time I've had this brew but it's quickly become one of my favorites."
""
""
""
""

"Pleasant mild aroma of roasted pumpkin with caramel notes. Taste is mild pumpkin with weak spice that fades into a predominant floral, grapefruit, grassy bitter finish. I felt like I was drinking a pumpkin IPA if there is such a thing. I cannot speak for all pumpkin beer lovers, but when I think of pumpkin beer, I am thinking of the flavor of pumpkin pie which is not bitter."

"O. As far as pumpkin's go, this has a good taste but a bit mild. So if you don't want an over the top pumpkin/cinnamon taste, this is a good start."
"Overall not like I remembered this from last year. Not well-balanced. The flavors don't mesh well together. No sweetness. A real letdown"
""
""
""
""
""
"I don't even know how to respond to the story on the side of the can... Regardless, this stuff pours a clear auburn topped by a finger of cream foam. The nose comprises caramel, light graham cracker, brown sugar, clove, a pinch of cinnamon, and toast. The taste brings in more of the same, with a stronger toast component, this time almost seeming like toasted pumpkin seeds. For once, the spicing in a pumpkin ale is present but restrained, a welcome change, even for a sweet-toothed spice-hound like myself. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation, a slick feel, and a sorta/kinda drying finish. Overall, a solid enough pumpkin ale, one that tones down the spices compared to others while maintaining a healthy balance with the underlying malts."

"T: Oh my sweet lord. What the hell is this??? Tastes like someone dragged a pill of aspirin through a litter box. Bitter with a truly horrible chalky yeast meets pet dander flavor. Leaves a gross, rotten vegetable flavor on the tongue that I don't forsee going away for at least the remainder of tonight. What a mistake. Stay away my friends, stay far, far away!"

"Medium bodies with a strong zesty spicy presence up front that lingers over the sweet pumpkin notes into a dry finish.  Slightly more vegetal than expected but still sweet with prominent autumnal spice.  Not as dessert like with lots of clove, pepper and allspice followed by pumpkin purée, nutmeg and bready malt.  ABV is well masked with no alcoholic heat making it decently drinkable.  Could be a touch sweeter but it's not a bad interpretation of the style."
"Cisco Pumple Drumkin ---3/5."

"Thin head on a bright clear copper body. Aromas of caramel malts, hint of brown sugar and little in the way of pumpkin really.flavor is boring even for the style opening with caramel and toasted malts with brown sugar moving to a more fresh pumpkin over a spiced or pumpkin pie sweetness. Medium body and moderate carbonation. Overall even for the style, this one is boring and under flavored."
""
""
""
"Reviewed from notes"
"Looks like a dark maerzen... great looking color beer, head is a bit bubbly... lots of carbonation... aromas are slight pumpkin spice hintes that this wont be killed and over done with spices.... good... flavor is sublte as well... amber ale base with flavors of raw pumkin and spices on the back. Not an over done spiced pumpkin... which i like, but the beer lacks complexity. Decent and i dont mind drinking because it not ruined with marketing spices."
"I'm not really impressed with this pumpkin ale. The spice blend is all wrong, and it's really not sweet enough."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"(O)- Overall, its decent for the style, but clearly lacking any big pumpkin flavor; plenty of spice though."
""
""
"had at the Cloverleaf in Caldwell NJ. nice looking amber brew, a tiny bit of head. nose was spicy, some slight citrus present. taste was a little lacking in pumpkin, but otherwise a nice ale. good mouthfeel, velvety. overall, one of the better pumpkin beers I have consumed. Wish I could have quaffed more..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I poured this one into a pint glass, it has a clear copper color body with a small fizzy head that lays down quiet quickly. The smell has a spicey hoppy smell to it. The taste has a spicy hop flavor to it with some pumpkin spices coming through on the middle of the tongue. I get a slight pumpkin flavor but more malt on the back of the tonuge. The mouth feel is good smooth, a little more heavier than other pumpkins but good. Overall this is good but needs less spice and hops and more pumpkin."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not my favorite pumpkin by a long shot, but this is growing on me a bit as I drink through the sixer. Pours a dark amber with a head that sticks around as a thin cap. The smell and taste is quite gingery- and lacks a lot of the other pumpkin pie spices, and is also quite a bit thinner than I'd like. There is a chalkiness to the brew as well, as though raw spices were just dumped in. Completely lacks the silkiness of the pumpkin- either it wasn't used or not enough was, or perhaps the raw spices just overwhelm it. The spices leave a bit of a bitter taste in the mouth, but the ginger note is pretty tasty nevertheless. Needs more balance, or at least more integration."
""
""
"Beer is medium to medium-light bodied with medium to medium-low level carbonation. The resulting mouthfeel is a fairly smooth, somewhat creamy and foamy beer, but it is also disappointingly watery as the glass wears on. Finish is semi-dry."
""
""
""
""
"Malty aroma has a yeasty overtone and a hint of spice. Pours a clear, dark, bubbly amber with a thick pale wheat head. Malty flavor has a hint of pumpkin and more than a hint of hoppy bitterness. Smooth texture has about average body and not a whole lot of fizz. If not the best pumpkin ale, worthy of at least a try."
""
"O- greatly disappointed in this one. It just doesn't work."
""
"Pours dark amber with a fluffy off-white head that settles to a 1-inch cap. Moderate aromas of pumpkin, nutmeg, cinnamon, and roasted nuts. Fairly middle-of-the-road, but pretty nice. Hovers around the spice end of the """Pumpkin Spice""" spectrum, with more cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice. Nice and drinkable, like every other Cisco brew I've had. Mouthfeel is smooth and clean, with a medium body and ample carbonation. Nice, drinkable Pumpkin Beer that doesn't try to re-invent the wheel."
""
""
"One of the better pumpkin ales that I have sampled this season."
"Pours a light burnt orange color, active and bubbly white head. Scent leads with some notes of seasonal spice, lighter on the cinnamon and nutmeg, some floral and lemony hoppyness, biscuity sweetness and light green apple - where is my pumpkin? Not in the flavor either. Odd combination of light spicing, floral notes and lemon and green apple. Lighter side of medium, spritzy. Was wondering if this was another Shipyard with no actual pumpkin used."
""
""
"Pours an amber maple syrup brown color with thin lacing. Usual smell and flavor of nutmeg, cinnamon, and sweet malts. Its a good mellow pumpkin ale, not overly spicy but nice flavors. Good not amazing."
""
""
""
"Taste is alright, fairly mild and easy drinking. Seems a little watery and flimsy after sitting with it for a bit. Lacks much pumpkin character, though some mild spice does linger (nutmeg, cinnamon, etc.). Plain and not over the top. Could do worse, though this beer isn't offering much in the originality department."
""
"Overall: Very enjoyable brew. certainly one of the better pumpkins ales."
""
"o - Overall a pretty good pumpkin beer. A decent amount of spice and pepper to it, but easy to drink. Would have it again, though I drank it side by side with the Greenport Harbor Leaf Pile Pumpkin ale and preferred that one a little more."
"O-Not for the untrained palate, as the notes are practically unnoticeable, but a decent ale for the time of the year."
""
""
""
"This beer poured out as a brownish orange color with a white head on top. The dead settles not leaving much behind on the glass. The smell of the beer is moderately spiced with a subtle malt profile to it. The taste of the beer has a decent amount of spices in there too, there is a decent malt base to this beer also. The mouthfeel is a little sharp on the carbonation, there is a bit of warming sensation going on too from the spices. Overall this beer is pretty good, not something I'd look forward too having each year but it was nice to try."
""
"O: Certainly, this beer could have been better. It seems to be one of those brews that was half formed."
""
""
""
""
"O: The best aspect of this beer is that while you have the flavors and pumpkin and traditional pumpkin pie spices but not added sweetness. This is a decent pumpkin beer and has none of the artificial flavors that you often get in this style."
""
"Overall this is an above average pumpkin ale, my wife says this is a pumpkin she could actually drink and she does not like pumpkin ales at all. Wasn't quite up my alley so draw your own conclusions there."
""
""
"O- Started out promising and ended up just decent. Glad I tried it but much better options out there"
"Toasted malts up front. Singed caramel and pulpy gourd maltiness fills in. Again, as in the nose, there is a zesty citrus element livening up the palate. Peppery, floral, herbal hop bitterness in the latter half as well. Requisite pumpkin beer spices show up too, but they are not too brash and fit in nicely. Medium body with a lively feel. One of the better pumpkin beers so far this season."
"o - this is what a pumpkin beer should be. i'm not a fan of ones that dominate with spices and don't let pumpkin flavor and aroma come through. this is very balanced and drinkable."
"D - Yikes, the aroma is about what one would expect, but the flavor profile is really bland and the extra dry finish doesn't help things. Very little identifiable spice character, though there is some hotdog water like character in the background. I'm really unimpressed with this..."
""
""
""
""
"The pumpkin flavors in the first sip seem muted and garbled. The malt is the strongest and most consistent taste coming off the blocks. I'm going to let it warm for a few minutes and see if that improves matters. The quick break also seems to embolden the hop flavors, which control the finish and aftertaste. Mouthfeel could use a little more stiffness. Not a bad little pumpkin, but a little disappointing after the great first impression."
"Pumpkin ales walk a fine line between too spicy and not spicy enough. This is the latter."
""
"This beer was a fantastic full bodied pumpkin flavored and spiced beer. The flavors are not too overwhelming, but compliment the beer in a fantastic way. Cisco Brewery makes a great select of beers include Grey Lady and Whale's Tale Pale Ale. I wish Cisco Brewery made kegs."
"O: I will not be drinking this again."
""
""
"O: A fairly mediocre pumpkin ale overall. It smells nice, but the taste is rather bland and odd."
"O: This is an enjoyable pumpkin beer if you want some flavors of spices and pumpkins and something that doesn’t seem sweet and artificial."

"I have to admit I"""am not big on drinking pumpkin ales when it's 90 degrees still outside but I bought the first one of the year today.Poured into a nonic a clear deep burnt orange with a 1/2 finger white head that left no lace as it settled pretty quickly.This is a spiced ale no doubt with aromas of cardamom and clove dominating,a little sweet alcohol and cinnamon sharpness comes into play but is on the lighter side.Flavors are as well spiced with cardamom being the major player,there is a bit of drying in the finish.Well the label says a pumpkin spiced ale and that is what it is no doubt,spiced but not overly sweet so not bad."
""
"O: Impressed with this one, kind of like a mix of smuttynose and Pumking. Its not overly spiced, pumkin flavor shines through, but theres definitely some pie sweetness going on. One of the better pumpkin beers out there."

"Poured into a pint glass, a partly hazy burnished copper sits under a thin head. Toasted biscuity malt aroma with notes of sweet pumpkin and herbal spice. A solid sessionable pumpkin ale with a gentle carbonation and pleasantly spiced pumpkin flavor that is neither too much or too little for what I'd refer to as an """honest""" pumpkin taste. Finish is an almost dessert bready dry pumpkin one. I feel like this could pair just as nicely with a slice of Thanksgiving turkey as it could with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Looking forward to the 2012 batch..."
""
"O: Odd pumpkin ale. I can't tell if the bad burnt flavor is an """off""" flavor or just a bad implementation. Could just be a bad bottle but doesn't taste like any infection I've ever experienced. Maybe will have to retry someday."

"Poured from a bomber into a true pint, the beer is a vibrant, bright, clear copper-orange coloring with a dense, small bubbled, yellow-biege colored head that clings all over the glass. Aromas are a light blend of pumpkin and nutmeg spicing, with a roasty hint to it, as well. Flavors are light at first, with a good pumpkin base and light cinnamon, nutmeg, and clove spicing. As the beer moves towards the back of the tongue the spice notes get heavier, and the beer has a light, smooth body that starts creamy and then finishes crisply due to the spicing. The aftertaste is roasted and sweet pumpkin, with a slick, clean finish. The spice flavors linger on a bit, but not overpowering. Tasty brew."
"Overall: A nice and solid pumpkin ale that is a bit more bitter than I am used to. Not my favorite, but a nice change of pace in a pumpkin tasting—so I will probably get this once a year for just that purpose. I could have a couple."

"Light to medium in body, with good carbonation. Not the best pumpkin ale ever, but still drinkable and worth a try."
"Overall - The flavor is somewhat bland, but what's there is good. The finish is off-putting, but it's a decent beer I had no trouble finishing."
"Poured a clear, pumpkin orange color, with a thin white head. Aroma of pumpkin pulp and spices. Taste of light pumpkin pie, nutmeg and cloves, grains and hay, and a mild hoppiness that comes in for a drying finish. Not bad, but a little on the bland side. I like pumpkin ales that are big and in your face with flavor, as opposed to soft and subtle, which describes this one better. Light body, and despite lacking a bit in the flavor department, still quite drinkable."
"Body-Medium heaviness, very little effervescence, the lack of effervescence makes it close to syrupy even though not incredibly heavy. For some reason, this is the third beer in a row by these guys I haven’t liked. I can’t seem to figure out why but this is definitely the best of the three so far. If you want a beer that balances light hops, malt and the pumpkin and spice flavors without being very sweet, yet quite subtle, this is probably something you should try."
"Thanks, Bendurgin, for the opportunity"
"This was quite good and one of the better pumpkin beers that I’ve had this fall. I really like the lively and fresh mix of pumpkin and spice here and this had just enough of a well balanced hop presence to keep this crisp and easy drinking in the mouth. I should have grabbed a sixer of this one."
"Overall it's was a pretty obscure find and its overall pretty smooth but not worth the price of $3.50 a bottle."
"O - A decent pumpkin ale, the sweetness to bitterness is the perfect combination. However, a heavier flavor would improve it immensely. Still, I would certainly recommend at least trying a bottle."
"If only there was a touch more sweetness, Pumple Drumkin would live up to the righteousness of its name. Solid and drinkable, but not too exciting."
"O - A good and very natural tasting pumpkin ale. This will be a welcomed addition to my refrigerator each Fall."
"O- Very easy to drink. Decent pumpkin ale. Better than most that I have tried."
"Overall, this beer took me by surprise. It totally impressed me. I will drink it again."
"Overall Impression- Thanks for the try Larry! Not sure its in my top 5 of Pumpkin brews (except for the aroma). Too light bodied and not enough pumpkin flavor. There even could have been more spice included. I never would have been able to enjoy if I didn't trade for this. If you can, go for it! Its still very good for the style!"
"Very nice spiced pumpkin ale."
"I've been trying as many pumpkin ales as I can this year, this one falls a bit short for me. Doesn't come across as a fresh pumpkin beer, and is maybe just a bit too subdued in flavor. By no means a bad beer, but falls in the middle of the pack for me."
"Overall - This is a new favorite for me and a new standard for Pumpkin Ales. I wasn't sure what to expect but Cisco has surpassed what a pumpkin ale means. This is a solid autumn offering. I will need to stock up before it's all gone."
"Very tasty pumpkin ale. Nicely done."
"Overall i'm real happy with this one. Certainly one of the better fall selections i've bought recently and its just an easily drinkable and tasty beer. A must try to pumpkin or spiced beer lovers."
"This is an easy drinking beer that's not overly spiced like other pumpkin beers. Quite tasty, but it has a 'musty' flavor from the pumpkin."
"O: Good, easy drinking pumpkin beer. Just another reason to love fall, these beers are back and better than ever!"
"Spice flavor is big eventually but it tastes very fresh and isn't burning cinnamon, I have to give thm credit for this. A nice pumpkin ale overall."
"O: A nice, pure, pumpkin-flavored ale with ample spices added in. Not the greatest malt body on this ale, but its still very drinkable. The aroma and initial taste are the finest qualities, but the real pumpkin flavor is undeniable. A nice choice in the sea of fall seasonals."
"Overall, not bad. Not the best, and a far cry from the worst pumpkin beer out there (and there are a few). The beer is built to be sipped, and the unique flavor is built into the finish. Some will bitch that this is not enough. It pretty much works, though. This is not a brew where the additional spice et al will stand up to food. You'll get the malt, but the rest will disappear. Worth a try as a change in the autumn beer menu."
"Overall a highlight of the category with very nice flavors and aromas."
"O: Not very impressed. Light spicing which some may say is a plus as i have heard some people complain of overspicing, but I didn't think this was a good brown ale even. Not enough hopping, not enough flavor. Pumpkin ales in my opinion should add more flavor complexity to what is already a good brown ale. This one just didn't seem to be on that level. Not a good brown ale, not a good pumpkin ale."
"Overall: A real let down of a beer. Doesn't work as a pumpkin beer, but doesn't seem to want to be anything else either. I like my pumpkin beers subtly spiced, but """subtle""" would be a real euphemism for this beer."
"While I prefer the big, sweet imperial type pumpkin ales like Weyerbacher and Schlafly, this is a very sessionable brew for the cooler months."
"Overall, I'm glad I picked this up as a single. I enjoyed drinking it but won't be seeking it out again in the future. Definitely could use a little boldness and some more body. Worth a taste if your curious."
"SWould try this again."
"O-This a solid pumpkin brew. Decent balance of flavors and easy to drink."
"O: A good pumpkin offering, though not my favorite this year. I found the finish to clash slightly with the rest of the beer."
"Coppery apricot colored with a sizzly white head that settles out slowly. Aroma of pumpkin and squashy vegetal notes, plus understated spice. Flavors of pumpkin and squash upfront, some bready malt, followed by subtle spices, thankfully easy on the nutmeg. Punctuated with a spicy and herbal bitter finish, a bit peppery, and a decidedly unpleasant acrid note that lingers and detracts from the whole. Moderate carbonation, even mouthfeel, a bit average overall for me mainly because of the lingering acridness."
"O- Overall, this is a solid pumpkin. What sets it apart from many pumpkin beers is that it is a little hoppier than most. Recommended."
"O: I guess this is for the folks out there who want a milder pumpkin beer. I like mine spiced and sweet. Decent, but I only have a few pumpkin ales each year and I'd rather go for something with a heavier flavor."
"The body is medium and the carbonation is where it should be. Overall this is one of the better pumpkin beers I've had. I really like the simplicity of the flavors. I like the straight up no nonsense pumpkin."
"On word... Worthy!! yeah it's not over the top and i do like over the top.. i loved the ST pumking a few years ago when it was like pumpkin pie in a glass.. this is not that... but it's pretty damn good.. I give it pretty good grades and am glad to drink it.. I would recommend getting this brew..."
"Pours a hazy caramel color with a thin off-white head without much retention of lacing. The nose brings a bit of caramel and actual pumpkin, though not too much on the spice front, which was nice. The flavor had some nice pumpkin puree character without the heavy spicing behind many in this style. Slightly chewy with a medium body. Pretty good."
" Overall it's an awesome pumpkin ale. It's not like the ones that try to taste like pumpkin pies. While I appreciate both styles, this is one of my favorite of the spicier style."
"O - An excellent pumpkin ale. Jumps into my top 5, possibly top 3."
"O - An average pumpkin beer, not too sweet and not too spicy. Nothing to write home about so depending on the price there might be better options out there."
"This was an interesting beer. Did not have a big pumpkin pie spice that some of them do but it was well made. Will be revisiting this one again."
"O/D-An individual. Too pricey at about $12 for a six pack. If you are into the style, it is worth a try. I don't love it but its cool. Also has a bit of a metallic flavor which is unfortunate. The price, combined with the mild flavor and the metal makes this a slightly below-average Pump in my book."
"Smooth not very pumpliny bt not a big fan of the over the top pumpkins like s tier"
"Not bad but it could have been so much more. This is a tough style that doesn't always offer enough room for innovation. Pumple Drumkin is still drinkable though."
"i'm really glad Cisco made this in six packs. a single 22oz bomber wasn't enough for me last year. well balanced and drinkable. this is probably in my top 5 favorite pumpkin ales. recommended."
"Worth trying if that is what you are looking for."
"Overall it's good. Better than a lot of other pumpkin i've tried."
"Made a trip to where this gets brewed today and grabbed a bottle straight off the line. Clear and a burnt copper color. Small amount of head but left a thin lacing. Spicy nose with a lot of nutmeg shining through more than anything else. Flavor is toasty malts and the nutmeg and cinnamon. Close to a pumpkin pie. It has that sweet bread but is also spiced evenly. Nutmeg is again the dominate spice but everything is balanced like a good pie. Finishes without cloying at first but towards the end of the glass I'm starting to think I'm down with just the one bottle. Good beer but only for that one glass. Not a beer I'm going to drink a sixer of at a autumn bonfire."
"This beer should get some special recognition since it is labeled as a """spiced ale""" but isn't a grotesque spice bomb. It's nicely balanced and flavorful. It's not my favorite, but I will probably be buying it again."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a nice dark peach with a 1 finger off white head. Head lasted a few minutes before leaving a thin layer that clung to the sides nicely. Aroma was slightly sweet, with definite pumpkin aromas and hints of spice. Taste was smooth and fruity. It finished off with a peppery spiciness in the mouth. Occasional hops bitterness showed through. Very well balanced and nicely seasoned. Felt decent in the mouth, coated well and nicely carbonated. Slight overcarbonation occasionally lingered in the back of the mouth, but not enough to detract. Very good to drink, could go either as sipper or as a drinker."
"Cisco hit all the right marks, balanced with a heavy hand of complex flavors. Big and bold, a wedge of aged Gouda would do very well here."
"This one is drinkable, but becomes less so because of the flavor profile."
"This is a very good pumpkin beer and one of the best ones I've had this season. Highly recommended."
"Drinkability: Pretty sessionable."
"I'm going to be honest, I quite like this beer. While not a fair representation of a pumpkin ale by any stretch, on its own, this beer is quite enjoyable. As a side note, I'd also like to express my love for the label's flighty, child-like illustration."
"D: A little thin, not enough pumpkin. A decent beer but not one I'd buy again"
"Not a great example of the style, but not harse to drink."
"D - Eh, I'd buy this over Shipyard, but thats about it."
"Clear coppery body with a modest collar of whitish bubbles. Spicy aroma, pie spices, lots of nutmeg and cinnamon, notes of allspice and ginger. Same in the flavour, but with a bit of malt sweetness to balance things out. Mild bitterness in the finish too. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation, slightly slick texture. A decent pumpkin ale and one that I'd purchase again, but not one of my favs since the spices drown out the gourd."
"D: It is okay, have had worse. Will not buy again, can't quite recommend, Cisco has better offerings."
"Another somewhat early seasonal opportunity on tap at the brewery in Nantucket this week, this tasty brew shows a muddy dark chestnut brown with plenty of light tan head that fades to a wispy topping with lots of lacing. The aroma is a bitter swamp thing with vegetable malt and herbal hop evident. Very edible and intriguing. The flavor sticks to that theme which I love. Pumpkin is present but it's not precisely the dominant idea here. There's a malted milk and cinnamon flavor that mixes perfectly with the subtle pumpkin and finishes with the dry hoppy goodness of the advertised Nelson hops. Alcohol is not really notable but it upholds an ale idea and offers a beautifully mellow and dry, resinous, yet somewhat creamy feel. I get all sorts of vegetable hints with sweet malt blending in tastefully. It's medium bodied and unusually well carbonated for a cask. Drinkable enough by my tastes. What a great surprise at the Cisco Brewery."
"D- Moderate. I like this beer, I'll def. buy some more."
"A nice dark amber orange, very small white head. Aroma, is slight, a little malt and nutmeg. First sip is a little bitter, flavors of malt, nutmeg, a little pumpkin. Not sure where the bitter comes from. As it warms the bitter fades and the beer mellows becomes more malty with some more spice overtones. Not a bad Pumpkin ale, but nothing spectactular."
"M/D: Medium bodied, carbonation is about medium, very nice mouthfeel. Drinkability is nice. Not an over the top or in your face beer, but nice and balanced from start to finish."
"I love spice cake and the like so this is enjoyable but could get cloying"
"D,notes: Good drinkability. Simple straightforward. Not cloying, which I tend to find to be a problem with pumpkin ales. I would have liked a little more pronounced flavor however."
"D: Just okay, not one of my favorite pumpkin beers."
"D: Tasty, goes down ok, slightly filling, decent kick, good representation of style, it's a pretty solid beer within its style, but overall I found it to just be mediocre."
"Excellent, I want more!"
"Drinkability - Very drinkable, and a very good beer. If my wallet agreed I would have many more."
"Final thoughts: A very nice tasty pumpkin ale, that has a slight sweet taste with toasty pumpkin, a little bready, pumpkin pie with crust taste, light on the spices, big on the refreshment, and a head scratching but inner smiling bitter earthy hop finish. It's only real downfall is the sheer lack of carbonation. However, I'll have to buy one (as I was planning to do anyways) and verify it has carbonation and I'll add on to this review. Thanks a lot for the beer, this one's for Cisco being such an awesome company and making great beers."
"In short, I'd describe this as a beer lovers Pumpkin Spiced Ale. It is far easier to enjoy than the """pie""" beers. I think it's my favorite of this style."
"I've had this on tap at the brewery and now in the bottle. I think on tap is a bit better in that the nuances of the spices emerge better. The beer has more of a foamy head, a foamed up mouthfeel, and a bit more lacing in the bottle version. The nose is surprisingly light on the pumpkin aromas, heavier on the malty caramels. There are more drying leafy hop notes in the bottle version as well. I'm knocking down the bottle version just a bit. It's a nice pumpkin ale, but it just doesn't have the full palate or the character of the on tap version."
"This beer pours a clear dark amber color. About a finger and a half of an off white pillowy head. Head retention is good with a good amount of lacing left behind. There is a wonderfully strong, inviting nose to this beer. Most easily picked out is cinnamon and nutmeg. Taste is fantastic! The cinnamon and nutmeg once again dominate the flavor but here is where the pumpkin comes in. Pumpkin flavoring mellows out the spices to give this beer a nice blend of flavor bursts with a mellow finish. Decent carbonation and a smooth feel make this beer once that I could sit with all night."
"D: quite tasty and one to have a couple"
"Thanks so much to corey0212 for hooking me up with this one!"
"Overall not bad. This was one of the lighter in body pumpkin ales I had this fall, but still very good. Nice and session able, and went well with dinner. I don't think I would turn this one down anytime soon."
"D-One and done is my usual with pumpkin beers, But I would certainly enjoy more than one of these. Very nice."
"D- This is really good pumpkin ale. Has to be up in my top 3 with ST and Weyerbacher. I like my pumpkin ales on the spicy side. It was a great opportunity to try this!"
"A very flavorful, yet drinkable spiced beer. I would definitely put it near the top of the list for the Pumpkin-related beers that I have tried."
"Pours a nice auburn color, darker than most pumpkin ales I've had. Big foamy tan head, settling very slowly into a nice layer atop the beer, lots of sticky lacing in the glass. Lots of pumpkin pie spice in the nose, doughy, and some full-on meaty pumpkin flesh aroma. This is the goods! Lots of nutmeg and spice flavors, pumpkin pie (crust included!), and actually more robust and bitter than overly-sweet. Delicious! Mouthfeel seems spot-on for the style, on the heavier end of medium-bodied, lingering spice and bitterness. I must have more!!!! Likely the finest pumpkin ale I've ever had."
"Overall a very good pumpkin ale. Seems that there really was an emphasis on actual pumpkin flavor here. I only wish I had more."
