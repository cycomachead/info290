"This pours a golden amber color with a slight bit of carbonation. The aroma is rich with pumpkin and spices. The flavor has lots pumpkin too it and not as much spices as the aroma would lead you to believe. The flavor is decently boozy and sweet. There are a few spices that linger in the after taste. Interesting and not like many other pumpkin beers on the market."
""
"Most definitely a one-bottle endeavor or something to be shared with friends as it's very rich, very heavy and yet rather irresistible (especially if fall or harvest type of ales are your thing)."

"O- This one seemed a bit unbalanced and drank more like a spiced cider than a pumpkin ale.  Middle of the pack, in terms of pumpkin ales"

"A pumpkin ale that’s actually tasty, definitely an exception to the usual.  This is not so spiced that gagging is required, nor is there so much pumpkin that you hesitate to swallow.  In fact, I can’t taste any pumpkin at all, just nutmeg.  That’s a good thing."

"Eh...it ain't Pumking or Williamsburg Alewerks Pumpkin.  Quite a few I would rate better.  Definitely has a strong pumpkin taste but the after taste of coffee, like a stout, is odd.  Like a stale pumpkin pie.  Not crisp or smooth.  Just a decent pumpkin ale.  Sort of like that prom date you were stoked to get and then decided she isn't all that.  Like driving an 80s Mustang GT.  Noise without performance.  750ml bottle."

"On the sweeter side, slightly cloying, but a very good beer. I can see people really not liking this because of the heavy ginger, but I like it. Less sweetness would be great."
""
""
""
"As a Hoppin' Frog devotee and pumpkin ale skeptic, I approached this brew cautiously optimistic. Or was I optimistically cautious? Whatever, it's a good beer. Hoppin' Frog Frog's Hollow pours a deeper shade of orange than other examples of the style I've recently had. Head vanishes almost instantly. Very sweet on the nose. This worries me. I like sweet beers but pumpkin ales overdo it sometimes. It smells vaguely pumpkin pie-ish, with plenty of sugar and spice and all that. It's sweet on the palate but not cloyingly so. Pumpkin's up front, followed by an array of spices and a sweet vanilla finish. You know something? I like it quite a bit."

"O - I wasn't in the mood for a pumpkin ale, but I had to get rid of it. It turned into a delightful treat. I was surprised at how flavorful it was. Plus the mouthfeel was good. I hate pumpkin beers that are watery."
""
"I'm not all that impressed with this. It's not bad, but poured at a good temperature with some foam at first and then it vanished, with no lace either. Color is a nice clear medium amber with some bubble trails. Aroma is the best part with a nice blend of spice, pumpkin, and caramel. Flavor's a lot like nose, a little tang come thru, tho not much. There is enough bitter to balance. Body is good, carbonation a touch soft. Finish is like flavor, tapers nicely, and has a little alcohol warmth. A bit of a meh beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Alcohol by volume isn't really noticeable , I would have this for a session ...overall I am pleased with this beer and would purchase again"
""
"O- this will probably be one of my last pumpkins of the season, and its a very enjoyable one to go out on. I'll have to keep an eye out for it next year."
"Medium bodied with below average carbonation. Smooth and easy to drink. a good pumpkin ale, but not complex, and not as good as the best pumpkin ales."
""
"Overall- A very good pumpkin beer and one of the better ones that I've tried."
""
""
""
"The burst of pumpkin and bit of crust in the front is really wonderful. A really fantastic beer. One of the better pumpkin beers out there."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A sophisticated, richer take on the pumpkins that's quite tasty. While it features the pumpkin in the taste, there's still plenty of spices to be found bouncing around in the mouth after the finish. This would be a great alternative at the Thanksgiving table to compliment turkey and stuffing, a meal that's always been challenging to pair wine to."
""
""
"D - A rock solid Pumpkin Ale that deserves its place in the top tier of the style... A slightly subpar appearance is quickly erased by the impact of the nose, mouthfeel and especially the stellar flavor and taste... Highly recommended to lover's of the style... The 8.4% ABV is fairly well hidden..."
""
""
"This is just a smooth, balanced, tasty beer that I will seek out again and happily recommend to others."

"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, 2013 vintage bottling. Pours lightly cloudy bright orange amber color with a 1 finger fairly dense off white head with decent retention, that reduces to a thin lace cap that lingers. Slight spotty lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big pumpkin, toast, brown sugar, caramel, cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, ginger, bread, and herbal earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt, pumpkin, and spice notes; with good strength. Taste of pumpkin, brown sugar, caramel, toast, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, clove, bread, and herbal earthiness. Lingering notes of caramel, brown sugar, caramel, toast, cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, ginger, and herbal earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of pumpkin, malt, and spice notes; with a good malt/spice balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a moderately slick and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very good imperial pumpkin ale. All around well balance pumpkin, malt, and spice flavors; and very smooth the sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering."

"Overall: this is a tasty brew that hits the spot when you want a pumpkin beer."

"O- A decent beer. Was a little worried to see a beer with no head but the smell of it with it's drinkability was enough to save this one. Would drink it again if it was offered."

"Very good brew here, love the style and a double pumpkin is even better. A solid bottle to seek out. Good stuff."

"O: Overall it's an alright beer but it doesn't make me think of pumpkin pie, which I think is the ultimate reason most people drink these beers. If you're looking for a higher alcohol version of a pumpkin beer it is something to look at. If you're a fan of ginger beers it is certainly something to look at, in fact I would put it at the forefront of my recommendations to you. If you're looking for that traditional pumpkin pie experience, or you are particular about carbonation levels, I would say look elsewhere. Aside from this the beer does fill that """spiced holiday beer""" niche. If you're just looking for something different or seasonal, you could do worse."

"Overall: I really, really like Pumpkin Ales, especially Imperial Pumpkins. I did like this one. It has the usual flavors I would expect from this type of beer, and it was fairly easy to drink at 8.4%. Definitely worth a try. That being said, if the chips are down, I would grab a Southern Tier Pumpking, Dogfish Head Punkin' Ale, or a Weyerbacher Pumpkin before I would grab one of these. Cheers!!"

"O: A pretty spiced pumpkin beer and a bit boozy; I like it but I couldn't drink too many of these"

"this is one of the better pumpkin beers i've had this year, albeit a little late."

"Overall- A great pumpkin ale; my second beer from Hopping Frog and I was not disappointed."
""
""
""
""
"Thin head on a hazy copper with golden hue body. Aroma of brown sugar spices and pumpkin. Fresh pumpkin, pumpkin pie, no booze really, light brown sugar flavors hitch are very clean, not too sweet or sour. Medium body and moderate carbonation. Pretty standard but many if these go overboard with the sour fresh pumpkin flavor but this one is balanced well with pumpkin pie sweetness."
""
"O: A great pumpkin beer: flavorful yet incredibly drinkable. I'd buy it again if it were less expensive - that, or I might try the barrel-aged version."
""
"Beer is medium bodied, with medium to medium-light levels of carbonation. The result is a surprisingly light body for a """double""" ale, fairly smooth-flowing and marginally crisp. Closes semi-dry with modest stickiness remaining across the palate. Somewhat disappointing, was expecting a bigger body on this beer, while the one I found was more appropriate to a """single""" pumpkin ale."
""
""
"D - I'm not a big pumpkin beer guy, but this is a particularly average one. While I appreciate that it isn't overspiced, the lack of malt depth and out-of-place booziness is a turn off. I wouldn't bother with this one again in the future."
"O: With more great pumpkins (no pun) being brewed every year, there really is no reason to try this one again. It is OK. If I had it in a bar I would probably feel that it is a decent effort, but when you put this next to a Smashed Pumpkin, or the superb Unita Oak Jacked, this falls way flat."
"Liked it - tastes nice. Not overwhelming on the spices so the pumpkin is the star for a change. Very pretty in the glass, nice head, orange body, much lacing. The spices are supporting actors in the aroma and flavor profiles - even maybe a little kick of ginger in there that;s nice. Better than others that are just jacked up on the pie spice mix. Taste overall was cleaner and more crisp versus """heavy and syrupy""". Besides the label is SO cool, worth having just for that! Wife and I thought it different versus the herd of pumpkin seasonal brews (and we tried a raft of them) - and different in a good way."
""
"Pours a clean orange-ish color with a small off white to no head. In the aroma, a mixed bag of spices and some mellow pumpkin. In the taste, a mixed bag of spices, but none that stand out more than the other, and a touch fruity, especially banana. A spice bite and a medium bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry spice and banana peel in the aftertaste. Spicy, but not defined, the banana thing kind of throws me, just about average."
""
"O: As far as Hoppin Frog....this one let me down. Sorry folks."
"Overall, this is a solid pumpkin ale that is probably a bit over-priced for the quality. The mouthfeel is a tad too watery and more viscosity wouldn't hurt. If this were $7-$8 a bomber, it would easily be one of the best seasonals on the shelf. Regardless, it's still above average and in my top 5 pumpkin ales. I would love to try the barrel aged version of this!"
""
"Overall a very good pumpkin beer. One worth seeking out if you enjoy the style."
""
"Pours a bright copper with a finger of head, some of which sticks around for some time and leaves nice lacing on the glass. Nose contains both pumpkin and pie spices. Pumpkin flavor is also quite apparent upfront. Intermingling with the pumpkin flavors is a subtle sweetness that almost tastes like honey graham crackers. The finish has a touch of alcohol and becomes a touch too astringent as time goes on. The booziness increased and made it a tad difficult to finish the bottle on my own - but I prevailed in the end!"
""
""
""
""
""
"On tap at Kickbacks in Jax. Poured into a small snifter. Tiny bubbles, frothy light beige head atop a light amber/copper body. Aroma is malty sweet with some sweet spicing also some mild pumpkin rind, some pulp and some brown sugary sweetness. Taste is lightly spicy, nice pumpkin pie crust. Sort of toes the line between pumpkin and pumpkin pie as far as pumpkin beers go. Very drinkable for the high abv and certainly one of the best pumpkin beers out there. I'm not saying that its better than Pumking, but great."

"a big bold pumpkin beer, perhaps not the most unique in terms of flavor, but its also one of the least offensive big pumpkin beers ive had. it pours clear bright bright orange, moreso than any other pumpkin beer ive imbibed. couple inches of white head on top, but it fades fast. the nose features some allspice and fresh ginger, a tad lighter on the cinnamon than most. dont smell the pumpkin at all. pumpkin comes in the flavor, sweeter and roasty, brown sugary, buttery. its fall in a glass thats for sure, but the alcohol strength stands out pretty heavily. i enjoyed the aftertaste of this, where the spices continue to evolve. mouthfeel is a little undercarbonated i think, but on the whole, feels about right for what it is. a little overpriced too at 11 bucks a bomber, but its a tasty fall beer."
""

"O: This is a pretty good pumpkin brew. The flavor profile is solid, but perhaps they could easy up a bit on the cinnamon and go with more pumpkin nuances. Also, the body could use some thickening. All and all, not bad."
"Poured from the bottle into a sampler glass, one gets a get shot of cinnamon in the aroma.The appearnce was a golden color with an off white head. Without being overdramatic, this is the worst pumpkin ale I have ever had. At first, it reminded me of the little cinnamon hearts at grade school Valentine's Day parties. Then I further though those hot dose of Cinnamon reminded me of Hot Dam! Nobody drinks that stuff straight, and nobody should put it in my beer. When it came to the aftertaste, it got the burn of cinnamon mouthwash yielding to a more mediciney flavor. At least the beer was thin and the taste did not last long. Did I get the bottom of the barrel in my bottle? Pumpkin and clove and the other things people found were nonexistant as far as I'm concerned."

"Lightly hazy orange-amber colour, ring of white head, light lace as well. Smell is of cinnamon candy or Big Red gum initially, nutmeg, ginger, bits of pumpkin and a nice bready malt note as well. Taste is cinnamon up front followed by citrus and fruit, a really nice malt presence, ginger and nutmeg , bits of pumpkin but for the most part is fairly subtle. Medium carbonation, medium feel. A nice spicy pumpkin beer, something meant to be shared for sure though."
""
""
"D: pretty solid pumpkin beer. as I have said a few times with pumpkin beers, solid spice character dominates the palate. pretty solid though, theres enough malt to balance things out and provide a reallys olid backbone to all this spice."
"O- Not a must have pumpkin ale. This one just seems like it does not fit in with the other imperial pumpkin ales on the market. It is good, just not great."
"Overall, I am not too impressed. I'm almost wondering if something isn't wrong with my bottle as there is literally no carbonation. A little more mouthfeel would have really helped this out."
"O - I'm a big proponent of pumpkin beers, especially in fall when very little stands in between me and trying every one I can get my hands on, but I find the money I spend on this bottle quite regrettable. Frog's Hollow Double Pumpkin Ale seemingly takes a good pumpkin beer recipe and doubles the malt with out following suit with pumpkin, spice, and hops. Overly sweet, rich with unnecessary alcohol, and completely lacking in the core essence of this beer as outlined by the name; Double Pumpkin. Where's the pumpkin? In the end, I can't bring myself to label this beer as offensive, but if it's a true """double pumpkin""" you're looking for, reach for Pumking and save yourself some money in the process."
""
"Overall: A flavorful pumpkin treat. I love the depth and richness of this one. This one jumps out as one of the more complex pumpkin brews along the lines of Southern Tier's Pumpking..although I think I prefer ST. I would get this again if I wanted a nice pumpkin sipper."
""
""
""
""
"Orange with some redder highlights. Ring of retention and light lacing. Nose of hot tamales candy, light ginger, sweet malt, and light pumpkin. Some citrus perhaps, very perfumey. Taste of sweet pumpkin, spicing more in cinnamon and ginger, light clove and sweet malt. Full feel but not syrupy, lower carbonation and not overly sweet. A really good spiced beer, pumpkin is subtle. Very nice stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O/D-A pretty good Pump beer. Not the best I have had this season. A little less complex than Pumpking. But it holds up with the better offerings of the style."

"Overall - Good beer that I will not hesitate to drink again. Not overly sweet."
""
""
"Pours straight orange, clear, very nice but lacks any head to speak of, there's no retention, and no lacing, so a little disappointed with the appearance. Smell is toffee, buttery crackers, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Taste is fantastic. Sweetness initially, which fades into flavor..Buttery cracker crust, pumpkin, nutmeg, allspice, a bit of spice from clove and ginger. A little more sweetness squeaks through here and there to add to the complexity. Very nice, delicious. Firm, creamy, medium mouthfeel. Alcohol is noticeable, but in a good way, in that it lets you know your drinking an imperial ale and not eating grandma's state fair blue ribbon pumpkin pie. Well balanced, and finish isn't cloying at all, its sweet at times, but you wouldn't describe Frog's Hollow Double Pumpkin as 'sweet', and that's what makes it extra good, and hence, this bad boy is right up there and maybe surpassing my all time favorite Pumking."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The alcohol is this beer is hidden in the taste but there is a light presence in the mouthfeel - this is an enjoyable beer but definitely not sessionable due to the high ABV. I enjoy the fact that while I pumpkin beer, it is not overly sweet."

"This beer smells and tastes very good. It's maybe a little lite on the body and I would like some hop presence so that I know I'm drinking beer. On the other hand it's one of the better pumpkin beers I have had."
"O: I like this beer. The flavors are solid, without being over-the-top. I look forward to seeing this in the fall."
"(originally reviewed: 09-26-2011)"

"O - OVERALL the beer is horrible. if you like drinking sugar water this is great."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"pour is transparent deep golems orange, fairly tight white head. The nose isn't overpowering but mostly spice, cinnamon, nutmeg, pumpkin spice light. Hints of grain underneath. Taste has more grain, a light metallic note, reduced spice, light pepper spice. Body is light, high carb, a touch messy. Rather average."
" Frog's Hollow: Hey, at least it ain't Pumking!"
""
""
""
"I could drink this every night and be happy about it. I've had a lot of fall seasonals and this is pretty much spot on for Halloween or Thanksgiving."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: one of the best pumpkin brew IMO. This'll be on Thanksgiving table next year."
""
""
"D-Overall this was a little bit of a let down.. It had alright flavors but i don't think everything came together like they wanted it to.. Its a decent pumpkin ale but there are tons out there that our better. I'm glad to have tried this but i will reach for something different next October."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- wouldn't buy this one again. Too potent with the overly sweet notes"
""
""
""
"O: Overall liked the flavor, imperial spicing while the alcohol is hidden rather well behind the sweetness and spicing. Flavor is quite clean and very smooth in transition. Good dessert beer. If you like your pumpkin pie heavily spiced then this may be for you."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"While sometimes less is more, here an enthusiastic load of spices was simply way too much - actually overwhelming. Nutmeg, allspice, clove - raid the spice cabinet. A pumpkin pie with this much spice would be overdone, and this beer bordered on undrinkable. Sweet, a bit syrupy malt with some ETOH heat. Struggled on for a while and gave up."
""
""
""
""
""
"Very good pumpkin ale. On the pricey side but so is every beer in DC :)"
"good tasting beer here. its just not what i would call a pumpkin first and foremost. giving it a rough ballpark estimate the spice flavor is like four or five time as big as the pumpkin flavor."
"This is another pumpkin beer lovers of the style could make a regular."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - There was no love for this one in the tasting group. I think it was because of the barrel aged stuff is totally different. I think it's fun however."
"O: A pretty decent pumpkin ale. I'd like a bit less spice presence in the flavor and more vanilla/pumpkin. Still, it smells quite good and is pretty tasty."
""
""
""
"A good, but over-priced pumpkin ale, for these guys this is a let down. Give me Schaflys any day day, can almost buy a case for the cost of two of these bombers; in other word either these guys & or Roof BRos in Paducah have hosed me...."
""
""
""
""
"O - A good pumpkin brew."
"Quality pumpkin ale, typical spicing and all the expected flavor components...a bit of alcohol showing itself here and there...nice thanksgiving night night capper..."
""
"Aroma is top-notch -- very inviting. Pumpkin flavor and a delicate sweetness are noteworthy and push this beer up the rating scale. My only criticism is the beer seems a bit watery and flat. My wish is that the beer would have been twice as strong flavorwise (increased cost/price would be worth it!) and that it would form a rich head in the glass. That would be an A+."
""
""
"Double Pumpkin is a good beer. I enjoyed this return to the suds."
"The beer is better than this review sounds, but just is really weird...I don't know a better way to describe it. Factor in a retail price of 12 bucks a bomber and this is a beer I won't have again."
""
""
""
""
"This started off pretty good, but went downhill as it warmed. The spices and booze began to dominate and it just never recovered. I prefer more pumpkin and less spice in my pumpkin ales."
""
"O: Excellent pumpkin ale. Heavy on the pumpkin but the spices don't get completely overshadowed either."
""
""
""
""

"Overall: The smell is GREAT! The banana was a huge surprise for me. The taste had too much alcohol presence. Seemed to overpower the other flavors. Cheers!"
"O: It's not bad. I liked it, but I prefer others."
"O-Extremely solid and tasty pumpkin ale.Second best I've tasted behind Schlafly."
"I generally don't like pumpkin beers, but this is the best I've had-- of course, that ONLY goes for an aged bottle! Fresh I was less than impressed!"
"Medium, smooth, oily body, almost no carbonation. Pumpkin, alcohol, caramel and spices fill the mouth. Long, dry finish. I expected much more from this brew."
"Overall: Frog's Hollow Double Pumpkin Ale seems to be a little better than most beers of this style.. ideal for a cold Fall night."
"Tastes just like it smells with a little more cinnamon in the mix and a little creaminess to the mouthfeel. The finish is a warming alcoholic pumpkin pie brew. Will buy again next year."
"Pours a golden orange, with no head. None, as in little to no carbonation. Smells of cinnamon, spices and a """typical""" pumpkin beer. Smell wasn't bad, but the tasete, here we go...overly sweet, overly spiced and an unbalanced mess. Comepletely one diminsional throughout. No body at all and seemed way thin. Would've been a pour, but it was all I had for the day before Halloween."
"Iam not sure if I got a bad bottle but Iam gonna review it now and get another in the future,this was not very good at all.Poured a dull burnt orange with no head to speak of at all,just looked flat.Heavy spice in the nose with cinnamon,and clove being most prominant over mace and cardamom.Overly spiced flavors with cinnamon and cardamom being way overdone.I had high expectations for this beer,Iam not sure if its off, or really this bad.Just sweet boozy and overspiced."
"I just did a blind taste test with 8 friends as judges of 19 different pumpkin ales and Hoppin Frog finished second overall. It was interesting that the top two finishers had ABV's above 8%. You can check the results out at the Tristate Beer Blog : http://tristatebeerblog.blogspot.com/2011/10/great-pumpkin-tasting-results-and.html Enjoy!"
"O - I felt this was probably the best thought out pumpkin brew I've had. Good balance and tasty."
"Sits light with a decent body. It has lager smoothness with all the spices of an ale. Could use a little sanding of the rough edges, but the base is here."
"I've had this before and don't remember all of the ginger. If it was a little bit more balanced with the rest of the beer, I would give this a better score. It's almost like any other pumpkin beer mixed with some ginger ale, half and half. As it warms it gets better, but I'm surprised more people aren't getting this much ginger."
"Top notch, this is the top beer of my two favorite pumpkins for '11."
"Overall – A solid pumpkin beer. Coincidentally I probably like this with age on it. I’ll have to pick up a fresher one to see how it compares, but this has held up surprisingly well."
"This was a nice beer, and in terms of flavor, perhaps the most likely contender to take on Pumking I've tasted this year. However, I still think this one falls short. The flavors are intense but not as balanced as they could be. Not to mention it got worse at it warmed."
"Overall: This is a really solid pumpkin beer. Lots of pie spice and well balanced."
"Overall: I'm not sure my low score here is as characteristic as I want it to be for what I think about this brew, but as I've stated before, the missing carbonation and hop element could, possibly, end up doing a lot for this. Nothing will help the huge melange of spices, so if you're not into that or are afraid, stay away. But again, I feel like, whether they intended it or not, the girls who like the spicy pumpkin or holiday ales would really like this. Otherwise, and though I did enjoy this, I would maybe look elsewhere. Also, for near $10 a bomber, that price point doesn't work for me for what the beer ends up being in the end. All of this said: I'll still continue to check out more beers from HF, since I really like what they're doing... from the ones I've tried thus far, that is."
"It pours the common color of most other pumpkins with a head to match the others as well, however poorly sustained. Similar aroma profile but heavy on something. There's one thing that stands out as another recent reviewer put """like potpurri""" but I'm not likin' it. A bit boozy which isn't welcome here due to other flavor flaws, I'm looking forward to liking a beer again from Akron Ohio."
"D-The spices are once again just too much for me. I prefer a more subtle pumpkin beer with less carbonation since the spices tend to thin a beer out on their own."
"I'm impressed! I don't run into many great pumpkin ales any more, but this one's really doing the trick. Again, very complex & with some new qualities. Still don't know if it's in the running with Pumking, but it's not too far behind - just a very different beer."
"Pours a clear honey orange with a 1/2 inch fizzy off-white head that settles to nothing. No lacing on this one whatsoever. Smell is very spice forward with the cinnamon coming across as cinnamon flavored gum. I am also getting some minor malt and pumpkin aromas. Taste is of cinnamon gum right off the bat, followed by other pumpkin pie spices. Actual malt and pumpkin flavors are very subdued overall. This beer does have a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is just not a very good beer. All the components are average or above but all together this beer is too one dimensional with the overwhelming spice (especially cinnamon) smells and tastes."
"O: Considering its strength, this beer is very easy to drink because the alcohol is well hidden from the taste."
"O- The spices are a bit stale and bland or really overcooked with an odd vegital flavor for support. I didn't get any malt character out of this. I was pretty let down and I enjoy pumpkin beers this time of year."
"Pours a slightly hazed orange copper with minimal white head. The nose is of cinnamon, nutmeg and some clove. The taste is a cadied spiced up autumn brew that is perfect for this cool night. Cinnamon with pumpkin spice and some yeast. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with some candy stickiness. Overall, fire brew for the fall season that really represents the style well."
"O- This doesn't have that fresh, pumpkin pie taste that I enjoy in my pumpkin beers. I may see what some time does to my other bottle though..."
"Overall, is it drinkable? Yes. In fact, the warming effect of the alcohol is quite pleasant on a nice Fall night (which is what beers of this style are meant for, right?). If you like the spices associated with pumpkin pie, and are a fan of the sweeter side of beer, this one is for you."
"O - A solid Pumpkin Ale, definitely on the spicier side of the table!"
"O: this pumpkin beer is unique in that the spice profile is more intense than I've experienced in other. It captures the pumpkin pie spices well and the alcohol is well integrate."
"Overall: A highly-enjoyable, very sessionable pumpkin ale. I'd hoped for a bit more maltiness and body, but overall, I recommend you try this one."
"O - A very nice offering of the style; not too many of the pumpkin beers I enjoy manage to get both the meaty pumpkin AND the pumpkin pie thing going on in the same beer. Well played Hoppin' Frog...well played."
"O - very nicely done. the spice is there but it isn't overwhelming"
"I had to drain pour half of the bottle. I don't remember this being THAT bad. Perhaps it tasted better in my earlier craft beer years OR perhaps I just got a bad bottle this go around. I'm convinced I could brew a better pumpkin beer and I have never even attempted such."
"Overall a good pumpkin beer."
"OA: I really liked this, want more! Haven't found a lot of pumkins I like this one was over the top Stallone style."
"Overall - Not the flavor bomb i was expecting, espically from this brewery that features over the top flavored beers. Rather smooth and dangerous at 8.4 % drinkibilty. Wish it had more pumpkin flavor and a little lest ginger. Worth a drink for sure, just a little weak from hoppin frog."
"Overall: It's okay, but, for me, it's definitely not the best from the imperial pumpkin ale patch."
"Poured a brownish-orage w/ a quicky dying fizzy head on top of an intense pumpkin aroma, although I pick up hints of sweet cinnamon and nutmeg but they're overpowered by pepper and clove. A real smooth and easy down the hatch body, lighter bodied and kind of slick. I found this to be an enjoyable sipping pumpkin beer as the pumpkin is strong and the sweetness is there. The spices and the alcohol narrowly edge this though, as I found sweetness giving way to a dry, alkie burn and sharp pepper spice notes. The finish is warming and spicey dry which is appreciated. A good pumpkin ale but overall I tend to like them a tad sweeter."
"Overall this was a great find. Great tasting pumpkin ale with a hefty 8.4% abv. One of the better pumpkin ales that I've had. Worth picking up for sho."
"O: Naturally, I liked this beer, and recommend you try it. The sweetness of pumpkin pie spice and flavors is secondary to the savory, vegetal aspects of pumpkin - this is a full course ale. Personally, for a pumpkin ale, I tend to prefer something either a little sweeter (like Southern Tier's Pumking), a little more distinguished (like Dogfish Head's Punkin), or a little brighter (like Shipyard's Smashed Pumpkin). But depending on your tastes, this may be precisely your pint of ale. Only one way to find out, eh?"
"Overall - The more pumpkin beers I have, the more discriminating I become. This tastes good, but it's just a cinnamon and clove beer. I want some pumpkin!"
"overall it's a solid pumpkin ale, flavorful and enjoyable. however i wouldn't put it at the top of my list of favorite pumpkins. tried as part of a pumpkin ale tasting and it generally ranked among the middle of the pack, behind the likes of pumking, weyerbacher imperial pumpkin, and punkin."
"Probably the most unique pumpkin ale I've had. Very flavorful and enjoyable if you like ginger and cloves, but a bit on the potent side. Worth trying for sure, but may not be a return beer for some."
"My first foray into the world of Hoppin Frog was a bit disappointing. Bought a 22 oz bomber along with a bunch of other fall beers and kept it aside to taste on its own. Shared it with a buddy, poured into 8 oz tulip glasses. A beautiful burnt orange color and great smells of clove and nutmeg...but where's the carbonation? No head, no lacing. The taste is strongly clove with other spices and pumpkin in the background, but the sweetness lingers and becomes cloying with good carbonation to scrub the tongue. There's a good alcohol presence that made me check the bottle to see if it was barrel aged but again, the sweetness is overwhelming without carbonation. Overall, interesting, but not one of my favorites this season. Kind of made me want a whiskey..."
"Overall I liked the beer a lot, smell was everything you would want from a pumpkin beer. Taste gets a little time to warm up to but when it does it's one of the better of the style"
"Pours an orange clear color with no head. Upon drinking no lacing is present on the glass. The aroma is of nutmeg, cinnomon, and pumpkin. It is an inviting aroma but weaker than most. The tatse has a pumpkim backbone with the flavors of nutmeg, cinnomon, and a little breadiness to it. The mouthfeel is lightly carbonated. Overall it was a mid pack pumpkin beer the taste and aroma were okay but not top of the class. A little stronger taste would help."
"O - This is a solid pumpkin ale, not one of my favorites, but worth checking out. I like Pumpkin Ales and I like Hoppin' Frog, but my main drawback is the aftertaste which is a little watery for my liking and the spices could be dialed up a bit."
"O: A good pumpkin beer, not my favorite, but I would definitely drink it again. A very good mix between spice and sweetness. It also masks the decently high alcohol content well."
"The beer pours a dark amber/orange color with a thick frothy off-white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has an excellent pumpkin scent along with complimentary cinnamon and nutmeg spices. The malt bill provides adequate depth and complexity. The taste is good as well. It has a smooth pale and crystal malt flavor along with nice pumpkin character. The spicing is adequate and rounds out the flavor. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with low to adequate carbonation. This is a tasty seasonal that's bold, yet accessible to the casual pumpkin beer drinker."
"I like pumpkin beers and I like Hoppin' Frog brews usually, but this one didn't do it for me at all. Way overpowering in the spice department while being watery and one dimensional. Pass."
"O: A nice pumpkin ale. Not too overpowering and a nice flavor."
"Expectations high, as this was a Gold Medal winner at the 2010 GABF (field beer category). Pour is disappointing, honestly. A tiny fizz of head gives way to nothing in less than a minute. The good thing is, and this is what keeps it at an average score, is that the color is a beautiful golden-orange. The light really plays around, and I see a few carb trails So, strange that it has no head. Ah, but the smell is where things get good. At first whiff, nothing more than a well-crafted, spicy pumpkin pie comes to mind. Seriously, it is a ringer - the cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice play a part here. As I drink more, the feel of the clove, and definitely the ginger come out with gobs of pumpkin. Finishes sharply. A pumpkin laser of saturation. The 8.4% is masked well. A delicious pumpkin beer."
"Overall I came in with fairly low expectations and was fairly surprised. Certainly I could only drink these every once in a while; The early onset of fall seems like a good enough time."
"I have to admit a bias toward this brewery in general, and also to pumpkin ales as a style. This is a solid example, though not my favorite. I'd say it's a little spicier than I'd like, but still good. Not as sweet as some others, which is a plus in this case."
"Overall, a very good pumpkin beer."
"enjoyed during an impromptu pumpkin tasting. orangey amber hue. scent is a punch of nutmeg and kiss of pumpkin. taste is more subtle but extremely enjoyable. hint of alcohol. smiley face on the note pad. have to stock up on this one as we have a few moons till thanksgiving."
"O: Solid and enjoyable."
"22 ounce serving with a big deep orange copper body representing the Hoppin' Frog out of Akron, Ohio. Aroma hits you in the face with clove, and other aromatics in the way of ginger cinnamon and nutmeg. Classic pumpkin pie spices with some meaty juicy pumpkin gourds going on as well. Really well balanced between loads of pumpkin pie spice and sweet caramel candy pumpkin fruit sugars, pretty amazing feet to spice it so heavily with a beer with this much spice character to not come off cloying. Almost a toasted marshmallow like experience full of roasted caramel, this beer is pretty awesome even if you don't like pumpkin pie. It's actually easier to drink than alot of other imperial pumpkin ales out there but just super spicy, I'm givnig my second half to my wife and I will cleanse the palate and start in on a fresh six of Green Flash WCIPA. Overall a decent pumpkin ale that should probably be served in 12 ounce portions, but it's still a good version of a widely abused style."
"22oz bomber. Pours a deep orange color. Aroma of pumpkin pie spice, cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg and some real pumpkin smell as well. In the taste, a solid layer of the pumpkin pie spice, with pumpkin flavor in the background. A touch of vanilla, but mostly a dry spicy flavor. The alcohol is very well hidden. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, crisp, with a lingering spice. Overall, a nice Imperial Pumpkin Ale. If you like a well spiced pumpkin pie, this beer is for you."
"Overall a very delicious pumpkin ale."
"Overall: The sweetness and allspice notes are nice, and there's a weird earthiness as well that is a bit unique and interesting. Overall, however, it reminds me more of a Christmas Ale than anything else. I'd be interested to try this fresh and see what it's like."
"Overall - Again, this is probably the most """pumpkin pie""" beer I've had, and nothing was too overpowering. However, I did feel as if it were just a little too sweet. I was thankful to have a friend to share this bomber with because it had a lot of sweetness to it."
"A very tasty brew."
"My first pumpkin beer of this season. Right on. It pours a clear amber-tawn topped by a finger of cream-tan foam. The nose comprises cinnamon, brown sugar, nutmeg, light clove, bread, pumpkin seeds, and caramel. The taste seems to accentuate the spices, blending them all nicely together in a buttery caramel shell. Then, an equally strong blast of pure pumpkin comes in, balancing out the spices and showing that this beer's name is more than appropriate. Damn, does this taste good! The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a kinda creamy feel. Overall, this is probably the best pumpkin beer I've ever had (other than TREAT, but I don't really put that in the pumpkin beer category). Get some."
"O: Frog's Hollow is another solid beer by Hoppin' Frog. Tilts toward the spicy/sweet side of the pumpkin style, but the flavors were balanced and well integrated. Definitely had a prominent cinnamon and brown sugar as well. If it weren't for slightly lackluster carbonation, this would have gotten a better review from me. As it is, it's definitely one of the better pumpkins I have had. I'll definitely revisit, though."
"Mouth feel and overall - The strong mixture of spices blends well with vanilla and pumpkin. The spice thankfully does not overpower the gourd notes. This is a welcoming change to some of the overspiced brews I've been experiencing. Medium-bodied. Sweet in all the right ways; like pumpkin pie. I will definitely be stocking my fridge with this brew until the snow covers the streets."
"The typical pumpkin ale richness that I enjoy is missing here and flavors seemed to fade some on the finish. For a pumpkin ale, this one was just okay as compared to others I've had."
"Pours a lovely burnt orange color with a sadly disappointing lack of head, only splotchy off-white clumps. Scent is fantastic - strong notes of pumpkin pie (light vanilla and cream, grahmn crackery malts) with heavy seasonal spicing (cinnamon, nutmeg, clove). Taste leans heavily on the pie spices, almost overbearing by the time a 22oz bomber is ingested (blended the last 8oz or so with other beers to experiment). All notes from scent are present, just take a back seat to spice. Fuller side of medium bodied, extra creamy but a looong lingering aftertaste kicks the rating down a notch. Overall this beer needs a a little work... A touch less spice could go a long way."
"Pours a lovely orange-amber color, practically pumpkin colored, with practically no head. The smell is of definite pumpkin pie spices, with cinnamon and ginger with hints of nutmeg - a classic blend. The taste matches the smell pretty much, giving it a classic pumpkin pie taste. The flavor is well rounded with a smoother alcohol finish. The overall mouthfeel is fairly light, but still coats the mouth with flavors, and the higher ABV isn't overly noticeable either. Overall, this is a great example of a tasty, but not cloying, pumpkin beer. It's very well spiced, and avoids the trap of being a one note drink."
"O - This has good drinkability. It goes down smooth and the flavor is very nice. Overall, I think it is a very nice pumpkin beer, and I could definitely see myself at thanksgiving dinner with a bottle of this. Also, the more I am drinking this, I am realizing that I am glad the body is on the lighter side. If it were any thicker it would be too much by the end. Anyways, I think this is a very nice example of the style, and I would buy it again."
"The aroma was about as rich in pumpkin spice as you could possibly get. Huge notes of spices that just come whiffing up to the surface. This was an enormously good smelling beer. I swear if you could bottle the fall season, it would come close to this I am sure. The flavor was more of the same, rich in every sense of the word. Huge notes here of all spice, pumpkin, and hints of earthy grains. Tingling the tongue as it went down it was like a piece of pumpkin pie, which is about all that can be said"
"This beer pours out as a golden copper color, almost has a little amber tone as well. The head was nice and left a good lacing down the glass. The smell was spicy, lots of clove and some other autumn spices coming off of it. The taste was nearly all clove to me. I wasn't able to get much pumpkin at all from this brew. The flavors just didn't seem balanced in this one for me. The mouthfeel was pretty good. The overall on this brew is that there seemed to be too much of one spice coming through which hindered my thoughts on this brew."
"D- First taste of a pumpkin beer. Wasn't thinking it would be that close though. The aroma was amazing, really thought you had a pie in front of you! Very nicely done, wish we would have had a 2nd bottle to open up for sure."
"O: This one is a bit much for a bomber. I had trouble finishing a full glass. Glad I split it."
"Overall this is a great pumpkin beer; really on par with Weyerbacher Imperial Pumpkin which I believe it the best pumpkin ale on the planet. This is in the top echelon as far as flavor goes in the Pumpkin beer category. Definitely worth seeking out and highly recommended."
"O: I've had this one sitting in my cellar for a few months, and it has really helped this beer. I was initially dissapointed with it back in October, but a lot of that brash spicing has given way to a really mellow and smooth Pumpkin Ale. I won't be seeking it out next year, but won't roll my eyes if you or someone else decide to."
"Served in a Celebrator Stemmed Glass Tumbler, the beer pours a clear orange/amber color with a small foamy off-white head that went away pretty quickly. Not much lacing at all. Aroma is very strong and spicy, mostly like cinnamon and cloves but with some nutmeg, ginger and pumpkin noticeable too, Reminded me of a Weyerbacher Imperial Pumpkin Ale. I can taste all the spices and pumpkin.The finish was very long and Nice and spicy. Fairly full bodied and smooth. The alcohol was well hidden. I think this is has moved into my """Top 3 Favorite Pumpkin Ales""""
"Na Zdravje!"
"Nice beer. Doesn't knock Pumking or DFH Punkin off the top two spots for me, but nice none the less."
"Overall, a decent pumpkin beer. I remember liking this a lot more on tap at GABF - at that point it was one of my favorite pumpkin beers. Not sure if I got a bad bottle, or if it's just better on tap, or if I had a few too many at GABF by that point, but this is just OK. It's a bit flat and overly sweet with some off notes."
"D= The drinkability was decent wouldn't want more than one from this style of beer period. Hoppin' Frog's was good but I liked Southern Tier's better."
"Almost no head and the fluid is cloudy darkyellow. Pumpkin all a round with some cinnamon and ginger. This is a very fruity beer and i liked every sip of it. Never had a pumpkin ale but i liked this one."
"A great representation for the style, up there with the greats of this style. Very pleasing and would try again next season to see if the recipe changes. Would like more pumpkin less spice or maybe even a vanilla pinch to throttle down the cinnamon and nutmeg."
"This is one and done for me but I would recommend it if you like Imperial Pumpkin Ales. It's got all the spices and pumpkin you could ask for."
"D: Really good."
"Drinkability- Uh, not the best. It's too sweet and oddly tart for my liking. I need a bit of pumpkin in the flavor to balance all those spices. Not sure about that tartness though. I'm thinking maybe it's an over abundance of ginger but it's weird and not really proper for a pumpkin beer. The only real strength of the beer is the fact that it's damn near 8.5% and I don't get a touch of booze. Thanks very much for the opportunity Bobby!"
"Strong aroma has a strong spicy overtone, mainly cinnamon, with pumpkin and subtle malty tones as well. It pours a pretty clear amber with a thick, fluffy, fairly persistent white head. Flavor is malty and spicy with a nice pumpkin-pie overtone and a hint of caramel. Texture is rather fizzy, leaving a spicy finish and a tingle that hangs around for a little bit. This is an excellent autumn beer, perfect for Halloween or Thanksgiving!"
"Overall a great pumpkin beer. Honestly not what I was expecting from Hoppin Frog, but very solid all around. Thought this would be bigger - it's huge on taste, but the body is kept small enough that its a drinker vs. a sipper. Well done, Hoppin Frog, and at a fair price point."
"Somewhat dry finish, no alcohol present. A nice balance between sweet and spiced."
"drinkability: good"
"Hoppin' Frog's Hollow Double Pumpkin. Found this guy in a bomber about a week ago. I've recently gotten into pumpkin beers, after shying away from them for a number of years. They're an acquired taste, to be certain, but they can be quite tasty, if you know what you're getting into. First thing I notice when pouring the beer is the clarity. Brewing with pumpkin you would expect it to be cloudy, but that's not the case. Color is a crystal clear orange. (It's a pumpkin beer - what did you expect?) Fizzy head that recedes quickly. Aroma is nutmeg, allspice, pumpkin, and maybe some cinnamon. Smells like pumpkin pie. Taste is more bready and caramel, like pie crust, chased by a heavy dose of more nutmeg, allspice, clove, and cinnamon. First taste and the pumpkin flavor kind of gets lost behind a heavy wall of spice. Lots of alcohol warm in the finish, which works given the taste profile. For something that calls itself a """double""" pumpkin, I find that particular flavor getting lost, which is too bad because that's my favorite part of this style of beer. For an imperial I find that this lacks body, as it's kind of watery, which is also somewhat disappointing. Overall it's a nice take on the style but nothing earth shattering. Somewhat disappointed by this, though that may be because I've had some exemplary versions of this style in the past."
"Beer is light to medium in body. Pumpkin comes through, it's pretty spicy with allspice and nutmeg but its not overwelming like I had feared from the aroma. Its pretty nice, I think the warming effect of the alcohol is helping this beer a lot. Its a decent beer and I'd expect nothing less from Hoppin' Frog. Pretty good overall."
"Recommended"
"All in all, this is a very solid beer. I like it because it is rather unique when compared to other Pumpkin Ales out there. It's no ST Pumking, but I would def. drink this again."
"Pours a golden amber with a fairly slight head. Smells somewhat sweet and toasty- less like pumpkin than pumpkin pie spices. There is also a nuttiness like toasted pumpkin seeds and a bit of waxiness. The taste is has more of that nuttiness and less spice- still not a lot of true pumpkin, but overall it's less sweet than the smell. There is an interesting finish that develops some light cocoa flavors`and then a touch of mint at the end. Definitely a bit different while still being somewhat subtle. Smooth, somewhat nutty, which lends some creaminess, and only moderately sweet in the mouth. Pretty good, a little different profile, but not a lot of real pumpkin flavor."
"Drinkability: This one is a let down. The most expensive of three I recently bought (Pumking, and Weyerbachers were the others), and the worst. Its too boozy tasting, too flat, and not malty tasting enough for a """double pumpkin ale.""" See Pumking for the way this is supposed to be done."
"D/M:Nice crisp and clean. Great balance of flavors and alcohol."
"Fairly drinkable after some aging but very spicey at first."
"Pours a moderate orange color with a fairly decent head that receded somewhat quickly. Nose is a bit overspiced, with a lot of nutmeg coming through in addition to other pumpkin pie spices. The taste mixes the spicing and the sweet pumpkin better, and also adds in a little bit of brown sugar. Medium body with good carbonation. Not the best pumpkin beer of the night, but pretty good overall."
"Dry malt start. This quickly gives way to strong white pepper and all spice flavors. The finish is very dry. The aftertaste is similar to pumpkin pie without sugar. The body is decent, but the carbonation is quite high. Overall, a very dry ale."
"All in all, this is a solid brew. Not amazing, but good. Good to try if you like Pumpkin ales. Otherwise, don't bother hunting down."
"D: Very drinkable. This will definitely be on my beer list for the next fall season."
"Flavor follows the nose very closely (which is a good thing). There is a gentle warming sensation from the alcohol but its not overwhelming. A bit too thin for my taste, but not so much so that it really takes away from this overall excellent beer. Would definitely drink more of this."
"D: This is a really nice pumpkin. If you enjoy more spice with your pumpkin beers, like a Pumpking or DFH Punkin, this is a beer that should be tried."
"I am not a big fan of pumpkin ales. I find them for the most part to be very sweet and over spiced. I also find cloves to be nauseating. When this was poured into a small glass for me I was very wary. It pours slightly darker than most pumpkin ales and had a spicy chai scent with pertruding clove aroma. Taste was out of this world though. Somehow the pumpkin compliments the spices and actually is incredibly mellow. Very drinkable with little to no alcohol present. The only pumpkin ale that I would recommend."
"Notes: Sure, this could do with an additional hefty note and still be quite notable as a pumpkin ale, but in this incarnation it feels very well rounded, so why touch it?"
"Drinkable enough, but this is no Pumpking or Punkin. Was happy to see this local brewer win an award at the GABF, though."
"Pours a slightly hazy copper color, it kind of has an orange hue to it. The head is very short lived and leaves the beer looking extremely flat. The aroma is quite a spicy one, name the pumpkin pie spice and it is there. Cinnamon stands out, as well as the nutmeg and allspice. Light ginger, clove and pepper is picked up as well. Has kind of a Big Red aroma to it. The taste is very spicy as well. Big cinnamon flavor along with some nutmeg. The taste doesn't seem as spicy as the aroma. Unfortunatly I don't pick up much pumpkin flavors but there is a solid malt body so that the spice doesn't overwhelm this beer. The flavor is ok but it is an all spice pumpkin ale. The higher ABV doesn't seem to ruin this beer like other """imperial""" or """double""" pumpkin ales. The feel is light to moderate with prickly carbonation, a bit sticky. I guess one of the better all pumpkin spice (no pumpkin) flavored beers, however it doesn't stand up to the likes of DFH or Smuttynose."
"D: This is not something of which I would want to consume more than a small snifter. It might make a nice pairing with pie or cobbler on a brisk autumn day. A small serving goes a long way."
"Very well crafted and certainly one of the better pumpkin ales I have tried."
"D: A decent pumpkin beer, but not as good as some people think IMO. I was hoping this would at least approach the level of Pumking, but it most certainly does not. GABF gold medal? Not if I was one of the judges."
"D- This beer was very good. I could have no problem having a pint of this and asking for another one. The ABV is a little put-off toward the overall drinkability of this beer. A damn good pumpkin beer that I would put in my top 5."
"D - let's not kid ourselves, it's a strongly flavored 8.4% beer. but please, don't let that stop you. if you like pumpkin beers in any form you must try this."
"Supprisingly drinkalbe for a 8.4% spiced beer. Nothing really over powering and a pretty good base beer."
"drinkability is ok but there are many other pumpkin ales I would rather have"
"For me there are some other pumpkin beers out there that take preference. Still, a solid beer that I would not turn away and will have again."
"D: The taste is good, but not great. This one doesn't seem to hit the high standard I have come to expect from this brewery. It is by no means a failure, but it is far from amazing."
"this beer is very exciting at a nice abv around eight percent the smell matches its taste too me and the flavord are not spritzy a nice mellow not to deep pumpkin ale, just some good shit not too sweet, drinkability is great i love it. well balanced. no overpowering of the cinnamon and other spices. better than pumpking and dogfish heads."
"D: An immensely drinkable brew."
"I put a few of these aside in my cellar last year, along with some other heavier pumpkins, so will be interesting to sip alongside the new release for 2010 to see how they stack....nice job once again, Hoppin' Frog!"
"d - A pretty nice pumpkin ale. Would have liked it to be a little sweeter but good none the less. Would drink again."
"D - Massive quantity is not the name of this beer. It was a struggle to get through the whole bottle myself. With that said, I think this would be quite good with a slice of pumpkin pie on a nice cold autumn day."
"D - This is the second """recommended""" pumpkin beer that did have a pretty good sweetness but came off more of a malt liquor with a pretty high boozy factor. I guess I will have to age Pumking and hope the malt and hops work it out and become smooth not hoppy bitter."
"D: I couldn't drink a whole lot of this stuff because this is definitely more of a """gourmet dessert""" type of beer. But like most desserts...if someone offered me another morsel, I wouldn't throw a shit fit."
"Pretty easy to drink for a double pumpkin."
"A little heavy in the stomach, drinking a growler solo would be tough, but with some family this drank nicely and I would be happy to give it another go next year."
"D. Not a bad beer, but one that I likely won't pick up again. My wife and I tend to stick to Oktoberfest beers this time of the year. Occasionally we grab a pumpkin, but we usually end up regretting our decision. Oh well."
"22 ounce bottle. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours a clear orange/amber color with a half inch fizzy off-white head that went away pretty quickly. Not much lacing at all. Aroma is very strong and spicy, mostly like cinnamon and cloves but with some nutmeg, ginger and pumpkin noticable too. I can taste all the spices and pumpkin, but for whatever reason the taste doesn't live up to what this brew smells like. It's a lot weaker tasting than I thought it would be, at least compared to the aroma anyway. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick with low carbonation. Drinkability is OK enough. It's a decent pumpkin ale, but not one of my favorites. I think it's worth trying, I wouldn't turn one down."
"This beer is a deep orange but barely had any head. The smell is all cinnamon at first with other spices coming later. Smells like Big Red gum. The taste reminds me of toothpaste. Minty with some cinnamon, not what I expected. The body is also kind of thin for being imperial. Overall a disappointment, maybe a bad bottle?"
"Drinkability: While it may be a little overly spiced, it's still very good and easily in my top 3 pumpkin ales now; the ABV is a bit high and packs a bit of a punch, so it's going to be a tad more moderate but I'll definitely be picking up several more of these over the course of the season."
"Hoppin' Frog finally hit a home run in my book, and I am definitely going to pick this one up to share with others. To sum it up, smells great, tastes great, looks okay, and drinks well."
"Overall, this wasn't memorable. I had it fresh and it's gone downhill a touch in the cellar, but it was never that great to begin with. I'll pass this year except for one bottle to compare with my other cellared bottle, but I don't have high hopes from what I remember - sorry, Frogs. Thankfully, this season brings us one release closer to the amazing Frosted Frog!!! Skip the pumpkin pie and go straight for the frosting!!"
"Man.Open the bottle and it smell like warm Pumpkin pie. I was ready to eat. Pour it to the bottle nice mid amber in color. The taste is awsome. Pumpkin flavor everywhere and not to heavy in spices you can taste the pumpkin in every sip. Sucks don't have pumpkin pie on hand to drink this with. Boy this is a good beer. This is a must try for anyone that haven't try this beer."
"D: Frog's Hollow is a wonderful version of the style. It may not look as beautiful as ST Pumking or DFH Punkin Ale, but it tastes every bit as good. The balanced flavors of pumpkin and spice keep my mouth watering through the entire bottle. I'll be sure to look for more of this brew in the fall, along with my other favorites mentioned above."
"The body has some slickness to it, like a hefeweizen. Reminds me of a weizenbock actually. Pretty nice, i'll look for this again in the Fall."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: The body of the beer is almost full. The body is also very smooth and slick. The beer disappeared from my glass rapidly. I look forward to having this beer again come the Hallows season. Well Done!...."
"D- Easy to drink for sure. I'll pick this one up for sure next season."
"Pours slightly cloudy, bright orange color, thin head, minimal lace. Lots of spicy aromas as soon as the cap comes off. Label lists cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, allspice, ginger; an they all are there. Sweetish malt base, with all the spices in the finish. Good level of carbonation. Not really any hops or bitterness, but not missed. No alcohol burn dispite the high alcohol percentage. Lots of body, full-flavored, an enjoyable sipper with layers of flavor coming out more as it starts to warm. One of the best 'pumpkin pie in a bottles' since Propeller Pumpkin."
"M/D - I very tasty brew from Hoppin Frog, it isn't an over powering pumpkin ale. It shares a great blend of spices and malts. Smooth going down with no real after taste. Great Ale to enjoy and share, perfect fall seasonal which will add to my radar for purchasing again"
"M/D - smooth, light-medium bodied, for some reason it seems powdery to me, I don't think I will be buying this one again."
"This beer flexes hard, yeah it has its pumpkin spiced side but the imperial side shows off a bit. I dig this beer a lot."
"Medium body with light to medium carbonation. Overall this really wasn't too bad but could've been pulled off a lot better. It seemed better as a spiced beer than as a true pumpkin ale and I expected better from Hoppin Frog. A nice try and certainly not a drainpour, but not worth what was paid."
"D - Pretty solid imperial pumpkin ale, although I wouldn't rate this on par with the likes of, say, Pumking. Ultimately, the spiciness gets a bit heavy-handed, which prevents the pumpkin character from really shining."
"A most welcome new addition to the increasing number of Imperial Pumpkin Ales out there over the last couple of years, this one did a nice job of providing plenty of both pumpkin meat and spice flavorings, while most importantly, keeping the heat levels at a minimum. A full 22 of this did start to wear a bit on the palate after a bit however. I'd recommend splitting this one with a buddy."
"Could've been better. Considering how much I like Hoppin' Frog's Russian imperial stout and double IPA, I figured this could threaten the throne of the great Pumking. But no, it doesn't."
"Reviewed on 10/3/09. Bottle. Pours a clear orange with a very small ring of white head. Aroma of pumpkin spices (mostly lots of ginger, pepper, clove, nutmeg). Flavor is equally spicy with only a touch of pumpkin pie crust. On the sweet side. Overall, it just isn't very tasty nor very pumpkin-y. Bleh."
"A nice attempt to try something new with a pumpkin beer by adding the ginger. However, I expected more pumpkin in a beer labeled Double Pumpkin Ale. Maybe the """Double""" was only meant to modify """Ale""" and not """Pumpkin"""?"
"Frog's Hollow Double Pumpkin Ale is closer to Single And A Half Pumpkin Ale. Even though it earns the same scores as the three other Imperial pumpkin ales that I've reviewed so far (from Southern Tier, Weyerbacher and Schlafly), it's my least favorite. Again, more malt would fix it right up. Happy (belated) Halloween."
"Notice the 7.4 IBUs..."
"Tasty beer, but needs some body and balance."
"22 oz bottle poured into my Dogfish shaped pint glass. Poured with a small white head that all but disappeared quickly. Not much lacing at all. Aroma is mostly the spices, lots of cinnamon and nutmeg. A little bit of pumpkin aroma in the background. Taste is similar, lots of spices. Spices are a little too much for me, cinnamon is the main flavor I get. Would have liked to taste a little more of the pumpkin instead of the spices. Not bad but not my favorite pumpkin ale."
"D - A nice pumpkin brew. The spices are not overpowring and are great throughout. I've had a few pumpkin ales and this truley is the best I've had."
"I like this."
"Thanks Boatshoes!"
"Light body, maybe too light. Carbonation also seems light. Alcohol is well hidden. Not bad."
"The taste was ok, a little to strong on nutmeg almost makes you gap until you've had a few drinks and you're used to it. The mouthfeel is heavy but not highly drinkable."
"Hoppin' Frog brews some tasty beer. They've quickly become a gem here in Ohio. Frog's Hollow isn't their best beer, but it's definitely good enough to warrant an annual release. The only problem with it is the lack of head. In the grand scheme of things, that's not too big of a deal. It's probably a little better than the final score will reveal for that reason. But, it is what it is. Good stuff, guys."
"This borders on a dessert beer and is not really a session beer for me as it is sweet. I split the bomber with my wife and both of us enjoyed it."
"edit: Finish on this is amazing. It tastes like I've just eaten pumpkin pie, only really get the full effect of it after you haven't taken a sip after a few minutes."
"Because of the mouthfeel and the over spicing, drinkability is just average, I had no problems finishing this bomber but I doubt I'll grab another any time soon."
"Notes: This beer really jumps around everywhere on the categories in my opinion. The taste was unexpected compared to the smell, but I guess that is the beauty of beer. Worth having again and a nice beer for anyone looking for a pumpkin ale."
"The beer is penny copper color, clear, with about 2 fingers of whitish foam. The dominant smells are spices like you'd find in gingerbread cookies and pumpkin pie (per the label: cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, allspice, and clove). The taste is exceptionally good, often these spices are overdone in a pumpkin ale but this beer has enough pale malt sweetness to balance the spices. That might be why it's called a double pumpkin ale, there's enough malt to add body (and ABV) to this beer to combat the spice, making this probably my favorite of the style. I'll look for it again next year."
"Would consider purchasing again next season. I also purchased a case of Dogfishhead punkin ale so I look forward to comparing the two."
"Drinkability: The first thing that pops into my head about this beer is that it is a victim of its own success. This is one of the finer pumpkin beers I've had, but it's just too much to be an all night drinker. It's a great beer to have on a cool autumn night, but I don't think I could do more than one in an evening."
"D - This was a good Pumpkin Ale, but it did not rise to the grand level of Pumking and Punkin, which I think are the best"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation and somewhat thin, disappointing."
"I'm not a fan of pumpkin beers, so I am reviewing this in respect to the style. This is one of the best pumpkin beers I've ever had."
"Probably going to buy a case of these to last me through October. Second favorite Imperial Pumpkin. Definitely try it."
"Creamy medium body which is on the fuller end with a nice malt presence and a very prominent pumpkin pie spiciness. Pretty sweet but not too much so with a healthy dose of ginger and clove accompanying some brown sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg. The alcohol is extremely well masked making this very drinkable. The prominent ginger and clove notes provide this pumpkin beer with a nice twist that separates it from many of average pumpkin beers. Not the best example of the style but still very good."
"If you want an Imperial Pumpkin stick with Southern Tier, even if this years version is too heavy on the cinnamon."
"I'm thinking the """overall impression""" of this is definitely greater than the sum of its parts. This is enjoyable as hell and I have to anoint this as my new favorite in the Pumpkin category. Sure, it has a little weight to it, but the balance and smoothness do it very well. If you enjoy pumpkin beers this is a must-snag."
"Drinkability suffers a little from the heat, but pretty enjoyable overall... ranks #3 in my book for 'imperial' Pumpkins behind Weyerbacher and Southern Tier."
"The pumpkin flavor comes through more noticeably in the flavor. This beer is still dominated by the spices though. Fairly thin in the mouthfeel. At least more thin than I would like it to be. Still very enjoyable. I think a bomber is more than enough of this beer. Would have liked to see more pumpkin in the flavor and a fuller mouthfeel."
"A 22 ounce bomber bottle poured into my standard shaker glass. The ale appears a clear copper color with about an inch of creamy off white foam. The foam settles to a thin ring in a minute or so. Nose and flavor consist of vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg, roasted grain, brown sugar, allspice, maybe some ginger. Mostly dominated by spices, not pumpkin. Nice medium to full body and amply carbonated to match the bold spices. Pretty tasty overall."
"I have to admit, I have very limited tasting experince in pumpkin ales. But, I tend to enjoy the ones that are heavier on the spices. This one fits the bill nicely and is a very festive and tasty beer. Not quite as stellar as Pumking, but is still going to be a staple in the fridge throughout the fall months. Beers like this is the reason I love the fall so much."
"This is a drinkable beer. I'm glad I tried it, and as said before, I will place this in my top-5 favorite pumpkin ales. But I would probably not seek this beer out again in anticipation of its release."
"Drinkability: Although the alcohol is well hidden, so is the pumpkin and this beer ultimately overwhelms with the spices"
"Overall, a pretty solid imperial pumpkin ale. I would drink this again."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and creamy with good carbonation. Goes down smooth and the alcohol is well hidden throughout. Overall, I found this to be a spice forward pumpkin ale that didn't come together as nicely as some others I've had. Lots of ginger lingers on with each sip. Worth a shot, but I wish the spices were toned down a bit."
