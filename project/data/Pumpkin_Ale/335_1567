3.44,-2.8,4,3.75,3.25,3,3.5,"Aroma has a spicy overtone, mainly cloves and cinnamon, plus a hint of pumpkin. Pours a dark coppery amber with a decent light tan head that leaves plenty of lacing. Flavor is not strong, but enjoyable, a malty core plus pumpkin and cloves and an earthy underpinning. Edgy texture is about average in the fizz and body departments. If not memorable, a good beer for fall.","Cyberkedi","Jan 06, 2015"
3.56,0.6,3.5,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Bottle sampled. Slight whiff of nutmeg on the nose. Has a deep dark orange hue that gives credence to the use of real pumpkin here. The spices take a back seat - bitter and sweet pumpkin takes control of the flavor profile. Body is a little watery - maybe to be expected at a lower ABV.","Barnoloid","Jan 04, 2015"

There is a nice pumpkin flavor, some moderate pie spice, and a good balance.  The finish isn't overly sweet.  It's a little hazy, bronzish-amber in color, and has a nice white head.  The smell is the best quality, although the taste is solid as well.  Full in body.  It's a great Fall brew.","Suds","Sep 27, 2014"

3.42,-3.4,3.75,3.5,3.25,3.5,3.5,"i was unimpressed by this, it seems incredibly flavorless compared to the style standard of the pumpkin beer. maybe folks like it because its so mild, minimal in malt character and in pie spice flavor. maybe its just a touch of fall, rather than a full on plunge into it, but in the context of other pumpkin beers, this one doesnt taste like much. amber colored base beer should have more sweetness and more body, its pretty thin. there is a light cinnamon nose and taste to it, but the pumpkin itself is invisible and there isnt enough other additives in here to fake it. nice carbonation though and with the lighter body i suspect this may make a decent fall session beer for some, but it lacks the spirit of the season for me.","StonedTrippin","Sep 27, 2014"

Aroma is of spiced pumpkin, what I expected. Flavor is ok, but the spices are a little much and take away from the true pumpkin flavor. Spice also leaves a little dry spice feel on the palate. Overall, would have been a bit better with less nutmeg and spice and a little more natural pumpkin flavor","hophugger","Sep 25, 2014"

3.71,4.8,3.75,4,3.5,3.75,3.75,"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was the complexity of its nose. While not all of the components therein were entirely appropriate, the general mix end effort didn’t go unnoticed. In comparison, the taste was frankly dull and flat for everything except its spiciness, cleanliness, and decent freshness, which showed nice raw ginger root and punch throughout. This seems to be a “commercial” type of pumpkin ale. The spice is enough to make sure anyone who was drinking it know it was there, but the rest of the beer is just standard and relatively cheap, so you can buy and consume a ton without getting overwhelmed. This is great for someone looking for an easy autumnal to bring to a party, but might be on the bland side for the seasoned crafter.","TheBrewo","Oct 31, 2013"

Little pumpkin flavor with a slight acidic finish that doesn't really detract from the beer at all. Medium bodied mouth feel with a little zip from the carbonation.

The appearance had an amber color and a bit of a haze to it with about an inch head from the initial pour. The smell was very spicy, but still had a good amount of pumpkin to it. The taste was very unexpected. I had thought that being a pumpkin ale, this would have more of a pumpkin taste to it, but this wasn't the case. It was a lot of nutmeg and a bit of cinnamon. The mouthfeel was not too heavy, and the beer lingered a bit, but a good amount in my opinion. Overall though, I would only give it a 3. With all the great pumpkin beers out there this time of year, this is one that I would drink if someone had it, but probably wouldn't buy again.

3.68,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, bottled 7/26/2012. Pours very hazy orange copper color with a 1 finger fairly dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of pumpkin, bread, cinnamon, clove, caramel, allspice, ginger, nutmeg, and herbal hops. Pretty nice aromas with good strength and decent balance. Taste of biscuit, caramel, toast, cinnamon, pumpkin, clove, ginger, nuttiness, and herbal hops. Lingering notes of caramel, toast, biscuit, nuttiness, spices, and herbal on the finish for a good bit. Good balance of flavors with a good malt/spice balance; zero cloying flavors on the finish. Not too much pumpkin in the taste but it is noticeable; a slight vegetative note but it isn’t detrimental. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and slick mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with nearly zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a nice Pumpkin ale. Good balance of malt and spices; very smooth to drink. I enjoyed this one quite a bit.","superspak","Nov 11, 2012"

Opens with the aforementioned spice and pumpkin accents, slightly bready with toasted grain. Malty with light toffee midpalate, finishes lightly spicy, sweet but semi-dry. One of the better pumpkin ales available in the Midwest and very much a beer. Not overly spiced and sweet and there is enough here to please both those who usually are fans of pumpkin ales and those who are not.","chanokokoro","Oct 31, 2012"

The spiciness throughout is great, but it's in need of a little more balance and body for the cool fall days.

Pours a dark orange with a foamy, inch, off-white head that is pretty much gone after a few minutes. The smell of this beer is really something -- pumpkin spice, sweet cinnamon, nutmeg all contained wrapped around a subtle smokiness. Considering the strength of the smell, the taste is very balanced. Very easy to drink. Cinnamon and pumpkin spice are probably the most notable features, but there's also a subtle mint taste towards the end. A complex brew.","oldirtycaffrey","Oct 04, 2012"

Very savory nose, there is hardly any sweet malt aroma at all! Flavor starts out as a dusty cinnamon spice that transforms into a good solid toasted bread malt and savory pumpkin flesh combo that works well without overpowering my palate on spicing like many pumpkin ales tend to do.

4,13,4,4,4,4,4,"This beer has a nice amber colored body with a nice small tanish head to it that holds its own for a while. The smell has nice pumpkin aroma alomost pie like. The taste is awesome, it has a nice roasted pumpkin flavor with the clove and some peppery notes, espcially once it warms up a little bit that is when the flavor come alive. The mouth feel is very nice, smooth and leaves a nice peppery after taste in your mouth. Overall this is a really good pumpkin beer, not the best i have had but i would say it is now in my top ten.","chefhatt","Sep 09, 2012"

The flavors then quickly shift to the cinnamon and others, very spicy finish, but not overwhelming. Great pumpkin flavors weaved in. This one had nice carbonation and a medium mouthfeel, it was smooth and enjoyable, and didn't overwhelm the palette. Could have multiple beers and not be put off by the spices.

The nose comprises nutmeg, cinnamon, brown sugar, rye bread, toffee, and a touch of butterscotch. The taste brings in more of the same, though the breadiness kicks into higher gear here. The spices are slightly muted, blending into the bread (creating a sort of banana bread quality). There may or may not be a hint of toasted pumpkin seeds in there as well...I can't tell for sure. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly creamy, slightly grainy feel. Overall, a generally enjoyable pumpkin beer.

Really quite the solid look. Nice aroma of pumpkin spice, hints of cinnamon and nutmeg, all the usual characters here with a touch of a west coast hop flair to it, especially as it warms. Crisp and super clean flavor here. Starts with a touch of a light malt note and then swoops in with a big hit of cinnamon and nutmeg which dries out the palate very nicely. Very even consistency I have to admit as it comes together very nice. Light drying of palate leaves a touch of light spice and the lightest hint of hops on the back of the tongue.

The taste of ginger and cinnamon with some nutmeg and pale malt give this a spicy taste. Note of pepper and a carbonic acid or chalkiness combine with the dry taste at the finish. medium mouthfeel with no astringency or alcohol warmth.

Ok, so, the color, let's say, burnt pumpkin orange, it looks malty, but doesn't smell overwhelmingly malty, and has some hops to balance things out a little. Ultimately, this beer smells like a pumpkin pie on first whiff, like a fresh grandma's pumpkin pie, not a canned pumpkin pie filling, or, a stale beer frat house mixed with pumpkin flavoring, but a nicely put together pumpkin beer, and hell, it tastes the same way too. So, for what it is worth, this is the best pumpkin beer I have tried to date, cause this will probably be the LAST pumpkin beer this season, maybe it got an unfair advantage given my history with it, but I do have good tastes, and I know what I am doing so,...trust me, this one is good, it is worthy, IF you truly want a pumpkin pie beer.

There's also a little bit of hop bitterness, and it finishes with some toastiness. It doesn't taste BAD--I actually like it--just a little odd. Up there in the Buttery Beer Hall of Fame with Harbor City Main Street Brown. Despite actually liking the flavor, one is easily enough for me.","battlekow","Sep 15, 2005"

Aromas of pumpkin, cooked veggies with a touch of sweetness. The smell was rather light but still inviting. Taste was smooth, rich and complex enough to make this a good beer but simple enough for the casual beer drinker. Flavors of mild hops, malt, pumpkin, light sugar, and some mild spices. Very nice. Mouthfeel was well balanced, not too heavy and not too light, similar to the weather during the fall season. This is a very drinkable beer, as I am now glad I got more than one.

Like dark roasted coffee, and pumphin was faint, so it was indeed sub-par in the scent category for pumpkin ales but smelled very hoppy and coffee like. It did look the part and was closer to pumpkin orange and dark yellow. I sniffed it again and I'm amazed at how much this smells like a deep roasted coffee! Mouth was average , as any other. This was a different taste for sure. It was more cinnamon than pumpkin but there was a faint pumpkin taste and well, a good ale is masked by the cinnamon. Not really pumpkin tasting. I want to rate this higher, because I could drink a few of these as it wasn't bad and was unusual if plesant tasting, but just not good enough for a pumpkin ale, maybe just a good "octoberfest".","Ricochet","Sep 10, 2005"

I initially got a "winter warmer" type taste from this one, but as it warms it comes into its own. Stronger pumkin notes start coming through, along with some clove. Very easy to drink.

Finishes a bit dry and leaves a nice hop bitterness on the sides of your tongue. I could drink a couple of these in one sitting but not much more than that. It's better to get a six, stick it in the fridge, and have one on a Sunday afternoon while watching some football. Not a great beer, but it is a nice one to drink this time of year.

I could pick up on a little bit of ginger which isn't really the main spice you would want to emphasize in a pumpkin ale. The first sip of this beer is spiciest taste you will experience while drinking this beer. This is because that the spices are so mild that after the first drink or two your taste buds just kind of ignore or forget about them. Could definately use a little more spice.
