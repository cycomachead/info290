I poured into a pint glass and was happy to see an impressive head, with distinct lacing that lasted throughout my entire session. Colour was pure and deep, essembling whiskey in the glass. Nose was subdued, but with subtle spice and lots of roasty pumpkin. The taste is surprisingly dry! Not sweet at all. A nice twist for a genre: a bruise that are often overly sweet and overly spiced. This one is all pumpkin, with a more subtle spice profile than many competitors. It's a bit one dimensional, slightly flat, but with such a nice head and with such a reserved interpretation on pumpkin beer, this is one to try again and a beer to recommend for those who are not fans of the over-the-top examples of this style.","logicalparadox","Sep 17, 2014"

I'd say it's a notch above Shock Top's offering which isn't saying much. The taste is mawkish in every sense of the word, until you get to the end where you taste fresh pumpkin pie. I don't think the first part is worth agonizing through just for a pleasant three second aftertaste. It's actually giving me a little heartburn too. Ah, I wouldn't drink this again.","The-Adjunct-Hippie","Sep 13, 2014"

Looks the part of a pumpkin; orangy-red and maybe a slight haze, actually poured a pretty good head that lasted, well, not very long, but it was there. The nose smells of typical pumpkin-y spices like cloves, cinnamon and nutmeg. Tastes about the same, but this one does have a very slight but noticeable pumpkin flavor to it - I find a lot of others you just get spice and some unidentifiable funkiness to it which I presume is gourd, but here it's recognizable. The best way I can describe it is it tastes like the smell of when a candle starts to cook the lid of a jack o' lantern. The mouthfeel is also quite nice, silky and a little tart on the back end. I think the mouthfeel puts it above the average category and I do also like the fact that you can taste some real pumpkin in here. I've been trying more and more Uinta stuff and have been impressed by many of their offerings. I would easily pick this up again in between some of the bigger pumpkin ales.","BeerWizard","Aug 21, 2014"

The result was two thick fingers of tawny head that slowly fell like an aging heavyweight who just got tagged on the chin by an up and coming opponent. What remained was soft and creamy, like soft serve ice cream. Nose was maltier than the other two offerings this evening, making for a nice change of pace. Color was a deep-copper (SRM = > 17, < 22) with NE-quality clarity. Mouthfeel was medium and this one struck a nice balance between the "organic pumpkin", the "organic spices" and the "barley malt", giving it a light spiciness, but not overwhelming the malty sweetness that acted as the beer's backbone. I get it. I am an American and we like things that are overamped, but this was a striking contrast to the spice rack receptacles from earlier in the evening. With them, one each was plenty. In this one, the finish was pleasantly semi-dry and not harsh in terms of its inherent spiciness. I would not want a full day of it, but at least I felt like I could drink more than just one. I may lay in a couple/few more for the upcoming holidays.","woodychandler","Oct 10, 2013"

Many of the bottles have images of Jack o' lanterns, owls, headless horsemen, and other ghoulish figures associated with Halloween. This beer just screams "harvest" more than anything. Like I said, it seems "traditional" in a way. Even the bottle art is plain and simple. Try this if you get a chance. If anything it is very different.

Like the inside of a real raw pumpkin. Authentic! Also, taking a back seat, the slew of usual spices such as cinnamon and nutmeg. The flavor is quite close to the aroma, and in this case, it's a beautiful thing. This is a clean tasting real pumpkin beer. Not too over the top and also it still tastes like a beer, with light hops and biscuity malt identifiable in the taste. This tastes remarkably full and coats the mouth great for only a 4% alcohol beer. The flavor lingers nicely in the finish as well.

It remains earthy and tied to the season with it's characteristics but mild enough to entice someone unsure of a "pumpkin beer" while also maintaining enough pumpkin and spice to keep pumpkin beer veterans coming back for another without the complaint it's too thin or watered down.

I caught a distinct smell of pumpkin with hints of cinnamon and nutmeg. The taste of this one is one of the better pumpkin beers I have had in a long time. It does have a sweeter taste than most from the spices incorporated through out the brewing process. This is definitely not a sour ale. The beer does feel smooth and the bitters do not really come out hence 10 IBUs.

A touch of spicy, tangy, hop toward the end. Finishes with a long lasting spiciness. This was a bit of a buzz kill.

The lacing is better than average. Very sticky. On the nose, straight up the meat of a pumpkin pie. Not the browned top, caramely part, but the middle of the pie, the moist part. Cinnamon, nutmeg and gord smell are prevalent. A light sweetness. On the palate, it's Thanksgiving, with bubbles. Light pumpkin flavor up front, spices round out the middle (mostly cinnamon and nutmeg like the nose) and a mild hop bitterness to round things out. Maybe a little thin on the mouth, and overly carbonated, but you gotta work around the 4% abv. Lots of flavor packed into this little guy. In the upper tier of pumpkin beers for me.","WestValleyIPA","Nov 01, 2011"

The liquid presents a pretty orange bronze color with a brown tint, moderate transparency and only a few visible bubble beads. The nose features much more spice than outright pumpkin, loads of cinnamon and ginger scents as well as flowers and lemon peel, has a brisk and penetrating feel to it, cleansing presence in your nostrils. Medium-bodied with a fizzy, if clipped, carbonation which stirs things up during the mouth entry. Here the pumpkin comes through much clearer along with a vanilla to whipped cream aspect. This not to diminish the sharp spices, no denying them from start to aftertaste. The white citrus larger while there’s also bread crust and straw notes, more “hoppier” than “hoppy” per se.

This beer was served at about 55-60 deg. F. which is somewhat warmer than I usually drink my beers. This may be part of the reason the head and lacing were so impressive.

The taste brings in more of the same, along with some buttery toffee and toasted pumpkin seeds. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a nearly creamy feel.

3.88,16.2,4,3.5,4,4,4," From the start the pour is standard into a Sam Adam's glass(I'm from Boston, what can I say) with an orange glow and a good lasting head if poured right. Proper lacing covers the glass as you drink. The smell is very authentic pumpkin, the same as when you cut open one to carve, and that's the best your going to get with my stuffy nose. Taste is very different that you might expect. I did not like this the first few mouthfuls, but after drinking the hole thing its a very real, maybe closest to real pumpkin without many spices added as any pumpkin beer this season. The taste is smooth, nothing sticks out to much besides the real pumpkin flavor. I would suggest folks buy this beer and drink it with the understanding that it is going to be different than most but in its own style it is a very good pumpkin beer. Would I buy again, YES.

Taste is right on with very little spice, sweetness or hops; its all toasted pumpkin. The reality is that pumpkin has a very mild flavor, and this is as close as it gets. Other pumpkin ales seem to try to achieve a pumpkin pie flavor in a beer by adding to much spices. To me this ale strives to complement pumpkin pie instead of mimicry.

3.59,7.5,3.5,4.5,3,3,4,"EDIT: The 2010 version is actually better. A solid malt character comes through, spices aren't too potent, and it's still insanely drinkable. Now I'd say it's highly recommended.","Domingo","Jan 28, 2009"

2.57,-23.1,3,3.5,2,2.5,2.5,"Pours light brown, rather clear, a short bubbly head that quickly dissipates, with no lacing whatsoever. Nose is very cinnamon up front, with some background sweets. Taste is also quite spicy in the beginning, but it gradually dissipates into a light cinnamon and light sweet flavor. There is no pumpkin that I can detect. Goes down easy at first, but then becomes rather thin and flat. Doesn't hold up as I would expect.","aquatonex","Nov 02, 2008"
3.82,14.4,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Bottle bought at Smith's. Pours a clear amber color with a small off-white head. The aroma is very nice; sweet pumpkin notes, some toasted malts, some spices, cinnamon and cloves mostly. The taste is nice and relaxed; a full pumpkin flavor that is not overwhelming and mixes almost totally into the malt profile to create a nice smooth and toasted flavor. Some spices come to the fore and the finish is sweet and smooth. As usual, Uinta makes quality beers. A easy and quaffable drink, but also well crafted and tasty.","Douglas88","Nov 01, 2008"
3,-10.2,3,3,3,3,3,"Got one of these off a friend. The alternatives weren't too great, but I might have been better off with a Yuengling. Overall, this is just not that interesting. Just a weak aroma and flavor of slight nutmeg and pumpkin spiciness, but nothing much else here to keep my interest. Much better off to go with something like DFH Punkin or Southern Tier Pumking, the two top beers in this style, in my opinion.","soupyman10","Oct 20, 2008"
2.5,-25.1,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,"From a brown 12oz bottle - Pours a fairly clear reddish/orange with a slight head and very low carbonation. Smells of sweet species, nutmeg, cloves leading the way, with mild hop presence. First sip is sweet but too sweet. The spice are mellow but there is nothing to write home about. Finishes slightly bitter. Decent mouthfeel that is under carbonated.","ATLbeerDog","Oct 18, 2008"
3.32,-0.6,3,3.5,3,3,4," Session worthy due to low ABV,not due to taste.Taste was not awful,just a bit light on character.","Lexluthor33","Oct 17, 2008"

3.18,-4.8,4,3.5,3,3,3,"Pours a clear brilliant amber with 2 fingers of foamy eggshell colored head. Good retention and some wisps of lacing. Smells of cinnamon, nutmeg, bread, and light pumpkin. Tastes of light floral hops up front then cinnamon and nutmeg. Lots of grain and honey malt follow, with not much happening in the finish besides grain. Light in body and high in carbonation. Thin but some crispness. Grainy with some spices, but not one of the better pumpkin ales out there.","HopDerek","Oct 08, 2008"
3.95,18.3,4,4,4,3.5,4,"D. Less spiced than I usually like but a good beer all around. more like a well done pale ale with pumpkin and a minor dose of spice.","sleazo","Oct 06, 2008"
3.34,0,3,4,3,3,3.5,"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into my Dogfish Head shaker glass. Appears a clear golden amber color with about half an inch of off-white foam that disappears in under 30 seconds. This one actually smells and tastes of roasted pumpkins, somewhat rare in pumpkin beers, which are usually dominated with spices. There are notes of allspice, nutmeg and bready yeast in the nose, but they are lost in the taste. All I'm getting in the flavor dept. are pumpkin and metallics. A notch below medium in both body and carbonation. This one went down easy enough, but I'd limit this to a bottle a year if I had an empty slot to fill in my mix-n-match six pack. Although, it is a nice alternative to all the high abv pumpkin ales that seem to be hitting the shelf in the past few years.","ClockworkOrange","Oct 05, 2008"
3.85,15.3,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"You know, this is really quite a nice beer. Nice low abv for a change of pace and subtly spiced while allowing the pumpkin to shine through. Tastes fresh as well. Pours orange toward the darker end of the spectrum, but with a fairly light head. What is there sticks around as a thin ring. Light aroma of roasted pumpkin, and even lighter aroma of mace. Subdued, but pleasant. The taste is also nice and pumpkiny with some subdued but noticeable maxe and cinammon as well as a perhaps the barest amount of vanilla. Very smooth, and the earthy vegetal pumpkin shines through the most. Almost nutty. Full flavored and very smooth, but with just enough spice bite to keep it flavorful. This is the way to do a low abv beer. Very enjoyable. My wife and I enjoyed a sixpack of these.","Georgiabeer","Oct 04, 2008"
3.68,10.2,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Mostly clear deep pumpkin orange with coppery edges. Small, persistent, lacy, creamy, light khaki head. Caramel cookie dough, light molasses, hints of baking spices, some pumpkin pie batter, and a little metal. Toasted malt and astringent grain up front. Caramel and cookie malt follow. Subtle sweetness. Pumpkin pie and baking spices gently drift in. Spicy hop presence in the finish. Not bad. Moderate body with a creamy feel. A rather mild, malty pumpkin ale, that goes easy on the spices, and is therefore more drinkable.","alexgash","Oct 02, 2008"

2.18,-34.7,3,2.5,2,2,2,"Drinkability: I wasted money on a six-pack I'd never heard of.

I've had worse, but this one's not worth your time.","UGADawgGuy","Sep 22, 2008"
2.82,-15.6,4,2,3,3,3,"Pours a reddish golden color. Low lying white head with no head retention. Great clarity, my guess is filtered which could be causing the lack of pumpkin flavor. Cinnamon, clove, and some slight vegetal (good) in the flavor. The mouthfeel is a bit lacking as it is thin but somehow is cloying at the end. This beer being from salt lake, I can't be over 4%abv so props to the brewers for making a decent brew with those kind of restrictions. Can it be that this recipe would send you singing if they didn't have the State of Utah overseeing their procedures? I would hope so, but as is, it's not giving me a reason to warm up my voice.","brewjones","Sep 20, 2008"

3,-10.2,3.5,3.5,2.5,2.5,3.5,"Pours a clear copper color with a decent dense white head that dissipated into a sparse cap. The aroma is light brown sugar, nutmeg, cinnamon, and allspice. Noticable pumpkin ale aromas. Wow, the taste falls flat. The flavor is of watery grain with some light pumpkin spice flavors, thats about it. The feel is light with moderate carbonation. It has that light macro astrigent feel. A beginners pumpkin ale. It has the very basic flavor yet it still resembles a light macro lager. I prefer my pumpkin ales much maltier with more robust flavor.","Gmann","Beers"
2.78,-16.8,3.5,3,3,1.5,2.5,"Wasn't terribly impressed with this one. I didn't hate it by any means, but there's nothing to love here either. Bland. Uninspired. Too simple.
