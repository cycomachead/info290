Sadly I tasted neither. All I tasted was a bitter ale with no flavors of squash or spices. So given this I am disappointed. I purchased a 6 pack and am stuck with 5 more bottles. That's the bad news. The good news is it did leave me a good aftertaste. Sometimes I'll have a flavorful drink and then 1/2 hour later the aftertaste spoils it.","Kiwi_Bird","Nov 16, 2014"

The requisite amount of nostalgia-inducing spices, but incredibly drinkable; in part due to its uncharacteristic hop presence.

The flavor is also a bit more mild in the pumpkin spice, with a little more bitterness than other pumpkin beers, though more like an under ripe fruit or herbal tea bitterness. The flavor reminds me of freshly raked leaves. Not as pumpkin heavy as other pumpkin beers, but it’s still there, and the beer itself seems better crafted than most.

I disliked anything but cloves and smoked a lot of them with early girlfriends, many of whom I have not thought of until now. They were all always black-clad, tough-talking and great teachers. I learned a lot from them and I regret none of it. It's only kinky the first time. Mouthfeel was medium and the clove/cinnamon presence was unrelenting. Phew! I am feeling pretty festive after today. I walked away from this for a moment to allow the spices to sink in, but coming back to it, I was still overwhelmed by the spices.

Pours moderately hazy bright orange amber color with a 2 finger dense off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of big pumpkin, clove, cinnamon, nutmeg, gingerbread, toast, floral, and herbal. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of spice, pumpkin, and malt notes; with good strength. Taste of pumpkin, toast, cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, gingerbread, floral, light pine, and herbal earthiness. Light bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of pumpkin, toast, cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, gingerbread, and floral on the finish for a good bit. Nice balance and complexity of malt, pumpkin, and spice flavors; with solid robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and moderately crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very good pumpkin ale. Good balance of malt and spice flavors; and very smooth to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Sep 19, 2013"

Many taste very similar and the pumpkin seems thrown in there without much concern for how it will work with the other flavors. This beer is different. The appearance is nice, with a short/medium head that leaves great lacing. The smell is not as sweet and bold as many other pumpkin ales, and there's no hint of alcohol. The taste is nicely balanced, with more hops than what I'm used to in a pumpkin ale, a little less pumpkin, and a little more spice (cinnamon, nutmeg), giving it a spicy taste with a finish that's actually more dry than sweet. The mouthfeel is on the thin side but all of the flavors are captured nicely, and it goes down smooth. Overall, this is one of the better pumpkin ales in my opinion because of its great balance.","DeFaz","Sep 03, 2013"

The flavor is a little tart but sweet with brown sugar and flavored with pie spices. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a slick spicy tart mouthfeel. Its a pumpkin beer, a bit too light in body and sweetness for my tastes.","johnnnniee","Sep 02, 2013"

Aroma is vibrant, smelling of pumpkin spices, especially cinnamon, and pumpkin, along with some trace hop fragrance. Bright hop flavor is surprisingly dominant up front in spite of its meager presence in the nose. The pumpkin spices appear to clash with the bitterness of the hops, and the disharmony is distracting. There is also a wheat-like funkiness on the back end that I don't particularly care for. The carbonation is a little on the high side but still manages to facilitate a smooth and creamy mouthfeel. That, however, is not enough to offset the detractors in the flavor department. I was expecting better from Smuttynose, but I feel they missed the mark a bit with this one.","MaximalC","Nov 26, 2012"

Grainy, bready malt is apparent in the aroma and taste and earthy, floral hops are certainly apparent at the finish of the taste and mouthfeel.

"Pumpkin puree and spices," as indicated by the label, come through clearly in a sweet and biscuity malt aroma. The right amount of sweetness and earthy hops seem to balance along nicely with the veggie pumpkin taste. Pumpkin seems to be given the fair attention here that it deserves and is clearly the star of this show with the generous yet reserved typical cast of supporting Fall ingredients.","albertjr21","Jan 08, 2012"

Light, enticing aromas of pumpkin, nutmeg, and cinnamon, with an overall roasted quality. The beer has a light, slick cling on the glass that slides down with the level of the brew while you drink. Flavors are a bit more on the roasted side initially, with some tangy and sweet character blended through the pumpkin profiles. The spicing is much lighter than the aromas would lead you to believe would be present. The beer's body is much lighter than most other brews in this style. A slight hopping seems out of place at the end of the palate, causing a sharp drying and crisping feel at the end of the brew.","GarthDanielson","Dec 19, 2011"

The hops are there in the taste too, with fresh pumpkin and some malt. Medium body, not too much carbonation.

I noticed that the on-tap version had a bit stronger aroma of pumpkin than the bottled variety. Hops are also noticeable in the nose, which is unusual (but not at all disturbing) for a pumpkin ale. There is also plenty of hop goodness in the taste as well. Those who dislike extremely spicy pumpkin ales will be happy to know that this certainly does NOT occur with this beer. In fact, the shortage of pie spice may be the only thing this pumpkin offering is lacking - IMHO. The clean and bitter hop finish is also somewhat odd for the style, but it simply works here.

Smell- fall flavors in a glass. nutmeg, pumpkin, some winter spices, cinnamon is very strong. Taste- orange peel, nutmeg, pumpkin, nice hop bitterness, cinnamon (almost like actual cinnamon is on my tongue). Very balanced.

4.08,11.2,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Sampled from a bottle – best by December 2011. Dirty copper orange in color with a deep haze. Poured with a respectable fluffy off-white foam with decent staying power. Foam slowly reduced to a thick cap that left sheets of sticky lacings on the glass. A nice combination of aromas that included sweet pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg and a touch of clove. Medium bodied with a delicate feel despite the assertive carbonation. Spicy clove flavor is dominant from beginning to end with pumpkin flavor beneath. Cinnamon and nutmeg flavors peak through toward the middle with floral hoppiness sneaking in toward the finish. Finishes dry with a combination spicy and floral hop bitterness. Flavors and aromas were more delicate than most pumpkins I’ve tried. This is probably the most hop character I’ve also tasted in a pumpkin before.","IronLover","Sep 26, 2011"

It has a very inviting aroma of brown sugar, cinnamon, & graham cracker. The flavor begins with pumpkin and toast for a second before the hop profile takes over. I had this most recently alongside 3 other pumpkin ales, and I learned that rather than being able to 'stack rank' them, I found each was good in a certain situation. If you're not in the mood for a literally a pumpkin pie dessert in a glass, this is definitely the pumpkin ale for you. It's more like drinking an APA with a pumpkin influence on the flavor rather than the other way around. It's so smooth - not boozy or syrupy like many others as well. This will be my go-to everyday pumpkin ale for fall seasons to come.","Neorebel","Sep 25, 2011"

Nose is more spice than most pumpkin ales. In fact, it might be a little too much nutmeg. Not very balanced at all. I'd like a little more balance and pumpkin in the nose. Taste is the same thing. Too much nutmeg, and not enough malt, pumpkin, etc.... In my opinion, this beer is a shadow of my favorite pumpkin ale, by Weyerbacher. Feel is very carbonated, and fairly thin.

I immediately thought i bought a bad batch but the Best before date was Dec 2011. Seems like this beer tries to be a pumpkin ale and an IPA but doesnt get either right.

The nose comprises orange peel, cinnamon, nutmeg, caramel, light balsa, and a decent touch of minty pine. The taste holds notes of sharp pine, orange peel, light cinnamon, banana peel, greens, and pumpkin shell. Things are just a tad too bitter for this combination to actually work... The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slick feel.

Hopping is more aggressive than most pumpkin beers, but that's neither good nor bad given the fleeting pumpkin flavor. Finish is drying and powdery with a lot of pie spice hanging around.

They actually lend a little bit of a bite to an ale that I surely thought was going to be too sweet. This beer actually goes hops and caramel malts for a few seconds, followed by a wave of pumpkin, cinnamon, and even a hint of ginger that all create an extremely long finish full of seasonal goodness. A hit of biscuit is in there as well, balancing all the flavors. Here's a pumpkin ale that actually drinks like an ale, not a flavored malt beverage, and I appreciate that. Its not real heavy on those flavors, but its still very distinct from a normal ale, and very enjoyable. Its a tad bit too carbonated however, making the mouthfeel less creamy than I think it could stand to be. All in all, good beer and a fine example of a pumpkin ale.","chodinheaven","Sep 13, 2011"

Cinnamon and spice with a slight pumpkin taste, followed by just too much hop bitterness and a bit of a metallic twinge. Pumpkin ales are a style that I think should not be subtle at all. If I'm in the mood for pumpkin pie on an autumn evening, that's what I want, and in good, obvious quantities. Medium body, and fairly drinkable, but not if there are other/better pumpkin ales available. DFH or Weyerbacher, for example.","Rifugium","Sep 12, 2011"

In the mouth the spices fade considerably - unfortunately - leaving a heavy malt presence and a flat, boring pumpkin taste that is only piqued with the occasional splash of lemon that comes through.

Unlike the former, this beer didn't leave my mouth feeling a little (for lack of a better word) muddy. However, this beer was slightly more on the bitter side than some people would prefer.

This ale has a much more natural pumpkin taste devoid of any artificial spice taste. There is faint hints of nutmeg and cinnamon, though it is not a focus for this beer.

The pumpkin has a well crafted blend of nutmeg and cinnamon. A light sweet malt folds in around the edges and melds into the light lovely hops. Taste is one of if not the best of this style I've had. Pale ale malt backbone with the excellent pumpkin blend from the nose. Just enough of them to set it apart as flavored, but not so much that you are looking for the "ale" in your glass. Hops start earthy, moving toward bright and citrusy with a distinct grapefruit skin edge in the finish. A lingering malt graininess and gentle floral hoppiness with a short clean dryness. Just super. Feel is finely effervescent, with a light tingly sensation and light touch on the tongue. Very drinkable and refreshing. This is a top drawer Thanksgiving beverage as well as an all around fall thirst quencher. My new favorite for the football grilling.","scootny","Oct 02, 2010"

Taste is pretty much like the aroma, with the pumpkin flavor being the strongest. Pumpkin spice, bready malt and hoppy flavors are noticable too. There's also a slight bitter finish. I don't think this is as spicy as a lot of the pumpkin brews I've tried before. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, with decent carbonation. Drinkability is OK, it's easy enough to drink.

Smells of pumpkin and squash with spicy perfumed accents, enticing and delightful. Taste and body, on the other hand, were very heavy and conjured up thoughts of root crops, autumn veggies, sweet potato with heavy malt contributions. This beer struck me as a heavyweight for the style with very dense body and flavour that surprized and overpowered. Aggressively spiced but not in the traditional nutmeg and cinnamon direction but with more ginger and a host of other spiced elements that made it almost impossible to pick out the nuances, a rather complicated (to me) mix. With warming, a bit more bitterness was a welcome contribution.

I always really liked this brewery so when I saw a 6 pack of this in the store I did not hesitate to spend the last of my cash on it. This brew poured a cloudy golden color with a very small head that dissipated quickly. The aroma is spicy and dominated by cinnamon, brown sugar, and malt. This brew is very flavorful compared to others of this type. There is a light carbonation which I think is perfect for this particular beer. There is also a bit of hop bitterness in the background which I don't really notice in other pumpkin ales. I would say, other than dogfish head's punkin' ale, this would be one of the most flavorful and spicy pumpkin ales I have had yet. Very good beer and very drinkable.

Taste is fabulously delightful with a finely delicate array of spices over a light bready malt. Warming, soothing, and well spiced. Nothing jumps out at ya really, its a great medley of nutmeg, cinnamon, brown sugar, and pumpkin. Lovely finish of lightly sweet malt that has a nice smooth grab and a very slight return of warming spices tingle across the palate late. Smooth, clean, spicy, without all the spice grab, good malt presence, medium body, good finisher. Swell drinker too. Floats right down and keeps a nice warming tone of spice, like a freshly baked cookie.","Anthony1","Oct 15, 2009"

This beer is just a mess of overdone spices that makes it really hard to session. For the money, it's not a bad choice at $7.99 a 6 pack, but if you want quality over quantity, go with a 4 pack of DFH Pumpkin Ale for less spiciness, more pronounced malt and pumpkin flavors and a higher ABV. I even enjoyed Southampton's offering alot more then this. A subpar pumpkin ale and pretty forgettable in my book.","thespaceman","Oct 15, 2009"

Smells of mellow pumpkin pie spices, a bit of cream, and some earthy hops. The taste is nice, more ssubtle than many pumpkin beers and not nearly as sweet either. The light pumpkin and spice is up front followed by a growing earth and pine hop presence. Mouthfeel is fairly mellow- slightly spicy and medium bodied but relatively smooth. Definitely a bit different- more like a pumpkin IPA or strongly hopped pumpkin ESB.","Georgiabeer","Oct 14, 2009"

3.8,3.5,4,4,4,4,3,"Final thoughts: This starts as a really good beer. Has lots of crisp clean goodness and some light toasty pumpkin flavors, juicy fruits, and even finishes with a nice hop bitterness. But, then spices build and build and build, and that's just in the first sip. Aside from that it's a pretty good beer and I recommend giving it a try.

Smells of a baked good, pumpkins, cinnamon, some sweets, malts and nutmeg. Pretty standard aromas but a good balance with a decently strong nose. Tastes of pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg, malts and some hoppy bitterness. Alcohol becomes a tiny bit present as I progress with this one. Mouthfeel is light-medium with some creamyness, good carbonation and a bit of alcohol warming as I get farther into the beer. Leaves a good coat of malts and pumpkin on the tongue. Drinkability is pretty good, the beer itself tastes good, but I can feel it diminishing as I finish it up, some alcohol is shining through and taking over. Pumpkin beer themselves seem to fade to pure spices toward the end and it's overpowering. The price was not bad for this one and I'm not sure if I'll get it again, really like Will Stevens at this point for pumpkin.","cbutova","Oct 10, 2009"

Just the perfect blend of pumpkin flavor and spices, the perfect pillowey, fluffy head, with sticky pumpkin lacing. Not too this and not too that...the perfect balance in a pumpkin ale.

As it gradually warms, so to do the spices more gradually come out. A well carbonated beer, lending it to a nice full mouthful. Low ABV and the low bitterness level make it very drinkable if the pumpkin style is your thing, but for me, I don't think it is. I'm not a big fan of overspicing, but I think this one could actually use a little more.

It isn't sweet and the spiciness is not overwhelming. Some other pumpkin ales are very spice-heavy. That isn't bad and can be great if its what you want. This doesn't have that ginger-nutmeg flavor bomb. And it works. It's really drinkable and pairs well with food. The moutfeel is smooth and a tad bit thin, to be honest, but it is far from watery.

The flavors were at first all spices but after that faded the pumpkin and malt flavors came through. The finish was bitter when the hops finally showed up. The body was medium and the carbonation moderate. Though one has to like pumpkin for this to apply, if you do I have to recommend this as a very drinkable beer that stands as one of the best of its kind.

What makes it the best is it's perfect combination of taste and drinkability. It has everything that you look for flavor-wise: cinnamon, pumpkin pie, brown sugar.

It smelt spicy and the taste proved the smell right. Cloves, cloves, and more cloves. I had to ask my wife what the spice in ham glaze was because it was all over this beer. The spice is just too much in my opinion...unless you love ham glaze. There is also an astrignecy in the aftertaste as well that is unpleasant. There are plenty better options out there.

Taste is a leaf like pumpkin spice with some dirt flavors. A good hop bite leaves a nice dry mouthfeel towards the end. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation.

Pouring a pumpkin-like orange amber color, a lighter colored iteration of this style; I was not discontented whatsoever initially. The nose of this brew is reminicent of wallpaper paste, resulting in an instant olfactory equation to one of the miserable beers from Saranac Brewery Ive tasted in the past. Additional aromas of green bell pepper, boiled veggies (not necessarily pumpkin) and a touch of cinnamon and clove are present. Like other Smuttynose products I have tasted, there is an abundant supply of hops in attendance here, somewhat overstated especially for a seasonal style such as this. Nevertheless, this is a signature expression for many of their brews. This beer drinks fairly well, as the lean and dry version of the style lends itself to stress free quaffing. A bit of a deviation from the core of the style, I would like more of the warm spice notes that are present in the best versions of the style.","barknee","Oct 04, 2007"

It has all of the qualities of a great beer; it's malty and a bit hoppily bitter at the end, unlike many other pumpkin ales, on top of just the right amount of spices. It is as good as my mother's pumpkin pie. The appearance is exactly as you should expect, bright, clear, reddish-brown in hue. The carbonation perfectly enhances the flavors and allows for an excellent smoothness. I could drink this beer all year (and almost have except my supplies ran out) but it's the best on a cool autumn evening.

Head diminished on the slow side, and did manage to leave a little lace behind on the glass. Lots of spice in the nose. Cloves, ginger, nutmeg, some pumpkin, and brown sugar were present. Not quite pumpkin pie but not too bad. The ginger and nutmeg aromas seemed to dominate the nose. The ginger, nutmeg, cloves and brown sugar also made themselves present in the flavor. The pumpkin flavor was very faint in my opinion. Almost not noticeable under the layers of spice. The mouthfeel was a bit on the thin side. Plenty of carbonation left a small burn on the tongue.

I could easily make this a session beer.","tmp155","Jul 30, 2007"

Aroma is gentle with distinct spices, some pumpkin aroma detected, and definitely a hop presence. Lots going on here, and it peaks the curiosity, but nothing making me want to down it instantly, either. Taste is rather hoppy surprisingly--citrusy, a hoppy pale ale, but with a faint and fleeting burst of pumpkin flavor in the finish. The hops linger, as does a bit of the pumpkin flavor. The spices are much more in the aroma than taste, actually. Mouthfeel is medium bodied but rather weighty on the tongue, and not really overly carbonated, but high amounts of it--at least for me; points for the heft. Drinkability - there is a substanial beer lurking beneath the pumpkin going on here, and a hoppy one at that. It's a twist on a hoppier pale ale, but the pumkin is just too subtle for me. When the carbonation faded, it was a bit more noticable, but still faint. Smutty seems to love seriously hoppy beer, so this fits their style. I would have, best of all worlds, enjoyed a slightly less hoppy drinker that overdid it with the pumkins, in comparison. Drinkable, and a good fall variation if you like smutty beers and want a seasonal that keep the smutty beer profile but add a little twist.","Liquids","Sep 25, 2006"

Aroma was citrus, faint cinnamon, pumpkin and allspice -- very pleasant. Flavor was mild hops at the front (citrus), with a stronger bite at the finish. Pumpkin flavor came up in the middle, spices in the aftertaste, and the pumpkin seemed to be stronger than the spice. The malt was quite mild, a honey wheat bread. Finally, there was something almost Belgian about the beer (funky yeast), that I couldn't really put my finger on. The beer was light in body, medium in carbonation, and slightly drying.

4,9,4,4,4,4,4,"A vigorous pour yields a giant dusky-white head, dense and pock-marked atop a glowing orange-amber with a slight haze and slow, steady carbonation. Bready malt aromas form the foundation for some leafy-spicy hop notes and, of course, the pie spices (mostly cinnamon and allspice, with a bit of maple sweetness at the end). Sweet cinnamon traces emerge at first in the taste and are immediately followed by a mellow piney bitterness of hops mixed with the peppery sharpness of Jamaican allspice. All of this is undergirded by a caramelly malt base that does, indeed, yield some substantial fruit character which must be the pumpkin. I didn't drink this with my dinner tonight, but it would have paired quite nicely with it (acorn squash baked in apple juice and cinnamon and filled with brown rice and barley hijiki pilaf with adzuki bean soup and boiled collard greens). Smooth and creamy mouthfeel, dry finish from the bitterness of hops and spices. I don't feel drawn to Pumpkin ales very often (not even in the fall), but Smuttynose has yet to really let me down. This is not cloying in any way; in fact, it's incredibly balanced and rather palatable overall.

The beer pours a hazy amber orange with a thinnish white head. Rocky foam forms a ring while fine bubbles capped the beer. Lacing is spotty, but generous. Awesome aroma with a fruitiness reminiscent of fresh pumpkin pulp - like when pulling it out of the pumpkin when carving a jack-o-lantern. The spices are balanced nicely, with notes of cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice. There's more bitterness here than I expected, solid all the way to the end. Malt sweetness fills out the middle along with a light fruitiness and the pumpkin spices. Spice and bitterness linger a bit. As it warms there's a hint of toastiness too - with the pumpkin flavour present it's almost like roasted pumpkin seeds. Medium bodied with a dry finish and a slight slickness. An excellent pumpkin ale and one of the best that I've had.

3.97,8.2,4,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Smuttynose Pumpkin ale delivers a bright waft of pumpkin spice that says "get out your jacket and pumpkin carving knife because fall is here"! It pours a hazy deep golden amber body with an orange cast beneath a short head of white froth. The head retention is very good, and it leaves some nice spider webs of lace about the glass. The body is medium and it's gently zesty with a very fine-bubbled, median carbonation. The spice is nicely balanced, showing clearly at the outset and across the middle, but settling into the background during a long finish. The biscuity malt base beneath supports it well; and only a mild bitterness is needed. Overall, it's really well done for a pumpkin ale, although I think its drinkability still suffers due to the spicing...

There's also malts and notes of pumpkin, nutmeg, cloves, and a touch of cinnamon in the background. The accumulated spices in the last sip numb my mouth a bit.

This one pours a very hazy peach with tiny floaties. Nutmeg, cream and pumpkin pie in the nose. Unlike some of its less-than-tasty brethren, this one lacks artificial sweetness to balance the spice, and uses a thick malt backbone instead. Spices is soft and certainly not overdone; its much more apparent at the start as the finish is mildly bitter and finishes chewy, malty and dry. I'd like a bit more spice throughout, but that's about my only "complaint." Medium bodied, light on the booze and carbonation, and one I'd certainly love to pair with some pumpkin pie.

I must say that out of the many pumpkin ales I have had ( albeit i've not reviewed many), this one really does have the pumpking flavor and vibe going. Very nice.

A good, very slightly sweet, bready, medium-big bodied ale with rounded flavors. Just the right amount of the twangy rotund orange fruit. My palate is not too good with the spices, but it seems like a decent amount of cinnamon in here. Could be nutmeg. I guess I need a culinary course or two.

3.37,-8.2,3.5,4,3,3,3.5,"i was hoping for and expecting a bit more from this one. not bad overall, but missing something. it pours a bright yet slightly couded orange colour with a sticky but tiny head. the smell is nice, if muted. pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg, pinecone and dirt dominate a well rounded smell. the flavour is simply average. it's not as bold as the smell (though it mixes in the same things) and has a touch of a metallic base to it, setting the overall flavour off a bit all around. that said, the cinnamon finish is nice. i'd knock the carbonation down a touch as well as it tends to take away from the flavour here. again, not bad, but needs some tweaking.","SixpointJMH","Sep 10, 2004"
4.34,18.3,4,5,4,4,4.5,"The taste is no different - very pleasing to the palate as all parts are hit - pumpkin for the front, hops for the back in equal amounts (a very well balanced combination). Mouthfeel is medium to light, which is appropriate for an ale of this type. Drinkability is very good - an excellent autumn beverage as intended.","stingo","Sep 09, 2004"
4.08,11.2,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Smuttynose has quickly become one of my favorite regional breweries. I find their beer to be above the average in quality across all their products. I was excited to see the Pumpkin Ale available in stores, and bought a 6 to drink and rate. The beer poured a mildly hazy pumpkin orange/copper. It had a slight had, and just a touch of lace. The nose is mildly pumpkin, but more on the cinnamon and nutmeg. It really does remind one of pumpkin pie. As with many pumpkins, the spice is in the forefront of the beer. Pumpkin does come through mid-way through the drink. It has a nice balance of the fruit, spice and malt. Great medium mouth feel and crispness lend to a high drinkability. I cant usually drink many pumpkin ales, but this one is different enough to warrant 1 or 2 more.","carln26","Sep 06, 2004"

3.7,0.8,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"The beer pours a nice orange/dark gold color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a mild pumpkin scent that boasts of some ginger and cinnamon. The taste is decent. It is a smooth tasting brew with a good pumpkin punch that lingers in the aftertaste. The ginger sticks out as well as some hops in the background. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good drinking pumpkin ale if there is such a thing. It is smooth drinking and good tasting.","WesWes","Aug 23, 2004"
4.1,11.7,4,4,4,4,4.5,"I trust my palate, and I am certain this is brewed with some, if not massive amounts of ginger. The earthy pumpkin is in the background, as are some of the traditional spices like nutmeg, but the dominant taste here is ginger. It is aggressive up front, like homebrewed ginger ale, then is rounded out by a biscuity maltiness and ever so delicate hops characteristics. Then, on the aftertaste, the ginger comes back, and the end result is actually quite refreshing. This may be one of the few pumpkin beers I've had that I could drink a few of in one sitting.","bultrey","Aug 23, 2004"
3.02,-17.7,3.5,4,2.5,3.5,2.5,"Its a hazy, light pumpkin-orange in color, with a thin white head. The aroma is spicy -- like nutmeg/pumpkin -- the aroma of a pumpkin pie in the oven. I enjoyed the mouthfeel, somewhat thick and syrupy without being overpowering, but the flavor didn't do it for me. The pumpkin flavor was lost in a hop bitterness that didn't match the aroma at all, with a very dry finish. The pumpkin would reappear in the aftertaste, but I found little reason to have another.","jtfest","Apr 05, 2004"
3.75,2.2,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"It is a dark orange in color. The aromas are of pumpkin and cinnamon almost like a freshly baked pumpkin pie. The malty body was complemented well with a spiced finish.

3.8,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,4,"There is a slightly orange color to the beer. Also just a but hazy. The nose is fairly reminiscent of a pumpkin pie. The taste has a pretty good IPA type beer in the background, but the spices are just a bit overdone. Cut back on them a hair and they will have a fine pumpkin beer. Still, it is pretty good. Definitely an acquired taste!","Boto","Nov 29, 2003"

3.7,0.8,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,"Other: Probably the best food/beer pairing of the night. We had a pumpkin and ginger soup that was very creamy. The beer managed to both complement and contrast the food at the same time. The spices of both complemented, but the hops of the beer cleansed the palate and provided great contrast so that you didn't get bogged down by all that creamy goodness.","ManekiNeko","Nov 13, 2003"

Sure, it smelled great, looked great, and felt pretty good in the mouth, but other than that, it was very disappointing. It had a very strange taste that left a horrible aftertaste. It had good body to it, but the taste was just too funky. I thought it was rather rich in the "funky" taste and I couldn't finish it.","JISurfer","Oct 29, 2003"
4.18,13.9,4,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"I really liked this one. This beer poured out a slightly cloudy golden orange color with a thinnish and short lasting head. Theres a unique smell here  I cant detect a distinctive pumpkin aroma, but it is vegetal, along with a pleasing spiciness with sweet lemon grass. The taste is earthy and hearty. A spicy and light malt body with a touch of sweetness. This beer isnt oily or buttery, but finishes clean and dry. Refreshing and flavorful, not overdone, a quality seasonal ale.","pezoids","Oct 28, 2003"
3.44,-6.3,3,4,3.5,3,3,"Clear orange color. Just a little haze to it. Small head that fades quickly. Spice dominates the smell.

4.26,16.1,3,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Pours a dark-orange color with serious cloudiness and a slight head. The aroma is fanastic...it's similar to a fresh pumpkin bread. Unlike a lot of other pumpkin beers, this one doens't seem to rely on pumpkin-pie spices to acquire it's flavor. Instead, it's a doughy, malty, vegtable-pumpkin taste. Slightly sweet, mildly spiced....outstanding. This is exactly what I look for in a pumpkin beer.","Suds","Oct 19, 2003"
4.22,15,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"It pours a hazy goldish amber with a nice off-white head and some trails and webs of sticky lace. The aroma is of pumpkin pie...with beer. A sweet biscuity malty mixes well with mellow pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla. A mild lemony citrus offers a nice balance to the malt and spices. A faint flavor reminiscent of eggnog and rum come to mind. It really goes down easy and was gone before I had the chance to appropriately conclude this review. Yum!","BeerResearcher","Oct 15, 2003"
4.1,11.7,4,4,4,4,4.5,"This pumpkin beer poured a hazy, honey gold color with white foam that settled but clung to the glass a bit. The smell was of pumpkin pie spices (nutmeg, allspice, cinnamon), pumpkin, malt and hops. The taste was of pumpkin and spices (nutmeg, cinnamon), malt, some oak, and hops in the finish and aftertaste. The flavors were nicely balanced, and the spices did not overpower this beer. The mouthfeel was smooth with a hint of sharpness up front. Medium body and low to medium carbonation feel. The spices lingered on the palate. This was a good pumpkin beer, one of the better ones out there, and very easy to drink.","UncleJimbo","Oct 10, 2003"

4.15,13.1,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Pours a hazy pale orange, with a good size white head that mostly diminishes, leaving sheets of lace. Very fine tiny bubbled carbonation in the body. Aroma is of freshly baked pumpkin pie, mostly from the cinnamon and nutmeg spices, backed with a good bit of hops. Flavor is again dominated with the cinnamon, some sweetness comes through in the middle, and the end is a mix with the spices and some hoppy bitterness in there as well. Medium-full bodied, fairly lively carbonation. A very good balance between the squash and malt sweetness, the spices, and a good level of hoppiness.","goz","Sep 25, 2003"
3.87,5.4,3.5,4,4,4,3.5,"This beer pours nicely, a head that settles fast over a nice orange amber. It smells strongly of spices but not so much of hops.

A exceptional pumpkin brew that I will get my share of this autumn.","AbePhroman","Sep 23, 2003"
3.96,7.9,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Smuttynose Pumpkin Ale is a slightly hazy straw colored brew with a thick white head that dissolves to a thick collar around the beer. The aroma is mainly a spicy combination of cinnamon, allspice and nutmeg. I think I can detect a little bit of toasted malt in there as well. Each sip of this medium bodied beer is smooth and delicious. Cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice dominate the flavor but do not overpower the taste buds. It finishes slightly malty which seems to hold all the flavors together. A spicy taste lingers on the palate after each sip.","WanderingFool","Sep 23, 2003"
4.07,10.9,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Love the label. Pours a golden orange color with an orangey beige head that drops right away. Nose is sweet and spicy, but not overly spiced like some other pumpkins. Flavor is very well balanced. Not overly pumpinized, not overly spiced with nutmeg, not overly hoppy. Very nice balance of all three (but lowest on hops). Tingly mouthfeel, and a sweet pumpkin finish, followed by a hop bitter aftertaste. Very good.","far333","Sep 20, 2003"
4.3,17.2,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"A very simple label merely adds to the appeal of this beer. A fuzzy orange color, with just a slight white lacey head.

3.8,3.5,4,4,4,3,3.5,"Definitely great for the early days of fall, when the weather is still warm and you're anticipating the leaves changing color.

4.08,11.2,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"Pours with an off white head settling onto amber/orange liquid, gently carbonated. Nose is a whiff of malt pushed aside by fresh fruity pumpkin pie spices (nutmeg, cinnamon etc.) mingled with a backbone of hoppy aromas. Taste is slightly astringent, quite hoppy with more pumpkin pie spice and some degree of malty sweetness. Finished a tad dry and thin but refreshing and tasty nonetheless...one of the better pumpkin ales I've tasted and I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys the style.","beerluvr","Sep 04, 2003"
3.82,4.1,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Pours with a huge white head that leaves hardly any lace. Hazy, light amber color. Serious pumpkin pie nose. Light - medium carbonation.
