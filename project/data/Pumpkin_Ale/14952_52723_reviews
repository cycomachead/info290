"Overall:  This is an excellent pumpkin beer!  Massive spice notes blended beautifully with the malt.  Absolutely delicious!  This absolutely goes on my pumpkin beers rotation!"

"This is probably the best they brew"

"Amazing pumpkin beer. Everything about it is just right. Continues to be my favorite."

"i was wrong, this is pumpkin pie filling in a bottle. full bodied creamy mouthfeel. this is the most authentic 'pumpkin' taste in a beer yet. i can tell AleWerks must have used real pumpkin puree for this one. its very smooth, pretty sweet-not cloyingly so though. different. i've never had a pumpkin ale that taste less like pumpkin pie and more like actual pumpkin. definitely spiced though, lots of cinnamon, nutmeg."

"On the pumpkin beer spectrum that ranges from pumpkin pie to gourd in flavor, AleWerk's Pumpkin Ale is certainly more toward the pie side. This beer tastes quite rich, with notes of vanilla, caramel, creme brûlée, and pumpkin pie. I also found the beer to have a strong alcohol taste and I thought it became a bit cloying as it warmed.  Overall, it's a solid pumpkin beer but could be refined a bit so that the sweet/alcohol flavors don't overpower the other, more subtle notes."
""

"A great pumpkin beer. I rate it just a notch under Wild Wolf Howlling Pumpkin, simply because it seems a bit raw. I did like the bite though, so it's basically a tossup for my favorite pumpkin ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This one is definitely in my top 5 pumpkin beers. I'm gonna have to try this and Schlafly's side by side and see which is better. I have a suspicion it may be this one."
""
"O:  Excellent extra in a trade that is super fresh, not available in MD and delicious.  This is a great pumpkin ale that everyone needs to try."
""

"Perfect for every fall day, or thanksgiving dinner."

"As a fan of m,y local brewery, I feel the need to also be honest. Aroma was light, head was small. Color was amazing, I have not seen a prettier golden-orange, brilliant color. It is amazing !!!. The taste is all over the place. There is a cool sweetness that hits you first and the the pumpkin and spices come next. The end has a bitter nutmeg taste that to me is not appealing. Need a little more balance in this brew.."
""
""
""
"I usually enjoy pumpkin beers that are sweet and heavily spiced, but AleWerks's rendition contained a bit too much of both for my liking. Perhaps this beer would benefit from a more dynamic flavor profile and a touch less sweetness."
""

"Being that it is intensely fresh, I went with a very heavy-handed pour, creating an initial pseudo-cascade which settled into two fingers of dense, tawny head with good retention. Color was Light Copper to Copper (SRM = > 13, < 17) with NE-quality clarity. Nose had an oddly fruity quality, underlain by the spice, not the other way around, which is more standard. Mouthfeel was medium. The taste was, interestingly, more sweet than spicy, more in keeping with what pumpkin pie tastes like and which the style was originally meant to mimic. I also liked that the spices were not overwhelmed by cinnamon, which can sometimes saturate this style of beer. Instead, the spices seemed to be more even and as such, more pleasant. Finish was dry, thanks to the spices, but not so dry and spicy as to be off-putting. I would say that this is probably one of the better examples of the style that I have tried."

"Overall - Best pumpkin beer I have had so far."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- this is a clear winner. Well done with a great taste. I will be shopping for this one every year from now on."
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. A little different from the normal pumpkin ale but enjoyable with a baked pumpkin flavor moreso than spices which collectively I found very enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
"o - overall a really nice pumpkin beer...must try for fans of the style. one of the better ones."
"An impressive pumpkin ale that is worthy of the name. My only complaint is that this beer flies off the shelves and unavailable if someone is not quick enough to get one."
""
""
""
"This lightly carbonated pumpkin ale pours to leave a nice thick ring of head about 1 finger deep. The aromas smell like a true pumpkin beer should smell like - not a pie or air freshener. You can smell the brown sugar, nutmeg, cinnamon, baked apples and loads of pumpkin - almost like a pumpkin meat pie. I tasted cinnamon and brown sugar first. Its heavy sweetness puts the melting pot of spices in the right place. This is a beer to be enjoyed on a cold November evening. It is very balanced and goes down extremely smooth. It has a spicy aftertaste that leaves a smooth but sweet taste in your mouth. Many pumpkin beers are unbalanced - either too sweet or too spicy. This one is just right. Pumking is just a prince to this ale. Grab it when you find it if you like pumpkin ale. A 6 pack of bottles goes down very easy. Case is only $44."
""
""
""
"I feel I might have been spoiled here: this trade extra is my first pumpkin ale, and from what I have seen, it has the highest rating amongst the pumpkin ale offerings. Any reservations I had about enjoying a pumpkin ale have been annihilated by this incredible brew, but how does it get better than this? If you can get you hands on this one, do not pass it by or cast doubts on how enjoyable a pumpkin ale can be, this is a winner."
""
""
""
""
"O: a very drinkable ale for a higher ABV beer. That said, it tends to the sweet side to balance an alcohol bite. Some mind find this off-putting, but it works for me for a beer that's supposed to be flavored."
""
""
""
""
"An interesting beer but the spice levels cover anything of any real value instead of enhancing it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice carbonation. Light but not watered down."
""

"I still don't see the outstanding rating, but this is a solid pumpkin ale."

"O: This is one malted beast of a Pumpkin Ale. I really respect Williamsburg AleWerks approach. This is focused primarily on the pumpkin and malts with spices only coming secondary. A rather hefty brew at 8% abv that would be best enjoyed on cold fall evenings."
""
""
""
"This is what a pumpkin beer should taste like. It hits all the right notes and tastes like pumpkin pie without over doing it."

"O-great balance of spice and pumpkin flavor in this beer, really enjoyable and is one of my favorite pumpkin ales"
""
"EDIT: Having this right now with Schlafly, and they're both outstanding. This is more sweet upfront and then roasted on the end, but they're both outstanding brews."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: If you read my other reviews, you'll soon find that I like my beers to be balanced in terms of flavors. There is no balance here at all -- it's all sugar and spice (and nothing else nice). Drinkable once, but there are far better pumpkin ales to be had."
""

"Totally blown away from this beer, and I want more."

"I LOVE THIS BEER. I was in phonexville at the end of fall last year and happened to walk into a bar that had it on tap. I have had ALOT of pumpkins beers, this is by far my favorite. I live in philly and am excited for the fall, mainly because of this beer, I hope that it finds me again, as I continue to search for it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, very nice pumpkin ale, even though they typically aren't my """thing""". Good addition of spices to remain strong but not too fatiguing. Malts play a huge role in providing a biscuit, cookie, and shortbread type of flavor profile. Certainly one of the best pumpkin ales I've had."
""
""
""
"Slightly below average pumpkin ale."
""
""
""
""
"8.4/10"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's a really good pumpkin beer. It does have a good dose of spices yet still keeps a good sweet balance to it."
""
""
""
"Overall it's probably my favorite pumpkin beer of this season."
""
""
""
"Overall, this was an excellent pumpkin beer and an even more excellent extra in an already awesome trade. Should have saved this for Thanksgiving but I'm not sorry I drank it. Cheers!"
"O: This was pretty good. With good balance, the flavor and mouth are very satisfying. This is going on my top list for pumpkin ales so far. My only gripe is that the aroma could be more pungent. I would recommend and buy a six pack of this stuff. Savor Great Beer!!!"
""
""
"a solid pumpkin ale for the fall season, this beer poured with a very minimal head (.5 inch) and had a very smooth sweet taste to it. The robust spices and flavor had very little bite and tasted like a bit of heaven to me. I thouroughly enjoyed it and would highly recommend it, especially for being a virginia beer."
"Final Thoughts: I've had/reviewed many pumpkin beers this fall and this is probably my favorite. Unlike others it balances the flavors superbly and delivers a true pumpkin pie experience. If that's what you're looking for then this is the beer for you. Would I drink it again? Yes."
""
""
"O - A bit on the richer side of the pumpkin beer spectrum, Williamsburg Alewerks' Pumpkin Ale combats the notion pumpkin beers abandon the """beer""" characteristics for a pie-like flavor with its hoppy earthy aroma and rich malt profile. The pumpkin is there but it takes some warming up for this stronger sipper to open up fully."

"O- wow, this was a great pumpkin ale, the best I've had thus far. The pumpkin and cinnamon flavors didn't taste artificial, which is what sets this apart from others. The finish and linger was so refreshing, this one is a must try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall I say you can chuck the appearance out the front door for a flavor like this. It may not be the prettiest beer, but it tastes near perfect. I would buy it again in a heartbeat. It's perfect for those looking for a nice autumn holiday beer. I was shocked to see that it is 8% ABV on the website, because I couldn't tell when drinking it. I will grab a few more when I get the chance."
"Poured an orange-copper color, slightly hazy, with a small white head; moderate retention and lacing. Mostly spice in the aroma, which is not a bad thing by me, cinnamon, allspice, caramel, pumpkin. Similar taste, with cinnamon being a dominant factor, caramel malts, nutshells, allspice, nutmeg, mild pumpkin flavors, which again, is ok...I like big flavor in my pumpkin ales, but that can come from the spice too. This was nice, almost like a simple spiced brown ale, medium body, smooth, and quite drinkable."
""
""
""
""
"Very good, especially as pumpkin ales go. It has a lot of depth, and isn't overly sweet. Most pumpkin ales I've had recently- Schlafly's, Weyerbacher's- cover their alcohol pretty well, and this one does the same. While it's still early for pumpkin ales, I'm glad I had this one, and wouldn't mind another as the season goes on."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a fantastic spiced beer with a dash of pumpkin. At the moment it is easily my favorite representation of the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I'm not sure what to make of this beer. The flavors work well together and there are really no flaws to the beer. However, the aroma is way different than the taste and the pumpkin is pretty weak. It's balanced, but not amazing."
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall, I thought this was a nice pumpkin ale offering that sits in the better half of its class. The flavor was nearly spot-on for what I look for in the style, with a good balance of both sweet pumpkin flavor and the appropriate spices. However, the mouthfeel wasn't the most pleasing for me and held back the beer as a whole. I'll have to try this beer again to see if the mouthfeel is better than this experience, and pair it with a nice slice of pumpkin pie as well."
""
""
"Solid pumpkin beer and definitely worth a try. Like many pumpkin beers, this is markedly better on draft, but this review is from a bottle."
"Overall- One of the best in the class. I wish I lived by this brewery, cause I would live there in the Fall."
""
""
"Beer is sweet, tastes like a cookie, really biscuity and strong. Forward on the spice but again it tastes like a graham cracker with pumpkin butter on it. It was enjoyable. I may even have this one again."
"12 oz bottle poured into Efes tulip. Low head/retention. Minimal lacing. Murky, muddy coppery colored with aroma of cardamom, nutmeg, malty sugary sweetness and pumpkin rind. Taste actually seems dominated by cardamom? Some light spicing on the back end, maybe nutmeg. The alcohol is very unnoticeable and this one is very easy to drink. Interesting take on a pumpkin."
""
""
"The beer appears orange to brown hued. A fine color for an autumn beer. The aroma brings pumpkin right up front, followed by cinnamon, nutmeg, pie, vanilla, malt. The flavor is great, with flavors of pumpkin pie, vanilla, and Fall spices. A bit sweet, but not too. Certainly one of the better pumpkin ales I have had."
""
""
"D: This was one of the better pumpkin ales I've tried. More like carrot cake than pumpkin pie, which I personally prefer. Great scent and taste, with nice body. Alcohol is well hidden too, so it was easy to drink. Recommended."
""
""
""
"O - An excellent pumpkin ale that came out of nowhere! Right up there with my favorite, Schlafly, as a top contender. Would have all the time if it was local. Yum!"
""
""
""
"O: One of the best pumpkin ales I've ever had. Wish I could find it more readily and that it was produced for a longer season - I could see drinking this all winter if it was an option."
""
"O - If the brew was a little more robust and had a bigger body it would be fantastic. I think it's a little thin for the ABV and it can support a little more pumpkin flavor. Overall it is a better pumpkin beer compared to what is available out there."
""
""
""
"Overall, i have to say that this is what i expect a pumpkin ale to be like, light with tastes of the fall season. This beer is not only good, but it fits the type perfectly."
""
""
"(Edited to reflect repeated drinking and increased appreciation for what Alewerks does with their pumpkin ale.)"

"I wasn't sure what to expect after mixed results from other Williamsburg beer, but this hit the spot on a chilly fall evening. It doesn't exactly stand out in the crowd, but this isn't a style with a deep range. There's a rich pumpkin pie spice aroma and initial flavor, followed by a slightly nutty, toffee malt character. The body is light enough to not let on the strength, I was surprised to learn it's 8%, so watch out for this one. Definitely worth a try if you can find it. This is a fine example of the style."
"O: This is one of Williamsburg's better efforts. It's a balanced and tasty beer."
"Somehow I missed this pumpkin beer during my time in NoVa. It's nice to trade, isn't it? Anyway, this stuff pours a lightly cloudy sunset tawny topped by maybe a half-finger of off-white foam. The nose comprises toasted pumpkin seeds, cinnamon, nutmeg, light rye bread, clove, and brown sugar. The spices hang heavily, but not overbearingly. The taste brings in more of the same, but instead of the seeds the pumpkin's flesh is now evident, producing a strange (-ish) bitterness that undercuts the heavy spicing. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a lightly grainy feel. Overall, a pretty solid pumpkin beer, one that somehow manages to spice the hell out of it without o'erwhelming my 'buds in the process."
"Pours a burnt orange with no appreciable head. Smells spicy and has a bold flavor of pumpkins and pie spice. There is a slight sweetness to this offering, but it is nothing unpleasant by any means. There are also some apple notes as well (perhaps, this accounts for the sweetness). The sweetness combines nicely with a very light alcohol and spice finish. As a fan of pumpkin beers (one of my favorite seasonal styles), I'd say that this ranks near the top of all the beers I sampled this year. Happy Halloween!"
"Overall, this is among the best. What a nice surprise."
"Overall: I enjoyed this beer, but the bitter finish could have been a little bit milder. Pretty good and I would have another."
"O: Significantly better fresh. (Though it's also possible that my recovery from surgery is not quite complete.) Still, one of the best pumpkin beers (maybe THE best) I've encountered. Highly recommended; will avidly seek out."
"On tap at Pizza Paradiso in Old Town. Poured into a snifter glass. Pours hazy deep copper toward ruby with off-white head. Nose is rich caramel malt, pumpkin puree and spice, cinnamon, nutmeg. Tastes delicious; rich, sweet, complex, with a huge authentic pumpkin puree/spice flavor, even notes of pie crust, and a super smooth finish. Wow, this is one of my favorite pumpkin ales out there!"
"All those spices rush in on the palate like a tribe in assault mode. Starts off big cinnamon and pumpkin spice, warps into a caramel malt sweet, and finishes mildly drying with a hint of nutmeg. This, along with Good Gourd from CCB are probably the best pumpkin beers I have had to date."
"Pours a clear light copper with a silky off white head. Fades to a thin crown, little lacing or carbonation. Excellent strong, yet balanced aroma. Cider like with pumpkin mash, clove, cinnamon, nutmeg, etc. Really enjoying the complexity of spice given the balance provided by the malt and pumpkin. Medium thick body, with an oily texture and a light syrupy finish. Flavor is sweet and has a surprising amount of pumpkin flavor. Nice to not just have a spice bomb. A very pleasant warmer, distinct from the other local suspects like Pumpking, Weyerbacher, etc."
"O: Looks and smells great. Very pumpkin-like flavor that hides the alcohol pretty well. Nice mouthfeel too."
"O: I've heard Williamsburg Alewerks has been producing great beers for some time, and this is definitely one of them. Easily the best Pumpkin Ale I have had, as this delectable brew allows the three great components to all shine in stride: pumpkin, pumpkin pie, and BEER. Too many beers of this ilk tend to shade towards sweet, sticky dessert types, losing many of the raw pumpkin and beer qualities. Not this one. It's thick, viscous, and perfectly balanced. Outstanding achievement."
"o - Overall I thought this was a fantastic pumpkin ale; one of the best I've ever had behind Schlafly and ST's Pumking. Ton of nice cinnamon and gingerbread and super easy to drink, I would certainly buy this one again."
"Overall: A really nice pumpkin ale, though perhaps just a tad too sweet for my palate"
"O- Wildly impressed. I might even go back to Philly where I know I can get more of this."
"I will go and say this is probably the best pumpkin beer I have had to date and this year I've been trying as many as I can get my hands on."
"Holy shit! What a surprise this brew was! I love when this happens. Stumbling upon this brew makes me realize that I don't have to resort to Pumking as much for a solid pumpkin brew. This beer poured out with a nice amberish orange color with a light fizzy white head on top. There's really no lacing or anything but still looks pretty nice. The smell of this beer had some really nice autumn aromas and spice going on in it. The taste is unreal! I couldn't believe how good this tastes, the flavors even get better as it warms up. Plenty of sweet spices on tongue with a nice caramel in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is really nice also. Overall I can't believe how solid this beer is. It will be one I'll be on the look out for in the future for sure. I'll be lookin for more before this season is up! Really gotta try this one!"
"This really was a real treat for me, which says a decent amount because I consider myself a Pumpkin beer fan and aficionado. I am going to have to sample this next to my 2 top favorite of the style; Weyerbacher and Hoppin' Frog to see how it compares. Highly, highly recommended if you are a fan of Pumpkin beers."
"D: An 8% pumpkin beer that drinks like a liquid pumpkin pie.. its a sipper in my book."
"O - The easiest drinking, lightest imperial pumpkin I've had. If the abv were lower, it'd be one of the better session-ish pumpkins out there too, a good blend of beer and pumpkin. Drinkable and repeatable. Would prefer a little more head retention to throw me that spice note on every sip. Not quite as """pie"""-like as some of the very best, but very good for the style."
"Overall this is a Homer beer for me so take it for what it is but I loved it. Def one of my favorite Pumpkin beers so far with my limited exposure."
"nice example of style, very enjoyable. abv well masked."
"Pours a deep burnt orange into the glass. Minimal head that disappeared quickly. Smell is nice for a pumpkin beer. Hints of multiple standard spice for the type like nutmeg and cinnamon, but its nice to actually smell pumpkin itself as well. Taste is spot on. Really does taste like pumpkin pie with a great blend of spice and pumpkin, and it doesn't feel """artificial""" like in some pumpkin beers. Mouthfeel is also really above average in this one. Its got a nice smooth feel in the carbonation that is not sticky or cloying like you can find in some spice bombs. Williamsburg has a top notch seasonal in this one that again seems to be flying under the radar for some reason."
"Overall a great example of a pumpkin ale."
"This is a great pumpkin beer that I'll enjoy in the fall/winter while watching football and around the holidays."
"O: I really like it. Will have another; recommended."
"This is one to be had for sure. The flavors may be a bit more subtle compared to others in the style, but still completly satisfying."
"Overall Experience- a decent pumpkin beer, not to crazy like some that make the beer taste like a dessert. Very warming as well. would love this beer on tap in October or early november."
"1st rating for this brew! 12oz bottle from grape & gourmet, batch 91009. pours a very nice clear, dark copper with a whispy, off white head and a solid ring of lace. aroma is great and very similar to pumpkin cheescake with big, sweet pumpkin notes, graham cracker crust, and pure spice notes of cinnamon, clove, and nutmeg, with a touch of caramel malts. flavor is excellent as well with natural pumpkin flavors blended with sweet vanilla, big spice notes of cinnamon and nutmeg, orange peel and clove, and a touch of nutty, carrot cake with a lingering, spiced finish. palate is medium bodied and very well carbonated with a great balance of sweetness and fall spice. overall, another great new brew from Geoff and AleWerks!"
"Bright orange color, very opaque, glows in the light. Head is nonexistent. A vigorous pour generates a few bubbles, but nothing to speak of. Looks very still in the glass. Aromas are of pie spice and candy corn. Body is surprisingly light for the high abv, sweet but not too much. Pumpkin flavor is mellow with good spice and pie character, not overdone. Solid beer overall, but I think it was better a few months ago."
"Aroma was highly spiced but yet not overpowering as you see a lot with these pumpkins. They usually put too much of everything and try to force home the point of what it is, but this seemed to be very nice and subtle. It had a lighter overall smell then some, lots of nutmeg, and cinnamon and a good amount of fresh grass or even a tree like smell to it.This was followed by loads of fall spices, cinnamon, nutmeg, lots of spiced apple, just a good all around mix. There was a noticeable hoppy presence and this definitely could not be hidden. Great finish left you wanting another sip almost right away and there was just really an overall light and vibrant feel and flavor to this. Again very well put together. Super light but yet smooth at the same time. Very nice carbonation led itself to this and really helped to push the flavors out at you. This was full of the little carbonation bubbles if that makes any sense at all. It really made it feel silky like and had a great smoothness to it."
"Second only to pumpking in terms of pumpkin ales ive tried so far"
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's a very good pumpkin beer. I love that they use real roasted pumpkin and they also really do get the spices right for a beer. The sweetness really cuts the cinnamon and nutmeg nicely. This is definitely one of my favorite pumpkin beers of the season and one I will buy annually right along with Pumking."
"Finding the perfect balance in a Pumpkin Ale is hard to achieve--Williamsburg AleWerks nailed it here. Certainly big enough to throw at the heartiest of holiday meals. A real winter warmer."
"This is my favorite pumpkin beer seasonal - even above Pumking and Punkin. I like the sweetness and the huge pumpkin spice aroma that is unmistakeable in this beer from a small Virginia brewery."
"Reviewed on 1/10/2010. Bottle thanks to dkachur. Pours a clear orange with a small white head. Aroma of sweet pumpkin, pumpkin pie, crust, and spices. Flavor is pure pumpkin pie -- the pumpkin, crust, and even whipped cream on top. Pumpkin spices in the finish. On the sweet side and a little syrupy. It becomes a little cloying by the end of the glass but it's certainly a decent pumpkin ale."
"D: Really, really tasty. One of the better pumpkin beers I've tried. Worth seeking out."
"D: Only have a single bottle of this and that is enough. A great beer is in here but they need to play with the spices a little bit which is a really hard thing to nail down."
" The pumpkin in this is nice and not muted with a mild caramel malt backing and slight toasted taste with lighly sweet yet substantial malt flavor. The spiced middle is moderate and holds on to the end with creamy quality and subtle pepper w/ a hint of nutmeg. The vegetal flavor is there but kept to a minimum. This is a pretty tasty pumpkin, w/ good drinkabiity. A tad on the sweet side, but there is a nice amount of spice too. This style is one I might not drink often, but this is above average with very subtle alcohol for the abv."
"D:alcohol is very well hidden , very drinkable ,"
"D- I love this one. It was a top notch pumpkin beer. If only it was available in my area, I would have brought it to my pumpkin beer tasting. Would gladly do this one again next year."
"J"
"This is an excellent Pumpkin Ale. The scent is so strong you will convince yourself that a pumpkin pie is baking nearby. Watch out for the ABV; it makes this one almost an imperial pumpkin."
"B+ from the wife. Not as good as Pumking or Schlafly's version."
"The beer pours an orangish-amber color with a white head. The aroma is a nice mix of pumpkin, along with all of the spices you expect in a pumpkin pie. The flavor is more of the same. While all of the spices are present, the ones that seem to stand out the most are cinnamon and cloves. All of the spices meld nicely and create a wonderful pumpkin ale. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Overall, perhaps my favorite pumpkin beer I've yet had. I love the Dogfish Head punkin, but this is perhaps even better."
"Simple pumpkin goodness, with nothing overdone lends itself to a good drinkability."
"D - With this much spice, I'm not sure I could drink it all day. The slight alcohol tinge makes you realize it's a beer, so while it's nice to have one or two, I'd probably switch to something else."
"This is an excellent pumpkin beer and may be my favorite. This brewery is really brewing some impressive beer."
"Pours a clear copper with a small head. As far as pumpkin ale aromas go, this one is on the extremely spicy, potpourri-like, end of the spectrum. If I were blindfolded and asked to smell it, I would not not be able to identify it as a beer. Normally I would consider this a major drawback, but in this case, the intense aromas of cinnamon, ginger, cloves, pumpkin, and brown sugar are so natural and enticing that I consider them an asset. The taste is almost like a highly spiced cider, like the mulled ciders we used to drink when the weather turned cold. The unabashed intensity of its holiday character draws me in and recalls family parties past. As far as pumpkin ales go, this is a love-it-or-hate-it beer, and I love it. Only complaint is that it's too sweet for anything but sipping very slowly."
"12 oz bottle poured into a tulip. This beer is one of the best pumpkin beers I've had. Poured a full inch of head that dissipated within 30 seconds. Color is a medium brown with a bit of cloudiness that obscures anything behind the glass. Aroma is of spice, nuts, and bananas. The banana aroma seems to smell like a Belgian yeast, fruity esters. The spice and banana notes let this beer almost smell like fresh banana nut bread. Once you get into the taste of the beer, the pumpkin pulls through with a pleasant ghram cracker crust taste. Body is a bit weak for pumpkin pie, but it drinks really easily. I think this would pair very well with a good chocolate brownie or some vanilla bean ice cream."
"Honestly, I couldn't imagine a better pumpkin ale."
"Mouthfeel and drinkability: Very crisp beer. There was some good carbonation which made it very easy to consume."
"M/D - just not what i'm looking for in a pumpkin ale, too much spice for me, I like them smoother and not just spices i guess."
"drinkability: pretty good"
"Smooth beer medium body quite tastey. Iam not very big on pumpkin beers so I really would only have one of these, still a good choice if your going for one."
"Drinkability: One of the better pumpkin ales I have tried this year. There is a good balance between the spice and the pumpkin, though it does tend to lean ever so slightly towards the spice. It is very refreshing, and a downright tasty beer."
"D - There is no doubt about it... This is quite simply, hands down, the most perfect Pumpkin Ale that has ever crossed my lips... A truly epic introduction to a brewery that I had never heard of... I wish this weren't a seasonal... I would gladly drink this each and every chance I got... This is not just one of the best Pumpkin Ales that I've ever had, it's one of the best beers that I've ever had..."
"Pours a clear golden orange with amber highlights. Thin yet creamy head, minimal lacing. Smell is of pumpkin pie... pumpkin puree, brown sugar, with moderate spicing (cinamon, nutmeg, ginger). Taste is of pumpkin pie... pumpkin puree up front with a nice sweet brown sugar (crust!) and sweet milky (whipped cream!) flavor, spicing is under control. Exceptional balance, yet the flavors do not seem to last long in the mouth. Mouthfeel is silky and creamy. One of the best pumpkin beers I have ever had, no question."
"A clear orange/brownish body with one-finger head. A strong cinnamon and peppery smell along with a good pumpkin aroma. Pumpkin and bread malts are clearly evident, along with some caramel malts for sweetness. A light body that is smooth and easy to drink but finishes a little sharp as the sweetness is complemented/balanced with some pepper and clove spices. A very good pumpkin beer, although the guy who sold me on it said it was as good as ST's Pumpking. Not quite, but close."
"Overall: One of the best pumpkin beers I've had to date. If you're a fan of this style, be sure to seek this one out."

"D: I tried this straight out of the fermenter when I stopped by the brewery. I immediately bought a case off of them as soon as it was bottled."
"I was out with a couple of friends in the park and we purchased a six-pack of this (with solo cups) from an upscale corner store that recently opened by Lincoln Park. We all really liked this, and it went perfectly with an early fall day and bocce ball. As a beer, it was very nice, medium body, not too much head but very pleasant. We purchased it for the pumpkin flavor though, and on that count it was the best I've had. The smell and flavor of pumpkin and spices was just right, definitely there, but not completely overwhelming the beer. It also did not have the artificial taste. If you are a fan of this flavor, and not everyone is, then grab a six pack of this and you won't be dissapointed."
