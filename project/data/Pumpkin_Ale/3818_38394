3.99,-1.7,3.75,4.75,3.75,3.25,4,"The translucent copper-creamsicle ale crashes in to a goblet, forming an inch of lush foam. The linen colored head stands barely an inch, with densely packed bubbles and thin lacing around the rim. The glorious smell of fresh baked pumpkin pie fills the nose, complete with a buttery graham cracker crust. There's an assortment of pumpkin potpourri spices that serve to compliment the hearty gourdlike aroma. The first sip.... flavor overload. This beer is a sweet spice-bomb in the strictest sense. Each tiny sip packs enough flavor to embarrass most of its competition. The buttery, sweet malts are there, but you only get a fleeting moment with them before the spices come barreling in. There's also a slight hop bite that ties this beer together and keeps it from completely overwhelming your senses. At 8.6%, the alcohol is well hidden, but you could hide a Buick behind the cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg and allspice. They stick to your palette like a burr, embedded until you raise the glass again to wash away the taste and start over. The mouthfeel is a little lighter than you might expect from a beer of this magnitude. A richer, fuller body would suit this brew well, creating an unparallelled seasonal dessert-beer. The current beer just doesn't have the constitution to support so much character. At any rate, this is a slow sipper. I can do one of these each year, and I continue to appreciate this outrageous ode to pumpkin pie.","JohnnyI","Dec 31, 2014"

There is a lot going on as I'm getting a ton of spice cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, ginger along with a heavy toasted biscuit aroma.  This is very reminiscent of the Warlock by Southern Tier.  The taste is quite similar to the smell all of the spice is there and there is a pretty good caramel malt base so I'm sure a lot of people could find this quite nice.  However, I think that this is far too brash and heavy handed to rate any higher than average as I'm more a fan of the milder versions of the style.  There is a touch of bitterness that is found near the finish and that goes along with a medium body and medium level of carbonation in general this beer tends to be quite sweet.  Overall I'm not a very big fan of this because I don't like such a strongly spiced pumpkin ale, however, it is a good representation of the style that I'm sure some will enjoy.","fank2788","Nov 01, 2014"

Pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg, pumpkin pie spices, and graham cracker.  Taste follows with an opening of vegetal pumpkin flavor, pumpkin pie spices from the nose hit mid way, buttery graham cracker profile underneath and a nice hit of spicy hop flavor in the finish.  Decent carbonation carries a medium body to a creamy finish.  The finish could be cleaned up a bit and the spices dialed back just a touch.  One of my favorite pumpkin beers overall with classic fall flavors.","HopBomb515","Oct 16, 2014"

4.75,17,,,,,,"Wow.  Although I did see this beer highly rated on multiple websites as a top pumpkin beer, I did not expect to drink, well, pumpkin pie.  This has a LOT of sugar, but isn't overly sweet, with the thick pumpkin taste, along with spices, pie crust, and a very slight malt/hop kick.  I would say this is like no beer i have ever had - when i poured it into the glass, the head was almost non-existent, but there was plenty enough carbonation; from here, the first sip seemed to shock me, with the fresh pumpkin pie overtaking my mind.  It is decently thick, and with the taste of all aspects (already listed) of pumpkin pie, and a little beer, taking over with HUGE flavor.  Some may think it is sweet, but it really isn't as sweet as you may think/expect.  I think it is perfect, and less sweet than pumpkin pie is.  Overall, amazing beer and experience.","Kickerdude","Oct 16, 2014"

I would drink NightOwl over this any day or actually I would drink the pumpkin beer from the local craft brewery a few miles from us. This tastes nothing like pumpkin and had such a strong disgusting smell and taste but I couldn't put my finger on what it was. My husband thought it was hazelnut.

4.33,6.7,3.25,4.5,4.5,4,4.25,"BOD 8/10/14.  Clear light amber pour.  Fair head, lacing and retention.  Wonderful nose of strong pumpkin over balanced spicy notes of clove and nutmeg.  As it warms, biscuit malt, cinnamon and vanilla notes appear. Medium bodied with an almost slick mouthfeel.  Normal carbonation with a bit of effervescence on the finish.  The flavor profile is intense, complex and fairly well balanced considering the brewer's desired effect - it comes at you like an unrestricted NASCAR racer at 'Dega (ie. over 220 mph).  It begins by smashing you in the face with pumpkin, that then flows into a smash in the face of the aforementioned spices.  Clove takes the lead in the middle and slowly fades into a vanilla note over a rich biscuit and bready sweetness.  The finish is smooth and a blend of the flavors linger against a nice mild alcohol burn at the back of the throat.","tillmac62","Oct 03, 2014"

Great sweet butterscotch smell with just a touch of pumpkin spices.  Taste is much the same as the smell.  Butterscotch malt but not too sweet.  Some spices but not too much or overpowering.

Scents of rich, buttery pie crust, pumpkin, nutmeg, hints of vanilla and low levels of cinnamon. Overall impression of aroma is wonderfully rich aroma that captures the entire profile of a pumpkin pie quite nicely. Very good. Flavor begins with a wonderful flavor of pumpkin, with notes of cinnamon and nutmeg, and some malty sweetness, with a low, yet present bit of bitterness balancing the sweet pumpkin, malt and spices. This moves into a middle that adds a rich, buttery pie crust flavor, continues with flavors of pumpkin and spice and still balances it with a low yet present hop character that is mostly earthy and floral, a hint alcohol is also noticeable. Finish is moderately sweet, with notes of pumpkin, buttery pie crust, pumpkin pie filling, alcohol at a moderate-low level and a bit of hop flavors with low bitterness. Aftertaste is pumpkin, spices and some faint floral and earthy hop flavors. Overall impression is of a flavor profile that is remarkably like pumpkin pie, but kept by becoming cloying by a nice balance of hop flavors and alcohol. This allows the beer to be sweet and dessert-like, yet still very much identifiable as a beer. Quite well executed and very pleasant. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate-light carbonation and smooth. Very nice and quite easy to sip, hiding the ABV well, despite the alcohol in the flavor. Overall this is a nice pumpkin ale, of the variety seeking to be pumpkin pie-like. It has a rich, wonderful aroma and flavor, but is balanced enough to avoid becoming cloying. It also avoids the all too common trap of being too watery or one note in flavor that many such beers fall into. The end result is a finely crafted pumpkin ale that is extremely enjoyable to drink. If you like pumpkin ales this one is highly recommended.","Auraan","Aug 30, 2014"

4,-1.5,,,,,,"Pretty stoked to see this in CO since I never have but always hear about it. Drinking this out of a goblet as the bottle instructs and it pours a hazed amber with thin collar and minimal carbonation, but let me add that I actually cracked the bomber last night and have just had it corked since then, so some carbonation may have escaped. Aroma is sweet like candy, with cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla, and butterscotch. Light color gives way to unexpected maltiness, booze is noticeable, and the spices are quite present in the flavor giving each sip a nice peak in the middle followed by light bitterness, mostly from the alcohol. Mouthfeel is slick and medium bodied, light carbonation. The only thing that throws me is the vanilla/butterscotch component, which I guess is what gives it the """pie crust""" component advertised on the label. In my experience, there are two basic types of pumpkin ales: spiced pumpkin, and pumpkin pie, and I am more a fan of the former. Still, this is a good representation of the pumpkin-pie style, and anyone who's in that camp should love this one. Glad to have finally tried it, but wouldn't get this one again.","BeerWizard","Aug 23, 2014"

Loved it and would highly recommend.","WhiteHillsStore","Aug 23, 2014"

However, this year's Southern Tier Pumking will be hard to beat! That perfect """pumpkin pie""" flavor, with just the right portion of each spice, is not something I've encountered so brilliantly in a beer before. I certainly could not ask for a tastier pumpkin ale.","SpatenPony","Aug 23, 2014"

Still today it is my favorite pumpkin beer! it seems they have changed the beer a little bit since last year but I feel its definitely improved! I get stronger notes of hops and malts and it feels less overpowered by sugar. It still has all of my favorite aspects, wonderful notes of pumpkin pie, pie crust, brown sugar, vanilla, and spice to tie it all together. However, it seems this time around they really focused on toning down all the sugary flavors and let the hops do the taking. To sum it up, its the best yet. I love the balance it has and how perfectly layered it is. I plan on buying plenty of these this year!","AyeMito","Aug 14, 2014"

First whiff is that of raw pumpkin with a slightly sweet smell and very similar to a Korean sweet rice drink. There is a hint of cloves and cinnamon and nutmeg in the aroma at the end. Taste is that of raw pumpkin with a bitterness at the end. There is no sweetness to this beer at all. Not much in the way of cloves, nutmeg or cinnamon. Just pure raw pumpkin. I did not detect any similarity to a pumpkin pie or cake. If you like the raw pumpkin smell then this beer is for you.","Richardbeerlover","Aug 09, 2014"

Pumpkin, nutmeg, allspice, etc. Has a nice bready flavor as well with a hint of vanilla. A little light in the mouth, feel wise, but one of the best pumpkin style beers I've ever had. I'm definitely going to have to pick up a few more bottles to enjoy over the course of the fall.","st8fan19","Aug 09, 2014"

I thoroughly enjoy Schlafly which is terrific, The Great Pumpkin by Elysian as well as their Night Owl, but I've yet to find anything that does it for me like Pumking - maybe I will get my hands on some Good Gourd this year to see if it is as good as some say. Pumpkin beers are not for everyone and I find reviews of Pumking, especially polarizing. It's love or hate and for me...I love this one. I drink it all year round!

5,23.2,5,5,5,5,5,"This beer is fantastic.  If you don't like pumpkin then stay away this beer is not for you. Everything about this beer is great.  It's my most anticipated seasonal  every year and once again ST didn't disapoint.  It pours to a dark rich looking  golden brown.  The smell radiates for the bottle the instant you open it.  The smell once poured into a goblet is even better. A thick aromatic spice smell hits you instantly.  Followed by subtle vanilla.  Pumpkin is in the air.  It tastes like it smells.  Like a little bit of heaven with the big guy himself holding the serving spade. If I had to chose one way to describe the taste it would be liquid pumpkin pie.  Mouth feel is instantly sweet with very low bitterness even with the two types of hops.  The two different malts balance nicely.  The finish is the best part and is also where this pumpkin ale takes the crown to all the rest.  Pie filling, pie crust, seasonal pumpkin spice. All that's missing is the whip cream (not really, that would be nasty).  If anyone reading this hasn't figured out my overall score you should prob read this again. 5...5....5!!!! A superb fall/seasonal beer.","adami212","Aug 07, 2014"

4.04,-0.5,4,4.25,4,3.75,4,"Bottled 8/24/11 Aged nearly 3 years. Opened with a zesty fizzy punch of carbonation. Poured a translucent amber with an orange pumpkin-like hue. Small white bubbly head dissipated quickly. Nose is bready must (akin to a freshly carved pumpkin), some pie spice, some sweetness. Just an awesome, unique, evocative nose. Taste is bready must up front. On the sides, there's an unfortunate creamed corn flavor. The finish is musty & sweet and sticks around for a while. It's not very complex but the musty pumpkin flavor is unique enough to keep things interesting. Mouthfeel is medium. Decent carbonation. In summary, the nose is huge, the taste largely follows through. Aside from the creamed corn flavor, it's a unique, tasty beer. I don't think 3 years of age hurt or helped.","foobula","Jun 15, 2014"

4.08,0.5,4,4,4.25,3.75,4,"Poured hazy golden orange, with a half inch head that quickly settled to nothing, leaving no lacing in the glass.  Aroma is just like a fresh loaf of pumpkin bread fresh from the oven. I also get a slight hint of vanilla. The flavor is big pumpkin up front, with some nutmeg and cinnamon, with a lot of bitterness in the back end. The 8.6% ABV is very well hidden. Mouthfeel was kinda thin, almost a little disappointing, carbonation was nice. Overall, this is my favorite pumpkin beer so far. Definitely will be buying more of these before they're gone for the year. Really glad that Southern Tier has finally made it to Colorado.","timontheroad","May 21, 2014"

4.51,11.1,4,4.75,4.5,4.25,4.5,"Bucky purchased Pumking from his local LCBO in a brown, 650 ml bottle with a bottling date of July 11, 2012. Pumking has been brewed since 2007, and is 8.6% alcohol by volume. Pumking poured a hazy dark orange colour, with the orange becoming much brighter when backlit. A fairly aggressive pour produced about 1""" of fizzy white head, which burned itself out within 3 minutes, leaving no spotting or lacing. The beer's aroma was wonderful; pumpkin pie spices and graham cracker pie crust...I swear! Its taste was sweet and dominated by the graham cracker pie crust, with distinct pumpkin pie spice flavours and maybe just a hint of vanilla. No bitterness here at all. Pumking was characterized by a medium level of carbonation, just right for its type, and a smooth mouth feel. It is light to medium bodied, but actually feels a bit heavier than it is due to the rich flavours. At $8.95 per 650 ml bottle the price tag is fairly steep, but a few bottles as a seasonal indulgence won't break the bank. Overall, I can't wait until next fall for the new seasonal batch!","BuckyBeerBeaver","Apr 13, 2014"

The flavor has more of the pumpkin up front, with the malts taking a back seat. Tons of cinnamon and clove come through as well, and the higher alcohol content makes itself apparent. The mouthfeel is a bit chewy, so this beer is kind of like a pumpkin pie in a glass. One of the best pumpkin beers.","asaharyev","Feb 16, 2014"

The carbonation complements the body's thickness quite nicely, the beer is quite pleasant on the palate. Finish is dry and leaves a lingering dryness and substantial sweetness on the palate, compelling another sip.","falloutsnow","Nov 20, 2013"

Lively carbonation is observed, there are quite a few bubbles rising in the glass. The room is almost overwhelmed with the aroma of spice (cinnamon, nutmeg, etc.) and a sweet caramel-like aroma. A slight aroma of pumpkin is picked up. 1st sip brings a dry dose of the aforementioned spices...a little TOO dry for my tastes. This could use some more malt or maybe a hint of brown sugar sweetness to even out the dry bitterness! Mouthfeel is medium, not watery or heavy. Overall, a bit of a disappointment. WAY too dry & bitter, almost unpleasantly so! Perhaps I got a bad bottle, unfortunately (or maybe not) it was among the last ones of the season, at least at Total Wine and More @ Claymont, DE. I'll have to look around and see if there's more somewhere out there, otherwise i'll have to wait a year to give this another chance.

I got an overwhelming amount of graham cracker in the aroma, and the alcohol was just too up front. It was an easy drinker though, and the colour was true to style. The hops take a back seat to the malt, but I would have liked less graham cracker aroma and taste, less vanilla, more spices. The pumpkin was there in the background as well. I think this is one of those beers with so much going on that personal tastes really come into play. A few tweaks here and there and I would have loved it, but then it would have been a different beer. Worth a try.","sasky7777","Nov 06, 2013"

The aroma offered is very nice: sweet malt, with a subtle spicy mix where no one component really dominates--I can pick out nutmeg, but barely--the blend is really nice. The flavor continues the perfect blend of spices, though it borders on being too sweet for me. There nice vanilla notes I didn't pick up in the nose. There's some bitterness at the end but overall it's on the sweet side. The body is delightfully light for the strength. Personally, I'd appreciate a smaller-sized bottle, but this is a very good pumpkin beer.","allengarvin","Nov 05, 2013"

Don't get it twisted, this is not a hoppy beer by any means, just that I didn't really notice it on the nose, but it is here somewhat in the flavour. The sweet pumpkin pie still drives this beer, as well it should. Creamy and round, it's surprisingly drinkable, and the 8.6% is well covered. Not entirely surprisingly, I liked Warlock better (I adore big creamy stouts), but this is a top tier (no pun intended) autumnal liquid. Reading the admonishments that it 'wasn't as good as last year (nothing ever is, is it...)' had me slightly worried, but, having never tasted 'last years,' this stands on its own as an extremely enjoyable beverage experience.","kemoarps","Oct 20, 2013"

There's quite a bit going on taste-wise, though the pumpkin flavor is muted. Instead, there's a good deal of sweetness up front, plus coriander, cardamon, basil, more vanilla, some white pepper, and an aftertaste that reminds me of being sick and spoon-fed benadryl or old cough syrup. There's a medicinal bitterness and tang (eucalyptus, anise), which lingers too long for my taste. It's nicely balanced beer in terms of its body, with subtle carbonation. I'm not too sure what makes this a pumpkin ale, other than it's orange color, and that the label says """Ale Brewed with Pumpkins.""" A spiced fall ale, perhaps. Heck, it even has some qualities of a winter ale. A mixed bag.","kaufmaal","Oct 07, 2013"

4.29,5.7,3.75,4,4.5,4.5,4.25,"Bought a bottle at Table and Vine in West Springfield, MA. Attractive gold-amber appearance with lots of carbonation and a thin, creamy head. Aromas are incredibly strong to the point of a bit overwhelming. A definitive sweet smell of pumpkin, strong cinnamon, maybe a little vanilla. If the aromas were just taken down a notch a bit, it may have been less overwhelming. Otherwise, these are mouth-watering aromas. The taste was dessert level sweetness. I liked it, though I can see how some might be taken very aback by how sweet this is. Definitely could taste a strong, baked pumpkin pastry flavor to the beer, as well as that vanilla I sensed a bit from the smell. The mouthfeel is what perfectly supplements this beer as a very sweet, dessert-like beer to have after supper. This was a very creamy drink with a medium carbonation. That adds to that flavor quite well, so if you want a dessert-like, seasonal beer, I would highly recommend this beer.","fitzy84","Oct 05, 2013"

Pumpkin flavor is very apparent with lots of cinnamon and nutmeg but also has a quite a bit of complexity to it. Worth trying. 4","mick303","Oct 03, 2013"

4.28,5.4,3.75,5,4,4.5,4,"Poured gently into a brandy snifter, very light and average sized head. The hype for this beer seems to be mostly placed on the smell and indeed it somehow captures the most pleasant and creamy aspects of pumpkin pie spices. First sip was nearly all vanilla with a touch of spice, but the proceeding sips are increasingly complex with english ale, more spices, and even a touch of raw pumpkin meat drawing me in. As with the smell, I immediately and consistently got an exceptionally smooth and creamy texture. It's almost too drinkable considering the the complex flavors and high ABV. Pumking is a different kind of sipper due to the candy like flavor and mouthfeel. This beer is a special occasion in and of itself, glad I got to finally try this.","SamRoberts","Sep 25, 2013"

This is one that I store so we can have a triple vertical every Thanksgiving, along with my pumpkin pie. It ages in an odd and inconsistent way: the booziness advances and retreats with time, as does the pumpkin flavor. It's arguable whether it's better after the pumpkin spice pulls back a little but what isn't is that it's absolutely amazing when fresh. It's all about the spice and the vanilla notes, just like my pumpkin pie, with the pumpkin crouching in the background. But don't bother drinking it with a cold: the wonderful aroma is 90% responsible for the great taste.","EmpiricalBill","Sep 25, 2013"

Smooth, clean, refreshing. I had the White Gourmet pizza and the combination worked well. The taste was true pumpkin with a nice nutmeg and cinnamon undertone. Perhaps the day in the sun visiting every animal display (yes, every one) set me up to enjoy any cold beverage, but I do not think so. This was a delightful beer that I would recommend. (A subsequent purchase of the same in a bottle produced a less enthusiastic but still positive experience.)","rhamning","Sep 19, 2013"

It has an articial sweet mintiness that overwhelmed any subtle pumpkin notes. though one of my friends actually thought it was decent, tasting pie - which I see some other reviewers also noted.","Halvin","Sep 19, 2013"

The spices don't hit me over the head as much as I would have expected, which is a good thing. I pick up some pumpkin along with the baking spice, so it isn't too hidden. Fairly sweet overall, which seems appropriate. Finishes with a surprising and welcome bitterness. I get some of that graham cracker in there too.

This beer didn't have the best drinkability, it was somewhat smooth and not filling, but the flavor didn't do a good job at holding my attention and half a bomber is more than enough for me, there's no way I would want to drink a whole bomber to myself, it would be way too much and I don't think I could do it. What I liked the most about this beer was the mouthfeel and appearance, they both worked well with this beer and the appearance was pretty good. What I liked the least about this beer was how over the top all the flavors were except the pumpkin, it didn't highlight the pumpkin, it just covered it up. I wouldn't buy this beer again, it just not something I enjoyed and I would only recommend it to people that prefer their Pumpkin Ales heavy on the dessert side. All in all this beer just wasn't for me, I could see how some people would like it but to me it just wasn't something that I would want to revisit. I wish it was much more balanced since the pumpkin flavors only showed up a little in the background. I think Southern Tier is a fairly solid brewery, but I haven't liked any beers from the Black Water series, I don't think this it's as bad as Creme Brulee but it isn't much better either. I appreciate the attempt but this one was a miss for me, better luck next time guys.","StoutHunter","Sep 14, 2013"

It strays so far from what ( even ) craft beer drinkers might think is the norm (or the norm 'spectrum' ) regarding balance and complexity that you really have no choice but to give in completely to the sensatory impulses and forget about checking criteria boxes.","endovelico","Sep 02, 2013"

Until now Brooklyn Brewers Post Road Pumpkin Ale was the only pumpkin beer I've really liked since the flavoring is more subtle than most. Pumking takes the opposite route yet I still really enjoyed it. Many pumpkin beers can have a cloying sweetness but this beer does really well avoiding that. It delivers on the Fall time flavors yet because of it's thin body is still very drinkable. I'll definitely be picking this up again as we creep into Fall.","JAFoley","Sep 02, 2013"

Taste matches the smell, with a hint of orange and a little caramel. Body is medium thin for its heft, would prefer a little more life, not dry, and goes down easy enough.

The smell was quite a bit like pumpkin pie, with the vegetable smell mixing with cinnamon, and dough. The taste was much more intense than I was expecting, as there were flavors of pumpkin, cinnamon, vanilla, and nutmeg up front, followed by a surprising hop presence. The interplay between sweet, spicy, and bitter was very well done. The finish was dry, and showcased the spices. The body was a little thicker than medium, with a little sticky coating in the mouth.

We haven't even hit September yet and have hit the brewery 3 times...Yo Bitch. So the scoop is, ST will have bottles weekend of Labor Day, for now it's $5 glasses and Growlers. So we are getting primed for the upcoming season. The Warlock which comes out in September should be tasty, I'm already thinking Black & Orange with the King /Warlock. Actually had some King left at the bottom of a growler which sat for 2 weeks in the fridge... Talk about taste coming out... Yeah it lost carbonation Bitches but the flavor was 10 times more intense... This beer winters well. If you read this far on more piece of TRIVIA...

I know it sounds trite to repeat what everybody else says about tasting like pumpkin pie, so I won't. What I will say is that it has an incredibly creamy taste to it which, either by itself or in conjunction with something(s) else, serves to mask the alc which at the end of 22 oz is definitely felt.

3.68,-9.4,3,4.25,3.5,3.75,3.5,"Overall: Pumking is definitely an interesting take on the pumpkin beer. It does achieve in evoking thoughts of pumpkin pie and the autumn season. Drinking one definitely feels like it's time to bring on the season. I enjoy having one of these in the season, but I don't find it something I would really seek out all the time or of which I'd buy excessive quantities. Still, it's definitely worth a try as the legend it is. Those that enjoy it really seem to love it, so there is value in finding out if it meshes well with your palate. During the season it seems to available just about anywhere, and at $6.99 a bottle (in this area, at least), it is reasonably priced, so it's worth at least one try.","hermit990","Mar 22, 2013"
4.32,6.4,3.5,4,4.75,3.5,4.5,"One of the best pumpkin beers of the fall season. There does not appear to be a lot of actual pumpkin involved, but the beer is spiced very nicely. On top of that, the 8.6 alcohol percentage is blended very well. This is one of the lightest pumpkin beers out there but it makes up for it in spice.","YardmanFTB","Mar 22, 2013"

4.54,11.8,4,5,4.5,4,4.5,"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 9/26/2012. Pours fairly crystal clear golden amber color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of huge pumpkin pie, gingerbread, cinnamon, nutmeg, brown sugar, clove, caramel, pie crust, and light herbal. Insanely amazing aromas with outstanding balance, complexity, and strength of malt and spice notes. Taste of pumpkin pie, gingerbread, nutmeg, cinnamon, clove, brown sugar, pie crust, caramel, and light herbal. No bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of pumpkin pie, gingerbread, nutmeg,cinnamon, light clove, brown sugar, pie crust, and light herbal on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic flavor balance and complexity; with an outstanding balance of malt and spices; and zero cloying sweetness present after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium full bodied; with a slick and lightly syrupy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is extremely well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a world class pumpkin ale. Incredible balance and complexity of malt, pumpkin, and spice flavors; and insanely easy to sip on. A very incredible pumpkin ale offering, and one of the best ever made without a doubt.","superspak","Feb 15, 2013"

Aroma is graham cracker crust, pumpkin pie spices, and vegetable sweetness. Big sweetness up front is followed by mouth coating spices. Like drinking liquid pumpkin pie. No perceptible alcohol. Mouthfeel is exceptional. Smooth and creamy, just a little sweater and it would be cloying. First time reviewing Pumking after having it numerous times. Among the best pumpkin beers available. Big and bold like Southern Tier does best. I can see how some would be put off by Pumking, its a love/hate beer.","spark3148857","Dec 16, 2012"

After weeks of searching and kicking the cats I stumbled onto it. My favorite place to go for ribs is Twin Anchors. There may be better ribs but not better establishments. By accident last week I stumbled in and found my self looking at their beer menu. """Hey, bartender, it says here that you have Pumpking here""".

4.04,-0.5,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Poured into a snifter from the bottle, Pumpking was a copper color with a very slight off-white head. It leaves a generous lacing around the glass to note staying power. The aroma is graham cracker, cinnamon, nutmeg, and pretty much everything else about pumpkin pie except pumpkin. In the initial taste, one get sour pumpkin, cinnamon toward the back of the throat, a heavy dose of clove, and a hint of nutmeg. One gets a little of the sliminess of pumpkin in the mouthfeel and a certain degree of acidity in the slightly thicker than average ale. For my money, I think this is the best pumpkin ale you can buy despite a lack of pumpkin in most phases of the beer. It is a polarizing beer to many because pumpkin is masked to a great degree. Allow the other elements of pumpkin pie appear nicely though.","JohnnyHopps","Nov 22, 2012"

This ale poured a dark orange color, produced a thick white head and produced an above average amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma consisted of canned pumpkin, spices, namely cinnamon and nutmeg. Full bodied, this pumpkin ale had a sweet malted grain base, brown sugar, vanilla bean cinnamon and nutmeg. I am a big fan of Pumpkin Ales, and while I dont dislike this brew, i do think that the amount of spices used was out of balance. To much cinnamon, in conjunction with the brown sugar- Average.","GossageBrewery","Nov 07, 2012"

Much different than many pumpkins that lean too heavily on ginger or cinammon, I enjoy an allspice-like taste to the beer.

Fantastic aroma that just keeps your nose coming to take a whif. Obviously notes of pumpkin, nutmeg and seasonal spices. The taste follows the nose closely, but adds a tart finish that can be a little distracting. Like most Souther Tier beers, it's pretty over the top with flavor, which can make it unsessionable. Otherwise, it's a true pumpkin beer. Feel is what you would expect. Lots of carbonation and has a dry feel. A bit thin, but decent to medium. Overall- A very interesting, true pumpkin beer. The smell is out of this world and the taste is pretty solid. I wish it were a bit less tart on the finish and more sessionable. True to the ST roots of flavor.

This year, pumking jumped in and suddenly everyone was asking me where to find it, if I could get it on tap, etc. It was nowhere to be found, as if all the bars with access to that particular distributor hogged up the limited supply for my area. When all hope was lost for us to even TRY it so see why it is in such demand, one of my buddies found a ridiculously decent supply at a local and very unassuming store that will for now remain nameless. Best pumpkin ale I've ever had, flat out. Whatever gives it the cookie sweet aroma and balance of flavor is what wins. 8.6 abv isn't huge, but this one is still extremely drinkable. Take me away, lord Puca.","hustlesworth","Oct 15, 2012"

The beer is not heavily spiced and really resembles a piece of pumpkin pie. There is a creaminess to the flavor to balance the pumpkin notes. Rich and way too drinkable for the abv. A very tasty treat. I have enjoyed this beer with pumpkin muffins but I would match this beer with other non pumpkin desserts to fully appreciate the ale and dessert.

I don't know what the prominent spice is in this beer (is it nutmeg?), but it is so overpowing that it covers up any semblance of pumpkin backbone.

But they were right. This is the best pumpkin ale I've ever had, and I had basically given up on the style. The pumpkin component is right and the spices are deftly done and the accompanying flavors and aromas evoking buttery baked goods are just delicious. The whole thing is beautiful. If I had any way to make it better, I might make it a bit heavier and more robust. It was lighter than expected. Still very good though.","BrownNut","Sep 15, 2012"

Less hops this year, but creamier and smoother and the alcohol is almost non-existent on the tap version. What a superb beer I will enjoy over the next 2 months.

4.08,0.5,5,4.5,4,3,4,"The beer pours into a snifter glass like a liquid pumpkin, a beautiful murky orange with amber hints and a little white ring of small white bubbles that leave lazy lines of lacing on the glass. There is a nice steady flow of bubbles and odd enough, there is one spot on my glass where a straight line of bubbles is consistently running up the side of the glass. The beer smells like a pumpkin pie, pulpy with pumpkin meat and spicy with nutmeg, cinnamon, and clove. Sweet and caramel malts could be hiding in the back of the smell but they seem pretty light overall. The beer’s taste follows the nose; it’s a little cloying with the spices which leave a burn on the tongue but overall this beer is a liquid pumpkin pie. The meat tastes a little raw on the tongue and the spices are a little too potent but it comes together in a lovely sip. Mouthfeel is a little fierce with rapid pinpricks of carbonation on the tongue, but this mellows out mostly into a thin syrupy treat. Afterfeel is still tingling from the carbonation and a little burned from the spices. Overall this is a great pumpkin beer; the spice is a little too much, which holds this beer back from being amazing, but by no means stops it from being a great drink.

The appearance is orange with kind of a brown tint. It smells like pumpkin pie on Thanksgiving day while watching the Lions! I get a scent of sweet cinnamon, nutmeg and pumpkin. This world class brew tastes Exactly like it smells. It is the most flavorful pumpkin ale I have tried. It is smooth, sweet, majestic and not bitter at all!

While light and transparent, the liquid still has a bronzed metallic orange cast to it, yellows some around the rims, multiple swiftly paced beads of bubbles, good overall shine. The nose is extremely smooth and moves as if there simply couldn’t be a bump in the road, molasses, cinnamon, glazed piecrust, whipped cream, even some chocolate and nuttiness, the sweet spices here mask some of the pumpkin foundation, hint of fig or apricot fruit, strong lift without drawing attention. Medium-bodied, the carbonation is on the thin side and could arguably provide more structure. That said, has an overall dry texture even as the constituent parts are all sweet as hell. The pumpkin stronger while still paling before the clove, cinnamon spice, brown sugar, orange marmalade, crust flakes and more whipped cream and caramel. At times it seems to almost have a floral perfume. There is a loss of grip through the finish. If you want sweetness without undue heaviness, check it out.","farrago","Aug 25, 2012"

Tastes of pumpkin, spices and malt; medium mouth feel, creamy. Sweet, but is nicely balanced. One of the best pumpkin ales. Delicious.","LiquidAmber","Aug 01, 2012"

Smell is pumpkin, cinnamon and nutmeg. Taste is pumpkin, nutmeg and a little biscuity malt in the background. The feel is light with lots of carbonation with a medium-dry finish and a lingering bitterness and trace of spices. Overall this is excellent, with a nice warming alcohol finish that isn't too boozy and a nice pumpkin taste that isn't overdone.","JohnQVD","Jun 02, 2012"

4.06,0,3,4.5,4,4,4,"Poured from bomber to pint glass. No dates. Pours an opaque orange color with a thin white cap, some retention and lacing, not much though. While it may not be an impressive looking beer it smells great! Smells like a pumpkin pie. Pumpkin, chai, cinnamon, vanilla, all spice. Very good. Literally smells like a liquid pumpkin pie. The flavor continues where the nose left off, though a bit softer. The nose was so powerful I expected the flavor to be as dominant. Tastes just like the nose though a bit softer. Mild bitterness. Lighter end of medium bodied with some carbonation. Overall, a very good pumpkin beer. It would have been nice to have a more dominant flavor, but it was still very good. Hides the abv very well. Enjoyable!","hopfacebrew","Feb 21, 2012"

The nose is pumpkin and spice forward. The most pumpkin aroma I've ever smelled in a beer. Taste mirrors the nose with huge pumpkin pie flavors. Cinnamon, cloves, allspice, and brown sugar abound. There is a hint of hoppy bitterness in the finish which works well here. The beer is medium bodied with a nice mellow level of carbonation. Overall this is a quite enjoyable offering from Southern Tier. I am not normally very fond of spiced beers, but this one pulls it off in spades. Recommended.","Sideswipe","Jan 30, 2012"

There are ales that carefully balance pumpkin and spices to create a subtle, well-balanced beer, and there are ales that just try to create a total pumpkin and spice bomb. Generally, the latter is an absolute disaster, but somehow Southern Tier pulls it off. The 2011 edition of Pumking is definitely better than the 2010 edition, but 2009 was better...

This beer pours a little hazy but has a wonderfully thick head and balances itself out after leaving just a trace of lacing on the glass. I know it is a little bit on the sweet side but it is truly my favorite imperial stout. I went so far as to buy a 1/6 keg for my kegerator. I drink it out of a goblet and find that 2 or 3 beers later my life seems much less hectic. If you get a chance to try it please do. Dont let the $9 price tag on the bottle throw you.

4.19,3.2,4,5,4,3.5,4,"Wow, what a beer. Growler is a month old and just seems to have held up well. Taste compares well to a glass I had on tap. Very large and impressive head that settles after a while and leave a light covering. Some lace in spots. The smell of this one sets the bar for the style. Lots of pumpkin and spice. Nutmeg is big with allspice and cinnamon as well. A large graham crust take on the malt which is huge. This nose has me salivating and looking for ice or whipped cream. There is a faint alcohol edge that gives a mild sharpness. Taste is big pumpkin and spice. A sharpness pierces the perfect impression of pie for me, the hops combining to make a super dry and clean finish that combines with the pumpkin and spice to hang a bit too aggressively in the back of my throat. Not a deal breaker but it mars the overall smoothness of what is really a remarkable beer. The malt is so supportive and deliciously caramel bready. The pumpkin flavors fly and take wing atop this beautiful platform. Feel is surprisingly light as the flavors give notice to the weight. Carbonation just, ( I mean just ) off target as I would prefer a tiny bit more given the sugary sweetness to help break it up. Splitting hairs here. Still a good feeling beer. You are not gonna be sessioning this one, too strong, too intense. Just a great imperial pumpkin ale. Rich and yummy. Not perfect but so close that if this is as close as it gets I wont be crying.","scootny","Nov 27, 2011"

Mild hops peak out every now and then, but play a supporting role. A pumpkin beer for people who love pumpkin beers, playing a bit to the stereotypes, but getting them all right. A great pumpkin beer, but not necessarily a great beer. Liking this less the more I have it and the more time goes on, but a classic nonetheless.

Slow bubbling carbonation throughout the beer. Smells are like pumpkin bread, with a good dose of cinnamon and an overall roasted character. The beer's flavor is amazing. Sugary sweet, with a huge pumpkin and cinnamon component, as well as an underlying roasted backbone. Tastes like a pumpkin cookie right out of the oven. The aftertaste is creamy and rich, with pumpkin and buttery tones. The finish is quick and clean. Very impressive.","GarthDanielson","Nov 12, 2011"

Nice sweet nose with notes of nutmeg, pumpkin, cinnamon, toasted sugar. The mouth is moderately full. Carbonation is still good. I wasn't a huge fan of this beer fresh. I know this seems to be the standard for this style, but it was overly sweet and spiced I remember. I really liked this beer better with some age on it. The nutmeg is still there, but it is much more balanced with a mild sugary sweetness, backed up by a good pumpkin smack. I couldn't have a bomber for myself, as the flavors are a little tiring, but it was a nice beer to split with a friend in the midst of a pumpkin-carving-slaughter.","Onenote81","Oct 31, 2011"

A bit spicy on the palate towards the end of the sip with some remnants of cinnamon and nutmeg. Slightly over-sweet pumpkin flavor throughout the sip with a noticeable alcohol presence.

I find most pumpkin beers taste like beer with added pumpkin flavor, but here it is a little more distinct in giving the full pumpkin pie experience melded with beer. There is a prominent element of sweetness, more in smell than taste; however, there is a reasonably good balance with the bitterness of the hops that it’s not one dimensional. I was concerned it would be too sweet, but it’s not. I would be curious to see how this beer changes with age. Still this genre is a bit of a novelty, but this is an enjoyable seasonal release.

The primary issue I find with this beer is that I am not sure when I would want to drink it. It's too spicy to take the place of a lager/hefeweizen, but also doesn't seem like it would scratch that pale ale itch or go well with most food. Effectively, to me, this is an unabashed gimmick beer designed to be consumed at the Thanksgiving table and nowhere else, and for that purpose, it is quite good.","cragus","Oct 03, 2011"

The pumpkin flavor carries throughout the middle and finish and it leaves a crisp bite. Part of it from the carbonation and the spices.

Truly amazing aroma of ginger snaps and pumpkin pie...not subtle, but full of pleasant aromatic pumpkin and spice, just like it's supposed to be. Taste was not quite as tremendous, but still very good. The flavors were a bit more subdued than the aroma, which is just fine. A sweet malt base with a background of soft pumpkin, overlaid with vanilla, spice, and cinnamony pie crust. Gentle hop bitterness and alcohol warnth in the finish. Medium body, and very drinkable.","Rifugium","Sep 25, 2011"

The color is a clear golden orange, with a tiny head with no retention. The aroma is incredible - it's hard to believe how it truly smells like pumpkin cake, vanilla icing and all, gingerbread, graham cracker, cinnamon, etc. The taste is very similar to the aroma with a light hop finish and medium mouth feel. The alcohol is masked VERY well. How exactly do they make a beer that tastes this way? Does Willy Wonka work at Southern Tier? Truly incredible. I def. will be buying more this season. I could drink this for breakfast! In all seriousness though, this is a dessert in a glass. The only question is - is a beer supposed to even be like this? It doesn't really taste like a beer... I suppose that's what the other pumpkin ales are for.","Neorebel","Sep 25, 2011"

Each fall, I seem to stock up on various pumpkin flavored beers, eagerly searching for a similar experience. Each year, however, I seem be disappointed. Until, that is, my wife bought this beer for me. Wow. Hands down, this is the best pumpkin ale that I've ever had. It's aroma is exceptional, intense, and enchanting. The flavor is rich, layered, and nearly overwhelming. Pumpkin and spice, strength in alcohol, some malt, and near perfect balance. It does not seem at all artificial, a fault of many pumpkin beers. It's a dangerous beer, with it's high ABV, but it is also very rewarding. Great stuff.","Suds","Sep 24, 2011"

3.95,-2.7,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Pours a medium orange with a white head that fades fast. Smells like a pumpkin candle, sweet with obvious pumpkin. Small spice notes in there as well. The taste follows suit, the spice is higher in the flavor, huge pumpkin flavors up front with the ABV not hidden at all. Spice of cinnamon, vanilla, nutmeg, and a hint of clove. The mouthfeel isn't as smooth as expected, and the alcohol is somewhat harsh. Overall a very pumpkin beer, powerful flavor that could turn some away. The spices are the main focus, and are done well. A nice fall beer, could be a desert beer due to the sweetness.","wingman14","Sep 24, 2011"

5,23.2,5,5,5,5,5,"Truly, this is one of the best pumpkin ales of all time. If you're really in a mood to travel to pumpkinland this is arguably the #1 choice. I'd rate Dogfish Head's Punkin Ale at a close #2 (easier to casually down 1 or 2 of those whereas this you really need to be in the zone to take on a Pumking bomber). Punkin Ale edges out Pumking in the spice department, but Pumking takes the cake in true pumpkin pie flavor. I've had the opportunity to try several other pumpkin ales already this fall, and all were fairly decent (Smuttynose's offering probably being the best out of that batch). Where do I start with Pumking? This is not for the fainthearted first of all. This is a thick, strong concoction that will leave you feeling like you just devoured the tastiest pumpkin pie of all time. It has a good balance of spices and a thick layer of caramel. The pumpkin taste is perfect and the ABV on this bomber is 8.6% so you WILL be buzzed if you are a lightweight. Drink responsibly. The guy that orders for my area in metro Chicago failed to order these last year and I had to order them (at a high price) from a couple stores out East. This time they are not playing around, and DiCarlo's up in Mundelein managed to get like 20 cases. Let's send Southern Tier a message that this is a hit (much like Punkin Ale), and have them ship more of these bad boys out here ASAP! Cheers to all, and may you all enjoy this wonderful fall season, arguably the best time of year for beer aficionados.","reppinthe847","Sep 10, 2011"
4.24,4.4,4,5,4,4,4,"Pumpkin Ale Pours a golden amber color, with a decent size white head. The smell is strongly like pumpkin, some spices, very similar to pumkin pie. The taste is strongly similar to pumkin pie, creamy, lots of pumkins flavors, a bit of cinimmon. Good strong flavor, very nice on the palette. Overall a fantastic pumpkin ale, almost as good as dogfish head.","vette2006c5r","Sep 10, 2011"
4.12,1.5,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Pours an orange color w/ a bubbly thin off white head. Good carbonation, not much in the way of lacing. Beer is very clear, and easy to see through. Nose is fantastic, although a little sweet for my taste. Pumpkin, caramel, gingerbread, vanilla. If I closed my eyes I would swear I was smelling a piece of pumpkin pie. Taste is fairly close to the nose, but the spices (nutmeg, cinnamon) come out a little more, along w/ some malt. The taste is not quite up to the level of the nose, but it's pretty close. Still, a 4 is all I can give this category. Feel is medium, and very sweet, but it goes down smooth just the same. Very nice. Just a little on the sweet side for me. Finishes fairly wet, with a nice chestnut/nutmeg/pumpkin/cinnamon aftertaste. Overall, this is definitely a different animal than the other Pumpkin Ales I've tried. It's like literally eating and smelling a piece of pumpkin pie. You can even smell and taste the little burned areas of the graham cracker crust... Nice- I enjoyed this one.

It smells like mama's kitchen in late November around 4:47 p.m. just before the """pumking""" pie comes out of the oven.

Kind of a disappointing appearance. Smell is very complex with caramel malt, biscuits, actual pumpkin puree, and a wide array of pumpkin pie spices - cinnamon, clove, nutmeg. Taste is of malt/bread/biscuit/crust, unsweetened pumpkin puree, brown sugar, and the aforementioned spices. There is a slight spice bitterness that sticks the the tongue after each sip. This beer has a higher level of carbonation with a crisp and dry finish. Overall, this is a good pumpkin ale that is somewhat different that I was expecting.

A lack of head and lacing bring the appearance down a bit. Smells and tastes of an EXTREMELY strong pumpkin and spice, it is a bit too much for me personally but that is personal taste, it definitely lives up to the pumpkin taste and style though. It literally tastes and smells of a yankee candle pumpkin candle with a bit of malts and tiny hops, certainly dominated by pumpkin spice though. A bit too much nutmeg and sweetness in here for me. Mouthfeel is good here, the lack of head is deceiving because the beer is nicely carbonated with a creamy medium body.

While it had the a lot of the spiciness typical of this type of beer, this was just different than anything else. Sort of a pumpkin pie thing going. It was definitely on the sweeter side.

3.87,-4.7,3.5,4,4,3,4,"O: Under the Fall pumpkin style, this ranks among the top that I've ever had. Pumpkin seems like a very hard flavor to harness and Southern Tier has clearly mastered it.

Flavor is a perfect match, chewy graham cracker and sweet strong pumpkin candy. Spice level is much subdued since the fresh release, I love this beer with a bit of age on it. The light bitterness dissapears and the rich sweet pie-like character shines through. Definitely the best pumpkin beer on the market.","Tripphop","Aug 12, 2011"

Mouthfeel is smooth and slightly grainy and goes down smooth and gets tastier as it warms. As you drink down one the warmth arrives slowly as the high alcohol begins to kick in. The finish is like a full taste of pumpkin pie,including crust. It is tough to put down more than two 10 ounce goblets at one sitting as this is like drinking dessert.

Pours harvest orange with a small, fizzy, off-white head, somewhat diminishing with spare, if any, lacing. Somewhat disappointing on the lack of head or lace. Aroma is heavy malt (cookie, cereal, straw, biscuit), average hops (grass, herbs), average yeast (dough, leaves) with notes of pumpkin, cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg, and brown sugar. There is an interesting mix of lightly buttered biscuits and sugar cookies that permeates above all the typical """pumpkin beer""" spices that is rather intriguing and inviting in a raw dough kind of way. The pumpkin is not too much nor too little yet is much more present than most pumpkin beers. Medium bodied, aided by the uncharacteristically high alcohol content, alcoholic texture, average carbonation that fizzles away rapidly, and a chalky yet dry finish. Long duration, moderate sweetness, acidity, and bitterness. I am quite taken by this pumpkin beer as it seems to nail the one thing others cannot - it gives the pumpkin flavor along with spices (typical) but also adds a freshly baked crust to the aroma and flavor.","CuriousMonk","Jan 27, 2011"

The flavors were just amazing. Homemade pumpkin pie in a bottle. The pumpkin tasted fresh ,the spices all present but well balanced, the creaminess of the mouthfeel conducive to a pie-like experience. Wow. The alcohol was also well concealed.

The pumpkin in it is really strong that it almost doesn't taste like real pumpkin, almost a bit chemically. Very strong spices as well and I thought I tasted a bit of mint.

Pumking was a vibrant orange with a fiercely spicey nose. it smelled like cloves cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger spice and off freshly roasted sweet pumpkin. The beer tasted like a caramelly sweet piece of ginger bread with a lot of spice, maybe too much and there was a little butterscotch, which might be a flaw normally went well in this beer. The only fault that I can find in this beer is the over utliization of spices which infiltrates every square milimeter of my mouth and lingers on.

Medium bodied with fine carbonation that makes it feel soft and fluffy in the mouth. I like pumpkin beer, but only in small doses. A 6'er of DFH Punk, for example, took a few months for me to finish last year. Considering this is like pumpkin beer on steroids, this was shockingly easy to drink.

4.44,9.4,4,5,4.5,4,4,"Southern Tier is my hometown brewery and I was fortunate enough to get this from a trade with an old friend. Nice clear, orange pour with a pretty quickly fading head and decent lacing. The huge smell is totally incredible when you consider it's beer. I've had plenty of pumpkin beers, but none of them smelled like this. Sugary, spicey, with tons of caramel and the fresh pumpkin pie aroma is awesome. The taste is much the same as the smell. Big and complex. Lots of cinnamon, brown sugar, nutmeg and the most authentic pumpkin pie flavor ever in a pumpkin beer. And the best thing is that Southern Tier does all this without making it sickly sweet like most pumpkin beers I've tried. Very smooth with just the right amount of carbonation. It's sweet, but the bitter hop bite offsets that and reminds you that it's beer. I had totally forgotten that this was a 9% Imperial until I reviewed it. Southern Tier is arguably the best at disguising high alcohol beers. Drinkability is huge when you consider this is more of a dessert beer and an Imperial.

In any event, this is hands down the best pumpkin ale I've tried. I think I spent more time with my snout hovering over the tulip glass than I spent actually drinking it! The aroma is perfect with great nutmeg, cinnamon, and clove notes. Smells, and to a large extent tastes, just like a pumpkin pie. Could have used a little more head (could have been a bad pour), and the head could have been a little creamier. Aside from that, delicious. Rarely do I feel that I can drink two fruit beers back-to-back, but I certainly could have done so with the Pumpking...that is, if I didn't have a Breakfast Stout on deck.","littleshovel","Nov 09, 2010"

The taste offers similar tasty ideas with allspice, graham cracker and squash/pumpkin """malted""" together for a desert-like medley. Deliciously unveiled in a medium bodied brew with modest carbonation that gives a mellow mouthfeel with fair drinkability at best.

The aroma is spicy as well, the pumpkin and additional spices blending with spicy hops. The taste follows suit. I'm going to go ahead and declare this the best pumpkin beer I've had this year. Pumpkin (meat, not spice) dominates this beer. There's that great vegetable sweetness, and if I'm not mistaken, there's some caramel as well. Unlike many pumpkin beers, the spice here takes much more of a supporting role, rounding out the sweetness and serving as an effective substitute for bitter hops to clean up the finish. Sweetness does linger a bit, but believe me, that's a good thing. It stays very drinkable throughout, with no hint of the rather hefty alcohol content.

Smell was very autumn inspiring with a mixture of ginger snaps and eggnog yeilding a big, complex nose. The taste is similar to the smell with that ginger snap foward taste and a bitter finish from the hops on the sides of the tonuge.

The pumpkin was too short lived before it was shoved aside and overwhelmed by the hops, which took center stage, leaving just the spice in the end.

This beer on the other hand is really something extraordinary, it truly smells like home made pumpkin pie, right down to the bready note of pie crust. This aroma is remarkable and quite pleasant, but I am still not sure it makes for a good beer. The flavor is a bit of a mess with heavy toast and musty hops that just don't make me feel like I want to finish the bomber sitting in front of me. In the end, I have to regard this as an interesting technical exercise rather than a normal beer.

This pours with a perfect burnt orange tone as if it were straight out of the patch. It has a sugar/spice pumpkin scent that stirs up Trick or treat nostalgia and has a taste to match that emotion.

More pumpkin forward than I was expecting in taste as well. Has a nice spice mix to balance the pumpkin. I like the creaminess as well, really feels almost like a hint of whipped cream is there. Alcohol is well masked considering the ABV and the beer goes down easy. Can't say that I would want the entire 22oz beer myself, but it's perfect for sharing the bomber.

It is a very light amber orange color with a 1 inch white foamy head. The smell was unique and not what I expected. I thought I would get more of that spicy cinnamon pumpkin / seasonal smell. Instead, it smelled more like fresh pumpkin. First taste was really nice. It tasted exactly like it smells and I really enjoyed that fresh pumpkin flavor. But, after about half a pint, I grew tired of the taste and decided the pumpkin was overwhelming. I let it sit for a while, cleansed my palate and dove back in. Again, after a few sips I was tired of it. How am I going to finish this bomber? At least it was smooth and the carbonation was just right.

The smell is fantastic! It smells like pumpkin bread, it's making me salivate thinking about it right now. That translates into an aroma consisting of a bready yeast smell affixed with the actual pumpkin smell and the pumpkin spices which seem to be all-spice, nutmeg, clove, cinnamon and perhaps a hint of ginger. The taste however is a giant let down from the smell. While it's not foul in anyway I expected to drink pumpkin bread and I'm not, probably shoulda seen that from the color. The taste is clearly of the pumpkin mixed with a booze flavor that is more consistent with vodka than anything. After the pumpkin vodka flavor you get the aftertaste of the spices and that is all that you are left with. The carbonation is nice and crisp on the tongue which helps dilute the alcohol flavor. If you're in the mood for pumpkin ale definitely buy this, it's pretty damn good. I warn you, you must be in the mood for this to really dig it.","Vdubb86","Sep 16, 2010"

About 2 seconds in you start to taste gingerbread/graham cracker crust of the pie. The aftertaste is even more pleasing, leaving you feeling like you just ate a slice of pumpkin pie.

This is the first one that is a miss for me. I don't know how to use it... It could be a dessert beer but I don't have the audience that would like this type of highly spiced flavor for a pumpkin pie.

The interplay of the spices on the tongue was simply heavenly. If I closed my eyes, I could envision Thanksgiving dessert. Therein lies its Achilles heel - it is a novelty/dessert beer.

It did have a sweet aroma to it, but you could actually smell pumpkin to it with some malts. Very nice, I really liked it. The taste is much like the smell, it has a very bold taste. Again you could taste the pumpkin, almost natural followed by some sweet hints of pumpkin pie spices. I would have given the taste a much higher rating but it had an earthy aftertaste that I wasn't very fond of. I found both the mouthfeel and drinkablility to be good.

The taste is the same, spices right away and pumpkin. The taste pretty much explodes in your mouth, one of the most pumpkiny beers I've had. I've heard this one is like drinking liquid pumpkin pie and now I believe it. Very flavorful, it's everything autumn in a beer. A high ABV one this one but I didn't notice it a bit.

The aroma is clearly of pumpkin spices but there is a lot more to it including sweet brown sugar, malts, and maybe even some butternut squash. More creaminess to the mouthfeel but overall it tends to be heavier and appealing. The taste is quite unique. It has this odd mixture of sweet and sour like an Oriental restaurant. There is also a tartiness to the overall experience. This is quite unique and one of a kind. This also has a bit of a punch at 9% ABV. Highly recommended.

I don't detect the alcohol or the hops in the smell at all, even though the bottle claims that the hops are there. they are lost. the flavor of the beer is overwhelmed with spice. I realize that this is the point of these beers. There is an odd aftertaste of nutmeg. I'm pretty sure it was nutmeg. I don't really detect any OBVIOUS pumpkin in the flavor. There is a bright sweetness in the beer that I feel blocks out the pumpkin flavor. If I concentrate I can detect it, but it is not forward.

I'm so longing for those crisp cool afternoons with college football and a warm hoodie. They say the olfactory senses are the most linked to memory. This beer is like a scrap book of autum. The flavor is a tad less of a memory kicker. Pumpkin flavor is there but, I'm getting more vanilla and a smooth nuttiness. I taste clove and nutmeg which is a given in anything pumpkin. At least if it wants to feel like pumpkin. The alcohol is very present with a nice warming effect that is felt with every sip.

It pours a crystal-clear copper, with medium carbonation, and a finger of tan head that attempts to lace the glass. Lots and lots of pumpkin in the nose, along with spices and toasted graham cracker. The aroma refuses to quit. Fairly similar flavor, with notes of vanilla, nutmeg and cinnamon complementing the pumpkin rather than overwhelming it. There's a breath of alcohol at the start, but this airs out over time. In addition, there is a light sweetness, and some late hop bitterness that is a touch high, but necessary for proper aging. Not too heavy on the palate, with decent carbonation and a nice finish. This is a pretty delicious brew, delivering probably the most authentic pumpkin pie flavor of any in the style, going so far as to include the graham cracker crust. It also seems engineered for aging - what with the higher-than-average alcohol and bitterness. I'm quite confident the flavor will mature and improve over a year or two, by which time this will be a divine autumn beverage.","mmmbeer","May 04, 2009"

Pours an orange amber with little head. Smells and tastes of pumpkin custard with a brulee crust and roasted pumpkin seeds. There is an eggy richness to this beer and the carmelized sugars are so deep and rich they taste burnt. This beer definitely shares some characteristics with Creme Brulee fro The same brewery, but it isn't nearly as unctous nor as sweet as that beer. Thee notes of roasted punpkin seeds adds a savory, almost salty nuttiness to the equation. The spice notes are also a bit different with lots of mace and nutmeg and little to no cinammon. There are also some squash-like flavors from the pumpkin and the pumpkin also adds some silkiness to the mouthfeel.

Up front there are strong cinnamon and brown sugar notes, widening to the promised bourbon. The interesting part comes at the end of your palate, where a cleansing hoppiness comes through to finish the sip and cleanse your palate. Without this hoppiness, the beer would be too sweet. With it, it's a fascinating, well-balanced, and extremely complex beer that made me do a double take. Every sip is a journey.

The flavor is too overpowering to continually enjoy unfortunately. I sampled this beer at the Publick House in a paddle and found that was the right amount. After finishing my paddle I ordered a proper pint and halfway through wished that I didn't. I love this beer but I could not drink more then 1 at a time.

Pumking, however, raised my eyebrows a bit. Nice golden color with lots of spice on the nose, especially vanilla. Enjoyable mouthfeel though the alcohol is very present to the point of almost being metallic. I do hope that vanilla is not synonomous with pumpkin spice, as there was a lot of vanilla in the taste and I kept waiting for the pumpkin spice to take over. Instead, the spice hung around on the edges apparently lacking the self esteem to take the floor. 9% ABV to me means sipping and I was more in the mood for good pumpkin thirst quenching, but that is what it is.","Maerzen","Sep 21, 2008"

A nice switch from the barley wines and RIS that will be consumed this fall, but be warned, it's much more like the pumpkin pie aspect than it is a brew with mild spicy pumpkin background.

Poured a scarlet red/brown with a nice soft ¼ inch head on top. Smelled spicy, but in a sweet, freshly baked way rather than just of spices in a bowl. Nutmeg, cloves and cinnamon are all strong on the nose, particularly the cloves, which makes it smell like an old English Christmas drink. Taste is great....all the spices again, but mixing with a nice malty sweetness that backs up the spice supremely well. Slight roasted, biscuity quality.

It is smooth, medium-bodied, with some pepper and clove tucked behind a massive rush of pumpkin, cinnamon, hazel and a touch of bread. This is pumpkin pie to me.

It's extremely bready as the rice note dissipates. Really solid for a pumpkin ale, I have to say. On the palate, the breadiness really flourishes with the spices evident but never cloying and a warm sweetness to give both a pumpkin bread flavor and to cover the abv.

It was watery with no carbonation, and had a lasting but mellow pumpkin aftertaste. Overall this was definitely pumpkin, but not definitely beer.

This is definitely not your typical pumpkin beer aroma. Instead of the bombardment of spices, this beer has some depth to the nose. It's very earthy and vegetal and smells the most like actual cooked PUMPKIN than any other beer I've smelled. And graham cracker. Big graham cracker notes. The nose is so strong and intriguing. I just keep picking it up to resmell again and again. It really grows on me and I like the aroma more and more. The spices on the nose are secondary and quite suitable. I get a little cinnamon and fresh nutmeg. The beer tastes like it smells. But I pick up some clove and ginger on the buds as well. Again, the spicing is fairly light, which is good. Then the cooked pumpkin base and crystal like maltiness can do their thing. Graham cracker maltiness is huge. Vanilla bean, pistachios and a little nougat add complexity. The alcohol is hidden quite nicely. For an imperial pumpkin ale, this does not feel """imperial""" in an alcholic sense. The body is medium to medium-full. I'd have to say this is one of the best (and easily the most intriguing) pumpkin ales I've had.

Aromatics caramel roasted nutty brown sugar with melted butter, whipped cream, and an air of popcorn Jelly Belly jellybeans. Spices and alcohol are flowing as well but the nutmeg, allspice combo don't stick out as much compared to other pumpkin ales out there. Flavors bring to mind pumpkin chiffon pie with pumpkin puree', cinnamon, allspice, and nutmeg with a whipped cream sweetness but once again that buttery popcorn flavor came out thank god my portion was a 12oz snifter. Alcohol enters the mix with a smooth burn, but it's hard to get over that """circus peanut""" candy marshmallow creaminess it just gets cloying. Mouthfeel is full bodied syrupy sticky with residual sugars creamy bodied with even carbonation flows decently well in small sips. Drinkability is for me an absolute dessert only beer really hard to throw this into a drinking session, plus the high abv can stick it to ya. I applaud the effort to be original with the pumpkin ales but this extreme imperial effort fell short compared to the rest of Southern Tier beers on the market.","WVbeergeek","Oct 23, 2007"

The mouthfeel has a nice body but not too rich or thick and not too thin or watery, just right.

This one smells like a freshly baked pumpkin pie and I feel like I can put whip cream on the top of this one. Taste is heavily sweet with all the above aromas now tickling the palate.

Left it in the fridge just long enough to get a slight chill, then poured into a pair of tumblers. The golden-copper ale poured nicely, bringing out a half-inch of cream head, which faded quickly to a slight lacing. The appearance alone had reminded me of my aunt's pumpkin pie, with a dollop of whipped cream. The smell only enhanced that sensation. Nutmeg, cinnamon, allspice, ginger, and PUMPKIN. This was a glass of freshly baked pumpkin pie. The pumpkin flavor takes a backseat to all the spices. Nutmeg and cinnamon come out strongest at first, with a light malty hint, and a clove aftertaste dances on your tongue after the beer has left your mouth. The creamy ale is not too bold in any one respect, and feels quite pleasant in the mouth, and going down. It's hard to tell with all the spices that this is an imperial. This should be enjoyed as the dessert to your Thanksgiving meal. And just like said dessert, you shouldn't have too much of it.

This must be where the """imperial""" name comes in, as it seems to be a notch more that other beers. The taste is what I expected from a good pumpkin beer, and it's only amplified by the smell.

Wow, on the tongue it's very creamy and tastes like real pumpkins unlike most others of the style that seems to be very artificial. Amazing spices makes the taste of this like I'm eating my very own grandma's pumpkin pie. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a decent amount of carbonation. I have absolutely no clue where the 9% abv comes from, but I can easily put this one down. No artificial flavors, no overpowering spices or pumpkin flavors, Southern Tier has perfected this style.

The brew is a deep copper color with a small head that falls to a light coating over top. Clarity is excellent and there are a few bubbles in the liquid. The aroma is really giving me impressions of corn. Sweet cornbread, creamed corn, maybe some butternut squash with a mild to moderate nutmeg spice. These are all corn aromas I really enjoy, so it is not bad, just not what I am expecting from a pumpkin brew. The flavor brings definite pumpkin flesh flavors, but this one has a lot more sweetness that I can attribute to the pumpkin than others in the ilk. It still just strikes me as cornbread and creamed corn. The spicy nutmeg comes through well into the finish, and there is just a hint of bitterness on the finish which compliments the nutmeg. Mouthfeel is moderate with a solid moderate carbonation of fine bubbles. This is a nice brew. I like the contrast in how the pumpkin is manifested in this one, as a more sweet flavor. I just can't get away from the corn description on this one. A fine brew.","kmpitz2","Sep 23, 2007"

It's almost overwhelming, but then the pureed pumpkin and the pie spices come through. Not a very balanced beer, but there's a lot to play with - and that's to be expected from a Pumpkin Ale. As we kept smelling the beer, one of the guys finally pointed out that the sweet smell is like the dollop of whipped cream on the pie. He couldn't be more right! The tastes really line up with the aromas. You could seriously pour this beer into a pie tin and call it pumpkin pie. Strong flavors of the pumpkin and the spices (cinnamon, nutmeg, clove), plus the creamy sweetness of the whipped cream. A bit bready (the crust, perhaps?), plus a slightly burnt flavor at the end, like burnt sugar. Medium creaminess to the beer - not as thick as a stout, but very creamy for an ale.
