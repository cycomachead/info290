3.52,-3,3.5,4,3.25,3.5,3.5,"Not sure where all of these SPH beers are coming from all of a sudden, but I'm not one to argue, especially when a new pumpkin beer is involved.  This stuff pours a clear golden-amber topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam.  The nose is a blast of thoroughly sweet pumpkin pie spices, all of which are undercut by a strong (and sweet) vein of caramel.  The taste focuses on nutmeg, clove, and brown sugar, with the caramel being replaced by dried maple syrup, draining the majority of the sweetness from the proceedings, leaving only spice, spice, and more spice without any point.  The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel.  Overall, a generally solid pumpkin spice beer, though the heft of the spice on the tongue relative to all else will likely keep me from re-indulging in this during future pumpkin seasons.","TMoney2591","Dec 24, 2014"

Solid pumpkin with spicy cinnamon on the aftertaste. However, the taste seems incompatible with the mouthfeel, which rushes the flavor profile. Warming doesn't seem to take the pop feel out of it. Sad, because it comes across as good balanced pumpkin pie flavor, not too sweet with a good amount of bitterness from the squash. It looks light, feels light, and makes light of full aroma and flavor.","orcrist_cleaver","Apr 29, 2014"

Pours lightly hazy orange copper color with a 1 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg, gingerbread, toast, clove, brown sugar, toffee, light vanilla, and toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of pumpkin, spice, and malt notes; with good strength. Taste of pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg, gingerbread, toast, clove, brown sugar, toffee, light vanilla, and toasted earthiness. Lingering notes of pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg, gingerbread, toast, clove, brown sugar, and light toffee on the finish for a short bit. Good balance and complexity of malt, spice, and pumpkin notes; with decent flavor robustness and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and moderately crisp mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very good pumpkin ale. Lacking some robustness of flavors; but has very well balanced flavors and is a nicely enjoyable pumpkin ale offering.","superspak","Oct 29, 2013"

Taste follows the nose, with just a slight pumpkin flavor coming through, mainly the cinammon and allspice, definitely more mellow than some other pumpkin beers I've had. A little on the thin side, moderate/high carbonation, and a slighly dry finish. This is an easy to drink pumpkin beer, solid tasting, but maybe not worth the expense a bomber.

A very spicy little ale with just the right amount of hotness to it. The cinnamon was particularly strong and had a great effect on the flavor. Very nice light body and ample carbonation made it go down very easily.

Pours typical, semi cloudy dark amber, under a moderate tan head, that left spotty lacing and some tongues of sheeting. Nose is of ripe fruit, apricots and subtle fall spicing. Taste here is of a high quality, pumpkin, apricot, apple pie or tart. Soft fruity goodness, with no sweet sugary distractions.

Aside from the fantastic aroma & great color it, to me, has a lot of characteristics that one might glean from a single malt. In that I do like single malts, to me this is a good thing. The spice bite, sweet caramels, faint burnt aspects, all add up to a very nice beer and a great cool weather one. Ironically, I don't see this going with pumpkin pie, but the cinnamon & sweet malts could make for a nice foil to some spicy fare (Spanish/Thai/Middle East) as well as sharp taste like certain onions, dry aged cheeses. Actually, this might pare really well with a number of Middle Eastern dishes. Pleasantly surprised.

It has a light pumpkin flavor along with a slight cinnamon/nutmeg/allspice finish. It's light and highly drinkable, but not as bold a taste as I was hoping for. It goes down easy with good carbonation, but finishes dry and with medium bodied. I prefer a more full bodied pumpkin beer that makes a bolder statement.

Flavor comes off creamy with pie filling sliding across the palate in liquid form quite the novel idea right??? (yeah I know but these Southampton guys pull it off a little better than most). Spicy layers with those same spices noted in the nose and bready roast malt layers leaves traces of caramel and more pumpkin pumpkin flavor almost vegetable in nature. Mouthfeel is even with smooth creamy carbonation definitely medium bodied brew but damn it goes down with ease.

4.3,18.5,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"22 oz bomber. The beer departs the bottle a goldened amber color with a finger off white head that settles to a half-finger over top. A setady stream of carbonation is seen hitting the surface of the brew, and clarity is superb. Inhaling over the glass brings me aromas of allspice, nutmeg, and pumpkin. I definately get some of the pumpkin fleshyness in there, make this one a lot like a nice pumpkin pie. This smells like a nice brew. Flavors present are really nice. The pumpkin hits first, followed with allspice and cinnamon, but finishing with a little kick from some spicey hop and a very mild bitterness. This is the first pumpkin ale that I have detected the hopping in the flavor and finish, and I think it really adds a nice component to the beer that compliments the spicing really nicely. I never would have thought that the bitterness would work in this style, but it is great. Mouthfeel is moderate with a light to moderate carbonation. It appears to have lost most of the carbonation after being poured, but retains enough to give it a nice bubble. This is definately a fine example of a pumpkin beer. The hopping really makes this one a cut above in my book.","kmpitz2","Nov 08, 2006"

The aroma is very mild, but the pumpkin spices are present - nutmeg and allspice seem to be the most dominant. The flavor is very clean and refreshing. The spices are all there and they meld together very well to form a mild, but constant spice profile. The actual pumpkin character escapes me here, but the spices lend to that flavor enough for me. The spices hang onto the palate for a long while. The body is moderate and the drinkability is good. Very pleasant pumpkin beer.","clvand0","Nov 07, 2006"

A very smooth drinking pumpkin brew and one I will look for in the future. Not as pumpkiny as some others I have but that is actually welcomed. If you like this type give it a try, think you will be happy.

Nice, aromatically, considering it is a pumpkin ale. Authentic pumpkin aromas, with light cinnamon and allspice. Flavor is heavily pumpkin accented, with very little spice, cinnamon and allspice.

In looking at my cask review, the clove was in this version, but not as prevalent, nor was the mouthfeel as full and soft. This had a creaminess, but the carbonation was more prickly on the tongue.
