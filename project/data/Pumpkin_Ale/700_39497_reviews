"Totally cinnamon in the nose and mouth. Dark brown with a modest head. Left most of a 12 oz glass on the bar. On tap at Elysian Fields [from notes at April 2014 visit]."
""
"Smell is amazing.   Great beer!"
""
"Elysian definitely nails their pumpkin beers- the pumpkin is spot on, but the cinnamon is a little too dominant to give higher marks."

"Overall: Very good beer. Keeps a nice balance between stout characteristics and pumpkin."

"A cinnamon bomb.  Really good though."
"Basically too much cinamon powder"
""
"Considering this as a slightly unusual stout, I really like this.   It's a much better beer than most of the pumpkin ales out there.   It doesn't fit a pure style niche, but more power to Dick Cantwell for his originality."
""
"Pours a handsome pitch black with a mocha or chocolate colored head of creamy foam that lasts and adorns the glass. The nose is cinnamon and nutmeg. A faint bit of allspice and a light fragrant ginger to really perk up the nose. The malt on the nose is roasty but biscuity too. Creamy and smooth smelling even on the nose. There is a faint bit of light chocolate and that is a surprise.  Pumpkin scent is hard to find but it's there.  taste is heavy with cinnamon.  The body is creamy adn the malt is impeccable. The roast is deep and flows freely. At the back palate there is a slight bitter from that roast that is so lovely.  The spices are all there but I wish I could taste more pumpkin.  Cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg, clove and ginger.  The chocolate flavor seems to smooth out this beer without really taking center stage. The mouthfeel is creamy and silken.  There should not be any alcohol on this palate at only 6.5 percent but there is a twinge of it in the finish. There is a slight hop bitterness that takes the tongue for a brief moment before this one finishes dry and with that lovely dry pie crust to linger and that very dominant cinnamon."

"This beer is nasty. I could drink only a few sips of it. Way too cinnamony and bitter and just ugh. Very disappointing."
""
""
""
"O: I would call this a cinnamon stout and nothing else.  The cinnamon was far too strong for my taste, but as the beer warmed it actually smoothed out, both in aroma and taste.  Then again my taste buds could have been slowly dying.  Bonus tip: pairs quite well with Oreos.  Not my favorite beer, but glad I tried it.  I'm very much looking forward to Punkuccino tomorrow which I think will be more up my alley.  3.5/5"

"Overall:   So how does this stack up against the other Elysian pumkpin beers (except for Owl, which I have not yet tried)?  I was disappointed by The Great Pumpkin, which I thought was too bitter, boozy, and had an artificial and chemical-like flavor to it.  Dark O' is smooth and natural.  The characteristics are different from Punkuccino, but I feel this beer is equally as strong for its own reasons.  Both noses are highly spicy.  Dark O' provides a burst of cinnamon, while Punku has a broader fall spice profile including nutmeg, allspice, and of course, coffee.  This is a great stout, with warming characteristics brought out by the up front notes of cinnamon.  One of the more unique pumpkin ales I have had that manages to balance spice nicely with a solid stout base."

"Rich aroma and complex taste accented by pumpkin. It's balanced and enjoyable but the thin feel is slightly distracting."
""
""
""
""
"Great stout, cinnamon hits you up front, but it is never overpowering or off-putting.  Notes of chocolate and coffee throughout, subtle notes of pumpkin on the finish.  It is like drinking coffee, chocolate French toast."

"Pours a black color. 3/2 inch head of a tan color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of pumpkin, nutmeg, slight all spice, slight ginger, and sweet malt. Fits the style of a Pumpkin Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of pumpkin, nutmeg, ginger, sweet malt, roasted malt, and hint of hop. Overall, great appearance, good aroma, body, and blend."

"22oz bottle poured into a goblet glass. It has a black as night body with no head to it. The smell is of chocolate, pumpkin and a hint of cinnamon. The taste has a roasty chocolaty taste up front then a little pumpkin and cinnamon come in near the finish. The mouthfeel is smooth and overall a really good version of a pumpkin and stout."
""
""
""

"This is superb. Elysian does pumpkin better than any brewery I've come across. This has a rich thick head sitting on a clear but opaquely dark brown liquid. Lots of lace and good retention. Superior aromatics bring copious amounts of chocolate and coffee as well as a thick slice of pie topped with cinnamon. The taste is much the same. It's like drinking pie and mocha together. The finish brings a graham cracker crust and earthy hop bitterness that evokes a rich cup of coffee. Not an sweet beer overall and highly sessionable. Feel is perfectly weighted with a light supple caressing of the mouth and tongue. Smoothly carbonated with just enough liveliness. This drinks like a dry Irish stout. Great beer and one to seek out often."
"While Elysian hasn’t impressed me much in the past, I was pleasantly surprised by this.  Deep and Dark, the beer pours a deep black with little to no head.  Smells of pumpkin, cinnamon, and some smokey malts.  Flavor is great.  A smooth balance of pumpkin, baking spice, and a lingering smokiness form the patent malt.  The flavors pass back and forth playing a perfect balance.  The mouthfeel is spot on, smooth and slick, but not oily. "

"Love at first sip--an absolute explosion of sweet pumpkin, savory spice, and bitter dark chocolate. I've tried a lot of different pumpkin beers this season (and several others from Elysian) and this is the one I was looking for. The feel is thick without being syrupy, the carbonation is pleasing, and the color is a deep dark autumnal red-brown. After the first few sips the malt and cinnamon dominate the palette until the beer warms up and the pumpkin shines through once more. Great ride and a great finish. Looking forward to having this again next year."

"22 ounce bottle into pint glass, 2013 release. Pours nearly opaque black color with a 2 finger dense tan head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big pumpkin, cinnamon, clove, gingerbread, raisin bread, toast, chocolate, cocoa, light roast, dark bread, and toasted earthiness. Incredible aromas with great balance and complexity of pumpkin, spice, and bready/roasted malt notes; with good strength. Taste of pumpkin, cinnamon, milk chocolate, cocoa, gingerbread, clove, raisin bread, toast, light roast, dark bread, and toasted earthiness. Minimal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of pumpkin, cinnamon, gingerbread, clove, raisin bread, toast, milk chocolate, cocoa, light roast, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance, complexity, and robustness of pumpkin, spice, and dark/roasted malt flavors; with a nice malt/spice balance and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a moderately creamy and smooth mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent pumpkin stout. All around great complexity and balance of pumpkin, spice, and malt flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"Pours a deep chocolate brown with a creamy dark beige head that left one full ring of dark lace as it settled into a frothy mass.Wow cinnamon and chocolate really jump out at ya in the nose,the cinnamon is spicy and goes well with the chocolate and roasted notes.A nice creamy feel to the beer adds to it's richness and pairs well with the flavors.Mild roast and chocolate that runs into a big dose of spicy sweet cinnamon in the finish.One of the best...if not the best pumpkin beer of any style I have had,Elysian can throw down with some pumpkin beers."

"O - Out of all the recommendations for this beer, I can't believe I never heard anyone remark on the cinnamon bomb this beer is. I barely finished my half of the bottle, and my wife had to drain pour hers. The amount of cinnamon is just rediculous."

"Poured 22oz bomber into NB globe, pours almost black with an edge of brown when held to the light, thick 2 inches of creamy beige foam on top. Cinnamon hits the nose first and mellows into a roasted chocolate and cocoa nibs aroma. Tastes the same as the nose, I get cinnamon up front with a creamy cocoa aftertaste with a bit of roast malt to bring it all together. Smooth drinker, but I wish the mouthfeel was a bit more full. Overall, I was looking forward to this beer for the last month, and am glad I nabbed a bottle. I thought maaybe my palate would have changed from last year, but if anything else thijs years batch was even better than memory served."

"Was really excited to find this one in CO, since I've been wanting to try it for a while and figured it'd never show up down here. Label is awesome, but at 6-something abv don't expect to be turning into a werewolf after drinking it or anything, just a nice, warming stout. Pours black with a cocoa colored head and looks quite tantalizing. Nose gives off a lot of cinnamon and cocoa. Taste is REALLY smoky; wife said it was like drinking a cigar and I said it was like licking an ash tray. Other than that you get cinnamon, and if the pumpkin is in there anywhere (which I'm sure it is), it really takes a back seat to the spice and smoke, which is just all up in your palate. Overall I actually liked it as a seasonal stout and found the flavor really intriguing, but would probably opt for some Night Owl or Great Pumpkin in place of this one if looking for a pumpkin beer. Also didn't think this warranted the ten dollar price tag, but still glad I got to try it."

"Had this on tap before, and having it on bottle now, I know this doesn’t age well. It is a great beer when it’s first released, and am basing the stats on that. TREAT is still way better for this style, even when DotM is at its peak."
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall is manages to present the squash smell and flavour exceptionally well and pairs that sweet and musky earthiness with toasted scents and flavours. A fuller mouth feel would enhance the experience, however still and great beer mid year to remind me of halloweens past."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is only the second pumpkin stout I have ever had, and the experience has been quite pleasing. I prefer this to the Fisherman's Pumpkin Stout. I am excited to try other Elysian pumpkin ales as well, because they seem to fall nicely in between brewers who may be too extreme with the pumpkin aspect, and those who barely make it detectable in the beer."
""
""

"O: Decent pumpkin stout but not in the same class as Pumpkinator or TREAT."
""
""

"Nice pumpkin ale. Sure did roll through the Elysian pumpkin lineup this year. This one was good."
"Overall a great stout w/ nice spice additions that don't go overboard and yet still add to the finished product"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: What a great pumpkin beer. I think pumpkin along with all it's associated spices add a lot to ale. Feelin it."
""
"O: Overall this is a good pumpkin stout. I enjoyed it however I prefer TREAT over this by a high degree. Worth a try"
""
""
""
"Certainly a unique twist on the style, but fairly well done. Generous flavor and aroma character that really blends well."
""
""
"O: Surprisingly good stuff. My expectations were low, but this one surprised me - it drinks more like a pumpkin porter than a stout, I think, but it's good. The spices don't overwhelm the beer here at all, but provide some nice additional flavor. Not sure if I could drink a lot of this (I split the bomber with a friend), but I could have easily drank the bomber and enjoyed it."
""
""
""
"O-This was a decent tasting stout, but I was a little let down by the absence of pumpkin. I have been sitting on this for about 2 months, so freshness might be an issue, but I still expected more pumpkin. Nevertheless, this was pleasantly flavored and drinkable."
"O: I definitely like the combination between the pumpkin beer character and the chocolate. I have to say this is my favorite out of the pumpkin beer series."
"Pours jet black with a brown head. In the aroma, roasty, earthy, and some spices in there. In the taste, roasty, coffee, earth, and a small mixed bag of spices. A smooth and a medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry roast and earthy coffee in the aftertaste. Earthy, roasty, and a small spice. Interesting flavors and style."
""
"One of the best pumpkin beers, and definitely the best one incorporating roasted malt. I like it even more than the Great Pumpkin."
""
""
"O - Could have passed for a porter actually. A fun example of the more extremem ends of the style but unfortunately the subtle flavors were washed out. Still enjoyable to try."
""
"Overall: pumpkin beers aren't for everyone, but this beer shows admirable restraint and balance. I think the base of a dark stout does a good job in holding up to the spicing and pumpkin. I'll have this again, next year at least!"
"Overall I really enjoyed the pumpkin ale so I guess that put my expectations too high in them using the same practice for a stout. Nothing worth dropping a 10 spot on, pity since a six pack of pumpkin would have only ran me a few dollars more..."
""
"A solid take on the style. A bit over on the bitter chocolate, but a nice blend overall."
"In the last few weeks, I've had a number of pumpkin beers from Elysian. They have all been good. Dark O' The Moon is no exception. It's a tasty, balanced pumpkin stout. It's not really exciting, but I would be happy to drink it again."
""

"While I'm not a huge fan of pumpking beers, this wasn't bad. I might even order it again, under the right circumstances."

"Pours black with a chocolaty espresso head on it. Burnt chocolate malts with a touch of pumpkin hit the nose from the glass. The taste is on par with the aromas: chocolate malts open this up. These take on a more roasted/coffee character and don't deviate from these two flavors. The spices it was claimed to be brewed with never show up on the palate. The body is medium and smooth. Overall, this is a straight up stout. I gave it marks for being a delicious stout, but it missed the whole pumpkin experience it was trying to deliver."
""
"Cheers LampertLand"
""
"Pours a dark brown to black with a cream coloredhead that froths nicely and lingers reasonably well. Good webbing on the glass walls. Smell is high on malts and some faint spice. Taste reveals a nice balance with pumpkin spices like cinnamon and nutmeg but not over powering. I appreciate the different spin on a traditional pumpkin beer but delivered with a solid stout."
""
""
""
""
""
"I really enjoyed this beer, but not for the reasons that I thought I would. Yes, it was a thick stout, with a creamy chocolate flavour and smooth malty finish. But what really jumped out at me was the pumpkin flavour: this wasn't some tame or demure pumpkin pie overtone, this was a smash of fresh pumpkin with a sprinkling of vibrant cinnamon! I'm rarely impressed by pumpkin flavour, I tend to judge the pumpkin beers more harshly than others. I'm pretty picky when it comes down to the balance of spices, and the texture of the pumpkin. The reason this one stood out to me was the freshness; the flavour seemed to jump out of the glass, as if it had just been brewed this morning. And I don't mean it was raw or harsh, it was still smooth and creamy but with a liveliness that was new to me. I will definitely be going back for another bottle of this for Halloween night."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: this is a nice stout that is very easy to drink, and the additional spiced components keep it interesting through the bomber bottle."
"you dont see a ton of dark pumpkin beers, and this is a winner. pours very dense black, almost no light coming through at all, and a quickly dying khaki head. the nose is a perfect blend of milk chocolate, vanilla, and cinnamon. pumpkin and pumpkin seed flavor are up front, squashy and a little bitter from the dark malts. cocoa and spice finish it out. the abv is perfect for this beer, its one you could drink several of, but sturdy enough to keep ya going. feel is fullest of bodies and spirited carbonation for the style. i like the effort here, a very different beer, perfect for the night of the first snowfall. leaves all frost covered, half on the trees, half on the ground. its just right."
""
""
"Served in a tulip glass, an opaque black color with a small tan head that retained well and left a bit of lacing on the glass. Dark roasty malts were the dominant factor in the nose, with lesser notes of roasted pumpkin and light spice and charcoal. The roast again took command in the taste, with any pumpkin being very subtle; dark malts, coffee, molasses, charcoal, mellow autumn spices. About medium bodied, perhaps too thin for a normal stout, but it actually worked well with this beer. Not bad overall."
"A nice stout, nothing earth shattering. Good flavors for a 6.5ABV stout though the feel is a tad thin. Would like to see more pumpkin spice."
""
"O: This beer is very easy to drink and has no traces of alcohol in the taste. It seems to be a good blend of two styles: pumpkin ale and stout."
"Full bodied with a deeply roasted presence that overpowers the subtle pumpkin presence. This is nicely complimented by the zesty spice notes but it's slightly acrid and in desperate need of some sweetness. Very dry to the point of almost tasting burnt with charred dark malt flavors, toast and espresso bean along with cinnamon, clove, allspice and pepper. Very one-dimensional with hardly any pumpkin flavor to speak of. I would have never guessed that there was any in there, it just tastes like a spicy, overly roasted stout. No alcohol hear to speak of but the harsh burnt malt and dry spice make it somewhat tough to drink."
""
"D - Unpretentious... This one is a stout first, and a pumpkin seasonal second... That's not a bad thing, but rather just a statement of fact... Not a bad beer, but not something that I would drink with regularity..."
"O: I really enjoy the pumpkin stout hybrid style, for some reason these really work for me... almost like if you combined chocolate and pumpkin pie (kind of like a derby pie). It drinks much easier than the 6.5% ABV that it is, especially since the mouthfeel is also lighter. Very enjoyable - glad I bought the Pumpkin Patch sampler pack to get this one."
"Overall: This is a good pumpkin stout, but not a good as Fishermans Friend pumpkin stout by Cape Ann Brewing."
""
""
""
"NICE, NOT MUST TRY!"
""
""
"Overall: I really enjoyed this beer...an interesting take on the pumpkin beer. The roastiness of the stout melds very well with the traditional pumpkin ale spices."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A pretty decent and tasty stout, the pumpkin adds a unique touch, but I wish there was a little more of it. If it had just a bit more pumpkin, it would be truly spectacular."
""
""
"Pours a dark, chalky brown to near black, good head and retention, decent lacing. Scent is roast with hints of char, cinnamon bark and milk-stout like sweetness. Taste, although lacking in much seasonal flavor, does combine roast and spice nicely, light lingering malt sweetness. Medium bodied, creamy with a hint of chalkyness. Solid, but not spectacular."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I am glad that this was my first try at Elysian. I look forward to drinking the Immortal IPA which is currently in my """cellar"""."
""
"Meh, didn't really think it worked. The pumpkin edge was dull overall."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a very good pumpkin stout. I appreciate the lower ABV because I feel it helps the spice and pumpkin flavors to emerge more. Too much malt would mask the sometimes subtle flavor of pumpkin. This is a great cool weather fall evening beer and would gladly consume it regularly if it was readily accessable to me."
""
"O - I was happy to see this sitting on the shelf right next to The Great Pumpkin. It would be a very good stout in it's own right, but it stands out above the rest in the pumpkin beer category. Perfect for anyone who wants solid pumpkin flavors without the cloying sweetness that come with most of them."
""
"Not my favorite under any stretch, but there aren't too many pumpkin porters that make to bottles out here. I'm glad this one does, even if there are others like I more."
""
""
""
""
"For a 6.5% stout, this had some pretty huge flavors going on. Really nice."
""
"As a stout, this beer is the right color, and has a relatively heavy mouthfeel, but otherwise it doesn't hit any of the right notes. Though only hopped to 20 IBUs, there's a surplus of bitterness from the other ingredients. It got the bitterness levels of a Russian Imperial stout but doesn't have nearly the grain bill that that style requires. Pumpkin beers are a challenging style, but they can be executed well. Bring me back to CBC's pumpkin fest!"
""

"Review from 9/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours dark, dark red amber. Thin tan head and light lacing. Dark malt aroma. Dark and toasty malts, light smoky malt, dark fruit, light chocolate with a slight pumpkin background. Finishes with pumpkin, spice and light hop bitterness. Very nice. This and the Great Pumpkin are must have annual beers for me in the fall."
"Overall this was a cool brew. I felt that the base beer is a stout or porter. Wishing for more pumpkin flavor."
""
"The beer pours a very dark brown to black color with a large tan head. The aroma has a ton of cinnamon in it, as well as some pumpkin, nutmeg and allspice. The flavor also has a lot of spices in it. I get some cinnamon, clove, allspice and nutmeg, as well as some pumpkin and quite a bit of roasted malt. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Overall a good pumpkin beer and an average stout. Not sure I'll be looking for this again next year though."
"O- Overall easily one of the best pumpkin stouts I've had. Really one of the better pumpkin beers in general. I'm glad I got the chance to try."
""
"O: Glad I tried it, worth a try, but nothing to trade for IMO."
""
""
"A little sweet, otherwise a very great brew. Very drinkable and good for the winter season."

"O- Has that Elysian texture and blend, not bold or aggressive, but not underwhelming. This years version was much better than last- a bit more complex and rich."
"O: The Great Pumpkin and Night Owl were so much better than this. I was disappointed. I really thought we had a trifecta of winners here."
"O - Nice pumpkin stout, low flavor profile."
"Mouthfeel is chalky and thick. Overall, this is a pretty decent beer. Nothing too exciting, though."
"overall: solid stuff"
"Overall one of the better pumpkin ales I have tasted, and a proper stout to boot. Worth a taste if you come across it. Even if you're not a fan of pumpkin."
"Definitely enjoyed this brew. Improved as it warmed. Looking forward to trying a heavier stout with pumpkin but I really enjoy this take on a pumpkin brew."
"Easy drinking, moderate body, low carbonation."
"All in all, a game changer for me. Didn't think much of pumpkin beers until I tried this one."
"Overall a nice smooth stout with a nice twist. Perfect for a cold October night."
"O: Well, this is a beer with cinnamon, not a pumpkin stout. Although this is a good beer, it is a stout, not a pumpkin beer."
"- My initial reaction at the pour was not so good, as I poured it heavily into a glass with little to no head or glorious mocha foam like I was expecting.. but with a good smell, and an even better taste.. the beer still holds high marks. I don't know about being worth the $9, but it would be one to buy a lot of if it were fairly priced."
"Overall I love this beer. Very subtle and doesn't club you over the head with pumpkin. More of a stout that has some pumpkin flavor then a pumpkin ale. Excellent seasonal by Elysian."
"O: Was kind of put off by the thought of pumpkin in my stout, but this is well done. I really like it. Wish it was a lot thicker but hey. Nobody makes a perfect beer."
"Thanks Ratman. Bomber poured a translucent dark brown nearly black with a lasting brown head. Aromas of dark chocolate, cinnamon, pumpkin and light coffee. Palate was medium bodied and smooth with a dry finish. Flavors of dark chocolate, cinnamon, pumpkin, light roastiness and a hint of coffee with a smooth dry lingering cinnamon finish."
"Getting through a bomber of this is a chore. Perhaps this tastes better when the pumpkin flavoring is fresher, but wear doesn't really seem to be the problem. There's just too much cinnamon. If that were dialed down a little, maybe this would be a bit more palateable."
"Overall, this is a very unique and well done beer. Once the flavor combination grows on you, it becomes very drinkable. I am going to seek this one out again..."
"D - This was shockingly gourd. Easily the best pumpkin beer I've ever had. Hopefully The Great Pumpkin is similarly good."
"Elysian Brewing Company--ELYSIAN DARK 'O THE MOON Pumpkin Stout--Stout Brewed With Pumpkin And Pumpkin Seeds And With Cinnamon Added--2010 22 oz. Bottle. 6.50% ABV. 20 IBU's? (3.75 / 5.0) Thick dark pour. No sediment. Thin mild lace light coffee head. Dark ruby obsidian black color. Interesting mild hop chocolate cinnamon front. Rich sweet roasted fruit pumpkin silky smooth complex stout body. Dry clean cinnamon spice lingering malty end. Mellows with warming. Sampled 10/3/2010. Purchased For $7.49 @ The Ballard Market 10/3/2010."
"D: Cool take on the stout style and the pumpkin spices add a nice backdrop. Hopefully this will become a year round bottled beer. I love that Elysian does all these different styles of pumpkin inspired beers."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and smooth with a foamy carbonation, very nice."
"D: Can't think of many stouts, especially local ones, with this kind of appeal to my taste buds (Alaskan Smoked Porter comes to mind). Though DotM isn't at the ASP level for me, it has really good flavor and a beautiful feel in a very attractive brew; Elysian packs plenty besides 'pumpkin' and 'stout' into this 'Pumpkin Stout'. A seasonal that's DEFINITELY worth hunting down - I'll be on the prowl next year. Thanks for the bottle, Jon!"
"Overall a nice beer, and a good stab at a pumpkin stout. If you like this beer, definitely try and get your hands on Midnight Suns Imperial Chocolate Pumpkin Porter (now called """TREAT""") It is a similar beer, but much more balanced and perfected. That being said, i dont want to take anything away from this brew, as its an ok shot at a dark pumpkin beer, just needs a little work around the edges i'd say."
"Poured a deep black with a small, short lived tan head. The aroma was overwhelming chocolate and heavy malts. The taste is pretty good. The initial taste is sweet and consists of cinammon. This changes to a deep chocolate and heavy malt taste. Carbonation was medium and the beer laced the entire glass. A very good adaptation to the pumpkin beers that I am used to."
"A bit thin, but a decent stout. Thanks."
"Poured a black color with good carbonation and a brown head. Nose is faint chocolate, roasted malt, espresso but really no pumpkin, cinnamon or spice. Taste is creamy, bitter chocolate, coffee, some cinnamon and very faint pumpkin. Mouthfeel is nice with bitter chcolate and creamy. While I love Elysian, I was looking for more pumpkin in this pumpkin stout."
"Next!"
"Goes down smooth and easy."
"Overall this was different and definitely unique. I would have no trouble going there again and think they have done a really nice thing with this one."
"Drinkability is pretty good, if you're in the mood for going festive, but don't like the usually insipid, thin spice bombs that call themselves 'pumkin' ales, then this is a decent choice."
"The flavor also has a substantial amount of chocolate to it, and the pumpkin is again subtle. A little cinnamon is evident and I detect some spicy character on my tongue, but I can't pinpoint what that is. A touch of coffee is noticeable but it's pretty negligible. The finish is rich chocolate with moderate pumpkin notes and a subtle roast. I like Elysian's approach to a pumpkin beer with Dark 'O The Moon. The beer isn't flashy, overly flavored (like a lot of pumpkin beers), or -bal aged, but I think it's well crafted. The combination of chocolate and pumpkin is thoroughly enjoyable. The beer is light full bodied with moderate carbonation."
"Drinkability: This is odd because as a stout I think its a fantastic beer. As a pumpkin beer I can't recommend it because it doesn't taste like one. However I can't deny the complexity and just overall great quality of such a stout that I could drink all night."
"D- Very drinkable, and complex. This is definitely blurring the style lines."
"cheers!"
"Overall a tasty pumpkin stout."
"D- Overall this beer is very tasty from the bottle. I could drink a few of these if i was blessed with more then one bottle that I probably wont get again till next year. I am gonna see if I can some of this at the Great Pumpkin Beer Fest they will be throwing soon. If you see this in your local store, buy it because it is worth trying. If you can get more then one bottle, do it because it wont last long until next year."

"Never mind the pumpkin aspects of this, I thought that this worked worderfully just as a plain ole' full flavored Stout. The pumpkin spices were just an added (and luckily not overdone) aspect that lent some warmth and Fall-like qualities to the mix. Good stuff here that I'm quite glad to have tried."
"Was lucky enough to try this from their pumpkin event earlier in the week. THis beer pours a very dark brown/black, with a nice head. The pumpkin spices aroma is not very strong compared to other pumpkin beers ive had. More on the stout side, with roasted notes of coffee, chocolate and cloves. The taste is much more of a robust stout, than a pumpkin beer, the pumpkin spices try to come out a little but seem to fade quickly. Overall this beer gets point for not being an overdone spiced pumpkin beer like some are and for brewing outside the box and making a stout version of a pumpkin beer"
"Pours almost black with a thin head and some lacing. Aside from the roasted grain in the nose, you can really smell the cinnamon and roasted pumpkin seeds. The taste has a more pronounced pumpkin flavor and sweetness. The cinnamon is also evident here as is a late, nutty roastiness. Mouthfeel is smooth and dry. Once again, a very interesting pumpkin brew from this brewery and another one that works."
"Dark O' the Moon is a strong Pumpkin Stout. Although I classified it as a pumpkin ale, it is actually more of a robust strong stout brewed with pumpkin and pumpkin spices. The pumpkin spices are not overly strong, and shine through more in the background of the beer creating a nice twist in this delicious stout. The Elysian seems to shine with its pumpkin style brews so I thought I'd better try this one before it is gone for good. Looked black as most stouts with aromas of coffee, cocoa, some cinnamon and cloves. The taste was roasty and deep with dark chocolate and cloves followed by sour dark cherries and nutmeg and finishing with ripe pumpkin meat. A very interesting concept for a beer and an excellent fusion of a pumpkin ale and a strong stout. Surprised I haven't seen a pumpkin stout before now. Try it on tap before it's gone. I was informed they probably won't be bottling it."
