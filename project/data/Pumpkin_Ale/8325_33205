The nose comprises brown sugar, light cinnamon, clove, and light cocoa powder. The taste holds notes of cola, brown sugar, molasses, light hickory smoke and clove. The body is a light medium, with a moderate carbonation and a thinly smooth feel. Overall, a nice little stout. I suppose the smoke character I got was actually some toasted pumpkin seeds or something, but it doesn't really matter all that much. If this stuff were a smidge thicker, this would be some great beer-age.","TMoney2591","Oct 20, 2012"

3.48,-6.7,2.5,4.5,3,3.5,3.5,"The beer tastes rich and chocolaty, with much fainter hints of the pumpkin than there was in the smell. Roasted malts are also present, but there is a lingering hint of metal that mixes with the pumpkin and brings down the overall enjoyment of this beer. The spices are also rather faint in the beer until the aftertaste where they ring out as cinnamon, allspice, and nutmeg, though they too could be contributing to the metallic tinge. Mouthfeel is slightly prickly and quite thin, though it thickens a little if swished around the mouth. The tongue is left pretty clean, with just a hint of saliva and a little roasted dryness at the back of the throat. Overall this beer is a little disappointing. I’ve had the imperial pumpkin stout, and it by far surpasses it in everything, as might be expected, but it seems like the stout is just missing something that shouldn’t be missing. I liked my initial sips of this, but as it grew in my mouth it brought a weird metallic taste that I couldn’t shake. It is a cool next step for the style of the pumpkin beer, and I still think it’s worth a taste, but I would recommend the imperial pumpkin stout over the plain stout if you’re looking for good flavoring.","Maxwell","Sep 18, 2012"

Good roasted malt core has me lovin' this brew. Finish is dry with notes of earth and vanilla and more subtle pumpkinand spice. Feel nice and light like a dry Irish stout and super drinkable. Easy to knock back quite a few of these as the abv is completely hidden. An excellent beer that blossoms as it warms up. Delicious to start and improves with each sip.

Taste is a bit watered down, higher ABV is well hidden. Pumpkin shines through a bit, but for the most part is subdued, tastes more like a generic above average stout to me.

Finish is semi-sweet a light smoked background with mild pumpkin aftertaste. Very interesting, More Hops than I would expect, And not as much "Pumpkin" spice as I would have liked.

Hints of pumpkin spice and chocolate waft through, but you have to get in the glass close to pick it up. Flavors are nice, pumpkin is well integrated, not overpowering. Minimal sweetness, the spices play well with the chocolate notes toward the finish. Carbonation is more present when sipping, it has a nice crispness to the finish.

The flavor offers slightly diluted spruce hop and pumpkin herbal ideas. You might describe this as ginger and cinnamon, along the lines of a holiday brew. This is medium light bodied with very little carbonation, almost none. Surprising. The evergreen dominates and pumpkin is a bit hard to detect in my mind. It's a pretty watery feel which disappoints but generally I would say this is still a pretty different pumpkin brew. Not sure about the stout qualities, but it is interesting.","Durge","Jan 27, 2011"

Surprisingly little malt and/or hops show through. In the taste, it is a different story, though. Definite roasted malt balanced by just the right amount of hop bitternes. Not nearly as sweet as the aroma had suggested it would be. The transition to the pumpkin finish is seamless and the pumpkin is excellent.

It has a light, almost watery, black malt and pumpkin flavor. It's easily quaffable with just a mild earthy feel. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation.

It has a huge pumpkin aroma. Underneath, there's a little roastiness, like coffee, and a hint of sweetness like cola. It's pretty light bodied and smooth. The clean finish is a little chewy. There's lots of pumpkin and a little roast in the taste. There's a touch of sweetness... maybe lactose? There's not really any bitterness. This must be a milk stout.

The aroma isn't as strong with pumpkin spices as most pumpkin ales, which is nice as this beer is a unique creation. The pairing of these spices with a stout is inspired, the roasted malts match the cinnamon and nutmeg perfectly, smelling more strongly of stout than pumpkin pie. It tastes just as good, a roasted malt stout with malty sweetness counterplayed against a light sprinkling of pumpkin pie spices.

More stout flavor than cinnamon and spice. The only gripe I would have with this beer would be its body. Much thinner than I had expected for a pumpkin stout. That said, being lighter aided its drinkability. I was thinking that this would be a slow sipping beer, but I found myself done quicker than I thought and wanting to move onto another.

Burnt espresso-like and dark chocolate-like malt dominate the flavor, with pumpkin pie spices such as cinnamon and allspice in the background. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation.

4,7.2,4,4,4,4,4,"Jet black with minimal head retention and lace but a small rim of tan foam around the edges. The smell is pleasant with roasted notes taking the lead and some pumpkin/spice lurking in the background. The pumpkin flavor comes a little fuller on the palate with maybe some nutmeg and a little bit of cinnamon. Again though, the roasted stout qualities are dominant. I get the sense that the pumpkin flavors counterbalance the typical stout flavors. As a result, both are subdued but in a good way. Nice medium-bodied mouthfeel that has some palate-sticking qualities. This has been my favorite pumpkin beer so far mostly because it tasted less like pumpkin pie and more like a beer. Maybe something like Dogfish Head would be a truer expression of the pumpkin but I'll take a beer like Fisherman's Stout. Hopefully other brewers will steer towards more balanced flavors like Cape Ann has. All around I could have used more robust flavors and aromas but it's definitely a solid beer that's drinkable.","apbarwood","Sep 21, 2009"

4.07,9.1,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"This definitely works better if you go into it expecting a pumpkin beer instead of a novelty stout. It's kind of hard to separate the two aspects of it, though. It has a chalky, roasty aspect from a stout. Before too long, the pumpkin part asserts dominance (but doesn't completely take over), lightening the profile a bit. It's kind of comparable to Weyerbacher's Imperial Pumpkin, you get some nice pumpkin flavor without the gourd overpowering everything. Spicing is kept well in line, it stays out of the body and mostly manifests itself in the mid-end palate, with a little bit of a hop cleansing. I'm not a fan of overly spiced beers, so this is a plus. Mouthfeel takes a bit of a hit, because it could definitely stand to fill out a little more. It's like there's a bit of a hole between the initial stoutiness and the later pumpkiney-ness where there should be some transition. Overall, medium-heavy body, pretty chewy without being real coating, it slides nicely off the palate. Could use a little more of a stout creaminess to it. All of the different factors come together pretty well, for a nice drinkable beer. It's not my most favorite thing in the world, but it could certainly be worse. I've had worse pumpkin beers.","damienblack","Jan 23, 2009"

4.03,8,4,3.5,4.5,3.5,4,"Nice,deep and rich black color. Small tight tan head on top. Nice pumpkin and spice aroma. Could use a little more "stout" in there for me. Great pumpkin flavor against a mellow roasted taste. Just a hint of spices-none really stand out but a mix is there for sure. Body a bit thin for a stout. A great fall beer for sure. I would like a touch more stout character but I think it might drown out the pumpkin qualities. Between this and DFH Punkin I wont bother buying any others.","lackenhauser","Sep 26, 2008"

3.5,-6.2,4,4,3,3,4,"Pours black with a large frothy, bubbly mocha colored head. Pumpkin and cinnamon and chocolate are much more apparent in the nose than in the taste. Not overwhelmingly spiced. The mouthfeel is a little thin which adds to its drinkability as does its lack of overwhelming flavors, but I think it need to be a little more daring to attract any attention. I would not normally reach for another Pumpkin Stout because I'm expecting a thicker spicier brew but the 6.75% ABV is well hidden as are the usually overpowering traits of pumpkin beers, so I'll pop open another and rethink things.","yossarian14","Beers"
3.6,-3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Served in a standard pint. Poured a deep, opaque brown with ruby red highlights around the edges. Quarter inch tan-colored head quickly broke down into a lightly effervescent slick that coalesced around the perimeter of the glass. No lacing on this one. Nose is malt, nutmeg and a mild pumpkin character. Taste is just like a cross between pumpkin pie and a winter warmer style beer. Pumpkin pie flavor is not at all over the top. Also picked up a little hops bittering in the middle. Mouthfeel is a little light for a stout with just enough carbonation to keep it lively. Good drinkability. Brew went down easy and flavors were not at all overpowering; however, it came off a little unremarkable.","Jwale73","0"
4.49,20.4,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,5,"Pours a very dark dark brown, some nice lighter brown highlights around the edges, medium-sized sturdy tan head fades into a fine film on top of the beer with minimal lacing. Lots of nutmeg on the nose, a bit of milk chocolate, and maybe a touch of weak coffee. Really subtly flavored, as far as pumpkin beers go. You get the nutmeg, the pumpkin pie flavor, but it's all secondary to what amounts to a very tasty and classic American Stout....makes me wish Cape Ann offered a stout year-round. Medium-bodied brew, some good lingering pumpkin pie flavors, but nothing overwhelming. Drinkability is where this beer soars. Not so overly-spiced as to become a dessert beer, but certainly "pumpkiny" enough to be a very flavorful representation of the season. Very unique, well-crafted, and extremely tasty.","corey0212","Sep 21, 2008"

This is amazingly drinkable even though it's a bit thinner than I anticipated. No matter, I'm glad to have found a beer that works well in the waning days of summer, and know that it will be just as good as the days grow colder and darker. Certainly worth a try!","JerzDevl2000","Sep 21, 2008"

Nervously, I poured my first pint. Nice, dark color with a quickly disappearing head. Lightly carbonated like most of the Cape Ann beers. Aroma is all pumpkin and spices, but thankfully the flavor has more of the dark malt character of a traditional stout with hints of chocolate. The nutmeg and spiced pumpkin comes back in the finish. Overall, a nice beer from my friend Jeremy at Cape Ann Brewing and instantly one of my favorite pumpkin ales.","pnkermiz","Oct 22, 2006"
