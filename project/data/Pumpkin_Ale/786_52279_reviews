"In Memoriam: Pumpkin (April 1998 - November 22, 2014) - the best cat ever. We will always miss you."

"This seasonal 'Pumpkin Ale' pours a hazy mahogany in color with about a half-finger off-white foamy head. A good amount of lacing is seen with each sip, close to ring-like even. Sediment is seen in the bottom of the bottle after the pour. The aroma is like a fresh pumpkin pie. Fantastic! Even more going on with the taste as their are the perfect amount of spices of cinnamon, nutmeg and even a hint of clove in the mix. Really smooth and goes down so easy. One of the BEST pumpkin ales on the market. Medium-bodied with perfect carbonation. Love this one but I do remembered how good it was from back in 2012. This is as good as it gets!"

"One of the best pumpkin beers out there!"

"Too heavy on the spices or maybe a spice. Has raisin-y flavor."
"one of the best pumpkin ales I have had"
""
"Aroma is pie crust, spices/cinnamon, slight mustiness and a hint of pumpkin.  The flavor is spices/cinnamon, bread/pie crust, a hint of fruit and a tart finish."

"O - This is really a model pumpkin beer that others should aspire to.  Full, rich pumpkin flavor but balanced and very drinkable. Top 5 Pumpkin of 2014 for me."

"I wish I had bought more than one four pack, a mistake I won't make next year.  Well Done!"

"Poured a cloudy, amber hue with a nice glow around the edges. Aromas of cinnamon, nutmeg, apple (apple pie), and some pumpkin. Tasted the pumpkin, definitely not a spicy mess... very delicate cinnamon and spice. Could use a bit more hop bitterness in my opinion for balance, but very good. Smooth, medium body and mouthfeel with very little aftertaste. Overall this was outstanding, I can see why it won a blind pumpkin tasting in my bottleshop 2 years running."

"O: One man's pumpkin ale is not another mans pumpkin ale. This is a great beverage, just a bit stronger than my holy grail of pumpkin pie in a glass with whipped cream."
""
""
""
""
"This is a really impressive pumpkin ale.   I like the way the pumpkin/gourd flavor combines with the spicing.   This is not a spice bomb but it add a nice touch with cinnamon and nutmeg most prevalent.   Really like the aroma and flavor.   Only slight knock would be it could use a bit fuller body for 7.5%.   Finishes a little thin rather than rounded but I am splitting hairs....one of the better pumpkin ales out there.."

"OUTSTANDING BREW!!!!!  Tough to find in my neck of the woods, but I was able to find a few 4 packs so that I could give this one a try...boy did it NOT disappoint!!!  So far, this one has been my favorite pumpkin ale that I have had so far this year...just a tad better than the Dog Fish Head Punkin...great flavor, spices are perfectly blended and it is one smooth brew!!!  I highly recommend you gove this one a try...it is pure bliss...pumpkin pie in a bottle!!!"

"Poured this at a perfect temperature with a small fizzy head that promptly disappeared, no lace and a clear brown color. Aroma is spicy pumpkin pie and more bold than the flavor. This is one of the better pumpkin beers where the flavors are not so overpowering. There is some balance; malts can be tasted; still not one of my favorite kinds of beers but this isn't bad. Good body. Decent finish with a very slight hint of alcohol."
""
"O- This is the opposite of New Glarus' Pumpkin Pie Lust. This is all spices, all the way. It's very interesting to see how the two contrast. Not sure which one I'm more impressed with, but this is pretty impressively spice-forward. If that's your thing, I certainly recommend this one. [4]"
""

"Great desert beer. One of my top 3 pumpkin beers I've had to date. Closest to Pumkin pie that your going to get. Sweet and delicious.  Highly recommend."

"A good pumpkin, a good gimmick beer. Nothing to take seriously here, my peeps."
""

"Overall: Absolutely a pleasure and delight. Already one of my top pumpkin beers ever had. Seriously. When you want dessert after dinner this is it. Salud."

"Excellent ale.  True to its title.  Fitting for a great Fall beverage."
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a tulip glass. Murky orange-copper color with a small head that disappates very quickly. Aroma consists of the typical pumpkin pie spices. The flavor is not bad but the spices are very prominent. Mouthfeel is way too thin and watery. Very underwhelming pumpkin beer. There are many better versions out there."
"Best pumpkin beer I have ever had."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a cloudy dark orange with a quickly fading white head. Aroma of sweet pumpkin pie spices, nutmeg, some cinnamon notes. Taste is sweet pumpkin spices, nutmeg with some malt and mild hops bitterness. A medium body with good carbonation. Has sweet pumpkin pie spice and nutmeg flavor, with some moderate hops bitterness on the end for balance. Overall has some back bone and flavor for a pumpkin ale, a good brew."
""
""
""
"Even with Schlafly and ahead of Pumking in a blind taste test of the three."
""
"I would have rated this higher but I'm not a super fan of the high fruity issued beers. This is defiantly a pumpkin beer as you can taste the pumpkin and spices right away. It even has a """crust""" bread type after taste that makes this much like drinking a pumpkin pie. If you like the full all out taste of pumpkin pie this is the beer for you."

"Must have been something wrong with this one or i didn't get the beer i ordered."
""

"The feel is brisk, a biting crispness and a bit of zing in its medium body.  As such, it's not entirely smooth, but it's pretty clean and great for a cool Autumn day."

"Cloudy brownish copper.  The nose has notes of both pumpkin and cinnamon.  There is a potent taste of fresh pumpkin with a blend of spices that are pleasantly present but do not overwhelm the taste of the gourd.  There is no sweetness here.  This is NOT a dessert beer, this is meant for the main course.  Highly recommended to those who do not like sweet over-the-top pumpkin beers."

"Nothing but spices. Drink this alongside any quality pumpkin ale and you'll immediately notice the utter lack of any pumpkin in this beer. I bought an entire case based on the high rating (highest of the 20-30 pumpkins my distributor had). I feel duped and have a very rare buyers remorse of a beer purchase. So I have plenty to trade if anyone has interest in doing so?"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"For those that like their PumpAles spicy, this is a good choice. It also has great malt interest."
""
"Pours a brownish orange with a creamy head. Smells like fresh pumpkin pie. Taste is unbelievably pumpkin for a beer. Easily the best pumpkin beer I’ve tasted. I didn’t try this, but you could probably add whip cream or vanilla ice cream for a great beer float."

"I love a good pumpkin ale, I'd go as far as saying it pretty much my favorite style. While this doesn't dethrone the king of pumpkin beers, Pumpking, it riding on its coat-tails, it's patiently waiting its for its turn to sit in the iron throne. Additionally, if I want to get my hands on Southern Tier's nectar of the gods, I have to drive 4 hours, giving Whole Hog a hell of an advantage. Do yourself a favor and snag this if you see it!"

"This is one orange beer! The fizzy, foamy finger of head had a definite light-orange cast while it lasted. Color was an orangish-amber (SRM = > 13, < 17) with NE-quality clarity and pumpkin highlights. Nose was more sweet than spicy and I was put in mind of cinnamon toast. Mouthfeel was medium and the taste was very pleasant with the cinnamon and the malt, especially the caramel malt, interacting beautifully. I really felt like it was liquid cinnamon toast! Finish was semi-dry with the spices being balanced out nicely. I feel renewed in my attempt to review such beers. YMMV."

"This beer has a nice brown reddish color body with a small white head. The aroma has a sweet pumpkin smell and spice. The taste is simple, pumpkin and spice, its like a liquid pumpkin pie. Mouthfeel is smooth and overall one of the better pumpkin beers I have had."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Much thanks to Dave for providing the bottle. He wanted to share a pumpkin ale he thought I would like, after I wrote that perhaps I didn't like them anymore. I like them, when they're as good as this, but can't see having more than one in a sitting."
""
""
"Overall I think this is a complete miss as a pumpkin ale. In don't understand the high ratings for this brew. Little pumpkin smell or taste. Little pumpkin spice smell or taste; this brew is even light on the caramel malts. There are much better pumpkin ales out there."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is maybe the best pumpkin bier I've had yet. It's dead-on for Pumpkin pie, but it has a GREAT balance of pumpkin and spice. Every bottle I drink, I just think, """Jeez...I need to buy more of this.""" Absolute PERFECT start to Autumn!"
"O: tasty!"
""
"Overall an excellent pumpkin ale -- one of the best I've tried."
"Close to a finger of deep tan, not dense nor airy, just a scattershot of larger bubbles, boils down to the surface at a steady clip, the lacing is not that sticky but certainly better than most in the category. Not cloudy but darn close to opaque liquid, sunset red up close, more a mix of browns and oranges further away, few bubbles visible. The nose is clean and direct, cinnamon to clove spice, orange peel, the pumpkin is ripe but not sweet, light breadiness without it being pie-like, touch of cocoa powder too, nothing here overdone or unnecessarily flamboyant. Medium-bodied, has enough prickle from the carbonation to keep the sweetness in check, even has a sort of tart, metallic edge at times. Otherwise, straight up fresh pumpkin with cinnamon, nutmeg spice, chocolate and vanilla accents. Less citrus here, mostly orange, some lemon. Stays balanced and the flavors cruise at a steady altitude, you don’t get worn out by it. Finishes cleanly yet with bite. Easy to like and, again, doesn’t try too hard, always a plus in my book."

""

"O - I think this surpasses Pumpking as my new favorite pumpkin beer. Really good if you are looking for something that is forward with the pumpkin pie spice."

""
""

""
""
"Overall: I have been waiting for several years to try this beer and am delighted to finally have tasted this; the Munich and caramel malts really make a difference here as does the delicate spicing"
"(O)- Easily my favorite of this season so far. Really reminds me of a rich yet slightly sweet pumpkin pie. We had Southern Tier's Pumking along side this and I would choose this over Pumking all day long."
""
""
""
"Wanted to try some pumpkin beers, since its starting to cool down in Texas, so we grabbed this at the local liquor store in a mix a six. Glad we did! This beer was fantastic. Great pumpkin spice aroma, almost like Thanksgiving dinner. The taste follows the aroma, almost like homemade pumpkin puree from your moms pumpkin pie. It carries this taste throughout the finish. Went back to the store to grab a sixer but they were already out, and said they would be out till next year. Bummer! Definitely worth a try!!!"
""
"Great thanks to st9647v3 for this autumn treat."
""
""
""
""
"O) I enjoy pumpkin beers, but generally only knock back one in a sitting, then move along to another style. I could legitimately see myself throwing back a four pack of this without much regret. Well done Whole Hog. Well done..."
"O- Balance it the key with pumpkin beers and this one has it. Not too much alcohol, nice spice level that keeps the pumpkin noticeable and a clean aftertaste."
""
"O) very tasty beer great series by Steven's Point. So far this one may be my favorite."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I really liked this beer because it had lots of pumpkins and pumpkin pie spices, but it wasn't really sweet or spicy. It has excellent drinkability."
"Served in a chilled tulip glass. Bright amber orange, moderately cloudy appearance. Pumpkin and nutmeg dominate the aroma. True pumpkin aroma and taste, clean, and refreshing. Balanced nutmeg, cinnamon and pumpkin aroma and taste develop in 3-5 minutes: smooth, no sharp edges and nothing overwhelming. Simply a very pleasant and true pumpkin ale that I would recommend highly. My wife dislikes beer with a passion, and she asked for more after her first taste. The only pumpkin ale I have liked more was Southern Tier on tap in a tulip glass, which was a revelation. From the bottle in a tulip glass, Whole Hog has a slight edge with its balance and smooth feel."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Liked it a lot, just like the balance of some others I've tried."
""
""
"O - I really didnt care for this a whole lot, its more of a roasty kind of pumpkin brown ale, but its not the worst."
""
"O: As close to perfect as I have tasted in a long time. I love pumpkin which only makes this beer all the better. It is a must have for any true beer fans."
""
"**Update Sep 22--Just had a homemade pumpkin pie from my wife and had this Whole Hog and tastes were matched. This now goes a 5 for me."
""
""
"This beer is outstanding. If you want a pumpkin ale that actually tastes like pumpkin this ale is for you. The only Pumpkin ale I have had that compares is Southern Tier Pumking Ale (which is much more expensive). I have tried roughly 20 different pumpkin ales and this one is #2 overall and #1 bang for my buck. Worth every bit of $8.99 for a 4 pack."
"Wow, had this last year but not a whole one so I could not review it.... I got a case this year! It is amazing. Pumking used to be my pumpkin beer of choice. This takes pumking outside and kicks it in the balls and a 4 pack cost about the same as 1 bomber... I love being able to taste the crust of the pie in the beer!! Ya, I know some people think of Point as a Faux craft brewery but this beer WORLD CLASS."
""
""
"Do yourself a favor and go buy a 4pk. I'm sad this was the last one left at our local liquor store. As I said earlier, this is a solid medium body beer that gives Southern Tier PumKing a run for there money. It's big on the """pumpkin""" flavor, which imo how a pumpkin beer should be."
""
"Bought this on a whim while at my local beer store. Wasn't getting my hopes up too high, as I am quite picky about my pumpkin beers. I do not like a lot of spice overpowering everything. Several other pumpkin ales have almost nauseated me, and consequentially became instant drain cleaner. I really have to say that this is THE BEST pumpkin ale I have ever had. And I've had quite a few. I liked this even more than Southern Tier Pumking, Shipyard Smashed Pumpkin, and several others. I liked this so much I was inspired to write this, my first full review. I'm not going to break down the taste, mouthfeel, etc., just want to note that I found this to be the best pumpkin ale I've had to date. I am going out to my local homebrew store soon to get ingredients to try and clone this. Way to go Whole Hog!!"
"O: One of the better pumpkin beers I've had just because of how darned authentic & balanced it is. They really took the essence of a pie and put it in a bottle of beer"
"A really refreshing and solid Pumpkin Ale. This is up there with the best of them."
"O - Whole Hog Pumpkin Ale is definitely the equivalent of a piece of pumpkin pie in a glass; Whole Hog got it right from smell, color and texture. A must to have on thanksgiving with friends and family. Very rich in flavor and character with all the classic pumpkin pie qualities. Finally a pumpkin ale that’s not too boozy, but still has a kick. Not water down a faint taste of pumpkin, yet still a full-flavored winter beverage. Probably the best drinkable pumpkin ale I’ve had so far and I love pumpkin ales."
"DELICIOUS; GRAB A BOTTLE!"
""
""
"O - Perfect for the cooler fall days, Whole Hog Pumpkin Ale is pumpkin pie in a glass; as it warms up, so too do you with it's inciting aroma, delectable flavor, luscious mouthfeel and complex, warming finish. If it's a rich pumpkin ale you crave, this one is not to miss and make sure you keep some on hand for Thanksgiving, as it almost certainly requests a pairing with the classic turkey dinner."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A pleasant, straight-forward pumpkin beer; decent option though there are better options out there--but considering the price point, this will work"
""
""
"O-	Hands down, the best pumpkin ale I have had. This one ACTUALLY tastes like pumpkin. I will definitely be having this beer with my thanksgiving meal this season. For those you who are down on pumpkin ales, give this take a try and it might change your opinion."
""
""
"The appearance and aroma was a little misleading. But, this is a really great pumpkin ale. Bold, heavy, sweet and flavorful."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- What a surprise this pumpkin was! Maybe I really am just looking for pumpkin pie in a glass. I suppose that isn't a bad thing. Talk about a beer that goes well with the season, and tastes great to boot!"
""
""
"The mouthfeel is pretty robust for a pumpkin ale and complements the flavor profile nicely. The overall experience only enhances as the beer warms, lending even more vitality and depth of flavor. I think it would be fair to say that Whole Hog is the closest I've come to finding a pumpkin ale that embodies what I've always imagined a pumpkin ale should be: a smooth, rich, flavorful beer infused with the essence of authentic pumpkin pie. A real winner."
"To be fair, this was not a quick sipper like so many other beers that are out during this season. It added a bit of a warming effect as I finished this up but it didn't detract from the taste or mouthfeel. This would never dare be labelled as an Imperial Pumpkin Ale but this was right up there with the Southern Tier Pumpking on the must-haves for the season. I can't wait to finish the rest of the 4-pack!"
"O – This is a really tasty and different pumpkin beer. It’s definitely darker and maltier than most pumpkin ales that I’ve had, giving the beer a nice caramel-sweet aroma and flavor. There’s also a solid amount of gingerbread in the aroma and flavor, something that I haven’t experienced in a pumpkin beer yet. The 7.5% is hidden very well, too. This is the first I’ve ever heard of Stevens Point, but I’ll be looking for more from them in the future."
""
"Overall, a really amazing pumpkin beer that more people need to try. I wish more could be made like this."
""
""
""
""
""
"I love pumpkin pie, but this beer can cause someone to hate pumpkin pie because it sucks horse ass so bad."
""
""
"This is a really nice pumpkin ale. It has some qualities I've never come across in the style. It's traditional with a unique, original twist. The best part about it is that it tastes very good.. which is always a good thing. Highly recommended."
""
"A pretty decent and enjoyable pumpkin ale. Good flavor, would have this again. There are other pumpkin ales that I'd rather have, but not a lot."
"Consider me pleasantly surprised with the Stevens Point Whole Hog Pumpkin. Well integrated spices with the base beer, everything fits well. Highly recommended, trust me."
"Just to reiterate how good this beer is, I had a fall beer fest with a handful of my good beer friends and this one stole the show."
""
"O: This is a fantastic pumpkin ale, would recommend it to anybody who is looking for a beer that fits the season."
"Aside from the appearance and mouthfeel, this is the perfect pumpkin ale, in my opinion."
""
"O- Smells amazing and has a ton of nice flavor but not quite perfect"
""
""
"O: Overall, an excellent example of a pumpkin ale. You get the feeling that there is actually pumpkin used in this recipe from some of the residual flavors, and the spices aren't ridiculously in your face as they are in so many other examples of the style. Definitely a good example of the style."
"O - An exceptionally well-balanced, refreshing pumpkin ale that avoids tipping the scales too far in any direction. A great find, and one of the better in the style I've had."
"Give this one a try you will thank yourself. Overall I give it a 4.5 A truely Amazing Pumpkin Ale!"
""
"O - Very good and intense pumpkin ale with ABV well hidden."
"Light to medium bodied, good carbonation and very drinkable. Recommended."
"Poured a burnt amber color with a slight chill haze, and a small bubbly cap of whitish head. Nice aroma of pumpkin pie and ginger snaps. The taste was a bit more subtle, but still adequately pronounced: right up front, caramel, nutmeg, cloves, ginger, a touch of cinnamon; entering mid-palate is a bit more bitterness from the pumpkin pulp, and just a tiny hint of leafy hoppiness. Light-medium body, crisp, and drinkable."
"O - Good beer. I'd try this and the other Whole Hog line again. I find their seasonals and limited releases are *much* better than the year round offerings."
"This is a good all around sessionable pumpkin ale. I enjoy this one and with it being 7.5% abv it goes down way easy. Good stuff."
"Overall I liked it. It was a big surprise to find it and even better to try it. The sweetness wasn't overbearing and the pumpkin/spices were balanced. One of the better pumpkin ales I have tried, I would recommend it."
"This is a tasty pumpkin ale; I have had others where it was too unbalanced but this is quite tasty. All the flavors work well together and nothing is too overpowering. Alcohol is hidden well."
"This is generally a quality pumpkin beer, though the alcohol level is perhaps a bit too high and unmasked. Spices are a bit overpronounced. None of these qualities ruin the beer. I would like to see a bit more malt character to smooth things out; perhaps a decrease in alcohol levels would facilitate the same thing."
"D: With the initial boozy & spicy hit ( and the apparent and relatively high abv) this, for me, is no easy drinker. I really like the well done pumpkin in this one, but would like more malty flavor and body to provide a richer base for the booze and spice, and to round out the beer. The added heft would also contribute to the sipper quality of this fine seasonal. I could actually go for a tad less spice and booze too, and maybe a touch more pronounced on the pumpkin."
" ~ This has some interesting character. It offers a spicy change to the lineup of the brewers in Stevens Point."
"I'll say it again: I'm getting increasingly proud of my brother's beer selections. This one pours a clear ruby-amber topped by a finger of ecru foam. The nose comprises cinnamon, nutmeg, French vanilla, brown sugar, and graham crackers. The taste runs very similarly, with that pumpkin pie kinda flavor, but the sweetness of it all is dulled slightly by a splash of pumpkin seeds and orange peel. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a smooth feel. Overall, a tasty gem of a pumpkin beer, something you don't find too many of these days."
"This Imperial Pumpkin Ale has some meat. The complexities make you think about the style all over again, while it begs to be paired with your typical turkey dinner."
"Morey's Bottom Line: A very good example of the style. Reminds me a bit of Schlafly Pumpkin Ale which is a huge compliment!"
"12 ounce bottle. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours a mostly clear burnt orange color with about an inch and a half frothy off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is pumpkin, cinnamon, and nutmeg. The flavors in this brew as just like I smell in the aroma, but the taste isn't quite as strong as I thought it would be (but it's still good). Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick and has moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's smooth and goes down easy. Not a bad overall pumpkin ale, I'd buy this again in the future. It's definitely worth a try."
"One or two of these would be the most I would have. If the spices were a bit more subdued, this one would be even more drinkable. For the style, it fits in nicely. If you're a pumpkin pie fan, this one is a must try."
"Overall- A new favorite pumpkin ale! Finally, a pumpkin ale that actually tastes like a slice of pumpkin pie without being overly spiced! Excellent work balancing everything out without losing the spice, pumpkin, hop, and malt flavors. Great job on this beer, and a well hidden 7.4% to boot! Wish I would have grabbed a whole 4 pack!"
"The only real redeeming quality of this beer was the high ABV was unnoticeable. You could look pretty cool getting wasted of your ass at a frat party. O_o"
"Notes: Overall I liked it and think it is a solid all-around Pumpkin Ale. With its ABV and heavy spicing you may not want too many in a row however."
"Pours a clear burnt orange/amber with a fluffy white head. Not much retention and just a hint of laceing. Aroma is of spiced pumpkin and cinnamon.Body is light and crisp with some carbonation. Taste is of creamy pumpkin pie. Spicy,with hints of dark fruit and maybe even some chocolate. Excellent!"
"Whole Hog Pumpkin Ale would have been better beer if Stevens Point had gone whole hog. The spice used, the spice load and the ABV are perfectly fine. More malt, though, would have bulked this little piggy up and might have turned him into a blue ribbon hog that could have shared the stage with some of the style's best."
"Taste: It really tastes like a liquid pumpkin pie. I am not really a fan of this flavor but I am trying to be unbiased. If you like pumpkin pie this would be a really good beer, probably better then most pumpkin beers I have had."
"D - To me, they went overboard on the ABV. The usual range for this style is 4-7%...the 7.5% alcohol in this isn't really hidden that well, and I think it would be a better brew if it had a lower ABV. They seemed to be right there with the pumpkin taste in this brew though. If you enjoy Pumpkin Pie, you may very well enjoy this beer."
"D- Spot on for a perfect Fall pumpkin beer to be enjoyed right up until to Thanksgiving dinner."
"D - This is a pretty good pumpkin ale. I found it much better than the Whole Hog IPA."
"Purchased from Three Cellars in Franklin, WI. Pours a reddish amber body with a short white head that quickly fades. Aroma is of pumkin pie spices. Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Caramelized sugar and cinnamon are too over the top and dominate in the taste. No other flavors get a chance to come through. This is just too one-dimensional and not very good."
"Overall, a very good one or two beer with decent flavor for a gateway beer, but the flavors just seemed to artificial."
"drinkability is suprizingly good. for a pumpkin brew, the aromatic notes are heavy on the spice, but on the palate the profile is cleverly well balanced and much less spiced. a solid pumpkin brew that has the spice, but does not overdo it."
"Just picked this up from my local bottle shop. Poured into my pint glass the beer is brownish slightly red hue. A half inch of tan head rests on top. No lacing left at all. The aroma is pumpkin, nutmeg, and clove. Nutty roast malt is present as well. It smells rather close to pumpkin pie. The flavor however is not as strong. Light pumpkin flavor up front but, it fades rather quick. Luckily as it fades a nice buttery nuttiness takes over. Cinnimon,nutmeg and clove are also very noticeable. Just not as pumpkin as i would have liked. Medium to light body. Moderate carbonation. Some alcohol can be picked up. A decent beer overall. Not the worst pumpkin I've had but, far from the best."
