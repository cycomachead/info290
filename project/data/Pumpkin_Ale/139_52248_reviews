"Very good.  Light pumpkin taste - not over powering."
"Spiced nutmeg bomb, hidden alcohol"
""
""
"Poured from a bomber. Clear orange/brown with a sticky head that laces the whole glass. Nice aromas of toasted malt, graham cracker, and pumpkin pie spice. Little evidence of the 9% ABV. Flavors reveal hints of booze with canned pumpkin pie, balanced pie spices, roasty malts, and a little late hop bitterness in the slightly sweet finish. Full body with sticky texture."
""
"As orange a color as I've seen in a beer, this pours with quickly faded head. Immediate traditional pumpkin spices on the nose - pretty close to the pie I love! Flavor/mouth-fee is quite a ride... initial pumpkin quickly turns to burst of yeasty, slightly sour alcoholic funk, which in turn, quickly dissolves to a clean finish and lasting mellow aftertaste."

"Overall:  This is a good pumpkin beer, and I’ll probably get it again next Autumn, but it’s not spectacular.  If it had a little more body in the mouthfeel, the beer would be much better, bordering special, but alas, it doesn’t.  Still worth a try if you’ve never had it, and maybe a re-visit if you have."
"Pretty solid brew. I wish it had more pumpkin flavor to it. Extremely smooth and drinkable for 9%."

"Had for Halloween with friends. Surprisingly decent - tasted like pumpkin pie."

"Amber in color with excellent clarity.  A fingernail of off white head covers half of the top.  Aroma of pumpkin and clove are what I detect.  The flavor is heavy with cinnamon,allspice,and clove.  The body is moderately carbonated and aggressively spiced."
"Overall: Worth seeking out, especially if you like the style. I saw that they had a barrel aged one. That would be interesting to try!"

"Shipyard Smashed Pumpkin Ale pours orange with hints of amber and red.  The smell leads a little cinnamony, but picks up nutmeg and allspice.  The smell hints slightly earthy, picking up a whiff vanilla extract and squash scent.  The body is heavy, and starts off a little sweet.  but quickly turns toward a heavily spiced squash and pumpkin flavor.  The spices remain strong, pulling strongly toward allspice and clove with a touch of cinnamon.  Somehow, on the ending it is slightly mouth drying, and channels a huge amount of cinnamon, complimented by pumpkin spice and pumpkin."

"Spice is main taste not pumpkin at all. Easy to drink but not a strong pumpkin ale compared to others."
""

"O- It just seemed as if this beer was slightly off.  Could not quite tell what it was.   Apart from that, not enough pumpkin flavor (as much as I expected).  Will wait for it to warm a bit as I drink before I rush too much judgment, but definitely not what I had hoped for."
"O- Overall this is a great representation of the style and a  huge departure from the staple from the brewery (in the pumpkin ale style), Pumpkinhead. Pumpkinhead is light bodied, refreshing, very sweet and highly carbonated. This beer is twice the ABV, less carbonated, less sweet and not as drinkable. Atleast I wouldn't want to drink more than one glass. A good beer but not exactly what I was hoping for."
""
"Taste -  Sweet like pumpkin pie at first then the cinnamon and nutmeg kick in to balance it out."

"I'm not sure if I had a bad bottle but this is one of the worst beers I've ever had.   Doesn't even remotely taste like pumpkin but super sweet. Drain pour most of it."
""

"The beer pours a very light and white foamy head that dissipates very quickly. The beer itself is a clear copper that isn't anything to write home about. The beer smell has strong spice, pumpkin, hops, and vanilla notes. The spice notes are very light compared to other pumpkin ales and barely register while the vanilla and hop notes dominate the smell. The hops are floral and lightly bitter. The pumpkin also shows up but is dominated by the vanilla. The taste is similar to the smell in that the vanilla dominates the pumpkin and other notes. However, the hops and the vanilla mix well with the pumpkin and make it a more interesting, if not more complex. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied with very little carbonation and the pumpkin has a fairly velvety feel to it, which isn't bad and works a bit with the kind of beer. Overall, a much better offering than Pumking and probably worth getting over that one for next year."
"Poured a very deep Amber. The spices were evident immediately but way to much. It smelted like cinnamon ginger and allspice. Just very overpowering. I forgot there was a beer underneath that nose. The taste was again spice dominating and not particularly well balance do. As it warmed it got a little less messy but something just tasted off. The hops were not evident and the malt character was not really there."

"Pours a very nice clear pumpkin color with a slightly weak head and lacing. Nice pumpkin aroma coming from this brew. Pumpkin flavor and pumpkin spices are nice and taste good. Feel is nice also, but a little too much alcohol taste and afterburn. Believe this would have been a much better beer at about 6-8% ABV. Overall, commendable, but not great !"
""
"I just think this stuff is great - they hit all the right stuff here. I will say I didn't get much pumpkin in the flavor, but I usually don't with most pumpkins, and for that reason I don't hold it against them anymore. I would totally buy this again, even after proclaiming I was done with the pumpkins for the season. I've really had a lot, but this one's a standout this year for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Don't bother trying to age this one. It just doesn't hold up over time. Have it fresh, where the face-kicking barleywine effect is still spiced and pie like. It's really nothing at all like Pumpkinhead."
""
"Overall: This is a beer that when you are pouring it looks great. The initial smell is promising but then overwhelming. The taste at first is too strong, but overtime it does become better. I think that mixing this beer with Southern Tier Pumking might taste good."

"O- I think it depends on what you are looking for with your pumpkin beer. If you want something that is sweet, warm, and strong . . .the kind of drink that just feels right when the temperature starts to drop in the evening in the fall… then this is a solid option. But if you want something that makes you say “oh yeah, they made this shit out of pumpkins”, then this might not be your go-to. Overall, I don’t think this is the greatest pumpkin beer ever made, but it is pretty solid and I definitely wouldn’t mind having another on a cool October night."
"Very drinkable beer, probably due to the subtlety of everything. This is very enjoyable drink, but there are other pumpkins I go to if I'm really craving a pumpkin ale in the Fall. Also, this stuff is pretty pricey on the West Coast."
""
""
""
""
""
"Tastes like double crooked tree with a hint of pumkin and spice"
"Overall – Really not the best imperial pumpkin out there, and at 8.99 for a bomber it is certainly not worth it. Southertier Pumpking and Elysians The great pumpkin, which are of similar style and price, are a much better go too.  A decent try, but really just a little too off to be worth it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O:  A solid beer but there are better offerings of this type."
""
""
""
""
"Overall- A very sweet pumkin beer. Could use some additional pumkin taste and less malt but still quite good. I applaud the fact that the spices are kept under control. Still a quality pumpkin ale that makes up a big caliber member of the style as it is an imperial."
""
""
""
"O: like most in the style, heavy on spices"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours into an impy nonic a lighter copper color with an orange hue,a thin quick to fade head atop.Strong cinnamon and nutmeg in the nose along with sweet alcohol,very strong spice.Nutmeg is way to strong flavor-wise to go along with almost hot cinnamon spice in the finish to go along with sweet alcohol.To much spice and alcohol for me to really enjoy,I'll take the Smashed Blueberry but not this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I don't understand pumpkin beers that don't use pumpkin as the dominant flavor. Still a solid beer that goes well with a cool autumn night."
""
""
""
"A decently rendered big pumpkin ale, the alcohol kept under wraps for the most part, letting the spice take the, um, heat for the inherent astringency of it all, to no overall ill effect.  Perhaps one of the more aptly-named offerings from this brewery, as the 18-proof strength will certainly catch up to you (and me), as I continue to focus solely on the grade-school holiday spiciness."

"O: Overall I felt this beer had a bit more spice then pumpkin flavors. It wasn't one of the best pumpkin ales, but it was good. The alcohol was masked insanely well for 9% abv. I would pick this up again."

"I actually really enjoyed this beer. Nothing over the top as far as flavor, but if you like a nice cinnamon bomb this beer is for you. Easy drinker with a high, undetectable ABV."
""
""
""
""
"Taste is quite good, the apple theme continues onto the flavor and is very apple pie-esque. The ABV is very well integrated and the spices are plentiful, but dont seem overbearing. Maybe a restrained use of nutmeg? Cinnamon is certainly there and a stack of apple slices with cinnamon and honey on top of some graham crackers wouldnt taste a whole lot different than this. Very good beer, I am impressed. It manages to differentiate itself from the gaggle of pumpkin beers without being too extreme...if that makes any sense!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O:  Glad that this is in 4-packs, because I find it hard to go in on a pumpkin bomber (too much variability)."
""
"Popping the top this brew smells of cinnamon and spice and everything nice. Pours to a deep bronze with a foamy off white head. On the taste this is as close to liquid apple pie as you can get. Nice spices up front with a sweet pumpkin middle with a slightly bitter fade into the aftertaste. The 9% ABV is barely noticeable except for the mouthfeel that is thick like syrup. This is a great fall warmer upper."

"A well-done pumpkin beer that reminded me of pumpkin bread."
""

"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, 2014 vintage bottling. Pours crystal clear golden orange color with a 1-2 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a light amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, toast, honey, light biscuit, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of pumpkin, spices, and moderate pale malt sweetness; with solid strength. Taste of big pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, honey, toast, biscuit, herbal/yeast earthiness. Fair amount of earthy spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, honey, toast, biscuit, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and balance of pumpkin, spices, and moderate pale malt sweetness; with a great malt/spice balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a smooth and fairly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice imperial pumpkin ale. All around good complexity and balance of pumpkin, spices, and moderate pale malt sweetness; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A very enjoyable offering."
""
"This beer is truly something different and stands out from other pumpkin beers out there. It has very rich flavor of pumpkin complimented with a slighter notes of yams, cranberry, and cinnamon to liven it up. It has a bold and ripe flavor that is quite refreshing compared to most pumpkin beers with load up on spice and lack on pumpkin flavor. To me, its very well done. Its an absolute pleasure to drink and I would recommend to anyone!"

"Pretty much a one-trick pony – smells and tastes like nutmeg. The vegetableness (actually a fruit) of the pumpkin hides behind the spice.  The 9% ABV is well hidden, the appearance is unremarkable.  Some will rave, but this is just not an outstanding pumpkin ale."
""
""
""
"One of my favorite pumpkins. Always drink at room temperature. The appearance is a dark orange with an off white head that laces the glass. The smell is full of pumpkin but also some spices such as cinnamon and nutmeg. The taste was great with sweet flavors in the beginning such as the pumpkin and nutmeg, going into heavy cream notes and then finishing with a clean bite. Little boozy but very satisfying."
""

""
""
""
""
""

"The Willamette hops bring out the spice quality in this pumpkin ale. This is a nice big pumpkin ale. Full of alcohol, and flavor. You can get a few different layers of flavor coming in. As the beer comes in and on the back of the tongue.  For me it was like eating a pumpkin loaf of some kind."

"The pour is a clear copper orange with a bubbly off white head. Nose is heavy spice, light pumpkin, fair bit stale grain. Taste has a very strong pumpkin spice, lighter grain than the nose and is also less stale. Soft carb, medium body and creamy palate."

"Wouldn't usually go for pumpkin beers, but had this one was given to me by a friend, so excited to try it. What there is of the thin tan head escapes quickly, leaving only a reddish-orange brew. Aroma consists of spice, yeast, pumpkin and sugar. Can you say dessert? Tastes just like your favorite pumpkin pie with a little alcohol added for good measure. If we are going by style alone, and staying true to moniker, then this beer is top 10."

""
""
"Overall - I remember thinking high of this last year. Don't know if it changed or I did, but I'm not blown away. Really if the cinnamon was toned down and pumpkin toned up, along with some of the other spices, this beer could be a lot better. Not unenjoyable, just not great. 3.5"

"Overall I think this was a pretty good pumpkin beer. I think the smell was this beer's greatest strength. As it warmed I was losing interest, sort of one note and tart, which is kind of strange for a pumpkin beer."

"To give this one credit I did discover last year's batch lurking in my beer cellar, but it clocks in at 9% ABV so I figured it would still be drinkable. Aroma has malty sweetness, nutmeg, and an earthy tartness. The color is a slightly hazy deep orange, with a large white head. Flavor has an initial burst of sweet malt, fading to a pleasant nutmeg character. This has some Sweet-Tart flavors in the tail end mixed with a musty earthiness. Very notable alcohol burn and a bitter astringent finish. Starts great, ends not so good. Perhaps the age has hurt this one, but I haven't had it fresh so I just have to judge based on what is in my glass! I give it a low score for the unpleasant finish--wife and I didn't finish it."
""
"O- A pretty good pumpkin beer that could do with less alcohol and more spice."
""
""
""
""
"750ml into a tulip. Very carbonated 2 finger head. Light amber color. Nose is heavy on malt with very faint spices. Extremely complex taste: malt, cinnamon, nutmeg, pumpkin. Finishes with honey and a spicy alcohol burn that is rather pleasant. Complexity of flavors surprised me a lot. Very enjoyable brew."
""
"Overall, I liked this a little bit less and less the more I drank it. The more I thought about how syrupy and medicinal it tasted, the more that came true."
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinks easy for the style & ABV. Not a big fan of this style or brewery; but this beer is worthy & I would buy this again. Would like to try a new bottle & one with a bout a year; my guess is this best drank within 3 months of release, but you never know..."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was its flavoring. This showed just this phenomenal blend of pumpkin spiciness and the flavors of apple crisp and freshly pressed apple cider that just screams autumn. This remains nice throughout and with warmth, and never becomes overbearing or stale. The nose, on the other hand, does essentially the same thing, making us imagine some glorious hybrid of pumpkin pie and apple crisp, for something of a “pumpkin crisp” type of air. The feel was also highly contributory to the success of this beer, as it stayed light and sticky enough, but not too heavy, cloying, or thick for something so spicy and flavorful. It again, found the right balance, which seems to be a recurring theme with each component we assess. With warmth the grain also reminded us more Belgian styles, and namely the tripel, with the hearty malt backing to be raked over by sweet browned banana inclusions. This is a fantastic drink, and certainly the big surprise sleeper of the pumpkin season, and dare we say, a “smash” hit in our books!!"
""
""
"O- one of my all time favorite pumpkin beers. If you're into the pumpkin beer thing the smashed pumpkin is a must."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It pours light coppery orange color with an aroma fall spices. The pumkin is not overbearing and it is very smooth."
""
""
""
""
"O/D-Like liquified pumpkin pie filling diluted with vodka. That was harsh, but I am not a giant fan of this beer. I don't like Pumpkinhead much but this could be close to as bad."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"People like their sweets, so I can see why this has been selling out all over the place. Nevertheless, it works really well for me in small portions, and pumpkin ice cream is something that I've definitely had before and enjoy, so that added on to the overall experience of drinking this. I'd definitely need help splitting a bottle, but I'm glad I got to try it. One day, however, I'll have the opportunity to have a pumpkin beer that focuses far more on the vegetal aspects of pumpkin rather than merely the spices and sugars that compliment it."
""
"Overall- I really like this beer and if you are looking for a good October Pumpkin beer try this for yourself"

""
"Overall, the beer offers good complexity to allow the drinker something to ponder over and enjoy. It shows great potential. I think in the future, I would cellar this veer for a good while to allow some of the alcohol presence to settle. Still, a good beer."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Shipyard's Smashed Pumpkin doesn't evoke the sipping nature of rich and dessert-like beers; but at 9% perhaps it should. But because of its final hop bitterness and turn to dryness easily masks the alcohol and gives the beer a dangerous drinkability."

""
""

"pretty good pumpkin beer one of the better ive tried. i feel it would have got a higher score if the aroma would have been better, but overall its a very good beer for the type"
""
""

""
""
""
""
"Atmosphere is pretty good. Decent head, continually rising effervescence, and some persistent lacing. Nose is characteristic pumpkin and fall spices. Bitter and pungent, woody and peaty pumpkin... not much else. Overall, this is a good quaff."
""
""
"O:Calling this a pumpkin beer is pushing the envelope a bit. It is a good tasting beer, but it probably is not what you're looking for if you want that classic pumpkin pie flavor. It has a strong alcohol flavor which might be a bit off-putting for people as well. If you're looking for a strong malty alcoholic cinnamon beer, this is right on the line. Seriously if you are into something like cinnamon whiskey you will probably enjoy the beer for that aspect alone. Don't expect much in the way of pumpkin pie though."
"O - A wonderful beer. Great flavor. Really puts you in the mood for fall! There wasnt much aroma or I would have scored it even higher. Will definately pick up again."
""
""
"just opened this bottle today and decided to pour it into my snifter glass. First impressions: wonderful orange amber color with the smell of a fresh baked pumpkin pie. the added pumpkin and little spice allow for a wonderful drinking seasonal ale that feels like silk when drinking. the head is a gorgious thick white cap that hangs around especially in an etched bottom glass. i would definately recommend this brew to anyone looking for a fall beer that isn't overly sweet to drink"
""
""
""
""
"O: I appreciate spices that are well brewed but here while they stay true to their tastes they need to be brought into balance with everything else. Given the high abv as well I'd rather spend my time with something else"
"O: It's good. I'm not going to fork over $8 for it again, but it's worth a try at least once. Their regular Pumpkinhead is much better, IMO, and a lot more my price point."

""
""
""
""
"Overall: Pretty disappointed here. I didn't really like the pumkinhead, but I was holding out for this one. Maybe it being in a larger bottle fooled me. When next year rolls around, I'll definitely pick around this pumpkin ale. Other brews are much better in my opinion."

"This beer starts off rough around the edges, but everything comes together the more you drink it. It's like a caramel apple in a bottle.

""
""
""
""
"Bottle shared by a friend. Pours a beautiful clear orange with very small white head. Aroma is big pumpkin and a bit of spice, actually one of the better pumpkin beer aromas I have encountered. Flavor is big pumpkin and light on the spice. I like it that way. The pumpkin flavor really shines in this one, some sweet malt on the back end that lingers and plays with the gourd funk. Slight bitter finish. Easy drinking with medium carbonation. Not bad."

"Bought two 22oz bottles of this - poured a beautiful orange into a mason jar. The smell was amazing - felt like it was Thanksgiving and there was a pumpkin pie in the oven. There was a perfect balance of pumpkin spice and cinnamon in this beer to make it really enjoyable while also making sure it wasn't too overpowering like other pumpkin beers. The pour left a slightly orange head. Overall, I loved this beer, and I plan on buying it for the rest of the fall."

"MF) Very creamy and smooth with slight carbonation. You can feel the heat from the alcohol as you drink this beer. In the finish the spices like to stay and dance around your mouth."

"O - a pretty decent pumpkin beer, but not one if the better imperials. I would take pumpking instead any time. Not something you would like to drink a lot of in one sitting."

"Best Pumpkin Beer I have ever had. Pumpkin taste is so sweat, no over powering, no BS with over spicing. Appearance a light golden brown colour. Even on smell, just pumpkin. Like I said on the spice, only a light taste on the sides of the tongue 3/4 of the way through the sip, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves. I am blown away. This is the way a pumkin beer should taste, the balance in the brew is amazing!"
""
""
"Overall - Ugghh. Tastes quite literally like a pumpkin cola. I'm sorry, this is just awful. If there's any redeeming value, it's that it does well to hide the 9% ABV, but that's it. Not only would I never buy it again, I'd care to never see it on shelves again. Maybe the worst pumpkin ale I've ever had. I'd rather have a BMC than this dreck. I don't believe much in drain pours, but this one's getting serious consideration."

"Overall - This would be pretty good if the strong alcohol taste didn't gross me out."

"(O)- A decent beer for the style, but it gets lost with the high (way too high) hop addition."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Enjoyable with very good pumpkin and pumpkin pie spices which are in good balance with one another. Easy to drink because the beer is not overly sweet and the alcohol is pretty well hidden in the taste - though at 9% ABV this is very much a sipping beer."
"O: Pretty good. Pumpkin beers are not generally my favorite, but this one is acceptable. Wouldn't seek out another."

"Not bad for a pumpkin ale. Pours a bright orange coppery color with a small tan head into a snifter. The smell is strong pumpkin pie with lots of spices. Big sugary sweetness going on in this one, with a good nutmeg, cinnamon, pumpkin taste. Over all its was a bit too sweet for my taste. But one of the better pumpkin ales I've tried."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, one of the best pumpkin beers I have had. Not a sugar bomb and it really seems like there is actual pumpkin here, not just tons of spices. Perfectly balanced and drinkable at 9% with just a slight, pleasant warming. A wonderful fall beer that everyone should seek out."

"Overall: lighter body, cider-like consistency. Not only a pumpkin beer- a very good Fall seasonal."
""
""
"O: Great pumpkin beer, if lightly artificial and/or heavy-handed. Recommended."
""
""
"Appearance in a very nice amber with a good head at pour. Head remains around the rim of the glass but mostly disappates over time to a thin rings round the edge of the glass. Smells of pumpkin, nutmeg and other spices - strong and almost a hint of sour. Sour disappears in the taste and overwhelmed with pumpkin and heavy malts. This beer is sweet in flavor - maybe a molasses or brown sugar."

"Mouthfeel is great. Thick enough to meet the expectations of the type, but equally easy drinking. The allspice lingers in the back of the mouth, though not detrimentally - kind of just reminding you what you're drinking. A damn good time if your looking for the pied version of a pumpkin ale. Thank you Pugsley!"
""
"o this is a great easy to find pumpkin beer, i definitely drikn it a lot when i want a pumpkin beer. i recommend it if you like pumpkin beer."
""
"Overall the off flavor and lackluster aroma keep this beer down. Nice pumpkin flavor and very refreshing."
"This is one of Shipyard's best. However I would recommend a handful of Imperial pumpkin ales over this one - Wachusett's Imperial Pumpkin and Southern Tier's Pumking are 2 examples. But give it a shot - I always root hard for New England breweries."
""
""
""
"3.5 D: Tasty pumpkin brew. Worth a try."
"O- I enjoyed this beer , I would recommend this beer if you like Pumpkin Beers"
""
"A clean poor with a nice head revealed a solid pumpkin beer. Avoiding the usual problem of being too sweet and too pumpkin-y, Shipyard's beer enjoyed a nice fall aroma with crip pumpkin and spice smells. Mouthfeel was uneven; at times the beer seemed a little thin while others it seemed to have more body too it. At the right price, this could be a nice beer to pair with certain fall flavored pasta dishes."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's a pretty good beer and with the high ABV, both a sipper and something you'll enjoy in the cooler months. As it warms, the beer actually gets a bit worse. That said, it's still better than a lot of other pumpkin beers I've had and is something I'd enjoy having more of."
""
""
""
""
"O: A very decent pumpkin beer. It is a little sweet for my liking, but the flavors are good and well balanced and they didn't go overboard with the spices."
"I have to agree that the wheat malt didn't add much of anything except to make this thinner and I suppose more drinkable; but at 9% and at just a hair under 8 bucks at the LCBO, I'm looking for something to savour, not to drown myself in. Still, I maintain my """above-average""" rating, and if Pumking or the other biggun's aren't coming Ontario way this year, this will certainly suffice for Hallowe'en drinking."
""
""
""
"D - This is an excellent Pumpkin Ale... My only two real complaints at that the flavors are ever so slightly artificial/cloying and the cheap foil used on the cap... Other than that this one is very good to excellent in all facets... I really enjoyed this take to at reproducing actual pumpkin pie in a bottle... The 9% ABV is well hidden..."
""
""
""
"Note - Pumpkin Ales are not for me. So it is a bit negatively biased but still scores well over others that i have had."
""
"M - Medium bodied with good carbonation. Fairly dry from the wheat and higher alcohol. Finish is clean with only a hint of lingering sugary tartness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O- Just not enough character for a beer this big. It's just too bland and vague. It's like they wanted to make it approachable. Wrong tactic. For $11 a bomber I was expecting a lot more flavor. They should through out the wheat and Munich and replace them with amber malt and a good English crystal. Maybe a bit higher mash rest or a less attenuative ale yeast. A good English strain would really help with the over all body and flavor. Just too plain for the style, and the price."
"Overall I would say its fairly decent, I did enjoy it and have in the past quite a few times, not my favourite pumpkin ale, but one that I have purchased on more than one occasion and always enjoyed."
"this is one of the best pumpkin beers out there in my opinion. in a total juxtaposition to their pumpkin head this beer features the squash over the spice, and is one of my favorites right now. it pours a fairly dense looking orange color, more spring than fall in hue, with a two inch white head on top, almost nitro in appearance. smells like fresh pumpkins, maybe stewed pumpkin, and with a spice thats a product ofn the yeast, not a product of too much nutmeg in the brew kettle. the flavor is equally chill on the spice front, but pungent on the earthy vegetable front. some notes of vanilla and candy in there too, but this isnt a sweet beer. the mouthfeel is huge, full bodied, but relatively easy drinking. i think its maybe not so easy drinking, just so interesting and delicious that i keep putting these down. the alcohol is present, but its complementary to whats going on, not a distraction. this a an absolutely essential beer to try this fall. i might go get another one right now actually."

"Overall: I have to say my second favorite pumpkin beer, my first is Pumking by Southern Tier but this beer definitely hangs up there up. Rare I mention another brew to compare it to but just to let you know you are not drinking bullsh*t. Try it for yourself and love it, Salud!"
""
""
"O – This is a pretty good pumpkin beer and one of the few that showcases the actual pumpkin rather than pumpkin pie spices. At first, the high ABV isn’t apparent at all, and the beer is very drinkable for 9%. As the beer warms, though, the alcohol becomes much more apparent and takes a little bit away from the overall flavor. I’d also like to see a little better head retention and some lacing to go along with all that carbonation that’s there right after opening. Still, this is a tasty beer and much, much better than that other pumpkin beer that Shipyard makes."
""
""
""
"Overall, this is strange. It tastes more like a spicy cinnamon beer than a pumpkin beer - trending toward mouthwash."
"It's no secret that I'm not a huge fan of pumpkin beers. I wasn't impressed with the appearance and the smell of this beer, but the taste and ABV redeemed it. The pumpkin spice shines through nicely with minimal cheap maltiness. Not a bad attempt."
""
"O: pretty good. it's really like drinking pumpkin pie and the flavors are great. pretty drinkable but these beers aren't quite made for sessioning, especially one at 9% abv"
""
""
"Much thinner body then expected, lower amounts of carbonation. Lots of pumpkin flavor though. Semi-sweet yet squash like pumpkin flavor up front with faint pumpkin pies spices to balance. Oddly simply for such a big beer as well. One of the few pumpkin beers where the pumpkin and not the spice is the star of the show. However unlike Sam Adams fat jack, it's not just an overload of pumpkin flavor. Spiced just enough to balance. Pretty unique pumpkin beer to be honest, doesnt try to taste like pumpkin pie like most, lets the pumpkin shine through while still being beer enough to incorporate good balance and flavor. Impressive. Again, doesnt drink like a 9% beer, flavor wise, body wise or alcohol wise. Very mysterious."
""
""
""
""
"So much better that the Shipyard Pumpkin Ale. The color was yellow/orange, with an average amount of foam and lace. The smell of spices was very much evident in the aroma. The flavor was well balanced between spices, malts, hops, etc. A very pleasant surprise with a soft tasty, well balanced Pumpkin Ale."
"O: This ranks as my number 2 pumpkin beer beating out Schlafly and Weyerbacher. Still no Southern Tier Pumking, but damn close!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This was very pumpkin and spice forward. As it warmed, I got some darker fruit flavors, spice and alcohol. Decent, but I prefer the Pumking I had a few days ago."
"Served from a bottle into glass; not a very impressive pumpkin beer. Considering some of the other beers in the style, I don't really see any reason to purchase this one over the others. Very subtle pumpkin notes (too subtle) and a bitter finish. No problem finishing the bottle; but next time I'm going with a pumpking."

"The spices appear more in the flavor. The pumpkin flavor hits right up front with the nutmeg and allspice flavors. The beer is sweet and has a touch of alcohol flavor. The feel is medium-heavy and a bit syrupy. There are nice flavors, but the finish might be a touch too sweet for my tastes. I would like it more if it were a bit drier. That being said, this is one of the better pumpkin ales out there."

"They are nice people who responded to Questions but when you limit a brew to a specific area, no one can queston how good it is unless you go there. Beer is subjective. Guess what? Iron City Amber from Pittsburgh is pretty good!"

"O: Maybe the weirdest pumpkin ale I've tried so far, with the yeast playing a major role. That's ok, because I honestly find pumpkin ales struggling for palatable flavours. The pumpkin is usually too gourdy and subtle, so breweries depend on spice bombs, or worse diacetyl bombs. This is a refreshing take, and it was executed quite well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pretty atypical flavor for pumpkin - I don't think I kept it oo long or suspect any mishandling. Nonetheless, it was tasty & fun to pick apart. I'd call it more a """full""" beer than pumpkin."
""
"Overall: good, well-balanced warming beer, but not really delivering the pumpkin flavour expected"
""
""
""
"Out of a bomber bottle this beer was a perfectly clear orange color with a small amount of rising carbonation. The head was a skimp half-finger of beige bubbles that quickly dissipated to a tiny collar. The aroma was mostly of sweet malts, some generic citrus, a light note of spices and, of course, subdued pumpkin. The flavors were much better than the aroma, heavily spiced with lots of vanilla, cloves, cinnamon, coriander, orange and nutmeg. But it was definitely punchy and the booze did interfere with the pumpkin element. The mouthfeel was good, the body medium/full and the carbonation low."
"O: There's not much pumpkin going on in this but a whole lot of allspice. Alcohol is well hidden. A decent Pumpkin Ale."
""
"O- A very solid beer that I would definitely drink again and rank among my favorites in the category (though I have probably had less than 10 so take that for what it's worth)."
""
""
""
"Pours light amber with full inch of white foam. Light pumpkin smell. Brown sugar too, and nutmeg. Mild pumpkin taste, some light sour notes, heavy cinammon and nutmeg, firm hop. Really smooth and balanced with a full pumpkin flavor. Spices don't overwhelm. Really good. Better than the Shipyard Pumpkinhead, for sure."
"O: One of my favorites of the year - very much a sleeper."
"O - This beer wasn't too bad, but not a must have for me. The taste improves as the beer warms, but was still a bit too boozy and lacked a strong showing of pumpkin and spices. In the end, I was glad to get to try this, but will have to look elsewhere to get my fill of pumpkin flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability: It's a smooth drinkable beer accompanied with decent flavors and aromas."
""
""
""
"Solid take on the style with some unfortunate drops in the smell department. But the taste matters most, and Smashed Pumpkin is good, memorable, and one I'd very much go for again."
""
"In conclusion, by third stop on the Pumpkin Brew trail has been a very nice stop. The Shipyard Smashed Pumpkin is a pumpkin-dominated big-boy beer for the folks that really love pumpkin beer (like me). It's a little sweet, relatively easy drinking, and a pretty good representation of pumpkin beer. If you see one on the shelf, give it a try!"
"O - I love the smashed series. I'm a bit overwhelmed by this brew, a bit too spicy. I'm super pumped """some""" shipyard brews have started being distributed to CO... Thanks for a spicy brew Andyavalanche."
""
""
""

"Bright orange hue. Modest white head. Pumpkin pie spices and wet wood make up the nose. Flavors are not good. Taste like pumpkin cologne. Spices are a bit heavy. The alcohol come through quite a bit too. Light body. This one is not any better than the abomination known as pumpkin head."
""
""
""
"Overall - A nice beer that wasn't overly sweet like some of the other stronger pumpkin beers. It does pack quite a spicy punch though. Happy I gave it a try but wouldn't seek out again. Merry xmas!"
"I would definitely try this again in future years as it hold promise."
""
""
"P – Stellar pairings with dark meat turkey and stuffing. The alcohol cuts through the richness of the turkey, and the pumpkin hooks up with the rich breadiness of the stuffing and doesn’t let go."
""
"O- Not a huge fan of the style, but this one was not very good."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A very solid pumpkin beer, good flavors."

""
""
""
"O: Overall this is a solid pumpkin. I don't think it deserves some of the low scores that I see on here. I would recommend trying it."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Better than their Pumpkinhead, but I am still not a fan. The sour flavor that I despised in the other beer shows up in this one as well, though not as heavy. Still drinkable, but needs much improvement when there are so many better alternatives."
""
"Pours a light golden color with some obvious carbonation. In four words: Booze meets pumpkin beer. It’s lightly bodied with a pumpkin/pumpkin spice flavor. It has a sweet malty finish on what’s a big, boozy beer. I’m left wondering how it would develop with some age on it."
""
""
""

"D: Balance makes this one work. Candy sweetness on the one side, and spice, gourd, & booze on the other. Very much a sipper and a dessert beer. Incredibly better than Pumpkin Head."
"O: This beer is hilariously buttery. I can't even fathom why it has a B average. I actually made pumpkin beer bread with the remainder, and in lieu of the butter and spice requirement, I threw in this beer. The bread turned out horrible."
"O- it's an ok beer. but I think there is way to much alcohol taste to it. Needs to tone it back on the alcohol and step up more pumpkin flavor."
"Pours a clear light copper-orange with a thin white head. The scent is very spice heavy, nutmeg, very autumnal scent, and sweet. The flavor is very strong spiced, very sweet, almost like a pumpkin candy liquified. Filling and warming to drink, smooth mouthfeel. It's a little on the candied side, but enjoyable for a pumpkin ale with high ABV."
"kind of a remnant of. like you got home late for dinner and you smell the pumpkin pie being served and when you get in the dining room someone is shovelling the very last piece down."
"On tap at burger. in Santa Cruz. Pours a tangerine gold with a wimpy white head. Smells and tastes like dirty cinnamon. Some brown sugar sweetness and vague pumpkin-ness. Tart and slightly acidic, over-spiced especially nutmeg and cinnamon, sweetish, dirty mineral finish. Just what you’d expect from Shipyard."
"A good tasting pumpkin ale. Not a whole lot of pumpkin, but it is there, and there's also a nice hop character too."
"2010 - Sweeter with more pronounced pumpkin and a noticeable bready malt flavour that was not evident at all in the '11. No hop bite at all, as was evident in the finish in the '11."
"Overall: This is a weird beer in general. There is a tartness that clashes with everything else. Not really picking up much pumpkin or spice. I wouldn't have another."
"I take my hat off for Mr. Pugsley of Shipyard Brewing! This is an excellent, rich, and enjoyable strong pumpkin ale!"
"I thought this was a decent pumpkin beer, but nothing exceptional. A little disappointed. Too sweet, strange cider qualities, and too high in ethanol to really make me consider this one again."
"A pleasant surprise and definitely a beer I'll seek again."
"I really like this beer, and I'd rate the taste a notch higher if the booze was buried a little more. However, it is nice to have a pumpkin seasonal around with a kick."
"O: this tastes like a somewhat better, but still not very good version of their Pumpkinhead. It still smells and tastes like a chemical cleaner."
"If not for the high alcohol, Shipyard Smashed Pumpkin would be a good example of the style for people to cut their teeth on. What it lacks a little in character it makes up for in drinkability; what it lacks in malt it makes up for in spicing. In other words, it's a serviceable ale that might disappoint aficionados but will very much appeal to newbies out there."
"Overall: A pretty solid pumpkin beer overall. Full flavored and well balanced."
"Not the best pump beer this fall (that's probably Cambridge Brewing Company's Great Pumpkin Ale). Also, at 8.99 a bomber, I'd much, much rather take one of the following: CBC Great Pump, 6pack Smutty Pump, 4 pack DFH Punkin' - all priced lower. That being said, I don't think Shipyard gets a fair shake on BA. Not bad at all, Pugsley. Now, get rid of that Pumpkin head stuff and put this in affordable 12 packs."
"A well built pumpkin beer that alludes to pumpkin pie spices without overwhelming the palette. Honestly, I'd like to see even a little more pumpkin character though clearly a good representation of the style, I much preferred TREAT or even DFH Punkin."
"Overall one of my favorite pumpkin beers, just under good gourd."
"O- I like it, not the best pumpkin beer, but towards the top somewhere. I feel like this had very quad-like components as a base beer which added a nice complexity. Would definitely drink again!"
"Bottle: Poured a lightly hazy amber color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and some good lacing. Aroma consists of light nutmeg and cinnamon with solid caramel notes. Taste is dominated by some solid malt backbone with a semi-sweet touch of caramel which is very well balanced by some cinnamon and nutmeg. Body is quite full with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Easily drinkable with nice balance and alcohol isn’t’ apparent though can be somewhat dangerous considering how drinkable this beer is. One of the best beer I have tried form this brewery."
"I'm not wild about the cider stuff going on here. But, I'm glad I bought this beer, even though it was $8.99 for one bottle... This may be the 9% ABV talking here."
"Taste is a clear and clean pumkin skin and meat with pumkin pie spices and a little caramel. The middle warms up the pumkin flavor and showas off some toasted, bready caramel malts. The finish is smooth, warm, and atringent. The 9% abv. leaves a little twinge to the palate on the finish and linger."
"O: A good beer, but maybe not worth the price tag. I'd love it for $4."
"Taste? Sweet...then bitter, but always boozy. If you want to hit the pumpkin patch for 10 bucks a bomber, there are much better places to go."
"4 oz. sample poured on draft. Pours a light amber hue. Nose is very subdued. Nearly nonexistent. The taste is weird. I feel like I'm drinking the syrup from a jar of maraschino cherries. WTF. Strangely enough, this is one of very few pumkin beers where I can taste...PUMPKIN. That's nice. The mouthfeel is very thin and sweet. That cherry taste persists throughout. Overall this is just a strange beer. Don't know what they were going for here."
"O Overall this is a decent beer for its price and lack of pazazz i do not think i will be revisiting this."
"D: Drinkability is quite good: the alcohol is definitely there but it's more warming than anything else."
"O - Overall, this is a great pumpkin ale better for the holidays paired with some thanksgiving or pumpkin pie on a cold night for dessert. Good drinker but a little too expensive ($8.99) to be a good drinker. Whats with the damn twist off bottle... I was hoping to keep this bottle for homebrew!"
"Pours a clean and bright orange color with modest head and little lacing. Scent is lead by sweet malts and slightly heavy spicing, pumpkin pie appears in the back end with a bit of leafy hops and alcohol on the nose. Taste leads with a bitter push of hoping and seasonal spices, sweet malt and pumpkin pie make an appearance in the mid, finishes with odd bitter, herbal metallic note with noticeable alcohol. Disappointingly thin and over bubbly. I may actually prefer the regular old Shipyard Pumpkin to this beast."
"**The label is very cool. It alone is enough to convince me to buy it. Very nice work."
"O - A tasty pumpkin ale and worth taking for a spin. I've had some better pumpkin ales, but this one is still well represented and at 9% it's well worth a try!"
"All in all, this beer is a clusterfuck of extremes that don't work well together at all. Shipyard's next destination should be the drawing board."
"D - Nothing to really write home about, but a good beer none the less."
"O - This has good drinkability. It is a pretty tasty pumpkin beer, and I can easily drink a few glasses of it. I thought the sweetness and spice balanced each other out pretty well. Overall, I thought it was a rather nice beer. I recommend giving it a shot. I'd buy it again."
"O: Decent pumpkin ale but this reminds me more of a belgian strong pale ale, which would leave me to believe I didn't get enough pumpkin in my bottle. If I had a choice, I would stick to the Smashed Blueberry."
"D - Alright beer; could have used more nose to entice my senses; I actually got real excited about this beer and was let down after taking a deep-deep whiff of nothing; way more taste than scent to this beer"
"Aroma of nutmeg and other spices. Pours a deep orange with tan head. This is my favorite pumpkin ale I’ve tried. Something Pumking is just too much for me to even finish a full glass. Blast of nutmeg, some cinnamon and a tinge of pumpkin which is perfect for me. Almost belgiany on the palette. Loved it!"
"O - Not a fan...it doesn't feel terribly well balanced, and the malt sweetness is too over the top for me. The fruity alcohol feels out of place, and it feels under carbonated."
"Easy to drink, ok beer."
"one of my favorite pumpkin beers. not to be confused with the dreaded pumpkinhead, this one is worth seeking out. recommended."
"Poured from a bomber with no freshness date. Poured to out bright, vibrant orange. Lots of pumpkin flavor, hides the boozes well. The pumpkin flavor comes first before the spice, spices are a lil mute and in the background. Mouthfeel is rather smooth. Overall very enjoyable and easy drinking."
"EDIT: I would add that this improves quite a bit given a chance to warm. Grain and ginger settles down a bit. Score stands."
"O - the ABV is very well hidden and it is a spicy tasty treat, as often is the case with pumpkin ales the spices are more prominent than the pumpkin, but a delicious fall treat none the less"
"Drinkability: One of the better New England Pumpkin brews and light years ahead of Pumpkinhead. I like the vanilla tastes and the complexity. This reminds me a lot of Pumpking minus the hoppiness. I will revisit this next year."
"O - a very nice brew, not Pumking but definitely worth buying again"
"Poured from a 22 oz bomber into a St. Bernardus goblet. I poured straight into the bottom of the glass with a bit of umph to try to coax a nice head on the beer, to no avail. A think white head was all I could get. Aromas of sweet cinnamon, almost like red hot candies. Plus some nutmeg and cooked pumpkin. Cinnamon is dominant on the palate, a decent sweetness and just a bit of pumpkin flavor. The higher alcohol makes itself known as well. Medium bodied with a decent creamy carbonated mouthfeel. Overall definitely not my favorite pumpkin beer, but not bad, especially for what I paid. (2.99 a bomber) I might buy a couple more and cellar as the Bros. suggested."
"O- Somewhat disappointed by this one. I had high expectations and it just did not meet them. Not enough pumpkin flavor- too heavy on the ginger and nutmeg. Mouthfeel was lacking. Still, a decent pumpkin ale."
"If you like Pumpkinhead, odds are that you'll love this. As I've said throughout the review, I'm not a Pumpkinhead fan, but I still think this is pretty decent. I've had much better pumpkin ales, but this is by no means awful. I'm not sure I'll get it again, but I have no regrets about the bottle I bought. Worth a try for fans of pumpkin beers."
"Another hooplah-surrounded pumpkin beer, so you know I've gotta try it. You know me so well... It pours a clear copper topped by a finger of off-cream-white foam. The nose comprises brown sugar, toasted caramel, clove, vanilla, white bread, and a strange whiff of menthol-like alcohol bubbling up from the bottom. This last part really keeps me from enjoying the smell. The taste follows pretty closely, though there is definitely some pumpkin going on in there now, and, unfortunately, the alcohol now resembles strident rubber cement. Wow, not sure what that is, but it is just awful. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly slick feel. Overall, either something ain't right here, or this beer is just plain bad. Either way, I did not enjoy myself here..."
"O- I'm so used to Pumpkin beers really just being all Allspice, mixed with heavy syrupy flavor. This really takes the other creamy side really focusing on the side of the pumpkin/melon taste. Overall not bad, I want more aroma but a good beer for a pumpkin beer and for the holidays."
"D/O- Wanted to like this one but I'd advise passing. Many other pumpkin beers out there that I'd recommended buying."
"O= Decent pumpkin beer. I had it before the Southern Tier Pumking and I thought that one was better and the price was better."
"Overall: The regular Shipyard pumpkin is bunk! This stuff is the real deal. Enough flavor but not over the top with the spices. Enough ABV for this time of year, but not too much where it is a struggle to get this down. Smooth and refreshing but big as well. Well done. Cheers!!"
"Overall, I don’t think you could want much more out of a pumpkin beer. The only drawback is that the alcohol clouds some of the initial flavor until the astringency wears off."
"Overall I liked this better than other high abv pumpkins...better rounded than Pumpking IMO."
"O: A pretty nice take on the style, all of the traditional pumpkin-type flavours are present and are reasonably balanced. I found the ABV to detract a bit from the overall experience, came across as a bit hot without the flavour punch to back it up."
"O- Rank top 5 on my pumpkin beers. MUCH better than the pumpkinhead, which is comparable to (and I was mistaken for) a pumpkin cider."
"Definately amazing compared to Pumpkinhead..lol.. Bottle looks cool"
"Orange copper colour, one finger white head, small spots of lace. Smell is lightly funky, yeast, spices with cinnamon and nutmeg being the most apparent, touches of pie crust like maltiness, fairly active hop profile as well. Taste is initially spicy and very much like a pumpkin pie, nutmeg and cloves, well spiced, almond, yeasty, nice pumpkin flavours, good bitterness with a cinnamon and spice finish. Medium carbonation, medium full body, good feel. Solid pumpkin brew, nicely spiced without going over the top, alcohol barely noticeable. Had no problem finishing the bomber myself and for a few buck less than Pumking I will grab a couple more while its still around."
"I think its between this and DFH's Punkin Ale for my favorite Pumpkin beer so far this year. I recommend this to anyone into balanced pumpkin beers. Very good."
"One of the more balanced pumpkin ales that I've tried and the warming effect is most definitely welcome."
"This is a pretty solid pumpkin beer. Probably one of the better ones on the market."
"Pretty good enjoyable brew, warms a bit, more of a sipper than a gulper, and worth seeking out when it's in season."
"Overall a solid pumpkin ale, which is slightly high praise because I've never been much of a fan of the style."
"Good seasonal sipper."
"Nose is pleasant pumpkin and nutmeg, light caramel and a hint of graham cracker. Flavor is muted on the pumpkin unlike many pumpkin beers, light a strong golden ale with pumpkin perhaps - quite a spicy character from the hops which also lend a bittering finish, plenty of hops in this one, slightly fruity, booze present there as well. Medium sweet body, pretty lively carbonation, a big beer for sure. Pumpkin is not in your face, balanced but still festive - if it weren't for the obvious booze here this could be a really fine example of how to make a pumpkin beer without being pie in a glass. Interesting take on the style but make no mistake, this one is HOT."
"D: i was expecting a little more punch in the face from the pumpkin, but this is pretty manageable especially considering the 9%abv. definitely flavorful and drinkable, just saying i was expecting more of a pumpkin bomb than what is in my glass."
"O: I had this a couple years ago and thought it was awesome, but upon trying it again I am severely disappointed. I don't know if they changed the recipe or what, but this just wasn't that good."
"Overall: This bottle tasted absolutely nothing like the ones that I had last year. I did not detect a hint of the pumpkin spice aroma or taste that I'd come to expect. Had a distinctive orange creamsickle aroma/taste to it. Not bad, but something was definitely off."
"Every autumn I'm good for about three pumpkin beers before I want to vomit because I hate them so much, so I'm glad I started with this one. It's one of the better that I have ever had."
"overall a little disappointing... it did get a little better/more drinkable about half way through but i don't think i'll be picking this up again."
"Poured from a bomber into a pint glass, the beer pours a slightly hazed, orange-yellow coloring with a fairly substantial, two inch, white, foamy head that quickly settles into a thin, low profile head. The nose is a complex blend of wheat and slight citrus sweetness, with pumpkin and spice highlights. The spice nose is heavy in cinnamon when you get down in there, and even more so as the beer warms. Flavors are toasted grain and bready background, with the cinnamon present again. Also, some nutmeg spicing that helps to balance the pumpkin richness that finds its way onto the palate mid-way through the taste. The rich flavors stay through the aftertaste, but the beer remains light bodied, which keeps it from being overpowering. Very decent cling to the glass. The finish is quick and clean, and the increased ABV doesn't really present itself past the body/mouthfeel. Very tasty, interesting brew. The label recommends mixing with Blue Fin, which is their stout. I think that may be worth a try..."
"T: Candi sugar, big sweet malts and a lot of raisin. If I hadn't known this was a pumpkin ale, I would have assumed it was a barleywine or a grand cru from the taste. A little too boozy for any hint of pumpkin to come through."
"Pours a dark golden orange colour. Smells of cinnamon and pumpkin pie. The taste follows suit, although it doesn't follow as the smell would suggest. Considering the high percentage though, its quite drinkable. Just the overall flavour could use a little more pumpkin touch. Decent beer."
"O - this is a nice, easy drinking beer, but it doesn't feel like a pumpkin ale to me."
"I had high hopes for this one, and they were definitely not met. A disappointment for me. I suppose for those who are looking for more pumpkin and less pie, this might be a good choice- but it still has some off flavours going on that do not work for me. For strong pumpkin ales, I will be sticking with Pumking, thank you very much."
"O: this was an eminently enjoyable drink I would buy it throughout the year if it were available."
"Overall I like this. I'm happy to see that Shipyard can make a good pumpkin brew, and would always pick this one over Pumpkinhead."
"O - Overall this tastes like a sweet pumpkin ale, pretty good representation of the style too, tastes like october."
"Overall: One of the better pumpkin styles I could find at the store, it wasn't what I was looking for. I would like a more dessert beer, but you can't fault this beer for something that it doesn't try to succeed at. My failed expectations aside, it's more than a session, beer, but would go well with light dishes. It's one of the better pumpkin beers out there, IMO."
"This beer was strong, but very good. If I was expecting Shipyard Pumpkinhead, then I would have been very very disipointed, but I was expecting it and was ready for the malty goodness with a hint of cinnmin, nutmeg, brownsugar notes. Thank you shipyard for putting out another great beer."
"MF/O: Good feel to this one, pretty thick, alcohol is hidden well but warms. This is not a good example of a pumpkin beer at all...in fact this is the second worst pumpkin ale I've had aside from Shipyard's regular pumpkin ale...there are much better examples out there"
"Overall, a strong balance brought in a surprisingly quaff-able beer, thoroughly impressed, new contender for one of the top pumpkin beers Ive tried. Gonna have to pickup a few more bombers before and after October 31."
"On-tap at Ale+Witch. The brew pours a translucent brassy gold hue, and has a wispy white head atop. The flavor and aroma suggest all things deliciously autumnal, from pumpkin pie and candy corn, to mulled cider and applesauce. The feel is a bit thin, and that is my major complaint, but that is nitpicking, as the feel is still fairly good. This is at least the Cadillac of Pumpkin Brew, though I imagine it falls short of pumpkin Rolls-Royce status."
"O - I really wanted to like this beer. The regular Shipyard pumpkin is one of my favorites of the style, but this disappointed. I tried sip after sip to see if it would grow on me or mellow out as it warmed, but I could not get over that vegetal, raw, rind flavor."
"I'd get this one again. Definitely add to my fall line-up."
"M + D: Medium bodied, a little bit of weight that clings to the tongue. Alcohol is modest, adding just a little note of added spiciness and a touch of warmth as it goes down. The beer is not 'fake' tasting--an issue I find coming up with many pumpkin brews. The only thing that might hold me back from returning to it would be the price point. In a market where some of the competition will sell six-packs (@ $8.99, 72 oz. = ~12 cents per oz vs. 22 oz / ~41 cents per oz.) , I don't know if it stands out enough for the added cost. Price notwithstanding, this is a decent, quality brew."
"The mouthfeel is nice, smooth and a little crisp with a nice flow in a solid medium body with ample but not overdone carbonation."
"Horrible. A sickly sweet syrupy mess with one hell of an alcohol burn. No balance, weak body, pale uninspiring color. Just not a good beer, and for almost $10 a bottle I feel ripped off. It's clear that there are few pumpkin ales that are more than a gimmick."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Pours an orange-amber with a small amount of white head and minimal lacing. Aroma is strong of spices, especially cinnamon. There is a light boozey smell too. Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Taste is spicey, and again with much cinnamon. There is some, but not much of a pumpkin flavor there. This isn't a great pumpkin style beer, but not horrible."
"Overall a very enjoyable example of a pumpkin beer and one I'll certainly purchase again soon."
"It looked like Autumn in a glass, with the color of pumpkin and a massive creamy tan head. It left thick rings of lace on the glass. the smell was mostly metal and nutmeg and the flavor was sweet hints of brown sugar and very subtle pumpkin and spice flavors. The best pumpkin ales have muted spice, and this one is muted; much more so than Shipyard's regular pumkin ale. The feel was a weakness: very thin, with nothing left behind."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation being low. overall it was a pretty good pumpkin beer. The spices seemed a little strong at times, but still pretty tasty overall. I liked it a lot better then their pumpkinhead one, but not nearly as much as say Pumking. Solid pumpkin offering I'd be happy to but again for the season."
"Glassware: bomber split into snifters"
"O - I like this beer for it's moderate sweetness paired with a spice finish that captures the feeling of the fall very well. Considering that this is only the second pumpkin beer that I have ever tried, I could be exaggerating. Nonetheless, I thoroughly enjoyed this and will try it again soon."
"Overall it's flavor improves (as the bottle suggests) as it warms but even around optimal temperature, I'd like to get more pumpkin out of this 'smashed pumpkin'. I pretty much enjoy anything resembling the flavor profile of pumpkin pie, so even if it fell a bit shy in the pumpkin department, yes..I think this one was worth trying."
"o - Overall an above average pumpkin ale, but it didn't live up to my memory of it. Lots of spices and cinnamon and not at much pumpkin as I would have liked. Would have it again but not my favorite."
"O: This beer has a good amount of flavors of pumpkins and spices and is relatively easy to drink because it isn’t that sweet and the alcohol is well masked from the taste."
"I've had this before and I remember it being an over-spiced, bigger version of Shipyard's Pumpkinhead which I don't like either. I remembered correctly. Drainpour."
"Medium thickness in the mouthfeel. One of the better pumpkin ales I've had."
"O - good example of the style."
"O: Exactly as advertised, a great tasting pumpkin beer. Will buy again."
"Overall a tasty beer. Might try again at Thanksgiving."
"Overall, this beer begins well, with a delicious aroma that reminds me instantly of grandma's house, and places this beer on par with Southern Tier's Pumking in terms of enticing pumpkin-flavored beer scents. But the beer proves far too spicy on the tongue, and the resulting imbalance unfortunately takes away from the pumpkin and ale flavors. It's still a very nice pumpkin beer, mind you--much better fare than many of its peers--and the 9% ABV is well hidden by sugars and flavor, but as a whole the brew wants for balance and a shade more subtlety."
"O - A decent pumpkin ale, yet this one shows a strong spice profile as the main attraction. Its warm and spicy, but missed the mark some with the pumpkin fruit and sweet components in my opinion."
"O - Pretty darn good. Very likable if you are looking for something that isn't extremely heavy on the spices yet still retains the pumpkin pie characteristics of many other pumpkin ales."
"Overall: A pretty solid pumpkin ale considering Shipyard's other offering. Good brew to tide one over till September."
"Color is light for a pumpkin. Almost golden yellow, only slightly orange/brown. Big, bubbly head and a fully carbonated body. Spices pop out but don't stand out like a pie spices. It smells artificial almost like out of an aerosol can. Light grains back up the awkward spice character. Light malt body for the flavor. Crisp almost like a pale or pilsner malt was used. A lot of carbonation in the light body. Once again vibrant but synthetic nutmeg, cinnamon and pumpkin. Bubbly finish with the spices lingering over some sour malts. Interesting to try but the light bubbly body and awkward spice texture didn't work for me."
"Pours a slightly hazy orange with a 1 inch foamy off-white head that settles to a film on the top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of pumpkin pie spices, some malty aromas, and a slight sour scent. I am also getting some apple juice smells. Taste is extremely strong on the spices with some slight malt and pumpkin flavors. The spice level is very bitter and is too much for me. This pretty much ruins the beer in my opinion. The beer is also super carbonated, so this is like drinking a glass of soda water with spices dumped in it. Overall, this is a pretty bad beer that is just way overdone with the bitter spices."
"O - not that good for a pumpkin ale. But still a fall taste to it"
"O - Almost a perfect beer for me. The pumpkin and the cinammon are perfectely outstanding. The smell catchs your attention. Without question, I would get it again!"
"O: Overall, I will not say I am a fan of this style of beer, but I am a fan of DFH’s Punkin Ale, and The Bruery’s Autumn Maple. So I thought I would venture outside my norm. I won’t say I was disappointed with this beer, but definitely did not stand out or wow me. I would however pick up some more and save it for Thanksgiving, and Christmas Eve and Day."
"overall: eh, not that impressed. syke! i'm blown away! clearly twitterpated. i was looking for big smooth pumpkin, and this one delivers. go shipyard, go!"
"O: This is a really good pumpkin ale and at 9% it certainly packs a punch. I really enjoyed this beer and would enjoy more as the weather cools."
"A very tasty spiced beer--more of a nutmeg and cinnamon beer than a true pumpkin beer."
"Overall, I was a bit dissapointed maybe this was a different style than I was normally used to with a pumkin beer but I'll try another and see if it grows on me."
"I'm a pumpkin freak so this beer has been a seasonal favorite of mine for years. This year, though, I felt it really hit the mark. There was just enough pumpkin and spices to remind me of autumn, but without being too sweet or over spiced. I'll probably pick up a few more bottles of this pumpkin gem."
"O- Pumpkin beers rock, especially imperial ones like this."
"A fun b"
"The pumpkin does make an appearance on the finish and the mouthfeel is gorgeous. I would've rated this beer higher had there been a lil less spice and a lil more pumpkin. On the whole a very enjoyable offering from Shipyard, though."
"Tastes like a pumpkin dessert with way too much cinnamon and spices. Nice aroma but flavored too strongly."
"O: this pumpkin ale features everything you would expect in the style. My only complaint is that it is a little on the sweet/boozy side."
"I went with a more delicate pour than usual as I was unsure as to the amount of lees present. I got a finger of tawny head that fell pretty quickly. Color was a coppery orangish-amber with NE-quality clarity and lots of CO2 bubbles. BUPGOO! Nose had taken on a clove-tobacco quality in the interim and I began to debate donning a black beret for the occasion. Mouthfeel was thick and full on the tongue and combined with the clove/nutmeg/allspice flavors, it was like drinking liquid pumpkin pie! I must remember to get some more this year. I was worried that it had gone over like many of the pumpkin ales in my cellar, but this was phenomenal! Finish was (literally) breathtaking with regard to its spiciness. I may carve a pumpkin tonight in this beer's honor, providing I can find such a gourd. Hauntingly ghoulicious. Say, is that a black cat at my back door? Here, kitty, kitty ..."
"A far better beer than their normal pumpkin ale. This beer has a good color of deep amber with a solid white looking head on it. The smell is much spicier than the regular pumpkin brew. The taste has some complexity to it with some sweet vanilla and autumn spices upfront that fade into a mild pumpkin flavor in the end. The mouthfeel is probably twice as heavy as the other brew leaving a good coating in the mouth. Overall, I'd say don't even waste your time with Shipyards other Pumpkin beer, Just ask for this one or keep your eyes peeled for it. You'll be far more impressed with this one, it's almost hard to believe that they're from the same company."
"Mouthful/D/O- coats your mouth well, the pumpkin ale flavor lingers and dissipates just in time for you to want to take another sip. Leaving this beer fairly drinkable and tade bit dangerous for being a high ABV at 9%. Really though thanksgiving and Halloween isn’t that what you want!? Anyways great stuff, truly the only Pumpkin beer I've ever been impressed by. Go out and buy it today if you can."
"Poured a very clear amber/Orange with a bubbly off-white Head, has some Bubbles streaming from the bottom of the glass. Some light lacing, aromas of the actual pumpkin with some nutmeg and other spices. I really liked this Pumpkin Ale, reminded me of Southern Tiers Pumking Imperial Pumpkin Ale. I would say top 3 or 4 favorite pumpkin Ales. This also had about 9 months on it, so The 9% helped keep it preserved perfectly."
"Let's see how it ages..."
"More proof that pumpkin ales need to be massive, or at least that is what I prefer. Good drinking for the holiday or I would even think it is possible to cellar a bottle and perhaps cook with it as well."
"Full bodied, dark-dark amber, a bit hazy. While it's full bodied - it does not taste like it's a 9% beer...very easy drinking."
"Poured out the lightest of the three with a hazy orange tinted amber color and a nice soft off white head that reached a height of around an inch or so before it settled down with some nice lacing on the side that really just surprised me with how well it hung in there to be honest. Really quite the solid look. Nice aroma of pumpkin spice, hints of cinnamon and nutmeg, all the usual characters here with a touch of a west coast hop flair to it, especially as it warms. Crisp and super clean flavor here. Starts with a touch of a light malt note and then swoops in with a big hit of cinnamon and nutmeg which dries out the palate very nicely. Very even consistency I have to admit as it comes together very nice. Light drying of palate leaves a touch of light spice and the lightest hint of hops on the back of the tongue."
"Taste is light caramelized pumpkin up front with raisiny grain maltiness, some pumpkin-pie spice, raisiny alcoholic spiciness, light spicy bitterness – faintly herbal. It has some good yeasty toasted grain in the finish and aftertaste. Overall, this is pretty good and one of the better pumpkin beers."
"D - Very drinkable, goes down easy. Although its 9.0% does sneak up on you. I would track it down again when it comes time for the pumpkin brews."
"O: Not the best pumpkin beer, though I do welcome it at this time of year. Near the end of my glass, it's tougher to finish than at the beginning, but I'm still enjoying it. Certainly worth a try, whether it's the season for pumpkin beers or simply to serve as a reminder of that great time of year."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability - While the spices can be overwhelming at times; I feel as if they are very well balanced for the most part. I get a sort of sickening spice taste that quickly smooths out to a delicious onslaught of pumpkin and gourds. Overall a little too sweet for my tastes."
"D - Very drinkable pumpkin ale. Not over the top in the spice department, well balanced. Very enjoyable brew to have again, I would seek this brew out again and also recommend this brew if you are into Pumpkin brews"
"Poured a medium copper/orange with a large creamy off white head that was fully lasting and had excellent lacing. The aroma was mild of caramel malts and a sweet doughy yeast with notes of brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg and pumpkin. It tasted sweet with a slight alcohol flavor at first then matured to a sweet and creamy flavor with strong hints of nutmeg, pumpkin and cinnamon with a slight alcohol aftertaste that stayed wit you a nice long while. Mouthfeel was light to medium in body and creamy in texture with a flat carbonation. Overall a nice tasting pumpkin ale."
"A light yellow copper color, clear with a modest white fuzz on top and good lacing. The aroma is kind of different with cotton candy sweetness, berry overtones with honey and mild pumpkin. The flavor offers less sweetness and more of a solid pumpkin and honey mix. Lot's of honey actually. It's medium bodied with fair carbonation with a tingly but vaguely syrupy feel. It's got a spicey nearly dry edge to it. Modest drinkability because of the feel. It's an odd bird and seems somewhat atypical of most. But well worth a try if you like the style at all."
"The mouthfeel has a good mic of carbonation and seems a bit medium bodied. So the drinkability is a good but can be bad at 9%! It goes down easy, try sipping it though or you will go threw these quickly since I feel it is a medium bodied and easy drinking."
"I honestly hope that I got a bad bottle. As I am currently converting my old notes into BA reviews, I am having flashbacks of drinking this beer. I remember it vividly because it was so poor. This is the worst pumpkin ale I have ever had, but on the bright side it created a benchmark that I can compare to other beers of the style."
"Thr beer is malt and smooth to start, spices become apparent as the carbonation presents and finishes its smooth and very flavored but heavy but for a pumpkin beer one of the best"
"(Taken in part from my blog at realbeer.wordpress.com)"
"Not a bad pumpkin ale, but it's not one of my favorites, either. Seek out other Pumpkin ales because of the high $$$ point of this beer and the quantity/quality of other offerings on the market."
"Will not be seeking out again next season unless Shipyard steps it up."
"Yeah, pleasant, could be better with a clearer palate. A bit sweet and a bit sour. Needs more bitter maybe."
"M/D: Medium bodied, maybe a little thin, carbonation a touch high. Drinkability is good. A pretty solid beer."
"This is a really great pumpkin ale. It really conveys to me all the characters I feel should be there - the pie spice, the burnt sugar sweetness, even the slightly dry pastry character. I feel like this is the pumpkin ale which sums up the style for me. It's very good indeed. I'm not sure I've had a better example. Well recommended."
"D - Terrible. This was actually my 1st all-out drainpour, and the girlfriend agreed. Shipyard needs to stop making Pumpkin Beers, and this is from someone who usually loves the style. Avoid!"
"This nice Smashed Pumpkin makes me wish I had a slice of my favorite carrot cake (Lloyd's Carrot Cake, 6097 Broadway, Bronx NY!!!) to accompany the beer."
"Overall- not bad. Not my favorite pumpkin beer by any stretch of the imagination, and frankly not all that original or memorable. But solid nonetheless and overall a pleasing experience. I've drank my fair share of pumpkinhead (and then some...my buddies love it, so it's often the best option around) so I came into this with fairly low expectations, so it certainly exceeded this low bar. Don't seek this out, but at ~$7/bomber, it fits the bill for this Monday night showdown."
"D: This beer may be Fall's biggest surprise: a pumpkin ale that presents appealing sensory qualities without really seeming like a compromised effort. Although the flavors found here don't measure up to the outstanding aroma, they are by no means off-putting. Make no mistake, spices do define the taste of this beer, but they do not cross the line to the point of ruining it. Considering Shipyard's predictably English stylistic tendencies, they are found here to be a good, if somewhat understated, match with a style whose value is oftentimes questionable. Perhaps most remarkable is the deftness with which the robust alcohol content is completely hidden. In the end, Shipyard's Smashed Pumpkin is versatile and to be taken seriously; serve with savory, sweet, or solo."
"Pours a slightly hazy pumpkin orange color with a thick slightly off white head which resides to a little lace. The aroma is of cinnamon and nutmeg along with some other spices. The taste is of a caramel malt backbone with a hint of pumpkin, there is more spice flavors of cinnamon and nutmeg than anything else. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated. The drinkability is a little above average, it is an easy drink, but it isn't as flavorful as other pumpkin beers. It's solid but not near the best in class."
"D: it drank pretty good and have to say that it is a decent pumpkin beer. This was the last beer to cap things off on pumpkin trickin treatin day."
"As a Fall seasonal, this works well with its combination of pumpkin with elements of an Oktoberfest Marzen. Not my favorite pumpkin beer (I think mixing this with a stout or porter would be much more pleasing), and a little on the sweet side, but lacks the vegetal deficits many of the less saccharine examples often exhibit."
"Drinkability: this beer went down fairly quickly depsite the higher alcohol levels. Overall a tasty beer from Shipyard."
"Lighter to medium body, with a good amount of soft carbonation. Some alcohol is felt, but not overwhelming. Very nice balance of spices and sweetness. Very nice."
"Not a bad pumpkin beer, but probably not my favorite. I'll probably use the rest of my bomber to make an orange and black with some Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout."
"D: Poor, think I'm gonna dump this."
"Beer is silky creamy butterscotchy with a horrible pumpkin sour bitterness at the back end. Its like eating the skin off the pumpkin after its dipped in fake butter. Never again."
"This is one exceptional Imperial Pumpkin. Brilliantly clear light copper with a decent white head and lacing. A bit of carbonation visible. Smell is gorgeous. Big, sweet bready malt and pumpkin pie. Nutmeg and vanilla flow beautifully through the aroma. A spiciness that I can't quite describe. A light floral hops and a trace of alcohol. Taste is just short of perfect in my book. This is like drinking a pumpkin pie with a graham cracker crust. Big pumpkin front and deep malt backbone combine to make a smooth, mildly sweet introduction. Nice vanilla component. Finish leaves touches of graham and and mellow earthy hops. Some hearty bread as the main player. Very British. Feel is gently crisp and mildly carbonated. This drinks like a session ale so be careful. My fave so far in the world of Big Pumps."
"Anyway, this had the potential to be a good beer, but the amount of spice completely ruined the flavor and aroma. Looking back at other reviews, it appears it was better last year, but this batch of Smashed Pumpkin will join the hall of fame as one of about 5 beers that conquered me and forced a pour-out."
"EDIT: Matt's review makes it clear that at least one more at the tasting found this to be thoroughly disgusting."
"D- The dryness makes this one a little tough to get used to but it tastes so damn good I need more."
"Overall I like the beer in comparison to other pumpkin ales, certainly better than Shipyard's Pumpkinhead which I am not impressed with."
"D: This beer honestly didn't do much for me. The boozy character overshadowed the pumpkin and left the beer feeling off kilter. An OK, but no exceptional pumpkin beer."
"Taste is laid back as well. Right away, you get a warm and sweet pumpkin flavor. The spices dull away the sweetness, and hide the 9% fairly well. Nice rounded flavor."
"I'm not a huge fan of most pumpkin beers, but this one has a nice balance. I can honestly say I enjoyed it and would look for it again."
"Drinkability- Tastes great, The drinkability is perfect for what it is. Would not want more than a 22 oz. bomber in one session. Good after dinner beer. Skip the dessert on Sunday nite and kick back with a Smashed Pumpkin!"
"Pours a beautiful amber/copperish color. The smell smells of sweetness. It tastes on the sweeter side. Less spicy than many pumpkin ales and also not as thin, but sweeter and with a decidedly more pumpkin taste. The mouthfeel is somewhat syrupy. For a 9% beer that is somewhat thin there is not the alcohol taste I would expect. The alcohol is well hidden under the sweetness and syrupiness. As a style, pumpkin beers often disappoint me but this one is a solid one."
"Drinkability - A very different (perhaps by mistake?) but tasty pumpkin beer. There is a most definite infected quality to this pumpkin beer but by God it works. The quirky barnyard funk makes the spices and pumpkin flavor absolutely enticing. This is the most interesting, tasty, and easy to drink pumpkin beer I have come across. I feel this is an anomaly but hell if it will stop me from picking up another. Very enjoyable."
"A mediocre pumpkin ale in my opinion. The most impressive thing about it is how well this thin brew covered the 9% ABV. I won't go out of my way to find it again, certainly glad I didn't pay the premium price for a bottle."
"Drinks: like pumpkin ale light. Smashed Pumpkin has a lot of flavor smashed in there, but a light body and crisp, lager-like finish make it easy-drinking. Loved the aroma, liked the flavor --a nice example of a pumpkin ale."
"Mouthfeel is medium-full with a creamy amount of carbonation."
"This has made me open to taste a few more pumpkin brews. And it's certainly not the worst beer I've had. But I'm not purchasing it of my own free will."
"overall: A decent pumpkin beer but nothing great here its kind of just above average."
"Drinkability: A pretty good beer, and definitely a sipper. However, this one lacks enough balance to make it great."
"This beer is a bit hot and I enjoy the extra alcohol to warm me up. Being that is is fairly carbonated, it goes down quite smooth. This has to be the best pumpkin beer I've had yet, although I probably wouldn't buy again because I realize this style just isn't for me."
"Shipyard is a very good brewery, and Pugsley, if you read this, knock it off with the Pumpkinhead (which is so subtle that while not horrible, it is simply a noncontender). This is a world class pumpkin ale that is the stalking horse for the style."
"D- This beer was fantastic! Much more so than when it is fresh. The higher ABV limits this beer but still I would have no problem drinking 22oz's by myself. After that though I would move onto something else."
"A crystal clear orange brew with fine carbonation. Lovely tiny bubbles! Aroma is lightly sweet, pumpkin and spice. Flavors are incredibly well balanced. All of the elements dance so well together. Sweet pumpkin and malts, spices and hops. Nothing is overdone. Very, very smooth and drinkable. 9%? who knew! Fantastic well made stuff!"
"22 ounce bottle from 2010. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours an orange/amber color with about a half inch off-white head that went away quickly. Not much lacing at all. Aroma is mostly spicy, the brew smells like nutmeg, cloves, pumpkin and cinnamon. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's a little bit of booze noticable in the flavor. I think the aroma is better than the taste, as the pumpkin spice flavors aren't quite as strong compared to the strength of the spices in the aroma. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit slick with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is decent enough, it's not hard to drink at all. Not a bad pumpkin ale, but it's not one of my favorites, either. I'd try this again in the future."
"All in all, this is a very good pumpkin brew. To me this is second to ST Pumpking and neck and neck with Weyerbacher Imperial Pumpkin. Worth trying at least once, but hunt Pumpking first."
"It's a good looking beer with a transparent orange-amber color and a creamy off-white head. Lots of sweet pumpkin pie spice in the aroma. The pumpkin flavor shows up in a supporting role. It's a bit too sugary, but it kind of works with the spice. The beer tastes fairly sweet, but there's lots of spice here as well. It reminds me of an English Barleywine mixed with pumpkin pie. The booze is relatively light and just provides warmth. It's a big, smooth beer. Gets better as it warms. Very full mouthfeel, particularly for the style. I'm not always a big fan of pumpkin ales or Shipyard, but this is a very nice beer. Good to drink slowly."
"D- Fairly high. A good imperial pumpkin beer. I'll buy a few more of these before the season is out."
"Thanks for sharing, Jason. Light orange,no head, smooth, boozy, understated pumpkin. Rich nutmeg mostly. Smells like the pumpkin spice. A sipper.Understated carbonation. Much of a sweet spice delivery, not as drinkable as I would like. A different take."
"Drinkability: A really nice pumpkin ale overall with great, sweet and robust flavors; may sit a bit heavy though and the 9% ABV would catch up to you after a while."
"Pours a clear, copper color with a dense egg-shell colored head that looks like you can rest a quarter on. The head settles into a nice puffy cap. The aroma is a bit grainy, some light metallic notes and light pumpkin spice. The taste is of pale malt with some pumpkin spice; cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg. There is a bit of a fruitiness to this beer. The alcohol is very present and overwhelms this beer. The malt body is too light for this type of booze level. The spice flavor is light but appropriate. The body is light with very fizzy carbonation, drinks crisp. There is significant belly burn from the ABV. The flavor is not too bad; its not overpowering which is good but the ABV is just not needed. Take about 3-4% off and you have a drinkable pumpkin ale."
"Even though I'm not a big fan of pumpkin brews, this one definitely stands out amongst the others I've tried. Just a well-made beer."
"Pours a Halloween dark orange with spirits floating above the body. The aroma is like the smell of the people under the stairs in the last house on the left. Actually a solid tasting full bodied pumpkin ale here. I didn't expect much having had the sugary artificial shipyard pumpkin. The smashed pumpkin is a solid pumpkin offering I would pick up again. Very nice feel to it and went down very smoothly. Glided down my taste buds like a witch on her broom."
"Drinkability: It's pretty good. Not great, mind you, and, unlike """It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown," I doubt I'll make the needed effort to catch it every year."
"D - I guess if your a fan of pumpkin head you'll like this? Then again, probably not. Unlike pumpkinhead, which tends to be crisp and refreshing, this is the opposite. Sorry to say, this stuff is a drain pour for me."
"From the 22 fl. oz. 2010 batch bottle. Sampled on Sept. 13, 2010. The pour is orange with a bit of copper mixed in and a thin white head and limited lacing. Beautifully clear. The pumpkin and spiced aromas are solid with almost nothing in the way of alcohol considering it is a 9% ABV beer. The taste is also a generous dose of pumpkin, spices, clove, and a mildly hopped bitterness. A nice one to have during the season."
"D: For the amount of alcohol by volume, this brew is surprisingly drinkable. I could definitely have another after this one."
"D - Well yes it is quite good and if it's still around in October I may fancy another bomber to see if the bitterness will round out a bit leaving sweet malt. It was good fresh though so no complaints."
"Overall, it's a tasty beer, but one is enough. I now know what I'm bringing to Thanksgiving dinner."
"drinkability is good - much better brew then their regular pumpkin ale and up there with the best"
"D: i think this would be a good beer for someone who is just starting with pumpkin brews. you can taste the pumpkin but still want to throw back quite a few of these. they go down easy!"
"D: Gotta give it big drinkability points. You could give this to any beer novice and they would get quickly hammered. However, there are still enough layers of flavors here to be interesting, and it ultimately tastes like beer."
"D - Great. I had this before (maybe November) and I was disappointed. Perhaps I was in a sour mood then, but I think that this aged really well. I would have again."
"D: Definitely not my favorite pumpkin beer. Way too much cinnamon for me. This is my real problem with pumpkin ales. Most brewers go over the top with spices. At least this isn't a syrupy mess like some. I'll pass if I see this again. So far Pumking reigns supreme in the pumpkin ale category for me."
"D-another one of my favorite pumpkin beers, I could easily have two of these"
"Notes: This is a very well done Pumpkin beer with wonderful complexity, decent balance and texture. This is much better then there other pumpkin beer by far, in fact this one is going high up on my favorite list."
"Drinkability: I could have easily had more of this beer, and will likely make an attempt to find it in stores during the fall, it was well worth it."
"Drinkability- I thought it was pretty good. It is very festive for the Fall season."
"Light on the finish; there is a hint of cinnamon and pepper."
"in the final analysis i can see where some would be turned off by this, but it definitely works for me. wouldn't have more than one or two at a sitting though. [edit: one or two glasses, not bombers :)] that said, nice take on the style."
"Have this one with some turkey and dressing when you are celebrating Thanksgiving with family and friends. Cheers."
"Mouthfeel is creamy and medium bodied. The carb is light but appropriate. Finish has just a touch of alcohol and lingering spice/bitterness/stickiness. This is a decently drinkable pumpkin beer. It's not going to change anyone's life, and beers like Southern Tier Pumking are way better IMO. This is nice and enjoyable - just a touch too strong. I would try again if it was available fresh closer to Halloween and Thanksgiving, but I like these spiced/herbed beers as fresh as possible and this can't be savored in that condition at the right time of the year."
"D - TBD. I am going to try this one at least one more time. Maybe I got a bad one. I hope I got a bad one for their sake. I like shipyard beers too."
"Drinkability - very drinkable, nice and easy and goes down very smooth"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation, a bit of warmth but pretty smooth. Pretty interesting take but not my style. Thanks Russ!"
"D - unique take on the style, very drinkable, very subtle & well balanced"
"Pours a very nice clean/clear copper color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger creamy off-white head, with some nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some cinnamon, and nutmeg. The taste is sweet, malty, nice touch of cinnamon/nutmeg notes. Medium body. Drinkable, enjoying this one this afternoon."
"Shipyard has a very distinctive yeast flavoring to all of their beers. This one is no exception. Very nice light copper color with good clarity. Not much to the head and it disappears without a trace pretty quickly. Smell is mostly of spices, yeast and alcohol. Not a bad nose, but the pumpkin seasoning seems to be drowned out by the other spices and only plays a minor assistant role. The flavor is just as disappointing and the alcohol becomes a stronger factor here. Don't get me wrong it isn't a bad taste, but it's just lacking that pumpkin feel to it. This medium to heavy bodied beer leaves it's mark in your mouth on the way to your throat, but is not an awful thing to behold."
"I am disappointed with this beer. Shipyard has made some very decent beers, adn the Pugsley's Barley Wine was truly enjoyable. Sadly, I have to gice this beer a lower grade than I want."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a dark golden amber with a thin 1 finger head. Head was foamy but settled down to a thin layer and didn't cling at all. Aroma was slightly spicy, trace amount of nutmeg no real strong pumpkin aroma, pie or otherwise. Pumpkin was more present in the flavor. Like a thin pumpkin pie, lightly spiced, slightly creamy. Small amounts of sweetness. Felt good in the mouth, coated well, nicely carbonated. Reasonable to drink, didn't do a good job of hiding the ABV however."
"D: This is really a mixed bag, there are good parts and bad parts. This would make a good cool weather warmer, makes you feel good inside, but I'd have someone to split the bottle with."
"Shipyard Smashed Pumpkin didn't quite win me over, but I'm still not sorry about spending $8.99 on the bomber. My advice to any New Englanders looking for good gourd beer is to spend that money on a sixer of the excellent Smuttynose Pumpkin Ale instead."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Unfortunately at this point nothing can save this beer from the gallows, but at least the texture isn't terrible. It rises to a prickly, aggressive carbonation level and then subsides to a reasonably smooth finish. I'm not sure if this year's offering was majorly lacking in balance and overall structure, but I really hope for the brewery's sake that this recipe gets some serious attention and retooling."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Very interesting carbonation but still very easy to drink. Might be a little sweet for some people but I enjoyed it."
"Drinkability: I think is my first Shipyard beer I've reviewed, and though I want to try more, especially in this series, this isn't one I was thrilled about, the $8 price tag adding my dismay a bit. I wonder how this would work to cook with, because I could see it doing good things. Don't get me wrong, I'm finishing the bomber, but yes, way too """big""" for everyone to balance, too much alcohol, and not enough balance."
"poured a light brown / caramel into a tulip glass. Nutmeg was prevelent with other spices in the background. Pumpkin comes through in the middle with a smooth texture and a clean finish. A medium bodied pumpkin ale, not my favorite but well worth mention."
"F: Pretty spicey and hot. A slight burn and sting from alcohol and spices. The warmth of the alcohol is nice, and it helps through the chili windy autumn. A little lingering syrupy sweetness seems to stick around for a bit. The spice taste fades very quickly. Then it dries right off, quite a bit. It's almost pulling the water out of my tongue pores."
"D: The alcohol hinders things a bit drinkability-wise. A slow sipper best served in a chalice while splitting a bomber with a friend. Not terribly exciting."
"The serving size is just about right for this ale as the alcohol heat threatens to take over. Spices are not overdone though and it makes for a smooth drinking experience. The bottle suggests adding some stout to make a winter warmer and that seems like a good idea to add some body to this tasty brew."
"22oz. bottle: This one pours a crystal clear, slightly orange color. There is a small white head on it that drops away very quickly. The aroma is pumpkin pie spice, but not overpoweringly so. A hint of caramel malt in the background. Taste is a mostly of the pie spices, with some caramel malt sweetness in the background. Overall taste is just a bit sweet. Pretty smooth, and the alcohol is not evident at all. A very good seasonal!"
"D: Easy to drink. Could definitely see myself going through a couple of these tonight. Problem is the high price tag..."
"I could probably drink more of this than Pumpkinhead, unfortunately not at the price they're selling it for."
"O- its not bad, it just not balanced its all """natural flavors""" and little beer"
"drinkability: pretty good"
"Overall, pretty disappointing. For $11 I expected much more. Too sweet and spicy and not enough squash taste, and what pumpkin flavor is there tastes artificial. Worth a try but not worth going through any trouble for. For a great imperial pumpkin ale Southern Tier Pumking remains the king, none of the other three I have tried have even come close. The Weyerbacher was also very good but nothing seems to attempt what Southern Tier is doing by infusing a truly unique pie crust taste with plenty of real squash flavor. I was going to save this for the Phish concert in Syracuse in a few weeks but thankfully I decided to crack it. I'll be tailgating with Pumking instead :)"
"The is a very drinkable pumpkin ale and I have to say this one ranks among my favorites so far and the best beer Shipyard Brews (in my opinion). I think it deserves a higher rating than what is here and I'm not a huge pumpkin ale fan. There's another pumpkin ale out there that's really bready that everyone loves so much, I have to be in the right mood for it. With this one, this is one I could enjoy time and time again. The beer is so drinkable that you really have to watch the intake - pour in a snifter and pace yourself because this is one that will really sneak up on you after a bottle."
"The beer pours a dark amber color with a thick frothy white head thadecently fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a nice light pumpkin scent along with nutmeg and some Munich malt sweetness. The taste is decent as well. It has a really nice pumpkin character to it and is well spiced. It's a bit syrupy which takes away from the drinkability. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a pretty good beer. I like the fact that Shipyard is making some big beer finally. This one's not bad."
"D - I've had many many Pumpkin Ales and consider myself to quite knowledgeable in this style. While this particular offering is beautifully packaged, and although it sits head and tails above the regular (terrible) Shipyard Pumpkinhead Ale, it is still only mediocre at best -- failing to capture the essence of the mildly-flavored pumpkin as the main ingredient and focal point, and instead bombing the palate with a heavy handed use of the usual bevvy of spices and a whole bunch of alcohol. No disrespect to Adam Pugsley and his craft, but in the chess-game of Imperial Pumpkin Ales, this one is merely a subjugate pawn to Weyerbacher's Imperial Pumpkin King."
"Mouth: Wow. Big full flavor, warm, robust, bitter finish that rounds out the whole thing. Spices, squash. The mouthfeel is sparkling and light, a surprising body for a 9% beer. Excellent pumpkin beer."
"Bomber poured into a 22oz. glass. Sharp clarity, copper orange sunset. Foam is creamy and inviting, but doesn't last forever. The standard """pumpkin beer aroma""" of real pumpkin. Spice is fairly dominant in this, the bottle says nutmeg, but it tastes like cinnamon, without the burn. A bit dry from the moderate spice, some bready qualities come out from the pale malt and wheat. Pumpkin flavor is there in spades. It's pretty drinkable, but I seem to have slowed down with it (maybe that's the 9%). Still, it has a nice dry bitterness that contrasts well with some of the sweeter examples out there."
"Very """smashing""" solid stuff."
"Pumking is still the king, but this is a nice effort."
"Happy Halloween!"
"Overall, a very impressive Pumpkin Ale. Heavy on the spice, with the pumpkin as an afterthought, this is still one of the best new beers I have seen this fall season. Well worth seeking out."
"D - Really good overall. Think I would have liked some more bitterness though."
"Mouthfeel is thick, a little on the creamy side. Hides the booze well. In all, ignore the look and smell and just start drinking. Much improved on Pumpkinhead."
"Notes: To be fair it is really not a bad pumpkin beer,but it lacks the intensity of full,pumpkin flavor.I still think it was a great try at coming close to the """King"""."
"I bought this bottle at Blacklick Liquor in Blacklick, OH (near Columbus)."
"Pours a two finger cream head that fades quickly to a ring leaving no lace. Crystal clear amber color. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Light pumpkin nose. Flavor is almost pumpkin pie, the hops are balancing the sweetness. $8.99 for a 22oz bottle from Glen Beverage Glen, NH."
"D: Pumpkin head is made for the girls, this one is for the men. Nice bold flavors with the alcohol present. Tasty, spicy, bready, good."
"I am shocked this beer does not score higher, as this is easily my favorite pumpkin beer of the year. It looks like trying this on-tap may be the way to go."
"22 oz. bottle. Pours a clear, red-orange color with a decent frothy off-white head, fair lacing. Aroma is pumpkin, nutmeg, vanilla, some caramel malts, very sweet. Flavor is sweet, spicy, more pumpkin and vanilla and a decent amount of bitterness. Medium body, fairly bitter finish that sticks around for a while. Pretty good pumpkin ale, well balanced and flavorful."
"On a related note, I would guess that this beer might do well paired with Tabak Maz or another Indian dish with lots of cardamom."
" Samhein is easily my favorite holiday."
"D: just to rich in pumpkin flavor and spices to go down easily. This was rather disappointing of a brew. But then again, a pumpkin ale doesn't have much buisness being imperialized, and this is a good example as to why."
"I can see how some people wouldn't like this. They'd think it wasn't beery enough or maybe they just don't like pumpkin and spice. But if you're into pumpkin deserts--not the cheap Sarah Lee pies, either, but the *real*, burny, complex stuff--then you're probably going to like this beer."
"On a better note, I'm feeling the 9.0% now and My Antonio is starting in 25 mins!"
"Compared to standouts Pumpking and Punkin', not as complex and well-rounded, but a good effort. nonetheless."
"This is definitely a beer that I'd only be able to have once a year, but I'll absolutely be looking for this on the shelves every year."
"Oh, and it's kind of a dull orange color with a surprisingly big head, and it smells like pumpkin."
"22oz bomber purchased at Whole Foods in Portland, Maine. Pours a golden amber-red body with a good half inch of short-lived off-white head. Smells spice (cinnamon and allspice come to mind) with a fair bit of nut, pumpkin, and a slight booziness. Tastes very spicy, with a woody cinnamon and a fair bit of clove. A fairly bold suggestion of pumpkin in this also, with a slight vegetal quality. Just slightly boozy with sharp spice notes. Definitely a sipper, though it is lighter in body than anticipated with ample carbonation. Overall a very solid beer - on par with any other imperial pumpkin and many regular pumpkin beers I've had. Good stuff."
"Taste: Immediate rush of potent spices into a decadent caramel sweetness, finishing out with a lightly sour/bitter finish. Has a continual hoppy bitterness that plays with the spritzy carbonation. There's a pleasurably thick mouthfeel which adds more contrast. Flavor-wise there's some seasonal spices but the pumpkin was only a trace in the background. Caramel sweetness dominates."
"The first thing I noticed and then celebrated was that the usual Shipyard bast of ringwood yeast taste was no where to be found, thank you Lord, thank you Jesus. I remember it tasting good--complex enough yet refreshing and really working to discern any pumpkin flavor. They better have some left!"
"The carbonation is great for the style, the beer is very drinkable given the 9% abv, the only thing that hinders the drinkability is the extreme cinnamon finish. This is a beer that I am happy I tried once, but I won't rush back to it."
"Even mouthfeel, semi-slick, finishes bubbly and warm. Tasty beer, very drinkable."
"This basically tastes like the regular Pumpkinhead Ale but with 9% ABV. There seems to be more spiciness and sweetness to it that really is intolerable. There is little carbonation so the mouthfeel is more smooth and syrupy. It was nasty. I'm pissed I spent $9 and I still got a cheap beer. If I wanted to drink something like this, I would sprinkle nutmeg & cinnamon in a bottle of pancake syrup and drink that...except I wouldn't get the buzz."
"D- pumpkin beers usually aren't for me (Shipyard Pumpkin head for example) but this one was milder on the pie taste and stronger with the alcohol. Worth a try but wont spend my $9 for another one."
"Tastes like something you would use to remove paint. I love Pumpkin Ales (good ones..Dogfish, Weyerbacher, Souther Tier) and this is definitely not a good example of one in my opinion. Did have a nice color though. Looks can be deceiving I suppose!"
"As pumpkin ales go, this may be the best I've had. Pours a very dark auburn with a creamy 1 cm off-white head that lasts. Okay lacing. Rich, spicy pumpkin pie aroma. Lots of nutmeg and cinnamon with caramel malt. Smooth, slick mouthfeel with just enough carbonation to keep it lively. Delicious pumpkin and spice taste. Like a blend of pumpkin pie and zucchini bread. Strong malts without the syrpuy mouthfeel. Slightly hoppy to give it some bite and earthiness. Loved it."
"D= pretty decent pumpkin beer. Less pumpkiny than most which I prefer. I find that a lot of these beers are trying to push the limits too much at times. Really delicious."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, strong kick, good representation of style, this is a nice stronger pumpkin beer that is worth drinking for a little while if you're in the mood for the style."
"Overall, better than I was expecting considering the Pumpkinhead Ale is my least favorite pumpkin brew. Instead of overwhelming spice, the pumpkin does take center stage. The amped up ABV seems rather unnecessary though. Either way, a unique and enjoyable brew for hte most part."
"Not for everyone but some may actually find it a sipping beer for after dinner."
"This beer pours a clear burnt orange color. A thin off white film coats the top of the glass, but disappears rapidly. No lacing to speak of on this beer. Nose is of pumpkin - not your typical spiced pumpkin, or pumpkin pie that is prevelant in most pumpkin beers. This is straight up pumpkin, some malt, and rather boozy. Taste is sharply sweet up front, can't quite place the sweetness, middle is filled out with pumpkin and the finish is sharp booziness. Actually the alcohol is the most dominant flavor in the entire beer from start to finish. Lighter side of medium bodied, clean on the tongue but a sharp boozy taste to it. This was nice to try, and with a lower alochol content, may have been far more enjoyable."
"Very nicely done and kind of like the big brother to Pumpkinhead. It just feels deceptively drinkable and delicious. I'm usually not a fan of half-hearted pumpkin ales but this stands out in a good way. Pick it up!"
"Overall, for my first pumpkin ale, I'm pretty impressed. I have nothing to base it on and nothing to compare it to, but I did enjoy this beer."
"Poured light golden, leaving a 3 finger head, slowly evaporating to light lacing.Nose naked of pumpkin/spices, taste boring and without flavour, and a weird describable aftertaste. Probably near the bottom of this years pumpkin/spice brews. Did I say it also tasted flat?"
"I had an imperial pumpkin last fall at Cambridge Brewing Company, and really enjoyed it. This beer doesn't come close. In a snifter the beer was a copper color with a tiny off-white head. Mostly spice aroma, maybe a little pumpkin. The taste was all nutmeg, some cinnamon, and no pumpkin. It was a bit on the hot side. The alcohol got in the way of this beer, and it was far too spicy with not enough pumpkin."
"Comes in a bomber with a fancy gold wrapper around the neck, and pours a dark reddish orange with a head that quickly fades. The smell is spicy and sweet. Rhe taste is way spicey, I think I taste peppermint or cinamon, unfortunaley not so much the pumpkin spice I was hoping for. The sweet spice is so overpowering on this one that I think it could be an X-mas beer rather than a fall pumpkin."
"I got to have one of the first pours of this once The Great Lost Bear tapped their first keg of this new beer. It was served in a tulip glass. It has a orange/ruby hue and almost no head, just a skim of bubbles. As you would expect, there is a pumpkin aroma to the beer; it is like a less intense, higher quality version of Pumpkinhead. It tastes quite good. It begins with some cinnamon up front, then turns to a real pumpkin taste (unlike the Pumpkin that so many hate, this has real pumpkin flavor; detractors rejoice). It tastes like autumn. As you drink it, you can hardly notice that this is a 9% ABV beer. It's only in a lingering aftertaste that you pick up the alcohol. It has a bit of a lighter body that I thought, but I'd still classify it as medium-bodied. As for drinkability, I'd love to drink a number of these, but I think the strength of this brew would do me in. But in terms of enjoying the flavor, you could taste this beer over and over. I can't wait to crack a bottle of this open on a crisp fall day. Once again, Alan Pugsley has outdone himself with his signature series. I've had the Imperial Pumpking, and this holds up as an equal to that fine beer. This is one beer worth seeking out. Get it this season, if you can. Hopefully, the Smashed Pumpkin will become as much of a fall tradition here in southern Maine as it's less-respected cousin, Pumpkinhead."
"I wish that this was the Shipyard seasonal on tap around Portland this fall. The beer is big and exciting, and (rather than an unsessionable high alcohol content) it totally surpasses the beer it was inspired by."
"Give this one a chance I think this one is quite good."
