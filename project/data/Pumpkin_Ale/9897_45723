Poured with a big white thick head. Sour spice aroma. Is this beer supposed to be sour? Tart mildly spiced taste. Not getting much pumpkin. I think it tastes pretty good. Nice bubbly dry mouthfeel. I really like it. Hope it’s supposed to taste this way.","kkleu357","Jan 10, 2015"

3.88,0.5,4.25,3,4.25,4,4,"Sampled on tap at the Black Star coop JP tap takeover.  Pours a nice bright tangerine color with just a ski of fine white head.  Only clear at the edges.  Nose is surprisingly underwhelming with just a hint of orange.  Flavor - autumn in a glass.  Apple, squash, orange and wood.  This sour would serve as a good introduction to the style for newbie sour heads.  Finish is very clean.","mschantz","Jan 03, 2015"

Smell: lactic with straw and bread aromas, unripe nectarine, coriander, ginger-ish but maybe that's just a component of the raw pumpkin... not canned junk, so don't expect a pumpkin pie in your face... not getting any cocoa. If you're not going to give me an intense and accurate beersentation of pumpkin pie, then this is what I want. Taste brings the same. plus a pop of nutmeg-ish spice. Refreshing. Light-medium bodied, velvet feel, tart and drying finish with a little residual sugar and spice beat out by oak and grapeskin. Bottled 10/10/14. Much needed different take on the style (not that it's a new release) given the trend towards bigger, sweeter, barrel-ier.","babaracas","Dec 11, 2014"

3.85,-0.3,4,4,3.75,4,3.75,"Overall I thought this was a pretty nice beer and i thought it was a good example of a JP beer, but strictly as a Pumpkin Ale it falls shorts since the pumpkin and the spices aren't all that noticeable, but in the end I still enjoyed it.  This beer had nice drinkability, it was smooth, not too acidic, crisp, a little dry on the finish, not too filling and the taste did a nice job at holding my attention, I don't think I would have a problem drinking the whole bottle since it's not too acidic and there's isn't any aspect that was too overpowering and would wear on me.  What I like the most about this beer was mouthfeel, it was pretty good and it fit in nicely with this beer.  What I like the least about this beer was that the spices and pumpkin didn't show up more, I can get a little bit of them, but I found myself wish that both aspects were much stronger.  I would buy this beer again, it's not something I'm going to stock up on, but I'll for sure get one when it's released next year.  I would recommend this to any farmhouse ale fan, if your looking for a good Pumpkin Ale I'm pretty sure you will be disappointed.  All in all I liked this beer, but I didn't love it, I think the balance was a little off and in the end I just wanted more of those pumpkin and spice aspects.  It's not my favorite JP beer or my favorite of the style, it kind of falls in the middle in both categories.   Nice job guys, this beer wasn't bad at all, keep up the hard work.","StoutHunter","0"

4.07,5.4,4.25,4,4,4.5,4,"Put your nose in the glass and it's pretty much all brett,  though there's a spicy clove and pepper accompaniment. And once it hits your lips, that's exactly what you taste (upfront, that is): briny, barnyard funk strikes hard on the palate, providing a crisp first impression. Let that initial shock wash over you and what you find underneath is a solid allspice and butternut flavor, peppered with light ginger notes. The fall flavor isn't subtle, either; it's balanced, sure, but it's there in force. As is the funk. In fact, everything about this beer is bold: the scent, the spice, the pumpkin backbone, even the mouthfeel is big and bright. All in all, it turns out great; it's rare that you find a beer that could pair equally well with both Thanksgiving dinner and a big, stinky slice of Gorgonzola. But once you do - as you'd imagine - it's quite a memorable experience. A gorgeous beer. Cheers!","BarryMFBurton","Sep 25, 2014"

Pours lightly hazy golden orange color with a 2-3 finger dense and rocky off white head with incredible retention, that reduces to a thick cap that lasts. Dense soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of pear, green apple, lemon zest, pumpkin, clove, cinnamon, nutmeg, cocoa, floral, grass, herbal, oak, caramel, toast, light tart funk, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of pumpkin, yeast, malt, and spice notes; with good strength. Taste of pumpkin, pear, green apple, lemon zest, clove, pepper, cinnamon, nutmeg, caramel, toast, light cocoa, herbal, floral, grass, oak, light tart funk, and yeast earthiness. Slight earthy tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of pear, green apple, lemon zest, pumpkin, cinnamon, clove, pepper, nutmeg, caramel, toast, herbal, floral, light cocoa, oak, light funk, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance and complexity of of malt, pumpkin, spice, and yeast ester flavors; with a nice malt/spice balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. High carbonation and medium bodied; with a smooth, crisp, and moderately prickly mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a really excellent Belgian pumpkin ale style. All around great balance and complexity of malt, pumpkin, spice, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jan 01, 2014"

The aroma is tart, slightly sour, with some vegetal notes that develop as it warms. It’s lightly bodied, with a flavor that has slight hints of pumpkin and pumpkin spices with some light clove, nutmeg and allspice nuances that dance around the palate. Gently carbonated it doesn’t feel heavy, and it finishes dry. Initially I thought it infected slightly, but once the chill goes away and the aromas and flavors come into greater balance I realized it’s the magical mystery of yeast, barrel-aging and the brew itself coming together.

The flavors too are very cider heavy. You get plenty of apple, cinnamon, orange peels, nutmeg, some mild bitterness, and a finishing acetic sour/mild tartness. I like it a lot. It drinks lighter with plenty of carbonation and leaves almost an apple skin like flavor in the after taste. Overall this is a fine sour. It has fall written all over it, despite a lack of pumpkin influence. I say this is really an American wild ale. The spices actually worked with the apple skins to create an authentic autumn time sour beer. Well done JP!","aasher","Feb 20, 2012"

I was expecting something much more sour with this, but it was pretty mild and approachable in the taste actually. Grassy to be sure, woody, with hints of apple, peach, and lemon pith, a little barnyard funk, with a easy tartness that didn't make me flinch for even a second. Mildly spicy.

Autumn spices blended with funky sour farmhouse flavors. As the beer warms, the pumpkin spices come through very slightly. Nice bread flavors as well. Mouthfeel is very light and highly carbonated.

The nose comprises lemon zest, nutmeg, clove, light banana peel, honeydew, tart pineapple, blood orange, and a touch of honey. The taste hols notes of melon rind, lightly sour grapefruit rind, pumpkin shell, lemon zest, iceberg lettuce, clove, and a hint of white wine grape. The melon and pumpkin rinds seem to overpower everything else, destroying any hope of spicing and even o'ertaking the sour aspects, which don't even try to resist being drowned out. The body is a limpid medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a slightly oily feel. Overall, this beer just missed the mark for me.

Taste has more sour lemon, and some less notable 'autumn' flavours, but again nothing distinctly pumpkin. Spicing comes through in the finish, no cacao like the label indicates.

Well, I don't smell any pumpkin in this beer. It smells like tart apples, funk, lemon peel, and some nutmeg (which I don't notice until after the beer has been opened for a while). Taste is just like the aroma, it's mostly sour and funky until the beer has warmed up more and then the pumpkin spices are a little bit noticable. Mouthfeel/body is medium, and it has high but soft carbonation which helps makes this easy to drink. Overall I think it's a good beer, even though it's pricey at $12.99 a bottle.

Beneath the first sour, tart and funky scents lies a hint of vegtable, apple/grape scents and mild spicing. Taste breings a decent amount of pumpkin - very vegetal and dull, not sweet pumpkin pie - the tart and funk take over and the beer finnishes with touches of fruit and spice. Lighter side of medium bodied, nice carbonation (used to the bottle condioned versions having very high levels), dry.

Big aroma consisting of pumpkin, sour yeast, spices (nutmeg, cloves, coriander), with an almost mentholated funk. Largely tart flavor, minerals, grassy upfront with the pumpkin flavors subtlety lingering behind a large layer of funk. Acidic and somewhat hopppy.

The aroma has that trademark subtle oaky brett funk, rounded out by a nice mellow sweet squash notes and a mild spice. Man, this is how pumpkin beers should be. I must say I am not a fan of the glut of pumpkin beers that are around in the fall, but this is excellent. It's got just the right amount of spice, hints and wisps of clove, allspice, nutmeg, and actual pumpkin. These are accents to a nice base of a slightly sour, very refreshing, pale malt style ale. Rounded out by oak and a funky bite. Excellently dry on the palate.

I also get a light caramel note that is very nice and adds just the right amount of sweetness to balance the tart and spicy aroma. The taste is sour apple with a light hit of vinegar upfront, but it's followed a very nice bit of mild pumpkin that adds a little balance in the middle of the sip. The beer finishes dry and sour but in a very mild drinkable way. The sourness is definitely there, but not kicking you in the face like some beers do. Again, a very nice balance throughout the beer leading to a very drinkable sour beer that i keep going back to for sip after sip.

The brew was medium in body with a good amount of prickly carbonation which had a oaky, funky, spice, tart, and prickly bubbly finish.

Some balsamic vinegar acidity peeks through, and just the slightest trace of pumpkin pie spice. First impressions do not indicate that this beer contains pumpkin. The first sip of this beer may throw you for a loop, as it's surprisingly sweet for a Jolly Pumpkin beer. You're hit with a burst of intense brown sugar and toffee sweetness that disappears almost instantly, revealing a crisp, sharp funkiness that fades into light pumpkin pie spice and hints of mild pumpkin sweetness.

There actually is a nice pumpkin tone in the flavor that I wasn't expecting, as I thought this would pretty much be an exact replica of Fuego del Otono. Pumpkin comes across with a light sweetness, balanced by a light sour oak and spices. As I expected, light flavor profile, non-offensive, though not exciting to me.

It sticks around for a while to boot, and leaves a decent amount of lacing down the sides of the glass. Just a bit more and La Parcela would have garnered a 5 for looks. The nose is completely dominated by whatever critters JP put into this beer, it's straight funk with just a touch of vinegar skulking around in the background. I expected La Parcela to be much more of a wild ale than a pumpkin one at this point , but I can still find evidence of it's pumkin-ness in the flavor. A brief swirl of brown sugar leads off before the wild influence barges in to take center stage. As with the nose, it's more funky than sour, but both are definitely still present. The beer closes with a flourish from some of the traditional pumpkin ale spices, predominantly cinnamon. Mouthfeel is superb, the beer is light and nimble without even suggesting a watery characteristic. In addition the carbonation, while high, is a bit more restrained than I find in some wild ales. It's still plenty expressive, but it's not bubbly to the point of distraction. La Parcela is a great beer after a year plus of aging, but I think I might have enjoyed it a bit more a little sooner, when the pumpkin ale aspects were shining through a bit more. Still, all in all a great way to kick off Halloween this year.","axeman9182","Oct 31, 2010"

Fairly sour aroma with just a hint of pumpkin pie spice. Nice tart flavor. Very refreshing. Lighter bodied. Some dark sugar in the middle. Tart cherry in the finish. I didn't get a whole lot of pumpkin, but enjoyable none the less.","homebrewhawk","Dec 14, 2009"
4.03,4.4,4.5,4,4,4,4,"D: You can't judge a book by its' cover. When I saw the label and read the description I was 1/2 expecting a darker, heartier brew. Not that there's anything wrong with this...","GbVDave","Nov 27, 2009"

3.85,-0.3,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Mouthfeel is on the lighter side with fast moving carbonation. Easy to drink but I can't say this is my favorite JP beer. A little odd with the pumpkin and a bit astringent. Overall though a fun pumpkin beer and definitely a 180 on what most standard pumpkin beers are. Give it a try if you have the access to it.","orbitalr0x","Nov 20, 2009"
3.47,-10.1,3.5,4,3,3,4,"Not much really going on with this beer. Good acidic backbone, some fruity esters, hints of oak with wood tannins. No distinguishable fruit flavors. Light in the mouth with a spritzy finish.","mcallister","Nov 18, 2009"
4.17,8,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Mouthfeel is light bodied with a nice strong bite of carbonation.","paco1029384756","Nov 12, 2009"
4.17,8,4,4.5,4,3.5,4.5,"Aroma of wet stone, minerals, wine grapes, lemon, hay, similar to a lambic. Later on at room temp, the cinnamon/nutmeg is there, with some apple cider traces. Flavor has some earthy, squashy elements, but not a heavy pumpkin presence. Tart and dry with a drying residual spice and identifiable earthy pumpkin in the aftertaste. Upfront its more tart with some toasted malt/pumpkin seeds and spice in the middle, leaving the more complex elements to linger in the finish. Its slightly too astringent, but other than that it drinks very well. A 750 is no problem in a sitting, provided you enjoy sour ales.","emerge077","Oct 30, 2009"
4.22,9.3,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Good carbonation and wonderful sourness in the mouthfeel. I'm a huge fan/supporter of Jolly Pumpkin and this beer doesn't disappoint.","FtownThrowDown","Beers"
3.9,1,4,4,3.5,4,4.5,"D: Another good offering from Jolly Pumpkin and a good example of a farmhouse ale which they can brew blind at this point. I was expecting more spice, pumpkin and other """fall""" flavors from this one. The lower rating is based on the fact that it really doesn't seem like a pumpkin ale to me. Otherwise, it's very drinkable and the low alcohol insures that I'll finish the bottle. However, I'm moving on tonight and my adventure ends with this one. It's Moerlein OTR for the remainder of the evening.","jdflyer06","0"
4.2,8.8,4,4,4,4,5,"D: This could be a daily drinker for me. Just the thought of a wild pumpkin ale gets me going. The growler had hung around for a while which is why the carbonation was not there but I still found it very drinkable.","aerozeppl","Dec 19, 2008"

4.08,5.7,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"I was lucky enough to get some of this at Capone's. Matt mentioned that he'd had trouble with the keg, but it was pouring fine during my visit. Hazy orange with a thin, yet solid, cap of fine beige bubbles. Thick, sticky lacing. Interesting aroma, sort of expected from JP. Smells tart with a bit of strawberry and yeasty spices, a bit grassy, lemon, with light vinegar notes. Really nice flavour. Solid tartness, a bit acetic, but well balanced rather than bold. There was a bit of vegetal sweetness, squash or pumpkin flesh, with herbal bitterness in the finish. Light earthiness and funk, citrus zest, lingering spice. Medium bodied with average carbonation, a bit on the creamy side and a little slick. This was really cool, a completely different take on a pumpkin ale. Check this out if you get a chance.","DrJay","Dec 02, 2008"

3.13,-18.9,3.5,3,3,3,3.5,"Overall- Not bad but flavors are weak. Slight touch of tart tanginess make it enjoyable. Very easy to gulp down but don't seek this out.","NJpadreFan","Nov 29, 2008"
4.15,7.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"I heard many mixed reviews on this while it was on tap. Most disliked it but I found it interesting with the standout brett-filled funkiness that I was hoping for. If anyone expected to have a """pumpkin beer", they were probably let down.","weeare138","Nov 28, 2008"
3.28,-15,3.5,3,3,3.5,4,"Drinkability is good, probably couldn't drink more than one or two, but the lack of pumpkin would keep me from plopping down another $7.50 on this one.","wheelinshirt","Nov 11, 2008"

4.18,8.3,4,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Sits a hazy copper orange with a small off-white head. Nose of sourish, tart fruit, some cookie dough, and maybe a smidgen of grass and spice. Not much pumpkin spice though. Toasted malts and tart Brett. funk start out the palate. Light caramel and cookie malt fill-in midway, with buttery, pecan pie accents near the finish. Hints of spices linger in the finish, with residual tart wildness. Medium-bodied with soft, light carbonation. Good drinkability. Probably the subtlest """pumpkin ale""" I have ever had. Probably the only sour one as well! Works for me, since I'm not crazy about overly-spiced beers anyways.","alexgash","Beers"
4.2,8.8,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Wow, this was really interesting and seemed to me that Jolly Pumpkin pretty much pulled off what they were shooting for with this. A Pumpkin Ale that is rich with notes of chocolate and spice but possessing their trademark """Wild""" quality. I liked that the tartness didn't quite dominate the taste as much as it did the nose, allowing much more of the pumpkin qualities to shine through. A unique beer for sure that I'm glad to have been able to try.","Kegatron","0"
