"Overall, a good pumpkin beer."
"This beer is great up until the mouth-feel, just very light, otherwise, everything I look for in a pumpkin beer. Mildly spiced."
""
""
"It's a good beer."
""
"Worth a try but not much more."
"Pours with a white, small head. Has a dark golden color. The smell has an awful stench of bad squash rather than pumpkin. Thankfully, it doesn't taste as it smells. The pumpkin is prevalent, but not overwhelming, combing well with the brewed spices."

"Clear light pumpkin-orange color with minimal head and lacing. Aroma is of spiced pumpkin pie, cool and refreshing. I personally would say this is your average seasonal pumpkin ale with more dry spice than actual true pumpkin flavor. Very seldom do you get a pumpkin ale that tastes like pumpkin and is not overpowered with dry cinnamon and nutmeg. Unfortunately, this beer falls into the dry spice category. Overall, feels ok and the balance is not THAT bad. Average beer"

"Not so good that i expected. Caramel tone."
""
"Pours a filtered polished copper with a thin slightly off-white head. Aromas of pumpkin spices, nutmeg, all with a slight chemical tinge to it. Light bodied mouthfeel with tastes of light pumpkin, light maltiness, with a light vanilla finish. Feels a bit manufactured and lacking a naturalness. Wouldn’t buy this one again."

"Overall - very good pumpkin beer, focused a lot of the spices that are normally associated with pumpkin rather than pumpkin directly. However, the pumpkin still deserves top billing as the interplay between the earthy pumpkin and the spices makes this a very tasty beer that advocates should try."
"Overall: Not what I was expecting with the hops. Kind of interesting. The unexpected hop forwardness is not a bad thing, just not what I expected from a pumpkin ale."

"O- Not a bad pumpkin.  the biscuit malts are actually an interesting mix in with the pumpkin."
""
"O- I would have liked a tad more hops, a little less brown sugar, and maybe not quite as dry. But, these are things to quibble over. Overall, the beer is tasty and goes very well with beef stew, I might add. It isn't my favorite pumpkin beer, but I enjoyed it and I would be happy to have it again. Far more positives than negatives -- kudos to Brooklyn Brewery."

"Great mild pumpkin with little sweetness and easily drinkable."
""
"Just okay,  many other pumpkin ales out there that are better."
""
""
"You are not getting the whole pie here just  subtle pumpkin and spice flavor sitting on top of a very nice ale. I could call this a session pumpkin ale. I had 3 of these (on tap) in a row before and during dinner at Skinflints in Bay Ridge Brooklyn last night. I have not had another pumpkin ale that would bear up to repeated servings and also not interfere with a diner's food enjoyment. Well done Brooklyn!"

"Bottle from the Warehouse. Pours amber color with off-white head. Aroma of cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, malt and pumpkin. Taste of pumpkin pie with bitter hops and nutmeg at the end. Light bodied with mild carbonation. Very nice."
""
""
"I found this really disappointing after the Bros had given it a 87.  Lighter than most ales.  Had it on draft.  Really light with subtle hints of pumpkin and spices.  Very smooth.  Just not a lot of flavor.  I like seasonal beers full of flavor and I expect my pumpkin ales to taste at least a little like pumpkin pie.  This was an easy ale to drink and you could drink several even after a hot day of mowing grass.  Not bad.  Just too light and lacking of that fall punch of spices."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is an acceptable pumpkin ale that bears many of the hallmarks of the style, but it doesn’t do much to distinguish itself from the finer examples of the style (e.g. Whole Hog)."
""
""
""
""
"Yummy!"

"Overall I thought this was an Ok beer and I thought it was an average at best example of a Pumpkin Ale, it had most of the flavors and aromas that I look for in the style, but in the end the flavors that needed to stick out the most and be showcased didn't and that made for a bland and uninteresting Pumpkin Ale.  This beer didn't have the best drinkability, it was fairly smooth, watery, crisp, slightly prickly, not filling at all and the taste didn't do a good job at holding my attention, one is more than enough for me, I wouldn't want to drink another one.  What I like the most about this beer was the aroma, it seemed to be pretty true to style and it wasn't as light as some of the other aspects.  What I liked the least about this beer was the taste and mouthfeel, they were both just too light and they made me lose interest fast.  I wouldn't buy this beer again, it's easy to find a much better Pumpkin Ale and I wouldn't recommend it either since I think it's just not a great example of the style.  All in all I wasn't impressed with this beer, it left me wanting more in just about every aspect and it just wasn't memorable.  So far this is my least favorite beer from Brooklyn Brewery and it's on the lower end of the spectrum as far as Pumpkin Ales go.  I appreciate the effort and that you guys didn't go crazy with the spices, but in the end this beer just wasn't for me, better luck next time guys."

"A very pleasant pumpkin beer. Pours a golden yellow/orange with a fizzy head. The smell is full of pumpkin in the beginning but then reverts to a lot of spice. Nutmeg and cinnamon. The taste was refreshing with a lighter taste than most pumpkin beers but still having a good amount of flavor. For the price point I thought it was a great buy."
"Overall: though pumpkin ales are not my favoured style, this is one of the better examples I have comes across to date. The price is okay too, at around AU$65 a case of 24 x 330mL (2014)."

"Not much pumpkin or pumpkin spice flavor, but it's a nice ale that I really enjoyed. Still searching for the perfect pumpkin ale...but this one isn't it."

"I'm new to pumpkin ales I must admit. But I started with Wayerbacher Imperial Pumpkin ale. Perhaps that set the bar very high for me, because this ale is not even close to Wayerbacher. It is pleasant don't get me wrong, but it's watery and not nearly spicy enough. I will finish my six pack and never get it again. I love brooklyn brewery I really do but this one is not so great."
""
""
""
"Not much to this beer, and I fail to detect the pumpkin flavor at all."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O:  After having some great pumpkin beers, this one is falling towards the bottom of the pack.  Just not enough spice to back up the weird flavors in this."
""
"Slightly sour note, lots of clove and cinnamon, ginger. Way too spicy for my liking."

"Not offensive in any way. Mild sweet pumpkin aroma with muted spices. Smooth clean taste with crisp medium-high carbonation. Pumpkin, cinnamon and vanilla are detectable, but just barely. Decent light pumpkin ale, but probably not one I'll buy again."
""
"Overall- A decent pumpkin beer and worth a try when all the Fall beers appear. The spices are not overdone and pumpkin flavor is there. Easy drinking and flavorful."

"PRPA poured a translucent orange/brown colour, taking on more of an amber hue when backlit. A steady stream of small, fast rising bubbles was visible, and pouring produced about 1""" of off-white head, which settled down after four minutes to a thin, foamy cap that left some modest lacing down the glass. Its aroma was of pumpkin pie spices and hops, with the pumpkin spices being a little understated for me. The beer's flavour was of sweet malts with a hint of brown sugar up front, transitioning to the pumpkin pie spices, and finishing with a mild hop bitterness that lingered for a few seconds after swallowing the beer. Again, I found the pie spices to be too subtle for my taste. PRPA had a medium carbonation that suited it well, and I would describe it as light to medium bodied. Overall, this is a decent pumpkin beer, but simply not in the same class as say, Southern Tier's Pumking Ale. PRPA sells for $2.45 per 355 ml bottle, and is reasonably priced.The beer is available from August through November."

"Didn't know exactly what to expect, maybe a sweet spicy (expected ginger) beer, so i don't really know if the style is the problem or Post Road in particular. I wouldn't look again for this one, but i will definitely try more pumpkin ales."

"The aroma for this beer starts with a ton of caramel and a touch of molasses. There’s also hit of fall spice and pumpkin, but a little more of the spice. The flavor follows similarly, bread and biscuit malts with some buttery notes. The pumpkin and spice come mostly as the aftertaste, rounded off with a good bitter balance. A nice fall classic from Brooklyn Brewery."

"My aggro pour netted three fingers of dense, but rocky, tawny head with good retention. Color was a coppery-amber (SRM = ~ 17) with NE-quality clarity. Nose seemed to rely more heavily on nutmeg and vanilla than cinnamon, although that was also evident. Sticky lacing began to form as the head fell while I typed, so all was in readiness for the first sip. Mouthfeel was on the thin side, although not outright watery. The taste was a bit more muted than I remember in this one, slightly spicy, but not enough to peg the meter in either direction. I did get a pleasant wash of biscuit malt on the finish, though, which gave it a kind of cinnamon toast-like aspect. Overall, it did not live up to my memory, but I have had far worse, especially this year."
"This beer's not bad at all but compared to a lot of the other Pumpkin beers that exist out there, it just doesn't have very much character that stands out. Pass on this one."
""
""
"In just about every respect this beer falls short of what a pumpkin should be. Pours from the bottle light caramel in color. The aroma is cinnamon and pumpkin. Very effevescent with the bubbles on the palate. My least favorite part was the bitter hoppy finish. Not recommend for those that like Southern Tiers Pumpking."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"Overall: Not a bad beer. Very drinkable, but the body is a bit light. Not a ton of spices here, but present. This may be a good gateway beer for those who don't like pumpkin beers since it is very restrained."
""
""
""
"Drinkability: Natural pumpkin; Up there with the best. Nothing wrong with Pumpkin ales in the fall!"

"Overall- Another quality pumpkin ale. Different from many as it has a strong pumpkin component and also a strong beer component, nicely done."
"Overall: This is a very good tasting beer. Very enjoyable, very refreshing, but I’m a little disappointed in it this year. It’s not as bold in pumpkin or spice flavors than I remember it being in past years. Still a good beer though."
""
""
""
"Pours medium copper with fast fizzy foam that settles out. Pumpkin pie nose, nutmeg, cinnamon. Taste is a full rich pumpkin malt. Firm carbonation. Crisp. Strong hop backs the flavor nicely. Good spices. Really good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I like a good pumpkin beer and Post Road is a good, although not great, representative of this style. It’s an all- around likeable pumpkin ale that most anyone who tries it will find to their liking."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - There is nothing technically wrong with this beer, but I don't care for its emphasis on spices. It is more interesting than many pumpkin beers I've tried, but in my opinion, it is not all that pleasant. Just one more reminder to me why I don't like pumpkin beers."
""
""
""
"This is, overall, a good beer. It's so easy to drink that it wouldn't offend the domestic beer fans in your family."
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with good flavors and aromas. Not the greatest pumpkin ale but still very enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"Get yer pumpkin beer here. If you like this style, give it a try."
""
"Overall: For a pumpkin ale I could drink one after another. Its a easy drinker."
"Special aside: This is the 100th beer on my """had""" list."
""
""
""
"O: a lighter version of the pumkin beers coming out this season. Worth a try if you are looking for that everyday beer but not for those single glass going for flavor punch!"
""
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a copper color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of nutmeg, cinnamon. Taste is kind of mild, some spices, pumpkin, a bit light for the style but still refreshing and drinkable. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a decent beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Alright, I am giving Pumpkin another chance. Had it as a special beer at Luccas in Back Bay. Had it on tap. Poured a nice orange color with little head and decent carbonation. Very spivey sweet smell. Taste isn't half bad. Not something I want a to of, but has a mild mealtimes that balances the fake pumpkin taste. All in all ok. After the disastrous Shipyard, this may make me want to have 1 pumpkin ale a year. Ok beer. Not great, but almost done"
""
""
"Draught @ Maggies in Hackensack: This one pours a clear amber color. There was a wisp of an off white head on it that left some lacing. The nose is spicy but not overdone. Lots of pumpkin pie spices. The taste is good. Nice malt body, pumpkin pie spices strong but not overdone. No sweetness. Good!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Well balanced and minimal excess. On target for style, although this one will be clearly enjoyed by some and not by others. It is an ale with pumpkin and due to the minimal sweetness more than one can be enjoyed in a session."
""
""
""
""

""

"very good for a pumpkin beer. i picked up 6 different types of pumpkin beers, this one was the best of what I sampled. generally i'm not crazy about pumpkin beer, but just for fun this was really pretty good to change it up from my usual styles. i'd buy again."
"Post Road pours a darker amber color with a nice large lacing head. There is a earthy and gourde type aroma. The taste has a nice subtle spicy, and broad pumpkin flavors. Nice body, a bit earthy flavors. Overall its a nice pumpkin ale, not a pumpkin pie ale, just a straight up pumpkin ale."
""
""
"As with others, I had higher expectations for this beer. Does have a wonderful golden orange color, quickly dissipating head,no lacing to speak of, and moderate carbonation. Now the bad news, barely discernible pumpkin or spice flavor. I will stick to Pumpking and especially Schlafly pumpkin any day of the week."
""
""
""
"This is the first """dissapointment""" from Brooklyn since I am such a fan of their Black Chocolate Stout and had high hopes for the Post Road Pumpkin. I have had this both on-tap and from the bottle to give it a fair shot - since I did not like it so much at first taste, but I am sticking to my guns and calling it just """okay""". In my opinion, if a beer boats """Pumpkin""" on the label, it should taste like pumpkin. It was a stretch to get any pumpkin flavor from this one. The beer itself is not of a bad flavor, the review is based on the fact that this is a Pumpkin beer and there was very little Pumpkin flavor present (if any). There are some nice notes of spice and a light balance of some sweetness and fall flavor, but overall this is coming in far short of a good Pumpkin beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not a bad beer, but not the pumpkin-forward beer I was hoping for. If you need to satisfy pumpkin beer lovers as well as pumpkin beer detractors this would be a good bridge, but it won't be the favorite of either group."
""
"Overall: A pretty good pumpkin ale. Good balance of pumpkin, toasty malts, and spices with a decent hop backing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: The vast majority of pumpkin beers on the market today share a similar track. Subtlety goes out the window as brewers try to make their offerings memorable by shoving various blends of pumpkin spice in the consumer's face. Brooklyn's 'less is more' take on the style is a refreshing change of pace. Brooklyn beers often take a culinary sort of approach, and that's just what Post Road does. Like a good chef, the architects of this beer seem to realize that when quality ingredients are used, these should be the main focus of the dish (or in this case the beer). The dish (or beer) should be allowed to speak for itself, and any spicing or accoutrements should be used sparingly and only to enhance the desirable qualities that already exist. The specialty malts and real pumpkin used in Post Road are the main focus, and as a result the consumer is rewarded with a very drinkable and authentic tasting pumpkin beer. Put down that lifeless glass of pumpkin spice that you're probably holding right now and give this one a shot."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This overall profile is what I like in a pumpkin beer, or any flavored beer for that matter. Others may disagree and feel this beer is too bland... but taste is in the mouth of the beholder. Drink away!"
""
""
""
""
"Continue in my 2013 quest for the Pumpkin beer of the year. Again with so many others, there was an abundance of spices that came upfront in the nose. Then the taste , it was a bit carbonated, so that the spices got washed a bit, but what I felt what was lost the most was the lack of true pumpkin taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"We are on a taste test to find the best Pumpkin ale for fall beer of choice. Post Road Pumpkin is bitter tasting with more spice then others I've tired. This is no a pumpkin ale that I could drink all night. I always willing to try a beer once. Have a great day"

"This is a solid pumpkin ale. It's a little lighter than what I'm used to, but the pumpkin flavor is nicely balanced with spice, and the spice never overwhelms. The flavors are fresh but simple, and hops are minimal, with the malt providing the canvas for this brew. Mouthfeel is on the thin side but not too thin, and the carbonation is medium-low. This beer goes down very easy, and the pumpkin flavor tastes natural and is in check. Overall, this is not an overpowering or bold beer, but everything works pretty well. I'd certainly drink it again."

"Overall-Now one of my standby pumpkin ales. Not the BEST I've ever had, but still very good. So far, everything from Brooklyn has been worth a shot."
""
""
"As for the alcohol, that was exactly where I needed it to be so it was present but not strong enough to be a distraction. In my opinion, a good Pumpkin Ale should go well with pie and cool-whip topping and this feel just a bit short of it. Thankfully, it was not a spice bomb so this ended up falling somewhere in the middle when it came to beers of this style. While not the best out there, this was easily enjoyable and shouldn't offend much of anyone looking to try out a Fall seasonal beer when the quench arises."
""
"A nice pumpkin ale from Brooklyn Brewery."
""
""
""
"Interesting, though as beers go it's not amazing. It seems to have no carbonation for some reason(?). The aroma was good and nicely rounded, but the flavour seemed a tad acrid and dry, with mild spice/pumpkin notes. The body was also surprisingly thin and flat. It's hard to make comparisons when I haven't tried many examples of this style, but it comes across as pretty average. OK, though no need to seek it out."

"Poured this 12 oz bottle of Pumpkin Ale into a pint glass. This ale poured a amber/orangish color- produced a thick white head and featured great retention and left a nice amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma consisted of fresh cooked pumpkins, pumpkin pie spice , (nutmeg, clove and all-spice. )-Medium body, this pumpkin ale had a malted grain base, a slight flavor of cooked pumpkin, and a well balanced amount of pumpkin pie spice. Overall, very nice example of the style and another great beer from Brooklyn Brewing."

"Brooklyn Brewery Post Road Pumpkin Ale ---3.5/5"

"This was a decent pumpkin ale, nothing extraordinary, but easy to drink."
""
""
"Overall- It's fine, but I have to say that I'd prefer if they went all the way and presented more of a dessert beer. As it is, it's better than most lighter pumpkin/pumpkin spice ales, but I find myself wanting more spice flavor and the feel is a bit dull and lifeless."
"Overall-Solid Pumpkin beer. When I'm not in the mood for sweet and spicy syrup (like Pumpking,, which I do get a hankering for at times), this is my alternate go-to."
""
""
""
"Overall: A better-than-average example of a pumpkin ale. There are certainly much better examples out there (Punkin and Pumking come to mind) but this is way better than your usual Blue Moon or other big-brewery attempt at the style. Not bad..."
"liked this a lot. i mean, its getting a little late in the season for this, but it tasted nice on tap. the pour was pretty much clear pale orange with a smallish white head. nose was minimally spiced and heavy on the cooked squash, a major plus. malt profile was middle of the road in smell and taste, and the flavor exuded fresh pumpkins. a little cinnamon and vanilla in there, but not even approaching too much, just a nice balanced fall beer. yeast makes a brooklyn style appearance too, spicy and rich, but not crowding anything out. they do that well. bright mouthfeel, with quite excited carbonation and a medium to full body. more sessionable than i am describing it to be, a good fall seasonal all up, especially on tap."

"Pours amber with orange hues with a two finger off-white head. A bit of lacing. Pumpkin and spice, especially allspice joined by earthy hops on the nose. Opens with cinnamon, allspice, and nutmeg and pumpkin which carries through this finish. Very light caramel malt bill. Light breadiness. Crisp and clean, light bodied, well-carbonated. One of the least sweet and mildly spiced pumpkin ales that I've had. Very enjoyable."

"It's that time of year where it seems like everyday I am trying a new pumpkin brew. This one from Brooklyn Brewery is as solid as they come. Not remarkable in any one way, other than maybe the initial aroma of pumpkin pie spices during the pour. Not sweet however, definitely has more of a hoppy quality. A good beer, and if you like pumpkin enough to drink several at once, this could fill a session for sure."
"O: An adequate offering in the style but this one does not really stand out for me - there are better pumpkin beers generally available. Easy to drink and not so intense in flavor so it could be sessionable."
"Lighter medium body, slightly higher carbonation, sticky and a little chewy on the tongue. I don't typically like pumpkin beers, but I enjoyed the more prominent spice and milder sweetness of this one. Decent balance and pleasant drinkability."
"Overall - A bit spice heavy for my taste in pumpkin beers, but still tasty. On track to being a very good pumpkin ale with a little bit of work on the flavour and feel."

"Overall- This is an ok pumpkin ale. It's one of the more sessionable pumpkins. You could drink a few of these without any problem."
""
"O: Overall an easy drinking beer that is too little pumpkin which just leaves you with a regular ale.... Some pumpkin beers are big pumpkin, or big spice or both, but this is little pumpkin hardly any spice so it's hard to say much more for it, especially with all the other pumpkin beers you're finding at this time of year. Unless you've tried all the other ones, I wouldn't put this at the top of your list and wouldn't buy it again. At least they're using real pumpkin but need to work on it a little more...."

"Pale amber-orange colour, one finger of white head with a little bit of lace. Smell is spicy with lots of ginger, some nutmeg and cinnamon add some warming spice notes, pumpkin, and some malt with a bit of what I am assuming is earthy hop. Taste is spicy like the nose, cinnamon is more apparent, nutmeg, pumpkin, some malt flavours but this is mostly a spice job here. Medium-high carbonation, medium body. This is just ok and something I cant see myself coming back to, better than average though just slightly."

"Overall - This pumpkin ale could be a very good daily drinker. Only I could see getting tired of the Nutmeg after awhile"
""
""
""
"A good mix of ginger and spice as well as good balance overall, making a solid beer that was something different from what I would usually buy. I'm not sure I would have this one again but it is certainly a style of beer I hope to try again."
"O= This is somewhat underwhelming. An easy drinker with low alcohol but I wish there was a little more flavor."

"don't see the appeal in this one. i really enjoy certain pumpkin beers, but i wouldnt have even known this was a pumpkin beer if it was on the label. i think part of the appeal of the pumpkin beer idea is that pumpkin pie taste with the spices of cinnamon, nutmeg, etc. i didnt taste any of that in this one and found it to be rather bland and boring. it didn't have much of a taste and i really wonder why people like it so much. not for me."
""
"Overall: not even worth going past a few sips, very disappointing from a good brewery"
"O: a nice pumpkin beer. If you think pumpkin beers have to be sweet, this is a good counter-argument. This brew has a mild sweetness balanced out with hops and botanicals if the pumpkin itself."
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: A pretty average pumpkin beer. Nice and light at 5.0% ABV. Would I drink it again? Probably not until next October."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"For a bottled ale, this had taste, and I am more of a draft beer drinker but the taste was unique and there. I couldn't pick up on the spices the label mentions, but it tasted appropriate for the type of ail."
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Didn't have high hopes for this one, but was nicely surprised. Not the best by any mean, but a very drikable/enjoyable pumpkin ale."
""
""
"O: All in all this is a pretty good pumpkin beer. I like the slight hop/bitter play in the taste however think it leaves a little to be desired. I do think theres a bunch of better pumpkin seasonal's out there, though."
""
""
""
"Flavor wise I pick out what reminds me of roasted pumpkin seeds, not a sweet pumpkin pie or anything like that, more of a grainy flavor. Finishes on the dry side, Overall nice pumpkin brew."
""
""
""
"Poured into a pint glass. Pours orange with a thick eggshell colored head. There are some visible tiny bubbles rising in the beer. The head retreats slowly, leaving some sticky lacing on the side of the glass. I detect some bready malt aromas in the nose with some pumpkin. I also pick up some of those pumpkin pie spices (cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg, and clove). The taste revealed something missing in the aroma: hops. Those citrusy and herbal hop notes hit the mouth on the first sip to lead the palate into this pumpkin ale. I got those bready malts with those pumpkin pie spices. I get some of the pumpkin too. There's some mild sweetness in the flavor that is balanced well by the spices and some of the hop bitterness. The body is light to medium with moderate carbonation. The finish is somewhat clean with a slightly dry finish. The drinkability is high. This is a very good beer and a bit different from your typical pumpkin ale."
""
""
""
"O: Beer that wets the palate in a way not normal for this style, and I like it. One of the only pumpkin beers I’ve tried this year that I’d buy in a six-pack. Not a lot of pumpkin, but tons of Brooklyn – that’s probably what I like about it."
"Overall. Not too good. There are far better pumpkin ales. Add in a bit of sweetness?"
""
""
""
"O - Brooklyn Brewery's Post Road Pumpkin Ale seems aimed at being a rendition of the colonial American pumpkin ales and succeeds in bringing the beer flavor through the pumpkin and spice ingredients, but perhaps a little too much. This beer tastes and feels much more like a lager than an ale and while it offers a big nose, the flavor seems lacking even if it is off the pumpkin ale beaten path. It's modest pumpkin and spice taste make it a good candidate for food pairing though, especially around the holidays, as well as being a good introductory pumpkin beer for the novice."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The nose was great, but I felt like the taste was venturing into Marzen territory. Easily drinkable, but definitely lacking the definitive pumpkin pie flavors in the taste. I had a Schlafly pumpkin ale after this and it just confirmed my experiences."
""
""
"Taste is a bit of a letdown after the wonderful nose. Almost a stretch to say that it is reminiscent of the aroma. Toasted grains and vegetal, woody bitterness up front. Vaguely sweet pie filling maltiness fills in, before faint coffee bitterness and the assemblage of pumpkin pie spices take us into the finish. Moderate body with a slightly thin feel. Overall, a decent pumpkin ale, but a little disappointing on the taste."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Falls a bit short as a pumpkin ale, but does quite well as a marzen substitute. Not an interesting beer, but one that can be drunk by the pitcher with food if so inclined."
""
""
""
"Overall, this isnt a stand out pumpkin beer but its a solid offering that does well on all categories."
""
""
""
"I'm pretty sure pumpkin ales are supposed to be for fun/to celebrate the fall season but I could go for one of these in the spring :)"
""
""
""
""
"O: Pretty average to slightly above average pumpkin beer. Doesn't amaze but it's a pretty easy drinker."
""
""
""
""
"SOLID, BEGINNERS PUMPKIN BREW!"
"Overall, not a bad beer but definatley could be a bit more rounded. Worth a try though."
""
""
""
"Was hoping this would be a little more bold but was a bit disappointed. It's not for me, but if you prefer a more subtle pumkin flavour you might really enjoy this."
""
"Flavor is much the same; spices up front; caramel malt; toasted bread; hints of pumpkin flesh; brown sugar. Just a bit of earthy, hoppy bitterness for balance. Fairly dry in the finish. Body is just on the lighter side of medium, and the carbonation was a bit on the high side. In the end the feel was crisp but unsatisfying for me; it wasn’t creamy or smooth and the beer, overall, lacked the rich dessert quality of pumpkin pie implied by all of the spices."
""
"Some good things (a pumpkin beer that actually tastes like beer) and some bad things (medicinal hop and sprizty mouthfeel) put Post Road in the middle of the pumpkin pile."
""
"O: a below average beer but about average for style."
""
""
""
"I was very disappointed in Brooklyns attempt at a pumpkin ale. I have often loved Brooklyn's other choices but this seemed to fall short. Most notably was its lack of true pumpkin taste. It had very little at first and finished with noticeable nutmeg, cinnamon and clove. The feel was a bit flat and and so was the taste."
""
""
""
"1.5 D: This was tough to drink following the DFH Punkin' that I had a few hours prior. Normally bland beers are easy enough to drink and you don't really mind drinking them. However, the watered down vibe this has going makes it a displeasure to drink. Avoid."
"It's not a bad beer, but this one needs improvement. There are better pumpkin beers out there."
"O: I had this beer a few times in the bottle at a friends place so I decided to take some home and give it a review, it tastes much better in the glass, although it is definitely lacking in some areas. Overall this is a solid pumpkin ale that maintains a good foundation, but needs a little work."
"O: I really, REALLY like pumpkin beers... I'm probably a rare breed in that I *crave* them (when well done) pretty much year-round, no matter the season. Living in the Pacific Northwest , there aren't very many good/great examples of pumpkin ales outside of the excellent ones Elysian produces. This one from Brooklyn? Kinda 'meh'. Drinkable enough, but it seems basically like an amber or under-hopped pale ale with some spices pitched in. I had NO PROBLEM finishing it, however... and, yeah, I'd drink it again... mostly because it eschews 'fake' sweetness, for a creeping earthy spicing."
""
""
"O: A solid pumpkin ale that has a nice mix of spice, pumpkin, and malts. Nothing over the top, and the abv is definitely on the tame side compared to most, if not all, pumpkin beers. Another one that's worth a shot if you like pumpkin beers"
"While I love the amped up pumpkin ales, I can also appreciate a classic like this one from the Brooklyn Brewery. Of all the pumpkin ales available on the market, I imagine that this is the one that best resembles the kind of ale preferred by Daniel Shays and his comrades back in the fall of 1786 just before they launched their historical rebellion in Western Mass."
""
""
"O - This pumpkin ale is pretty straight forward - not really complex and not an overachiever for the style. However, the nice thing about this offering is that it doesn't over-do the spices and lets the pumpkin come through a bit. Plus, it's pretty drinkable for a pumpkin ale and a great candidate if you're looking to have a few glasses in one sitting."
""
"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a slightly hazed, orange-copper coloring with a thin, filmy, very low profile head. Aromas of light and sweet pumpkin, with a light, balanced spicing of cinnamon and all spice. Flavors are roasted, but remain light. Sweet, rich pumpkin backbones with a dose of the cinnamon spicing that keep everything light and balanced. The aftertaste has a more complete, pumpkin bread flavor to it. Very tasty on the finish, with a clean, smooth mouthfeel. Solid brew."
"O – This is the best pumpkin beer that I’ve had so far. Many people may disagree with me because it’s not loaded with pumpkin or pumpkin pie spice flavors. However, that’s how fruit beers are supposed to be. The fruit is supposed to add to the aroma and flavor of the base beer, not replace the base beer. Bready and caramel malt and grassy, earthy hops can still be appreciated here. The pumpkin and the spices add to the beer and make it that much better and more festive. Great fall beer from Brooklyn."

"This was an ok Pumpkin - very sessionable. The beer definitely didn’t appear artificial, but the pumpkin notes that were detected seemed a little light. I would have preferred a bit more pumpkin and some biscuit notes to balance out the more prominent spice notes. If Bud Light were to do a Pumpkin Ale - this would be it."
""
"Good, but not great."
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel - The pumpkin and spices balance against each other and create a smooth beer that also feels just a little carbonated. Overall, a smooth beer that is perfect for fall when you don't want something too heavy."
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Great pumpkin beer!"
"It's hard to find a pumpkin ale that gives you pumpkin taste with either overdosing you or giving you the feel that its artificial but this beer seems to do that, a nice pumpkin tasting beer."
""
""
""
"Overall this is the third pumpkin ale I had this year but as I remember from having before it's nothing groundbreaking for a pumpkin ale. At least it isn't over hopped so it's at least palatable."
"Overall – It is an alright pumpkin beer. It has a nice look and aroma, but is a little too dry and the flavors are just malt and pumpkin, somewhat boring."
"Overall: the good ones of these all taste the same, them some taste really bad."
""
""
""
""
""
"Always serves as a stopgap pumpkin example every fall season. A have-to-try once a year. I'm good with this."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Drinkable, which I find as a rare trait for pumpkin beers (take Shipyard's mess for example). Lots of things it could improve on but if you like a bit of pumpkin, this is worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"M: Medium-bodied, nice amount of carbonation"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - For an ale, its decent...for a Pumpkin Ale, to me it is lacking. If you are looking for a (very) understated pumpkin flavor and aroma but with still a hint, then this one is for you. But if you want something full bodied in the gourd category, you might want to pass this one by."
"Poured a clear golden orange color with a finger of foam head and lots of tiny bubbles rising to the top. Smells is strong with cinnamon, all spice, and a hint of pumpkin. Taste is spicy at first with a creamy feel, bit of cinnamon burn at the end, lots of all spice with some nutmeg seems to mask the pumpkin. Overall an easy to drink pumpkin ale and one of the better pumpkin beers I've tasted."
"O/D-Broke down and bought an early Pumpkin Ale. This one is decent. A single bottle is enough for me. The more it warms the less I like it unfortunately."
"O: a very casual dry pumpkin ale, good drinkability, but I think I'm partial to more decadent pumpkins (with more sugar, strength, and flavors)"

"Burnt orange hue. Finger of off white head. Smells of pumpkin and the usual nutmeg, cinnamon, all spice. Flavors are right in line with the nose. Pumpkin and malty tones. Plenty of pie spices to get the point across. Medium body with mild carbonation. Slightly above average pumpkin in a sea of similar beers."

"Post Road’s pumpkin ale is a subtle, very spicy version of the style. I would’ve enjoyed a bit more pumpkin to back up the heavy spice flavors."

"O - Not the best pumpkin beer, but it's worth trying...there is a huge earthy/green presence to the beer...the spice level could have been bumped up a notch"
"Over it was ok and pretty drinkable but I won't buy it again."
"This beer looked and smelled ok...sort of a murky wheat beer look but orange and smelled malty and some spice but no cinnamon or pumpkin smells at all. Taste was really bad. Metallic tasting mess with lingering bitter finish. No pumpkin flavor at all. Overall I'm guessing I got a bad 6-pack because others sampled it and all thought it was bad tasting."
"D: Sort of a lightly hopped pale accented by a deft touch of gourd and spices. Won’t slow you down like many of the heavy, high abv offerings. A bit of a session seasonal."
"O. Good brew I really liked that there was some malty flavor and not overpowering pumpkin."
"O - a very solid beer. definitely a must try for pumpkin lovers."
"Overall: A """meh""" offering from Brooklyn. However, I remember having this a few years ago and it was MUCH worse. This is OK, but there are too many other better pumpkin beers available."
"It's a close race for my favorite pumpkin ale."
"D - Tasty pumpkin ale with an interesting flavor profile and surprisingly weighty mouthfeel. Definitely one to revisit."
"Sampled from a bottle, best by February 2012. Orangish-yellowish in color with a light haze. Poured with a frosty white foam that slowly reduced to a healthy cap. Coriander and cinnamon aromas are dominant with bready malt and pumpkin aromas beneath. Smooth and refreshing feel, but a little on the watery side. Coriander, cinnamon flavors up front with sweet pumpkin flavors beneath from beginning to end. Sweetness intensifies a bit at the finish before ending with a lightly spicy aftertaste."
"Amber in color. Just a fingers worth of orangeish head. Smell is of cinnamon, clove and pumpkin. Taste is right in line with the smell. As it warms it is more like detergent. Definitely drink this cold. Pretty ho hum of an offering."
"This beer reminds me more of a well balanced Southern Tier Pumking. It has that same gingerbread taste but it blends more vanilla and everything else better. Pumking was a little hard to keep drinking because of how sweet it is. Post Road though take it down a notch and it comes out tasting like a Southern Tier Pumking Light. It also doesnt drink so heavy that it still tastes like a beer. Definitely one of my favorite pumpkin beers this year."
"O: Just not a very good beer. Spices and blandness dominate the nose and palate with a watery body. Nothing to get excited about."
"O- kinda of disappointing beer. it's good if you want to be able to drink it down quick but if you are looking for full flavor and slow drinking better move along to the next one."
"O- I don't necessarily want a pumpkin ale that has enough spice to choke you. But this is just really bland, with not much going on at all."
"Mouthfeel is ok. Body bigger than you'd expect from this one, because of the pumpkin. Earthy with a dry finish. Not a bad beer by any means, but as it warms up the taste gets better but the smell gets worse. I cracked it open because I was in the mood for a pumpkin beer, it sufficed. Had it several times but finally took the time to review it."
"A slightly above average beer. Good to have a sixer during the holiday, but pretty much useless any other time of the year."
"12 ounce bottle, best by Jan 2012. Pours hazy golden orange color with a nice 2 finger dense off white head with great retention that reduces to a thick lacing cap that lasts. Tons of carbonation streaming up from the bottom. Aromas of big fresh pumpkin, nutmeg, cinnamon, clove, caramel, and bread. Some very nice aromas here, probably the most pumpkin forward aromas I have ever had in a beer. Taste of pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, bread, and allspice. No bitterness noticed, but there are some lingering notes of pumpkin, bread, allspice, and cinnamon on the finish. Taste is a bit on the watery side, but overall really solid and enjoyable. Medium carbonation and body; with a bit of a creamy mouthfeel that goes down very smoothly. Nice balance of flavors. No alcohol noticed in the taste or finish as expected. Overall this is a really nice and sessionable pumpkin ale. I would have this again."
"O - I am shocked that this is rated as highly as it is. Unless I somehow picked up a bottle that was cut with Busch Light, it's just not a good pumpkin... or really a good beer period. I'd prefer it over some things, but over most any other pumpkin? Not likely."
"Overall, a great fall brew that is as clean as a pumpkin ale can be without losing its fall essence."
"O - Pretty good flavor, just needs to be bolder to put the hops in the background instead of the foreground. I wish the flavor matched the aroma's intensity. A decent pumpkin ale if you get the chance to try it, though probably not going to make the list for my fall staples."
"O - Not the pumpkin pie with a dollop of whipped cream pumpkin ale that I like. Pumpkin spice is way overdone, and the pine hops just seem way out of place. Won't be getting this again."
"Overall: A good pumpkin beer. Nothing terribly interesting going on. Well balanced."
"The zippy carbonation could be dialed back a notch but that is a minor quibble. I think this is a keeper!"
"O: This isn't a bad beer. I had never seen it before, or even heard of this one, so I grabbed a bottle to give it a shot. I probably won't ever buy it again. There are much better pumpkins."
"The beer exits the bottle a deep caramel color with a thin head. A sweet malt aroma with definite contributions of pumpkin and spice: nutmeg, cardamom and the like. Malty goodness coats the palate, with just a hint of husk. Pumpkin is certainly in the mix with with light hint of spice. A nice beer. Definitely more of a slow drinker, but still something you could drink all night. Its a subtle smoothly brewed beer."
"O: My favorite pumpkin beer that I have tried to date. This is a nice seasonal, and in my opinion was blended well. Nothing was overwhelming of any of the flavors, yet this remained easy to drink. I think this could be a good pumpkin beer to look at getting a growler of."
"An ever so lightly hazed brew with a good sized head and very good retention. Good lacing as well. A lovely pumpkin tinged amber color. Smell is that magic balance of malty ale and pumpkin pie. The spices are deliciously inviting and respectfully submissive to the sweet bready malt core. I get notes of vanilla and caramel as well as light earthy hops. Pumpkin flows throughout. Taste brings a bigger spiciness as well as pie flavors but just enough. Big malt body counters with a full flavored ale backbone. A mineral edge combines with the hops to give an English style finish that leaves a good clean pumpkin and cloved nutmeg hoppiness. Nice. Feel is smoothly carbonated with a light tingle. Weight is medium light with a refreshing, quenching quality. A good fall flavored session brew. A solid player and an excellent choice for this time of year."
"O - Haven't had many of these pumpkin ales but I can say this is an ok beer all in all. Nothing special but a definite change from the norm in my area."
"O: I really enjoyed this beer. It did lack a bit in the flavour initially but the aftertaste was good. Plus the aroma was really nice. I would definitely buy this beer again to enjoy."
"This is a pretty nice example of a pumpkin ale offering just enough pumpkin and spice without overwhelming the palate."
"After sampling about 10 different Pumpkin Ales this Fall, this might be at the bottom. Don't get me wrong - it's a fine beer, and easy drinking (I could easily go thru a 6 pack), but not a fine Pumpkin ale."
"A solid Pumpkin Ale from Brooklyn-it's pretty tasty, well balanced, subtle, and charming. Not my favorite style of beer, but this one does it pretty well, and remains drinkable enough from the low spice profile that I could actually probably put down a few."
"O - Not a bad brew, but it needs a little refining. Nothing really pops about it. Perhaps more spices/pumpkin fruit during fermentation and slight priming adjustment to improve carbonation and mouthfeel. Enjoyable, but I wouldn't drive across county lines for one."
"not what I want when I want pumpkin ales"
"O - An incredibly easy to drink, smooth, well-balanced pumpkin ale. I'd happily give this to someone who wasn't sure if they would enjoy the style."
"Morey's Bottom Line: I'm not Overly impressed with this one. It's certainly drinkable, and I wouldn't turn one down, but not something I'm going to be anxiously awaiting every year either."
"Light to medium bodied, with average carbonation. Nothing special about this beer. I like pumpkin ales to be heavier on the malt, pumpkin, spices, and sweetness, and this beer does not deliver on any of the qualities I look for. There is some pumpkin, but that is about it. Not to impressive, for a brewery which usually makes some pretty nice beers."
"O - tasty yet generally understated which I always appreciate in pumpkin brews, perfect on chilly fall evening, looking forward to another"
"I'm beginning to think I need to stick to the """Imperial""" pumpkins, cause these low abv ones don't measure up in pumpkin pie taste or body."
"O: First pumpkin beer I've had that did not have a spicy characteristic (cinnamon, nutmeg, clove....). This ale is way to one sided with the pumpkin flavor and while the malts do complement the flavor, there is not a complementary taste or feel to balance the beer out, either being from spices or hops. Extremely bland:("
"O: I was a little disappointed in the appearance and smell. Otherwise, solid pumpkin ale."
"This beer pours a clear red color. The head is a half an inch in height, and recedes quickly into minimal lacing. The aroma is of nutmeg, cinnamon, pumpkin, and hints of caramel. The taste is maltier than the aroma with the spices playing more of a background roles. The taste is very pleasing, but disappears quickly leaving almost no aftertaste. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with rather high carbonation. Overall, this is a nice beer that I could drink again, but won't go out of my way to find."
"Poured a dark copper color with a fluffy inch head that settles in with minimal lacing and what appears to be low carbonation. Very good pumpkin scent with not that much spice as a compliment. Light mouthfeel and alcohol is not detected at all. Low carbonation as expected. Taste is natural pumpkin with not many strong spices. Hops are barely present and the malty backbone is strong in this one. I wasn't blown away by Post Road Pumpkin to say the least. It's kind of an amateur and safe pumpkin ale, but it's not bad."
"O: This is one of the most pure, authentic tasting pumpkin beers I've had this season, though I have several more to go. I enjoyed it."
"I'm not sure how many more pumpkin ales I'm gonna be able to go through this year before I go crazy. Until then, though, this stuff pours a clear golden auburn topped by a finger of dirty off-white foam. The nose comprises light caramel apple, light cinnamon, light brown sugar, and a very light tinge of mandarin orange. Yeah, everything's light here...too light... The taste amps up the orange and the brown sugar, leaving pretty much everything else to be forgotten in the background. The body is a light medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a sorta-kinda lightly grainy feel. Overall, I can't help but admit my disappointment with this brew. It's weak when it shouldn't be and is unbalancedly (sure, it's a word...) flavored. Not my cup o' tea."
"It's a respectable pumpkin ale. It's not one of the best, but still good. I consider this a good entry-level pumpkin ale."
"O-This was the first pumpkin ale I ever had two years ago and loved it, and was the beer that solidified my love of craft beer. However having it again it just didn't hold up, but I would use it as an introduction to the style any day."
"O: This is one of those rare misses (at least as far as seasonal or one-off beers) for Brooklyn. A surprisingly shallow brew."
"Not too different than Smuttynose, this beer has very little in the way of a white head around the edge of glass and presents a somewhat fizzy and sharp taste. The finish is clean with a subtle aftertaste, which is quite pleasant. There are definite hints of spices, primarily cinnamon. Though these spices are not overpowering but more complementary. This is a very drinkable beer with a crisp taste and a natural pumpkin finish."
"O: Not a beer with much character. Came across as more of a spicy wheat beer. Will probably pass this one up next time."
"I can hardly taste the pumpkin anymore and I'm only half way through."
"Taste is more spice than pumpkin. I get an almost peppery feel, even. It's smooth in body, but not quite what I'd expect (or want) from a pumpkin ale. Solid, and unique, at the very least."
"I expected a little more pumpkin flavor, but the over all taste and mouthfeel of this beer are so good, the lack of a strong pumpkin flavor is a small trade off."
"Simply expected more pumpkin. Not great. Not bad. Ehhh..."
"O - good October feel, drinkable, nice fall brew. Well balanced"
"O: Not a very impressive beer. To me it seemed more like a pale ale with some pumpkin pie spices added."
"Cheers Brooklyn Brewery"
"Bought a six pack and figured that I would try a new pumpkin ale that I havn't had before. Coming off drinking a southern tier pumpkin, I was largely disappointed. The beer has a satisfying aroma and smells like pumpkin pie, cinnamon, and nutmeg. I poured it into a glass and appeared to be spot on for a pumpkin ale - orangish brown/light red with minimal head. The carbonation was moderate to below moderate. Upon tasting this beer, it was pleasant upfront with the cinnamon and other spices hitting you. Also, the pumpkin taste isn't as pleasant as other beers, as it is more bitter and """earthy""" as the other BA reviews suggest. I feel like something isn't being done with this beer to balance out this bitterness and it was too off-putting for me. The whole after taste made it very difficult for me to attempt another sip. I even tried to pass some bottles off to friends that also enjoy craft beer and they complained the bitterness made the beer unappealing. Not an awful beer but I wouldn't reccomend this to anybody that enjoys pumpkin ales."
"Bought a six pack for the season. A slight orange look was the initial appearance for the beer, but in direct light, a much more darker look could be seen. Aromas are perfect for the season, with the hints of spice and pumpkin. But, there was a nagging bready feel to the smell that kind of dissolved much of the spice flavor. Taste was very sweet and had somewhat of an earthy, syrupy sweetness to it. Definitely could taste some cinnamon and pumpkin. Mouthfeel is a bit thin though and there is a lacking carbonation. Overall, not too bad."
"After having Pumking for the first time last night, my standards for pumpkin ales have risen considerably. But this one is pretty good, and I will certainly revisit it either this year or next."
"Pours a dark straw/caramel. A fine, pleasing 1/4""" off-white head sticks around for a while. It looks nice. Smell is nothing crazy, small amounts of cinnamon, nutmeg, slight pumpkin. Taste is pleasant but nothing special, subdued nutmeg, maybe some cinnamon. Not very bold, I get a light malty backbone like straw, not a ton of pumpkin. Halfway through the beer I find the lack of flavors and a slight syrupy sweetness off-putting. Goes down smooth, some fine, vigorous carbonation off the back of the mouth. Overall this beer isn't for me, the flavors balance OK but it simply isn't assertive enough for me. Comes across as weak, my attention is drawn to the sweetness and strawy-maltiness. I won't buy this again."
"O: Always a nice reason to enjoy the return of fall, Post Road is a quality pumpkin ale that has stayed consistent. The beer has a lot of sweet notes at first that are balanced by the earthy pumpkin elements towards the end. This beer has a bit of the grit of pie crust, but it is not overly sweet. People looking for a beer that tastes like the dollop of cream on top of a pumpkin pie would not love this because the earthy pumpkin is more at work in this beverage. The spices are present but are a little more in the background that other pumpkin beers. Since the spices compliment more than star, Post Road is more restrained ."
"Overall-There's better Pumpkin beers out there, but it's not that bad."
"Overall, very good pumpkin ale."
"O - A good fall beer, as metioned previously, not as pumpkin pie forward as I might hope for, but still a solid offering"
"I'd love to have a big mug of this beer to sip on all night. Yum!"
"I would call this a very good introductory pumpkin beer. Their isn't an overwhelming spice or pumpkin flavor, but enough of both to fit into the style. Just not enough of what I personally look for in this style however."
"Taste's like liquid pumpkin pie, distinct spice taste of nutmeg or cinnamon. I look forward to this one each September, my favorite Pumpkin Ale!"
"A very meek and timid pumpkin."
" I feel like your opinion of this beer will largely be determined by how you feel about the vanilla taste. With each sip, I get more and more vanilla, which could be cloying to some but pleasantly reminds me of pumpkin pie and vanilla ice cream."
"Bottle. Light orange in color, the beer sported a tall foamy white head. Just average aroma. There is a very light pumpkin aroma, but little in the way of spices and malt. The taste is interesting at first but does not finish well with a spicy tanic aftertaste. Medium carbonation.I did not like the first bottle I tried. But after three (on different days) I am starting to see what they are trying to do. It is also not my favorite pumpkin beer. But it still good and unique in that it is not overly malty."
"Not bad for a pumpkin beer."
"Meh, it's not bad, but it's not great. Seeing as along with Blue Moon and Shock Top, this was the only pumpkin ale I have been able to find in this town, I will probably get more before the end of the fall... but there are much better examples out there."
"O: Good pumpkin ale, not the best I have had, but highly drinkable. Looking forward to finishing the rest in the 6-pack. Thank you Brooklyn Brewery!"
"Overall: Comes across as a heavily spiced English Pale Ale, so this is probably a more traditional take on the style. Quite tasty."
"Notes: This is only my 2nd Pumpkin Ale, the 1st being Southern Tier's Pumking. What a contrast. While the latter is an in your face pumpkin shotgun blast that obliterates any trace of beer in the glass, Post Road is a pale ale with some spices and pumpkin added. This is drinkable and interesting. I am not sure if Pumpkin Ale will ever be more than a change of pace or novelty for me but Post Road could be a beer that I could have a few of in the fall."
"O: Good fall-time beer. Its pumpkin pie-y, but tastes like beer. I think this beer is the good middle ground between the liquid pumpkin pies and beers which happen to have pumpkin in them. Sessionable, and definitely worth a 6-pack."
"Poured copper in color with some orange highlights. A head fails to develop, but a ring of foam and some surface film cap present a nice-looking brew. The aroma is simple, but aromatic and pleasant. Spicing is faint with Post Road; nutmeg is most present, followed by clove. Toasted malts along with pumpkin give this beer a unique roasted pumpkin seed aroma as well. Taste is malt-forward, with toasty and caramel malts up front. Spicing is again minimal on the palate, but lingers in the finish. Light-medium body with crisp carbonation. Overall subtle and not overdone. It offers something different than a lot of other pumpkin beers out there."
"I love me a good pumpkin beer and this is almost as good as it gets. The appearance isnt anything special, just has a gold color with barely any head. The smell has a lot of pumpkin scent and spices. Now the taste is where it is at. I drink it and just screams pumkpin pie. You get the strong pumpkin taste and spices such as nutmeg. This is a decent pumkpin beer."
"One of the better pumpkin beers and a solid autumn offering."
"That malt flavor tends to stay instead of the spices, which is actually a bad thing."
"Not a bad pumpkin beer but the clove or nutmeg was a little strong."
"The beer has a really nice mix of cinnamon, sugar, and pumpkin and it is not overwhelming at all. I can't imagine anyone being disappointed drinking this on a chilly October evening."
"O- A good, well-rounded pumpkin beer. More spice in the flavor would have bumped this one up quite a bit for me."
"O: One of my favorites of the year, excellent smell that is right on with the taste."
"O: Pretty good. Wish it lived up to the smell. I'll be sticking with Punkin if i feel like a pumpkin beer."
"Not bad, but not great. The flavor profile is much milder in my opinion than other pumpkin's on the market."
"O: I was expecting a bit more out of this one and won't be buying it again."
"O - A pretty good pumpkin beer. My biggest complaint with this one is you don't really taste the pumpkin. Still looking for that perfect pumpkin beer."
"Tastes: like beer."
"O- Not a bad pumpkin ale. The spices aren't overwhelming, which is a plus, but that doesn't leave a ton left, either."
"Light to medium body with light carbonation. Nothing too special but still a nice balanced pumpkin ale all around."
"O- If taste followed nose more, this beer would rock. Its still decent, but I loooove pumpkin bombs when it comes to be this time of the year. Its also a bit too light for my liking. May revisit, but with Schlafly in my market it may not be anytime soon-I love this season for beer!"
"O - I love this. And I expect nothing but that from Brooklyn. I'm going to have to get a few more of these. A great start to the fall beer season."
"O: Nice pumpkin ale. Not too over the top like others. Balanced in flavor."
"Overall not a bad pumpkin beer, but not really a good one either. Pretty standard fare that you could probably drink a few of and you would get bored, so you move on."
"This is by far one of the best fall beers I have ever had. This is one that I am going to drink every fall forever. Pumpkin ale lovers beware, your beer has arrived."
"This is my """go to""" pumpkin beer. Overall this is a great beer when comparing to similar sessionable type pumpkin beers. Nose smells like Autumn. Lots of spices, nutmeg and of course, pumpkin. In the taste, the pumpkin is more profound. A natural dry style of pumpkin taste, not the artificial flavoring style. Pours cloudy orange color. Small white head. Lighter side of medium in the mouthfeel. In comparison with other pumpkin beers, this one takes the win in my opinion. I can name a number of other breweries that try and make pumpkin beers, but either the flavor or the mouthfeel just isn't right."
"This pours an amber / orangish color this pours a white head. The smells of pumpkin and spices, some nutmeg and cinnamon. Feel is medium to light. Taste is a little bitter (hops or pumpkin?), I also get some pumpkin and the spices. This is only my third pumpkin beer and I guess the bitter afterflavor is in many of them, I'll probably come back and reevaluate this after I have a different ones for comparison sake. Anyways, not bad, different than expected, something I'll try again."
"Overall: A pretty good pumpkin ale that is worth the try."
"Recommended as a solid pumpkin beer"
"Not a bad take on a pumpkin beer, I enjoyed it, but as with pretty much all pumpkin beers, I only need one in a night."
"Pours a clear pumpkin orange color with a 2 inch off-white head that fades to a film on the top of the beer. Thin foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, actual pumpkin, and pumpkin pie spices - especially cinnamon and clove. Taste is of malt and pumpkin pie mixed together. A very nice blend of beer and pumpkin pie flavors. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a nice crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good pumpkin ale from Brooklyn with a very nice balance of flavors. I am glad I was able to try one of these."
"O: Interesting flavor. My first pumpkin ale was tasty and I would have another."
"Overall - It’s a good fall beer, with good balances. Not too strong and overwhelming, but also refreshing. It’s an easy drinking enjoyable, crisp pumpkin ale."
"This one started out great but really lets you down in the end. By the way, has anyone looked at that photo? Is that the inside leg of someone's jeans?"
"This might be a good contender for a very drinkable spice beer - othing heavy but well balanced and tastey - but it is not pumpkiny enough."
"Overall - It was decent. It's mostly just some pumpkin that never really makes its way to the forefront. The most pleasant part of the taste was the aftertaste, actually. It wasn't bad, but not great, either."
"Overall it was ok. Very drinkable and light. A nice light amber with some spice and pumpkin in the back. Overall it was poorly balanced. Too watery and too hoppy in comparision to others of the same style."
"O- A little too much nutmeg for me to get this again and not a ton of body on this beer."
"This is an easy drinking """sessionable""" pumpkin beer. I'm glad I picked it up at $8/sixer. The biggest reason that it doesn't rate higher is the thin mouthfeel. I would also like a bigger blast of flavor. It's probably a bit underrated, but Hoppin' Frog's Double Hollow Pumpkin is similar, yet better."
"O - This beer has taught me that you can't expect all pumpkin ales to carry the characteristics of pumpkin pie, bread etc. This beer really focuses on the pumpkin itself without any help from spices to add on to anything. It's a rather robust brew, but for the pumpkin to be the lone contributor to the overall taste and aroma makes for a real stand out beer. Worth a shot, then another!"
"O: This is definitely on the lighter end of the Pumpkin Ales. Easy drinking, crisp and bitter. The spices tend to outweigh the overall beer with the cinnamon forward."
"Overall: This beer smells great, but otherwise does not have a lot going for it. I'll have to revisit later in the season."
"Nothing overly Spectacular but a very solid Pumpkin Ale. Glad I bought it. I'll probably spend the rest of the season trying other pumpkins/octoberfests but I recommend picking up a 6er of this. This would be a good beer to introduce non beer geeks to the world of good beer."
"I didn't pour from the bottle, didn't think it be worth it I thought with its age it would be one sip and drain, but I was wrong. It was downright delightful. Tasted like pumpkin pie, more than just the spices but the actual pumpkin too, nice and full bodied, between the spices the pumpkin and the distinct breadiness it was awesome."
"I wish pumpkin ales weren't relegated to a fall seasonal because this is a great, refreshing and flavourful brew that would appeal to ginger beer and American IPA fans."
"This pumpkin ale pours out on the brown colored side. The head is white. It look appealing . The aroma is a little spicy nothing to intense. The taste kind of follows that trend. There is a spicy quality to the taste which isn't too bad but I think it lacks on the actual pumpkin flavors a little bit. The mouthfeel of this beer isn't too bad. It's pretty decent, It's not my favorite pumpkin ale but still worthy of trying."
"A more subdued pumpkin beer then others I've tried."
"O: Drinkability is good for the season, as I tend to become tired of pumpkin ales outside of that two-month period in the fall. Could easily drink a couple of these in a session, if going for that."
"picked up this at a wine/beer specialty store in montclair nj. a bit overpriced at 12 bucks for a 6 pack. but very good tasting not filling and not too much of an aftertaste. not a thick beer with a real bitter taste that i thought it would have. goes down pretty good. hope i could find this on tap."
"I look forward to the LCBO carrying more Brooklyn brewerey beers!"
"Drinkability - i enjoyed this beer, but it is no """KING""". decent beer that i would sample and share again."
"This is a consistently good pumpkin beer. As far as a """normal," pumpkin ale, this is one of my favorites. While it is not as exciting as something like (imperial) Pumking, it is tasty and very drinkable."
"D- Seeing as this is more than a few months after this was released and is lower in ABV, I don't really know what to say. Not bad but was probably better when it was fresh. The pumpkin flavor has probably evolved or devolved if you will, into something different."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into dimpled glass. Pours a nice, amber color with a good sized foamy head that leaves moderate lacing. Nice aroma of pumpkin and nutmeg, but overall slightly faint. Taste is a little off. There is some pumpkin character up front with a little spice, but it quickly disappears into a pale-lager type aftertaste with a bit of sourness. A pretty good pumpkin beer overall in a tough category."
"Overall impression: Better than some pumpkin offerings, but the search continues for one that's not just a decent amber with entirely too many spices."
"D: Can you say """Thanksgiving beer?""" I'd love to pair this with some holiday favorites of mine..."
"D: Overall, I'd like to say that Post Road Pumpkin Ale is an average pumpkin beer but it was my least favorite of 2010. So with that rationale in mind, I'm inclined to say that it is well below average."
"The beer has a nice dark orange color body with a little bit of white head to it. The smell is very nice of nutmeg and pumpkin and a hint of cinnamon. It taste really nice of pumpkin and then the spices come a little bit after. i think it has a nice smooth mouth feel and is very drinkable."
"Pours a semi dark, clear orange colour with a good amount of head in the Sam Adams perfect pint glass. Tastes of pumpkin spices with a finish of pumpkin pie and cinnamon. I was expecting this to be tougher to drink with the average or worse reviews I have read on this beer. But its not overpowered with spice as people have said in previous posts. Its quite drinkable."
"I'm going to have to go against the grain on this one, it's just too vegetal for my tastes. Nothing against Brooklyn, but I'd take ST's Pumking any day over this. Maybe I'll revisit this down the road, but for now I'll stick to their Lager."
"Drinkability is good. These are easy drinking, sessionable pumpkin ales."
"D - Not a bad brew but not at the top of my list. Maybe I am just not a big pumpkin ale guy."
"To be honest, this was hard to get through. Not my least favorite pumpkin brew of the year, but certainly not among the better ones either. Too imbalanced and spice-heavy to really get going. A bit surprising considering Brooklyn's brewing pedigree."
"Drink - Probably my favorite pumpkin beer so far this season - I'll pick up a few more for sure."
"Pours a clear tawny orange with a rather unimpressive soapy white head. Picking up some spice and hints of pumpkin in the nose, as well as some floral hops. The taste follows the nice with pumpkin and spice, which accent a base of caramel and bready malt. Not picking up any hops in the taste. The finish is crisp, a touch of lingering ginger spice, and on the malty side but no cloying sweetness. Light to medium-bodied, moderately carbonated. I found this to be a pretty good pumpkin ale; the spices weren't overpowering, but I would've preferred a bit more hops to balance it out."
"I tried five pumpkin beers this season and this one placed fourth or fifth. I don't think I'll bother with it next year."
"D - Good. At 5% abv this beer is definitely among the more sessionable pumpkin ales."
"O: Good beer on flavor, but on feel and drinkability it loses some points with me. I had it on tap at a local restaurant, and I believe it was better there, but I won't go on memory, just what I tasted here."
"It's an approachable pumpkin beer with strong malt characteristics and hints of pumpkin and spice. It was not enjoyable for me as I found the malt characteristics imbalanced. When I drink a pumpkin ale I want it to slap me in the face. With Post Road I find myself searching for the pumpkin and forgetting about the spice."
"This is a really solid pumpkin ale. My third favorite after Pumking and DFH."
"Pours a copper orange colour with a finger of white head that dissipates to almost nothing fairly quickly. Mild spots of lacing around some of the glass. Smells of cinnamon, clove, allspice and nutmeg. I don't get any pumpkin really in the smell, but more of the spices associated with pumpkin pie. Flavour is quite spicy, but not as sweet as expected. Interesting flavour in that it is more on the spicing, but not either pumpkin or pumpkin pie (not sweet enough). Body is a bit thin. Just an ok pumpkin beer."
"(D)- Started out great, but is really lacking in the flavor department in my opinion."
"Enjoyable pumpkin ale and I could actually drink more than one of these in a sitting. Another delicious beer from Brooklyn"
"Overall, this is a mediocre pumpkin beer. Overall there are much better of the style, pass if you have other options."
"The ale pours a hazy copper with a white head the some retention. The smell has a faint but hop and malt scent but it overwhelmingly smells from pumpkin pie spices nutmeg, corriander, clove, all-spice, and brown sugar. The taste is of the pumpkin spices, sugar, and the pumpkin flavor at the end. This beer is inbetween the flavors and styling of Dogfish Head's Punkin and Southern Tier's Pumking."
"D - Good all-around pumpkin ale, although it's a tad too carbonated perhaps. Still, it's slightly above average in the echelon of pumpkin ales."
"The taste of Post Road Pumpkin is subdued, while there is pumpkin, spice, & sweetness all present. It is still an ale at the core and not overdone in its flavor profile with too much of anything. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, decent carbonation. This is one pumpkin ale, that one could drink a couple of, it very much has a more relaxed character."
"d - can drink a good amount of these.. if my palate agrees with the spicy aftertaste for that day.. def. a fun beer to drink for the season and with good home cooked meal (turkey dinner perhaps)"
"There isn't anything bad about this beer, but it just isn't what I look for in a pumpkin beer."
"Pours a moderate brownish color with a tad bit of a light head. Nose brings a good dose of spice and a few hints of pumpkin. Taste is mostly spice with a bit of sugar and pumpkin. Light to medium body. Not one of the more extreme pumpkin beers that I have had, but doesn't quite hit the level of some of he better versions."
"This is easily the highest rating I've given to a BB beer yet, so maybe now I can finally be called a homer."
"D - Very drinkable in my opinion."
"MD-This one grew on me. I'm not a fan of beer and cinnamon together but Brooklyn pulled it off."
"Pours a dark amber/orange with a quickly disappearing pearl head. Nice looking despite the lack of head. Pumpkin spice aroma, decent blend of scents. Nice pumpkin flavor. Sweet vanilla and pumpkin up front, followed by the typical pumpkin spices. Brown sugar, cinnamon and all spice stand out. A bit of hops on the end as well. Creamy and well carbonated mouthfeel and pretty drinkable."
"Very pleasant creamy and spicy mouthfeel with just the right amount of carbonation. It would be conceivable to drink a couple of these on a nice autumn eve!"
"Had no clue what to expect from this one. Pours an amber colour with a creamy thin head. Smell is faint, but definitely has notes of cinnamon, clove, and what I think is malt. The taste is where this gets a little odd... it actually tastes more like pumpkins than spices, which is the opposite of most pumpkin ales I've tried. It was a pleasant surprise, as I was bracing for the nutmeg kick most of these ales have. Creamy mouthfeel with a smooth finish. This is very easy to drink, almost too easy, bordering on being watery. As others have stated, this beer is a lot nicer when it's allowed to warm up a bit. It mellows and more of the overall flavour emerges. Don't drink it chilled, it only amplifies the watery quality. My distributor didn't keep these in the fridge, I should have followed suit but put it away when I got home. Just let it be!"
"Mouthfeel was fine, and the drinkability form a texteure point of view was there, it just didn't taste much of beer."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and drinkable. There is nothing that really keeps me craving more but I can easily drink a few at a time."
"Out of the bottle it has a less than good color, more of a yellow amber colored clear body with a an ecru head of 1 and half fingers. Smells overly spicy with small hints of pumpkin. Cinnamon and clove on the nose and tongue with very strong CO2 bite which I found unpleasant. But shit, I bought a six pack and I'm gonna drink a six pack."
"I think this may have been my first pumpkin beer but it was better that I expected the style to be."
" I find i prefer a much fuller body in my pumpkin ales with less spice and more pumpkin."
"drinkability: had this at a local restaurant where i usually switch up, but stayed with this. Tasty."
"D - Surprisingly smooth for the level of spiciness"
"D. It's kind of like a mix between a pumpkin and an octoberfest - good, but not great."
"D - Maybe not my favorite pumpkin brew, but it's not altogether too bad at all. I'll revisit this one again next year."
"A nice light pumpkin ale with a smooth finish. Would recommend"
"D= if you like it I'm sure you can down a 6 easily. I'd prefer to find more pumpkin, maybe more spice and less watery overall."
"D - Not a bad beer, though would not be my first choice for a pumpkin ale (or a fall beer in general, for that matter). Not memorable comapred to some of the other pumpkin ales."
"Pours burnt orange color. Nice large head, dissipates quickly to bout one finger. Cinnamon, apples, some citrus, lots of spice and of course pumpkin in the aroma. Warm, crisp fall like flavor upfront. Not as much pumpkin in the taste as some others, nice spices, cinnamon and still some citrus. Nice ale thickness to the body with a smooth finish. Overall a good ale, not quite the """pumpkin""" ale that I was expecting, but a good one to try."
"Pours an almost orange color, nice and clear, head retention ok. Not crazy about the smell - kinda medicinal, sharp, and green. Taste starts off bitter, but then rounds out somewhat. The finish is spicy, and drinkability is decent. An alright beer, but the flavors didn't gel like I wanted them to. Too bitter and not enough pumpkin flavor. I seem to say that about most pumpkin ales.. need to find a good one."
"Overall, a mediocre pumpkin beer. This isn't my favorite style to begin with because they seem to appeal to people who don't like actual beer but really just want pumpkin pie flavored wine coolers and this is one of those. I wouldn't bother with this one, honestly."
"I'll actually buy a six-pack of this, if that tells you how I feel about it's drinkability. Big fan of high ABV pumpkin ales, but this is an exceptional low octane example."
"D - This is a pretty good pumpkin ale. Nothing too outside the normal, but that isn't a bad thing. Glad I had the chance to try this."
"D - Very drinkable and refreshing but probably couldn't drink a 6 pack as it would probably ruin your palate with the spices and become a little much."
"D: more then I thought with the lack of massive pumpkin and spice, but this was rather pleaset beer"
"i should have waited for the carbonation to mellow, but no beer should taste that much like pure tonic. light so you think it would be easy to drink, but the carbonation is difficult to accept"
"All in all, a nice pumpkin ale that could use a little more pumpkin."
"glad I only bought one and not a sixer."
"Overall it's not a bad beer but it's missing something that keeps it from being better than average. I think this would be a good beer for somebody who """sorta likes""" pumpkin ales."
"D- Easy to drink. Nice and smooth, full bodied, fall classic pumpkin ale."
"exception. Definitely a poor example of the style."
"Good, some interesting & unique things going on here. The spice character is rich without being overly sweet. Rich enough, though, to make one enjoy & stop after that."
"a great pumpkin ale. worth seeking out."
"D: This is a pumpkin ale for beer lovers. My wife, who does not care for beer, and loves a lot of the big, thick pumpkin ales (ex. Pumking, Shlafly, Punkin', etc.), would definitely not like this one. Post Road is almost a faint echo of one of those giant pumpkin ales, but still very recognizable as a drinkable, pilsner-esque, session beer."
"As far as Pumpkin Ales go, this one is closer to the bottom for me. Its got pumpkin and spice, but other brewers use both in a much better fashion. Post Road is middle of the road."
"Only the 2nd of a series of pumpkin beers I've ever tried, I found this largely indistinguishable from the first sample but just a little less impactful in every category. Frankly I only drank about half of it before I drain poured. This style just isn't my thing. I think the spices overwhelm any of the other standard flavors or experiences you expect from your beer, and in this particular case even though they less overwhelm it (because it isn't as flavorful as others) it just reveals a fairly lame beer at the base of the creation. Sorry, but I've got to be honest."
"I love everything brewed by this company so my review may be partial, but this is a great ale that I could drink in March as easily as October."
"Serving type: bottle"
"extremely drinkable for autumn, too bad its still in the low 90's here. i actually look forward to the chilly weather drinking this."
"D- a nice pumpkin ale. Not the best, but not bad at all"
"I was kind of let down by this one. It smelled great but the taste really disappointed. Not enough pumpkin and the beer flavor was pretty bland. There are other pumpkin ales I'd drink before this one for sure. I doubt I'll revisit it."
"This is a drinkable pumpkin ale. It would go great with pumpkin pie or vanilla ice cream."
"Hard to drink a bunch of these...had one in the car ride home then one in my chimay goblet....smell and taste could be better....won't buy it again, but if a bud has some in the fridge one day I'll nab one."
"D-flavors stay but it seems to get more watery as it goes down, its not a session beer or a sipper, its just something you want to be over with."
"Not an in your face pumpkin beer by anymeans. Very drinkable and simple. One of the better pumpkin beers out there."
"D: Certainly not the best pumpkin ale I've had, perhaps if the taste was as strong as the nose this would be a better beer. Overall this is a decent pumpkin but I will be sticking the others in the future."
"The mouthfeel is on the lighter side with carbonation being moderate. Drinkability is pretty decent, it wa a lighter and easy drinking beer. It was a lot milder of the spices then a lot of others which was nice. It wasn't anything extraordinary, but it was a pretty easy drinking beer for the style."
"Drinkability is fairly decent as well. Easy enough to quaff on a cool fall day. Bit light on flavor and feel, but it's by no means a bad pumpkin ale. I've just had better."
"D- Due to heavy mouthfeel and high spice character it's a one and done at a time deal with this pumpkin brew."
"d - An ok pumpkin beer but with so many others out there, not one I would get again. Some nice spice and pumpkin in the smell but the taste wasn't that great."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Very good carbonation and not too heavy as far as this style goes. This was on the lighter end of beers. Very flavorful but nothing to overpower."
"D - There are few pumpkin ales that I truly enjoy, and even fewer that I will follow up with a second round. This one if definitely going to be a repeat, especially when it gets a little colder outside."
"This beer smells amazing, which only serves to highlight the disappointing lack of flavor."
"D/M: Lighter than expected. Overall its ok, I have had better pumpkin beers, and will probably opt for those in the future."
"D - You could certainly consume multiple is a session, but I'm not sure you would want to..."
"D - Very drinkable. A nice pumpkin by Brooklyn."
"Amber brown with thinnish head that is retained well with a bit of lacing. Spicy, pumpkin pie aromas, cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, all spice etc. Not much pumpkin. Spicy flavor, pumpkin comes through a bit more but is still subdued compared to the spices. Not bad, but it is a bit diluted with a thin, somewhat watery mouthfeel. Needed a bit more body and sweetness I think."
"D: The beer was alright, but I've had better ones before from this style."
"Drinkability: This is exactly what a pumpkin ale should be- pumpkin pie in a bottle. I have only had two pumpkin ales before, one by Coors and one from AB (Michelob), which I did enjoy, but this one is obviously more flavorful and very enjoyable. It isn't fall yet, but when autumn hits I will be sure to have some of this available in the fridge."
"Pours a clear light copper with a nice tan head that lasts for a minute or two. Enticing aromas of pumpkin (naturally) and spices like nutmeg and cloves. What I like about this beer is that its spicy pumpkin notes can easily be tasted but doesn't crowd out the biscuity malt flavor, light brown sugar sweetness, and earthy bitterness like so many of the lesser beers of this style. With Post Road, the pumpkin features most prominently on the nose and the finish. Overall, this is probably my favorite of the six-packable pumpkin ales, and is one (along with a selection of Oktoberfests) that for the past few years I've kept on hand for entertaining fall guests."
"Poured into a DFH pint glass. One finger head that was quite short-lived but did retain a slight to decent amount of lacing. Deep copper/amber/orange coloration. Smell is maltly mixed with allspice, a bit of nutmeg, pumpkin and slight hint of cinnamon and clove. Taste was very similar to the smell profile with the malt and spices being the most prominent. Pumpkin taste lingers behind. Mouthfeel was fairly carbonated up front but mellowed out rather quickly. Carbonation worked well with the medium body and slight creaminess. Because of that, I would consider it quite sessionable."
"Into a pint glass, it poured orange-amber with one finger of white head, lackluster retention, modest lacing, and decent amount of carbonation. The nose was very biscuity, malty, and of course not without pumpkin and cinnamon. The taste was nice malty/caramel/pumpkin/spice blend, with the latter not overpowering at all, and blending very well in with the maltiness. The finish also revealed a herbal hoppy presence non-existent in the nose. More carbonated in the feel than it had initially appeared; medium-bodied. Not a huge fan of the style, but this specimen is fairly well done. Not unsessionable."
"I tried this beer on November 19, 2008 at """Smokeless Joe's""" in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The beer poured a translucent orange-red with a very thin very short-lived white head. The aroma is malty with pumpkin and spicy notes (cloves and nutmeg). The mouthfeel was medium bodied with above average carbonation. The flavour was primarily malty with some definite spiciness and a hop-laden finish. Better than the Great Lakes Pumpkin ale in my opinion."
"D. A truly easy drinking beer that is/would be a real treat to drink on an autumn or winter dayand/ or evening. I have never had pumpkin before but the spicy flavours I can detect in this beer make it a winner for me."
" A decent enough pumpkin ale but I think a tad over-hyped"
"Overall - Too much clove and cinnamon. Nearly no nuttiness and hardly any discernible pumpkin."
"I love love love pumpkin beers. Some are better than others, and some are way better than others. This one is one of the others. I put it in my kegerator last October like I always like to. You almost have to search for the pumpkin flavor. Other than not being as good as i was hoping, it's a good beer to drink. I will be trying other pumpkin beers in the future though."
"Pours dark orange with a white head. The aroma is that of pumpkin pie spices, with nutmeg and allspice standing out. The flavor is heavy on the nutmeg with only a little bit of pumpkin flavor. Medium mouthfeel and low carbonation. Not as good as some pumpkin ales, but not bad overall."
"Notes: Really good pumpkin ale that really does remind me of autumn. A lot like a pumpkin pie."
"D - This is a nice beer, but it seems to be lacking in the pumpkin flavor department. It tends to feature the spices a bit more, but that works for my tastes. Worth trying, but not a standout in the crowded field of fall beers."
"Medium bodied with a nice balance of autumnal spices, pumpkin and earthy hops. Lots of brown sugar and cinnamon as well as some clove, ginger and nutmeg complimenting the sweet pumpkin flavor. I'm also picking up some slight sweet citrus notes mid palate that linger into a dry finish."
"For presentation, I poured this into a Flying Fish Pint glass. Appearance is copper-pumpkin coloured with good head retention and some lacing. The smell and taste indicate a lot of clove, pumpkin, cinnamon, with a little bit of bready malts. Mouthfeel is light to medium, and this is a sessionable beer. Overall, a great value for the beer."
"The mouthfeel is typical with some smoothness and reasonable lingering carbonation. It is a very drinkable ale."
"D: Low ABV wonderful flavors... You could drink quite a few of these...Very drinkable brew."
"Drinkability: one of the better pumpkin ales, definitely an enjoyable seasonal without being over-the-top."
"D - Very good. Properly spiced, I can drink a few with out getting played out on the flavor."
"Clear, slightly light amber in color. The head on mine was quite fleeting. The smell was great...just like pumpkin pie. Pumpkin pie, however, is something I'd rather smell than eat. Taste just doesn't do it for me. Allspice, cinnamon, coriander in both smell and taste. Also seems a bit watered down. I can't really taste much beer here. This one's not for me."
"Pours a clear, orange/amber color. 1/3 inch head of an off-white color. Good retention and good lacing. Smells of spice (ginger, all spice, cinnamon), yeast, and very slight hop. Fits the style of a Pumpkin Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of yeast up front, spice (better aroma than taste), and pale malt. Overall, a great aroma but body falls a little flat."
"The strong spice flavor might make it hard to drink more than one, but if this style of beer pleases then give this one a try."
"a spicy pumpkin offering, Poured a light orange and very clear. Doesn't compare to some other Pumpkin Ales. Small head and spotty lacing. Taste is spicy. Decent but again, kind of watered down compared to other pumpkin ales. Can do much better when buying a pumpkin ale."
"Cheers!"
"Nice, fairly easy drinking pumpkin brew."
"Drinkability: I am a fan of pumpkin ales, though not when they are too sweet. This beer provides a nice edge to the sweetness. While I don't know if I would drink two of these in a sitting, I might."
"Pours clear deep amber with nice fluffy head. Aroma is strongly spicy, cinnamon, clove, ginger. Flavor is sharply malty, with a sharp, long spice burn. Flavorful. Mouthfeel is a bit clingy, highlighting the burn."
"Drinkability is not bad. It goes down easy and would make a decent session beer but all in all I think there are better examples of the style available."
"M/D - Thin body is fine for the style but a little watery at times. Easy to drink at a reasonable ABV. Not my favorite in the style, I still haven't found one but worth picking some up to enjoy on a cold day."
"D: Especially drinkable for a pumpkin ale. The flavor is understated, and you can actually tell this is an ale instead of liquid pumpkin pie. The nose makes you think this will be all pie taste, but that's not the case."
"D- Pumpkin ales are a rarity in a my drinking line-up but this one shows up more often than most."
"D Really quite good with manageable ABV%, light feel but there are simply better options out there. 4.0"
"Notes - I had high hopes from the smell, but the crispness masks the spices and prevents it from standing out as a pumpkin ale. A solid beer, but maybe not the best choice if you want a lot of pumpkin in your beer. However, if you want to session a pumpkin ale, this would be a good one."
"Mouthfeel on this one is all right...it's drinkable, for sure...actually, this is one pumpkin beer that would be easy to drink for an evening...not too strong, but relatively flavorful...slightly chalky fell, but a beer that has some merit."
"Poured 12oz into a Southapton Publick House glass. Color is Orange like a pumpkin! Nice retaining head with lots of lace. Smell is sweet with nutmeg, cinnamon, and pumpkin pie. Taste seems a little off. It has a metallic character to it that kinda sucks. As it warms, I get a little more pumpkin and malt. Its pretty well balanced for the style but not as good as I had hoped. Light bodied, easy drinker if you can stand more than one."
"D - not doing a whole lot for me, wish it was """bigger""""
"Color is a rich amber. Pours with a thin head which dissipates quickly. Smell is spicy and perhaps a little floral. Taste is sturdy and pumpkiney, but not overwhelmingly so. The pumpkin and spices are well balanced and integrated. Beer is pleasantly bitter and not sweet or heavy as some pumpkin ales can be. Good, dry mouthfeel and very good drinkability. All in all very good pumpkin ale."
"This beer has a great pumpkin spice flavor, it just needs some more malt sweetness and body."
"Nice reddish/orange hue with moderate head. Smells of allspice, nutmeg, and some pumpkin. Taste is not impressive - horrible aftertaste. Nice pumpkin up front and a little sweet, but finishes with very unpleasant nutmeg bitterness. Moderate density mouthfeel, highly carbonated. Not very drinkable. Don't know if I will ever finish the six pack. Sorry, Brooklyn. Usually love your stuff, but will avoid this one at all costs in the future."
"Bottle from my mom-Pours deep amber with red hues. Head is beige and frothy. Spicy aroma (cinnamon, nutmeg) pumpkin pie, lots of cookie dough, burnt malts. Sweet and spicy flavour profile consists of a lot of pumpkin pie, burnt brown sugar, biscuit, sweet malts, some bittering hops. Very creamy, with a good lingering aftertaste. Good."
"Drinkability: I bought this six pack for my wife. She wanted ST Pumpking and was almost pissed when I couldnt find any. This was a reasonable substitution. I drank 3 of them. Its decent beer. Not too pumpkiny or sweet."
"A curious, savoury ale to have every once in a while, not quite schizophrenic, however to me it can't quite decide where it wants to end up flavourwise. As much as I love my hops they don't seem to be adding much benefit to the overall experience."
"Very easy drinking, and new-user friendly. This is the one that started the whole pumpkin craze, and it is a nice entry level offering to the category."
"body is medium and beer is nicely drinkable, not over spiced like a lot of these beers. It is missing hop character though, I only get spice. That said it is still a well made beer and if I had to drink pumpkin this would be on the short list."
"I've heard a lot about this beer, so I finally decided to try it. Pours a copper color with two fingers of head that faded with chunky lacing. The aroma is overwhelmingly pumpkin and nutmeg, like a pumpkin pie, but also with hints of caramel malt. The taste alternates between the malt's flavor and pumpkin, then fades into some slightly harsh bitterness and crispness from the carbonation, but with the pumpkin taste always in the background. Medium bodied with a strange, lingering aftertaste. Definitely not terrible, as long as you like pumpkin pie, but I don't think I could drink more than 2."
"A decent pumpkin ale. Aroma was very good, as usual for most pumpkin beers, the taste does not meet expectations. Still fairly solid overall, very sessionable, if possible. Mouthfeel a little thin, i was hoping for some creaminess."
"A middle of the road pumpkin ale really..."
"D - Only 5% ABV and very light so this one goes down like an eager college girl after a frat party."
"Beer is okay but not a really big on this in anyway."
"drinkability: decent beer but an below avergae pumpkin beer. not horriebl just had better."
"D: A decent pumpkin ale. I'd definitely buy it again, and probably would bring it to a halloween party as a nice conversation starter/themed kinda thing."
"As with many pumpkin beers, good color, smell and mouthfeel but the flavor is a little too spicey. A better than average one to have if your dying for that type of thing."
"D: Low ABV and lighter body than some other pumpkinds make this one pretty drinkable, if you like (or are not bothered by) the """fake""" spice taste."
"This is your typical low carbonation, spicy pumpkin beer, that is a bit watery, not that interesting, has some pumpkin notes throughout, but tastes like a rather bland, pretty flat, mediocre amber ale with pumkin added and mostly spices in the allspice family. Ho Hum."
"Drinkability: I wanted to enjoy this ale, I really did. But this goes the way of the summer ale. In the end of the day this is just a overzealously bitter english pale with a few pumpkin pie notes. I'll stick to Punkin ale by DFH, for my fall beer kick."
"This is a solid brew and, while there's not as much pumpkin as I'd hope for, it's there. It's a good brew all-around anyway."
"12oz bottle purchased at Tully's in Well's. Pours a crystal-clear golden-amber body with a thin quickly dissipating off-white head. Smells spicy sweet, like a pumpkin pie - definitely cinnamon and cloves. Tastes like cinnamon, clove, allspice, with a touch of pumpkin and caramel. Medium to light in body with ample carbonation. Very tasty and quaffable. A pretty solid pumpkin ale overall, among the better examples I've tried."
"Drinkability- this beer is not bad in anyway but the flavor is very unique, I am not sure how many of these I could really consume in a session, probably only one or two max, hmm well what does save it on the drinkability a bit is the fact that the hops or spice really keep the beer from gettin to sweet and rather balanced on that front, I can appreciate that this is a well crafted beer but pumpkin ales are a style that may take me some getting use to before I could really appreciate them fully,"
"Drinkability is average at best. I would drink one if offered, but this is nothing I would spend my money on in the future. Being that this pumpkin ale had very little in the way of a pumpkin flavor, I'm going to have to keep looking for one that impresses me."
"Slightly orange, mostly gold in color. Thin white head, little lacing. Smell is of mild spices, not much else. Taste is a thin profile of pumpkin pie spices with very little pumpkin. Almost a lager like bite distracts from what little taste is there. Slightly creamy, mild carbonation. Not one of my favorite pumpkin beers."
"D- An alright beer. It drinks fine, but there are much better pumpkin beers out there."
"D - This could be a great session Pumpkin Ale, but something on the mouthfeel is not quite right, still, this is much better than Harvest """no pumpkin in sight""" Moon"
"Would I buy more of it? Yes, without a doubt."
"Basically you can think of this beer as a british style pale ale with a blast of pumpkin spice. I liked this beer quite a bit."
"This is a fair bit different than the local pumpkin ale versions that I've thus far sampled - there is very little sweetness, so the resemblance to pumpkin pie is certainly lessened. That said, the overall dryness makes this a much better candidate for a session of waiting in that damp and dank patch for the Great Eponymous One."
"D: Because of the fruity taste was minimal, although fruity isn't generally an issue with pumpkin ales, drinkability is good."
"d- good drinkability, i'd have this pumpkin ale again for sure, for me pumpkin beers aren't sessionable because of all the spice but i could have two of these, yet another good offering from brooklyn."
"D: Great drinkability all-around. The only thing that has my head scratching while drinking this brew is the resemblance of Saranacs version. Which we all know Brooklyn Brewery is outsourcing this beer to. Other than that fact, one good pumpkin ale that makes me feel warm inside on cold fall nights. Its all an illusion either way..."
"Notes: This is a solid Pumpkin ale with just enough balance for my taste."
"Interesting enough that I might buy another sixer before the winter hits."
"D - Reasonably drinkable for a pumpkin ale, but the spices are a bit cloying. Not bad, but I am in no hurry to have another."
"D-This is one heck of a drinkable pumpkin ale. Sure, Weyerbacher Imperial is a better example, but you can drink this all night at 5.0 AVB. I'll call this the seasonal sessioner for the fall."
"This was my first full pumpkin beer. Taste was very sweet up front, especially the first few sips. After it set into my palate, though, there was a good amount of balance. It's obviously going to be on the malty side of things, but this one had some decent bitter backbone that allowed the pumpkin, cinnamon, and others spices to pronounce themselves. Mouthfeel was a little under medium, and the drinkability is pretty high, as well. I'm not sure I'd knock back a ton of these in a night, but I could definitely do an evening sample of the pumpkin ale style, and if I did that, I'd make sure Post Road Pumpkin was on my list."
"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle with the marking: BEST BEFORE FEB 2010. Sampled on September 26, 2009. The pour is an rich orange-copper with excitable carbonation and about an inch of puffy, white head. The aroma is mild but full of pumpkin spice, nutmeg, and fresh hops. The mouthfeel is carbonated and average. Pumpkin spices and hops in the taste with a little graininess and a lingering but pleasing hopped aftertaste. A nice fall seasonal and easy to drink."
"D: My favorite pumpkin ale I've ever had to date. This would be perfect to pair with an Oktoberfest beer for the contrast. As far as pumpkin ales are concerned this is an A."
"Drinkability: One of the more drinkable pumpkin ales simply because nothing really stands out. Hints of pumpkin, hints of spice, a subtle sweetness all around. I could drink more than one of these in a night, but I wouldn't be in any kind of hurry."
"Overall can't say I would drink it again because it is way to overpowering on the spices, but I think everyone should try it in retrospect of other pumpkin beers."
" All in all not a bad brew. The spicing is nice. With other pumpkin ales out there like Pumking and Punkin Ale, I probably won't waste my time with this one again. But check it out if the overwhelming flavor of Pumking is too much for you but you still like a good pumpkin ale!"
"Drinkability: Dangerously drinkable, especially for the style. I like how this has a marzen taste to it. The spicing seems just right and I could have two or three. Brooklyn seems to do seasonal Autumn beers quite well."
"Drinkability is OK, but not something I'd want often. Just too spiced up for for extended drinking."
"drinkability: plain and simple: if you dont like pumpkin or spiced beers stay away from this one. certainly worth a try if you like this sort of thing."
"Appearance is just what you would expect from a pumpkin ale - amber orange. Nice little off-white head that should have hung around a bit longer than it did. Smells like a piece of pumpkin pie - where's the whipped cream? My first impression of taste was, """This is hoppier than most pumpkin ales""" that seem to emphasize malt. A nice counterbalance to the sweetness of malt. I think what some reviewers have referred to as a """spice bite""" is actually the hops breaking through. This is a """dry""" pumpkin ale which is nice and, in my opinion, unique - could drink a few without a problem and will do so, I am sure. Glad I got a case and am looking forward to fall evenings with a glass of this in my hand. Cheers!"
"D - A great offering from Brooklyn that is very, very drinkable. Enjoyable and a find worth searching for."
"D: This is a very good pumpkin ale, and quite drinkable. Not as good as DFH Punkin or Weyerbacher, but still a solid fall seasonal."
"T- It has a very pumpkiny taste, as you would expect, and some nice peppery spiciness to it. Has a kind of citrusy aftertaste. It's certainly got a very bold flavor. Perfect fall beer."
"Nice, clean label. Big-ass pumpkin under """Post Road.""" Smelled spicy--uh oh. Tastes... spicy. I can understand how someone would like this. It tastes like chai tea with a pumpkin aftertaste. The spice bites a bit, and I taste it. I couldn't drink more than 2 or 3 of these. Too spicy--hints of cinnamon, coriander, and strong, strong nutmeg."
"Verdict: Akin to a mild English Pale Ale with a pumpkin pie twist, Post Road Pumpkin Ale is a highly drinkable and tasty holiday brew--one of my favorite examples of the Pumpkin Ale style."
"If you like the subtle sweet and earthy taste of pumpkin, you won't like this beer."
"Very nice: one of the better pumpkin ales out there, because of the very good balance. Not too spicy, but spice is the dominant character. I'd buy it again."
"The mouthfeel is over-carbonated and prickly. Kind of like seltzer water. I would only want one of these at most. Overall, there is some pumpkin flavor, but it is lost by over-carbonation and a strong citrus/sour presence. Not an overly enjoyable brew. There are much better out there. From my tasting tonight, I would recommend both the Wolaver's and DFH over this."
"Mouthfeel would be good except for the tastebud-slaying carbonation. Medium-bodied with a watery finish. Can do better for drinkability. Overall, I've had better pumpkin ales but can appreciate this as some nostalgic version of 18th century seasonal brewing."
"Not a mind-blowing beer but a great all around brew...good for those early fall days."
"Poured a dark amber--nice frothy head that lasted a minute or so..Nose barely of ale, light mouthfeel, hardly a hint of pumpkin or spices. Had an ale aftertaste. Was disappointed that I couldn't detect any flavours of pumpkin or spices, as expected! Just a light beer without spice/pumpkin character."
"This was one of the surprises of the night."
"One of the better pumpkin ales that I feel is out there, in fact one of the only 2 or 3 I evern look forward to each year (along with DFH punk and weyerbacher).. This is nice because it doesn't just taste like some generic ale or lager with pumpkin flavor added nor is it a quite-spicy mix of cinnamon and other spices the way the aforementioned beers are. The pour is a nice light-auburn. Aroma is sort of a light pumpkin essence with spicy autumnal presence. Flavor is very smooth and has a very nice fall character to it. Mouth is full-bodied but light, not like a light beer, though. Overall its very smooth and very nice."
"Drinkability - High. This is a beautifully crafted seasonal that won't overpower anyone who's interested in trying additional flavors in their beer. Brooklyn Brewery really excels by using only top-quality ingredients and caring about the outcome, not just profits."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, slightly filling, mild kick, good representation of style, it's not the kind of beer that I normally drink, but it's ok if you're in the mood for the style."
"light to medium body, good amount of carb. very easy drinking and sessionable. this is usually my go to beer when i go to a party or somethin in the fall time."
"Pours a clear amber color with more than a finger of barely off-white head. Nose is full of festive fall spices: cinnamon and nutmeg dominating with a bit of citrus that may be coriander but it also has something apple-like in the smell as well. Taste is right in line with what it smells like. I can only guess that the number of spices that cling in the aftertaste are partially responsible for the dry finish. Carbination is quite high and the mouthfeel is heavier than I expected. I was thirsty for this style of beer and it accomplished what I wanted, however I don't forsee myself enjoying more than one of these at a time."
"Drinkability: This is probably the second best pumpkin ale that I've sampled thus far - DFH still in the lead. I really do enjoy this one though and appreciate the flavors as it's very fitting for the impending season. The ABV isn't too high and this is a great after dinner kind of beer."
"CHEERS!!"
"Final thoughts: This is a really interesting beer that stretches the boundaries of spices. Typically its way to spicey, but these spices are lighter and full of really tasty rye. I think I'll have to find a good pumpkin spread and slap it on top of rye bread to match this beer. Not overbearing on the pumpkin flavor either. I think I can actually dig this beer. Perhaps I've found a second pumpkin beer I can enjoy (I don't consider Cape Ann pumpkin stout a pumpkin beer since its a stout and its not spiced and tastes great)."
"The mouth is moderately crisp, but there is a slippery quality to it, that isn't the greatest. The flavor is pretty average. I expected more from this due to the smell, but I'm getting just hints of spice. Starts off sweet like a cream soda, but finishes bready and a little dull. This is pretty decent, but not the greatest of the style. I'm still on my search..."
"Drinkability- A particularly well-balanced pumpkin ale. Refreshing and not overpowering."
"Pours a deep clear amber with a thick white head that sticks around leaving solid lacing. A great look to this beer! The aroma is quite malty and bready with some spice character. Not a ton of pumpkin in the aroma, which is unfortunate. The flavor matches well with some cinnamon, all spice and nutmeg. The maltiness comes through well. The mouthfeel is quite creamy with light carbonation. A nice drinking pumpkin that I could enjoy a couple on a cool autumn afternoon watching the leaves fall. Pairs with Bluegrass on Pandora."
"a very drinkable, watered down version of what i believe a pumpkin beer should . appearance is very clear, golden with some ruby redness. small head and spotty lacing. taste is decent but again, kind of watered down compared to other pumpkin ales. maybe a good pumkin ale to introduce a non-craft drinker too."
"Overall, this is a very enjoyable brew to have on a nice autumn-felt night here in PA. A bit sweet to drink all night, but I've had 4 or 5 in a sitting before, so does that qualify? ;)"
"This beer is pretty drinkable, but I'm glad I didn't get the whole 6er and only bought three. It's not overly spiced and well balanced between the malt and pumpkin flavor. I could certainly see myself drinking this on a cool crisp autumn night while watching football."
"D: Really drinkable brew. This is not overdone at all, which was one of my chief concerns going into this brew. This offering is very caseworthy and is a sure crowd pleaser."
"A very drinkable seasonal brew - this type of brew was never my favorite. But this is a very drinkable, solid brew. Very good."
"On the right occasion, I would never hesitate to give this one another try. I'm sure this would be interesting with some foods as well. Honestly, I'm still getting into the pumpkin genre alltogether--but this seemed to have hit the spot. Although, I'd like to try something slightly more poignant next time in regard to the pumpkin theme."
"This beer pours a nice clear amber color, a one finger of white head caps the beer off. Head recedes to a film that is retained throughout. Nice sheets of lacing coat the glass. Nose is faintly of pumpkin, heavy on nutmeg, cinnamon and a touch of ginger. Taste is of pumpkin up front, folowed my dominant spicing of nutmeg and cinnamon, the end has some malt touch to it but an odd medicinal taste. Light to medium body, medium to high carbonation - activity of the carbonation is quite visible, gives almost a seltzer feel to it, slight oily feel on the tongue. This beer gets a bit better as you continue drinking, but there are better of the style out there."
"Just picked up a single bottle of this pumpkin brew. Fresh for Fall '09! Amber-orangish color with very nice lacing. The smell is great but to be honest I haven't come across a pumpkin ale that doesn't smell good. The taste is average and a little watered down in my opinion. Nice fall session brew but if you're seeking a real pumpkin ale, this isn't it."
"VERY drinkable beer even if it isn't as strong a pumpkin ale as I was expecting."
"Pours a golden at the bottom copper at the top color with a big thick fluffy head. No real lacing to be seen. The smell is of pumpkin but it is pretty weak for an aroma. There are also hints of spice. The taste is of pumpkin and nutmeg. A good taste, very pumpkin in taste however, it is slightly watery. The mouthfeel was harsh the first few sips but gave way to a very smooth creamy mouthfeel. The drinkability of this beer is high you can have many of these back to back. Overall a solid pumpkin beer."
"Cheers!"
"A 12 ounce brown bottle poured into a standard shaker """pint""" glass. Appears a clear burnt copper color with about a finger of off white foam. Smells and tastes primarily of pumpkin pie spices such as nutmeg, allspice, cinnamon, clove as well as sweet toasted grains and malt. This pumpkin ale is medium bodied with ample carbonation. One of the better pumpkin ales out there."
"Dark, pumpkin orange with tons of fine suspended yeast visable and a fine cream colored head that leaves nice lace on the glass. Smells of allspice, cinnamon and cloves and pumpkin with some biscuit malt. Tastes better than most of this style because it retains beer flavor to go along with the liquified pumpkin pie flavor. Roasted pumpkin and clove matched with mild finishing hops and biscuity malt. Medium light bodied and effervescent. Not bad drinking if you like pumpkin brew."
"not bad, could use some more flavor. to be fair, it came out last fall but was stored at 33 degrees since February. a nice change of pace though."
"Even being 7-9 months old this stuff was really good. It didn't taste unfresh. I'd love to have it fresh."
"The problem I find with pumpkin ales is that after a while they begin to taste too much like nutmeg. This one does to an extent, but not as much as others I've had. This is one of the better pumpkin ales I have had though. A good effort from Brooklyn Brewery. Paired well with marinated chicken."
"D- I don't know I just can't get into this beer. If ya like beers that brings some holiday flair give it go if not look elsewhere."
"I taste alot of lager-esque sulfur flavors, allspice prickliness and hop and toast bitterness. This one is very low on actual pumpkin flavor. It is not bad, but I expect more from the Brooklyn Brewery."
"Easy to drink and overall my favorite that I tried."
"Tastes like pumpkin pie with some bitterness from the hops, nice smooth malts. This is a very good pumpkin beer."
"And with mild spice, low viscosity and minimal alcohol (5%), this is the best-tasting and most sessionable pumpkin going. Get some!"
"Orange pour with a puffy white head and some excellent lacing, which is exactly the appearance I would expect in this style. Light spice aroma and a touch of pale malt with lots of pumpkin. The taste is not as spicy as I would expect, but I do detect a fair bit of nutmeg and a dose of cinnamon, which helps provide this with a slightly bitter background. The pumpkin is nicely pronounce alongside brown sugar. Medium body and carbonation, leading through to a dry finish."
"As stated, if you like pumpkin pie then you should like pumpkin ales. If you like pumpkin ales then you should like Brooklyn's Post Road Pumpkin Ale. Although it's not likely to take up all the room in your fridge, it should surely at least take up some room at your dinner table, especially around Thanksgiving time."
"D- good warm toasty pumpkin beer with just a little bit of spice in the nose and good fresh pumpkin taste. not too pumpkiny to get annoying."
"Drinkability: So very drinkable. Probably the best pumpkin ale I've ever had, in terms of drinkability. I could easily do a six-pack."
"(rated Oct 9, 2007)"
"Drinkability: Good for this too. Relatively low ABV, spices and balance of flavors are enough to keep you going...and is good for a chilly fall night. Weyerbacher's Imperial Pumpkin Ale is the best of the style I've had. But this one is still solid."
"Light bodied, spice isn't overpowering , and this one's pretty drinkable."
"This is quite a nice pumpkin ale, though a little overspiced for my tastes."
"D: Not the best but not bad either. Worth having."
"D: In the end, this is the most palatable pumpkin beer I've had, but not somthing I'm likely to buy again. This is more of a hoppy clove beer than anything else."
"It take a little bit to get a balance with this beer. The pumpkin spice nose and intial taste are back up with a fairly hoppy ale that comes in after a few sips. Once an equilibrium is maintained the beer drinks well with a Xmas beer type profile(spicy ale)"
"D- Post Road Pumpkin Ale is a solid pumpkin that is worth a shot."
"Overall it is ok, which is my general outlook on most Brooklyn Brewery beers."
"The tide is beginning to rise on this style. It may not be the best, but it's keeping up with other offerings. For now."
"MF&D - A very good example of this style. Worth checking out."
"Pours a clear ruddy orange, light copper colour, medium sized off white head forms, settles down to a thin later, then a thing ring around the glass, very few lace spots. Smell is nice, pumpkin, nutmeg, cinnamon, some clove, caramel, bread, brown sugar, quite spicy but not overdone. Taste is not so hot, very watery, metallic, spices and malt are almost nonexistent, light bit of floral hoppiness near the finish, but otherwise watery and not enjoyable. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium carbonation, kind of rough on the palate, bit medicinal in the finish. Not so good, aroma is nice, but nothing else really goes right with this one."
"Overall-subdued Pumpkin taste for this sort of beer, but with the sweetness and spiciness up front I really enjoyed it. Good beer."
"Drinkability- One of the best pumpkin ales I have ever had, but it doesnt really taste like pumpkin,"
"M/D - Not bad for a pumpkin beer, but not my favorite by far. I either love or hate pumpkin beers and this is on the better side of the style. It has an interesting dryness to it that I wasn't expecting."
"the drinkability is quite good, it's very even and doesn't give your palate too much of a workout with the spicing. this has grown to be one of my favorites this time of year. i would love to try it on tap to see what a slightly different type of carbonation would do to this."
"A good beer overall. The recipe seems solid but the textures are off a little."
"Not the best pumpkin beer, but fairly drinkable."
"D: As with any pumpkin beer, I appreciate the style and like to drink a few in the fall, but can only drink so much in a given session."
"d - first real pumpkin ale, so nothing to really compare to but this seems like a well balanced beer. Not a ton of pumpkin to overwhelm. A little bit lighter then I expected though. not bad."
"D - Standard pumpkin ale... Slightly dryer than most... Solid, but not respectable..."
"D: A decent mouthfeel and taste combination. The spices were a bit strong in the taste and I was hoping for more of the pumpkin taste to balance out the heavy ginger. Ok drinkability overall."
"I'm glad I waited until my second try of this beer to review it becuase it seems like an entirely different beer. Perhaps I let it warm up a bit more and poured it more vigorously because I think this is a pretty good pumpkin beer now but I honestly couldn't finish my first glass of it. It may be that first bottle was a bit off. It won't be my first choice for a pumpkin beer in the future but I wouldn't turn it down either, heck it may even grow on me more."
"D: An easy drinker, but not overly enticing."
"Worth trying"
"Pours a clear light amber with lots of orange hues and a one finger white head made up of little bubbles. Nutmeg, pepper and sweet pumpkin aromas. Flavors of nutmeg, allspice, toasted and carmelized malt, pumpkin, lemony hops, maybe some wheat?. Medium body, medium carbonation this one is a little watery in the mouth. Good drinkability, there is more of a hop profile than in other pumpkin beers I've sampled."
"Color is a clear orangy amber, with a white head that doesn't stick around too long. Aroma is crisp and malty and has hints of pumpkin and cloves. Scrumptuous flavor is malty and spicy and has a real pumpkin undertone - apparently this beer is made with actual pumpkin, so they aren't faking it. Texture is lively and satisfying, and finish is smooth and tasty."
"Orange amber hue with small white head that dissipates quickly. A very amiable aroma of spices, pumpkin pie, cinnamon, and ginger make the mouth water. You won't be disappointed either. Pleasant with its light body and balanced taste of spice and pumpkin flavors. Perfect for the transition into the winter season. A tasty, satisfying ale that effortlessly hits your sweet-tooth and warms the soul."
"Overall alot of spice flavors, maybe a little too much but im not complaining. Great flavor in my opinion. Hope to get more of this next year."
"Drinkability: I can session a sixer of this yet I feel like the spices may turn some off after 2 or 3, although this is one of the closest pumkin resemblences I've had, it might taste TOO much like pumpkin, the spices are there and definetley kickin', it's just treating the right palate with this kind of beer where somebody won't be offended by it's character. In my book though, an excellent pumkin that will only get better with age."
"Bottle: Poured a medium amber color ale with a good size foamy head with average retention and no lacing. Aroma of light pumpkin notes with some light cinnamon notes also distinguishable. Taste is also dominated by some light pumpkin and cinnamon taste. Wow, I was quite surprise by how bland and average this offering is. I was expecting something with a lot more character."
"D: Nothing wrong with this one, my only complaint is the mouthfeel. It's definitely balanced nicely and very drinkable."
"There was not tons of pumpkin flavor, but their were hints of it. I tasted a metallic flavor almost as much as the pumpkin flavor. It is the time of year for a pumpkin beer but if you look hard you will be able to do better than this beer for a pumpkin ale. Brooklyn is a great brewery though and they are 100% renewable energy!!!"
"I tried this right after the St. Ambroise Citrouille and felt this did better only with respect to appearance. The head was momentary and I thought it looked more white than anything else. It turned wispy and did stick around though, with a bit of lacing here and there. Clear light brown, orange hilights. Distinct smell, I thought, of a ginger ale with feint whiffs of orange or other fruit zest. Taste bitter with marmalade predominant and flashes of sour fruit. Thin body, mouthfeel initially spritzy but settled into a spice and malt finish. I have a few favourites from this brewery but this is not near the top of the list, decent but not remarkable."
"Poored a light copper color with decent cream head that struggled to hold on but left some lacing. Smelled of light pumpkin spice and a hint of banana. Taste is that of a weak pumpkin pie with somewhat of a bad acid taste as well. Originally purchased for a campfire night doesn't really have the qualities of something I'd have a few of and unwind with.... would most likely try another pumpkin ale if the option was there."
"Just way too understated to stack up as a decent pumpkin ale especially when compared to some of the other similar seasonal offerings out there right now. Loved Brooklyn Lager, but this is a clear miss."
"A good, and different, example of this fall style."
"D-You can easily drink a sixer of this brew without it getting old or annoying. I highly recommend this brew during the fall months."
"D: One of my favorite pumpkin ale's. Easy to drink and quite enjoyable if you enjoy pumpkin pie."
"D- This is pretty easy to drink and would make for a good session beer."
"D - A nice fall beer. I'd enjoy a couple of these."
"Pours an amber/copper color. Head is a single finger and fizzy. Extreme metallic taste - over fermented? or carbonation stimulated? Smell is heavily scented with spices and of course, pumpkin. Taste is medium bodied typical ale. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, almost watery and again metallic. Drinkability is low. I think this beer is a miss, could be that I got a bad batch, could be that it's just plain overrated. Go with Dogfish Head Pumkin' instead."
"Poured a dark orange into my goblet with a frothy head which quickly reduced into a thin cap and left minute lacing. Aroma is spices and pumpkin, quite tasty; I can smell it from here, while my glass is next to me as I type. Good malt aroma, pumpkin, clove, a little cinnamon. Mouthfeel is loose with minimal carbonation and a light-medium body; I expected more depth. Taste is mainly of pumkin spices, clove, cinnamon, as well as pumpkin, vanilla and a hint of toasted almonds. Overall this beer is quite good. I'm glad I bought a sixer and could see myself getting another."
"D = This is a fiar drinking pumpkin beer. I really rate it down slightly only because it is just a little too similar to a standard pale ale and I think of drinkability as in part within style. This is an easy drinking and enjoyable beer though."
"D: Considering this was my first pumpkin ale, I don't really have anything to base my critique on. However, I was happy to find that they didn't go overboard with the pumpkin flavour. All in all, this is an interesting brew that fits the season quite well. I;m going to save the rest of my 6-pack for Thanksgiving this coming weekend (Canadian thanksgiving that is)."
"Decent carbonation, nice flavour make this fairly drinkable."
"after a moderately quick pour this beer is a bright clear dark copper/orange with a fairly thick and lacy head. The smell is of some spice definite cinnamon with nutmeg and allspice typical pie spicing there is actually some grain in the background. The taste is pretty nice. Overall the spices do come out front but they aren't cloying and the beer itself isn't overly sweet, two big pluses. This is still a beer not an over spiced attempt at liquid pie. A bit of malt is detectable as well as some spicy hoppiness that brings everything together. The mouthfeel is pretty good the spiciness does tend to linger and get a little annoying after a while but that's true of most beers with spice. And as far is drinkability is concerned, this is a pumpkin beer which by definition is a style where you drink one and then you're done or move onto something else. One goes done well enough, actually much easier than many other examples of the style but its' not a session beer in my opinion. Overall a better than average representative of the style."
"Good flavours over all and enjoyable, save for the headache."
"D- It wasn't too overpowering to have more than one. Easy to drink and a good fall beer."
"Pretty drinkable for a pumpkin ale, a little less sweet than most."
"Overall this is a slightly above average pumpkin beer. There's nothing spectacularly bad about it, but there's nothing that makes me want to drink it again either."
"I will definitely drink the rest of these."
"This is a fantastic pumpkin ale. This ranks right up there with Dogfish Head and Smuttynose and I was pleasantly surprised. Just the right amount of pumpkin spice in there and its all blended together beautifully. Great job here by Brooklyn Brewery buying this company.. they make a kick ass pumpkin ale!"
"Picked up a six pack for last weekend. Poured into pint glasses. Not a lot of carbonation. Very watery looking. Orange color, with a hint of spice in the nose. My wife looked at me and asked if mine tasted OK. Very weak flavor, and almost tasted it bit soapy when it first hits your mouth (glasses were clean, don't worry). There was some pumpkin flavor there, but not a lot. Very thin beer. Definitely not my favorite offering from Brooklyn. There are much better pumpkins out there (cough cough Smutty). We left the rest in the fridge and moved on to some Victory Festbiers."
"D - Good beer but not the best pumpkin ale."
"Served in a standard pint. Poured a translucent copper with a frothy, bright white head. Sticky strands of lacing coated the sides of the glass during the session. Nose was almost non-existent; perhaps some nutmeg and pale malt but really difficult to detect. Taste follows nose - slightly more pronounced in the mouth, but very subdued for the style. Pumpkin and cinnamon is present, but barely detectable. Light and lively mouthfeel with some carbonation tingle across the tongue. Decent drinkability, but for all the wrong reasons. Very muted flavor profile which keeps it easy drinking, but not what one anticipates for the style of beer."
"Serving type: bottle"
"D - Definitely drinkable, just disappointed there's no pumpkin taste."
"A nice beer to celebrate the first day of autumn."
"Overall: A very average """pumpkin ale""" which smells nice but tastes rather lackluster."
"My only caveat for this one was that by the end of the bottle my palate had """had enough""" of the sweetness and I wanted another beer but not another one of these."
"D - It's OK, but not knocking my socks off. Pumpkins are more in the nose than the flavour."
"Glad I tried it, but would not want another one."
"12 oz bottle. Pours a clear copper with 3 cm foamy, offwhite, slowly diminishing head. Aroma of pumpkin pie and nutmeg. Initial flavor of bread, very bland. Taste gets dry and kinda clovey. Moderate carbonation, moderate lacing, light body, and no alcohol noted. Overall, after the aroma, this beer is not very good. But it does smell awesome."
"Poured an amber/orange color, with a white head that left a little lacing. Aroma is pumpkin (not too strong) with some spices. Taste is not strong of pumpkin or spices almost watered down to me. Left a weird aftertatse. This is still a beer I would drink, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it."
"D - I don't know if it's just pumpkin ales, or me, or a little bit of both, but a few sips of this is all I really need. I don't enjoy these pumpkin/pumpkin pie spice flavors without some appropriate sweetness and this brew is no exception. Not bad at all, but nothing I'd want a few of."
"Pours clear amber with a big fluffy white head. Head stays all the way to the bottom of the glass and leaves behind plenty of sticky lace. Smells of big spice and slight cidery smell. Lots of nutmeg in there. Big pumpkin pie flavor. Slight toasted malt. Finishes with a little harsh bitterness...just a little. It is on the light side of medium with good drinkability. I like this beer. Far better then I thought it was going to be. I love pumpkin beers and this one is decent. I would probably reach for others first but with limited selection I wouldn't think twice about getting this one again."
"Pours a light brownish orange in color. Decent inch of head on the pour that sticks around for awhile. Smell is spice and a good amount of pumpkin. Taste is even more of the pumpkin flavoring. Medium mouthfeel and easy drinking. Decent amount of pumpkin flavoring, but could use a bit more spice."
"Poured out a dark copper with a one-inch head despite a pretty heavy pour. Smelled of cinnamon and nutmeg almost immediately. Very prevalent. You also get hints of other herbs and earthy tones. Tastes very earthy. You can taste that cinnamon, nutmeg effect Brooklyn was going for, but no real presence of a sweet pumpkin flavor that I was looking for. This could almost be a brown ale if it weren't for the mildly sweet cinnamon and malt flavors. Overall, a good pumpkin ale - the right idea, but not exactly in-your-face with pumpkin flavor."
"D- Nice beer for a fall evening or a sunday football game. I am biased because I really enjoy pumpkin beers, but this one is pretty good."
"mouthfeel is a bit on the thin side but acceptable. the quality carbonation suggested by the head and lacing is a plus."
"D: I wanted more. I thought it was light and easy for a pumpkin ale, but I loved the flavor that it did have."
"D - overall, one of the more drinkable pumpkin ales out there."
"If you have not tried a pumpkin beer, you should begin here. Just know you're beginning with the best."
"A perfectly clear light orange with red tint. Head builds up really nice, though fades pretty fast. The smell is all those spices, as advertised. Get a lot of clove out of it. The beer is pretty sweet upon sipping, but finishes with a dry spiciness. The mouthfeel was pretty light and well carbonated. Overall it didn't seem to have a savory or bready quality I was hoping for. Seemed more like a lot of spices on a real thin backbone. I'm not running to the fridge for another bottle."
"The drink is smooth and palatable with nice drinkability. Pleasantly spicy and earthy, but not very punkinny."
"Overall, I've definitely had better (DFH/Southern Tier/Weyerbacher)...Not too good here."
"Solid pumpkin ale."
"This was my first attempt at a Pumpkin Ale and while it's not outstanding I certainly found it to be intriguing. It seems like the type of beer that would be best suited for a crisp autumn evening. I'm looking forward to trying some other examples from this style in the coming months."
"This is my first year getting into Oktoberfests and Pumkin Ales. I've gotten around to quite a few already, but this one is different from the rest. The spices are amazing. There is a lot going on.. Not to bitter to burn the tongue, just right. Followed by a smooth aftertaste. The finish is great, very crisp. And taste of pumpkin spices stayed on my tongue. I would of have one or two more. Try it."
"Tons of tan head on this brew after I pour it into my glass. Great retention too, and decent lacing. Orange/amber color. Floral hops in the aroma and hints of spice. Flavors however are weak. Nutmeg, subtle pumpkin in the middle with an unusual finish. Semi-dry and a little bitter but not in a balanced way. Light in the mouth, a little watery, needs gumption. A good theory but a rather poor execution."
"I found this beer to be better than average. While it did have a nice deep color I thought it had a little too much cinnamon/nutmeg flavor (somewhat over powering). Still better than many of the other pumpkin flavored beers on the market. You could probably drink a couple, but that's it."
"Used to live in a town along the Post Road in CT. Loved the place. Wonderful time of year for us pumpkin lovers. I you like the style, you'll love this version. Deep brown in the glass, with a nice head and a soft carbonation. Spice (nutmeg, clove, cinnamon) in the nose. Taste is malt and spice, with a hint of pumpkin and a nice hops balance. Slightly bitter aftertaste makes it very drinkable. I noted on the label that the beer is brewed in Utica (a la Matt/Saranac and others). Great beer town."
"Serving type: bottle"
"The temperature is dropping and the fall seasonals have been popping up. Pumpkin Ales are meant to be enjoyed this time of year and this is a rather good offering. Nice full pumpkin aroma with spicy hints of clove and cinnamon. Golden dark copper color with a huge creamy head that ultimately settles and leaves some decent lacing. Mouthfeel is good and crisp, wish it were a bit thicker and creamier though. Flavor has a nice balance, the pumpkin is easily detected but not overdone. Good spiciness of clove, nutmeg, and cinnamon. The aftertaste lingers for a while giving a nice sweet finish. Out of the ordinary and well done I'm sure there are better out there but this one still hits the mark."
"GC"
"D: Decent drinkability for what it is."
"note: I am trying not to be harsh to this beer because I'm 1) not familiar with the style and don't know if this is how it should taste or not. Also I don't know if I like this style yet."
"Smells all cinnamony, spicy and sweet. Has a white head with lots of lacing. Looks good, smells good...tastes good, too! Taste is rather sweet with loads of cinnamon and maybe a little clove. Nice bit of bitter hops to balance it out as well. This is really a very good beer. Much nicer than I was expecting."
"Notes: As this style goes,many fail and I can not say I have had many good tasting pumpkin beers. This one was good. I can say this is more of a seasonal beer so I try to enjoy it during the holiday season. I can find it now,but I refrain."
"Poured into my pint glass and received a seethru light, rubyred body with a creamy one-fingered head that receeded quickly and left little lacings. Pumpkin hit my nose first, natch, then some grassy hops and spices like pepper. Also picked up some yeast/sugar in there because I picked up faint traces of bubblegum. Cinnamon and bread malt come through in the taste, but it is more hoppy/bitter than smooth. Still, a medium body with the hops giving off light citric twinges. Caramel and maybe roasted malt mixed in too. Ultimately, just a little too much carbonation for my liking, as the beer was too sharp to be completely quaffable. Not a bad beer, but I will not buy another one."
"Light clear orange pour with a large offwhite head. Mild pumpkin spice smell, perhaps a bit less so than average. Body is watery, thin and flavorwise is probably the blandest pumpkin beer I've had. Very low carbonation as well adds to the lifelessness of it. Not offensively flavored at all, just a poor pumpkin beer, I thought."
"Clear, amber/orange with a fine, off-white cap. Decent head retention saw the foam eventually forming a thick collar and producing some spotty lace. Pie spices in the aroma, cloves, a bit of squash and marshmallow, perfumy nutmeg. Same in the flavour, with light hop bitterness, some toasty malt for balance, with spices lingering in the finish. Medium/light bodied with average carbonation, fair texture. I liked the balance on this one, not over the top with spices. Tasty."
"Deep amber with orange hints - topped by a thin off-white head. Aroma has some caramel and a hint of pumpkin pie spice, but not much. Taste is fairly flat and astringent. Minimal notes from pumpkin. More woody than spice of any type. mouthfeel is also dry and thin. Drinkability- it's drinkable, but not enjoyable."
"Pours a fully clouded orange brown. No head in my Duvel tulip. Nose is very mild pumpkin pie with spices. Flavor is actually pretty decent. So many of these pumpkin ales are disasters. This one comes off fairly well. Nice balance of spices that don't under-do it and don't overdo it. Feel has a good carbonation to it and the liquid is decent as well. Overall a pretty good pumpkin ale here. Can't say I would go for it again as I just don't really care for this style, but you might as well give it a shot at least once."
"Pale copper/orange color with a pretty big off-white head that settles down to a fuzzy film with decent lacing. The aroma is sweet cinnamon/nutmeg and pumpkin with some bitter grass. The flavor comes on a bit more bitter than the sweet smell but it holds onto a tastey pumpkin/nutmeg quality. Well carbonated and generally a good feel, on the fizzy side as others have mentioned. Pretty refreshing, goes down easy but the bitterness and pumpkin flavor may not invite over indulgence here. It definitely puts a little bite on your tongue along the line of a grainy hop. I think it is both different and likeable but I would not be inclined to have more than one of these at a time I think. It's not stupendous, even as a pumpkin ale, but I must admit that I've only had one pumpkin ale that I really liked a lot. I would definitely drink this again, especially since I have a six pack with five left! Not bad at all though."
"Poured copper orange into a pint glass with a half inch of cream white head. The aroma was of a cold slice of pumpkin pie. Nutmeg, ginger, allspice. The taste was of a well spiced pumpkin pie. Nutty, spicey, and of pumpkin. It was well-balanced. Most of the pumpkin ales I've had this year have either been overspiced or underspiced, and it was nice to have a balanced one for a change. The feel was fizzy and creamy. Some reviewers have said that it was overcarbonated, but I feel the high fizziness gives it a better texture. One of the better pumpkin ales I've had this year, and one I look forward to having again next year."
"drinkability - I wasn't too fond of it. Not something I would try again. I like fruit beers, so thought I would like this. It just wasn't for me. Tasted very odd to me."
"Drinkability: I did like the contrast between the sweet pumkin taste and the slightly bitter finish. I would have it again. A quality beer from Brooklyn."
"D-It's allright, not the best pumkin this year but passable. I have one more and will drink it for thanksgiving."
"It's actually a quite nice pumpkin ale. My only valid complaint is the heavier-than-normal carbonation. It's just a little too fizzy for my taste. Oh, I also think the spice flavors could be a little more intense."
"All in all, I enjoyed it. It was festive for the season, and I enjoyed the spices. I wouldn't drink this year-round, but certainly during the fall. I look forward to trying other pumpkin ales."
"A lot of local stores started carrying this beer in late September, and I'm always a fan of Pumpkin Ales, so I thought I'd try this one. It pours a light pumpkiny orange, with a small white head. Pretty godo retention. Smells and tastes of the pumpkin, plus the standard spices: cinnamon, cloves, anise, etc. Mouthfeel is light, but too fizzy for my tastes. I think a pumpkin ale should be a bit creamier, and this one instead bites the tongue too much. It almost overwhelms the flavors. Overall, a decently drinkable beer, but definitely not my favorite pumpkin ale."
"Out of the many pumpkin ales I tried, this is one of my least favorites... Despite a strong pumpkin flavor, there was a strong, noticeable bitter after-taste which just didn't do it for me... In my opinion, there are much better pumpkin brews out there... Strong hints of nutmeg and cinnamon are definitely there, but the bitterness destroyed this one for me... Maybe it was just the 6-pack I bought - could be that this was an older sample, but I'm not sure... If it was a recent sample, then I really wasn't crazy about this one... This is coming from someone who's tried just about every pumpkin ale out there... Much better choices to choose from... Really not sure about paying $7.50 for this one again, but if you're a seasonal ale fan, it's worth trying at least once..."
"This is the Pumpkin beer I would buy if i were in the mood, for sure. I would recommend this one to anyone looking for a good example of this style."
"A fine pumpkin ale, though spiciness, that lends to taste, brings down overall drinkability a bit. Overall, one of the better pumpkin ales out there, IMO."
"Final thoughts  Not much in the way of pumpkin pie flavor. It should be renamed Cinnamon Ale because it totally dominates the flavor. To me this was a very disappointing experience."
"Still, there's a crisp, rich crystal malt flavor here, too, and it serves as a nice backbone for the brew. Along with the spice and the notes of vegetal pumpkin flavor, one really does get the sensation of drinking a slice of pumpkin pie. In the finish, the spices, especially nutmeg, intensify."
"A interesting Halloween beer, but once a year is probably about right for this one."
"Pours a clear dark orange color with a nice head. Smell is mild, but pleasant with nutmeg and all-spice aromas. Taste has a real pumpkin flavor to it and quite dominating, but with a little citrus flavor too. In the mouthfeel you get high carbonation and bitterness. The flavor sticks around in your mouth for a while, but instead necessarily a bad thing. This is the first time having this beer and is pleased for the most part and is something look forward to in the fall."
"Overall- A decent fall beer. It's not something I'd seek out, but something I'd definitely drink again. I'm sure it will find its way into a mixed sixer of pumpkin beers again next fall."
"D: Wouldve like to had a few of these given that they were keeping away from overdoing the sweetness."
"I probably wouldn't order this again if there are other pumpkin ales to choose from."
"Overall, very refreshing and better than expecting. Very sessionable."
"Post Road is probably the least favorite of any Pumpkin Ale I have ever had. It has a great appearance, however it has a smell with no hint of pumpkin. It definitely comes through in the taste as I couldn't sense even a slight taste of pumpkin. I am surprised they can even call this a pumpkin beer."
"High carbonation makes for a very crisp and clean mouthfeel, but overall its very lacking. A matted yeastiness sticks on the tongue and concludes a moderately bad beer experience. I would suggest reaching for just about any other pumpkin selection this season."
"If you're looking for a spicy, slightly bitter beer, this is the pumpkin for you. If something a little smoother with a more pronounced pumpkin flavor is what you seek, I'd recommend giving the Saranac Pumpkin Ale a try."
"Not the best, but certainly not the worst. This one could use a little more pumpkin flavor. As of now, thansk at least to the spices, it seems more like a dull and watery Winter Warmer. It's worth a try, someone should at least find this one to their tastes."
"My first pumpkin ale...hope it was last years batch....this was not good; Looked ok. Orange amber color, decent light tan head, some lacing. Smell had some kind of pumpkin spice, fairly mild. Taste was not good, skunky cabbagy taste with a soapy aftertaste. Mouthfeel a bit thin. Drinkability not good at all. All things being equal I would take a Bud over this one hands down. I want to try a few more pumpkin ales and see if I have a prejudice against the style or if a guaranteed fresh one purchased in the fall makes a difference."
"Poured a orange color with off white head that leaves some lacing. Smell is of spices. Taste is of spices and some pumpkin pretty good. Good bit of carbonation but still smooth. Its a good brew good taste I would probably get it again its worth trying sometime."
" Overall I was more then impressed, I thought this was wonderful. This was my second pumpkin in a row that came off just really great. I am really beginning to get a handle on the style and really actually developing a liking for it. This seems like the perfect mix for a fall night and really something I would like to try on tap. I can see now why people wait for this to come out every year, really a fantastic brew and an excellent choice hands down."
"At 5%, this is super-drinkable. Of all the different pumpkin offerings, this is the only one I can easily enjoy more than two of. The spice doesn't crawl up your face and take a dump into your sinuses. It's just downright pleasant and pumpkiny, yet doesn't let you forget you're drinking beer (unlike many of it's competitors). You just don't mess with Brooklyn Brewery. They know what they're doing."
"D: One or two of these per season isn't bad but I would like one that is a touch sweeter and with a bit more alcohol to make it feel more seasonal."
"I'm impressed with this ale. I'd like to try it on tap sometime."
"Good beer. Id suggest Sam Adams fall brew if youre looking for a bit more spice. I believe Serenac was a bit lighter, but I havent had it this year and could be completely mistaken  I just recall it being my favorite last year. Not my first time to purchase it, and certainly not my last. One of these days Ill purchase all the Pumpkin beers I can find and do a taste off"
"Really great all around. Good appearance, good auroma, good taste... good all around. What else could you ask for in a pumpkin ale."
"D - I could easily have another, and would enjoy trying this brew again, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get it. Definitely worth a try though!"
"I don't like this quite as much as DFH's version, but it is still a standard for me in the fall- and it is cheaper. Pours orange with a thin and wispy head. Smell is of nice pumpkin pie spice and silky pumpkin. Well balanced, and with some late maltiness. Taste is similar, but less spicy than the aroma and more of a straight pumpkin taste. A little thin and slippery up front, the spice comes into play more on the finish. Smooth drinking tasty fall beverage."
"This beer is a savory fall brew. It has a very good aroma that captures you as soon as you open the bottle. The aroma is that of a fresh pumpkin pie, which makes it the perfect fall beer. The strong tones of nutmeg make this pumpkin beer a winner. It has a very good mouthfeel - smooth, perfectly carbonated for it's gravity, and very flavorful. Certainly no enemy of flavor. One of the best pumpkin ales out there."
"Overall, I was pleased with this pumpkin ale. Not quite the best in the style I've had, but better than most. Nice job again for Brooklyn."
"Pours a crystal clear golden copper with an extra pale cream colored two and a half finger head. Good retention and patchy lacing. Two-row and vegetal/squash aromas, with cinnamon, allspice and a hint of ginger in the background. Plain pale malt and husky flavors upfront, followed by a distant pumpkin core taste. The aftertaste is drying, with cinnamon, allspice and ginger slowly emerging bringing a about a faint woody hop flavor and bitterness. I like a more residual sweet and toasty malt profile in my pumpkin beers; but this leans heavily towards crisp and dry. The body is a thinnish-medium with a mid to high carbonation that further lightens the mouthfeel. Finish shows mellow pumpkin pie spices and faintly perceivable pumpkin flesh and pale malt. This is a softer and more approachable Pumpkin ale than average and may seem unbalanced to someone looking for a malty ale with lots of pumpkin character. But it may also appeal to someone that desire a beer with just a pumpkin & spice accent that holds a high drinkability."
"After the good looks in my glass it was pretty much downhill from there."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Alive and prickly, not totally elegant but better than average. It pushes the spices and pumpkin flavors around enough to get all the nuances. Great drinkability, again the hops rule here... between the bone dry finish and the bitterness left behind, I can't wait to grab another sip. Terrific beer this Fall season."
"Added Note: After reading this months issue of Beer Advocate Magazine (shameless plug) I saw the beer floats. I think my next pumpkin beer will be served as an ice cream float. YUMMY!"
"D-This is a good all around beer. Well made with no flaws. however pumpkin beers can either be sweet or dry, I prefer sweet."
"This beer pours a light brown color with a slight, foamy white head that dissipates extremely quickly. Very little lacing on the glass. The smell is very nice -- nutmeg, pumpkin, slight hint of cinammon, over a backdrop of what smells like a good blend of hops. The taste follows suit....you pick up the nutmeg and the hops, and a fair amount of the pumpkin. The carbonation is medium, but it goes down smooth. This would be a very good session beer. Good, solid choice for the fall/winter."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: For a pumpkin ale I find this one to be lighter in body than I expected. Carbonation is medium in level, and the brew finishes semi-dry. This is an easy drinking beer, it would make a great session beer but I don't think that I'll be purchasing it again. There are others out there that are way better."
"On draft at Jacob Wirth Boston MA. Poured into a plain pint glass. Small head, looks like a normal pale ale. Smell of nutmeg is quite noticeable. First taste and you know that this isn't like a lot of other pumpkin ales. Nice hop taste along with slight pumpkin pie spice. Really good overall. Also a very striking pumpkin orange tap which sticks out in any draft line."
"Pours a clear, tapered copper color with minimal head that dies down to leave virtual nothing on top of this one. Smell is like sniffing a stick of big red cinnamon gum along with some spices. Taste is of nutmeg and cinnamon. Mouthfeeling is crisp and bold. A decent pumpkin offering."
"poured a copperish color. very fall looking. you can smell a fruity kind of spice in the nose. not quite pumpkin pie. almost more like nutmeg and cinnamon meets apples and pumpkins? i'm not too schooled on pumpkin ales but this seems to be fairly balanced and drinkable. not offensive although the spice does build slightly. all in all very nice. would love to try on tap."
"Pours a clear copper color with a nice dense cream colored head. Some nice lacing was left on the glass as I drank it. The smell is rather faint for a pumpkin ale. I pick up some cinnamon and nutmeg. This ale has subtle pumpkin flavors. There is an initial hit of pumpkin, light cinnamon & nutmeg flavor which is quickly wiped out by the malty presence. The malt border lines on a toasted malt so this beer finishes on the bitter and dry side. I would expect a bit more sweet & spicy flavors out of a pumpkin ale. The beer has a moderate body and well carbonated, finishes slightly dry. This pumpkin ale won't blow you away with pumpkin pie like flavors but at least it is not cloying, as some pumpkins tend to be. This is a malty brew with pumpkin flavors."
"Pours a light amber color with not much of a head. Aroma is of nutmeg and pumpkin, not too strong either. Taste is somewhat bitter upfront with the pumpkin quickly fading towards the back of the tongue. There's also some malt in it but for some reason, I feel like this beer is overkill on that part. To me, a pumpkin beer should be slightly sweet, mellow and go down smoothly. This doesn't fit that criteria."
"Drinkability: After finishing the entire bottle, it's hard not to come down with a small case of hurt feelings, especially if you don't have a rich, delicious Weyerbacher Imperial Pumpkin Ale to follow it up with."
"drinkable?: not supposed to be. this is supposed to be smelled, not a good beverage.. this would be like saying HEY! that purfume smells good! lets drink it!"
"On my quest to find a substitute for Cottonwood Pumpkin Ale, I stumbled across this brew. After being burned by the Shipyard Pumpkinhead Ale (blech), I was hesitant. But the guy at the liquor store said this beer was far superior to that beer, so I gave it a try. Man, was he right! This is definitely one of the better pumpkin ales on the market. Taste actually has undertones and tastes like it was made with pumpkins, opposed to having a tacked on taste, like lots of pumpkin brews on the market. Has potential to be a good session beer for me. Might be a little too much for others though."
"While most pumpkin beers are """one and done""" for me, I could have a few of these in a sitting. Tasty."
"This isnt a bad beer but I think you need to have a liking for pumpkin for this beer because its very pumpkiny."
"Crisp and refreshin. Not real smooth, but I dont always consider that a bad thing either. This one might be furthest from the true style but nonetheless, quite possibly my favorite pumpkin ale."
"I picked up this beer back in the fall, and it has been languishing in the back of the beer fridge since then, due to a bit of burnout on fall seasonals at the time which left this beer orphaned as winter seasonals moved in. Finally decided to give this a try, as I feared it would be fading by now. I was pleasantly surprised at how well this had held up, with some nice bright malt flavor and a well-balanced pumpkin and spice note. The spicing was nicely moderated - prominent but not overpowering. One of the best of this style I've had. I didn't realize at the time that Brooklyn was producing this, but that explains the quality."
"D - An overall good representation of the pumpkin ale style. Spicy, but not overdone. Enough real pumpkin flavor to give an ample full texture in the mouthfeel. Effervescent, sweet and pleasant. I could and have had several in a session."
"There's a little volume felt as it goes down. I couldn't put many of these down initially, but as the season chilled, it was an everyday beer practically. I went through three bottles at breakfast with a stack of pancakes, that's how much I enjoyed it. :)"
"This beer is a nice bright orange and there is a small head and a fair amount of carbonation. The smell is unmistakably pumkin. The taste is spiced pumkin pie. The mouthfeel is smooth. The drinkability is good and I could have this beer again. Near the top of the heap for the style."
"Overall - A pretty good pumpkin ale... taste not as good as the aromas indicated but worth a try..."
"I was looking forward to trying something also from the brooklyn brewery and when I found this I was intrigued. Sadly its not my cup of tea as it were, I've never been a huge fan of winter warmers and spiced beers and this was in the same vein"
"Just average. Would go well as a dessert beer for a turkey dinner. The highs and lows in style range so much that overall the drawbacks in this balance out."
"Thanks to AKSmokedPorter for the taste & to my wife for being ready with the towel."
"Pretty good beer, and definately nice for the season."
"When poured, it was a deep golden amber with an orange hue to the color, with very little foam or lace. The smell of All Spice blew my sock's off. This pumpkin ale is the closes to the taste of pumpkin that I've tasted so far. Not great mind you, but, not bad. Their is alot of spices and the flavor is pleasant and not over powering. This is the best Pumpkin Ale that I've tasted so far."
"One of the better fall/pumpkin beers I have had. This beer drinks very easy and I would buy again...when in the mood!"
"d - easily drinkable, i really enjoyed this one and look forward to more."
"An nice version of the style."
"It's drinkable, but it's not wonderful. The fall gimmick is to make beer that tastes like pumpkins. Brooklyn fails, but not as badly as others have. It's not sticky sweet and it's not cloying. But why drink this unless you're set of having a pumpkin beer and you can't find a better one? I can see why Brooklyn leaves the """Post Road""" label on this one. See my review of Smuttynose's Pumpkin Ale for more senseless pumpkin-related ranting."
"12 oz. bottle with no freshness date. It pours a clear golden amber, with a medium bead that leads up to an inch of off-white head that leaves decent lacing. The bouquet consists of floral ale esters, pumpkins, pale malts, and light spicy hops. It tastes like strongish clove and nutmeg, light cinammon and allspice, along with pumpkins, some pale malts, and a mild bitterness on top of a light, dry, tingly body. An average pumpkin ale now, but when it originally came out it was probably one of the best."
"An average pumpkin ale. Nothing special."
"Very good, quality/style wise it compares to Punkin Ale, but it is a bit more tilted towards the hop. Score downgraded a bit on mouthfeel, just didn't seem appropriate to finish as dry as it did. Despite the mouthfeel issue, pretty easy to drink and I would enjoy another."
"Easy to drink, pleasant tasting. Priced reasonably. A truly well done pumpkin ale."
"DA: I've had a few of the Pumpkin ale's recently and this one is amoung my very favorites."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle. It had about an inch head. It was a dark orange, pumpkin color. It looked very inviting on this cool evening. The aroma was spice and pumpkin. The flavor up front was all spice. Then I tasted soap. I thought it might be my glass. So I got a new one and the flavor still was soapy/chemical. I let the beer warm up a bit and the soapiness seemed to go away a bit. It was a fizzy medium bodied beer. If it were not for the first soapy flavor it would be very drinkable. Let it warm up and you will enjoy it more."
"Decent brew. Poured an amber color with a nice head that sticks around for about a minute. It smelled a little bit like pumkin and sweet malts. Tasted a little like pumpkins with a nice spicy/bitter aftertaste which is the best part. Goes down easy, but it is just an average pumpkin ale. I would have another if the situation arose."
"It's very light and smooth. A bit creamier as it warms up, but has a nice dry finish. A very cozy autumn beer; sweet but balanced with spiciness."
"Decent brown sugar, ginger, allspice, nutmeg, and clove aroma. Could smell all of these, but all were weak. Smelled watery. Good long finish with a taste that rests on the tongue. Seemed a bit thin. I would've like more malt and spiceness in this one. Probably could drink a lot of these at a tailgate party. Wouldn't get drunk as fast."
"So far, the best pumpkin ale yet this fall. Next up, DFH!"
"This beer is highly drinkable, quite tasty, and better than most pumpkin ales I've tried. Wholly reccomended if you enjoy pumpkin ales, or just want to celebrate the season."
"I would maybe go so far as to propose this as a """light""" pumpkin ale. I'm a fan of Brooklyn, but they kind of dropped the ball on this one. I'd stick with South Hampton (also from New York State), Dogfish Head, or Smuttynose if you can find them."
"Poured into a standard pint glass. Color was a nice golden hue. Poured with a nice foamy head that quickly disappeared. Aroma smelt of spices akin to pumpkin pie. Tasted nice, slight hint of the spices, without being bitter or overly spicey. Was pleasant to drink. Felt a little thin in the mouth. Slight aftertaste, but hard to place. The beer was slightly sweet, but not in a honey sweet, more in a guord sweet. (I.E. Pumpkin) Easy to drink, one of the better of the style I have had."
"nice dirty orange """pumpkin pie""" color. head deminishes quickly. aroma is malty sweet with a hint of nutmeg. flavor is lightly sweet with a peppery biting spice. pumpkin lingers in the aftertaste. not overly complex, but easy to drink. light and crisp. unlike many pumpkin ales i'd have a second. however, just an average example of the style."
"Overall, a terrific pumpkin ale (especially for the price)."
"Beer poured out a nice golden color, with a mild orange mixed in. Smell was mild, some obvious pumpkin, but it was not overwhelming. Taste was mostly pumpking, with some mild malt as well. All in all taste left me wanting more, not too sharp. Mouthfeel fairly light, somewhat flat, average at best. It was a fairly drinkable beer, nice autumn beer, not the best pumpkin."
"My first experience of this style, and it's a good one. I'd certainly give this another taste, and it makes me willing to explore a style into which I was hesitant to venture."
"I have loved pumpkin ales this season, dont know why, just do. This is a very decent showing from Brooklyn. Amber color with a little orange tint, not to much though. Had a great pumpkin pie type smell, cinanamon and nutmeg galore. Only problem that i had was the finish, which was a little grainy. Better than most pumkins but not as good as others. Definetly worth a try"
"Copper/amber in color and appears thick. Minimal lace floating atop. Very sweet honey malt and fruity. Taste is of roasted grains, yeast, general spices, and actual pumpkin lingering in the background. As for the spices nothing particular jumps out at the beginning but notes of cinnamon, all-spice, and nutmeg can be found in the finish. Medium body with very nice carbonation consistent to the end and leaves behind a bubbly remnants."
"Pours out a nice orange-amber color, pretty off white head, small bubbles that lasts a few minutes. Good retention. Prominent notes in the nose are pumpkin, nutmeg, and malt sweetness. There's also a some other spice at work, cinnamon, and a minimal amount of banana. You get everything in the taste that you do in the nose, but the cinnamon is stronger here. Very drinkable for a pumpkin. Balanced without being overly pumpkined or overspiced. Somewhere between lightly carbonated and creamy smooth."
"Pumpkin pie spice matched with the flavor of a lighter ale. Tastes a little more like beer than other pumpkin beers. Thats not a bad thing, as its more of a kolsch or just lighter ale. Almost on the pumpkin spice end of the spectrum instead of simply pumpkin."
"This ones about as hit-or miss as you can get in one bottle. Sadly, the misses are a little hard to get over."
"Overall a good drinkable ale. However, that lack of pumpkin flavor could easy make this beer pass for a simple amber ale."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer is medium bodied. The beer is nicely carbonated. The beer has no off smells or taste. The beer has a bit of a oily texture but this adds to the experience. This beer was a dam tasty beer treat. I could easily session this beer. This is by far my favorite pumpkin beer."
"Apparently taking their Post Road Pale Ale and adding pumpkin spice, clove, nutmeg, and cinnamon. The look is a crystal clear mix of copper and orange, with an abundance of carbonation. The beer just looks weak. Aromas of clove dominate the brew with back-up scents of pumpkin, nutmeg, cinnamon and malts. Initially wonderful pumpkin pie flavors and malty caramel notes, but the flavors quickly weaken under the timid body and fall apart; leaving behind a hop bittering and a grainy bitey-ness. The beer proves to finish thin and unnecessarily bite-ey, with a persistant spiciness. Not bad, but undermalted and noticable at many parts of the session."
"A clean orangy/amber beer. Has a small off white head. The aroma is light. With a cereal grain malt character carrying the light vegetable (pumpkin) note along. The malty character again is the predominate feature in the flavor with tastey pumpkin notes danceing back and forth on your tongue. Tastes more like a beer that has pumpkin as an ingredient, than a pumpkin beverage that has some beer in it."
"On a chilly fall evening and after a dull day, this might change my perception of a pumpkin ale. Creamy, spicy and good carbonation make me want to drink another. Better than I thought it would be, but I'd like a fuller body in my beer, thank-you."
"ambience: college football, fall evening, john lennon."
"The smell- almost like pumpkin pie. Could smell pumpkin and the right amount of spice aroma. However in the taste I could not detect any of spice that I had smelled. Dissapointing there. Did detect a slight pumpkin taste. Mouth feel was smooth with the right amount of carbonation. Overall decent beer, would drink again."
"Overall: I had this one a few years ago and didn't like it much. For some reason I decided to give it another shot and am glad I did. This one tastes great on a cool evening."
"Clear amber color with a minimal head that dissipates quickly. Very spicy smell of cinnamon/nutmeg with faint pumpkin background. Modest carbonation but just lacks the smooth grace of a truly drinkable ale. Good for comparison, but not on a par with Smuttynose."
"tastes like a pumpkin beer. man, these things are getting old. i can't wait until the winter seasonals come out"
"Pours a light amber color, a bit orangeish really - like pumpkin. Smell is very nice, pumpkin and spice - particularly clove and nutmet. Smells like pumpkin pie. Taste is light, crisp, maybe a bit thin even - a bit of sweetness and spice, again the clove and nutmeg in particular. A nice pumpkin flavor, not overpowering. Finishes like pumpkin pie on the palate, but again it's a little thin. This is a nice pumpkin ale, very drinkable and satisfying on a cool fall day."
"D- Novel for fall months. Nice change from a porter or a sweet stout."
"Drinkability: Not going to be a session for me, one was plenty, it took some real hoppy beers to get the clove taste out of my mouth."
"Drinkability is good, but I am not crazy about this style. This brew is a good to better example of the style and it is well balanced. MK"
"D: Drinkable, but to an extent. A nice change of pace to welcome the fall season. I love fall."
"D: This pumpkin ale avoids the pitfall of many of its colleagues - overspicing. Good balance here; pick up a six-pack and enjoy."
"D - Its somthing that if you can get past the overpowering bathroom style scented candle aroma, then this beer is for you."
"Overall: A nice fall time offering and probably one of the best pumpkin ales I've had. There's a nice balance of pumpkin flavors and pumpkin spice flavors. Pick one up!"
"Eric"
"Pours golden amber. One finger head, with good retention and lacing.Lots od bubbles. Smell spicy, and sweet. Body is light to medium and carbonated. Taste is pumpkin,and allspice up front,with a cinnimon finish. Had a bit of a bitter after taste, but definitely wort a try this fall!"
"12oz brown bottle with no freshness date. Pours a medium amber with a 1 finger head and good lace. Smells spicy - clove, nutmeg and cinnamon. Decent malty charateristics are quickly followed by the pumpkin pie like spicyness. An odd but good bitternesss in the aftertaste. Crisp. For a pumpkin ale this one is fairly drinkable but I probably could not drink more that 2 in one sitting. Usually with most ales of this type I can only drink one. as pumpkin ales go, this one is preety good and nice to pick up a sixer once during the season."
"While I've been known to enjoy a very spicy, strongly flavored pumpkin ale, this beer is absolutely wonderful in it's subtlety."
"Mouthfeel is a bit spritzy for the style. I was just hoping for a fuller, richer beer. Drinkability is pretty high as this is pretty light. This is not bad by any means, and would make a better session pumpkin brew than the one Blue Moon makes. I just really wish this had some more body and flavor."
"Thanks to Ding for sharing this one with me."
"Much better than I was expecting. I would say this beer is slighty underrated on this site. It's no Smuttynose Pumpkin Ale, but it holds its own. I wish the mouthfeel was beefed up a tad more, but the pumpkin profile works nicely."
"Like most ales for me this is very drinkable- by that I mean its easy to drink a lot of these. I just wish there was more flavor, more aroma. This is not what I think of when I think pumpkin ale and the fall. This is to easy to drink in the warm weather. I'll pass next time."
"I inhaled a warm noseful of pumpkin pie spices over the orange-tinged white head, not to mention -- who'd a thunk? -- the aroma of pumpkins (fresh or stewed pumpkins, not roasted). Nutmeg and cinnamon contributed most to the taste, as did a soapy aroma that was annoying, but not nearly as much as it could have been. The Post Road Pumpkin Ale is a gentle brew, with only the slightest hops bitterness as the glass warms. Despite its relative sweetness and its specialty flavoring, I found it highly drinkable -- a fine beer to taste on its own or to quaff at dinner."
"Overall a superb pumpkin ale. The are a few more well-known brand out there that are either way overly sweet & syrupy or too weak and bland for this style. Brooklyn Brewery does this style a huge credit. Most definitely will keep this on hand Sept.- Nov. for sure!"
"Overall, fairly nondescript beer. I was expecting more pumpkin and spice flavors, but instead got a decent ale. It wasn't bad, but wasn't all that memorable either. I'd drink it again, but would hesitate to pay out the premium price ($10 a sixer) that was charged in the store."
"D: It's good, but there's just no way I could drink more than one of these at a time. It has a lot of really big flavor, and it would be too much to try and turn this into a session beer. As a """one and done""" beer, though, it's pretty great. Would go great with creme brulee or cheesecake."
"This wasn't my favorite Brooklyn, but it was okay. I haven't had too many in this style. Taste was a bit odd for me, too much and not enough going on. Some spicyness, too much nutmeg, not enough of everything else. I'll have to try this again this fall."
"Pours a nice coloration of a mixture of gold, amber, light brown, orange and red. Solid 2 finger head that quickly recedes to heavy lacing. I can't pull my nose away from it. Obvious pumpkin pie smell, with some nutmeg and cinnamon. Taste is much the same with a nice balance of pumpkin and spice. The most pumkin tasting pumpkin beer I've had. The warming cinnamon flavor feels good in the mouth. For me it would be a tough beer to session even with the low abv givin the complexity and strength of the flavors. After two I would be ready to move on. Awsome desert beer."
"Cheers."
"This was a really good pumpkin ale. Well balanced flavors for the expectation you get from the aroma. Good looking beer. A definate recommendation for those who like a beer flavored with pumpkins and don't want to drink pumpkin pie."
"Cheers"
"D - I wish I had this one on thanksgiving! A great match with almost any (not too spicy) food. At a reasonable abv, would make a good session beer as well. A really great pumpkin ale."
"Tastes lightly tart (surprisingly). Lots of pale malt breadiness then the spices and a nice clean finish. Crisp and dry and surprisingly full bodied. Decent drinker but nothing to write home about."
"Thanks to AKSmokedPorter for this seasonal holiday treat."
"A tasty and substantial beer and perfectly in season. My favorite Pumpkin so far."
"Pours a light amber color with a thin white head, pretty boring looking beer. The aroma is nice though with notes of pumpkin pie, spices, caramel, esters, and light grassy hops. Flavor begins with a nice pumpkin flavor that doesnt taste artificial like most pumpkin ales, followed by some spices (nutmeg and allspice), caramel, toasted bread, some lightly spicy hops and some esters. The mouthfeel is a tad light as is carbonation, but drinkability is pretty good. Enjoyable pumpkin ale that doesnt taste like a soda, worth trying at least once."
"Not really impressed with this Pumpkin ale. Coloring was a nice deep orange. Pumpkin smell was faint. Pumpkin taste was weak - a bit watery for a pumpkin ale. Also, did not detect as many spices as other brews. This doesn't make it a bad beer. I could drink a few. I just feel that it is lacking taste and heartiness for the genre."
"Drinkability: Very nice natural pumpkin profile; I would add a bit more spice but otherwise quite drinkable"
"Pours a pretty, transluent light amber hue topped by a creamy white one-finger head. Aroma of light sweet malt, pumpkin pie, and the faintest touch of floral hops. Palate is defined mainly by the auxillary spices - marjoram, nutmeg, a hint of cinnamon, melded with light sweet malt and fairly understated pumpkin. Not much of a hop presence on the palate. Medium body is appropriate for the style. I have to say, unlike every other pumpkin beer I've had, at least I don't hate this. The spices are relatively muted, and it doesn't end up tasting like a glass of nutmeg extract. Decent."
"Had this brew on tap last evening. Brew had a cloudy yellow/orange color with a thicker head that had pretty good retention and did leave some lacing around the sides of the glass. Some pumpkin pie like aromas along with a slight sour smell. Had nice aromas but did not notice strong pumpkin like smell that I was expecting, but that could have been due to the fact that I had the Southampton Pumpkin Ale offering, which seemed to be dominated by pumpkin pie tastes. Overall this was a nice brew definitely caught the taste of cinnamon, nutmeg which had a nice balance. Not my favorite type of brew but something I feel obligated to try during the fall. Will have it again."
"Purchased a 6-pack bottles at my local package store, did not know at the time that this beer was actually made by the Brooklyn Brewery although it was a pleasent surprise. Packaging is of pumpkin/autumn motif. Pours a warm, dark amber color with an off-white head. Smell is of spices similar to allspice and cloves with a strong pumpkin aroma. Although smell is strong, it's not overpowering or pungent. The taste of this beer can be summed up with the whole appearance of the autumn season, spices and pumpkin are mixed with the taste of a traditional ale. Solid seasonal ale but not as good as some other fall tradionals."
"This is definately something that you could drink more than one of and still be able to appreciate."
"Drinkability: Overall very pleasant and easy to drink but could use more character."
"20 ouncer at MacGregors. Oh how i love my favorite season the fall. And beers that come along. This pours a nice orange amber with a creamy white head w/good lacing. An easy way to sum up the smell would be pumpkin pie. The taste rocks. Lots of pumpkin pie flavors including clove. Mouthfeel is light but creamy. Lots of malty sweetness. This is insanely drinkable."
"They played this brew a little too conservatively but all in all pretty good."
"Overall not a bad brew for the fall or early winter."
"A conservative pumpkin brew, but why be conservative with this genre?"
"12 oz bottle pours a clear, honey amber body with a small, offwhite head that quickly drops to a film and collar. Sticky, patch lace is abundant. Pie spices take a backseat to caramel maltiness and herbal hops in the aroma. Light medium body with good carbonation. Pie spices dominate the taste, if not the aroma. Cinnamon and nutmeg flavors are most assertive, with malty caramel and fresh pumpkin in the background. Plenty of spicy and herbal hops provide a solid bitterness to balance. Decent drinkability for a pumpkin ale."
"Overall: A pretty middle-of-the-road pumpkin beer that's not going to knock my socks off, but is still solid."
"taste: A nice caramel maltiness is offset by the same clean hops on the nose, which provide a light bittering. What I like about this beer is that the pumpkin is not the main or only characteristic...there is an agreeable balance. Mingling with the sweet malt flavors you find the pumpkin and pumpkin pie spices. This is not so much a pumpkin ale as it is an ale with pumpkin. There could nonetheless be some more pumpkin character, but well done anyhow."
"Drinkability: Good enough to make it a session without any cloying and lingering sweetness that can sometimes effect other beers with the potential to be over-spiced and maybe over-sweetened with something as singular as pumpkin for its taste."
"Clear orangy gold, no head. I can smell the mild brownish fruit and not spices, which suits my preference. Unfortunately the aroma is very light, not whetting my thirst as much as I would like. Nondescript maltiness kind of coats the tongue with a slightly tangy brown sugar but without the sweetness. Begins with pumpkin but ends with what seems to be some kind of rot. Not an awful rot, but just a bit, like when the pumpkin starts to go soft a few days after halloween. Feel is flat, thick, and syrupy, very coating, not pleasant. I shared a bottle of this with my wife, and I am glad that I did. You can take that either way you'd like."
"D: 2155 is the date , so brewed in July, it was new in the store, but if this beer has gone south, I owe this another try. As is, not very good."
"My advice is to try Dogfish Head Punkin'."
"Overall = Not as good as Dogfish Head's version but this one isn't that bad. I recommend fans of pumpkin ales to at least try it, although I know I'd prefer the aforementioned brand if I had a choice."
"The flavor is spicy and malty. The pumpkin is somewhat noticeable, but more apparent in the aroma. A bit of hops also become present in the finish. Mouth feel is light bodied with low carbonation and is a bit oily. Goes down easy and is worth a try, one of the more enjoyable versions of the style that I have tried."
"If you are going to brew a pumpkin ale, DONT GET CHEAP WITH THE PUMPKIN!"
"Instead of being a """pumpkin beer," this is a beer accentuated by pumpkin. Decent, but at times I was forgetting that I was drinking a pumpkin ale (and quite possibly just thinking that this was an APA). When it comes to fruit/vegetable beers, it seems like most breweries overdo it. This one played it a little too safe, but safe can be good. Worth a try."
"Gold-orange body with a small off-white head. Minimal lacing. Smell is very nice, basically consisting of malt aroma with a lot of spice, specifically cinnamon. Caramel malt flavor, lightly hopped, with a mild pumpkin taste. Not overdone like other pumpkin ales. A crisp finish without much of an aftertaste except for a little dry bitterness and a very light pumpkin flavor. Thinner than expected. Probably two pints max of this one for me."
"The taste is similar, heavy on the pumpkin and light on the spices. The maltiness of the beer is weak, which gives it a thin feel in the mouth. It is okay, just not a special ale."
"Much thanks to necoadam for providing."
"Ahh, the pumpkin ale. Is a more perfect marraige between fruit and beer? Answer: yes, but it is a good combo. I'm always on the search for the perfect pumpkin ale. Post Road's is definitely one of the better ones I've had. It has a nice dark amber color and a bit of a malty odor. The taste is somewhat smooth, with barley and malt overtones and some bitterness. Overall a decent pumpkin ale."
"This one pours an orange color with a small white head that falls quickly and leaves a slight lacing on the glass. The nose has more of a pumpkin smell and less of the spices. Interesting. The flavor is dominated by a real pumpkin taste but the spices are subdued in the back ground. The malt character could be stronger here to give it better body - it seems a little thin. Also, it could use a bit more of the spices to make it stand out."
"Thanks Nickbagofdonuts for the beer."
"12oz. bottle poured into a snifter. It pours a deep amber color with one finger of head. There is just a little bit of lacing. The smell has lots of pumpkin, a little spice, and a little bit of maltiness. Pretty nice smell, not too overpowering. The taste has lots of pumpkin as well, but not as much spice as in the aroma. The aftertaste is a little weird, not sure what's going on there. The body is just a little bit light. The drinkability is pretty good though. A decent pumpkin ale."
"This one pours an orange color wtih a slight head taht falls to cover the beer. The nose is a lot of the pumpkin with the spices hidden in the background. The alcohol is also a bit aparent in there as well. The flavor is just what the nose tells me, pumpkin with hidden spices. The flavor is also a bit thin and watery. The feel is pretty thin as well. Drinkability is also okay. I would take other pumpkin ales over this one any day. Its just lacking."
"Overall, it's ok. It's certainly well crafted, but just doesn't standout as a """must try again""" beer."
"Drinkability - overall, quite delicious and enjoyable."
"Pours a clear, medium copper with a sizeable sandy off-white foam. The aroma comes up with a whiff of hops in the first sniff, but after it sits for a few minutes, cinnamon and nutmeg come out and overtake the hops. The caramel malt flavors meld nicely with the pumpkin (you can actually pick out the pumpkin flavor in this and not just the spices) and spices to make for a decent beer. Still, Id like to see this with a little more body and a little chunkier malt. Otherwise, its good."
"I didn't care for this one at all. Poured with a generous head that was long llived and left nice lacing in a clean pint glass. Orange amber color. Smell was cloves, yeast, pumpkin and pepper. Taste was yeasty and weak. Some spice, thankfully not overstated, but no real body and not a hint of malt. thin and poorly balanced. Hence the poor review. I will try again and maybe rewrite this review."
"Pours an golden amber color with a medium white head. Smell is delicious with pumpkin pie spices- cinnamon and allspice. This beer smell is making me hungry for """punkin""" pie. Taste is of smooth caramelized malt and pumpkin pie spice with a sharp, balancing hop. Very interesting spiced ale worth picking up."
"Poured a nice amber color, with a good white head. Fair amount of carbonation. Subtle odor of pumpkin and nutmeg; definitely a Fall in New England kind of smell. Great combination of pumpkin flavor and maltiness. Medium bodied mouthfeel. I could see the pumpkin taste becoming a bit much after more than two or three, but a nice change from some of my usual year round beers."
"Flavor -- noticable pumpkin with supporting but not overpowering spices (nutmeg, cinnamon). Good balance between the malt, pumpkin and spices. I have to raise my 2.6 score, but I still wonder about that bad bottle."
"Pours dark amber, minimal head with little retention. Smells of pumpkin and spice, what else would it be like? However, I expected more from the nose. No hops, malt, just some spices and pumpkin flavorings. It's a good beer, but it's rather light. I expected a heavier, more potent brew for the time of year. But, it's nice if you want just a little light beer."
"I would consider the Post Road Pumpkin to be the lightest tasting of the pumpkins I've tried this year(DFH and Boston Beer Works) . The beer poored and nice dark amber with little whote head, which didn't last too long. The beer gave off a light smell of cinnamon and pumpkin rather than nutmeg and others spices that are common in pumpkin style beers. The taste was light and again not too spicey and had a light bitterness. Overall, I like this beer not my favorite but currently running #2 in the pumpking category."
"... ... ... fall like tears from weeping trees."
"Very smooth and creamy maltiness with a riding wave of pumpkin. As the carbonation tickles your tongue, it feels like a spicy, flavored brown ale. I really liked this, and much better than the DFH Punkin I had yesterday. Medium bodied, it finishes very clean, making it very easy drinking and worth a few. It also isn't too malty or spicy from making you want to have a couple."
"I do not like pumpkin ale. I do not like post road pumpkin ale. It pours orangy amber, with a white head composed of tiny bubbles. Leaves light wispy lacing. This beer is loaded with halloweeny pumpkiny spices. Its sweet and cloying and all together not to my liking. One of the very few not spoiled, not macro brews that I have swilled down the drain in the life"
"One of the better versions of the style I've had in a long time. It's not a style that I would drink all night, but when I am in the mood for it on a cool Autumn night, this is the version that I'll be going back to."
"Pours a medium amber with a lot of carbonation (at first but seemed to fizz out) and little head which soon disappeared. Has a straight pumpkin aroma, no spice, sort of a bland buttery pumpkin aroma. The taste is similar. It has a bland sort of pumpkin taste finishes with sort of a roasted, almost burnt pumpkin taste. Has a medium body and surprisingly leaves little aftertaste. Not bad, but I have to believe there is a lot better out there."
"Overall: This far easier drinking than I had expected. There is no substantial build up of flavor and several of these can go down without feeling pumpkined out."
"Color is golden/amber/orange. About 1 centimeter of head, but light and fluffy. Slight cream color in the head. Eventually fades into a very thin foam layer. Aroma is distant pumpkin pie. Have to really take a whiff to to smell it. Taste is a bit disappointing. Mediocre at best. Seems to heavy on the nutmeg. Not as authentic pumpkin pie tasting as it could have been. On a positive note, mouthfeel was pretty good. Light to medium bodied and pleasant. Overall, not impressed. There are better pumpkin beers out there. For example, Buffalo Bill's."
"A load of spicy pumpkin flavour. Balance quite well to some biscuity maltiness. Sublte but effective hopping lends some earthiness & orange flavour. Medium bodied, smooth, with moderate carbonation. This is what fall is all about."
"Pours out a deep orange/amber color with a nice amount of head that stays with you for a little bit. Smell was pure pumpkin and spices. Reminds me of Thanksgiving time with the pumpkin pie aromas. Also some malts and fruits are hidden in the background. Taste was ok. Lots of pumpkin flavors hit the palate first, then the spices blend in (nutmeg, cinnamon, and other spices in light doses). Mediumish body with a ok amount of carbonation, perhaps a little too much, but that's ok, it didn't kill the taste in any way. I wouldn't mind having one, but that would be about it. I don't know if I would want more than one of these. Not bad."
"Drinkability: This catches up quickly, and begins its weight sooner than it ought to. Having had far too many pumpkin ales this season, this one has nothing to distinguish itself."
"The mouthfeel was nicely dry and roasty and did not convey a watered down impression at all. A sessionable charming beer that is quite different from the hop monsters I usually crave, but a quality brew nonetheless."

"Apparently Brooklyn Brewery distributes this stuff although it is made in CT somewhere. I have only seen it in a couple of bars and sometimes places will sell it in bottles where a good Brooklyn selection is available. At least it's not under the Brooklyn label because I might have to write the good folks there and inform them that there reputation as premier New England brewery is being marred by this mediocre beer."
"Pours a clear clear orange with the aroma of spices and pumpkin. The taste, however is round, a bit yucky with pumpkin coming out and this weird hop roundness coming to the fore. Ends bitter, but with what seems to be little malt backup. The spices intersect in this weird way to leave a bitter taste in the mouth long after the beer is gone. Mouthfeel is fine, good. Drinkability is affected by its overall bitterness. Definitely a beer to have once then move on to something else."
"Compared this pumpkin ounce for ounce with Cottonwood's and by far the inferior brew. No real taste of pumpkin yet strong spices overwhelm the taste and smell, almost too much. Average in terms of drinkability and mouthfeel, maybe I just enjoyed the Cottonwood Pumpkin too much to make a fair assessment."
"drinkability: This beer was really nice, and hit the spot, better than I expected it to be, the pumpkin taste gelled, quite well with the standard beer ingredients, and were mild enough not to detract from the beer,actually added an interesting and enjoyable element. I would recommend this one!"
"A must try."
"Here is a pumpkin beer that intices one to new flavors while still retaining the essence of a very good beer."
"Mild as it hits your lips, then moves to a very spicy flavor. Not a lot of pumpkin to it, more the nutmeg and spices associated without the sweetness. Long spicy finish."
"Bender Factor: I (we) have really gotten into the pumpkin style. Instead of taking the time and mess to bake a pie, I suggest 2 sixers of Pumpkin Ale. Maybe you will finally get along with your in-laws if you bring this for Thanksgiving dinner instead of cranberry sauce. The ABV is well hidden and this beer will surely creep up on me in a hour or so...I am planning on handing out samples of this to the Trick or Treaters this year."
"I saw this beer at the store last night. Since I was unfamiliar with the brewer I didnt pick up the 6, and that was a good decision. I had dinner at Bison County this evening, and they were just putting on a fresh keg. I have to say I was disappointed. It poured a nice deep amber/copper color, but hardly any head (again fresh keg). No lace to speak of in my glass. The nose was mainly cinnamon, with just a touch of pumpkin, and a little malt. The taste was all spice. It was full of nutmeg, allspice, and cinnamon. No pumpkin to speak of. It kind of reminded me of holiday ale (which it should not). It had a real watery, thin mouth feel. Overall, I was mildly disappointed with this beer."
"On-tap at Colter Bay in Buffalo. Poured an orangy amber color with a thin beige head. Aromas of roasted malts, nutmeg, cinnamon, and pumpkin, maybe a bit of ginger, too. I'm not a big alternative brew kind of person, but this really isn't half-bad. Upon first sip, it comes across a bit aggressive, but some amber ale qualities creep their way into the overall experience. Rather slick on the tongue. Not too shabby, but it does not taste enough like beer through all the spices."
"The beer after its dislocation from the 12-ounce brown bottle sets in the glass a nice orange-amber color with a medium sized frothy light tan head and after its erosion, the lace forms a nice sealing sheet upon the glass. Nose is pumpkin Duh and a nice biscuit like aroma, fresh, sweet and quite appetizing with the start ambrosial, the malt delectable and the top middling in feel. Finish as a meaningful acidity with the hops blending perfectly with the malt and pumpkin, dry as a desert bone aftertaste and a fine drinking beer."
"I wasn't very impressed with this beer. A little too spicey, not enough pumpkin flavor. I know I shouldn't, but I can't help compare this to Cottonwoods' pumpkin. This is no where near close. Seems too hoppy to me for a fruit beer. I expected more smell too. It's drinkable, but I think I would prefer it paired with food, not by itself. It's needs something to hold it up. One maybe two is enough for me."
"Pours a golden amber with off white head that falls quickly. Aroma is big and good lots of pumpkin and nutmeg with dash of cinnamon really pumpkin pie like. Taste is not as good light pumpkin malt flavored with nutmeg and hops lightly bitter overall a pretty average pumpkin ale. Mouthfeel light side of medium, could be little heavier in body. Drinkability is not bad but given choice there are better pumpkin ales available."
"Thanks to AKSmokedPorter for this bottle."
"Light in body with some medicine flavors apparent. A slightly bitter finish that is preceeded by nutmeg, but not a lot of pumpkin characteristics to this one. Punkin Ale from DFH is a better choice."
"Big thanks to AKSmokedPorter for the bottle!"
"It poured with a light caramel color with a thin head and little lace. It smells like a pumpkin, but with something extra, like a spicy kick. When downing this beer I noticed that the spicier malt flavor superceded the pumpkin characteristic. The mouthfeel is very grainy to me. It finished a little woodsy and prickly on the tongue. Not one of the best pumpkins I've had and wouldn't go out of my way to get it."
"I've spent the winter becoming accustomed to the intense, sweet spiciness of Harpoon Winter Warmer so I'm not sure if I'm judging this one fairly, but it seems a bit too woody to me. It's not a bad woodiness, but its predominance makes the flavor a little topheavy and one-dimensional. That's my only complaint here."
"I like choices and would choose this one again."
"The beer pours an amber color with a thin off-white head. The aroma is of pumpkin and spices (mostly cinnamin). I rather like the smell of pumpkins in a beer. The taste was decent. Pumpkin ales have a very distinct flavor. I don't know if it's good or bad, but it definately stands out. The mouthfeel was fine. This is a low bodied ale that is rather drinkable for those who enjoy exotic beers. This is a good seasonal ale."
"Post Road was an above average beer with a nice taste. I wish there were more of a pumpkin flavor and less clove!"
"A good first or dessert beer, no more than two for me."
"I think a friend of mine who tasted it before I did put it best when they stated it tasted watery."
"It pours an amber-orange color with an off-white/tan head into my 16 oz Brooklyn Brewery pint glass. Smell and aroma is of nutmeg, cinnamon and pumpkin. You definitely know you are drinking a pumpkin ale. I used to really enjoy 1 or 2 of these right around Halloween, but find myself not enjoying it as much the last few years. Still a decent beer, but my least favorite offering from my favorite brewery."
"alright im gonna get all crazy on you guys and review my first pumpkin. never had it before, so im interested. its pours a beautiful amber with a decent head. smells of tasty spices and light hops. yum. first off i expected a sweet spiced concotion, but this aint it. it def. tastes like a beer and isnt masked by a bunch of crap. it is lightly bitter and lightly sweet at the same time, a certain hop character shines through with just hints of spice and caramels. medium bodied and well carbonated, it is light easy drinking and killing a few would be no problem. a fine beer."
"This is a pretty good beer. Compared to the Smuttynose, it has more natural pumpkin flavor, while the Smutty is more like pumpkin pie."
"Pumpkin ale eh? Alright, I'll bite. Pours a nice amber/orange with a quickly dissapating head. Spicy aroma, with cinammon and nutmeg. Mouthful was thinner than expected. Taste was more c&n spices. Admittedly I've never eaten pumpkin before, as the thought for whatever reason repulsed me, so I can't say whether it's pumpkin I'm tasting. Inoffensive, but I was unable to finish it. Open wide, drain.."
"quite similar to the DFH punkin ale, but with 2 minor flaws in my eyes. it pours a nice amber colour with a bit of a head that dissolves quite quickly and leaves little lacing. smells how one would think a pumpkin ale would: pumpkin, nutmeg, and cinnamon. with the pumkin dominating in smell and taste. the taste parallels the smell, but relies too much on the pumpkin flavouring. it's not overbearing, but just not as balanced as it could or should be. the other flaw was that the brew was a bit more watery than i had hoped for. a fuller body would have been nicer, but overall this isn't a bad brew."
"Taste: Solid malt and pumpking flavor with a good backing of nutmeg and cinnamon with good bit of pepper and bits of hops. Not completely balanced. A little watery and thin. Very drinkable, but I expected a little better from our friends at Brooklyn, maybe I'm holding the bar too high. Very solid performer."
"The flavor is very spciy with the same spices noted in the aroma. A peppery sense accompanies the flavor and creates warmth. The feel is a bit thin and watery, and this combined with the spicy nature limits the drinkability beyond special occasions."
"I haven't had many Pumpkin Ales, but Brooklyn has made a not bad beer that's more than just a novelty. My compliments for another job well done for Garrett and company."
"Looked good, poured a rich amber color. The first sip was encouraging, the old familiar pumpkin and spices. But then something happened that I haven't had happen in a long time. The beer became weaker and less tastefull with each sip. It finally became a chore to drink the last 3oz. It just doesn't stand up."
"clear, orangy color with a nice tannish head. I pocked up hints of ginger, cinnamon and clove. This has a very nice smooth taste and very well balanced. nice blend of spices, not over powering. I'd have to recommend this to anyone that hasn't tried spiced beers before as it's very easy to drink and has a wonderful aroma of spices. I couldn't pick up any pumpkin though."
"Of the 4 or 5 pumpkin beers I've sampled, this is definitely the most well-rounded and drinkable. Nice job Brooklyn!"
"I can't imagine drinking more than one or two of these in one session, as the flavor is offbeat and more of a novelty then a solid session beer. Nevertheless, a nice fall seasonal and a fine tribute to my favorite dessert."
"Not a bad brew, as far as pumpkin ales go, but really not enough beery flavors to balance out the spices. I was getting a bit sick of the cinnamon and nutmeg by the end of the pint. One of the better pumpkin ales, and worth a try if you're into that sort of thing."
"It was thorougly enjoyed."
"A good punkin ale, though light on the pumpkin and high on the ale, but good enough in some aspects."
"Not the best of the pumpkin patch, but I am glad to see Brooklyn has this one now."
"Backwash: I normally love the combination of flavors in pumpkin pie, and done right, it makes a good beer. The one pumpkin ale I’ve had that I liked was made for Rodney’s Oyster House in Toronto, and was thick and rich like a porter. It’s silky texture and slight sweetness even made it seem like pumpkin pie. This on the other hand was more like a Post Road Pale Ale with an infusion of some spices. I can’t give this my recommendation."
"Starts with a four -fingered, white head that goes quickly but leaves a good lace. Strong nutmeg nose nearly the same as a pumpkin pie and there is pumpkin in the background. Nice clear, amber color. Starts malty and hoppy and finishes hoppy with some bitter undertones. Label does not mention the Brooklyn brewery."
"Drinkability: Definitely a novelty beer, but quite good nonetheless. I might have one of these near Thanksgiving, or once in a blue moon. A great way to kick off the fall."
"Pours a deep copper color with a light almost non existent head,aroma is nutmeg and cloves just right for a pumpkin pie.Flavor is not as sweet as some other pumpkin ales with the spicey ness coming thru as it warms with a nice lingering maltiness in the finish.I notice a slight hop-dryness in there as well.A pretty good beer but New Holland Ichibod Ale is my favorite pumpkin beer so far."
"Appearance: Pours with a caramel amber body and a cream colored foaming creamy textured looking head leaving a nice collar of lace already thick and even patches. Aroma: Wow, when I popped the top the pumpkin pie like tone just engulfed my senses very intriguing cinnamon and other spices blend perfectly with the malts used here somewhat of a nut quality comes by my senses as well, but it's safe to call it pumpkin pie. Flavor: A solid base of caramel malt blended with silky cream and spiced pumpkin weird and different but very quaffable. Mouthfeel is a bit on the light side for body but texture is silky smooth. Drinkability: I can honestly say one of these is probably enough not something to imbibe in quantity but to really enjoy and treat as a dessert or somewhat of a novelty not bad just not a creation meant to be drank frequently possibly a once a year beer here."
"Not an in your face pumpkin beer by anymeans. What really makes this beer stand out is how fresh and real the pumpkin meat and soft pumpkin pie spice flavors are. Very drinkable and simple. One of the better pumpkin beers out there."
"Defaintely the best Pumpkin Ale I've ever had. I was expecting something weak on the pumpkin taste, but it was like a liquid version of a Pumpkin pie, with 5.0% alcohol of course. It's cheap and I like it a lot. I guess the only down falls of it are the pure sweetness of it and the lack of a """real""" head. That's cool though, it was still really good."
"A big pumpkin fan in general, perhaps I got my expectations up too high for this one. I will not be purchasing this again."
"Post Road tastes like you might expect a """pumpkin ale""" to taste, combining the classic flavors of pumpkin pie with a well-balanced beer. Its best feature is in its subtlety, as it is definitely a beer and not a fruit-based brew like hard cider."
"Pours copper in color with a thin white head. Aroma is of nutmeg and allspice with a hint of hops. Taste starts out sweet with spicess and finishes with a little hoppy bitterness. Reminds me of the spicess in pumpkin pie, not necessarily the pumpkin itself. Worth getting the one time of year it's available."
"2003 vintage. Copper color with a beige, foamy, lumpy head that sticks around for a while. Aroma is of sweet floral hops and pumpkin. Hops first, pumpkin second. Flavor is full-on pumpkin pie, with a strong accompanying nutmeg flavor. Hops come through in the finish, followed by a lingering nutmeg flavor. Smooth and round mouthfeel. Not overpowering, a very drinkable pumpkin beer."
"All around a good beer especially for a pumpkin brew, but this could stand a little more work. It poured orange with no fogginess with a white head. The smell was dominated by pumpkin. Taste was good with subtle hints of spices and toasty malts but I must complain that the mouthfeel was way too watery for me. With a little more complexity in the taste this beer will certainly become one of my mainstays when the wind is whipping."
"Pours a light, golden amber color, with rich, thick, slightly off-white foam that leaves good lace down the glass. The smell is pumpkin pie spices, malt, citrus, and floral hops. A modest but good aroma. The taste is mild: hops, some spices, malt, and a lingering light sweetness. The mouthfeel is somewhat light. Medium body. Hoppy but backed by some malt sweetness, and mellowed by the pumpkin. The drinkability is good. This is a nice pumpkin ale, though not as full bodied and rich as some."
"Update: Four years later I am still drinking post Road and it is still the best. I look for it every fall."
"Thanks to Davo for this Halloween treat."
"Not too spicy for a pumpkin ale, very drinkable. Pours a nice amber color, not too dark. Very subtle aroma of spices, cinnamon, nutmeg, slight clove. Just a touch of hops in the taste with a smooth, clean finish. Definitely need more than one. Again, very drinkable. Not bad."
"Orangish, copper color with a low light tan head but decent carbonation. Light spice aroma and light spice flavor; more pumpkin flavor than spicy. A bit too subtle for me; not spicy enough but a good pumpkin flavor. This beer was med bodied and smooth though so would definitely have more than one."
"Pours a nice orange color, with a decent white head that leaves nice lace. Malt in the nose with some spice aroma. Medium body and smooth mouthfeel. I was afraid that the pumpkin flavor would turn me off after a bit, but that was not the case. Tastes like a good ale with pumpkin and spice in the backround. Aftertaste is like a pumpkin pie, but not overwhelming.  Very tasty!"
"Mike"
"Perhaps the most attractive aspect of this beer is the clear glowing orange color.  Warm pumpkin spiciness on the nose, although pumpkins are not predominant in the flavor.  Rather well-balanced ale which doesn't submit to its namesake; good balance of hops and maltiness followed up with the pumpkin flavor and spicy warmth.  Finishes a bit short, though the aftertaste is agreeable.  Not blown away, but a good beer to harken in the fall season."
"Pours a nice orangish copper holor with a creamy white head that leaves a nice lacing down the glass.  Smooth maltiness in the nose with a less overpowering spiciness than others of this kind.  Smooth maltiness eases into the brew with a mellow hoppiness in the background before the roasted pumpkin flavor comes into play.  There is also a slight metallic flavor that lends a crispness to the brew and makes it surprisingly crisp while also staying rather smooth and very drinkable."
"Amber in color with a lacy top, the beer smelled like I had anticipated and hoped. The aroma consisted of malt, pumpkin, and nutmeg. Pumpkin and spice flavors were right there from the start, however the pumpkin wasn't too overwhelming and malt and toasted grains were noticed. It finished nicely bitter from the hops which helped cut down of the noticable sweetness. The only downside to this was after my senses became used to the pumpkin, the beer started smelling like warm milk. I'm glad to see that the pumpkin was not overdone in this one. Nice medium body and appropriate carbonation, I would say overall I really enjoyed this expereince."
"I love this beer. Beautiful orange/amber, perfectly fitting the style of beer. Smells very nice, like ginger and spices, but not overpowering. Initially has a wonderful hop flavor, followed in the end by a warm taste of pumpkin, cinnamon and spice. A wonderful brew for a cool fall evening, or really for any other time. I will definitely be buying more of this."
"Still, I somehow seem to be chasing the memory of a terrific pumpkin ale I had years ago (I dont recall the brand).  Nothing seems to measure up to memory."
"well, it's better than bill's pumpkin ale, but i just do not understand the pumpkin ale thing. i don't like pumpkin pie, and it is much worse in a beer. a few of my buddies loved this, so i gave it a try. it was a big mistake. again, it is better than the other pumpkin i have had, but it is still just not right to me"
"The body is light-medium with a restrained carbonation that helps to accentuate the maltiness rather than the spiciness. The mouthfeel is gently crisp. The flavor is obviously spicy, but reveals some soft fruity maltiness as well. The bitterness is appropriately light, allowing the spice to counteract the sweetness of the malt. Very well balanced. The finish is fairly short, with a lingering spiciness. Throughout the glass, however, the spice tends to build on the palate. Still, a very nice beer with alot of finesse. A nice change of pace."
"Light amber with an orange hue; thick, smooth white head. Nutmeg and cinnamon spiciness dominate the nose, with a little malty sweetness underneath. Low carbonation; mouthfeel is quite slick and creamy. The pumpkin spices are also the dominant feature of the taste; what's nice is that you get the essence of pumpkin pie without the sweetness (I don't find this a particularly malty beer). A crisp hop bitterness follows the spiciness, and the spices return going into a relatively short finish. A fall seasonal that would also be a nice treat on a winter's night. I'll be picking up more of this brew."
"A nice little fall brew; as others have stated, it's a bit like having some pumpkin pie in a bottle. Golden amber in color with a nice, sticky white head. Aromas of pumpkin pie spices (nutmeg, cinnamon). Just a hint of pumpkin in the taste; nutmeg and cinnamon are the most pronounced flavors, but they're not overwhelming. Some malty sweetness, again somewhat pie-like. Leaves a bit a spicy grittiness in your mouth. A nice treat at this time of year, though I can only drink one at a time."
"Pours a bright orange copper color, with a small but steady cream head.  On the nose there is spices, nutmeg, coriander, and hint of caramel. Mouthfeel is smooth.  On the palate it tastes like pumpkin pie but it not overly done, earthy hop character, spices, nutmeg, coriander, nice underlying malt sweetness, bready, caramel.  Finish is grainy and sweet.  A nice fall seasonal, and a tasty treat!"
"Pours with a thin, pearl head that stayed throughout the entirety. bright orange color. The nose is enormous with ginger and pumkin pie. First taste, little too cold, which hid the malt and most of the pumpkin flavoring. Very hoppy and too much yeast character, but as it warmed it became very well balanced with nice finish."
"A sticky off-white head is what you'll get after pouring this into the glass, sitting atop brilliant orangey-gold liquid. Nose is redolant of pumpkin pie spices (of course). Malty sweet undertones follow the spiciness. Taste is crisp, pumpkin pie-ish, with hoppiness making a good showing! Finishes sweet then drying out nicely...a treat to drink on the cool nights of late Summer/early Fall."
"I thought I wasn't going to like this, but I did.  What a treat..it was like pumpkin' pie in beer form.  A beer to enjoy on a cool fall evening.  Good for one or two, but hardly a session beer.  Taste of pumpkin is there, but doesn't overpower the beer.  A fun beer."
"Good drinking for a spiced brew, 100 times better than Buffalo Bills Pumpkin pee. I think this beer is better now that Brooklyn Brewery has it under its wing."
"Notes: One of the better pumpkin ales to be had ... pumpkin pie all over. It's generally hard to have more than one pumpkin ale in a row, however this one is pretty damn drinkable."
"It's like drinking a Pumpkin Pie and just as rich.  This beer has a wonderful nutmeg and pumpkin aroma and flavor.  Not sweet; they kept this a nice ale and did not try too hard to make this into a liquid dessert.  Although I like this beer, a few a season is enough for me."
"Clear copper. Tight tan head. Toasty malted grain and spice aroma. Flavors blend well...one single component doesn't dominate. Well constructed brew that evenly displays maltiness and spiciness...cinnamon, nutmeg. Very tasty and a nice holiday changeup. I don't think I could drink more than 1 or 2 of these at one sitting though."
"Great spiced beer.  Nicely balanced and the aroma is to die for.  Will go great with Thanksgiving dinner."
