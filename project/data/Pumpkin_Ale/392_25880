4.41,13.4,4,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Imperial Pumpkin Ale brewed by Weyerbacher Brewing Co. This brew has an 8.00% ABV. The pour on this brew is a nice cloudy, deep, amber color, with a small off white head.  Imperial Pumpkin Ale smell is rich with pumpkin and spices. You also pick up on some grains and malts in the smell  of this brew. The taste is bold with flavor of pumpkin and spices. This brew puts you in the mind of a pumpkin pie. The mouthfeel is bold, rich and full of flavor. There is nothing overpowering in this brew, it has a nice balance to it.  This brew goes down smooth. Overall I'm giving this brew a 4.5 out of 5. Weyerbacher Brewing Co. did a nice job with this brew.  I would buy this brew again.","nicholas2121","Jan 09, 2015"

Extremely sweet like pumpkin pie on the palate, very smooth body with a spicy (think red hots and cinnamon) mid-palate.  Finishes on notes similar to some of the cinnamon whiskeys that are currently in vogue.  An excellent choice if you like pumpkin ales that take the pumpkin pie challenge at face value.","droomyster","Oct 29, 2014"

It's a big beer, but a bit too big for its britches. The alcohol is hard to miss in this brew, a shame since I've had a few "imperial" pumpkin ales that specialize in hiding the alcohol and accentuating the pumpkin or spice characteristics. Not a bad choice, and one I'd like to try again, but one that I don't think makes it to the top of my list of pumpkin brews.","logicalparadox","Sep 19, 2014"

4,2.8,,,,,,"Pours orange and a,most opaque except for a haze that let light in and made this beer a bit of pastel. Nose is ginger, bright ginger and nutmeg. Not too much cinnamon and thank goodness for that. bit of allspice and clove and lastly cinnamon. This beer has the bitter scent of the actual pumpkin on it via touch of grass from hops. Lovely. Weyerbacher has deliiverd quite the abv in this beer. 8% to warm a bit as it finishes. But first. A bold pumpkin flavor with a bit of sourness or of twang if you will . Like the pumpkin and like the pumpkin pie. It has a dry crust for malt. Dry, floury and not too sweet. So a biscuit malt. Lightly over the top is a touch of bright honey to go with he bright ginger and now I am really excited. No diacetyl except in the mouthfeel. A bit of buttery sensation adds to this creamy beer with a decent bitterdespite itâ€™s abv. A touch of hop grass and bitter finish this one like a surprise and WOW a great Imperial pumpkin ale from wyerbacher that tastes like an ale and has a great abv to kick it home.","utopiajane","Aug 20, 2014"

3.62,-6.9,,,,,,"I really love the aroma of this beer. I was hit with cinnamon, spice, nutmeg and pumpkin pie all layered perfectly. In my opinion, the taste itself doesn't fully live up to it's aroma. It still is pleasant but is a little bit overpowered with spice and nutmeg. Also, I feel the beer isn't as focused on displaying pumpkin flavor. My first taste I got very strong notes of all its other elements, cinnamon, nutmeg, etc.. It just took me a little while to pick out where I found the pumpkin flavor. Don't get me wrong, its a good beer, just not exactly what I prefer.","AyeMito","Aug 18, 2014"

It has a nice mouthfeel but that's about where things go south. Sour mash like taste with a cinnamon follow. Almost like this batch had too much nutmeg or the bottle was bad. Opened a second one with the same results. Really sour with an almost harsh nutmeg aftertaste. I really don't think I'll buy this one again after drinking so many other pumpkin beers this fall that have proved far more enjoyable than this.","wollefdoogylloj","Aug 05, 2014"

I thought I was about to get into something yummy... similar to schlafly's pumpkin.... that nice pumpkin pie, caramelly sweet and chewy goodness. Then the taste. Hmmmm... Defnite pumpkin pie spice - too much for sure. And the base beer... it was as if someone made a poor representation of an amber that was too weak and thin, decided to sour it, gave up after a week and then added pumpkin pie spice. There's also an underlying nasty bitterness that is not good but at least distracts from the rest of the nastiness. Drain pour and then to the Ten Fidy that's on deck.","smchenry75","Nov 07, 2013"

In my opinion a pumpkin beer needs pumpkin flavor, not just spice, and this just doesn't have it. Tastes more like an amber ale with a boatload of pumpkin pie spice.","emyers","Oct 31, 2013"

I think perhaps this could be improved however if it were brewed with a bit more pumpkin to cover up that fact of the high abv. When drinking it, you sure know it is 8%.

The nose is heavy on the cinnamon, but clove and nutmeg is also found in the bouquet. More of a nuttiness than caramel or sugar here, although a nice sweet gingerbread undertone comes out as it warms. Very smooth, although I wouldn't mind a touch more body.

3.88,-0.3,4,3.5,4,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 7/10/2013. Pours slightly hazy reddish copper color with a 1 finger fairly dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin lace cap that lingers. Slight spotty lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of pumpkin, brown sugar, toast, cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, brown bread, raisin, caramel, and herbal earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of malt, pumpkin, and spice notes; with good strength. Taste of big pumpkin, brown sugar, toast, cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, brown bread, raisin, caramel, and herbal earthiness. Lingering notes of brown sugar, toast, pumpkin, cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, caramel, brown bread, raisin, and herbal earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of malt, pumpkin, and spice notes; with a great balance of malt over the spices and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a slick and moderately creamy mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice imperial pumpkin ale. Nice balance and complexity of malt, pumpkin, and spice notes; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Sep 06, 2013"

The nose is full of spices and fleshy pumpkin. The cinnamon and nutmeg are somewhat subdued, but the cardamom is pretty strong and seems slightly out of place for this beer. The taste is somewhat absent of sweetness and is full of spice. Mainly cinnamon and cardamom on the flavor, but it seems to come through more at the end. I am missing any malty backbone to hold up to all of the spices. A slight squashy/fleshy pumpkin character comes through but it doesn't add much character to the brew. Mouthfeel is moderate to heavy with a high level of carbonation. Overall, this is a pretty uninspired pumpkin beer. The ingredients are there, but they don't pop and there seems to be no malt backbone to elevate all of the flavors.","homebrew311","Jan 24, 2013"

The color is a deep clear orange with seamless legs. The kind of legs you want to put stockings on and a lamp shade. Maybe introduce a black light bulb for effect and let Weyerbacher do its thang! Year after year I still think these guys have crafted a well rounded, waiting for x-mas with a buzz on, type of beer.

Unfortunately the head does fall flat quickly once drinking ensues and doesn't provide much lacing past the first minute. The nose is well spiced with semi-bold nutmeg/clove and there is a bite from the alcohol. It's not a particularly sweet smelling beer, but some notes of caramelized sugars do present themselves. The taste is malty, spicy and damn well balanced. This is a very drinkable, well-attenuated, adequately spiced beer and it would probably pair well with just about every seasonal meal I could think of. Definitely a beer I'll keep in mind during the fall season and I will likely visit it again.","ThePorterSorter","Sep 15, 2012"

Copper orange colored liquid, a few trace bubbles zip about, yellows around the rims, pleasing overall clarity. Given the richness of its pungency the nose has a stiff texture and feel, plenty of pumpkin there, more so cinnamon, clove spice and something reminiscent of cola, also some lemon citrus and well baked pie crust notes, rises deep into your nostrils and stays there for some time. Medium-bodied, equally firm feel here in the mouth, the carbonation more muscular than expected based on visual inspection. Mixes some milk chocolate into those baking spices, sort of softens things a touch. The pumpkin is strong without being really sweet. Biscuit, scone with a moment of cornbread, here thereâ€™s a stronger honeyed aspect. The floral dimension expands through the finish, extending things further. The level of spicing is pretty outrageous so if you want lowkey or demure, this is not for you. Otherwise, get ready for a spice fest.","farrago","Sep 03, 2012"

Tastes almost like a pumpkin pie with the high alcohol content apparent in the finish. For its dark color, it's surprisingly thin-bodied. Overall, the best pumpkin ale I've had as I have yet to find one that's comparable. A great fall beer and good transition from the blondes and wheats of summer to the malty, spicy winter brews.","Louski","Feb 29, 2012"

Aroma is heavy of the pumpkin and what can best be described as mulling spices. It's very smooth on the tongue and very creamy, almost like pumpkin pie. The kick of spice is a pleasant surprise compared to some more overly sweet pumpkin ales I've tried. Definitely one of the top contenders in this heavily populated seasonal style.","crhensel","Jan 15, 2012"

The aroma is thick and spicy with clove at the forefront. It's quite full bodied and very smooth with a clean, quick finish. It leaves the mouth a little slick after a few sips. It tastes bold and flavorful. There isn't much bitterness and it sits between sweet and dry. The cardamom and clove kind of give it a chai flavor. I can taste the pumpkin right before the finish. It's kind of exotic tasting. This is a stand out pumpkin ale. The cardamom really sets it apart. It's like a pumpkin spiced chai latte beer. Love it.","yesyouam","Dec 09, 2011"

Spicy aromas are delicate enough to allow the pumpkin sweetness to dominate. Buttery smooth feel with the carbonation and maltiness combining to provide a thick, chewy texture. Sweet pumpkin flavor up front and into the middle. Spices kick-in thru the middle and slowy intensify to the finish. Spices are delicate enough so as not to overwhelm the sweet pumpkin maltiness and nicely subdue an underlying booziness. Finishes with a lingering but light, spicy aftertaste.

It smells like the real thing. The flavors all carry over onto the palate, with layers and layers of spice and pumpkin. The cinnamon is particularly pronounced. This is not a style that I personally love, but it is very well done and very drinkable because there is a nice amount of carbonation that keeps the beer lively. It also hides the alcohol well, which, with all of the added flavor, was helpful in keeping the beer from being too heavy.","malloyca","Sep 26, 2011"

The color is a deep brownish-red with about an inch of a head with a vigorous pour, receding to little to no head. There is some lacing. The aroma is very nice dominated by vanilla, nutmeg and cinnamon. The alcohol content is prevalent immediately after the first sip. Like I said, this is good for when you want a beer with a decent 'kick.' The flavor is not as tasty as the nose suggests.

Mouth opens with a touch of pumpkin meat and sugars, segues into a lightly spicy finish with gobs of pumpkin meat. Just dry enough but genuine and pleasantly robust throughout. Hops are minimal and act to compliment the pumpkin flavors into a kind of crusty flavor. Some slight lingering off flavors on the finish but that's pretty much my only knock on this.

Spices are defentatley present in the tast but not overwhelmingly so that a bit of pumpkin doesnt come through(wich sometimes i find a problem with other pumpkin ales).

4.24,9,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"The body is a translucent orange and brown color with some lighter pumpkin-colored hues in the thinner regions of the glass. The head was small off the pour, a fingerâ€™s-breadth at best, and faded relatively quickly to nothing but a ring around the surface of the liquid. The smell is wonderful; nutmeg, cinnamon, clove, cardamom, some pumpkin, and even a faint vanilla. The taste is similar, with a bit of the faint pumpkin in the front before the rush of aforementioned spices dominate. A bit of a warming alcohol finish along with the faintest vanilla flavor. Honestly, this is like someone took pumpkin pie, slapped vanilla ice cream on top, and found a way to bottle it. The mouth is rich in flavor, but not overly thick and does not leave any kind of sugary film behind. Very well done. Exactly what I had hoped it would be, and I certainly wish I had more.","eclipse54","Sep 12, 2011"

Good blend of spices and good job on achieving a natural pumpkin flavor. Cloves and nutmeg take over with cinnamon certainly noticeable. Not overdone by any means. A subtle aftertaste of the spices resides. A smooth imperial ale for an 8% abv with no detection of alcohol whatsoever. Not as heavy as I expected with medium carbonation. This is a good pumpkin ale that I think hit most of the marks. The bottle label is creepy also; that king pumpkin with the robe.

A nice crystal malt center gives a bready roundness and full ale taste. Spices bracket the pumpkin a with the cinnamon in the front and the nutmeg giving a fullness to the flavor. A touch of alcohol shows itself and fades away. Finish is dry and clean with a lingering hop leafiness. Feel is crisp and well carbonated. Medium weight and quite supple.

Secondly, with its spiciness-on both its aroma and its taste- it's a beer that's tough to imagine drinking several of. Although, I will say, since it's warmed up, the medicinal edge has worn off, at least making it easier to drink. With that all said, again, it's hard to imagine drinking this beer all night. A well made beer? Sure. Flavorful? Definitely. But one that I'd want to drink all night? Not really.

This is my favorite tasting pumpkin ale on the market, follows right in line with the smell but to a greater extent. Its more of a "spicy" pumpkin, but I find the pumpkin flavor shows its face plenty in this ale. A nice, creamy mouthfeel and moderate carbonation makes this my favorite beer in the style. A big enough pumpkin ale, that I can really only enjoy 1 of these in a night, hence the lower drinkability score.

First sip is a smooth blend of pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves...basically a mirror image of the aroma. The combination of spice lingers after the swallow. Hops pretty much take a back seat here, this one's all pumpkin-y malt & spices, but done well...quite well, in fact!. Mouth feel is bold and spicy, with a nice sparkle on the tongue and the alcohol being totally hidden. This is a beer that is quite drinkable.

It smells strongly of cloves, with some of the malt and pumpkin sweetness coming through. The other spices that are used (cinnamon, nutmeg, etc.) don't seem to come through as much. The beer tastes like Halloween, a holiday mainly composed of cloves, nutmeg, and pumpkin with malt, and a hint of cinnamon. Unfortunately the mouthfeel comes up pretty thin for me. It has good drinkability, but would probably be better if I had had it in October or November instead of the beginning of September (I won't fault the beer because I did not have the good sense to wait to drink it).","Agold","Sep 06, 2010"

Lacking body, though it does have some great complexities of sweet pecans, dry figs and bitter cinnamon. Mouthfeel is a tad thin also as I was expecting a much heavier brew.

The smell hits me with the pumpkin flavour right away, then the ginger, nutmeg, coriander and all the other wonderful aromas that we associate with Nana's homemade pumpkin pie. The taste does not disappoint, and when one considers the ABV it becomes patently obvious that Weyerbacher has created a pumpkin brew is a head above the rest. The pumpkin flavour is still present and pleasant, and all the other previously mention spices are hanging out as well, throwing a thanksgiving party in my mouth. The high ABV does not make this beer any less wonderful at all. This was not a case of someone simply "alcoholing up" an already existing recipe, the alcohol is barely noticeable, and the full feeling of the flavours makes this an incredibly enjoyable experience.","jamiesessions","Nov 13, 2009"

Great flavor on this one with the spiciness being held in check by a creamy, sweetness almost like whipped cream on pumpkin pie. The fruit and sweetness come first with nutmeg and cinnamon following and leading into a light hop-derived drying finish. Feels a bit sticky in the mouth and a semi-low carbonation doesn't help issues but decent nonetheless.

3.9,0.3,4,4,4,3,4,"I love the look of this beer in my glass - orange/red in color, very small lacing around the glass, virtually no carbonation bubbles. Taking a big wiff I'm definitely picking up the nutmeg, cinnamon aromas followed with a faint smell of pumpkin, spices definitely dominate the smell. My tongue is picking up everything I was smelling with the addition of carbonation on the front of the tongue. Immediately at the end there's a faint zing of hops followed by a slight boozy warmth (but not much) and the flavors dissipate quickly on the tongue - I would like a little more lingering on my palate. This is a good pumpkin ale and Weyerbacher has done a very good job with this year's batch. Overall, it's not as complex and bready as perhaps a few other pumpkin ales, but still pretty darn good. (The Weyerbacher Thirteen is insanely complex.) I would like a little more bready/chewiness as the mouthful feels a tad more thin than what I'd prefer for this style. Not overly bready or hoppy, it sits in between hoppiness and sweetness, definitely more towards the sweet side. I'm appreciating pumpkin ales more and this is one I could have a few of in one sitting, however, the alcohol will creep up on you quite quickly so beware. Sip and enjoy.","jzeilinger","Oct 09, 2009"

There is a thin tan head atop the beer. Appropriately, it has a strong pumpkin aroma, but there's also some spice in there, maybe cloves? The pumpkin flavor is impressive. It sneaks up on you, starting out slow, and finishing with a flavor that lingers after you swallow. The beer has an average body and carbonation; nothing exceptional but still of high quality.

The finish was balanced with enough hops and the overall effect was impressive but not overwhelming. The body was medium, the mouthfeel smooth and the mouthfeel perfect. Once again, a stunning offering from this top-notch operation.","thekevlarkid","Jan 08, 2009"

The aroma is heavy with spice, too much so, but I chose to drink this Weyerbacher Imperial Pumpkin because I wanted something a little over-the-top. Well, It delivered, right up my nose. Very spicy on the palate as well. Tongue tingling alcohol mixed with an overspiced pumpkin pie. Lots of nutmeg and cinnamon. Maybe pumpkin pie filling straight from the can. After what seems like a lot of complaining, I actually like this concoction. Not for everyday consumption, but a much better example than most of the easily found Pumpkins on the market.

The pumpkin taste comes out a little more in the lingering aftertaste, so I look forward to many a pumpkin burp. The high level of carbonation makes this pretty easy to drink. It is a little sticky in the throat, however, detracting a bit from the feel. Overall, one of the better pumpkin beers I've had.

Taste is similarly heavy on the cloves and nutmeg, slightly dry, with a bit of a warming alcohol on the back end. Cloves are stronger than perhaps is warranted, but not overwhelming.

Damn bottle volcanoed on me, messing up the decant, hence my glass is full of particulates. The beer is reddish/auburn and very carbonated for the first two minutes, building up a fizzy inch of head, but soon after it is nearly lifeless, with a tiny collar that doesn't lace the glass. Cardamom and cinnamon are the first aromas to hit, followed by the other two spices, a dose of cola, and light hops and malt. Flavor-wise, pumpkin and cardamom start the show, then it's cinnamon and light malts. There's also some mild hop bitterness, but no real hop flavor, all on top of a light/medium body that is very dry and carbonated on the tongue. A decent pumpkin with nice spices, but it needs more actual pumpkin flavor. In addition, the yeast is too clean and attenuative, thinning the body more than I'd like. If you like pumpkin ales try this one out, but if not, you can pass.","mmmbeer","Mar 20, 2008"

Flavor is nice, typical spices associated with the style, but not as robustly flavored and intense as I expected. Mouthfeel is great, and nicely thick, which most pumpkins seem to lack, and the alcohol is hidden well and only peeks out minimally.

Lots of visible carbonation was apparent, as was a nice three finger head of foamy white lace, which receded very slowly and left concentric rings of lace down the sides of the glass. The aroma was enchanting, full of pumpkin spice and cinnamon, it was very full with no sense of the alcohol. The flavor was great, a very full balanced attack of spice, with a decidedly malty grain back bone, that was just strong enough to peak its head through and let you know it was there. Great smooth finish left you thirsting for another sip. The feel was a nice creamy medium body that had ample carbonation. Overall this was wonderful and was every bit as good as I thought it would be. A full frontal assault of spices, cinnamon and nutmeg galore e with a great balanced feel and a well hidden alcohol.

The spices were much more pronounced in the aroma than in the taste which was disappointing. Felt good in the mouth. Consistency was good, just solid enough to coat the mouth.

Again, taste of nutmeg, cinnamon and perhaps some clove. Smooth, malty mouthfeel with very little astringence considering the 8.0% ABV. A very pleasant seasonal brew.

This was very nice and would be great with spicy fare, especially cuisine that embraces tradition holiday spices as everyday in their recipes, as well as with some really sharp, dry cheddar or go completely 180 degrees with some rich, soft, creamy Bleu.

I've drank a couple bombers of this already, but haven't taken the time to review it. It pours a very appealing reddish-orange, in other words, a solid pumpkin color. Very rich. Tall white head with good retention. Leaves rings of lace all around the glass. Smells very strongly of warm, almost roasted pumpkin, plus some rich pie spices, such as the cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves. You can smell the alcohol, too. Tastes are phenomenal; the best I've ever had in a pumpkin ale. This is what I've been looking for! Again with the roasted pumpkin and the spices. Little alcohol bite. A nice touch of bitterness on the back of the tongue, which balances out the sweetness. Overall wonderful flavors. Like seriously drinking a pie of liquid pumpkin pie. Nice, creamy mouthfeel: not as thick as a stout, but smooth like a Maibock. So smooth that I swear they used oats in the mash. This is a fantastic Pumpkin Ale, probably the best one I've ever come across. It's flavors and aromas are rich and bold, but not overpowering. Weyerbacher has really committed to the style, rather than just cramming spices in or using a pumpkin additive. I will definitely return to this one again and again.

The taste is similar, but a little more subdued than the wonderful aroma. Still a nice spiciness, but it falls off a little and creamy and slightly sour pumpkin takes over.

The alcohol is well hidden by the spices and fruit. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a full bodied beer with less than adequate carbonation.

Great looking ale; deep reddish brown, with a creamy, fluffy, off-white head. Big nose with pumpkin pie spices and carmelized malts. Creamy texture. Loaded with pumpkins. Spicy with the likes of cloves, nutmeg, cinnamon, maple sugar, vanilla. Full sized ale body. IBUs maybe in the low 20s, so hops don't play much of a part here. Pumpkin sweetness is dominant in the aftertaste. Man I love the beer and pumpkin combo, a match made in heaven. Great for anyone regardless of beer drinking experience.

It seems to hit all the highlites for a pumpkin beer. The flavor strong in the spicing with nutmeg, which is followed by an alcohol solventyness. I feel that the alcohol covers up the fleshy pumpkin flavor that I get hints of, but find hidden. Its okay. The mouthfeel is thick with a light carbonation. It really feels full.

There is a nice tingly pepperiness that comes in mid taste and mixes with the dry finish and a small alcohol burn at the back of the throat.

Medium to full bodied with soft carbonation. Alcohol is completely masked. Quite nice. Whether it's by addition of pumpkin or a wise choice of yeast, the fruitiness in this beer really carries the day.

Aroma was all about the spice, mainly clove and nutmeg. The pumpkin was hiding quite effectively until almost the end of the beer. Hops were fairly strong, and the malt was barely noticeable with everything else going on. Finally, you got a definate whiff of alcohol. Taste moves away from the aroma, in that the malt was quite prevalent - a sweet dark bread type of flavor - this was easily the sweetest of the 4 pumpkin ales I tried in this session. The hops were secondary, but quite present at the finish. This, combined with the spices and a peppery aftertaste gave a pretty good bite at the end. Other tasting notes included alcohol/medicinal flavors, clove, and mint. To me, a pumpkin flavor was not really in the mix, but you picked it up a little in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel was medium in body, fairly light carbonation, and creamy. Alcohol made for a rather drying finish.

Smells very sweet, like honeyed, spiced, pumkpin pie, or maybe even a little artificial like one of those holiday candles. Not awful though. Bam -- the spices really hit you hard up front, with the pungecny of the clove and nutmeg packing the biggest wallop. You don't get a while lot of earthiness from pumpkin, but you do get alot of sugar and therefore alcohol and sweetness. Really velvety smooth mouthfeel. It's an after-dinner beer, make no mistake, big and malty, and heavily spiced. I wouldn't want more than the 22 oz. bottle I had in a sitting, and probably would prefer about 10 oz. But it was good.
