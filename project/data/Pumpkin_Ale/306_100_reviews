"Not really much pumpkin flavor.  Not the best offering for the style."
"One of the better Blue Moon seasonals I've had; so nicely balanced in its spices and drinkability that it gives some of the more recent Shock Top offerings I've had (Honey Bourbon Cask Wheat, Lemon Shandy) a run for their money."
""
""
"Really good fall time beer. Watch the leaves turn color and drink this beer"
"Below average pumpkin ale for the style"
""
"Can live without this one. Doesn't have the great pumpkin flavor you would expect from this seasonal brew."
""
""
"Admittedly, I don't care for pumpkin beers, and I only drank this to help a friend empty out his beer fridge, but this still wasn't a very good take on the style."
""
""
""
"Not a bad pumpkin brew"
""
""
""
"Not the best pumpkin beer. Lacks on spice and too sweet"
""
"We like the fact that the hops dont take over the flavor profie. Good drinking beer."
"I'm a big fan of this Pumpkin Ale!"
""
""
""
"Smells great, if not a tad artificial on the pumpkin. Taste is good, but not enlightening. Points off for weak head, lack of body, and overcarbonation."

"Overall this is just a pretty weak beer. It's not terrible in any particular aspect, but it is just completely mediochre or less in every way. The aroma is not very strong, the taste seems slightly off, the beer seems a little too watery perhaps. I've definitely had worse pumpkin ales, but you could do much better than this brew."
"Has a great dark taste of spices and pumpkin. Great reason why I love the fall season. But this beer isn't too great in hot weathers"
""
"This is not a pumpkin ale. Maybe they added pumpkin - maybe they forgot to add it to the batch... Maybe a hint of spice.... Tastes like a basic brown ale to me. Not bad, though. It's good, but not what I'm looking for in the fall."
""
""
""
""
"Smooth, and relaxing. Not bad for the money."
"Not as good as Pumking but it has its qualities."
""
""
"Not a bad Pumpkin Ale. Certainly had worse...but had much better too."
""
""
"Solid pumpkin beer that doesn't do much yet doesn't suck."

"Blue Moon Harvest Moon Pumpkin Ale brewed by Coors Brewing Company. This brew has an ABV of 5.70%  Harvest Moon Pumpkin Ale pours out of the bottle, a nice light brown color with an off white head. The smell is rich with pumpkin and spices. You also pick up on some grains and sweetness in the smell of  this brew. At first the the taste is bold with flavor. It puts you in mind of pumpkin pie. There is a lot going on in this brew. A lot of bold flavor with a nice clean finish.  The mouthfeel is nice bold and clean.  Nothing bad to say about this brew. Over all I'm giving this brew a 4.25 out of 5. Coors did a nice job with this one. I would buy this brew again."

"orangish color, decent pumpkin flavor, not the strongish flavor in the Pumpkin ales. somewhat sweet"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Sweet and crisp."
""
"8/30...pours consistent clean amber, very low foam. Light buttery pumpkin nose. Faint. Taste is a fake sickly sweet pumpkin pie cookie, no bite whatsoever. Did they add sugar to this? Terribly sweet, all out of balance. Not good. Drain pour."

"Love this beer! Spicy and flavorful without being overwhelming, and the pumpkin flavor comes through without being cloying or artificial. Mouthfeel is medium and smooth with just the right amount of carbonation.  And the alcohol content is perfect to take the chill out of the air on those brisk Autumn afternoons."

"This is one of my favorite macro beers. It's refreshing, sweet, and super drinkable. The flavors are powerfully pumpkin-y and spicy, to the point of coming across as artificial. But artificial in the way that candy and instant ramen taste artificial - comforting and familiar. It feels like a treat to drink this on a hot day, and I wish it was more widely available outside of autumn."

"An okay seasonal for being a Miller/Coors product."

"I was surprised at the differences between the rating items. The brew had a great appearance, except it had no head staying power, the aroma wasn't altogether great, but the mouthfeel was velvety, almost. For the most part, not a notable beer, but not bad either."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Average Pumpkin Beer.  It's very easy to find and cheap and tastes good but nothing to write home about."
""
""
"It was average"
"Drinking straight from the bottle. First pumpkin ale I've drank. Good pumpkin flavor, doesn't overwhelm the palette. The hops compliment the pumpkin flavor very nicely. This pairs well with chocolate, like drinking a chocolate pumpkin muffin. Overall a decent fall beer."
""
"Really?"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a light orange with a fizzy head. The smell was sweet with a little bit of pumpkin on the end. The taste had pumpkin and some spice, but compared to other pumpkin beers it's quite thin. Overall it was okay, but there are plenty of other options this year for good pumpkin beers."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall (3.13) : This was a nice beer. I would probably buy it again but in winter time. For some strange reason I'm getting this feeling of holding a girl for the first time on one of the first chilly nights of autumn. For a beer to recreate that is simply awesome. The taste is spicy and bland, but there's something there that's telling my brain that this is a good brew. I recommend it."
""
""
"Taste - Sweet, spicy and pumpkin-y.  Spicy flavor also tends to the nutmeg and cloves.  Thin and somewhat cloying."
""
""
""
"Spiced aroma. Pours bright copper orange with full white head. Slight lacing of glass. Taste is mild lightly spiced, hint of caramel. No hops, no bitterness. Refreshing, but could use more pumpkin in the mash."

"Good blend of spices for the fall."

"I found this to be an exceptionally bad beer. I had a twelve pack with co-workers and no one finished a bottle. It's now July and still have some in the fridge because we can't give it away. Also note that Michelobe Ultra was an option often chosen over this. It tastes like the great-pumpkin took a crap in glass of miller-light."

""
""
""
""
"This isn't a terrible beer but if you were in the market for a really good pumpkin beer I'd look elsewhere."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not bad. The smell is slightly better than the taste, but not by much. The nutmeg is very clear in the smell. The taste of pumpkin is light, but there's a definite bite to the drink with spices. I'm impressed. Although I wouldn't probably get it again, I am impressed from this Blue Moon offering."

"Pours a pretty amber in color with about a 1-finger off white head. Some spotty lacing was seen with each sip. The aroma is on the light side and is of pumpkin and spices. The taste is actually very pleasant with the spices and you can taste the cloves, cinnamon and nutmeg as well as the pumpkin. No bitter or harsh aftertaste. Good carbonation for this one that wasn't overdone. Overall, better than some other pumpkin ales that I tried and liked this one."
""
""
""
""
"Aroma is a bit light on spice and pumpkin. Taste is very clean with a hint of pumpkin and spice. The wheat body is notable and melds well with the pumpkin and spice overlay. A bit more fuller-bodied than I had expected. Overall, not knocked out by this rather toned-downed and overly-clean seasonal ale. Certainly palatable and quite good, but not optimal for those seeking a more robust pumpkin ale."

"O - Not a bad offering by Coors. I can see where this would appeal to someone drinking a pumpkin beer for the first time. Would do in a pinch although it wouldnt be my first choice when drinking a pumpkin ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Kind of a meh beer. Poured a bit cold with a small to medium size, cream-colored head that soon settled to a large island and ring and no lace. Color is a clear, somewhat lighter orange amber with loads of bubble trails. Aroma is beer, malt and a little pumpkin. Flavor's like nose, with carbonic tang dominating, on the dry side, and leans to bland. Body is controlled by over carbonation. Finish is like flavor which is short lived, but has the long lingering tang. One thing I like is the underplaying of the pumpkin flavor, but they went too far. Forgettable."
""
"Overall: Not a lot of complexity, but has the proper mix of spices. Not as bad as I thought it would be--I've had worse this season."

"Pours a orange amber with a decent head litte lace. The smell is spice a little wheatish and sweet malt. Taste has a little more pumpkin to it then the smell and u can taste the sweet malt with a pie spice blend. The mouthfeel is thicker then expected and has just a touch of sting. Overall is pretty good and prob the best seasonal from blue moon."
""
""
""
""
"Not being a huge fan of anything pumpkin, I was somewhat ambivalent about trying this ale, but I was glad I did. The pumpkin and allspice were lurking behind nicely balanced hops and malt. I don’t know if I’d enjoy more than one or two of these before reaching pumpkin pie overload, but it’s certainly a nice seasonal choice."
""
"O: This was great at first strong pumpkin first, but quickly becomes overwhelming. I recommend trying this if you like pumpkin beers as its got the strongest pumpkin flavor of any beer ive tried."
"To good health and good beer."
""
""
""

""
""

""
""

"Overall, not too bad...i dont think i've ever been disappointed with a blue moon, you know what your going to get with them, quality, but nothing overly special or anything to go crazy over"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I really enjoyed this beer. If you want something for after a meal, or just something for the fall season, I would recommend this brew. Any pumpkin lover will like this. Fact."
""
""
""
"Nice flavor off the bat, full, rich, aflood with spices (cinnmon, ginger, ...cardamom?) riding on top of the palate. Smooth, and malty, little hops, medium body,...and ulimately fading. Nice balance, decent taste, but I'd prefer a little more...then again, this is Coors behind the helm, who aren't normally in the business of challnging tastebuds."
""
""
"Not bad for Blue Moon’s version of a pumpkin beer. I’ve certainly had better, but this wasn’t the worst."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: Is it a pumpkin pie? Not quite. Is it a well crafted, balanced beer? No. Is it perfect for a bonfire party or well-priced backup autumn beer? Heck yes."
""
""

""

"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a orange-copper coloring with a slow flow of carbonation and a scant, filmy, white coating of head that quickly settles out into a ring. Aromas of roasted pumpkin, earthy notes, cinnamon and nutmeg spice, hints of vanilla, and a touch of sweet potato. Can't really fault anybody so far on this beer. Flavors are where things start to go awry. Syrupy and sugary sweet forward flavors of pumpkin come at you ham-handed, with an almost instant cloying. The spice characters are completely drowned out, and the roast notes don't stand a chance in balancing this beer out. I guess the saving grace is that the flavor is almost completely gone from your palate in a matter of seconds. The aftertaste is almost non-existent, with hints of toasted grain and a linger of sugary sweetness. Oily slick body, which helps expedite the disappearance of this beer from your palate, leading to an empty finish that I suppose will be deemed clean. This one started off alright, but the drop off was dramatic."
""
""
""
""
"Gave this another shot and I think they have nailed the formula for this one now. Had a great balance of smell, taste, and drinkability with that warm feeling you want to get form the beers in the cold weather. Give this one a try"
""
"Overall – A decent and rather easy drinking pumpkin ale that is very accessible and rather affordable."
""
""
""
""
"O: Decent pumpkin brew – worthy of a try."
""
""
""
"Poured an almost bright orange amber, with a thin ring of white head that quickly dissipated to nothing, leaving no lacing. The same look of every other pumpkin ale. Scents of pumpkin, pumpkin pie spices that I cannot accurately separate and sweetness. It's a typical, sweet pumpkin ale scent. Taste is sweet, with prominent pumpkin and the same undifferentiated pumpkin pie spices, but with some slight undertones of cinnamon and nutmeg. Some caramel malt flavors throughout and a bit of wheat cracker on the finish with a toasted malt aftertaste. Not bad, but a bit sweet, like most pumpkin ales, the wheat cracker is a nice addition to the flavor profile of an otherwise standard pumpkin ale. Mouthfeel is light bodied with moderate carbonation, about what I expected from a pumpkin ale. Overall it's a standard pumpkin ale, with all the good and bad that comes with the style. It manages to separate itself slightly due to the addition of wheat malt, but it's not enough to raise it above """It's a pumpkin ale.""" status."

"O - It's an ok pumpkin beer. Good enough for its price tag."
""
""

"O: This beer just average. It doesn't try anything new. I would say it is a good starter pumpkin beer for someone who has never had one before."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"There isn't really anything wrong with the beer as it tastes like a run of the mill dark beer. Instead of crafting a pumpkin beer as a new recipe, it would appear that the beer is a clone of an existing product with a bunch of spices thrown in."
""
""
"Ok so I am no Beer """Supreme Abbot""" but at least I know what I like when I taste it and Harvest Pumpkin Ale is a solid and respectably well tasting brew with lots of midrange appeal, sure its not as aggressive compared to others in this style range but it doesn't have to be, you want pumpkin, Its there, you want Spice its there you want to drink a ale that fits well within the constructs of a """golden sunny day""" with the family in a farm picking harvest fare during a crisp october or november day, culminating in those Libra sky's the Autumn is known for, its all there, in my """Humble Beerpinion""" are there better representative brews of this style? Of course but they might be off putting and too aggressive for most making an entry into """Craft Beer", those who are looking to test their taste buds in pumpkin """aleville""" will find no injustice here and perhaps may discover a gateway to more complex offerings as palates evolve. Blue Moon Harvest Pumpkin Ale Not a bad Brew just not the best but good enough to make you taste the Festiveness of the season and it offerings!"
""
""
""
"Overall - Not a bad pumpkin ale, but too thin and not flavorful enough to really contend with higher quality craft beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"12oz bottle from a 6er poured into a tulip for full aroma. Not much of a head and what did stick around was very soapy. Has a nice copper color, however. First prominent aroma is that of a homemade pumpkin pie with obviously plenty of spices. Pumpkin and cinnamon are huge in the taste, but don't overpower the beer. I do enjoy the nutyness that this one packs. Mouthfeel is a bit on the watery side but I don't expect anything else with the label """Blue Moon""" on it. Overall a nice fall brew. Don't go out of your way to get one, but don't pass on it either."

"Just your average run of the mill pumpkin ale. Nothing real special here and no real pumpkin taste. This is from Blue moon which is a wannabe """craft beer""" made by Miller Coors! Had to try it! Taste is very faint, mouth feel is a little bitter but not bad! Smell is very faint almost not there. Overall Blue Moon did not put forth a huge effort on this beer but when do they really???"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Of the few pumpkin ales that I've had, this is my favorite (the other two pumpkin ales I've tried prior to this one were Shipyard's Pumpkin Head and Brooklyn's Post Road Pumpkin Ale). Feels like drinking pumpkin pie. Quite enjoyable but I wouldn't have more than a couple of these in one sitting. I wouldn't need to have this beer available year-long, but would look forward to its arrival each year."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A very welcome surprise from Blue Moon. I think of them, and I see the scores on here, and was expecting something very ordinary. What I got instead was a very enjoyable six-pack that I will probably buy again before they go out of season."
""
"After trying this beer in a restaurant I bought a 6 pack. It must have been from an entirely different batch. This time the pumpkin and spice aroma was very strong, and the flavor was extremely sweet and syrupy. Carbonation was almost non existent and it poured up with no head at all. Maybe this was just a bad bottle. Not sure, but now I am hesitant to even open the remainder, however I will in order to give this beer a third chance."
""
""
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: I've tried (and home-brewed) many pumpkin beers and have come to a few conclusions about the style. The first is that there are a few different types of pumpkin beers, with Blue Moon's Harvest Pumpkin Ale falling into the 'spiced pumpkin' category (as opposed to the 'pumpkin puree' or 'pumpkin pie' group). The second thing I've realized, based on personal taste, is that a pumpkin beer is either excellent or decent. I've just never had a bad one. That's why, for me, Harvest Pumpkin Ale falls in line with many other decent pumpkin beers. It drinks like a pedestrian attempt and the style, which is just fine because it's good. I'd definitely recommend this one to any Amber Ale drinkers looking to broaden their horizons. Would I drink it again? Yep, one of the only Blue Moon products I can say that about."

"Pours burnt orange/amber with a thin khaki head, which disappears quickly. Watery pumpkin aroma, with hints of allspice and cinnamon. Slightly artificial smelling. In the taste you get more of that watery pumpkin. Hints of cinnamon are in there as well, but that's about it. Lots of carbonation here, way too much. The carbonation overwhelms the majority of the notes, what little there are. Blue moon actual make some alright brews but this one could use a tune up."

"Overall- Enjoyable but i've tried better pumpkin beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall a solidly-average pumpkin. I would get it again - kinda nice to have a decent one that isn't huge alcohol to drink for football games and holiday get togethers."
""

""

"The feel is okay; it's a little thin in the body, but it's crisp without being too crisp and has a bit of smoothness pulling through."

"It's getting cooler, the Bears are losing: definitely pumpkin beer season. This one pours a clear auburn topped by a finger of off-white foam. The nose comprises light graham cracker, light cinnamon, and light clove. The taste brings in more of the same, with a slight underlying vein of stale gingerbread. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slick feel. Overall, a decent enough little pumpkin beer, though not something I could see drinking many of, no matter how bad the Bears are doing."

"the appearance of Blue moon harvest moon pumpkin ale is a clear dark orange with minimal head and not a lot of lacing. It smells of a slight pumpkin spice with a hint of smokey cinnamon in the aftertaste. Its just an average pumpkin ale but has some hops to it as well."

"This beer pours up a saturated amber color with a initial one finger off color fluffy head which dissipates quickly and no lacing. Smell is very strong pumpkin spice, clove, and bananas. Taste is a fizzy metallic up front followed by an overpowering unpleasant pumpkin tasting bitterness. Mouthfeel is kind of thin, but the aftertaste is just awful. Maybe I just don't care for pumpkin, but I'd pass on this if it ever comes my way again."

"Overall - Try it once, maybe. It is powerfully sweet, doesn't even really resemble beer all that much. I think they sweetened the recipe this year, because I don't remember it being that strong last year. Either way, I won't buy it again. A poor offering from a generally good Blue Moon product line."

"I really thought this beer was going to fall flat. It definitely blew my expectations out of the water."
""
""
"This is an average pumpkin beer. I would recommend many other over this one, but this one works for tailgates and hanging around the campfire."
"a way overly spiced pumpkin beer in my opinion. on tap at dave and busters, this one pours a nice amber shade with a faint orange glow and a fleeting off white head. the nose is nutmeg and clove, a little vanilla, and red and caramel malts. no squash to speak of. the same is true of the flavor, where the heavy spice dose totally crowds out any real pumpkin thats in this beer. its very desserty, like a pumpkin pie, seasonally okay, but to me id like to see more of the actual pumpkin. all the spice makes it a tough beer to session, even though the body is just medium and the carbonation is good. its not a bad beer, dont get me wrong, and definitely better than some of the other blue moon seasonals, but ive come to like my pumpkin beers to showcase the vegetable, not the spice, and this one is just too spice based for me. others may disagree."

"O: For a twist off cap, I thoroughly enjoyed this beer. Im not buying that they use real pumpkin from vines, but it is a nice artificial pumpkin pie flavor with a good balance of sweetness and blandness."

"O - Blue Moon nails it on the head with their Harvest Pumpkin Ale. As a gateway craft brewery, their beers appeal to those looking to expand beyond the light, fizzy swill into something with more flavor and presence. Pumpkin ales can be daunting at times as not everyone cares for the gourd, but Blue Moon succeeded in making an approachable fall seasonal which neither excels nor fails. Instead, this beer is completely content to revel in it's mediocrity."
""
"Ok, I will say it, this is my favorite pumpkin beer for a few reasons. It seems to have a more balanced taste than a few others. The pumpkin and spices do not overwhelm the beer flavor and vice versa. Another factor is the price. $12.99 for a 12 pack is joy in a box. It tastes good and not over priced. I will buy more and stock pile to get my fix for the winter."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, too much wheat, and little pumpkin for me. It's also too sweet. The spices are generic and this beer feels like it's brewed from a massive company. Oh ..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This was my first try at a pumpkin beer. Amber Color lit pumpkin smell. Head was thick enough to float the cap. Finish with the taste of pumpkin spice. Nice finish with no bitter after taste. Just like a nice slice of pumpkin pie. Not to bad for a beer from the big breweries."

"O: Well it was decent, the body hurts the flavor, and the carbonation can come off as intrusive at times. So while I still haven't found that wonderful pumpkin ale, I'm always happy to review and know about a brew. Though it's far from terrible I wouldn't recommend it or buy."
""
""
"I won't go into the Yuppy classifications : ASTMO...if you want pretentiousness check Google. I will keep it unadulteratingly real: this beer is good-quality pumpkin. Not the best, but drinkable, and worth the money spent. I have a bigger problem with the ass-clowns trying to act like like they know what """good beer""" is. Fuk 'Em! and Fuk' Em good!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A good, if unremarkable, seasonal beer. Certainly a solid choice to serve at an autumn gathering, though drinkability suffers somewhat on account of the spicy aftertaste. It seems to lack some of the complexity in flavor that makes other seasonal brews so enjoyable, while the flavors that do emerge can tend to be overpowering, particularly in the aftertaste. I wouldn't refuse one of these beers if handed to me, but given a cooler full of options I might dig around in the ice for a while before grabbing one of these."
""
"Overall: Not really impressed, this was simply just a """seasonal""" flavor added to a Coors like all of the other Blue Moon beers, at least thats what I think. I really want to like the Blue Moon brews, I think they need to be more origanal with their brews and it might be better."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Definitely an average pumpkin ale. The pumpkin isn't quite as dominating in this beer as in most pumpkin ales, which is kind of a nice change. However, there just isn't really anything there to take its place. It's not bad, but it's nothing I'd seek out regularly."
"Nice fall beer"
"O – this beer is no exception to my distaste of pumpkin ales, but I always try to give newer ones a fair go. I’d really like it if the spice was almost overwhelming."
""
"Buckeyenation got it right….”tastes like it was brewed by Coors”…and it was"
""
""
""
""
""
"I sampled this beer along with another similar choice (New Holland Ichabod Ale) and found it average. There was a hint of smell and taste of pumpkin and had a mild sweetness to it less evident than the Ichabod Ale. The bottle presentation was average at best too."
""
"Probably won't go looking for this one next season."
""
""
""
""
"Years ago, before Coors took completely over. When this ale was produced in Tenn. I seem to remember a fuller pumpkin ale flavor. Now it seems to be a little watered down. Nothing terreble just nothing exciting, This Pumpkin ale seems to be better as an introduction to the style. Basically, for anyone who is a not a beer need."
"O: Not a particularly good beer, but not awful. Major problems were with the sticky mouthfeel and the heavy spices - not something you could drink a few of in a row, but it still lacks the heartiness of a good porter or stout."

" Like the rest of Blue Moon's offerings, it's an attempt to make beer palatable to the widest possible audience, making it the safest, least offensive, lowest-common-denominator beer you will find. In other words, it's the Nickelback of beer. It's drinkable, but that's the nicest thing I can bring myself to say about it."

"O: A decent fall seasonal beer. Kind of reminds me of Leinie's Oktoberfest. Enjoy by the campfire."
""

""
""
"Poured into a pint glass. Pours copper with a thick off-white head that dissipates at a moderate pace. There are some visible tiny bubbles in the beer. I detect faint aromas of those pumpkin pie spices (cloves, allspice, and nutmeg). I get some of the malt in the smell as well. There is some mild pumpkin flavor in the beer and I get the malt with just some of those pumpkin pie spices. Everything about the flavor is mild, but this is certainly more of a malty pumpkin ale. The body is light with moderate carbonation. The finish is crisp and clean. This is an average beer and not a good representation of the style."
"Pours a hazy burnt orange, moderate cap of off-white foam, gone quickly. Pale notes of grain blend with mild pumpkin and firm seasonal cinnamon, clove and ginger. Taste very light, mild notes of pumpkin and spice on a weakly malted base beer. Fizzy, light. Not one of the best representations of a pumpkin ale... simply a weak, fizzy beer with a splash of the season."

"O: the aroma and drink-ability give this beer a slightly above average rating, otherwise it's a standard pumpkin ale"

"The beer pours a water-clear amber orange with a lot of bubbles racing to the top, and some chillaxing on the side of the glass. There was a nice cream head after the pour but it dissipates quickly leaving a light fringe of lacy cream white bubbles, but a swirl of the glass does rejuvenate a fourth of a finger of head. The beer smells light pumpkin aroma, underlying with nutmeg cinnamon, and cloves. There is a ghost of a wheat malt spice and some roasted malts that oddly wet the nose at the back of the smell, but other than that this beer is all spice and pumpkin, and perhaps a touch of alcohol that burns at the nose, which I find odd for such a low alcohol beer. The beer tastes bitterly fruity with pumpkin and the flavor eating bite of the spices which leave a slight spice-burn tingle on the tongue. The taste is much like the smell in terms of spices, and there are no real surprises hear. The pumpkin tastes a little unripe on the tongue and leaves a bitter bite on the aftertaste that I associate with unripe fruit. Very faint hints of spice are found from the wheat, and a weird syrupy sweet flavor actually clotted my tongue for a brief moment. The mouthfeel is thin and smooth, with only a faint bite from the carbonation, and a dry-yet-damp feeling is left after the beer leaves. My mouth is pretty damp with saliva but my tongue feels a little dry and sandpapery. Overall this is a mediocre pumpkin beer. It is definitely a pumpkin beer, which is good, but it carries some of the hallmarks of mass-brewing, and suffers for it. The beer could have a better mouthfeel and a riper feel to the pumpkin flavor. Worth a sip if you like pumpkin beer, but I would pick-up a Shipyard Pumpkinhead over this if I was looking for an easily accessible pumpkin beer to try."
""
""
"A middle of the road pumpkin ale. The appearance leaves a little to be desired, the nose is kind of confused, the taste is good but boring and the body is a bit light. But I've actually had worse pumpkin ales from legit micros, so Coors should feel kinda good about themselves on this one. I'd drink this before I'd drink other pumpkins."
""
""
""
""
"The beer pours an amber color with a white head. The aroma is as expected, with loads of pumpkin and nutmeg. The flavor is very similar. The pumpkin notes are present, as is come cinnamon and nutmeg. There is also some toffee and biscuit malt in the flavor. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."

"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Pours a dark copper with a quickly receding half finger of head. Leaves no lacing. Smells of pumpkin pie, pumpkin pie crust, slight cinnamon, and slight ginger. The taste is of straight pumpkin crust, With a good dose of ginger thrown into the mix. Only thing missing is the whipped cream. The mouthfeel keeps the mentioned flavors however the nutmeg comes through and dominates over the rest of the flavors. Over all, this was a delicious beer that would pair up well with Thanksgiving dinner. Hell, Even my girlfriend liked it!"
""
""
"Overall - Tastes nearly identical to the Apple Caramel ale, though this one gets slightly higher marks for tasting somewhat akin to the name and description given. Definite pie crust flavors that the latter had, but the hints of pumpkin come out slightly better than the """apple and caramel""" character that's supposedly in the other beer. Truth be told, if I did a blind taste test, I believe I'd have a hard time differentiating between the two."
"Poured out into a pint glass, this pumpkin ale is crystal clear with mild carbonation and a semi thick off white head that quickly dissipates into a thin layer of bubbles caressed by a good layer of lacing. The aroma is nice; I picked up some cloves, pumpkin spices, all spice, cinnamon, figs and raisins. It has a medium to light mouthfeel, and leans more toward light… Its crisp and sharp tasting throughout, on the tip of your tongue its mildly bitter, but the spices come out as it travels towards the back of your throat. As it hits the mid-section of your tongue, you can taste the spices and cloves; by the time it hits the back of your mouth the cloves, allspice and cinnamon are more present. This beer maintains its crispness throughout and is very pleasant overall, but the flavors could be a bit more present."

"Someone at the brewery must have fallen asleep. There is NO hint of spice in the aroma of this ale. There is NO taste or even hint of spices in this ale. Tastes like a brown ale. What happened here? It's okay for a brown , but when the label says """Pumpkin Ale""" this didn't deliver. I emailed them the batch number from my bottle..."

"DRINKABILITY: The bear is repeatable and easy to drink due to its alcohol level but I'd suggest finding a better exemplar of this style. All in all, it's a pretty pedestrian brew. There's not much pumpkin here and what there is tastes like baby food. It's not really objectionable but it's at the lower end of acceptable."

"O-Really nothing special here, if you want a pumpkin beer look somewhere else, this one is pretty boring."
""
""
""
"I agree with the other reviews. Not the best Pumpkin out there. Lackluster is a more fitting description. It felt like it was trying to be a ginger ale which not a """beer""" at all. Technically it's crafted as a cider, as ginger cannot be brewed... it's too delicate. Its extract can only be added as an after-flavor to a traditional beer. Hence, ginger ale. Nonetheless, this sucks!"

"Served this Pumpkin ale from a bottle into a pint glass. Pours a nice white head, retention is average and theres is some amount of lacing left on the glass. The color of this ale is a very nice copper color - it looks very appealing. The aroma is faint, some light malt, slight suggestions of pumpkin and some slight spice notes come through. The taste of this ale is medium body, smooth, easy to drink. There is a caramel malt base with some slight hints of pumpkin pie spice. Slightly dry finish...This pumpkin ale is decent...there are much better examples available."

"O: Overall I can't even score this average, because unfortunately it does not rank with average beers. It's not bad as a beer individually, and would be good as a midway between a light lager and something like a brown ale. Unfortunately it does not stack up if a person is looking for a pumpkin beer."
"Big thanks goes out to one of my buddies from college for this tick! Served from bottle into a Stone nonic. Poured red-orange with a two finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, pumpkin, clove, and cinnamon. The flavor was of sweet malt, pumpkin, cinnamon, wheat, and nutmeg. It had a light feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was an average brew. You can tell what they were going for with this one based on the aroma and flavor here. However, they just seemed to fall a little short for my liking. While the flavors were okay in this one, they just seemed a little diluted. Also, the nutmeg aspect I got in this one was definitely not needed at all and might have helped this brew out if it were not present. Glad I got to tick it for free as I wouldn't have been happy had I bought it."
"O- so many better options on the market if you're looking for a pumpkin beer, or an Octoberfest. This is just kinda there"
"Overall: I'm glad I didn't spend my own money on this. I really enjoy the different take brewers have with pumpkin ale. As noted above, I'm a little disappointed with this version. It's an easy drinking beer if you can do without flavor. Since I enjoy """flavor""" in my pumpkin beer, I'll stick to Dogfish Head, Weyerbacher or Smuttynose versions when I'm looking for solid rendition of the style. With that said, I'll have to serve the remaining beers to guests who don't know the difference between a really good and not so good pumpkin ale."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability - Light-bodied and plain. I don't get much pumpkin taste in this at all. A boring mess from Coors. This pretty much just tastes like Coors Light with a bit of vegetable and vine. Nothing special."
"Fairly easy to drink but unremarkable, this is more of a Belgian wit with touch of pumpkin spice, and doesn't stand up to some of the full-flavored pumpkin ales that are popular this time of year."
" O : Not bad from the Blue Moon lineup. A nice beer to try for who likes the macro brewers. Better than the original Blue Moon wheat ... maybe because its fall ."
"Overall: They really need to amp up the flavors in this one. As it is, it's very unremarkable and not a very good representation of a seasonal pumpkin ale."
"O: I'd avoid next time."
"O - Average. Nothing great but it is as good as any standread pumpkimn beer."
"Pours a clear copper orange with a 1 inch fizzy bone colored head that fades to a film on the top of the beer. Thin streaks of lace drip back down into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, pumpkin puree, and some subdued pumpkin pie spices. Taste is exactly the same as the smell but the spices are more assertive here. This beer has a very high level of carbonation with a crisp and prickly mouthfeel. A bit too much carbonation in my opinion. Overall, this is actually a pretty good pumpkin ale. I wasn't expecting very much and for what it is I was impressed."
"O: This beer is horrid, I would recommend this to not one person. Not even my worst enemy."
"Mouthfeel/Overall: Light bodied, moderate carbonation. Not the smoothest drinking beer, even when it warms. Overall, a very average pumpkin beer. Nothing insulting about it, but just plain."
"O - About as expected. A buddy get this to me to try. Glad I didn't buy a sixer."
"O-not a great pumpkin ale but acceptable for the price and for being a macro brews shot at a micro brew. Wouldn't seek it out again but tip of the cap to coors for trying."
"I have drank this one over the years and thought it was a great offering for the season. Now that I have """seen the light""" its just an average brew. Not tasting much of the pumpkin that I had anticipated. It has a great color and good carbonation and is a great session type beer BUT has a hight ABV of 5.7%. That was a nice surprise for a lower price six pack."
"There’s not much to Blue Moon’s pumpkin ale, which is about what I expected. Easily quaffed, but as flavor goes, it’s in the bottom tier of pumpkin brews."
"orange with a smallish head that had decent retention. Smell was watery, as was the taste, reminds me of regular blue moon with some attempt at pumpkin spices. This is certainly not a pumpkin ale for craft beer geeks. I really can't think of any reason to ever drink this again unless the last two choices in the world are between blue moon and blue moon pumpkin."
"M: The mouthfeel is nondescript, the spices never get too strong. The ale provides enough diversion though, a brief interlude."
"This has a sourish taste. There is some underlying spice and brown sugar, but this is essentially an ale with some attempt at being a pumpkin ale. Really, this tastes like a Blue Moon (the regular witbier) with a hint of spice. It's not bad, but it's not a beer-drinkers pumpkin."
"On tap at Old Chicago Westy. Poured a bit darker than I expected--leans towards the tan side. I couldn't really pick up any pumpkin/spices in the nose but the taste was a bit of pumpkin spices, malt, and very little hop bitterness. Not a bad brew but I would like a little more pumpkin here."
"Overall – not a bad tasting beer, but for the type, not very thrilling or near the mark."
"Overall, I'd definitely buy a 12 pack."
"I'm not really a wheat beer fan, but because it was a wheat pumpkin ale, I figured that I would try it. I was not a fan of this and had a difficult time tasting anything that resembled pumpkin. It tasted waterdown or something, I'm not sure but I was not impressed."
"Pours to a 1 inch frothy off-white head that falls to a creamy and patchy layer of foam and good lacing all the way down. Amber color and filtered clarity. Aroma is of fresh cut pumpkin, caramel malt, and pumpkin pie spices. Flavor is a balanced blend of crystal malt, vegetables (pumpkin?), spices, wheat bite and a tinge of hop bitterness to balance. Finishes on the dry side. Mouthfeel is light-medium, it is definitely a more autumn-oriented sipping beer much like an O-Fest. Overall it is very good and that's saying a lot coming from Coors. I've enjoyed this one very much and even self-professed non beer drinkers say they like the spiciness and think it is different enough to drink."
"The Blue Moon Fall Seasonal 12-pack was only $11.20 at local grocery store so not a terrible purchase. Better than Buffalo Bill's Pumpkin Ale which seems to get a lot of love."
"Overall, I have to give this pretty high marks relative to some standard Pumpkin Ales - it's easy drinking, with nothing offensive, and just enough """meat""" for the Fall."
"Overall: Probably the least enjoyable pumpkin beer I've tried to date. Pumpkin taste is non-existent, the typical pumpkin pie spices are minimal and out of balance. The only redeming qualities are the beer's appearance and the mouthfeel."
"O - Overall this really isn't worth the buy. If id known id already had this I would have held off...."
"O - Doesn't have enough pumpkin flavor for me to buy again, but if you like a beer on the sweeter side, it's not a bad overall. Really, they would do better if they named it something other than pumpkin, because it has good flavor, just not the pumpkin."
"O: not a good pumpkin, no depth, no complexity, no taste really, just bland and not something i would buy again"
"Stone"
"O: Actually, this is a decent brew but not really able to notice pumpkin flavor. Considering the brewery, I surprisingly enjoyed it but really would not consider this a pumpkin beer."
"O - I feel like this beer would be much better received if it wasn't labeled as a pumpkin beer. If it were just blue moon harvest ale and just contained spices I wouldn't have had many problems with it because it does that nicely for its price/brewery."
"Overall - I like this beer quite a bit. I'd definitely get it again."
"Poured a 3""" off-white head but I looked away for a minute and when I came back it was gone. Body is a dark clear amber, looks nice. Not a whole lot of smell, there's a little malt, and I don't really smell pumpkin. Taste is fairly standard Coors with at most a hint of pumpkin. Probably the weakest pumpkin beer I've ever had."
"M/O: Very light and drinkable for a pumpkin beer. This fits the mold of being a good beer but nothing too extraordinary to wow the palate."
"O: The lack of pumpkin flavor is a serious let-down being as it was purchased with a pumpkin ale in mind. There are much better options out there."
"O: I'm not one to bash a beer just because it is made by the """man""" (macro-breweries) but damn, come on coors. not pleased in my first P.A. of the season."
"Overall: It's not bad, but not a beer I would want again. Stronger, bolder pumpkin ales have swayed my expectations quite a bit. If you've never had a pumpkin beer, and you try this one, don't let it turn you off. And it really wasn't bad, just not good enough to pay for twice. Pumpkin ales are such an extreme idea--- the problem is this one aims for balance so hard that it misses out on bold flavors. It just doesn't work."
"O: This certainly does not hold up when compared to other pumpkin ales. There wasn't much of anything pumpkin-y about it. There are definitely better options out there."
"This is forgettable. By far the worst pumpkin beer I've had yet."
"Overall, this is a strangely disappointing brew. I was expecting more pumpkin and it simply did not deliver."
"O: Was looking for a pumpkin ale and all they had at the store was this. I would have probably been better off not getting anything. Low ABV makes it easy to drink quite a few, but as a pumpkin ale, I'll pass."
"Overall, this is...well, bad. A little bit more malt, more pumpkin, and less Coors could probably save it, but as it is, stay away. Thankfully I only picked up a single bottle as a part of a mix-your-own six-pack."
"O: big old hot mess, nothing too pleasant about this beer, I would suggest it to no one."
"O) This is an okay fall brew. Perhaps it doesn't bring as much pumpkin or spice to the party for most, but it goes down well enough for my tastes."
"Dr: It's very drinkable, average ABV, and decent quality. But it tastes nothing like pumpkin and it's far from notable. Only pursue this if you're a big fan of blue moon."
"Overall an ok, decent autumn beer"
"77."
"I'm generally not a fan of Pumpkin beers, but this one is pretty tasty! Seems less """pumpkiny""" than last years version. Recently had it at a beer dinner paired with a German brat and sauteed root vegetables...they were great together. In a word-delicious!"
"I definitely wish there were more to this beer, but what is present isn't half bad."
"Pours a nice deep red chestnut with a 1 finger inch head that turns to a thing tight lace around the glass. Smells of nutmeg, spice, clove, and light pumpkin, nothing is really jumping out of the glass, but smells good nevertheless. The taste is a little spicy with a tingle of sugar, nutmeg, clove, ginger can all be found, still a little light on the pumpkin. Mouthfeel is light, over carbonated, kinda sizzles in the mouth like a Pepsi, then follows down smoothly. Overall this isn't too bad, but this has alot of work to do if it's going to compete with some of the other pumpkin spice beers out there."
" Big expectations from this big company, but for me, they need to add more love for this beer because its lacking of something."
"I am drinking this beer as I type and I just don't get it. Pumpkin beers are some of my favorites and this fails miserably. It just taste like a basic crappy beer. The smell reminds me of the days of college parties and drinking a BMC product. Overall I hate it. It's not good and don't waste your time or money."
"Pours a dark reddish-orange with a whitehead that has minimal lacing and not much retention. The smell is pumpkin, nutmeg, and cloves. The taste starts out with some pumpkin and sweet malts, followed by some nutmeg, all-spice and cloves mixed with some pumpkin. The mouthfeel is smooth with some spices on the tip of the tongue. Overall this is a decent beer that is worth a try if no other pumpkin ale is available."
"O: Not looking forward to buying this again, but its worth it if only to drink a new beer."
" Overall I thought this brew tasted more of an October Fest than a pumpkin ale."
"After reading other reviews, I will not base my opinion of this style of beer based on this offering. I will definitely try others this year to see what all the fuss is about. I'll happily drink the rest of this 6 pack, but definitely won't buy this one again."
"This is what I would expect from a large brewery. No imagination or risks taken. It would be a mediocre marzen, it is a poor attempt at a pumpkin ale! A lack of spices and pumpkin flavor leave this beer falling well short of the niche it was meant to satisfy!"
"O-Very disappointing. It was the second """pumpkin""" I've found this season, and it gives pumpkins a bad name. Do not expect real pumpkins to taste like this. I think it doesn't deserve the pumpking name, """Harvest Spice""" is more like it."
"I always though the older one was rather bland. This one right off the bat taste like pumpkin pie. I can taste the pumpkin and spices. This is not Dogfish Punk but for a mass made beer, this one taste damn good for a pumpkin brew."
"I think this is a great beer. I can't think of a Blue Moon beer I don't like, and I think that this seasonal is really something special. It is rich, complex, and unique. The pumpkin is subtle, yet still present, and the spices make it a real tasty beer."
"I love pumpkin ales so when I saw this pumpkin ale from thebluemoon folks I had to try it. I was skeptical because I have had other seasonals from coors/blue moon and I wasn't very impressed. This one is right in line with their others.... Not bad but nothing very special. The overall look of this beer is awesome. I love the deep orange/copper color... But I feel like it comes up short beyond that. The smell is slight, the taste is slight over all it's nothing to get very excited about. I would try and break the taste and smell down more but there is so little going on it's hardly worth talkin about. Other pumpkin ales are an intense blend of autum spices... This is lacking."
"O - I like pumpkin beers but this one was just bad, blue moon usually has decent beers, but I would not recommend this one."
"It looks to have held up quite well! I got a dense finger of tawny head with great retention in the heat from my pour. Color was an orangish-amber with NE-quality clarity. The spices really carried the day on the nose. I got clove immediately and I am not sure that I can discern between nutmeg and allspice, but there was more than just clove in there. Mouthfeel was medium to full and the spices had mellowed into a melange of spice, almost cinnamon-like, but quite nice. Finish was dry and refreshing, very welcome on this humid afternoon. I recommend drinking any you may have still around so that you can load up on the fresh stuff in a few months."
"About an average beer. I had high expectations because I am a blue moon fan but, wasn't as great as I thought it would be. Better than the cheap beer but the price may steer some people away. This beer pours out as a brownish color, a little darker than expected. I would recommend people to give it a shot but not one I will get too often. The smell was spicy, with a cinnamon aroma."
"This beer pours out as a brownish color, a little darker than expected. The head was white a fluffy a first. The lacing wasn't the best but decent. The smell was spicy, with some cinnamon and nutmeg. The taste was a little puzzling to me, It almost tasted like pumpkin but I think the spices kind of collided and didn't really work well together for some reason. The mouthfeel was pretty light and not overly carbonated. Overall It's not my favorite Pumpkin Ale."
"It's a relatively light beer and has hints of cinnamon and pumpkin but has a lot less spice and pumpkin pie like flavor than most of the pumpkin ales I have had. Regardless this beer is very good during Fall and I would recommend giving it a shot if you have the opportunity."
"O: Definitely one of the weaker pumpkin ales, but I guess I wasn't terribly surprised."
"From fall brew tasting notes (2010): Pours a clear copper color with a thin head. Decent head retention and lacing. Aroma is toasted grain, caramel and light spicy notes. The taste is faint spice notes, toasted grain, caramel and a faint metallic note. Thin and slightly watery. Very strong carbonation. Not very good."
"Poured into a tulip. The beer has a nice dark orange bronze color. The head of the beer is off-white to tan. Surprisingly it stuck around for a few minutes. There seems to be some patchy lacing as well. Mild spices and caramel malts with some earth like undertones. All in all a pretty toned down aroma. Not to heavy on flavor. Mainly just some faint spices a weak caramel and toffee notes. Mouth feel isn't bad though. Medium bodied, smooth, medium carbonation. At least that was does ok. As far as drinkability goes this average at best. Its drinkable but I could see myself getting bored fast."
"Drinkability- The beer isn't bad but I probably won't drink it again."
"Virtually no lingering aftertaste or complexity. Enjoyable enough of a seasonal ale, but seems a wee bit lacking and underdeveloped."
"Nothing epic but not to shabby either. A decent pick for a low key holiday party that perhaps has a lot of non-beer drinkers."
"D- Very easy to drink, but nothing unique to call this a pumpkin beer."
"I was pretty disappointed with this brew. The appearance was the standard amber/brown color that I anticipated. For being a pumpkin ale there was hardly any pumpkin flavor or any of the associated flavors like clove and allspice. It wasn't evidenced in the smell either so I wasn't too surprised when I took a sip. If I wasn't told it was a pumpkin ale I never would have known... It is drinkable, just not particularly special."
"In a restaurant with limited macro draught choices, this was definitely the best of the bunch! I realize it's Coors and therefore every true beer element is muted, but I actually enjoyed this very mildly spiced pumpkin pint. It had far more white/wheat notes than I expected and was light in flavour. No aroma or finish per say, and I didn't order a second pint, but overall it was surprisingly drinkable."
"Rich amber color with not a lot of head to it. The aroma is light of allspice and not much else going on. The taste is very bland, but a hint of allspice and toasted malts come through. It has a smooth mouth feel and nice carbonation to it and is drinkable."
"D - this was not a good pumpkin ale, not that I was expecting much but it didn't even meet the criteria I had thought it to be. If you want pumpkin ale spend the extra few bucks and get one that's worth it. You'll thank me."
"A clear, dark amber-copper color with a fair white head and modest signs of lacing. The aroma is sort of a light caramel allspice idea, leafy and pretty mild. Nothing outstanding. The flavor brings orange leafiness and harsh toasted almond. It's acrid with a vague soapiness evident at times. I pick up some caramel toffee hidden under the surface but it's mostly about the grassy/leafy thing which doesn't excite me. It's medium bodied and lively. Reasonably drinkable if you are okay with the taste."
"Not as good as I had hoped. Blue Moon regular is much better as is Jack's Pumpkin Spiced Ale which is my favorite of all of the pumpkin ales. It didn't have a lot of spice or a lot of pumpkin flavor either. I was disappointed in it as I had hoped for a better flavor from this beer. I drank a couple of six-packs because the store I buy from was out of my first choice. I wouldn't go out of my way to buy it, but it was OK."
"Appearance is a crystal clear light brown with an off-white head that quickly disipates. Hard to pick up smell but hints of spices, orange or citrus fruit, light malt or bread. Tastes kind of neutral or even with hints of spices and very light pumpkin undertone, nothing really jumping out at me. Nutmeg and nutty aftertaste. Goes down pretty smooth. Keep this one around for my wife, she likes it and i can drink it but not at the top of my shopping list."
"Sumary: This is a good beer. I gave it a 7.7/10, or a C+. What's disappointing is that there is no pumpkin taste, except maybe a faint hint in the aftertaste. The appearance is okay, but I do like the smell of the beer. The drinkability is good for ale. Overall this beer isn't really exciting, and it doesn't stand out from other fall/Octoberfest/seasonal beers, but I still wouldn't turn this beer down. I would drink it again."
"D - Very drinkable, not overpowering, but well balanced."
"D - A decent Fall beer."
"It doesn't taste bad it just doesn't seem to taste much like a pumpkin ale. Better brews can be had for less."
"Not something I would try again but since it was a cheap Pumpkin Ale, I did want to give it a try at least!"
"its drinkable not the best style of the beer but not the worst flavors are weak but there"
"Overall, this is nothing to wait all year for. Bland and boring, only a faint suggestion of real pumpkin beer."
"Drinks very easy, I can see why my friend was drinking this all night. Not likely a beer I'd ever personally buy, but now I know it's something I wouldn't mind drinking at a party or something in the future. Impressed for where it came from, but not so impressed for what it claimed to be."
"Bubbly, fizzy mouthfeel, but really not too bad on this score. Pretty watery, eh..."
"D - This is a very average pumpkin beer at best. The mouthfeel and crisp finish significantly diminish what this beer could be. The pumpkin reminiscent flavors are mild here, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but the aforementioned crispness, carbonation and body really do this one in. The best part about it is how the beer looks. This might be a gateway beer - but not much more than that."
"D - Very simple beer. Not too many flavors, which also means it goes down pretty easy. Just wish there was a bit more to speak of there."
"D - The drinkability of this Pumpkin Ale is extremely high. Maybe not as high as Jack's Spiced Pumpkin Ale, but still pretty high. Would be deemed a very sessionable beer"
"Aftertaste: Sweet, feels light and crisp."
"Mouthfeel- Not a heavy beer, very drinkable."
"Drink- Not my favorite but wouldnt pass it up if it was free."
"This is a pumpkin beer. Certainly not an exemplary one. Not amazing, but not offensive. Nothing else to speak of. The head and aroma and color and taste were all basically the middle of the road you would expect from a mass production brewer. The Coors of Pumpkin ales."
"Drinkability: Not a bad pumpkin ale, yet not very exciting either."
"D: Tasty but not overwhelming."
"D: I don't really care for pumpkin, so I'm not sure what's worse: a pumpkin beer that tastes like pumpkin or one that doesn't. I'm going to go with the latter. On its own merits, it's an inoffensively decent amber ale. It receives demerits for false advertising, though."
"The back of the bottle says that the """inspiration ... was an amber ale""" and I can see this. This really isn't a pumpkin ale, but an amber ale with some spices and just a bit of pumpkin. This isn't a terrible effort, but after I was pleasantly surprised by the original Blue Moon, I was expecting a little more here. I mean, it's alright and drinkable, but there's no reason to seek this one out."
"d: very drinkable."
"D- It's easy to drink but IMO there are most definitely better versions of a pumpkin beer out there...this one has macro brew paw prints on it....it's not an offensive beer and I'd drink it again, but I'd look for something else on the shelf before getting this one again."
"Nothing really special to be honest. I've had better pumpkin beers. This one does have a nice color, sort of a pumpkin orage. The scent is slightly reminiscent of pumpkin, but mostly malty. Flavor is the same. Mostly malt, but just a hint of pumpkin. I couldn't taste the spices they said were there. Mouthfeel and drinkability were nothing special. I'll finish the sixpack, but won't do another one."
"This didn't have a whole lot of flavor going on. Very light spice flavors with a bit too much carbonation for me."
"D= fine, not sure what it would go with food-wise, maybe just nice to enjoy a few as a beverage. Hmmm how about with some pumpkin pie? lol"
"It's October and the time of Octoberfest beers and pumpkin beers. The word pumpkin sucked me in. Oh I know it's a macro, that's ok, let's give it a whirl. Popping the top the mist is a sweet corny macro smell, but with nice hints of cinnamon and spice and everything nice. Pours into a biergarten mug, nice pumpkin bronze with a foamy pillow top head. Out of the mug, an additional noticeable smell is nutmeg. Taste is sweet and tart, some bitterness but the maltiness stands out more than any hopping. The spices are also very evident, nutmeg, cinnamon and allspice. Mouthfeel is good carbonation might be a little high but is acceptable. Aftertaste is flatly bitter with lingering spices. This is a decent beer, it has the corny macro twang but aside from that it is quite drinkable."
"D - the lack of flavor makes this a very drinkable beer. I keep going back for another sip in hopes of discovering some hidden flavor but it's just not there. Still very drinkable."
"D: This is weak attempt at a pumpkin ale. Bland with no character, I'll pass on this one next time. There are far better pumpkin ales out there."
"This Ale is probably best suited for mainstream beer drinkers who want a slight change from the norm."
"D: Goes down pretty easy. I could drink another but it is not pleasing enough to the palate to have more than one."
"D: One of the more palatable beers I've ever tried from coors, but this by no means is a stellar pumpkin ale."
"The color is a good ale color, the head is just right, but it's just so bitter. I really can't find anything else good to say about it."
"D- not drinkable. Very lame even for a blue moon."
"Easy to drink, if I'm comparing it to a 12% barleywine, but against others in this class, it doesn't stack up. I actually did think I would like this better than I do - I didn't try this just to bash Coors."
"Taste is also very very thin. No pumpkin whatsoever. Actually made me re-read the label to make sure it was supposed to be a pumpkin ale. Basically tasted like blue moon to me. You could have taken blue moon, but some brown dye in it, and given it to me and I don't think I'd notice the difference, althoug hI haven't had a blue moon in a long time."
"D: Smooth and easy drinking. Only hampered by excessive bubbliness."
"A waste of money. Had buffalo bills the other day and that is a fine example of a pumpkin brew. Coors drops the ball once again."
"Not big on the pumpkin flavors but an easy drinking beer if you're looking for a pumpkin amber for a change of pace or for a non beer drinker that needs something different."
"Regretting that I bought a full six pack. They will make nice halloween gifts to stressed out parents on Halloween night."
"Drinkability is okay, but not high. The real problem is that pumpkin aftertaste. Just a little less pumpkin would be great."
"Not horrific, but not very flavorful. Needs more than toasted sugar and lightly burnt malt to get by. I didn't hate this, but won't go here again."
"It's not a pumpkin brew if that is what you are expecting."
"Goodness me this is boring stuff. Bland, undertoned and quite simply insipid. If this is the best large brewery in America, then God help us."
"Drinkability - I normally can only have one of these...two tops, and then I'm done. A decent pumpkin beer but if DFH Punkin was available I would most certainly get that over this (of course)."
"Drinkability: You could definitely drink this beer, and several would be no problem. However, if you're looking for a pumpkin ale, I stress, do not buy this beer; but if you're looking for a fair beer for a cool fall night with some decent flavors that is within a pretty cheap price range, this could be your beer."
"D - Compared to other Blue Moon brews, this pumpkin ale falls a bit short. I found Harvest Moon to be mediocre as far as craft beers go and wouldn't recommend it if you're looking to sit down and enjoy a true pumpkin ale. However, this light autumn seasonal is still very drinkable and would be nice to sip on while you're grilling out with your mates in the crisp fall weather."
"This was a dissapointment from a fall seasonal style beer and the light favors really bring down the drinkablity of this beer"
"The mouthfeel is a little thin for a beer of this ABV, and not very tasty. Still, it's a good beer for the typical light lager crowd to try and feel different."
"A good spice feel comes on halfway down. Palate just had to get used to (I don't know how to spell acclimated prolly). Don't drain pour this, it gets better."
"D- Its an average beer to drink. Having one or two isn't awful but any more then you might get sick of the taste."
"D - This was a decent brew. I frankly wasn't impressed, but there wasn't anything that really threw me off, except mediocrity."
"One positive note is that it is pretty drinkable. By that, I mean I will probably finish this 12 ounce glass without pouring it down the drain. My girlfriend seemed to like it OK, so it's got that going for it."
"D-actually very drinkable. despite lacking positive qualities, the beer isn't bad if you choose a beer to drink a lot of. I bought a 6-pack and i was able to enjoy the experience. It is a good beer to bring to a function or some place where you're not going to be focused on the taste."
"Blue Moon Brewing Company--Harvest Moon Pumpkin Ale--Ale Brewed With Natural Flavor--Blue Moon Seasonal Collection--2010 12 oz. Bottle. 5.70% ABV. 20 IBU's? (4.0 / 5.0) Amber Ale--Pumpkin. Mild lace off white foamy light head. Bright clear thin rich amber color. Aromatic mild pumpkin clove all spice mild hop front. Mild sweet smooth zesty toasted pumpkin caramel malt spicy mild fruit body. Clean lingering nutmeg mild hop spice end. Well balanced mellow pumpkin flavors. Sampled 9/3/2010. 6-Pack $7.49."
"Drinkability is above average with this brew, owing to the clean, crisp feel and the decent taste. Could have knocked back another one and probably would not have minded at all. It isn't the best pumpkin ale I've had, but it certainly isn't the worst."
"D = Not for me. Being a fan of pumpkin ales and Blue Moon, I thought this would be terrific. I was truly disappointed."
"I liked this brew and I am not a punkin fan. I immediately went in for a second and wasn't let down."
"I loved the taste of Blue Moon and was hoping this beer would deliver as well. This pumkin ale is quite difficult to describe. There really isn't much of a smell to the beer but it does have quite a heavy taste. It does leave quite an after taste though which I didn't really care for with this beer. You really have to search for that pumkin taste which is very faint."
"Poured a very nice golden amber, with a small off-white head stuck around for a while. I couldn't smell a whole lot, just some mild malts and perhaps a whiff of spice. Taste is pretty bland. Just not a whole lot of complexity. I pick up very faint traces of pumpkin, but clove? Nope. Finish is average and bitter, mildly carbonated. could drink one or two easily, I suppose, but don't really want to."
"We'll say it: too clean. Perhaps the lack of hops and bitterness? But this is to be expected coming from a big brewer. With that said, it just does not have the same gritty raw feel to it and it's hard to imagine a brewer chopping pumpkins for the mash when a beer is this clean. A good beer for the faint of palate."
"Pours a light yellow color, nice carbonation, small white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some hops, slight pumpkin, slight caramel. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, there is some pumpkin in here, slight hop note. Light body. Not drinkable, would not buy again."
"D - good, easy to drink, some interest. The aftertaste of pumpkin is there and it tastes real and fresh, not just pumpkin spice."
"I have mixed feelings about this brew. It's good, but there is something about it that just fails to keep my attention. Overall, definitely worth trying at least once."
"Pours a pretty nice caramel orange maple color, smallish head that fades rapidly. Smell is a bit of bready malt, some cinnamon, lots of metallic character. Taste is ok, a bit of lightly roasted malt, a hint of pumpkin and nutmeg, fleeting finish. MF is soda, prickly, not very impressed here. Drinkability on this one is tough--I just don't like it that much. I tend to like pumpkin ales too. Metallic smell really holds it back for me. Not a fan."
"Drinkability: if you want a pumpkin ale, this may hit the spot but it is low on my list of pumpkin ales I want to drink. Easy to quaff due to mild flavor profile, but when glass is empty I was looking for something else."
"D - Certainly not the best pumpkin beer I've had and I wouldn't recommend spending hard earned money on it, but I wouldn't turn one down if it was offered. This isn't macro brew swill, just mediocre craft style beer."
"This is blue moons fall seasonal beer. The beer appears to promise a pumpkin taste, but none is present. The poured a dark amber color, and there was almost no color, and the beer had a """harvest""" like order, but the taste of the beer was nothing speical, it was quite disaponting."
"Shows a light, grainy orange in the glass with a creamy white froth that dissipates quickly, below average retention, and average lacing. Aromas of cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, """pumpkin flavoring", cereal grains, & brown sugar follow through on the palate with an emphasis of grains, cinnamon, & nutmeg. Although the nose is pretty, there is a clear artificial element to this beer and is a little over spiced. The flavor is nice, but simple....definitely above average, but nothing I'd call good...more like a not bad. This beer is very sessionable and would definitely compliment/not overpower a thanksgiving dinner. I can see a lot of people liking this beer, so, overall, not a bad effort from the team at Coors."
"Not bad at all for a macro beer, not the best pumpkin beer I've had in the last few weeks, but not a bad effort."
"I'd enjoy one of these, but no more."
"Overall impression: A clean, easy drinking pumpkin beer. Too clean for an ale but it is what it is. Not bad but not good."
"Notes: I like plain old blue moon better. Both Harvest Moon and Honey Moon get too sweet. The problem is that it already has so much adjunct sweetness to begin with, than when you add all the additional sweet flavorings it gets too strong."
"Overall: A fine macro version of this style. Nothing especially good here to speak of, but nothing bad either. If you want a lighter pumpkin ale, this is it. But if you are looking for a more complex darker """harvest pumpkin ale""" with notable hop, spice, and malt presence, look for something more expensive."
"Overall another half hearted attempt at a pumpkin ale. I wish these big brewers would put some time and effort into crafting a good pumpkin beer. They don't make anything year round that's worth my time. Why not make something once a year I would want to drink?"
"Not too bad really, some tweaking in the heftier areas of the body and lengthen the flavor profile and boost it some and this would be up there with many other Pumpkin beers."
"Overall: I was really disappointed by this beer. I was expecting something with more flavor beyond just a typical beer. That aside, this didn't even meet my standards for a middle-of-the-road beer."
"Drinkability: Overall, this is a pretty feeble attempt at a pumpkin/spice beer. That said, it is a very run-of-the-mill, unoffensive amber ale. I'd take it over Blue Moon Belgian Wit for sure."
"Would I buy more of it? - I'm going to say no. I'll continue to support the little guy who spends money on real ingredients and not flashy marketing."
"D- Overall, I have to say I wasn't impressed with this beer. I really like most fall seasonals but I think they kind of missed the mark here. Too bad because I love fall flavor, cinnamon, nutmeg, pumpkin spice, ect, didn't get any of it, maybe a dash of nutmeg. Maybe worth a try, but not really that drinkable."
"A pretty well balanced beer that has many surprises and is well in hand with many great Oktoberfest beers. This beer also is pretty easy drinking and enjoyable."
"This is a decently drinkable beer; one is probably enough for me, but it goes down pretty smoothly. I used to like this beer a lot when I was first getting into craft, and I think a lot of that had to do with drinking out of the bottle and in turn avoiding the rather unpleasant smell of this beer. Anyway, Harvest Moon is not exactly earth-shattering, but it's not a bad option as far as cheap seasonals go."
"I don't think I could drink more than one of these. They are not very tasty or appealing to me. Not a very good pumpkin ale at all."
"D- a fairly drinkable beer, just not quite """pumpkiny""" enough"
"Drinkability: Well rounded, but not complex or powerful. It gets the job done, but isn't refined like it could be."
"D - Not so good. This tastes pretty offensive and does not have many redeeming qualities to it."
"Serving type: Bottle"
"D: Goes down easy, not too overpowering in any direction. I've been working on a six pack of these and they haven't been objectionable with anything, but I wouldn't seek this out again. Beats drinking a Coors, but the parent company definitely shows."
"drinkability is so so - but there much better pumpkin ales out there"
"The verdict- to fully appreciate the somewhat complex (although not terribly subtle, and this is a good thing) flavor profile, this beer must be imbibed slowly and with attention paid to its full range of flavors. Not everyone will like this beer but, for such a style, this is to be expected. It's best niche, I think, is for drinkers who are new to spiced beer and want something that tastes more familiar than Old Fezziwig."
"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle marked MAR0110-CO5101645. It pours a reasonably clean amber-orange with a half-inch foamy tan head. The appearance was its best feature. The aroma had little in the way of pumpkin spice. It had more of a macro malty aroma and kind of stale at that. The mouthfeel was in the medium range. The taste includes caramel and sweet malts and hint of hops but practically no pumpkin spice. It this was marketed as an amber ale, I might be able to accept it because essentially that's what it tastes like. I am sorry but this was a weak effort on the part of Blue Moon."
"Drinks alright, but lacks the squashy pumpkin flavor I seek in this style, plus any real complexity. Would do in a jam for a beer or so, no more than that though"
"If you want to see what a standard pumpkin beer is like get the micholob pumpkin ale I think it's better than this , but if you really want a good one go with the DFH Punkin' ale , that's a good ass pumpkin beer."
"Either this beer changed in the last year or my palate evolved/devolved. If you call yourself a pumpkin beer I don't want to have to search for pumpkin, just give it to me already!"
"D - this beer is very approachable if you are just looking for something to quaff. the thin body and smooth, crisp feel are perfect for haveing several. that said, the flavor sucked, and I could not finish the bottle with the flavor being my number one goal. again, if your just looking for a thirst quencher, this brew ain't all that bad. if you want something more -avoid!"
"The foam was light wheat/white in color with a small hint of orange/yellow and dissapated quickly. The color was a beautiful crystal orange amber with gold highlights. The smell had a good balance of hops and wheat with a nice spice undertone. The taste had a dull pumpkin flavour, but more of a blalnce of hops and wheat with a spice undertone. Mouthfeel - medium-bodied, crisp and clean. Drinkability - it's not bad, but needs more pumpkin taste. The color was too crystaly, like if it was just water and food coloring - no depth."
"D- Easily consumed beer is not always the way to go. As a pumpkin ale this one just fails."
"all in all an okay beer but i probably won't ever buy it again."
"I could easily enjoy this more than once."
"Poors a golden orange colour, without much of fragrance, i can smell some crystal sweetness but not much else. Ok mouth feel but lacking in any sort of pumpkin or spice taste, if you didn't tell me this was a pumpkin beer i would say it was an amber ale with a little something extra. Very disappointed in this beer, not I should be surprised with this brewery."
"Mouth is way overcarbonated and bitter. Just not so enjoyable but if I was drinking on a wasted palate it might be enjoyable."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has an amber color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is surprisingly mild, some hints of pumpkin. Taste is also mild. The pumpkin is there but the spices seem to be lacking. Feels light in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall this is a mediocre beer."
"A decent beer that fits into the season perfectly. There was nothing spectacular about it, but I could easily drink several. This is a good step in the right direction for many macro drinkers. Enjoy!"
"Drinkability: A pretty good beer overall. It fits the season well, but there are other fall beers I would go for before this one. Still, this is a pretty good beer from a macro brewery."
"Drinkability: Not a bad drink. Kind of refreshing. Would go well with a meal, I think. Nothing great, however."
"Note: I will give coors the credit to the extent that they didn't follow the recent trend of overbearingly spiced autumnal seasonals , but overall I don't see myself going out for a sixer"
"Overall was really disappointed with it. Got little to no pumpkin taste out of it and was more like a red ale or lager then anything."
"Drinkability: It's not a terrible beer, but I won't be picking this up again. The lack of carbonation ruins this beer, and I wish there was more boldness in the flavor in one direction or the other (spice or pumpkin)."
"Drinkabilty - if it wasn't for the taste, i'd have another."
"Harvest moon has a bold orange color with some light brown thrown in. The head looked good with a inch in height and off white color, no lacing to speak of though, bummer. The smell was simply spices and some sweet malt, not a whole lot of punkin. The taste is the same with some clove and nutmeg and small amounts of any real pumpkin, it is hanging in the back by a thread. Some malts offset the spicy nature of this beer with some caramel and bread and some sweetness. The feel was below medium bodied and just a bit watery, no real depth. The carb was also light. I actually enjoyed this a bit more than expected because the pumpkin was light and it's not my favorite flavor."
"Drinkability: Overall, a dissapointing effort from Coors and their Blue Moon brewery. A pumpkin ale should taste like pumpkin, not a barrage of spices and other elements to throw you off guard. I wanted to like this, but it doesn't offer what other real pumpkin ales on the block have. Hopefully something will change next time around."
"12oz brown bottle obtained at Hannaford's Supermarket Derry, nh. pours a crystal clear deep amber-red color with a half inch of off white head that slowly dissipated. very faint scents of pumpkin spice and nuttiness. faint tastes of pumpkin spice, nutmeg, and a tease of cinnamon. moderate carbonation with a clean finish and light to moderate body. very easy drinker and probably one of the blandest pumpkin ales i have tried IMO. The best part of this beer was the appearance."
"This is perhaps one of the worst pumpkin ales I've had, next to Shipyard"
"Pours an amber orange color with a small head. The aroma is of some pumpkin but more so of spices such as cinnamon and of nutmeg, the smell is pretty faint, not a lot going on. The taste is of spices cinnamon and a little pumpkin. The taste is watery and not very full. The mouthfeel is very carbonated and very harsh. The drinkability is okay you could drink a lot of them, but this beer was very watery and runny."
"Bottom line, If your looking for a very STRONG spicy Pumpkin ale you might not really enjoy this, however it does deserved to be tasted if your into seasonal beers."
"I remember this being a lot better when it was first introduced. Not so good, now."
"I really enjoy this brew even though it gets a bad rap from people because it is a Coors product. This beer really made me want to go out and try different types of beer."
"Drinkability: I don't foresee myself buying this again anytime in the near future. There are plenty of better pumpkin brews available to me. I am happy to have finally tried this, if for nothing more than crossing it off my list."
"If its supposed to be pumpkin flavored they failed. Otherwise it is a very average beer. Nothing special, nice appearance though. It looks very nice in a clear glass."
"Pours an amber clear brown colored body, lighter yellow around the edges. With a dull gray head, small bubbles, quickly diminishing. Very malty, rice maybe? Odd. Not appealing. Clear, pumpkin & spices, that same odd flavor. Okay but weakish."
"D: A little tasty, goes down easily enough, not too filling, mild kick, not the best representation of style, I'm not much of a pumpkin ale guy but there are definitely several better ones that I would select above this one."
"Decent atmosphere. Nose is very non-distinctive. Flavor, however, is distinctive. Good balance of malt with the pumpkin and spice. The flavorings don't come out so sweet they overwhelm the malt and hops. Maybe a bit too much of a carbonated feel, but the robustness kinda' mitigates it. Makes for some really solid drinkability. Overall, a really good quaff."
"This beer, the pumpkin version of their popular Blue moon, was a bright orange color. The one-finger head was khaki colored, the retention was weak and the lacing scattered. The aroma was subtle but pleasant, pumpkin pulp and light spices. The flavors were of nutmeg, pumpkin and general malt but they lacked distinction and the aftertaste was notably """off.""" The mouthfeel was rough due to over-carbonation and an oiliness imparted by the odd hopping. It wasn't bad and for a Coors product at a Coors price it was pretty good, but little more than acceptable on my personal scale."
"Notes from 11/2/04"
"Drinkability- I ain't dumping it down the sink. But that's about the nicest thing I can say."
"Faint pumpkin and spice in the flavor. It's all right I guess."
"(rated Sep 24, 2008)"
"6/3/6/3/13/3.1"
"D: A easy beer to drink. Not heavy."
"Drinkability: It can pass as a decent pumpkin ale, but I wouldn't have more than 1 of these...its just not good enough"
"Taste: This is definitely just a brown ale with some spices. Not what I was expecting but it still tastes really good."
"This makes me sad. Blue Moon used to be one of my faves, before Coors bought them out, some years ago. Being well aware of this, I've stayed away from their products for awhile now. Since I was craving Pumpkin beers, I thought I'd give this another chance. This is a pale imitation of past glory."
"D: It is OK. Easy enough to drink because there wasn't much there."
"D - this has probably been my least favorite pumpkin beer. Something about it didn't sit well with me. I would definitely recommend a different pumpkin ale if you are looking for something along the pumpkin style."
"D: It needs a boost to call this drinkable. Not awful, but not great either. I would give it another shot."
"I find this fairly drinkable."
"Recommended..."
"I think I prefer this to the Michelob version of the style, but it's still nothing great. So far, Elysian's version of thestyle trumps all others I've tried, though that's still a pretty small field."
"the bitterness/yeast ester outweigh the balnd malt profile. i would not buy another one"
"Overall drink ability is mediocre. Could not taste any pumpkin , beer serves as an average fall/winter ale."
"Oh, and a big (sarcastic) THANKS goes out to the sneaky bastard that swapped my beer without telling me. Blech..."
"Light mouthfeel. It's really thin. Drinkability is okay, but I would prefer a pumpkin beer that tastes like pumpkin."
"Overall, I wasn't expecting this to be too impressive, but it turned out to be pretty good and I ordered another (you can't go wrong for a buck). If you not looking for something to expensive, I'd give this a try."
"D: OK as a fall fest beer, I guess. Tasted a little too much like a macro with some pumpkin pie thrown in."
"P- I'm not a huge pumpkin ale guy. This was tolerable and I probably wouldn't say no to one, but it's nothing extraordinary."
"d: I assumed this would be total shit. I have an unwarranted bias against blue moon and all other coors endeavors. But at least I can admit it and I attempt to second guess it. This is a decent pumpkin beer. Pretty well balanced, not a spice bomb like so many others. Good work coors."
"Very watery brew. No crispness, no good carbonation. This brew is flat as can be. This beer also warmed very quickly. I would not have this again just for the mouthfeel, or lack thereof."
"The mouthfeel is watery."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- The label reads, """Serve this hearty brew with all of your autumn meals.""" This is hearty compared to Coors Light, but not even close to hearty in the way that you or I might have anticipated. The texture in the mouth is quite good, remaining effervescent and enjoyable throughout this tasting. I'd suggest letting this beer open up in your glass for 20 minutes, as the nose and taste have improved."
"D - Great pumpkin ale... Highly sessionable, which is quite unique for a pumpkin ale..."
"not my cup of tea."
"A nice, solid example of a style that's hard to brew."
" ~ I enjoy nearly everything about this beer except the feel. Because I think this type of beer should be warming me I have to say I'm a little disappointed with the way it causes a chill. Because of that I can't recommend the overall be anything more than average."
"This beer pours a clear orange amber with a beige head. The smell, what little there is, reminds me vaguely of bubblegum, not the same and definitely not as overt as one might smell in a hefeweizen. I suppose it's supposed to smell like pumpkin. There's also some grain there if you really swirl the glass and hunt for it. The taste is largely typical macrobrew, (grain, little to no hops, light on the malt). There is a little bit of spice (nutmeg perhaps) but it is faint. It's not a bad beer per se, just disappointing. Typical of a macrobrew attempt at craft brewing, it tries to not offend the broadest audience and in so doing has achieved a solidly mediocre result."
"D: One of the best pumpkin brews I've had to date though we don't get a huge selection on the West Coast. Nice beer out of a macro brewer."
"D-Depends on what you like. This seems typical of a macro interpretation of the style. Buy some for the in laws for Thanksgiving and they will probably like it. I won't buy any more of this...in fact, I'll probably give away the balance of the 6 pack."
"Overall, a fairly drinkable brew, and while the flavor of pumpkin is present, the accompanying mouthfeel that is present in brews incorporating actual pumpkin is not, and the bready, biscuit notes in the finish are rather undesirable for an ale of this style. Still, not bad, and certainly a very good beer, if not the best in its ranks."
"Overall, an OK beer. There are much better pumpkin beers available, but this is drinkable."
"Had this beer at a pizza place in Park City. The waiter mentioned something about a pumpkin ale and my heart sank as this mass produced bit of floatsam landed on my table. This was just a bland and unexciting beer. Not much flavor (what pumkin?), I'd suggest they rename it corn flake ale, it would be more appropriate. I recommend getting water instead."
"Overall just a slightly better than average beer"
"But after the first sip, admittedly, I felt let down. All I can say about the taste is that it was like a Coors dressed up in a sexy red dress. Definitely looks good, but once you get to the goods, all you find is a better than normal tasting Coors with an ambiguous and temporary burst of spices."
"Not very good, but not very bad. Um....in between. The flavor got boring during the second half of the 12 ounce serving. Thanks, but I'll stick to Jack's Pumpkin Spice should I consume a macro pumpkin beer."
"Not as pumpkin flovred or as spiced as other pumpkin ales but that might be a good thing. Had a definative fruit beer taste (no traces of hops or malt) with a mild nutmeg/cinnamon after taste. Good beer to drink with some nuts or desert. As with most of the spiced pumpkins ales I could only stomach a few but with the mild pumpkin and spice flavors here I could have a few more of these."
"D - As with most of my spiced and flavored brew reviews, it's the flavor that detracts from the drinkability of one after another.. it does has an impressive edge for a holiday/seasonal brew. Very solid presentation all the way through."
"Pours a medium amber with orange tones. Medium head. Smell is very pumpkin-like with mixed spices. Immediately I taste pumpkin mixed with nutmeg and dare I say a splash of vanilla? Almost tates more like a lager than an ale. Mouthfeel is medium / medium-light. Drinkability is average. It's not a bad brew but there are definitely much better brews available, try Dogfish Head Pumkin'."
"d. Hmm. Not bad, but nothing that would really want me to drink more. It's a decent pumpkin ale that could serve as a """gateway""" in to pumpkin ales, although that seems fairly unnecessary. It's not pumpkin-y enough to want more, nor are the spices pleasant enough to really crave the pie spices in this one, even if that's your thing. Worth trying a bottle - it was better than i was anticipating from Coors - but nothing I'd want daily."
"So I guess the standard Blue Moon is a solid beer (at least in my opinion). Good flavors, highly drinkable. But the """seasonal""" offerings are weak. This one was no exception. Sort of a strange mix between a wheat beer and a pumpkin. Very light spices and a touch of malt. Highly carbonated, overwhelming what flavor there might be. Certainly, better than most macro lagers, but there's just not a lot here to appreciate or even notice."
"*edit-Do not let this beer warm up on you drink it cold, if I was to review it now it would probably lose near a whole letter"
"D - Average, but could get old after a couple. Good for the season."
"D- This was good, it was not the best brew I have had from blue moon (Coors) but it was different in a good way. It defiantly tasted of fall with the pumpkin flavor and spices. not an every day beer, but I would buy it again when it comes out for the season."
"Once again, Blue Moon (Coors) can't make anything that compares to the original Blue Moon."
"D: Overall a decent pumpkin session, lightly spiced to drink in multiples, yet still appreciable by style. A good entry level herb/spiced beer and thought it was slightly above average due to its light nature and ease of drinkability."
"D - Normally I could have a bunch of the blue moon brand and be satisfied. You could easily pound this beer, but it is not going to leave you satisfied. BOOO!"
"Poured from a bottle to a pint glass a nice dark orange color with a cream head that remained throughout. Smelled like nothing closely related to pumpkin. Very watery taste with some pumpkin flavor and cloves. Clove spice lingers a bit but otherwise flavor is weak and lacking. Medium carbonation here and drinks easy enough, its just bland. I like Blue Moon and loved their Spring """seasonal""" but this is crap."
"D: Not the worst pumpkin ale that I've had but far from the best. Can't say I will seek out again."
"D - Good beer."
"D: While it's not going to drive me away from trying other pumpkin ales I will not be buying this one again."
"Overall, worth visiting once for me but I won't buy it again."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle. Pours orange/brownish, can see thru it, white head that doesn't linger too long. Smells of pumpkin and spice, smell is pleasing, not powerful. Taste is...ok. Almost watered down with a hints of spices and pumpkin not really malty (which is what is missing). This beer is very easy to drink, but there are way more better beers out there to try this fall season."
"D: Goes down easily enough, but I know many more pumpkin ales I'd rather have."
"D: good. this is not the best pumkin ale that I've had but a decent one. A good session beer that average beer drinkers can enjoy. Not bad"
"D: Good, but a little too bland for a session."
"Comes out of the tap a beautiful clear copper, with not much head. Appetizing malty aroma has hints of spice, mainly cinnamon. Lively flavor is mainly malty with hints of hops and cinnamon, no real pumpkin flavor but still tasty. Texture is smooth and tingly."
"D: Overall a decent pumpkin session, lightly spiced to drink in multiples, yet still appreciable by style. A good entry level herb/spiced beer and thought it was slightly above average due to its light nature and ease of drinkability."
"Pours a hazy dark amber with a small white head and seemingly having medium-high carbonation. The smell is a pleasant spiciness with mild pumpkin. It is medium-bodied and sits well in the mouth. The taste is where it's at! The pumpkin and spices land much harder than I would have expected from the milder scent. It's got a strong finish and aftertaste which is really delicious. This one's not too heavy either so it's really drinkable. I'll definitely be having this one again."
"with this Fall Season ale, you really have to hunt for the pumpkin taste in this beer. It is very hard to find any unique spices in this beer. It's malt is different from the other Blue Moon brews. It does smell almost like the spring ale, except it is much less sweeter than the Spring Ale. This beer is a strong beer, compare to the other Seasonal Brews from Blue Moon."
"Not worth it, its a funky knock off of an octoberfest."
"A good no nonsense pumpkin ale here, could drink it all day, though a little bit high ABV to be a session."
"Overall, it's about like Blue Moon in terms of quality, a step above, but not at all a high quality pumpkin ale."
"drinks very easy, goes down well, one of my favorite pumpkin ales because the beer isn't killed with overwhelming pumpkin flavors like some brews."
"Notes: I like that the spices don't dominate the entire flavor but the pumpkin could be a little more vibrant and it seemed to lack body. Overall it is still not bad and it is easy to drink."
"MF&D - Overall not a bad ale, but as far as seasonals go, there are just way better ones out there."
"Drinkability: I feel like this brew immediately gets a bad rap because it's Coors, when it's really pretty decent for the style. It's nothing spectacular, and nothing I'd get on a regular basis, but it's easy to drink and flavorful enough to make it a sessionable brew. Not something I look forward to in the fall, but something I'll pick up everyone once in a while as the season goes on."
"Not bad for Coors. A brown ale with a white head ale. Has a spice rack smell to it. Tastes good initally having strong taste of cloves and nutmegs and allspice followed quickly by the trademark coors bitter malt finish. Feels kind of watery on the tongue. Goes down pretty easy and is kind of lite so I could throw a few back."
"Bought this for my sister since she's not a beer drinker but wanted to try a pumpkin ale. I went cheap in case she rejected it (she did), but this beer was worthy of the rejection. Poured a transparent, light orange with a one-finger head that died slowly and left some lacings. A rather dulled pumpkin and spiced smell; like they didn't want to put alot it so it would be more bland for mass consumption. The pumpkin flavoring is weak and there is no """liquid pumpkin pie""" reference here. Light to medium bodied with a sharpness on the backbite that comes from spicy overkill, this is not that sessionable. I've had worse pumpkin ales, to be frank, but I don't see myself buying another sixer of this."
"This is one of the better pumpkin ales I've had."
"While it's advertised as a pumpkin ale, I get no smell or taste of pumpkins which I feel is kind of odd. Instead it tastes and smells like cinnamon among the other usual fall type spices. Pours a beautiful copper color and is easy to drink, but the lack of pumpkin flavor in a pumpkin ale was disappointing."
"Drinkability - The beer is certainly drinkable but it fails to impress. I don't think the taste would wear on me but the beer is pretty boring compared to what else is out there."
"This isn't as bad as AB's Jack's Pumpkin Spice Ale, as this one is actually drinkable. However, it has a very artificial taste and smell to it, like extracts were used instead actual pumpkin being added."
"Notes/Thoughts: If I didn't know any better I'd think this was a harvest ale. The spice is the only suggestion of otherwise. Not even close to the best pumpkin ale out there, but drinkable nonetheless."
"D - One of these is enough. I had this last year and didn't think much of it, and after revisiting it this year I think this will be my last purchase. No reason to have another one."
"D - Well its the season for pumpkin beers so right now its not bad kinda average over all its something fun and different going in the fall season"
"This beer poured a orange/brown with a single-finger tan head that lingered. The smell is mostly malt with a little bit of what may be pumpkin in the background. The taste starts off with some sweet malt that definitely has some pumpkin in the middle and some spices and a bit of bitterness towards the end. The mouthfeel is a little watery with some fine carbonation. This is probably the least impressive beer I've had from the Blue Moon section of Coors, but it's still fairly drinkable and worth a try if you think it might appeal to you."
"drinkability suffers with this one. for a pumpkin ale, this is a flabby and unbalanced example. the malt base which is absent here would have complimented the spiced quality, as well as given the brew some much needed body. overall, this is one that most can skip over without any second guessing."
"D - A nice beer for the transition from summer to winter."
"Drinkability: Better than the other Blue Moon seasonals (besides maybe Full Moon), but that's really not saying much. This one was not as smooth as anticipated, but flavor wasn't too sweet or over the top. Not a good pumpkin ale, but I wouldn't object to drinking it again."
"3/3/3/2.5/3"
"D: Something a bit different that was pretty good. Might wear on me after a while though."
"Drinkable, but I doubt I'd buy any more."
"It looks good coming out of the bottle. A nice copper hue with a decent head. After that though it was all downhill. This is only the 2nd Pumpkin ale that I have ever had, but it seemed to be missing a key ingredient... Pumpkin. There really is no scent to the beer and the taste is pretty average. I can't find a hint of Pumpkin in this beer at all. In fact I'm beginning to think that Coors took a batch of Killians and just slapped Pumpkin Ale labels on the bottle. The mouthfeel and drinkability are average. I will manage to drink the rest of the six pack but it was definitely a disappointment. I won't be seeking this out again."
"The second Pumpkin Ale I've had in 3 days and I'd have to say the other was better (Smuttynose). Amber color to this, with a thick tan head, although that fades quickly. Faint pumpkin aroma but really there's nothing there. Tastes like many of the ingredients for a decent pumpkin pie: spices, cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger. It was however a little watery and bland. Now that I've tried this, I see no reason to have it again."
"Good head but dissipates quickly with fine amber color. Essentially no smell at all, just alcohol aroma which is quite the turnoff. As for the taste, pumpkin flavor that you have to dig for to really find but may be a mirage from the exhaustion of searching for it. This beer walks a fine line, no chances are taken here and I don't applaud """play it safe""" experiments. Not much of anything here."
"Harvest Moon ranks among some of my top pumpkin ales, as it's flavors are light enough not to dominate the palate, allowing the solid pale ale nature of the brew to come through, but also subtle enough to let you know autumn has arrived. It won't unseat DFH Punkin' at the top of my list, but it's top 5."
"the first pumpkin ale of the season, i was so excited untill i tasted this one, the pumpkin was to strong and there was to much cloves and not enough cinnamon, this one was better left in nostallgia when pumpkin ales were new to me, i had a choise of this or post road. this was my favorit of the to but since then i have tryed pumking and punked by dogfish head and am spoiled from enjoying this lackluster macro brewed attempt at seasonal beer"
"Uh where's the pumpkin and spices? This is simply a copper colored American Wheat, far from a spiced ale according to my taste buds. Faint wheat aroma, Nice dark copper color with solid lacing from a good light tan head. Mouthfeel is somewhat thin and watery. Flavor is OK for a wheat but there is absolutely a lack of pumpkin and spice flavors. It's decent, had I rated this solely on the merit of being a spiced ale it would have tanked."
"If Coors slightly improved this it could get a favorable rating."
"Drinkability - It was too spicy for my liking, I don't like drinking spices, but this one would be a good way to warm up after a cold day outside. It's a warm beer that I couldn't drink more than 2 of."
"Purchased as part of """build-your-own-six-pack""" at local grocer. Medium foam head on a lovely amber body. Smell is unremarkable, with a flowery/herbal hint at the end. Upon drinking I have good question: where's the pumpkin? Almost non-existent, seemed decidedly watered down. If your gonna have a pumpkin ale, it's probably a good idea to have the pumpkin taste somewhere in there. Looking for a good one? Try the Lakefront Pumpkin Lager. Much better"
"This stuff pours a clear copper color and holds a suddy beige head. The nose has sweet malts and a some spices. The taste has mild malts with a tad of pumkin spiced with nutmeg and cinnamon. An average body goes some decently. Not my favorite pumpkin ale, but not bad considering who makes it."
"Taste is a bit mild for a pumpkin/spiced beer, could have been sweeter with a bigger malt backing, carbonation is medium high with a decent body, the pumpkin spicing tends to have a larger presence in the aftertaste which is surprising since most pumpkin beers it hits right away and fades quickly."
"This beer pours an orange amber color with a medium bodied tan colored head that laced the glass somewhat. The aroma was of some light malts and some sweet pumpkin spices - cinnamon and nutmeg mostly. The taste was pretty good for a pumpkin ale. It has a nice slightly roasted malt backbone that complements the nutmeg and cinnamon flavors for a pretty good taste. The mouthfeel was crisp yet smooth for a very drinkable pumpkin beer that was pretty enjoyable. I am looking forward to its release next year."
"This one poured out with a pretty nice head on it. I was skeptical to try a """pumpkin ale""" but I figured why not. It had a coppery orangish hue to it. Had the slightest pumpkin smell that barely came through along with clove and nutmeg? Smelled like """fall spices""" Slight hoppy taste with nothing to tell me this was a """pumpkin ale""" Average mouthfeel, not too heavy and not too light. I'd probably pass if offered this again."
"A good pumpkin ale is hard to come by in my estimation. Too many of these ales are overcome by artificial tasting spice and sweetness. This one is not much different. While better than some pumpkin ales I've tried, the deep pumpkin colored ale smells artificially sweet while the spiciness is overwhelmed by an off sweetness. Not terrible by any means, just a run of the mill pumpkin like so many others I've had but have not been impressed me. Not recommended."
"Transluscent deep amber colored pour with a big and lasting offwhite head in a pint glass. Smell is on the light side, but is nicely and traditionally spiced and sweet smelling. Taste is very light on pumpkin pie spice with a more standard malty finish. Somewhat light bodied and somewhat thin flavored as well. I definitely prefer more pumpkin and spice, however I actually prefer this to Dogfish Head's punkin beer. I'm sure it can still get quite a bit better as pumpkin beers go, but at least this still has me interested in finding them."
"Beer poured a burnt amber color with a tan sand colored head that did, despite so previous reviews, actually lasted a while. No lacing, no stickage. Smell was quite weak. Taste was a buttery pumpkin crust. A little oily feeling on the mouth with a dry finish. Smell was a little bit more of pumpkin seeds. Drinkability on this is about average, i can't really get myself to say wow."
"I stayed away from this from reading previous reviews, but after seeing it on sale for 2.99 a sixer, I took the chance to review it. The look was a clear amber with a head that dissipated quickly even with a pretty hard pour. Smell was slight spice and some malt. Taste was just average spiced beer flavor. No pumpkin, just spice with a slight grainy malt flavors adding in. Bittterness of hops is present but doesn't do much beyond adding bitterness. This beer doesn't live up to the style at all. It works more as a spiced ale."
"Nice amber - orange color, rather subdued head. Aroma is less pumpkin spices and more fruity, estery, hints of bubble gum and a nice crystal malt hint as well that would be killer if there were more spices. The flavor disappoints as well, the beer is lighter than I am looking for and thinner as well and is a little out of balance with slightly unpleasant bitterness. I tend to favor pumpkin and pumpkin spice ales that remind you of a liquid pumpkin pie and this doesn't get there at all. I feel like this is a gimmick; many people think ALL fruit/herb/spice beers are, and I disagree emphatically, but in this case I think Coors wanted a pumpkin beer and they made it very uninspiring (I actually like the white ale for what it is and their winter Belgian is OK too.) Drinkable but disappointing."
"D: A decent fall drink, that is different. An alright fall beer that was a little too... I'm not sure what... OK"
"I've probably had worse pumpkin ales, but I can't think of one at the moment. It looks like the suits at Coors decided to brew a pumpkin ale for their usual customers rather than for those who actually appreciate a well-crafted ale. I can't blame them for wanting to pay the bills, but that doesn't mean that any of us need to help them do so."
"Bottle: Thin copper orange color, thin white foam that disappeared quickly. Grains, and a bit of yeasty sourish smell. Some pumpkin-like smell, but not alot of spice, clove, etc. that I was expecting. Pretty average taste as well. A little hint of pumpkin, but not much else. Thin taste and mouthfeel. Worth trying for the sake of comparison, but falls short compared to some of the other examples."
"Somehow I was able to find this beer in mid-November after searching high and low for this brew in almost all local liquor stores in my area. As a fan of Blue Moon, I had high hopes for this brew after sampling almost every other pumpkin beer out there on the market. It poured a beautiful copper-amber color. The smell was sweet with a nice pumpkin aroma. Taste-wise, although this wasn't the greatest pumpkin ale I tried, this is up there with some of the best. I liked the nice, sweet, cinnamon-clove pumpkin flavor that was very noticeable and present. I'm happy that I was able to try this brew and didn't have to wait until next autumn to sample this. Although I prefered some other samples better, this is definitely worth a try if you're a fan of the style..."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Looks like your basic red, lots of head. Smells of pumpkin and sice, as expected. Tastes the same, with a good bit of alcohol warmth. Feels light on the tongue, fairly crisp finish except for the spices. Good enough to drink a few."
"Drinkability- A nice dinner or stay home and chill beer."
"Pours well and smells good, this beer actually seems to have a better flavor than the original blue moon, although I do enjoy the stronger citrus flavor in the original. This beer has a bit more spice and is a decent flavor for a seasonal. Overall this is a good beer and would recomend it, nice job."
"Tastes of toasted caramel, no apparrent spice flavor, lack of any kind of hops. It is smooth and creamy going down. Medium light in the mouth. Decent session beer for 3 or 4 and thats about it."
"The taste has a pumpkin bitterness ( if there is such a thing). Also has notes of spices ( cinnamon and nutmeg come to mind), a light roasted caramel malt and a nice dry faintly hoppy finish."
"D: I think this is the 3rd year they have put this out. The first two years were great. This year they must have cut back. I think Blue Moon is now getting into we are losing money on these seasonals so they are cutting back. To give you an idea they even renamed the beer. It is now even called Harvest Moon not Blue Moon pumpkin ale. I thought it just might have been my six pack but I had another bottle at a friend's at it was the same. The winter they just put out is fairly good. If you want a great pumpkin ale try this years (2007) Pumpking from Southern Tier. Hopefully they can see where the audience for this beer is for next year."
"The taste was alright, kinda right in the middle for this style. Had a bit of the macro lager taste in there despite the fact that this is an ale. But it also had some strong points. Like the last guy said, its not pure pumpkin pie, but its got some good pumpkin spiciness in there. The mouthfeel was a bit thin and overall this is a drinkable beer but I'm not sure I'd pay for it again in the future."
"Bought a six-pack of this at the grocery store because it was sunday and I live in Oklahoma so I was limited to 3.2% ABW crap and Blue Moon is usually one of the better choices when stuck with these limitations. Didnt really have high expectations and I am glad because I would have been disappointed. The beer poured a light caramel with a half-inch of head. I immediately noticed that it just looked """thin""". Everything about this beer fit nicely into that description. As far as I could discern there were no distinct aromas or flavors to speak of. Lightly malted with a very tiny hint of clove and cinnamon at the end and that is only when I was trying really hard to find anything that would make this a """pumpkin ale""" vs a """brown ale""". It was perfectly drinkable but definately not memorable. My least favorite of the Blue Moon family so far."
"I probibly have had worse, but when you get old, I want a good old fashion, refreshing brew, one that makes you want another and another ...! Not have to sip and force it down. I give this the REAL MOON !!!"
"This Blue Moon Pumpkin Ale seems to now be called """Harvest Moon.""" I wonder if Neil Young is getting any royalty checks? Pulpy amber body with lighter copper edges. Clear. Gauzy, dense, dirty beige head. Sticky, caramelized crystal malt notes mix with perfumey, floral fruits and spices (allspice, nutmeg, clove). A little too perfumey for me, but not bad. Slightly astringent grain up front. Soapy, biscuity malt follows. Semi-sweet, with a vegetal edge. Allspice and clove into the finish. Thankfully not over-spiced in flavor, this is better than several other pumpkin beers I've tried this season. Body is a little thin and soapy though."
"Cheap beer, and it tastes it."
"Nice fall sesonal beer, but nothing spectacular. The pumpkin taste is very subtle, and blends in pretty nicely with the malts, spices (nutmeg and cinnamon?) and a slight hop bitterness at the end. I haven't sampled many pumpkin beers, but this one was enjoyable."
"Pours a golden amber color with a nice dense egg-shell white head that dissipated into a nice cap. The smell is grainy, metallic, with a very subtle aroma of pumpkin and spice. The grainy smell kind of kills it for me for a brew that should be on the maltier side. The taste is of light pumpkin with some of the pumpkin pie spices, nutmeg and allspice. The pumpkin flavors are washed away by a grainy, watery base. The feel is watery and astringent, moderate carbonation, and finishes with misplaced bitter aftertaste. An average pumpkin ale at best. Honestly not much ale about it. It does have some decent pumpkin flavors but they are quickly neutralized by the grainy base of this beer."
"There are much better offerings out there. I doubt I will have another one of these. The odd bitterness is slightly off-putting. Needs spice."
"I'm kind of dissappointed w/ this one. Really not much flavor in this beer. Nothing stands out in this beer that would make me want to buy it again."
"Very nice russett with an enormous head that lingers. Subdued malt with the aroma, no pumpkin. Well carbonated, this is crisp and somewhat refreshing. But the tast is less than spectacular; this tastes like a macro lager to me.Againn no pumpkin and very dissappointing. Some non-BA friends brought this over expecting more flavor as well. It also has a bitter finish that won't go away."
"So I gave in on this one only because it was a seasonal. I am really not a fan of Blue Moon in general, but figured I would give this one a shot and see how it fared. I was actually pleasantly surprised. Poured a nice clear deep pumpkin colored amber with a huge off white fizzy and foamy head on the top. A ton of carbonation bubbling up from the bottom kept it replenished enough that it had some nice side glass lace present. The aroma was very inviting, tons of spice were blowing you away from the very beginning. I was quite impressed with how strong the aroma of nutmeg and spice coming off of it was. A nice malty and bread like back was apparent as well and this translated over to the taste wonderfully. A deep rich spiced flavor came over you immediately. It had the definite pumpkin pie spiced taste, but not overblown. This was subtle enough to get the pint across without being too sweet and really making you say enough. Great feel, nice and light with a great medium body and full flavor. The carbonation stuck around until the very end and made it feel very full. I easily could have had more then one and was quite surprised with how easy of a drinker it was. Overall I really actually enjoyed this. I have had some better seasonals before, but this was a solid offering and there was no doubt about it. I would not hesitate to try this one again, it was really well done and light enough to be sessionable. My first good experience from Blue Moon, heck it had to happen sometime."
"This was a pretty amber color with a medium sized white head. Very sweet malty aroma, with a fairly pronounced spiciness. The taste was malty with a persistant, obtrusive spiciness. This was a too spicy beer, one that wasn't very enjoyable. My wife likes these, fortunately. She can drink the rest."
"Balance: A good beer to have when relaxing at home. Can see having more then one for the night though."
"This was easy to drink but I really missed the pumpkin flavor."
"Drinkability: I finally gave this pumpkin ale a try. I was getting SICK of having local area beer store employees hold it up going, """Hey, you want this beer or what?""""
"Interesting, but I'm glad I bought just a single. If it tasted as good as it looks and smells, it would rock."
"Beer snobs can't be bothered to give this one good marks, but it's not bad at all. It's not among the best or worst pumpkin ales, performing decently in the middle-ground of the style."
"Hey, for a coors product, this is a pretty good one. Terrific looking beer, nice orange/amber color. Pours a nice head, but disappates quickly. Smells of corriander, pumpkin, and cinamon spices. If this were naturally carbonated, it may reveal better flavors. But highly drinkable, decent taste, a little light on the mouthfeel, but not a bad beer."
"Blue Moon Harvest Moon Pumpkin Ale pours a copper color with a white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is a tad sweet, malt being most noticeable. There is a very light mouthfeel. The flavor is very mild, perhaps a hint of clove as the bottle would suggest, but it's not really noticeable, there are some pumpkin pie like spices, but they are really pretty mild too. There is some pumpkin pie like after taste, but it's minimal. I'm not the biggest fan of pumpkin ales, this one didn't do much to change that opinion."
"In summary, a nice beer but not quite enough """pumpkin""" for me. Definitely worth a try."
"This is a beer that fades very quickly. The color is copperish amber, the head is nice, and it does retain for a bit. At first, the smell is all cloves, nutmeg, pumpkin, and other spices. This beer seemed to have potential. The initial taste wasn't bad, but the poor carbonation, flat malty taste, and the bland spiciness really compromised this beer. It got worse as it warmed to the point that I just didn't want to try anymore. As some reviewers stated, the name is a misnomer because this is a Coors product, and had I known, I would have skipped it altogether. Coors is a weak product and this one seems to fit into their target audience. Keep going if you are in the mood for a nice pumpkin ale. Perhaps the biggest problem here is that the backbone to this product is just a mediocre ale with additional flavoring."
"Taste: Underwhelming after the fantastic smell. Somewhat of a macro beer flavor introduction, but then finishes sweet and spicy with that delicious pumpkin pie note. If they had used a better base for the brew I think I would be in love. The pumpkin pie flavor lasts and lasts."
"d - crisp and very refreshing. this is easily drinkable and not a bad fall transitional beer."
"Pretty tasty in my book, a decent pumpkin beer."
"This is an easy beer to drink. It's a bit chewy and goes down pretty easily. I'm still trying to find a pumpkin ale that actually has a noticeable pumpkin flavor. For what it is, it's a fine beer to get in the mood for the season."
"I've been drinking alot of the fall releases and this one fits in good. Not too much pumpkin in this one as other brands but all in all I find this to be quite drinkable. Poured into my trusty pint glass, it pours a deep amber (I'm outside) and leaves little to no head. Not much smell, although I can pull out the allspice, which is pleasant, still looking for the pumpkin....the taste is nice and rich, kinda malty. A little lacing as it is drunk down but overall a calm brew. Has a nice finish, I get a caramel taste after the swallow, which is good, but where's the pumpkin? Overall as compared with the other fall brews I've been trying this one rates pretty good, I could probably sit and drink a six pack while watching the Yankees today. I'd like a little bit more pumpkin flavor but maybe it would blow away what Coors is trying to capture with this one."
"Pours a copper orange with a 1 finger, tightly packed white head. No lacing. Aroma is only faintly of Pumpkin Pie. A little nutmeg and clove and allspice are noted. Hints of cinnamon. Flavor is lacking. With the aromas coming out of the glass, I didn't expect the beer to be so bland. Not much spiced flavor. A little malty goodness, with a little bitterness, but no real pumpkin flavor. Mouthfeel is thin and a little watery. A little refreshing, but only because of its easy-drinking factor. I'll pass this one up next time."
"I could see a six pack going down very well on Halloween night. This one is a borderline decision as to whether I would seek it out again. Medium body is sticky and evident. A sixer is probably enough, but certainly try atleast one or four."
"Could drink a fiar amount of these, but heavier than most BM products"
"Not one of the better pumpkin ales. I decided to try this in my quest for the perfect pumpkin ale. Overall, it's not very impressive. Taste & smells like a macro brew with some mild pumpkin aftertaste. It's a pretty weak attempt at one of my favorite seasonal styles."
"Not a bad effort overall but nothing impressive either. Then again, none of the Blue Moon beers are that impressive to me anyway."
"This one is just OK. It could use a bit more ... something. Maybe the spices, maybe the pumpkin. I like it, but don't want to buy it again (that's half the reason for this post - to remind me not to get it again)."
"12oz bottle. Translucent red-amber body with a thin film of off-white head. Smells like pumpkin with hints of pumpkin pie spice. Tastes somewhat of pumpkin with cinnamon and nutmeg (?) rounding out the finish. On the lighter side of medium bodied with somewhat less carbonation than expected, which is a shame, since it would have helped the drinkability. After a while the spices dominate with little else getting through. Not incredibly impressed - I think AB's version was better - but not the worst pumpkin ale I've had."
"It's a solid beer, but one of my least favorite pumpkin ales. Too much hops and too little pumpkins. A bit too much carbonation for me with this type of beer. Though since pumpkin ales vary quite a bit, I would imagine this would be more appealing to others."
"I look forward to Blue Moon's Pumpkin Ale every year. It's not my favorite beer, but I do truly enjoy its uniqueness at 'harvest time.' Pumpkin pours nice a nice head, which disappears rather quickly. It has a nice amber color with, knowing its 'flavor' affects my imagination a bit, hints of dark orange. It's a very smooth drink, and the harvest/pumpkin flavoring are excellent, although I could go with it being a bit more pronounced. Still, the fall flavors come through nicely. The lacing doesn't last long and is more vertical than horizontal. The only average part of the beer is its aroma. It's not as strong as a pumpkin ale could be."
"D - This was one of my first experiences w/ the pumpkin ale style years ago along w/ Buffalo Bill's. It is not the best example IMO, but has an overall good drinkability. I could drink more of these than most pumpkin ales since it is not too high in abv and has less spice in the taste. I consider this quaffable, but won't go out of my way to taste it. I appreciate the fact that Blue Moon had a pumpkin ale before many mainstream examples were available."
"Drinkability- This beer really disappointed me. This was my first fall beer of the season and I was let down. It wasn't horrible but if I buy a pumpkin beer I want to taste pumpkins."
"Drinkability: One of the better Pumpkin Ales, I just wish the taste wasn't so tame. Has lots of potential...but comes short in a few area's."
"This beer pours like a perfect pumpkin ale--nice deep orange color with a white head. It doesn't have much of anything in the aroma. I don't detect really any pumpkin or pumpkin spice flavors. I wonder what they did to make this one--I know they have a pilot brewery that brews these Blue Moon beers, and I've heard the brewer on the basic brewing podcast say they sell their beer to the local ski resorts, but I'm beginning to think when Coors take his great beers and set them up for mass production in the big Coors plant, they reduce his recipe so it is tasteless like the American Lager. Too bad--would be a great beer. I'd call it a crossover, but it doesn't even have that much umph. Oh well."
"Pours a nice crisp deep copper with a thin head that is somewhat lasting. The aroma is almost nonexistent, just a very slight hint of malt and some pumpkin spice. The beer is a good blend of caramel malts, pumpkin and spice, even a hint of cinnamon. The beer is very light bodied with a smooth texture, low carbonation. This one is much more enjoyable than I expected from Coors."
"A true ale, sans the pumpkin. It tasted like a Sam Adams, with maybe some nutmeg added to the wort in limited quantity. Was let down, this should have been more of a lambic ale, as I thought it would have been by the name. Reminded me of Bar Harbor Blueberry ale, a sub-par ale with no blueberry taste to it. Blue Moon should stick to what they do well, making hefeweissens!"
"Not bad. Not great. But some chick left it in my fridge, so I certainly won't complain!!!"
"I would say that Blue Moon Harvest Moon is an above average beer for the fall. I would not grab for one of these beers outside the fall months, but it is definitely a very fitting beer for the fall. When I have a pumpkin beer, I expect much more of a pumpkin taste. Blue Moon Harvest Moon is a pumpkin beer, but to me it tastes more like an Octoberfest or a regular Amber beer."
"Drinkability- Well, this would be some very drinkable stuff, but that sourness hits and it gets all watery on my tongue. Given the choice of one Blue Moon beer above all others, I would take the wintertime seasonal. I looked long and hard for this one, and it came up as a disappointment when I finally got a taste. Worth a try, but not worth a repeat."
"Pours a dark orange/amber/red with a big head. The smell gets more noticeable and better with a pumpkin/allspice odor as you continue to drink it. Has a hoppy character more than anything, with hints of spice. It says 5.6% abv but I cant taste any of the alcohol. Medium mouthfeel with a little malt backbone. Overall an enjoyable beer. Having one is enough, I dont think I would drink a six pack of this."
"Pours a clear orange (maybe leaning my yellow than red) with a well developed, tan head. Nicebut not crazytrails of carbonation rising from the Smell was faint yeasty-spice with a bit of malty sweetness below. The following is not necessarily a criticism: If I didnt know there was pumpkin in this brew, I wouldnt pick it up in the smell. Maybe sharper noses among ye would. Theres definitely a touch of pumpkin in the taste, as well as what seems to me likeof all thingscoffee, but that may just be the way I tasting the spice. Also taste a bit of orangey citrus. Sweetness is not too much in general, but may be too much for summer drinking. Mouthfeel was medium-to light with carbonation offering a bit of sharpness in the first part of the taste. Overall, this was a fun beer, but not really an everyday beer for me."
"Overall, My favorite parts of this beer is how it looks and smells. The taste is leaving me wanting more, but is not bad. I have been ready to get my hands on some pumkin ales for a while, this is a decent early start."
"Overall I was suprised, I liked this beer and might try it again."
"Poured an orange/copper color with white head that dissipated rather quickly. Faint aroma of spices. The taste is a weak malty flavor that finishes with a bit of spice. Mouthfeel was pretty good with this one and it is quite smooth. Drinkability is high, but the taste leaves me wanting more. Lacing was minimal."
"Overall impression: Drinkable and not over the top with the spices. Not the best out there, but not a bad choice considering its price and availability."
"would drink again though."
"overall this is a good beer, but i dont think i will buy it in the future i was I am kind of dissapointed that the pumpkin flavor wasnt stronger"
"A hard pour gives you three fingers of light tan head that leaves a bit of lace. Sits on top of a amber brown body. Nose has a slight spicey pumpkin feel withe notes of minerals and nuttiness. Nice even richness is acompinied by a nutty mineral spice feel. Pumpkin is only a hint on the palate and mouthfeel. Very much a hue on the finish. Spice, mineral mix comes off more like a nut brown ale and is very drinkable and pleasant. Not overly pumpkin if thats what your looking for, but quite good overall."
"Good drinkability the spice might get to be to much after about four or so. Overall very good, one of my favorite seasonals and rather affordable."
"Either my memory is really, really bad or this was indeed the first commercially brewed pumpkin ale to turn up in the Twin Cities market. Along with the other, since-discontinued Blue Moon brands it was well-liked and remained fondly remembered . . . until now. I first tried this over ten years ago but don't recall it tasting like . . . this! Alcohol pervades the nose and overwhelms the malt-profile of this otherwise well-remembered brew, and that ain't a good thing, it means this brew lacks balance. Theres some spice up there in the nose but . . . booze and spice? Theres a Cap n Coke with your name on it in any bar in town, why go for this? Some pale, biscuity malt present throughout, but the weight of the spice and the booze tends to overwhelm it. Seems a bit thin, but it's on par for the style (at least considering the other commercial examples of a pumpkin beer). No real pumpkin presence/flavour to speak of, just a pale malt spice booze logjam all up in the joint. And carbonation . . . a touch overly-carbonated, like a selzer. And the sweetness: next to the booze and spice it's quite prominent. Not a pumpkin beer (let alone a fruit/vegetable beer) that I'd recommend to others, and I'd probably turn down a free one if it was offered. Still, if you haven't tasted a better-made pumpkin ale you'll love this and will call my store and be pissed-off that we're out of stock (don't blame me! The local wholesaler ordered it in a VERY limited quantity, blah blah blah) There *are* other Pumpkin Ales out there, ya know . . . branch the hell out, girls!"
"Decent Pumpkin Ale. Light and understated (uninteresting). Not bad, but not top-notch."
"D: I'm not a huge fan of pumpkin beers and this one is no exception. To be fair, this beer is decently balanced and lacks a lot of the qualities that I really dislike in pumpkin beers. Its not overly seasoned, nor sweet and had a decent drinkability, although one is plenty for me."
"Overall Impression: Well, kudos for going big on flavor. Its a pumpkin tasting ale. Not the best Pumpkin ale Ive had, but not too bad."
"Pours copper colored white a white head which quickly recedes to a thin film. Faint spices in aroma. Flavor is malts and faint spices. Medium light bodied. Its drinkable, but nothing impressive. I'm glad I only bought one of these, This is my least favorite pumpkin beer so far."
"These seems like an Oktoberfest style of beer and I think it is a very good one. Better than Sam Adams Oktoberfest which I feel is way too spicey."
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve-ounce brown glass longneck bottle, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"D - Bought several 6's last year prior to being a true beer advocate. Bought one 6 this year and probably won't buy it again. Not even the idea of pumpkin exists within this brew."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle with a freshness date. Had a nice dark cooper color with just a bit of head that quickly dissipated. The smell was just OK and not as good as other pumpkins I've had. It was kinda weak on the pumpkin and pumpkin spice smell. The taste wasn't much better. I'll admit this is not my favorite beer style but even so it was weak for the category. Overall, it's just an OK beer and maybe worth the every couple years try. Recommend only if looking to mark off list. (2, NA, ML,N)"
"detect some citrusy orange notes, followed by a slight bready pumpkin flavor. Nutmeg comes through and allspice also does a little. Body is weak and mouthfeel is too fizzy. Not too much pumpkin or too much spice. Had this before and retained fonder memories than my experience now. Carbonation is a little rough on the tongue and the esophagus. Nothing worth buying, but drinkable if free."
"D: I would get this again. Nice for a coors product."
"The lable says it is flavored with clove, nutmeg, and allspice, and that is basically what you smell and taste in here, but no hint of pumpkin. There is a light malty flavor to go along with all the spices, but overall it's kind of bland and disappointing. If you're going to call something a pumpkin ale I would expect it to have more of a pumpkin flavor to it rather than just the taste of other fall spices. Not that this is terrible, it's an OK beer with a light to medium mouthfeel and moderate carbonation, but I was disappointed in it's lack of pumpkin flavor."
"Overall, a decent brew (i've had better pumpkin ales though); i would like to try another."
"Drinkability--A little too much pumkin going on for me to attemt more than one of these at a sitting."
"D - Not bad, it is mildly flavored, but not very tasty. It is a quaffable brew, and, surprisingly, not a total insult to pumpkin ales. I think I'll take other options in the future though."
"Dull copper color. Only head is a thin film. Smell of the faintest spicyness but not nearly enough to really be called a pumpkin ale. Taste gives just a trace more of a pumpkin pie flavor but it falls short of delivering any real flavor. Very thin on the mouthfeel and overcarbonated. Not impressed at all."
"This could use more pumpkin flavor, and more flavor in general. It might be somewhat easy to drink, but not if in the mood for a good pumpkin ale, as it is almost missing the main feature. Barely touches the surface of what it should be. Too many better pumpkin ales out there now to bother with this one."
"D - I dunno...it's just very disappointing. I'm annoyed by it to - I picked it up at a bar and a few guys that were there had tried it because it was on sale...all of a sudden they were talking like they were experts. But I digress...it's not a poor-tasting beer, it's just a very cheap pumpkin-flavored one. If you're expecting a high quality pumpkin ale, stay away. It is refreshing for the price, though."
"This pumpkin ale is a good beer. I would recommend trying it, although I think a whole six pack of it would be too much of a good thing."
"Pours into the stout glass a brownish-orange clear color with good transparency and many tiny bubbles cascading up. Head is initially about two fingers of dark tan foam, but it quickly fades leaving a solid cap and minimal lacing. Nose is pleasant and ale-like with sweet malt and clove evident. Definite spice presence. Tastes sharply sweet up front punctuated with a clove bite, mellows somewhat toward the middle into more of a doughy malt, but the spices remain, somewhat overwhelming the underlying malt. If nutmeg, clove, and allspice are your thing, youll likely enjoy the flavor. Id prefer a more subtle spice presence, myself. Mouth is pretty watery with little body, but short of being too thin. Decent carbonation on the tongue. Drinkability is fair; personally I wouldnt want to drink too many. It leaves an overwhelming taste of spice on my tongue. Id pair one of these with traditionally spiced Thanksgiving fare. Worth a try."
"This seasonal from Coors was a nice surprise. A: Deep amber with appropriate carbonation and head. Light lacing that dissipated quickly.S: Memories of mom's pumpkin pie: light nutmeg, cinnamon and cloves with pumpkin sweetness T: Less than the nose hints at, but nicely crisp and light with the aforementioned spices rounding out an everpresent pumpkin earthiness. M: light and smooth a surprisingly refreshing mouthfeel D: I typically don't expect to session spiced or fruit beers, but this one is an exception. I would recommend picking up a six pack of this seasonal ale."
"This brew pours a very pretty hazy copper color with a medium light tan head with good retention. Thin, stringy lacing. The aroma is kind of weird, with pumpkin and other vegetables in the forefront, as well as a bit of spice. Light-bodied with mild pumpkin and malt flavor. The flavor is kind of off, and the pumpkin disappears pretty quickly, leaving a fairly bland lager flavor in its wake. The finish is mildly sweet and short. Could be better."
"A bit of a letdown, really."
"Blue Moons was pretty good. Nothing special, but Id certainly buy it again."
"Pretty bland, but it's not bad. Obviously there are much better pumpkin beers out there, but this isn't horrible. Probably one that would appeal to a decent number of people. I won't recommend it, but would drink it in a pinch."
"D - just not an enjoyable brew."
"Pours to an amber-copper color with an off-white head that diminishes to a ring. It leaves a bit of lacing when sipped down. The aroma is light in malt and pumpkin pie spices. Not alot there. The flavor is of caramel malts and the light pumpkin spices. It is easy drinking, and not overpowering in the spices like other pumpkin brews. This one is ok."
"This is a drinkable beer. Its not unlike a typical Marzen, with a vegetable (pumpkin) angle. Ive never really eaten pumpkin, so I dont know how pronounced that flavor is in this beer. I put this largely in the Oktoberfest category, and its not bad."
"Inoffensive, but comes off as an odd-tasting Blue Moon Belgian White. Its kind of a mish-mash of spice and light beer. Really, nothing unpleasant, but unless given a body for free, I doubt I'd touch the stuff. Maybe something to ween the kids of Keystone?"
"Drinkability: I do like this offering from Blue Moon/Coors and will not hesitate to drink a few durring each brewing season , but for some reason the cinnamon ratio is just way to high without much else to counterbalance it all out. Other than that small flaw this is a pretty good beer!"
"Drank this straight from the bottle, so I couldn't get a good look, or smell, of this beer. Mouthfeel is mostly light and creamy, a good amount of carbonation and body. Taste is mostly of spices, not overpowering though. There was very little that I could pick up on with the taste of pumpkin, but mostly the spices came through and malts. Overall a very pleasant surprise and a good seasonal beer."
"D - It wasn't bad. I don't like pumpkin but I thought this beer was pretty good. I don't think I would get it again, though. It just wasn't what I want out of a beer."
"This is a very seasonable brew. I was very pleased."
"I was not all to pleased with the taste of this beer. It could be because I was comparing it with several Oktoberfests that I had drank throughout the day, but the beer just left much to be desired in my opinion. It is a good mass-produced beer for the season for sure, it's taste is better by the second one, and it can be found in many places."
"The case is gone.... and I'll probably not choose to purchase it again unless it goes on sale."
"Couple that with the fact that Coors is the parent company for this brand and you must come to the conclusion that this is a micro brew recipe formulated and produced without the attentive care it requires. The overall mass production process has to leave you with the impression that the quality has been compromised."
"drinkability - it was a very smooth easy drinking beer.not overly spicy nor too much pumkin flavor very nice beer will definatly purchase again."
"Overall a good drinkable ale. Would be better it relabeled as Blue Moon's Amber Ale."
"Taken as a whole, this beer has little to offer the lover of pumpkin brew or any other brew. It isnt as good as Blue Moon Belgian White (the companys best seller) and it isnt as good as most other pumpkin brews. Its a seasonal beer to avoid."
"Clean, simple, and drinkable, but I prefer a little more interesting seasonal character in pumpkin beers."
"Cheers!"
"Overall: Not bad, just not great. I like my pumpkin beers with some actual pumpkin flavor and spiciness. This tasted more like an Oktoberfest beer to me."
"Overall, a pumpkin beer that is intriguing, in complex flavors and strong earthy autumn feel, nice raw pumpkin taste, but leaves a bitter taste on the finish."
"M&D - the mouthfeel is smooth, slightly fizzy, but with this odd flavor combination the drinkability is rather low"
"Pours amber. Nice white head,and decent lacing. Smell is of weak malty pumpkin spice. Body is medium, not much carbionation. Taste is of malted pumpkin, with some earthy undertones,and spice. Not awful, but not great either.I liked Saranac much better."
"D-Not a big fan, wouldnt want to even finish one. Not recommended to anyone. Pick anything else, not this."
"This beer poured a beautiful clear amber color with a thick head. The smell is strong and slightly sweet. The taste is malty and mellow with a subtle pumpkin spice taste. The mouthfeel is a little thin with a clean finish. I was surprised with this beer  I wasnt sure I would like a pumpkin ale. Id consider this a very drinkable fall beer."
"My second BMC seasonal of the week! Poured from a 12 0z single. Looks Ok I suppose..red/amber with a largish tan head. Not much aroma to this at all, least its not too unpleasant, some cinnamon, spice and a touch of pumpkin, hardly noticable though. Tse is very average..mostly malts with a surge of cinnamon and a small amount of sweet potato pie..man this is more a sweet potato ale!! Not good on the palate quite cloying and saccarine sweet. Over all this was not horrendous but have to say the boys from St.Louis stomped all over the Denver guys in pumpkin ales."
"Drinkability: Not the best pumpkin beer I have tasted, but it is better than the average offering from Coors. I give them credit for branching out with the Blue Moon line. This bber is refeshing, but seems somewhat restrained by Coors desire to not get too crazy."
"On a personal note, I feel like too many companies are trying to deliver pumpkin ales these days, perhaps either rushing a poor formula to the market or attempting to deliver a 'bridge beer,' developed for the palate of a BMC drinker that wants to look cool with a pumpkin beer in their hands. I thought this was a beer style that was the exclusive territory of quality beer makers, but no more."
"I think Coors was playing safe with this beer and that's disapointing, but not surprising. This beer falls well short for this style and does not even come close to beers like Postroad's (Brooklyn Brand) Pumpkin Ale, Saranac Pumpkin Ale, or Dog Fish Head's Punkin' Ale."
"I will have a few more of these as the leaves begin to fall."
"Overall, it's a pretty decent, toasty and biscuity fall offering with a gentle sprinkling of spice that lends to it's character, and thus drinkability. You could have more than a few of these without overdoing it on spice; on the other hand, for some there might not be enough spice to satiate."
"however, you have to try something at least once."
"This beer is almost like a case study in how pumpkin affects beer flavor because it seems like this could be an average, non-descript yellow-hued pilsener with english hopping except for the pumpkin. In this case, I think that adding the pumpkin takes a beer I wouldn't ordinarily drink and turns it into something passable. It's drinkable, but I do feel a little guilty for asking my local liqour store owner to special order some."
"After having Blue Moon's full citrus flavored wheat ale I was a little disappointed in their pumpkin ale. It had a forward pumkin taste but it was not nearly as sweet and an almost undetectable amount of spice. I don't think it'd even pair well with a piece of pie. There are defintely better pumpkin ales out there."
"Blue Moon Pumpkin Ale was orange-amber in color and clear. The white head had decent retention and left some lacing behind. The aroma was pumpkin pie spices with a little malt. The taste was light pumpkin and spice over a light malt backround. It was light to medium in body with medium carbonation. The drinkability was average. A decent fall brew."
"RERATE: Tasted this blind at a friend's house and asked if they slipped some generic lager in one of the glasses just to test me. It turns out it was this beer. Yellow-amber and slightly sulfurous, this beer is light on the pumpkin and spice, and even lighter on the palate. I don't know if I can hate Coors over this beer specifically, but it definitely gives me no reason to like them."
"DA: Easy to drink physically, but mentally it is a bit of a challenge after the second. Quality is actually a bit higher than what I was expecting with this one."
"Poured a clear, dark orange-amber with a thick head. Good lacing that lasted throughout the beer. Smell was malty and surprisingly almost devoid of spices. Taste is like roasted pumpkin seeds, very surprising but not bad at all. Again, less spice than I was expecting, but with the amount of pumpkin flavor that is okay. Mouthfeel is average, not overwhelmingly thick or thin. Not the greatest pumpkin ale I have had, but overall a better effort than most."
"This Pumpkin ale poured a beautiful amber orange color with a thick foamy head that dissipates into a nice thin head for the remainder of the drink. Nice pleasant spice aromas that aren't too overwhelming. I loved the taste of this pumkin ale! This is the smoothest pumpkin ale I have ever tasted, I could drink quite a few of these in succession with the last going down as easy as the first. The perfect amount of sweetness with mild hints of spice that makes this one stand out from other pumpkin brews."
"Drinkability- Overall, this is a good beer as long as you don't expect the pumpkin taste. Grabbing a 6 pack of this and plopping it down for a party isn't a bad decision, trust me you could do a lot worse. As much as I hate AB I would have to say that the Jack's Pumpkin Ale is definately better."
"D - I wouldnt go out of my way to get this again."
"Its a good beer. But its not an excellent beer. The problem is that its not distinct. If I put down a blonde ale, you wouldnt be able to tell the difference. However, it is a good beer and you will certainly impress your friends if you put down a six-pack for everyone to enjoy."

"It pours a nice copper color with a decent off-white head that doesn't last too long. The aroma is mostly grain, malt and just a little bit of spice, but the aroma is pretty weak. The taste is mainly bready and malty, with a little bit of pumpkin and spice and a bit of a pumpkin aftertaste. The mouthfeel is on the thin and watery side, but it does go down smooth and is non-offensive. Overall it's an average beer, nothing impressive at all."
"Pours a clear bright copper color with creamy off white head. Nose is quite faint with some pumpkin and spice. Taste much like the aroma is too faint and watery. The taste of pumpkin and clove that is present is not all that pleasant. Overall, this is a pretty weak attempt at a Pumpkin Ale. I give Coors credit for trying, but they need to go back to the drawing board on this one."
"Pours a bright, transparent copper with a foamy head that vanishes rather quickly. The smell is rather faint and lacks the expected pumpkin scent I was hoping for. The taste is smooth but watery. I noticed a decent amount of pumpkin spice on the first sip, but didn't taste much pumpkin. Not bad, but not as advertised. The mouthfeel is again more toward the weak side with not much going on in this area. The smooth, easiness makes it drinkable but not exciting enough for a session brew IMO."
"Drinkability- sure- much like a natty in college with a bit of flavor."
"Here is a brew that looks really good but doesn't taste like much. Had a hard time smelling and tasting for pumpkin or any spices that would compliment this seasonal brew. The brew had a light body and very fizzy carbonation that left me burping all over the place."
"Very sweet and not enough flavor, and the breadiness being a little disturbing as well. My non-beer friend commented on how much lack of pumpkin there was. A weak and mundane offering."
"D: It's OK, and I could see it as a pretty decent dessert beer, depending on what you're serving."
"Very happy to see pumpkin ales back on the store shelves - that's how I know it's truly fall! Poured this from a 12 oz. bottle with a bottling date of January 28. Poured a beautiful clear pumpkin color. Small head that cleared up pretty quickly. Very little lacing on the glass. Warms smells of clove, allspice, nutmeg, as expected. Not terribly strong. Tastes began with a mellow maltiness. Obviously some pumpking flavors in there. Nicely spiced, but I think it could be stronger. Touch of hops at the end. Medium creaminess and low carbonation in the mouthfeel. Overall a beautiful beer, lovely and drinkable, although perhaps the spicing could have more punch. Still, it's easy to quaff on a cool autumn evening."
"This one is watery, weak, and pretty mundane. I think that non-BAs would get a kick out of this one as it is not very complex or overwhelming. It doesn't really taste like pumpkins, spices, or ale for that matter. But, it was under six bucks for a sixer so I can't really complain."
"D- kind of a fun get together with some buddies and enjoy during the fall season kind of beer. Maybe if i get curious or offered one i'll go after this one again."
" Eric"
"This is the first time I've had more than a sample of a Pumpkin Ale; I'd probably enjoy it a bit more if I liked pumpkin pie. However, I think this beer would be pretty good if paired with appropriate foods for the style."
"-UF"
"Tastes of pumpkin and ginger ( i think). The fruit of the Blue Moon is present throughout with the hint of malt. some hops."
"It depends on if you like your pumkin beer to be """Pumkiny""" or more like beer. For me I was expecting a pumkin flavored beer and thats what I got. I liked it more than the New Holland Ichibod or """ICKY BAD""" as we call it at the store. poured out a copper color and quickly formed a big 2 or 3 finger head. Easy to drink and I didn't taste the pumkin untill the aftertaste. Had to drink it fast though, the longer it sat, like only 7 or 8 mins it started to get skunky. Good for football watchin and turkey leftovers."
"Pours a clear orange, small white head forms, no lace to speak of. Smell is pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg, pretty malty, better than expected. Taste is sweet, with pumpkin and spice. Mouthfeel is really light, with low to medium carbonation. Not bad, better than I thought. Thanks DrJay."
"A nice holiday specialty beer....not as complex and interesting as some of the other pumpkin beers but interesting to try one."
"12 oz bottle pours a clear orange color with a nice creamy off white head that leaves minimal lacing in my glass. Aroma of pumpkin pie spices, a bit sweeter than I expected. Cinnamon, allspice and regular pumpkin pie flavors, medium bodied with a slightly watery mouthfeel, finishes spicy, not bad."
"Glad I only bought one."
"Mostly clear orange/amber colour topped by off-white foam. Slight chill haze problem. The head reduces quickly to a ring and fine lacing. Sweet aroma with strong, but unbalanced, spices (mostly nutmeg I think...). The flavour follows suit, but seems washed out and thin. Spices linger in the finish, along with slight bitterness. The body starts out light, then the bottom drops out and it becomes quite watery at the finish. Moderate carbonation and off-dry. The thin flavour and body really hurt this beer and throw the balance off."
"This ale had a bright orange color and good carbonation. I could taste the pumpkin but not much else in terms of spices, which are usually found in pumpkin ales. The flavor was reminiscent of canned pumpkin pie filling. I thought this was a good tasting brew."
"This pumpkin ale pours a nice copper color. The head was very nice and foamy, staying for some time. Unfortunately, the smell was not of pumpkin or any other spice which I could recognize. The taste was sadly bland. Certainly a pumpkin ale which could be skipped."
"This is OK, I liked it better than the more dry pumpkin I recently tasted."
"Update 2007. Now called """Harvest Moon""". Now it seems to taste much better. That macro twang is mostly gone, the mouthfeel is not ruddy, and there is a nice balance between the malts and the spice. Score updated to reflect my most recent tasting."
"Drinkability: A bit too sugary for me; not much else going on compared to other pumpkins I have tasted; drinkable but undistinguished"
"A bit of an underachiever, although I generally don't rate Blue Moon too highly anyway. I'd like to see more pumpkin flavor and sweet spice. Nothing doing. I definitely place it last among pumpkin beers I've tried. Go for Post Road instead."
"A nice fall ale of pumpkin flavor absolutely perfect for watching the Autumn leaves float down off of the trees and maybe even for raking the leaves as well."
"Pours a tan-orange color with a very minimal fizzy head that dissipates immediatley. The nose reminds me of an ipa, but milder. I also sense some sort of roasted malts as well. The taste is also much fainter than I had expected. It tastes like a cheap, really boring ale. The only thing I notice that even reminds me of pumpkin is the spices that go along with pumpkin pie. And even those are stretched quite thin. The mouthfeel is too thin, it feels like a light beer, or even lighter. The drinkability is okay, I mean it goes down well. It just doesnt taste good, smell right, feel right, or live up to any of the expectations I had. I hope I wasn't expecting too much, but this beer did not impress me at all."
"Drinkability  This is an extraordinarily drinkable beer, especially for the style. I recommend this and I think in a blind tasting people would not know its a pumpkin beer."
"My least favorite pumpkin beer to date."
"An OK seasonal beer. I wouldn't want to drink this all year but once or twice a year is OK."
"It's odd, I bought a six of this maybe 4-5 years ago, if I recall correctly, and I enjoyed it then. Either my palate has refined considerably, or the quality of this seasonal brew has diminished greatly. I don't know which? I sampled two bottles last night, and now I have four more that I don't know what to do with. I wouldn't waste my time with this macro pumpkin ale - NOT a good representation of the category in any way, shape, or form. A disappointment."
"Drinakbility: ditto"
"Poured into a pint glass the head rose quickly to 1 1/2 fingers and dwindled just as fast to a lace that streaked the glass sparatically down. Very nice amber/orange hue, not hazy, but translucent in a way a good looking beer. The taste is sweet at first then grainy with a spicy hop finish, the problem for me was between the sweet and the hop bite there is a void where a full body beer would not have one. It is missing something but I do not know what. Very water feel was my biggest knock here. This one is not bad, I will probably not choose it again however."
"After the crown is removed and the beer poured in to a nice clean nonick glass it appears a slightly hazy amber with a distinct orange tint, the head smallish and frothy, the lace scraggly and off white in color. Nose is spicy pumpkin and sweet malt, start is sweet with a fair to middling grain presence and the top light to moderate in feel. Finish has a decent acidity, the hops adequate, very dry aftertaste, just another ho-hum pumpkin beer."
" I enjoy BMPA, and would recommend it to someone who would like something different, and that goes along with the season. Nice ABV (5.77%) keeps you warm on those cool, """Moonlit""" October nights. And no reason to be """Blue""" about this seasonal. It's worth a try. And as I always say, enjoy IT (whatEVER brew you're sampling) for what IT IS. I'm sure there are better pumpkin ales """out there", but for the price, availabilty, and drinkability, Blue Moon is the one to grab. Cheers and Happy Harvest Time!"
"Fairly smooth and creamy. Beer for pumpkin pie lovers? Well, it could be worth a try."
"This is definitely not my favorite pumpkin brew."
"I am very dissapointed in this beer. I wasn't expecting the best, but I was expecting better, if you are looking for a pumpkin ale, don't waste your time or money here."
"As to the drinkability of this beer, I would have to say that I would definitely have another. Overall, for the first seasonal beer I have ever had I am quite impressed."
"While I will be able to finish this beer, it is pretty much the bottom of the barrel *of the pumpkin ales I don't have to pour out*. It's drinkable but lacks a lot of flavor or depth of character. Pours a deep orangey amber and smells like a maltier version of their Belgian White. Spicy like the latter, with not much trace of pumpkin. Flavor has an odd, though not unpleasant estery thing going on, mild hop bitterness and some artificial-tasting spices. Where's the pumpkin? Where's the beef man? Mouthfeel lis lightly carbonated and crisp. If you told me this was Belgian White with dye added for a darker color, I'd probably believe it."
"drinkability: I'm plerasantly surprised. With a flavor like pumpkin les is more, otherwise you end up drinking something akin to liquid squash. Blue Moon did a good job here accenting the beer with pumpkin and spice but still allowing the malt and hops to take center stage. If you're looking for an autumnal seasonal you could do worse than this."
"THE BLOODHOUND FACTOR: Peaches seemed to dig the spices, and found this one do-able. Benjie was either uninterested, or intimidated by his sisters aggressive take on the brew."
"I couldn't drink many more of these. Because it's pretty over the top, the sweetness and spicing gets a little sickening by the end. Nice as a single, though, to get you in the halloween mood."
"if your idea of a good time is eating pumpking pie and drinking high life maybe you'll enjoy this...but i doubt it."
"This pours an orange/copper in color with a small bubbly head. The smell is sweet and spiced. The taste is great, very clean. It is malty and tastes like pumpkin pie. I am tasting some clove and nutmeg in there. This is totally different than the regular blue moon belgian white and its not too bad. It is a nice autumn tasting brew. The mouthfeel is moderate and creamy, simple."
"Body a tad lacking at just under medium. Mouthfeel light and somewhat pillowy, still easy to drink. Aftertaste sweet and spicey."
"Pours a pumpkiny orange color, small head, pretty good lacing. Mostly smells malty, with maybe a hint of spice. Just a hint. The taste has more character, with some pumpkin to complement the malt and spices. Actually tastes pretty good, considering, you know, that it's a) a pumpkin ale, and b) made by Coors. A perfectly suitable session beer with a hint of character, but nothing more."
"I saw this one at the store today and decided to give it a go. And I found that it was no suprise that this beer was just average at best. The pour was ok with a copper color body and a decent size head but it faded quickly and left no lace whatsoever. There was not much smell at all to the brew but what I could sniff were mostly sweet malts and faint spices. As for the taste, I was expecting more. The subtle sweetness from the malts and the light spiciness tasted good, but it was too weak. If they would have used the same flavoring but kicked it up a couple notches this beer would not taste half bad. As it is, it's another watered down product from Coors."
"I gave this 4's across the board. I don't know why so many people have given this such a poor score. On the other hand, this is the only pumpkin ale I have ever had, so, perhaps when compared to others, this one isn't very good. What ever the case, I really like this one. It poured an orangy-copper with little head. Only a white ring of lace around the outside edges. Decent lacing. The smell is very """appropriate""" for seasonals this time of year. Plenty of sweetness in the smell, as well as spice. A tiny bit of clove with a healthy dose of nutmeg. Excellent. The taste, too, is """par for the course""" for autumn seasonals. A little bready/yeasty. Some spice is certainly evident in the taste. This would be really good with some honey glazed ham. Mouthfeel is nice. Not too heavy, nor too light. Very ever so slightly syrupy. Just slightly enough to add some weight to the liquid. Overall, while not impressed or stunned, I still thought it was very nice indeed and will likely buy it again."
"Having just purchased a 6-pack of this pumpkin ale, I seemed to have forgotten how much this beer disappointed me with previous tastes. Overall the appearance and smell seem week for beers in this category, but the mouthfeel and taste linger far past what I would prefer. Simply put I was not nearly as happy with the taste in this beer as I had hoped, and would not recommend this pumpkin ale."
"This is a decent example of the style. It doesn't get all its pumpkin-pie on, like Dogfish Head's Punkin', but it is enough to make it interesting. It's like an IPA with a twist of pumpkin. The mouthfeel is a little thin, and the spices over stay their welcome a bit in the aftertaste, but otherwise, this is a decent brew."
"Overall: I really like the Blue Moon White, and I went into this one really, really wanting to like it! This isn't a Coors-hating thing, but this brew was really a flavor disaster. Generally with pumpkin ales the worst-case scenario is that it's overspiced and tastes too much like pumpkin pie, but this one finds another way to mess it up. Not recommended."
"Not a great pumpkin Ale, I'll have to try some more and see if it's just me."
"Pours light ruby brown with orange highlights. Two finger head is off white and holds well. Not much for lacing, but a ring of foam remains to the last sip. Smell is malty and lightly hopped, with a fresh pumpkin scent dominating. Sweet toasted malt and pumpkin flavor. Very mild hops are just enough to dry any residual sweetness and balances the flavor well. Medium body and good carbonation lend a smooth mouthfeel. Easy to drink not overly spiced. This is a good seasonal with great flavor I'll look forward to next fall."
"It seemed like a good idea when I was at the store. Actually, not a bad beer, but other breweries have made pretty good Pumpkin ales with success. I shouldn't expect the same from this. Pours an orange-rust color. Highly carbonated. Almost fizzy head. Aromas of grain (cereal) with some pumpkin thrown in. Flavors of pumpkin and Thanksgiving spices (cinnamon, clove, nutmeg) add to the light malty sweetness. Mouthfeel leaves much to yearn for--weak and a bit over carbonated. Finishes with a bitterness that is more astingent than hop derived. The flavors are fine, but I feel like all pumpkin and spices are artificial and have not melded well. Weak body doesn't help."
"Clear orange/copper color, with not too much head on the pour, fading to practically nothing quickly. Nutmeg and sour pumpkin is about all I get from the nose, not to appealing, also a little malt present, but not too much. Taste is rather bland, not a lot of pumpkin flaovr coming through, and what is there during the aftertaste is sweet, and rather cloying. Ech. Not a very good beer, and as far as pumpkin ales go, I would definitely skip it."
"Slàinte!"
"Overall a disappointing rendition of one of my most anticipated and favorite seasonal beer styles. I have nothing nice to say about this beer other than it's appearance is quite attractive. I'm glad my beer guy singled one out for me ($1.19) as I'd be upset if I bought an entire sixer."
"Overall, drinkable, and although the flavors are light, you know it's a pumpkin beer and mighty approachable at that."
"When I first saw pumpkin ale, I was little scared and excited at the same time. Poured an attractive amber color with nice white head. Smell is predominately of pumpkin and spices and very nice. Tste is a bit toasty with pumpkin and spices added. Finished very pleasant in the mouth with goood pumpklin spices. A very good seasonal beer."
"Last swigs: Watery apple butter. For the market crowd only. Even the label says that this is """flavored""" ale."
"This beer poured with a couple lumps into a 1/2 finger head that lingered a little while down to a nice frothy topped covering that lasted throughout the rest of the beer. The color was a very nice pumpkin color (duh?) that reminded me of a fresh peach seed. Lacing looked good. There was a strong pumpkin aroma sort of like when you first pull pumpkin pie from the frig after being leftover from Thanksgiving a week later. The taste was sort of overpowering with flat pumpkin flavor. It could have been a tad sweeter or good with a little more hop flavor. Somethings missing, it seems just a little to mild. Mouthfeel was light, but frothy on the back of the tongue. Almost right."
"Drinkability was terrible. I forced myself to drink one thinking maybe it would get better, but didn't. Will never, ever drink another."
"I think this ale would pair well with the heartier seasonal foods."
"This pumpkin ale poured a clear, deep amber color with creamy, light yellowish foam that settled. The smell was slightly sweet and malty with light spices (cinnamon and nutmeg). The taste was slightly sweet and tangy and malty with light pumpkin pie spices and a hint of caramel, and a spicy sharpness in the finish. The mouthfeel was tangy but smooth with medium body and modest carbonation. The lightly sweet and spicy flavor lingered. This was an OK beer, but a bit too sweet with too little actual pumpkin flavor or texture."
"Nice mellow pumpkin aroma with maybe a bit of coriander underneath. Dark cream colored head settled fast into a thick coat and leaves a bit of stringy lace as the beer level sinks. Transparent chestnut colored beer with an orange hue and masses of fine bubbles shooting to the surface. Light malt and mellow pumpkin in the flavor, maybe a bit of hops in there. Mostly mildy sweet with a pinch of bitterness, and a fairly clean finish. Moderate body with a pretty soft mouthfeel. I'm not a big fan of straight up pumpkin so I would have liked some more hops or spices in there, but not a bad beer."
" I think Coors did a fine job here. I'll bring it in again next year."
"my first sampling of this brew and i was really looking forward to trying it. It pours a warm copper color with minimal head that dissipates quickly. The initial smell hints of a stronger ale with a significant pumpkin overtone. I found the taste to be a little weak and not as full bodied as i would have liked. Unfortunately, I only had one and would have liked to follow it up with numerous others as the drinkability is high. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a light, fall beverage."
"Not a bad beer, but just seems a little uneven to me. Definitely worth a try, and pretty drinkable, but not something in my regular line up."
"Medium copper with a quickly fading light tan head. Aromas of candy sugar dominate the nose. Wouldn't know this was a pumpkin ale unless you told me. Palate is quite boring. No pumpkin or pumpkin pie spice noticable. Light mouthfeel, and with almost no flavor. Boring. I don't see how they can bottle this and call it a pumpkin ale. No character, no flavor, and no need to try this one under any circumstances,"
"I bought this on a whim right before Halloween. It pours an amber/orange color, very fall-like. Head is white, but short lived, as is the lacing. The taste is a bit like Blue Moon's Belgian White with some pumpkin and spices in it, pretty tasty. I could drink a few of these in a session, especially around Haloween, I thought it complimented the pumpkin carving quite well."
"This is the first pumpkin ale I've had and considering that this is made by the 'dreaded' Coors, this beer comes out pretty good. If the others are better I'm in for a treat this fall. It isn't a 'WOW this is the best beer ever' beer but it's pretty good. Definitely worth a try."
"This was the second of three pumpkin beers we tasted this evening in a back-to-back comparison, and the only one that was drinkable. Nothing like our pumpkin beer tasting of last year, where several were very good."
"pours out a slightly hazy orangish/copperish colour...frothy head appears and dies down to thin layer. there is a slight bit of lace too...aroma mostly malty and a bit spicy...i can't really pick up any pumpkin. upon tasting...the overall character of this pumpkin brew appears; light pumpkin...nutmeg...pumpkin pie spice...and maybe a bit of cinnamon and clove. rather pleasant considering this is my first pumpkin brew. some malt backbone...although the overall body is on the medium to light side. finishes slightly spicy and on the refreshing side. not a bad little brew...a sixer every autumn is probably worth it."
"Bender Factor: A solid gas station/grocery beer. I would certainly purchase this over anything else, except Saranac. If one wanted a fall seasonal and didn't care for a strong pumpkin or spice flavor, this would be their brew. Good for a beginner or for a long day of football (and as a Bills fan, there are some really long days ahead)."
"It's a little strange drinking a """pumpkin ale""" from blue moon, as bm to me is synonomous with a belgian white, but I got over it. This one pours with an orange color and a slight head. The taste is slightly bitter ale with some hops, floral overtones, and - of course - pumpkin flavor. Although it goes down smoothly, the bitterness limits one to one or two glasses. Overall a nice beer for a cool fall day."
" This is brewed owned by Coors? I can't believe they could make a beer this nice. It has a nice amber body and a white creamy head. It has a subtle aroma, but it is a terrific aroma of pumpkin spices. The flavor jumps out a lot more in the glass as did the aroma. This is my first pumpkin brew and I think it is pretty good. I will definitely be looking for this beer every fall."
"Pours with a head about 1 cm eggshell in color, consisting of small bubbles. The color is an uninspired amber that has taken the pumpkin to heart with an orange hue. Mild smell, in fact its so mild that it takes a bit of sniffing to get a metallic whiff, which follows through the taste that has notes of aluminum. The mouthful is a bit oily and the after taste is slightly parching. Nonetheless, it is sort of an average, or ordinary beer. Not worth looking for but itll do in a pinch."
"The appearance and aroma really offered a promise of a great beer. However, the taste lacked the complexity of the aroma and just didn't add much to the experience."
"This beer pours an amber body with a thick white head that quickly shrinks. Smell is of sweet caramel with a hint of pumpkin pie spice. Taste is spicy, hoppy with a hint of pumpkin. Body of beer is watery and seems a little too spritzy. Beer is drinkable and a bit different than most beers out there."
"The beer pours an amber color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a light maltiness with a pumpkin aroma that overlays. It has a natural pumpkin scent, not like canned processed pumpkin. It smells like my homebrews. The taste is relatively good. It is smooth with a nice pumpkin flavor that is not overpowering and finishes creamy. It has a decent malt palate of pale and crystal malts. There are hints of nutmeg and other spices; very tastey. The mouthfeel is good also. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good pumpkin seasonal. It has good flavor and drinkability. This is a winner for Coors."
"Pretty much average across the board, pours a nice amber orange with off white head that is nice to the eye, shrinks to respectability. The smell is not really pumpkin but a light nutmeg smell mixed with molasses and caramel, a pine hop presence is detected, the taste has a nice nutmeg beginning and the sweet malts will smack the lips, then the hop will cleanse the palate, not bad but not really a pumpkin ale, more a harvest."
"Since I've been on a pumpkin kick this past week, I was pleasantly surprised when a local Charlotte bar just received some Blue Moon Pumpkin. Compared to Cottonwood and Post Road, I put this brew somewhere right in the middle (with Cottonwood coming out on top). Very drinkable and tasty, it actually has hints of honey, pumpking, and cinnamon, though not too strong. Nice aftertaste and appearance. No real strong scent."
"I have to say I love pumpkin brews grab em when I see em,this one pours a nice copper with a nice two fingered fluffy head but it didnt retain itself to well or leave any lacing.I picked up huge amounts of malt in the aroma but not a big pumpkin nose I got some orange peel mainly with some pumpkin spice notes that come after a while.Taste is decent not over the top on pumpkin but nice and subtle with the spice in the finish has a nice lightly sweet malt profile to it just a light citruisy hop note late wich is very faint.A respectable brew from Coors (thought I would never say that) subtle and quaffable for the fall season."
"An average Fall brew that honestly left me disappointed."
"Drinkable? I suppose if you like this sort of thing, but having just tried the JW Dundees Pale Ale and it was $2 cheaper, try something else for this price and you'll likely be happier."
"Oddly, this is a quaffable beer. Certainly, it is far more flavorful regular lawn mower beers. Unfortunately, it is rather one-dimensional, lacking complexity."
"Maybe it's just me, but I want my beer to taste like... beer. I don't know what the hell this shit was, but it wasn't beer. I got a six pack of it because I had never tried it and I figured a Coors product could only be so bad right? Wrong. It took me and my roommate the better half of a month to kill just four of them. Put the fifth in my collection and gave the last one away to a stripper, who drank about a sip threw it away. If you really, really like pumpkin give it a try, otherwise stick with a real beer."
"Pours with a white two-fingered head, fades quickly, leaves a touch of lace. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied. Color is nice, clear amber. Nose is spice. Starts and finishes sweet and spicy reminds you of a pumpkin pie. Took a chance since the expiration date was coming up but it is fine - a real deal at $1.57 for a 6-pack, expiration date is 2/15."
"I bought a six-pack of this beer at a last-resort package store down the street from me. Sadly, it was the best-looking beer they had available that particular night. At first, I was impressed with the deep amber color and hearty head. Soon after, however, Coors' shoddy attempt at passing off a crap brew as a craft brew became apparent. The head fizzled out, leaving an oily feeling on my tongue, which didn't exactly complement the transparently artificial pumpkin (that is to say, nutmeg and cinnamon) taste."
"Overall a solid pumpkin ale, but I'd like to see some more hop bite."
"($1.16 / 12 oz.)"
"A very nice drinkable seasonal for both fall and winter. It was a decent crossover hit at a Halloween party I went to. Guys and gals alike, while they didn't go crazy over it, all seemed to enjoy the change of pace with this pleasant spice-style beer."
"Poured out a golden-amber-orange with a thin white head. Clear and bright with decent carbonation. The aroma gives off a slight vegetal spiciness with pumpkin, light cloves, nutmeg and sweet malt. The beer is light to medium bodied with a medium sweetness, but finishes dry. On the whole, the beer is somewhat flavorful, but is actually very drinkable. This beer held back, but is decent on its own. A light example of the style, not nearly as bold and flavorful as Dogfish Head or Smuttynose."
"I would not recommend this...not enough pumpkin and spices....not a horrible beer, but there are many better pumpkins out there..."
"This was the blandest of the pumpkin beers I've tried this season. It totally is lacking in flavor. I think if you're going to make a pumpkin beer you should go all out and utilize the familiar pumpkin spices or pumpkin flavor. This one comes across as a conservatively """safe""" tasting beer when compared to others like Buffalo Bill's, New Holland's Ichabod or Lakefront's Pumpkin lager. Not sure if I'd recommend this one at all. Pretty weak interpretation of the style."
"This beer turned out to be the total opposite from what I expected. Poured a golden color with a small head and it didn't leave too much lacing on the glass. The aroma wasn't very strong, but there were noticeable amounts of spices and malts there. The flavor was what surprised me. It was a very clean taste that was smooth on the tongue. I suppose there was a little pumpkin-type spiciness in the flavor, but not as much as I expected. The malts were there in the taste as well as a refreshing hoppiness. The mouthfeel was smooth and it was easy to drink. Maybe just a little too much yeast, but I really enjoyed it. It wasn't as much of a spice/herb beer as I expected, but I still really enjoyed the taste."
"Taste is also milder that I expected. Some pumpkin and spice taste is present, but not enough. Some malt sweetness as well. Beer seems under carbonated so the mouthfeel does suffer a bit. Beer is easy enough to drink, but has a thin stretched quality. I really like pumpkin beers, but this is far from the best of the bunch. I like regular Blue Moon (by far the best product from Coors), so this is more of a disappointment."
"Pours out to an orange-ish/red in the glass with a slight head. Aroma is that of malt with a slight sweetness to it. A bit of vegetal smell is present as well. Taste is that of light caramel with a slight sweetness to it. Not a flavor powerhouse, but it is a nice change of pace. Paired this up with a thyme/rosemary/garlic encrusted pork loin and sweet potatoes which seemed to bring out the taste a bit."
"Not at all impresive. Heavy, flat profile flavor - heavyhanded bittersweetness, like Mr. Beer canned malt. Pumpkin? Nowhere to be found, and not much in the way of spices, either. About the most eloquent description I can give of the beer is """blah.""""
"This one was very average in everything about it. Which I guess is a compliment for the people at Coors. It seemed as if this could have been a quality beer. But it had to be dumbed down for the masses I guess. The flavors were there just too weak for my liking. A letdown because this had the characteristics of a good beer if the flavor were only stronger. Not bad though."
"Light honey color with a big, fat, foamy beige head. Light aroma of malt and nutmeg, and just a teeny bit of pumpkin. Flavor is yeasty at first, some nutmeg. Very chewy. Just a tad of pumpkin flavor. Too little pumpkin, too much nutmeg, too much yeast. Big nutmeg aftertaste. Excellent mouthfeel, but the yeast and the nutmeg are killing me. Had to pour out half the glass."
"Clear, coppery-orange in hue. A slightly off-white head reaches a finger in height, holds well. No lace. The nose does little for me, slightly spicy with hints of malt, largely clean and forgettable. Hmmm this is not what I expected in the taste, clean maltiness with very, very subtle pumpkin pie spice, in the aftertaste pumpkin is noticeable briefly dull hops in the background. This beer doesnt have much flavor working; Id expected much more spice flavor. It left me with a tacky, cheesy mouthfeel. Not good. Medium body. This is more like an Amber Ale with a kiss of pumpkin pie spice. Im glad I didnt buy a six-pack of this stuff because I would struggle to finish it. Unmemorable but Im glad I tried it once."
"This isn't bad for the style but the style is not for me. Not one I'd care to sample again."
"This was a nice pumpkin brew, but I've had better. The thing that stuck out the most in my mind was the overbearing taste of a normal macro beer, clashing with the hint of pumpkin and spices. I wasn't impressed with it, but I'm not gonna dog it. It had a good smell and the apperance was definately the highlight. It was a nice amber golden color, but the head was magnificent. It was oh so thick and last a little while too. I was just supper impressed that something like this could have and retain such a nice head. I would rate it as one of the better heads I have gotten... in a beer."
"Would not buy a case of this beer, but would likely have this beer every couple of years. There are better pumpkin beers out there."
"I didn't have any expectations of this beer. I won't send everyone to the store to buy it. But it is certainly not a beer I would turn down. A nice meat and potatoes dinner would do just fine."
"F"
"Appearance: Copper amber hue with a nice creamy tan head, though short lived leaves some speckled lacing. Aroma: Is very satisfying to me, I get some of the light caramel toasted malts that a very nice this time of year with the change of seasons along with some very precise pumpkin pie spicing not too much doesn't seem like a concentrated artificial scent but is just nice and rather tame. Taste: A flavor that is based upon a bready sweet caramel tone and complemented by a swirling stint of cinnamon and mild pumpkin tones, I have sampled some pumpkin ales that just can't pull this off. Should I say Ein Prosit to Coors, for doing something solid from their brewing empire. Not outstanding but definitely not bad I enjoy this brew. Mouthfeel: Is a bit sticky but it goes down fairly well no overpowering extracts just right carbonation is a little rough making each sip just a bit more cloying than it should be. Drinkability: A definite nice beer to at least try this fall I give it oh, I would say one thumbs up a tasty seasonal from the """Blue Moon""" brewing company, sweet!"
"This beer has a nice glowing amber appearance. A thin but well retained light brown head laces adequately. Aroma of nutmeg, cinamon, pumpkin pulp and toasted malt. And the spices don't over-ride the other aromas. This is a pretty solid pumpkin ale...even coming from Coors. It used to be better, but it's not bad. What I like is that the spices to drown out the pumpkin and malt flavors as happens in other pumpkin beers. This one's got a juicy pumpkin pulp flavor complimented by caramel maltiness. Some subtle spicing includes nutmeg and cinamon. Medium full body. I'm surprised I like this one more than Buffalo Bill's now."
"This is one of the few pumpkin ales I can think of where you can actually taste pumpkin. Most I find are dominated by their spices."
"Tastes very much like pumpkin flavored Killian's. Not bad, but a bit lackluster and dull. The pumpkin is a bit too much for the body, and not nearly enough malt to balance it."
"Pellucid tawny copper. Lanky, but well retained ivory white head leaves muddled lace. Aroma comprised of faint nutmeg and cinnamon layered over sweet caramel and bready malt. Trace banana esters. Smells like dilute pumpkin pie. Tame, but clean. Transient wash of dryish, biscuit like malt upfront in flavor is ensued by balmy lightly caramelized brown sugar sweetness. Understated, generic pie spices surface mid palate manage to overwhelm the vapidly bready, overly neutral base malt undertone. Soft hop bitterness, with a nearly complete dearth of hop flavor, only a token hint of earthiness is discerned. Thinnish body with an odd, oily viscosity in mouthfeel. Finishes dry and approaching bland, with an unexpected tinge of alcohol warmth. An innocuous, softly spiced brew two notches beyond bland. It's akin to a prosaic, caramel malt driven amber ale with a pinch of pie spice added directly to the glass. Quaffable, but forgettable."
" It is nice and crisp, but a little light on flavor. Pumpkin is very subtle, and the spices are too. I can deal with the pumpkin being toned down, but the delicious fall spices usually in these brews were really missed. I may never fully appreciate a pumpkin ale, but this one definitely does not stand up to Punkin by Dogfish head."
"Clear and bright amber-orange color with a lively yellowish 1/2 inch head to start but down quite a bit in a minute. Slight looping laces. A little funk in the aroma, some wet sweat socks and a bit of citrus. Low carbonation, very consistant front to back and stolid malt on the palatte. Slight spice (more nutmeg in this one) punctuated by a noticeable bitter late toward the swallow. Pretty unidimensional beer and absolutely unremarkable. But other than the aroma, nothing is really wrong either. Slightly below average as a pumpkin brew overall but drinkable enough."
"I enjoyed this beer, but it just as well should remain a seasonal because this isn't something that I would stock my fridge with at all times. It kind of has a novelty effect to it, but overall the flavor isn't overbearing and is reasonably drinkable."
"Not bad. Done well. Not any pumpkin flavor to speak of, just the spices."
"Pours a burnt-orange, reddish color. The head is a puffy effervescent blanket of white foam. Unfortunately, it doesn't last long at all. Smell is of pumpkin pie spices, with not nearly the pumpkin aroma of similar beers. The pumpkin does shine through in the taste...it stays subtally, but firmly, behind a nice malt sweetness. Slight bitter finish. It's really a very nice, very drinkable beer."
"This pours with a quick cream colored head that settles over crystal clear amber/orange liquid with hints of gold. The nose is lightly malty with abundant pumpkin pie spice, though not too heavy. The taste gives notes of fruity pumpkin, sweet maltiness with medium mouthfeel and a lingering floral hoppiness. Finishes nicely balanced between the sweet and the bitter. It's possible to drink many glasses of this brew...which I just might!"
"This poured a deep orange/amber color with a small fizzling off-white head that dissapated quickly. The aroma was pleasantly malty with a hint of pumpkin and other spices. I liked this compared to some of the other pumpkin ales that overdo their flavoring and turn an ale into a pumpkin flavored beverage. The flavor was also very good, it seems to combine an octoberfest malty sweetness with a seasonal twist, featuring only a hint of pumpkin that lingers on the middle of the tongue. Finished with a crisp aftertaste that was also mostly of malt, but had a twinge of spice also. While it was a little bland overall, I was satisfied with this brew, although I still favor Post Road's Pumpkin Ale to all others."
"Notes: Not bad, but still a letdown. Give it a shot, if for nothing else but comparison to the better fall seasonals."
"I am a big fan of pumpkin spice beer in the fall. I was expecting more pumpkin spice and do not feel it delivered. I just did not really care for it at all."
"This one is weird, it tastes like pumpkin pie, but not sweet so much like the malternatives.  Spicey clove feel. Slimey mouthfeel.  Not unpleasant.  But I prefer normal beer."
