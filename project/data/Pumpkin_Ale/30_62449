The malt foundations gets overpowered by the sweetness already during the very beginning, joined by a sharp alcoholic impact, and only manages to try finding its balance during a later stage, due to the calming herbs and spices, which all in all aren't capable to stop the sugar madness too. The rum barrel is very well integrated though, providing a burning, slightly bitter counterpart to the sugar, which would result into a slightly dry, medicine-like impression, if it wasn't for the muddy, leafy herbs of mace, cardamon and vanilla, to provide some sort of balance. FInishes with caramelized malts among molasses and an confirming booziness, leaving enough space on the palate for the actual pumpkin to fit in, supported by wooden herbs.","aleigator","Jan 13, 2015"

There's very minimal alcohol heat, and the rum is quite muted (except for the degree to which it contributes to the, again, extraordinary sweetness). As it warms, a bit of complexity begins to emerge, most notably in the form of an almost bacon-y aftertaste (which is a good thing).

4.1,0.5,4,4,4.25,4,4,"Batch No. 3, bottled Sept 6, 2013. Poured into a snifter, the beer is a hazy, muddled, opaque, amber-brown coloring, with no head whatsoever. Aromas of booze, pumpkin sweetness, brown sugar, woody notes, tangy caramel, and a subtle spice blend of cinnamon and nutmeg. Flavors are very layered, with a rich pumpkin bread characteristic of sweet pumpkin, cinnamon, and nutmeg, leading the way, followed by an immediate blast of booze, both in strength and warmth. Woody and vanilla notes come through in highlights, as well as some brown sugar and heavy molasses characteristics. This thing is a beast. Slick, oily, robust bodied, with a huge warming factor as you drink. The aftertaste is surprisingly light on booze, and more of a sit down and chat with the pumpkin and spice blend. Very pleasant surprise. The finish is slick, quick, and surprisingly clean, with only the slightest candi sugar linger. Great beer!","GarthDanielson","Nov 12, 2014"

Definitely some alcohol warmth, but surprisingly not boozy.  As this warms up its gets way too sweet and cloying to point of being unpleasant.  Mouthfeel is sticky, full ,and cloying towards the finish.  Overall, its good, especially at first, but  way too sweet towards the end.  Plenty of rum flavor and sweet candy sugar, but it becomes too much and even at 8 oz it was hard to finish.  I'd have it again, but I'd prefer an even smaller portion.

Smells incredible, spiced rum, spices, caramel, malt. Tastes-Whoa! The high ABV is not hidden at all but still has amazing flavors. Pumpkin? Pretty subtle. Spiced rum dominates. Finishes hot.

Pours a slightly cloudy dark orange without much head. Aroma of spiced rum, pumpkins, a little cinnamon and nutmeg. Flavor is sweet caramel and light butterscotch, a little pumpkin fruit, light cinnamon and nutmeg spice, brown sugar, a bit of marshmallow cream. The sweetness is very nice here. Alcohol warmth is like whoah, as expected. Sweet, not quite syrupy mouthfeel with medium to low carbonation. Overall I like this a lot, and it is a huge improvement over the disappointment that was Good Gourd Almighty that we had right before this one.","BMMillsy","Dec 08, 2013"

This is the biggest pumpkin beer I've ever come across, and one of the most unique. I look forward to its release every year. Makes for a nice, slow dessert sipper.","ryan1788a5","Dec 07, 2013"

It is also pretty amazing just how much pumpkin and spice cuts through the booze and rum. Artfully done and like nothing else on the market. The taste is a bit muddled and maybe a bit overly sweet but with that being said I would not hesitate to pick another up for a special occasion like Thanksgiving dinner!

The head was minimal and quickly vanished after the pour. The aroma is of dark rum and perhaps dark malt with a bit of caramel. The mouthfeel is thick,chewy,and warm with alcohol. I get dark rum on the front of the palate. I get some sweetness and body from the pumpkin. I also get some definite warming in my throat from the alcohol.

Big pumpkin aroma and flavor. Some molasses. Spicy alcohol. Little hop profile. Then it immediately became a Dogfish 120. Not quite a Mephistopheles but almost a Samael. Dusty profile. Huge alcohol taste. One dimensional. Just heavy booze. Then it hit me. The complexities in this brew are buried beneath the dominate alcohol. So subtle but very real. Just like I Heart Huckabees, this beer is real life. Great at first, redundant inbetween, and a real eye opener in the end. Oh and it is crimson in color.

Poured into a snifter, stuck my nose into it, and was punched in the face with rum notes, nutmeg, and pumpkin. Pours with a slight head and quickly disipates to a clear, dark redish/orange color brew. Very smooth and sweet and the first sip left behind a nice burn in my chest almost as if I took a shot of whiskey. The most overwhelming notes on the palate to me is the rum and molasses sweetness. This is a very refreshing change from the super bready big pumpkin beers on the market like the Pumpking from Southern Tier... Though no where near the ABV of this. Aside from this being a little to much on the sweet side, I wish I was able to get more and set aside until next year because I would love to see how this would do with a year or two of aging.

The difference between this and the standard seasonal offering is kind of like the difference between a Toyota Camry and a fire-breathing, gas-guzzling, nitroused funny car. This does, of course, mean that anyone not already familiar with some of the more extreme possibilities of barrel aging should likely be very wary of this brew, and anyone who finds the alcohol kick of straight bourbon or rum should also stay away. But if you are a fan, and you’re ready to spend several hours nursing this sucker (because there’s no way you’re going to shoot this in ten minutes), it’s definitely an amazing offering.","jondeelee","Nov 11, 2012"

There is something slightly vegetal smelling and almost none of the alcohol bite can be detected in the nose.

The taste follows pretty closely, with the rum getting all up-close-and-personal with my tastebuds. The spices and vanilla bean are strong as well. There's pretty much no trace of any pumpkin, save the residual spices that get lost in the pre-existing spice forest in the rum. And, once again, the booze is more than present.

I happen to be fairly particular about my pumpkin ales and I was very curious when I came across this one in the local grocery store for a winter seasonal. First off, very little head and carbonation which really leaves the mouthfeel to the weight of the brew itself. Soft, and a little flat. A little heavy, and naturally so at 15%. It is a very interesting combination, I just felt like the ABV weighed it down. Aging in old rum barrels was a clever combo. I wonder if this might be better with a bourbon barrel. Nevertheless, the pumpkin was drowned out. I got a little bit, but I most tasted some spice and brewing sugar. Not a bad beer, imaginative pumpkin ale, probably best for when you are in an exploratory mood.","JDRourke","Dec 15, 2011"

Rum, dark fruits like currants, trifle cake, brown sugar. The rum is unmistakable and overwhelming. Taste- WOW. a sweet blast of rum soaked cake to the front of the tongue. Brown sugar, candied dark fruit carries forward second. some nice bitterness evens out the sweet flavors on the back of the throat. This is boozy as hell, but it all works well together. What it does not remind me of at all is pumpkin. I really get more heavy rum, dark fruit, spices, and sweet candied sugar.

Brown sugar, vanilla, and spice hit first, but there is a nice overall pumpkin presence. Smells like pumpkin pie. Alcohol is definitely noticeable on the nose, but not offensive. The taste is exactly like the smell. The first thing I noticed was insane amounts of carbonation on my tongue. Starts out syrupy sweet, but the spices come in to help balance it out. It finishes with a semi-dry fresh pumpkin taste. Mouthfeel is somewhat thick, but the carbonation is very high. Overall, the most unique and intense pumpkin ale I have had to date. If there were such thing as a Double/Imperial Pumpkin Ale, this would fit the bill. There are definitely some flaws to the beer. The carbonation is just too much. There is also a definite burn from the alcohol. I know 15.9% abv is high, but Avery could have masked the alcohol taste more.

Poured a clear dark orange amber with a small lingering amber head. On the nose, I got rum, pumpkin pie, cinnamon and cloves. On the palate, medium-bodied, very sweet, with lots of rum, dark brown sugar and molasses. Not a whole lot of pumpkin (or pumpkin pie) flavor going on, which is good; the rum barrels balance nicely against the pumpkin pie spicing, and although they stand out, they do so in a good way. The rum barrels work much better here than they did with Black Tot.","emmasdad","Oct 19, 2011"
4.59,12.5,4,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours an amber/orange color. Very little carbonation or lacing on the glass. Somewhat transparent in appearance. A very small cocoa head that actually sticks around for awhile. Great looking beer. Wow. This is amazing- the nose is cinnamon, a tiny bit of pumpkin, nutmeg, rum, oak, and molasses. Really complex and fantastic smells coming from this beer! The taste really brings the spices out- though not overwhelmingly so. Rum definitely makes it's presence known too. The taste is almost port like. Very complex flavors- and the 15.9% ABV is fairly well hidden too. Feel is smooth, silky, and rich- with a little alcohol burn on the end- Fantastic! Overall, this is the best pumpkin beer I've had by a landslide- although you don't get a lot of pumpkin. It's great though, and I'm glad I got to try this brew. Highly Recommended.","jayhawk73","Oct 19, 2011"
3.89,-4.7,3.5,4.5,3.5,4,4,"On tap at ChurchKey in DC. Poured into a snifter glass. Pours dark reddish brown with thin head and lacing that lasts throughout. Aromas full of toffee, caramel, cinnamon, clove, slight ginger, big notes of brown sugar, molasses, some nice spiced rum, nice sweet pumpkin notes on there as well, really big and full. Taste is just as good and the alcohol is pretty much completely hidden, starts with notes of sweet vanilla, brown sugar, toffee, and molasses, some nice cinnamon, clove, ginger, leading into a perfect blend of sweet pumpkin, rum, and a slight hint of warmth, balanced with a cinnamon, clove and ginger spice combo going into a nice dry, slightly bitter finish. Carbed well enough to carry the taste through the palate, nice full on the palate as well to have a nice lasting finish. What an interesting rum-infused pumpkin ale!","CuriousMonk","Oct 19, 2011"
4.88,19.6,5,4.5,5,5,5,"The Rumpkin is an intense experience. I've only had it at the tap room, however its taste is hard to forget. It has anything-but-subtle pumpkin and rum flavors, as well as a strong alcoholic smell. It's a very attractive dark orange with a thin head.","alexipa","Oct 07, 2011"
4.03,-1.2,4.5,4,4,4,4,"orange tinted amber with a little bit of a haze to it and ample carbonation. A nice three finger head of white lace appeared on top and gradually faded down into just a film across the top. The aroma was very big, full of spices, lots of cinnamon and nutmeg were readily noticeable. The taste followed along the same line. A very spicy little ale with just the right amount of hotness to it. The cinnamon was particularly strong and had a great effect on the flavor. Very nice light body and ample carbonation made it go down very easily.","mikesgroove","Aug 31, 2011"
4.5,10.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"The Farmhouse had this brew on tap last fall and after seeing it on their website I had to go try it. The beer poured out as a nice copperish orange color. The head didn't last very long and didn't leave a lacing. The smell of the beer was spicy and boozy. The taste of the beer had a semi-sweet at first, then the spices kick in and the alcohol warmth finishes off the taste. The flavor is very strong, and I really liked the rum barrel aging. The mouthfeel is on the heavier side but it's got a good carbonation to it. Overall this is a really good beer to sip on a cooler autumn night. Enjoyable!","Knapp85","Jun 16, 2011"
4.47,9.6,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Enjoyed this on tap tonight as part of a Colorado Beer Week special tapping at Falling Rock. Reviewed from notes and a 15 minute old memory. The beer is a rich copper color, with small bubbles but no head to speak of. Aromas of spice, specifically cinnamon and clove. Rich mid-palate vanilla, with a butterscotch finish and a sharp but pleasant alcohol bite. This is a sipper, and an excellent one. If they ever decide to bottle this (and I hope they do), it'd be my go to snow day beer.","JCDenver","Apr 08, 2011"
4.09,0.2,3.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Pours a dark orange with a creamy head. Smells and tastes of pumpkin, rum and brown sugar, with a good amount of spices. The rum really enhances the pumpkin, this tastes like the best pumpkin pie or casserole you've ever had. Very sweet, with a nice mouthfeel and moderate carbonation. As a pumpkin beer fan I was really looking forward to this, and I wasn't disappointed. Avery needs to bottle this!","jsanford","Mar 15, 2011"
3.75,-8.1,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Rumpkin comes in the tulip looking hazyish orange that is semi bright up to light. A small cap of off white foam graces the top of this one, no stick. Smell is str8 rum barrel mixed in with pumpkin spices. Some small amounts of chocolate and some brown sugar. Some alcohol as well. For 13 percent or so pretty well tamed. Taste is pumpkin spice, not so much pumpkin pie flavor. Rum is well stated comes on strong and resembles a spirit in some fashion. Some small cocco, molasses, booze soaked apples and the like. The alcohol is well hidden but feel comes off like a spirit of sorts. Coating, medium bodied, a light carb. A interesting beer, not one i'll be reaching the ends of the earth for, small pours of this are encouraged, would love to have this near the holidays with family.","BARFLYB","Feb 27, 2011"

3.07,-24.8,3.5,4,3,2,2.5,"The taste goes quite a ways downhill as the intricate rum characteristics are overlaid with all too much booze. Just really, really heavy on the alcohol here. There is some spicing there as well. The feel takes it even lower, as there is nothing there but booze. Pretty heavy body. Drinkability isn't all that high given the excessive booze. It's a shame that the booze took this one over. I wish this were in bottles so I could lay one down for a year to see what happens.","Thorpe429","Dec 08, 2010"
3.65,-10.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours clear dark ruby color, not much head at pour. Aroma smells spicey, clovey, cinnamon, faint pumpkin. Alcohol seems to be a big factor in aroma as well. Alcohol from rum is definitely the biggest factor in flavor, especially when the beer is colder. Still clovey cinnamon spice in flavor but not very well in balance with rum. Pumpkin takes a while to find, becomes slightly more evident in flavor as beer warms. Mouthfeel is relatively thick. Finish has an mild alcohol burn. Sweetness is a little on the heavy side, and lingers on finish. Was hoping for a litte more pumpkn and for rum to be a little more balanced with the rest of the flavors. Glad I could say I got to try it though.","despainmakesbeer","Dec 05, 2010"
