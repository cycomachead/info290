"Meh. Not great.  Not terrible. I wish I had positive things to say about ANY pumpkin ale."
"Overall:  This is another good pumpkin beer.  Good balance between malt, pumpkin, spices, sweetness and hops.  I’d certainly get it again."

"O - Punk'n is not a horrible beer, but just doesn't measure up as a pumpkin ale.  Boring."

"Its long trail of sweetness and spice are never intent on relinquishing the palate as the ale has no real transcendence toward finish- lingering on in dessert-like finish. Warm with both spice and alcohol, neither hinder the ale's supreme drinkability."

"The low-point for this beer is its very diluted pumpkin flavor. You're left with more of a sugary, soft drink like taste. It's not unpleasant per se, but really doesn't deliver much of a wow factor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours light-copper, but doesn't give off too much aroma.  The pumpkin spice Uinta uses isn't sweet like the usual pumpkin beers that use the pumpkin pie spice.  It is a balanced beer, though; however, I would have expected much more out of a Uinta brew.  Probably not worth another try."

"Rich pumpkin pie spices thick creamy head"
""
""
"O - Looks like I like this better than most reviewers.  Not the greatest pumpkin beer but considering the lowish ABV, good flavor and feel; I'd have it again."

"I should point out that I enjoy a good pumpkin ale in the fall and look forward to sampling new ones. This is far from the worst pumpkin I've had."
""
""
""
""
""

"Pours a deep pumpkin color. The color actual looks more like real pumpkin was used than most other pumkin beers. Aroma is light, pumpkin, whipped cream, sweetness and a hint of pumpkin pie spices. Taste is very very light and actually pleasant. It is a little too light and some of the pumpkin flavor is lost, but it is a nice change from the overspiced other seasonal ales. Mouthfeel is nice and not bitter, just overall, a very light punk'n ale !!"
"Similar to DFH Punkin but not as balanced. Heavier on the spice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: this is an interesting beer.  I feel like the pumpkin is very natural and not overdone, but I also feel like it's not very polished.  Worth a try if you're a huge fan of pumpkin beers, but otherwise it's merely an OK quaff."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Ho Hum,  Good pumpkin but not great."
""
""
""
""
""

"Poured from a 12oz can into a shaker pint glass. Aggressive pour yielded a good inch high thick head. Clear, orange/gold color- nice looking beer. Aroma is pretty weak with some light pumpkin aroma and a bit of spice. Taste is likewise pretty weak, with a slight taste of pumpkin pie filling and a bit of tartness. Very little malty sweetness and no hoppiness. Mouthfeel was pretty thin. Overall, not the greatest verion of a pumpkin ale out there, probably won't be buying this one again."

"Punk'n is an exceptionally light and not particularly special pumpkin beer.  It does seems to nail the style as it delivers a gourd or yam malt, starchy and dry. It ends with a bit of cinnamon, nutmeg and all spice. I don't find this offensive by any measure just not bold enough to expect another glance."
""
""
"There are much better Pumpkin Ales out there."
""
""
"Pretty nice.. maybe a lower ABV is the solution for so many shitty pumpkin brews out there???? Just sayin'... But I am right."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I would argue that Punk'n is a less well rounded version of DFH's Punkin. The roasted/charred pumpkin note is a bit off balanced."
"About standard for a pumpkin beer."
""
"Overall - I was pretty interested after the appearance and smell, but the taste was a real let down here. I'm a little surprised, as I've had much better offerings from Uinta. This truly makes me think of something that may have been a better pumkin ale that was watered down with a significant amount of club soda, much like I believe another reviewer said. I can't recommend this, and I won't try it again - there are much better pumkin beers out there."

"2.89/5: Not Uinta's best showing"
""
"First impression is that this is a little flat.  The flavor matches the nose."
""

""

""

"I'm impressed with this offering of a season of pumpkin brew. I poured into a pint glass and was happy to see an impressive head, with distinct lacing that lasted throughout my entire session. Colour was pure and deep, essembling whiskey in the glass. Nose was subdued, but with subtle spice and lots of roasty pumpkin. The taste is surprisingly dry! Not sweet at all. A nice twist for a genre: a bruise that are often overly sweet and overly spiced. This one is all pumpkin, with a more subtle spice profile than many competitors. It's a bit one dimensional, slightly flat, but with such a nice head and with such a reserved interpretation on pumpkin beer, this is one to try again and a beer to recommend for those who are not fans of the over-the-top examples of this style."

"I'm a little disappointed and it's difficult not to show that in this review. It's hoppy, with a smell like pumpkins, but comes off like an amber with almost zero remarkable qualities. Hooray."

"Nice pour, dry pumpkin finish. Could be spicier."
""
"Overall (3.09) : I don't quite know what to think of this brew. I think I'd lean more towards the """hate""" category, but it's not entirely terrible. I'd say it's a notch above Shock Top's offering which isn't saying much. The taste is mawkish in every sense of the word, until you get to the end where you taste fresh pumpkin pie. I don't think the first part is worth agonizing through just for a pleasant three second aftertaste. It's actually giving me a little heartburn too. Ah, I wouldn't drink this again."

"Really surprised by the low ratings when I went to review this. Hazy, amber in color with a one-finger white head. Good retention. Pleasant pumpkin pie spice aroma. Lots of carbonation and dry but light mouthfeel. I had more than one pint and enjoyed it. Would definitely get it again."

"Copper toned beer, no lacing or remnants of head after pour. Aroma is roasted pumpkin with more vanilla than any other spice. Mouth feel is medium with a taste as you would expect from the aroma . Good beer with the right amount of pumpkin and spice flavors as well as a nice roasted or smokey complement from the roasted pumpkins."
""
""
"Overall, it's very good at being what it's supposed to be, and I can appreciate that. However, I will admit I am also a fan of the bolder pumpkin ales, and I find Punk'n to be a perfect mixer to smooth out the likes of Pumking, Weyerbacher Imperial, Kentucky Pumpkin Barrel, etc. Either way, for the price, there's nothing to complain about here."

"I like that there’s actual pumpkin in here and not just a spice bomb andI really like the restraint Uinta exercised.  It’s one of the few pumpkin beers I’d have more than one of in a sitting."
""
""
""
""
""
"The label says Pumpkin Ale but I think this should be renamed as a """Spiced Fall Ale.""" Drinking this makes me feel like I should be outside on an overcast low 50 degree day among wind blow'n leaves. The color is a rich amber with slow dissipating head white head. Mouthfeel is moderate. Faint notes of pumpkin but more essence of general spices."
""
""
"I had this a few years back and thought it was pretty weak, but decided to pick it up again after seeing they've at least changed the recipe a little bit and brought it to a 5% abv per the info on their website. Looks the part of a pumpkin; orangy-red and maybe a slight haze, actually poured a pretty good head that lasted, well, not very long, but it was there. The nose smells of typical pumpkin-y spices like cloves, cinnamon and nutmeg. Tastes about the same, but this one does have a very slight but noticeable pumpkin flavor to it - I find a lot of others you just get spice and some unidentifiable funkiness to it which I presume is gourd, but here it's recognizable. The best way I can describe it is it tastes like the smell of when a candle starts to cook the lid of a jack o' lantern. The mouthfeel is also quite nice, silky and a little tart on the back end. I think the mouthfeel puts it above the average category and I do also like the fact that you can taste some real pumpkin in here. I've been trying more and more Uinta stuff and have been impressed by many of their offerings. I would easily pick this up again in between some of the bigger pumpkin ales."

"Pours like a standard pumpkin ale, possibly a little darker. The aroma and flavor carries a sort of vegetative quality (probably from the pumpkin flesh addition) along with a mineral/carbonic character that I found to be distracting. The spice addition was quite restrained and leaned toward more herbal/bitter instead of malty and sweet."

"Uinta Punk'n ---3.5/5"
""
""
"A lot of pumpkin and spice in the aroma, with some malt sweetness to back it up, but no hop presence or bitterness at all. The flavor starts with the pumpkin, but has a bit stronger of a malt presence, with bready malt character coming through. There is a bit of a bitterness in the flavor, but you really need to search for it. Not bad, but a touch too sweet for my taste"
"O: If you like the style, I recommend it. It's a very good beer to me, but I'm a fan of the style, especially when the flavor of pumpkin and spices are well represented. Also, the toasty malty notes make a great addition."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I love pumpkin ales, as I've graded over 30, but the ketchup aroma and flavor just didn't do it for me"
""
"Good mouthfeel, but lacks a balanced spice flavor, and the beer lack some malt character. Pumpkin, as with most pumpkin ales, does not come through well. Kept a good head in a shaker pint, and was fairly clear (slightly cloudy). Cinnamon flavor is a clear, and is overall a solid ale. It lacks a balance between being a pumpkin ale and being a great ale."
""
""
"Pretty decent pumpkin beer, it has to be said. The flavor is unmistakably that of pumpkin, and there is a good bit of cinnamon and spice to it. Nothing memorable, but it does the trick."
"Draught @ Headkeeper: This one pours a clear, orange tinged amber color. There was a wisp of an off-white head on it. Lighter but nice aroma. Some pumpkin pie spices and a hint of pumpkin. The taste is good. Some pumpkin pie spices, some pumpkin and some malt sweetness. Fairly nice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
" The flavor has some green hops with mild herbal flavor and gentle malt taste upfront which leads to a spiced and caramel sweetness in the middle. The malt gives a dry nutty toasted grain foundation to the mild alcohol and light spice in the semi-dry finish. Overall I found this to be a tasty lower abv pumpkin with nice subdued spicing nad a good foundation of malt I would drink this again"
""
""
""
""
"O - I obviously enjoyed this beer more than others. I felt it was a great fall pumpkin beer. The pumpkin and pumpkin pie spices are present but dont rule the beer. Its easy to drink and has a pleasant aroma. I will look for this one again"
""
""
""
"Punk'n Is on par with Long Trail and 3rd on my list. Other middle of the pack treats include UFO, Tommyknocker, Ichabod, and Southampton. Stay away from Smuttynose which tastes like potpourri. I am not a fan of Samuel Adams or Blue Moon either. If you like hard cider, Woodchuck has a nice, smooth, mild pumpkin flavor. Maple Mistress is supposed to be an Imperial Pumpkin ale but tastes like an Imperial Maple Ale."
""
""
""
"This beer pours a caramel tan color. There’s pumpkin spice on the aroma with a heavy handed clove and allspice. It tastes slightly bitter with a touch of roast. The clove and allspice dominates the flavor. Dry finish. Not a bad sipper. It is what it is."
""
"I actually like this beer quite a bit. It doesn't claim to be anything it's not. It's a sessionable ale with pumpkin added. Descent flavor and well balanced."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"I poured this beer it has a burnt orange color body with a thick head that hangs out for a while. The smell is faint of spices. The taste is the same way faintnof spices execpt of clove. I don't get any pumpkin flavor. Mouthfeel is flat and overall not that good."
""
""
""

"I went with an aggro pour as there had better not be any lees to get stirred up. The result was two thick fingers of tawny head that slowly fell like an aging heavyweight who just got tagged on the chin by an up and coming opponent. What remained was soft and creamy, like soft serve ice cream. Nose was maltier than the other two offerings this evening, making for a nice change of pace. Color was a deep-copper (SRM = > 17, < 22) with NE-quality clarity. Mouthfeel was medium and this one struck a nice balance between the """organic pumpkin", the """organic spices""" and the """barley malt", giving it a light spiciness, but not overwhelming the malty sweetness that acted as the beer's backbone. I get it. I am an American and we like things that are overamped, but this was a striking contrast to the spice rack receptacles from earlier in the evening. With them, one each was plenty. In this one, the finish was pleasantly semi-dry and not harsh in terms of its inherent spiciness. I would not want a full day of it, but at least I felt like I could drink more than just one. I may lay in a couple/few more for the upcoming holidays."
""
""
"O- Typically when I think about pumpkin beers, I usually lean towards thoughts of halloween. Many of the bottles have images of Jack o' lanterns, owls, headless horsemen, and other ghoulish figures associated with Halloween. This beer just screams """harvest""" more than anything. Like I said, it seems """traditional""" in a way. Even the bottle art is plain and simple. Try this if you get a chance. If anything it is very different. It is like a whole pumpkin in a glass!"
""
"Overall: A nice and light alternative to pumpkin beers, but still sweet though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a deep bronze color, little lacing is left on the glass. Aroma of pumpkin, caramel and spice. In the taste, mostly malt and pumpkin. A bit more hop influence than many examples of the style, with a hop/spice bite. Nutmeg, all spice and coriander dial in the holiday spices, but faint which makes for an easier drinking beverage. Nice malt and pumpkin flavor. Overall, a solid pumpkin ale."

"A decent pumpkin ale but, there is nothing really special going on here."
""
"Overall, the beer would be much more enjoyable without the canned vegetable aspect, as this beer distracts the senses and seems out of place. Okay but not a favorite."
"The taste had some biscuit character with squash or yam-like notes but nothing that jumped out at me. Kind of bland actually."
""
""
"O: A bit of a bland pumpkin beer. Not enough spice or malt sweetness to give it an edge or what's needed in the flavor department. Fairly expected for a 4% brew. Given that, it's a nice easy drinker that's good for the transition to colder weather"
""
""

"A decent pumpkin ale, nothing special but not bad and has decent flavor and body considering the abv."

"Poured into an oversized wine glass. Color was a dark orangey amber, with a thin 1/4""" foamy off white head. Aroma was slightly spicy up front, a bit of cinnamony pepper. A bit on the simple aroma side. Flavor was similar. A bit of sweet up front, very faint, but then shfited to a bitter pepper. Not at all what I would expect from a pumpkin beer. Not necessarily bad, but not really what I would see for a pumpkin. Coated well, not overly thick. A bit of tingle on the tongue, in a good way. Overall a bit strange for a pumpkin, not at all like what I would normally expect."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm a huge pumpkin ale fan, I typically like Unita's offerings very much, but this one let me down. It lacks that classic pumpkin ale flavor to me. It is devoid of any of the classic spices/flavors that make this style so appealing to me. They may have been going for a more subtle approach, don't know, but overall this has been a HUGE dissapointment for me. I would not buy again."
""
""
""
"Fairly disappointing overall. Definitely would not buy this again, unless someone told worked hard to convince me I got a really bad batch."
""
""
""
""
"O: more pumpkin focus than others, spice is more tamed, more nutty flavors"
""
""
""
"Overall - Great pumpkin brew I’m enjoying it and would def pick up another sixer if looking to purchase the style"
""
"O- This is a really solid pumpkin ale with the nice pumpkin spices you expect and a nice bready and caramel malt base."
""
""
"Uinita Punk'n pours a stoic tawny color with a slight haze to it. There's somewhat vigorous carbonation going on, and the beverage has got a quarter-inch sticky, frothy cream head. With a good whiff I can definitely state that I detect actual, natural pumpkin here. Like the inside of a real raw pumpkin. Authentic! Also, taking a back seat, the slew of usual spices such as cinnamon and nutmeg. The flavor is quite close to the aroma, and in this case, it's a beautiful thing. This is a clean tasting real pumpkin beer. Not too over the top and also it still tastes like a beer, with light hops and biscuity malt identifiable in the taste. This tastes remarkably full and coats the mouth great for only a 4% alcohol beer. The flavor lingers nicely in the finish as well. I would buy this again, which is a phrase not thrown around lightly with pumpkin ales, unfortunately."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Appearance its great, but smell was the first drop and the taste didn't help. If those had anchored this beer, then the mouthfeel would have only help but all in all this is below mediocre."
""
""
"Overall - Enjoyed this beer with Bison Meatloaf and Broccoli which seemed a good fit. Very enjoyable beer and would drink again without hesitation."
"Overall I'm a fan of this beer. A little different than the other pumpkin beers on the market but still is true to pumpkin pie roots. Give it a go."
""
"Raul does not recommend."

"Picking up a lot of similarity to Dogfish Head Punkn Ale. Overall, a very drinkable pumpkin beer. Mouthfeel is a lot heavier than the 4.00% ABV leads you to believe. I have no regrets picking this one up. Good job Uinta, haven't had a bad one from you yet!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a very nice pumpkin ale and one that is almost sessionable which can't be said about most beers in the style. I need to pick this one up again."

""
"Pours a lighter orange color without a head on it. Nose consists of sweet graham cracker like malts with lots of gourd and pumpkin in the mix as well. Taste starts off with sweet caramel and cookie malt that moves on to a weird old hoppy bitterness. Starts off nicely but things don't end so well. Mouth is medium and smooth. Overall, this is decent...the bitterness is off-putting; if you are going for a pumpkin beer from this brewery, I would recommend the oak jacked imperial over this one."
""
""
"Picked this up to try a pumpkin beer. Smell upon opening and first taste had a hint of pumpkin. Very mellow, smooth beer, but not much different than a regular beer. Seems to have just a hint of pumpkin to it. Did taste the slight tartness noted in other reviews, but it wasn't too much different than the first half of the beer."
""
"Pours a clear orange-amber with a rich, tan head that dissipates very quickly. Aromas of roasted malt underlie nutmeg, pumpkin, and cinnamon. Remarkable how much this smells like pumpkin pie. Medium-bodied mouthfeel with some light carbonation. I'm not sure these flavors work. I detect a little creamy pumpkin, but not as overtly as it presents in the nose. It has a little tartness and bitterness at the finish. Perhaps these flavors are meant to mimic raw pumpkin. Not my favorite."
""
""
""
""
"O: This was a very decent Pumpkin Ale. Is it as good as 'Night Owl' (from Elysian?)...No, but still pretty good. Chasin' Cheers :~)"
""
""
"O: One of the better pumpkin beers I've had. Not hugely balanced, but neither is an IPA right? Tasty throughout but only if you like pumpkin. I love it!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It had a good head and even better head retention."
"O: Overall a very solid drinkable brew. the taste in on point. My only negative would be the ABV. I would like 5% at the least. This is the downfall of this beer. 4% ABV ??? Come on now were not drinking Keystone."
"Overall: An enjoyable bready pumpkin beer, nothing mind blowing but above average. I would get this again and could probably do four in a sitting"
"O - Uinta's Punk'n Harvest Pumpkin Ale does a great job of incorporating pumpkin and spice flavors into this nice malty base beer without getting too carried away. It remains earthy and tied to the season with it's characteristics but mild enough to entice someone unsure of a """pumpkin beer""" while also maintaining enough pumpkin and spice to keep pumpkin beer veterans coming back for another without the complaint it's too thin or watered down. Nice across the board, this is a good entry into the pumpkin ale season!"
""
""
"Thanks jfan??"
""
"Got a small glass of this at a tasting, probably would have never bought it. Amber color, decent head. Aroma is thick pumpkin purée like you just opened a can of it. Flavor was pumpkin and spice but also dominated by this stale maltiness that reminds me of dog food, specifically the purina factory, yuck."
""
""
"Overall, a decent pumpkin beer. It's a bit mellow, but the spicing is well done."
"O: Enjoyable but a very different take on a pumpkin ale - the smell is very similar to other pumpkin beers but the taste is unique with the earthiness. Definitely an interesting take on the style."
"Overall, not too bad, but its definitely not the right choice for someone looking for a more full bodied beer. There was a slight bitterness which was nice, but left more to be desired."
""
""
""
"Overall an OK pumpkin ale but not a standout."
"C-"
""
""
"This is probably the most balanced pumpkin ale I've had to date. The pumpkin is forward and foremost in the flavor with the spices taking a balanced, supporting role. This is delicious and incredibly drinkable. It's definitely worth checking out."
"This beer tastes a bit better than it smells, but not much. Medium bodied with a very earthy, vegetal pumpkin flavor that's countered by earthy hops and zesty spice. Subtle sweetness but reminds me more of squash/harvest flavors without any of the pumpkin puree/pie sweetness that I prefer in the style. There's some earthy hop bitterness along with some nutmeg, cinnamon, brown sugar and clove but something is just off with this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer was quite unlike any other pumpkin beers that I’ve had before as it was neither dominated by the typical pumpkin pike spices (such as cinnamon and nutmeg) or sweet pumpkin flavors. It’s more like the smell you get from the dirt in a pumpkin patch mixed in with some pumpkin flavors."
""
""
"Overall this is fine and I have no problem drinking one, but this is a little lackluster. There are better pumpkin ales."
"A tasty pumpkin beer. The spices are the main focus, but the pumpkin does come through and compliments these notes."
""
"Barely average for a pumpkin. At least it's not a spice bomb. Unfortunately, it's not a bomb of anything... other than it bombed as a promising pumpkin ale. 3.0"
"This a very good take on a pumpkin ale when the calender flips from September to October. The appearance is like everyone else has said is a dark copper color where the head dissipates quickly. The smell is quite pleasant. I caught a distinct smell of pumpkin with hints of cinnamon and nutmeg. The taste of this one is one of the better pumpkin beers I have had in a long time. It does have a sweeter taste than most from the spices incorporated through out the brewing process. This is definitely not a sour ale. The beer does feel smooth and the bitters do not really come out hence 10 IBUs. I personally like beers with higher IBUs, but for a good seasonal change of pace beer this is a good one to try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A great pumpkin beer! I would not mind a little more pumpkin though!"
""
"Hard to rate this, as I question whether I am being critical of the beer or the style. This is not anywhere near the Shipyard garbage we are subjected to in the Northeast, nor is this Dogfish Head on the other end of the spectrum. As I drank this, I found that I didn't hate it, but I certainly wouldn't be leaping to the fridge for another. Worth a try if you are into the style. Stick with something else if you are not."
""
""
""
"Dark copper orange in color and hazy. Poured with a short beige foam that reduced to a soapy cap. Sweet pumpkin pie-like aromas with light spiciness. You can almost smell the pie crust. Smooth, syrupy feel with pleasant carbonation on the edges. Coriander and cinnamon over lightly sweet pumpkin from start to finish. A touch of spicy, tangy, hop toward the end. Finishes with a long lasting spiciness. This was a bit of a buzz kill. Look, aroma and feel were clicking but the taste leaned a bit to far to the spicy side and the malt and pumpkin flavors thin out at the end."
""
"I was not very impressed with this beer. Thin on the body with little to bring anyone running to find these bottles. Pours a cinnamon amber color with no head to speak of. Aroma is mostly like a weak brown ale/amber ale hybrid with some sourness and slight pumpkin type aromas with hints of nutmeg. A very average beer. In fact, below average for pumpkin beers. Guess I will be giving the final five of these to my wife."
""
""
""
"Pours a slightly hazy orange with a foamy khaki head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Small dots and streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, a vegetal pumpkin smell, and some nice pumpkin pie spice aromas. Taste is much the same with a mild spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that has a more earthy pumpkin flavor than others of the style I have tried in the past."
"Pours a cloudy copper with half a finger of head. The head dissipates quickly and leaves only a trace of lacing behind. The nose is pumpkins, but also something a touch astringent. The flavor is quite flat and muted. The high point of teh experience is the finish, which is pleasantly dry. However, this hardly makes up for the general blandness of this offering."

"Nothing special, nothing terrible. Easy drinkin."
"i like this one because its less spice and sugar and more squashy than many other pumpkin ales. it pours a nice seasonal red/orange color with a small white bubbly head. its got a real radiance to it, looks inviting. the smell is a spiced ale, with some cinnamon and nutmeg detectable over a caramel malt base. the flavor is not heavy on the spices at all, and is in fact quite earthy. the pumpkin gives it some fall flavors of sweet squash and brown butter. there is some vanilla and burnt sugar in there too, but they are in the background. the feel is a little undercarboanted i think, and could stand a pick me up in that department. the body though is a nice round medium to full, and the beer is sessionable because of its low abv and lesser sugars than many pumplin ales. overall a good fall seasonal, not epic, but solid for the price."

"Overall - I don't get it, all the flavors are here but they just don't work because the malts aren't there to help build upon the flavors! It lacks the vibrancy that I expect from Pumpkin Ales. It comes off as inoffensive, but very disappointing"

"Overall this is sub-par when it comes to pumpkin beers. The good ones are few and far in between, and while this one is a roughly accurate representation of the style at-large, it just isn't that good."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: The flavors are dynamic, but I feel like there could have been more pumpkin. I’m not a fan of spiced beers and this is more of a harvest seasonal than a pumpkin in my opinion. Not my favorite pumpkin beer this season."
""
"Notes: Not shabby of a Pumpkin beer it's drinkable and tasty. Cheers."

"Well done."
"O: I am impressed here. This was not a cheap light brown ale with a ton of spices, it actually tastes like pumpkins and I can believe that they are in here. This is completely sessionable and a delicious pumpkin ale with real pumpkin flavor. I cannot think of one that is not a light brown ale that is more sessionable with less flavor."
""
""
""
""
"Overall – The flavors are on the lighter side and the sweetness is somewhat low as well giving it a light and crisp flavor. Ii you want a session pumpkin then this may be it."

"Pours a clean deep orange-ish color with an off white head. In the aroma, vanilla, cinnamon and spice, with a note of pumpkin fruit. In the taste, spices stand out, with a nice note of pumpkin, but a bit watery. A spice bite and a medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry mellow spice and a note of pumpkin in the aftertaste. Spicy, a bit sweet, and water, but decent."
"I actually have to second OneDropSoup…. This one is a really nice pumpkin brew but come the end of October I would want something a bit more potent both in mouthfeel and pumpkin taste. It makes me very happy when it is still a bit warm out and I’m in the mood for pumpkin beer."
""

""
""
"O-this really isn't a good pumpkin ale. The pumpkin is very diluted. It just tastes like an adjunct ale pretty much. "
""
"O - lackluster when it comes to pumpkin beers. Bridges the gap between those and a fest beer. Spiciness is low as is the natural pumpkin flavor. Easy to drink and low ABV, but nothing really making me want to session this beer. Pretty average at best. Probably a one and done."
""
"I really liked this one. Not a Weyerbacher and not trying to be. At 4% you can have more than one on a cooler night. So many of the lighter pumpkins really miss on the taste and this one does the style proud. Recommended."
""
""
""
"Not a bad go at it. I can't say there's a lot too memorable about this one, but I enjoyed it nonetheless & it's still enough to put me in the mood, kind of a good """summer pumpkin""" beer, if you will."

"Overall I agree with others that even though this beer isn't bad it's not very interesting either. Worth trying and 10x better than Smuttynose's godawful version of a pumpkin ale."

"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a nice medium orange amber, one finger fine white head and lacing (!), nice constant carbonation. Aroma of pumpkin, pie spices and a vague, faint metallic component. Taste is surprisingly nice, pumpkin, light grain, faint malt, pumpkin pie spices. Light, but quite adequate body. Well integrated. This is not one of the great pumpkin ales, but for a 4% beer is more than respectable. Nicely done, but probably not a repeater because there are more interesting ones out there."
""

""
""
"O - I liked the crispness of the flavor profile, but still would have liked a bit more body behind it. Nice drinkability though."
""
""
""
"The aroma was about as rich in pumpkin spice as you could possibly get. Huge notes of spices that just come whiffing up to the surface. This was an enormously good smelling beer. I swear if you could bottle the fall season, it would come close to this I am sure. The flavor was more of the same, rich in every sense of the word. Huge notes here of all spice, pumpkin, and hints of earthy grains."
""

""
"O: Pumpkin session ale for sure. Smell and taste aren't earth shattering but there's nothing wrong with this beer, don't let the low scores fool you. It's just very mild compared to most pumpkin ales. Simple and subtle."
""
"O- overall a forgettable, albeit decent pumpkin ale. The toasted malt character gives it a bit of Marzen-like feel, making it a nice pumpkin beer to transition from Oktoberfests."

"Overall a refreshingly mild brew with a nice dose of flavor that is not overdone."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into my Stone IRS tulip. Pours a nice dark orange/amber color, little to no haze, and a good finger of head that dies in about a minute. The lacing is better than average. Very sticky. On the nose, straight up the meat of a pumpkin pie. Not the browned top, caramely part, but the middle of the pie, the moist part. Cinnamon, nutmeg and gord smell are prevalent. A light sweetness. On the palate, it's Thanksgiving, with bubbles. Light pumpkin flavor up front, spices round out the middle (mostly cinnamon and nutmeg like the nose) and a mild hop bitterness to round things out. Maybe a little thin on the mouth, and overly carbonated, but you gotta work around the 4% abv. Lots of flavor packed into this little guy. In the upper tier of pumpkin beers for me."
"O - This has decent drinkability. The flavor is alright and it goes down pretty good. Overall, this is an alright pumpkin beer. the flavors just aren't really working for me, mostly due to the earthiness. I still think it is worth trying though, but I won't spend money on it again."
"The focus is definitely on the spice with this one, which I prefer but it’s certainly not overdone. Just an easy, smooth spice and pumpkin beer that anyone could enjoy. No off flavors or dominant malts at all."
"Had this beer on tap it was pretty good, it had a nive maber. Color would have liked to see more head and retention in the glass but sometimes you can't have it all the taste was balanced compaired to other pumpkin beers I've had this season and did not have an overpowering spice or pumpkin notes to it. Overall this beer was pretty good worth a shot if you enjoy this style otherwise you may want to go wwith someother fall seasonal beer"
"Texture is thin and lackluster. Really not a lot to talk about here. If there was a touch more body, then this would be a decent pumpkin ale alternative."
"T: I definitely wanted a little more from the pumpkin in this one. Starts some bready malts and baking spices with a hint of grain and then moves more towards the pumpkin and cinnamon flavors. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, but it's really drinkable. Not a bad pumpkin ale at all."
"A session beer for this time of the year probably doesn't get any more apparent than this. It's not the best option out there but now that I have a few of these in my fridge, it's nice to know that I can crack one open and just enjoy it, without getting all complex or waxing poetic. Once in a while, that's not a bad thing and although I'm still not a huge fan of this style, it's always good to have something like this available during the peak foliage season!"
"mouthfeel - good carbonation, light body, not what i wanted out of a pumpkin ale though. all around very light and airy."
"O: Pleasant because it doesn't smack you in the face with pumpkin, but the pumpkin is there and its not artificial."
"Mildly whipped up one finger head of mixed bubble sizes, fades away quickly to leave a thin coating across the surface, the lacing is wispy and not longlasting either. The liquid presents a pretty orange bronze color with a brown tint, moderate transparency and only a few visible bubble beads. The nose features much more spice than outright pumpkin, loads of cinnamon and ginger scents as well as flowers and lemon peel, has a brisk and penetrating feel to it, cleansing presence in your nostrils. Medium-bodied with a fizzy, if clipped, carbonation which stirs things up during the mouth entry. Here the pumpkin comes through much clearer along with a vanilla to whipped cream aspect. This not to diminish the sharp spices, no denying them from start to aftertaste. The white citrus larger while there’s also bread crust and straw notes, more “hoppier” than “hoppy” per se. Well-integrated and thirst quenching, delivers the flavors you expect without overdoing it."
"Lighter bodied than most pumpkin beers I've had with a rather fizzy, over-carbonated mouthfeel. Definitely not a bad beer. Has a pretty solid flavor and easy to drink just a little too watered down for me."
"O: Descent pumpkin ale. Better than I was expecting from the reviews, but not great. Pretty average."
"O: A rather well done pumpkin beer, I thought, at least. Certainly better than a lot of the other ones out there."
"One of the drier, less pumpkin spiced pumpkin beers. Not bad, but pretty ordinary."
"O: A solid pumpkin. I appreciate the low ABV as well."
"- A very nice full flavored spicy pumpkin ale, and light enough on alcohol to drink more than a couple if needed. Nice seeing it in a 6-pack, and it holds up to many of the other lighter pumpkin brews out there. Worth the buy for sure."
"all in all, I'm enjoying this one. not the best pumpkin i've had, but certainly not the worst. I find it a pleasant showing of the style, and it's got a bit of character. if I had more, I'd be looking forward to drinking 'em. For a true pumpkin spiced beer, this one ain't that bad."
"Clear, light copper color with three fingers of white fluffy head. Excellent lacings. Head still present at the half way point. Mild spice aroma. Taste is a tasty light amber ale with just a touch of pumpkin and spice. Some fair peppery bitter hop shows up after a few sips. Body is average but good for such a low abv. (4%) beer. This beer was served at about 55-60 deg. F. which is somewhat warmer than I usually drink my beers. This may be part of the reason the head and lacing were so impressive. Also, the beer store had just received this a few days ago. I'm not much for fruity, veggie, or any beers with added flavors but I liked this one fine. I could still taste the underlying beer flavor. I could drink more than one of these."
"Good beer. Still in search of an """A"" worthy pumpkin ale."
"On tap at the Mellow in Greensboro.Poured a light orange shade for a pumpkin ale with a fizzy white head atop.Light sweet pie spice in the nose and that was really all,light and fizzy in the mouth with more spice rather than pumpkin flavors.Iam gonna try the imperial pumpkin that Uinta makes,this gets a failing grade in my opinion."
"But if you're looking to have one or two, this isn't it. Too weak, think, and certainly not enough pumpkin."
"Not one I'm likely to get again."
"Here's a new category: Pumpkin Mild. Interesting for the high drinkability and flavor in a low-alcohol beer. Nice amber color in the glass. A ginger ale flavor, and more of a cooked pumpkin. Less of the spices, fortunately, to my taste. Slight tartness, like a Saison. This might be good with some Belgian yeast. However, it's a rather light, plain amber beer with some murky but appealing squash flavors. Fragrant nose of unidentified fruit. A touch of earth and mushrooms. Sprightly body. I would try this for a nice out-of-the-fridge gulp, a fall leaf-raker beer.."
"Notes: Not extraordinary but it makes for a nice Pumpkin Ale that I would not mind repeating."
"O: Average pumpkin beer. I am used the over powering spice and pumpkin flavors. This seemed a little watered down. Maybe a nice beer for a person justing getting into pumpkin beers. Its a one and done for me. (Well, as soon as I finished this six pack. The store clerk swore up and down about this beer and got me.)"
"Conclusion: This is a good pumpkin beer. I enjoyed the extra helping of bitterness and especially the aftertaste. The head was quite good as well."
"This brew poured out as a nice looking amberish orange color. The head fizzles away to just a white film over top of the beer. No laceing here really. The smell of the beer is very minimal, I was strut Leif to get much of any aroma at all actually. The taste of this beer is pretty good I thought. There is a decent amount of spice from start to finish. The mouthfeel of this beer is drinkable, decent carbonation and body. Overall this brew was pretty good, but not the best in it's style."
"M- more carbonated than it appears. Looks flat but isn't. Tastes very diluted in general. Like an american standard macro with some added flavor. Not that great. Won't have it again."
"Part one of two of my Utahn pumpkin beer back-to-back mini-fete. This one pours a clear tawny-copper topped by a finger of dirty white foam. The nose comprises caramel, nutmeg, cinnamon, brown sugar, very light cocoa, mandarin orange syrup, and light rye crust. The taste brings in more of the same, along with some buttery toffee and toasted pumpkin seeds. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a nearly creamy feel. Overall, a pretty solid pumpkin beer, one that manages to balance nicely between spice and pumpkin. Now on to the oak-aged cousin..."
"I mentioned that this was a session beer. I would buy a case of this for my pumpkin beer for the season. Nothing crazy, certainly not anything imperial, and just complex enough that I am looking to get some more already. Great example of the style and this really melds """pumpkin pie""" with """beer""" well. You can pick out all the elements in this brew!"
"Overall: Another run-of-the-mill pumpkin ale. Nothing special going on here, but at least it's got some solid presentation. The real pumpkin on the nose is a nice added touch and it's definitely a drinkable fall beer."
"Overall - being the first punkn beer I've tried, its pretty good. I could drink more but I think for this style, 1 and done is probably the way to go."
"O: A pumpkin ale that smells good, but is overall just too bland."
"Overall, this probably isn't in my top 3 for the style, but if you want a Pumpkin Ale that won't get you bombed, this is a real winner."
"O: An okay pumpkin beer but there's better to be had. The body is good, but the taste just doesn't hold up. I do like the newly designed label though, similar to the old one, but with a bit more pizzazz."
"O: Nice to see a new pumpkin ale in the Southland. However, I think the 4% hinders it; it doesn't live up to the promise of the nose."
"Overall an easy drinking pumpkin ale. I've had many that were disappointing but I think this one is quite underrated. Any session strength ale that is not boring is usually a winner in my opinion. I bought this 6-pack for my wife, however I might end up drinking most of it myself..."
" From the start the pour is standard into a Sam Adam's glass(I'm from Boston, what can I say) with an orange glow and a good lasting head if poured right. Proper lacing covers the glass as you drink. The smell is very authentic pumpkin, the same as when you cut open one to carve, and that's the best your going to get with my stuffy nose. Taste is very different that you might expect. I did not like this the first few mouthfuls, but after drinking the hole thing its a very real, maybe closest to real pumpkin without many spices added as any pumpkin beer this season. The taste is smooth, nothing sticks out to much besides the real pumpkin flavor. I would suggest folks buy this beer and drink it with the understanding that it is going to be different than most but in its own style it is a very good pumpkin beer. Would I buy again, YES. But I would not mix this with the other pumpkin beers seeing this one is very different. Not your typical review yes, but I'm not your typical person."
"Bender Factor: at 4 % ABV (who they hey brews a 4 % brew these days) thats a no go. I wouldn't drink more than one of these anyways."
"M/O: Very crisp and balanced pumpkin ale with good flavoring. The beer isn't overpowering. Good carbonation and really good transition of the seasons."
"Very easy drinking as there are no flaws and almost no alcohol"
"Part of mixed six pack made up by my wife, a few weeks back when she wanted to try some pumpkin beers. Pours a clear medium orange color, with a whisper of light tan head. Pretty weak aromas, subtly reminiscent of pumpkin pie. Fairly light bodied, with more pronounced pumpkin pie flavors, cinnamon, clove and brown sugar. Somewhat lacking."
"Overall, there is nothing special about this pumpkin ale, and there are many others I prefer. Not really a bad beer, but I have no desire to drink another."
"It would go well with a Turkey sandwich with cranberry and stuffing."
"Over priced at $12 a sixer in New York state. Flat tasting, with only a very vague hint of pumpkin spice. I was expecting a strong tasting pumpkin flavor given the name and its halloween oriented, sleek black-and-orange packaging. Very light tasting. This is a decent afternoon beer only if you can get it for less than $10 a six, which you probably can't. So it's something to avoid in general. You'd be much better off with any popular seasonal (magic hat, saranac, or sierra nevada). Thumbs down."
"Overall: The body of this beer is medium light with a medium finish. The beer is okay it has a funky pumpkin flavor to it which takes a minute to get used to followed by a weird aftertaste."
"Pours light copper win a thin off white head. Plenty of visible carbonation. A bit if lacing. Smell is really plain. Hint of spice and very mild pumpkin. A bit squashy and really light cinnamon. A bit vegetal. Feel is light and undercarbonated. Quite plain. Cool label and some nice lacing, but that's about all I can say in favor of this beer."
"pretty bare bones, not overall very impressive. slightly sweet aftertaste that lingers on without improvement."
"D: This is an OK take on the style, but not something I'll be revisiting soon."
"They might need to rethink this concoction. Not the worst. Hardly up with the best."
"Its drinkablity is ok, but the the pumpkin is almost an overkill, and the finish is just dumped with spices, and with not enough other flavors, it just isn't doing the job for this fall brew."
"This was a pretty good pumpkin beer compared to others I've had, which tasted like cinnamon soda."
"I gave this beer nearly pure 2s, the mark of """not impressed.""" The lone 3, average, goes to drinkability because this beer would be drinkable if I respected myself all that much less."
"I have been searching for the perfect pumpkin ale for over 15 years. This one comes the closest so far. The deep orange color and burnt pumpkin aroma blew me away. Taste is right on with very little spice, sweetness or hops; its all toasted pumpkin. The reality is that pumpkin has a very mild flavor, and this is as close as it gets. Other pumpkin ales seem to try to achieve a pumpkin pie flavor in a beer by adding to much spices. To me this ale strives to complement pumpkin pie instead of mimicry. Even 15 minutes later I can still taste the burnt pumpkin. With the low ABV I could definitely drink a six pack in one session. I'll be looking forward to Punk'n Ale returning next year."
"There are so many good pumpkin ales (Southern Tier Pumking, Dogfish Head Punkin), that it's hard to rate this any better than mediocre. The smell is truly great though, if they could get the taste to stand-up to the smell, this would be a truly great beer."
"Drinkability: Good enough....prob take in two then switch over to a 90-minute IPA. Don't let the rating on this one sway you...its a good one"
"Drinkability: Perhaps because its not quite the season yet for fall beers that could account for my review but overall its a simple pumpkin beer. You could easily down a few without registering the fact you had a pumpkin beer with the exception that they did a good job on the spices. Not bad, but nothing to search out for."
"This is actually a good pumpkin beer, the mix of spices was well done such that they are not too overpowering, despite being the dominant note in the beer. But if you don't like pumpkin pie spice in your beer then I would stay away from this beer as it is a bit one-dimensional."
"Seeing as this six pack cost me $2.99 before good 'ol tax, not bad. I do prefer it to some macro. Obviously sessionable because of the alcohol and not unpleasant."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has an orange/brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of fresh pumpkin pie. Taste like it smells, pumpkin and spices, finishing a tad bitter. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall this is a quality beer."
"D: A bland and unexciting experience that quickly grows tiresome. Rivals in mediocrity and not worthy six pack, and hardly worth a single purchase. Pass on this one."
"Thanks, Douglas88, for the opportunity"
"D: A little tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, very mild kick, decent representation of style, it's not a bad beer but there are several others in the style that I would pick first."
"Mouthfeel is thin and watery, and the carbonation feels fizzy."
"D - Nothing special about this pumpkin ale, and there are many others that I'd choose first. Not really a bad beer, but I have no desire to drink another."
"Again, very nice pumpkin flavors upfront--but there was little complexity thereafter."
"Burnt orange in color, nice creamy white head, decent retention and lacing. Smell is of pumpkin spices and an off plastic and cooked vegtable smell. Taste is an almost medicinal like blend of pumpkin spices with minimal emphasis on pumpkin. Flavor improved greatly as it warmed. Light bodied, creamy but overcarbonated. There is a decent flavor profile hidden behind all that is off."
"the drinkability is fair. it's not the best pumpkin ale i've ever had, it's very mild, but worth a try for fans of the style. i also like the bottle design."
"Note - Great label design... It's simple and minimalistic, but he orange font pops on the black background on the main label and the opposite color scheme on the neck of the bottle..."
"Pours a coppery color with a thin head that dissipates quicklike. Smells of spices, with a bit of pumpkin undertone. Taste is very similar, although a bit weak. Starts off with the spices and then mellows into the pumpkin flavors at the end. Its a bit thin for the style, but its not a bad drinking brew."
"Overall, not one of the better Pumpkin brews out there, but I think this is a bit underrated. Not bad at all."
"Pours a clear orange-amber color with a one finger head that dies down to a ring pretty quickly and leaves little lacing behind. Smells kind of like toasty malts with some pumpkin. Spices and nutmeg in there too. Tastes of pumpkin, nutmeg and malts. Nothing too complex in the taste. The taste seems to fade to straight spices after a while, like many pumpkin beers. Mouthfeel is light, a bit creamy with a good carbonation bite and no alcohol warming. Drinkability is alright, the taste is not too special, the price was not bad, the spices are already starting to kill this beer (as with many pumpkin ales), probably won't buy again."
"CHEERS!!"
"Drinkability: For a pumpkin beer (or any kind of beer for that matter), not so good. Other than the appearance, nothing is really noteworthy about this brew. Smell is subdued, taste is off. Not a total drain pour, but close."
"I really didn't care for the flavor profile, so this went down a little rough."
"Overall a pretty good Pumpkin Ale offering. Not sure why the ratings are so low, but I really enjoyed it."
"I like this beer. True to the style with an earthy and raw feel of fresh pumpkin mixed with a spicy bite that is appropriate for the fall season. Some pumpkin ales make the mistake of adding a nasty artificial flavor to their pumpkin brews, but that is not the case here and I respect that. The flip side, not sure how many of these I could drink in a row."
"D- Definitely o.k enough to drink a few, but again, I like a little bit more zip in the construction of the brew so I can feel comfortable sipping on this next to a fire without it flattening out completely"
"Overall: As a pumkin beer like we (or I) am use to, this really isn't that good. As the lable says """Harvest Pumkin Ale""" then its ok. Even without the pumkin, which I love, as a harvest ale it is just an ok beer. A lot of work is needed on the malt bill & body. Even tho there isn't much spices I enjoy the idea of a hearty beer (which they failed to hit that mark) with a solid pumpkin flavor. Im glad I gave this beer a try but I don't tink Ill buying this again. Great idea too many flaws"
"Overall not bad, not too sweet and not overloaded with spices either, fairly tasty and drinkable, but not as good as the oaked jacked."
"EDIT: The 2010 version is actually better. A solid malt character comes through, spices aren't too potent, and it's still insanely drinkable. Now I'd say it's highly recommended."
"No drain pour but I'd only have more if offered for free, thank you."
"Too little pumpkin and too much sweetness and spices, this could have used some more balance and definitely more body. This just didn't hold my interest for very long."
"Drinkability: Doesn't offend..good mouthfeel...its drinkable, but I wouldn't consider it to be a premier pumpkin ale."
"D: This isn't the worst beer. The nose is kind of Ok till you pickup the old tennis shoe in the background. Better than bud =P"
"Pours light brown, rather clear, a short bubbly head that quickly dissipates, with no lacing whatsoever. Nose is very cinnamon up front, with some background sweets. Taste is also quite spicy in the beginning, but it gradually dissipates into a light cinnamon and light sweet flavor. There is no pumpkin that I can detect. Goes down easy at first, but then becomes rather thin and flat. Doesn't hold up as I would expect."
"Bottle bought at Smith's. Pours a clear amber color with a small off-white head. The aroma is very nice; sweet pumpkin notes, some toasted malts, some spices, cinnamon and cloves mostly. The taste is nice and relaxed; a full pumpkin flavor that is not overwhelming and mixes almost totally into the malt profile to create a nice smooth and toasted flavor. Some spices come to the fore and the finish is sweet and smooth. As usual, Uinta makes quality beers. A easy and quaffable drink, but also well crafted and tasty."
"Got one of these off a friend. The alternatives weren't too great, but I might have been better off with a Yuengling. Overall, this is just not that interesting. Just a weak aroma and flavor of slight nutmeg and pumpkin spiciness, but nothing much else here to keep my interest. Much better off to go with something like DFH Punkin or Southern Tier Pumking, the two top beers in this style, in my opinion."
"From a brown 12oz bottle - Pours a fairly clear reddish/orange with a slight head and very low carbonation. Smells of sweet species, nutmeg, cloves leading the way, with mild hop presence. First sip is sweet but too sweet. The spice are mellow but there is nothing to write home about. Finishes slightly bitter. Decent mouthfeel that is under carbonated."
" Session worthy due to low ABV,not due to taste.Taste was not awful,just a bit light on character."
"Drinkability: A decent, rather drinkable pumpkin ale with a respectably low ABV."
"Overall- Not bad at all. Very mild and sessionable, surprisingly good."
"Pours a clear brilliant amber with 2 fingers of foamy eggshell colored head. Good retention and some wisps of lacing. Smells of cinnamon, nutmeg, bread, and light pumpkin. Tastes of light floral hops up front then cinnamon and nutmeg. Lots of grain and honey malt follow, with not much happening in the finish besides grain. Light in body and high in carbonation. Thin but some crispness. Grainy with some spices, but not one of the better pumpkin ales out there."
"D. Less spiced than I usually like but a good beer all around. more like a well done pale ale with pumpkin and a minor dose of spice."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into my Dogfish Head shaker glass. Appears a clear golden amber color with about half an inch of off-white foam that disappears in under 30 seconds. This one actually smells and tastes of roasted pumpkins, somewhat rare in pumpkin beers, which are usually dominated with spices. There are notes of allspice, nutmeg and bready yeast in the nose, but they are lost in the taste. All I'm getting in the flavor dept. are pumpkin and metallics. A notch below medium in both body and carbonation. This one went down easy enough, but I'd limit this to a bottle a year if I had an empty slot to fill in my mix-n-match six pack. Although, it is a nice alternative to all the high abv pumpkin ales that seem to be hitting the shelf in the past few years."
"You know, this is really quite a nice beer. Nice low abv for a change of pace and subtly spiced while allowing the pumpkin to shine through. Tastes fresh as well. Pours orange toward the darker end of the spectrum, but with a fairly light head. What is there sticks around as a thin ring. Light aroma of roasted pumpkin, and even lighter aroma of mace. Subdued, but pleasant. The taste is also nice and pumpkiny with some subdued but noticeable maxe and cinammon as well as a perhaps the barest amount of vanilla. Very smooth, and the earthy vegetal pumpkin shines through the most. Almost nutty. Full flavored and very smooth, but with just enough spice bite to keep it flavorful. This is the way to do a low abv beer. Very enjoyable. My wife and I enjoyed a sixpack of these."
"Mostly clear deep pumpkin orange with coppery edges. Small, persistent, lacy, creamy, light khaki head. Caramel cookie dough, light molasses, hints of baking spices, some pumpkin pie batter, and a little metal. Toasted malt and astringent grain up front. Caramel and cookie malt follow. Subtle sweetness. Pumpkin pie and baking spices gently drift in. Spicy hop presence in the finish. Not bad. Moderate body with a creamy feel. A rather mild, malty pumpkin ale, that goes easy on the spices, and is therefore more drinkable."
"D: Nice beer. Nothing earth shattering but a nice beer to have while not thinking during fall. I don't even know how this got to NY."
"Overall, I'm impressed. This is a very hard style to pull off with such finesse, and there aren't many that i can give a 4.5 to for drinkability. Worth trying."
"Not an offensive beer, in fact, for simply being an ale, I rather enjoyed it. However, a pumpkin beer, it is not, IMO."
"Drinkability: I wasted money on a six-pack I'd never heard of. I'm tempted not to finish the first one, and the other five will likely be foisted upon an unsuspecting acquaintance in the near future. I've had worse, but this one's not worth your time."
"Pours a reddish golden color. Low lying white head with no head retention. Great clarity, my guess is filtered which could be causing the lack of pumpkin flavor. Cinnamon, clove, and some slight vegetal (good) in the flavor. The mouthfeel is a bit lacking as it is thin but somehow is cloying at the end. This beer being from salt lake, I can't be over 4%abv so props to the brewers for making a decent brew with those kind of restrictions. Can it be that this recipe would send you singing if they didn't have the State of Utah overseeing their procedures? I would hope so, but as is, it's not giving me a reason to warm up my voice."
"Overall a tasty, light and sessionable pumpkin ale."
"Pours a clear copper color with a decent dense white head that dissipated into a sparse cap. The aroma is light brown sugar, nutmeg, cinnamon, and allspice. Noticable pumpkin ale aromas. Wow, the taste falls flat. The flavor is of watery grain with some light pumpkin spice flavors, thats about it. The feel is light with moderate carbonation. It has that light macro astrigent feel. A beginners pumpkin ale. It has the very basic flavor yet it still resembles a light macro lager. I prefer my pumpkin ales much maltier with more robust flavor."
"Wasn't terribly impressed with this one. I didn't hate it by any means, but there's nothing to love here either. Bland. Uninspired. Too simple. Average at best and something I likely wouldn't revisit given the amount of tasty pumpkin beers to be found in the fall. Can't recommend this one."
"I have 2 questions why did the brewer bother? & What the hell am gonna do with other five beers?, disappointing"
"This beer feels watery."
"Not recommended..."
"(Unbiased score: Wastach 4, Uinta 2. Wasatch still wins)."
"Pours a clear dark amber color, nice carbonation, nice cream tan head, lots of lacing througout the drink. Scents of slight spices, malts, and hops. The taste is slightly spiced, basically no pumpkin flavor at all, big disappointment. Medium body, carbonated feel in the palate. Drinkable, but not a very good pumpkin ale, well at least not like the other I've had."
