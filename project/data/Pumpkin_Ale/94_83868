3.5,-5.7,,,,,,"Bottle, poured into a tulip.  Had a Weyerbacher Imperial Pumpkin last night so I wanted to try this during the 1 pm games today.  Solid.  A: poured a very pumpkiny orange-brown, with a thick head that was creamy white on top and more orange down towards the beer.  No lacing, and the head did not stick around long.  S: great pumpkin flavor, but lots of spices.  There was a malty sweetness, but no creaminess.  T: warming, solid cold and after warming up a bit, with aggressive spice and pumpkins.  No hops whatsoever, as expected. Aftertaste of some dry spices and an earthiness, like a wet grain.  Tasted more bitter than sweet.  Solid, but not great--mostly nice because it wasn't imbalanced like a lot of other pumpkin ales.  M: mouthwatering and medium-bodied.  You do feel that 8% ABV.  O: Pretty good, and better than most pumpkins.  Nicely balanced and not overly spiced nor super-sweet, but a bit too much astringent/bitter flavor for me, and you could taste the higher content more than other imperial pumpkins.","brother_rat","Sep 06, 2014"

Smell is pumpkin spice, cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, and some brown sugar. Taste is all that, very balanced and not over the top like some of these pumpkin beers, nice. Body is medium, nice amount of carbonation, not dry, and easy sipping, pretty tame for 8%. It is a nice cool fall evening the perfect night for this, probably my favorite pumpkin fan ever.

3.58,-3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"O: This is a pretty average pumpkin beer but it is pretty easy to drink for an 8% ABV beer, which is saying something. It is a great deal at $4.99 for a bomber, much cheaper than other pumpkin beer offerings available in bombers locally. Enjoyable but nothing really stands out with this beer.","dbrauneis","Sep 03, 2012"

3.33,-10.2,3.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,"Served in a stem glass, burnt orange color, with a small cap of off-white head, minimal lacing and retention. Nutty aroma, malt sweetness and mild pumpkin pie spice. Taste is fairly nutty, woody, brown-ale-ish maltiness, notes of pumpkin, cinnamon and nutmeg, not very big in the pumpkin pie territory, and when it comes to pumpkin ales, I do like a big up front slam of pumpkin and spice. This beer just came up short. Medium body, fairly drinkable, but nothing I'd go back for, especially with the likes of Weyerbacher around.","Rifugium","Sep 01, 2012"

3.58,-3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"O: This one is over spiced for a pumpkin ale. I like it, but it is slightly out of balance with all of the spices taking over and stealing the show. The malt body seems to be good and it is relatively thick for a pumpkin ale.","alpinebryant","Aug 31, 2012"

3.97,7,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Unsurprisingly, another first beer from a new brewery for me via the pumpkin or octoberfest variety. After sampling a few other staple pumpkin beers earlier this week, I bought a case of 22's of this selection. It's definitely an ale, with good body and consistency, and easy to drink. This beer has a comparable taste of other """spicy""" pumpkin ales with less abv. which impressed me. I'm not particularly a fan of this type of pumpkin ale, but as an ale fan, this beer is strong.","PokerPlayingBeerLover","Aug 27, 2012"
3.74,0.8,3,4,3.5,4,4,"Head crests at over a finger of dark tan, orange tinged foam, good mix of different bubble sizes, dissolves to a basic coating, lacing takes the form of not so sticky sheets. Bronze to red rust colored liquid, mostly translucent with a fair amount of visible bubbles, turns a bright yellow around the rims. The amount of pumpkin in the nose is above average, however, it is really the brown sugar, maple syrup which dominates, followed on by cocoa powder, nutmeg, candied orange peel, has a certain toasty feel to it, has an herbal underpinning to the spiciness, carries itself proudly. Medium-bodied, has a softer and creamier mouth entry which then stiffens as the carbonation sets, creates a tighter weave. The pumpkin flavor melds with mocha, coffee, whipped cream, cinnamon and nutmeg along with an orange zest infusion. Seems indecisive in terms of wanting to be structured or sweet and fruity, would probably benefit from just going for it full throttle on the pumpkin. Mouth perfume too heavy to lift much. It’s actually a quite pleasing brew, only needs to have more fun to excel.","farrago","Aug 27, 2012"

It could use a little more pumpkin, but I really like this beer.","strengthdoc","0"
