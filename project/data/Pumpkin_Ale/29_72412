2.75,-9.8,,,,,,"Poured a clear orange body with abundant carbonation bubbles and no head. It looks like a poor, watery pumpkin ale. Scents of pumpkin, apple juice, sweet spices with an emphasis on nutmeg and cinnamon. Overall impression of aroma is of a very sweet, pumpkin forward aroma, too sweet with no real balance. Flavor begins sweet with notes of pumpkin, sweet spices with notes of cinnamon and nutmeg and medium-light apple cider. Middle is sweet with the same flavors continuing. Finish is sweet with notes of pumpkin and sweet spices, the same flavors continue. Aftertaste is sweet spices, nutmeg and cinnamon and some pumpkin. Overall impression of flavor is of a very sweet pumpkin ale without much balance. Mouthfeel is light bodied with high carbonation and a watery feel. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of an okay ale,easy to drink but note a witbier. Overall this is an okay ale. It is too sweet in aroma and flavor, the mouthfeel is easy to drink but not amazing. Nothing special and one of the weaker pumpkin beers.","Auraan","Dec 08, 2014"

Additionally, unlike many pumpkin beers that utilize too much cinnamon, that's not the case here and I can actually taste the nutmeg clearly.

I inverted the bottle several times to get it stirred up before I even unscrewed the cap and then used an aggro pour to ensure both blending and release. What an insult to my intellect! I got a fizzy fingers of tawny head that initially fell quickly and towards their end, suddenly created a cap that hung in quite well. Color was an slightly hazy coppery-orange (SRM = > 13, < 17). It must kill them not to filter the living daylights out of these beers. Hee hee. I got a LOT of nutmeg, followed by cinnamon and cloves on the nose. Mouthfeel was thin and watery and the taste was prevalently cinnamon with the other spices relegated to a back-up role. Finish was semi-dry, thanks to all of the spices, but I still felt unfulfilled. It just seemed to lack depth and oomph.","woodychandler","Oct 11, 2013"

Smell is pleasant, with a good balance of pumpkin and spice but not much complexity. This doesn't taste much like the wheat beer that it is, maybe because the yeast drowns out the wheat. Pumpkin and spice taste good but not all that fresh or interesting. Mouthfeel is relatively thin for a pumpkin ale, but it goes down well and the aftertaste is simple, with just a touch of spice lingering. Overall, this isn't remarkable by any means. It is simple and decent.","DeFaz","Aug 07, 2013"

Served in a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass, the beer pours a cloudy orange color with some sediment floaties noticeable. Head retention is OK, not much lacing. Aroma is nice but weak, it smells like some pumpkin, wheat, nutmeg and some cloves. The taste is similar to the aroma, but there's a slight sour bread-like finish. It's not bad tasting, but not exactly good either. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's surprisingly a bit slick and creamy, but with high carbonation. Not really impressed by this one, but it's drinkable. Got this bottle from a friend so I can't complain too much.","bluejacket74","Nov 21, 2012"

The taste holds notes of funky wheat, what may or may not be pumpkin, and a light dusting of cinnamon. Things do not mesh well at all, frankly, and a bad taste is literally left in my mouth in the end. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slick, nearly watery feel.

HERES MY OPINION: AROMA---POPPED THE TOP AND WATCHED THE DRAGON TAIL-LIKE FOG HOVERING IN-BETWEEN THE AIR AND LIQUID, SPIRALING INTO NON-EXISTENCE. THE LABEL READS """PUMPKINS AND A VARIETY AUTUMNAL SPICES""" WHICH RAISED MY EXPECTATIONS; MY EXPECTATIONS WERE UNMET. TYPE IN """AROMA""" IN GOOGLE AND SHOCK TOP WILL NOT BE NUMBER 1. NOR WILL IT BE 2, 3 OR 4...YOU SEE WHERE I AM GOING WITH THIS. THIS BEER LACKS A DISTINCT AROMA. CINNAMON, PUMPKIN (SOMETHING REDNECKS DO DURING HALLOWEEN) AND NUTMEG HAVE A STRONG AROMA. I COOK QUITE A BIT AND HAVE USED ALL THREE. I FEEL AS IF THE FOLKS AT AH-BUSH DID NOT USE ANY OF THE THREE. AND YES, I DID FOLLOW THE POURING INSTRUCTIONS ON THE NECK. APPEARANCE--- LOOKS LIKE ANOTHER BUD PRODUCT. LETS INNOVATE FOLKS. TASTE---MEDIUM BITTER AFTER TASTE, LIGHT TO START. NO SHOCK-TOP. BING """TASTE""" AND YOU MAY GET SHOCK TOP AS A RESULT BECAUSE BING SUCKS. PALATE---LIGHT BODY, THIN POLAND SPRINGS LIKE TEXTURE, DIET COKE FIZZ, SLIGHT BITTER FINISH LEAVING YOU TO CRAVE FOR SOMETHING ELSE. CLOSE TO FINISHING THE BOTTLE, I SWALLOW AND MAKE A FACE (TO MYSELF) ; A CONTORTED, JUST SMELLED A DEAD BODY KINDA FACE. AND FOLKS, DONT LET THIS BEER GET WARM...NASTY.

The aroma was spice with the nutmeg and cloves dominating and a flash of the cinnamon on the back end. The pumpkin made a light showing, but you can tell it is there in the aroma. There was no malt or hops that I could discern. The taste was decent. with the spice dominating the first of it fading to the pumpkin and then a little malt taste making a token appearance. Mouthfeel is ok with the carbonation tickling the tip of the tongue, but the body is somewhat watery. I was apprehensive in buying the beer at first, the raspberry beer was a disaster, and I took a few minutes staring down the beer in the cooler before giving it a try.

This beer has a good level of carbonation on tap with a crisp and clean mouthfeel. Overall, this is much better on tap than from the bottle.

The malt profile keeps the flavor light, but I feel it would be better with the addition of more pale malts. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation.

Pumpkin pie spice massive loads of residual sugar, first off you must like these """pumpkin""" beers to begin with, and secondly I tend to like the ones with actual pumpkin flesh (the gourd) not just the pie spices.

Malt, nut, and bread also help comprise the flavor. Medium-bodied with moderate carbonation. An easy drinker. A lot better than expected. Balanced, not a spice bomb, and while it's not the the most complex beer out there, it keeps things interesting.
