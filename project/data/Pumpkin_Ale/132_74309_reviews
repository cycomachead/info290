"Pretty good pumpkin beer little darker but smells like a pumpkin pie. Tastes like a pumpkin pie but with less spice and more pumpkin. Overall pretty pleased, not as sweet as others like shipyard's but still mad good."

"This was a good pumpkin beer. Probably not something I would buy again because of the price, and there are other good pumpkin beers out there which are much cheaper."
""
"One of the best pumpkin ales I have had."

"Strong, malty aroma has a good tone of pumpkin and more than a hint of cloves. Pours a translucent russet with a fairly thick buff head that leaves some good lacing. Malty flavor has a firm, but not overpowering, note of pumpkin plus hints of cloves and cinnamon and a touch of hops. Texture has good fizz and body. A very good beer for a Halloween party - or for Thanksgiving dinner."

"6.1 ABV, 15 Plato  with a drier finish.  Enjoyed the 750ml bottle"
"No head.  Bland flavor.  Not much better than a run-of-the-mill average pumpkin ale."

"Right up there with Dogfish."

"O- quite drinkable and doesn't go overboard on the spicing, nice pumpkin ale"
"Pumpkin beer is one of my favorite types of beer. This beer has the best pure pumpkin flavor of any of them. Color is that of pumpkin pie. Very little head. Smell is the same as the color. Taste is exceptional. Balances the sweetness with the spice. Doesn't go to heavy on spice. Exceptional pumpkin flavor. Love the finish. Feels slightly less thick than the taste. Overall, pure pumpkin gold."

"Overall - actually alot better than most of the other pumpkin beers ive had this is a beer rather than a beer with tons of spices thrown in to resemble an over spiced pie."

"Body is a little thin and watery for my personal preference, but this was a pleasant surprise. Very well put together nicely balanced pumpkin ale that opts to showcase the gourd itself instead of nestling it in a swaddle of spices that overwhelm its vegetal simplicity."
"Haven't had a non-donut-inspired Rogue beer in a while, so I figured I'd stick with the vague sense of the season and try out their pumpkin ale.  It pours a clear sienna-amber topped by a finger of sandy foam.  The nose comprises caramel, mild pumpkin pie spices, and a twinge of dark greens.  The taste brings in more of the same, relatively heavy on the clove and cinnamon.  The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel.  Overall, not a bad pumpkin ale at all, one that hits the spice notes without burning the tongue with them.  Well-balanced and enjoyable."

"Pours a clear amber orange color with a small head.  The aroma is all pumpkin and spices.  As for taste, this is a very balanced ale with a great pumpkin flavor and just the right amount of spices.  While there are better pumpkin ales, this is a very good one."

"I really enjoyed this beer.  Pours a burnt orange with a little red and a nice beige head.  This is the most pure pumpkin tasting beer I've had yet.  Where Elysian's Night Owl Pumpkin Ale tastes like pumpkin pie, this tastes like pumpkin, and I really like it.  The spices complement the pumpkin subtly rather than overpowering the flavor.  I would rate this higher, but something about this beer makes me not able to drink a whole lot.  One glass of this would be perfect, but 750 mL is quite a bit for one person.  That could be me, but I think a great beer makes me want more than one."
""
"Very smooth rich taste think pumpkin pie..."
""
""
""
""
""

"Really liked this one. Pours a dark brown with an off white head that slowly trails the glass as it fizzes. The smell is full of pumpkin and malt with some very interesting spices. The flavor was full of pumpkins in the beginning but the addition of cardamom (typically an Indian spice) gives this pumpkin ale a very unique taste profile that I think works great and gives a nice balancing spice to the usually very sweet pumpkin ales."
""
"And the sweet orange bottle is a nice souvenir."
""
""
""
""
""
"This ale is quite a delicious pumpkin ale. It pours like a slice of pumpkin goodness deep orange and clear with a half inch of head. The aroma brings all the warmth of fall. The spices come through marvelously in the smell. The taste begins with the sweet flavor of the pumpkin then moves to all those wonderful notes of spice. The mouthfell is exactly what a pumpkin ale, the flavor of the pumpkin as well as the spices linger for a appropriate amount of time.  If you come across this regardless of the venue, give it a taste."

"Solid pumpkin ale.  Pours dark orange from draft with little head that dissipated quickly.  Cloudy.  Smells of spices with a hint of cloves.  Tastes like pumpkin, vanilla, all spice and cloves with a little nutmeg.  Very light and smooth in the mouth. Clean finish.  No bitterness.  Better than Dogfish Head.just behind Schlafly and Alewerks.  Excellent."
""
""
""
"The aftertaste is very pleasant. Just a little bite. No booze. This is a very good pumpkin ale. The bottle was a lot cooler than the photo -  solid orange."
""
"Medium bodied with low carbonation. There is a light pumpkin spice aftertaste. Easy to drink. I am glad I gave this beer a try. Worth picking up again."
""
""

"750ml bottle. Pours a dark rusty orange amber with a small beige head. Aroma is of sweet pumpkin spices, nutmeg and some malt. Taste same as aroma, but not overly sweet or cloying like other pumpkin ales, a bit of cooked vegetable flavor and mild caramel malt undertones with some mild bitterness, Palate is a medium body, good carbonation, sweet and very palatable brew. Finishes with sweet pumpkin spices, nutmeg, some cooked vegetable notes, mild caramel malt and some bitterness on the end for balance. Could have used a bit more pumpkin spice. Overall this is a good, easy drinking, and unassumingly nicely balanced brew."

"Overall – A tasty, easy drinking, pumpkin ale. Lots of spice and roastedness with a good level of sweetness. A rather enjoyable drinker overall."
"The sweeter and molasses malts tend to jump forward before the nutmeg, cinnamon, and other pumpkin spices do leaving them in the dust. But they do catch up ultimately with a quick, clean finish. It was not bad but not one that I would have every year."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Appearance is a brownish copper with a finger of off-white head. The nose has notes of pumpkin but also mild traces of spice, as well. There is also pumpkin in the flavor profile and the finish is slightly dry. This is a full-bodied pumpkin offering that is solid, but not quite exceptional."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Subtle like Adriana Lima in a one piece, this one is doin' it right well."
"Atmosphere is pretty good. Decent head, no real lacing. Nose is pumpkin-y and fall spicy. Full pumpkin and spice flavor, but not sweet. Probably a good thing, because if it was as sweet as the initial nose gave off; it would probably be a little too much. Anyway, well-balanced. Overall, this is a good quaff."
"Overall, yep: this is a pretty decent Pumpkin Ale. It's a style that can be a bit underdone or lackadaisical, but this has enough body and oomph to push it through to something worthwhile. I liked it."

"D - A very well developed Pumpkin Ale... Rich and robust... Rather quaffable... Falls squarely in the middle of the Pumpkin Ale spectrum between spicy and cloying... Tasty and satisfying... The orange bottle is a nice touch as well..."

"O - Wow, this is an excellent pumpkin beer, as you would hope for from Rogue. Not missing any of the flavors you would hope for, just the right amount of pumpkin and not overdoing the sourness like so many others. My only complaint really is the carbonation is too high, but it certainly doesn't detract from the flavor. This is definitely one of the pumpkin ales I would use as a baseline to judge others and would probably grab a bottle next year."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"*As for the complaints about the price tag, it's a """Grow Your Own""" bottle which means it's safe to assume using """home""" grown hops, barley, and pumpkins might be a little bit more labor intensive than having it shipped to one's doorstep."
""
""
"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass. Pours a bright orange red, with a half inch of white, that settles quickly. Smell is like all pumpkin beers, cinnamon, pumpkin, clove, brown sugar, and apple sauce. Taste is exactly like the smell, no surprises, blended well. Body is medium especially for the low abv, could use a little more life, not dry, and easy drinking. This is solid, but expensive for a regular pumpkin beer at $9.99."
""
""
""
"Overall: pedestrian. Lacks a real pop to it. Watered down. Huge disappointment."
"I would have enjoyed this one much better, if the spices were tamed a bit and take a notch or two out of the carbonation"
""
"Poured dark and smooth, very thick head (i poured pretty fast), a very robust spicy smelling beer with great pumpkin flavor. Tasted very similar to the Alewerks Pumpkin which I really enjoyed. Would definitely recommend, a little pricy at 10 bucks for a 750ml"
""
"O: A nice, well-balanced pumpkin beer that doesn't go overboard on the pie spices. Seems bigger than 5.6% (probably due to the pumpkins) while still remaining easy to drink. A little pricey as usual with Rogue, but the bottle is cool to show off"
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a pretty good pumpkin ale, and packs a nice wallop of pumpkin without cloying sweetness nor veering totally into pumpkin pie mode. If you are looking for a pumpkin ale that's not totally pied out, give it a try. I enjoyed."

"One of my fav breweries. Have not had one that I don't love. They are now popping up all over the place. I would love to see more on tap but as of now have only seen Dead guy. I figured living in Chicago I might see more but no dice! If any one has any info on the bars that carry it around my town let me know!!"

"More complicated than expected and a real pleasure - will look for it again."
"I poured this into a glass, it has dark cooper color body with a small white head. The aroma has a nice spice of cinnamon and nutmeg. The taste is strong of spices and has pumpkin on the back of the tongu. The mouthfeel is smooth and overall this is a great pumpkin beer."

"-A medium feel to it with medium carbonation, went down pretty smoothly."
""
"Poured a brownish auburn with decent head on top of a bready, subdued pumpkin and cinnamon aroma, not really noticing much else although a touch of other sugary goodness (probably caramel). It is a light to medium bodied beer that is smooth and easy to drink and finishes crisp and easy thanks to the spice and decent hops and carbonation. As for the taste, a good chunk of pumpkin is noticeable but it is not overpowering and thankfully the spices in here, like a touch of nutmeg, cinnamon, pepper, balance the beer, as do some sweet and bready. So while not overly sweet or pumpkiny, it is also not watery and too spicy and almost no pumpkin is noticeable as I have found in some other (cheap) pumpkin ales. Not the greatest or tastiest pumpkin ale but I got my """pumpkin fix""" and it was sweet enough to enjoy as a dessert beer and that's all I ask."

"750 ml bottle into signature shaker pint glass, 2012 bottling. Pours lightly hazy reddish copper color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Slight spotty soapy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of caramel, pumpkin, pear, ginger, nutmeg, cinnamon, toast, brown sugar, clove, brown bread, and herbal hops. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of malt and spices. Taste of caramel, pumpkin, toast, ginger, pear, nutmeg, cinnamon, brown sugar, clove, brown bread, and herbal spiciness. Fair amount of spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, pumpkin, pear, toast, ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, brown sugar, clove, and herbal spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of flavors; with a nice malt/spiciness balance; and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy, slick, and foamy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish, as expected of 5.6%. Overall this is a highly excellent pumpkin ale! Great balance and complexity of malt/spice flavors; and extremely smooth to drink. A highly enjoyable pumpkin beer offering."
"This beer happily blends real pumpkin flavor with a heavy dose of pie spices. I especially get ginger and nutmeg, though apparently there's even vanilla in here. Sweet flavors, but not sugary. Aftertaste is a little dull with some mysterious residue. Overall I'm finding this very enjoyable. Not the best beer to bring out the flavor of fresh pumpkin pie spices, but a great example of a pumpkin beer that showcases spice without neglecting gourd."

"This ale hit the shelves later than most which I like. Something strange about pumpkin ales in July in Florida...per Rogue the later release was due to growing their own GYO pumpkins and declining to use canned pumpkin. This is an attractive beer with hazy reddish orange body with creamy yellow head. The aroma of pumpkin pie spices is more subtle than other examples of this style, also a plus. The taste: this is , I am happy to report, my favorite of the years pumpkin ales! I've tried a BUNCH of them this year. Well balanced but not boring and no chemical off tastes. I know there is a fair Amount of variability in this style from year to year, ie Weyerbacher was great last year but disappointing this year, but hopefully Rogue will hit the mark again in subsequent years!"
"Final Grade: 4.3, an excellent A grade. Rogue's Pumpkin Patch Ale is a fine specimen of this occasionally-obnoxious style - everything is balanced perfectly, with lots of spicy goodness for those who enjoy that aspect of the style, but never going overboard. This is not a spice/booze bomb that will exhaust your palate. The malty sweetness, gourdy flavours and (relatively) dense body do their part keeping the spice in check, generating an unbelievably quaffable spiced ale. As much as I love Pumking, I like this stuff nearly as much, although for different reasons. Pumpkin Patch is obviously much lighter and nuanced, and for that reason I would suggest it as a perfect introductory pumpkin ale for newbies interested in trying the style. I would also highly recommend it to seasoned pumpkin-loving BAs who are looking for a great fall/winter spiced sipper. Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
"O: Pleasing pumpkin ale, the taste, body and aroma are all spot on. Though, for the price, it can't beat out some of the local brews for much cheaper. A solid make from Rogue none the less."
""
""
""
"O: Great flavor for the style, not overly spices nor synthetic and syrupy tasting like many are. Let this beer warm up and burn off a few of the bubbles and you’ve got a great evening sipper."
""
""
""
"O: Fantastic pumpkin ale! This is full flavored not diluted and has real pumpkin flavor. This is the best pumpkin ale I have has the pleasure of drinking. Hats off to Rogue for this masterpiece. Cheer!"
"Orange bodied with some creamy head and lace. Spicy aroma. Smooth mouthfeel. A better than average pumpkin ale.LCBO score.Good cinammon, cloves, star anise, pepper, vanilla. Good drinkability. I like that there is ore spice than pumpkin vegetable flavour."
"Overall- Very enjoyable, this is one of the better pumpkin beers that I have tried. Maybe Rogue needs to turn down the spice a tad but it is still a good beer."
""
""
"Very good for the style. It's full flavored with plenty of pumpkin and rides the edge of too spicy while maintaining a steady sweetness. Like this one alot."
""
""
""
""
"Overall it's a good beer, just a bit in your face. Looks and smells greats, then takes a step back. A bit of mellowing would likely help."
"Pours browinsh yellow. Unfiltered with a good amount of head that lingers around the rim but little to no lacing left on the glass. Smell reveals pumpkin, nutmeg and a heavy dose of brown sugar. Taste is similar with maybe a bit of cinammon. Spices are forward present and linger well onto the backend. Very good beer for the season."
"O- This is a slightly above average pumpkin ale, kind of a spice bomb. Its flavorful and festive but not very well balanced. Could use a little work."
""
""
""
""
"Chatoe Rogue First Growth Pumpkin Patch features a sweet-savory-spicy combo that evokes the most solacing of fall-time comforts. It's the beer equivalent of coming home to Mom's cooking. """Greens""" feel free to use this ale as proof of the benefits of using locally farmed ingredients. While this would undoubtedly pair with a number of autumn delicacies, a bottle this size makes for a satisfying treat in its own right."
"Overall- Just what I was expecting, a well executed pumpkin ale with layered caramel, spice, and roasted pumpkin. Well done, certainly better than the average pumpkin beer. The price tag's a bit hefty at $10/bomber, but I'd certainly try it on tap."
""
"An evenhanded approach to a pumpkin brew, quite drinkable. Not overly spiced. A little too boozy for a 6% brew, though. Alcohol just a little too present."
"Pours a murky brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Small particles of sediment are seen floating around after the pour. Smell is of toasted malt, biscuit, earthy pumpkin, and some spice aromas. Taste is much the same with a toasty and spice finish. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a good representation of the style. Nothing really sticks out, but nothing is overdone either, which can be a problem with some pumpkin beers."
""
""
""
"O - Overall a tasty pumpkin ale that is surprisingly well balanced, and doesn't overwhelm the palette with spicing. Easily sessioned and well worth trying out if you're a pumpkin ale fan."
"Overall, a good pumpkin ale. Nothing revolutionary but tasty."
""
""
"O: Very good pumpkin ale -- it packs a lot of flavor in for a lower-ABV brew."
"O: I really like the bottle and the amount of detail it explains as to how/where it's made and it's composition. I LOVE the nose. Though the flavors/mouthfeel are a bit unbalanced towards the spicy side and I wish it looked nicer, overall one of the better pumpkin beers I've had this year though, all things considered."
""
""
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. It is smooth and easy drinking. Overall it is a pretty average pumpkin offering. I probably would not buy this again despite it's eye catching appeal on the shelf."
""
""
""
"Hazy deep amber/orange colour, ring of off white head, little lace as well. Smell is spicy with lots of distinct pumpkin flesh, caramel, nutmeg and a touch of cinnamon with a bit of a hop kick here as well. Taste is lots of pumpkin spice up front, cinnamon, clove, mid palate sweetness, followed by a delicious and welcomed caramel malty flavour that sort of cuts through the pumpkin spice. Lightly carbonated, medium body, good weight. Quite the nice pumpkin beer even at a point when I was growing tired of pumpkin beers, flavourful and quite drinkable but due to pice point and bottle size I don't think me and this beer will be crossing paths again."
""
""
"Light body, medium to low carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Hazy burnt orange colour with red highlights. Pale beige head is large and tightly formed, but not very retentive. Patchy lace. Malty brown sugar aroma with pumpkin, orange zest, and spice notes. Toasted malt up-front followed closely by a vegetal note from the pumpkin puree and a melange of spices. Nutmeg and cinnamon are more prominent than clove. A nutty character persists throughout. Almost medium bodied with moderate carbonation and a soft, gentle mouthfeel. The pumpkin and spice character is strong enough to be easily noticed, but restrained enough to allow the base malt character of the beer to shine through. There is some sweetness to it, but not a whole lot. It certainly isn't Pumking. An extremely well balanced take on a style that many find either overpowering or underflavored. This one finds the middle ground."
"still not loving the style but this was a valiant effort and you can taste it, not for me but worth trying as it really does have some stellar points"
"Overall: I think these beer goes up in the honor of pumpkins, it isn't as strong as some of the better ones but it is ridiculously full of flavor. I would mark this maybe as my number four when it comes to pumpkins which says A LOT, drink up and respect...Salud!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's pumpkin, it's beer, it's sex in your mouth. This is one of the best pumpkin beers I've had. Need I say more? It's not too much of a beer trying to be a pumpkin, it's not too much a pumpkin trying to be a beer. It's what I want in a pumpking beer."
""
""
""
"Dark amber colored with a moderate amount of carbonation. Aromas of malty pumpkin and spice. Taste is where this beer shines. Pumpkin, cinnamon, all-spice flavors very balanced. Mouthfeel is just right not too heavy not too light. One of the best pumpkin ales. Rogue got this right!"
"I'd say trying this is a must try if you dig seasonals and of course pumpkin in beer. Thanksgiving is today for this tasting and i couldnt think of a better time to sample this style. Everything for my liking was fine about this brew and despite the metallic impression i had at first; this sure is tasting good as it warms. Well made. I'd enjoy pumpkin flavored beers even more as a big thick imperial stout."
""
""
"O: I liked this beer because the taste was all about the pumpkins and had a bit of sweetness to make things more palatable and some hints of spices to add complexity."
""
""
""
""
"Would I buy it again? Yes. It was a very good pumpkin beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Probably my new favorite pumpkin beer, although it is a bit pricey."
""
""
"Overall, this is nice pumpkin ale, and perhaps a good introduction to the style for many. But I found the complexity and potency of the ale to lack somewhat, and the flavors (as well as the mouthfeel) to be overly watery. A measure or two more of ingredients, resulting in, among other details, a higher ABV, would have done this beer wonders."
""
""
""
"Pours a dark amber color with hints of orange present and a two finger slightly off white head. The head leaves some lines of lace up and down the glass. The aroma is of fresh pumpkin, there are also hints of cinnomon, nutmeg, and all spice, with a slight hint of dark fruits. The taste follows suit, it is slightly thin up front for a second but then gives you a nice pumpkin flavor, there then hints of vanilla, cinnomon, and others spices, with a hint of a wet hop. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated. Overall this is a very solid pumpkin beer, it is up there with best in class for this style."
"Pours deep mahogany/amber with orange hues and a white head that settles out to about 1 cm. Nose is pumpkin, a hint of cinnamon, nutmeg, some caramel, brown sugar, a little bit of raisin and fig and a bit more pumpkin. Most pumpkin ales smell mostly like spices but this one really smells like straight up pumpkin. The taste is more spiced than the smell. Nutmeg, allspice, cinnamon, pumpkin, caramel malts, brown sugar, molasses and raisins. Dogfish Head Punkin Ale has always been my favorite pumpkin beer but this year two have given it a run for its money, Epic Imperial Pumpkin Porter and this bad boy. I will be looking forward to this every year now. I hope I can get one more this year too. Rogue's Chatoe line has been pretty impressive."
""
"Overall - Great, great pumpkin ale. In terms of beer, it's no world beater, but it's far and away the best pumpkin brew I've tried to date. Is it worth the price? Probably not, but I'm of the firm belief that very few bombers are worth more than $7."
"An alright pumpkin ale but would never buy this again, there's several better for less money"
"O: Again, this is like a spiced pumpkin Oktoberfest. I'm glad I picked this one up, a great fall time ale."
"O-A lighter pumpkin ale and one with decent flavor, but not as complex or concentrated as the better pumpkin beers out there, e.g., DFH or Elysian. Perhaps a little more ABV would help out here."
""
""
"This beer poured out as a nice looking brown color with some red and orange hues to it. The head was white and kept a solid retention from start to finish. The smell of the beer has the traditional spiced and earthy aromas of most pumpkin ales. The taste of the beer is similar to the nose, it's got a good amount of spice in there without overpowering the other elements of the beer. The mouthfeel of the beer is light to medium bodied... similar to most of Rogue's ale in my opinion. The carbonation was good and the beer was drinkable. Overall it's a decent pumpkin ale."
"O: Easy to drink as this beer is very well balanced - not too sweet and not overly bitter either. Very enjoyable with great natural pumpkin flavors balanced with the pumpkin pie spices. This is a really nice beer and one I will be on the lookout for next year."
"O - Satisfying enough, and for people that are more into the basic pumpkin ale, this beer is great. Nice pumpkin notes, but I still feel pumpkin ale is better with a little additional sweetness."
"http://www.facebook.com/KAJIIsBeerReviews"
"O: This a pretty good pumpkin beer with tons of flavor. I find this to be an easy beer to drink and would for sure buy this again."
""
""
"A good but not great pumpkin ale. The amber base takes on too much of a presence for my liking and the traditional pumpkin pie spices don't shine through enough in the taste."
"The beer pours a dark brown color with an off-white head. The aroma is full of cinnamon and a bit of nutmeg. I also get some other assorted spice notes, as well as some toffee. The flavor is more of the same. I get some pumpkin and caramel/toffee notes, as well as a good bit of spice. I get a bit of cinnamon, nutmeg and clove notes, with a hint of allspice mixed in. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
""
""
"Pours an orangish color with a frothy white head - one of the better looking pumpkin ales I have seen. Nose is ghordish cookie malt with a little bit of spicy nutmeg. The taste opens up with caramel malts, which move into some cookie malt flavors. A touch of spices move in, most notably nutmeg and close, to finish this off. The mouthfeel is smooth and full bodied. Overall, this is a good pumpkin ale; a nice balance of spice and pumpkin malts give it a profile that so many pumpkin ales try to achieve."
"Overall, an OK pumpkin beer."

"Tastes like an *excellent* pumpkin ale. Roasted, almost lightly burned spice up front, moving into fresher, sugary-er spice in the middle (more pie-like) with big nodes of cinnamon and nutmeg. This segues gently into the most pumpkiny pumpkin nodes I've ever come across in a beer--it's like fresh, seasoned puree. Really great stuff. The flavor ends with a resurgence of vanilla along with more fresh pumpkin, and blended with an exceptionally creamy body the effect is quite similar to spritzing some Readi-Whip on top of a slice of pie."
"D - One of the better pumpkins I have tried."

"O: Pretty tasty but also pretty run of the mill. Doesn't do anything special but it doesn't do anything wrong either."

"The taste doesn't quite live up to the smell. It's good and tasty; lighter with the pumpkin and spices than I hoped for but still a very good example of the style. A decently low abv to make it an easy drinker. I like."

"Love the GYO series by Rogue. This ones a bit overpriced but so enjoyable it's almost worth it. ...but lets be honest - this is really a $7. beer wrapped up in a $12. price tag."
"Overall: this is a very good beer for the style. the flavors are all there that you want without any off putting notes."
"D - This is a much better than average pumpkin beer, with a great spice profile. The malt gives the beer a pie crust note that I have only otherwise experienced in pumking before. I don't want a lot of it, but it is much more drinkable than most."

"You must purchase the beer first and foremost to understand it, Rogue did a great job and I will be trying more of their beer shortly."

"O: One of the best pumpkin beers I've tried. Very delicious and nicely balanced. Thanks Rogue"
""
"Pours a lovely orange-brown with a soapy off-white head that fades to a patchy haze. Nice aromas of fresh pumpkin,cinnamon, brown sugar, nutmeg, and sweet malt. Reminds me quite a bit of Weyerbacher's Pumpkin offering. Taste is equally nice, more sweet malt, brown sugar, and caramel with authentic pumpkin, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Really drinkable, excellent pumpkin beer. Smooth mouthfeel, a bit crisp, with a medium body and good carbonation. Really great Pumpkin Ale, I'm impressed highly!"

"The master brewers at Rogue finally puts together a home grown beer from home grown products that lives up to expectations- and doing so in a type of beer that rarely gets it right."
""
"Overall: Holy crap Rogue just may have made one of the best pumpkin beers out there."
""
"Overall: This is a nice pumpkin beer if you like pumpkin and not pie spice. Nice balance and very easy to drink. I'd have another."
""

"Over priced and average overall."
"Overall: A half step above the average pumpkin ale, though at nearly two steps beyond the average pumpkin ale in price."

"Bubbly head that doesn't really even lace. Feels like an amber"
"O - Not gimmicky. This is what a pumpkin beer should taste like."
"Lively dark ruby red topped by a frantic beige head that settles down quickly. Strong aroma that is more fierce than satisfying: overspiced with cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, clove, and subtle vanilla. Flavors of cooked pumpkin, burnt pie crust, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, clove, acidic vanilla, mild spicy hop presence towards the finish. Medium bodied with medium carbonation. Prickly feeling. I expect better from Rogue. The beer could use less emphasis on the spices and bring in a heftier, creamier body. Diggin' the cooked pumpkins, the vanilla, and the hops but the ginger and clove could be tossed to the side."
"750 ml bottle, 2012 vintage in the orange bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a copper/orange color with about an inch light tan head. Head retention is good, and there's a small amount of lacing. The aroma is nice, it smells like pumpkins, nutmeg, cinnamon, and a bit of ginger. Nice balance between the pumpkin and spices in the aroma. Taste is similar to the aroma, but the flavor seems to be more pumpkiny than spicy although the spices are noticeable. The taste reminds me of eating pumpkin bread. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy and slick with moderate carbonation. I think this is a good overall pumpkin ale. A bit pricey at $9.99 a bottle so I probably wouldn't pick this one up very often, but it's definitely worth trying."

"O-it's an okay pumpkin ale. I respect they use their own grown ingredients. It's adds some respect. Other than that, this is maybe just a little better than average. I would only put it down a few notches from punkin and Pumking, but for the price...that means ill never get it again."
"Poured into an imperial nonic a deep pumpkin orange with a billowing sticky one and a half finger slightly off white head atop.Aromas mainly of vanilla and roasted pumpkin,not overly spiced wich is good.Not sweet at all on the palate,one of the dryer pumpkin ales I have had.Roasted pumpkin,vanilla,light pumkin pie spice,and a almost earthy finish.This is a top notch pumpkin beer,it has the pumpkin flavor,a little spice,but a drying finish wich makes it very drinkable for the style.Well done by Rogue here."

"3.5 D: Good pumpkin flavor in this, but nothing else is any better than the ordinary, which seems to be a theme when it comes to pumpkin beers."
"Rating it against the other pumpkin beers available, this is right up there. What it lacks in ABV, it makes up for in flavor. Great balanced beer...which is hard to do with such strong spices."
""
"O - I was disappointed with this one honestly. I was just expecting more of a pumpkin forward brew, with the spices taking the backseat. Not the other way around."

"one of the better pumpkin beers of this fall for me. appearance is attractive, right out of the orange bottle and into a tulip. its pale orangey brown in color, a little hazy, and boasts an incredibly active tan head with solid retention. the nose screams pumpkin ale. tons of spice, but an interestign blend. cumin maybe, not too much cinnamon, and the usual clove, nutmeg, allspice suspects. the taste features the pumpkin itself more than the nose. its earthy and flavorful, buttery in texture. i appreciate that this is a spicy pumpkin beer, but does not have much sweetness to it. that turns me off to a lot of these, but this one mixes pumpkin and spice perfectly, without an overdose of molasses, brown sugar, maple syrup, or anything else. great carbonation and a drinkably medium body. a perfect fall beer really. i wish it was more widely available, as ive only seen it in a few shops around town. yummy stuff."

"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a dark pumpkin amber with a nice one finger light tan head with great retention and lacing. Aroma of sweet malt, pumpkin and pie spices; cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves. Flavor is dominated by pleasant pie spices, particularly cinnamon. Light sweet malt and pumpkin. Finishes a bit dry with light hops. Pumpkin flavor carries over only slightly into the finish. Medium bodied. A decent pumpkin pie flavor, but unbalanced in favor of spicing, could use some more malt and pumpkin body. Enjoyed it and glad I tried it, but in the middle of pumpkin beer Nirvana (Great Pumpkin, Dark O' The Moon and Night Owl, as well as access to Pumking and Treat) I probably won't revisit this one.."
"The pour is a slightly hazed burnt orange color with a white head. Strong spice aroma, as expected. Heavy on the nutmeg, cinnamon, and all spice notes. Sweet bread malt with a bit of toffee and biscuit. The flavor is dominated by the spices. A touch of vanilla to go along with the nutmeg and all spice. A nice malty sweetness and good body to go with it. I quite enjoyed this."
""
"Pumpkin Patch Ale poured a darker golden color, with a small lacing head. The smell was complex, with hints of nutmeg, cinnamon and pumpkin. The taste was mellow, had many notes of the nutmeg mixing with the pumpkin. Was easier to drink, but was on the lighter side. Overall a good pumpkin beer, but just a bit weak in the overall flavor."

"Overall: One of the better of the Rogue beers, in my opinion. Wasn't sure of what to make of it, especially the way pumpkin beers are treated, but Rogue did one heck of gourd job with this ale. I will come back to this again when avaliabe and over some other pumpkin beers that line my local beer shelves."

"This beer poured an appropriate burnt orange color, hazy, with a soapy tannish head that receded to a bubbly ringlet. Typical aroma of pumpkin and autumn spices. Taste of pumpkin pie, though pretty balanced between sweet and vegetal, with spicy hints of cinnamon, clove and nutmeg, maybe a touch of vanilla bean. Some bittering from hops and pumpkin skin in the finish. Medium mouthfeel; a fine drink overall."
""
"O - This beer is pretty good and easy to drink but not sure it would be something that I felt I needed to get my hands on. It's definitely better than most other pumpkin beers out there."
""
"O: A solid pumpkin beer. I don't know why it showed up in December, but I'm glad to try another one of the style."
""
""
"O - I gotta say this is probably the most pumpkin pie like flavored Pumpkin Ale Iv'e ever had. The flavor profile is intensely pie like, which was great to me but it sorta falls flat towards the finish, and gives off a sorta watered down like flavor. The mouthfeel could be fuller as well, to me anyway. All in all though it's pretty good, and I like that it's not sickeningly sweet and boozy, so it makes for a session Pumpkin Ale. I would say give it a try, but I probably wouldn't buy this one again."
"Drinkable, somewhat flavorful but not really that great."
"pretty well suited for the first day of December, like many Rogue brews its not cheap and that may be the only thing preventing me from buying another"

"overall: I had the choice between this and the chatoe pilsner, and i'm glad i chose this! It's a great pumpkin ale, and I feel safe saying so even though i've only had a few others. Most interesting to me is that they grow all the ingredients in this brew on location at their farm. I actually do feel i get a sense of location from this beer, it doesn't seem out of character for an Oregon beer at all. Rogue, keep it up! Can't wait to try more chatoe beers!"

"Perfect today on Thanksgiving. I am thankful to live somewhere that lets me try amazing beers"
"Well done Rogue, you've won me back with this one. An enjoyable Pumpkin ale that hits all the right notes for the style, no flaws, just tasty goodness. I shall be stocking up while I can."
"Overall, this is not a big in your face pumpkin beer, but if you like something like DFH Punkin, this will certainly please the palate."

"Overall- A good attempt at a pumpkin ale by Rogue. Could use more pumpkin to balance the spices and strong hop flavour. Other than that a decent brew. Worth trying."
"A decent enough pumpkin (pie-adjacent) ale, all of the associated ticks are duly nailed, and recorded now for posterity. I could, however, stand just a bit more (or any) proper hop bitterness spread around - that would help with the whole beer vs. dessert conflict currently mucking up my consciousness."
"Some good things to take from this sampling..I really like the flavour as they were a fresh take on this style. This beer falls flat, literally, with it's carbonation. Too agressive in front, not enough in the finale."
"O - what I like about this is that neither the pumpkin or the spice angle dominate as is often the case with pumpkin ales, each have their own moderate presence that works well with the malty backbone, a very nice offering in this category"
