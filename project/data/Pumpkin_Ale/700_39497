3.74,-5.1,4,3.75,3.75,4,3.5,"Pours a handsome pitch black with a mocha or chocolate colored head of creamy foam that lasts and adorns the glass. The nose is cinnamon and nutmeg. A faint bit of allspice and a light fragrant ginger to really perk up the nose. The malt on the nose is roasty but biscuity too. Creamy and smooth smelling even on the nose. There is a faint bit of light chocolate and that is a surprise.  Pumpkin scent is hard to find but it's there.  taste is heavy with cinnamon.  The body is creamy adn the malt is impeccable. The roast is deep and flows freely. At the back palate there is a slight bitter from that roast that is so lovely.  The spices are all there but I wish I could taste more pumpkin.  Cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg, clove and ginger.  The chocolate flavor seems to smooth out this beer without really taking center stage. The mouthfeel is creamy and silken.  There should not be any alcohol on this palate at only 6.5 percent but there is a twinge of it in the finish. There is a slight hop bitterness that takes the tongue for a brief moment before this one finishes dry and with that lovely dry pie crust to linger and that very dominant cinnamon.","utopiajane","0"

4.13,4.8,3.5,4.75,4,3.75,4,"Overall:   So how does this stack up against the other Elysian pumkpin beers (except for Owl, which I have not yet tried)?  I was disappointed by The Great Pumpkin, which I thought was too bitter, boozy, and had an artificial and chemical-like flavor to it.  Dark O' is smooth and natural.  The characteristics are different from Punkuccino, but I feel this beer is equally as strong for its own reasons.  Both noses are highly spicy.  Dark O' provides a burst of cinnamon, while Punku has a broader fall spice profile including nutmeg, allspice, and of course, coffee.  This is a great stout, with warming characteristics brought out by the up front notes of cinnamon.  One of the more unique pumpkin ales I have had that manages to balance spice nicely with a solid stout base.","antott0523","Sep 28, 2014"

Lots of lace and good retention. Superior aromatics bring copious amounts of chocolate and coffee as well as a thick slice of pie topped with cinnamon. The taste is much the same. It's like drinking pie and mocha together. The finish brings a graham cracker crust and earthy hop bitterness that evokes a rich cup of coffee. Not an sweet beer overall and highly sessionable. Feel is perfectly weighted with a light supple caressing of the mouth and tongue. Smoothly carbonated with just enough liveliness. This drinks like a dry Irish stout. Great beer and one to seek out often.","scootny","Dec 11, 2013"

I've tried a lot of different pumpkin beers this season (and several others from Elysian) and this is the one I was looking for. The feel is thick without being syrupy, the carbonation is pleasing, and the color is a deep dark autumnal red-brown. After the first few sips the malt and cinnamon dominate the palette until the beer warms up and the pumpkin shines through once more. Great ride and a great finish.

4.12,4.6,4,4.5,4,4,4,"22 ounce bottle into pint glass, 2013 release. Pours nearly opaque black color with a 2 finger dense tan head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big pumpkin, cinnamon, clove, gingerbread, raisin bread, toast, chocolate, cocoa, light roast, dark bread, and toasted earthiness. Incredible aromas with great balance and complexity of pumpkin, spice, and bready/roasted malt notes; with good strength. Taste of pumpkin, cinnamon, milk chocolate, cocoa, gingerbread, clove, raisin bread, toast, light roast, dark bread, and toasted earthiness. Minimal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of pumpkin, cinnamon, gingerbread, clove, raisin bread, toast, milk chocolate, cocoa, light roast, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance, complexity, and robustness of pumpkin, spice, and dark/roasted malt flavors; with a nice malt/spice balance and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a moderately creamy and smooth mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent pumpkin stout. All around great complexity and balance of pumpkin, spice, and malt flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Oct 17, 2013"

Label is awesome, but at 6-something abv don't expect to be turning into a werewolf after drinking it or anything, just a nice, warming stout. Pours black with a cocoa colored head and looks quite tantalizing. Nose gives off a lot of cinnamon and cocoa. Taste is REALLY smoky; wife said it was like drinking a cigar and I said it was like licking an ash tray. Other than that you get cinnamon, and if the pumpkin is in there anywhere (which I'm sure it is), it really takes a back seat to the spice and smoke, which is just all up in your palate. Overall I actually liked it as a seasonal stout and found the flavor really intriguing, but would probably opt for some Night Owl or Great Pumpkin in place of this one if looking for a pumpkin beer. Also didn't think this warranted the ten dollar price tag, but still glad I got to try it.","BeerWizard","Sep 10, 2013"

But what really jumped out at me was the pumpkin flavour: this wasn't some tame or demure pumpkin pie overtone, this was a smash of fresh pumpkin with a sprinkling of vibrant cinnamon! I'm rarely impressed by pumpkin flavour, I tend to judge the pumpkin beers more harshly than others. I'm pretty picky when it comes down to the balance of spices, and the texture of the pumpkin. The reason this one stood out to me was the freshness; the flavour seemed to jump out of the glass, as if it had just been brewed this morning. And I don't mean it was raw or harsh, it was still smooth and creamy but with a liveliness that was new to me.

Very one-dimensional with hardly any pumpkin flavor to speak of. I would have never guessed that there was any in there, it just tastes like a spicy, overly roasted stout.

4.37,10.9,3.5,4,4.5,5,4.5,"Dark O' the Moon is a strong Pumpkin Stout. Although I classified it as a pumpkin ale, it is actually more of a robust strong stout brewed with pumpkin and pumpkin spices. The pumpkin spices are not overly strong, and shine through more in the background of the beer creating a nice twist in this delicious stout. The Elysian seems to shine with its pumpkin style brews so I thought I'd better try this one before it is gone for good. Looked black as most stouts with aromas of coffee, cocoa, some cinnamon and cloves. The taste was roasty and deep with dark chocolate and cloves followed by sour dark cherries and nutmeg and finishing with ripe pumpkin meat. A very interesting concept for a beer and an excellent fusion of a pumpkin ale and a strong stout. Surprised I haven't seen a pumpkin stout before now. Try it on tap before it's gone. I was informed they probably won't be bottling it.","jletts","0"
