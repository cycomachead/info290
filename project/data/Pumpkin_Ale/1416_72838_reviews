"Amber to copper in color with moderate head and lacing.  Smell is cinnamon, nutmeg, pumpkin, sugar, wood, and maybe vanilla. Taste is a boozy pumpkin pie with notes of vanilla, spice, and some bitters. Mouthful is a bit oily but light to medium with medium carbonation.  Overall one of my favorite pumpkin beers."

"Aging this was not a good idea. I should have just consumed it when I bought it."
"4.0 D:  Really good beer.  Love pumpkin beers."

"Bottle date of 8/21/2013.  Sampled on 8/24/2014."
"Overall: very good beer and definitely took me by surprise. I have two absolute favorites in pumpkin ales, this one has reached my top five. Tasty and powerful and paired desser even better. Salad!"
"Feel: harsh with all 10.3% evident."

""
""
"Malty aroma has a firm pumpkin tone and some cinnamon, plus an undertone of oak. Pours a slightly hazy sienna with a light buff head. Flavor has an oaky overtone plus notes of pumpkin, cinnamon, malt and caramel. Lively, fizzy texture has a decent amount of body. A bit spendy, but tasty and enjoyable."

"The aftertaste is dry and oak. I recommend this beer to try, but probably won't be buying it again."
"Beautiful clear brown/amber pour with thin tan head. Aromas of caramell and spice. Very malty with the brewer-stated hints of bourbon. Not much flavor of the pumpkin spice, but extrememely smooth sipping and mouthfeel."
""
"Hazy orange-mahogany pour with a one finger beige head with decent retention and great lacing.  The nose is a complex blend of spices including cinnamon, nutmeg, black pepper, clove, along with hints of molasses, vanilla, and subtle dark fruits.  The taste is extremely rich and bold with the barrel aging really coming through.  Hints of cinnamon, maple, toffee, nutmeg, clove, oak, vanilla, booze, white pepper, and caramel.  The mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation and a boozey, dry, oaky finish.  Overall, this is one big and boozey pumpkin beer.  The barrel aging dominates, and it's extremely rich, making it a sipper for sure.  It was a bit boozey for me so I'm going to put the other bottle I have in the cellar and see what happens."
""
"The first thing I noticed was the scent you get from aging an ale in oak barrels -  which generally correlates to a tasty beer. This was again the case - even flavors all around - the spices, the pumpkin and oak barrels. A dark brown color, with very little opacity. Feels nice - a perfect amount of carbonation with a very light head. It's late in the season, however, I can say this is my favorite pumpkin beer, especially at 10.31%. Snag it if you have the chance or try it next fall."

"The beautiful taste that suggests pumpkin pie taste in beer form finishes differently- it dries to a mid-sweet term with spicy heat and spice from dry oak, spice additions and elevated alcohol heat. What transpires afterward is a taste of rum cake, chestnut and port wine.  As palate fatigue would normally accompany such taste, I'm wishing for more of this pumpkin ale and blue cheese pairing."
""
"Pours a mahogany red with a nice head.   Smells of plum, alcohol, caramel.  Tastes kind of like a light barleywine, some sweetness, a little tart, I get some vanilla and then the pumpkin spices show up in the finish.   There's a pretty good alcohol presence and some burn.   Kind of full bodied, maybe a little too much carbonation, seems like there's a little CO2 burn.   Overall, good brew, might be better with a little age on it."

"Voluminous three plus fingers worth of khaki colored light airy whimsical frothy goodness comprised of lots of big chunky bubbles...  The color is a deep dark slightly brooding caramelly amber...  A light to moderate bit of rapid paced carbonation streaks throughout...  Some carbonation bubbles cling to the sides of the glass...  The oak and wood notes are at the forefront of the aroma without being overpowering...  Some light pumpkin and baked squash notes linger beneath the surface and add nice depth and complexity...  Somewhat one dimensional in terms of aroma, but very pleasant and enticing...  The trend continues on the palate where the oak aging is again at the forefront...  Way beneath the surface are some pumpkin mash notes and light caramel /toffee notes...  There is a distinct booziness that lingers about as well...  Some very light vanilla notes as well...  Lots of depth and complexity is present but it is somewhat obscured by the oak and wood notes...  The mouthfeel is medium bodied and sturdy...  Assertive throughout with some spry carbonation...  Nice and smooth...  Overall a very nice beer even if the pumpkin notes get obscured a bit throughout...  A delicious beer, but not necessarily an exception fall seasonal if that makes any sense..."

"Fills the glass with a rich reddish amber hue and a thick and frothy head. Lots of pumpkin and spice right up front on the nose. A bit of woody vanilla in there as well.  Taste reveals a nice balance of gourdy pumpking and cinnamon and nutmeg. Oaky and malty as well, with little to no hop presence."

"This pours a dark amber brown color with a foamy beige head. The aroma is fairly bold with hints of pumpkin and spice. The taste is heavy and bold. The barrel aging really adds depth and complexity. The oak flavors really shine thru in the taste. Definitely worth a try."

"Pours a four finger off-white head that fades slowly some lace. Deep amber color. Medium carbonation and medium bodied.  Nutmeg, clove and cinnamon nose and flavor is pumpkin pie on steroids, oak is noticeable, high ABV is not. Nice imperial pumpkin.  Pricey at $13.99 for a 750ml bottle from Julio's Liquors Westborough, Ma."

"750 ml caged and corked bottle, bottled on 09/18/13. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours a mostly clear reddish/orange color with about an inch tan head. Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is nice, the brew smells mostly like pumpkin and pumpkin spices, along with some light vanilla and oak. It tastes like pumpkin spices (cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice), pumpkin, vanilla, oak, and a bit of booze and butterscotch. It's not an overspiced pumpkin beer, so in this case it helps the brew. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's chewy and coating with a good amount of carbonation. I think it's a good pumpkin ale, I'd try it again in the future. $11.99 a bottle."

"Poured from a 750mL bottle, into a Petrus chalice."
""
""
"Poured from a cork and cage into a snifter, the beer is a vibrant, dark, ruby-orange coloring with a tall, frothy, creamy, off-white head. Aromas of pumpkin, oak, vanilla, cinnamon, sugar, nutmeg, and booze. Heavy nose. Flavors are rich and spiced forward, with pumpkin heaviness and boozy highlights. Wow, this is rich and robust. After the blast of heaping pumpkin, there is a spice blend build that cuts all the rich layers to provide some levity. The palate actually lightens rapidly after all that initial massiveness, leading into a mostly balanced sweet, rich, and spicy pumpkin bread aftertaste, with booze and vanilla overtones. The body is robust, slick, and heavy. Slick, lingering spice finish. This beer is massive."
""
""

""

""

""

"The taste is definitely strong with more of a pumpkin spice character than the nose implies with a definite dark malt and licorice feel too. It does make my head spin a little so take this one easy. One I will remember."
"O - Decent use of pumpkin and oak together, probably my favorite oak pumpkin ale."
""
"Would have again, but perhaps in a small quantity."
"Poured into a 16 oz snifter, bottled on 9/18/13. Pours a dark brownish amber with s two inch off white head that, leaves behind traces of lace. Smell is pumpkin, nutmeg, cinnamon, clove, and vanilla. Taste is largely alcoholic, pumpkin spice, nutmeg, and cinnamon vanilla in the finish. Body is maybe medium, plenty of life, a little dry, and a sipper for sure. This is a huge imperial pumpkin ale, that drinks as you would expect, like a fine pumpkin ale that really leaves it mark!"
""
""
""
"O - Nicely done beer. Very complex. Good use of pumpkin and oak together. Looking foward to getting this one again enxt year!"
""
""
""
""
"Poured a reddish brown (mahogny, leather couch brown) with solid one finger head that left lace ring down glass. Aroma and taste seem to have the same charateristics: pumpkin and nutmeg, hint of cinnamon, oaky/woodiness, touch of caramel malt and booze. I liked how smooth the beer is, how heavy the pumpkin and other spices come into play and the sweetness I get on some sips. The only thing with this beer is at times the alcohol really came into play and I don't think the booziness mixed well with the pumpkin spices or the sweetness so at times it was disjointed."
"O: The base beer is nice and not too spiced, and then the oak barrels add a nice bit of complexity. Doesn't go overboard on either aspect, which is quite an accomplishment. A great sipper for Halloween and the fall season, if I do say so myself"
""
""
"I wonder how technical they got to get the abv to exactly 10.31? If it's true, that's incredible. Deep amber hue with an off white head. This is quite complex and just a touch too boozy for me, but it somehow fits the style. A lot of cinnamon, booze, vanilla, pumpkin flesh, caramel malt and oak in that order from most prominent."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Taste - Massive fruity overtones of plums and dates. Strong pumpkin puree, oak, vanilla, slight pines and a continuous juicy pumpkin cream flavor throughout the palate. The finish brings a resinous creamy, milk, sweet yeast and sugar, slick syrupy pumpkin molasses. Overall, this beer is massively complex. There is the vanilla/oak overtones from the barrels and the strong pumpkin overtones work well with that. This is a really fantastic imperial pumpkin ales. Among the best of the style."

"I'll admit, most pumpkin beers in the past never lived up to my expectations but with a bigger push for the Imperial Pumpkin ales I am all over it. Of course they still have to be balanced and the spicing can't be out of control the least bit. Uinta does a stellar job with this one."
""
"Cheers!!!"
""
""
""
""
"Much smoother and tame as I suspected. Warm vanilla and brown sugar came through. Tasted much like a strong English Barleywine. This could still go a couple more years and probably be even better. Still, the booziness (although still there) was much less than when it was fresh. I enjoyed this...but back to my original review from a year ago. It's lacking on the pumpkin!"
"I like the complexity in the flavor and I think the strength of the beer works nicely with the flavors they present. The pumpkin aspect is a bit overshadowed by this strength but all in all a brew I would recommend trying to anyone. Spices are also in check which is key, too many abuse that."
""
"Whoa, big beer! Poured slightly warm with a giant tan, slow to settle, thick, foamy head and good lacing. Color is a clear, deep amber with few bubble trails. Aroma is oaked pumpkin, malt, spice, hops. Flavor's like nose with everything much more bold. Sweet and tang are out front and bitter brings up a strong, long lasting end. Body is full round, alcohol warm with just enough bitter to keep it interesting. Finish is like flavor and as stated above. Rich, so one big bottle is plenty."
""
"O: A beer pumpkin with the spice and oak notes giving a sort of Belgian Ale impression. There is a noticeable amount of alcohol but it's kept in check with by a fair amount of malt sweetness and body."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The wood/oak characteristics definitely dominate, so if you're a fan of that then you'll definitely love this. The oak barrels definitely take this beer to the next level. Without them, this would just be your average Imperial Pumpkin Ale. It's ultimately an interesting take on the style. I guess I don't like it as much as I wanted to, but it's not bad at all and I can totally appreciate it and see the appeal. It is complex too. I probably should've let this one age a bit. Some age would definitely turn this beer into something else, most likely for the better."

"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 9/6/2012. Pours lightly hazy deep ruby red color with a 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of huge caramel, toffee, pumpkin, cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, toast, brown sugar, gingerbread, oak, vanilla, bourbon, light chocolate, light roast, and toasted earthiness. Incredible aromas with great balance and complexity of malt, spice, pumpkin, and barrel notes; with great strength. Taste of big caramel, toffee, pumpkin, cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, toast, brown sugar, gingerbread, oak, bourbon, vanilla, chocolate, and toasted earthiness. Lingering notes of caramel, toffee, pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, toast, brown sugar, gingerbread, oak, bourbon, vanilla, light chocolate, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity of malt, pumpkin, spice, and barrel flavors; with a near perfect balance of all flavors and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a moderately creamy, slick, and slightly syrupy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic barrel aged pumpkin ale! All around awesome balance and complexity of malt, spice, pumpkin, and barrel flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering."
""
"I poured it into a glass, it has a dark red color body with a thick tan head that hangs out for a while. The smell has a strong malt aroma with some spice coming through. The taste is very sweet and malty up front, strong boozy flavor comes next, i don't get any pumpkin or spice flavor. The mouth feel is a little heavy and overall a ok beer, i don't think i would let it age again. I think it would be better fresh."
""
"O - I found this beer in my cellar, leftover from last year's pumpkin season. I had no intention of aging it for a year, I just forgot about it. The emergence of pumpkin beers on the shelf once again jogged my memory. This one was pretty good, but I expected more from an oak aged pumpkin beer retailing for $12-14. The usual pumpkin flavors are there, along with a sweet caramel/marshmallow character, but I don't think this is any better than a lot of the readily available Imperial pumpkin offerings that cost around half as much (Weyerbacher, Schlafly, Pumking, etc.)."

"O: This is very enjoyable brew and is a little different (in a positive way) from the other pumpkin beers that I have experienced...really like the contribution of the oak and what it imparted to the flavor and aroma. I wish that the alcohol had been a little subtle in this one, it made the beer very much a slow sipper."
""

"D/O: This strong pumpkin ale is a pleasure to behold; it strikes a near-perfect stance incorporating attention to the signature ingredient, a mature application of wood-aging, and enduring awareness that this is a beer. It remains capable of being enjoyed as beer, with a clear attention to details exhibited by the brewer. Hard to find fault with; perhaps its greatest transgression is that it remains a beer brewed with pumpkin..."
"O - A awesome pumpkin beer. Gorgeous looks, great flavor profile with an excellent pumpkin character front and center, and stellar balance."
"Overall: I decided to take on this 750ml all by myself, just to make sure I had enough. WAIT I RAN OUT ALREADY. It's fairly good, but I would still lean toward Pumking, as this came across as a wee bit hot for me."
"Medium in body, sweet throughout the palate, surprisingly a lot of pumpkin comes through in the flavor. Mildly enjoyable beer, good oakiness and barrel notes, minimal spice. It is a decent beer and I'd consider having it again."
""
""
"O - It's a good pumpkin ale that has just the right amount of oak and bourbon without being overly boozy, this one works well."
"Poured from bomber into tulip glass. Pours clear reddish amber with a medium orange-tan head that slowly dissipates with nice lacing. Aroma has that telltale pumpkin ale note, with allspice, cinnamon, bit of clove. Flavor is the same, lightly sweet, lightly bitter, notes of wood. Body is medium, carbonation is medium. Light astringence in the mouth, but that fades after a few minutes of sitting. Well balanced, not overpowering in the spice notes like so many pumpkin ales. Overall, a solid pumpkin ale for the oak aged lover."

"D- The rich malt blends well with barrel and spice. There are nice barleywine characters, barrel characters and some spice notes that are all well balanced to work together to battle the winter chill."

"O- beyond different that's any other pumpkin ale that I've had, very complex and surprisingly drinkable at 10.31%. It is quite sweet, so this bottle would be great to share. Overall very good."
"M - Medium, almost full body. Creamy and thick. Light carbonation. An absolutely perfect mouth feel."

""
""
""
"te head and decent lacing. Typical aromas of pumpkin, nutmeg, and spices are met with hints of oak and cinnamon. Bready malts and pumpkin dominate on the pallet and are well highlighted with the background flavors of spice, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Alcohol content is very well hidden and this beer goes down incredibly smooth. Lower levels of carbonation are met with a medium body in this BIG pumpkin ale. 'Tis the season..."
""
"Uinta's Oaked Jack pours a pretty clear ruby red, with some lighter cherry highlights. Three fingers worth of khaki colored foam comes together atop the beer.Head retention and lacing are both pretty good, though neither is quite great. The nose has some nice maple sweetness that's counterbalanced by the traditional cinnamon and nutmeg pumpkin pie spices. The flavor profile brings in some vanilla to support the maple in laying down a sweet base. The pumpkin spices show up well in the back end, and they're complemented nicely by some earthy, spicy oak notes. The mouthfeel is spot on. The body is firmly middle of the road for such a big beer, neither as full as a stout or barleywine, nor as dry as a strong Belgian ale, and the carbonation has just a little bit of zip to it. I've found that brewing a high ABV pumpkin ale is a bit of a challenge in terms of keeping both the sweetness and the spice character in check, and with the aid of oak aging, Uinta does an admirable job here."
""
""
""
""
"A decent pumpkin ale. I'm not a big fan of the oak aged here but if that's what you like give it a try. The oak I think added to a cloyingness that I didn't really care for."
""
""
""
""
"Poured in to NB Globe glass. Appearance is a clear dark orange with a generous amount of loose white head. Heavy lacing is left behind, nice head retention as well. Nose starts with pumpkin spices, predominantly all spice. Next is an onslaught of vanilla which is backed up by a bit of oak character. The barrel comes through and provides a slight twinge of mustiness. The end features some raw vegetal pumpkin notes. Taste is rather sweet with brown sugar and cinnamon among other pumpkin spices. The oak is incredibly mild on the palate, which is unfortunate. The mouthfeel is smooth with a hearty body and mild carbonation. Overall, this one falls a little short. The vanilla is nice but the pumpkin is somewhat bland and it seems that the oak doesn't do any favors for this brew."
"O: This one sounded better than it actually turned out to be...too much pumpkin is a bad thing for me."
""
""
""
""
"Would definitely repeat this one. One of the best pumpkin beers I've had."
"Drinkability isn't too high. It's a hot, fairly thin spicy beer. The oak is nice, and the ethanol is relatively clean, so it's not really flawed, it's just in need a of redesign - more malt, maybe some esters."
""
""
"D - This is a pretty decent pumpkin beer. The booziness takes away from this being a more drinkable pumpkin ale."
""
"O: I love Uinta's barrel aging program, and this beer does not disappoint. This is a big one, and seems to draw much inspiration from the barley wine style. The barrel aging is done right, with the oak character asserting itself without becoming too dominant. The spicing, while initially a bit disjointed and shocking, ended up melting away into the background to provide a nice supporting role. This is easily the heftiest pumpkin beer I've ever had. It's really hitting the spot right now, especially with the threat of hurricane Sandy looming. If you're going to spend a blustery autumn night sealed in at home, this is a great beer to have on hand."
"Poured into a chalice a nice deep reddish/amber color, nice carbonation, with a nice little fizzy off-white head, with some minimal sticky lacing left behind. The nose is mostly malty, with some nice cinammon, nutmeg, clove notes. The taste is malty, slightly bitter, pretty close to a pumpkin pie, very slight oak notes. Medium body, ABV hidden very well. Overall a pretty tasty brew for over a year old. This brew was very very hard to get in Utah, considering the fucking place is about 30 miles from my house. This is not the first time Uinta has fucked up getting brew's to people here in Utah/SLC. They seem to care more about getting beers outside of Utah for the last couple of years. Not very cool. Thanks Chuck for hooking me up!"
"The appearance is gorgeous. A deep amber orange color with one of the best heads I've experienced.... no, not like that. I think it's where the creaminess comes from. It puffs up a lot at first, and then remains throughout the pint. It's all really great."

"4O: Great pumpkin beer. From what I can tell, definitely one to drink fresh. From this bottle, recommended without reservation."
"Do yourself a favor and give it a try."
"O: I like Imperial pumpkin ales, and I've had a few - I enjoy the rich, strong, and bold pumpkin and spice, and i appreciate the addition of other flavors, like those imparted by the oak barrel-aging, so I happen to have really enjoyed this beer. It is more complex than a Pumking and not as light/bright-tasting as a Smashed Pumpkin; it reminded me of a lighter version of Heavy Seas' Great'er Pumpkin (which is bourbon barrel-aged, and has a heavier and sweeter, almost over-the-top, flavor). What I'm leading up to is that all of the aforementioned beers are my favorite Imperial pumpkin ales, and this beer gladly fits among them. It may even surpass some of them... Bottom-line: a must have for any fan of the style."
""
"O: One of the better, if not the best barrel aged pumpkin ales (though, how many have I really had I guess?). Nice balance of flavors. Pumpkin spices aren't too overpowering and neither is the bourbon. It all just works together pretty well."
""
"Not sure how well the oak barrels were utilized here but it's a cool beer overall - a nice change up from the spices-in-your-face pumpkin ales. Definitely a sipper."
""
""
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation being a little above average. Overall, I really liked it. I especially liked that it wasn't another over spiced pumpkin beer. It tasted like someone sprinkled brown sugar on a pumpkin and roasted it with some oak wood. Very enjoyable beer overall and I really appreciated that it was different from the other pumpkin beers out there."
"Pours a leaves changing colors autumn red with a thin cap of light tan foam. Partial head retention. Aroma is reminiscent of pumpkin pie with a heavy dose of nutmeg, yam, and a dash of cardamom. More pumpkin pie spiciness coming through in the flavor, meshing well with a toasted oak/vanilla. A pinch of cinnamon lingers on in the finish. Medium bodied with enough carbonation to keep the palette refreshed and the lovely aromas perking up from the glass. Delicious blend of pumpkin pie spices melding well with the oak. Might be picking up another one for the cellar."
""
"While admittedly I've far from sampled all that the hoard of pumpkin seasonals crowding the shelves these days has to offer, this is by far the most complex. The oak aging really adds a great depth and I really liked how boozey it is. Alot of good stuff going on. I'm definately going to pick up another bottle or two to enjoy and to perhaps try aging."
""
"O-quite disappointed with this one. Tastes like a boozey DFH Punkin. Not getting the oak that I was looking forward to."

"SOLID, NOT MUST TRY!"
"ive been pumped to try this beer for awhile, as the crooked line series has always been really good, and i love pumpkin brews. it pours surprisingly clear, dark orange in color, with a lazy bubbly tan head. lots of little bubbles rising up and a great glow. the nose is very very complex and seasonally perfect. tons of fresh pumpkin and vanilla and oak, a little less on the seasonal spice, but still plenty of nutmeg and clove going on at the finish. the oak has done wonders to this thing, id love to see more pumpkin brews aged this way. its mellow and the squash is allowed to bring all its autumnal sugars and startches to the flavor, which adds a lot. the mouthfeel is nice. not overly full on the body, and good carbonation. the alcohol, which is cleverly 10.31%, is not hardly detectable, which i find incredible. its still a massive beer, but its eerily drinkable. ill be buying more of these without a doubt. this is one id like to share back east over thanksgiving. its a beautiful brew."
""
"T: Lots of oak right away with some nice pumpkin flavor. Some slight hints of cinnamon and spices with some caramel malt. Mouthfeel definitely doesn't make this beer seem as high in alcohol as it is. Smooth and tasty, but not as much pumpkin as I would probably like."
""
"Pours a dark transparent mahogany color with a foamy cream cap. Decent retention. Notes of bourbon, vanilla, and a hint of oak barrel. Certainly pumpkin and holiday spices (allspice, cinnamon, cardamom, nutmeg). Alcohol well hidden, worth seeking out"

"O - Not a bad beer. Nice spin on the pumpkin beer that I am used to. I might revisit this one this coming Thanksgiving."
""
""
"This beer poured out as a nice looking amber color with some shades of brown in there too. The head was cream colored and foamy looking. The smell of the beer has a heavy amount of spices on the nose, there is a hint of the oak in there too which I thought was a good additional element. The taste has a good amount of spice that balance out the nose. The mouthfeel of the beer has a good amount of carbonation to it with a thick feeling body. Overall I thought this was a very good Pumpkin Ale. I'm happy to have tried it."
""
""
""
"Overall, I have to say I like it. There are bits that don't work, but it was a worthy experiment, and certainly something I'd be tempted to pick up again. This has about six months of age on it, but it feels like it could probably support even more, which is a good sign of itself. Not the best pumpkin ale I've ever had, but an interesting one nonetheless."
"O: Overall very easy to consume, nice spectrum of spicing, not overally exaggerated but rather all working and blending nicely together. Solid sweet toasty malt base finishes out a solid good example."
""
""
""
"Pours a medium red orange amber. Thin, coarse off white head dissipates to a ring leaving short lived lacing. Very light aroma of pumpkin, malt and very faint pumpkin pie spices. Pumpkin flavor dominates with some light maltiness, pumpkin pie spices, somewhat dry finish with some light oak, slightly spicy. Creamy and medium bodied. A nicely made pumpkin a little on the dry woody side for me."
""
""
"This is the last beer in the Crooked Line series for me to try, and it is my favorite. Although it's in a different class, I'll say it's much better than their Punk'n ale as well."

"A pretty decent - but not great - imperial pumpkin."

"Finally got around to crackin' this open after a lengthy stay in the fridge. Poured from a 75mL corked & caged bottle into a Firestone Walker tulip. Bottle opens with a solid pop, indicative of a good level of carbonation. Beer pours a brilliant, clear but dark, orangish-brown with a fingers width head that is very effervescent and quick fading. The nose is very eloquent indeed. Very spicy with clove, nutmeg, a tad bit of cinnamon. As with moth pumpkin beers, I don't really pick up any pumpkin. The taste is where it's at. This has a heavy, yet still wonderfully balanced spice profile with all of the aforementioned players coming to the forefront once again. I wish the barrel treatment was a little more evident, and wonder what could have been with bourbon barrels. Surprisingly, the alcohol isn't very pronounced in the taste, but it rears it's head in the mouthfeel providing a bit of a hot finish. The spice of this beer lingers on your palate for a decent length of time too. Over all, not bad at all. This is a very decent take on a pumpkin beer from Uinta. I may not necessarily seek this out again, as pumpkin beers generally aren't my forte, but I wouldn't snicker at someone if they offered it. I'd extend my glass at arms length. Good brew."

"This is medium bodied with ample, prickly carbonation."
"O: This is a pretty good beer. Pumpkin is hardly noticeable but I will definitely pick this up again if I can find it next year."

"O - A great pumpkin brew. I'd drink this one again!"
"Started my Thanksgiving off right with this one and I'm not disappointed."
""
"Pours a dark amber color with a creamy tan head that laces well. The aroma is a clean pumpkin smell. The taste is exactly what it should be, pumpkin and spice, not watery and not overpowering. A perfect balance of ingredients gives this a smooth, almost velvety mouthfeel and a taste that puts you in the season. Nice warming ABV but well hidden."

"Overall I was expecting more to be honest here. For the inflated price tag and the limited availability I would have preferred a more complex flavor profile. Reminded me a lot of the great higher ABV pumpkin ales out there, like Weyerbacher Imperial Pumpkin and Hoppin' Frog Double Hollow Pumpkin, but there was no really no added oak complexity from the barrels. A really good beer but a let down overall and not worth seeking out in my opinion just because there is more readily available, better bang for the buck Imperial Pumpkin ales on the market."
""
"Overall: I would absolutely buy this ale again. I am curious to see how this brew ages and I will write a review next year if it stands out."
"O: I am glad that I bought a few of these"
"O: a good pumpkin ale. The oak adds some interesting notes. It's a bit pricy, but is still better than most pumpkin ales."
"O- It was decent, but I wasn't too impressed overall. There just want enough of a pumpkin profile at any stage in consuming this beer. Oak was also pretty damn offensive which was offputting. I wouldn't purchase this at price over $7ish... Just mediocre"
"Not bad at all. The barrels impart a subtle oakiness; I wish there was a bit more impact from them. But the pumpkin/spice blend is sweet and smooth."
"Taste is some oak, autumn maple like, needs more pumpkin for an imperial pumpkin beer! Very surprised at the lack of pumpkin, expected more."
"Another sign of life in Utah's challenging beer environment. If we were giving points for labels, this one is outstanding."
"Cheers to Uinta for an interestingly different take on a pumpkin beer!"
"O-A must buy for my celler for the spiced pumpkin ale fix. Any hotness in this will surely be cured with a bit of aging. Very nice effort."
"Overall, I enjoyed this one a lot and would definitely buy it again if I ever find more. It is rich, delicious, and probably one of my top 3-4 for the style along with Schlafly and CCB Good Gourd. Highly recommended (if you like pumpkin ales)."
"D - A beer that is probably best served in 4oz glasses paired with dessert. Definitely one of the strongest offerings I've had in this style, but not something I urgently need to revisit."
"This is a very good pumpkin ale, but I still like Southern Tier's version better."
"Great marketing on the bottles of these crooked line series, just had to say it."
"My first """oak aged""" beer and it happens to be a pumpkin one at that. Pours a nice dark brown, great pumpkin spice smell. Taste is really good and creamy, nice balance of pumpkin flavors and the oakiness really adds a great touch. Alcohol a bit strong, but overall it's a good blend and the pumpkin doesn't feel overdone. Solid beer for sure, give it a try."
"(D)- A great pumpkin beer amidst some rather disappointing ones I have tried over the years. Smooth, but tastes dynamic and very enjoyable. The oak aging really created some unique nuances in this."
"A big brew, but not dominating. On the sweet side but sessionable enough. Very interesting but not amazing. An offering that becomes excellent as a seasonal."
"Overall, an OK pumpkin. It's subdued - even though it's 10+%. The spices seem a bit muddled and it's overly sweet to my tastes."
"Overall one of the best pumpkin ales I have tasted recently. Compared with other Imperial, barrel aged brews I don't think it would quite stack up, but compared fairly to other pumpkin ales it's a winner!"
"I love a good barrel aged beer... especially with bourbon barrels and pumpkin ales. Beautiful deep, dark color that looks like an elegant Tennessee whiskey. The aroma has just a hint of vanilla that entices your mouth to take a sip. Once the beer hits your tongue, your taste buds are filled with pleasures of pumpkin and spice accentuated by the barrel aging. Like I said in the beginning, I'm in love with barrel aged brews and this is one of them. Nice job Uinta!"
"o - Overall a pretty good pumpkin ale; not my favorite, but good. Nose is dominated by the spices, but the pumpkin comes out more in the taste. Girlfriend like it a lot, would have it again."
"(O) Really. Solid. Beer. I really enjoyed this as it's not the normal take on a pumpkin beer. Oak aging it really did something unique to this brew. It was pretty well balanced and just tasted quite excellent next to the spice-bag versions that some breweries put out. (Although I do tend to like the """spice bag""" versions as well, not knocking them, just saying this one's different)"
"Notes: Pretty likable, and quite the opposite pumpkin extreme from their session gourd offering. Good quality Crooked Line offering and a nice sipper to share…"
"Overall: This is a really good pumpkin beer. Its no Pumking, and it costs more, but I'm glad I tried it."
"Oak Jacked is somewhere between the average and good end of the imperial pumpkin patch."
"The one disappointment is that the pumpkin flavor is hard to detect among the other flavors because there is so much going on. Yet the overall flavor makes this beer hard to argue against."
"Overall: The spices are too subdued for my liking. The alcohol is fairly well hidded. I liked the oak character."
"O - Great Imperial Pumpkin style! First i've had of this style, impressive. Great job Uinta!!!"
"I gotta believe this is better than the Uinta standard pumpkin ale.Poured a deep rich bronze/amber with a thinner white head atop,good clarity to the body.Deep pumpkin pie spice,vanilla,and toasty oak ion the nose,a little sweet alcohol comes into play as well.a little thinner in the mouth for such a """big""" beer,clove spice and mace on the palate with a little roasted pumpkin and toasty oak,as the beer warms the sweet alcohol shows thru more.A very nice imperial pumpkin ale,the oak doesnt add much but a little toastiness that enhances the beer more,I like it."
"M/O: Very good weight and not too overpowering because of the alcohol content. Very good warmer type beer in every sense of the word."
"My wife picked this one up to share with me on my birthday last weekend. Poured a nice hazy brown color, with a good taupe head that hangs around for awhile. Nice aromas of roasted nuts, pumpkin pie spices, oak and maybe a little lightly roasted malt. Somewhat sweet and almost cloying on the palate, with some roasted malt, pumpkin pie spice and oak. ™"
" Honestly, I've never experienced pumpkin in a beer quite like I have with this one- it really is unique. Whereas most pumpkin beers tend to be an amber with pumpkin spice, this is a real pumpkin beer. Though a little pricey, this is definietly a beer that fits the season and is worth trying once, if for nothing else, than to see how pumpkin can be represented in a beer both in terms of flavor and texture."
"O: Uinta's Oak Jacked Imperial Pumpkin easily ranks near the top of the pumpkin beer echelon. Nary a brash or overdone spice is to be found, and the wood adds a really inviting complexity to the beer which is perfect for a chilly autumn evening. If you're a fan of the style, I highly recommend checking this one out. This is what I'd call a grown-up's pumpkin ale."
"Bready and spicy palate. Pie crust, caramel and molasses, a touch of -bal that doesn't overwhelm the base beer. The spices thankfully don't, either; it's surprisingly well balanced. Cinnamon is pronounced, along with nutmeg and clove, but they don't provide much astringency as is often the case with these spiced pumpkin ales. Surprisingly good on the whole, and better as it warms."
"O- My new favorite pumpkin beer! If Uinta fixed the carbonation problem I think this would overtake Pumking for the best pumkin beer out there. Will definitely try next year."
"very good pumpkin orange/brown color with a bit of haziness to it. Nice moderate offwhite head. Smell is a bit strong of oak wood and a mild amount of spice. Not a whole lot else on the nose. The taste is incredible. Very little oak comes to play, and what is there really amps up the flavor of the pumpkin. I'm not getting much spice on the palette but rather a very strong, very creamy pumpkin flavor. Hands down best pumpkin only flavor I've gotten out of this style. Slight hints at maple, vanilla and cinnamon/clove...but pumpkin is all center stage. Creamy in the mouth, fizz plays well. Great pumpkin beer...a pleasant surprise."
"I applaud this for sure."
"Pours a very nice dark shade of brown with some light orange, and average head. Smells of pumpkin and a cinnamon but not much oak. Flavors mirror the aroma but the cinnamon is a little more pronounced. Nice dry use of the pumpkin and pairing with the clove. Overall it's nothing to write home about but it is a very solid pumpkin beer. Wish the oak flavoring would have come through more as that's one of the unique feature that attracted me to the beer in the first place"
"O: I really enjoyed this. The barrel qualities were well integrated and not overpowering at all."
"O - Sadly disappointed with this one. It just falls very short in the taste. I just personally think the oak is too aggressive in this one. It totally over powers the great pumpkin flavors that I think are in there.... or are they?"
"O: Pretty disappointing stuff sadly as much of their other stuff has impressed. It's flavors are muddy and sweet finishing."
"O: Less than stellar."
"Pours a dark copper orange with a 1 inch foamy tan head that settles to a film on the top of the beer. Thin foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of sweet malt, pumpkin pie spices, vanilla, and some wood notes. Taste is of sweet malt and pumpkin puree up front while the various spices and slight vanilla flavor coming in on the finish. The spices add a sight earthy bitterness that lingers on the palate after each sip. I am not really getting any of the oak flavors in the taste though. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good pumpkin ale with a nice balance of all the flavors. The smell is not as good as the taste but this is still a worthy beer to pick up for the season. Interesting to see that the ABV is at 10.31% (Halloween). I am not too sure how they can get it so exact."
"This is a very good beer and I wish there was some more on the shelves here in Chicago. This just became one of my favorite beers for pumpkin beers. Cheers!"
"Beautiful pour. A red tinged auburn with a sizable creamy beige head. Nice lacing. Fantastic spicey aroma - cloves, vanilla, eggnog, oven baked pie. Sweet tasting, with just a hint of bitterness to prevent it from becoming too cloying. Spieced sweet potato and marshmellows. Wow. This is really quite nice. Very smooth mouthfeel - creamy, velvety. Alcohol is warming, but oh so very well hidden. Overall, this is, bar none, the very best pumpkin beer I have ever had. Exceptional in style, and quite nice and well rounded as a whole. Highest recommendation for a Halloween treat."
"Overall great, nice malts, nice pumpkin addition, booze is very well hidden, nice buttery oak, smooth and tasty and goes down much easier than I expected."
"Overall -- Not bad. I wouldn't call this an exceptional pumpkin ale, but definitely better than average. I would like to have tasted this without the barrel treatment."
"O: Something different as far as pumpkin beers go. Probably one of my favorites this season. Still, I cant figure out how the aroma can be so muted in comparison to the excellent flavor profile of this beer."
"Part two of two in my Utahn pumpkin beer mini-fete. The little cousin was pretty nice, so this one has some lofty expectations to live up to. It pours a clear sunset tawny-amber topped by over a finger of dirty pale cream-white foam. The nose comprises buttery biscuits, light caramel, light nutmeg, rye bread, oak, light clove, and a few drops of mandarin orange syrup. The taste holds notes of lightly toasted rye bread, charred oak, caramel, mandarin orange, nutmeg, brown sugar, toasted pumpkin seeds, light booze, and a dripping of maple syrup. The body is a sleek medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a lightly syrupy feel. Overall, this did not live up to the expectations preceding it. The spices have been mostly muted, the alcohol makes itself far too known, the oak seems to be a bit on the blackened side, and the balance that held Punk'n so well has disappeared in his relative here. It's not a bad beer, really, just one that disappointed a bit..."
"O: Makes me happy I have one more!"
"O- This is one of the best pumpkin beers I've had to date. Really well balanced and i feel the pumpkin is actually present as apposed to just the spices you normally find in pumpkin pie."
"O: One of the best pumpkin ales I've had. The barrel aging is subtle yet noticeable. I've only had one other barrel aged pumpkin ale and it had a bit more bourbon flavor. Still very recommended though."
"O: Clearly in the upper echelon of pumpkin beers we can get in the Southland. The Pumking I had last night side by side overshadowed it, but having a bottle to myself I can better assess its qualities. A good beer for sure, if this was $10 I'd be ecstatic, but when it's pushing $17 for the 750 it makes it tough, even when this is so good in its style."
"tastes like a very good strong ale, but then on finish has the delightful pumpkin pie flavor."
"Overall: I really enjoyed the pumpkin along with the Belgian like finish. I thought everything worked together well."
"Pours a dark brown colored body, very clear throughout. Head tops about 1/2""" with slowly disapating froth. Aroma contains notes of pumpkin blended with the harvest spices… all spice, nutmeg, cinnamon. Center brings out the spices used in the beer. The all spice and nutmeg flavors are predominant, blended with a pumpkin puree flavoring. Beer is a malt bomb, with high abv felt on first sip and lasting well into the warming aftertaste. Finish gives off a spicey trail to the flavors, while the palate adjusts to the large wafts of alcohol. Beer is decent, a bit hot, but the pumpkin flavors are there and mixed well with the spices."
"O - Overall, the best """imperial""" pumpkin I've ever had, thats for sure. Its a pretty solid barrel aged beer, and while it is a bit confusing it is still quite delicious."
