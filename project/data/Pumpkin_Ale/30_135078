This and Good Gourd by Cigar City are the 2 best beers I have ever had that prominently incorporate pumpkin into the style.

4.56,10.7,4.25,4.5,4.75,4.25,4.5,"Picked this up in a great trade with Jonathan!  Dark brown, nearly black pour with a nice two finger beige head with nice retention and great lacing.  The nose is amazing with huge bourbon and dark fruit notes along with hints of dark chocolate, raisins, molasses, cocoa, vanilla, and oak.  The taste is extremely bold with huge bourbon barrel notes front and center.  Tons of dark fruits, especially raisins, along with hints of molasses, dark chocolate, oak, vanilla, toffee, maple, and subtle, earthy pumpkin.  Surprisingly, the pumpkin pie spices are not overpowered by the booze. The cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, and allspice really emerge as it comes to temp.  The mouthfeel is thick and syrupy and extremely rich with an awesome warming finish.  With that said, considering the 17.22% ABV, it's way more drinkable than expected.  Sure, it's definitely a sipper, but no wheres near as hot and harsh as some reviewers made it out to be.  Overall, this was a complex, bold, and flavorful beer.  Highly recommended!","beerdrifter","Jan 31, 2015"

Alcohol hot hot heat dominate though, even sipping it slowly. getting past that though, there is the aforementioned chocolate and hints of coffee, but that same blend of vanilla from the barrel bleeding into the vanilla of the porter and the creamy sweet of pumpkin meat.  Round and smoothe once you get past the overwhelming alcohol. I like most of the underlying flavours. I suppose I would consider laying it down for a couple of years, but I would worry that the underlying pumpkin from which much of the pleasure derives might dissipate. As it is it's still far too hot to truly enjoy/appreciate now. Lots of tasty complex flavours, just so overshadowed by the boozahol...","kemoarps","Jan 08, 2015"

The flavor of bourbon is present with some light cinnamon and dry clove-like pumpkin spice qualities perhaps some nutmeg and a mild cocoa quality blending well with subtle woody taste mid palate. The finish has a slight alcohol flavor but mild for the strength of the beer with bourbon and vanilla coming in with a slight dessert-like richness. I am truly impressed by the wonderful barrel-aged quality of this pumpkin porter -nicely spiced without going overboard and asssertive with a serious amount of bourbon yet smooth overall and just incredible considering the components working together in this huge pumpkin ale.","Slatetank","Dec 07, 2014"

It has a harsh spice presence, big booze and little of the stout left by the end. I'd say it's incrementally more intolerable as it warms.

I taste dark fruits like prunes but get a little fig. The middle is a bit malty with some sweet chocolate. It ends a bit spicy with nutmeg clove and even some cinnamon.

Nose is nothing but deep, syrupy scents of baked figs, molasses, and spiced rum, bearing no resemblance to a porter whatsoever (I'm thinking Belgian quad or BSDA). Initial tastes follow suit but carry a slow whiskey burn on top of the residual sugars. Get past that, though, and the beer opens up with notes of coconut, almond, and the toasted, dark-chocolate grain taste of an imperial porter, along with just the slightest notes of ginger and pumpkin purée. Overall, this one is enjoyable (for being such a big beer), but I'd give it at least another 6 months in the bottle to mellow out. Personally, I think a year would be perfect.

4.35,5.6,3.75,4.25,4.5,4,4.5,"Poured into a Fremont small snifter.  Pours a very dark mahogany brown, appearing black in the glass with a thin, light brown head that dissipates quickly to patches, slight lacing. Rich aroma of bourbon with light pumpkin pie and toasted malt, kind of like a pumpkin pie swimming in bourbon. Flavor follows with quite realistic pumpkin pie melded with semi-sweet dark toasted malt and lost of bourbon. Medium to heavy bodied with light creaminess, mild carbonation. This really tastes like taking a bite of a good, not oversweet pumpkin pie and chasing it with a small taste of bourbon and a swig of sweet stout. Very nice. Not much fresh pumpkin, but the pie is nailed. Dessert in a glass. The bourbon is assertive, but this really hangs together perfectly with no component out of place. Ultra ABV well covered. Delicious and deadly.","LiquidAmber","Oct 24, 2014"

Being this high of abv, the beer was quite a bit to handle and has to be something you sip on over time.

The sweet, brown porter character is there, the pumpkin ale styling can't be missed, and the bourbon barrel aging is also front-and-center.

Cinnamon is the strongest of the spices with some nutmeg and allspice in the back.  The bourbon barrel brings heavy vanilla and char.  The spice and barrel are more prominent than the porter base.  Hints of chocolate are present but are basically buried.  The taste is a cinnamon bomb with heavy sweetness.  Notes of caramelized pumpkin, brown sugar, vanilla, and barrel char all come through.  The alcohol brings some warmth to the finish.  While this is sweet, the sweetness is relatively in check considering the high abv.  Overall, a pretty intriguing brew.  The spice profile doesn't scream pumpkin as it leans so heavily to the cinnamon side of things.

It manages to be super sweet but not cloying.   Does it need age to mellow out?  I don't think so, but it could only get better over time.

On the first couple of sips, I couldn't taste the bourbon because it was so hot, but after it warmed in the glass for a few minutes, there was an exquisite velvety bourbon flavor that hit hard at the beginning, and slowly gave way to the imperial porter's maltiness.

4.05,-1.7,3.5,4,4,4.25,4.25,"this is obviously something special, all of the big avery stuff is, but this one is real unique as strong beers and pumpkin beers each go. porter is a cool base for this, the darker grain brings a lot to the table in terms of flavor depth, and does a good job balancing the pumpkin flavors. the beer is a muddy brown color with no head at all. its about as thick and syrupy and one would reasonably suspect, but the texture in the mouth is more slippery than sticky, and as diabetic as this beer is on a sugar scale, it doesnt feel teeth rotting in the end. pumpkin flavors are secondary to the bourbon, which is anything but subtle. sweet vanilla and oak and indeed some booze are tasted even above the dark malts. its not as complex as some others in the big barrel series, but i think its integrated all the elements really well. my issue here is than i can have about 4 ounces of this and i need to move on. its too sweet and strong for much drinking, and i think a more robust yeast strain would have taken this thing well over 20% abv, given the remaining residual sugars. overall a must try, all of these are, but maybe one i wouldnt buy again by virtue of its absurdity.","StonedTrippin","Oct 02, 2014"

It's hot and sweet, and the spices are present but get lost in the background do to the booziness. I will let this beer age for quite a while before trying my second bottle. All this being said, I will be first in line to buy their next barrel release!","Kramerbarthomer","Sep 27, 2014"
