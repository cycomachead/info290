"Mouthfeel is fairly rich, the beer is not too thin or weak. Nice job on a style that often is too over-the-top for me."
""
"Not horrible for a pumpkin ale"
"Overall:  This is a pretty tasty beer.  Good malty flavor up front, balanced with the pumpkin and the spices.  Unique in how much bitterness appears in the finish.  Interesting."

"O: Did not really enjoy this one, tasted mostly generic, nothing crazy about this beer and not a lot of flavors coming through."

"Better than avg. pumpkin, but not by a lot. Hazy like most Long Trails. Slightly sweet - could be less so for my tastes - but not overspiced, which is a downfall of many pumpkins. Good, not great."

"Bottle. Pours a dark amber color. Head is standard. Very generous with lacing. Aroma consists solely of pumpkin spicing. Sweetness and spices. Noticeable cloves. Pumpkin beer all the way. Pumpkin and all the members of the spice gang. Actually has a gourdy flavor. Slightly bitter. Less spice-laden on the tongue. Medium bodied. Another Pumpkin....another Pumpkin."

"Overall meh, pumpkin is vegetal and gourd like, not so tasty, as well as the sweet molasses and brown sugar, as well as the bitter tannic spices, etc. Not a very tasty beer."
"Pumpkin is getting a bit overdone (seems like everything is pumpkin spice these days) but like everything else they do, Long Trail has produced a nice version of a pumpkin ale.  Balanced, not overly sweet with the right amount of spice.  Well done"

"Nice basic pumpkin beer.  A little sweetness, some pumpkin and little spice.  For the price I would highly recommend this unless you like a lot of spice."

"T: First few sips were pretty good. Nice blend of earthy gourdiness, and balanced autumn spices. Medicinally bitter aftertaste...really bad like you've left a pill in your mouth too long (2.75/5)"

"2.64/5: Schlafly Pumpkin Ale, this is not"

"I guess i liked this a little more than others.Pours a clear deep burnt orange with a thinner white head atop.Pumpkin pie spice....clove,cardamom,and cinnamon mainly in the nose with a hint of toast.Very light in the feel but decent flavors really with the pumpkin pie spice and some light roast,not crazy sweet but sweet enough,pretty average but not horrible."

"Great pumpkin scent and flavor, bitter aftertaste leaves you not wanting more."
""
""
"Usually I go for pumpkin beers that have more of a stronger pumpkin flavor, but I like how Long Trail's pumpkin beer is done. It definitely weighs more on the spiced side but I really enjoy how it seems to have sweeter notes of brown sugar as opposed to more potent hints of cinnamon. The flavors of clove, nutmeg and brown sugar give it a good body and finishes with a slight bit of pumpkin thrown in there. To me, its nothing too original but has respectable elements to it."

"my first pumpkin brew of the year this year, coming mid august, earlier every year but I am okay with that, and okay with this being the start of hopefully a long pumpkin ale season. its got a cool spice profile that's not super autumnal, more spice than squash, and a sort of lightness to it, maybe from honey rather than molasses. less raw, more refined. allspice and anise are there, and the pumpkin appears to be more roasted than raw. a nice orange rusty caramel color, a little haze to it, and a short and short lived tan head. it smells and tastes quite robust, but I don't find it overdone on the spices, and it has a real natural and organic sort of earthy feel to it, not artificially flavored at all. I find the body to be far thinner than I like in the style, maybe too light for cold weather, but it helps me drink it in this summer weather. carbonation is there but there is a missing middle to the feel and a strange tannic finish. mouthfeel would be its lowest score I think, if that feature were not just removed from this site. if it comes back I will update, if not, look elsewhere for a fuller bodied pumpkin ale."

"Had the best pop... cleanest taste.. very good brew and I would look for this one when seeking out pumpkin brews"
""
""
""
"Pours rusty copper with scattered white foam. Hazy/cloudy. Malty nose, hints of pumpkin and spice. Taste is a light cinnamon, spiced malt, with nutmeg/clove making a cameo. Pumpkin-rind like bite at the end. Pie taste too."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- more malt presence than most pumpkin ales I've had, which is welcomed. There's a nice spiciness in the flavor but nothing overpowers. Worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear, bright bronze color with a white soapy head. Aroma of hops and pumpkin. In the taste, pumpkin and caramel malt, mild spice and a fair hop bitterness. Not as sweet as advertised, which is a good thing in this case. Leafy, tobaccoesque hop character and nutmeg in the finish. The pumpkin flavor remains dispersed throughout. Light to medium bodied mouth feel, with moderate carbonation and a spice/hop bite. Overall, this is a well crafted pumpkin ale, which is a distinctly American beer style."
""
""

""
""
"A pretty lack luster average pumpkin ale. Good drinkability if you wanted to pound down a sixes, but not something I would seek out."
""
""
"Overall – A rather sweet but enjoyable pumpkin ale with a nice blend of roasted pumpkin and spice. Overall rather easy drinking and tasty."
""
""
"I was pleasantly impressed by this. A good drinkable pumpkin ale."
""
""
""
"O - Looks nice and smell is decent but flavor is really off unfortunately."
"Taste is big pumpkin up front followed by bitter and sweet spice - ginger, nutmeg, cinnamon. It has a thick sweet malt flavor with some subtle caramel notes. This is a very good pumpkin ale. It flirts with a good amount of spice without being cloying."
""
""

"This was the first pumpkin beer I've had this fall, so my opinion may be slightly favorable but I really like this beer. It's got a nice, even pumpkin aroma and flavor that's not overstated and is incredibly refreshing. Pumpkin doesn't dominate the palate like some other beers of this style tend to do, I'm thinking Shipyard Pumpkinhead and it doesn't taste like pumpkin pie. I've always been a fan of Long Trail beers and I was glad to see this in the fall mix pack. An excellent start to pumpkin beer season!"
""
""
""
"The good news is, as a pumpkin, this is a big glass of okay. I still looked forward to getting done so I could have other tastes in the sampler case. Oh yeah, two of these have a pretty good kick."
""
"This brew has a solid drinkability level and captures the flavors of the Fall season quite well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, easy drinking with a nice finish. There's something funky with the way the malt plays with the spices that doesn't quite work. The beer starts off nice, has a strange combination of flavors in the middle and finishes great. Wouldn't go back to it the way it is, but a slightly tweaked recipe could be great."
""
""
""
""
"Overall not very impressive. Long Trail's imperial pumpkin is worth looking into but I would pass over this one"
""
"This is an okay pumpkin beer. Unfortunately, it was a disappointment as are most pumpkin beer. As always, it's worth it to try it for yourself, but there are other better pumpkin beers than this."

"O. A good pumpkin that gets a little spice heavy. That said, flavors are well balanced and tend towards a malty bitterness, which makes a good pumpkin ale. I am not blown away, but I am certainly impressed."
""
""
""
"This was poured into a pint glass, it has a nice murkey brown colored body with a small white head that layed down to a nice lace. The smell has a aroma of spices with a little hint of pumpkin to it. The taste is spices up front followed by a little pumpkin flavor and some malt on the back of the tonuge. The mouth feel is nice, easy drinker and overall a good pumpkin beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"D - Not too shabby... A solid slightly above average pumpkin ale... Very quaffable... Outstanding appearance and slightly above average in all other facets... I would never turn one down, but this won't be one of my go to pumpkin ales either..."
"O - Not a bad pumpkin ale, but nothing extraordinary. The burnt flavor in the aftertaste really brings the experience down, and the aroma is mild on spices. Worth trying if you are looking for a darker tasting pumpkin beer, but there are better options in general."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- This is a very drinkable pumpkin ale. Quite sessionable. I wouldn't turn it down but i dont think i would ever buy a six pack."

"It’s good to see Long Trail finally putting a Pumpkin Ale out, as it’s a seasonal style that would seem to be right in their wheel house. And this was a nice example of the style too, with an easy feel, balanced flavors and a fresh pumpkin character that carried this well. I’ll definitely be keeping an eye out again for this one."
"Overall: Nice beer with a very nice pumpkin flavor and isn't overly sweet, and has a nice bitterness to bring it all together. Goes down smooth, doesn't offend the palate and could be enjoyed in multiples. May drink again, but I recommend it. Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a nice pumpkin ale because it isn't overly sweet or packed with too many spices."
"O: Enjoyable and it is a pleasant change for the style that the beer is not really too sweet. Enjoyable but not sure that I want to have more than one of these at a session."
""
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a light brown/orangeish color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is strong of pumpkin and spices. Taste is mellow compared to the smell, pumpkin, a touch of spice, kind of mild. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a pretty good beer."
""
""
"Overall: Of all the pumpkin beers I have had this fall, this one is one of the more disappointing ones. If you like your pumpkin spice more subtle and the beer a bit more on the pale side, this one is probably for you. Long Trail has a different take on the style, I just wish the pumpkin spice or breadiness would have popped some more."
""
""
"The taste is slightly sweet at the start but then explosively bitter at the end. But it is not what I would call a hop bitterness. It was more like a lingering potato thing. Sadly the usually reliable Long Trail slips up a bit on this one but it is still reasonably drinkable."
"Overall I think this beer is a great beer to try, it's not your typical pumpkin beer."
""
""
"D: good pumpkin beer, but not great. pumpkin spice flavor, not much else going on. pass for me going forward."
""
""
"O: A pretty mediocre, middle-of-the-road pumpkin ale to further flood the market with. The 5.5% ABV and clean, crisp nature of the beer make it an easy choice as far as session pumpkin ales go. However, it's a bit too sharp, bland and hoppy to be a truly enjoyable, rich fall brew. I'd be unlikely to turn it down, but I probably wouldn't buy it outside of the variety pack if it were available."
""
""
"I was a bit disappointed in this offering. I know it is not an """Imperial""" pumpkin but it really lacks character. Golden orange hue with about 1 finger of head on it. Smells spicy and sweet, maybe too sweet on the nose for my liking. Taste matches the nose for the most part. Malty and a lot of all spice and clove-medium mouthfeel. Just ok-not terrible or anything like that. Good for someone that drink average ales and wants to try a pumpkin beer. Cheers!"
""
"This beer pours out clear, and slightly orange in color. Smells of spiced pumpkin, and a little bit like a pumpkin pie. The taste is less pumpkiny than the nose, but the body and taste are still quite good. Overall a pretty decent Fall seasonal, worth at least giving a shot."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a light copper with a finger of head that dissipated rather quickly, but left a touch of lace behind. The nose is definitely pumpkin-like. Not much of a pumpkin taste to this offering. The finish is pleasantly dry. Not bad, but not terribly memorable."
"I had tried the Long Trail Pumpkin last year and was impressed by the rich, smooth pumpkin taste. The spiced pumpkin flavor lingered for a long time. So impressed that I ran out and picked up a case this year as soon as it was available. This year's beer is vastly different than last year. Considerably less pumpkin flavor and a harsh bitterness than wreaks havoc on the taste buds. I even tried increasing the sweetness by dipping the glass in cinnamon sugar. Did not help. Unfortunately, as with many of the pumpkin ales you really need to sample the beer each year before you commit to a supply of it. Pity the Long Trail is such a disappointment this year."
""
"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a bright, vibrant, copper-brown coloring with no head. Aromas of roasted pumpkin, cinnamon, and a touch of brown sugar. Smells very smooth and rich. Flavors are sharply roasted, with a rough backbone. The pumpkin flavors are overshadowed by the roasting and increased carbonation, giving the beer a very sharp feeling in mouth. Roasty, pumpkin sweet aftertaste with extremely mild spicing. A light, crisp, quick finish. I was intrigued by the smell, but it left a bit to be desired past that point."

"I was surprised with this beer and I think it rivals some of the better made pumpkin beers out there. It was the last one in my beer store so maybe its more popular than I had imagined. Anyways good beer and definitely a sessionable Halloween beer."
""
"O: in my opinion, one of the better pumpkins out there from what I've had. I'll have no problem getting the rest of these down."
""
"O - Actually one of the better pumpkin beers out there. Seems like it is new to the fall packs. I'd get this again. And at the price of a 12 pack it is a nice deal."
""
""
"O: I really enjoyed this beer and will definitely seek it out again. A really nice cross between a pumpkin beer and a brown ale. It could have used a little more pumpkin flavor, but im not complaining. Overall, solid!"
""
"Thin brisk body yet feels kind of full in the mouth. Light toasted malt sweetness followed by pumpkin flavor and its accompanying spices. Finishes with spicy with a linger well done pie crust taste in the mouth. Subtle yet complex with waves of flavor and great drinkability. Not an in your face pumpkin but definitely nice for some fall daytime drinking. A nice fall session choice."
""
"More of an amber/marzen type of ale. The pumpkin spice is too light. I do like the bear carting the pumpkins on the label for what its worth."
"A pumpkin ale that you can actually have a few of without tasting clove all night. What a concept"
"Meh. I'm not sure what they're aiming for here but it's not anything that I want to drink often. Reminds me too much of a marzen."
"O - an average pumpkin beer. nothing over the top or exciting. easy to drink"
"Purchased a six pack at the brewery the day it was released on August 1st.  Copper in color with visible carbonation.  Light head and lacing.  The aroma is of ginger and nutmeg followed by pumpkin.  Thin and fairly carbonated mouthfeel.  The first taste is of ginger as it hits the tongue.  The finish is mild pumpkin with a touch of cinnamon.   This is a good pumpkin ale, not overpowering and not too sweet.  Easy drinking for  the style."
