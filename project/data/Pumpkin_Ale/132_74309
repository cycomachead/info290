Malty flavor has a firm, but not overpowering, note of pumpkin plus hints of cloves and cinnamon and a touch of hops. Texture has good fizz and body. A very good beer for a Halloween party - or for Thanksgiving dinner.","Cyberkedi","Feb 01, 2015"

Smell is the same as the color. Taste is exceptional. Balances the sweetness with the spice. Doesn't go to heavy on spice. Exceptional pumpkin flavor. Love the finish.

It pours a clear sienna-amber topped by a finger of sandy foam.  The nose comprises caramel, mild pumpkin pie spices, and a twinge of dark greens.  The taste brings in more of the same, relatively heavy on the clove and cinnamon.  The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel.  Overall, not a bad pumpkin ale at all, one that hits the spice notes without burning the tongue with them.  Well-balanced and enjoyable.","TMoney2591","Nov 21, 2014"

3.85,0.3,,,,,,"I really enjoyed this beer.  Pours a burnt orange with a little red and a nice beige head.  This is the most pure pumpkin tasting beer I've had yet.  Where Elysian's Night Owl Pumpkin Ale tastes like pumpkin pie, this tastes like pumpkin, and I really like it.  The spices complement the pumpkin subtly rather than overpowering the flavor.  I would rate this higher, but something about this beer makes me not able to drink a whole lot.  One glass of this would be perfect, but 750 mL is quite a bit for one person.  That could be me, but I think a great beer makes me want more than one.","stratusjeans","Oct 31, 2014"

The flavor was full of pumpkins in the beginning but the addition of cardamom (typically an Indian spice) gives this pumpkin ale a very unique taste profile that I think works great and gives a nice balancing spice to the usually very sweet pumpkin ales.","WhiteHillsStore","Oct 24, 2014"

The spices come through marvelously in the smell. The taste begins with the sweet flavor of the pumpkin then moves to all those wonderful notes of spice. The mouthfell is exactly what a pumpkin ale, the flavor of the pumpkin as well as the spices linger for a appropriate amount of time.

It is a light to medium bodied beer that is smooth and easy to drink and finishes crisp and easy thanks to the spice and decent hops and carbonation. As for the taste, a good chunk of pumpkin is noticeable but it is not overpowering and thankfully the spices in here, like a touch of nutmeg, cinnamon, pepper, balance the beer, as do some sweet and bready. So while not overly sweet or pumpkiny, it is also not watery and too spicy and almost no pumpkin is noticeable as I have found in some other (cheap) pumpkin ales. Not the greatest or tastiest pumpkin ale but I got my "pumpkin fix" and it was sweet enough to enjoy as a dessert beer and that's all I ask.","clayrock81","Mar 15, 2013"

4.22,9.9,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"750 ml bottle into signature shaker pint glass, 2012 bottling. Pours lightly hazy reddish copper color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Slight spotty soapy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of caramel, pumpkin, pear, ginger, nutmeg, cinnamon, toast, brown sugar, clove, brown bread, and herbal hops. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of malt and spices. Taste of caramel, pumpkin, toast, ginger, pear, nutmeg, cinnamon, brown sugar, clove, brown bread, and herbal spiciness. Fair amount of spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, pumpkin, pear, toast, ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, brown sugar, clove, and herbal spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of flavors; with a nice malt/spiciness balance; and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy, slick, and foamy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish, as expected of 5.6%. Overall this is a highly excellent pumpkin ale! Great balance and complexity of malt/spice flavors; and extremely smooth to drink. A highly enjoyable pumpkin beer offering.","superspak","Jan 13, 2013"

Something strange about pumpkin ales in July in Florida...per Rogue the later release was due to growing their own GYO pumpkins and declining to use canned pumpkin. This is an attractive beer with hazy reddish orange body with creamy yellow head. The aroma of pumpkin pie spices is more subtle than other examples of this style, also a plus. The taste: this is , I am happy to report, my favorite of the years pumpkin ales! I've tried a BUNCH of them this year. Well balanced but not boring and no chemical off tastes. I know there is a fair Amount of variability in this style from year to year, ie Weyerbacher was great last year but disappointing this year, but hopefully Rogue will hit the mark again in subsequent years!","runbirddrinkbeer","Jan 07, 2013"
4.3,12,4.25,4.25,4.25,3.75,4.75,"Final Grade: 4.3, an excellent A grade. Rogue's Pumpkin Patch Ale is a fine specimen of this occasionally-obnoxious style - everything is balanced perfectly, with lots of spicy goodness for those who enjoy that aspect of the style, but never going overboard. This is not a spice/booze bomb that will exhaust your palate. The malty sweetness, gourdy flavours and (relatively) dense body do their part keeping the spice in check, generating an unbelievably quaffable spiced ale. As much as I love Pumking, I like this stuff nearly as much, although for different reasons. Pumpkin Patch is obviously much lighter and nuanced, and for that reason I would suggest it as a perfect introductory pumpkin ale for newbies interested in trying the style. I would also highly recommend it to seasoned pumpkin-loving BAs who are looking for a great fall/winter spiced sipper. Cheers!","thehyperduck","Jan 06, 2013"

Malty brown sugar aroma with pumpkin, orange zest, and spice notes. Toasted malt up-front followed closely by a vegetal note from the pumpkin puree and a melange of spices. Nutmeg and cinnamon are more prominent than clove. A nutty character persists throughout. Almost medium bodied with moderate carbonation and a soft, gentle mouthfeel. The pumpkin and spice character is strong enough to be easily noticed, but restrained enough to allow the base malt character of the beer to shine through. There is some sweetness to it, but not a whole lot. It certainly isn't Pumking. An extremely well balanced take on a style that many find either overpowering or underflavored.

Roasted, almost lightly burned spice up front, moving into fresher, sugary-er spice in the middle (more pie-like) with big nodes of cinnamon and nutmeg. This segues gently into the most pumpkiny pumpkin nodes I've ever come across in a beer--it's like fresh, seasoned puree. Really great stuff. The flavor ends with a resurgence of vanilla along with more fresh pumpkin, and blended with an exceptionally creamy body the effect is quite similar to spritzing some Readi-Whip on top of a slice of pie.","mynie","Nov 04, 2012"

Flavors of cooked pumpkin, burnt pie crust, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, clove, acidic vanilla, mild spicy hop presence towards the finish. Medium bodied with medium carbonation. Prickly feeling. I expect better from Rogue. The beer could use less emphasis on the spices and bring in a heftier, creamier body.

3.97,3.4,3.5,4,4,4,4,"750 ml bottle, 2012 vintage in the orange bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a copper/orange color with about an inch light tan head. Head retention is good, and there's a small amount of lacing. The aroma is nice, it smells like pumpkins, nutmeg, cinnamon, and a bit of ginger. Nice balance between the pumpkin and spices in the aroma. Taste is similar to the aroma, but the flavor seems to be more pumpkiny than spicy although the spices are noticeable. The taste reminds me of eating pumpkin bread. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy and slick with moderate carbonation. I think this is a good overall pumpkin ale. A bit pricey at $9.99 a bottle so I probably wouldn't pick this one up very often, but it's definitely worth trying.","bluejacket74","Oct 25, 2012"

Finishes a bit dry with light hops. Pumpkin flavor carries over only slightly into the finish. Medium bodied.
