"This is an old one. Bottled in 2013. Didn’t quite foam over when I opened the bottle, but about 1 inch of foam stuck straight up above the bottle rim. Poured with a big white thick head. Sour spice aroma. Is this beer supposed to be sour? Tart mildly spiced taste. Not getting much pumpkin. I think it tastes pretty good. Nice bubbly dry mouthfeel. I really like it. Hope it’s supposed to taste this way."
"Not my normal style, served in a 8 oz snifter at White  Oak Tavern.  Cloudy orange, citrus like nose.  Sour but not overly but blends with the pumpkin very well.  smooth but nicely carbonated."
""
"I must say I was disappointed with this beer. I liked the fall spices which they incorporated into the beer, but overall the beer seemed way less flavorful than their other beers, and the tartness was way toned-down. And I would have little some pumpkin taste as well."
"Sampled on tap at the Black Star coop JP tap takeover.  Pours a nice bright tangerine color with just a ski of fine white head.  Only clear at the edges.  Nose is surprisingly underwhelming with just a hint of orange.  Flavor - autumn in a glass.  Apple, squash, orange and wood.  This sour would serve as a good introduction to the style for newbie sour heads.  Finish is very clean."

"Light sour, light oak, earthy Brett, green apple, very light cinnamon, white grape"

"Typical Jolly Pumpkin offering.The spicing adds a really nice flavor to the usual sourness, but there's not really much pumpkin coming through.  A very good beer, well worth trying."
""
""
"Pours a cloudy amber with one finger thick dense white head, a few rings of lace on the glass. Smell: lactic with straw and bread aromas, unripe nectarine, coriander, ginger-ish but maybe that's just a component of the raw pumpkin... not canned junk, so don't expect a pumpkin pie in your face... not getting any cocoa. If you're not going to give me an intense and accurate beersentation of pumpkin pie, then this is what I want. Taste brings the same. plus a pop of nutmeg-ish spice. Refreshing. Light-medium bodied, velvet feel, tart and drying finish with a little residual sugar and spice beat out by oak and grapeskin. Bottled 10/10/14. Much needed different take on the style (not that it's a new release) given the trend towards bigger, sweeter, barrel-ier."

"Was not that sour.  The pumpkin flavor was not as strong as it could have been.  And at the same time there was not much in the way of spices."

"Overall I thought this was a pretty nice beer and i thought it was a good example of a JP beer, but strictly as a Pumpkin Ale it falls shorts since the pumpkin and the spices aren't all that noticeable, but in the end I still enjoyed it.  This beer had nice drinkability, it was smooth, not too acidic, crisp, a little dry on the finish, not too filling and the taste did a nice job at holding my attention, I don't think I would have a problem drinking the whole bottle since it's not too acidic and there's isn't any aspect that was too overpowering and would wear on me.  What I like the most about this beer was mouthfeel, it was pretty good and it fit in nicely with this beer.  What I like the least about this beer was that the spices and pumpkin didn't show up more, I can get a little bit of them, but I found myself wish that both aspects were much stronger.  I would buy this beer again, it's not something I'm going to stock up on, but I'll for sure get one when it's released next year.  I would recommend this to any farmhouse ale fan, if your looking for a good Pumpkin Ale I'm pretty sure you will be disappointed.  All in all I liked this beer, but I didn't love it, I think the balance was a little off and in the end I just wanted more of those pumpkin and spice aspects.  It's not my favorite JP beer or my favorite of the style, it kind of falls in the middle in both categories.   Nice job guys, this beer wasn't bad at all, keep up the hard work."

"On tap, at the Community Tap in Greenville. This is a good sour, but the pumpkin is lacking. It was still good though, for a sour it had great balance not to overpower the pallet. If they kicked up a bit on the pumpkin, this would be beyond good, as it is, I enjoyed it and would try again."

"Great mouthfeel and overall very tasty"

"Put your nose in the glass and it's pretty much all brett,  though there's a spicy clove and pepper accompaniment. And once it hits your lips, that's exactly what you taste (upfront, that is): briny, barnyard funk strikes hard on the palate, providing a crisp first impression. Let that initial shock wash over you and what you find underneath is a solid allspice and butternut flavor, peppered with light ginger notes. The fall flavor isn't subtle, either; it's balanced, sure, but it's there in force. As is the funk. In fact, everything about this beer is bold: the scent, the spice, the pumpkin backbone, even the mouthfeel is big and bright. All in all, it turns out great; it's rare that you find a beer that could pair equally well with both Thanksgiving dinner and a big, stinky slice of Gorgonzola. But once you do - as you'd imagine - it's quite a memorable experience. A gorgeous beer. Cheers!"

"Not getting a ton of Pumpkin or cacao, but a damn fine beer, giving it a .5 deduction for not screaming pumpkin to me, but miles better than most of this ilk. Super refreshing, seems more like a Summer beer, but maybe just a bit past it's prime. I'm results driven & I like/love this!"

"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 8/29/2013. Pours lightly hazy golden orange color with a 2-3 finger dense and rocky off white head with incredible retention, that reduces to a thick cap that lasts. Dense soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of pear, green apple, lemon zest, pumpkin, clove, cinnamon, nutmeg, cocoa, floral, grass, herbal, oak, caramel, toast, light tart funk, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of pumpkin, yeast, malt, and spice notes; with good strength. Taste of pumpkin, pear, green apple, lemon zest, clove, pepper, cinnamon, nutmeg, caramel, toast, light cocoa, herbal, floral, grass, oak, light tart funk, and yeast earthiness. Slight earthy tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of pear, green apple, lemon zest, pumpkin, cinnamon, clove, pepper, nutmeg, caramel, toast, herbal, floral, light cocoa, oak, light funk, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance and complexity of of malt, pumpkin, spice, and yeast ester flavors; with a nice malt/spice balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. High carbonation and medium bodied; with a smooth, crisp, and moderately prickly mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a really excellent Belgian pumpkin ale style. All around great balance and complexity of malt, pumpkin, spice, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on. A very enjoyable offering."

"Bottle: Poured a golden color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and minimal lacing. Aroma consists of sour and tart notes with a hint of cinnamon. Taste is also a dominated by typical JP sour and tart notes with a little bit of a cinnamon hint. Body is quite full with good carbonation. Very enjoyable as I was expecting based on this brewer past effort but I can barely taste all the spices mentioned on the label."
""
"O: I have been looking forwar to this baby for a while being a JP whore but this kinda let me down. Still worth trying if you get a chance to snatch this puppy up but keep your hopes within reach. The spice and sourness is there and I like it but body is lacking. Regardless, I am enjoying this hard to find brew and is gettig better as it warms."
""
""
""
"This beer is terrible. The brewed date was September 2012, so maybe it was skunked, but I got it form a reputable beer store so I assumed it's still good. The smell, taste and feel are nothing like a pumpkin beer and something I'll pass on in the future."

"O - my first offering from Jolly Pumpkin, this was quite complex, had a great nose, and was quite drinkable. Looking forward to more of their brews"
"Overall: This is balanced to the very dry and sour side. Not much spice here, but that may have faded in three years since it was brewed. The sourness likely has increased over time as well. This tastes more like a gueuze from Brussels!"
""
"O: An unexpected smell and flavour on a pumpkin brew with the introduction of bretta. A light and crisp experience that livens the palette, granted it's possible our bottle at 3 yrs old may have a more pronounced bretta profile and weaker spice notes. This brew is a new and creative offering for a pumpkin brew - good for those of us who appreciate a sour."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is my kinda Pumpkin Ale! Sour, dry, funky and spicy. The sour dominates with the pumpkin and spices lingering in the background and finally rounds out the finish with a crisp and snappy tartness. Awesome!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall over half was drain poured and the other half turned into a beer cheese sauce."
""
""
"O - An ok beer. Glad I got to try it once. Not my favorite pumpkin style though. The pumpkin and the sour just dont seem to blend well. In my opinoin it needs a little more pumpkin, spices, and sweetness. I probably wont be getting this beer again."

"Poured into a standard tap a hazed brown infused orange with a thinner off white head atop,kind of a strange color to this.Funky cheese aromas with a hint of pumpkin pie spice,an odd combination but sorta worked.Flavors of barnyard funk and more of the cheese wich isn't my thing,a faint pie spice comes into play.I knew it would be a little funky coming from JP but maybe a little to much of it for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The body is on the light side of medium with a steady, medium level of carbonation. It's clean with a strong crispness that keeps biting, though it's got a good flow to it as well. It's pretty dry all the way through and into a finish with a gently lingering tartness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This one was checking all the right boxes: Presentation, Aroma, Mouthfeel... all fantastic! There is even a lot to like in the taste. It's downfall is its overpowering sweetness and puckering tartness - they ruin the experience! I REALLY wanted to enjoy this beer, but even as sipped the last few ounces of the 750ml bottle, I was caught off-guard by its tartness. If you enjoy sucking on lemons, this is the beer for you - just don't go expecting too much pumpkin."
""
""
""
"Overall, I still don't know how to feel about the beer. It is a sour pumpkin ale. It's a bit hard to grasp even though it is tasty, but even for the unusual take I would have wanted a bit more pumpkin and a bit more robustness. On the side of it being a sour ale I like it quite a bit. If no one told me it had pumpkin I would have a hard time knowing though. I have mixed feelings."

"D - Great pumpkin ale. Good balance of complexity and spices."
"A good Brett beer, but not really a great pumpkin ale. Just slight nuances of pumpkin and spice. This has changed much with age as I remember it being relatively the same fresh. Not something I would purchase again, especially given the higher price tag, but I still look forward to JP beers I have yet to try."
"Overall, I enjoyed this much more than I thought I would. Pumpkin and spice level was low which was nice."
""
"O- Complex and outstanding pumpkin brew, not for everyone because of the sour funk but it sour beers are your thing you will want to try this one. The 6.0% ABV is right on to not take away from the enjoyment of this one either."
""
""
""
""
"O-I am a little let down here, but I suspect that my bottle might be past its prime. The pumpkin and spices are very subtle and the wet earth flavors need a little more tartness to balance out the earthy, stoney taste that dominated this brew. That being said, this is a great looking beer that I will try again if I can get a fresh one."

"Taste is definite spice, almost chai flavor with a bit of nutty malt undertones. Funky tart spice follows with a kick. Really a complex beer - a lot of flavors going on here... and overall pretty tasty. Nice funk characteristics but finishes with a heavier malty body. Nice brew"
"O: There is enough funkiness/sourness to this beer that it is one that you will want to sip over an hour of so but it is a very interesting and enjoyable brew. I like the funkiness but the pumpkin is very subtle in this one."
""
"O: Overall a natural pumpkin puree drink, spicing is balanced just right and kept in check, while there is a unique sourness thrown in for good measure. Number #1 pumpkin? may be a stretch but if your a fan of jolly pumpkin then give it a go for a unique ride."
""
""
"Pours a cloudy amber with hints of brown and yellow - very inviting color. Thick head at por disappates to a good film on top of the beer. Fine, creamy carbonation. Smells typical sour - nice, but difficult to discern other aromas. Flavor is excellent - subtle pumpkin and spices up front, followed by a strong sour with a hint of chocolate."
""
""
""
"I picked this brew up with my wife, at a Great beer store, while on a little outing. The beer pours a muted gold color, from a large bottle. Fairly nonexistent head. The aroma is Belgian....yeast and spice, some funk and some fruit. Not much pumpkin in the aroma, but a defined vegetal character. The taste is very balanced. I like the slight acidity...it adds some dimension to the brew. The body is medium in heft and the brew is very drinkable."
"Recommended, but not at $15/750ml. It's a unique pumpkin ale, not all spice or over the top. Not sugary and very enjoyable. This would be a great brew for Halloween in a tropical climate."
""
""
""
""
"Beer is medium to medium-light in body, with medium to medium-high level carbonation that foams the beer somewhat substantially across the palate, creating a mouthfeel that is at first fizzy, then smooth and foamy for the remaining amount of time this lingers on the palate. Closes semi-dry, with little bitterness and slight stickiness across the palate."
""
""
"O- This beer was a lot better than I expected. One of the more sour jolly pumpkins I've tried, but is also a great example of a pumpkin beer. The fruit is there as well as the spice, but are complemented by a dry tart finish that makes this one of the better pumpkin beers on the market. Awesome."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, the pumpkin character was pretty subtle. Definitely more of a farmhouse than a pumpkin ale."
"Overall this is a very nice beer. I scores so highly because of it being a Pumpkin Ale. As a wild ale, it's only above average. Still, this is the way I wish most all pumpkin ales would be: refreshing and quaffable (because of the acidity and dryness) instead of a spicy slog to get through."
"Hazy orange under a frothy white head. Smells of fresh pumpkin flesh, funk, tart fruit, lemon, and mellow spices. Mmmm...autumn in a bottle for me. Tart, mildly spiced, cider, and balancing malt flavors. A nice, well-constructed blend of flavors. Smooth, lightly sour, dry, with a slightly chalky texture. A very satisfying and drinkable funky pumpkin ale. I like it..."
""
""
""
"This pours a ruddy toasted golden-straw with light foaming. There’s an aroma which is initially off-putting, as it is unexpected and unlike anything I would think of for a pumpkin ale. But, alas, this is no mere pumpkin ale. The aroma is tart, slightly sour, with some vegetal notes that develop as it warms. It’s lightly bodied, with a flavor that has slight hints of pumpkin and pumpkin spices with some light clove, nutmeg and allspice nuances that dance around the palate. Gently carbonated it doesn’t feel heavy, and it finishes dry. Initially I thought it infected slightly, but once the chill goes away and the aromas and flavors come into greater balance I realized it’s the magical mystery of yeast, barrel-aging and the brew itself coming together. As I spent time with this brew I grew to appreciate and enjoy it immensely."

"O: Overall, this is a really solid beer. Not a traditional pumpkin crusher and I really enjoy Jolly Pumpkin's interpretation of this usually hit-or-miss style. They nailed this one with a nice twist of funk!"
""
""
"O:I wasn't expecting to get blown away, but this is an amazing example of an """outside the box""" sour. Does everything just right. the balance and flavors are downright perfect, neither one outshines the other and I felt like I was getting just enough of each flavor every time I took a sip. For the pumpkin and sour beer lover, pick this one up, you won't be disappointed."
""
"With a great barrel-beer I tend to forget the base: The malt bill and hop order. This beer has a smooth mouthfeel, light but lingering bitter finish. I appreciate the lower abv. and think more alcohol would have made this too sharp. La Parcela has great malic sourness, orange pithiness, marigold leaf. Restraint plus highly evolved wood equals a pinnacle of refreshment. This could have come from a Belgian valley. Fantastic! Superb! """highly evolved""""

"Drink- Well I was thinking this would be a bit more layered. A bit one-sided but thats okay. Its a sour pumpkin beer thats a year old. I would love a fresher bottle but I think even with decay to pumpkin a nice sour came out. Rating to how I liked it vs. style on this one."
""
"Edit: It's been a while since I've written this review, so After having it again. I have to up the rating slightly. It's such a nice refreshing break from the overly spiced pumpkin beers. Taste is so pleasant and is easily drinkable."
""
""
"D - not the home run I've come to expect from Jolly Pumpkin; I would have liked to have tasted this beer a little younger and closer to its source, and while it's a welcome departure from many other pumpkin ales, it seems a little more befitting of the spring - or best, an Indian summer - rather than the fall. Still, a quite good beer."
""
"a sour pumpkin beer? it was only a matter of it. i opened this with much excitement. it poures a hazy pale orange color, with a one inch head made of tiny white bubbles. it lasts quite awhile too. the nose is very strange, sour and acidic like lacto at first, then a smooth sweet vibe from the cacao, and finally tart pumpkins, almost composty if you didnt know what sour beer was. its taste is also very different. theres a bit more spice, cinnamon for sure, and the pumpkin flavor is more pronounced than in the smell. smooth feel, again i think from the addition of cacao, which is an interesting additive in a beer. there is a little vinegar taste in the finish, but it matches up well with the sweet component. great carbonation and enough body for a fall beer. ive definitely never had anything like this, and it grew on me as i drank through it. definitely search this out if you dig pumpkin ales."
"O- Great beer all around and a wonderful take on the pumpkin beer style. This really mixes it up in this season of pumpkin beers with all spice, and cinnamon."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I really liked this. For the price I'll never get it again but I was glad to try it this once"
""
""
""
""
"Cheers!"
"O-a very complex beer that is nicely sour. Actually I bet if I gave this to someone and had them taste it, I bet they wouldn't realize it's a pumpkin beer. It could have a bit more robustness to it, but it'd be difficult to make a better pumpkin sour."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Overall I have dove head-first into the sour trend and therefore really liked this one. Hints if pumpkin made me even happier, but you simply can't go into this one thinking you're drinking a """pumpkin beer""""
"Was pretty excited to try but excitement ended rather quickly. Nice color and smell but could taste hardly any pumpkin. Very sour and bitter after taste. Expected better from Jolly Pumpkin especially at an $11.99 price tag. Out of all the pumpkin beers I have had this year this at the bottom of the list."
""
"I bought the 750 mL bottle here last Sunday. The ale was bottle on 9-14-2011. The ale had a nice aromatic smell and the color I expected. The taste however, I did not find appeasing. It tasted more cider like rather than an ale to be truthful. It was very sour not what youd expect from a pumpkin ale. So if youre not a fan of sours, I would not recommend."
""
""
"O-Very interesting take on a pumpkin ale, I'm a big fan of sours so I enjoyed it but I could see where some people may have wanted a bit more pumpkin characteristic to it"
"Likely the best pumpkin beer that I've had. I'm not normally a fan of them, but it's jolly pumpkin and I'm not all too surprised that I enjoyed it. The beer being a year old added some complexity and the funk notes really came out more."
""
"O-Very disappointing on almost all fronts. The very essence of pumpkin is often misconstrued as a sweet and sugary taste, which often eliminates the more earthly elements of the fruit. To me, La Parcela takes that misconception and puts it on steroids. I will not be purchasing this again."
""
""
""
"fairly simple. It gives you a good tartness but not much else. Fades quickly and bitter. Will do as a fix, but would not seek it out again. Looks decent, smells tart but there is simply no complexity. No malt sweetness and a mildly unpleasant bitter finish."
""
""
""
""
"Overall a nice beer but a bit of a dissapointment. I was really hoping for some pumpkin flavor but the sourness of this beer really dominates. There is a bitterness at the end that seems to not compliment the other flavor notes. I've had better from JP."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: Gawd I love some Jolly Pumpkin. As with all of their ales, they never disappoint. Glad to have tried a Jolly Pumpkin with actual pumpkin in it! Must try!"

"1pt bottle.Tumbler glass.Enjoyed on jun´11. Orangish amber in color.Foggy,showing sediments in suspension.Off white creamy froth.Small bubbled crown.Fairly well retention.Lacing rings are left.Apple,grape & piney hop aromas.Humid wood too.Sweet tartar upfront.Offers slightly diacetil notes.Quite peppery.Fruity & crispy palate.Light body,high carbonation.Harsh mouthfeel.Acidic apricot finish.Dry & fruity aftertaste.Good drinkability.Refreshing.Very well balanced flavors."

"Very enjoyable sour. Only wish i could taste a little more pumpkin"
"This beer pours a medium bodied dirty orangish amber in color with a barely there creamy white lacing. The nose features plenty of apple cider, spice, coriander, cinnamon, and more cider with a touch of vinegar and a nice creamy tartness. I love the nose. It's all very well integrated. The flavors too are very cider heavy. You get plenty of apple, cinnamon, orange peels, nutmeg, some mild bitterness, and a finishing acetic sour/mild tartness. I like it a lot. It drinks lighter with plenty of carbonation and leaves almost an apple skin like flavor in the after taste. Overall this is a fine sour. It has fall written all over it, despite a lack of pumpkin influence. I say this is really an American wild ale. The spices actually worked with the apple skins to create an authentic autumn time sour beer. Well done JP!"
""
""
""
"Overall it was a really tasty beer. Not something you would expect out of a pumpkin beer, but with it being JP, the funk was sure to be there. Good drinkability."
""
""
"Overall a descent brew. Just don't expect to taste any pumpkin."
""
"Overall:	Not a chugging beer but a nice sipper."
""
""
""
""
"O: I like sours so this is good, I should have drank it sooner but it's pretty tasty as is."
"This is the Nightmare before Xmas of beers in every way. Quirky. Identifiable. Warm sour. Pumpkin-y."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Cloudy orange amber with a brown tint. Small off white head. Mildly sour, hint of pumpkin spice, brett. Nice light sour flavor. Hint of pumpkin spice, brett. Medium body with modest carbonation. This is a nice easy sour. The price on a 750 is a bit much but on tap it's a solid deal per glass."
""
""
"O- very different but very tasty beer, you get a nice pumpkin beer without feeling like you're drinking liquid pumpkin pie, highly recommend for the fall and winter holidays"
"After sampling this again, it's definitely closer to a wild ale than a pumpkin, which is perfectly appropriate for a Jolly Pumpkin brew. A nice change-up to the normally rich and weighty holiday ales."
""
""
""
""
""
"I actually really enjoyed this, but because I love sours. It doesn't work that well within the Pumpkin Ale style parameters. But I guess that's its strength--it pushes boundaries."
""
"I think I just went into this one with the totally wrong expectation. I didn't know what to expect from a pumpkin beer from Jolly Pumpkin, but this is probably pretty close to what I should have imagined-more of a Pumpkin Lambic than a pumpkin ale. The rustic, earthy, yeasty funk flavors actually serve as a nice foil to the pumpkin flavors and the light spicing. I was slightly disappointed that the cacao didn't really come through, but keeping it in mind as a pumpkin wild ale, it was actually pretty good."
""
"The powdery dry character and highly phenolic taste of Jolly Pumpkin ales give them their house character, but this slightly maltier or starchier example balances as well as any in their arsinal."
""

"Pours a clear light orange with a 1 inch foamy white head that settles to a thin cap. Foamy chunks and rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of biscuit-like malt, spices, and some fruity aromas. Taste is of biscuit-like malt, spices, and some fruity pumpkin flavors. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and clean mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good pumpkin ale that is much different from others I have tried in the past. This beer is not really that funky/sour like other Jolly Pumpkin beers but I still am impressed with this one."
"Overall Impression- Very complexed but can I rate this as a Pumpkin? I will give it a decent grade all around but almost shows more signs of being a Lambic or Gueuze rather than a Pumpkin Ale. I’ve heard many people raving about this so went for it. If you get a chance I would go for it but only if your a fan of sour brews."
""
"Overall, pretty tasty sour with a pumpkin kick"
"O- The nice light tart beer has good depth and a gentle funk to it. None of the pumpkin, spice or cacao stood out but it did have lots of subtle layers that these probably contributed too."
""
""
""
""
""
"The feel of this beer is smooth with some nice drinkable feel that has some interesting flavor and some interesting crispness that is almost like a larger if it were a little bigger. This ends up being quite an amazing beer and not just another pumpkin beer. This is something that is really different from the pack."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a very tasty beer. Seems misplaced as a pumpkin ale because so little pumpkin flavor comes through. It is very tasty, though."

"I had a difficult time finishing it."
""
"This beer pours a nice hazy orange amber color. There is a nice finger of white head resting on top. The head has good retention, and it leaves some scattered lace behind on the glass. The nose has some tartness to it and some light fall spice aromas. There is a little bit of funk here, as well as some light fruits, and a little bit of pumpkin. The taste follows the nose pretty well. It starts off with some nice tart fruitiness and a mild amount of fall spices. The pumpkin is here but it is definitely on the subtle side. There is some funk and a little bit of spice too. The finish leaves some lingering spice, and fruit flavor behind on the palate, as well as a little bit of funk. This has a medium body and pretty good carbonation. It goes down easy and has a nice smooth feel to it. There is a bit of a tingly feel from the spices and a bit of funk. This has good drinkability. It has nice flavor and goes down well. I could easily have a few glasses of this. Overall, I think this is a good beer, but I think it is too light on the fall spices and pumpkin flavor. It just doesn't really feel too much like a season beer to me. It is good, and worth trying out though. Cheers."
"Overall: A delightful sour beer. Not overly sour, just tart enough to make your mouth pucker. I don't get any pumpkin and the cacoa and spices are very subtle. Drinkability is high. Well done."

"O: Thank God Jolly Pumpkin decided to try a different take on the Pumpkin Ale. Other than a few Imperial Pumpkin ales that used different bases for theirs, the style has become pretty mundane. Now here comes a sour pumpkin... GENIUS! Very easy drinking and would make an excellent introduction to those trying to get into sours. All around and excellent sour although mild with hints of an ACTUAL pumpkin flavor along with cherry and apple."

"Overall, a really nice and complex sour. Jolly Pumpkin beers never cease to amaze me. The balance and funk of this beer is really nice. Really easy to drink. I will be seeking this out again."

"Overall: I wasn't expecting the sourness but it was pleasent. Not too strong or overwhelming by any means. Definitely a diferent type of pumpkin beer. Cheers!"
"Brew pours a dirty and dull yellow golden color under a creamy head. A great lacing ensues. Nose carries a mild and brisk sweet herbal citrus aroma. Mouthfeel is of pleasantly sour (not too tart) citrus rind that delivers into a dry and bright wild berry finish with ending notes of cherry, green grapes, and what might be some subtle earthy raw pumpkin. Cheers, to something different amongst the pumpkin category! Sour lovers, this might be right up your alley..."
"This is an interesting spin on a pumpkin beer. Refreshing. Pumpkin spices are there but not overpowering. The signature JP tartness adds another interesting element that keeps me coming back for more."
"O: a pretty decent beer, though I wouldn't call it a pumpkin ale. It's more of a saison or wild ale. Still, it's tasty and refreshingly tart."
"I guess I'd say that this is pretty weak in terms of a pumpkin beer. Not an aweful lot of pumpkin involved, unfortunately. It is a good sour to introduce nubs to sour beers."
"This is a dry and tart offering with a crispness to the finish that makes it easy to go back for more. It is medium bodied and modestly carbonated. I guess if you were expecting the typical pumpkin offering here you would be very dissapointment. However, in true JP fashion I found this to be wild and enjoyable."
"My wife thinks its okay. I'm finding it difficult to finish."
"Overall: I don't really pick up any pumpkin, but it's a decent sour. That being said, I would go for another one of their offerings before I went back to this one."
"Overall - Definitely an interesting take, but still I'd rather have a pumpkin ale and a saison separate instead of together. My wife isn't into anything sour and immediately turned her nose up at it."
"Overall: This really should be classified as a Wild Ale, as that clearly takes precedent over the pumpkin and spices. Either way, this is a great and very refreshing beer."
"Muddy yellow-brown pour with a small white head. What remains of the head laces nicely down the side of my glass. The aroma is full of spices, pumpkin, gingerbread, very malty. Taste follow the smell, with some light pumpkin, emphasis on the spice, but not without a nice balance. The body is light to medium and very bubbly. Aftertaste is dry. I thought this was nothing special in terms of pumpkin ales. Tasty, but not worth the price."
"Lets be honest, Jolly Pumpkin is a great brewery but as of late, all their beers seem to taste the same, save a few. They're all dominated by the tart and funky nature of their beers that I don't think let the underlying flavors come through like they should. Enjoyable, drinkable but you'd never know this is supposed to be a Pumpkin Ale."
"O-I would rate this higher if I were reviewing this as a wild ale. I was hoping for a pumpkin fix and got something else. Decent beer otherwise."
"O/D - Jolly Pumpkin beers are always fun to taste because they are so unique in terms of style and flavor. I really liked this beer but I really couldn't find much in the way of pumpkin characteristics."
"D - Strange beer. A lot of JP funk with just hints of anything else. Still enjoyable."
"I would not describe this as a Pumpkin Ale. Forget about pumpkin and enjoy the Wild Ale for what it is."
"Light body with minimal carbonation, but still very refreshing. Really easy and enjoyable to drink. An interesting beer, though the pumpkin seems to be an afterthought for a nice wild ale."
"this is good, could be a bit better with more flavor. i will however have no issues finishing this."
"O - Not what I expected, but very golf. Had I known it was going to be a sour, I wouldn't have tries to enjoy it with a pumpkin pie."
"If you want to try a sour pumpkin, then give this a shot."
"I had a bottle of this last week that said it was bottled in 2009. I enjoyed that one a bit more and thought the flavors were more pronounced so maybe I'll pick up another bottle of this to age."
"Served on tap, presented in a 9 oz. wine glass, this beer was a hazy coppery-orange color with a small, wispy, white head, that left pretty much no lacing at all. I got very little aroma from this beer, but still, there were traces of funky yeast, light spice, and a gently breadiness, with a touch of apple skin. I was expecting something much more sour with this, but it was pretty mild and approachable in the taste actually. Grassy to be sure, woody, with hints of apple, peach, and lemon pith, a little barnyard funk, with a easy tartness that didn't make me flinch for even a second. Mildly spicy. I really got little to no pumpkin from this at all. Light-medium mouthfeel, and pretty drinkable, though there was a little twang in the aftertaste that just didn't sit right. Still nice overall."
"A really refreshing change in the Pumpkin Ale monotony. I'd highly recommend this to anyone who appreciates JP's other offerings."
"Although I'd like a little more flavor in this, it's a really nice twist on the pumpkin ale style. I'm glad it's in the mix."
"a light and effervescent drink, with only a touch of dry malt to hold it down. the pumpkin is basically undetectable (though i anticipate it will go well with my butternut squash dinner!), and so is cacao. the oak is accounted for as promised. a fair proportion of drier malt flavors: biscuit/breadcrust. hop contribution is welcome and effective"
"Pours a brown/amber color, with almost zero head and little carbonation. Very cloudy in appearance. Nose is a little underwhelming, but not bad. The main things I get are a little funk, tartness, and squash, as well as a couple spices. Taste is about the same as the nose profile, but it's SO weak. Almost nothing to this beer, tastewise. Feel is thin and fizzy. Overall, this is by far the most disappointing brew I've had from this brewery (and I'm a fan). I don't think I'll look for this one again- I'll stick w/ some of their better brews."
"Cheers."
"The body is light with somewhat sharp carbonation. Overall this is a pretty good wild ale. Not sure how it stands up as a pumpkin ale however. Either way it tasty."
"This is enjoyable. It's just a Jolly Pumpkin wild ale with a bit of a pumpkin aftertaste."
"Bottled 8/20/10. Pours a hazy amber color with a large off-white head that slowly diminishes. Scent is typical JP funk with a lot of pepper and spice. The cacao is very faint, as well as the pumpkin. Taste is Wow! Much more sour than I was expecting. I always expect some tartness from JP's beers, but this one has a lot. Autumn spices blended with funky sour farmhouse flavors. As the beer warms, the pumpkin spices come through very slightly. Nice bread flavors as well. Mouthfeel is very light and highly carbonated. Could be a little less airy. Drinkability is high. Overall, this is a very tasty pumpkin beer, although I feel that people who love pumpkin beers will not like this one."
"Overall, this is an amazing pumpkin beer which is incredibly balanced and easy to drink.  Love it."
"Cheers!"
"Figured I'd try all the pumpkin beers at my disposal while they're here, so that means a probably sour one should be mixed in with all the spicy others. This one pours a cloudy auburn-amber topped by a finger or so of dirty white foam. The nose comprises lemon zest, nutmeg, clove, light banana peel, honeydew, tart pineapple, blood orange, and a touch of honey. The taste hols notes of melon rind, lightly sour grapefruit rind, pumpkin shell, lemon zest, iceberg lettuce, clove, and a hint of white wine grape. The melon and pumpkin rinds seem to overpower everything else, destroying any hope of spicing and even o'ertaking the sour aspects, which don't even try to resist being drowned out. The body is a limpid medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a slightly oily feel. Overall, this beer just missed the mark for me. There was definitely a pumpkin character, but it was all rind, and it conspired with the melon flavors to destroy pretty much everything else. Not a big fan, here..."
"3.0 D: Atrocious pumpkin beer and a solidly mediocre wild. JP makes some good beer, but this isn't one of them. Terrible price as well ($13)."
"O: Light and decent flavors but there was just something about this beer that I didn’t quite love. Worth a taste though."
"D- While I really enjoyed the beer and feel its very drinkable, I would say it poorly depicts pumpkin ales, but still good"
"Overall this was an interesting beer, likely much better fresh. It was predictably Jolly Pumpkin, which is both refreshing and a bit of a bore. I would have preferred more of everything in this beer, and less (much less) brett."
"Poured a golden brown, with some brown/black floaties in there. Huge fluffy white head, and solid lacing - great looking minus the floaties. Nose is typical JP, sour lemon and wheat. Some moderate spicing (nutmeg perhaps), but no real pumpkin character to speak of. Taste has more sour lemon, and some less notable 'autumn' flavours, but again nothing distinctly pumpkin. Spicing comes through in the finish, no cacao like the label indicates. Light feel, high carbonation. Moderate but not distinct enjoy to be thoroughly enjoyable. More tart than the Panil Barrique (Italy Version) when tasted side by side."
"O: Where this kinda failed as a pure pumpkin/yam beer, it totally rocked as a sour aile to me. I would definitely pick this up again."
"proves to be a bit richer and more balanced in the bottle. Malt character is more developed and there is more of a graduation in flavor in the feel as the mineral rich backbone sort of subsides and creates some awesome tone. Sour tart as expected with a floral perfume like sour... This is backed with a mild pumpkin, japanese yam quality. There is some nutmeg and autumn applo but its more refreshing then bread and overspicing. Very food particular. I would have it with teriyaki. More balance as in allows for spice to come through."
"O - This beer blew me away. Shattered my expectations. This is not so much a pumpkin ale, as it is a saison to enjoy during the colder months. It aged very well too. Perhaps the pumpkin and spice is more noticeable the fresher it gets? I hope so, and I plan on finding a bottle of this years batch to compare."
"Ken's bomber.Where is the pumpkin? Spicey smell is muted, without a trace of the pumpkin."
"O - This is a very interesting beer to say the least, very different from most pumpkin ales. The heavy spice and high alcohol are traded for a more aged, tart flavor in the pumpkin. Definitely try if you get the chance!"
"Overall, ranks among the top five JP brews I’ve had. Plenty of sweet and pumpkin ale flavors to classify as a pumpkin ale, with a smooth, balanced complexity between funk and pumpkin."
"Overall, a really strange beer that I'm glad I tried but I wouldn't buy again."
"Overall, I was a bit disappointed based on the price and the use of the word """pumpkin""" in the name. However, if you're into sours, you might like this one."
"O - This is a wonderful beer I love the tartness thats in Jolly Pumpkin beers for a pumpkin beer it would be nice if the pumpkin was stronger and the body was thickened up some but over all I really enjoyed this beer its worth picking up if you see it around"
"Bottle from 08/2010 thanks to nishino. Dark chestnut color with a huge head, looks enticing. The first whiff off the bottle is funky. The aromas from the glass are spicy and a little Brett but no distinct pumpkin or cinnamon, smells good though. The mouthfeel was outstanding, felt like a cask beer, rich, creamy, smooth. The flavor had a bit of spice but was heavy on the JP funk. It was very, very slightly sour but didn't make me pucker. Overall I really enjoyed this."
"O- Jolly Pumpkin makes a good beer..almost always. This beer was good but there was almost no pumpkin quality to this. This of course doesn't say I didn't like it but I just wish there was a little more pumpkin to it. A nice beer in its own just not quite to the style I thought it should be."
"Overall, this isn't something I'd seek out more than once. Interesting though."
"JP- A funk like none other, thanks."
"O: If you like sour beers or other Jolly Pumpkin beers than this is for you, but not to my liking"
"Drinkability is ok, nothing special, an average wild ale, nothing really stands out from the other JPs with similar malt base. I won't bother buying again. If I want a wild ale, I want more funk and no gourde. If I want a pumpkin ale, I want a richer, maltier base, and distinct pumpkin flavors!"
"750 ml bottle, batch 611, bottled 8/18/2010. Served in a pint glass, the brew pours a hazy orange/amber color with a 2 inch frothy off-white head theat stayed around a long time. There's also a decent amount of lacing. Well, I don't smell any pumpkin in this beer. It smells like tart apples, funk, lemon peel, and some nutmeg (which I don't notice until after the beer has been opened for a while). Taste is just like the aroma, it's mostly sour and funky until the beer has warmed up more and then the pumpkin spices are a little bit noticable. Mouthfeel/body is medium, and it has high but soft carbonation which helps makes this easy to drink. Overall I think it's a good beer, even though it's pricey at $12.99 a bottle. Maybe I should try this fresher next time, even though I liked it just fine with some age on it."
"This was not an easy translation, but it seems as though La Parcela means The Patch. As in pumpkin patch, presumably. My view is that this seasonal brew needs a pretty massive patch of a different sort, since it's one flat tire of a pumpkin ale. Ease off the wild yeast already."
"Pours a slightly hazed copper color, moderate plume of off white bubbles, short lasting with little retention. Beneath the first sour, tart and funky scents lies a hint of vegtable, apple/grape scents and mild spicing. Taste breings a decent amount of pumpkin - very vegetal and dull, not sweet pumpkin pie - the tart and funk take over and the beer finnishes with touches of fruit and spice. Lighter side of medium bodied, nice carbonation (used to the bottle condioned versions having very high levels), dry. A nice take on the pumpkin beer which focuses on the natural flavor of the vegtable with that typical Jolly Pumpkin mild tart, sour and funkyness."
"Verdict - While I was let down by the fact that this was supposed to Jolly Pumpkin's true pumpkin beer and it tasted very little like pumpkin; I was still impressed with balanced sour lemongrass and slight earthy gourd notes. I easily downed this bottle in no time at all and enjoyed every drop."
"Drinkability: Very ho-hum, didn't finish it and moved on. Certainly not Jolly Pumpkin's top offering"
"Drinkability is moderate to good, as this definitely has some unique flavor combinations going on that may take some time to get used to."
"D: A very tasty beer, and an interesting take on a Pumpkin beer... which is what I would expect from a brewery like JP. Definitely worth seeking out."
"The mouthfeel is on the lighter side with carbonation being high. It feels very crisp and light overall. Drinkability is good, it had some nice flavors to it overall. Had I been expecting a typical pumpkin ale I'd be disappointed. Knowing that was more like an American Wild going in helped my appreciation of it. Pretty nice beer overall."
"Poured from a $18 bomber (the most I paid when evaluating oktoberfest/autumn beers) into dimpled mug. I expected more out of this highly-touted pumpkin beer. Pours a nice golden orange with a small white head with a small amount of sediment floating around. Big aroma consisting of pumpkin, sour yeast, spices (nutmeg, cloves, coriander), with an almost mentholated funk. Largely tart flavor, minerals, grassy upfront with the pumpkin flavors subtlety lingering behind a large layer of funk. Acidic and somewhat hopppy. High level of carbonation usher in spices and funk that roll into an acidic finish."
"Pours a pillowy four finger off-white head that fades very slowly leaving a good lace. Cloudy amber color with a ton of yeast left in bottle. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Nose is tart spices and flavor is tart, spicy with some pumpkin, like a mellow farmhouse ale - not the usual pumpkin pie ale. Beyond expensive at $18.50 for a 750ml bottle from Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, ME. Batch 610, bottled 8-20-2010."
"Overall, a refreshingly different take on pumpkin ale. Doesn't have the usual malty and pie spice flavors, or the same thick mouth feel at all. The real criticism is that the pumpkin flavors and aromas are next to absent, so I'm having a hard time with it being categorized with the others. If I didn't know that it is actually brewed with real pumpkin, I'd just assume it was a farmhouse/saison style ale."
"Overall this is a quality beer, but I was definitely a bit underwhelmed."
"A Jolly Pumpkin pumpkin beer, how appropriate. Pours a vibrant orangey gold amber with a nice fluffy white head, nice retention as with most JP beers. The aroma has that trademark subtle oaky brett funk, rounded out by a nice mellow sweet squash notes and a mild spice. Man, this is how pumpkin beers should be. I must say I am not a fan of the glut of pumpkin beers that are around in the fall, but this is excellent. It's got just the right amount of spice, hints and wisps of clove, allspice, nutmeg, and actual pumpkin. These are accents to a nice base of a slightly sour, very refreshing, pale malt style ale. Rounded out by oak and a funky bite. Excellently dry on the palate. Definitely the new benchmark for the style in my opinion - never would've thought that funk and pumpkin would go so well together."
"Drinkability: Those grumbling for ever less pumpkin and less spice character should consider giving this one a try, as both are virtually absent, at least in Batch 610. As always, it's another weird, wild ride from Jolly Pumpkin."
"CHEERS"
"D: This one's not for me and not what I would consider a good representation of a Pumpkin Ale. If this was labeled an American Wild it would have probably been a different story."
"Very interesting, and very unique. I wouldn't say it's my favorite beer, but it's something different than anything I've had before, and the overall it's well constructed and surprisingly enjoyable."
"D - Okay, but a little too much spice flavors. They just don't mix well with the tart/funky flavors also going on, and the flavors linger a little too long into the finish."
"Takes a little getting used to, but pretty good overall. I can the find the pumpkin ale in it if I concentrate, but it's like they took one aspect of it & really emphasized it. Good, but one is satisfying."
"D- This is a really cool and different beer. Enjoying the 750 mL bomber by yourself is not hard to do, but I feel this would be better splitting with someone. Kind of is like a mix of a Saison, a Wild Ale, and a Pumpkin Ale."
"Beer pours s beautiful burnt orange with an ever so slightly off-white head that dissipates ever so slowly leaving nice lacing and a perfect thin layer on top of the beer. Definitely looks like a pumpkin ale and a nice one at that. Smell starts as a tart apple and follows with a scent of pumpkin pie that mixes fresh pumpkin with nutmeg, allspice, and light cinnamon. I also get a light caramel note that is very nice and adds just the right amount of sweetness to balance the tart and spicy aroma. The taste is sour apple with a light hit of vinegar upfront, but it's followed a very nice bit of mild pumpkin that adds a little balance in the middle of the sip. The beer finishes dry and sour but in a very mild drinkable way. The sourness is definitely there, but not kicking you in the face like some beers do. Again, a very nice balance throughout the beer leading to a very drinkable sour beer that i keep going back to for sip after sip. I hope jolly pumpkin makes this one again next fall, as i will be grabbing a few of them."
"Bottle from December Santa Cruz tasting. Pours a light bronze color with a large off-white head. Good retention and spackled lace chunks. Acetic aroma with obvious pumpkin pie spice notes. Flavor is much the same; very tart and vinegary notes cut by cocoa and nutmeg sweetness. There's also a pumpkin flesh note. Pretty interesting."
"overall a nice light sour that had some good dimensions to it. a definite change of pace for me and one i am glad i got to try."
"D: Certainly enjoyable and quite different from what one might expect from a pumpkin ale, but exactly what you would expect from Jolly Pumpkin."
"Jolly pumpkin finally makes a pumpkin ale and it's different then anybody else. A very delicious and approachable sour that is not vinegary and will not rip your teeth enamel off. Seek it out!"
"D - as a beer, solid. as a pumpkin beer, not so much. kudos to Jolly Pumpkin for giving this a shot, but (for better or worse) it doesnt really fit into the style. bring a friend."
"Overall: Not much pumpkin on this 2009 bottle. Pretty enjoyable."
"D: This is my kind of pumpkin beer! My only complaint is that I wish there was a slightly more prominent pumpkin flavor. Overall, very good though."
"I can't detect much pumpkin in it. Of course I wouldn't question anything my main peeps from Jolly Pumpkin do because whatever else this is, it's a refreshing and unique take on the style and what's more, it's a damn fine drinking beer."
"It's a good beer from a great brewery, who have certainly carved (hoho) an interesting niche for themselves. A very unique take on the pumpkin ale style, and one that really shows what you can do with it. Lovely."
"Poured a murky golden orange with yellow highlights that had a half finger of head and left some bubbly lacing sticking to the glass. I could definitely detect the pumpkin but it was quite funky from the brett character with slight spice notes cinnamon, and brown sugar notes; really intresting nose. The taste was also a mash up of brettyy oaky funky pumpkin flavors with all spice, cinnamon, and brown sugar accents but had tart slight acidic notes. The brew was medium in body with a good amount of prickly carbonation which had a oaky, funky, spice, tart, and prickly bubbly finish. It drank really good and was well balanced between the pumpkin flavors and the bretty funk qualities. I'm glad I got to try this elusive pumpkin beer."
"D: I'm sort of a sucker for Jolly Pumpkin beers, so I was pretty sure I would like this. Not sure if it's worth the price, but I enjoyed it."
"This is a highly drinkable pumpkin beer. It is tasting to me as good as some of the best Belgian fruit beers. I like the taste and the fact that it is a low ABV at 6%. A highly sessionable ale."
"D: I'm a huge fan of JP's ales, and this one is no exception. I'd class it as more of a sour rather than in the vegetable/spice/herb class. The pumpkin is muted and the sour really overshadows it."
"Drinkability: I definitely liked this beer the more I drank it. The alcohol is concealed well and it is quite refreshing. If it wasn't expensive I would drink it quite often."
"Typical Jolly Pumpkin beer (for better or worse)- lots of tangy sourness up front that obscure the other ingredients a bit, you have to wait for the finish for the other notes to shine through. Pours amber with some cloudiness and a fair number of suspended particles which definitely makes it a bit murky. Smells tart, with some spice notes that develop and some apple. The taste is similar, quite tart with green apple notes up front, along with some sharp spiciness that develops further toward the finish, and finally some creamy cocoa and nutmeg notes at the very end. Tart and crisp, but with a touch of creaminess at the end. Not bad, but you can't tell it's a pumpkin beer."
"D: Pretty impressive, very very different, but they finally brewed a pumpkin beer, and it has the brettanomyces and oak flavors that highlight all of their beers."
"This was isn't bad at all and offers something familiar to Jolly Pumpkins fans."
"D-Certainly an easy drinker for those looking for a Holiday ale to share with friends."
"Pours a bright, clear orange with about an inch of brilliant white, foamy head that leaves attractive, sticky lacing. The nose is overwhelmed by the musty funkiness of Jolly Pumpkin's signature yeast strain, which is one of the most distinctive and unique in American craft brewing. Some balsamic vinegar acidity peeks through, and just the slightest trace of pumpkin pie spice. First impressions do not indicate that this beer contains pumpkin. The first sip of this beer may throw you for a loop, as it's surprisingly sweet for a Jolly Pumpkin beer. You're hit with a burst of intense brown sugar and toffee sweetness that disappears almost instantly, revealing a crisp, sharp funkiness that fades into light pumpkin pie spice and hints of mild pumpkin sweetness. The back end is subtly tart. The mouthfeel is light to medium bodied, with prickly, invigorating carbonation"
"Probably the most drinkable example of the style I've tried: simultaneously rich and refreshing. Rating to style, this is a great achievement."
"Drinkability: Not bad and it's a nice seasonal treat that I was happy to get a hold of. This is one that I don't think that I would want to try to age as I feel the spiciness would fade out too much and it would become a bit boring. Nice flavors that keep it interesting and a solid, fun mouthfeel... While it's not something that I would reach for on a daily basis, it's definitely something I'll look forward to again."
"D- Easy drinker, the sour aspect takes some away as well as the funky aspects, but wow. If you are looking for a traditional spiced pumpkin ale, I suggest walking away from this one. If you are instead tired of a lot of the boring pumpkin ales out there, don't hesitate to grab this one."
"2010 bottle. Pours a clear rosy peach orange with lots of bubbles flying around and a thick white head. Nose is very typical Jolly Pumpkin house funk, of course a good dose of oak, tart apples, maybe some light cinnamon or allspice. There actually is a nice pumpkin tone in the flavor that I wasn't expecting, as I thought this would pretty much be an exact replica of Fuego del Otono. Pumpkin comes across with a light sweetness, balanced by a light sour oak and spices. As I expected, light flavor profile, non-offensive, though not exciting to me. Standard for the recent Jolly Pumpkin batches, just not the same rich barrel presence and flavor expressions of years past."
"Medium body, dry, almost puckering sour at times. Lively drinking, bright flavor and probably the first pumpkin beer I actually liked. Lower abv is nice too, allowing the tart and flavor to shine without any alcohol warmth."
"D: The tartness and spices in this beer make it one that probably needs to be sipped."
"Overall, a good beer, but could have been better,"
"The beer has a medium body and just enough carbonation to make this feel good in my mouth. It isn't as carbed as other JP offerings that literally jump out of the bottle. The beer is very drinkable, but I can't help but wonder if this is a trick. While I enjoyed this, I can imagine JP would do much, much better with this beer if they abandoned the """less is more""" routine for one seasonal. To me, a seasoned beer drinker, this is a treat to be savored. To an average beer drinker taking a chance on a beer described as having spices and cacao nibs, this may be a dissapointment"
"D - This was a very pleasant surprise. Funky pumpkin beer...gotta love it. A somewhat unique take on the pumpkin beer. Very interesting and enjoyable...pretty easy drinker with lots of character."
"D: Interesting beer for sure. I got more of a classic JP beer compared to a pumpkin beer; this is nowhere near as overt as most pumpkin beers on the market. But it is tasty, and with the dearth of pumpkin beers in CA, it was certainly nice to see another one."
"drinkability - flavorful, a bit unique for a pumpkin beer"
"Drinkability: Definitely going to pick up another bottle of this. Not the typical overly sweet pumpkin pie spiced bomb. Very enjoyable and interesting take on a pumpkin beer from Jolly Pumpkin."
"While still not what I was hoping for from Jolly Pumpkin, this is still one of the more interesting pumpkin beers out there (assuming this beer even qualifies - there really isn't a whole lot of pumpkin going on at this point.). Not terrible..."
"Sampled this one for Halloween. Typical JP pour, meaning nice carbonation and nice head. Dark auburn body, nice off white head. Aroma is all JP funk, and to be honest, not that different from La Roja. And, I am sorry to say, taste follows suite. Some oak, some dark fruits and apples. Lightly tart and funky. But spice? Not getting it. Not getting it in the nose not getting it in the taste. That being said, this is a delicious beer, and I would definately buy it again. But as a pumpkin beer, this one falls short."
"D: La Parcela holds no secrets. It's more tolerable as the beer warms, but I became tired of the beer halfway through the bottle. There just isn't enough complexity -- or enough pumpkin."
"Different than your average pumpkin beer. I wonder if it is in the right category (maybe wild ale?). But you just gotta love Jolly Pumpkin!"
"Taste: The acidic tartness takes center stage like in other Jolly Pumpkin beers. The pumpkin flavor is noticeable fairly quickly but the spices don't emerge until after the tartness has subsided."
"A very nice, interesting take on a pumpkin beer. Glad I got to try this one."
"Drinkability - So much so. I really wish I could find this on tap out here (non-existent in CA sadly) because if I did, I would drink about 10 pints of these. Not over the top like some of the other JP beers where a bomber is plenty...this one is insanely easy to quaff and as stated, the flavors really do meld into making this a nice sweet and sour beer. Damn good, damn enjoyable. Very glad I was able to try this."
"La Parcela pours somewhere between a crystal clear orange and deep goldenrod depending on the lighting. The slightly off white head is massive, filling half the glass. It sticks around for a while to boot, and leaves a decent amount of lacing down the sides of the glass. Just a bit more and La Parcela would have garnered a 5 for looks. The nose is completely dominated by whatever critters JP put into this beer, it's straight funk with just a touch of vinegar skulking around in the background. I expected La Parcela to be much more of a wild ale than a pumpkin one at this point , but I can still find evidence of it's pumkin-ness in the flavor. A brief swirl of brown sugar leads off before the wild influence barges in to take center stage. As with the nose, it's more funky than sour, but both are definitely still present. The beer closes with a flourish from some of the traditional pumpkin ale spices, predominantly cinnamon. Mouthfeel is superb, the beer is light and nimble without even suggesting a watery characteristic. In addition the carbonation, while high, is a bit more restrained than I find in some wild ales. It's still plenty expressive, but it's not bubbly to the point of distraction. La Parcela is a great beer after a year plus of aging, but I think I might have enjoyed it a bit more a little sooner, when the pumpkin ale aspects were shining through a bit more. Still, all in all a great way to kick off Halloween this year."
"Pleasant bite, cut through, the earthy and tomato notes of my spicy chile. Nice wintery brew. Well worth seeking out."
"Much nicer than its bottle counter part. Very effervescent and spicy. I still think the pumpkin flavor is minimal but it was a bit more sour yet still one of the least sour Jolly Pumpkin beers that I have had. Very murky but almost no head but rather that acidic sizzle. This however is the one pumpkin beer I think that should be released early, by the time this comes out every year it is a little cold for a refreshing sour."
"DB- Actually pretty damn easy to throw back due to the body and lack of fatiguing sour. I actually enjoy the spice mixed with the slight lactic a lot (can't justify a high grade due to style and the obvious reason that they call this their pumpkin beer), a cool blend of interesting flavor... I obviously wish the pumpkin would be bumped up a bit for a fresh squash blast."
"D- A very unique pumpkin ale. Drinks nice. I hate to say this, but it doesn't blow my doors off. If this was my first Jolly Pumpkin beer, I am sure I would feel differently."
"Overall- The pumpkin is subtle in this one but it is a solid tart/slightly sour/funky ale. I like the taste of this, I just wish there was more pumpkin, reviewing this as a pumpkin ale, I can't give it too high of a score for taste. Has more saisons notes than anything else. Good, but JP has some much better offerings than this one!"
"D: Not bad, but certainly not even close to the best JP beer out there, and there are much more interesting pumpkin beers too. Easy drinker overall, but nothing worth looking for."
"D - Good. I had no trouble finishing the whole bottle. If it wasn't so pricey, I'd happily have it again. Jolly Pumpkin is a great brewery, but their prices are intense."
"More complex than some pumpkin brews? yes, and I have to give credit for not just making an imperial pumpkin ale with spices like many other breweries seem to be doing now. Good for breaking the pumpkin fall ale 'mold' (no pun intended) , however it just tastes too watered down and not sour enough for it to be worth the $16 tag."
"From a style in which the differences are usually minimal, Jolly Pumpkin manages to set itself apart. Pleasant complexity and flavor progression. Drinkability is rather high, sitting and having a couple is certainly no chore. One to check out if you can get your hands on."
"Served from tap into a snifter. Poured deep orange with a one finger white head. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of granny smith apple, sweet malt, and upon initial inspection I thought I smelled dirty diaper. The diaper aroma left upon sitting for a minute thank God... The flavor was of slightly sweet malt, saison spices, and a subtle sour note. It had a light feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. The flavor was very well balanced. Honestly, I'm not sure where the dirty diaper smell came from... I was the only person in the place besides the employee and he was in the back. I also checked myself, no findings. It left fortunately so it wasn't really a big deal afterall. This one is a must try though. Can you find the diaper?"
"Drinkability- It's a decent beer but it's a bit too acidy and a little expensive for a pint so I wouldn't have more than a couple. Certainly worth trying."
"D: If I didn't know better, I'd say this was completely an American Wild Ale. I don't taste the pumpkin or the accompanying spaces at all... I would've thought a brewery named """Jolly Pumpkin""" would produce a more pumpkin-like brew. And at $14.99 a bottle, it was completely not worth it."
"d - A good beer, but didn't seem to have a lot of pumpkin to it and the taste was pretty watered down. Would try again but wouldn't seek out."
"D/M: Very good but tough to drink if you dont have a palate for tart beers. Well carbonated and worth a try."
"Glows orangish like a jack-o-lantern, Small white head fades fast, the beer is slightly opaque. Smells like basement must, lots of fresh pumpkin and oak. The taste is complex. Kinda sour up front with big raw pumpkin flavor, oak, and cacao is real present. Some other spices make an apperance. Finish is lingering pumpkin and funk. Great mouthfeel, real thick. Tasty tasty, hard to review though because its not a traditional pumpkin ale as it is barrel aged."
"Hazy pumpkin orange with a dense off-white head with great retention and lace, this is one of the better looking pumpkin ales I've had. The nose is surprisingly muted. Pumpkin spice, pumpkin flesh, low funk with some vanilla, I get some nutmeg and mace. While it smells pleasant, this isn't as flavorful as I was expecting. Palate opens mildly tart with the spices coming through. The pumpkin flavor is moderate, with the spices being relatively mild. For a change, it seems like this doesn't have the entire gamut of pumpkin pie spices, it seems like cinnamon and nutmeg are missing. Mild sweetness is present, this is not very funky, arguably a little blah. Light in body with mild lemon character, this is medium-light in body with moderate carbonation and a decent finish. Decent, not worth the high price tag, for bottles at least."
"For a pumpkin ale, I think this is great, and I'm a big fan of pumpkin beers. Guess these guys finally lived up to their name and are no longer hypocrites. I guess now I don't have to keep calling them Jolly Blump- ok, let's not go there."
"D - A little bit heavy for a wild ale, which is what I'm thinking of it as at this point, but pretty drinkable. I think the spice and weight of it might make it hard to drink for some, but I found it to be pretty enjoyable and think I would get the full effect of what this beer is really about after three or so glasses."
"D - this is a pretty solid pumpkin beer. The earthy funkiness was a great complement to the pumpkin flavor, which I wasn't sure how it would work. Solid pumpkin beer, but $15 a 750ml will probably keep me from exoring again."
"Pours a really nice hazy copper-orange with an off white head. Decent amount of lace on the way down. Nose brings definite notes of pumpkin along with some oak and a bit of earth. Some funk but not too much. Taste brings some light pumpkin flavor and slight sourness. Mostly earth and oak along with accompanying funk. Feel is light and dry. Drinks quite well and one of the better and most unique pumpkin beers out there."
"Pumpkin beer? I'm not convinced. But I'm a sucked for sour beers and I love JP stuff, so I can't bring myself to give this one to low of scores, because it IS good."
"This beer isn't very drinkable for two reasons, one this beer is heavy, you may not taste the pumpkin that much but you sure feel it. And second this beer is a bit too dry, after a pint of this I couldn't have any more until I drank a similar amount of water. Not that I'm against drinking water with beer, but I think I should be able to drink two pints of a sub 7% beer without water in between."
"The beer tastes mildly tart, a little sweet too. Hints of actual pumpkin and even less of pumpkin pie, this tasted nearly perfect for a pumpkin ale. I wish they could all add a dose of bret, it works well."
"Overall this was certainly one of the more interesting pumpkin beers I've ever had. Unfortunately I don't think the style lends itself to what JP does best. I don't foresee myself revisiting this one but if you haven't had it then it's certainly worth trying."
"drinkability: good"
"Definitely not anything close to the typical pumpkin ale, but very tasty and extremely drinkable."
"A hazy light amber-orange brew with lacy white head and lots of light, bubbly carbonation. Aroma of funk. Flavor is dominated by the tartness. It's really hard to pick out any pumpkin, spice or cocoa. Nevertheless, this one not your typical pumpkin ale. Rather refreshing and quite drinkable. Crisp, dry fruity finish with perhaps some lingering spice."
"Thanks to DrDogBeer for the try. Pours just like apple cider but with a slightly off white head. Aromas of indistinguishable fruit (pear, pumpkin maybe?) typical funky jolly pumpkin yeast, sweaty socks and white pepper. Flavor is similar with more tart apples presence, the pumpkin is evident somewhere in there but it isn't pronounced. Nice sour/tartness that finishes bracingly dry on the end of the high carbonation. Quite enjoyable."
"Not gonna lie, for all it's good qualities, I have no desire to drink more than my half of the shared bottle."
"D: I have to say not one of my favorite JP beers simply because they do """refreshing""" saisons better than anyone and that's what I love about this brewery. This one is a little harder to drink. Definitely not for everybody."
"I get the joke, JP needed to make a Pumpkin beer and this is it. Though it is just the typical sour and funky JP beer. Just kind of nondescript sour at that. Not much nuance that I usually get from their funky Farmhouse beers. I really like most of their beers, but this is a style that just does not go with funk. Interesting to try once, but that is it."
"Pours a clean orange-ish/ yellow color with an off white head. In the aroma, sour white grapes, nutmeg, and cinnamon. In the taste, green apple, cinnamon, nutmeg and a dry pumpkin under all that. Almost cider like. A spicy bite and a light to medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry cider like and small spice aftertaste. Not so much pumpkin, but spicy and almost cider like."
"This is a good effort but not my favorite JP brew."
"D - This is pretty good but I wish I would have drank it when it was fresher, but still another good offering from Jolly Pumpkin."
"The body is medium and carbonation is high and appropriate. Overall I think this is a very good beer, definitely one of the better Jolly Pumpkins I have tried. I would like to get a chance to try this a bit fresher, perhaps there will be more pumpkin/spice."
"Recommended, if you like sours and funky saisons. I hope Jolly Pumpkin makes this again."
"I liked this beer a bunch, but after 6 months of cellaring, I think the pumpkin qualities faded significantly."
"This is an exceedingly fantastic Pumpkin beer, definitely one of the best commercial examples that I have ever had. I like how appetizing and """sweet""" the aroma smells, but that the flavor is dry, tart and not anywhere near over-spiced. The aroma actually reminds me of desert (perhaps obviously), but the flavor is, in the end, quite savory. I am definitely quite pleased to be drinking a bottle of this right now."
"d: I entered into this with some trepedation. They did a great job with this one though. Thanks to OHLRangers for this unique treat via BIF."
"750 ml bottle served in a Boulevard Tank 7 glass. Thanks for sharing Eugene. Poured a hazy gold with a thin white head. Fairly sour aroma with just a hint of pumpkin pie spice. Nice tart flavor. Very refreshing. Lighter bodied. Some dark sugar in the middle. Tart cherry in the finish. I didn't get a whole lot of pumpkin, but enjoyable none the less."
"D: You can't judge a book by its' cover. When I saw the label and read the description I was 1/2 expecting a darker, heartier brew. Not that there's anything wrong with this..."
"A very nice pumpkin beer from Jolly Pumpkin. Thanks to FlandersNed for the hook up."
"Mouthfeel is on the lighter side with fast moving carbonation. Easy to drink but I can't say this is my favorite JP beer. A little odd with the pumpkin and a bit astringent. Overall though a fun pumpkin beer and definitely a 180 on what most standard pumpkin beers are. Give it a try if you have the access to it."
"Not much really going on with this beer. Good acidic backbone, some fruity esters, hints of oak with wood tannins. No distinguishable fruit flavors. Light in the mouth with a spritzy finish."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied with a nice strong bite of carbonation."
"Aroma of wet stone, minerals, wine grapes, lemon, hay, similar to a lambic. Later on at room temp, the cinnamon/nutmeg is there, with some apple cider traces. Flavor has some earthy, squashy elements, but not a heavy pumpkin presence. Tart and dry with a drying residual spice and identifiable earthy pumpkin in the aftertaste. Upfront its more tart with some toasted malt/pumpkin seeds and spice in the middle, leaving the more complex elements to linger in the finish. Its slightly too astringent, but other than that it drinks very well. A 750 is no problem in a sitting, provided you enjoy sour ales."
"Good carbonation and wonderful sourness in the mouthfeel. I'm a huge fan/supporter of Jolly Pumpkin and this beer doesn't disappoint."
"D: Another good offering from Jolly Pumpkin and a good example of a farmhouse ale which they can brew blind at this point. I was expecting more spice, pumpkin and other """fall""" flavors from this one. The lower rating is based on the fact that it really doesn't seem like a pumpkin ale to me. Otherwise, it's very drinkable and the low alcohol insures that I'll finish the bottle. However, I'm moving on tonight and my adventure ends with this one. It's Moerlein OTR for the remainder of the evening."
"D: This could be a daily drinker for me. Just the thought of a wild pumpkin ale gets me going. The growler had hung around for a while which is why the carbonation was not there but I still found it very drinkable."
"D: Daily drinker which is impressive because it is wild and pumpkin."
"I was lucky enough to get some of this at Capone's. Matt mentioned that he'd had trouble with the keg, but it was pouring fine during my visit. Hazy orange with a thin, yet solid, cap of fine beige bubbles. Thick, sticky lacing. Interesting aroma, sort of expected from JP. Smells tart with a bit of strawberry and yeasty spices, a bit grassy, lemon, with light vinegar notes. Really nice flavour. Solid tartness, a bit acetic, but well balanced rather than bold. There was a bit of vegetal sweetness, squash or pumpkin flesh, with herbal bitterness in the finish. Light earthiness and funk, citrus zest, lingering spice. Medium bodied with average carbonation, a bit on the creamy side and a little slick. This was really cool, a completely different take on a pumpkin ale. Check this out if you get a chance."
"Hedonistically, I enjoyed my glass, and I'd have had another and almost did. Forget about the whole pumpkin thing and enjoy!"
"Overall- Not bad but flavors are weak. Slight touch of tart tanginess make it enjoyable. Very easy to gulp down but don't seek this out."
"I heard many mixed reviews on this while it was on tap. Most disliked it but I found it interesting with the standout brett-filled funkiness that I was hoping for. If anyone expected to have a """pumpkin beer", they were probably let down."
"Drinkability is good, probably couldn't drink more than one or two, but the lack of pumpkin would keep me from plopping down another $7.50 on this one."
"not bad, just not as good as I thought it would be"
"Sits a hazy copper orange with a small off-white head. Nose of sourish, tart fruit, some cookie dough, and maybe a smidgen of grass and spice. Not much pumpkin spice though. Toasted malts and tart Brett. funk start out the palate. Light caramel and cookie malt fill-in midway, with buttery, pecan pie accents near the finish. Hints of spices linger in the finish, with residual tart wildness. Medium-bodied with soft, light carbonation. Good drinkability. Probably the subtlest """pumpkin ale""" I have ever had. Probably the only sour one as well! Works for me, since I'm not crazy about overly-spiced beers anyways."
"Wow, this was really interesting and seemed to me that Jolly Pumpkin pretty much pulled off what they were shooting for with this. A Pumpkin Ale that is rich with notes of chocolate and spice but possessing their trademark """Wild""" quality. I liked that the tartness didn't quite dominate the taste as much as it did the nose, allowing much more of the pumpkin qualities to shine through. A unique beer for sure that I'm glad to have been able to try."
