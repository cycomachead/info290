Hoppin' Frog Frog's Hollow pours a deeper shade of orange than other examples of the style I've recently had. Head vanishes almost instantly. Very sweet on the nose. This worries me. I like sweet beers but pumpkin ales overdo it sometimes. It smells vaguely pumpkin pie-ish, with plenty of sugar and spice and all that. It's sweet on the palate but not cloyingly so. Pumpkin's up front, followed by an array of spices and a sweet vanilla finish. You know something? I like it quite a bit.","xabyss","Jan 11, 2014"

Pours lightly cloudy bright orange amber color with a 1 finger fairly dense off white head with decent retention, that reduces to a thin lace cap that lingers. Slight spotty lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big pumpkin, toast, brown sugar, caramel, cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, ginger, bread, and herbal earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt, pumpkin, and spice notes; with good strength. Taste of pumpkin, brown sugar, caramel, toast, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, clove, bread, and herbal earthiness. Lingering notes of caramel, brown sugar, caramel, toast, cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, ginger, and herbal earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of pumpkin, malt, and spice notes; with a good malt/spice balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a moderately slick and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very good imperial pumpkin ale. All around well balance pumpkin, malt, and spice flavors; and very smooth the sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Oct 10, 2013"

If you're looking for a higher alcohol version of a pumpkin beer it is something to look at. If you're a fan of ginger beers it is certainly something to look at, in fact I would put it at the forefront of my recommendations to you. If you're looking for that traditional pumpkin pie experience, or you are particular about carbonation levels, I would say look elsewhere. Aside from this the beer does fill that "spiced holiday beer" niche. If you're just looking for something different or seasonal, you could do worse.","teromous","Aug 10, 2013"

The spices are supporting actors in the aroma and flavor profiles - even maybe a little kick of ginger in there that;s nice. Better than others that are just jacked up on the pie spice mix. Taste overall was cleaner and more crisp versus "heavy and syrupy". Besides the label is SO cool, worth having just for that!

Then I further though those hot dose of Cinnamon reminded me of Hot Dam! Nobody drinks that stuff straight, and nobody should put it in my beer. When it came to the aftertaste, it got the burn of cinnamon mouthwash yielding to a more mediciney flavor. At least the beer was thin and the taste did not last long.

Frog's Hollow Double Pumpkin Ale seemingly takes a good pumpkin beer recipe and doubles the malt with out following suit with pumpkin, spice, and hops. Overly sweet, rich with unnecessary alcohol, and completely lacking in the core essence of this beer as outlined by the name; Double Pumpkin. Where's the pumpkin?

4.37,13.8,3.5,4,5,4,4,"Pours straight orange, clear, very nice but lacks any head to speak of, there's no retention, and no lacing, so a little disappointed with the appearance. Smell is toffee, buttery crackers, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Taste is fantastic. Sweetness initially, which fades into flavor..Buttery cracker crust, pumpkin, nutmeg, allspice, a bit of spice from clove and ginger. A little more sweetness squeaks through here and there to add to the complexity. Very nice, delicious. Firm, creamy, medium mouthfeel. Alcohol is noticeable, but in a good way, in that it lets you know your drinking an imperial ale and not eating grandma's state fair blue ribbon pumpkin pie. Well balanced, and finish isn't cloying at all, its sweet at times, but you wouldn't describe Frog's Hollow Double Pumpkin as 'sweet', and that's what makes it extra good, and hence, this bad boy is right up there and maybe surpassing my all time favorite Pumking.","JackieTH","Sep 04, 2012"

Nothing will help the huge melange of spices, so if you're not into that or are afraid, stay away. But again, I feel like, whether they intended it or not, the girls who like the spicy pumpkin or holiday ales would really like this. Otherwise, and though I did enjoy this, I would maybe look elsewhere. Also, for near $10 a bomber, that price point doesn't work for me for what the beer ends up being in the end.

Taste is of cinnamon gum right off the bat, followed by other pumpkin pie spices. Actual malt and pumpkin flavors are very subdued overall. This beer does have a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is just not a very good beer.

A real smooth and easy down the hatch body, lighter bodied and kind of slick. I found this to be an enjoyable sipping pumpkin beer as the pumpkin is strong and the sweetness is there. The spices and the alcohol narrowly edge this though, as I found sweetness giving way to a dry, alkie burn and sharp pepper spice notes. The finish is warming and spicey dry which is appreciated.

The taste is strongly clove with other spices and pumpkin in the background, but the sweetness lingers and becomes cloying with good carbonation to scrub the tongue. There's a good alcohol presence that made me check the bottle to see if it was barrel aged but again, the sweetness is overwhelming without carbonation.

The light really plays around, and I see a few carb trails So, strange that it has no head. Ah, but the smell is where things get good. At first whiff, nothing more than a well-crafted, spicy pumpkin pie comes to mind. Seriously, it is a ringer - the cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice play a part here. As I drink more, the feel of the clove, and definitely the ginger come out with gobs of pumpkin. Finishes sharply. A pumpkin laser of saturation. The 8.4% is masked well.

Really well balanced between loads of pumpkin pie spice and sweet caramel candy pumpkin fruit sugars, pretty amazing feet to spice it so heavily with a beer with this much spice character to not come off cloying. Almost a toasted marshmallow like experience full of roasted caramel, this beer is pretty awesome even if you don't like pumpkin pie. It's actually easier to drink than alot of other imperial pumpkin ales out there but just super spicy, I'm givnig my second half to my wife and I will cleanse the palate and start in on a fresh six of Green Flash WCIPA.

The nose comprises cinnamon, brown sugar, nutmeg, light clove, bread, pumpkin seeds, and caramel. The taste seems to accentuate the spices, blending them all nicely together in a buttery caramel shell. Then, an equally strong blast of pure pumpkin comes in, balancing out the spices and showing that this beer's name is more than appropriate. Damn, does this taste good! The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a kinda creamy feel.

Taste leans heavily on the pie spices, almost overbearing by the time a 22oz bomber is ingested (blended the last 8oz or so with other beers to experiment). All notes from scent are present, just take a back seat to spice. Fuller side of medium bodied, extra creamy but a looong lingering aftertaste kicks the rating down a notch.

The flavor is well rounded with a smoother alcohol finish. The overall mouthfeel is fairly light, but still coats the mouth with flavors, and the higher ABV isn't overly noticeable either.

3.44,-10.4,3,4,3.5,3,3,"Hoppin' Frog's Hollow Double Pumpkin. Found this guy in a bomber about a week ago. I've recently gotten into pumpkin beers, after shying away from them for a number of years. They're an acquired taste, to be certain, but they can be quite tasty, if you know what you're getting into. First thing I notice when pouring the beer is the clarity. Brewing with pumpkin you would expect it to be cloudy, but that's not the case. Color is a crystal clear orange. (It's a pumpkin beer - what did you expect?) Fizzy head that recedes quickly. Aroma is nutmeg, allspice, pumpkin, and maybe some cinnamon. Smells like pumpkin pie. Taste is more bready and caramel, like pie crust, chased by a heavy dose of more nutmeg, allspice, clove, and cinnamon. First taste and the pumpkin flavor kind of gets lost behind a heavy wall of spice. Lots of alcohol warm in the finish, which works given the taste profile. For something that calls itself a "double" pumpkin, I find that particular flavor getting lost, which is too bad because that's my favorite part of this style of beer. For an imperial I find that this lacks body, as it's kind of watery, which is also somewhat disappointing. Overall it's a nice take on the style but nothing earth shattering. Somewhat disappointed by this, though that may be because I've had some exemplary versions of this style in the past.","eclaycamp","Oct 29, 2010"

There is an interesting finish that develops some light cocoa flavors`and then a touch of mint at the end. Definitely a bit different while still being somewhat subtle. Smooth, somewhat nutty, which lends some creaminess, and only moderately sweet in the mouth. Pretty good, a little different profile, but not a lot of real pumpkin flavor.","Georgiabeer","Oct 19, 2010"

Has kind of a Big Red aroma to it. The taste is very spicy as well. Big cinnamon flavor along with some nutmeg. The taste doesn't seem as spicy as the aroma. Unfortunatly I don't pick up much pumpkin flavors but there is a solid malt body so that the spice doesn't overwhelm this beer. The flavor is ok but it is an all spice pumpkin ale. The higher ABV doesn't seem to ruin this beer like other "imperial" or "double" pumpkin ales. The feel is light to moderate with prickly carbonation, a bit sticky.

Overall, I found this to be a spice forward pumpkin ale that didn't come together as nicely as some others I've had. Lots of ginger lingers on with each sip. Worth a shot, but I wish the spices were toned down a bit.","orbitalr0x","Aug 29, 2009"
