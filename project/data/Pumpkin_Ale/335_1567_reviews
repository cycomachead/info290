"3/13/15 (Bottle) - Nice dark orange pour, pillow white head and mild carbonation. Pumpkin, hops and cinnamon among the sweet aromas. Taste  a nice blend of sweet fruit and bitter hops. Light crisp beer easy going down, not much kick."
""
""
""
""
"Was really looking forward to this, but was let down. A bit too sweet and not enough spice. Cool label."
""
"One of the better pumpkin beers I've had."

"I remember this used to be my go-to fall beer. Now that's it been probably a year since I had it last, and I've gotten more serious about beer, it doesn't taste as good as I remember. Still, if you want a fall beer with very subtle fall flavors, this is a good choice."
"Aroma has a spicy overtone, mainly cloves and cinnamon, plus a hint of pumpkin. Pours a dark coppery amber with a decent light tan head that leaves plenty of lacing. Flavor is not strong, but enjoyable, a malty core plus pumpkin and cloves and an earthy underpinning. Edgy texture is about average in the fizz and body departments. If not memorable, a good beer for fall."
"Bottle sampled. Slight whiff of nutmeg on the nose. Has a deep dark orange hue that gives credence to the use of real pumpkin here. The spices take a back seat - bitter and sweet pumpkin takes control of the flavor profile. Body is a little watery - maybe to be expected at a lower ABV."

"A great pumpkin beer."
""
""
""

"O - Nothing wrong here, but also nothing terribly interesting.  A well-crafted pumpkin beer that delivers decent spice and a reasonable taste of the pumpkin itself, but not a brew that immediately drives me to seek another."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I had this from a bottle, poured into a pint glass. It was a dark orange and smelled faintly of pumpkin pie. The pumpkin flavors are there, without disguising the fact that it is a beer. A real solid seasonal and fine pumpkin ale."
""
""
""
""
""
"Soapy head that always has me worried.  You definitely get the pumpkin and spice in the smell and also in the taste but it is all kinda mild.  Nothing really jumps out at you.  A little off in the carbonation.  Nothing special, way to many Pumpkins out there to go here."
"Overall: This year is a solid pass! Past years seemed to be much better."

"full flavored well spiced pumpkin ale"

"Amber in color with on off white head.  Faint Brussels lacing.  Aroma of nutmeg,cinnamon, and pumpkin permeate out of the glass.  The taste is a bit muted with the spices not really discernable like I found in the aroma.  I think it's probably a bit too much nutmeg.  The mouth is moderately carbonated and slightly watery."
"Overall, one of the better lower-alcohol pumpkin beers out there. Great flavor and very drinkable."
""
"One of the best Pumpkin brews out there. Not overly spicy (Unitas Punk'N) or sickeningly sweet (thank u very little Southern Tier PumpKing)."

"Pumpkin and ginger aroma, lots of ginger flavor. Slight bitter aftertaste."
""
""
""
"Golden amber body with off-white head. Pumpkin, cinnamon and nutmeg aromas and flavors. Tasty pumpkin ale."
"My first pumpkin beer. I most admit, i didn't want to try a beer with pumpkin smell or taste. Pours fairly clear. Honey golden colour. Spicy pumpkin, nutmeg/allspice aroma (go figure) Kinda sweet with a ginger taste. Mild pumpkin and pumpkin spice.  Kinda tastes like pumpkin ginger ale! Nice beer!"
"Had this one on a trip to Atlanta...was a very good pumpkin brew.  The spices are well blended and the overal taste appealed to my taste buds!  Gove it and try, you won't be disappointed!!"
""
""
""
"A fairly decent Pumpkin Ale.  Slight notes of pumpkin and well, pumpkin spices of course.  But I liked that you could still taste the beer."
""
""

""
""
""
""
"Overall, glad I tried it but nothing unexpected. It's got all the right spices and has a good mouthfeel."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A decent, straight-ahead pumpkin-pie emulating affair here, perhaps from that particular grandma whose spice measurements were always a tad suspect, but somehow everything still worked out fine in the end - enter the ABV, stage left.  Anyways, tasty, and an appropriately old-school Samhain-worthy offering, all-around."
""
""
"Not bad, had more aroma than flavor.  Decent pumpkin flavor up front with some of the pie spicyness, but quickly faded as the beer went on, left just trace notes."

"O - My kind of pumpkin beer, the pumpkin accents the ale, it doesn't overpower it."
""
"One of the least impressive pumpkin ales I've ever experienced. Not very flavorful, only a tiny iota of spice and pumpkin flesh. All in all, very ho-hum and meh."

"I'm a sucker for pumpkin beers.  Usually they are over-spiced.  This one is a pleasant surprise.  Malty, moderately sweet, and not overly spicy.  There is a nice pumpkin flavor, some moderate pie spice, and a good balance.  The finish isn't overly sweet.  It's a little hazy, bronzish-amber in color, and has a nice white head.  The smell is the best quality, although the taste is solid as well.  Full in body.  It's a great Fall brew."
""
"i was unimpressed by this, it seems incredibly flavorless compared to the style standard of the pumpkin beer. maybe folks like it because its so mild, minimal in malt character and in pie spice flavor. maybe its just a touch of fall, rather than a full on plunge into it, but in the context of other pumpkin beers, this one doesnt taste like much. amber colored base beer should have more sweetness and more body, its pretty thin. there is a light cinnamon nose and taste to it, but the pumpkin itself is invisible and there isnt enough other additives in here to fake it. nice carbonation though and with the lighter body i suspect this may make a decent fall session beer for some, but it lacks the spirit of the season for me."
""
""
""
"Overall:  Pretty standard pumpkin feel.  Nice flavor, bit a little more pumpkin, yam, or squash could make this beer a bit more starchy and presentable to the consumer."
""
""
"Pours a great deep pumpkin color, semi-clear. Head is a couple inches and hangs out for a long time. Lacing is some of the best I have seen. Aroma is of spiced pumpkin, what I expected. Flavor is ok, but the spices are a little much and take away from the true pumpkin flavor. Spice also leaves a little dry spice feel on the palate. Overall, would have been a bit better with less nutmeg and spice and a little more natural pumpkin flavor"
""
""
""
"Tap from Lazy Dog Macon. Pours transparent amber with an off-white head. Aroma and taste of pumpkin and spices. I like pumpkin beers, but this one was not my favorite. There are much better pumpkin beers out there."

"Really really drinkable pumpkin ale. Very refreshing, not too much pumpkin or spice, just a nice 5.5% ale with some great flavor. Try it."
"Great blend of a seasonal pumpkin ale.  Not overpowering like some!"
""
""
""
""
"The pour was dark amber with a thick off white head. The smell was pumpkin heavy, but also gave way to clove, nutmeg, and cinnamon underneath. The taste was similar although a tad sweeter than I thought it would be, it was still very delicious. The mouthfeel was heavy but worked with the style. I liked it a lot."

"Overall/Comments: An overall very solid Pumpkin Ale that, while not great, is good across the board. This is one of the more drinkable pumpkin ales that I have had. Classified as a Pumpkin Ale @ 5.5% ABV. Consumed 12/7/2013."

"O - An easy to drink, tasty amber ale. Better than most pumpkin beers for sure. Well done"
""
""
""
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. It is decent with a raw pumpkin character that I typically look for in pumpkin ales but for some reason it seemed weird here. Interesting to try but would probably pass on in the future."
""
"Beer is medium-light to medium in body, with carbonation of medium intensity, leading to a mouthfeel that is smooth and gently foamy on the palate, overall rather enjoyable and good for the style. Closes dry, with light stickiness clinging to the palate and lips."
""
""
""
"Overall: A fairly well balanced beer. I would like a bit more malt or body to this, but loads better than the Jack'd Up. Not a ton of depth to this beer, but does have a real pumpkin taste."

"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was the complexity of its nose. While not all of the components therein were entirely appropriate, the general mix end effort didn’t go unnoticed. In comparison, the taste was frankly dull and flat for everything except its spiciness, cleanliness, and decent freshness, which showed nice raw ginger root and punch throughout. This seems to be a “commercial” type of pumpkin ale. The spice is enough to make sure anyone who was drinking it know it was there, but the rest of the beer is just standard and relatively cheap, so you can buy and consume a ton without getting overwhelmed. This is great for someone looking for an easy autumnal to bring to a party, but might be on the bland side for the seasoned crafter."
""
""
""
"Ichabod wouldn't be anywhere near my top choice for prototypical Pumpkin Ale - it's nothing to lose your head over (ha!). It's definitely not the stuff of legends (ha! again). I mean, it's not exactly worth hunting down (ha! a third time). But in all fairness it does make an enjoyable fall-time treat and, like most all New Holland offerings, is worth grabbing if you see it."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O- A very nice seasonal beer. Could very well knock back a few of these by a fire. Perfect for a cold night. Looking forward to trying New Holland's Cabin Fever in a few months."

"A solid Pumpkin beer. If this one were available here where I live, I'd have no trouble reaching for this one every fall. It's light enough to drink repeatedly if desired, but packs just enough flavor to keep you wanting more."
"A fairly unique take on the pumpkin ale. The pumpkin tastes strong and appears to be roasted as well as a lesser role for spices. I'll definitely have to pick up a six-pack next year."
""
""
""
""
"O- At this point, this is the best Pumpkin ALE I've ever had. I prefer Pumpkin Porter, but if you want a great pumpkin ale in mid-late October, steel gray sky and watching college football, look no further."

"Served in a 16 oz pint glass at the Pourhouse , Westmont NJ"
""
""
"I found too that as the beer got closer to room temperature, I was enjoying it more. Not to say heating it would be an option, like fall wines, but if it were a cold day and I were outside, I'd grab an Ichabod right off a shelf without a care for temperature."
""
""
""
"Overall: a tasty pumpkin beer and probably my favorite from new holland. a great new try for the fall time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Another good pumpkin-infused beer. If you want balanced pumpkin and beer flavors, consider this one. If you want in-your-face autumn pie, try a brewery with less reputation to uphold."
""
"Overall: quite possibly the most balanced of the pumpkin ales in terms of real malty beer flavor and pumpkin spice. Very pleasant and easy to drink despite full body and slightly chewy mouthfeel. A great pumpkin ale overall. Another fantastic beer from New Holland!"
""
"This is not a brew that I would purchase on a regular basis, but I really enjoyed the nutmeg flavor that comes through over the other spices. Similar brews tend to have a cinnamon base to them. I also found this to be less sweet than the cinnamon-spiced beers. This is not a great beer - buy it for the nutmeg!"
""
"Amber colored with hints of classic fall hues. Thin cream-colored head sticks on the surface. Smells like wheat with hints of spices, nutmeg and cinnamon. This pumpkin ale actually taste like beer as the spices do not over power it. That's nice. Spices kind of linger in the background. Little pumpkin flavor with a slight acidic finish that doesn't really detract from the beer at all. Medium bodied mouth feel with a little zip from the carbonation. Overall a decent pumpkin ale with it's strongest quality being that the pumpkin and spice flavors do not detract from the beer flavor."

"O: I've had better pumpkins, but this is a decent entry. Worth drinking just for the middle flavors."
""
""
""
"Had this beer out of the bottle and poured in into a freshly cleaned and wiped glass. The appearance had an amber color and a bit of a haze to it with about an inch head from the initial pour. The smell was very spicy, but still had a good amount of pumpkin to it. The taste was very unexpected. I had thought that being a pumpkin ale, this would have more of a pumpkin taste to it, but this wasn't the case. It was a lot of nutmeg and a bit of cinnamon. The mouthfeel was not too heavy, and the beer lingered a bit, but a good amount in my opinion. Overall though, I would only give it a 3. With all the great pumpkin beers out there this time of year, this is one that I would drink if someone had it, but probably wouldn't buy again. Just not really what I expected."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours brilliant amber with a two inch tan/off-white head of foam. Settles relatively quickly. Distinct, rich, pumpkin, allspice and nutmeg nose. Medium body and light carbonation. Malt, and distinct pumpkin and noticeable spice palate with persistent lingering. Hints of butterscotch and caramelized sugars? Somewhat sweet, although balanced against with spice and pumpkin notes.. Attractive Belgian lace. ABV is not noticeable. Fresh. Attractive. Will repurchase."
""
"Overall, an above-average offering. It seems a bit unfair to compare this to an imperial pumpkin beer (like Schlafly's or Pumking), but since ABV doesn't factor into my ratings, it should come as no surprise that this one doesn't quite reach the upper echelon."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a pretty good pumpkin ale. I really enjoy the smell, and the taste actually pairs nicely with the smell and mouthfeel brings it all together. They did a good job, i feel like this captures the essence of a Pumpkin ale."
"O - Solid for the style - worth a shot."

"Poured a nice amber color; great pumpkin, nutmeg and cinnamon aromas; the taste was smooth, balanced and had a clean if slightly biting finish; overall a very nice seasonal beer - great for fall/winter."
""
""
"O- the look and mouthfeel of this one were great, I just wish the flavors would have been a little more pronounced."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: More well rounded and complex than others even for the style which is usually straight up pumpkin which comes across as too sour."
"D - Well done overall with a good balanced of spices and malt and a finish that is both dry enough to avoid becming cloying, but also malty enough to keep the spices from seeming harsh. This also has the odd distinction of being perhaps the only pumpkin beer that have had that smelled like raw pumpkin, which isn't as unpleasant as it sounds."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall an excellent brew. love the brewers at NH They do awesome with ease."
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is disappointing. I usually like New Holland, but this one was not for me."
""
"Cheers!"
"12 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, bottled 7/26/2012. Pours very hazy orange copper color with a 1 finger fairly dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of pumpkin, bread, cinnamon, clove, caramel, allspice, ginger, nutmeg, and herbal hops. Pretty nice aromas with good strength and decent balance. Taste of biscuit, caramel, toast, cinnamon, pumpkin, clove, ginger, nuttiness, and herbal hops. Lingering notes of caramel, toast, biscuit, nuttiness, spices, and herbal on the finish for a good bit. Good balance of flavors with a good malt/spice balance; zero cloying flavors on the finish. Not too much pumpkin in the taste but it is noticeable; a slight vegetative note but it isn’t detrimental. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and slick mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with nearly zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a nice Pumpkin ale. Good balance of malt and spices; very smooth to drink. I enjoyed this one quite a bit."
""
""
""
""
"Overall / Drinkability: On some levels this beer works well and on others it does not. Too much in the way of spicing. Yes, the Pumpkin comes out a bit, but the spices are so strong it comes out being more of a winter warmer in the end. Tasty, but not terribly """beery""". Great color, nice aroma though. One seems to be enough though."
""
""
"Pours clear amber topped with a cream-colored fluffy white head. Significant splotchy lacing along the sides of the glass. Very pleasant aroma of pumpkin spice, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, accents of caramel and of course, pumpkin. Opens with the aforementioned spice and pumpkin accents, slightly bready with toasted grain. Malty with light toffee midpalate, finishes lightly spicy, sweet but semi-dry. One of the better pumpkin ales available in the Midwest and very much a beer. Not overly spiced and sweet and there is enough here to please both those who usually are fans of pumpkin ales and those who are not."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is OK but unfortunately the pumpkin pie spices are a little out of balance - way too much cinnamon for the amounts of nutmeg and allspice."
""
""
"O: this is a decent pumpkin beer. I have had better, certainly, but worse as well. I just wish the flavors were balanced a bit better and a little more pronounced."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Like some IPAs can be considered as a hop bomb, this beer seems like it's a cinnamon bomb and could use a better balance between the flavors of pumpkins and spices."
""
""
""
""
"O= This is a solid pumpkin beer. It deserves way better than it's rating that's for sure. A good drinkability as well as a nice flavor profile. Most pumpkin beers are either too light on flavor or too large in alcohol. This baby is just right."
"Overall, this a very well balanced and aromatic brew that embodies the season and is easy to drink. I'm not a huge fan of pumpkin ales, but this is surely one I would enjoy having again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O – Good. Pumpkin was not overpowering and the beer was very drinkable."
""
"Mouthfeel: This is a bit thin bodied but easy drinking and well blended beer which really makes me like it for a pumpkin beer."
"O - New Holland's Ichabod pumpkin ale does a great job of whisking the drinker away to a mental fall fantasy world similar to the likes of Sleepy Hollow but, here in the real world, the beer's malt backbone falls just slightly short of real involvement and balance. The spiciness throughout is great, but it's in need of a little more balance and body for the cool fall days. In the end, it's one of my favorite fall seasonals I wish I could just slightly tweak."
"O: enjoyable, well worth checking out but not something to brag about per se"
"Overall it was about average to a little better than average for a pumpkin ale."
""
""
"O- I love how this smells and it really shows a lot of promise when I hold it to my nose. But it disappoints from there. The clove bitterness is a turnoff. The taste just doesn't live up to the aroma. If you are looking for a pumpkin ale that drinks like a regular pale ale then this is for u. But if u prefer bigger pumpkin flavor I would try something else."
""
""
""
"A fantastic pumpkin ale right here. Ichabod gets it right. If you want a sessionable pumpkin beer, you've got it."
""
""
"This is a great pumkin ale. Of of the best I've had."
""
"Overall: More pumpkin, less spice, if you please. Hell, I'll just take less spice. One step at a time, you know?"
"Poured a stiff thick single finger head with a nice orange coloring. This ale had almost no scent and even asked others to help me but no one could. The taste is rather interesting as you can detect the nutmeg and spice but it had a real earthy taste, almost gourdish. This makes sense as it is supposed to be brewed with actual pumpkin. I enjoyed this rather unique take on a pumpkin ale."
""
""
""
""
""
"Another October rolls around, and another opportunity to try out a new pumpkin ale. First time trying New Holland Ichabod Ale and was impressed. Pours a dark orange with a foamy, inch, off-white head that is pretty much gone after a few minutes. The smell of this beer is really something -- pumpkin spice, sweet cinnamon, nutmeg all contained wrapped around a subtle smokiness. Considering the strength of the smell, the taste is very balanced. Very easy to drink. Cinnamon and pumpkin spice are probably the most notable features, but there's also a subtle mint taste towards the end. A complex brew."
""
""
""
"Smells of fresh pumpkin puree with a side of cinnamon/nutmeg/mint spicing and a touch of butternut squash aroma. Very savory nose, there is hardly any sweet malt aroma at all! Flavor starts out as a dusty cinnamon spice that transforms into a good solid toasted bread malt and savory pumpkin flesh combo that works well without overpowering my palate on spicing like many pumpkin ales tend to do. This one is worth trying out for a """drier approach""" to the pumpkin ale concept."
"Overall – Not too bad. Not overly sweet and it had a decent flavor and feel profile. Worth a try."
""
"I sampled this beer along with another similar choice (Blue Moon Harvest Moon) and I quite enjoyed it. The smell and taste of pumpkin was evident and had a very nice sweetness to it. It beat my expectations. The presentation of the label was great as well."
""
""
""
"Go Buffs!"
""
"I think there's just a little too much spice--especially cinnamon--which held this pumpkin ale back from being what it could be. Still, it's nice."
""
"Overall: This beer was quite a nice selection, especially for a first time. It really had all three elements of pumpkin, cinnamon, and nutmeg, all in a fair balance. The malted roasted was also a nice decision. I really enjoyed this beer while sitting in my living room, windows down, slight, chilly breeze in the air and the smell of a bonfire coming in from the outside. This is the type of beer I look for on a night like this. The one thing that can best describe this beer is """well-balanced""". I will be looking for this beer again hopefully before the fall season is over. Cheers!"
"O – This is a pretty nice pumpkin ale. It looks and smells great, but the taste is a bit too one-dimensional, and the mouthfeel is too thin for my taste in a hearty fall pumpkin beer. Still, this is a tasty and very drinkable beer. Good beer and clever name, New Holland."
""
""
"O: not impressed by this one. Definitely on my long list of dont bother pumpkin ales."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Note - Pumpkin Ales are not for me. So it is a bit negatively biased review. But still scores well due to spices."
""
""
""
"O: A notch above all of the other pumpkin beer 6 packs that I've tried. This beer is enjoyable and easy to drink. Tastes of pumpkin pie but not quite as strong as Southern Tier's Pumking. This would go well with any of the fall holidays or just as a good beer to get away from what you're used to."

"Overall I was let down with this beer and I thought it was a below average example of a Pumpkin Ale, This beer was going in the right direction, but when it got to the flavor it went down hill fast. This beer didn't have the best drinkability, it went down fairly smooth, but there's no way that the flavors could hold my attention, one is more then enough for me, now way I would want another one. What I liked most about this beer was the aroma, it was full of nice pumpkin pie aromas and was pretty true to style. What I liked least about this beer was the taste, it was pretty bland and thin without those nice pumpkin pie aspects that I got in the aroma. I wouldn't buy this beer again, it just isn't a good example of the style and I wouldn't recommend this beer to anyone looking for a good Pumpkin Ale. All in all I wasn't a fan of this beer, when it came to the taste it just didn't deliver, I'll have to pass on this beer. I was looking for a new favorite Pumpkin Ale, but it sure isn't going to be this one, better luck next time New Holland."
"O: Meh..."

"Overall - when i buy a pumpkin beer i'm really not looking for a whole lot more than some entertainment. this beer was decent and it satisfied my craving on the first chilly night of september, but there aren't any aspects of this beer that could be considered exceptional."
""
"This beer has a nice amber colored body with a nice small tanish head to it that holds its own for a while. The smell has nice pumpkin aroma alomost pie like. The taste is awesome, it has a nice roasted pumpkin flavor with the clove and some peppery notes, espcially once it warms up a little bit that is when the flavor come alive. The mouth feel is very nice, smooth and leaves a nice peppery after taste in your mouth. Overall this is a really good pumpkin beer, not the best i have had but i would say it is now in my top ten."

"O- Merely a mediocre pumpkin ale for me. A bit disappointing considering my general liking of this style and brewery."
""
"o: overall, this is still a great pumpkin ale and probably in my top 3 or 4. it's also a lot more sessionable than some of the heavy hitters like Weyerbacher, Pumking, and Punkin that are closer to the 8-9% mark."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I would say this is quite an underrated pumpkin ale. It does exactly what beer drinkers ask a pumpkin ale to do, no more and no less. Granted, it does taste a bit better on-tap than from the bottle, so if you have the opportunity to try this on draft, go for it. I'm usually not a huge fan of NH, but I have to say they pull this off well."

"Nice stab by New Holland. Still pushed around by the spice rack. Yet, better than the average. Probably because it doesn't fault in some of the other ways pumpkin beers falter (too sweet, no pumpkin, etc.)"
"O. Very enjoyable pumpkin ale, something you could drink more than one of. I would recommend this beer to a friend."

"Pleasant, pleasing flavor. More of the same spices are present, along with the pumpkin flavoring. Maybe this is just because its off season and I don’t have a recent point of reference but I’m digging this brew."

"An extremely tasty pumpkin ale. Best thing about this beer ... it tastes like a beer and one I would want to have more than one of. That is saying a lot for Pumpkin Ale IMO."
""
""
"D-Overall this was a Good Pumpkin ale on flavor. Nothing really unique but you got the spices and pumpkin flavors that should be in a pumpkin ale. It did lack on Smell and mouthfeel but besides that its one of the more decent pumpkin ale's. I prob wouldn't get a 6 pack of this but i'm sure to grab at least a 12oz of this every october."

"O - good pumpkin beer. It takes a lot to differentiate between the pumpkin beers because they are all so similar. This one doesnt stand out a whole lot, but its good."
"O: A very mild pumpkin ale. Lacking in some of the other pumpkin spices, mainly cinnamon in this one."
""

"O - I've had better pumpkin brews. I just prefer more pumpkin flavor and more sweetness. The bitterness in here just hides a lot of flavor."

"Overall this brew has so much bitter spice flavor that it just overwhelms all the other flavors in this beer."

"Thanks to travisnd for sending this beer. Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a copper color wih a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of pumpkin, some spices. Taste is pumpkin, nutmeg, cinnamon, well balanced. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a good quality beer."
"Dark orange in color with a decent white head that forms and recedes to minimal covering. Lots of cinnamon and pumpkin in the nose with a touch of sweet caramel aroma. A bit spicy at first with notes of cinnamon and clove, pumpkin is light and blends in with the spiciness nicely, moderate hop presence with some floral notes that come through midpalate, finish has a touch of bitterness and another hint of cinnamon/clove spiciness. Malt presence is moderate and slightly sweet, with notes of caramel and brown sugar. Nice moderate body to this one, with average carbonation and a smooth feel to it. Overall, this is one of the better pumpkin ales I've had this year. Really enjoyed it!"
"Na Zdravje!"
"Overall - A good beer that goes beyond the novelty of pumpkin beer, producing a balanced brew."
"Overall-- let's be honest, I don't usually like pumpkin beers... But this one I find outright offensive."
"Pours a clear, medium brown color with a very slight head. Scent is quite weak with mostly sweet malts and a slight pumpkin spice hint. Taste is rather weak in pumpkin flavors. I'm mostly getting malts and some spices for the taste. The texture is rather smooth and full however, making for great drinking. I think in a blind taste test I would actually thing this was an Oktoberfest beer and not a pumpkin ale. Kind of disapointing as I was expecting more."
"Had a pint of this on tap at Monarch in Grand Rapids."
"Overall: A pretty good pumpkin beer. Nicely balanced. Spices don't overwhelm the pumpkin."
"The only thing I would have changed about this beer is a thicker mouthfeel but it is only 5.2 percent and have it a bit sweeter to balance the hops out more. Other than that its an interesting take on a pumpkin beer and definitely a tasty beer."
"Started off unremarkable but decent, gets a little gross. Don't know if I got a crappy bottle or what, but this was not doing it for me."
"overall i guess i'm impressed, having a limited amount of pumpkin ales to compare it to. i would also guess it would pair well with indian cuisine or some asain fare. recommended."
"Overall: A tasty, well balanced pumpkin beer. Very drinkable. Good spice level."
"O: While this beer looks great, it is very much a let-down in the flavor department. Not enjoyable at all and went down the drain before I was halfway through the bottle."
"O: Nothing bad, but I've been drinking lots of pumpkin ales this month and this one doesn't really stand out."
"O - Not impressed with this pumpkin ale, not terrible, but not great."
"Overall weird, not quite my style despite that I love sours, this just doesn't fit like it should. Not sure if it's supposed to be like that or it's infected, but doesn't bide too well."
"It's a fine, inoffensive tasting beer that suggests the taste and pumpkin somewhat. It's not earth shaking or spiritual in any regard, but I'd much rather be drinking this than a macro-brew."
"Drinkable, but not one I'd turn to regularly."
"Pours a nice, deep, pecan-brown. Clearish with a white ring that washes the glass. Smell is of spices, cinnamon and nutmeg. Some decent pumpkin flavor comes through, but is muted by a hot and acrid taste on the back end. Finishes a little sour. Feel is a bit thin. OK, but the aftertaste keeps this from being exciting."
"Tried the Ichabod Ale yesterday at our local Tap House Bar & Grill. The beer came in a pint glass. The color was a rich clear amber with decent white foam that laced at the top....not so much at the bottom. I'm suffering from allergies currently so my smell might be a little off, but I smelled more cinnamon and nutmeg than I did pumpkin. The taste started like a typical red ale, then the cinnamon really took over. The pallat was left clean, but then the pumpkin start to come out. As the beer warmed the flavor because more robust. This is a very good pumpkin beer. The mouthfeel was docked slightly due to the spicey cinnamon flavor...made it so one is probably enough. Good job Holland!"
"Overall, dissapointed in the end with the flavour, the nose was promising but it lacks body and taste. Too high of an abv for such a lack of body as well."
"Ichabod Ale pours a darker amber color, with a small but lacing head. There is a strong pumpkin smell, very autumish. The taste has a nice creamy pumkin taste, with hints of some other spices. I found it easy to drink, and very enjoyable. Overall I found this a pretty good pumkin ale, not the best, but very enjoyable."
"O - have had much better pumpkin ales, not a horrible version, a great beer at the beginning with a poor ending"
"O: Nice looking pumpkin ale. Tastes and smells like what you would expect, though nothing extraordinary. Can't really compare this to the Tommyknocker since that is brewed with molasses."
"O: Not very good. They missed the boat on this beer as there is just too much spice, not enough pumpkin and an overall mess. Quite lame if you ask me."
"This is a very nice ale with a hint of pumpkin and spices. Not a huge pumpkin taste compared to other pumpkin beers."
"D - is a refreshing beer, not lots of extreme flavors, little to zero hops encountered."
"Overall, I like this pumpkin ale the best of what I have tried so far this season. It doesn't have the creamed corn funk that I noticed with the Pumking and Punkin Ale. If I were to choose between the three again next fall, I'll go with Ichabod. I know I'm probably in the minority with this one."
"Overall, this pumpkin beer is lost among the rest. It's certainly drinkable but nothing to really seek out. The initial taste on it is good, but it just dies after that. I think New Holland can do better."
"I'd say it's good, but doesn't quite come up to Pumking."
"O: I'm a lover of pumpkin beer & I'm also a fan of New Holland. However, NH Ichabod Pumpkin Ale.. not so much. This beer was a let down."
"I give a Schlitz for Ichabod. Regardless of its minimal faults, it still feels like fall. That's good enough."
"Overall Impression- While I'm on this hunt for the best Pumpkin Ale, my cousin Mark mentioned this one while we were sampling. I picked one up and this will be my last time from New Holland. Very weak and almost didn't resemble a Pumpkin Ale at all... Not going to be a negative person on this brew but wouldn't recommend... Schlafly is still the best!"
"So-so, the bitterness is unwelcome from what I expect out of a pumpkin beer. Otherwise, just a bit bland and boring. Easy enough to drink but not what I would look for if I wanted a pumpkin ale."
"Overall - It was okay. I thought the smell was going to give it a much more pumpkin taste, but it was really more of a spice bomb than anything else."
"When I first smelled and tasted this beer, I though """dang, that's good.""" But it went gradually downhill from there. It's not terrible, in fact I still think it's pretty good. But the pumpkin, so present at first, just seems to disappear, leaving the flavor thin and uninspired. Weird."
"O- its a light pumpkin ale but tasty"
"Medium bodied with a real smooth feel to it, but lacking a bit on the finish. A good beer overall, but the pumpkin flavors never really do too much for me in the end"
"Overall: Unfortunately, I wasn't a huge fan of this one. I look more for allspice, cinnamon, and vanilla to be highlighted in a pumpkin ale. Ichabod is probably fairly polarizing, though. Some might really enjoy the way that New Holland has tweaked their ingredient list, but in my opinion, what they wound up w/ has nothing on the classic pumpkin pie/pumpkin ale aroma/flavor. Not a drainpour, but also not one I'd try to get my hands on again."
"Overall not a very good pumpkin ale."
"Overall, it is just OK. Spice is subtle, but also forgettable."
"Pours see-through reddish amber with bubbly white head. Smells of cinnamon, pie with crust. Tastes of pumpkin pie crust, cinnamon, and some hops towards the finish. Light bodied with medium carbonation that zaps the tongue. A pumpkin that's a session with dessert flavors."
"Not bad but not my favorite for the style."
"O - Ichabod is a true pumpkin ale, with an ample dose of pumpkin flavor and well-balanced spicing and hopping that allow the pumpkin and malt backbone to shine thru. It this respect, it is an exceptional Fall seasonal. Can serve as an excellent standard for the style."
"Pours a brownish copper with a small off white head that didn't stick around too long. Smell is reminiscent of pumpkin with nutmeg and cinnamon, also some sweet malt notes thrown in. The taste starts with with the malt and subtle sweet notes, not as sweet as other beers of this style. The flavors then quickly shift to the cinnamon and others, very spicy finish, but not overwhelming. Great pumpkin flavors weaved in. This one had nice carbonation and a medium mouthfeel, it was smooth and enjoyable, and didn't overwhelm the palette. Could have multiple beers and not be put off by the spices. An enjoyable pumpkin beer, worth checking out."
"O - A weak offering that I had high hopes for, I won't be switching away from Punkin just yet..."
"Alright, some more Autumn seasonals working their way into the Bliss tastings. This one pours a clear dark tawn topped by a finger of dirty off-white foam. The nose comprises nutmeg, cinnamon, brown sugar, rye bread, toffee, and a touch of butterscotch. The taste brings in more of the same, though the breadiness kicks into higher gear here. The spices are slightly muted, blending into the bread (creating a sort of banana bread quality). There may or may not be a hint of toasted pumpkin seeds in there as well...I can't tell for sure. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly creamy, slightly grainy feel. Overall, a generally enjoyable pumpkin beer. Nothing is done to any great degree, but that probably helps (keeps things from going too far)."
"O- This is one of my favorite pumpkin beers out of the ones I have had. I like pumpkin beers but usually after one that is enough for me, this is much more drinkable than many of the pumpkin ales I have had. This one strikes a great balance between the malt and the spice. I had this on tap several times last fall and thought it was great, still holds up."
"Overall: Could have definitely been more bold. Nice mild flavor, so they go down pretty quick. Pretty forgettable. Not much there to savor."
"O: Pouring this was promising. Smell was inviting. Taste isn't bad just very light. Mouthfeel is very lacking. I still haven't had Dogfish's Punkin or Southern Teir's Pumpking. Have high hopes for these as all other pumpkin ales have let me down."
"The beer is orange and slightly hazy, with a half inch of tan head that leaves random lacing on the glass. The aroma brings pumpkins, sweet malt, and autumn spices. The flavor is sweet and somewhat artificial, with an abundance of spices. The body is thin, with malt presence overshadowed by spice. Overall, it's not a bad pumpkin beer, but not my cup of tea. Worth a try."
"This beer poured out as a pretty nice looking orange brown color, it's got a good amount of clarity to it also. The smell of the beer is a little spicy, it's nothing overwhelming by any means. The taste of the beer was pretty good, the pumpkin flavors up front with a light sweetness of brown sugar. The aftertaste of the beer has a pretty nice autumn spice to it with a light warming feeling. The mouthfeel is drinkable enough to have a few in one sitting. Overall this beer isn't too bad at all."
"D: This is quaffable to the point of getting sick of it, but it doesn't mean that I'd do it. Nothing completely offensive but nothing that will make me have another either."
"O: It's not that it was a terrible beer where I wouldn't drink it if it someone picked it up, but it really wasn't a pumpkin ale IMO. I had to almost imagine any traces of pumpkin or spices in it to convince myself that it was a pumpkin ale at all."
"O: Nothing memorable, smells better than it tastes and that's not saying a lot. More hops flavor than pumpkin and spices unfortunately. Bottle design is a decent twist on the Headless Horseman."
"Overall - A standard, weaker, easy drinker. This toned down version may actaully be good for a occasional seasonal drinker looking to get some pumpkin flavor. Its simply too watered down for anyone else that has had this style before."
"O: One and done."
"O-Nice attempt. not really the malt backbone to make the taste more prominent..."
"Mouth feel and overall - Light-bodied and far too sweet. In my opinion, not enough spice or pumpkin taste. Fizzy on the roof of your mouth. A bit skunk overall. Not my top pumpkin ale by a long shot."
"If you havent had it, try it; but I wouldnt recommend it."
"Im really not sure how they can call this one a pumpkin beer. Aggressive pour leads to nearly no head. Smell had quite a bit of cinnamon which was pretty much the only taste that stuck out to me. Nearly no pumpkin taste which was disappointing given its a pumpkin beer."
"Pours out an amber body with a thin whitehead that disappears quickly. The retention and lacing on here are okay, but not great. Has decent carbonation. The smell is pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg and hops. The taste starts out with some pumpkin, but than the spices kick in and get a strong cinnamon flavor followed by some floral and pine hops. The aftertaste is a mix of pumpkin, cinnamon and pine. The mouthfeel is sticky and semi-dry and overall this is a nice beer to enjoy, but if you want a pumpkin ale with a better pumpkin flavor I'd suggest trying O'Fallen Pumpkin Beer."
"Conclusion: I wouldnt recommend this beer to someone looking to try their hand at a good pumkin beer. On the other hand, I would probably recommend this to someone who isnt very fond of pumkin but might want to give the style a try. Still, who the hell wants to drink a pumpkin ale without much pumkin?"
"Cheers!"
"Pours a nice amber w/ a fairly weak sliver of a head. Head quickly disappears to almost nothing. Very clear looking beer, you can see right through it. Very little carbonation or lacing. Nose is that of nutmeg, cinnamon, pumpkin, malt, hops. Nutmeg and cinnamon out in front. I wish more pumpkin was there. Taste is slightly different, with cinnamon and pumpkin coming to the front, while everything else takes a step back. Feel is fairly malty, w/ a slight hop bite in the background. This is not my favorite pumpkin ale, but it's a decent one to pick up if you haven't tried it. Cheers!"
"Overall I thought it was a pretty fair representation of a pumpkin ale. I had heard really good things about it and had this beer recommended to me by co-workers and colleagues but I'm not particularly impressed. I have however a fan of other New Holland brews like the Dragon's Milk."
"Worth trying if you're a pumpkin beer fan. If you aren't, it's hit or miss."
"Poured out the lightest of the three with a hazy orange tinted amber color and a nice soft off white head that reached a height of around an inch or so before it settled down with some nice lacing on the side that really just surprised me with how well it hung in there to be honest. Really quite the solid look. Nice aroma of pumpkin spice, hints of cinnamon and nutmeg, all the usual characters here with a touch of a west coast hop flair to it, especially as it warms. Crisp and super clean flavor here. Starts with a touch of a light malt note and then swoops in with a big hit of cinnamon and nutmeg which dries out the palate very nicely. Very even consistency I have to admit as it comes together very nice. Light drying of palate leaves a touch of light spice and the lightest hint of hops on the back of the tongue. Super drinkable, in fact out of the whole night I enjoyed this one the most out of all of them."
"Not bad, but the spices seem to hurt drinkability in this case. Nothing I would want more of."
"D-I could see myself having a couple...but not if a better pumpkin ale were about...I am glad I tried it and would drink it again."
"D. Very drinkable if you're in the mood for such a thing. Clean finish contributes to drinkability."
"Overall this is my fall brew of choice and I pickup multiple cases of this when it comes out on the shelves. A fall seasonal as great as the artwork that graces it's box."
"Drinkability: I'm still on a quest to try all sorts of different pumpkin beers. I'm not sure this one will end up in my crate next year, but I'm sure it'll be had again."
"From fall brew ranking notes (2010): Pour produced a yellow-amber body with a quick diminishing head. The aroma is funky, reminiscent of cooked squash. The palate is on the flat side with light carbonation. Medium bodied. The overall flavor really isn't all that good, slightly metallic with spice that lingers and warms for a bit."
"Not the best pumpkin beer I've had but not the worst either."
"D-Wow this has to be the first pumpkin beer that I've had that the spice doesn't completely overwhelm the rest of the beer. This is by far the easiest drinking pumpkin beer yet."
"D - The drinkability is pretty good. I goes down easy and I think it's a good fall beer. I think this would be a good one to have with a big slice of pumpkin pie."
"I should mention I am not a fan of Pumpkin Ales. Ichabod was purchased as part of a New Holland variety pack so I thought I would give-it-a-go. Ichabod is not a bad Pumpkin Ale; I just wish the flavor was richer."
"I would recommend this to just about anyone."
"It tastes more like cinnamon, cinnamon water. It was not a ver good beer, very watery. New Holland failed me here."
"Good beer overall, solid offering. just not something for me."
"If I could change it, I would add a bit more pumpkin flavor. Very drinkable."
"D - Well the season is over and I will have to seek more out next year. Pretty drinkable pumpkin ale!"
"Sampled during the Winter 2010 tasting, brought by Timmy."
"This was the first time I've been disappointed by New Holland Brewing Co. They are one of my top 5 favorite American breweries and have never let me down until now. The beer wasn't bad, there just wasn't enough pumpkin spice character and New Holland rarely lacks character. One was enough for me."
"My very first pumpkin ale received as an extra in a trade. Pours a nice orange color with a little head. Light lacing. Smells just like a pumpkin and tastes a little like a pumpkin with that familiar beer taste afterwards. Like I said this was my first pumpkin beer so I can't really compare to others."
"Pours a hazy, copper/brown color. One inch head of an off-white color. Good retention and good lacing. Smells of sweet malt, pumpkin, spice (nutmeg and cinnamon), and hops. Fits the style of a Pumpkin Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, hops, pumpkin, spice, and slight pale malt. Overall, good blend, appearance, and aroma. More strongly a spiced beer than a pumpkin, but still good."
"Overall: Awesome."
"A Halloween tradition - pumpkin beer while giving out trick-or-treat candy. This beer was a bit of a letdown. Prominent allspice from start to finish, but the pumpkin was pretty much MIA. Fairly thin body and a little watery at the finish. Lacks festivity."
"Pours a perfect amber orange color with a foamy and lacy head that recedes slowly. Has a. Gram cracker aroma, like the crust but not overly sweet. Perfect balanced pumpkin and malt backbone with a tinge of astringent bitterness on the finish. Flvors of pumpkin pie, yams, and some orange peel. Great fall brew. Mouthfeel is very dry, like cinnamon powder. Overall this is a great brew. It really is underrated and has that true pumpkin pie taste to it."
"Pours an orangish brown with a light head. Nose brings a good dose of slicing with cinnamon, nutmeg, and clove. Mild pumpkin. The taste and feel are really both quite tainted by an excessive amount of spicing in comparison to anything else that is going on. In the end, this was just taken too far in one direction and there is no balance to this beer."
"D: Not very tasty, does not go down easily, not too filling, mild kick, not the best representation of style, there are several other beers in the style that I would choose over this one."
"The body is right where I would like in a pumpkin beer, medium/ full bodied. The added pumpkin may be adding some addition body or starchiness which I like and it finishes pretty smooth as well. Drinkability is above average. Overall a decent pumpkin ale."
"D- If the flavor didn't have that awful middle transition, I would probably drink this again. This has such stand out characteristics but some really distracting ones. If I could combine this with other run-of-the-mill pumpkin beers I might just have the best one possible."
"Pumpkins aren't my favorite and this isn't my favorite beer. Have one and move on."
"D: I had high hopes and expected more from this beer, the watery weak flavor and lack of flavor really kills it. I wouldn't seek it out again, however i would have no problem drinking one if it was offered to me. You can do a lot better than this if you're looking for a Pumpkin Ale."
"Drinkability: Fairly poor, almost no carbonation and weak flavor makes it seem more like a watery juice drink than a beer."
"Glad I only got one in a mix six. Pumpkin beers may not be my thing. I will definitely try a different kind in the future, maybe not this fall though."
"D: I will not have this again. Unsavory spices and fake pumpkin....not a good combination."
"D - Overall, Ichabod is a drinkable pumpkin ale but i've had many that were better. I will not be purchasing this one again. Alternatives? I enjoyed Southern Tier Pumking much more."
"That being said, it was much better than the other Pumpkin Beer I had this season. The mouthfeel was smooth but a little flat and lighter than expected. Really not a drinkable beer. I would not seek this out."
"Very enjoyable seasonal beer. Very drinkable with medium body mouthfeel."
"D - Ichabod is quite an unusual Pumpkin Ale. The appearance was pleasant and the mouthfeel is solid, but certain elements of the aroma and flavor kind of rubbed me the wrong way. I feel it is a bit too bitter for the style, and the spices outweigh the roasted pumpkin meat and vanilla attributes."
"Really a nice example of the style, not the biggest in terms of pumpkin (or pumpkin pie) flavor, but nice none the less... With so many other great pumpkin beers out there, this will probably not be one that I seek out, not one that I would turn down if offered, but would not go out of my way to find it either."
"It was a clear day for brewing and this beer was acceptable, I feel like I frequently don't give New Holland enough credit. BUT this beer is second to Dogfish Head and a few others in the world of Pumpkin Beers. I liked that the aromas and flavors weren't overwhelmed by the spices, but I could have used more maltiness and more... well... everything. Properly carbonated, properly colored... just not extraordinary."
"My first pumpkin ale. Glad I only bought a single. This beer mostly tastes like an amber ale with a very small amount of pumpkin and no spice. Smell is mostly malty amber lager with a bit of pumpkin. Appearance is that of weak tea. Drinkability and mouthfeel are okay, but nothing special. Carbonation is very light. Again, this is my first pumpkin ale, but this isn't what I was expecting. Hopefully the Dogfish one will be better. I'll let you know!"
"D-Im pissed I spent $13 on a 6 pack of this stuff. Not good at all. Weyerbacher Imperial Pumpkin is still the pumpkin beer to beat IMO."
"The mouthfeel is above average but nothing to write about, unless you're me and you feel you have to write about all aspects of every beer you drink. We'll, I'm like me, so here goes: Medium body, with creamy carbonation and an abrupt finish with lingering mild bitterness and spices. I like this beer, it's a good seasonal, but Elysian's Night Owl runs circles around it. For a more available alternative in the midwest, if you're willing to step up on the ABV's just a touch, go for the Heavy Seas Great Pumpkin."
"D- Very drinkable beer with less pumpkin flavor than I had expected. Actually very balanced compared to many beers of the style."
"In my personal opinion the more pumpkin the better this didn't have as much as I would have liked but still a very good offering. Very drinkable and well rounded flavors."
"This is a very drinkable pumpkin beer, but not really in a good way. It is refreshing, but not hearty and comforting like most fall offerings. This is not the worst pumpkin beer I have ever tasted, but it is also far from the best."
"The color was a nice orange for a crisp Michigan night. The head was just right, not too foamy. I really love the label too. The artwork fits perfectly."
"Drinkability: Comes across as a dry, heavily spiced Amber Ale more than a Pumpkin Ale. Very refreshing, even if not quite as expected. The battle cap said """quaff""" on the inside, which is very fitting for this beer."
"D= Really kind disappointed in this beer thought it would be a lot better than it was but it really failed me don't need to try this one again. I haven't really found a pumpkin beer that I like."
"backyard bonfires."
"Overall one of the better pumpkin beers I've had this year."
"This beer pours with a deep, dark, hazy, golden color. The head is lovely but doesn't hang around for long. It does, however, leave a beautiful ring around the glass. Upon first sniff, there are very distinct notes of cinnamon, with just a hint of clove and ginger. The cinnamon is front and center in the taste. It finishes with a little pumpkin pie flavor to it. Pretty limited hop presence (just a bit in the finish). Overall, an excellent example of one of the many reasons I love Fall so much; but, as with all fruit/vegetable beers I can only drink so many in one sitting (which is maybe a good thing!)"
"This beer pours an orangish-golden body with a gentle carbonation of tiny bubbles and a thin cream head that is a bit soapy. The body has a very faint haze to it. The smell of gingerbread spices and graham crackers is strong but not chemical. A note of honey and some pale malt along with a faint spiciness that might be hops give it more support. The taste of ginger and cinnamon with some nutmeg and pale malt give this a spicy taste. Note of pepper and a carbonic acid or chalkiness combine with the dry taste at the finish. medium mouthfeel with no astringency or alcohol warmth. This beer has a very good balance of spices and has some good malt to play a supporting role. It would be nice to see some more malt or hops or alcohol help balance the spices perhaps."
"D/M: Nice subtle carbonation really brings out the flavor. While being a full beer, its not too over powering and would be great on a cold day."
"this beer was alright, iv noticed this year that im not digging the pumpkin ales as much as i was last year, maybe my palate changed, maybe my im just bored with them, or maybe my memories of how they tasted last year are exaggerated to i feel like im being let down, that being said both my brother and girlfriend loved this beer so to each their own, have one more bottle left and ill give it a shot at halloween"
"Poured a clear amber body w/ a one-finger head that died quick and left minimal lace on top of a rather pedistrian aroma as barely any spices poke out; aroma seems to be muted for some reason. A creamy, stiff pumpkin beer that isn't bad but seems like it's been made for mass consumption. The pumpkin and nutmeg spice are minimal and the beer passes very lightly, even watery for a pumpkin beer. Crisp backbite w/ spicy pepper edge is decent finish. A good beer but one is enough for me."
"D- Overall a decent pumpkin ale, don't think it's one of my top 3, but it's a solid beer."
"Drinkability: its alright, I would have preferred it to have been a litter heavier and had some of a pumpkin taste, but it was rather drinkable even with all the spice."
"All in all i did enjoy this beer. I'm usually not a spice beer kind of guy, but this one kept my interest for the most part."
"Very drinkable and goes down really smooth for a spice beer."
"Pumpkin ales can vary a lot in flavor but this one is towards the spicy end of the category. I'd say it's a good beer in general and I would buy this one again, especially if it was a 6-pack or on tap."
"d-Pretty high I thought. I would drink it all night as a decent beer but would not buy it if I was looking for a pumpkin beer."
"The mouthfeel on this beer was played pretty well. It has a moderate carbonation and a semi full and creamy feel. Pumpkins could have played into this, as far as I know that's predominately what they are for anyway's."
"D: Yeah, I really do like pumpkin beers. I like that this doesn't stray to far towards sweet/'artificial' flavors that often turn folks off to the style; spice and earthy dryness are good things. Still, this won't rank among the better ones I've had. Worthy of a try, especially if you like the style."
"Overall, its a great pumpkin. A lot of breweries screw this up, but I think New Holland took a good route. Still can't compete with my yearly homebrew pumpkin, but that's kind of the point."
"Overall, I have had many many many pumpkin beers and this will be a one and done for me as there are much better examples of the style both imperial and regular versions."
"Drinks average at best. There are other pumpkins that I would much rather drink."
"Not the best pumpkin ever but certainly serviceable and well worth trying."
"To me, there's nothing more welcoming in Fall than the aroma of pumpkin roasting in the oven. One sniff of this beer and I am reminded of that feeling. This clear medium amber brew has a wonderfully roasty malt and pumpkin spice balanced flavor. Good mouthfeel and body. Finish is clean malt and pumpkin. Nods to birchstick for this one - great trade!"
" Worth a shot, and not to mention very easily drinkable..."
"Poured from the bottle into my Stone RIS snifter. Poured an amber to dark brown with about a half inch of head. The aroma consisted of mostly nutmeg with a little bit of pumpkin thrown in. The taste was the same. The pumpkin wasn't as much of a factor as I would have liked, and I couldn't tell cinnamon was even used. It seems like they used too much of the nutmeg. I did kill my 6 pack of this over memorial day weekend so it was pretty enjoyable. However, this is one of my favorite breweries and I felt they could have done better."
"Tried this brew, and going from memory, wasn't a huge fan last time I had it several years ago, but funny going from memory I was never a huge fan of pumpkin, vegetable or fruit beers in general. BUT, on my revisit, I have to say, it has grown on me now that I went to the store with a taste for, a spiced beer (someone mentioned Great Lakes Christmas Ale a few weeks back, so this one hit the spot). Ok, so, the color, let's say, burnt pumpkin orange, it looks malty, but doesn't smell overwhelmingly malty, and has some hops to balance things out a little. Ultimately, this beer smells like a pumpkin pie on first whiff, like a fresh grandma's pumpkin pie, not a canned pumpkin pie filling, or, a stale beer frat house mixed with pumpkin flavoring, but a nicely put together pumpkin beer, and hell, it tastes the same way too. So, for what it is worth, this is the best pumpkin beer I have tried to date, cause this will probably be the LAST pumpkin beer this season, maybe it got an unfair advantage given my history with it, but I do have good tastes, and I know what I am doing so,...trust me, this one is good, it is worthy, IF you truly want a pumpkin pie beer. Now, do you?"
"D - not a bad pumpkin ale by any means, however I think there is too much nutmeg and cinnamon that amplify flavors I enjoy being more complementary rather than dominating in pumpkin ales. Worth a try, but I think I'll stick to Schlafly when it comes to buying Pumpkin Ales."
"Drinkability: A fairly average pumpkin ale, but still a good one. Glad I got to try this as it's not available in NY (I think), but if it were it would not be the first pumpkin ale I'd go for."
"D - Easy to drink and taste good. More of a dinner beer then session one though."
"T- Very cinnamony. At times its like a cinnamon roll. Other spices create a blend. Pumpkin helps sweeten things up. As it warms hops become slightly noticeable at the finish. They are grassy."
"D: Drinkable, but not particularly memorable."
"I poured this one into a Guinness pint glass. It poured a watery, translucent charcoal tinged orange with almost no head. The smell is rich with cinnamon, nutmeg, real pumpkin and perhaps ginger. The taste is pretty bold and very spicy. The nutmeg and cinnamon are at the forefront. It's almost bitter with the spiciness. It's light and crisp and refreshing. I've certainly had better pumpkin beers so I was a little disappointed in the Ichabod."
"Went surprisingly well with a bowl of Doll'ed-up pickled-vegetable flavored ramen noodles with lemongrass tofu, cilantro and vegetables. Still not my cup of tea though, except maybe as a party novelty."
"This is my first beer into the pumpkin realm. The pour into a pint glass was a orange color. Almost no head at all just a white haze lines the top of the glass. The drinking of this beer is one that I really enjoyed. The pumpkin is subtle, but still strong enough to know what I'm drinking. I put down 3 of these without thinking twice, and I really enjoyed this beer. I look forward to trying some more pumpkin beers next fall. I would recommend this to anybody who was curious about it."
"Thanks to the balance and light body this is pretty drinkable. Id certainly recommend it to fans of the style, although this isnt one of my favorites, with its slight emphasis on clean malts over pumpkin."
"Hazy orange body topped by a very thin ring of fine bubbles. aroma is faintly of pumpkin pie - nutmeg comes through the most. Flavor is a bit metallic, somewhat artificial tasting. The pumpkin spices just don't blend with the malt and hop profile. Body is also a little thin - seems almost watery with respect to the pumpkin flavor. Drinkability is poor - I saved a few of these hoping they would improve, but it's still the same disappointing beer I bought in the fall. That being said, nobody's perfect. Most of New Holland's line is well above average."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is OK, the spices become a little much for me after a while. It's a decent pumpkin beer but nothing spectacular. My personal preference is more pumpkin and less spices and this leans more on the spices then the pumpkin."
"A fine brew, a fine pumpkin, but more spiced than pumpkiny. For some reason I had this impression that New Holland was a """good""" brewery, but I'm starting to think it's more """mediocre""" than anything else. In any case, drinkable, if not memorable."
"I'm not a huge fan of pumpkin beers, but of the pumpkin beers I've had, I would put this in second place behind O'Fallon. I like the fact that the spices are not overpowering, which definitely adds to the drinkability. Like other New Holland brews, a tasty effort, but certainly not the best in the style."
"Drinks well, definately sessionable."
"As for drinkability, one of these was plenty and I was ready to look for something different, even if it was a different pumpkin beer. It sounds like I'm really cracking on this beer and I don't mean to, but it is very average and, well, kinda boring."
"A rather bland beer, and there's a taste of pumpkin, but without much spicing. That would be okay, I guess, but the base beer isn't that interesting. Still-in-all it drinks well enough, as it is inoffensive and isn't too sweet or spicy."
"D - This one may end up being a drain pour for me, but maybe I'm just not a fan of the style. I think I'd like this more if it was a stout flavored with pumpkin, not something this light."
"Pours a slightly cloudy golden with about a finger of head. The head dissapeared before I was done smelling the beer. Almost no smell whatsoever. Pumpkin taste is very subtle but tends become more evident as a slightly spicy aftertaste. Not nearly as over-powering as most pumpin beers I've had. I enjoy the more subtle flavoring. SOlid, but not a great choice, but better than most pumpkin beers."
"Purchased from Discount Liquor in Milwaukee, WI. Pours a very hazy pale amber body with a thin white head. Aroma is pie spices, most notably nutmeg. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. The nutmeg and spices are up front with the malt sweetness. Some faint pumpkin flavors are noticed in the finish. A good pumpkin beer, but not my favorite."
"Strange taste to me hard to describe, somewhat bitter with no real pumpkin or pumpkin spice taste. Hint of pumpkin spice in after taste. It was drinkable but not very pumpkin."
"Drinkability: decent beer for the season. Goes down easy and hits the spot if you are looking for the style."
"Overall another less then impressive pumpkin ale to add to my list of beers I never have to try again."
"Full mouthfeel with good carbonation."
"Overall- this to me is like a water with some pumpkin spice to it. not alot going on here. i would recommend this to someone who wants a light craft pumpkin brew. people rip on shipyard's pumpkin and i think that one is better."
"B+ is my overall thoughts. Like the other New Holland brews this would be a great beer to introduce people to the style. However for dedicated followers it seems a bit on the mild side."
"D - A respectable pumpkin ale, but not much more than that... Quite timid all the way around... Not off-putting in any way, just uninspired... Highly quaffable..."
"D) light enough to swig down a few"
"Cheers!"
"Note: I did not notice too much of a """cask""" nature to this beer."
"D - not bad, but not something I would seek out - a bit too much pumpkin for me."
"Pours a light golden oranange in color, some haze present. Moderate fluffy head with minimal lacing. Smell is of grains, bread, unsweetened pumpkin puree. Taste is malt forward with mild unsweetened pumpkin puree, minimal fall spicing (as opposed to pumpkin pie spicing, if you get my drift). Light bodied, full carbonation... becomes creamier as it sits. Tastes more like an English Pale Ale with pumpkin notes than a full blown pumpkin ale."
"Drinkabilty:I could throw a few of these back. Very pleasant balanced subtle pumpkin taste, with a nice color that has halloween written all over it!"
"Medium-light body with appropriate carbonation. None of the flavor components are overwhelming, which certainly aids the drinkability. Not a bad start to my mini pumpkin ale tasting."
"D- I could definitely see putting a few of these down. Not anything special but a good beer for the season."
"I was not a big fan of the flavor profile but coupled with the lighter body and crisp finish, it makes it slightly more drinkable."
"Overall, one of the better pumpkin ales I've had this season so far. Looking to expand further with the pumpkin ale soon."
"This is a nicely crafted ale that isn't too subtle or too assertive. Definitely try this one if you're looking for a good pumpkin ale."
"this is a pretty refreshing beer for a fall seasonal, not as good as pumking but still very good. definately worth a shot."
"While there's nothing bad about this beer, it doesn't stand up to others that I've had in this and past seasons."
"Overall, pretty good beer. Its my first pumpkin beer ever and I wouldn't mind trying a few others in the future. It goes well with the Fall season."
"Drinkability: One of the better pumpkin ales I've sampled. Not heavy on the spice, a prominent sweet pumpkin taste. A very drinkable brew."
"D - This is a pretty good pumpkin beer. You gotta like the labels with the headless horseman."
"Drinks really easy, one of the better pumpkin ales out there"
"D- This is a drinkable beer but I would not want to have a 6 pack of this. Maybe 3 or 4 but not six. Not the best pumpkin ale out there but not the worst pretty above average I suppose."
"D: A pretty good pumpkin ale. Nothing offensive or out of whack to this one, but it could use a more pumpkiny flavor. It's rather herbal and surprisingly unsweetened, although not really in a bad way. An accessible pumpkin ale and a worthwhile fall seasonal."
"Poured an amber with a respectable head that faded to a patchy skin. The aroma was mild squash. The taste was weak, this is a beer that you can spice the hell out of, so why weak?. Mouth feel was light bodied with a ample carbonation. Drinkability was OK. Taste was weak, beer was weak. I'm disappointed in New Holland with this one."
"Goes down easy and is an ok example of a pumpkin ale, but it is a little watery and lacks depth of any kind."
"I didn't previously comment, but this is a very pricey seasonal. I understand that costs for a low volume brew might be slightly higher, but if the end product taste isn't exceptional, the high price is not justifiable. It is well made and free from any skunkiness or other rudeness. $10.99 for 6 was steep, though."
"A good fall seasonal, I think."
"Pretty clear copper colored body. Small white head doesnt last for too long. Nose is mostly pumpkin with some malt. Probably some cinnamon notes as well. Taste is pretty complex for the style, malt front with pumpkin obviously, along with cinnamon and some other spice notes as well. Kind of a thin mouth, fairly wet. I kind of like the pumpkin beers as a fall treat anyways, but this one is probably one of the better ones i've had. Pretty tasty"
"Overall a nice offering for the season, I would buy again."
"(D)- A decent beer that fits the style well. A basic and straightforward beer, but fine to enjoy."
"Drinkability: Pumpkin beers tend to not be very exciting, but this one is quite nice. Can't wait to have more when it gets a little cooler outside."
"This is an excellent choice when making the pumpkin ale selection. I will be buying up quite a bit of this brew before the season is out."
"Pours a glowing copper orange body with a bright white head floating above, with fine speckled lacing as it settles. Aromatics offer up a nice vegetable gourd smell with pumpkin pie spice additions. Flavor has a nice base beer before the pumpkin and spice additions, very balanced between amber ale, pumpkin ale, and spice ale if that makes any sense. Each component is in balance with each other it doesn't hit me over the head with spice or pumpkin and at the end of it I know it's still a beer. Not too candy with the subtle spicing is a win in my book. Mouthfeel is medium bodied a touch of stickiness but never becomes cloying carbonation level is on with a bit of effervescence carrying things along. Drinkability overall is what every pumpkin beer should be able to pull off, balance and a nice level of drinkability."
"Pours a nice orange color with a bit of nice head and lacing. Nice clean scent, slightly malty with just hints of pumpkin. Good flavor, a nice malty beer with the slightest hints of pumpkin and spice. Not the deepest pumpkin ale, nor my favorite, but a good one for starting someone out that way if they like a nice amber ale. Goes down very smooth."
"Drinkability: Not too bad - flavors are OK and they get better as the drink warms; not the best pumpkin ale that I've had thus far, but far from the worst (I think that distinction would go to Buffalo Bill's...) - it's easy to drink, a little refreshing and the ABV is quite moderate so it's not like you're going to be hammered after one or two."
"Had high hopes for this elusive pumpkin ale from Ichabod in Michigan which as i understand, just recently began shipping to NJ... Their pumpkin ale leaves much to be desired... Bland, lacking adequate carbonation, flavor, essence, and style... Regular at best and definitely nothing to write home about... Peace Lady M"
"I guess I don't really know what I was expecting. This was my first pumpkin beer, but it didn't seem to have much pumpkin flavor to it. I'll have to try a different kind soon."
"12oz bottle served in a shaker pint glass. Poured a clear reddish gold with a finger of white head. Fairly subdued nose of typical pumpkin pie spices (cinnamon, allspice, ginger) Medium bodied with a decent amount of malt. More of the pumpkin pie spices in the flavor, also a fair amount of hops that show up in the finish. Solid pumpkin beer, maybe a bit restrained."
"Easy enough to drink just wish it had more flavor to be more appealing to do so"
"D = This is a very approachable beer for the style. One that is quite drinkable rather than just a big spice bomb."
"Now that I've tasted it, the aroma is changing a bit...but the beer itself feels hollow...like it's job isn't quite being achieved. I think that the ultimate goal of brewing a pumpkin beer is to achieve a beer that tastes more like pumpkin pie, not pumpkin itself...this one tastes more like a cracker with some spices thrown on top."
"Drinkability: Not bad, I could drink this again. It's not spectacular, though."
"Mouthfeel is just about perfect, really a pleasant finish and and a good feeling. Drinks slowly and I really don't think I could drink more than a couple at one time. Good but not great."
"Blipped """Headless Horseman""" by Pigmy Love Circus"
"Picked this one up just to try it as I've only had one other pumpkin ale. Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, pours a hazy dark orange color with virtually no head (what head is there is a white and disappears quickly). Leaves little if any lacing down the glass. There isn't much to the smell, some spices and maybe some cinnamon and pumpkin in there. Luckily there is more to the taste. Spices right away and then some pumpkin in the aftertaste. I was hoping for more pumpkin taste but still there it's there I was just hoping for a bit more. Goes down refreshingly though. I think a little more pumpkin taste comes out when it warms up a bit. Overall it isn't bad. I may pick it up again but I'm going to try some others first. If given the opportunity I wouldn't turn one down though."
"drinkability is ok - this is a very light pumpkin ale - doubt i buy another 6er this year - this beer makes me want some schlafly pumkin now thats a pumkin beer with some booze and heat needed for those cold fall nights - but it still is summer and new hollands fits the bill i guess"
"Don't drink and review."
"drinkability is good. for a pumpkin beer this one has the spiced character and the herbal notes that are true to style, but overall it lacks body and richness. with more substantial malt notes and a bit more body, this could be a great pumpkin beer."
"Pours an orangish amber color with a two finger head. The head disappears quickly and gives way to very little lacing. The smell is of pumpkin and ginger and maybe nutmeg. The smell is a strong pumpkin. The taste is of pumpkin and nutmeg with some ginger. The taste is a little strong than the post road pumpkin. The mouthfeel is carbonated and it is slightly harsh. Overall it is a medium of the good drinkable beer. You could drink a six pack but more than that and the pumpkin might be too much."
"Overall, not something I would drink again. Just doesn't seem to be my style. It is interesting and worth a shot, but nothing to buy or drink a lot of."
"12 ounce bottle poured into an Imperial pint glass. Appears a clear medium apricot color with about a finger of eggshell colored foam. The head fades after a few minutes. Smells and tastes of mildly spiced pumpkin bread with notes of nutmeg, cinnamon and brown sugar. This pumpkin ale is medium bodied with ample carbonation for the style. Try mixing Ichabod with some Southern Tier Creme Brulee Stout - very tasty."
"Final Thought: A little disappointed in New Holland for placing this inferior brew in an excellent seasonal 12-pack... I'll let this one pass."
"The mouthfeel is on the light side. Overall, it's fairly drinkable brew, but it's lack of interesting characteristics might make me lose interest."
"Not too bad but the strong spices limit the drinkability."
"Spiciness is kept in check. Sweet pumpkin and bread-like flavors with a pretty surprising hop bitterness. Smooth and creamy from good carbonation and easy to drink. Most of all, it's very """clean""" tasting and feeling."
"Update: I bought several New Holland beers in one of the brewery's variety packs. I experimented by mixing half of an Ichabod with half of a Cabin Fever (brown ale) and loved it. The whole was greater than the sum of its parts."
"Lighter flavor than the nose indicates, earthy hops and mild spices are the most noticeable. Tastes fresh and somewhat lager-esque. A decent fall session beer and might even be passable for a festbier. Somewhat tasty, but not at all memorable."
"The hit on the tongue is thin, rather clean and crisp. Finishes with a little more body as the pumpkin flavor builds. Left me wishing for a tad more malt in the body to balance the taste."
"Overall, this turned out to be a nice beer - nothing special, but Pumpkin Ales are so hard to nail... have to give this one credit for being an easy drinker - good call for a 6 pack on a warm fall evening."
"Pours copper with a creamy off-white head. Aroma of cinnamon and nutmeg with some sweet pumpkin in the background that blends well with the malt. Medium body with lots of sharp carbonation. NIce pumpkin flavor,with just a touch of spice. Very crisp and refreshing. I could only drink maybe one at a sitting but A solid offering for sure."
"Taste: It's much better here. The pumpkin flavor is much more apparent, as are the pumpkin pie spices (cinnamon and nutmeg). I'd prefer to have a tad more spice flavor. It's definitely skewed toward the pumpkin, but it's still good. The pumpkin flavor just comes across too much. It is malty and a little sweet. Hops emerge on the tail and give it a little bit of a bite. That's a nice touch that works really well here. It finishes dry and a little bitter."
"Eric"
"Ichabod doesn't blow my head off. It's pretty close to Cottonwood's Pumpkin Ale, if that rings a bell, yet despite the caramel-y maltiness, not quite as good as that. Of the four New Holland beers I've had so far, this is the only one that even approached disappointing, but it's okay and worth a try."
"D-Moderately drinkable beer. One of the several enjoyable pumpkin ales I've tried, I like that the pumpkin flavors are not so overpowering as to be trying on my tastebuds, instead being enjoyably moderate."
"Pours a clear and glowing golden orange and topped with a finger and a half of frothy white head held up under a few lazy ropes of carbonation. First pumkin beer and aroma is rather interesting, slightly smokey with whiffs of pumpkin pie and a dash of cinnamon. Not really what I was expecting in the flavor department. A big taste of ginger and cereal grains, finishes with a slightly creamy, and what seems to be vanilla, though I might argue otherwise (like a fake vanilla), sweetness. I sort of like this beer I have to admit, not over the top in any way."
"Overall: Thank you Orbitalr0x for this good beer. I liked it. I dont drink many pumpkin ales, but I would drink this one."
"Drinkability: Pretty good pumpkin ale. Can have a couple of these easily."
"D- pumpkin beer with a strong pale ale foundation, the spices and sweet malt against zesty hops attain a pleasant balance. that oft isn't the case with this style from what i've tasted but ichabod and dogfish head punkin' genuinely deserve high scores."
"Drinkability- Honestly at first I wasn't impressed by this Pumpkin Ale. It's very light and subtle and not really all that impressive. After a couple more pulls I'm appreciating it much more for what it is. I'm thinking all pumpkin brews have to be big and intense and flavorful (which this is not) but I'm liking what New Holland is going for here. Very drinkable, even sessionable Pumpkin Ale that is very approachable and tasty."
"Into a pint glass, pours a light golden amber with a nice bone white head of a half inch, and some nice lacing. The aroma is pretty slim, but some nice nutmeg, cinnamon, pumpkin were there. The taste is a bit better, again good spices, an all-around tasty brew with a bit of room for improvement. The mouth is solid, easy enough to drink, and a nice session pumpkin ale."
"Light orange/amber with moderate carbonation crowned with big off white head. The head dies a quick death. Nutmeg and allspice greet the nose. Unfortunately, not much pumpkin backs this up. The beer lacks sweetness and instead has mainly a bitter earthy aroma. When you sip this one, the pumpkin becomes evident among the above mentioned spices. Again very little sweetness. Overall, this is a thin rather bland beer that fortunately only comes once a year."
"D= I love New Holland beers but this was a total miss for me. Not very drinkable for me due to the unbalanced and odd taste profile. Others who enjoy the taste of this beer wold find it highly sessionable I imagine."
"In the mouth beer is smooth, well carbonated and flavors allow for a medium body. Solid, no watery finish and little to no alcohol presence that I get with some other pumpkin brews. Drinkability is good. I can drink a couple of these at one sitting."
"d: I was obligated to a six pack and it took me a few weeks to finally finish it. I wouldn't but it again, the aftertaste kind of turned me off to this particular pumpkin ale. I have had better."
"This pours a golden straw color with a touch of amber shading. The foamy cream colored cap retains well,before leaving some small,patchy lacing. The nose is sweet and malty,with hints of cinnamon and other subtle spices. This is a really nice pumpkin brew. Big,bold and fresh pumpkin pie flavors are very realistic. Lots of cinnamon and nutmeg upfront,followed by lightly roasted malts that taste like graham crackers. This Pumpkin Ale is pretty light bodied in comparison to some of the others I have had,the carbonation is also very light and almost non existent by the last couple swallows. This one hit the nail on the head,I'll have one of these over pumpkin pie any day!"
"Overall, this was a good example of the style. It is not on par with Weyerbacher Imperial Pumpkin, but the hop aspect of this sets it apart and allows it to dominate other beers of the style."
"D: I wouldn't want more than one or two, but that goes for this style. I'd have it again for sure."
"This has a pretty standard pumpkin and spice character, but with lighter malts. While most pumpkin ales have an amber or light brown base, this is more like a pale ale for plain, light biscuit malts. Frankly, I don't think it works as well as typical beers from the style. The slightly lighter body makes it more drinkable, but the sweet pumpkin flavor is off-balanced and not as pleasant."
"D - Very light and thin, simple to drink. Not my style of brew though."
"D - I'd rather have Bud light"
"D - Well done! This one is outstanding. This is the most authentic pumpkin beer I've ever had (although that authenticity is more like pumpkin pie filling than actual pumpkins...that's okay, because who eats raw pumpkin anyhow?)."
"Ichabod is a pretty standard pumpkin ale, a tad above average, surely better than those pumpkins that use flavoring vs the real thing. It's easy to drink, is spiced well and does what it should, but isn't particularly a standout."
"Fairly drinkable, but the long sweet aftertaste is not very desirable. A fairly middle-of-the-road pumpkin ale."
"Overall this is a well crafted spice ale. Not really a huge pumpkin taste. Better quality than most of the novelty pumpkin ales. Worth a try."
"The beer pours a slightly hazy dark golden/copper color with a quickly diminishing thin white head. The aroma is pleasant - noticeable pumpkin, some spices - clove, cinnamon, and nutmeg? The flavor is initially kind of salty; a little spice emerges along with some pumpkin. There isn't much malt or hop presence and hop bitterness is low, enhanced by a bit of tartness. Carbonation is moderate and body medium-full. Overall an interesting brew, the aroma is nice, but the flavor isn't. It could use more 'beer' flavor, more malt or more hop, as is it is simply a bland beer with a bit of spice/pumpkin flavor. The saltiness upfront is also quite odd. I didn't finish it."
"D- Not too bad of a brew, kind of got to be in the mood for this one. Worth a try for sure."
"Drinkability is """meh"""; I would've rather tasted the pumpkin than the in-your-face spices."
"This is the second pumpkin ale I've tried and I'm still looking for a really good one. I think I will seek out Dogfish Head's Punkin' Ale next to see how that stacks up."
"This is about as average as it gets. Not as bad as Shipyard or Jack's Pumpkin Spice, but it still leaves a little to be desired."
"Poured a nice Amber Color, nice 2 finger head that dissipated rather quckly, aroma was of clove and alcohol no Pumpkin or nutmeg in either the taste or smell! Not traditional pumpkin ale, good beer but pumpkin ale should well taste like pumpkin! But that's just me! Good Overall,but would not buy again!"
"D - Good beer."
"Copper/orange with a white head. Fair amount of lacing. Smell of pumpkin and some malt. When I taste it the first thing that I notice is the taste of pumpkin pie. The hops don't overpower the pumpkin flavor too much. It's a very pleasant beer and a nice break from the octoberfests this time of year."
"D - Could be I just don't get along well with pumpkin ales... this just doesn't really do it for me."
"Okay overall. Ive had much better and a little worse. I wont be buying this again."
"The flavor isn't much of an improvement, sadly. All I get are slight notes of pumpkin spice and sweet malts before an overly hoppy/bitter aftertaste washes through. The body is fizzy and thin, with a lingering bitterness that doesn't fit the style or benefit the experience. All in all, a relatively lack-luster brew. New Holland is either hit or miss, and this one definately misses in my book."
"D: This is pretty easy drinking beer and I would definitely take a couple of them. Sometimes spiced beers can be too overpowering or cloying but this one is not. Probably not the best pumpkin beer I have ever had but far from the worst. I would push for a bit stronger malt flavor and a little fuller body but all in all a good beer."
"This beer is really worth a try and would make a refreshing session drink"
"D: An easy drinker, certainly, and I wouldn't turn down more. I wouldn't complain with a little more robust flavour, but it's not a bad beer as it is, either."
"Pours a dark reddish brown in color. There is about an inch of head forms on the pour. But is gone quickly after the pour. Smell is very malty with subtle spice. Taste is more of the malts with a hint of pumpkin in the finish. Easy drinking and decent. Pretty basic pumpkin beer."
"mouthfeel is of good carbonation, spices finish while the malt and hop start things off nice, not bad"
"D - This is a decent enough beer, but it would work better with food than on it's own. The middle is so devoid of flavor while the beginning and end are chock full of bold flavor that it's difficult to imagine having a few of these."
"12oz bottle into a Boston Lager glass, pours a crisp pale orange with a thin diminishing head. Aroma was sharp pumpkin spice and caramel malt. The pumpkin spice was a little more subdued in the taste, but still present, caramel malt dominates the initial, and the pumpkin flavor seems to be reserved for the lingering finish. The beer is light crisp and refreshing with a bit of carbonation. This one is enjoyable, but there are better pumpkin ales out there."
"Drinkability: Overall a pretty solid and highly drinkable pumpkin ale. Enough flavors to balance each other out and meld well as the brew warms. Glad I picked up a 6-pack. New Holland doesn't blow me away, but rarely do they have brews that are less than solid."
"picked up a few singles at Total Wine Cary for an upcoming pumpkin themed tasting"
"Overall, I was impressed with this pumpkin ale. I've had many different offerings, and I have to say this is my favorite due to the sweet pumpkin taste and no harsh bitterness. Could easily drink a few of these."
"Pretty good pumpkin flavors in this one but I found the Post Road to be slightly better and DFH Punkin' much much better. Worth a shot though."
"D-Quite drinkable, dare I say very likable, but if I wanted a pumpkin ale, I would opt for something else. The pumpkin emerges more and more w/each sip, but never rises above the level of hop bitterness."
"The feel of the drink is fine, but I'm not compelled to drink any more of them. Unremarkable."
"New Holland's Ichabod pours a medium amber, and the white head that forms is decent enough; it begins fluffy and is retained for a moment before dissolving into a thin surface covering. The smell certainly betrays the maker's intent: there are hint of pumpkin pie spice, brown sugar, and pumpkin here. Unfortunately, most of this doesn't seem to have transferred to the flavor. It is more on the malty/hoppy side, almost like English Pale Ale with a touch of pumpkin than a true pumpkin-centered ale. Very little or no sweetness remains, and the bitter hops totally consume the finish and aftertaste, leaving no room for true pumpkin-ale characteristics. It's certainly not unpleasant to drink, but it doesn't reach up to a true archetype of the style for this reviewer."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, tart, and sweet."
"Smooth and easy drinking. Malty, definitely for bock fans. Several of these fresh would be welcome, only had a single...there's always next year."
"I got a finger's worth of bone-white, foamy head from pouring this one. The color was a deep amber with NE-quality clarity. The nose had a faint spiciness along with a subtle dryness that I just could not quite quantify. The mouthfeel was thin-to-medium with a light cinnamon flavor on the tongue. The finish had a really nice dryness along with a lingering cinnamon-spicy flavor. Better than Jaw Jacker, but still not the best pumpkin ale that I have had."
"The clear, dark gold (light orange?) beer was topped by a cap of fine white foam with a collar of large, soapy bubbles. There was some spotty lacing and it had decent head retention. The aroma was quite earthy, with notes of squash and musty fruit, plus a bit of perfumy spice. Same in the flavour along with low bitterness, but there was also a bit of clove spice in the finish. Medium bodied with carbonation on the low side. Fine carbonation. Pretty easy drinking. The spices seemed restrained compared to other pumpkin beers, which is a good thing."
"the best I've had thus far was 2007's """Ichabod Tripel""" only available at the autumnfest party. Oh man I wish I had a keg of that."
"Pours a hazy golden yellow color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy white head, which leaves some sticky lacing afterwards. The nose is malty, pumpkin, slight cinammon, slight nutmeg, and caramel. The taste is malty, slight sweetness, pumpkin, cinammon/nutmeg, and caramel. Medium body. Drinkable, a tasty pumpkin ale."
"Drinkability: Not much."
"With pumpkin beers you usually expect it to be sweet but this one sure surprised me with the kick in the butt that it gave me. I will be drinking this again next year."
"D- If I could only drink pumpkin beers and I had to choose only one, I might easily go for this one. It's quite drinkable, it showcases the pumpkin flavor and the spices are a great compliment without throwing pumpkin pie in your face. Recommended"
"I find it hard to drink this beer for an extended period of time due to it being so 'heavy'. It's like pumpkin pie and Thanksgiving. You crave it sometimes but you definitely aren't going to make this a standard beer to drink all the time. I'd drink this again as it's the best pumpkin ale I've had by far."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a subtle creaminess. Good steady carbonation. It makes itself known while still being drinkable. Overall, this is a pretty good pumpkin ale, just a little too much on the spices for me. Not really a brew I'd drink more than one of in a sitting."
"Drinkability - this is a good beer, but not a great one, at least not for a session beer, but this would probably be better served with dessert."
"Light orange in color without a significant amount of foam. Aroma of pumpkin pie spices. Neither a spectacular aroma nor taste. It didnt taste bad but given the choice between this beer and others there are many other that I would rather drink. The flavor was predominantly bready malt with the pie spices. Mouthfeel was good, carbonation was adequate."
"Overall: a well balanced seasonal beer that doesn't load up the spice and pumpkin so much to forget that it's a beer primarily. Just in the background, which some might consder a fault, but I liked because it give the hint of pumkin and spice without overwhelming the beer or my senses."
"Note: I've had this beer a couple times in the past and finally decided to review it a couple of weeks ago and ended up with a bad bottle. It had floaters in it and came out tasting super bitter. I'm glad I gave it another chance because it tasted much more like the decent beer I'd had times past."
"Drinkability: A disaster when I first tasted this in 2007, the 2011 version is nicely balanced with just enough pumpkin flavor and spicing"
"D: Passable, but one of the weaker pumpkin ales. I buy it every year hoping to be surprised and, so far, I find it hard to finish the 6 pack each time. Sadly, the best thing about this beer is how it looks..."
"Light body with a rough grainy texture. Uninteresting beer,just did't seem anything like most of the pumpkin beers i've tried. Not a beer i would recomend."
"It's easy to drink but not if you're in the mood for a pumpkin ale. I'm disappointed."
"D- It was a good beer as far as pumpkin beers go. I would prefer a little more taste at the beginning of a sip with less aftertaste."
"THe body is light and spicy, kind of wheaty too. There's nothing exceptionally bad about this beer, but I wouldn't ever get this again. It just doesn't sit well with me."
"Overall, this is a pretty mediocre pumpkin ale. Pretty thin and bland, really, but not offensively spiced. There are better ones out there, but this one isn't going to give you heartburn like some."
"D - I find this to be an easy drinking beer, but 2 or 3 might do it. Honestly, the spice gets dry on the palate after the second. I love pumpkin ales, but this has a pretty middle of the road flavor, standard."
"Well, I only lost $1.75 by buying a single ....no huge loss..."
"Excellent. Highly recommended."
"Pours a clean pale yellow with a small white head that did not hang around too long. Aromas of pumpkin and allspice. In the taste, allspice, pumpkin and a hint of alcohol. A bitter, spicey mouthfeel and a nice clean aftertaste. Nice hints of spice and pumpkin, mellow with a nice alcohol presence."
"EDIT: Wow! Cloves ahoy! After sipping this for a while a genuine spiciness crept up on my tongue and could be described as nothing but pure, unadulterated clove. Nice!"
"Wasn't too impressed with this beer when I had it on tap, but I'm liking it much better from the bottle. Poured a honey/yellow/copper color with a small white head. Not much retention. Smells very malty for a pumpkin ale, but with definite buttery pumpkin tones. Not terribly strong on the spices, but good. Same with the taste: malt, pumpkins, not a whole lot of the spice. Aftertaste of the malt, but with a nice balance of light hops. You don't always get that with pumpkins, which tend to go the sweeter route. Remarkably smooth on the mouthfeel. I really like how it feels. Goes with the buttery quality of the pumpkin. I still prefer my pumpkin ales a little more spicy, but this is good. A fine example of a session pumpkin ale."
"Overall this is a pretty good but not remarkable pumpkin ale. I would recommend letting this one warm up a bit before drinking, the true flavors really come out a lot more. This is my first fall seasonal of the year and I am happy with it. It's time to crack open another!"
"This is a pretty good pumpkin ale, in general. It has a strong pumpkin note obviously but its also has a bit of a bitter after-taste. Still very good pour with a decent light brown head. Fairly easy to drink, so if you like pumpkin, have a few. Not the best, but pretty damn good."
"Overall, one of the better pumpkin beers I've had. In some, the pumpkin takes a backseat, but in this it is right there for you to enjoy. Recommended."
"Best fresh."
"D- Awesome. Much better than I was expecting. I will be getting more of this."
"Drinkability was about average for one beer, more than one forget it."
"This is past its prime, due to biegaman being insistent on trying it! Pours a hazed golden, small white head forms, disappears pretty quick, some lace spots. Smell is odd, kind of funky, rotten pumpkin, some spice, toffee, vegetables, almost vinegar. Taste is a bit better, funky, spices, pumpkin, very vegetable like, weak finish. Mouthfeel is light bodied with light to medium carbonation. Odd, keeps things in perspective. Will get a fresher bottle next year. Thanks Harry!!"
"Pours a hazy golden with a huge runaway head that dissipates to a thin covering of bubbles in a few minutes. Smell is creamy even slightly soapy with some noticeable spice. The taste is creamy and silky from the pumpkin and there are noticeable hits of nutmeg and cinammon. Some hops in the back as well. Mouthfeel is a little thin but not bad and the carbonation is right.Moderately drinkable."
"D - The only constructive critism I can offer is again this beer lacked a dominating flavor to it. It lacked the characteristics that are essential to pumpkin beers. It felt watered down and lacked a strong malt character. The flavors that were present were very subtle and lacked uniqiness. This was a very drinkable beer it simply did not stick out at all amongst the other pumpkin beers available."
"Light copper color with some thin lacing. Sweet malts, light fruits, cinnamon, and some faint nutmeg in the nose. Immediate pumpkin flavor in the first sip and some noticeable hops notes for a nice balance. Clove and cinnamon round out the nice pumpkin flavor but doesnt over run it. Yeasty and bready and some mild brown sugar sweetness. Thin body and a watery mouthfeel that leaves a bubbly alcoholic residue in the finish. Plenty of carbonation to the end but a bit more than Id prefer from this style. On the good side this brew makes better use of pumpkin than others Ive had."
"Poured out extremely clear orangey yellow color with little head or lacing. The nose had plenty of nutmeg along with cinnamon and something graham cracker-like. The taste offered subtle pumpkin flavors with lots of nutmeg, and some allspice, clove, cinnamon, and ginger. Not a tremendous amount of malt of pumpkin here though. Fairly carbonated, but the spice sticks to your tongue in an unwelcome way."
"D - Overall not much flavor. I really had to hunt for anything other than malt and generic bittering hops. Drinkable, but not favorable. May have to try it again to make sure I didn't get a dud as I remember it having more pumpkin flavor. Definitely not enough pumpkin flavor for the style."
"Served in a pub pint glass at one of the local watering holes. Amber/orange in color, one finger head that didn't last too long. Smell is faint pumpkin/ginger, subtle. It tastes about how it smells, pumpkin, ginger and malt, but nothing overpowering. Smooth, average mouthfeel, carbonation very minimal. Compared to years past, this year's version is much more drinkable. In the past, it was very sweet and one/two was enough for me. This year, as with a number of the Brewery's other beers, the beer seems to be toned down to appeal to a greater number of people, hence the increased drinkability. But """pumpkin pie in a bottle""" as I remembered it, no longer is the case."
"Mouthfeel is watery at best."
"Small head, horrible aroma with booziness. Apple juice with strong carbonation. Pumpkin and cloves in taste, the nutmeg and the cinammon, brown suger. Off-bitterness in finish. Light mouthfeel. A me-too pumpkin. Didn't work for drinking, perhaps for cooking."
"This beer is easy to drink, but I would prefer other beers based on taste. I think this beer makes a better spiced beer than a pumpkin beer."
"Newer, updated, better-looking label for the 2006 season. This really seems to be an average pumpkin ale. Faint notes of pumpkin are slightly noticeable in the aroma and flavor, but mostly masked by the characteristics of nutmeg and cinnamon and other fall spices. Worth a try if your big on this style of beer."
"The carbonation is brisk and that helps overcome a slightly thin mouth. Not a bad effort at all, if they could ramp up the spices a notch and make the mouth a bit fuller, this would be a top of the line offering!"
"Yellow orange body with a white head - not much retention. Left some lacing on the sides. A very light pumpkin aroma mixed with some spice. Taste was about the same as the smell, nothing very strong and it's what you'd expect from a pumpkin ale. There is a seltzer-like finish and it's not sweet either. Some decent carbonation gives it a spritzy mouthfeel. Not a bad beer, just not a great one. Pretty average."
"Pale orange to light copper with a small, off-white head. Pumpkin spice, sweetish malt/dough, nutmeg. Taste starts with doughy sweetness and pumpkin flavoring. Caramel notes, with baking spices and nutmeg. Finish is mildly bitter with lingering spice. Pumpkin sure enough. One bottle is enough for me!"
"This ale poured a soft orange color with an average (but short lived) creamy white head and little lace. A bit on the cloudy side and the carbonation was moderate. A nutmeg smell is evident but not over powering. The taste was lightly malty with a soft but noticeably light and clean finish. Because Im drinking pumpkin ale, I would appreciate a little more emphasis on the pumpkin spice. Overall, a nice seasonal beer; but, missing that little extra that I expect from seasonal brew to put it over the top."
"D: Would be easy to drink a few of these as it hides the alchol well, if it weren't for the burnt toast aftertaste."
"Orangeish amber in color, little head that was mainly a ring. Spicy aroma, like spice cake or pumpkin pie, go figure. The flavor was much of the same, Thanksgiving dessert flavors. The pumpkin is not over whelming, so that keeps it pretty drinkable. Kind of a sparkling mouthfeel almost. Not bad, but definitly a novelty beer."
"Sampled at From The Vine beer tasting Sep 22nd, 2006: Dark orange/copper color with a medium eggshell white head and minimal lacing. Aroma of pumpkin pie. Medium body with a good amount of pumpkin flavor, along with some caramel malt. The finish is short and lightly spiced. Slightly above average all around."
"Similar to many other Pumpkin Ales in that they are lightly malted Pale Ales with added spiciness. Pumpkin, nutmeg, clove, cinamon, and all-spice added for complexity and richness. However, the malts and spices keep the beer a bit thin. Turns out more tea-like than beer-like. Herbal and spicy, but lackluster otherwise. Moderately clean and fresh in the finish, but never rises above the herbal qualities."
"Poured into a pint glass, this beer is a light amber in color, but cloudy. Visual carbonation appears moderate, but head development was very thin (yes, it was a correct pour). The aroma is very lightly hopped with hints of citrus. Also present are the requisite nutmeg and cinnamon, but to a lesser extent than I would expect for a beer of this style. Taste is good with a mild pumpkin flavor and hints of spice and nutmeg. Tart, but not sour. Mouthfeel is lightly carbonated and slightly dry. Overall, this is a good beer, but I expected the pumpkin flavor to be more robust."
"I was a bit disappointed in the mouthfeel of this beer. I was expecting something with a bit of a thicker body. The body of this beer is medium bodied. It finishes dry and goes down easy. All in all this is a pretty good beer, but I do believe that there are better examples of this style out there. I will probably buy this beer again, however it will probably be this season as I will be trying to get my hands on as many pumpkin ales as possible."
"Overall, a beer that does a good job showcasing the pumpkin."
"Overall- I was hoping for a big flavorful Pumpkin Ale but this was weak. Not very impressed but it was drinkable."
"Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a gold/orange color, with not much of a head at all. It smells mostly like spices (nutmeg) with a sweet smell. There's a little aroma of pumpkin and cinnamon, but it's not as strong as the nutmeg is. It tastes like nutmeg, pumpkin, cinnamon and cloves, but there's also a noticable hoppiness to the taste. It's pretty well balanced. It's medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation (but not too much). It goes down smooth, the drinkability is pretty good. Overall it's a pretty decent beer."
"D - If it was on tap, and it was a nice fall night. I would definitly buy it. Not too shabby but nothing to go hunting down."
"Bought it at Sam's in Chicago."
"Bought at Sam's Marcey St for 8.49/6 pack of 12oz bottles on 9/19/06"
"A bit thin bodied, but quite drinkable, one of my favorite pumpkin ales."
"Pours a light, clear, and golden amber hue. Bubbles are almost nonexistant. Same goes for lacing. Looks more like a crappy lager than an ale.The aroma is of adjuncty pumpkin pie spices. With lots of water and a little malt. The taste starts with an almost astringent start of crappy nutmeg. Then becomes crappy cinnamon. More like pumpkin spice mix tossed into the fermenter."
"This golden hued pumpkin ale pours with a bright white head and smells of fresh pumpkin -- very """squashy""" -- not as spicy in the aroma as some other pumpking beers I've sampled. The fresh pumpking flavor is refreshing and plays well with the simple, crisp malt flavors. The mouthfeel is smooth and the body somwhat light. The finish is very cris and pretty dry. Overall, a very """crisp""" beer; much like the cool, clean air on an autumn day. A very easy drinker. An excellent alternative to drinking an Octoberfest/Marzen is to have an Ichabod."
"Dits good, but 1 is enough at a timelike a piece of pie, you can have one after another of these."
"Drinkability: Nice seasonal beer. I think I am going to try some of this with Thanksgiving dinner. Interesting enough to maybe tempt some non-beer drinkers to try."
"Very clear orangey gold color, flat and small head that settles out as a skim on the top of the glass after 40 seconds. Decent lace, dripping rings. Malty aroma, fairly rich with a nutmeg dominance. Smooth mouthfeel, medium body. A few people have told me that this beer drinks like an Oktoberfest, however, its pretty marked by pie spice, possibly showing more pumpkin richness in resembling the pie filling as much by simply showcasing the spices used in the filling itself. Pretty easy-drinking if you like the expected set-up, a little bit of green leafy sharpness as the flavor profile rounds out. I'd say that this is a pretty good rendition, not overly laden with spice and with a fairly good drinkability to me."
"D- Easy, very aprochable overall seems balenced but weak."
"First pumpkin ale of the season. Clear gold body, creamy white head, 3/4""". Nutmeg, cinnamon,then the pumpkin. A very nice, rich pumpkin ale, strong spiciness of hop, along with the other spices. The pumpkin is evident, and interesting. Pumpkin ales are somewhat of a challenge to find a really good one, but this may be the best I have had. Combines the boldness of a substantially hopped PA with the seasonably appropriate pumpkin pie spices. Bring a 6 to Thanksgiving, and it would pair wonderfully."
"Ol Ichabod was drinkable and tasty  but it was more along the lines of an Oktoberfest than pumpkin."
"Medium bodied with good carbonation. Very refreshing."
"I'm not a beer lover per se, I'm just in it for the reviews. Seriously. Tasting is merely an ingredient in formulating my own perfect idea of a beer to brew. One of these ideas involves pumpkin beer. Of the two kinds I imagine one is a dark animal with light pumpkin pudding mutton chops and a whipped cream chin strap. The other is a transparent ale with overwrought punky pollutants. Not overly spicy like Buffalo Bill's and not quite as faint as our dear comrade Ichabod. He has a head the size of the Sears Tower and bubbles as if just born. Viddy viddy smoof wif a specklin' da de punkie. It's a pumpkin with a full set of teeth and glowing eyes and a cumberbund. I want mine to have a derelict smile with a few fangs knocked out and the others rotting from over-indulgence in the candy goblin's bag and eyes maddened with malty sucroses. A notch above Blue Moon but a kerbobble below my future jack o' lantern bier."
"Pours a dull golden orange with definite chill haze. 1/2 inch foamy white head with good retention and spotty lacing. Ginger and allspice nose with some faint pale malt but no detectable pumpkin. Gingerbread and allspice very apparent in the taste with a pale malt foundation- and mabye a hint of pumpkin. The aftertaste is dry with a mild herbal hop bitterness that balances the malt well while the spices are overkill, but fade quickly enough. Medium in body and carbonation but still seemed a bit on the fizzy side. The fall spice character was nice but becomes annoying near the finish; and the real question for the brewers at New Holland is...where's the pumpkin?"
"Been kept cold for a long time, so it shouldn't have suffered from the little age it has on it. Pours a golden color with a small head that is sparse after settling. Nose is pretty nice. I get a good bit of pumpkin, with a buttery caramel in there with nice nutmeg to balance out. Flavor is okay. Mostly pumpkin and nutmeg. Nothing is too strong or offensive. Good for the style. There is a slight astringency on the finish, but its not that bad. Feel is moderate with a light carbonation. I'd expect a touch more bubble. Overall, a nice representation of the style. I want more carbonation and to eliminate the astringent finish, but for a pumpkin beer, its okay."
"I am working on the last few of the this case that I bought to kick off the holiday imbibing season. I look forward to this one next year. Great stuff."
"Should be pretty easy to find this beer, I got it at my local grocery store. reasonably priced"
"The beer pours a nice golden color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a pleasant pale malt and pumpkin scent along with spices. It's dry with a slight cinnnamon/nutmeg aroma. The taste is good also. It has a smooth pale and carapils malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes with a smooth pumpkin/spice taste. It also has a mild hop flavor as well. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a solid fall seasonal. It has excellent flavor and aroma; a good drinker."
"Ichabod is not the best pumpkin ale I've had, but it is a pretty good one."
"Not a tremendously complex beer, but unique and enjoyable. Recommended."
"Fuzzy medium peach with little foam and a soda bubble ring. Nose has faint spices...maybe nutmeg, some oh-so-faint hints of pumpkin, maybe it was the power of suggestion from the label. Taste is nutmeg laced water with some other seasonal spices, but not very powerful. Mouthfeel is watery. The finish is carbonic acidic that wants to be dry and cannot make it. Not very drinkable for a pumpkin ale. A disappointment."
"Light aromas of nutmeg & cinnamon. Gentle flavours of alspice, nutmeg & cinnamon. More spice than anything else, and the spice just isn't all that impressive. Light side of medium bodied, gentle carbonation."
"Nice seasonal offering by New Holland Brewing. My first pumpkin ale and I like it."
"Way to much diaceyl, but otherwise a good brew that I will likely drink again, even if it is just to remind myself what diacetyl tastes like."
"D-This beer has a very good balance of spices and has some good malt to play a supporting role. It would be nice to see some more malt or hops or alcohol help balance the spices perhaps. The finish is a little too chalky or dry."
"Overall a very good pumpkin ale. I happened to enjoy the sweetness that doesn't get the chance to become cloying due to the nicely placed chalky-dry finish. Sweet, dry and pumpkiny with just enough spice makes this an ale to seek-out this time of year."
"Very subtle hop finish with no lingering bitterness."
"The color of this beer is a bright orange, very hazy, topped with a thin white head that left little lace on the side of the glass. The aroma is dominated by pumpkin, cinnamon, and perhaps a little nutmeg. The taste has all of those as you would expect, plus a light, yet satisfying malt back. The sweetness of the malt does balance the remainder of the flavor well. I like this beer, but Id really like a pumpkin beer with a base that has more flavor and body (Smutty and DFH do a nice job). The mouth feel is a little thin, but id does have a nice drinakbility"
"12 ounce bottle. This beer has a slightly hazy brownish yellow color. The aroma is very strong, with lots of pumpkin pie spice (ginger and nutmeg) and not enough pumpkin. Malty flavor with spices and a little pumpkin. The flavor is actually pretty nice. The spice doesn't totally dominate the beer. More nutmeg, cinnamon, and ginger. Mouthfeel is a little light. Nice drinkability for a beer with this much spice. This was a pretty good first pumpkin beer of the season."
"Ichabod pours a cloudy, very light golden color, with no head (ha fucking ha). The label says, """We take the soul of a Michigan fall and blend it into a beer;""" if that's the case, then diacetyl must be a strong Michigan tradition, because Ichabod tastes like buttered popcorn kernels. There's also a little bit of hop bitterness, and it finishes with some toastiness. It doesn't taste BAD--I actually like it--just a little odd. Up there in the Buttery Beer Hall of Fame with Harbor City Main Street Brown. Despite actually liking the flavor, one is easily enough for me."
"New Holland has got a winner here. Poured out to a solid bright and light orange color with a short lived head. No lace. Aromas of pumpkin, cooked veggies with a touch of sweetness. The smell was rather light but still inviting. Taste was smooth, rich and complex enough to make this a good beer but simple enough for the casual beer drinker. Flavors of mild hops, malt, pumpkin, light sugar, and some mild spices. Very nice. Mouthfeel was well balanced, not too heavy and not too light, similar to the weather during the fall season. This is a very drinkable beer, as I am now glad I got more than one. If you're gonna have only one pumpkin ale this year, this should be it. Highly recommended."
"First time trying this particular beer as I like the Pumpkin and have never tried this one. After first taste was surprised at Cinnamon taste being a little more dominant than Pumpkin. Very light tasting and watery in mouth. This has a nice smell but was hoping for a little more in the pumpkin flavor. This is not a bad beer but not what I was hoping for."
"Sell was odd. It smelled like a coffee beverage. Like dark roasted coffee, and pumphin was faint, so it was indeed sub-par in the scent category for pumpkin ales but smelled very hoppy and coffee like. It did look the part and was closer to pumpkin orange and dark yellow. I sniffed it again and I'm amazed at how much this smells like a deep roasted coffee! Mouth was average , as any other. This was a different taste for sure. It was more cinnamon than pumpkin but there was a faint pumpkin taste and well, a good ale is masked by the cinnamon. Not really pumpkin tasting. I want to rate this higher, because I could drink a few of these as it wasn't bad and was unusual if plesant tasting, but just not good enough for a pumpkin ale, maybe just a good """octoberfest"""."
"Overall, this beer is a letdown... I love pumpkin beers but this one just doesnt do it for me. Its just too thin and light"
"The drinkability falls short of good, simply because it is essentially punkin pie in a bottle. I have never sat down and ate a whole punkin pie, and similarly I would never drink a whole punkin pie (or six bottles of punkin pie if you catch my drift :). All things considered, this is surprisingly unique and tasteful. I am a fan."
"at first i would have criticised this beer for being one dimensional, but its assets creep out of the dark"
"All in all fairly nice, but definatly something a mood thing. Could use a bit less on the spice and more on the pumpkin though if you ask me."
"I think I did notice something on the bottle that might explain things. It says """Ale brewed with Spices""". I could swear that it used to say """Ale brewed with Pumpkin""". Perhaps they took out the pumpkin??"
"A surprising golden orange color - I expected something of a deeper copper colored brew. The aroma is very fruity in addition to the spices - a lot of apricot and peach in the nose in addition to the pumpkin and nutmeg. Flavor could use to be a bit more robust; typical cinnamon and spice in the flavor, but it's lacking. A very mild hop bite in the finish, not enough to back up the other mild flavors going on here. Creamy mouthfeel. An OK pumpkin, but I've had better. Somewhat lackluster for New Holland, methinks."
"Thank you to trbeer for the bottle....I suppose we tortured him with a pumpkin ale on our recent trip (Post Road), so he had to return the favor ;). Needless to say, pumpkin ale is not a style I particularly admire, and this is no exception. Still, I definitely admire New Holland a hell of a lot, and I can't wait till they make it into the Pittsburgh market (they're on the verge as I write this); I just wouldn't seek this one out when they have so many far superior beers."
"Overall, not bad, but I don't think I'll order this one again anytime soon. Maybe not anytime."
"I had this ale out of the bottle and it poured with a decent head that laced nicely down the side of the glass. The aroma was a nice delicate fall spice experience that the taste failed to follow-up on entirely. It tasted as if they must have used their pale ale as the base for this one and I look forward to trying that as well. I only had one on hand and was drinking while distributing candy to the neigbor kids halloween night so didn't really want to fully test it's drinkability anyway. But I found it to be a good Pumpkin Ale that I will definitely look for again next year."
"I haven't seen too much New Holland here in Indiana. The last month or so. we started getting some in. Anyways, the pour pours a semi-flat burnt amber color with a miniscule white head that quickly fades. Aroma is of malt and spice. Not an overly sweet aroma but there are some nods towards sweetness. I initially got a """winter warmer""" type taste from this one, but as it warms it comes into its own. Stronger pumkin notes start coming through, along with some clove. Very easy to drink. A solid fall brew. Get me some more New Holland."
"Drinkability - a great pumpkin ale, deserving of its following. I feel lucky to have scored the last sixer from Mitch at my local Shop Kwik. Thanks, Mitch!"
"Ichabod is not my Holy Grail of pumpkin ales. It is, however, a solid-across-the-board seasonal beer that aficionados of the style should enjoy. It may not be New Holland's best, but it is a more worthy member of their lineup."
"12 oz. bottle, no freshness or best by date. Slightly hazy golden liquid, with a touch of an orange tint. White foamy head, which stayed for a few minutes leaving a little bit of lace. Smells of some pumpkin pie spices, cinnamon, nutmeg. None of the smells were terribly overpowering, mostly faint. Pale malt flavor, kind of a funky taste with some bitterness, but maybe not hop related. Light body, highly carbonated, slightly fizzy. Overall, seems kind of messy, bitter which doesn't seem to fit pumpkin ales. Not the worst out there, but I don't think I would search this one out again."
"Smooth and creamy in a medium body and good carbonation. Easy drinking with nice flavor."
"Overall/Drinkability: Easy, yet not very enjoyable to drink. I've heard good things about New Holland, but I fear we've gotten off to a bad start."
"Pours a medium amber with a one finger head and pretty good lace. Smell of cinnamon and orange with some ginger and slight alcohol overtones. I don't smell much pumpkin though. Initial hop bitterness, followed by orange and cinnamon. A bit watery for a pumpkin ale, but decent though. Finishes a bit dry and leaves a nice hop bitterness on the sides of your tongue. I could drink a couple of these in one sitting but not much more than that. It's better to get a six, stick it in the fridge, and have one on a Sunday afternoon while watching some football. Not a great beer, but it is a nice one to drink this time of year. Grab some just to give it a try."
"The flavor is not potent but more sublte. It has a cinnamon taste but more of an earthy cinnamon than a sweet cinnamon. It is a bark quality to it too. The subtle flavor makes the beer seem a bit weak on flavor. It has more of an alcohol taste than a pumpkin taste."
"Hazy golden color...creamy white head..nose is big on cinnamon and ginger...not much in the way of pumpkin....body is on the lighter side of medium...not real substantial...taste is mild... cinnamon again...seems almost watery at the end...the spicining is nice but it just seems to be lacking in pumpkin and also depth and body...average.."
"My first impression of this beer was its suprisingly light color. It wasn't as light as a Bud Light, but for a pumpkin ale, it was pretty weak. The aroma was nice and pure with a true pumpkin spice smell filled with heavy nutmeg and cinnamon. The taste was ok, but it finished way too dry for me to enjoy it. The spices came quick from the start but in the end I was just left with a wierd mouthfeel. I would not go as far as saying this is a bad beer, but there are definately some better pumpkins out this season."
"Pale golden tone that shows no carbonation. LIght colored for a pumpkin beer. Thin off white head recedes to a rimming in no time. Lacing is negligible. Sweet and spicy aroma. Honey and orange and cinnamon, nutmeg...a dash of ginger. Not bad. Get the orange/honey thing on the palate as well. Some pumpkin if you look real hard, but barely detectable. A lot of cinnamon on the buds as well. Spicy. Body is medium at best. Everything is pretty average with this pumpkin brew."
"New Holland continues to underwhelm me..."
"Amber in color-sort of leans towards orange. OK head. Spices in the aroma.Some malt. Ok flavor-theres a slight maltiness and the spices come thru but both are hidden behind a slight metallic flavor that lasts the whole way down. Body is suited to the style. A decent enough beer. Id say to definately try it if your looking to find a better pumpkin beer. Perhaps I got an off sample-lose the slight harshness I think it could be a better,more enjoyable beer."
"This pours a decent looking beer with an O.K. looking head. It's color is a sort of a hazy golden. It doesn't look like I had imagined it would. The aroma didn't really smell like I would have expected it to as well. Pretty week on the spicey aroma. I could pick up on a little bit of ginger which isn't really the main spice you would want to emphasize in a pumpkin ale. The first sip of this beer is spiciest taste you will experience while drinking this beer. This is because that the spices are so mild that after the first drink or two your taste buds just kind of ignore or forget about them. Could definately use a little more spice. The mouthfeel is good. Nice amount of carbonation. It's an average beer. It's drinkable but I could think of many other beers I would rather be drinking."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: Thin, highly carbonated. Nowhere near as malty as it ought to have been. Not viscous enough, not balanced. Drinkable? Its as drinkable as Natural Light. Meaning, easy to drink and somewhat difficult to enjoy."
"I just can't help smiling when I drink this beer."
"From the bottle a dark orange in color with a good toasted bread colored head. Spicey aroma with notes of pine. Flavor is of subdued malt sweetness and assertive pumpkin pie spice. I admit I am a pumpkin beer fan, but I think most would find this enjoyable."
"I like this beer, and this is not my normal orderly review but this is not a normal orderly beer. It is great for the style. Very spicy, nutmeg, pumpkin scent. Sweet malt, spice taste with a dry hop, ginger, pepper finish. The pepper finish stays for a while. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with heavy carbination. I could drink a bunch of these. What a nice beer. I will buy these whenever they are available."
"Drinkability and overall: Pretty light, quaffable brew. To quote Bono, """I still haven't found what I'm looking for""". To me, this beer did NOT come as advertised. There is a lot of hype around here about New Holland Brewing. This beer did not live up to the hype. I wouldn't even consider this a good fall brew. Your time would be better served elsewhere."
"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a hazy medium orange color with three fingers of head. There is lots of lacing left on the glass. The smell is fairly spicy, but not too strong. Little hints of pumpkin and cinnamon aromas. The taste did not really live up to my expectations. It's fairly bland at first, not much maltiness or spice coming through. It has a very metallic finish to it. Rather odd. The mouthfeel isn't too bad, but the drinkability suffers due to the taste. It's not as bad as it could be, and I'd give it another shot someday."
"This was a mixture of high's and low's for me. The appearamce was the strong point, with it's nice orangey/amber color and the off white fluffy head. After that, it went down the preverbial crapper. Just the thought of the taste and smell makes me cringe in horror. The smell was of old stinky feet and rancid puke. Seriously. I could find a little hint of some all spice in there, but it was then quickly bludgened to death by the horrid smell. The taste was quite similar, but the stinky crap was still there. If you drank it while you held your nose, it wasn't so bad, but I don't want to do that when I drink beer. I drink beer to taste and smell everything it has to offer, so I can fully enjoy it. The mouthfell was a little creamy, but still had the sting of carbonation. Again, this is some nasty stuff. I couldn't finish it, maybe it was a bad bottle, but it was horrid."
"I prefer the real deal. Mediocre."
"Hazy orange color with a nice creamy off white head that leaves a nice lacing. Aroma of butter and mild pumpkin pie spices, a bit sweeter than I expected, light pumpkin pie flavors, but not over done, nice balanced, good spicy aftertaste, medium bodied with a slightly watery mouthfeel, one of the better pumpkin beers around."

"Drinkabilty: This beer needs more pumpkin flavor to be considered to the style, IMO."
"Overall, an average pumpkin ale. I wouldn't drink more than one of these of these in a row, as the spices are quite palate-fatiguing."
"I'll be the first to admit that I'm not a pumpkin beer fan. But even objectively, this is miles from special."
"As far as pumpkin beers go, this isn't half bad. Definitely something you have to be in the mood for (which I was). Not sure if I could drink this on a regular basis, but Ichabod is pretty good for a Autumn offering."
"Thanks goes to my neighbor who travels to Michigan every now and then to visit family and just happens to think of me when at the liquor stores. Thanks Rebecca!"
"This beer poured an amber, almost pumpkin-like color. The body was cloudy and the head was lacking. This really does taste like autumn in a glass. Pumpkin flavor is there and the spices, which are cinnamon and nutmeg, mix well with the pumpkin flavor. The flavor isn't too strong and this still tastes like a beer. Great job blending the flavors together by New Holland."
"Originally sampled on 11 January 2003. I am writing this review from my notes. This one surprised me. I had another brewer"""s pumpkin beer a few years back and hated it. However, Ichabod is very nicely done. The pumpkin is well balanced w/ the malt & hops. It"""s a hazy amber color w/ a huge, long lasting head."
"While Iam not a pumpkin pie fan,I haved enjoyed alot of the pumpkin ales I have had,I really enjoyed cottonwoods pumpkin ale down in NC.This one however fell a little flat,poured a nice deep orange color with pretty decent sized head,smell was not strong enough for me some hint of spices but not rich enough for me.Some spiceness and a very faint pumpkin taste just kinda left me wondering where the rest of it was.I'll be sure not to seek this out when Iam back in Michigan."
"Poured with no head at all.  Tasted of allspice and nutmeg.  Spices are more subtle than the Buffalo's Bill Pumpkin Ale I tasted.  Do I detect some hops cutting through?  I got this beer out of a kind of fascination similar to gawking at car accidents.  Sometimes pumpkin ale can be truly horrible.  This one doesn't seem to be one of the basket cases, it is quite drinkable. Still I wouldn't buy a case, one or two would satisfy the curious."
"Reddish orange. No head or lace. Smells like raw pumpkin, together with some of the stem and vine thrown in. Pale sweetness initiates a complex of green squash, pie crust and cumin flavors. A delicate if awkward balance overall. Finish is dry and absent of grit or metal."
"A pumpkin ale that is not overpowered, nor oversweetened by the pumpkin taste.  I actually tasted malt and hops along with a slight pumpkin taste that blended quite well in the mix.  Good stuff.  Some pumpkin ales are """overspiced""".  This one isn't."
