"Extremely impressed with this brew! Wasn't expecting much but i was definitely wrong. Has a perfect texture and blend of flavors with pumpkin and caramel tasting the boldest. This could be my new favorite pumpkin brew, and for a 22 at $5.49 i'll be stocking up on these."

"Very clear, dark pumpkin colored. Like a dusky fall orange. White head is thick with great retention and lacing. Clumps are sliding down the glass and sticking to the sides. Active carbonation is evident as the glass sits and with each swallow. Smell is a mix of biscuit malt and pumpkin meat. Toasted multigrain bread and light butterscotch. Pumpkin pie spice is showing along with a sweet alcohol note. Taste is sweet and alcoholic with a firm bitterness in the finish. Malted caramel sweetness in the front with a Maris Otter malt biscuit and toast flavor. Pumpkin pie sits on top of the caramel and tries to cover the alcohol but it just can't a as the flex is too bold. Firm bitterness rides in on the last of the booze and leaves an herbal and slightly minty finish. Slight metallic mineral edge along with other flavors give this an overall English character with an imperial pumpkin edge. Feel is slightly heavy with a light syrup consistency. Carbonation is smooth and very well done, making this sipper of an ale quite easy drinking. A solid imperial pumpkin that while a not a quaffer goes down easily. Temperature is very important with this one. The flavors develop and unify as it warms to English pub temp. Much better flavor cool than cold."

"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. It is an interesting tannic offering with enough pupokin flavor to keep you interested. I think this is a decent take on the style but a little too tannic and bitter to make me want to have it again."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Enjoyable but the alcohol is not as well hidden as in some other beers in the style - also, the cinnamon is a little too intense in this brew for my tastes (things seem just a touch out of balance between the pumpkin and spices)."

"Overall - A tasty pumpkin brew. It has a nice warming feel with a nice flavor profile. A good holiday brew to sit back with and sip during the fall season."
""
"O: I think this takes the cake as far as pumpkin beers go this year. If this were in a six-pack, I’d be buying it over Schlafly’s, even. To be honest, I think it’s the absence of spice intensity that makes this one the best; I mean, we all know pumpkin pie has those spices to it, but if I ever tasted a pie that was as super-spiced as some of these beers have been, I wouldn’t go back for a second bite. Once again, balance wins."

"O: I can't say I like this one.There are many better pumpkin beers to choose from, so the last couple of inches are headed down the drain."
""
""
""
""
"O - I like it and would but again. Given the almost $3 more to get my hands on a Pumking, I may make this one my choice pumpkin brew! Less intense sweetness by allocating the focus toward the spices. Good job Heavy Seas!"
"It seems that stronger malted ales are the prefered base type for better support of spice. The first 5-6 ounces were flavorful and bright, but the sweetness, starch, and strong cinnamon balance began to wear on me going into the second half of the glass."
"I know, I am throwing off the curve on this, but I really have to. This is simply one of the best pumpkin ales I have ever had and I LOVE pumpkin ales. At first pour it is as orange as orange gets and really does set you in the mood for the season. The aroma coming out of my glass a full two or three feet from my face was enough that I could smell it and was delighted by it. The taste is purely pumpkin and strong which is a nice change from the more weaker pumpkin flavored ales on the market. Ive been typing for a few minutes now and I can STILL taste it on my tongue. The mouthfeel was a bit more carbonated than I like, too much like soda, but still pleasant. Overall this is absolutely a must have for Pumpkin Ales and anyone who enjoys the style. Well done Clipper City Brewing!"
""
"Sweet and toasted malt right off the bat. Graham cracker crust and butterscotch/caramel malts are sweet and intense. Singed/toasted bitterness around the edges. Clove and nutmeg (?) come in strong in the latter half of the palate, upon the wave of sweet, pie-y malt. Cinnamon shows up in the finish, along with lingering spices, vegetal bitterness and leftover malt sweetness. Medium-full body with a slightly creamy feel. A big, intensely flavored pumpkin ale that comes in a notch below Pumking and Weyerbacher."
""
"Taking the alcohol into consideration, and by that I mean placing this in an """imperial pumpkin""" category, this one isnt too bad. The alcohol is hot and very noticeable. I wouldnt have this one again. Pumpking is still the king of Imperial Pumpkins."
"O: As the pumpkin style has gotten so popular, it's hard to differentiate and Heavy Seas lands in the middle of the pack with this. If you're looking for a bigger ABV pumkin ale and can't get Pumking, give it a shot."
"An inoffensive imperial pumpkin. It's not too spicy, it's not too sweet, it's not too vegetal. It's not very good either though. It's middling."
""
""
""
""
"O - not a bad pumpkin brew. I'd drink another one."
""
"A benchmark for what a pumpkin beer should be. True to the taste of the vegetable itself. Malty, yet with some mild citrus notes indicative of American hops. Rich and savory, yet drinkable. Even the fact that it's slightly warming. Highly recommended for the season."
""
""
""
""
"Maybe not the best pumpkin ale out there, but getting past the appearance, definitely enjoyable. I'd be curious to try one fresh."
"I was disappointed that this was only an average beer. I had high hopes, but it's too one dimensional. The alcohol was just too aggressive, I've had beers with double the ABV that were more balanced."

"Bomber bottle poured into tulip. Pours dark orange with medium head. All I can smell here is nutmeg. There is no sign of pumpkin, and the spice is offputting and unpleasant. Flavor follows with unbearable nutmeg that takes my breath away, no real pumpkin flavor, and nothing that says to me that this is a beer. The palate is thick and yet burns with the spices here. This was a drain pour and a half."
""
""
""
""

""

"O: right on the edge of giving it a 4.5"
""
""
"Overall, I definitely recommend the Heavy Seas Great Pumpkin. There is no bottling/freshness date on the bottle, so I'm wondering if a fresh bottle would make a difference. It's not the best pumpkin beer I've had, but I do like it very much. Maybe this would make a good introduction for craft beer drinkers that are new to pumpkin beer? You know, rather than give them the best right out of the gate, start them off with something a little more crowd friendly? But, at the same time, I'd hate to hand them something less flavorful, and give them a poor representation all-together."

"Bottle. Pours a orangy color with a slight white head. Like chunks? If so, this is the beer for you! Murky with little flecks of chunk floating around. Allspice, caramel, and pumpkin in the nose, actually not a bad aroma. Medium mouthfeel. Slightly sweet upfront. Pumpkin pie, slight cinnamon, allspice, and whip cream (just kidding). Overall, not bad. I am not the biggest pumpkin fan but this is tolerable for me. It does have a slight pepper note to it thought that I am not the biggest fan of."
""
""
"O: One of the better pumpkin ales I've had this season. It's balanced even with the high ABV."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This has good drinkability. It is a really nice tasting beer, and it has a nice smoothness to it. I wish there was a little more pumpkin flavor that stood out, but it is still really nice. Overall, I think this is a good higher alcohol pumpkin ale. I really enjoyed this one, and I definitely think it is worth checking out."
""
""
"Sadly, I wanted to like The Great Pumpkin more than I actually did. My girlfriend liked this one more than I though, so your mileage may vary."
"O: I'm a huge fan of the Greater Pumpkin and, though this doesn't equal it, the Great Pumpkin comes closer. It's a lighter, more accessible version even if it's still on the strong end of the pumpkin beer spectrum. Highly recommended; one of the best pumpkin ales out there. Will drink again. Paired with Thanksgiving pumpkin pie, a recommended pairing."
"O - Overall, a bit of a disappointment. I have yet to find something that rivals Pumking. It is a nice attempt at a more squash-based pumpkin ale instead of your typical spiced brown ale, but it does not impress me. The flatness and metallic taste in the finish ruin it for me."
""
"Poured from a bomber into a true pint, the beer is a light, bright, copper-tinted orange coloring with a thick, foamy, light, small bubbled, frothy, white head that stands a good, solid inch and a half. Aromas of smoke and roasted pumpkin on the nose, with a very light spicing and some wheat characteristics. Flavors are round and smooth, with a slightly sour tang on the tail end. The bulk of the flavor profile is a light, smooth pumpkin and spice balance, which is mostly cinnamon, and the overall flavor comes off like a batch of pumpkin cookies. The aftertaste is sugary sweet, but short-lived. The abruptness of the aftertaste keeps it from being overpowering or cloying. A candied finish, both quick and sweet. Tasty beer, and with all the sweet profile, it would make a tasty dessert beer."

"O - I don't know if I'll come back to this one eventually, I enjoy giving almost anything pumpkin flavored a whirl, but it is certainly worth a look if you enjoy the style."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I'll admit that I'm generally turned off by floaties...I know it's fine for them to be there, I've just never cared for them in my beer, at least aesthetically. Overall this is nice, nothing spectacular, but certainly worth a try."
"Big thanks goes out to my boy Lunch for sending me this one in a past trade! 2010 Vintage! Served from bottle into a Stone nonic. Poured orange with a half finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, pumpkin, brown sugar, and spices. The flavor was of sweet malt, pumpkin, alcohol, brown sugar, and spices. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. This was not overly complex which left me wishing and hoping for more. This was okay though as the flavors that were there were just right in intensity. I had this one right before the -bal aged version, so I was hopeful that this would help the base brew while I was having it. It did just for the record."
"O: A pretty decent pumpkin ale. I'd like a bit less alcohol presence, a creamier body, and more pumpkin flavors, but still it's not bad at all."
"O: A pretty good pumpkin ale. Not the best I've ever had, but better than the vast majority. The sweetness/spiciness/bitterness are all well balanced, and it's a pleasant fall beer. Worth a look for sure."
"Solid pumpkin ale with a more sweet vegetable flavor than most."
"O- I think the intensity of this beer gives it an acquired taste. it's a big beer that makes for good sipping. Take it slow with this one."
"Be warned; the alcohol content might grab you if you are not careful! Enjoy!"
"Medium bodied. with a creamy and soft texture. A little watery diminishes the finish but a pretty solid pumpkin ale. A little unique with a more hoppy finish than you would really expect in a pumpkin beer."
"O-Split a bomber, don't drink the whole thing like I did. you have to try it, cuz it has a cool label at least"
"Not a bad pumpkin ale, but not spectacular either. The bitterness that I'm getting seems out of place, and I don't remember it from the last time I had this beer, so maybe this is an off bottle."
"Overall: A good pumpkin beer. Good spice level. Good drinkability."
"Overall I thought this was an Ok Pumpkin Ale. I like my pumpkin ales to have a noticeable pumpkin flavor and not dominated by spices, and in this beer the spices were just too dominating and didn't let much pumpkin or malt flavor shine through. The heavy spices and slightly warming alcohol don't make this beer too drinkable, I am glad I am splitting this bomber with my brother or else this might be a chore to finish. What I liked most about this beer was the aroma, it seems to have ok balance in the aroma and it was similar to pumpkin pie. What I liked least about this beer was the flavor, there was just too much spices and too little malts and pumpkin. I don't think I would get this beer again when in need for a Pumpkin Ale, Screaming Pumpkin is cheaper, more balanced, and tastes better. If you love Pumpkin Ales you may want to give it a try but expect it to be spice forward. This wasn't a bad beer it just lacked the balance that I look for the most in this style, Screaming Pumpkin from the Michigan Brewing Company is still my favorite Pumpkin Ale, but I would still take this over Samuel Adams Harvest Pumpkin Ale and I would like to try The Greater Pumpkin if I see it around, maybe barrel aging is just what this beer needs. My least favorite beer from The Mutiny Fleet so far, but Peg Leg is still my least favorite beer from them."
"A spicy but delicious pumpkin beer. Wish there was just as much pumpkin on the tongue as there was on the nose but that may come out with more time. This one is a bit fresh. Cheap for a bomber and good, something I'd recommend for someone looking for more in this style of beer."
"Malty aroma has a firm overtone of pumpkin and cinnamon - very October indeed. It pours a slightly hazy coppery amber with a thin pale pumpkin-orange head, but the condition of the head may be an artifact of the pour. Lip-smacking malty flavor has firm tones of pumpkin and cinnamon with hints of cloves and fruit and a bit of an alcohol nip. Texture has above average body and is smooth with a subtle fizz, leaving an edgy, malty, pumpkin finish. Perfect for this time of year!"
"O - A pretty good pumpkin beer. Some noticeable alcohol, but not too much. Not sure I would get this (or most pumpkin beers) again, but I enjoyed it."
"O - Solid Pumpkin Ale, but not my favorite of the season."
"Solid orange/brownish/goldeny color with an off white head. Smells like freshly baked pumpkin pie. Huge whiff of molasses and brown sugar. Malty pumpkiny goodness here. Heavily spiced with a slight hop backbone. Sticky and medium bodied. Pumpkin flavor is very prevalent. Great example of a well crafted impy pumpkin ale. Tasty yet not overly cloying. Will look for this again every year."
"This is a pretty looking beer, nice hazy burnt orange with a sticky slimy frothy head, looks like a DIPA, sexy. Smells of light pumpkin taste, with a sweet apricot smell coming through. The taste has a smokey nutmeg taste, alcohol very present . Again light pumpkin, nice spice balance, clove. Medium bodied, creamy and smooth. Overall this beer is okay, i just find it hard with Pumking out there to ever justify buying this again."
"Trying out of my first imperial pumpkins from a local brewery. Pours a beautiful golden color (even my girlfriend thought so!) and smells or nutmeg and cinnamon. Taste is definitely very strong on the spices, maybe a bit too much. Never thought I'd say this but it could use more pumpkin flavoring, the spices kind of ruin the palette after a while. Pretty good beer, and totally hides the alcohol, but not for everyone."
"This has almost an abbey ale pumpkin feel to it. There a cotton-candy sweetness to it. There's a cloudy almost porter underpinning to this brew. There is clearly a nice brown sugar/pumpkin feel to it, but the sweetness of it almost feels like I'm going to get diabetes. Good beer, but can only have one and done."
"Pours a slightly hazy honey orange with a fizzy 1 inch orange-tan head that settles to a small cap. Random dots and streaks of lace drip back down into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, pumpkin puree, and pumpkin pie spices. Taste is of sweet malt, slight pumpkin flavors, and a variety of pumpkin pie spices but cinnamon seems to be in the forefront. A bitter spice aftertaste lingers on the tongue after each sip. This beer has a higher level of carbonation with a crisp and bubbly mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good pumpkin ale and one of the better ones I have tried this Fall season. I am glad I was able to get a bottle of this."
"O- It's kind of like they wanted to make a strong pumpkin beer but went too far with all of the special ingredients. My inability to derive at least a malt profile from this beer leaves me somewhat disappointed. Plus, there really aren't that many pumpkin notes detected other than in the nose. Another in a series of letdowns from Heavy Seas. I'm beginning to wonder if Loose Cannon and Dubbel Cannon are their only good beers..."
"O: The alcohol is well masked from the taste of this beer, which helps its drinkability. It’s not one of the greatest pumpkin beers out there, but is a good offering."
"Overall – A solid imperial pumpkin beer. Would choose this over Pumking hands down."
"Overall - A pretty good pumpkin ale. If they just would tone down the cinnamon a hair it would really knock this up a notch. Just a little heavy on the spice."
"I really like this offering from Heavy Seas. I purchased a few bottles of this and their Great'er pumpkin not really knowing what to expect. This was a nice orangeish color when poured into a glass and had a very nice smell. The ale went down very smooth with spice and pumpkin taste being relevant. I'm anxious now to try the Great'er version of this as I would imagine it only gets better!"
"Overall: This might be my new favorite pumpkin beer, balance, and most importantly does not use pumpkin spices to fool you into thinking there is pumpkin flavor."
"I admit, I didn't finish all 11oz of my share because it does tend to sit a little bit heavier on the stomach/palate. I would definitely drink this again if I wanted a hearty spiced pumpkin ale for fall! I'm hoisting my glass and giving an affirmative ArRRR to Heavy Seas."
"Medium in texture with light carbonation, the feel is pretty enjoyable, and unlike some, it isn't too big for the flavor...or for any extended drinking experience. One of Clipper City's finer offerings, in my opinion."
"For an imperial pumpkin this is pretty good; I still rather have a non-imperial version any day though."
"O-My first experience with Heavy Seas or Clipper City, and it was really good one of the beer beers at the tasting."
"Not a bad beer, but the booziness kills it for me. Still very much looking forward to trying The Greater Pumpkin, however."
"Heavy seas is doing there job on this one.. Cant wait to Crack that bottle of Greater pumpkin.. Cheers"
"O: 4"
"22 ounce bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a hazy orange/amber color with a half inch off-white head. Both head retention and lacing are decent. Aroma is spicy, it smells like pumpkin pie spices and some pumpkin. The taste is mostly like the aroma, the pumpkin pie spice flavors are dominant, but there is some pumpkin and a bit of booze noticeable. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a little slick and has moderate/high carbonation. I think it's a decent enough pumpkin beer, but it's not one of my favorites. With that being said, I wouldn't turn one down. At just $5.99 a bomber, it's worth trying."
"Pours from a 22oz. bomber bottle a medium amber/orange color with a small head that quickly dissolved into a light lacing. The aroma is malty and slightly sweet, with hints of pumpkin pie spices and maybe just a hint of Alcohol. 1st sip brings a taste of pumpkin, malt, and spices. There is a strong bitterness on the finish from a combination of hops, alcohol & spice. The mouth feel is smooth and Medium Body. I notice some Pumpkin Ales choose to have the Pumpkin Taste as the Main Flavor, While others have it as the """Spice""". I prefer the spice, and this one is somewhere in the middle. A Decent one, but not in the top 5."
"It's better than most of the pumpkin fare out there. Definitely more pumpkin forward than most of the others. Doesn't compare to weyerbacher or southern tier though..."
"Overall I would judge this beer as medium bodied and a good representative of this beer category, but I am just not a lover of this style. so maybe not the best judge."
"Pours a nice amber/orange color w/ a nice one finger cocoa head. Average carbonation and lacing for this brew. Nice orange highlights when held up to the light. Nose is mainly cinnamon w/ some nutmeg and pumpkin. Not as complex as Weyerbacher, and this beer is definitely in the same vein. Taste is fortunately better than the nose. Big malt background on this beer, and that saves it for me. Not over the top, just about right. Feel isn't complex enough for me, and a little thin. Overall, this beer wants to be Weyerbacher Imperial Pumpkin, but isn't quite there. Still, a decent brew if you like Pumpkin Ales. Cheers."
"O - Gotta say I'm disappointed, considering the style. At times, it feels heavy-handed, but moreso it just feels unartfully made. I've had much worse, but in this day of a million pumpkin beers, this is worth a one-time try and nothing more."
"O: A solid pumpkin beer, but needs a bit more hops or spice or something to give it a little oomph."
"Not a pumpkin I'd like to try again."
"Standard red copper in the glass with a thin head and a bit of lace, quite clear. The smell is dominated by spice with the typical cinnamon, all spice and nutmeg with a bit of hop and a touch of malt in there as well. Overall the smell is nice it is clear that this is a pumpkin ale. To me the spicing seems a bit overdone in the taste. Maybe it's just due to the fact that this is my first pumpkin beer of the season and I'm not used to these flavors yet but this one seems a bit over the top especially on the first sip. So the spicing dominates yet beyond that is a good balance of crystal malt and enough bitterness to almost rein in the spice. As it warms the spice fades a bit. I do have to give credit where it's due in that this beer doesn't come off as overly sweet and may appeal to those who like an assertively spiced beer. The mouthfeel is good but to me again a bit too much spice makes it feel overly busy and the finish is like a spoonful of pumpkin pie spices. Overall it's good and will definitely find favor with people who like a strong example of the style but falls short of my favorites in the style."
"O-great pumpkin beer that isn't just packed full of sweet pumpkin, but instead has great body and flavor."
"O- Very enjoyable pumpkin beer. I have not had a lot of pumpkin beers but this is a pretty good one. Might grab a couple bottles for October."
"This is a borderline excellent beer. With some tweaking of the spice ratios, and perhaps some modification of the pumpkin (to better create the illusion that cooked pumpkin does not taste just like squash), this would be fantastic. I will probably try it again in 2011."
"22oz 2010 bottle consumed on 3.27.11. Into a tulip glass this reveals a semi clear orange/amber color under a thin head. Aroma carries a medium to heavy nose blend of cinnamon, brown sugar, nutmeg and possibly, pumpkin. The general mouthfeel here is a BIG Spicy one with an emphasis on the cinnamon, burnt sugar, and pumpkin spice. At first sips, the taste walks the line of being just a bit too """Fall spiced," but then it soon makes friends with my palate as the drink goes on. A Mutiny truly does take place and there's a good malt balance for smooth sailing on a big pumpkin sea. You could call this """Pumpkin Ale on steroids""" or you could call it """Imperial", which it truly is...Pumpkin Ale lovers who just can't get enough flavor should try this... Perhaps Ill crack open a bottle of this at next year's Thanksgiving dessert table..."
"22 ounce bottle. Pours slightly hazy orange color with a foamy 2 finger white head with average retention that reduces to a very thin cap. Aromas of pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, and brown sugar. Taste of cinnamon, nutmeg, brown sugar, and some clove; with the pumpkin flavors in the background with some pie crust noticed. The finish is fairly dry, but there is some lingering notes of sweetness, with some spices. No bitterness noticed, but it fits this style perfectly. Alcohol was very well hidden, only a very small warming after the finish noticed. Quite drinkable because of the good flavor, and very smooth going down. Medium carbonation and body. I was actually letting this sit in the fridge for a while, afraid to try it, because I didn't know what to expect. Most pumpkin beers can be done very badly, but this one is done very well, and I would definitely have it again. Delicious."
"The allspice, cinnamon, and nutmeg dominate this and the pumpkin is lost. Its a nice dark copper color with descent head and lacing, the smell is amazing and the taste is very good. However, the spices overpower the malts and the pumpkin. Slightly overcarbonated, a bit creamy. Hard to drink past the spice. A bit cloying and sweet, but not syrupy. Good beer, but Dogfish Head has a better balanced version."
"Poured into snifter on 10/03. This beer accompanied a thanksgiving style dinner and was well recieved. This pumpkin ale pours orange topped with a thin white head. It smelles of pumpkin and pumpkin spices (nutmeg, cinnamon, etc) mixed with some dark fruit notes. The taste follows suit but adds some caramel and vanilla to the party. Medium body and low to medium carbonation work nice together for this one. I found it very tasty for this time of year (fall) and would purchase another bottle or 2 next year."
"Poured a medium amber-orange with a large white creamy head that was mostly diminishing and had good lacing. The aroma hits you right of the bat with the scent of cinnamon, nutmeg, brown sugar and pumpkin with notes of a cookie malt and a sweet doughy yeast. It tastes mildly sweet with strong notes of nutmeg and cinnamon right off, then became more of an almost Pumpkin pie flavor with a mild alcohol tinge near the end. Mouthfeel was light to medium in body and creamy in texture with a lively carbonation. Overall one of the best pumpkin ale's I have tasted to date."
"D: definitely a solid tasty pumpkin ale that drank really good and is probably in the top five of my favorite pumpkin brews."
"D: I think I preferred the bourbon barrel one, but this wasn't bad either."
"Poured from bomber into dimpled glass. Amber pour with a small white head that doesn't last too long. Mellow pumpkin with cinnamon, nutmeg, and a touch of cloves--all the requisite pumpkin pie spices. Sweet malt beneath it all. Smooth taste, with the pumpkin subtle in the background, sweet, spicy malt, and a bit of bitterness on the finish. Not sure if that's the hops or a bit of boozy heat. Solid, and not too heavy on the pumpkin. My top pumpkin beer to date. I'd like to try the Great'er Pumpkin someday however."
"D: Strong spices and pretty apparent alcohol really hurt the drinkability."
"D - Easy to drink, easy to enjoy!"
"The Great Pumpkin is definitely good pumpkin beer but, with all do respect, its name might be just a little self-aggrandizing. To be sure, there are both better and worse examples on the market but in the grand scheme of things Heavy Seas' offering should be considered one of the more enjoyable, easily drinkable specimens of this often polarizing style."
"Not much of a head on this one, maybe half a finger. Little lace, and very little cling. Cloudy orange coloring, close to an 11 on the SRM beer color chart. Smells of nutmeg, vanilla, cinnamon, and of course pumpkin. Flavors I detect are pumpkin, fugi apple, nutmeg, vanilla, cinnamon, orange peel, and malt. Good feeling in my mouth, very full and creamy. Usually I would drink this in October/November, but would also try it as a desert beer."
"Little heavy beer for my tastes, had via 22oz bottle. Less Pumpkin dominate taste than other pumpkin beers. More spicy than """pumpkiny""". Worth a try around halloween if you enjoy spiced/pumpkin type beers. Cetainly not bad for a try...give it a shot in a 22oz bottle or draft before going for a six-pack or case."
"D - Man did I like this more than the BA version! But overall it just seems to big for a pumpkin ale. I know the bottle I had was a little old but it seems kind of low on the spice department but delivers the right amount of hops punch to complete the brew. I don't know if I will buy it again but overall a decent pumpkin beer with mild spices and no too hoppy. One step below Pumking."
"D- The great pumpkin may be the best pumpkin beer out there. I am sorry but I will seek this brew every single Fall season from here on out. Great job heavy seas... this can be SLAMMED!"
"D: Good Imperial Pumpkin Ale with the typical spices and pumpkin flavor. Alcohol is not apparent at any point. I prefer the Barrel Aged version but this is still a good example of the style."
"Pours pumpkin orange and boy is it a doozy. taste of pumpkin pie ever increasing each sip you drink, Has a thin white cool whip colored head. Smells alot like pumpkin pie. Sipped this while watching Its the great pumpkin charlie brown, it's spices actually got more intense as I continued to drink it. I think I might make this a new Halloween tradition."
"D: Tasty and ridiculously easy to drink. Good scent and flavor and the subtlest warming make for a sipper that's gone all too quickly. Before the cold and wet winter really sets in, it's good to enjoy this liquid depiction of fall. Glad to have one more...and would seek this out again if it was was available on the west coast."
"Poured into a tulip. Appearance is fairly-dark orange with a white head and some pretty good lacing. Nose is pretty strong amounts of pumpkin as well as a bunch of spicing. Light sugar presence. Taste is a bit overspiced. Feel has a bit of extra spicing but fits pretty well balancing the sweetness. Drinks fairly well and is one of the nicer imperial pumpkins out there."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a orangey amber with a milky white 2 finger head that clung a bit to the sides. Small streams of carbonation rose from the bottom. Aroma was a creamy pumpkin pie, very lightly spiced, reminded me of a pumpkin eggnog. Flavor was more spices than pumpkin, but had some creaminess to it. Occasionally picked up a slight taste of bitterness, but not pronounced. Felt like a barleywine or old ale in the mouth, slightly sticky, coated well. Very pleasant to drink, not necessarily as a pumpkin ale, but as a solid beer."
"Autumn has a mystique. All seasons do, I know, but autumn is the most beloved because it is the most fleeting. If you grew up in the US, in the last few decades, there are certain tastes and smells that probably make you think of autumn, and unless you're some kind of weirdo whose mom didn't allow you to eat sugar (or if your dad was killed by a scarecrow), these flavors will make you happy. That is, this beer will make you happy."
"D- decent pumpkin ale but not great; I'd definitely seek this one out again to support the local brewery; comparing it to the bourbon barrel version I like the barrel version better..it's a little more complex, but not your standard pumpkin beer"
"Slightly hazy, orange-brown color, topped with a thin beige foam. Thin, stringy lace. Nice smell of hops with cinammon and spices. Full of flavor, with out any component overpowering. Nice balance of sweet malt, bitter hops, and pumkin pie spices, nutmeg. Smooth and creamy body, mouthfeel and carbonation added to the beer. Alcohol was there, but overly hot. Very tasty treat!!"
"Pours a hazy dark orange with a slight fluffy white head that fades fast. Smells like a pumpkin candle, great spice smell, some cinnamon and the sweetness comes off in the smell. Taste is sweet with great pumpkin flavor, with a heavy dose of spices. The spices linger on your tongue for a long aftertaste. The mouthfeel is medium-light, a nice heavy dose of flavor, good balance. This pumpkin ale is very enjoyable, the spices don't overwhelm, a good beer for the season. Worth checking out for fans of the style."
"The taste is centered around the maltiness with notes of honey and vanilla up front with heavy cinnamon and pie spice right behind it. Under that there is just a hint of pumpkin or squash like flavor. This finishes with a bland stale pumpkin flavor which seems artificial. This beer starts pleasant and end blah... next please!"
"Very good pumpkin beer. I will admit I am much more partial to The Greater Pumpkin but the Great holds its own. Easy to drink and the abv is very subtle. For a beer at 8% the smooth flavor is ridiculous. I have had better pumpkin beers but this is worthy of a repeat purchase."
"D: While not being particularly remarkable, this beer is quite easy to drink, though I'm not sure if I would have another based on the taste."
"D - Excellent October beverage."
"D-Had the whole 22oz bomber, I recommend this brew to anyone who enjoys a good pumpkin ale. I will definitely buy it again."
"D - Definitely a step up in terms of intensity compared to your run of the mill pumpkin ale... An interesting offering with some components I really like and some I don't... Worthy of exploring due to it's uniqueness, but not something I would necessarily seek out again..."
"Make this one walk the plank..."
"drinkability: Doesn't match up to DFH Punkin or Weyerbacher Imperial in my opinion."
"Pours a nice bright orange. Great aroma of nutmeg pumpkin, and spices. Taste is really nice. Again Nutmeg, spices, a nice pumpkin, but nothing too sweet. A great addition to the pumpkin ale selection. This one can stand tall with Pumpking and Smuttynose. A solid Ale that doesn't overwhelm with alchohol, even though its an Imperial. Nicely balanced to bring out a great fall flavor."
"I look forward to Greater Pumpkin (which is this beer aged in bourbon oak barrels, which I also bought)."
"D - Could drink this all night, excellent."
"Overall a nice beer. I would have a tough time choosing this over Weyebacher, which says a lot. Then again, considering the availability of ST Pumking in OH what am I considering either for?"
"Serving Type: Bottle to a chilled Pilsner glass. Still have learn about the correct glasses to drink out of."
"Tasteis bit better than the aroma. Pumpkin dominates, with nutmeg, vanilla, cinnamon, and spice also being noticed. There is an underlying bitterness that tries to keep it as balanced as it can which is nice. Medium bodied, slightly syrupy mouthfeel is solid, but the pumpkin and spice levels take away from the drinkability for me (although just about any pumpkin ale isn't all that drinkable to me.)"
"Pours a hazed coppery orange color with nuce head, retention and lacing. Scent is dominated by a strong spice profile - the typical cinammon, clove, nutmeg - but also has a decent backbone of pumpkin puree and grahmn crackery malt. Taste is again heavy on the spice, maybe a touch too much for my taste, but the backbone of pumpkin puree, grahmn cracker and sweet cream and brown sugar sweetness makes it one of the top beers in its style. Fuller side of medium bodied, creamy and smooth, slightly dry. Well i haveta do the comparison to pumpking - not as sweet with a higher spice profile. Again, a top notch pumpkin brew."
"The doctor is in, and ready to celebrate the season.  This is a great pumpkin beer, and didn't even need to wait in a patch all night just to experience it.  Happy Halloween Charlie Brown.  This is truly it, the night the Great Pumpkin appeared!  And of it wasn't so sweet and just a touch boozy, I'd be waiting for this beer every year.  "
"As far as the side by, to be honest, I couldn't pick up on any major differences. I think the Greater Pumpkin is a correct description, as I preferred it over the other, but again, no striking major differences."
"Taste follows suit with a nicely balanced, spicy pumpkin ale. Not over-hopped (my complaint with DFH Punk), tastes like a nice pumpkin bread. Moderate MF, creamy. Good drinkability, had this next to Pumking, and Pumking was the winner/more interesting brew, but this one made a strong showing. A nice example of a spicy pumpkin ale (and affordable at ~$6/22 oz.)."
"The beer pours a hazy amber color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a very balanced malt and fruit scent. It boasts of pale and crystal malts along with a solid pumpkin aroma and a wonderful spice bouquet. The taste is outstanding. It's bold and flavorful with excellent pumpkin flavor. The malt bill is tasty and balanced. The pumpkin spices are present, but not overly so. It goes down smooth with little alcohol warmth. The mouthfeel is great. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good drinking fall seasonal. It's better than most pumpkin beers out there and it packs twice the punch."
"D - this'd be a great draught to sit back and watch a game with. not as sessionable as some other pumpkin offerings, but that's a consequence of the alcohol more than anything else. a tasty beer, nice to have more new offerings in the pumpkin category."
"Definitely worth checking out. I'm enjoying this one and it isn't as filling as a few others out there."
"Notes For me it was a little heavy on the spice but still good overall."
"Flavor is very well balanced and rounded. Malt is crisp and naturally sweetened by pumpkin - a moderate fruit flavor that allows each to be present, but neither overpowering. No stickiness or artificial hints. The spices are not overpowering as with most pumpkin beers - cinnamon and cloves are the most prominent, while ginger and nutmeg support. There is a touch of tartness towards the end. All around a very clean beer that drinks lighter than it is. Carbonation has a yeasty feel to it, medium-strong and functional with the spice notes."
"Taste: Spices seem a little out of balance. I don't really get the sense that I'm drinking a pumpkin pie like I get from other spiced pumpkin beers."
"medium bodied, medium-carbonation mouthfeel. for me, a drinkability level on par with it's flavor, which is to say average."
"drinkability is ok - the flavor rivals other top pumkin ales"
"i felt compelled to review this because it was a good surprise.. i was disappointed with the pumpkin ales this year with the exception of DFH for the most part.. southern tier pumking was a huge letdown.. this beat out southern tier. it's actually pretty good. glad i tried this as i will pick up again.. it's probably not an A beer for it's very worthy.. and it's only $5.99 which makes it very nice. nice flavor in this i thought it was very easy to drink.. very nice surprise.."
"::Editing my score, cause I'm changing it from bottle to on tap.::"
"d - A pretty good pumpkin ale. I enjoyed the smell a lot. I wish the taste had been a little sweeter and a little more pumpkin than spice, but still a good beer. Would try again."
"Pours a hazy orange-ish color with yellow hints, with a white head. In the aroma, pumpkin, spice, and a hint of alcohol. In the taste, brown sugar, cinnamon, pumpkin, and ends with some alcohol. A spice like bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a semi dry spice in the aftertaste. Nice spice and a bit hot from alcohol."
"D: Let's see....How will I remember this one in a line up of other notable pumpkin brews? The Weyerbacher had the over the top cinnamon taste (which I didn't like); """Pumking""" had the orgasmic graham cracker nose that is to die for; Schlafly had the deep caramel richness. I thought to myself: What does this one have? Therein lies the problem. While I truly believe that this pumpkin ale is nearly flawless in it's style class, I can't think of any sort of """Wow factor""" characteristic that sets it apart from others."
"The pumpkin flavor is so smooth, great spices too but not overpowering. A great balance, I wish I could drink this all year."
"D- Easy to drink and a good pumpkin ale. I feel that it would be better if it had some breadyness or had a stout or brown ale flavor. If you like pumpkin ales this is worth trying."
"Drinkability: Quite good, but overall I think I'd like to get another bottle and put it away for about a year (kind of like Pumking). Still a great beer, but I think if I had to pick the best overall pumpkin ale to have fresh, I'd have to go with Frogs Hollow."
"Drinkablity- I wouldn't call this sessionable, but it is certainly going down smooth. I won't have any problem finishing this bomber. Highly recommended."
"D: Smooth and tasty. Alcohol isn't in the flavor, which makes this quite easy to drink."
"D: Wow - great job by Heavy Seas on this one IMO. Glad I'm only halfway through this one as I have another half to get through!"
"D: I greatly enjoyed this beer and had no trouble finishing a 22oz. I might be in trouble if I drank 2 but that's a different issue"
"D - one is enough for me, decent flavor, unique taste. pumpkin beers are hit or miss for me and this one is a miss."
"Pours a dark golden with a fairly light head, but good clarity. Smells sweet with pumpkin pie spice and a sweet pumpkin tanginess. Tastes sweet and strong with some more pumpkin pie spice, and a bit beefy with a late alcoholic sting. The mouthfeel is a little too sweet and sharp on the alcohol front, and overall this beer just seems a little too much without delivering the concurrent pleasure needed to justify all the alcohol."
"Really tasty and pretty drinkable, even with the strength. I would like to get a bottle for the cellar just to see how it is once it calms down. After a full bomber, the 8% ABV will leave you a bit woozy. Split with a friend if you need to drive!"
"M, D - I like the feel, balance, sweet malt, CO2 level, and drinkability... all except the seemingly artificial """cinnamon.""" Not too bad otherwise."
"D: Despite my complaining, this is a decent """imperial""" pumpkin offering."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is decent, it's a little sweet to drink much of though. It was a pretty decent pumpkin beer but the flavor just wasn't as good as Pumking for my personal tastes. It still falls into one of the better pumpkin beers available here though so I can't say I won't buy it again though when it comes back in season."
"Feel and Drinkability: Dry finish with cinnamon lingering. Body is on the lighter side of heavy. Easy enough to drink, but I think that I could only drink one bottle of this. The high degree of spice would start to irk me after a while. I believe it would benefit from more malt sweetness to give balance to the spices. The more I drink of it the less upfront the spices become. I could see drinking two bombers of this in one sitting, no more. This is a good pumpkin ale, but not one that I'm gonna rush to drink every year, this isn't a must have every year as the the Schlafly, Wyerbacher, or Pumking are."
"Pours a hazed orange amber with a very thin white headskie. Easy drinking and smooth bodied. A touch thin perhaps, but very easy going. Pumpkin beers I find to be very hit or miss, and Heavy Seas has a good one here. Not over the top with the spices, once can actually taste the fruit de pumpkin in the mix with a slight sweetness that is immediately countered by a sharp but mellow hop balance. I like it."
"Anyone who has ever liked an Imperial pumpkin ale will like Clipper City Heavy Seas The Great Pumpkin Ale. It's solid from every angle and is a seasonal that I will definitely buy again. Bottom line: good gourd beer."
"Pours a one finger cream head that fades to a ring, leaving some lace. Almost clear pale amber color. Pumpkin spice nose. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Flavor is pumpkin pie spices. Nice balance of spice and malts. $6.75 for a 22oz bottle from Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, Me."
"This pours a hazy golden amber color with a modest ring of off-white head and meager slivers of lacing. The aroma is a pleasant nutmeg and sweet pumpkin spice. There's a curious herbal hop in there too I think. The flavor comes out with something that approximates the aroma. Lots of nutmeg, allspice and semi-sweet pumpkin and some hop bitterness that seems more citrus now, orange bite. It's a little grainy, bright with some lemony highlights. It's mid-bodied plus with modest carbonation. Not highly drinkable but drinks reasonably for an 8 percent imperial. Very decent stuff for that seasonal satisfation, well done Heavy Seas."
"D: Not as good as Pumpking but still pretty good."
"Not necessarily a bad example of the style or anything but this needed to dial back the spice and warmth a bit. This was worth at least a try but there are better options out there each fall."
"D: A little tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, I wasn't expecting much of this beer but I found it to be pretty good for the style even though there are others that I would choose first."
"Drinkability: A good, admirable, though not great pumpkin brew, but I will certainly say it exceeded my modest expectations after the lackluster showing of the previous members of the Mutiny Fleet. Give it a try, provided you're a fan of pumpkin ales!"
"Drinkability: decent fall beer but one bomber bottle was enough in a single session."
"If I had to rank my personal top five pumpkin ales this would rank fifth. Southern Tier Pumking, Hoppin Frog Frog's Hollow, Shipyard Imperial Pumpkin, St. Ambroise, then this. Not a great example of the style, but well worth trying."
"A nice beer. One of my favorite versions of a pumpkin ale. I enjoyed this one as it was an imperial pumpkin ale and I havent had one before. Not as watery as other pumpkin ales Ive had this year."
"Drinkability - worth a try. Needs a little more base flavor and a little less hootch."
"Drinkability: An interesting beer. The high alcohol content pairs well with the pumpkin flavoring. This is a good fall seasonal but not necessarily something I'll get again."
"This is one fantastic pumpkin ale. Loads of flavor, but nothing that overwhelms the senses or dominates the other features; amongst my autumn favorites."
"Found this on in the cask at Rustico Friday night so thought I would give a shot. This was my first Clipper City beer and did lead me to try a few others over the weekend in DC. The beer poured a cloudy semi-dark copper color with a course one finger head that headed quickly as to be expected with a cask. The pumpkin aroma was immediately noticeable even in a packed bar. There was also smokey hints to the beer this beer. The taste settled well on the pallette and was more pumpkin flavor than pumpkin pie flavor which was pleasing for a holiday varietal. The smokey flavor came out in a distinctive clove finish. Was a good cask for this very fresh and full of flavor."
"All in all, I'm pretty impressed with this beer. I've never had anything by Clipper City before, but this is definitely a good first impression. I would rate this right up there with some of my all time favorite pumpkins."
"Anyway, it's a decent pumpkin ale... like drinking the liquid canned pumpkin pie filling of beers. I can see it as a sipper alongside dessert wines, but I might O.D. on sugar if I down a pint."
"I bought this beer at Blacklick liquors in Blacklick (near Reynoldsburg, outside Columbus), OH."
"I'm wondering if Southern Tier's Pumking wasn't the inspiration here? It's big on alcohol, it's big on flavor, the aroma is tantalizing, it's creamy...and it's just short of Pumking, which is a compliment, because Pumking is king (imo). If you're gonna do a pumpkin ale, make it big and bold I say, and Clipper City have. This is great!!!"
"Medium body, carbonation seems a bit light. Some warming alcohol. Spices seem to fight each other a bit, rather than smoothing thigs out. Too earthy in the finish for me. Having said that, this is still a nice pumpkin beer."
"Overall- Very good Pumpkin Ale. 1 bomber is enough but a good dessert beer."
"Notes: A nice offer from the sometimes irregular Clipper City's Heavy Seas series. Not a favorite as I don't find anything too remarkable or pleasing and I would rather chase this brewery for other offerings. But this is actually a rather balanced and well done brew, pleasing to drink for what the style is typically after, in particular when it looks to double or imperial designations."
"This poured a hazy copper with light tan head. It smelled like pumpkin and coriander and lemon zest, with some copper hops and bready yeast. It tasted like orange and lemon zest and pumpkin, with coriander and other spices and a bit of bready yeast. It was somewhat thick with some carbonation, and had a bitter aftertaste. Overall this was a mediocre pumpkin ale. The flavors and body were good, not great. It hid the alcohol well, so it wasn't difficult to drink. I tried this on Halloween for the novelty, and would only recommend it under the same conditions."
"Poured a great crimson brown wiht good carbonation and a small offwhite head that left lace on top of a good base aroma of pumpkin, nutmeg, clove and hints of cinnamon. A medium body that passes over smoothly with a a little sharpness thanks to spicy cloveness. A solid pumpkin taste along with cinnamon and nutmeg that gives off a good sweetness. A good pumpkin beer that is not overpowering."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: It had a nice light carbonation that made it easy to drink. It felt very clean while still being a very thick beer. Overall, it does not overwhelm the palate."
"D - Overall this is a solid pumpkin beer...I enjoyed mine on cask but I don't think I could take a bomber of this because of the alcohol coming out as the beer warmed...The Great Pumpkin is a step up for the DIPA...in my opinion"
"uscaptainsblog.blogspot.com"
"Pours a slightly hazy orangish brown color with a slight off white head that gives way to some lacing. The aroma is of pumpkin and cloves with a hint of nutmeg as well. The taste is of a sweet pumpkin and possibly a brown sugar and a sweet malt backbone. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated. The drinkability is fairly high on this, the taste is sweet and not bitter like some pumpkin ales, overall you could drink a lot of these and enjoy them all."
"22oz bottle into a Duvel snifter pours a slightly hazy orange with a thin off white head that diminishes to a ring and leaves spotty lacing on the glass. Aroma is dominated by pumpkin spice with slight caramel malt. The taste is loads of pumpkin spice with slightly cloying sweet malts as well, there is also loads of boozy alcohol that becomes even more present as the beer warms. The beer is somewhat heavy with more alcohol presence than I would want in a pumpkin ale. I must say, the Mutiny Fleet series is starting to be one disappointment after another. Imperial beers are supposed to have more flavor overall, not just excessive alcohol on top of the standard flavors."
"D- Even though it was a little sweeter than expected, this beer was fairly well balanced...hits on all the right notes, but just isn't exceptional...a solid brew that is worth a try, but probably not a revisit..."
"Beer is bitter, sharp and spicy. Hard to drink. I'm not a huge fan of pumpkin beers but this one has a warming alcohol flavor that thins out the mouthfeel. Drinkability low due to odd bitterness on the back end. Not a repeat but you pumpkinheads may like it."
"Not a bad Pumpkin Ale overall, but the alcohol lowers the drinakability a little. The spices are also on the high end."
"I think this beer captures quite well the essence of a pumpkin beer. I've had many this season, and this one seems to stand out...it's well-balanced, spiced, and works well across the palate. Aside from Southern Tier's """Pumking," this is one of the best."
"This is a pretty solid beer, but is not so exceptional or different from other pumpkin ales out on the market that I can see any reason to seek it out. The one glass I had the other evening will likely be the only one I order this season."
"In my tulip glass, the beer was a hazy dark orange with a thin white head. Pleasant aroma of pumpkin and spice. The aroma translated into a stronger taste of pumpkin and pumpkin spice. A bit of warming alcohol, not intrusive. I felt like I was drinking a liquid pumpkin pie. Very smooth, great pumpkin beer."
"Despite the mouthfeel, this is a decent example of the style. It seems to me that whenever pumpkin beers ramp up the alcohol, the taste gets ramped up as well. You can't go wrong with trying this but Pumking is where it's at."
"I appreciate the idea...we need more Imperial Pumpkins like Pumking, but this one doesn't quite meet my expectations."
"Although this isn't my favorite imperial pumpkin ale, the subtler flavors do enhance the drinkability of the beer. I probably wouldn't return to this one, but I'm glad I had an opportunity to try it."
"D- Could have continued to drink throughout the night. One of the better pumpkin ales we have tasted this year."
"A decent pumpkin ale, but there are better ones available."
"D: A nice pumpkin ale, the spices are a bit over the top, but I was glad to try it."
"Pours from the 22oz. bomber bottle a medium amber-is color with a half finger head that quickly dissolved into a light lacing. I see almost ZERO carbonation going on, I can practically count the bubbles on one hand. The aroma is malty and slightly sweet, with hints of pumpkin pie spices and maybe just a hint of brown sugar. 1st sip brings a strong hint of pumpkin (yes, you can actually taste the pumpkin), malt, and spices. There is a strong bitterness on the finish from a combination or hops, alcohol & spice. The mouth feel is smooth and neither heavy or watery. Drinkability is pretty good...I could see myself downing a few of these on a Saturday or Sunday while watching football. Overall, a very good beer, IMHO. A nice take on a style that seems to be a love-it-or-hate-it type of beer. I, for one, love it!"
"Final thoughts: Yep, it's a pumpkin beer alright. Some toasty pumpkin flavor, light on the spices, but ridiculously sweet! Then the long nagging sweet pumpkin flavor that turns somewhat bitter and won't go away takes a lot from the drinkability. Also, did I mention its way too sweet! It's got a nice alcohol taste, warmth, and slight burn with is unusual for a pumpkin beer, but, you know, the sweetness. Don't think I could stomach this again. If it were, say, 1/10 the sweetness I might be able to attempt this again."
"D - Pretty solid for 8%. The alcohol is barely noticeable behind all the spices. One of the best pumpkin ales I've had, this one will make a great fall beer."
"This beer doesn't take the style to the next level, but it sure doesn't do it a disservice. I really like it and will check it out during the future fall seasons."
"d: a nice enough pumpkin, but it suffers in the complexity department - lacking in pumpkin flavor and not totally balancing the spice, alcohol isn't an issue"
"This beer pours a nice deep clear amber color with a one finger of off white sudsy head that recedes relatively quickly. Minimal spotty lacing left on the glass. Nose is spicey - nutmeg and cinnamon dominate, some pumpkin and malts filter in as well. Taste is similar to the other pumpkin ales that are heavy on the spice/pumpkin pie aspect, though this one seems a bit off balance. Spices seem to fight the pumpkin flavoring rather than compliment them. Cinnamon and nutmeg dominate the flavor with pumpkin and malts trying to fight through. Lighter side of medium bodied, mild carbonation, thick and chewy feel to the body. This was a decent brew, but I've had better offerings of the style."
"Drinkabilty: Although I'm fairly new to these """Imperial Pumpkin""" brews, I like this showing from Clipper City. The spiciness really sets this apart from any other pumpkin on the shelf. Although this may be it's downfall, since it has alot more of a spice feature then a pumpkin taste. Otherwise, you still get a good pumpkin backdrop and you still get a 8% brew thats decently drinkable and loaded with interesting qualities. I liked this way more then their Imperial Octoberfest and will definetley have a few more of these as the fall continues on!"
"A solid pumpkin that I really enjoyed the more I had, but I would not rate it on par with the top dogs. Still a solid beer that I would drink in the fall. I enjoyed the imperial part with the higher abv. Nice."
"Nice medium body with lots of pumpkin pie spice. Pretty malty for the style with a lot of pumpkin flavor, cinnamon, brown sugar, vanilla, ginger and nutmeg. The spiciness is pretty prominent but doesn't overpower the pumpkin lasting into a dry finish . This one is thick and complex and the ABV is very well masked making it pretty drinkable. Not the best example of the style but pretty good."
"Full and rich mouthfeel. Very tasty and drinkable."
"Overall this is a solid attempt at a pumpkin beer by a brewery that usually turns out good beers. It doesn't do much to differentiate itself from others in the style but what's done is done well. Worth a shot."
"Overal this was an enjoyable, easily drinkable brew. The only qualm is that a hallow, medicinal aftertaste ensues--I want the warmth of a pumpkin pie!!"
"Drinkability- Strong and more of a seasonal novelty. Seek if a fan of the style."
"Anyway-very nice autumn hue to it-looks like fall in a glass. Deep orange in color, small tight head. Aroma tends to be very spicy and not enough malt or pumpkin. Flavor comes up a bit with a hint of pumpkin, spices and a touch of caramel sweetness. Good mouthfeel for sure-at 8% a very solid feel to it. Ok overall. Too much spice for me. Now that everyone has a pumpkin/fall beer they all run together including this one. I need more gourd, less spice."
"Actually suprisingly tasty after not being too impressed with the aroma. Easy to drink for an imperial pumpkin, dangerously so. Nice mix of spices, not picking up too much pumpkin flavor but I'm not complaining. Still can't believe that the ABV is really as high as it is. Great beer, Charlie Brown."
"Deep brownish amber, very hard to see through but not completely translucent. Thin off white head that recedes to a thick cap with minimal lacing. Mild aroma of pumpkin with light spices (nutmeg most prominent, a little cinnamon) but lingering metallic notes detract from the smell. Thicker, chewy body, with light carbonation, very smooth mouthfeel overall and no alcohol presence. Flavor starts very spicy, clove and cinnamon which mellows out the fruity sweetness which follows and lingers into the finish. Never very overly pumpkin, or spicy for that matter, this beer doesn't really compare in the over the top pumpkin flavors of something like Pumpking. I don't usually care for pumpkin beers that much so this is actually nice in its restraint and balance."
"Certainly worth a try for $3.99..."
"I think its a nice balance of malt, hops, and spice but as with most pumpkin beers i just dont get the amount of pumpkin i think should be there! overall a nice fall beer!"
"M&D - smooth, and easy to drink, the metallic note to the taste is a bit off putting, overall its a good beer, there are much better pumpkin ales or Heavy Seas offerings, but tasty"
