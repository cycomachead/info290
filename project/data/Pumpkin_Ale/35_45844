3.66,5.5,3.25,4,3.75,3,3.5,"This beer pours with a small cream-colored head that settled quickly in to a thin layer with little lacing. There is nice clarity to the amber liquid. The scent of pumpkin pie spices leap from the glass, making me long for whipped cream and a buttery crust. Small hints of cherry cordial. The flavor is spice-forward and a little unbalanced. Tangy, bold coriander citrus with abundant cinnamon, ginger and allspice. The amber malts and vague pumpkin flavor struggle to keep up. The mouthfeel is medium-thin with a pithy, prickly carbonation. The finish consists of burnt caramel and gingersnaps. Outside of the scent, there is little pumpkin to be found here. It's a gingerbread house in a bottle. Despite the overriding spice themes, this is surprisingly easy to drink. It is somehow cleaner than many of the other comparable offerings, which seems like a a contradiction. Quite enjoyable.","JohnnyI","Dec 28, 2014"

Great smell of pumpkin - not overpowering and mixes well with the malts they use. Mouthfeel is decent - not too big into something that is too carbonated, so I scored it lower there.

If you are looking for a harvest style beer then you are in luck. With traditional autumnal spices, such as warming cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg, this beer embraces the classic flavors of the American harvest season. Although you can definitely taste hints of pumpkin flavor, it is, by no means, a pumpkin beer. The pumpkin flavor is subtle, at best, and does not necessarily fit its namesake as a harvest """pumpkin""" ale. The beer's mouthfeel is an average experience, combining a medium-high carbonation with a style that is better fitted by lower level of carbonation. One additional positive note is the beer's dark amber coloring that pairs well with the backdrop of the season's falling leaves. Overall, this was a good harvest beer. There was nothing particularly exceptional, but also not much about which to complain. I found this beer to have a high drinkability factor, and would recommend Sam Adams' Harvest Pumpkin Ale to any casual beer drinker in search of a seasonal harvest brew.","xoxirishrose","Nov 03, 2013"

Decently viscous which gives you a good thick mouthful of beer to really get that pumpkin essence. Nice balance of spice with a hint of sweetness that really takes this beer to the 4.0 outstanding level. Not my all time favorite pumpkin (see my reviews on my local Crossroads Brewing Company of Athens NY """Dr. Loomis Pumkin Ale""" and of course """Southern Tier Pumpking""") but very very good overall. For the price (~$8.99 a sixer at the local """Beer World""") probably one of the best in that category if you like Fall pumpkin ales.","Brouwerij78","Oct 15, 2013"

As it slowly fell, I was left with great lacing. Color was a deep mahogany (!) (SRM = > 27, < 34) with NE-plus quality clarity. They must have filtered the bejeezus out of the beer to get it this bright! I could see into my future and it was my 50th birthday party in Lincoln, NE with Val Midwest for her 21st. Nose smelled like what the Brewdogs boys tried to make in Philly - molasses, cinnamon, spruce tips, pumpkin. This was a revolutionary-era beer if I ever smelled one. The mouthfeel was big, creamy, and full. The taste was beautiful - some malt, some pumpkin, some spice, some caramel. It was like candy, but not in a bad way. Leave it to Brewer Bob and the boys to nail it. I think that I have hit upon a new favorite! Finish was semi-sweet, allowing me to savor the flavors without getting overwhelmed with sweetness, which is where a lot of pumpkin ales leave me high and dry. I now want to do a side-by-side with Pumking, which was my previous # 1.","woodychandler","Oct 13, 2013"

Pours fairly crystal clear ruby copper color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of pumpkin, cinnamon, clove, caramel, toast, nutmeg, gingerbread, brown sugar, light chocolate, herbal, and toasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of malt, pumpkin, and spice notes; with solid strength. Taste of pumpkin, caramel, brown sugar, toast, cinnamon, nutmeg, gingerbread, light clove, light chocolate, herbal, and toasted earthiness. Lingering notes of pumpkin, caramel, brown sugar, cinnamon, toast, nutmeg, gingerbread, light clove, light chocolate, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Nice balance of malt, pumpkin, and spice flavors; with decent robustness and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and moderately crisp mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice pumpkin ale. Good all around balance of malt, pumpkin, and spice flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Sep 30, 2013"

I could say it's too vegetal tasting, but it's pumpkin beer and authentic pumpkin beer made with real pumpkins is going to have that flavor. I'm not a big fan of the style, but it seems like sacrilege not to have at least one pumpkin beer when in the fall.","marcobrau","Sep 17, 2013"

Popping the top I get a waft of cinnamon and spice and everything nice including a hint of clove and some maltiness. Appropriately pouring into a SAPP this brew partakes a deep bronze with a very thick tan head looking much like pumpkin pie in a glass. On the sip the spices are very prominent jumping out on the initial taste then fading back to give way to very classic slightly bitter cinnamon pumpkin pie crust flavor. Units is a very deep flavored almost warming brew, maybe a bit early to be imbibing as it would serve well when the mercury drops.

There are also flavors of caramel and hops, but the nutmeg/cinnamon/brown sugar (I can't put my finger on all of the spices) unfortunately present the backbone of this underachieving pumpkin ale.

It says on the bottle that they add 17 pounds of pumpkin per barrel and you sure get that flavor. To be honest, I would have liked it better if it was more of a pumpkin pie flavor rather than just pumpkin. Not a bad pumpkin ale but I do like other pumpkin ales better.","Weston19","Aug 16, 2013"

This has a great dark caramel color and low carbonation. The aroma is subtle yet pleasing. It is a bit sweet for my taste, very malty with a hint of pumpkin spice. Not bad overall, but I would not buy a six pack of it.","bbrossi1974","Aug 11, 2013"

The underlying beer seems to suffer a bit from these additions, lacking distinct characteristics, and the aftertaste is unfortunately lingering and overly raw in pumpkin flesh, leaving a mildly unpleasant flavor on the tongue. But subsequent sips of the beer do much to relieve this aftertaste, and at an easily-drinkable 5.7% ABV, this is a nice lunch beer for sunny fall afternoons.","jondeelee","Jan 14, 2013"

3.21,-7.5,4.5,3.5,3,3,3,"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, Harvest Pumpkin Ale is a red-amber color with a thick, cream-colored, pillowy head. The nose is a mixture of sweet amber malts and spices - cinnamon, cloves and all-spice. The taste follows suit with the spices coming to the forefront and the beer being well balanced, even to the point of slightly bitter on the finish - as opposed to most pumpkin ales that seem to lean more to the sweeter side of the spectrum. Mouthfeel is light in body with a minimally active carbonation and slightly dry finish. Overall, this is not a bad pumpkin ale; that being said there are many better ones out there too.","gmfessen","Nov 13, 2012"

3.72,7.2,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Pours a bright clear dark red with a moderate sized head. Nice pumpkin pie aroma but not overpowering. Taste has a definite pumpkin character. Toasted malt and a little spice but again not too much which is good. There is just a touch of tartness too which I'm not sure if I like or not. Medium bodied. Easily drinkable.

Smell is of pumpkin meat and spice. Mouthfeel is rather thick, wet, and refreshing. It felt chewy. Cinnamon bread notes and a plum finish make this a sweet dessert beer. Very malty with little hop presence. It hit the spot and left me satisfied. It is nothing like other pumpkin ales I have had (with Dogfish still holding the number one slot in that specific endeavor). Definitely worth a try if you like pumpkin ales.","dsmcva00","Sep 28, 2012"

3.75,8.1,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Poured into a Samuel Adams perfect pint glass. Pours clear dark amber with a tall, off-white head that dissipates at a moderate pace. There is a moderate amount of visible tiny bubbles rising in the beer. There are aromas of cinnamon, clove, allspice, and pumpkin. It smells like pumpkin bread. Those pumpkin bread notes are definitely there up front, but they're not very strong. There's the spiciness from the cinnamon, clove, and allspice and the pumpkin flavors complement the malt very well. The body is light to medium with moderate carbonation. The finish is crisp and clean. The drinkability is high. This is a very good beer that serves as a good introduction to this style.","acevenom","Aug 26, 2012"

If they toned down the spices a bit and upped the O.G. then this one might be a real winner, but for now it's just an above average beer that would pair well with a cool autumn night around a campfire.","JamesMN","Aug 16, 2012"

Already grabbed a sixer after tasting it in the harvest 12 pack. Pretty drinkable, I had no problem going through two of these in a night alongside various other beers.","AwYeh","Aug 12, 2012"

It's a chestnut brown color, capped with an off-white head. Good clarity. The aroma is pumpkin pie and malt. It smells like autumn. Modest hop scent and a little toasted character...sizable spice component in the smell. The taste is semi-dry, which is probably necessary to keep the beer balanced. Spice, pumpkin, malt, and a low-level sweetness in the flavor. The pie spices are not overdone, which is a good thing in my opinion. Full in body. Better than most in this style.","Suds","Aug 11, 2012"

3.82,10.1,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Another good quality with this beer is the fact that the flavor is more natural overall.

Color is a nice dark amber with a cola like head that disappeared just as with cola. Smell is like a spiced cookie but with this distracting smell like the smell of salt when you prepare a warm salt water gargle. Taste is that usual spicy after shave that dominates the style. I do appreciate the dryness in the finish which helps to keep the spiciness from getting out of hand. I probably won't seek it out again, but again I don't seek out this style by any brewer.","Justin23060","Dec 28, 2011"

The aromas include a very slight roasted nuts or a burnt sugar smell with a dominant flavoring of cinnamon and pumpkin flavors.

3.57,2.9,3.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,"(2010) Samuel Adams Harvest Pumpkin Ale is a crystal clear deep amber ale with a small khaki head that fades to a blotch and leaves nice lacing on the glass. There is spice, wood and pumpkin in the nose with notes of nutmeg and vanilla. It's medium-light bodied and pretty smooth. It leaves the mouth a little silty. There's more spice than pumpkin here. I can't isolate a pumpkin flavor. The spices and the hops work together well to provide a moderate bitterness. It has a good, caramelly malt presence that's not too sweet. There's good balance all around. It's very autumny and very Sam Adams. It's American in style, but there seem to be heavy nods to England and Germany here.

Harvest Pumpkin Ale falls into the latter category. It’s pretty good, but doesn’t really distinguish itself from the crowd. It’s also just a tad pumpkin heavy. A little more balance among the spices would go a long way. All in all, pretty good stuff. If you’re a pumpkin beer fanatic, it’s probably one you should check out.","prototypic","Oct 14, 2011"

The taste followed suit, a nice deep malt flavor with the mix of spices, definitely pumpkin, the cinnamon comes through the most but the spices are all there. This one has a medium body with decent carbonation and a bit smoother than what I am used to from Sam Adams.

Slightly vegetable quality up front in the flavour, moderate bitterness that appeared towards the finish, sweet and spicy in the middle, a little bready. More of the nutmeg and ginger with slight cinnamon that was apparent in the nose. Slightly slick in the finish, nice texture overall, medium to light bodied with moderate carbonation.

Not only are there Marzen and Marzen-like offerings, there is the pumpkin beer. Sam's attempt is similar to many of their offerings: Not terrible, but not amazing.

4.12,18.7,4,4.5,4,4,4,"I was really excited to try this one since I look forward to the release of pumpkin beers each fall. The beer pours a orangish-brown color with a white head. The aroma is classic pumpkin ale, with lots of pumpkin and nutmeg notes. The flavor is more of the same. I get a ton of pumpkin, along with the classic pumpkin pie spices of cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice. I also get some caramel malt. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Not quite as good as Weyerbacher Imperial Pumpkin or ST Pumpking, but a step above most of the pumpkin ales that are on the market.

Mouthfeel is fine, some larger bubbles off the tongue, medium bodied.

3.46,-0.3,3.5,2.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Pours from the 12 oz. bottle a reddish brown color with a 1/2 finger off-white head that vanished almost as soon as I was finished pouring. The carbonation is very light, I can practically count the bubbles on one hand. Aroma is of spice and a light caramel note. 1st sip brings a note of spice (cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice) with a slight hint of caramel and a rich background of pumpkin. This is the closest to the """pumpkin pie in a glass""" cliche that I have ever come across. The mouthfeel is medium bodied.

Aroma is mild with a note of pumpkin spice and perhaps a hint of cinnamon. A hefty grainy toasted malt body comes through in the mouthfeel and finishes with a somewhat peppery spiced detail. Not much sweetness seems to come through in the flavor to me and I am led to believe that this is more in the style of a traditional pumpkin ale as opposed to the BIG and eclectic Fall brews of American craft beer today.

The nose is a very light semisweetness of pumpkin, with a light blend of cinnamon and nutmeg spicing. Aromas are much lighter than most pumpkin brews. Flavor is a rich malt sweetness, with some pumpkin bread characteristics at the tail-end of the palate. The spicing is very light and faint on the palate, but deepens with the aftertaste, and does a good job balancing overall. The aftertaste is light and balanced, as I said before, but not overly remarkable. The finish is quick and a bit on the limp side. It just quietly exits the palate without a lot of fanfare. This one had a decent start, but comes up lame down the stretch.","GarthDanielson","Sep 10, 2011"

The pumpkin and spices announce themselves in a lower key on the nose. They are there but not overdone. The body is on the full side. Clove, pepper, and sweet malts rule the day in the flavor followed by a moderately bitter finish. This lands high on my list of pumpkin ales but not the highest.

The taste holds notes of lightly toasted caramel, mandarin orange syrup, brown sugar, cinnamon, light clove, light toasted pumpkin seeds, and a good amount of wheat. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly watery feel.

After sitting for a few seconds it develops a mild sourness that lingers and distracts from the initial impact. Overall I don't think the beer is that good because of the aftertaste.

A nice looking beer to start. Smell had a lot of spice notes to it. Taste was appealing, with flavors of cinnamon, nutmeg and pumpkin really standing out. Mouthfeel was appropriate for a pumpkin ale - smooth but with a bit of heartiness. Drinkability was good, as this beer had a bit of body to it, and had an enticing flavor that made you want to take the next sip. As this is Sam Adams' first commercial venture into the seasonal and finicky world of pumpkin ales, I was skeptical at first. But I will have to admit, SA released a satisfying brew with this one.

The smell is typical pumpkin pie spices namely the nutmeg, cinnamon and allspice. The taste matches the smell. Upfront you get the typical pumpkin pie spice flavors. This is backed by a solid caramel malt base with little if any evident hop bitterness or flavor/aroma. This beer is crisp and relatively dry the finish leaves a lingering pie spiciness. I'm glad that it isn't overly sweet and is well attenuated I prefer a pumpkin beer to be dry as opposed to sweet. Overall I'm quite pleased with this beer. I feel that the Boston Beer Company did a good job on this tricky style.

The taste is of a sweet caramel malt backbone with a little toastiness to it, there is a flavor of clove and cinnamon over the top with a good, but not great pumpkin flavor. Again for the class it is a nice flavor but not as rich and bold as other class leaders. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated.

Moutfeel is medium-light with a lively effervescence. An extremely easy drinking example of the style. I have to say that I am not a huge fan of the style per se, but when I crave a Pumpkin Ale I usually go for a big beer (Pumking, Imperial Pumpkin, etc.).

Definitely a more balanced Pumpkin Ale than most offerings, and actually this could be setting a standard for me for the style. It tastes like pumpkin, but the spices and the pumpkin flavor do not mask the ale. So far, I have tried two other pumpkin ales, one that was quite spicey,(ichabod) and one that was a delicious but really rich, amped up pumpkin ale, (Punkin'), and this one fits nicely right in the middle.

It could stand for a little bit more in the bittering hop department to keep the finish crisp like the Autumn air. It's got quite a filling mouthfeel and body, which isn't a detriment per se, but it certainly turns it from being an awesome all-day drinker to a two-bottle at a time max.

Pours a rather dark amber color bordering on reddish brown with a two finger khaki colored head and some decent lacing. Aroma is definitely more spicy than I imagined it would be. Definitely picking up on some nutmeg, brown sugar, and light pumpkin. It's very reminiscent of Anchor Christmas Ale. Taste is actually pretty decent, and not over the top pumpkin. From the aroma I thought this was going to be overly spiced, but it's actually very balanced between the nutmeg, pumpkin, and possibly even cinnamon? I also detect a certain citrusy quality on the back end that could possibly be described as bitter orange peel. Not much in the way of hops on this since the spices are the true star. Mouthfeel is medium-full, which I like because most pumpkin beers seem thin and overly pumpkiny. Honestly, I have to say that I like this beer. You can tell this has a very tasty base beer, and again I like that it's not over the top with the pumpkin, although I think the spicing can be taken down a notch. Maybe I actually do like this style.","KeefD","Sep 08, 2010"

I 've mentioned in other reviews of the style that I am of the opinion that many of these beers either come across as simply being pumpkin pie spices or being very squashy without finding a nice balance or allowing it to still have solid roots as a beer.

The toasting might be a bit much and the pumpkin, which was readily apparent in the nose, might be a bit subdued. MF is good with moderate heft and moderate carbonation, nothing remarkable either way, though I felt the carbonation to be coarse. I liked drinking this one, and as with most Sam Adams beers, it's sessionable.","LordAdmNelson","Aug 30, 2010"

3.77,8.6,3.5,4,4,3,3.5,"d 3.5-4 drinkable in an inoffensive, rather than addictive, way. middle of the road, yes, but amongst pumpkin ales (which often go overboard on spice or are flawed in some other major way) it's far better than middle of the pack. still, i'm not exactly heartbroken that you can't buy this on its own (at least not yet).","brewmudgeon","Aug 30, 2010"
3.98,14.7,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Kind of a copper/mahogany color with a pretty fluffy off-white head after an aggressive pour. The pumpkin is a bit subdued in the nose, but there is a lot of spiciness. The pumpkin is much more apparent on the tongue. This tastes just like pumpkin pie. Lots of nutmeg and allspice along with just enough sweetness to mimic that pie flavor. I'm not usually a fan of pumpkin beers, but this is really good. Drinkability is at a high level as well.","alkemy","Aug 29, 2010"
3.26,-6.1,4,3,3,4,3.5,"Transparent reddish amber in body topped by off-white head that stays and leaves lacing. Spice overload, nutmeg, mild clove, gingerbread, caramel in the nose. Gingerbread, pumpkin spice focusing on cinnamon, nutmeg, a rush of sweetness towards the finish. Light in body with medium carbonation. A sweet-toothed fall seasonal that represents the style well but way too sweet.","JRed","Aug 28, 2010"

3.84,10.7,4.5,3,4,4.5,4,"A nice medium brown to mahogany color. Creamy, off-white head that lasts. Thick, frothy lacing all around. The aroma has adequate pie spice, not much pumpkin. Taste is much better. Good sweetness really brings out the pumpkin flavor, which mixes nicely with the spices. Medium body from the sweetness. Definitely one of the better pumpkin ales I've tried.","goldbot","Aug 28, 2010"
3.95,13.8,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Pours a crystal clear, beautiful caramel/copper color with a somewhat dense khaki colored head that settles into a light cap. Very nice pumpkin spice aroma; allspice, nutmeg and cinnamon all present. There is some brown sugar and actual pumpkin scents as well. Not overly spicy, has a solid earthy aroma. Taste is like a pumpkin pie and by that I mean it actually has pumpkin flavor do it to go with the spice. It is not a spicy amber ale. With that said, the flavor is of an earthy pumpkin/gourd flavor with brown sugar & caramel sweetness. The spice profile is not very strong; allspice seems to standout and some nutmeg. The malt has a very light lemony flavor. The beer has a moderate body with soft carbonation which gives it a smooth feel; mostly sweet but finishes with a slight lemon tartness. Good balance. This is a very nice pumpkin ale. Extremely balanced, not too spicy, noticable pumpkin flavor, smooth feel, quite good. Lets hope this one sticks around.","Gmann","Aug 27, 2010"
3.75,8.1,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Look this isn't as bad as some versions but it's still a pumpkin ale, it actually has that pumpkin pie finish to it. Between the malts and the spices added in, this also says brewed with pumpkin. Darker than most versions a dark mahogany almost brown ale appearance with tight bubbled moccha tan head. Fine lacing spreads nicely between sips on the sides of my chalice. Nose has some serious pumpkin pie action kicking, between nutmeg and cinnamon with all spice and canned pumpkin candy sweetness. Pretty good especially considering the mouthfeel which was a bit harsh with spice bitterness in the back of the throat carbonation works and medium to light bodied flows decently enough. Drinkability overall is rather good for this style of beer, especially considering I'd never thought of Sam Adams as a pumpkin ale type of brewer.","WVbeergeek","Aug 27, 2010"

3.58,3.2,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,3,"T- This is slightly above average for me as far as pumpkin ales go. Its quite nice. A real surprise. Spices are toned back from what the nose would suggest. Nutmeg being the strongest. Pumpkin is there and lends a sweetness that is very welcome. Hops seem to play a bigger part here. They work with the spices to make this a very spicy and earthy beer. As sweet as this beer is from time to time, it finishes fairly bitter.","MbpBugeye","Aug 26, 2010"

3.66,5.5,4,3,4,3,4,"Overall not a bad brew. Reminds me of fall, with its color and slight pumpkin taste. Because of its balance and subtlety this is actually one of the better pumpkin brews that I have tried. It doesn't try to do too much and for some that may be a turn off. It's a fairly light beer that doesn't go too far, I would definitely drink this again.","Jsnyd05","Aug 25, 2010"

3.87,11.5,3.5,4,4,3,4,"Pours a really nice orange brown color with a pillowy off white head. The retention is minimal but the head recedes to a white cap throughout the session. The aroma is deep roasted pumpkin, nutmeg and cloves. Has a nice brown sugar and cinnamon component that is very nice. The taste is very attractive and promotes all the aromatics into the flavor profile with the addition od candied Ginger. This gives it a rich spiciness that also lightens up the beer. Mouthfeel is off for me because it's over carbonated and not super smooth like most pumpkin beers are. Drinkability is high again on this brew because it's very tasty. Abv according to the website is 5.7% and it's not totally hidden, but integrated well into the beer. Overall it's a very pumpkin beer.","Augustiner719","Aug 23, 2010"

Still nothing I'll be searching out in the future!","whiplash3825","Aug 22, 2010"
4.32,24.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Mahogany color, beige head with some nice lacing. Alluring aroma of a freshly baked pumpkin pie, cinnamon, vanilla, and nutmeg. Outstanding taste of sweet malts and spices, pecans and PUMPKIN. A solid medium-bodied brew with good carbonation. I love this time of year when all the fall seasonal brews come out. They tend to be much thicker and have more complex characteristics than most of the watered down summer beers.","828beagle","Aug 21, 2010"
4.33,24.8,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"12oz bottle purchased as part of this year's Fall mix-pack. Pours a deep crystal-clear dark copper with nearly an inch of off-white head that dissipates rather quickly. Pumpkin pie spice shares the aroma equally with caramel and bready malt and a hint of pumpkin. Tastes like pumpkin pie spice with caramel and toasty malt notes to balance and just a hint of pumpkin. On the fuller side of medium-bodied with ample but not overwhelming carbonation. Extremely drinkable. As far as Pumpkin ales go, this one is a bit ahead of the middle of the pack. It's not a spice-bomb, it's not overly slick or vegetal. This one is smooth and balanced - not in your face with the flavor, nor is it simplistic or subdued. Very good. Glad to see this in the new fall pack!","MrHurmateeowish","Aug 20, 2010"
4,15.3,4,4,4,4,4,"D - Another quaff-able offering from Sam Adams. This one is subtly spiced and not overly sweet which is very nice to me.

Nice scent, a slight sweet maltiness with the barest hint of spice, and with a wonderful gourd-like sweetness. Very nice taste, a nice malty beer with a bit of spice to make up for low hops, but a very nice pumpkin flavor that's not overstated and not cloying like some can be; this is not a pumpkin pie pumpkin ale, thank goodness, but a wonderful ale with pumpkin attributes. Goes down very nicely and will make a great fall beer if they'd release it in six packs or cases, instead of two per fall specialty pack.","JamesS","Aug 17, 2010"
