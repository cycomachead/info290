Great looking brew. Aromas of pumpkin, candied sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, bubblegum, and toasted grains. Very rich, but avoids any heaviness in the nose. Flavors are roast forward, with a rich, tangy caramel and toffee blend leading a roast pumpkin character and a healthy kick of booze. Very rich throughout, and there are hints of chocolate throughout the palate, as well. The spices fall a bit out of focus, allowing the rich, sweet, and heavy characteristics to run rampant on the tongue. Heavy, on a smooth, mid-body, with a tangy sweet and rich aftertaste. This one stays strong throughout, even into the slightly cloying, slightly boozy finish. Slight warming as you drink. Solid flavors, big beer.","GarthDanielson","Oct 31, 2013"

The only thing going for it is its unusual appearance--a dark brown color with a beautiful red thrown in there too and a head that displays fairly poor retention. From there, things go down hill. The smell consists of roasted malt and pumpkin, with the malt distracting rather than complimenting the pumpkin. In the taste, the roasted malt, pumpkin, alcohol, and spices just don't work and leave a bittersweet mess. A cross between a porter and a pumpkin ale may have sounded good on paper, but I found this disappointing and one of the worst tasting pumpkin ales I've had despite the nice appearance and mouthfeel.","DeFaz","Beers"

Some are way overdone to the point where we must ask ourselves if they are beer at all or are they liquefied pumpkin pie? And then there is The Fear: A perfectly balanced pumpkin ale that is deceptively smooth and delightfully drinkable despite the 9% ABV.

However, things get better as beer has warm spicy mouthfeel, but individual spices don't stand out and overwhelm...I think cinnamon, coriander, nutmeg? Has an almost gummy consistency as you drink it down. Hides the high ABV well; you know something is there, but the monster doesn't exactly jump out of the bushes, you know what I mean? Tastes better as you go-although there's a bit of an acidic aftertaste. All in all, very good as a onesie; don't know about multiples.","GlenRockJohnZ","Aug 26, 2013"

Mouthfeel and body are a little off, the usual nutmeg and allspice and cinnamon tastes, but the alcohol is very prominent and just doesn't seem well balanced.

The main thing that stands out in, or maybe I should say Jumps out, of this Pumpkin Ale for me is the extreme spice received when washing it down. I personally enjoy it, and the slightly higher alcohol content helps make it something more special and provides a pre-winter warming bite to it. It has delightful mouth feel, very frothy and sort of thick, coats the inside of your mouth with all that autumn spice. I drank this with a Pumpkin whoopie Pie from Whole Foods and I tell you, the combination of the pumpkin dessert washed down by the Fear was so delightful I almost keeled over with joy! I think this is one of the BEST pumpkin beers to drink with pumpkin related desserts (cookies, pound cakes, pumpkin butter battered croissants)seriously, drink this one with your favorite pumpkin sweets!","MrOzNthePumpKings","Sep 27, 2012"

3.5,-4.6,4,4,3.5,3,3,"A spice bomb of a beer that doesn't taste bad but is in desperate need of depth and subtlety. Pours a very dark brown with a tan head with good retention. Aromas are equal parts roasty, spicy, and pumpkin-packed. The taste, however, beats you over the head with spices. How much cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves can your mouth stand in a single sip? If it weren't for the redemptive roastiness and burst of black licorice that lingers on the immediate finish, I'd consider its flavor to be """below average.""" Fifteen minutes later, my mouth still tastes like I just smoked a pack of Djarum Blacks (clove cigs). As a non-smoker, I don't consider this an endearing quality.","droomyster","Nov 01, 2011"

The aggressive spicing was needed to keep the bold character of this brew in check. While I really appreciate the opportunity to give this one a try, it wasn't easy to finish the full 12oz.

The cask condition tones it down somewhat, but this is still a clove and vanilla driven seasonal from FD.
