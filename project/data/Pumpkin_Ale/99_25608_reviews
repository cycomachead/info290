"Not bad but not great not as much flavor as u would expect I love pumpkin beers and this one is not that great, it's not bad but I wouldn't buy it again."

"Overall:  This is a decent pumpkin beer, but it’s not great either.  I’m not putting in on my list of pumpkin beers to get next year, but if it was offered, I’d certainly not turn it down either."
"Great choice if your looking for a pumpkin with less ABV and not an overwhelming pumpkin taste"
"Pumpkin as Pumpkin does. An this one does well. An i have tried them all. Well all that I can get in these parts.  I like it"
"One of the better, albeit thin pumpkin ales around, this one has a nicer pumpkin cream flavor to it without being a spice bomb."

"Saranac's is a pumpkin ale perfectly suited to those who drink the trends but maybe aren't so sure how they feel about the style in general. It's exceptionally mild and minimal, even as far as entry-level versions go, almost as if it were designed for children's consumption. There's such an anemic amount of grain and spices you'd think the brewery was under wartime rations. More trick than treat."

"Awesome pumpkin"

"Overall, my impression of Saranac Pumpkin Ale is quite favorable, and it might even be the second biggest pleasant surprise of the season (the first being the much maligned Wolaver's Organic Pumpkin Ale earning the GOLD MEDAL at the 2014 GABF amongst 52 competing entries, despite the dismal ratings here on BA). Lots of great Pumpkin Ales out there that don't even make it into the 80s for ratings, add Saranac to the list."

"Can really taste the pumpkin in this - it's a good thing."
""
""
""
"O - This is not a good pumpkin beer because it's not a good base beer.  Adding pumpkin flavor to a bad beer just creates a bad pumpkin beer.  I've not had any other offerings from Saranac, but I think these folks would be better off not brewing a pumpkin beer."

"One of those run of the mill pumpkin beers. You can find it in most places in the east coast but that doesn't mean you would put start fantasy pumpkin beer roster.  It's more of a third tier flex option if you had to drink it because your main beers weren't  refrigerated.  It's a dark brown, hoppy at the start and finish.  Not much lacing but spices are present throughout without the sweetness.  Drink it of its on special and if you need a 6 pack for under $10 maybe grab it otherwise steer clear ."
"Enjoyable, not a go-to beer though."

"Pours orange amber, cl;ear, lager bubbles floating upwards. Creamy head of off white foam that lasted.  Nose is cinnamon, ginger, biscuit, clove, breaddy allspice. Some pumpkin, not a lot, light caramel and faint hops.  Taste is watery and thin, not too sweet. Cracker malt and moderate ticklish carbonation. Cinnamon, ginger faint pumpkin and a touch of hops in the lingering dry finish. Grass, dry biscuit and no slickness in the mouthfeel at all.  Spices tame a bit as the beer warms and then the watery finish lets the flavor fade a bit too quickly.;   Not great and needs a bit more flavor."

"Just not a big fan of any of the beers from this company, there are tons better pumpkins on the market for the money, pass this one by"
""
""
"Got this in a 32 oz jug bottle love the pumpkin kick after you get a smooth ale taste"
""
"Better than I think it get's credit for. Appearance is a dark brown with a tan head that fizzes away quickly. The smell is pumpkin although a little subtle, with allspice and nutmeg on the nose. The taste is more spice than pumpkin and the mouthfeel is a little thin for me. But for the price I thought it was a very nice value for what it is."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a pretty good beer with deep roasted malts and spices but it fails as a pumpkin ale.  If you make a pumpkin ale, pumpkin should be at the top of your list of ingredients.  Still it is not a complete loss."
""
"good beer. Nose has the cinnamon and spices that are usually present with a pumpkin ale.. Color is very nice clear orange-deep yellow hue. good head. the spices are predominant and outdo the pumpkin. The beer is rather light and the carbonation is fantastic."

"Overall, pretty average, but glad to be getting back into the season and looking forward to some other offerings. I think this would be good to have at a party where everyone's not going to be real picky, and this'd probably be a good choice for a pumpkin keg. It's refreshing and probably really palatable for a lot of people, just don't expect to be wowed by it if you're looking for something more distinct."

"DATE TASTED: October 25, 2013 ... GLASSWARE: Wychwood pint... OCCASION: unwinding with some pre-Halloween pumpkin!... APPEARANCE: opaque autumn-brown body with a thin off-white head--but zero lacing?!... AROMA: distinct pumpkin waft and lightly toasted malts that take precedent over the pumpkin; spices are soft, subdued...PALATE: slightly warming, medium-bodied balanced ale that sits well in the throat; inoffensive but not impressive...TASTE: malty; solidly built with a slightly suggestive pumpkin/spice flavor--modestly autumnal...OVERALL: Situated among other pumpkin bombers and October brews, this beer finds itself slightly below the competition, if only because it offers little truly memorable qualities...not a bad thing, just not much of a thing like waiting for the Great Pumpkin instead of trick-or-treating..."
""
""
"Overall: Not much to say about this one. It wasn't very expensive from what I remember, so I'm not disappointed by the price vs quality of this beer. But I wouldn't recommend to anyone it or buy it again. Had some good quality pumpkin beers this year, this one might be the worst or second to worst, battling with Pumpkick from New Belgium."
""
""
""
"I was excited to try this selection for the Halloween season. I was very disappointed. I poured bottle into a glass. I could not taste pumpkin or any other spices at all! It was as if I were drinking a bad Rolling Rock. Would not recommend this to my friends."
""
""
""
"Poured a slightly cloudy amber/orange color with a small white head that leaves good lacing. Smell is an absolutely amazing combination of pumpkin and ginger. Taste is a good combination of fall spices. I can taste the cinnamon and ginger spices coming through. Had nice balance though, spices are not overpowering, not sweet or bitter...nice balance. Medium/light bodied. The aftertaste is where the pumpkin flavor kicks in. Great beer for Halloween Night!"

""
""
""
""
"O: This is my second pumpkin ale I enjoyed it plus I liked the 32oz jug it came in. I probably wont get this agin, but only because there are so many pumpkin beers and so little time. I recommend trying this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"this pumpkin ale is ok. i went on a little pumpkin ale shopping spree and picked up several. i chose to drink this one first cause it was a huge 32oz bottle. the color is nice a slightly dark amber the smell has just a touch of pumpkin spice. the taste- too has just a touch of spices. i think this would be a good pumpkin beer for someone just beginning to cross the bridge from mainstream light beer into the craft beer world."

"The mouthfeel is light-medium bodied. It washes down rather quickly and easily and leaves very little residue. Finishes slightly dry."

"Good """utility""" pumpkin ale! For a beer to have on a regular basis during the fall and for your less """beer advocate""" guests this is a great pick."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A solid pumkpkin ale. They aren't really my style, but this is a pretty good representation. Not overly sweet, but slightly sweet like a pumpkin ale should be. This is a fall beer, and for what it is, it's pretty good. Not outstanding, but again, a good fall beer that could be greatly enjoyed in a late-season round of golf."

"Overall it was very disappointing. I had this beer last year and remember looking forward to it this year, especially after having Saranac's shandy this summer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
" This is an okay brew. The smell is decent enough; almost like a spice nut bread. However, the taste is quite watery and has a skunky aftertaste. The most redeemable quality was that it came in a very nice, old-style quart jug. That was worth it. I'll still get it again next year...though I wouldn't if it was year-round."
"Would likely work fine to quaff a few on a nice fall day, decent to try with a newbie getting into better beer...but there are plenty of better pumpkin beers out there"
""
""
"Tastes light and spicy. It's not full-bodied but close, a little too loosely constituted. The aftertaste is bitter and there's too much cinnamon. The mouthfeel is lacking. Smells like cinnamon and pumpkin, which is okay, but it's somewhat artificial. Overall, it's not bad, but there's much better out there."

"I think pumkpin ales, like any other beer that employs a non-traditionalist style, comes with some caveats. Like any beer that comes with a sweet taste or a spicy taste assumes only a few can be consumed before you sense of taste is overwhelmed and you need to switch. I think that holds true for the pumpkins. But of the pumpkins, this is one of the best, if not the best. Along with Smuttynose and Long Trail, I think these are best you can get. Its relatively smooth, great smell, good taste (great for a pumpkin), and has some flexiblity. What I mean, is a great mix drink to make with this beer is the traditional autumn drink of Makers Mark, Saranac Pumpkin, and Warm Apple Cider. Try it, you will thank me."

"Overall: Really disappointed by this beer. A bit darker than expected. Smell was exactly what i'd expect but nothing spectacular. Tastewise this beer just doesn't cut it at all. Mouthfeel just confirms the taste being sub par."
""
"Light copper amber color with decent head and moderate carbonation. Clove, vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg and especially pumpkin notes in the aroma. The notes in the aroma are reflected in the taste. Very balanced. Not heavy or too light. The very many flavor notes aren't overpowered by the malt, hops, or alcohol. This year is our favorite brew of this beer yet. Finishes with more flavor and less alcohol. Cheers!"

"the classic pumpkin beer to me. in upstate new york, this beer signals that the season is here. a pours of rich coppery orange, nearly red in color, with a just off white lacey head. the nose is the perfect mix of pumpkin and spice, some clove, vanilla, cannamon, and allspice. flavor starts off with mellow spice and a lot of the pumpkin pie flavors, but not too much sugar. it moves to an english malty fruit bread sort of middle, and a nice heavier sweeter spice in the finish. this is the pumpkin beer i grew up on, and for that i will always love it. never too sweet, never too spicy, just balanced. lighter mouthfeel for what it is, and just right medium carbonation. this is a very sessionable pumpkin brew, and definitely on of the better ones on offer anywhere. i think it is grossly underrated here on BA."
""
""
""
"Food match: Apart from the obvious pumpkin pie this brew would also suit festive foods like roast turkey with cranberry sauce, yams (roasted sweet potatoes), stuffing, sweet corn and squash."
""
"Overall this is an easy drinking pumpkin beer made for the masses."
"The aroma is very good. The flavor on the other hand has some misses. It's not bad but it's not great. I would definitely drink this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Glad to see some pumpkin beers land in oz. Ive only had one other pumpkin to compair this to (Gage roads) But this beer seemed to lack any trace of the core ingredent PUMPKIN! But to be fair its not bad. It finishs clean with a nice yeastyness. If only i could get other pumpkin beers here."
""
"Overall: I actually like this beer - I don't love it - but it may be one of Saranac's best. I'm sure there is no pumpkin in here, but this hits the mark on several of the attributes I look for in a pumpkin beer."
""
""
""
"Overall, this barely deserves to be called a pumpkin ale. There is hardly any spice. It is more like an amber with a ton of off flavors. The tartness is bad and it is really just very muddled. Not worth the time seeking out."
"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a clear, copper-amber coloring that is bright and vibrant, with a sparse touch of off-white film on the surface. Aromas of cinnamon and nutmeg, with a smooth, malty sweet backbone. Well balanced nose. Flavors are rich and spicy, with a smooth and sweet pumpkin backbone supporting the cinnamon, nutmeg, and other harvest spices that blend and highlight the brew. Roasty and earthy tones make this beer a touch more dynamic on the palate. Roasty, richly sweet aftertaste leading to a smooth, slightly spiced finish that is clean and sharp. The body is a bit light for all of the flavors, but the beer is decent overall. Tasty seasonal brew!"
""
""
""
"Mouthferl is a bit light and watery, medium bodied, smooth, and medium carbonation. I am overall pleasantly happy with this. Even though it does not compare with others, the generic flavors of most pumpkin beers don't kill you on this one."
"When i poured thsi beer into a pint glass, it had a nice light copper color body with a nice couple of inches light tan color foamy head, that hangs out for a good while. The smell is of clove and cinnamon. The taste has the spices but doesn't have any pumpkin flavor to it. The mouth feel is a little weak for me and overall i'm not impressed and i think it is ok but i won't be getting this one again."
""
""
""
""
""
"There's something different from the first sip. A bitterness not typically found in pumpkin ales. The pumpkin flavor seems a little watered down. There's spices in there, but they don't seem to work too well together. At least it does have a distinct taste. Overall it's a good beer, just not a great pumpkin ale."
"Overall this is a decently good pumpkin ale here. I wish the pumpkin flavor was more noticeable, but the spices made up for its limited presence. Not bad to find on draft but I won't seek it out yearly."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The smell and mouthfeel were off-putting to me. The beer was nothing special to look at, and the taste was only mildly worth it. I've had much better pumpkin ales."
""
"Overall – An alright pumpkin brew. It is on the slightly drier side with an easy drinking flavor profile."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Decent pumpkin brew. Good flavors and aromas. Not my favorite pumpkin beer but worth a try."
"O - better than what I remember it being when I first tried it a few years ago."
""
"O- this one keeps a creamy layer of head throughout the drink, but nothing stands out in terms of taste. Can't really pick out any real pumpkin flavor. Still worth trying."
""
""
""
"Taste is malty with tons of spicing, seems very similar to most of the pumpkin beers available with nothing to distinguish it from the pack, body is decent with a soft but active carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Lightly toasted, caramel-y malt notes up front. Vegetal, gourdy flavor moves in but is tempered by sweetish pie filling and sugary crust notes. Nutmeg and clove finish off the palate. Lingering caramel and cooked vegetables. Moderate body with a slightly fizzy feel. Not bad."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Good beer, for four dollars it might be a great friend. Keep the bottle it comes in and you have half a growler (seriously). I had it after a long day of painting and just hit the spot, Salud!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A subtle pumpkin ale that is a change of pace from the spice-forward fall beers. Overall pretty good."
"O: Easy to drink due to the light flavors of pumpkin and spices but does not stand out to me."
""
""
""
"surprisingly though for the very cheap price, the beers not that bad. Nose of pumpkins and faint allspice. Light mouthfeel with brisk carbonation. The taste of cheap adjuncts up front followed by some genuine pumpkin flavor and light spices, cinnamon and allspice. Semi-sweet with pretty decent balance. All in all one of the few decent saranac brews out there. It's nowhere near as good as most pumpkin beers ought to be but does give some of the pricier lighter pumpkin brews such as brooklyns and sam adams a run for their money."
""
"O: well, I was kinda beginning to worry as I purchased the fall variety pack and was getting through these beers as I wasn't too into any of these other than what I've already had from previous purchases. However, this one is way better than some of the others in the Saranac Autumn pack. This is a good pumpkin that I would come back to. Everything is combined right, solid for a pumpkin."
""
"O: Nothing really jumps out at me as being impressive about the smell or taste of this beer but it is quite easy to drink. This might make for a good pumpkin beer to try for someone who is just getting into craft beers and might get turned off by stronger flavors of pumpkin or spices."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Im a little disappointed in this beer as I came into it with the expectation that it would at least be better than average compared to some of the other beers I have tried. I do actually get a bit of pumpkin in the aftertaste but the balance of spices is not there. The beer isnt bad and I could drink a couple without much problem, but for a go to Pumpkin Ale, I will need to go elsewhere."
""
"Dark amber orange color, mild spice aroma and nice head.  Excellent balanced smooth flavor with plenty of real pumpkin flavor and malt, lightly spiced with pleasant aftertaste of mostly pumpkin.  An easy drinking, low ABV pumpkin that is consistent every year."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A rather lackluster pumpkin ale overall. Barely any of the spices that remind you of pumpkin pie, not even any malt or hop profile, just a light pumpkin. Not bad, just not memorable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Nice foamy head and a fantastic aroma. Some may dislike the fact that the pumpkin and spice flavor is minimized compared to other beers, whereas I actually prefer it. It is extremely drinkable, which the plethora of empty bottles on my stoop can attest for. I'll probably be buying another case very soon before the season is out. By no means my absolute favorite beer, but for the price and the taste it's one of my favorite seasonals going! Give it a try"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Absolutely, hands down my favorite seasonal. No questions or debates. Rich amber color, a bit of haze, and a nice foam. Smell the pumpkin! The pumpkin is quite pronounced in this ale. The spices play a secondary role to the pumpkin. Malts, hops, all come secondary to the pumpkin. The taste... wow! Sweet, smoothe, a bit thick, creamy,... did I mention pumpkin? I could go on and on about this beer, but you need to try it if you are remotely interested in autumn-style beer. It's not for everybody, I will say that. But to those who it is for, you won't want the season to end."

""
""

"O. It's kind of plain. Not much there for what I want out of a pumpkin."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"overall though... they advertise a pumpkin ale, you get a pumpkin ale with this. just a little depressed with the spicing, to pumpkin ratio."
""
""
""
""
"Poured a clear dark brown into pilsner glass. Fine off-white head. Very light scent of pumpkin and spices present, again wish there were a bit more. Tastes similar to others of the Saranac brand. There's a slight bit of pumpkin and spices in the back; not as much as I'd like. Mouthfeel is a bit watery, fairly light, mild carbonation. This beer is definitely more drinkable than it's counterparts (in volume), but I would prefer the alternative."
""
""
""
"O – Good drinkability and a nice flavor profile, but low on the pumpkin that I’m looking for."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Although it was too spicy for me, this beer comes with my usual comments about Saranac; namely, that it's not too bad for the price."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I was expecting more from a pumpkin ale. The style is hard to find in my area and when I do find them they seem to disappoint. This is a decent brew and worth a try. I was just wanting more pumpkin flavor than what this brought. I do love the pumpkin ale style."
""
""
"O - Slightly above average pumpkin ale but a bit too watery. I would not recommend it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is a bit sweet for my tastes, which hurts drinkability, but otherwise, it's an OK light pumpkin beer."
"O: Not a bad beer, but nothing really stands out about it. It smells nice, but is otherwise fairly bland without being too offensive."
"Overall: decent pumpkin ale. Good balance of spice and malt unlike other pumpkin ales where I feel like im drinking eggnog or pumpkin cyder"
"Overall this is a nice pumpkin beer, it gives you anise pumpkin pie experience without going overboard with the pumpkin or sweetness. Needs a little more body and it would be a much better beer."
"Overall- Saranac is on to something with this combo of flavors, unfortunately this could be better crafted. Pump up the mouth feel and give the flavor profiles a boost."
"O: Overall not a very bad Pumpkin ale, good ABV and nice flavors makes this on pretty good.. Worth looking for in October."
"O: Well, this beer varied with each sip. It was really inconsistent. My first sip was very unpleasently bitter (not in the good way) as if there was some burnt flavor going on in it. On the otherhand, as the drink progressed, the sweet roasted pumpkin worked its way to the forefront. So this was just Ehh.. great aromas though!"
"Sort of middle of the road. It's not bad but it's too impressive either. Another generic entry to this category, lacking any particular trait that would make it stand out. It's not too heavy handed with the spice rack but that is the predominant flavor."
" Overall I think this beer is well balanced and easy to drink. Great fall style taste and something I would like to have again."
"Poured light brown with an orange hue. There was no appreciable head to speak of, but the pumpkin and cinnamon aroma was a nice touch. The taste was malty with a muted pumpkin flavor. There was also some pie spice present in the finish. Overall, this is not as adventurous as some of the imperials of this style. However, this is a solid pumpkin ale to enjoy on a cool fall day."
"Overall - Interesting beer to try in the efforts of seeking the penultimate pumpkin beer, but I'd call this a fall harvest rather than a true pumpkin ale"
"Not half bad, perhaps not at beery as I was hoping for. The spice does not get annoying at all and there is enough malt flavor to keep things interesting."
"Pours a orangish amber color with a one finger head. The aroma is of caramel malts, cinnomon, nutmeg. There is not a pumpkin presence here that I can really find. The taste has a caramel malt start with brown sugar also. The middle has a faint pumpkin and cinnomon taste. There is a slight metallic tang at the very end of the beer. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated. Overall it was an okay pumpkin beer, it was more rounded than what I expected. It seemed like the pumpkin taste was subdued and missing from the aroma."
"Morey's Bottom Line: Would be a good introduction to the style. Smooth and not overly spiced. A good beer...but there are other Pumpkin Ales that are superior to this one IMO."
"Poured into a standard pint glass. This beer is a deep amber color with a creamy, bubbly head that dissipates into a thin film. There is virtually no lacing whatsoever. The mouth feel is watery and carbonated -- very much in the same vein as a typical mass-produced adjunct lager. The taste is underwhelming. Nothing really stands out. Yes, obviously there are typical spice notes, all the usual suspects here: nutmeg, clove, allspice, pumpkin spice ... Overall this beer is not terrible, I've had worse this year, but nothing stands out. It tastes like a lot of other mediocre pumpkin ales this year. I would recommend trying one bottle of this if you're going to buy several other pumpkin ales, but a 6 pack of this is too much of a been-there-done-that pumpkin ale experience."
"Not sure what I expected when I purchased this, but I think overall it's a nice drinking pumpkin beer with not a lot of kick or spice like others. Would be easy to drink a few of these on a nice chilly Fall day while watching football. Does have a nice smell and color to it, but does lack the real """pumpkin pie""" taste in my opinion. Nonetheless, good beer and not too expensive either!"
"For Saranac this is good. It's a little heavy on the carbonation and the overall flavor profile is thin and mild, but with all around balance."
"This was a very pleasant pumpkin ale that didn't go overboard with the spices. I also found it nice that there wasn’t an artificial pumpkin flavor that so many pumpkin ales seem to have. Nothing spectacular, but a solid brew nonetheless."
"Pours a clear amber, whitish head soon rings. Smell is syrup and spices. Bit of pumpkin, lot of clove, bit of vanilla. Weird blend, ends up tasting like cola or Dr. Pepper. Finishes tight and dry. Interesting, more spices than pumpkin."
"Poured a reddish copper, produces only a thin head (almost none really). Leaves behind a collar and an extremely thin film. Nose has some pumpkin crust, pumpkin and related spicing (ginger and allspice). Minimal cinnamon, yet the label suggests it to be prominent. Taste follows the nose is more subdued fashion, yet still some retained bread/crusty notes. Some spice as per the nose, more cinnamon this time around and some allspice. Watery body, just a tad thicker than water in that regard. Spicing lingers for a bit. Needs more body surely. An OK offering, but didn't have enough in terms of body for my liking. Approximates but never fully achieves the pumpkin pie, offering really only crust and spiced notes."
"O: Pretty middle of the road for me. Not bad, nothing special. The cinnamon was too strong here for me."
"D - An average pumpkin beer. It's mostly just holiday spices and bread, however. Not horrible by any means, but not impressive either. It has decent drinkability but overall not something I would purchase again."
"Ok, this is a amber colored beer. The smell is very strong in cinnamon smell. As for taste this is very strong with cloves, to strong, it takes over the beer. Mouth is ok and acceptable. Over all we feel the spices take away from this beer overall. Nice beer with out the spice, but then again with out the spice it would not be a pumpkin ale with out the spice. Enjoy if it is your type of beer."
"Pours the same brown shade as it's bottle! Small white froth I can't bring myself to call a head that dies off almost instantly!No lacing. Smells malty not pumpkin or spice. The taste is ok, but dissapointing on the pumpkin/almost a bit like seltzer!"
"Got this in a 12 beers a fallin'. Best by January 2012. Poured into my Newcastle Geordie Schooner. Copper amber color with thin head and not much lacing. Aroma was pumpkin pie spice and a tiny bit of pumpkin. Taste was mostly malt, a tiny bit of spice and even less pumpkin. In general a nice basic ale with a bit of spice. Easy drinking and not too complicated."
"Clear and copper. A lot of carbonation on this one. The cap popped off with a lot of force. Small amount of thin, big bubbles that were gone as fast as the appeared. Thin nose. Small notes of sweet bread, cinnamon and pumpkin pie. The pumpkin pops out more in the flavor. The malt body is light and the flavor is dominated by a pungent pumpkin spice that leaves a sharp note on your palette. Dry with a carbonation bite for the finish. So many pumpkins out there my money is better spent elsewhere."
"O-I think the first review benefited from """First Pumpkin Ale of the Season Syndrome""" The Saranac was easily the worst of the nine beer line up."
"Drinkability: I actually enjoyed this beer, and usually Saranac products are sometimes boring with the exception of some of the rarer stuff, yet this pumpkin beer is different. It's got nice spice notes that aren't over the top, it's drinkable, and it's cheap. My only gripe is the overuse of vanilla in the actual flavor here, in the aroma it's very satisfying, yet when I taste more vanilla over taste of pumpkin and/or spice - it gets to be a bit much. Yet overall, a well crafted pumpkin beer I will seek again throughout the fall months."
"For at least a few sips, this could substitute for a pumpkin pie. Just a kiss of hops and caramel malts that remind you that its beer. Cinnamon and allspice play off each other nicely, and pumpkin rounds out all the flavors in a nice, albeit subtle way. After a few sips though, the pumpkin and spices start blending together into not much else than a malt forward beer with a hint of pumpkin spices on the front side. The pumpkin and pleasant spices definitely lose their punch as your palate assimilates to them, making for a somewhat dissapointing amount of flavor. A light body and easy finish don't accomplish much for the style. Still, there is some really nice flavor to behold, and while this may not be the best pumpkin beer I've had this year, it still has some things going for it."
"Overall - My second pumpkin beer and this one was very nice. Enjoyable for a cool fall day!!"
"O - This was just another average Pumpkin Ale for me...the pumpkin stood out more than the spices...but it did have a nice malt bill"
"O: Great witches brew with a lot of soul. Hey, Sam Adams, this is what these beers are supposed to taste like."
"Overall not bad, pumpkin is kept at a good level, no heavy spices, nice malt profile, just way to sticky and syrupy."
"Overall - this beer is a revelation after my unfortunate introduction into pumpkin ales with Shipyard's Pumpkinhead (my first """F"" rating, ever). As I mentioned in the taste, the pumpkin is not drowned in over-aggressive spicing and it's assertive enough to overcome the malt flavor. This beer definitely restored my faith in pumpkin ales, and makes me much more excited to brew my own version of it next week!"
" O : I do like the fall beers my friends and this could be a session beer for alot a people. Might to need to have it with some food and so what it brings."
"Refreshing? Yes, easy to drink. Just something I wouldn't have with a pumpkin pie"
"D: Nicely balanced, session strength, prominent yet complimentary spice, solid & well made. Hint of pumpkin could be stronger, but at least nothing is cloying or overdone. A nice change from the many high-gravity, boozy, spice bombs that hit the shelves every fall."
"I do not think I have ever had a Pumpkin beer, not being one for fruit/vegetable beers. But – this was in a 12 pack so I gave it a go. It has a delightful pumpkin/spice taste and an excellent balance to highlight that pumpkin taste. Not a big nose, but pleasant. I think it drinks clean and is a fun change. I am not sure you would want to have a six pack but to get you in the season it is a winner."
"My pour got me a finger of tawny head with good retention. Color was a deep copper with NE-plus quality clarity. I could see into the future through this beer! Nose was big with spiciness, especially cinnamon and clove, maybe even nutmeg. Boy, howdy, but I love that smell! Mouthfeel was full and creamy and the cloves really stood out in the mouth. The finish was more cinnamon in its spiciness, but the whole package reminded me of chewing a stick of Big Red gum while smoking a clove cigarette. Very tasty."
"another review from the mix six this time a pumkin ale from the fine people at matt brothers. this is also my first experience with a pumkin ale it smells wonderful like a homemade pumkin pie . the spices don't over power this beer but the finish seem to be missing something i just don't know what it is."
"Overall - I actually really enjoyed this. While I prefer beers that bring more of the natural pumpkin quality, I couldn't help but feel like I was enjoying some pumpkin pie. A quality pumpkin ale. The smell was a bit of a downer, but there was a lot of good taste and mouthfeel."
"o: Overall this was my introduction to pumpkin ales and would highly recommended for first time pumpkin ale drinkers. The spices added into the brew make it great for desserts or something to crave the sweet tooth."
"Pours a iced tea color with with a thin almost non existent lace around the head. Smells of sweet caramel, nice pumpkin spice, clove, smells like autumn. Taste is pumpkin-y, generous spice, goes down much like a lager. At the end it tends to slightly taste a bit medicinal. Light in body, sweet, creamy. Overall, well its a pumpkin beer...that tastes like pumpkin tasting stuff. Probably the best beer label out there, really catches my eye every fall."
"Bought a 6 Pack back in Fall 2007 and loved the design on the label. The beer was pretty good to start out but got kind of gross about half way through. Very strange how it took a turn for the worst once it warmed up. The aromas of spice and pumpkin are dominant. The flavor was the same way till about half way through and it started tasting very odd to me. The color was a nice amber tone with a pretty nice tan head. I drank all 6 and it didn't get much better as they went. Not sure what the deal is."
"From fall brew tasting notes (2010): Poured a nice shade of clear medium amber with a short-lived white head. The aroma picked up essence of pumpkin with a greater concentration of spice notes mostly nutmeg and cardamon; pale malts supported. The flavor found pale and caramel malt notes at the core along with some pumpkin meat.. nutmeg and cinnamon around. Picking up some sourness on the back-end. Lighter-bodied on the palate with dry, tacky spices leaving an impression on the finish. Seek better pumpkin ales."
"It's really not a bad example of the style. I was pleasantly surprised, didn't expect too much. Bold flavors! Although it falls short of Southern Tier, DFH, and Weyerbacher's efforts, if you're looking for a sessionable pumpkin fix in the fall, this will fill the void."
"Overall: It was time to clear out my fall beers before it was too late. A nice surprise from Saranac, this pumpkin beer has some nice flavor and balance. It is not as extreme as other pumpkin beers I had this fall, but that is not necessarily a bad thing (after all, it is not nearly as expensive either). This beer is a nice seasonal for a nice price; however, if you want a lot of spice, do not buy this pumpkin beer."
"Overall- a weaker pumpkin ale, which actually makes me like it better because I'm not that much of a pumpkin ale guy, but this is actually balanced and well made. Solid."
"Very good pumpkin ale, nicely done."
"It's refreshing and goes well with (surprise!) pumpkin pie and other sweet foods. Not bad on its own too. I'd sum this up as a """fun""" seasonal session brew that's good for some variety."
"Poured aggressively into a Sam Adams Summer Ale glass, clear copper, 2-finger head disappears into nothing, lacing is nowhere to be found. Aroma is less than mediocre...very soapy. Pumpkin and raisin are faint. Taste is better, with cinnamon, nutmeg, and only a little pumpkin. No aftertaste is left on the palate for long at all. Light carbonation. I would rather not drink this until next fall -- one pumpkin ale per year."
"I've got another bottle of this in the fridge and will revisit, but I think Saranac missed the mark here, or I misread what they were going for. All in, not unpleasant, just not anywhere near what I'd expect for the style. I could see some folks digging this though."
"Beer is light and spicy with a grainy aftertaste. It's mildly spicy. Eh, it's a decent beer. Not my favorite pumpkin beer but I would cautiously have it again if desperate."
"D: Spice dominates malt and pumpkin, but smooth and balanced in the finish."
"D Not that drinkable.. a little hard to put down, but interesting and refreshing to try for an October themed beer"
"12oz. bottle served in a standard pint. Pours a translucent burnt orange with a voluminous, creamy, three inch head. Head eventually settles into a solid, quarter inch cap with thick, textured swaths of lacing evident during the tasting. Nose presents a light nutmeg and allspice quality as well as a hint of citrus. Taste follows nose with the addition of a light, toasted malt character and a slightly metallic quality at the finish. Mouthfeel is somewhat watery with a lively carbonation. Somewhat subdued, relative to what I look for in the style. That being said, it is definitely not as cloying as some pumpkin beers, which allows for more than one to be consumed in a sitting."
"D - A good pumpkin beer but not one I would seek out again."
"Bought this one last night as part of a mixed six because my son wanted the bottle. Nothing special here, but a decent attempt at a pumpkin beer. Pours a clear brown color, with a little bit of head. Aromas of pumpkin pie spice (cinnamon, maybe clove) and light (very light) brown sugar. Similar on the palate, decent carbonation, light bodied, muted pumpkin pie flavors. OK, but not gonna try it again."
"O: This beer is ok. I would not buy it again. I'm not saying it's bad it's just, not my kind of beer. The spices/cinniamon remind me of a stout, but this beer is not a stout at all but, has the the audacity to put cinniamon, pumpkin, and vanilla in a smooth ale. If you gave me this beer I would drink it."
"An ok pumpkin ale, lacking a smooth malt body, and much too spicy. Probably wouldn't try it again."
"Drinkability: Despite the simple flavor, this really is a good pumpkin ale. The spices are not overbearing, and there is just enough semi-sweet cinnamon to keep the pumpkin flavor in check. Really quite good."
"Pours an orange-copper color with a white head and a bit of lace. The nose brings forward nutmeg, cinnamon, allspice, and some mildly-sweet pumpkin. The taste brings more nutmeg and allspice without as much cinnamon. Some pumpkin in the background. Medium body with good carbonation and a nice spice-to-pumpkin ratio. Drinks fairly well and isn't overly spiced or overly pumpkin-oriented, which puts it above many in the style."
"D - Leaves you feeling full and warm."
"Overall I do like this beer and enjoy drinking 2-3 sixers of it through out the fall season, but like I said at one time this beer was one of my all time favorites and was great, now I just see it as a ok to good beer. Thanks!"
"D - Lighter body and ABV lend to drinkability, but underwhelming flavor profile doesn't make me want to buy more."
"Carbonation on this beer crisps it up a bit. Wouldn't mind a smoother finish, but it's not too off-putting. Very sweet beer. The pumpkin is pretty prominent but it tastes a bit artificial. Nutmeg and cinnamon also noted. Slight bitterness on the finish that is pleasant, reminding me that this is indeed a beer. This is definitely drinkable for what it is. Not a bad autumn beer by any means. If you like pumpkin ales, give this one a try."
"Drink - A nice seasonal beer.. I'd be good with 6 of these every October."
"D - Considering the body and abundance of flavor I don't think I could have more than 2 in a session."
"D - This is a good pumpkin ale, but after drinking a bunch of Schlafly Pumpkin Ale...this one just doesn't compare."
"If you told me this was a spiced holiday ale, I would probably think it was pretty decent. As far as pumpkin ale though, it seems a bit lacking. I don't want to get too down on this beer though, since I am enjoying drinking it on this rainy and cold fall night. I would not recommend it for people looking for a good pumpkin brew."
"Pours a light reddish brown color with minimal head. Scent is somewhat bland and dominated by carmel and darker malts and spices such as clove and nutmeg. Taste brings the flavor profile of a weaker brown ale with modeate spicing, very little hint of pumpkin. Some alcohol notes present as well. Medium bodied, slighty watery at times due to lower carbonation. An average at best pumpkin beer thats more of a spiced brown ale."
"D: not the best pumpkin out there, not as enjoyable as the label lead me to think."
"I'm not sure it would be wise - from the standpoint of your aching head the next day - to go overboard on this one, but this is a great ale to enjoy as the leaves fall and we await the arrival of the Great Pumpkin."
"reddish of copper, has a thick suddsy head. HAd a pretty pleasant taste though it wasn't overly a strong flavor. Smell was of spices, taste was spicy too with a normal mild brown ale taste, it was pretty smooth and sudsy, was pretty good drinkability"
"D - Not too bad. I will likely revisit this next season as well. Probably my second favorite pumpkin beer so far."
"this is a staple pumpkin ale for me during the season. it has great drinkability, one of my favorites to session in the fall. nothing to special about this brew, but they got the basics right. fairly cheap sixer compared to most pumpkin ales out there. if you can find it, its worth giving a chance."
"Can't say I love this overall. Definitely some interesting stuff going on, but different doesn't equal good. Feels like it's missing a key component, like the center fell out. One of the weirder pumpkin beers I've had."
"If you're looking for a pumpkin ale that'll beat you over the head with pumpkin look elsewhere, but this is a very solid beer in its own right."
"Very interesting color with off white head which does not hold very long. This is certainly meant as a seasonal beer. When I smelled the beer I was not so impressed. It hints certainly pumpkin with spice but also had a very grainy feel to it. After tasting those aromas increase and actually become peasant. The aftertaste of the beer is actually great. To me this would be a slow drinking beer and little quantity of it."
"Pretty good, again not having much of the style, I will rate it average to damn good. For the price $25(again a sample pack of various Saranac),it is worth it and defintley if you can't afford better. Will buy to again to compare to other beers in the stlye."
"D - pretty good pumpkin ale here. I wish the pumpkin flavor was more noticeable, but the spices made up for its limited presence. Not bad, but I have certainly had better. Many thanks to BogleHill for sending this to St Louis for me."
"Taste: Malty pumpkins, with cloves remaining as the predominant flavor. Even so, the cloves and other spices remain mellow, with spices and a bit of vanilla gently permeating the mouth and sticking very nicely. Aftertaste really solidified this beer as a tasty fall drink."
"Overall, Saranac Pumpkin Ale seems rather toned down for pumpkin ale. While it is an easy beer to drink, and a pleasant one, there is not anything exceptional about it to really make note of. If you are looking for nice beer to drink, this is one. If you are looking for nice pumpkin ale specifically, prepare to be less than impressed."
"Its not a spice bomb, so I cant complain too much. Maybe a touch thin and a little too sweet, but overall its not bad."
"drinkability: as far as pumpkin beers go, it is definitely pleasant to drink, just more subdued than others in its category, nothing to put it down specifically, but nothing that makes it noteworthy either."
"I like pumpkin ales and I like this beer. It's very easy to drink with awesome pumpkin pie flavors and nothing much that get's in the way. It's light enough to drink a lot without being watery."
"Price = $6 at the Witherspoon Grill"
"Eric"
"Very drinkable for those special occasions, and if you like pumpkin beers you will like this one. Saranac does a good job in brewing different styles of beers. Great beer for a fall mix pack, and perhaps for any fall parties."
"D. I would not hesitate to pick up a full sixxer of this. I only got two in a fall sampler."
"This is more drinkable than say pumpking or punkin but has nowhere near as pronounced flavors. If i were to session a pumpkin ale though it'd be punkin"
"D: Quite easy to drink but only for 1-2. Not bad for a seasonal."
"Overall- I was pretty excited for this, it was my first pumpkin ale of the season. I was sorely disappointed. Not Saranac's finest showing."
"Pours a clear dark copper/light brown with a small, short-lived head. Sweet, malty aromas with strong notes pumpkin, cinnamon, and ginger. Each of these notes carry through to the taste, which is predominantly malty with a very mild, earthy bitterness. An uncomplicated, easily drinkable beer; not a bad value if you're hosting a fall party."
"This was a light pumpkin ale. It had a decent flavor, but it was very artificial. It tasted like someone took a lager and poured some pumpkin spice syrup into it. It wasn't bad, but not nearly as good as other pumpkin ales that I've had. This is one of my favorite styles of beers, and even though it's not my preference in this style, I seem to find myself drinking it more often than others in the category. I stocked up on this last fall and enjoyed them all summer. That was a good life decision."
"Light bodied and a tad over-carbonated, a bit prickly on the tongue but not unpleasant. Very drinkable and easily one of the better beers in this style. Would be great on a chilly October night."
"In spite of what I feel is """not right""" with this beer, it's not a total bust. The look is okay, if not spectacular - beer-bottle brown with an average head. It also has a decent, though bordering on watery, mouthfeel. The taste, however, all but kills the drinkability factor here. I won't be revisiting this one unless they tweak it to my specs and send me a case."
"It's pretty delicious, actually. It's like drinking a pumpkin pie, really. The sweetness and overall flavor profile probably prevents this from becoming anything I'd drink more than a couple of, but I think they accomplished their goal here."
"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle. Sampled on September 4, 2010. It pours an orange-amber with a long lasting quarter-inch silky beige head. Good lacing. The aroma is of pumpkins, spice, and a bit of brown sugar but it did not smell as fresh as it could have. The taste comes in about the same with a weak but noticeable pumpkin spice and roiasted malty character. Thinly hopped. Pleasant enough but not overwhelming."
"My first pumpkin ale. With that said, I was very disappointed at how this turned out. I don't know if my expectations were unrealistic but I expected this thing to taste like a wonderfully spiced homemade pumpkin pie. The second I popped the cap off I knew that this was not going to be the case. After pouring it had a meager head that quickly faded away into a thin ring of nano bubble around the edge of the glass. The aroma is weak, not as pronounced as I had hoped. Yeah the bottle says there is allspice, cloves, and vanilla in this but I could barely sense any of it. The first sip was a massive let down, a very low key pumpkin taste if anything at all. Mild carbonation, watery. An easy drinker."
"D/M: Crisp and clean. Easy to drink and not too heavy. Decent beer."
"D: ABV is only 5.4%. It may be one of the thinner of the great pumpkin ales, but it's definitely more sessionable."
"D - Overall it's a big change from the Smuttynose pumpkin ale since that one started semi sweet and ended bitter with hops this ale is more bitter at first then rounds out the sweetness and finishes malty. A pretty OK pumpkin ale that should keep me busy till Pumking arrives. A solid brew Saranac!"
"D: This beer starts to sit heavy after a few. You don't want to get sick off it, it could scar you for life. I would definitely go for two Saranac Pumpkin ales and a bowl of vanilla ice cream."
"The taste follows the nose quite closely. The malts in the base beer seem to steal the show, leaving the pumpkin (what the beer should be all about) fading in and out, and in the end leaving you wanting. Not bad, just a little watery and lacking in the pumkin dept. Light/medium bodied and moderately carbonated. Easy to drink, but ultimately underwhelming."
"Drinkability: Couldn't really have too many of these, but it has respectable drinkability for a pumpkin ale"
"Drinkability: Not usually impressed with Saranac but this was surprisingly good. This was not too bitter nor too sweet. The spicing was done well. As a seasonal, I could do six of these easy."
"This is always one of my highlights of the whole fall beer season. Maybe it's the bottle... The beer is more orange in color than amber and not as dark as you would think. Nice pumpkin and spice aroma that is not very strong. Has a rich taste that leaves the pumpkin on the aftertaste. I am not that crazy about the feel in that it is a little heavy bodied and will be more appreciated in October that mid august. Probably not an all day drinker, though it would be nice around the Autumnal campfire."
"Out of a bottle this beer was a copper color with one finger of beiger head that quickly became a thin collar of bubbles. The retention of the very thin collar was good but the lacing was spotty. The aroma was of pumpkins, spices, caramel malt and some musty malt. The flavors were exactly the same and perfectly fine for an ale but not very impressive for a 'harvest ale' which is supposed to be highly spiced and dynamic. Well balanced, however, and quite drinkable. The body was medium, the carbonation was a bit high and thus the mouthfeel foamy."
"Dark tawny brown brew with orange highlights. 1/2""" of ivory foam settles quickly and leaves a little lace behind. Nose of mulling spices, some starchy thickness (maybe that's the pumpkin?), mild mixed hops, a bit of dark caramel. Taste is a bit spicy (cinnamon, nutmeg, clove), balanced by mixed malts and brown sugar, with a bite of lemony hops lingering in the finish. Mouthfeel is crisp, medium bodied. Decent pumpkin ale."
"D - Very drinkable. I enjoyed it as part of the tasting but probably won't get it again due to it being somewhat bland overall."
"D- Not one of the better pumpkin ales I have had, but definitely more of an ale than anything. It isn't a bad beer by any means, I just prefer something that has more prevalent notes of spices and a better balance."
"This is a pretty decent beer. Nothing to rave about - pretty average."
"Thanks ShadesOfGray!"
"Pours to a copper color with minimal head. Smells of cinnamon, cloves, basically your average pumpkin or cinnamon all-spice. Smells like pumpkin pie. Taste isn't very pumpkin like in fact there doesn't seem to be a lot of pumpkin. It seems more like an American wheat with cinnamon."
"Pumpkin flavor comes out to play a lot more in the taste, it's pretty nice and one of the more pumpkin-y beers I have had. Spices are not as heavy as I had feared upon sniffing, but there is quite a bittering finish from a hop/spice combo. Sweetness is low and the body is on the thin side, making this a highly attenuated beer...dry and finishes relatively clean. A pretty decent pumpkin beer but perhaps a bit too heavy handed with the spices."
"I thought this was one of the better pumpkin offerings. I can detect the pumpkin in the aroma as well as the spice. Can't really taste pumpkin spice is more predominant. Allspice seems to be the dominant spice here with some cloves. The pumpkin spice is not overpowering and is very drinkable. Starts with a big head but goes to a film quickly. OK lacing. Not a bad representation."
"Drinkability: Not too shabby, definitely better options out there but it's definitely not the worst either."
"Poured from 12 ounce bottle into Unibroue tulip. Head is gone before I could even evaluate it. Aroma is of nutmeg, sweet malts, maybe some sour-ish pumpkin and some brown sugar? Taste is malty and sugary sweet with some nice """autumn""" seasonings. Smooth to drink and refreshing. Not the most memorable pumpkin beer ever but a worthwhile and tasty offering."
"The beer has a beautiful color like a copper penny. There is a bright white head of small bubbles that was quick to dissipate. The nose is all spices--perhaps nutmeg and clove. It smells like the spices you would put into a pumpkin pie. At first there isn't much pumpkin flavor, but as the beer sits in your mouth you begin to taste the spices (more so than an actual pumpkin flavor). There is some sweetness to the flavor, but it is a darker sweetness, reminiscent of molasses. It has a bit of a thinner body than I expected. It is well carbonated. It's an enjoyable drink, but two bottles would be my limit in an evening."
"[appearance: 3, smell: 4, taste: 3.5, mouthfeel: 3, drinkability: 3.5]"
"Drinkability: Definitely one of the better pumpkin ales that I have tasted this fall season."
"D - Good beer to sit back and enjoy. Couldn't imagine sessioning with it, but definitely a good way to start a night."
"Decently drinkable, but spices could mean overkill after one or two of these. Good example of what a pumpkin ale is, but there are definitely better ones out there. Dogfish Head Punkin' Ale and Brooklyn's Post Road Pumpkin Ale come to mind."
"Would I buy more of it? - Ummm...I'm going to go with no on this one."
"D: Not very tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, mild kick, not the best representation of style, there are many other beers in the style that I would go with before this one."
"That bigs up the beer hugely which then fails to deliver. It s not a bad beer but not great either"
"I'm all for trying different seasonal beers that have a distinctive personality. This one kind of blends in a bit. It's a nice dark amber color with mulling spices being prominent in the aroma and taste, pumpkin in the background. It goes down smooth and finishes with a bit of the mulling spices lingering. It's nice but it doesn't stand out much."
"A very drinkable beer and one which I will get again."
"Drinkability: Great """entry""" beer into craft beer market for a usually mass produced (miller, coors, etc.) beer drinker. Easy to drink, not over-powering"
"D- First pumpking ale that i've tried. Didn't think I'd like it, but this one is pretty enjoyable."
"D- Not a bad brew but not my favorite pumpkin ale."
"12oz bottle obtained at McKinnon's in Salem, NH. Pours a amber-brownish crystal-clear body with almost an inch of short-lived light tan head. Spices dominate the aroma, with cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice, but this aroma has just enough of the spice without being a spice-bomb. Spice hits the palate early, but gives way to butter, nut, caramel, toffee, and bready malt notes in great balance. On the heavier side of medium-bodied with moderate carbonation. A really well-done pumpkin beer - exceeds expectations. Balanced, complex but not a spice bomb only like many pumpkin beers, and there's enough other things going on in the beer to keep it interesting. Great - especially for the price!"
"Served in a pint glass. pours a nice clear brown with a thin head that disappears completely with no lacing. The aroma is full of pumpkin pie spices cinnamon, clove, vanilla. I think I can smell the pumpkin itself as well. The flavor is less full than the aroma, some malt character comes through. I haven't had very many pumpkin beers, but this one seems fairly weak."
"D- A buddy and I have been picking up as many pumpkin beers as we can and I think this is the best so far"
"Not a bad Pumpkin Ale, although there isn't too much pumpkin flavor in this, just some pumpkin pie spice."
"I will not buy this one again. I have tried a few other pumpkin ales. I like the style, just not this one."
"A 12 ounce bottle poured into my standard shaker glass. The ale appears a clear copper color with about a finger of fluffy light rust colored foam. Nose and flavors consist of nutmeg, cinnamon, caramel, toasted bread, some clove, and I'm even getting a faint hint of roast pumpkin. Body is a bit thin with decent carbonation levels. Not the worst pumpkin ale out there. Can't argue over the price either."
"Drinkability: I haven't consumed numbers of these back-to-back, but it would be easy to do. I wouldn't want an entire evening of these, but putting back a few in a row would be no problem for me."
"Not my type of beer, but ok."
"D) Good. It's low enough in alcohol and a pleasant enough taste to have a few. Not the best pumpkin ale out there, but a decent one that is fairly well balanced."
"Strongest spice that stood out to me was the Cinnamon, with some nutmeg in the mix. Nice malt flavor but could improve with an increase in the body of the beer. Id drink it again, but at the pricepoint, Im considering checking out the Michelob Jacks offering for comparison."
"CHEERS!"
"Bottle: Poured a clear dark ruby color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and minimal lacing. Aroma of light pumpkin with notes of cinnamon and cloves more perceptible then I had expected. Taste is also dominated by cloves and cinnamon which are well balanced with pumpkin and light caramel malt. Body is a bit light for my own taste with good carbonation. Some additional character and more body would have greatly benefited this beer which is still very enjoyable."
"D-Very drinkable overall. I think Post Road is a better beer, but you can't go wrong with this one. One reviewer once wrote that Saranac Beers are like """comfort food""". I agree entirely. Are they the best? No. Do they satisfy the average beer thirst? Absolutely"
"Drinks pretty good, solid pumpkin flavors all meld well, this beer is worthy of a session."
"This brew is a good solid pumkin ale. The ale is not overshadowed by the spices in this one, which makes it very drinkable. A great way to kick start the fall season. A nice effort by Saranac."
"this is an exceptional fall beer, probably the one i look forward to the most. in my opinion, it is the best of all pumpkin-related beers (which is strange bc it's probably one of the cheapest). it has just the right balance of beer and pumpkin taste, and doesn't have too many spices added so it just tastes like pumpkin pie. really enjoyable."
"D - Overall, this isn't a bad pumpkin ale. it passes. I prefer there to be less carbonation, a more dominant pumpkin flavor, less sweetness, more hopy, and just bigger overall."
"D: This brew is impossible for anyone to find unpalatable as long as they like beer, but it really could use a bit more """uuummmph"""..."
"D: Great drinkability altogether. Well rounded and complex. What took me so long to pick this off the shelf is totally beyond me. I will not look at Saranac the same way ever again."
"3.0 D: I really really hate Saranac brews. I bought this as part of a mixed sixer because it was the only pumpkin brew available and I was in the mood for one."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smells of pumpkin with some spices. Taste is surprisingly mild, pumpkin with some malts. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall this is a fairly good beer."
"It should also be noted that Matt Brewing does the contract work for Brooklyn Brewing and their Post Road Pumpkin Ale, which is also a fine recipe, but I prefer Saranac Pumpkin. A delicious autumn reminder."
"S.P.A. pours a surprisingly dark rusty color. The nose is spicy with small hints of pumkin, as it should be. The taste is heavy and dominating. Thick mouthfeel with roasted malt and little carbonation. This finishes heavy, but I could totally have a nice big slice of pumkin pie along with this beer."
"D - I wouldn't drink it again because it wasn't what I was looking for, would have liked less spice and more of a vegetable ale, but if you're looking for a pumpkin pie spice flavor this is a good one to start with and it goes down easy."
"Clear, dark copper with a finger of smooth tan foam that leaves some nice looking lace behind on the glass. The nose is pumpkin pie. Spicy clove, cinnamon, allspice etc. The flavors are pretty typical for the style, spice with a touch of pumpkin but the spice isn't as overwhelming as I find many of the style to be. Light bodied with medium carbonation. While it doesn't blow my mind you could do a lot worse."
"drinkability is decent. the brew is just too heavy on the pumpkin spices. it tastes like pumpkin pie, but in all the wrong ways. the malt does not back up the spice enough to be very palatable."
"I expect more from some of the more notable efforts such as Pumking and DFH punkin', but this one isn't bad and is worth a shot in the season."
"Not the most complex offering in this category (not Saranac's strong point), but an all around good sessionable beer for the fall. I agree with CharmCityCrab that a seriously pumpkiny beer would be very exciting."
"Drinkability: First pumpkin ale and well anymore then one of these would be unpleasant. It doesn't get a super low score because I understand the brewers reasoning, but its really just a basic ale with some spices. Hope all of them aren't like this"
"The beer was a dark amber color with a thin white head. It had a vaguely spice aroma. Taste was pretty much all cinnamon and clove. Couldn't really appreciate anything else. The beer was too spiced and not enough malt to be very good. Won't drink it again."
"cheers."
"Overall, a great representation of what has become my favorite seasonal beer, the pumpkin ale! Cheers."
"D.I thought the flavor was not overbearing. Could have used some more pumpkin, and less of the pie spices"
"All in all a pretty drinkable beer. Not a go to, but I would have another."
"Nice head with a deep amber color. Initial nose of spice, heavy on the cloves. Light carbonation with a medium mouthfeel. Lingering spice taste that reminds me of mace. Taste is slightly off balance and the overall experience is somewhat lacking. Not terrible but I think you can find better examples of the style."
"Overall impression: A highly drinkable, lightly spiced, pumpkin ale. One of the more balanced beers out there. Nicely done."
"Final Thoughts - My favorite pumpkin brew by a long shot. This beer is sweet, and reminds me of thanksgiving desert. The dark brown ale prevents it from being too sweet, and ultimately completes one good pumpkin brew."
"D - awful. just awful. i LOVE pumpkin anything and I love spices, but this was an abomination to beer and to pumpkins everywhere."
"Drinks slow, I expected more from these guys. Maybe this better fresher, but this needs some malt backbone for starters, disappointing"
"7/3/4/2/8 (2.4/5)"
"Mouthfeel was a bit watery for a pumpkin ale, but not at all bad. Overall, I doubt I would want to drink a session, but a few will do perfectly."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Remaining quite effervescent throughout its time in the mouth, it really doesn't add or take away anything from the fact that this beer weighs too heavy in the vanilla and not much in malt and hops. A real challenge to finish, it certainly isn't a craft beer lover's pumpkin ale IMO."
"Sure, I'd be able to drink this one, but I'd rather have something else, I think."
"Nice carbonation and mouthfeel. My first pumpkin beer of the season, good start. I would have another."
"Cool bottle with Jack-O-Lantern lets you know what this one is up front. Smells alot like a pumpkin pie: pumpkin, cinnamon, spices, sweet malt and some hops way in the background. Nice clear brown color with a good foamy head. Taste is well balanced, nice brown ale taste with pumpkin highlights. Good steady bitterness throughout, pumpkin comes through mostly on the aftertaste. Mouthfeel has good carbonation and body, no wateryness here like some flavored brews. This is a good brew, I was a little scared by the imposing Jack-O-Lantern and expecting a bold pumpkin flavor but it has just enough pumpkin to go with a strong ale backbone. A great beer, especially for the fall or holiday season."
"D: Pleasant, and certainly sessionable. I wouldn't have four, but two is certainly doable without palate fatigue."
"A creamy mouthfeel with a chalky dry cinnamon aftertaste bring up the rear on this brew. Close to the holidays this one really hits the spot. I like the subtlety of the spices and the roasted flavors. This one makes it into the top 5 of my novelty holiday beer lists. Worth a try if you are feeling whimsical and in the mood for something very fall-ish."
"One of the better pumpkin ales I've had."
"Drinkability is average here. There are plenty of other pumpkin ales, and although this one isn't bad, it isn't the best. For the price though its great."
"Note - My favorite pumpkin ale bottle... I love the ferocious yet jolly pumpkin on the bottle..."
"Overall it was decent. Nothing terrible by any means, just a decent fall seasonal here. I would try it again, but not my favorite so far."
"A decent first pumpkin ale experience. I've found very few pumpkin ales around this season and this, buffalo bill's and jack's were about all I could find anywhere. Not bad, but probably won't be revistited."
"Drinkability: Not hot. At all, really. Lacking in most of the good spice notes, all of the good pumpkin notes, most of the good malt notes, too cloying, sticky, afterfeely ... not recommended."
"Pours a clear dark amber with 1 finger of foamy cream colored head, good retention and spotty lacing. Smells of cinnamon, pumpkin, clove, allspice, malt. Tastes of pumpkin, honey, grainy malt, floral hops, cinnamon, allspice, and clove. Medium to medium light in body, good carbonation. Smooth and malty with a nice spicy and crisp finish. A pretty solid pumpkin ale, flavorful but balanced, very sessionable."
"Drank three gave, away three. I liked other pumpkin ales better."
"D - This is a nice pumpkin beer. I was a bit apprehensive at first as typically fruit/spice/vegetable/etc beers usually tend to be unbalanced (normally cloyingly sweet) and unpalatable. This was a pleasant surprise. It is balanced and very enjoyable. I don't think I would want too many, but it's an enjoyable beer."
"D: Exceptionally drinkable for a pumpkin ale, although I think the name """spiced amber ale""" fits better. Significantly better than expected -- a nice autumnal beer for friends who like minimally hopped ales."
"I'm a sucker for pumpkin beers. This one is not a good one, though."
"D: Actually one of their better beers just a tad overspiced, but still has a moderately good drinkability considering the style."
"Drinkability: Pretty good tasting, medium bodied with a ABV on the lower side. Good enough for this. I haven't tried too many pumpkin ales (Ichabod, Smuttynose, Harvest Moon)..so I can't judge too much in comparison, but this one is as good as the rest (and better than the Harvest Moon)"
"D = Not a bad beer. After about 3 of them the taste loses its edge and leaves me wanting something else."
"Excellent choice for the fall months, the brew pours a nice dark amber color with a light head that disappears quickly and fills your nostrils with the scents of pumpkin, cinnamon, and cloves. This Pumpkin Ale tastes amazing, with not too much sweetness and just the right amount of hops. You feel like you are drinking a beer, just one with pumpkin flavors mixed in. Some other pumpkin ales make me think I am drinking a pumpkin pie flavored soda, which is not what I am going for. The mouthfeel is wonderful with the pumpkin clearly at the forefront, it finishes with the clove and cinnamon. The drinkability is excellent. This is a great choice during the fall, Pick up a sixer."
"Nice take on a pumpkin ale, certainly would fill any holiday craving this time of year."
"I think this is just above average, not that great. A nice taste for this time of year but are definitely better ones, ie DFW Punkin Ale."
"Drinkability: This a a very good pumpkin ale that I would recommend to any fans of the style. This would be an ideal beer to have with an Autumn style dessert, such as pumpkin pie or baked apples. Try this one out, you won't be disappointed."
"Drinkability- High. Could put back quite a few of these sitting by the fire."
"Very drinkable pumpkin beer for Saranac. Nice."
"Pours a clear cola brown with almost no head. Nose is spiced. Flavor is spices and pumpkin. It's about typical IMO really. The only standout characteristic is the brown sugar tone on the back. Feel has a noticed carbonation that nibbles a bit on the tongue. Liquid is fine. This is a nice enough pumpkin ale."
"D: A fairly drinkable beer. A nice example of a spiced ale, but I cannot really see myself sitting down and drinking a whole six pack of these; maybe two in a row at most. The spices did get to me a little later, but overall, it was pretty good."
"D = Not my top pumpkin ale but definite;y worth drinking. A good standard early Fall ale."
"This beer poured a translucent copper with a single-finger head. The scent is a lot of spices and some maltiness. The taste starts off with some malt that fades into some pumpkin in middle and spices and a bit of hops towards the end. The mouthfeel is fairly thick with a medium amount of carbonation. This is a tasty beer that is nice and drinkable."
"Doverall its a nice beer but too much spic if they had let up on the spice and loaded it up with more pumpkin it would be great"
"Highly Recommended"
"Definitely enjoyed this one. Very nice in the glass, a dark brownish-orange. Smelled of pumpkin and spices, as you'd expect. The taste of spices was stronger than pumpkin, but there definitely was a balance. Had this with some buffalo wings and the combination was superb. Would definitely drink this one again."
"Don't drink and review."
"Enjoy..."
"D: A very nice pumpkin ale, good for bbq'ing and tailgating in the fall!"
"Pours a very nice brown color with amber/orange tints, and has fantastic head and lacing, I just wish the beer were a little more opaque. Great scent, very deep and heady with great pumpkin spices, much like someone dipped a pumpkin pie into a brown ale. Same for the taste, a very nice malty, deep flavor with a nice hop balance, along with avery nice pumpkin pie tastes, although perhaps just a bit too spicy in the aftertaste, which covers up some of the other great beer attributes. It goes down quite smoothly."
"The feel is smooth, buttery and nice. Always a good sign when you're suprised it's almost gone."
"Saranac puts out a solid pumpkin beer with a nice amber color and off white head that fades to lacing. the aroma is a little heavy on the cinnamon, but you can still smell the other pumpkin pie spices. the flavor is decent but once again I found the cinnamon a little overpowering. the medium body and high co2 make this a pretty drinkable beer."
"D - Despite the strange flaws, this is a decent enough pumpkin ale, certainly better than others I've had. Funnily enough, this brew both excels and fails simultaneously in each respect. Color is good but the head is less than impressive. Taste starts off wonderfully but falls into nothingness. Mouthfeel starts out great and then goes watery. A really weird brew."
"Medium bodied, smooth and perfectly carbonated. I might drink another after this one."
"I was impressed by this one. Pours a beautiful deep amber, a nice spice filled smell, and a great thick body with plenty of tasty spices. Very drinkable and well balanced and the pumpkin flavor is kept in check.... very good beer."
"the best pumpkin ale that i have had for this year, the spices play second fiddle to the pumpkin in this one (the way it should be). the spices blend togother niceley with the ginger being the strongest of them, this is so good this year that i will go buy at least a case for the holadays for desart beer. try this one if you see it, its well worth it"
"Still,not one of the best Pumpkin Ales I have had yet decent."
"Not bad, very drinkable, lots of interesting spices and flavors to keep the palate sharp. the beer pours a tawny brown with lots of carbonation and efforvesence. There is an off white somewhat creamy head, a bit of lacing, some retention too. The aroma is heavily tilted in the direction of clove, some bready malts in there too. There is a tad bit of cinnamon as well. The taste is more heavily skewed towards the allspice and clove, with just a touch of pumpkin. There really isn't that much pumpkin flavors emerging. The vanilla is very slight in the nose, and I'm not sure if I'm detecting any at all in the taste. This is an interesting, spiced up, flavored beer, that I ordinarily avoid because they tend to be over the top with additives. Not so Saranak Pumpkin. The beer is slightly more sharp and crisp than smooth, there is a refreshing autumnal quality to the beer, and it is befitting the season. Worth a try."
"D- easy to put this down and i could get loaded quick because you can barely taste the alcohol. Not a bad pumpkin ale!"
"Poured this into a pint glass, pours an amber color with a fluffy head that leaves some nice lace. Smell has some clove to it and some spice nothing over powering. This beer tastes more like a marzen beer than anything, I can only detect a faint taste of pumpkin and spice, overall not bad but I was expecting a bit more. This does go down pretty smooth and I actually enjoyed it, and woud drink again."
"Not a fan of this beer."
"This dark amber ale pours with nice thick head - strong, yet not unappealing, the carbonation is evident from the start. It settles, though not to quickly, into a light lace. The smell is sweet and full of aroma typical of this type of beer. The malty taste is accented well with the subtle pumpkin and spices. It's mouthful was definitely a welcome refresher after the summer months of lighter beers getting me even more excited for the coming fall whether and the seasonal brews it will bring. A nicely rounded and not overly sweet pumpkin ale worth going back for another."
"A very pumpkin beer. Loads of spice, but it almost has more of a winter spice flair to it then just your typical Pumpkin pie type beer. Anyway... still.. A great beer from saranac."
"The beer pours a dark amber color with a creamy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice pumpkin and spice scent that boasts of cinnamon and nutmeg. It also has a bit of crystal malt whick adds a layer of sweetness to the aroma. The taste is decent. It has a very spicey flavor that seems to blend in well with the crystal malts. The pumpkin taste is muttled a bit because of this however. It goes down smooth and finishes quite dry. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a pretty good pumpkin beer. It's spicier than most, but I guess you have to set yourself apart somehow."
"Pours an iced tea color with a short-lived cream colored head that settled into a sparse cap. The aroma is of a light lemony caramel malt, with pumpkin, allspice, clove, and cinnamon. Nice pumpkin aroma. The taste is of a light caramel malt, a bit watery and lemony, but has nice subtle pumpkin flavors and bolder pumpkin pie spices, such as allspice and cinnamon. Again, the feel is a bit light, not as malty as other pumpkins, and has a slight astringent pucker. For my first pumpkin of the season, this hit the spot. It is a respectable pumpkin ale, not overly spicey."
"Notes: Overall it's a little bit too unbalanced on the spicy side."
"Not the greatest pumpkin ale, but surprisingly good for Saranac. I've had this beer out of the bottle before and gotten a way different read on the body and flavor, but this draft was spot on tasty."
"M + D: Lighter to medium body, a seltzer-like carbonation. Finishes quite crisp, which is nice. A pleasant and relaxed beer, and something I could see going back to over the season."
"Saranac simply does not do a bad beer. They're not all excellent, but all are quality choices. This is certainly one of their best beers and this is among my favorite types of beer to have. Well done, if not a bit spiced. Thoroughly enjoyable."
"Picked up a case of this on sale several weeks ago. Having tasted several Pumpkin Ales over the holiday season, I have to say that this one is one of the better ones. I will have to concur with some of the other reviews that it defiantly has a strong spicy odor and taste of cinnamon, vanilla, and pumpkin. Saranac does a nice job with this beer and the price $19.00 (case)!"
"A horribly overspiced mess. Flavored way too heavily with nutmeg and allspice. It masks any favorable attribute to the brew. Terrible bitter aftertaste that lingers forever. A real disappointment. Not what I was expecting from a brewery that usually puts out a decent product."
"This beer pours a deep brownish-amber color with a medium thin and creamy off-white head that dissipates steadily. Stringy lacing. The aroma is mildly malty with hints of allspice and cinnamon. Medium-bodied and smooth with a bland concoction of spice and malt flavors. The finish is earthy malt with a mild lingering spice aftertaste. Pumpkin beers are hit or miss in my experience and this is definitely a miss."
"pours a light to medium brown color with a off white head that fades quickly with some mild lacing. aromas are mild and mostly of the spices. sweet taste, with cinnamon, allspice,cloves, and vanilla all there, maybe a little too much vanilla for my taste but all in all not bad. light mouthfeel and carbonation is good. you can drink a few of these without tiring of the taste."
"All in all, not a bad Pumpkin Ale from Saranac that actually exceeded my expectations somewhat. A nice aroma and lighter body help keep this guy fairly drinkable."
"Smooth enough to drink a bunch of, but I dont know why you'd want to, with the generally bland taste."
"Not overbearing, which adds to drinkability. At least it has a decent """beer""" base, other than just pumpkin, and it's not overly spiced. Worth checking out, but I can't see a true pumpkin ale lover going crazy over it."
"Straight up - An awesome example of pumpkin ale! This one is a real winner if you are a fan of pumpkin brews... The pumpkin flavor and vanilla really stand out and make for a unique and special beer... great with anything sweet... Nice orange, amber color leads to an explosion of sweet, satisfying pumpkin goodness... The cinnamon and ginger flavors are also present too... Any pumpkin ale fan must try this one... I would definitely recommend this one without a doubt... Try to get your hands on this one while you still can... too bad it isn't brewed year-round..."
"So now I sit here drinking the last of them. I had saved it since it was the winner of the pumpkin shootout. It has nice spice (could be a little stronger). It works better than the others I tried this fall. Now, on to the Xmas ales!"
"Beautiful """amber/autumn""" colors. Smells of spices, but not too strong. Taste is much the same. Light spices come through..mostly cinnamon and nutmeg, with a touch of bitterness. Smooth and nice for the time of year, although not my favorite pumpkin ale. Decent offering though, especially when it's free! Makes it taste that much better! Cool bottle, too, with the jack-O-lantern on it. Worth a try. Nice one to drink on Halloween, which I did. Cheers and SAAAALUTE my BA friends!"
"Drinkability - great stuff - heading to a Halloween party near me..."
"D - A pretty average pumpkin, the ale just doesn't provide enough of a foundation for the flavor. Dirnkability wise there are moments that are tasty, but it fails to wow me overall. I found it drinkable for the price at the PX since it was less than $6 for a sixer. I probably won't revisit the experience, though."
"Taste is also very clean, but a tad thin. I say clean because some pumpkin ales are so heavily spiced that they become harsh. The spices here are not overdone, but I think this could use a bit more body. Very light malt base to it that lends a bit of sweetness but feels too thin. A nicely drinkable pumpkin ale, though."
"I love pumpkin ale and Saranac's is pretty good, but it falls short of others I've had such as Brooklyn Brewery's Post Road and John Harvard's Pumpkin Spice. That said, Saranac Pumpkin Ale has a very nice orange appearance with a smell of nutmeg, spice, and hints of pumpkin. The taste follows suit. Some lacing on the glass. A tad bitter, but a nice, dry finish. Pick this up if you like pumpkin ales and judge for yourself."
"The mouthfeel is appropriately light for an ale, making it very drinkable."
"I liked this a little more than some others I've tried, but I still haven't found a pumpkin beverage to match the best I've had, a slice of pie in a glass. I think if the sweetness could be boosted on this one, it would come close, but as is, it's not bad for one or two but I'd quickly look for other tastes."
"This isn't the best pumpkin beer I've had but it is definatly worth trying. More spice flavors than pumpkin flavors. Just not too much complexity here."
"Mouthfeel is very pleasant, nice lighter, medium bodied brew with the right amount of carbonation. This beer is highly quaffable, it's a solid balanced brew for the fall season."
"Worth a try, that's about it."
"D: Lowest drinkability of the sampler 6 pack - happy that I only had just one, didnt thrill me."
"The pumpkin flavor I found a bit weak. However, with its very seasonal appearance, we have here a great ale for October. The smell of pumpkin is at least here: that great combination of cinnamon and spice. The appearance as it poured out was a great pumpkin-like amber color. But the drink is all masked by a crisp, albeit sweet, taste that lacked a true pumpkin punch. I was a little taken aback by the great carbonation of the drink. However, this allows it to be a very accessible drink for the season."
"I drank of few of these this afternoon to enhance my day off. The only thing taking away from this nice fall beer was the fact that it was about 95 outside. The beer pours a really nice amber color with a pale head. The smell is great with pumpkin and cinnamon really coming through. Has a good, solid taste but I would like a little more of the cinnamon to come through like in the Pumpkin Head made by Shipyard. Still a really good seasonal!"
"Drinkability- A nice seasonal. Great for the fall."
"The pour is beautiful with a dark amber color resembling the top of a pumpkin pie. The white head is reminiscent of the whipped cream on top. The smell is very good with a hint of a pumpkin pie flavor. The taste is really good, but not quite as pumpkiny as I was hoping. The cinnamon is very overpowering and not as much nutmeg as I would hope. The feelis very good with perfect carbonation for a beer of this gravity. Overall very drinkable but only for a few. Very nice fall beer."
"Personally, I can only have one or two of these at a time, kind of like a dessert beer."
"Overall: Overall this is a tasty pumpkin beer. Not the best on the market but as one of the cheeper pumpkin beers out there it holds up to the style and stands it ground in the land of pumpkin beers. I would buy again."
"This poured a pleasant dark brown with a white head that lingered. Smell is spicy, cloves and cinnamon. Taste is quite nice, to put it very simply, liquid pumpkin pie. This is exactly what I would expect a pumpkin ale should taste like. Goes down nice and smooth and quite easy to drink. Put simply, Matt Brewing has done it again, succeeding in delivering a good, easy drinking, well crafted brew."
"There's nothing to hate about Saranac Pumpkin Ale because it has no real negatives. Trouble is, it isn't exactly bursting with positives. Unfortunately, the same can be said for most beer from these guys. Here's hoping my next pumpkin ale will have more fire in its belly."
"Not too strong of an odor, but that could be a good thing when it comes to Pumpkin beer. The taste is pretty balanced between cinnamon and nutmeg, but it isn't overpowering or grainy like some other Pumpkins I have recently tried. Overall it's a pretty decent brew, and I could see myself having a few this season."
"Ahhh back to normal. That nose was just wrong but that character displayed is not in the taste. Chewy malt character with a nutty approach with very minor flavors of all spice, cinnamon, nutmeg, and pumpkin. Highly carbonated and somewhat flavorless. Not a beer i'd drink often."
"Overall- Not bad at all. Saranac put together a decent Pumpkin Ale here. Definitely worthy of a pint or 2."
"Light and zesty mouthfeel. Good pumpking beer,not a standout,easy to drink go session beer for a halloween night."
"Pours an amber color with minimal head. Aroma is one of pumpkin and spice, except that it seems thin. Taste is much of the same except that the pumpkin fades into a nice malt background. It's much like a pumpkin pie, but not quite as much as the Shipyard. Somewhat sweet as well. I think it's a decent pumpkin ale but as I said, nowhere as good as other offerings of this style I've had."
"Overall not a bad contribution to the pumpkin/Octoberfest genre. Perhaps my only letdown is that I've been spoiled by Dogfishhead Punkin Ale which is much stronger in flavor and alcohol."
"It's like Egg Nog; I wouldn't appreciate it year-round, but I'm likely to enjoy a sixer or two when it comes around for novelty's sake. I think my wife would really like it, and that's always a plus."
"As far as fall Pumpkin beers or ales I think this is far and away the best that I have had. If there are better ones out there I look forward to trying them."
"D: Drinkability was a low rating because of the disappointment of the lack of ANYTHING pumpkin. Glad I only bought a 6 pack and not a case."
"single from Whole Foods Raleigh"
"Malty is the dominant taste, with minimal spice and an underlying metal aspect, often a Saranac bugaboo. Mouthfeel is thick and a little too artificial tasting but does present a full, round flavor. A decent touch of pumpkin flavor shows up in the aftertaste, but really too little, too late. Unfortunately, this is nothing to write home about. Not awful, but not much better than mediocre."
"Bite-y mouthfeel and very low drinkability. My wife loves the pumpkins, so Ive got to try them all despite liking but a very few."
"Drinkability: Saranacs Pumpkin Ale is good example of a pumpkin ale with a medium body and well balanced mix of spices. Very drinkable!"
"Overall: A very good pumpkin beer. Worth trying if you've never had one, and definitely pick one up if you're a fan of the style."
"One of the better choices in the style. This could work well as a dessert beer by itself. Not my favorite style, but this is my choice for a great go to pumpkin ale. If you like the style, this is one to try."
"D - Not a bad pumpkin selection...not overly flavored but not too watered down either. I'm sorry for the lack of better terms...nothing too special but I'd pick one up next year."
"Thanks jhammerly for another chance to get out of my local world of beers."
"Clear medium dark brown, not much int he way of a head. It dissapeared jsut after pouring. Nose first smells like bbq, pulled pork or some smoked brisket. Next it reminds me of beef boullion. If I concentrate ral hard, I kind of get pumpkin, kind of get spice, but mostly bbq and beef boulion. Sorry peeps. The taste screams of pumpkin, with some decent spice. Finishes with good pumpkin flavors, lingers long on the palate. Near zero carbonation, but a decently creamy mouthfeel."
"Appears an amber caramel hue with a large creamy off white head and it leaves nice bands of even lace around my nonic pint glass. Aroma is perfect with soft mellow spices including cinnamon, all spice, and clove...of course the famous gourd, the pumpkin presence is there as well and it does justice to this often overdone style. Flavor has caramel malt presence with light but evident we get the point doses of spice and everyone's invited to the party with the pumpkin pie spices and and earthy vegetable tone we have ourselves some pretty good stuff here...balance equals good in a pumpkin ale. Mouthfeel is medium bodied slight syrupy character with even carbonation flows very nicely glass empties itself. Drinkability...this should be the standard for the style flavorful yet doesn't make my stomach wrench after the first pint of it."
"Drinkability: This is not a beer I would buy again. It tastes like an ale that was injected with cinnamon. There isn't any complexity and there is very little, if any, pumpkin flavor."
"M&D - medium body and drinkability, smooth, but not blanaced all to well, and average brew"
"Overall, a pretty good attempt at a pumpkin ale, but like most others, this one still left me wanting more from it than what I got."
"Not as sweet as I expected, and much more refreshing. My favorite fall beer is probably a tie between this and Smuttynoses Pumpkin Ale. Very drinkable, very crisp, very delicious beer."
"The Saranac lacks the boldness of some great beers, but more than makes up for it with a crisp mouthfeel and lighter body that make for excellent drinkability. This pumpkin ale makes a great starting point for the newly adventurous drinker or as a beer to convert the Keystone-loving beer heathens. But really, this is just a beer for anyone that likes pumpkin pie."
"drinking this beer feels like drinking a pumpkin pie. lots of pumpkin and cinnamon flavor. very similar style to a winter beer. great copper coloring. poured very nicely. probably would not want to have more than one in a session. priced very reasonably for a seasonal brew."
"Overall, a nice overall pumpkin ale that covers all the bases."
"is fine with me, the spices don't do you in on this, tastey, Its not the greatest fall offering but it deserves to be around each season."
"D - Its a good one to feed to the masses if they dont really care what they are drinking. I wont go ouot of my way to get this again."
"As is the case with almost all """pumpkin""" ales, what we're really talking about here is a spiced ale. The use of real pumpkin pulp doesn't generally lend much flavor to the beer, but the spice does. The question then becomes, is it balanced? Well, yes it is. Matt has done an excellent job with this one, clearly laying out the pumpkin pie character, yet keeping it just on the edge of going overboard. The spice is clear and upfront in both the flavor and the aroma, with the cinnamon and all-spice very noticeable in the flavor, and the vanilla and clove more clear in the aroma, but not so much in the flavor where it's kind of drowned out - the all-spice and cinnamon dominate (although the clove follows close behind). The sweetness of the malt is just enough to support the spiciness, and it doesn't become """sweet""". The bitterness is therefore kept low to achieve that, and really, it's not needed - the spice does the job! And I think that perhaps the vanilla, even though it's low-key in the flavor, is enough to stimulate the brain into thinking that it's sweeter and softer than it might actually be. So although I'm still not sure that there can ever be any real level of drinkability to a pumpkin ale, the Saranac pumpkin is at the very least one of the best """first""" beers at Halloween (or anytime during the fall season), and may pass second-beer muster. Well done! Absolutely worth trying for those who enjoy pumpkin ales, or even spiced beers in general."
"The mouthfeel of this beer is full bodied which is very nice and fits with expectations of this style. Higher levels of carbonation give a nice feeling on the tongue once this beer is swallowed. This beer is an easy drink, and is quite enjoyable; however, unless this is the only pumpkin beer that I can get my hands on this season I will not be purchasing this particular brand again. Don't get me wrong, its a good beer, but I know that there are much better beers out there that really shine in this style. Dogfish Head Punkin' ale is fantastic, and I would recommend that over this any day."
"Poured a deep amber color with moderate white puffy head. Smell denotes a mild clove note but little else. Taste is also a bit spicy with a light detection of cloves. Finish is nice and refreshing with a nice full mouthfeel. Excellent drinkability. Somewhat lacking as a pumpkin ale, but still a nice beer."
"Cheers!"
"A slighty above average Pumpkin Ale from Saranac. I've said this before about other beers in this style and I'll say it again, it's no Smuttynose Pumpkin Ale."
"Drinkability: One of the better pumpkins out there; a pleasant surprise from a brewery that has often been a disappointment to me"
"Drinkability: Basically this beer was a lot like the label. It was non-offensive, non threatening, and very little was going on. What can I say, at least it's cheap. I couldn't commit to buying a six-pack and only bought a single. I'm glad I only got one bottle."
"This was the first time Ive had Saranacs pumpkin ale. It pours a rich copper color, with a moderate soapy head. The aroma is as notable for the spice as it is for the pumpkin. I picked up a lot of cinnamon, vanilla, and ginger. The pumpkin is also present, but didnt seem to have the same prominence as the spice. Theres also an underlying mildly toasted malt and grain character. The taste is similar, with a lot of spice flavor. The brew is a little more carbonated than necessary, giving it a distracting effervescence that I dont think fits well with the style. Still, this is a pretty enjoyable brewslightly sweet, pumpkin-pie flavor, and fully appropriate for the season."
"Body is light to medium, with the dull mouthfeel that accompany's every offering from this brewery. Easy to put away nontheless, especially while noshing on a steaming bowl of sweet potato and crab bisque and buttered, toasted baguette."
"From a 12 oz bottle, served in a pint glass, poured a decent copper/amber color with very little head that dissipated quickly leaving little to no lacing. Very lacking in the smell department, all I smell is basic sweet malts, no special pumpkin spices at all. Flavor was similarly lacking, slight sweetness, with the first taste the aftertaste had some basic pumpkin spice flavors (cinnamon mostly). After the first taste there wasn't anything there for me, however, and all I got was a very slight sweetness. Mouthfeel isn't bad, smooth, good amount of carbonation. Drinkable, but as many others have said, why would you bother when there's so many other better pumpkin ales?"
"Pours a clear copper-caramel color with a frothy but low off-white head that doesn't rise up much and then recedes very quickly. Aroma of sweet malt and cinnamon. Flavor is initially cinnamon, followed by some sweet malt, and then a strong nutmeg flavor. Clara Peller would probably taste this beer and say """Where's the Pumpkin?""" I honestly don't detect any. There's a hint of buttered corn in the finish, followed by a misplaced peppery bite that lingers. The taste is not bad, but I'm scoring it low because it's missing the main ingredient. Mouthfeel is smooth, full, moderate carbonation. It's fairly drinkable, but why bother? There are so many other better pumpkin beers."
"Served in a pint glass, it pours an amber color with not much of a head at all. It smells like bready malt, cinnamon, nutmeg and some pumpkin. It pretty much tastes the same way, but there's more of a spicy taste than a pumpkin taste. There's also a small bitter aftertaste, but it doesn't last long at all. The mouthfeel is light and a bit slick, and it has moderate carbonation. The drinkability is good. Overall the beer is OK, I could drink it every once in a while."
"Drinkability is fine, but why would you want to? Can't recommend this one, even though I love DFH and Bklyn's pumpkin ale efforts."
"A fine example of this style, and one of Saranac's better offerings."
"Admittedly I am not a fan of pumpkin pie but I always look forward to the fall pumpkin beer each year,this poured a light copper with a 1/2 finger white head that was gone quite fast seems to be quite carbonated and somewhat spritzey.Pumpkin spice mainly in the nose cinnamon and mace stick out mainly a hint of nutmeg and an underlying toasted grain character,a sharp even light mouthfeel didnt like the feeling of that much.Subdued spice flavors not over the top quite pleasant nutmeg and cinnamon mainly even a touch of butter.Not bad flavors but the thin sharp mouthfeel is undesirable in my mind and it takes away from its drinkability,not bad but wont seek out again."
"It's not that I didn't like this beer, I just think my expectations were a little high. This is my first experience with autumnal beers, and, after having consumed many Belgian-style ales, I thought this may have that big, slightly sweet flavor I associate with fruity beers. Now that I know what to expect, I would drink this again."
"Appearance is a nice deep brownish orange hue, although surprisingly clear with a fair amount of visible carbonation and no head retention. The aroma is very subtle but pleasant, and has layers of vanilla and clove. The taste is of warm spices; nutmeg and cinnamon, with a faint hint of pumpkin and a sweet malt flavor that carries through to the end. A small but noticeable hop balance. The smell and taste seem to be more fall spices in general than anything inherently pumpkin. Thin and watery mouthfeel. Overall an easily drinkable beer, but I didn't find the pumpkin to be nearly as pronounced as I would have expected from the style and label art."
"First pumpkin ale of the season, and not bad at all. Pours a crystal clear copper-orange with a nice sized off-white head, pretty good retention, and a good amount of lacing. Smell is rather faint vanilla overlaid with a vague cinammon spiciness, a litle clove as the beer warms. Taste is a nice solid slightly toasty malt imbued with a nice amount of spices--cinammon, allspice, and clove--a moderate pumpkin coming through in the middle, finishing with a nice spicey pumpkin pie aftertaste. Medium bodied beer with a slightly dry finish. This is a really solid seasonal by Saranac, maybe not the best pumpkin ale out there, but for the price it's worth getting a few six packs."
"D: I'm glad I bought just the one bottle of this. I'm not well-versed in the style, but I still can't get past the finish. It's actually pretty promising up until then. It smelled great, and the front of the sip was pleasant."
"Pours amber/orange. Decent head goes into a moderate laceing. Lots of bubbles. Smell is sweet, and spicy. Cinnamon, and allspice mostly.Maybe a hint of hops. Body is thin, and carbonated. Taste is cinnamon, and pumpkin up front, with a dry allspice finish. Liked it!."
"I was expecting more flavor out of this one. I guess i could drink a few of these, but i'd opt for something else next time."
"Given that I'm not a huge fan of herbed/spiced ales, it's not a big surprise that I didn't dig this one. Nonetheless, I couldn't get past the artificial flavor and overused spices."
"I consider myself a pumpkin ale aficionado of sorts and find myself comparing all I can find to taste. This one is easily one of my favoritesat least of those that are bottled. Saranac/Matt does it again. This was a very pleasant surprise to see at the local store in August. Happy (early) Halloween."
"I like pumpkin beers. I think it is the perfect cold weather brew. This Saranac Pumpkin is much easier drinking than most. It is light and crisp and doesn't get bogged down in heavy spiciness."
"It's utterly inoffensive and somewhat indifferent, but it's not bad, for what that's worth. There's a slightly savory splash of spicy sass, with just enough malt and yeast to balance things out. While nothing to write home about, maybe, it's enjoyable enough to have one or two more. Hey...you could do a lot worse."
"Last swigs: Plenty of pumpkin, but became a bit tongue coating."
"A solid pumpkin ale from Matt Brewing. Poured out to a dark orange color with a dense head of about 3/4 of an inch. Medium level of carbonation. Aromas of pumpkin, cinnamon, spices and herbs fill the nose. Taste is comparable to aroma; pumpkin, spice, brown sugar, roasted malt and a minor hop presence makes this brew a bit more complex than other pumpkin brews. Mouthfeel was medium bodied yet retained a lager-like drinkability, making it light and smooth. Very drinkable, this is one of the better pumpkin ales I've had. Recommended. Thanks to connecticutpoet for the sample."
"Brew poured to dull amber color with a smallish white head that does not have much retention but did leave some lacing around the top of the glass. The aroma is mostly of spices, but they are not as strong as I thought they would be. Seems to be tame compared to other pumpkin ales I have had this season, which is not a bad thing. The taste is nice, very smooth. Malt characteristics seem to dominate with the spices hitting the taste buds a little bit after the initial malt flavors. Over all this is a nice brew, one that I will get again next year if Saranac comes out with it again. Nice effort put forth by Matt's."
"Oooh, peppery and some taste of ground cumin. Cinnamon galore and nutmeg too! Yowza. Like I said, very powerfully front-loaded on taste and mouthfeel, which drops off considerably (read: too much) as I let it linger or swallow it. I like it...but I see potential unrealized. God, what neat vanilla!"
"Drinkability is a little below average... a little too heavy on the spices."
"Pours a dark brown with mahogany highlights. A very small head formed after an aggressive pour. The aroma is a very strong malt base with nutmeg, cinnamon, and other spices. Not much in the way of pumpkin, but everything you associate with the spicing of pumpkins. The taste is very spiced up. It starts with a pleasant maltiness. The spices, namely nutmeg and cinnamon, come in very quickly and take over. Nothing else is really allowed to come through. There doesn't seem to be any pumpkin taste. It seems like an amber that's been spiced to heck. Not bad per se, but not very good either. Not being a fan of spiced beers (winter warmer included), the drinkability on this is just not very good."
"The body of this beer seemed watery and unimpressive but gave way to an aroma of vanilla and spice. There was a VERY slight hint of a chocolaty-caramel-coffee I can't put myfinger on. There is more of that in the flavor which was suprising; vanilla and hints of caramel and cinnamon spice. The mouthfeel was mediocre; watery and almost a flat feel. Once again, I need to have more pumpkins to get a better feel of the style."
"Drinkability: Decent enough. Nothing special here."
"Saranac beers tend to be pretty good and this one is no exception. Very smooth, warming on a cold, rainy night (such as this), and not too expensive nor cheap. A mellow take on a pumpkin ale worthy of a """second slice"""."
"Drinkability: Pretty tasty. It may not be the ultimate example of the style, but I'd definitely buy it again. It's not overly spiced, which, to me, way too many pumpkin ales are, and that's what it makes it so highly drinkable."
"Nice pumpkin flavor which is surprising. Also, there is a noticeable hop finish which my nose could not detect. I like the body (full) and carbonation (moderate). This is a drier beer than many pumpkins are made. I tend to like this style more than the sweeter heavier malted beers. Still, there is some wonderful flavors and complexities here."
"From the bottle, a nice amber color. Little head, which was probably my fault. Smell wasn't readily apparent, though I could sense the cinnamon spices. On first sip, was a little taken aback, as it was my first 'pumpkin' beer. Second try, could taste the cinnamon and it was good. Good hints of vanilla and other spices were vaguely present. Felt like a normal beer, nothing too spectacular in that repect. After about half a pint, I thought the vanilla was overpowering a little bit. Should have had some food to complement. Definitely not a beer to sit down to and drink away, but paired with some good autumn-y food, I'd say this is a pretty good beer to drink once in a while."
"looks great. nice dark and crystal clear with sizeable head of medium density. aroma has a peppery spice to it, blended plethora of additives and subtle on the pumpkin essence. an even maltiness subexists. overall, excessively sweet tasting. heavy on the vanilla and sweeter cinnamon aspects.. mild pumpkin if any at all. a bit too light and bubbly mouthfeel-wise. tastes like dogfish punkin mixed with a bud light. noble effort but a failure in the grand scheme of fall beers."
"This is a rather tasty pumpkin ale. It pours a nice """amberish""" color. The head is plentiful, and lasting. The aroma is nicely spicey. The taste is pumpkinish, pleasantly spiced. While not overwheling the spices are enough to limit the drinkability of this ale. This is certainly a pumpkin ale worthy of your time. Enjoy!"
"Quite the pumpkin pie aroma. Nice malty pumpkin base with spiced accents of nutmeg and clove. Poured a small, dark tan head thaht faded quickly to a thin film. Transparent, dark caramel colored beer that shows no signs of life. Light pumpkin pie spices mix with a solid bready malt and pumplin core. There is a bit of tea flavor in there, but otherwise the flavors simply meld into the finish. Mouthfeel is somewhere between watery and soft. Saranac beers tend to be light on flavor, but this one has more then usual and strikes a nice balance of spices and malt."
"The beer is rather life less the head is there for about half a minute and then gone, poof. I t has a really deep copper color, closer to ruby. The smell is of ginger maybe a little nutmeg no pumpkin and the malt is killed by the ginger. Cold warm it matters not. The taste is over ginger ale with food coloring and some alcohol. The malt is hiding and wont come out and I can't blame it. The mouthfeel is that of soda, to much carbonation, yuck. No thanks, see you next year, maybe."
"Pours a copper/amber color, mostly clear. One finger off-white head shrinks to a thin cap and weak lacing. Cinnamon and allspice aromas, with only traces of toasted malt . Similiar taste, with the spices making up much of the flavor. Fresh pumpkin, vanilla extract, and a strong ginger character take the lead, complimenting the lighty toasted malt and well balanced hops and ending with a semi-dry phenolic aftertaste. The smooth, low carbonated, medium body finishes with some pleasent clinging spiciness. The appeallng taste and drinkability make this a good choice for a fall session ale."
"I prefer most styles of beer as cold or colder than suggested but I strongly encourage letting this sit for 10 minutes outside of your fridge... I had a 3.5 for the taste at first, but it's a 4 when it's warmer."
"I'm glad the boys at FX Matt decided to do this, and am a bit surprised it took them this long. While there are certainly better examples of the style, if Pumpkin Ales are your thing, this is certainly worth a try."
"I dont want to finish the 6 pack I bought, and hopefully I can find people that like it that I can give it to."
"This beer was copper colored and produced a lovely off-white creamy head which lasted throughout sampling. Good lacing too. Light hints of pumpkin and malt in the aroma. Tasted of light pumpkin and spice akin to a pumpkin pie, but not as dramatic or pleasing. Felt good in the mouth and was nice going down. Worth the try, but nothing too exciting."
"Over all, this is nothing to write home about. It has a pumpkin flavbor, but it doesn't stick around, kinnda watery even. some spices and hints of hops in the after taste. There is a mix of malt as well, both it all just kinnda mixes. It does well in the mix, but, like I said, nothing overly impressive"
"Mouthfeel is mild crisp at the start and finish. The finish is slighty dry, and the spices softly lingers on the tongue. Very nice drinkability, as this is a little lighter bodied than some other pumpkin ales. I was surprising impressed, as this is one of the better Saranac brews I have sampled."
"Nice work, Saranac!"
"Not the best pumpkin ale that I have had, though it is up there on my list."
"Anyways, I will definitely drink more of these in the future."
"Great pumpkin ale, I'm impressed. Hopefully they'll role this out every year."
