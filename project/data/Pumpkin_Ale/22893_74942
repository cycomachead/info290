This is release #21 so some of the spices may have fallen out, also the bottle looked underfilled to my eye. Overall a very pumpkin foward beer with not a whole lots else going on. I enjoyed trying it but probably won't grab another unless it's super fresh for comparison.","BreweryRun","Dec 13, 2014"

Upfront in the flavor there is plenty of roasted character followed up by the pumpkin pie taste and mocha even.  Just a bit of spices mainly just pumpkin and roasted malt here but they definitely work well together.  Full bodied well carbonated ale.  The Pumpkin Stout is becoming a big trend in seasonal beer here in the states.  With these flavor combinations, it can easily be understood why.","Stinkypuss","Dec 05, 2014"

I'll admit that I have rarely been thrilled with pumpkin beers, so my lukewarm perspective may be slanted. But, it's a creative brew, not cloying or out of balance, so I'll take it as an autumn accompaniment to football season.","1sophrosyne1","Oct 25, 2014"

Smell is pumpkin pie spice, malt, chocolate. Taste is bitter and sour, sweet pumpkin pie flavor followed up by a sourness that leaves a lingering allspice/cocoa flavor on the back of the palate. Mouthfeel is bubbly and thin, unlike a true porter in my eyes. Not as thick as a stout should feel. Overall.. Combined with aroma and flavor this type of beer is ideal for me, just wish the sweetness of the aroma permeated through the taste into something creamier and bitier. The sourness of the after taste, and almost acridness takes away from what the aroma promises, but overall decent.","fgmiele","Apr 23, 2014"

Not a lot of actual pumpkin character comes through though. Just like most of the prior examples this has an astringent note--I'm starting to wonder if that is from the spices or from pumpkin itself...","Jackofallbrews","Nov 13, 2013"

Pours nearly opaque clear dark reddish brown color with a 1-2 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of chocolate, pumpkin, caramel, cocoa, roasted malt, cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, toast, vanilla, dark bread, ginger, and roasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt, pumpkin, and spice notes; with great strength. Taste of big chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, pumpkin, caramel, cinnamon, toast, clove, nutmeg, vanilla, ginger, dark bread, and roasted earthiness. Lingering notes of chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, toast, pumpkin, cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, ginger, dark bread, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic balance, complexity, and robustness of dark malt, pumpkin, and spice flavors; with a great malt/spice balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very creamy and moderately slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent pumpkin porter! All around great balance, robustness, and complexity of dark malt, pumpkin, and spice flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Sep 29, 2013"

4.1,7.3,4,4,4.25,4,4,"22 ounce bottle, Release #9, 8.1% ABV. I checked Epic's website, and it says it was brewed on 6/26/2012, packaged on 7/8/2012. Looks like our local beer stores are still selling last year's bottles since I just picked this up a few weeks ago, kinda surprised since I didn't see it around last year. Oh well, this should still be good. Served in a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass, the beer pours dark brown with about an inch tan head that stayed around for a long time. There's also a good amount of lacing. The brew smells like roasted/grainy malt, pumpkin, nutmeg, cloves, bittersweet chocolate and cinnamon. Taste is similar to the aroma, but with the addition of some ginger. Nice mix between pumpkin and porter. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's coating, smooth and easy to drink with moderate carbonation. I liked this brew a lot, although I would like to try a fresher bottle of this at some point. Definitely worth a try. $5.99 a bomber.","bluejacket74","Sep 27, 2013"

Cinnamon, nutmeg, and chocolaty notes on the nose, maybe a hint of vanilla, which comes through more in the flavor. Didn't get a lot of pumpkin flavor from this though. Certainly get chocolate, vanilla and spice. I think it would be more accurately described as a """spiced vanilla porter with hints of pumpkin", but I didn't think this was an """epic""" pumpkin ale or anything, actually kind of suprised by the higher ratings.

Aroma of toasted malt, roasted pumpkin, hints of vanilla and dark dried fruit. Flavor of light toasted malt, mild pumpkin, burnt toast, light vanilla, some nuttiness; finishes with charred, non-aromatic coffee and bitterning hops. Medium bodied. An interesting take on a pumpkin beer that leans more towards a toasty porter than most, but does not have the body or heavy malt of a pumpkin porter. A nice change of pace on the boundary of the two styles. It will not knock Elysian's Dark of the Moon or Great Pumpkin off their thrones, but is a pleasant alternative.","LiquidAmber","Aug 13, 2013"

One of the things I like most about Epic is that their fruit beers aren't usually overpowering, the beer still holds centerstage and the fruit just adds another layer. Don't get me wrong, this is a really good beer. It's just not a pumpkin beer.","Jree261","Aug 09, 2013"

This beer had decent drinkability, it was smooth and not too filling, with some nice flavors that held my attention, I could drink a whole bottle of this but more than that and I think it would start to wear on me. What I liked the most about this beer was the aroma, it was pretty good, it was so unique how it smelled like a bag of mixed Halloween candy. What I liked the least about this beer was the mouthfeel, it just felt a little too watery for the style. I would buy a bottle of this again next year, I would like to try it fresh, it's expensive but I got 20% off since it was older stock, but I think $12 is too much for this beer, I would recommend this to anyone who likes pumpkin beers. All in all I was happy with this beer, everything worked well together and the spices weren't overdone. So far this is up there as one of the better Pumpkin Ale's I have had. Good job guys, this was a nice collaboration and I will be on the search for more brews from both brewerys, keep up the good work.","StoutHunter","May 12, 2013"

Good flavor profile with obvious pumpkin, though it's not as bold as some in the style. It melds well with vanilla sweetness, milk chocolate, light coffee.

The taste brings in more of the same, with the spices coalescing into the roast, creating a full, rounded, thoroughly """dark""" flavor combination. In the background lurks a bit of what seems like pumpkin seeds (never tell me there could be pumpkin involved...). The body is a limber medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda drying finish. Overall, a very nice pumpkin porter, one that finds a way to not only not overdo it on the spices, but to have them actually augment the otherwise mild roastiness. Good times.","TMoney2591","Nov 16, 2012"

I am surprised that I am not getting an anise aroma or flavor from this beer though as that seems to be one of the more noticeable notes in beers that have had Five-Spice added to them; though perhaps this blend of Five-Spice is different.

3.55,-7.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Pours a nearly-black deep brown color with a thin light tan head and not much in the way of lacing. Thin tan collar as it goes down. The nose carries some light pumpkin spice and plenty of porter character. Fairly roasty with a bit of chocolate. Faint spice. Flavor has chocolate and a fair amount of roast. Medium body with light carbonation and a nice full mouthfeel. Not over the top in any direction. Well done.","Thorpe429","Nov 14, 2011"

2.35,-38.5,4.5,2,2,3,2.5,"Pours nice and black with an attractive small-bead foam tan head. The sniff is not attractive, what little of it there is. Even after warming there is barely a thing to snuff on. Mild roast, slight veggie pumkin-squashiness, but most prominent is a metallic taste. I can only smell spices if I try to imagine it really hard with my brain parts. Taste follows pretty closely to the smell. A metallic twang on the finish really makes it hard to swallow. A bit light on body but the carbonation helps lend a nice fluffy full feeling. It's just not there.","7ate9","Nov 12, 2011"

EPIC on the other half of the equation is a nice surprise, this combo is among the best stuff I've tried from them.","Daniellobo","Nov 11, 2011"

3.81,-0.3,4.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"The mouthfeel is medium bodied and carbonation is moderate. Overall I thought it was a pretty good beer. I really liked that the spices were a little more reserved in it and some actual pumpkin seemed to come out. There are tons of spice bombs out there so it was a little refreshing for me that this was a little different. The porter characteristics were nice as well and the flavors worked pretty well together. Overall a pretty nice beer of the style.","billab914","Nov 05, 2011"
3.75,-1.8,4.5,4.5,3.5,3,3.5,"O: In all fairness, I've never had a Pumpkin Porter before. That being said, I was disappointed by this one. Maybe I just don't like the style, but I felt that the pumpkin/porter flavors could have been integrated better, as the porter side of this beer dominates the pumpkin. The smell gave me a lot of promise, but ultimately, the taste didn't live up to it. Also think the carbonation on this needs to be ratcheted up a touch. This one is slightly flat, sticky sweet, and really heavy. A decent brew and worth checking out, but I don't see myself revisiting this.","siege06nd","Beers"
