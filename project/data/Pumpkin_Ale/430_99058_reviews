"One of my favorite beers."

"A very odd beer for me. The pour was a nice amber color with an off colored head that trails the glass. The smell was full of wood with hints of caramel and vanilla, however there was not much pumpkin on the nose. The taste was heavy on the wood with then a bit of pumpkin and brown sugar on the end. Enjoyable but not very well balanced."
"had this at GABF in 2014. Great!!"
"Bourbon, Yes..Pumpkin, not much.. I love there base beer, it's my dessert at most dinners when available. I bought this as my wife is a huge Pumpkin fan and this was no pumpkin. Letting a few sit in the basement to see if the bourbon will chill out and the veg will come thru...TBD"
""
"The pumpkin and spice hit me first followed by the hint of bourbon. No head of note. Deceptively easy to drink for a 10% but a fine ale for Christmas night here in Offaly Ireland."
""
""
""
"an above average bourbon pumpkin ale, it doesnt' have much to flavor of pumpkin, as it is masked by the bourbon, however, its still a solid brew."
""
"O-Better than I was expecting, but for the price a try it and never have it again."
""
""
""
""
"Very smooth pumpkin ale"
""
"A nice seasonal pumpkin ale, a bit boozy, but fitting for colder days. A small """artificial""" note (cheap kind of bourbon?) underneath it all, but covered smartly by the spices."

"O - Bottom line, this is a simple beer that I like.  THIS IS NOT A COMPLEX BEER.  You get an amber ale with pumpkin flavors and an bourbon barrel bite.  And I like it!  More than most it seems."

"When I saw all the pumpkin or harvest or seasonal beers offered at TW I thought pumpkin and ale  just sounds wrong. Well a friend gave me this one. I didn't notice the ABV until I  tasted it. First thing I noticed was the alcohol. Then the second mouthful revealed complexity and as it warmed the flavors came through. Oak, vanilla and caramel balanced with pumpkin spices and just a touch of each makes a nice flavorful ale. I really wouldn't want stronger pumpkin spice flavors. This is very nice. I would buy this but a six will last awhile. Recommended."
""
""
""
"O: This is a drinkable beer on some levels, but is uneven in others. There are definitely worse examples of the style out there."
""
""
""
""
""
"I liked this beer because it's a bit different from other pumpkin beers.  I like the barrel aging.  It's goes some rough edges, but most of the beers from Alltech do."

"The taste echoes the cinnamon of the aroma but the pumpkin spice is somewhat muted.  Yet it is there enough for one to know they are drinking a pumpkin spice.  I did not get much in the way of the bourbon barrel aging but overall I thought it was pretty vibrant and tasty  beer."

"Full of flavor, but I wouldn't want more than one at a sitting."

"Sweet flavor with a definitive alcohol kick.  The pumpkin comes through in the swallow.  Rich body and an equally low carbonation.  The aftertaste is more alcohol and sweet malt.  Short lived."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Low B-"
"O - A different but good take on traditional pie spice pumpkin beers, but lacks in some areas. Excellent aroma, smells exactly like what it says on the bottle. The generic sweetness would be better replaced by a dark caramel to complement the bourbon along with an increase on the spices. One of the better beers that uses a sour pumpkin flavor."
""
"Medium dark amber color. Big cinnamon aroma with a hint of fruit. Fruity pumpkin taste. Some spice flavor. It’s good."

"overall: Alltech's brews have been ok but this one is tops for me."
""
""
""
""
""
"Cinnamon, clove, and brown sugar dominate.  The oakiness comes on strong as the beer warms.  One of the better beers from this brewery.  The original bourbon ale may be the only beer they make that I prefer to this one."

"An """interesting""" brew for one."

"O – Not bad. An interesting mix for sure. I like my pumpkin a bit more like a pie flavor and this deviates a bit. Overall its solid but not great."
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"Disappointing.  I thought that pumpkin and bourbon barrels were going to be a pretty good mix, but it might just be poor execution.  The flavor was a bit too strong on the pumpkin, not enough on the bourbon.  Surprisingly crisp, would have thought there would have been a heavier body as well like most bourbon ales.  The color was nice, a hazy amber, very good looking beer with a mild white head.  Overall...was really hoping for something better."

"It’s official – not every beer or ale tastes better from bourbon barrels."
""

"Overall I like it get the pumpkin flavor up and it would be a total winner. I like it and would recommend it for sure."

"Just like the standard Ale from Kentucky, this adds some nice spice notes.  Very tasty but not something I can drink constantly.  I'd imagine it would mix great with the same types of beers as the standard Bourbon Barrel Ale.  I plan to try mixing with a Vanilla Porter very soon."
"O: My preferred pumpkin beers taste like the pie and this one delivers"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice Pumpkin smell as you open the bottle, pours golden copper as you would expect. A bit strong but at 10% abv that was a given. Flavor is amazing with smooth pumpkin and then the mild bourbon finish. Very, very nice with amazing quality. A bit expensive but happy to have tried it."

"I grabbed a mixed 6-pack of various seasonals just for fun. I had low expectations for this one, considering I was less than impressed with other offerings from this brewery. I can admit when I'm wrong. When it comes to pumpkin ales, I like a good one, but they don't exactly excite me. This is one of the best I've had. I can see it being a bit strong for some, but not me. I will be buying more of this while I can."

"O - A good pumpkin beer.  Stock up! Cheers!"

"Kentucky Pumpkin Barrel Ale -----3.5/5"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: pleasantly surprised! Their bourbon barrel ale and stout are both somewhat underwhelming, so I set my expectations accordingly, but this was a fine pumpkin ale, assuming you enjoy the likes of Pumking, Greater Pumpkin, Smashed Pumpkin, and Punkin. Still can't believe the abv - this drinks real easy and light. Recommended for pumpkin ale lovers if nothing else."
""
""
"Copper golden color. Boozy pumpkin spice nose. Juicy pumpkin notes, nutmeg, vanilla oak notes.  Not overwhelmingly flavorful."

"...update - well, that took about 20 minutes to figure out the last bottle was doomed. It's nearly midnight and I have a long day tomorrow, but in a carpe diem mentality, I am enjoying this last bottle right here, right now. So here's to all of you who fly in the face of reason for the love of one more awesome craft beer. Slainte."

"impressive beer right here. i went through all the pumpkins left in the fridge last night, and this was by far the most enjoyable of the beers i had. it has a pale golden color, really light for a pumpkin beer. a nice white head with great clarity and sparkle and a wonderful nose of oaky bourbon barrels, very gentle spice, and a unique sweetness. the taste profile is very well refined, so much going on here but not dominant spice or gross overripe pumpkin flesh, its all perfectly put together. my girlfriend tasted carrot cake and frosting, and upin close examination, i had to agree with her. this has a light and delicate pumpkin side, and a delicate sweetness with just enough baking spice. the oak adds a lot, vanilla and smoothness to the whole thing. one of the lighter pumpkin ales in color and flavor that ive had, and also one of the best hidden alcohol strengths in the beer world. my first beer from these guys is very impressive, great use of spice and barrel. im going to have to get a whole lot more of these next fall."

"O- a bit sweeter than expected, I would have preferred a bit more bourbon flavor, but overall pretty enjoyable for a style that hasn't been tried often"

"Pours a golden amber with a creamy but thinnish foam cap. Some lacing. Delicious nose of pumpkin, clove, allspice, cherries, is reminiscent of the taste of pumpkin pie with a slight bit of cherry pie mixed in. Taste right away is vanilla, pumpkin, nutmeg, cherry, a light sweetness ties it together. Medium body, creamy mouthfeel. It's clear that this is a pumpkin beer from the spices however these are lightly applied to good effect mingling with a bit of vanilla and cherry element from the bourbon aging. No noticeable alcohol. Lightly sweet but a dry finish. Big fan of pumpkin beers as well as bourbons, and I really enjoyed this one."

"From trying many examples of this style, I simply don't think that barrel aging a pumpkin ale works in the least bit. The spices and pumpkin flavors DO NOT mesh with the notes that the barrel adds. Didn't like."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is heavy on the pumpkin and spices, and smooth. I don't sense much of the bourbon barrel aging here, so a second bottle may be in order. The high ABV also isn't too apparent, though this definitely is a flavorful and heavy brew. Enjoyable, and begging for a revisit."
""
"Overall, a decent beer and a nice unique take on a pumpkin beer. I only wish the mouthfeel was a bit more substantial and the flavors a little more defined. It is all just a little bit of a mess."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - The woman at the liquor store suggested this one to me. I am I only bought one bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The spicing is ample, but the barrel aging does a good job of reigning it in. The base beer still seems overly sweet. It works, but the balance is tenuous at best. Good as a sipper, the barrel flavors work like comfort food."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Not bad, doesn't warrant the price tag but a decent take on a BB pumpkin beer."
"O - A beautifully barrel-aged pumpkin beer, this light and drinkable brew might actually be too drinkable, slyly inserting high alcohol into it's smooth lighter body and soft, warming finish. The pumpkin isn't over the top either, so if you're looking for something that's not pie in a glass, this one is for you."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a solid Imperial Pumpkin Ale. The bourbon is subtle, but gives it another dimension. It's enjoyable."
""
"O- Overall, this beer is a unique twist on a pumpkin beer with nice notes from the barrel aging. Glad I tried this one."
""
""
""
"Not nearly as cloying as the bba, which is good, and the pumpkin detracts from the vanilla dominance. A little hot, and the sour note is offputting, but will probably age well."
"O: I really enjoyed this. Kentucky Bourbon Barrel Ale is fantastic and this gave it an interesting and tasty twist. Looks like they added the pumpkin and spices to an already great ale and let the chips fall where they may. The results were outstanding. Great brew for the season."
""
"O - I really appreciate the beer these guys are dishing out. Makes me proud of our state of Kentucky. There bourbon is awful and needs improvement, but hey if their bourbon is contributing barrels for brews like Pumpkin Barrel to be aged in then by all means keep pumping it out. But I won't be buying the bourbon. I will look for the Kentucky Pumpkin Barrel every Fall though"

"12 oz. bottle poured into a Columbus Beer Fess tasting glass from 2012...Orange amber clear appearance with a quickly fading 1/4 head....First impression--pumpkin spice and booze! Kinda what a pumpkin pie would taste like with a little Maker's added to it....Second impression--pretty much the same. Lots of pumpkin, nutmeg, caramel, vanilla, and BOURBON!! Thick in the mouth...not quite stoutish but definitely a full mouthful. Nutmeg on the frontend, pumpkin midway through, with a thoroughly pleasent booziness ending...YUM...Not quite in the league of Pumking, but now I have a second seasonal """go to""" beer. Careful on the 10% ABV....You could end up having a second or third and accidentally ending up drunk."

"12 ounce bottle. Served in a snifter, the beer pours a clear orange color with a thin quarter inch off-white head that fizzled away quickly. The brew smells like pumpkin spices, pumpkin, bourbon, vanilla and a bit of peppery spice. Taste is pretty much just like the aroma, it tastes like pumpkin spices, pumpkin, bourbon, vanilla, and a bit of coconut. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's slick and smooth and goes down easy. The 10% ABV is well hidden in this brew. It's very similar to their regular Bourbon Barrel Ale, but with some pumpkin and spices. I think it's a good overall brew. If you like their Bourbon Barrel Ale, then you will probably like this one too. $14.99 a 4-pack."

"10pct ABV is hidden reasonably well but some of the bourbon character bleeds off to make sure you know where this was aged."

"Kentucky Pumpkin Barrel Ale is a warm welcome to the palates of Central Kentucky and beyond. Where it shies away from the over-the-top intensity of other high gravity pumpkin ales, it has a subdued palate and profile that makes it highly drinkable compared to its high alcohol content. Dangerous from sip to finish!"
