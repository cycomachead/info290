4,-7,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours an amber hue with a translucent clarity.  Nose expresses nutmeg, clove, peppery notes and a hint of ethanol.  Taste consistent with nose - what I like about this beer is that the spice profile is not in your face. Mouthfeel is light-medium with an even carbonation and a slight acidity.  Overall, a solid pumpkin beer.  Generally not a style in my wheelhouse; however, I enjoyed this one.  Definitely in my top three for the style thus far.","Jwale73","Feb 20, 2015"

4.74,10.2,4.25,4.5,5,4.5,4.75,"Poured into a sniffer. Has a dark amber color with big aromas of pumpkin and spices. Mellow but present pumpkin flavor but most of the taste comes from a myriad of spices. Even gives off the flavor of being bourbon barrel aged and is rather alcoholic. This beer could use some aging to allow some more flavors to open up. (Like most pumpkin beers in my opinion). Nevertheless this is probably my second favorite pumpkin beer of all time and I thouroughly enjoyed drinking this beer.","barfootbandit","Jan 30, 2015"

Caramel, graham crusty malt, gord meat,cinnamon, nutmeg, clove and do I detect a hint of cream?!  Starts off with a nice vegetal gord meat flavor that is wrapped in caramel and graham flavors.  The spice weaves in early bringing a perfect level of cinnamon, clove and nutmeg spiciness.  Lower carbonation and the body feels slightly thin.  Overall it's a great pumpkin ale.  It's top two for me next to Pumking.","HopBomb515","Dec 10, 2014"

The nose is spice forward, but not distinctly pumpkin pie-like, instead it has a slightly cinnamon and bubble gum aroma. The taste has a similar bubble gummy/plastic spice presence, which dominates the sweet malty base and leaves little room for other expected pumpkin beer flavors i.e. caramelized sugars, vegetal gourd, grain, and yeast. Drinking this beer leaves the palate saturated by a medium-heavy bodied, boozy, punishing spice bomb. It's reasonably carbonated and sweet.

Easy to drink and the taste was great, I think I like Schlafly's pumpkin ale the best, followed by Elysian The Great Pumpkin, this, Pumking, and Alewerks Pumpkin Ale all slightly under it. Well worth checking out if you like the style.","mdfb79","Dec 16, 2013"

4.36,1.4,3.75,4.5,4.5,4,4.25,"Full bodied for the style with a nice balance of pumpkin pie sweetness and earthy, zesty spice notes. Strong organic tasting pumpkin and pumpkin purée/pie filling up front with prominent nutmeg, vanilla, brown sugar and allspice countered by a more musty, rustic spice profile that has hints of peppery clove, ginger, cinnamon and cardamom. There's a nice malt backbone giving off more sweetness with hints of caramel, toffee, toast and biscuit. Slight boozy sweetness in the finish but there is no heat at all. Drinks incredibly well for 8.5%. In addition to the complexity, there is incredible balance. The spice presence is really strong taming the pumpkin pie/dessert sweetness and there's just enough sweet malt and pumpkin character preventing it from feeling overwhelmingly spicy. I can see how this could be a bit too much for some but I think it's a great take on the style. One of the better examples of what a pumpkin beer can be.","corby112","Dec 07, 2013"

Aromas are crisp toast and caramel, vanilla and toffee, biscuits, and pumpkin puree, a bit sweeter with decent pie spice. Cinnamon, nutmeg, and more vanilla, caramel. Some crispness. Initial is medium bodied offering a touch more sweetness, vanilla and caramel blast, toffee and toast, gentle spice moves in, with cinnamon and brown sugar, toffee and biscuits. More pie spices and pumpkin puree, sweeter with caramelized malts, touches of sweetness dance, with just a hint of dryness. Fairly balanced for a sweeter beer, spice and vanilla, sweet malts. Finish is nice, gentle spice and sweetness linger. It’s not complex, but it’s tasty, sweet slanted without being anywhere near cloying. Fairly balanced. Very nice.","jbaker67","Sep 14, 2013"

In my current position in hot, humid Florida, probably not the best thing. A well made beer by CCB, probably one of the better ones they have to offer.

Lingering sweet vanilla cream and pumpkin is definite a highlight here. Finishes nice, medium carbonation. Would be even better if it weren’t 105 with the humidity outside.

The smell of the beer is sweet, some moderate spice notes and from what I can tell some of the freshest Pumpkin/Gourd aromas I've ever experienced from a beer. The taste of the beer is again sweet like the nose but balances out quite nicely with the subtle amount of spice that has been used. The mouthfeel of the beer is heavy, it's got a solid thickness to it, it's gently carbonated and goes down nice and smooth. Overall I really enjoyed this beer, one of the best Pumpkin beers I've had as of yet. I highly recommend this brew to anyone looking for something a little different to try than just a typical Pumpkin beer like most breweries are putting out. This one sets the bar pretty high in my opinion.","Knapp85","Sep 27, 2012"

For me, it kind of melded together a lot of elements of Schlafly Pumpkin (with the spice profile) and Pumking (with the buttery, whipped cream finish....without overdoing it as I feel Pumking sort of does).

Then I had it fresh the following release and it wasn't much different. Then that one again the following March. I swear a bit of age actually makes it better, counterintuitively. It isn't one I'd want to session all night given the specialty flavors involved, but as a special seasonal, a 375ml is nice. Usually I'm a few sips in to a pumpkin beer before it starts to feel like a chore to get through it, but this one is nice.

The nose hits with nutmeg, a dry vegetal pumpkin quality, cinnamon candy and baking spices - it is very much like pumpkin pie, spices are prevalent with almost a creamy pie crust scent. The nose is what gets me - multilayered complex chocolate notes - this beer looks like Theobroma and drinks like what Theobroma wishes it could be. Straight pumpkin pie in the mouth, full of spices and rich pumpkin flavor that finishes with nice carbonation and a dry vegetal quality at the end. Almost a touch astrigent on the finish and not a huge fan of the vegetal quality it presents but this is by far and away the best pumpkin beer i have had.","Trilogy31","Oct 10, 2011"

The nose carried a lot of squash and pumpkin with a bit of cinnamon and miscellaneous spice in the background. The flavor didn't have quite as much spice and really focused on the squash element. Not too sweet, which was nice. Chewy medium body with moderate carbonation and a bit of spice zest in the finish. Good brew.","Thorpe429","Oct 01, 2011"

Moderately sweet, the brown sugar/molasses character comes out nicely. Taste is similar to the nose, but with a very pronounced pumpkin flavor. This is probably the most """pumkin-y""" Pumpkin Beer I've had in a while, it's definitely more pumpkin then spice.

I like pumpkin ales a lot but after having a few pumple Drumkin , this just blows it out of the water and I had thought it was only mediocre on the low side.

Taste: pretty close to a liquid bite of pumpkin pie with a little whipped cream on it. The pumpkin is the star but with ample doses of nutmeg, allspice, and cinnamon, and a little clove in the finish.

There is also some toasty malted aroma. Off the bat I can taste warm and toasted malts, some roasted squash flavor coupled with a good hit of vanilla. Mid palate all the way to the finish is freshly ground pumpkin pie spices. A tad cloying but not really too sweet just a really full bodied, full flavored pumpkin ale.
