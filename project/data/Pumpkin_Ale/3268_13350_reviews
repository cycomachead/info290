"Tastes strongly of pumpkin and spices. If you are looking for a subtle spice taste then this might not be for you."

"Nose is like pumpkin pie with a spicy gourd and creamy scent. The flavor  emulates the nose but with a slightly thin texture. The cinnamon and nutmeg are  strong with a bit of peppery spice. The creamy gourd like flavor gives one the impression of pureed pumpkin. Very nice  pumpkin ale especially for the price."

"Pumpkin Pie in a bottle. I am absolutely obsessed with fall and plan to drink one of these each day of October. I love it!"

"Another beer courtesy of the legendary woodychandler. Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a orange/brownish color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of pumpkin, some mild spices. Taste is good, pumpkin, nutmeg, subtle spices, very easy drinking and refreshing. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall this beer was not overspiced as many pumpkin beers are, tasty and enjoyable."

"The Crack! was nice and loud and the inverted Glug went beautifully, producing two fingers of dense, light-orangish head that put me in mind of the froth on an Orange Julius. Do they even make those any more? Color was a cloudy orangish-amber (SRM = > 17, < 22). Nose seemed heavily dosed with nutmeg, although I could also smell cinnamon in the mix. The mouthfeel was kind of thin, but I liked that they had not overdone it with the spices so that the malt had a chance to come through. I was reminded of a Christmas cookie, spiced, but with a bready quality, also. Finish was semi-sweet, the result of the admixture of the spices with the malts. It was not the best version of the style that I tried over the course of the season, but neither was it the worst."
"Overall - A pretty good pumpkin beer, has the right flavors, but on the lighter side. Would be easy to knock back a few of these, nearly sessionable. A decent representative of the style."
""
""
"Cheers"
""
"Overall, this is a pretty solid pumpkin ale. Nothing especially different or unique, but I enjoy that it is not over-spiced like other pumpkin beers."
""
"O- The nose is absolutely stunning. One of the better pumpkin beers i have had. Could go for more complexity with a stronger presence of nutmeg, cinnamon, and brown sugar. Overall though, its hard to complain."
""
"I love this time of year... the colors, the weather (usually), and the pumpkin beer! While this isn't my favorite, it's a close second behind Southern Tier's Pumpking. For me though, this one has a one-up on Pumpking - it's availability. Easy to obtain, easy to session, and easy to love."

"O'Fallon Pumpkin Beer ---3.5/5"
""
""
"Overall Drinkability: An ok beer, but I'm pumpkin'd out."
""
"Pours a clear orange with a thin tan head. Smells like pumpkin pie spice. Taste begins with some pumpkin puree, then some biscuit, then a bit of cinnamon, and finishes with an earthy tartness. The mouthfeel is pretty good. Overall a pretty good pumpkin beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The balance of spices in a mild amber ale make for an enjoyable drink. This is one of the best pumpkins I've had this year out of about 5 or 6 breweries. O'Fallon continues to please."
"O- Pleasantly surprised by this one. Well balanced, and authentiic pumpkin flavor, as opposed to only pumpkin spice flavors that most carry. Would definitely buy again if given the opportunity."
""
"Pours a burnt orange with a one finger head that fades quickly. Smells great! You really get the sense of fall from the aroma. Goes down smooth with a pumpkin pie taste. A little sticky on the tongue with little to no aftertaste. Overall, it's not bad. A decent fall beer. Not the best flavored beer I've had but there's not too much I can complain about here. I would recommend it to anyone wanting to try something new."
"The look is lacking, but the taste is amazing. A must have for this time of year."
""
""
""
""
""

"Brown in color with good clarity. There is good carbonation but the head quickly dissipates. Aroma is heavily pumpkin pie spices. I also get a bit of cinnamon and faint nutmeg. Mouthfeel is smooth, but fairly carbonated. The taste is very much pumpkin pie spice with a bit of cinnamon. It's a bit fleeting and then gone. I appreciate the lack of coriander, but this isn't as good as I had remembered."
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a decent pumpkin offering, The aroma is fantastic on this one, but it doesn't deliver after that. Still, would probably pick this up again once a year."

"(O)- An absolutely awesome pumpkin beer that could be one of the best if they just made this a bit thicker; it would really drive this one home. As it stands, its just a bit watery feel-wise for me."

"Appears copper orange in the body with a cream khaki head flowing thick, unexpected spice comes up and hits me in the face. Pumpkin spice including the clove, vanilla, and nutmeg notes usually only found in a pumpkin pie. Flavor is straight spice minimal malts from the base beer this relies heavily on the spice additions minimal hints of gourd that may or may not have been there for the brewing process. Body is medium the carbonation is flowing thick in this beer, I'm actually amazed by the pumpkin and spice combo compared to other standard abv versions I'm getting a fuller bodied creamy carbonation pretty solid but still not something I would seek out."

"Overall - nice fun beer. Hopefully it opens up a bunch when it warms up"

"O - This was my top pick from last year's pumpkin beers tied with Wolavers, and this year it doesnt disappoint, I still find it much better than Pumpking. If you're into pumpkin seasonals, this is worth having, the aroma is good, and there's a nice complexity here."
"Mouthfeel: a little too much carbonation for my taste, and a little too sticky to boot."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: At $9.99 a six pack, I'm disappointed. It's not bad, but with so many pumpkin ales out there, I hoped that this would be more bold with bigger pumpkin flavors, stronger spices, and a slightly thicker mouthfeel. I won't buy this again. It being August, I'm not so upset that the beer is as light as it is, but I wouldn't like this too much in November."

"This pours a clear, light copper color with only a slight head. There is a scent of pumpkin and spice but it is rather mild. The taste is rather simple as far as pumpkin beers go. There is a raw pumpkin flavor with a few pie and clove spices. This brew drinks fairly light and smooth. The after taste is a little metallic. There could be some improvement in the pumpkin and spice flavors though. Fairly average."

"Not too much carbonation - overall a decent choice if you're looking for a fall inspired drink."

"Poured from standard 12oz bottle. Was medium to medium dark copper in color with a slightly off-white head, but was a very small head. Seemed quite carbonated. Had a slight pumpkin smell but not much at all. The pumpkin didn't really come through in the taste. It was way too subtle and seemed watered down. Just an average or slightly below average pumpkin beer."
""
""
"Overall, about what I'd expect for a pumpkin beer. The aroma is really good, probably one of the best traits of this brew."
""
""
"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled 6/10/2012. Pours lightly hazy golden orange color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of fresh pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, clove, brown sugar, bread, and herbal. Damn nice aromas with good strength and balance; very authentic. Taste of pumpkin, biscuit, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, clove, brown sugar, caramel, and herbal. Lingering notes of caramel, biscuit, spices, and brown sugar on the finish for a bit. Good robustness of flavor with decent balance; spices are not overdone at all. Minimal cloying sweet flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy and slick mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with almost zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a really good pumpkin ale. Taste did not live up to the aromas; but it was well balanced and very drinkable. Definitely enjoyed this, and it is a nice example of the style."
""
""
""
""
"Overall not bad, I didn't expect much, a bit flat and doesn't do a whole lot, too much cinnamon and sugar that overpowers almost everything else."

"O- Not too bad. This one is on the lighter side as far as Pumpkin Ales go, but it's still worth trying. Got to support Missouri Brewers!"
""
""
"O: overall a great pumpkin ale; one of the best tasting I have had thus far"
"Edit: 13-AUG-13: Bottle dated 30-JUL-13. 2013 vintage is superior to 2012 vintage. Cloudier, slightly heavier body, significantly more spice. Still on the lighter side of the style, but a lot less spritzy. An excellent choice."

"Mouthfeel- very light in the mouth, the beer seems to move over the tongue with ease, the bubbles cause it to feel lighter than it is"

"Nothing special about this, but very pleasant. I hate when a pumpkin beer is overspiced and this one is definitely subtle which I appreciate."

"Overall-- this is the best tasting pumpkin beer I have had... The other ratable aspects need a little help, but this is certainly worth getting if you like pumpkin beers!"
"Cheers!"
"D: This is a great pumpkin beer.  I love a pumpkin beer that can balance the pumpkin and the spices, and this one balanced the two better than any other I've had this year.  If the mouthfeel was better (carbonation lower), this would be really drinkable.  Unfortunately, not the case.  That's ok, though, because this is the best one I've had this year to date.  Trying a good bit tomorrow though, so we'll see how it holds up."
"Good stuff! I wasn't expecting a lot from this beer, but it delivered the goods. And while this is not a *rich* beer, I don't think I've found another one that so accurately captures the profile of actual pumpkin pie. And it's not over-saturating - I think I could put away a few of these."
"A fairly light, sweet pumpkin ale. I don't really appreciate this version of the style: there's not enough malt backbone and it's sweetness hits overkill."
"Overall- Obvious changes need to be made, like making the nose a better representation of the taste profiles."
"O- This is a sleeper pumpkin beer, IMO. I love this style and have tracked down quite a few this season and this beer blew away my expectations the most this far because I want expecting much. Would come back to this again... Actually, I will pick up a 6pk my next drive through KY!"
"O: Not bad at all. Pumpkin ales tend to be an acquired taste, and in terms of quality, they are often hit or miss. This is one of the better and more readily available pumpkin ales on the market. I can't see myself drinking more than one at a time, but I definitely wouldn't turn it down, especially on a cool autumn day."
"Overall: Not a bad beer in and of itself, but also not what I'm looking for in a pumpkin ale. Too light in body (not enough malt), and not enough robust spiciness. This one would be interesting to trying side-by-side with Schlafly Pumpkin Ale. Probably quite a contrast."
"Morey's Bottom Line: This isn't a """must have""" for me, but it's certainly drinkable and pretty enjoyable too. I would recommend this as an introduction into the style."
"O'Fallon Pumpkin pours out a hazy bronze color with a head of fine bubbles which gives way quickly into fine carbonation bubbles around the edges of the glass. True to O'Fallon's design, this beer smells of rich pumpkin pie with very light hints of nutmeg and clove in the background. The beer's taste changes throughout the drink. As soon as the beer hits your tongue, you'll be greeted by sweet pumpkin and malt tastes. In the middle of that drink you'll feel a pop of the pumpkin spices, most notably the cinnamon. Then on the very end of the swallow, the beer rounds off nicely again with sweet malts and pumpkin. With only 11 IBUs of hop bitterness, don't expect this beer to be anything less than a malt and pumpkin show-piece. What's more, With a mouthfeel that is relatively light and an approachable 5.6% ABV, this is a great 'sessionable' pumpkin beer."
"Pours a slightly hazy orangish amber color with a one finger head which recedes to nothing with very little lace. The aroma is of pumpkins and nutmeg with a hint of cinnomon. The taste comes out with a nice pumpkin flavor with a hint of nutmeg and cinnomon. Not as complex as some of the others and not a big a flavor as others, but enjoyable. The mouthfeel was moderately carbonated but missing something. Overall the beer was solid, it wasn't best in class but a good pumpkin beer."
"The mouthfeel is borderline disappointing, it doesn't have the full creaminess of a nice mealy pumpkin pie. Maybe I should just get off my ass and make a pumpkin pie then. That being said, this is an ok pumpkin brew. It scratches my jack-o-lantern soup itch, but doesn't dig in and scrape it out."
"O - I Picked this up at the grocery for $1.50, and seeing the twist-top bottle gave me the notion I was going to get something similar to the blue moon harvest pumpkin which I sampled not too long ago. However this beer does the style justice. Its a great example of a pumpkin beer at a good price."
"Overall this is a pretty impressive pumpkin ale that is easier drinking than many of its counterparts. I am not a huge fan of the super spiced versions of this style, so it suited me quite well."
"With thanks to nlabruyere got to try this one from a fresh batch. Been on a pumpkin ale kick and have had many to compare this to. This one has the typical orangy brown appearance. It looks thin has a small amount of white head that quickly disappears. Aroma is cinnamon, nutmeg, clove and pumpkin. The best part of this brew is the authentic pumpkin in the flavor which is more apparent as the beer warms. This is pumpkin with accompanying spices rather than the opposite which sadly is typically the norm for the style. Mouthfeel is thin but has some mild creaminess. I'd love to try an oaked version of this. This is above average for the style fo sho."
"Not a bad brew. Definitely a step above most pumpkin beers I have tried."
"Overall: O'Fallon's pumpkin ale is lightyears away from Schlafly's. I live in Saint Louis, and so I will always get Schlafly's Pumpkin before I get this one. Fairly drinkable and a noble effort but it just writes a check in the nose that the taste can't cash."
"O: not super impressive. I would be interested in trying another pumpkin beer soon cause I really like the idea. Unfortunately, this beer has officially turned me off to O’Fallen’s, there 5 IPA wasn’t as good as advertised and this beer wasn’t good"
"O: An enjoyable pumpkin ale. I feel the Schlafly Pumpkin Ale is much superior as far as the local offerings go, but this one is more drinkable and better suited for sitting around the fire pit while passing out candy to trick-or-treaters."
"O: O'Fallon's Pumpkin Beer is an upper-middle class entry into the style. It's also one of the few pumpkin ales that I could have more then one of in a sitting. If you enjoy the pumpkin offerings, I wouldn't think twice of picking up a sixer on a chilly, autumn afternoon."
"Overall, nicely balanced pumpkin beer. Probably one of the better ones I've had. Not over-spiced. Would love a little more body of this thing, but I won't complain too much. Will drink again."
"Mouthfeel is a little clingy with a slight pumpkin pie flavor and an off dry finish. Not bad, not complex, perfect drinking beer for the season. Nice balance and pleasant."
"O: One of the best pumpkin beers I've ever had. Everything is there from the pumpkin pie spice, the malty character, and the carbonation. And the most important part is that they are all well balanced."
"All in all, a respectable, refreshing beer. However, if you want a good pumpkin beer, you should look elsewhere. In my opinion, this stuff simply isn't in the same league as Schlafly's."
"Mouthfeel and Overall - Light to medium bodied. Heavily carbonated. Spot-on tasty pumpkin. Pleasant and smooth with great spices added in."
"Overall: It's a pumpkin beer. Really delicious if you like pumpkins, which I do, but it does leave a bit to be desired. I love O'Fallons in general, and what they do, but I think a bit more perfecting would bring this beer up to an A. And even as it is it's one of my favorite pumpkin beers available."
"O: A better job than most pumpkin ales I have tried. Still not great...but I like O'Fallon overall and this one is a decent effort."
"The taste starts with pumpkin followed by some spices. The aftertaste has a nice pumpkin desert like taste. The mouthfeel is nice and smooth and full of flavor and overall this is a very good beer that is a must this fall and every fall in the future."
"O: Dogfish's Pun'kin Ale is my standard for this style, and this is not that. That said, it's solid, and decently drinkable for the style. If someone handed me a slice of pumpkin pie to go along with one of these, I'd be content."
"SOLID, NOT A MUST HAVE!"
"O - Not too bad. There are however several other pumpkin beers that I like better that I would buy before I bought this one again."
"Overall: A great dessert beer and a great fall beer. I am definitely picking up a six-pack of this when the harvest moon rolls through. VERY tasty, and well done."
"O/D- This is a tasty beer, one that I'm enjoying immensely. Easy to drink un the summer, though its making me ling for hoodie weather and cool weather runs. Pumpkin beer deux."
"D/O- Easy drinking pumpkin beer right here. Really packs the flavor into its (relatively) tiny ABV. Appearance leaves something to be desired, minor ding. Recommended to those who may have given up on the style."
"This is an easy drinking pumkin beer, with flavors that blend pretty well."
"This beer came out of a 12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass. It developed some head, but head retention was minimal. The beer is slightly hazy but not totally untypical for a Pumpkin Ale. The color of the ale was a copper to slightly orange like hue. In my opinion, the perfect color for a Pumpkin Ale. The ale has an aroma of Pumpkin Pie spices, most of which is nutmeg but there are hints of cinnamon and clove. I would prefer a bit more aroma by using more spice, but at any rate its very nice. The beer it self has excellent mouthfeel, very light and easy to drink. When drinking this you immediately get the pumpkin pie spice but it disappears too quickly and finishes with a slightly caramel taste. This is a tough beer to brew and there are so few """excellent""" pumpkin ales on the market. O'fallon did a good job of carefully balancing hops with the spices. This is one of the best Pumpkin Ales that i have had to date, but I would like to see more of a bold spice taste. This is a safe beer, but O'fallon should be proud of it- It knocks the socks of of AB's mass produced version. I will be buying this again! Prost!"
"This is simply a very good pumpkin ale."
"It has a STRONG spice flavor and a LOT of pumpkin flavor and a LOT of alcohol kick. I liked it but I wouldn't want to drink it every day. It was great for Thanksgiving and I drank a six-pack over the Thanksgiving week. Would I buy more? Not right now, but next year I would probably buy more."
"D-Go into this one planning on drinking an amber ale and you'll be fine but from a pumpkin ale standpoint it falls short."
"Taste is buttered pumpkin pie and not quite as bad as the nose as there is a slight sweetness that, when combined with a tad bit of pumpkin, actually reminds me a bit of candy corn. On the other hand, this might ruin candy corn for me. The feel is quite bad and creamy. I can't stomach much of this. Drainpour and...F."
"Fairly middle of the road for pumpkin ales, in my opinion. It could use to be bolder."
"Pours an ever-so-slightly hazy gold with a tan head. Carbonated OK. Smell is mineral and pumpkin, with a hint of sweetness and a sharp spiciness. Taste is very well-rounded; I really like the fact that I taste more pumpkin than spices. The finish is dry and smooth, with more pumpkin flavor and a nice dash of cinnamon right at the end. Drinkability is as easy as eating a piece of pumpkin pie.. All in all, my favorite pumpkin ale I've sampled yet."
"I poured into a pint glass to half a finger of off white head. This beer is orange/amber in color. The smell is caramel malt with pumpkin spice. The initial taste is pumpkin pie. It later fades to caramel malt. It is an alright beer. It's worth a try."
"D- Never again. It just is too mediocre to really want again. I can think of half a dozen other pumpkin beers I'd like to have in its place and that is just off the top of my head. Too many errors and things need fixing that I addressed above."
"D - A decent pumpkin beer, lacking in depth, but easy enough to drink. I certainly wouldn't turn it down if offered."
"Too off to make this easy to put away."
"This beer pours like any other beer and looks like any other beer but unfortunately thats where it ends. It has a bad smell, but i don't like pumpkins so ultimately this beer review may not be fair. The smell of pumpkin and spice is over whelming, and not good. Taste is not as overpowering as the smell, and if i hold my nose and drink it isn't nearly as bad. Overall i really dont like it at all, it stinks, but to be fair to o'falllon i dont like fruit/vegetable beers."
"FYI, the current label has a cartoon jack-o-lantern on it."
"Drinks about average. There are other pumpkins I like better, but this one's not bad at all."
"The pumpkin character is great in this beer. But it is just dragged down my everything else about the beer. I think this beer tried too hard to be the next Pumking, and it just comes off in an awkward fashion."
"D: Good, but not amazing. Lots of pumpkin flavor, but the bit of tang in it seems out of place to me."
"Nice pumpkin and spice aromas with this hazy light orange brew. I let this one warm a bit and the flavors came through more fully. Well balanced pumpkin, spice, malts and hops with this one. Quite easy to drink and enjoy. Another fine midwest Pumpkin brew! Thanks to trader Birchstick for this one. Cheers!"
"This is a pretty drinable beer and is not to sweet or cloying as some of these beers can be."
"D - One of the easier pumpkin ales I've had to drink but it's not because of the taste."
"Cheers!"
"D: Drinkable if one can tolerate the taste."
"Mouth feel is medium in body, mildly carbonated, slightly creamy, and a hint of oily slickness."
"D - Ya couldn't get the whole bottle down, just screams cheaply made to me."
"D: Not overly assertive like other pumpkin ales makes this much more drinkable than some examples I have tried in the past. I could drink a few of these without becoming too overbearing,"
"D - As far as pumpkin goes, pretty darned tasty."
"The O'Fallon pumpkin pours a hazy amber-orange color with minimal head and no noticeable lacing. Nose is mostly thanksgiving spices consisting of nutmeg, cinnamon, and pumpkin. Some hoppy aromas round out the smell. Taste consists of light pumpkin pie and cinnamon. Not as in your face as other pumpkin ales. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and drinkability is mediocre. This beer is only meant for about a 2 month window of the year when consumers are in the fall/turkey day mood. But compared to other pumpkin ales, I believe it is very competitive."
"Drinkability - Very drinkable. Doesn't fatigue the taste buds as quickly as most pumpkin beers. And at 5.5% ABV you can enjoy several at a sitting."
"Drinkability: I've definitely had better that would be much more worth my time and money."
"Overall, this is certainly a decent pumpkin beer. Not mind-blowing, but I may get another 6-pack this season."
"D- Very easy to drink and will not disappoint"
"drinkability is great @ 5.5av with this kind of taste puts right up there with the best of them imo"
"Pours a cloudy, brown color. 1/4 inch head of a white color. Poor retention and poor lacing. Smells of yeast, pumpkin, slight hops, and slight spice. Fits the style of a Pumpkin Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with a low carbonation level. Tastes of pumpkin, yeast, slight spice, and slight hops. Overall, rather watery and not full-bodied."
"d= an average pumpkin ale that does not contain a lot of cinnamon/nutmeg flavors."
"Cloudy orange body with off white head which was a little thick. Smell was sweet with a good amount of cinnamon, not very strong though. Taste was good, pumpkin pie with a decent cinnamon/spice flavor. Pumpkin taste really came out more once it warmed up a little. This is a really decent pumpkin beer."
"D - a downright delicious and drinkable beer, quickly becoming one of my favorite styles."
"D - This are very easy to drink and make me anticipate the upcoming holiday season."
"A hazy light copper color pour with a small white head that fades rather quickyl , medium carbonation , a little spotty lacing. Aroma is lightly sweet with notes of pumpkin , cinnamon,nutmeg,cloves ( as promised) a hint of toasted grain and if you let it warm you get this faint hint of baked pie crust , very subtle . Flavor is rather light a nice blend of light malt and punkin pie , a little kiss of hops , little if any bitterness , very balanced . Nice bubbly mouthfeel , light body . Very sessionable I would say . Not my favorite style , but a good brew and a fun try ."
"Drinkability: Very good pumpkin beer! Everything is very well balanced, worth the purchase, reminds me that my favorite season is just around the corner! Karen loves this beer! Im still a bigger fan of Pumpking by Southern Tier. For these specialty beers, I want more meat in there, more body, more flavor, more in your face, since Im only going to have one at a time. With all of the bad pumpkin beers out there, this one is pretty special!"
"D: I love this. I could drink this - slowly - all night long. This is a really fine example of a fall seasonal beer. Of all the pumpkin ales out there this year, don't pass this one up!!"
"Mouthfeel: Fizzy and smooth."
"hands down one of my favorite pumpkin ales. they nailed it this year! very much reminds me of pumpkin pie and thanksgiving. its august, and i will now be annoyed that i have to wait 3 months. damn it all."
"Blipped """Ghouls Night Out""" by The Misfits"
"Drinkability: A nicely balanced, easy-drinking pumpkin ale, though I fear I may be becoming overly acclimated to the bolder, heftier pumpkin ales (e.g., Weyerbacher Imperial Pumpkin, Southern Tier Pumking). Still though, this is pleasant. Also, congrats to little Jimmy Bungler of Ms. McKenzie's 1st grade class of Ferguson, Missouri, who's winning submission provided the artwork for the label. Way to go, Jimmy!"
"Third beer of the night and felt that half was enough to qualify for a review. Drinkability about average."
"Drinks okay, this is a style is really starting wear on me, only bigger versions of this seem to do much for me. Just another run of the mill pumpkin beer. Will try earlier in the season if given the opportunity"
"Serving type: bottle"
"I find this one to be quite drinkable. Most likely by mass audiences, with the right marketing."
"D: It's going down fine, but I'm not terribly inspired to have another."
"Hazy pumpkin copper body with golden edges. Little finger of gauzy, sticky, egg-shell white head. Good lacing. Caramel and cookie malt aromas mix with pecan pie, butter rum, nutmeg, cinnamon, and a decent wallop of cloves. Toasted malt and spices up front. Slight metallic hop flavor somewhere in there. Pulpy, pumpkin pie filling taste develops, complete with buttery crust, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Slightly tart twang in the background. Light honey sweetness in the finish. Not bad. Maybe a prototypical pumpkin beer, which is not my favorite style (I tend to prefer the higher abv examples due to the bigger, sweeter malt backbone)."
"Drinkability: It is not my favorite beer of this style but it unique and I like that. If I was not in the mood for desert style pumpkin beer this would be what I'd choose."
"Drinkability: A little bit light on the flavor and aroma side. Was hoping for more, but still a pretty decent beer."
"12 ounce bottle. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours an orange/amber color with about an inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both average. The aroma is nice, it smells like pumpkins, nutmeg and cloves. It's not too spicy, there's a good mix between the pumpkin and spice which makes the aroma enjoyable. The taste is similar to the aroma, however there's initially a slight tart/sour flavor which does go away after the beer warms up a bit. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, carbonation is good. Drinkability is decent as well, it's smooth and easy to drink. Overall I think it's a decent pumpkin beer, but not my favorite brew in the style, either. With that being said, I would pick this up again in the future."
"All in all, this is a really good beer. For the season, I haven't had many better."
"mouthfeel is light but with heavy flavors, easy to drink, a nice pumpkin ale overall"
"Without having ever had a pumpkin beer it's hard to compare, but I would have to say this is either flat or just flat out bad. Bad may be a bit strong, it's not like Bud Light or anything."
"Pours a hazy orange-ish/ copper color with a light tan head. IN the aroma, nutmeg, clove, and big cinnamon. In the taste, kind of bland nutmeg and a dry cinnamon. A spice bite and a medium mouthfeel, with a dry nutmeg/ spice aftertaste. Great nose, yet light in flavor, quite dry and big spices."
"D - this is a pretty good pumpkin ale, with ale being emphasized. I will probably buy some more of this, but I have to give the nod to Schlafly for being my favorite local pumpkin ale. However, this is definitely recommended for this style."
"D= Not a bad ale, and my only serious criticism is the poor aroma. Kudos to O'Fallon for attempting to not overpower the ale flavors with spices."
"I really like this, to me its pretty much the perfect pumpkin Ale. However the only thing I would change is the amount of actual Pumpkin flavor. It needs cranked up a notch!"
"This isn't the most dynamic or amazing Pumpkin Ale, but it's highly drinkable, and none of the spicing is overwhelming, which is the downfall of many of these ales. I'll definitely try this one again!"
"D- Very drinkable."
"Drinkability is low to moderate. Flavor is unimpressive. Really not quite what it should be. Beer is sessionable, but consuming more than one would seem to be a horrible idea. Not my favorite O'Fallon brew."
"Very drinkable due to the aforementioned balance. This is one of my favorite examples of the style and something i will be looking for come fall. Much more sessionable than many examples of the style due to the near perfect spice balance, with just the slightest touch of nutmeg. The abv also compares favorably for sessioning versus bigger examples like the Punkin Ale. This is some good stuff from O'Fallon."
"I see that it is now available in Cans - another one for the Want list"
"Slightly hazed copper color. Slight head. Aroma is of muted spice. Spicey flavor-nutmeg and cloves. Faint pumpkin taste. Somewhat malty flavor. Ok enough mouthfeel for the style. Very average as far as pumpkin beers go. I still enjoy trying as many as possible to find the right one."
"base or the liquid ingredient in beer can turkey. It had to be tried though. Meh."
"d: Spiced beers are all about balance and this one is balanced quite well. Quite drinkable. Unlike some pumpkin beers, this one actually tastes like pumpkin, not just the spices associated with it. Maybe its just that its brewed close and therefore always fresh or that the selection in my area isn't very good, but every fall this one sticks out as one of the best Pumpkin brews. So many of them are just way too spiced."
"D - A middle of the pack pumpkin ale, or maybe a little better than average."
"Decent enough, its better from the draught. A fine fall brew that makes for an all right transition to the maltier marzen lagers and bocks of fall."
"Overall- Maybe not my favorite of the pumpkin ales, but not bad either."
"Drinkability-2to3 and i would have to change it up"
"Medium in build with a flaccid, pasty feel. It's bland enough yet to drink quickly. But it's flawed and not worth a revisit."
"Note: Since this has a sort of mulled-cider vibe, I tried heating half of a bottle up in a coffee up. Don't do this....it tastes like puke! I don't think that this has a high enough ABV or something."
"Dark orange-bronze color with very little to no head. I see very small floaters lofting around in my glass. Maybe I just grabbed a dirty glass out of the cupboard. Smells good. Like Pumpkin pie. Pumpkins, nutmeg, cloves. The taste isn't too overwhelming. It smells stronger than it tastes. It feels a little watery and flat in the mouth. This is a Thanksgiving/Halloween novelty beer that I could have a couple of during those times of year. But I wouldn't want to drink this beer in any quantity. It's OK."
"D - If you like pumpkin beers this one is very drinkable. Outside of Schlafly, I haven't found one I can really get behind yet."
"Basically pumpkin pie in a bottle - very nice and smooth with the dominant pumpkin flavor from beginning to end. there's a little cinnamon aroma with a bit of carbonation but not at all overdone. O'Fallon Pumpkin Ale just gets better and better every year. I need to hold onto a six pack of this for Thanksgiving!"
"Well done, O'Fallon. This is one of my favorite pumpkin ales."
"Drinkability tapered off quickly."
"Overall, THE best pumpkin beer I've ever had. Exactly what you would expect and want. Highly Recommended."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: The brew is medium bodied with moderate to light carbonation. Texture of carbonation is fine. I believe that the spices used in this brew cause it it have a semi-dry finish. This is a beer I'd drink again, however I much prefer Dogfish Head's Punkin' Ale over this one. Still, a good beer though."
"D- What a treat. This was really impressive. It's a shame these kinds of beers aren't more popular."
"The color was inviting, but the smell was immediatley cinnamon and spice. The taste was immediate hot cinnamon like red hots of schnapps. The cinnamon overpowered any malt or hops. If there was pumpkin it too was buried in cinnamon. I am a guy who loves cinnamon and use it every chance I get when cooking and baking, but the beer had no balance. I will try it again and would encourage others who enjoy fruit based beers to give it a try. Hopefully the spices can be tamed down and the beer can shine through, much like there other styles do so well."
"Light to medium bodied. Not a bad drinker. Plain and simple. I like this one because it doesnt have the overwhelming pumpkin pie taste of some pumpkin ales Ive tried."
"The delightful, softly spicy nose of O'Fallons pumpkin ale is a good indication of what you'll find within its clear orange body and creamy yellowed-white head. It's not overdone with spice, and has an actual pumpkin flavor to it amidst its gently sweet malt components. Cinnamon seems to stand out as far as the spicing goes, appearing first and last on the palate, but the clove comes on strong across the middle, and the nutmeg is clearly visible in the finish. Remarkably well-balanced and drinkable!"
"Bottle courtesy of Northyorksammy: Poured a light yellow/redish color ale with a big foamy head with average retention but good lacing. Aroma of cinnamon and cloves is about medium with some light pumpkin. Taste of cinnamon and cloves dominated the taste and was well balance with some light pumpkin. Light body with some good carbonation. Overall, I thought this was a well done pumpkin beer but probably not up to par with the Weyerbacher one which I still think is the best of the style."
"Pours a clear amber/brown with no head to speak of. Aroma is a nice blend of nutmeg, clove, and cinnamon, as expected. Cinnamon dominates the flavor, with the nutmeg taking a backseat. Lighter body than expected from a pumpkin ale. On the dry side. Ok pumpkin ale. A bit dry for my liking, but a nice blend of spice in the nose and not overwhelming in the taste."
"I preferred the flavors while colder. Well balanced and an easy drinker for the season."
"Cheers for this one Joe. Much appreciated."
"Not a bad beer, just a 'could be better' beer."
"Taste is malty and carbonated, with an accent of spice. Bottle lists cinnamon, clove, and nutmeg, which don't all resonate distinctly. Not to pick it apart, the spice element is reserved, and it lends itself greatly to the mouthfeel and drinkability. Carbonation is average, this one is easily sessionable. I've had three today already, and could have another. Good autumn seasonal..."
"Pours a slightly hazy medium orange color with virtually no head. Good carbonation. Nose is terrific ... cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and pumpkin ... slightly doughy, like a good pie. Palate is consistent with the nose ... nice spiciness and malt sweetness. Have a slight """bite""" that I like ... ginger-like. This one is well balanced. Mouthfeel is maybe slightly thin, but good over all. Residual spiciness lingers on the tongue. Slightly sweet finish. This is a very drinkable pumpkin ale. One of the better ones I've had. Another very good offering from O'Fallon ... I just wish they had better labels ... the jack-o-lantern, like the Wheach label, just looks a little silly. Bad labels, good beer."
"O'Fallon Pumpkin Ale is a very nice all-rounder in a style that often suffers from too much or too little. I'll have to check my reviews, but I don't believe that I've had a better pumpkin ale from a Midwestern brewer. Bottom line: this one is easily good enough to warrant a sixer every autumn."
"The body is good and a bit low off the carbonation. Overall I really that this was a great seasonal beer. A unique flavor with more of a pumpkin appeal then a more traditional pumpkin ales."
"This beer pours a clear copper color with a small white head. Aroma is slightly sweet. The pumpkin pie aroma is present, though subdued. Flavor slightly sweet and clean like a lager with a hint of pumpkin spice. Not really special, but better than a number of pumpkin beers I've tried. Mouthfeel is smooth with a light carbonation. Definitely drinkable, but somewhat forgettable as well."
"Taste was spice atop a sour taste. Actually, pretty pleasant. I enjoyed the sour-spice relationship more, the more I drank, although I didn't especially want another one. A large amount of sediment was also left in the bottom of my glass."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer seems to have a vaguely buttery/ oily mouthfeel. This adds to the enjoyment of drinking the beer as it makes the flavors last longer. This is a dam fine pumpkin ale and I could see kicking back several of these in an evening."
"Received this 12oz bottle from Vancer in BIF46. Pale orange/tan color with a slight chill haze, barely any head, and weak carbonation. Weak aroma with only a hint of cinnamon and nutmeg spiciness. The taste is lightly sweet, with mild pumpkin spice followed by the tiniest bitter finish. Nothing too exciting here. The mouthfeel ran a bit thin, with just enough carbonation to make it drinkable. Overall this pumpkin ale didn't have much to offer. It's very light, and the classic pumpkin and spice flavors are too weak. It might be worth a try as a festive fall beer, bu any other time of year I think I would pass..."
"Notes: Decent, but too """busy""" on the palate."
"D- This beer doesn't have any overpowering pumpkin spice flavors infact it has very faint spice flavors. The flavor is pretty boring and bland with not much malt flavor or other characters."
"This was a really bad, boring beer."
"One of my top two of this style. If you like pumpkin beers, then this is a must try."
"Only my second pumpkin ale of the season, and the first I have ever had this particular offering. Color is a hazy amber with a none too impressive head. Smell is mildly spiced. Nothing really in your face. Taste also, fails to really impress. Not enough of a spice impact. I'm not asking for something huge, just something palateable. Mouthfeel is the real downfall for me with this beer. Too """watery""" or thin. Drinkablity is fine if the mouthfeel is not an issue, but it is with me. I have a second in the fridge that I plan on passing on to an unlucky visitor."
"Dull, faded orange. Thin off white head. Lace is minimal. Nice aroma of sweet pumpkin pulp. Not a lot of spicing going on the nose, but that's alright. Too many overspiced pumpkin ales on the market. The spicing comes through a little more on the palate. Cinamon and ginger lightly compliment the nice round pumpkin flavor. This is one of the better pumpkin beers I've had. Malts add some sweetness without cloying it up. Full body and flavorful. Nice beer."
"Sent to me from czoch75, thanks!! Pours a hazy orange color. Smells of spices like cinnamon and cloves. Tastes like liquid pumpkin pie, good liquid pumpkin pie, really nicely balanced. Finishes good. Overall I am impressed since I'm not a big fan of beer with spices since I kinda expect too much sweetness and spices, but this is damn good. I can't make any other comparisons to the style but I may now have to try a few others just to see which is best."
"As a rule of thumb I generally stay away from the pumpkin beer, but a friend brought it over so I had it a try. Poured a hazy burnt orange amber, with a tiny bit of carbonation. Smells sweet, some cloves, cinnamon, nutmeg as it says on the bottle and maybe a little pumpkin funk. Taste is about the same, accept with some minor hops presence. This is one of the better pumpkin beers I've had. Because of it's ABV and subtle flavor this would be a decent sessioning beer. Over all not bad, or pretty good if you like pumpkin beer. Honestly if pumpkin beer was my thing I'd search out better alternatives."
"Drinkability: Above average vs. the style. A sessionable beer, the flavors never grate, but are quite pleasing."
"Pretty good beer. Not typically a fan of fruit or vegetable beers, this one is pretty simple and pleasant. It seems that the brewers begin with a lightly hopped but good quality pale ale, and then added the pumpkin additions, cloves, cinnamon, and other spices. The beer never feels weighted, but not under malted either. A nice fluffy head retention and soft copper hue verifies a quality base brew. Lightly estery and mildly hoppy with a slight grain bite. Finishes quite clean with a mild alcohol, pumpkin, and spicy note. Not my every day beer, but nice for the season."
"from the bottle. poured a dark honey with no head. aroma, those nice pumkin pie spies of cinnamon, nutmeg, and gloves with a side of brown sugar, some hops. where is the whip cream? flavor not as robust as I was hoping for had a hard time pulling the flavors out , did get a little of the pumpkin and just hint of the spices. onther than that it was a easy drinking beer."
"Wow, this beer is pretty damn good. Having only had the Blue Moon pumpkin ale before this one, I was not expecting too much. This beer really does taste like pumpkin pie. It smells wonderfully pumpkiny too. I will be looking forward to this beer next fall. Until then I will enjoy it while I can."
"I'm a bigger fan of pumpkin beer than most, so I that while say that O'Fallon's pumpkin ale isn't a perfect example of the style, it's still worth a buy."
"A mix between a clear pumpkin skin lager hue and a slightly hazy and just as slightly carbonated apricot ale color. The aroma is of a particularly spicey pumpkin in all its autumn glory. The taste makes me think of Hallowen. In all its herbal, earthy, and spicey mischief. Pllenty of light malts but they are overtaken by the pumpkin fruityness. The palate is a light spicey, more like from a Halloween scented candle than a beer at times."
"(Note: picture is not current -- new label has pumpkin in center)"
"4thoseabout2bock and I did a blind tasting of O'fallon, Dogfish Punk, and New Holland Icabod. I had tried all 3 within the past week and was able to identify each one blind. We both preferred O'fallon and found Dogfish Punk notably inferior to the others (despite being a fan of Punkin' in past years)."
"his will never be one of my favorite styles but, so far, this would be my pick. The pumpkin and spices are just about right to enjoy with out overpowering. Definitely worth a try for the fall season."
"Roasted pumpkin skin. Dense almond meat colored head of small and medium sized bubbles that settles to a dusting of microfine foam and left no lacing. Definite pumpkin pie spice aromas - cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, as well as a bit of malt sweetness, not overpowering, but rather enjoyable. Nice and rich pumpkin pie leads things off. Cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg over lay a modestly sweet malt body. The finish is more spices as well as a bit of biscuity malt that lends a hint of pie crust-like completeness. I can picture a dollop of whip cream on top. There is also just a hint of hop crispness as well to compliment the pie sweetness, and the cinnamon kind of stands out in the finish. Medium-light body with a smooth, minimally carbonated feel. It has just enough body to provide a bit of heft, but is not overly thick and cloying like some pumpkin ales can be. Enjoyable and well spiced, but not dominatingly so. There is just enough to you know you had a piece, rather than the entire pie."
"Da very good pumpkin ale. Of the others that I have had, its one of my favorites. Its a good dessert brew for sure"
"Hrmm, not my favorite style to begin with, but this isn't as good as Buffalo Bills, which has more of an authentic pumpkin flavor as opposed to spice. Not inclined to buy this again but it's better than average for the style."
"Dark copper color topped by an off white head. The beer displays a nice level of carbonation, but he head recedes quickly into the glass. The aroma is very light. It shows off the pumpkin and contains just a bit of nutmeg and cinnamon. Malt comes through in the finish. The flavor has more depth. Nice pumpkin flavor up front balanced nicely with the cinnamon and nutmeg. Ive always stated that to have a good pumpkin beer, you have to start with a nice base. Definitely true in this case. The ale used as a base has a nice fruitiness, and a light caramel nature from the malt. The mouth feel is light, bordering on thin, but as stated earlier, nice carbonation. Great fall beer."
"Low-medium bodied, would like a bit more chewiness, very nice pumpkin ale, though."
"Overall, this pumpkin beer doesnt try to impress with taste or complexity. Its more of a good introduction to the style if anything."
"Another missed opportunity of a pumpkin ale. The base beer is just a regular old nothing of a golden ale. Light and lacking a lot malt depth. The spices are on showcase here and I guess the traditional thinking is to use a light beer and let the spices come through, but it ends up being a dissapointment. Just spices and a decently balanced beer only go so far and makes this beer stop short of being great. I wish they would make it with a better base beer, I would love to see a porter. Overall I liked it well enough, but I wish there was more to it."
"There really isn't a whole lot of substance to this beer. It noticeably lacks a richness & depth that the best pumpkin ales have - which seems to be a common problem among pumpkin beers. It just comes across like a normal nondescript golden ale with heavy spices."
"Oh, this year's label is better with the orange jack-o-lantern on it."
"Top-noch effort from the area's quirkiest brewery."
"Purchased in a 6-pack at the local Wild Oats natural food store (which also has a decent selection of beer). It pours a beautiful golden orange with a modest off-white head. Rather murky looking. It smells delicious! Just like pumpkin pie! Smells of sweet, sticky cinnamon (though not overpowering) with nutmeg and of course, pumpkin. Fortunately, this delicious nose is manifested in the taste too! The spices are all there, along with considerable malts and a tinge of hops. I can see how this would be too sweet for some people, but I love it. Medium bodied and damn drinkable. This is my first pumpkin beer and it freaking rocks. I can't wait to try others!!!"
"-UF"
"Pumpkin, Pumpkin Poured out nice brownish-orange color, low head, long lasting head retention. Head color white with slight orange tint. Aroma reminding of pumpkin pie, with nutmeg, clove and cinnamon being the prodominant spices. Some malt and hop aroma present. The flavors of pumpkin pie is robust, with the nutmeg, cinnamo, and clove coming though till the end also being accentuated by the low malt and hop character. Well carbonation in this one, medium bodied, nicely balanced to resemble pumpkin pie. Very drinkable."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a bit of a grittiness it seems. Would be more drinkable with a bit less spicing, but still quite quaffable for the style. I enjoyed it."
"This beer makes no secret of trying to emulate pumpkin pie and it does a good job. First you see it, is has the same coloring(murky), then you smell it, it has the same spicing, then you taste it, but it also has a delicious beer side too it with assertive sharp hops as an immediate aftertaste and then after a few seconds you get a delicious wam pumpkin pie taste in your mouth. You will also notice a slight yeastiness that is not at all unpleasant and actually adds to the mouthfeel. I'm going to stock up on these the next time I go to Hy-vee and save it for thanksgiving. This beer tastes like fall. And if you're interested in the head, it's not very high or longlived and it has an offwhite hue, the bottle is full of yeast, so decant carefully if you don't like this. My one qualm is that they didn't fill the bottle up enough, which erks me because the type of cap they use is one of a hand-capped microbrew and they shouldn't be cheap bastards, I'll still buy it though. Recommended."
"Pours a hazy, milky orange/amber with bits of something floating about, pumpkin I presume, small frothy white head. Smells of gingerbread cookies, lots of cinnamon and nutmeg. Tastes vaguely of pumpkin pie, squash (I assume that's the pumpkin as I've never actually eaten pumpkin) lots of spices, a little artificially though. Mouthfeel is thicker than I would have guessed, like a heavy brown ale maybe. This was pretty tasty for my first pumpkin ale, we'll see how it matched up against Dogfish Punkin Ale and Buffalo Bill's Pumpkin Ale."
" I know this is not the highest rated Pumpkin beer out there but it is very nice and doesn't go overboard with spices. Mouthfeel on thin side of medium. Hops stay out of the way. This gets it a lot of average/boring ratings. I still like it's subtile flavors and find this fresh fall batch very drinkable. Maybe some local brewer loyalty thrown in the mix. This may find its way to some of my Fall trades."
"drinkability: quite drinkable"
"Pours amber orange in color with a decent head that retreated to a thin surface covering. Light aroma of nutmeg and cinnamon. Thin mouthfeel. This is a lackluster pumpkin ale. It has a vegetable, not even pumpkin, taste to it. Flavors are dominated with cinnamon and nutmeg. Too much nutmeg throws off the balance. Actually, there is no balance. Cinnamon sweetens this otherwise sleepy beer. Not much else going on here. Weak!"
"First pumpkin ale of the fall season. I look forward to fall on the beer calendar for so many reasons, one being pumpkin ales. This one, however, better not be a sign of whats to come this year. This beer is BORING! The appearance is a clear golden, with a rusty body. The aroma is decent, but there is just not enough of it. When I am having a pumkin ale, I want the spices to come out and punch me in the face. This one is very timid with nutmeg being the biggest producer of smell. The taste is very thin and lacks any luster. Small hints of vanilla and cloves find their way through, but it is incredibly unappealing. Thankfully, I only bought two bottles of this. In my honest opinion, this is exactly what I would expect from AB or Miller if they brewed a pumpkin. Blahhh, this is boring!"
"Overall this isnt at all a bad pumkin beer, but if you have anything else as an alternative, you might have better luck their, like Lakefront Pumpkin."
"When I finished the last bottle in my sixpack, I found it did hold up pretty nicely. It was well filtered at bottling, no icky sediment on the bottom. Spices had not become overpowering, but added to the malt to make it come in a little """richer.""" I wouldnt want to hold on the this too long, but it aged well."
"Medium bodied with a healthy dose of bubbly as well. I would like to see this be just a tad fuller in the mouthfeel. Both drinkable and enjoyable...I'll be looking for this one again during the fall next year."
"Pours a slightly hazy apricot color, with a bubbly head rising up a full inch to the rim of the glass. The bubbles pop noisily to realease gas quickly and the head disappears right away. Aroma is sweet and spicy, a bit more nutmeg than pumpkin, definite bit of hops, and sweet malt. Flavor is rich, just shy of cloying, full of pumpkin and spice, with a dry, clean finish, almost a bit tannic. Mouthfeel is a little thin, but bubbles tingle in the finish. Thanks to Brent for passing this one on."
"Pours an off-orange hue with a thick head that forms into a nice sheet that covers the ale nicely. Nutmeg and cloves dominate the nose, some cinnamon also detected. Carbonated; rich with a milkshake like thickness, the obvious pumpkin tastes picked up immediately. The pumpkin pie spicy flavors are balanced well with a decent malt based backbone. Stays rich and creamy, nothing overpowering, decent medium bodied cold weather treat; nothing wrong with this one!"
"Orange/bronze (pumpkin color, I guess) with a small, tight head that did not stick around. Nice, sturdy malt with nondescript but adequate hopping. Reminded me of an amber ale, but a bit more sweet. Bottle notes brewed with cinnamon, clove and nutmeg - spices were noted, but they were quite reserved, a background flavor playing a supporting part in the overall flavor profile. Quite nice."
"This is one of the better pumpkin ales I've tried. Quite tasty! Thanks to clvand0, for the bottle."
"Drinkability - a downright delicious and drinkable beer, quickly becoming one of my favorite styles."
"Tried this side-by-side with Buffalo Bill's Pumpkin Ale. Pours an amber color with a decent sized head that sticks around for a little while, but doesn't leave much lacing on the glass. The aroma has cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice - basically smells like pumpkin spices, but subtle, not too overpowering. Some sweetness as well. Tastes very good. Excellent blend of the pumpkin spices. Slight malt character, but the pumpkin takes over. Very well made. I liked this one much better than the Buffalo Bill's, but not nearly as well as the Dogfish Head version."
"The beer pours a nice opaque orange color without a head at all. The nose is cinnamon, nutmeg and pumpkin, just like a pie. The flavor is nicely balanced, with both the pumpkin and the spices coming through. This is one of the better pumpkin beers I've had. The mouthfeel is moderate, but ther carbonation is just a bit too much for me. Drinkability is also good. I could have a few of these with the colder weather coming in. Good thing I got 6 of them."
"12oz. bottle poured into a pint glass. It pours a hazy medium orange color with two fingers of head. There is a little bit of lacing left on the glass. The smell is malty, rich and full of pumpkin and nutmeg. The taste has the same full pumpkin and nutmeg flavors. Some cinnamon and cloves as well. A good overall flavor. The mouthfeel is nice and thick. The drinkability is good as well. A good pumpkin ale!"
"This beer will make a great compliment to Fall foods, desserts, or with fresh fruit."
"Nice addition to my fall line-up from this brewery!"
"Now, someone has to come up with a Sweet Potato Porter...."
"Fort Wayne PubCrawl: Yes, thanks Silphium for bringing this bottle to our event. It poured a small sized white head with fine-small sized bubbles that mostly diminished. The body was cloudy and carbonated with an orange hue. The nose in my opinion consisted of clove, nutmeg, pumpkin, and cinnamon with a light spicy and mildly sweet flavoring to it. This beer had a bubbly, tingly, smooth, watery and thin texture to it and it was light bodied. The lacing was very sparse on the sides of my glass. Not a bad beer, but I just can't quite seem to get into pumpkin ales so far."
"Drinkability: My first pumpkin beer ever, and quite interesting. Liquid pumpkin pie. Not too sure on this one, but it could grow on me."
"Clear and bright amber-orange color with a small off white head that doesn't last, no lacing, aroma of spices and pumpkin. Pumpkin , ginger, nutmeg? and cinnamon flavors, very spicy. Light body with a light and crisp mouthfeel, not overdone with pumpkin, nice spice and pumpkin balance."
