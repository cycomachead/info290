"Not terrible.  I am not a big fan of the Pumpkin Beer Style.  A little too much pumpkin spice. I'd prefer something a little more subtle."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  I really, really enjoyed this pumpkin beer.  I really like the great balance between the malt, the sweet and the spice.  Solid, solid pumpkin beer.  I’ll get a bottle or two next Autumn."
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer makes you want to sit back on a cool fall night by the fire place while over looking a beautiful fall landscape. The pumpkin spices fly from the beer straight to your nose. The beer has a strong cinnamon and ginger. Its almost like a gingerbread cookie with a hint of pumpkin to balance it out."
""
""
"Disappointing considering Sam Adams is advertised as being quality craft beer.... Not what I expect for a pumpkin ale. It's lacking in flavor and seems watered down."
""
"This beer pours with a small cream-colored head that settled quickly in to a thin layer with little lacing. There is nice clarity to the amber liquid. The scent of pumpkin pie spices leap from the glass, making me long for whipped cream and a buttery crust. Small hints of cherry cordial. The flavor is spice-forward and a little unbalanced. Tangy, bold coriander citrus with abundant cinnamon, ginger and allspice. The amber malts and vague pumpkin flavor struggle to keep up. The mouthfeel is medium-thin with a pithy, prickly carbonation. The finish consists of burnt caramel and gingersnaps. Outside of the scent, there is little pumpkin to be found here. It's a gingerbread house in a bottle. Despite the overriding spice themes, this is surprisingly easy to drink. It is somehow cleaner than many of the other comparable offerings, which seems like a a contradiction. Quite enjoyable."

"Good pumpkin beer."

"Overall: fruit/spiced beers are not my personal choice of brew, but this is definitely one of the better ones I have had."

"Overall: Pretty impressed. I've had this beer many times before. But that was before I considered beer a """hobby""". After having so many well regarding pumpkin ales, I wasn't expecting this to be able to compete, but I think it does."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Decent, worth getting in the mixed 12 pack, but I wouldn't buy a whole six pack of just this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Savory and quite succulent, the beer sides with spice, dryness and toast although sweetness lingers with a simmering quality. Its warmth is aided by pie spices that shore up the beer in dessert-like fashion."
""
""
""
"Pretty decent Pumpkin beer. Pumpkin flavor is present but gets a little more overpowered by other flavors than i would like but still more present than other pumpkin beers i have had."
""
"Overall a solid pumpkin ale.  I didn't like last years but this year's has grown on me. I would buy it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL:  this is a good beer, it tastes like pumpkin pie and that is never a bad thing, the smell and taste were not overpowering.  This is not my favorite style but I enjoy it during the season."
""
"Serving type: bottle"
"Pours a dark orange with a white head that trails the glass. The smell was full of pumpkin pie spices. The taste had pumpkin the beginning but became overpowered, specifically by the amount of cinnamon and nutmeg. Not a bad profile, but just a little one note."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: 4.06 - You know, this wasn't bad at all. With a pumpkin beer I'm not expecting something to blow me away; I just desire a """cozy""" fall vibe with it and this one certainly does that. I feel like I'm sitting under a bright orange and red tree at sunset in the fall surrounded by leaves with this beer. Well done Samuel Adams! Well done. I would drink this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Typical pumpkin ale. Tons of pumpkin and spices. Nothing out of the ordinary other than a massive spice load which makes it tough to have a lot of."

"A bit dry, but refreshing and no sacrifice to quality."
"Nice beautiful amber colored beer.  Pours with a nice full creamy white head.It has a soft pleasant smell, doesn't really hit you in the face with the pumpkin in the smell which to some might be a plus, i'd prefer a little more pumpkin smell.  Upon sipping it's a bit more complex tasting for a beer of this style.  It has a nice spiced pumpkin flavor that stays with you.  The pumpkin is pretty subtle but this is a full flavored easy drinking beer.  I'd buy it again if there weren't so many others to try."
""
""
""
""
"O: Great aroma, but a big let down in the taste.  Ill have the other one that came in the variety pack, but after that I dont see myself having this again in the future. 3.5"
""
""
"This is fine.  Nothing exceptional."
""
""
""
""
"A good choice for pumpkin ales; and be my go to for a crowd favorite. Taste and easiness to drink is there. A great beer."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: tastes like pumpkin, dark malt, cinnamon and brown sugar is also prominent. Good beer has a great autumn feel to it. Perfect for the fall season."
""
""
""
""
"O- While I’m on “richness of the flavors” I do wish they had been just a bit richer. Everything was decent and well balanced, but it all just had the volume turned down a little more than I would have liked."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I expected more."
""
""
""
""
"Got in the Variety Pack. It's enjoyable nonetheless. Clear orangeish-red pour, more of a spicy nose than pumpkin. Smooth tasting with a hint of pumpkin, but more spice tasting than anything."
""
""
"Pours a clear orange-ish red. Mild carbonation, small head. Nose is very spicy, hard to detect much pumpkin.  Taste follows the nose, packed full of spice, nutmeg, cinnamon. It almost drinks more like a Christmas ale then a pumpkin ale. I enjoy this beer as it is very tasty, but I feel it falls short as a pumpkin ale since the pumpkin is overpowered by the spice."
"Glass- Shaker pint"
""
"Tastes like pumpkin pie and the seasonal aftertaste lingers beautifully."
"Overall too light on the pumpkin."

"I really liked this beer. The warmer it got, the more flavors I could really extract out of this beer. Tasted like a nice crisp ale on the front end, but finished with a great sweetness of pumpkin and cloves and cinnamon on the end. I couldn't really pick this up well from the smell, but it was such a great beer and I very much enjoyed it. I could definitely put a few of these down as I'm sitting around a fire and enjoying fall."
"Changing my rating to1 for smell and look alone.  Bought two more 6 packs that tasted horrible like soap or straight hops....  Called them and complained.  Stay away from batch P24640959625 in black letters on the bottle neck!!!!!!!"

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Okay overall yet rather disjointed and too brash, flavor-wise. The initial smell is most appealing yet fades way too quickly, even at room temperature. And the finish leaves a sort of metallic twang in the mouth that ultimately distracts from any remaining good points. Not bad but hardly a must-have..."

"Not much head or carbonation in this pumpkin Ale, Nice deep orange hue, with the aroma sense very nice light spice notes. Spices linger in the aftertaste."
""
"Light carbonation, pretty easy to drink. This one is pretty mild in many respects, a little less bold in flavor than the Boston Lager, very light pumpkin flavoring/aftertaste. Overall not a bad beer, good for sensitive palates and lightweights."
""
""
""
"honestly not a bad overall beer. the spices definitely do cancel out most of the pumpkin flavor, whatever pumpkin flavor there is its pretty mild.that said, it is refreshing, quite drinkable and has a good taste overall"
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Very interesting beer that reflects the fall season.  Not a huge fan of the massive squash flavor but the smell is amazing.  Probably would not buy a 6 pack of this but it was an interesting try.  My first pumpkin beer.  3.5/5"

"decent pumpkin flavor, ShockTop and Terrapin do a much better job honestly."
"One of these days I'm going to taste a pumpkin beer that satisfies my pumpkin beer craving. Until that day, Sam Adams does a mediocre job here, with that creepy cheap aftertaste and falseness that is all too often present in this style."
""
"I will grab a six of this again.   It isn't my all time fav, but the folks up in Boston got this one right."

"This Pumpkin Ale is very easily the best beer of the 2014 Collection. It pours a gorgeous deep orange/amber kind of hazy. Smells like pure pumpkin pie/allspice and hints of cinnamon. Taste is exacrtly the same - pumpkin pie. Just amazing. Shame there were only 2 in the pack, and I'm surprised at the low ratings. If you like pumpkin pie, you'll love this beer."

"Not overly spiced like some pumpkin beers, but maybe a little thin.  An OK beer but not setting the world on fire either.  Good beer for the price and a good transition beer for the bmc crowd."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A decent pumpkin ale that shows some restraint.  IMO most pumpkin ales are over spiced, this one is subtly spiced which lets the pumpkin come through."

"Pours a pretty orange-brown in color with almost a 1-finger off-white head. Left some lacing when sipped. The aroma was very pleasant of pumpkin, grain and spice. The taste would be the same and very easy to drink. Good carbonation for this type of brew. No harsh or bitter aftertaste. aftertaste. Overall I liked it. Bring on autumn!"
""
""
""
""
"The beer pours in the glass with some nice head and it smells of pumpkin pie. The taste of it is like drinking pumpkin pie in a glass. This is my favorite pumpkin beer and it is such a great representative of the style. I look forward to this every fall."

"Samuel Adams Harvest Pumpkin Ale Brewed by Boston Beer Company ( Samuel Adams) with an ABV of 0f 5.7% This brew pours out a light brown color with a small white head. The smell is rich with sweetness and grains. There is nothing overpowering about this brew so far. The taste is smooth like pumpkin pie you get the pumpkin and nutmeg taste. There is a lot going on in this brew. There is nothing overpowering in this brew. This brew has a nice balance to it. The mouthfeel is nice and clean with a smooth aftertaste. Overall I'm giving this brew a 4 out 5. I would get this brew again."

"Overall - This is a decent pumpkin ale, great price point and availability. There is a familiar malt bill and light yeast that is particular to Sam Adams brews present here, and is somewhat complimentary to the pumpkin spices here. Sure there is better, but I feel this is a decent representative of the style."

"O: Good. I wasn't excited about this beer (it was in a fall sampler), but it wound up being a nice surprise. The best description for this beer is its name, """pumpkin ale""". It tastes like an ale injected with pumpkin juice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is toasty, definite light roasted pumpkin, very faint hint of spices, nice toasty finish, slightly sweet up front, drier pumpkin element in finish."

""

"O: Overall i like how they opted to go the more natural route, where the natural pumpkin and toasted quality gets a better representation then most examples which tries to come off like a richly spiced bomb pumpkin pie. Decent, with a better then average rate of drinkability per style."

"I love pumpkin beer so this was one i was very excited to try. You can taste the fact that it is brewed with real pumpkin instead of just pumpkin spices added into the beer. You can taste nutmeg very strong with the pumpkin, they go together perfectly."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
"Overall: an enjoyable offering that is pleasurable on a cold fall day."
""
""
""
"Yet another good offering from the king of the microbrewers (but can you really say they're a microbrewery anymore?) Anyway, love the seasonal offering, Great dark-amber, caramel color a burnt tinge to it that is very appealing to the eyes. Not much of a head or lacing, though. Great smell of pumpkin - not overpowering and mixes well with the malts they use. Mouthfeel is decent - not too big into something that is too carbonated, so I scored it lower there. The taste is outstanding - I love it when I can taste what I smell in the beer - the pumpkin mixes well with the ale flavor of the recipe. Overall, a very good beer and one I will be enjoying again soon..."
""
""
"This is okay. Probably the most bland of the pumpkin brews I've tried. It looks great. Well, it's just about like the Boston Lager. The smell is certainly inviting with the spices. The taste is simply lackluster. I wouldn't get it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A well balanced beer, that has all the necessary ingredients and flavors needed for the style. My only gripe is the light body. This would improve with a bit more malt complexity and mouthfeel. Like many of Sam Adams' beers this is a decent beer, but doesn't take any risks."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Definitely not my favorite fall beer. There is not a ton a pumpkin flavor and it overrun by the spices. I would not go looking for it."
""
""
""
"Overall - This is a great fall beer, definitely goes well with thanksgiving as well."
""
""
""
"Solid beer. Sam Adams' Harvest Pumpkin Ale has the subtle smell of a classic pumpkin pie, however, the smell is the most pumpkin-y aspect of this fall beer. If you are looking for a harvest style beer then you are in luck. With traditional autumnal spices, such as warming cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg, this beer embraces the classic flavors of the American harvest season. Although you can definitely taste hints of pumpkin flavor, it is, by no means, a pumpkin beer. The pumpkin flavor is subtle, at best, and does not necessarily fit its namesake as a harvest """pumpkin""" ale. The beer's mouthfeel is an average experience, combining a medium-high carbonation with a style that is better fitted by lower level of carbonation. One additional positive note is the beer's dark amber coloring that pairs well with the backdrop of the season's falling leaves. Overall, this was a good harvest beer. There was nothing particularly exceptional, but also not much about which to complain. I found this beer to have a high drinkability factor, and would recommend Sam Adams' Harvest Pumpkin Ale to any casual beer drinker in search of a seasonal harvest brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Sam Adams's Harvest Pumpkin Ale certainly does not hold back on the spices. If you enjoy lots of pumpkin pie spice notes in your beer, you should definitely give this a try."

"Samuel Adams Harvest Pumpkin is another great fall flavored beer from The Boston Brewing Company. It's a beautiful brownish red color that goes down smooth with a burst of fall flavors, pumpkin being the star. Very slight taste of hop but sweet pumpkin is the star of this ale. Very much enjoyed drinking 5 or 6 while watching a game of football!"
"Overall - I was anticipating more pumpkin character. Not a bad flavor, but this beer didn't deliver the autumnal feeling the bottle promised."

"Another very solid seasonal brew from our native boy Samuel Adams. Good pumpkin aroma and nice orangey color - really par for the course with most good pumpkin ales. Decently viscous which gives you a good thick mouthful of beer to really get that pumpkin essence. Nice balance of spice with a hint of sweetness that really takes this beer to the 4.0 outstanding level. Not my all time favorite pumpkin (see my reviews on my local Crossroads Brewing Company of Athens NY """Dr. Loomis Pumkin Ale""" and of course """Southern Tier Pumpking""") but very very good overall. For the price (~$8.99 a sixer at the local """Beer World""") probably one of the best in that category if you like Fall pumpkin ales."
""
""
""
""
"This isn't a bad beer, however, you may have notice there is no reference to it anywhere above - I didn't detect any. All the other makings for a solid pumpkin beer are here in taste alone. The aroma was a big disappointment, but other than that it's a decent beer."
""
"My pour was too much for the glass and I got a little bit of overpour as the result. Allowing it to calm, I got two dense fingers of thick, tawny head with great retention. As it slowly fell, I was left with great lacing. Color was a deep mahogany (!) (SRM = > 27, < 34) with NE-plus quality clarity. They must have filtered the bejeezus out of the beer to get it this bright! I could see into my future and it was my 50th birthday party in Lincoln, NE with Val Midwest for her 21st. Nose smelled like what the Brewdogs boys tried to make in Philly - molasses, cinnamon, spruce tips, pumpkin. This was a revolutionary-era beer if I ever smelled one. The mouthfeel was big, creamy, and full. The taste was beautiful - some malt, some pumpkin, some spice, some caramel. It was like candy, but not in a bad way. Leave it to Brewer Bob and the boys to nail it. I think that I have hit upon a new favorite! Finish was semi-sweet, allowing me to savor the flavors without getting overwhelmed with sweetness, which is where a lot of pumpkin ales leave me high and dry. I now want to do a side-by-side with Pumking, which was my previous # 1."

"Overall: A good beer with out being too strongly pumpkin flavored, however the high amount of carbonation didn't really fit in with the style of the beer. Worth a try."
"O- Sam Adams created a great tasting, well balanced pumpkin beer that's refreshing and didn't go overkill on the spices. I think that's great since I don't want to smell liquid potpourri in my glass nor drink a spice rack. Another great selection to enjoy for the autumn season from Boston, as the temperatures start to drop and the colors of the leaves start to change. It's pumpkin season!"
""
"Overall this was a solid beer, that I would have again just not as good as other offerings."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The taste of this beer isn't overly complex, but it has nice flavors of pumpkin pie and isn't overly sweet."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall impression: A spicy, easy drinking brown ale. The spices seem kind of disjointed and nothing jumps out at me and says """pumpkin""" but maybe that's ok. Appropriate for the season."
""
""
""
"O: It's okay I guess, but it's also boring and hard to drink - two qualities which NEVER go together. Put in the large pile of bland, not-very-good pumpkin ales while I stick with Schlafly Pumpkin Ale, kthx. At least it's better than I initially thought it to be ('course, I initially thought it to be horrid instead of just boring back then)."
""
""
""
""
"O- Tasty, a decent Pumpkin ale, and I would highly recommend considering the good price. Not the best example of the style but far from the worst."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This started off good but quickly transformed into a generic sweet liquid. The carbonation was ample at the start which faded, as did the spices and pumpkin, which ultimately lead to a thin sweet malt bomb. I expected more from Sam Adams. If you drink this beer make sure it is ice cold! Don't let this sucker warm up."
""
""
""
""
"12 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, best before 2/2014. Pours fairly crystal clear ruby copper color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of pumpkin, cinnamon, clove, caramel, toast, nutmeg, gingerbread, brown sugar, light chocolate, herbal, and toasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of malt, pumpkin, and spice notes; with solid strength. Taste of pumpkin, caramel, brown sugar, toast, cinnamon, nutmeg, gingerbread, light clove, light chocolate, herbal, and toasted earthiness. Lingering notes of pumpkin, caramel, brown sugar, cinnamon, toast, nutmeg, gingerbread, light clove, light chocolate, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Nice balance of malt, pumpkin, and spice flavors; with decent robustness and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and moderately crisp mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice pumpkin ale. Good all around balance of malt, pumpkin, and spice flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."
""
"O: This is a pretty average Pumpkin Ale - nothing overly interesting and nothing really stands out about this one. Easy enough to drink and the alcohol is well hidden. It feels like everything is done rather conservatively."
""
"The Verdict: It’s ok. Pumpkin pie lovers should like it, but I prefer a more subtle pumpkin flavor in my ales. All depends on your individual tastes."

""
""

"This is a pretty standard pumpkin ale. Not bad, but nothing special. Kind of boring."
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
"I always feel that Sam Adams is rather over rated. This pretty much fits that bill. It was a decent beer, and I don't dislike it. However, I had two the pumpkin beers that were much much better. So if you're not feeling adventurous but want a light pumpkin flavor, drink this. The color is a fantastic dark hue though, but I really prefer to rely more on the taste."

"First pumpkin beer of the season and it has that traditional pumpkin pie smell and flavor. A little bit of actual squash flavor is there, because, well...they actually put some pumpkin in the beer. Not overly spiced like some pumpkin beers that I've tried in the past. I could say it's too vegetal tasting, but it's pumpkin beer and authentic pumpkin beer made with real pumpkins is going to have that flavor. I'm not a big fan of the style, but it seems like sacrilege not to have at least one pumpkin beer when in the fall."

"Moderate to dark amber color with mild head and mild carbonation. Heavy ginger and pumpkin pie smell right out of that oven. This is beer? Can't tell from the smell. Tastes a bit like ginger beer infused with pumpkin. Heavy ginger, cinnamon flavor. Great pumpkin flavor and spice complexity in addition to a great beer element as well. Great pumpkin beer."
""
"A: beautiful golden red. S: bready malts and pumpkin pie.  Lots of cinnamon and nutmeg here.  T:  smooth, creamy Marzen upfront, finishes with a moist pumpkin pie flavor.  M:  a bit syrupy, like a good Marzen should.  A very smooth and drinkable feel.  Not much booze to speak of.  O:  What a great brew!  Not sure who all the haters of this beer are, but I think it's a great Marzen style beer with some delicious notes of pumpkin with all the right spices to make a great and very drinkable pumpkin ale."

"O - Once again, Samuel Adams impresses me. The pumpkin isn't overpowering, nor is this too sweet. A good solid pumpkin beer, though I couldn't have more than 2 in one sitting."
""
"O: Over all it was alright, too carbonated to my taste and the pumpkin flavor was too faint for it to strike me as unique but it wasn't horrendous."
""
"This brew sucked me in on the end of an aisle at the local super mercado As SAMs never fails to please I decided to roll the dice on an autumn classic so lets give it a whirl. Popping the top I get a waft of cinnamon and spice and everything nice including a hint of clove and some maltiness. Appropriately pouring into a SAPP this brew partakes a deep bronze with a very thick tan head looking much like pumpkin pie in a glass. On the sip the spices are very prominent jumping out on the initial taste then fading back to give way to very classic slightly bitter cinnamon pumpkin pie crust flavor. Units is a very deep flavored almost warming brew, maybe a bit early to be imbibing as it would serve well when the mercury drops. SAB puts out yet another fine selection"

"Drinkability: This is one I'd drink again. It is not as good as some of the others that you can find-Schlafly esp.- but for what it is I'm definitely happy with this beer. It is definitely worth a try. The price is right on it and the availability is great too. Usually not a big Sam Adams guy, but this one works for me."

" The taste is good with mild malt fullness supporting an allspice-like pepper and cinnamon flavor up front with more caramel malt flavors in the middle and light vegetal taste with subtle yeast and tangy nutmeg-like spice toward the back end. The overall take is this is substantially spiced and mostly malty but not overboard in either sense -a pretty decent pumpkin ale, but not the best there is."
""
""
""
""
""
"Featured in the Harvest Collection 12-pack, this pumpkin ale boasts 17 pounds of pumpkin per barrel per the labeling but the flavors just don't add up here. Spices are a bit overwhelming and pumpkin flavor is a bit underwhelming, although things are more balanced in the smell than taste. There are also flavors of caramel and hops, but the nutmeg/cinnamon/brown sugar (I can't put my finger on all of the spices) unfortunately present the backbone of this underachieving pumpkin ale. A decent beer, but it's not Sam Adams quality."
""
""
""
""
"Atmosphere is decent. Fair head, but no real lacing. Nose pumpkin pie. Earthy and gritty, fall spices and little of the namesake pumpkin. A bit pungent in the end. Overall, this is an okay quaff."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The beer is much more robust than last years version of Pumpkin Harvest. It says on the bottle that they add 17 pounds of pumpkin per barrel and you sure get that flavor. To be honest, I would have liked it better if it was more of a pumpkin pie flavor rather than just pumpkin. Not a bad pumpkin ale but I do like other pumpkin ales better."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I just tried this as part of a seasonal sample pack. I have had pumpkin beer before at the Great Dane some years ago. This has a great dark caramel color and low carbonation. The aroma is subtle yet pleasing. It is a bit sweet for my taste, very malty with a hint of pumpkin spice. Not bad overall, but I would not buy a six pack of it."
""
""
""
""

"Overall, it's a clean, tasty pumpkin beer with need of some heartier characteristics."

"Understated pumpkiness and carbonation from a few weeks past expiration date. Extra in trade, because I had missed its more limited distribution. Yellow orange bodied. Very drinkable, a but saison like, and even appealing to sip by the ladies. Pumpkin at the end, its really the spices that was its appeal. Easy mouthfeel."

""
""

"Rich, malty aroma has a strong overtone of cinnamon and a firm pumpkin hint. Pours a clear, dark copper with a thick, fine-bubbled, persistent light tan head. Flavor has a core of malt and pumpkin with strong cinnamon and clove notes and just a hint of caramel. Quite satisfying and tasty, almost like a liquid pumpkin pie. Smooth texture has good body and fizz. A darned good beer for saying farewell to Summer and hello to Autumn."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Ginger and Nutmeg balance each other out well in the finish. The beer is crisp, light and very drinkable. Pumpkin beers are really about the spices, which in this beer are obvious but at the same time fulfill expectations. A pumpkin beer I could easily drink several of, and that is saying something."

"Overall, this is a decent pumpkin-flavored ale, and there’s much to like in here, including a nice selection of spices and a bevy of pumpkin flavors. The underlying beer seems to suffer a bit from these additions, lacking distinct characteristics, and the aftertaste is unfortunately lingering and overly raw in pumpkin flesh, leaving a mildly unpleasant flavor on the tongue. But subsequent sips of the beer do much to relieve this aftertaste, and at an easily-drinkable 5.7% ABV, this is a nice lunch beer for sunny fall afternoons."

"not a bad pumpkin ale.. almost a blend of an amber and pumpkin spices.."
""
""
""
""
""
"12oz bottle: This one pours a fairly clear reddish, darker amber color. There was very little off-white head on it. It did not linger nor leave any lacing. The aroma is pretty much pumpkin pie-like spices. Nutmeg is most prevalent. Taste is good. Taste of lighter pumpkin, some (but not overpowering) spices. Fairly clean and refreshing finish."

"Too light and thin for an ale, with no finish, nothing doing but the vague pumkiness. A spiced ale for lager drinkers. Disappointment."
""
""
""
"O - a good representation of the style"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Same old, same old... A pumpkin ale is never what i hoped. When i think of a pumpkin ale, i think of creamy pumpkin pie, yet all i ever get is pumpkin water, drenched in the same played out spices, designed to fool us that we, in fact, have a holiday pumpkin ale. This brew isn't bad, it's just generic."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is a real downer. Kinda bitter, kinda bland, and just really not what I was looking for. Odd, since I actually really liked the smell."
""
"Overall, more malt-centric than pumpkin. Better than the overly spiced versions of the style, but pretty subtle for a pumpkin beer. Good malt character."
""
""
""
"O - A very approachable beer that sacrifices flavor for broad appeal. About what I expected, I suppose. Regardless, it's something I could drink again but would not seek out."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, Harvest Pumpkin Ale is a red-amber color with a thick, cream-colored, pillowy head. The nose is a mixture of sweet amber malts and spices - cinnamon, cloves and all-spice. The taste follows suit with the spices coming to the forefront and the beer being well balanced, even to the point of slightly bitter on the finish - as opposed to most pumpkin ales that seem to lean more to the sweeter side of the spectrum. Mouthfeel is light in body with a minimally active carbonation and slightly dry finish. Overall, this is not a bad pumpkin ale; that being said there are many better ones out there too."
""
""
"Tickles the pumpkin beer itch but that's about it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a good, not great pumpkin beer. Very heavy on spice, and a bit too flat for my liking. One positive is that it is a very easy beer to drink, you can easily put down two or three without tiring of the """novelty""" of the seasonal taste."
"O) A well crafted pumpkin / harvest seasonal brew. I'd definitely drink another."
""
""
"Overall - A very good beer by Sam Adams (normally, I'm not a huge fan). In my opinion, it has just the right amount of pumpkin coming through. I find that most of the pumpkin ales I try are either overbearing or too lite."
"Taste is decent, like liquid pumpkin pie with malts. There is also a hint of what tastes like spiced chai tea. I was expecting more pumpkin taste considering the bottle claims they use 17lbs per barrel. Overall it is not bad, drinkability is pretty good as well."
""
""
"Pass."
""
""
""
"O: not my favorite seasonal this fall, the smell was exciting but the taste let me down"
""
"Smells and tastes of the expected pumpkin pie spicing with decent amounts of nutmeg and cinnamon without being overbearing to the toasted and caramel malts. The difference between this pumpkin beer and a lot of the other ones on the market seems to be a sharp accent of powdered dried ginger in the mid-sip and a touch of white pepper dust. It's somewhat better than the average pumpkin beer at a reasonable price point."
""
""
""
""
"Smell reminds me of pumpkin pie. Taste is just like the smell--malty and sweet with a spicy pumpkin background. Mouthfeel is smooth with a little carbonation. Compared to other pumpkin ales, this one has a much stronger pumpkin flavor. Overall, an excellent seasonal beer from Samuel Adams, and one that I will be returning to."
""
"Worth a try for a sample night but probably not good for more than two."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a deep copper color. Notes of pumpkin and light spices on the nose. Taste follows. Overall, it's a very mild profile. Not bad, but not really pronounced in any way. The spice is still there and there is a malty smoothness in there too. I like it, but I wouldn't buy a six pack of it when I could get something like Punkin or even Sam Adams' own Fat Jack."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear reddish brown, with a thin creamy tan head. Aromas of plums and a hint of cinnamon. Taste begins with a nutmeg, and vanilla beginning, followed by some cinnamon, a little bit of whole wheat bread, and an earthy, slightly tangy finish. Mouthfeel is relatively full. Overall pretty good, tastes a bit like a pumpkin homebrew I made last year."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Way better than I anticipated. I must say if this beer was a bit closer to the syrupy end this would be one of my favorite pumpkin brews! That aside, this beer is a great showing."
""
"Overall, this isn't offensive, but it feel like a Pumpkin Spice Ale, instead of just Pumpkin, it's a bit too spiced, and the mouthfeel is very generic. Definitely nothing wrong with going through a sixer, but there are some better ones out there as well."
""
""
""
""
"This is a pretty mediocre pumpkin beer. I couldn't really move past the cough syrup component and the general lack of pumpkin is disappointing."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
"Pours a brownish hue, reddish tint, with some moderate head and lace on top of a spicy aroma with subtle sweet malt notes, not much in pumpkin. Taste is the same as the spices are dominant and I just really can't get a handle on the pumpkin; medium-bodied and does pass easy and smooth with some sweetness but not enough. This is an ok offering but not the best pumpkin beer out there by any means."
""
""
""
"Pours a brownish-ruby color, with some particulates suspended with a thin beige head that leaves no lacing on the glass. Aromas are weak but spicy - cinnamon & nutmeg, malty grain. Tastes are cinnamon,clove, nutmeg, overseasoned pumpkin pie (seems to be too much clove), cinnamon bun, brown sugar, caramel. Finishing tastes are better than the initial tastes. Nice medium body with ample carbonation. Overall, this one just didn't do it for me, but I'm not crazy over the pumpkin spice beers to begin with."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I like this beer quite a bit. Especially on a cool autumn night watching my Buckeyes crush fools."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel: This medium bodied brew is easy to drink and has very tasty flavor that is dominated by the spices."
"Pours a clear dark copper with a foamy khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots and streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, pumpkin, and a variety of pumpkin pie spices. Taste is much the same with a slight sweetness and a mild spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is easy to drink but I think it smells better than it tastes."
"Bottle: Poured a red amber color ale with a large foamy head with OK retention and light lacing. Aroma consists of light pumpkin and cinnamon notes with a sweet caramel malt base. Taste is a mix between some sweet caramel notes with some pumpkin notes and quite subtler notes of cinnamon. Body is about average with nice creamy touch and good carbonation. Better then I had expected with good level of drinkability and really smooth aftertaste."
""
""
"O) I think this brew might be a good intro for folks a little bit skeptical of the idea of a pumpkin beer. Glad to recommend..."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I find this beer nothing to write home about, but nothing to be upset over either. I did believe the malts overpowered the pumpkin and spices a little, which I would have preferred to be a little less subtle."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is the definition of a Pumpkin Ale, not sweet, just pumpkin with malts and hops. At least thats what I think."
""
"Pours a brownish-copper with a finger of head that dissipated quickly, but left a trace of lacing. Subtle pumpkin notes are present in the nose, but there is also an astringent scent as well. Subtle sweetness is certainly present in the taste. Some of that is due to the pumpkins, but the malt profile also clearly adds to the sweetness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"M- Light bodied, good carbonation."
""
"O:  I was excited to try this and expected great things.  Its a good pumpkin beer than has all the flavors expected but has no bang to it. Probably not on my top list but a decent take on the style. "
""
"Overall:Not a bad brew at all, It is extremely tasty and well crafted. I honestly prefer imperial pumpkin over any regular pumpkin ale but this one is just borderline. Considering price and how easy to find it might end up on the top when it comes to pumpkins. Salud!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I don't know if I got a bad batch or what, but this honestly did not even taste like a beer. It felt like drinking sparkling water. I'm a huge fan of pumpkin ales and I've tried several varieties, but this was by far the most disappointing offering I've tried to date. I might give it another go to see if it really was just a fluke, but I do so hesitantly. Based on this first taste, I would not recommend this beer to anyone."
"Above average pumpkin ale which (to me) is typically of most everything from Sam Adams. Their beers are really, really good, just not great. Exactly how I feel about this pumpkin. Technically, it's splendid. The spices weren't overwhelming and they paired with the pumpkin flavor perfectly. No overwhelming bitterness nor maltiness, well balanced, easily drinkable. I guess I always feel Sam could do just a TINY bit better but still, a very very good pumpkin ale. One I could drink each fall season."
"D/O: The caramel malt backbone makes this more than just a 1-trick pony. I'd gladly have another. Definitely drinkable and certainly repeatable."
"Decent take on the style, moderately flavorful, moderate sweetness. not cloying. Viscosity make this more of a sipper/night capper kind of fall/winter offering."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – Not a bad pumpkin brew. It is on the roastier side more toward the end of the taste but it has a nice level of sweetness to balance the pumpkin and spice. It has a very nice mouthfeel and is quite easy to drink. Not too shabby."
"Pours a bright clear dark red with a moderate sized head. Nice pumpkin pie aroma but not overpowering. Taste has a definite pumpkin character. Toasted malt and a little spice but again not too much which is good. There is just a touch of tartness too which I'm not sure if I like or not. Medium bodied. Easily drinkable. Overall this not fantastic but it is a pretty solid pumpkin beer."
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a pint glass because it was the closest one. Pours a rich reddish brown with fluffy head that disappears rather quickly leaving behind a nice lacey ring. Smell is of pumpkin meat and spice. Mouthfeel is rather thick, wet, and refreshing. It felt chewy. Cinnamon bread notes and a plum finish make this a sweet dessert beer. Very malty with little hop presence. It hit the spot and left me satisfied. It is nothing like other pumpkin ales I have had (with Dogfish still holding the number one slot in that specific endeavor). Definitely worth a try if you like pumpkin ales."
""
"O-Pretty decent beer. Pumpkin isn't over the top but still enjoyable beer"
"Overall: It's a bit of an odd flavored pumpkin beer. Really heavy in the spices with an somewhat awkward pumpkin flavor."

""
""
"O- Just not a fan. Worst pumpkin beer I've had to date- Hope they reformulate for next year."
""
""

"O- A real easy drinker, and a fairly flavorful one at that."

""
""

""
""
""
""

"There is a chewy caramel malt backbone. I detect some classic Fall flavors in this beer; cinnamon, all spice, pumpkin and black pepper. The pumpkin flavors become more prevalent with each sip and I appreciate that. There is a nice mini hop snap on the finish."

""
""
""
""
"Overall- Another great addition to the Sam Adam's family and one I like much better than their Oktoberfest (which is not a bad beer at all!) A great fall session beer!"
""
""
"O – This is a pretty nice pumpkin beer. It’s maybe not as flavorful as some other offerings that I’ve had due to the lower amount of pumpkin pie spices but it certainly retains a lot of the malt characteristics of the base beer. It’s pretty tasty overall and very drinkable."
""
""
""

"Overall, not impressed, it needs more sweetness to balance the allspice in my opinion or maybe some wheat or more biscuit."
""

"O- Solid pumpkin beer. Flavors are there, could use just a little more."
"It's not a bad beer, but all of the taste is very subtle and not as powerful as I would have liked. It's very easy to drink, but not the best Pumpkin beer on the market."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"I am not a big fan of the taste of pumpkin, so the fact that it wasn't the dominate flavor here was a plus for me. This is a nice beer for fall, the spice blend is fitting for this time of year. One of the better pumpkin beers I have had."
"Overall, a fairly disappointing beer from the Harvest Collection. It tastes pretty good, but the feel, look, and smell are lacking, leaving this as yet another average Sam Adams beer, in my opinion. Still wouldn't mind throwing back a few for Fall."
""
""
""
""
"O - I remember enjoying this beer many times several years back, but now I'm just not really into it. Like many others have said, there seems to be too much spice and not enough pumpkin - and the spices that are there seem off and a bit artificial. There's quite a few Sam Adams beers that I enjoy going back to, but this one won't make that list and needs quite a bit of tweaking in my opinion."
""
""
""
""
"M: Medium bodied, mild carbonation, semi-dry finish"
""
"Overall: A fairly standard, if slightly better than average, pumpkin ale. A decent fall seasonal and a great member of Sam Adams's lineup."
""
"O/D-Not my favorite Pump. Hard to really deliver with this style. I also really need to be in the mood for this style. Won't be grabbing a seder of this any Autumn in the near future."
"This one struck me off the bat with the perfect amber color. Better head and lacing and its a 5. The aroma has a lot of pumpkin which is more like fresh pumpkin as oppose to pumpkin flavoring which is usually sweeter. Medium body and high carbonation. The flavor starts with caramel malts and some pumpkin but it quickly sours to a fresh pumpkin flavor without out much sweetness or spice. About what I expected. Not having this one again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"For me, pumpkin ales are a novelty to enjoy one or two of in the fall and that’s it. Still, Sam Adams’ is one of the more drinkable examples I’ve come across. Not too shabby at all."
""
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the beautiful coloring, and the even taste throughout. The coloring just screams “autumn”. The colors were deep, and the head was frothy and inviting. The flavoring showed nice pumpkin, with a deep malt background of butter and caramel, without becoming too cheap tasting, as some Sam Adams beers tend to do."

"Serving type: bottle"

"O - a tasty beverage, great style for mix pack, as several in row would be less enjoyable. But this is recommended for all pumpkin fans."
""
""

"O: I rather enjoyed Samuel Adam's seasonal pumpkin offering. Although a rather tried and true style, BBC just got it right with this one in creating a superbly drinkable and well flavored seasonal."
"If you're not big on the whole got to have a pumpkin beer in the fall thing you might want to try this one, it's not overbearing and doesn't bring any bad tastes along with it."
""
""
"Overall Drinkability: Most of Sam's experiments usually show some sort of promise, even if they are not my favorite. This one's not good though. Stick to their Octoberfest."
""
""
""
"O - An easy drinking, modest but tasty example of the pumpkin ale style. Not as spiced and aggressive as many of the most popular examples, but a clean brew that is easy to drink.

"O: I've been avoiding SA for some time now, but in all honesty they put out some decently drinkable stuff. I was expecting this to be a mess, but it's actually kind of enjoyable. I can't see myself drinking more than one at a time, but it still has a decent flavor and aroma profile."

""
"Medium body which thins out on the finish. Clove and nutmeg, touch of cinnamon and vanilla. No true pumpkin taste but thats probably because its not made with this years pumpkins. Tastes like pumpkin beer light. If youre going for a session pumpkin ale make it a long trail pumpkin or a night owl cause this one falls short for being at the same price point."

""
""

"Poured into a Samuel Adams perfect pint glass. Pours clear dark amber with a tall, off-white head that dissipates at a moderate pace. There is a moderate amount of visible tiny bubbles rising in the beer. There are aromas of cinnamon, clove, allspice, and pumpkin. It smells like pumpkin bread. Those pumpkin bread notes are definitely there up front, but they're not very strong. There's the spiciness from the cinnamon, clove, and allspice and the pumpkin flavors complement the malt very well. The body is light to medium with moderate carbonation. The finish is crisp and clean. The drinkability is high. This is a very good beer that serves as a good introduction to this style."

"O- A good pumpkin beer, a great first pumpkin beer."
"O: I am disappointed by this brew. I always love fall seasonal beer (even though most of them are not great.) I would go for Sam Adams Octoberfest over the Pumpkin Harvest. I would not recommend this beer to a friend."

"O: This is a nice pumpkin beer and always enjoy a glass of this during the fall."

Taste brings a firm dose of allspice, clove, cinnamon, moderate toffee and bready malts, muted pumpkin taste compared to other aspects of taste, small grassy and herbal hop presence. Medium bodied, slightly creamy. Solid pumpkin ale, heavy on the malt bill and spice, muting pumpkin qualities."

"Final Thoughts: Like a lot of Samuel Adams beers, their Harvest Pumpkin Ale looks great and smells pretty good but comes up a little short in the actual drinking of it. If they toned down the spices a bit and upped the O.G. then this one might be a real winner, but for now it's just an above average beer that would pair well with a cool autumn night around a campfire."
"Overall I always look forward to drinking my pumpkin ales in the Fall and there is nothing wrong with this one... you could kind of call it a dry pumpkin ale since it isn't very sweet."
"Overall it's ok. I can deal with spicy beer, I'd just like more sweetness to balance but this was lacking balance altogether."
"O: I think August is too early for this beer to be released as I'm sure I will enjoy this beer once fall officially comes. Overall, good seasonal beer, lots of flavor and spice. I could drink a six pack of this for sure!"
"Overall: Each year I have this I like it more. I am not sure if the brew is changing or my tastes are changing as the years go by."

"O: Solid offering from Sam Adams; while the best pumpkin beers on the market (pumking and punkin, perhaps, at least in the Midwest) are quite expensive, I can see myself picking this one up a few times throughout the season when I'm feeling a pumpkin beer. Already grabbed a sixer after tasting it in the harvest 12 pack. Pretty drinkable, I had no problem going through two of these in a night alongside various other beers."
""
""
"The harvest beers seem to come earlier every year. However, I'm a lover of pumpkin beers, when they're well made, and couldn't wait to give this one a try. It's a chestnut brown color, capped with an off-white head. Good clarity. The aroma is pumpkin pie and malt. It smells like autumn. Modest hop scent and a little toasted character...sizable spice component in the smell. The taste is semi-dry, which is probably necessary to keep the beer balanced. Spice, pumpkin, malt, and a low-level sweetness in the flavor. The pie spices are not overdone, which is a good thing in my opinion. Full in body. Better than most in this style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Good, but not great. Worth trying, but not the decadent pumpkin pie experience some fans of the style might be seeking. To its credit, it is more of a beer with pumpkin spice accents than liquid pumpkin pie that happens to resemble beer."
""
"Again, I can't help wondering from previous reviews if this recipe has been tweaked for 2012."
"Decent pumpkin ale. Not outstanding. Has a good smell. Taste is bland to me at least. Could be better. There are better pumpkin beers on the market. This offering is so so. Smells good but the taste is bland. I was expecting more. Would not buy it unless the beer was in a variety pack."
"Another good quality with this beer is the fact that the flavor is more natural overall. Some pumpkin beers rely on artificial extracts to achieve their flavor, but this one uses real pumpkin and it is evident in the taste. With all things considered, the beer easily rates above average and it is one of the better pumpkin brews available."
"O - Again, more of a """spiced beer""" than a """pumpkin beer""". Kind of a weird beer to evaluate. While I really enjoyed the Autumn spices, I think the beer could benefit from a little more pumpkin kick to go with it."
""
"O - A very solid pumpkin ale. Can't beat punkin or pumpking, but its one of my favorite sold in the six pack format. Tasty stuff for sure."

"M&D - acdcurate flavors, could be one of a number of quality pumpkin beers, Where's a beer with actual pumpkin fruit flavor"
"I either like pumpkin beers, like Smuttynose Pumpkin or dislike them, like Post Road (imperials are a different matter!). I like this beer, it is smooth and satisfying, has pumpkin flavor but isn't too overpowering with the spices. Definitely one I would want to drink again."
"Overall - Bleh! It feels like I'm drinking a flat diet pumpkin soda, and a bad one at that. I've had pumpkin ales before; this is a bad example for the style. All the pumpkins in the world won't make the flavor come through if you overkill it with spices."

"A dark amber color with an off-white head. Heavy on the spices, mostly nutmeg and all spice with a bit of cinnamon. Toasted malt and bread aromas with a light sweetness of toffee. The flavor has a nice subtle vanilla note along with the spices. A little bit of gingerbread character to it as well. Not much actual pumpkin to it, but a pretty decent beer anyway."

"Highly drinkable. Great fall flavors with pronounced spices typical of pumpkin pie. Slight carbonation, just enough for what this beer needs. Would gladly have this one again. Among the better of the pumpkin ales I've tried over the years. Nice job Boston Beer Co!"

"After sipping it I remember recalling that it was not that great. I didn't think there was much flavor to it at all. I thought that Shipyard's Pumpkin put this to shame as I had been drinking a lot of it while in Boston. Nothing stood out about this pumpkin. Simply average."
""
"O- Maybe because I had it fresh on-tap that explains the discrepancy between my review and some of the more recent ones, but I thought this was a no-fuss, simple but delicious pumpkin ale."

"I guess I should start this review by saying I don't really care for Pumpkin beers. That being said this is a somewhat more tolerable offering. Color is a nice dark amber with a cola like head that disappeared just as with cola. Smell is like a spiced cookie but with this distracting smell like the smell of salt when you prepare a warm salt water gargle. Taste is that usual spicy after shave that dominates the style. I do appreciate the dryness in the finish which helps to keep the spiciness from getting out of hand. I probably won't seek it out again, but again I don't seek out this style by any brewer."
""

"Overall: Overall, this was a beer that was too strong. It had too many spices, making the taste overly strong. It did have good color and smell, but with a strong taste it was too much for me."

"pours the mest beautiful red/orange sunset haze uve ever seen. fluffy tan head and a big autumn aromatic palate. i smell pumpkin pie filling, clove, and cinnamon, maybe even cardomom, flavor is a bit too spiced for a pumpkin ale in my opinion, but has a nice seasonal respectability. the mouthfeel is medium, but it feels weird in the stomach, maybe a combination of the big malts and spice, but i wouldnt drink a six pack of this. solid beer again from sam, but dont creaming myself over it. if it tasted as good as it looked in the glass, thatd be another story..."

"The beer poured with a slightly amber color head compared with its tan-amber body. Head dissipated quickly and very little lacing on the sides. The aromas include a very slight roasted nuts or a burnt sugar smell with a dominant flavoring of cinnamon and pumpkin flavors. The taste comes with a bittersweet aftertaste, but there is a decent light pumpkin with vanilla-malt flavor. I did like the mouthfeel; it had a good balance between a smooth and carbonation. Overall, not too bad of a pumpkin ale."

"Drinkability is great for a pumpkin ale. Very balanced beer, but also has a ton of really good tastes to it. I really like some of the stronger pumpkin beers, but I wouldn't be able to drink more than one of them. This beer has a great pumpkin taste without overpowering the tastebuds. A sessionable pumpkin that refreshes and warms on an autumnal day."
"Overall, not a pumpkin beer I'd come back to. Like most Sam Adams beer, it's passable."
""
""
"O: good pumpkin ale from Sam Adams, I'd have this one again, great combination of the flavors all around"
"The mouth has low carbonation and a touch of slickness to coat the tongue. I liked this as change of pumpkin. I t has less spice and more pumpkin than normal examples."
"Overall decent but too overspiced and spices not well balanced, needs better flavor of pumpkin, pretty light easy to drink, probably will not buy again until they redo the recipe for the beer."

"Refreshing pumpkin taste without any of the added spices that usually make up a pumkin ale or lager. The beer stays true to its form and is genuinly enjoyable. It seemed to do better than most pumpkins on the shelves but that is in part due to its name brand."
""
""
"This beer was the perfect beer to enjoy UFC 135 with. It reminded me that summer was over and fall was already here. My tip: hurry up and try this beer before it runs out (like Samuel Adams Dunlekweizen). You will be able to find it in your local beer store not your grocery store."

"Well, I'm still not a pumpkin beer fan, but you're really not going to do much better than this one. It's a nice stunning red-orange color, and smells strongly of pumpkin pie. The taste is very nice, it's got more pumpkin and less spices to it than the average pumpkin ale, which goes a long way towards making it actually good. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both solid. I'm still not a pumpkin guy, and wouldn't have picked this up if it weren't in the mix pack, but this is really about as good as far as I'm concerned. Pumpkin beer fans might think otherwise, though."
"Overall a flavorful Pumpkin Ale with just the right amount of spices blended together for a nice tasty experience."
"Its easy enough to drink and all, but I wouldn't go out of my way for this one, unless you're a huge pumpkin freak, but if that's the case, you'll probably be even less impressed with this as you'd probably had many of the better ones."
"Overall, a good autumn brew"
"drinkability/overall- this to me is definitely one of the most drinkable pumpkin beers of the year, I wouldn't necessarily compare it to some of the real big imperial pumpkin beers but this towers over those in drink ability, i would have to say overall this was probably the most session able pumpkin i had this year because it didn't knock you unconscious with spice, good"
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass, best by Feb 12 date on the back. This pours a nice brownish color with a large foamy tan head with good retention. The smells are of pumpkin, spice, and malts. The feel is medium with good carbonation. The taste is sweet and pretty good, I get the pumpkin and spice flavors followed by a nice slightly bitter finish, overall this is a good beer which I'll get again."
"O: I'm not impressed will not be trying this pumpkin ale again."
"Poured into a 13 oz tulip. Pours a bright reddish orange, with a one inch of off white head that drops to a little film quickly. Smell pumpkin, nutmeg, cinnamon, and some carmel. Taste is all of that, a nice amount of pumpkin. Nice body, not very heavy. More carbonation would help. I am not a huge fan of the style, this is a solid pumpkin."
"I can't think of any good reason to buy or drink this beer."
"Overall, i really liked this beer. My only complaint is that it could use more pumpkin flavor with more assertive spices."
"Overall it's an ok, easily drinkable for the masses pumpkin beer. After having Pumking last week I realize how mild and safe this pumpkin beer is to fit in the larger beer market."
"O- Overall this is a decent pumpkin ale. A good balance of pumpkin and spice-and a good representation of the style. Its just somewhat lacking the kick I'm looking for to categorize it as a """good""" pumpkin ale. As with most Sam Adams brews-a good concept of what the style is-but its pretty basic."
"I'm not a huge fan of anything pumpkin, and all in all, this was pretty 'ok'. The pumpkin flavor was pretty subdued but it was for sure noticeable throughout the beer. It was light and a little crisp but didn't have a lot of depth. It could've used an upgrade in the pumpkin aspect of the beer."
"It is not exceptional - the aroma is weak as is the head. I certainly would drink it again, but there are better. I would like to try their double."
"Overall- I really enjoyed this pumpkin ale. It had a great nose, the taste didn't really disappoint, and the feel was just about right."
"D- A few of these go down real easy. They taste delicious but I feel too many of these and the sweetness would become overbearing. Overall this is a beer I'm gonna have to stock up to last me once they stop selling it."
"If the spice wasnt so overdone and the pumpkin came through more, I would be a lot more interested. Sort of a dissapointment."
"This just isn’t how I like my Pumpkin beers to be done, with a boatload of syrupy sweetness and spice covering up a lot of what should really make this beer (the pumpkin) and even giving the overall profile a bit of a medicinal feel. I won’t be trying this one again."
"O - Not a bad pumpkin offering overall. Nice aroma and initial flavor, but falls apart in the middle to back end and ultimately disappoints."
"Overall: A pretty good take on a pumpkin ale. Spicy but balanced fairly well."
"overall... this isn't another liquid pumpkin pie concoction. it has a malt complexity, heavy handed spice profile and dry finish. makes me want to burn some leaves and chop some wood while having a bonfire and then stoking up the fireplace in the bedroom to romance my wife on a cool northern minnesota late october eve. and that's not a bad thing."
"Worth trying, though there are far superior pumpkin beers on the market."
"Not too hot on this one. Looks like an amber-hued brown ale smell of very strong pumpkin spices, methinks a bit much. After a long draw, a slight fresh pumpkin is picked up, a bit of graham cracker-y but then there's this medicinal booze-y after taste that just isn't right. It, along with the spices linger in the sinuses fora while, I'll move on from here."
"O - Drinkable, but the overly intense spice isn't desirable."
"Full bodied with a blast of crisp, zesty spice up front that lingers over the sweeter notes into a slightly dry finish. Hints of pepper, cinnamon, clove, nutmeg and ginger followed by a prominent pumpkin presence as well as some caramel and rye. The spiciness slightly overpowers the pumpkin flavor but it's still pretty flavorful and easy to drink."
"O: I like this beer; however, I think that it could be enhanced and made to be a beer I love."
"In all, this version of this style is relatively good. It definitely is a worth a try, as it is a unique flavor that really brings out the mood of Fall (perfect on a crisp Fall day, I guess...). However, i is so sweet that you probably won't want more than one."
"D - Very drinkable. Pretty decent flavors, but the beer is far too thin and watery and could have used a bit more carbonation."
"This was a pleasant surprise. A pretty well-rounded beer that seemed like a perfect fall/winter beer. I’d give it another try."
"D - Promising appearance and aroma give way to a rather average at best Pumpkin Ale in all other categories... There are many Pumpkin Ales to recommend over this one... Boston Beer's foray into fall seasonals should stick with marzens..."
"Notes: Not a style that works for me. This is my 3rd Pumpkin ale and I can't say it's for me. This isn't bad per the style, though. Only the mouthfeel seems lifeless. I have 5 more bottles of this to get rid of."
"Overall this is a good fall beer and a tasty pumpkin ale."
"I bought this variety pack at a local wine and cheese outlet in Richmond,Il. I can't wait to taste the Double Pumkin Ale !"
"i'd buy this one again."
"(2010) Samuel Adams Harvest Pumpkin Ale is a crystal clear deep amber ale with a small khaki head that fades to a blotch and leaves nice lacing on the glass. There is spice, wood and pumpkin in the nose with notes of nutmeg and vanilla. It's medium-light bodied and pretty smooth. It leaves the mouth a little silty. There's more spice than pumpkin here. I can't isolate a pumpkin flavor. The spices and the hops work together well to provide a moderate bitterness. It has a good, caramelly malt presence that's not too sweet. There's good balance all around. It's very autumny and very Sam Adams. It's American in style, but there seem to be heavy nods to England and Germany here. (appearance 4, smell 4, taste 4, mouthfeel 3.5, overall 4)"
"Overall, this is a pretty good pumpkin beer. I've had one or two with better spice profiles, but I'm glad I can at least taste the spice."
"O: Good, but in a specialty category like this one, this beer doesn't shine past a lot of the other options available. Still, well made and worth drinking."
"o- I guess the brew can be classified under a drinkable pumpkin ale, but there really isn't a pumpkin experience that goes down. Seek out pumking, horseheads pumpkin ale, or dfh for the pumpkin experience"
"Pumpkin ale is certainly a popular creation during this time of year. The great ones are few, while the decent ones are many. Harvest Pumpkin Ale falls into the latter category. It’s pretty good, but doesn’t really distinguish itself from the crowd. It’s also just a tad pumpkin heavy. A little more balance among the spices would go a long way. All in all, pretty good stuff. If you’re a pumpkin beer fanatic, it’s probably one you should check out."
"O: Pretty decent pumpkin ale. I've had a few better, many worse. A good representation of the fall season. This is one of my favorite Sam Adams' brews at the moment."
"Pours a dark caramel with a snow white head (which was surprisingly super white). The smell was a nice mix of spices and malt, smelled some cinnamon, nutmeg, and pumpkin. The taste followed suit, a nice deep malt flavor with the mix of spices, definitely pumpkin, the cinnamon comes through the most but the spices are all there. This one has a medium body with decent carbonation and a bit smoother than what I am used to from Sam Adams. Overall a good beer, nice spice flavor, not too terribly pumpkin that will overpower."
"This is a beer with intense spice and crust characters. Better than average pumpkin ale, very upfront about its spice and grain. I don't think I'd want more than one every few days, but a six-pack once a year would be enjoyable."
"Overall not bad, nice malts, light on the spices, pumpkin has fresh flavor and not a ton of canned or artificial flavors, nice dry bready finish."
"I've had worse, bu this is another sugar and spice bomb. Made for the masses, this is far from a top tier pumpkin brew. OK at best."
"Overall, I don't like pumpkin beers in general, but I find this surprisingly drinkable and easy to sip. It isn't the best pumpkin beer I can remember, but it is far from the worst."
"Overall: Its a slightly below-average pumpkin ale and not one I'd seek out again. This is a tricky style that many breweries fail when undertaking. However, it isn't nearly as bad as other pumpkin ales I've had."
"Overall this is not a bad beer, it isn't even a bad pumpkin beer, but not one I'm going to go out of my way to drink. I'm glad it comes in the variety pack because it is a nice seasonal to throw in a session."
"Clear, dark copper, more reddish than orange, with a short beige cap that settled to a collar within a couple of minutes. Lots of caramel and spices in the aroma, mostly nutmeg but with some cinnamon and ginger as well, slightly toasty. Slightly vegetable quality up front in the flavour, moderate bitterness that appeared towards the finish, sweet and spicy in the middle, a little bready. More of the nutmeg and ginger with slight cinnamon that was apparent in the nose. Slightly slick in the finish, nice texture overall, medium to light bodied with moderate carbonation. A decent pumpkin ale, nothing out of the ordinary but pretty easy drinking."
"The alcohol wasn't too high in this and I couldn't detect it at all during my session. Although I like the Octoberfest, I feel that Sam should make this the fall seasonal. This would be worthy of that moniker and there's no doubt that this is a welcome addition to their current offering of beers!"
"O: I like this one for the subdued spiciness. Much more of a session Pumpkin ale."
"Darker in color than other pumpkin ale's I've had. Did have a very nice pumpkin like smell to it. This beer did have a very pumpkin taste to me but it was a different kind of taste that I really can't describe. I found this beer more interesting than most and will be finishing the 6 pack I purchased."
"Draft - At first, I liked this beer, but after a couple of sips in, I couldn’t drink it anymore. Between the nutmeg and cinnamon, it smelled pretty good. I got some pumpkin in the taste but I felt like the sweetness overpowered it. As it warmed up, it got progressively worse."
"This one is heavy on the spices so beware if that's not your thing!"
"O - This has great smell and taste, almost like mulled wine. However, the carbonation really takes the flavor out of it while it's in your mouth. If this had a bit more pumpkin and less fizz, it would go from good to excellent, I bet it would be even better on tap."
"Honestly, this is more like an American Amber Ale with some pumpkin flavoring than a true pumpkin ale. A good fall beer regardless."
"O- Better than expected. I'd rate this as a poor man's Punkin'- a good pumpkin beer with a decent spice mix and good balance, just not quite enough power in the taste."
"Not a bad pumpkin ale - fairly full bodied compared to most Sam Adams selections. And a decent value."
"O: Promising sight and smell, but falls short once it hits the lips. I was slightly put off by the sourness I detected in the aftertaste. There are much better pumpkin ales out there for consumption this Halloween."
"Burnished copper color that kicks up an inch high head of beige foam that quickly recedes back and settles out to a sizzling surface. Aroma of cinnamon and subtle nutmeg. Balanced flavor of biscuity malt, notes of honey and ginger, cinnamon and nutmeg. Some floral notes and a slight lemony snap in the finish, a peppery spice bite lingers. Not a lot of pumpkin flavor to pick out, but it tastes like a respectable slice of pie. Even mouthfeel, moderate carbonation, finishes a bit tingly. Good beer overall."
"Mouthfeel has a creamy texture with a nice medium body feel. Overall, Sam Adams has done a fine job with their pumpkin beer but it's certainly not my favorite. I could see how this would appeal to the typical Sam Adams market."
"O- Drank this one out of a friends sampler pack, will be sure to never do so again."
"O- I waited until the temperature outside was at least 55F before I consumed this one. It is truely a wonderful fall beer and one I will look forward to next year."
"O: Good beer, but not the best pumpkin ale. Got it in a variety pack, but other then that, I've never seen it. Much better then some in this style, but this one tends to lean on the spices more than the pumpkin."
"Overall, one of my favorite pumpkin beers. I really appreciate that they tone down the spices and let the subtle taste of pumpkin stand out."
"C"
"Not a bad beer, easy drinking. Nice surprise."
"O: It seems like no time of the year (and I include even winter) brings out the seasonal offerings like fall. Not only are there Marzen and Marzen-like offerings, there is the pumpkin beer. Sam's attempt is similar to many of their offerings: Not terrible, but not amazing. It is light on spice and body, and it has a bit too much sweetness. There is some decent pumpkin at the start, but the earthy, starchy qualities of the pumpkin disappear too quickly."
"O: My search for a great pumpkin ale continues. I wasn't really expecting much from this one, so it didn't disappoint, but it just lacked much in the way of both pumpkin and spice (other than cinnamon)."
"Overall - It was pretty average. There's much better pumpkin ales out there. This was more a lot of clove and cinnamon, little pumpkin."
"12 oz bottle. Pours clear amber with an off-white head and some lacing. Aroma is of toasted malt, caramel, spices and pumpkin. Medium, oily, slightly crisp body. Toasted malt, caramel, cinnamon, nutmeg, herbal hops and pumpkin nicely balanced on the palate. It was my first pumpkin beer and I enjoyed it."
"O - Impressed by this fall seasonal. I would pick up a 6 pack of this each fall. So far, the best of the fall sampler pack."
"Taste is pumpkin and spice, nicely balanced and with a sharp, peppery undertone. Overall, a tasty and well-done pumpkin ale, though not among my favorites."
"Overall this was just not a good beer and was soon poured down the sink, the spices were just too over powering and the beer was not enjoyable in the least."
"O-Exactly what you'd expect from Sam Adams, a decent drinkable pumpkin ale that someone just starting out can try."
"Another one from the mixed 12. Poured a nice dark red color, with a bit of creamy white head. Pretty standard all around, both on the nose and on the palate. Some pumpkin spice, sweet malt, a little caramel and an easy drinking medium body. Not bad but not much more."
"Overall - A poor representation of what I've come to know as the standard for this beer style, and somewhat of a let down given the great pumpkin ales brewed by the neighboring breweries. My only thoughts were that I was glad it wasn't my first pumpkin ale."
"O: The head was disappointing. Smelled good, but not much pumpkin in the taste. Mouthfeel was also a bit disappointing."
"I was really excited to try this one since I look forward to the release of pumpkin beers each fall. The beer pours a orangish-brown color with a white head. The aroma is classic pumpkin ale, with lots of pumpkin and nutmeg notes. The flavor is more of the same. I get a ton of pumpkin, along with the classic pumpkin pie spices of cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice. I also get some caramel malt. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Not quite as good as Weyerbacher Imperial Pumpkin or ST Pumpking, but a step above most of the pumpkin ales that are on the market. I'm liking this Autumn Pack so far from SA."
"I could definitely could have a 6 of these mostly because the ABV was low and I enjoyed the spices."
"Good drinking Pumpkin for the masses....enjoy after raking leaves!"
"Pours a medium dark brown with only a thin layer of carbonation on top. Scent of pumpkin and spices are very evident. Very flavorful and full of spice. Drinks rather smooth that goes well with the fall weather. Has all the great spices that are in pumpkin pie including cinnamon and nutmeg. Quite delicious and gets me in the fall mood. The only downside is that I can only find this beer in the Fall Sam Adams Sampler Pack."
"o - a solid beer and fits the style. goes down easy, could see myself drinking a few no problem. one of the better fall seasonals i have had this year."
"Overall: The flavor is good, perhaps a bit too mild. Nothing real special, but it's a decent pumpkin ale."
"Overall this is a decent pumpkin ale, but I would like a little more going on."
"Glad the pack only came with two. It isn't bad, but there are far better pumpkin beers out there."
"O - For me this beer went through a lot of stages...the pour was terrible, the aroma provided what I want in a pumpkin beer, the flavors started nice then finished not so nice...this was just another average pumpkin beer for me"
"This is one of the few Pumpkin Ales that actually manage to get a very good pumpkin flavor in the beer without overloading on the spices. True, they are present but I think the actual pumpkin """meat""" is displayed rather nicely."
"I give this one an overall of 4.0 not bad for their first try at Puumpkin Ale and very drinkable, not the best one I have had but very nice."
"Pours a deep amber, a slightly caramel head quickly dissipates into a thin film. Smell is allspice, some pumpkin, sweet malts. Taste is pretty full, allspice, tiny bit of clove, some subtle roasted malt. Not hugely spiced. Pumpkin is throughout and works ok with the minor spicing and sweetness. Mouthfeel is fine, some larger bubbles off the tongue, medium bodied. Overall this delivers as a pumpkin ale but not something I will be purchasing again, nothing really stands out for me."
"Pours from the 12 oz. bottle a reddish brown color with a 1/2 finger off-white head that vanished almost as soon as I was finished pouring. The carbonation is very light, I can practically count the bubbles on one hand. Aroma is of spice and a light caramel note. 1st sip brings a note of spice (cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice) with a slight hint of caramel and a rich background of pumpkin. This is the closest to the """pumpkin pie in a glass""" cliche that I have ever come across. The mouthfeel is medium bodied. Overall, an Ok beer, but not something I would seek out again."
"Pours a clear, russet color with a creamy tan head. Pleasantly spiced pumpkin pie aroma along with caramel malt and subtle pumpkin. Mellow flavor all around. Spices show up in the aftertaste...cinnamon, ginger, clove...smooth and easy going. Sweet-ish caramel and a touch of bread, but not a tremendous amount of pumpkin. Smooth and drying in the finish. Certainly not bad at all. I could drink several of these and be perfectly happy."
"Fall 2011 has arrived! Into a pint glass this pours a very clear ruby red highlighted amber color under a light tan colored head. Aroma is mild with a note of pumpkin spice and perhaps a hint of cinnamon. A hefty grainy toasted malt body comes through in the mouthfeel and finishes with a somewhat peppery spiced detail. Not much sweetness seems to come through in the flavor to me and I am led to believe that this is more in the style of a traditional pumpkin ale as opposed to the BIG and eclectic Fall brews of American craft beer today. I'm curious to try this with one food..."
"Drinkable with a pretty good flavor. I would say a tad too much spice for the body and size of the beer."
"Overall: I will have to say that is not the best pumpkin beer I have tried, but a reasonable one at best. Wouldn't mind trying it out on draft if possible. I would try it again if it were offered to me."
"Taste is very satisfying, creamy full mouthfeel, nice pumpkin flavor,but not overwhelming, some roasted malts round this out nicely, DFH pumpkin ale is my fave, but I would put this one as my runner up, very well done...good stuff! :)"
"Pours out a dark red amber with a thin tan head that leaves little retention and not much lacing. The smell is pumpkin and spices. The taste starts with some spices followed by some hops and pumpkin. The sweet caramel malt is consistent through out and gives it a nice balanced taste. The mouthfeel is sticky, but easy to drink and overall a very good tasting beer that gives Sam Adams another winner."
"Overall: Love it. With good brews like this, it makes me wonder how Sam Adams puts out some terribly mediocre stuff. But I guess with the kind of selection they offer, I'm not going to like everything."
"Overall a pretty tasty beer but not one that I would like to have more than one or two of. I was anticipating this out of all of the beers in the Harvest Collection, but unfortunately it's not my favorite. I would recommend giving it a sampling though."
"A nice addition to the fall sampler. Not the best pumpkin ever but it's still pretty good stuff."
" Pretty refreshing."
"O - Overall I enjoyed this sam adam's offering. I'd rather drink this than a shipyard."
"An ok pumpkin ale, especially for the ABV, but there are way better out."
"O: I was disappointed with this one, but perhaps it's just me. I guess I just don't really care much for pumpkin and spice in beer, or, at the least, I'm just not in the mood for it. I found it quite hard to drink and I think I'll pass on this one in the future. That said, I gave the remaining brews to my buddy who promptly drank them down and said he quite liked them, so don't let my review deter you. A solid offering from the Boston Brewing Company, just not for me!"
"Pours out a clear dark red beer, two finger whitish head. Smells of pumpkin spices, lightly scented. A sweet tasting beer, mildly offset by subtle spices. No real mouthfeel to speak of. The beer overall is decent comparing to other pumpkin beers that ive had."
"I liked it just fine, but would prefer one of their Octoberfest lagers if I had my choice in the cooler."
"Update: I don’t know if it’s because it’s had another month to sit or it’s just the reviewer (me) picking up different things from the same beer but revisiting the SA Pumpkin Ale I definitely pick up a pumpkinny-malt profile that (going back to my notes and previous review) I either missed or didn’t notice at first. It’s there, folks. And it’s delicious."
"That said, I still like this beer and would consider buying it in a six-pack (if that was an option), especially at Samuel Adams' price point."
"Overall, a nice offering from a very solid brewery. There's nothing they can't pull off, make a ton of to include in boxes and ship to the masses. Well done!"
"O- The taste kills it, and the taste is the most important part of beer"
"As far as macro pumpkin beers go, it's good. Mostly spice rather than pumpkin, but still good. Just not great."
"Oh, and BTW, PLEASE SELL THIS BEER IN 6 AND 12 PACKS ON ITS OWN!!!"
"Overall an easy drinking beer that hints at pumpkin pie, but I tend more towards wanting more sweetness like some other pumpkin beers. However, they did good on making an easy drinking subtle version."
"Cheers!"
"O: I like it. The 2nd best I have had of the style. (Pumking rules...but too much ABV for regular consumption. This is a nice beer that provides caramel malt, pumpkin, and spice flavors. Not over the top...but solid, tasty, and drinkable."
"Overall: I thought it was a very solid, well-constructed pumpkin ale; a nice addition to the Autumn mix."
"O - This has good drinkability. I wouldn't mind a few pints of this on a breezy autumn night. Overall, I thought this was a pretty solid, and easy going pumpkin ale. I think it's worth a try, and I would drink it again."
"Overall: Thus far, I've found one excellent Pumpkin ale (Schlafly), two very good ones (Summit Imperial Pumpkin Porter and Pumking), several fair examples, and a couple of poor ones. While this is fairly solid, I think this would have to fall between the 'very good' and 'fair' categories."
"Enough said…"
"overall- This is the second best pumpkin ale I've had, BJ's brewery's Pumpkin ale being the best. Ive had a few pumpkin ales and none have pulled off the pumpkin pie taste. I know that is exactly what those breweries were going for but that is what I look for in a pumpkin ale. I picked this up in the harvest sam adams 12 pack. This was the best out of the 6."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass, the beer pours with a healthy, small bubbled, chunky, light tan head atop a vibrant, bright, dark auburn coloring with only a slight hazing. The nose is a very light semisweetness of pumpkin, with a light blend of cinnamon and nutmeg spicing. Aromas are much lighter than most pumpkin brews. Flavor is a rich malt sweetness, with some pumpkin bread characteristics at the tail-end of the palate. The spicing is very light and faint on the palate, but deepens with the aftertaste, and does a good job balancing overall. The aftertaste is light and balanced, as I said before, but not overly remarkable. The finish is quick and a bit on the limp side. It just quietly exits the palate without a lot of fanfare. This one had a decent start, but comes up lame down the stretch."
"Poured into a standard pint a rich deep rich copper/bronze with a thinner slight off white head atop,aromas are not overspiced wich is a very good thing,toasty with a little cardamom and mace,faint cinnamon in there as well.A lighter mouthfeel detracts from the flavors and richness of the beer in my opinion.Flavors have a real pumpkin flair to them,again the spice is held in check well,and its quite warm and toasty.A solid pumpkin ale,bump up the body on this and it would be great."
"Pretty drinkable for what it is; a good fall weather beer. I wasn't expecting to be able to do more than one, but I think I could do a few of these without a problem."
"I can dig on this. I think the ambiance helps, but this beer screams Fall."
"2011 Batch with an expiration date of Feb 2012. Sampled on September 8, 2011. This beer is handsome and inviting on the eye with its dark amber-copper color and softly floating head above some wild, ongoing carbonation bubbles. The pumpkin and spices announce themselves in a lower key on the nose. They are there but not overdone. The body is on the full side. Clove, pepper, and sweet malts rule the day in the flavor followed by a moderately bitter finish. This lands high on my list of pumpkin ales but not the highest. Still, quite good."
"O - Overall its an OK pumpkin creation, but not my favorite style. Not over the top on spices so that is somewhat what I like out of pumpkin ales. Personally it needs to be 7-10 % alcohol to mix up with the flavors."
"What better way to celebrate the lovely, cooler weather than with a new (to me, anyway) pumpkin beer? This one pours a clear dark tawny-russet topped by a finger of copper-tinged tan foam. The nose comprises toffee, nutmeg, cinnamon, light cocoa, mandarin orange syrup, and a touch of dark wheat. The taste holds notes of lightly toasted caramel, mandarin orange syrup, brown sugar, cinnamon, light clove, light toasted pumpkin seeds, and a good amount of wheat. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly watery feel. Overall, a very solid pumpkin beer, one that doesn't overdo the spice and goes down easily."
"And the flavor... Ah. THIS was the hit of pumpkin I was seeking. Again, the CO2 when cold and freshly poured cuts the rich pumpkin, malt, clove, cinnamon, and allspice. Let it warm a bit, let some of that CO2 enter the atmosphere, and you have a rich, tasty tribute to fall that makes me happy it's September. I increased my mouthfeel from a 2.5 to a 3, and increased the overall from a 3.5 to a 4, but you have to let it warm a bit."
"A gorgeous orange and tan color and delicious spices. While I did taste some pumpkin, it was mostly in the background. But those warm, delectable pumpkin pie spices were right up front. Cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, they're all there. It was still refreshing and crisp, too. And even though it is heavily spiced, it is fantastically well balanced."
"O - Damn if this beer isn't a perfect companion for a cool fall day. The upfront spice and pumpkin in the aroma is perfectly reserved in flavor which makes it quite sessionable. It's one of the only beers of the style I could have multiple pints of without growing tired out quickly. Smooth and crisp, I think I found one of my new fall favorites!"
"Overall, this stuff is pretty poor. Not a good flavor. Just a haphazard mix of flavors that do not mix well together. I don't have a problem with pumpkin in beer but it seems like they didn't spice this right."
"O: A very nice Sam Adams. If I walked into a bar, I could order this and be satisfied, but I won't ever be elated to see it on tap. I'll enjoy it's brother in the Sampler soon."
"O: I was surprised how much I enjoyed this beer. I guess I was expecting the ghost of cranberry lambic pasts..."
"O- I love this beer. If you've read my other reviews, all four of them ;) you know my experiences are limited. Again, this is the only pumpkin ale I've had. I do look forward to trying more, but I don't really miss the pumpkin like a lot of you do. On the other hand I'm not a huge fan of pumpkin pie. Still, this screams Fall to me and I love it, and look forward to trying more."
"O: I like this years batch much better than last years. It seems to have more spices and is heartier for sure. It actually seems like a pumpkin beer this year"
"M - Clean and clear, no metallic tones or anything else to keep you from drinking two or three or ten."
" I don't know if I would drink alot of them but not too bad."
"D: I'm a big fan of """pumpkin beers""" and this beer was damn good, nice representation of the style, however my go to """pumpkin beer""" is still Michigan Brewing's """Screamin Pumpkin Spiced Ale""" it just has more character and flavor than the Sam's."
"O: Trick or treat? Trick! There are much better pumpkin beers out there, and much better fall beers from Sam Adams. Go for their Octoberfest for an autumn SA beer. Look elsewhere for a decent pumpkin ale."
"O - Not too good. Flavor profile lacks depth for a style that generally has a good character from the spice. It's kinda like a Sam Light with some spice added."
"Overall- I have vowed to drink more pumpkin beers this year, but I don't know how many I will drink if they are very close to this. I like this, but wouldn't have more than one. Maybe when it gets closer to Thanksgiving I would have less of an issue with them. Guess we will see. 3.5/5"
"D: I dunno, maybe one pumpkin ale in all the world is plenty, and this one isn't it: it's not so much a pumpkin ale as it is an ale with pumpkin. It saves itself, however, by foregrounding the flavors of pumpkin pie that suit beer (nutmeg, cinnamon) and leaving behind the others (no vanilla). There are two more in my variety pack: I'm drinking one because what the hell, but I'm giving the other to my girlfriend."
"Pours a clear, burnt red color with a medium, off-white head that hangs around for a bit. Scent is very spicy with some nutmeg and malt roasted malt aromas. Taste is like pumpkin pie in your mouth! This is the most pumpkin pie-like pumpkin beer I've ever had. It's pretty tasty. Nice flavors of pumpkin pie with cinnamon and nutmeg. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a spicy finish. Drinkability is fairly high. Overall, this beer kinda makes me start appreciating pumpkin beers. Good example."
"Overall: Good beer overall. I could see myself reaching for this time after time during the fall if I lived in a colder climate. Definitely worth a shot."
"O: I should say that I am a fan of malt heavy beers, and while I do enjoy a good IPA, I really like the Irish Reds and Scottish Ales. This is a malty beer with a good herbal/spice finish, it's a solid beer, maybe not the world's best pumpkin ale but it's pretty damn good. No I wouldn't trade SA's Octoberfest for it... but it would make a nice seasonal compliment to the Octoberfest"
"O - A good beer, not great, nothing special, but at the same time I could drink a few of these."
"Mouth feel and overall - Smokey and medium-bodied. Peppery and dry. Would be perfect to enjoy by a campfire."
"Pours a dark, reddish amber color with a thin off-white head that quickly dissipated. The smell is dominated by pumpkin pie and nutmeg, there is a slight metallic aroma and a hint of ginger. It tastes of nutmeg and ginger with a hint of pumpkin pie and roasted malt and a bready aftertaste. The beer is smooth with a medium body and a dry finish. This is a nice beer, I thought the aroma was nice but the taste was a little overpowered ginger."
"Do not wait for Halloween to try this one!"
"let me start by saying that I love pumpkin ales. This pumpkin from sam adams is fantastic. The color is a rich brown orange. The smell is packed with ginget and pumpkin spices. The taste is of brown sugar, ginger, cinnamon and molasses. I think the marriage of pumpkin pie and beer is a no brainer... And this harvest pumpkin from sam adams is no joke. I got this in a variety pack but I would love to find it on it's own- a great beer."
"Overall, I loved it last year, and I love it this year. Don't get me wrong, its no Pumpking, but this is a damn fine pumpkin ale that could hold its own any day among all the others. I would rate this as my 4th favorite pumpkin ale to date. I'm not sure why the bros rated it so low, but don't take their opinion, make your own!"
"Like dessert in bottle. A sessionable beer that's perfect for the holidays (even though it comes out in August)."
"Pumpkin beers seem all the rage with breweries now a days, but this is not one of the better examples. Less spice and more pumpkin is needed here. For the very definition of what this style can do, check out Southern Tier Pumking,"
"As far as pumpkin beers go, I could easily enjoy two of these in a row, and possibly a third before I became 'over-spiced' myself. Nicely done!"
"Overall in all fairness I am not a fan of pumpkin beers, this one though seems more brown hot spiced forward and I enjoy that more. I could drink this one more easily than other pumpkin beers that is for sure."
"This is kind of an average pumpkin beer in my opinion. I think a little more pumpkin spicing and a little less hoppiness would make this truly shine as a fall seasonal."
"I appreciate a good pumpkin beer, but this one seems overly spiced for my tastes. A decent showing and not so spicy that it's not drinkable, although I can't see myself having more than one in a sitting."
"The overall beer is definitely worth it, but not more than one or two(even with a meal). Your palate will appreciate you more if you try something else before/after this. Save it for dessert."
"Harvest Pumpkin Ale has some surprisingly good characteristics. It's a much bigger beer than it really is. The flavors are highly present and very assertive. You can drink one of these and thoroughly enjoy it and then move onto something more sessionable."
"PUMPKIN STILL ROCKS BUT THERE ARE BETTER ONES"
"A bottle of this was given to me from a friend. He wasn't sure if I had tried it before and I hadn't so it worked out really well. This beer pours out as an brownish amber color with an off white head the is a bit fizzy. The smell of this beer reminded me a little bit of the Octoberfest, I suppose that makes sence. The only difference on the nose was the addition of a little pumpkin aroma. The taste was full of autumn spices and the lingering pumpkin flavor in the aftertaste. The overall on this beer is that it's pretty good but a little tricky to get your hands on. I feel the Octoberfest in far superior to this brew and it's more accessable."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, mild kick, very good representation of style, this is a nice beer to drink for a long time if you're in the mood for the style."
"overall a very solid ale, not the best of the style, but consistent and not something i would turn away from."
"Harvest Pumpkin Ale is a nice Pumpkin Ale; however, if you are looking for a stronger pumpkin flavor Michigan Brewing Screaming Pumpkin Spiced Ale would be worth a try."
"D: I like it. Spice is spot on ( not to strong ), it has a decent pumpkin aspect, and a good solid beer back it all up. A seasonal, but not a novelty. Rich, toasty, and roasty malts do a good job of matching the pumpkin and spice while letting both shine. Nicely rounded and balanced - very drinakable version of style."
"Pumpkin beer...why not! Best way to describe this beer would be to say...a lite/sugar free pumpkin roll! The malt and spice help to offset a sweetness that can get to sweet...if you know what I mean. I expected more from the aroma and maybe it will come as the beer warms. As far as taste....it's tasty...can't lie. I mean seriously pumpkin beer? It's decent. I could drink maybe two per sitting after that I would need to hang myself by my tongue....in other words...not a session beer for me. But if one is looking for a unique taste....this is a beer for her or him!"
"Situation: Halloween Eve watching Penn State-Michigan; still no defense for us, RichRod! Glassware: Yuengling pint... Appearance: Dark chestnut body (darker than expected with the typically stubborn Sam Adams off-white head... Aroma: pumpkin spice leaps forth; some other underlying hops and spices are present as well... Palate: medium-bodied, lightly oily in texture; inoffensive in its profile; a flourish early, flat late... Taste: more than a bit malty, although the pumpkin spice may have something to do with that; enjoyable softened by the malt profile... Overall: I have little interest in vegetable-infused eer, but for a holiday, I will admit that the beer as the maltiness to substitute for an Octoberfest and stand out a bit in its uniqueness...a second bottle tonights reveals a bit more drinkability and pleasure..."
"Carbonation is upfront and builds to fill the mouth. The malt is sweet with a taste of nutmeg and cinnamon in the midst of it all pumpkin makes a presents."
"Way too much spice for my liking, these holiday spiced beers need to be subtle especially if you want any trace pumpkin to come through. Not bad but one bottle is more than enough."
"Drinkability: It's okay. It's something I could drink again and be alright with it, but I'm not going to run out and buy a whole bunch of them."
"Still glad Sam Adams is brewing different kinds of beers even if they are at times a bit weak."
"Everything balanced on this beer, but balanced to the low side. It shouldn't offend too many palates."
"Overall an enjoyable pumpkin ale."
"D: Average drinkability. A future purchase is unlikely."
"D - I could drink a couple of these, with a pie of course. A very good Pumpkin beer for the price."
"I am normally not a huge fan of pumpkin beers, as I find most of them to be simply overwhelming with pumpkin spice. That being said, this is by far the best Pumpkin Ale I have ever had, as the BBC does a great job of keeping everything in balance, and not letting the pumpkin flavor overwhelm the beer. Don't get me wrong, you still get a good dose of pumpkin, but it's perfectly blended with caramel malts and some spicy hop notes. A great holiday brew, as it just tastes like fall and winter."
"Pours a pretty amber color, with a fluffy off-white head. Very clear, and nicely carbonated. Smells decent, a fair amount of pumpkin and a conglomerate of spices that belong with it. Taste begins with a lot of pumpkin and picks up some bitterness towards the finish. I get the typical medley of cinnamon and nutmeg. Feel is carbonated and sharp. Maybe it's the spices, but I'd prefer the feel to be a little smoother. Drinks decently. Definitely an above average offering of a pumpkin ale, imo."
"D: Could drink this all day but it's not a great example of a pumpkin brew. Probably good it's not out there much other than in the 12 packs."
"Second pumpkin beer I've had and I now know I'm not a fan of this style."
"My dad purchased this as part of a mixed 12 pack containing 6 different Sam Adams beers. Pours a deep amber colour with off-white head. Nice lacing on the glass. Smells of cinnamon, nutmeg, all-spice and pumpkin, pretty much how you'd expect a pumpkin beer to smell I'd guess. Flavour isn't as sweet as the nose would imply, but that makes this easier to drink than some of the bolder pumpkin beers. Nice carbonation level."
"Drinkability: A very good seasonal brew that I would get a six of--if it were an option. Nothing out of the ordinary--just a very well crafted brew."
"D: Pretty drinkable. It's not top-notch by pumpkin standards at all, but it goes down easy and won't turn off your average beer drinker like some of the more out-there styles do. That said, it's also not terribly interesting to drink, either."
"D- Not terrible, but nothing special. Seems generic and run of the mill. I expected more and was let down."
"This beer pours a deep amber color, with a white frothy head. The smell is of pumpkin spices, with a faint hint of pumpkins. The taste of the beer is sweet, almost caramel like, with pumpkin spices. Not much pumpkin flavor, more so just pumpkin spices. I was hoping for more pumpkin flavor. The mouthfeel is medium. I would consider this a drinkable beer, but again I was hoping for more pumpkin flavor."
"Boston Beer Company--Samuel Adams--Harvest Pumpkin Ale--Ale Brewed With Pumpkin and Spices--2010 12 oz. Bottle. 5.70% ABV. 20 IBU's? (4.0 / 5.0) No sediment. Big dense lasting half inch lacy orange white head. Clear dark bright rich amber orange color. Malty toasted rich pumpkin nutmeg cinnamon mild ginger all spice hop front. Rich roasty pumpkin caramelsmooth malty spicy mildly creamy sweet body. Earthy crusty rich ginger mild all spice hop clean satisfying end. Strong pumpkin yet smooth malty well made brew. Sampled on 11/15/2010 from Autumn Classics12-Pack purchased for $13.99 at Fred Meyer, Ballard, Seattle."
"Beer is medium and body, the spices are primarily cinnamon and carries through to the back of the mouth, creeping forward with the swallow as almost an aftertaste. Beer is mildly sweet in the forward and candied in the middle although its not pronounced. The finish is mildly dry. Drinkability is fine. Overall its a decent pumpkin beer."
"This is a spice heavy pumpkin ale. I prefer pumpkin ales more subtle than this, where you can actually taste pumpkin and not just spices. One of these is plenty as it is definitely taste bud fatiguing."
"Lightly toasted malt up front. Pumpkin pie and graham cracker malt sweetness fill in the palate, backed by prominent (but not overdone) notes of nutmeg, clove, cinnamon, and vanilla. Cinnamon toast in the finish, with some light herbal bitterness around the edges. Lingering pumpkin pie sweetness. Moderate to medium body that could use a little creamier mouthfeel. Still, this was a nice surprise out of the SA fall sampler pack."
"High drink ability, this is definitely a pumpkin beer one could have a couple of in a night. Lighter body than some others I've tried makes it go down very easily and doesn't fill you up right away. Only got two of these in the fall harvest pack but I would definitely pick up a sixer of it. This had the most pronounced pumpkin and spice flavor of any I tried this season. An above average beer with everything one expects from the style present."
"D: As a big fan of pumpkin ales, I like to try any that I happen to come across. Typically I don't usually buy Sam Adams (mainly because it is so readily available and I've had most of them and I like to try a new beer every time I drink) but this is my first go around with this particular pumpkin ale. Overall, not the best pumpkin but definitely not the worst. A good pumpkin ale to say the least."
"Slick and somewhat mellow carbonation makes for a creamy, appetizing mouthfeel. Just a hint of dryness peeks through in the end along with faint warmth and dusty spice."
"D: A solid beer and certainly one of the better examples of the style. Unfortunately, the beer is only sold as part of the Samuel Adams Harvest Collection 12 pack."
"This one I didn't find overly impressive. It starts off with an attractive dark copper hue and and a bunch of light tan foam swirling in my perfect pour glass. The aroma is nicely malted, and after that it gets kinda weird. The flavor starts off with caramel and pumpkin that's a bit sweet. After sitting for a few seconds it develops a mild sourness that lingers and distracts from the initial impact. Overall I don't think the beer is that good because of the aftertaste. This one sure looks better than it tastes. Sorry guys, this one just doesn't work for me."
"Overall a good harvest drink and the 5.7% abv is a pleasing touch."
"Morey's Bottom Line: A pleasant surprise. A great example of the style in my opinion. This and the Boston Lager are the two best beers in the fall 12 pack from Sam Adams with the Octoberfest getting an honorable mention."
"This is a pretty good pumpkin ale. I found it to be quite a bit sweeter than some other ones which I've had, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. I would have preferred a bit more spice, but the sweetness is quite well-done because the pumpkin helps balance it out as the beer warms. Sam Adams rarely disappoints, and this is no exception. I would definitely have this beer again even though it's not the BEST pumpkin ale that I've had."
"D - This is a nice pumpkin ale. There are betters out there. And there are worse out there, too. It works for the price."
"Blah... I had such high expectations. This beer does nothing for me personally. It doesn't have the spice, depth or character that several other Pumpkin offerings (Dogfish Head, Post Road) seem to have. I honestly cannot taste anything that gives me the feeling that pumpkin was even used. I drank three to be sure. I would drink it if it was free but if I'm spending my money... Dogfish would be what I'd buy."
"Drinkability got better as the beer went on and I stopped trying to think about it. Like Candy Corn at Halloween, enjoy it during it's consumption window - but you'll never desire consuming this in off-seasons."
"D- Not one of the better pumpkin ales out there... in fact one of the worst I have tried. Not terrible, but not worth trying."
"Pours a clean orange-ish to copper color with a tan head. In the aroma, earthy and gourd like fruitiness. In the taste, cinnamon and vanilla, a light maltiness. A spice like bite and a light bodied mouthfeel, with a dry, spicy aftertaste. Big spice, yet not too overwhelming."
"Adam beers for the most part,but this is one of their best. I will say this, if your looking to try a pumpkin ale for the first time then this may be your best bet, not only because of the mild pumpkin/pumpkin pie spice flavores but because its a darn good beer and Sam Adams is around everywhere."
"D: I thought the strong flavors might become grating after a while, but I was ready for more by the end of the glass. Two or three is probably the max though."
"This one is strictly right down the middle and lies just short of mediocrity. I guess this one is okay for pumpkin beers, certainly not offensive, but definitely not one of the top 15 out there. Unless you really dig all of the beers in this mixer, this one doesnt warrant a special purchase."
"D - Somewhat average but I would definitely need more flavor to drink this beer again in the future."
"D: Pretty drinkable, the flavors are all there, maybe some more pumpkin would be nice."
"D- This beer was good. Not my favorite pumpkin ale but don't get me wrong I wouldn't mind this as its own 6 pack. Nice pumpkin ale Sam Adams!"
"D- This one suffers the fateof most pumpkin beers. That is, it's pretty much a one-and-done in any one sitting. That said, it's a beer I'd drink again. Possibly a good fall harvest/Thanksgiving brew."
"I wouldn't drink this if other things are available, although it isn't the worst pumpkin I've had."
"D: Easily the best pumpkin beer I have had to date with malt allowed to maintain the lead with support from spice and pumpkin rather than the other way around. This one is more like a beer spiked with pumpkin instead of a pumpkin pie with a dash of beer."
"Drinkability: Yeah, I could really drink this beer all day during the nice, temperate and cool fall; moderate ABV, a body that's not going to weigh you down and a nice set of flavors are really fitting for the style. I have to say, I'm fairly impressed -- not that Sam Adams isn't typically solid (IMHO), but this one really kind of exceeded my expectations. While it may not compete with a Double Frog Hollow or Pumking with a year of age on it, it is really super solid."
"Picked up a SA Harvest twelve pack to try the Dunkel and the Pumpkin. Poured into a stemmed glass. Dark orange color, nearing a shade of burnt rust. Fairly large white head. A nice looking beer to start. Smell had a lot of spice notes to it. Taste was appealing, with flavors of cinnamon, nutmeg and pumpkin really standing out. Mouthfeel was appropriate for a pumpkin ale - smooth but with a bit of heartiness. Drinkability was good, as this beer had a bit of body to it, and had an enticing flavor that made you want to take the next sip. As this is Sam Adams' first commercial venture into the seasonal and finicky world of pumpkin ales, I was skeptical at first. But I will have to admit, SA released a satisfying brew with this one. I would buy this in six packs if it became available in the future."
"D. Overall this is a very good brew and would pick up a six pack if I saw it in the store."
"Pours a bright, clear reddish brown with an off white head that leaves a good bit of lace on the way down. The smell is typical pumpkin pie spices namely the nutmeg, cinnamon and allspice. The taste matches the smell. Upfront you get the typical pumpkin pie spice flavors. This is backed by a solid caramel malt base with little if any evident hop bitterness or flavor/aroma. This beer is crisp and relatively dry the finish leaves a lingering pie spiciness. I'm glad that it isn't overly sweet and is well attenuated I prefer a pumpkin beer to be dry as opposed to sweet. Overall I'm quite pleased with this beer. I feel that the Boston Beer Company did a good job on this tricky style. I was skeptical that they would take the easy way out and put out a mediocre pumpkin beer but in the end I was pleasantly surprised."
"Pours a deep amber color with a nice thick three to four finger head which is off white and holds good retention. There is a little lacing down the glass. The aroma is of a caramel malt backbone with cinnamon and nutmeg present along with a nice pumpkin spice smell. Well rounded but not as rich as others in the class. The taste is of a sweet caramel malt backbone with a little toastiness to it, there is a flavor of clove and cinnamon over the top with a good, but not great pumpkin flavor. Again for the class it is a nice flavor but not as rich and bold as other class leaders. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated. Overall it is a drinkable beer, there is nothing to dislike, however, for the class there are much worse options. There are also better options with a bigger and bolder taste."
"D - Well I have 3 more and I read some of the reviews to let it warm up a bit to taste more spices or pumpkin but as I figure it in a 30 dollar case it wasn't a bad pumpkin beer for 1.25. Heck Shipyards was 3x worse and I paid a solid 2.50 to try it's badness again just to review it here. Solid brew"
"It felt like the spices came out more as this beer warmed; finished very nicely."
"Overall a nice ale by Sam Adams. I was pleasantly surprised by the natural pumpkin taste in the beer."
"A very impressive brew from Samuel Adams, although I've come to expect impressive brews from the fine Boston Beer Company."
"D: Last year I would have probably given this better marks, however, because I live in an area that gets most of the great pumpkin ales (Pumking, Schlafly, Punkin', Hoppin' Frog, etc.), this one is standard pumpkin fare compared to the heavyweights."
"D-I was pleasantly surprised, this is better than other pumpkin beers out there, I just wish the pumpkin flavor came out a bit more. I wish there were more than two in the mix pack!"
"Overall a fairly well balanced pumpkin ale. Nothing special, pretty average. One thing I like about this one is that it doesn't just taste like pumpkin pie. Too many pumpkin beers overdo the nutmeg and other spices so that it overpowers the pumpkin flavor. There's a bit of harshness on the end that might be some tannins from the vegetable. I've had some pumpkin beers that were better, but I've also had some that were much worse."
"D - Overall a very drinkable pumpkin brew. The only issue is it only comes in the harvest pack so you only get two at a time."
"If this didn't say Pumpkin on the bottle I might like this more but so far, I am feeling let down. It's not bad, but also not what I want out of a pumpkin beer."
"The mouthfeel is fine, and is drinkable, but I can't say much more than that for this beer. I would definitely pass on this one and order the Oktoberfest, because it is great."
"D. A decent representation of the style, nicely spiced, not overpowered by sweetness."
"However this is a well made and easy drinking Pumpkin beer that appeals to the drinker who likes the style but prefers not to have the beer feel like dessert"
"Notes: I generally don't like a lot of spices in my pumpkin ales, but in this case I actually think the spicing was too subdued. The pumpkin taste seems fresh and genuine; no extracts here. Other than that this beer really didn't impress me at all. I bought the fall harvest pack just because of this beer, and it has left me a little disappointed. It's not a bad beer by any means, but it is a very safe offering. It just isn't ballsy enough. There are better pumpkin ales out there."
"Poured this beer into a pint glass. The appearance is a reddish amber with an offwhite head that dissapates quickly to light lacing around the rim of the glass. The nose is sweet spiciness, nutmeg, cinnamon, and cloves. The taste is upfront sweet spiciness, followed by a well balanced crisp and slightly bitter finish. The mouthfeel is somewhat dry. Kind of a niche taste which causes the beer to loose a point on drinkability. It's a good brew, but would not be a staple in my fridge."
"Final Thoughts: Definitely one of the better largy produced pumpkin beers on the market, and props to Sam Adams for continuing to expand their line-up!!"
"Drinkability - nice brew, possibly one of the more complex varieties that I have yet to try of theirs...which is not to say that their beers are not complex.. Also doesn't seem as filling, so easier to come back for more."
"Taste is predominately caramel malt with the aftertaste being mostly of pumpkin, as with the nose, the spice doesn't beat you over the head like some other pumpkin beers, but it's strong enough to know what you're drinking, carbonation is solid and spot on."
"D= I actually like this a lot. If I could buy this in a sixer I would for sure. I don't find many pumpkin beers in MN I like. DFH doesn't distribute here and ST Pumpking is a little too big for me to enjoy regularly. This would be that beer so please make sixers."
"Body is moderate and balanced with the carbonation and light sweetness. Body fills as the beer settles and outgasses, finally becoming a bit too rich and hindering the drinkability. Pretty flat in flavor overall."
"Update 9/29/2011 I got another Samuel Adams autumn mixed 12 pack to try this year and I found this beer not to be as bad as I first thought. It doesn't have the balance of pumpkin to spices that I like but that doesn't make it a D+ beer. I now feel that this beer is average for it's style, still haven't tried a bunch of this style but as it stands now this beer is an average Pumpkin beer."
"Drinkability is high. Wish there were more of it in the variety pack."
"A real delight from BBC."
"I poured into a pint glass to two fingers of tan head. This beer is reddish orange in color. The aroma is pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg, the usual suspects. The taste follows the aroma very nicely. Neither the aroma nor the flavor are overpowering in any way. It just has a solid pumpkin feel to it. The mouthfeel is a little gritty. This is a perfect beer for a cool autumn day and a great way to start my week off."
"I'm not really enjoying this beer. The flavor is pleasant enough, but the mouthfeel and appearance aren't of a quality I expect from this brewer. I would skip this one on draft, and if I buy another fall mix pack, there are better beers in it for me to enjoy."
"D: Better than many other pumpkin ales. Accessible and, thankfully, not overly spiced. A welcome fall release from Sam Adams and a pleasant brew on this mild October evening."
"Great Pumpkin Ale, excellent taste. Really nicely done."
"I really liked this one and personally wish they would make this a seasonal sixer along with the Octoberfest... Very nicely done..."
"Asking me about drinkability is probably a poor choice...I can generally drink a lot of everything. With the ABV being moderate, one could easily split a six pack with a buddy on a cool, fall night."
"D: I like the fact that it strays away from artificial additives, or at least does a great job of masking that fact. The malt profile is there, which makes the subtle, real pumpkin flavor more enjoyable. Not overly spiced and the 5.7% ABV adds to the warming effect of this new fall seasonal from Sam. Good job."
"I poured the beer into a pint glass it has 2""" white creamy head that stands on top of a nice rich amber color body. I smell a hint of cinnamon and clove. The taste is very nice of pumpkin and spices. It reminds me of a spiced brown ale. The beer has a great mouth feel and i think is a very drinkable fall beer. It flavor and body fits the fall season just perfectly."
"This would actually make a fine Thanksgiving day beverage. Turkey and the fixins', of course, followed by a piece of pumpkin pie!"
"Pours a dark garnet red. Little white head. Aroma is cinnimon, a little nutmeg and malts. First sip is toasty malt, a little nutmeg, not much real pumpkin. But the flavor is good. More of a spiced Brown Ale. As it warms a little the cinnimon and spices come out more and a little hint of pumpkin too. This is a really nice fall beer. BBC should make this a regular 6-pack offering."
"Notes: I am really loving this beer right now. This one is a stand out in an already solid fall mixed pack."
"If it came down to a standard 6 pack, it's not going to usurp Shipyard for me. But with the fantastic mix you get in the Harvest Collection, it's a welcome addition that makes the 12 pack a must buy for me whenever I see it available."
"Good example of a pumpkin beer, mouthfeel was slightly thin making this beer slightly astrigent. Similar to SA Lager with added pumpkin."
"12oz. bottle served in a standard pint. Pours a beautiful translucent copper with a sizzling, half-inch, cream-colored head that quickly dissipates into a thin, soapy skim - no lacing on this one. Nose smells like pumpkin pie - nutmeg and allspice. Taste consistent with nose. Flavor profile is nicely balanced without being too cloying and there's a nice, subtle cleansing hops presence that comes out towards the back to help dissipate the flavors between quaffs. Moutfeel is medium-light with a lively effervescence. An extremely easy drinking example of the style. I have to say that I am not a huge fan of the style per se, but when I crave a Pumpkin Ale I usually go for a big beer (Pumking, Imperial Pumpkin, etc.). Having tried this brew, it has made me rethink my position. A very satisfying and balanced brew without the cloying quality and alcohol punch in the face."
"Drinkability: seems pretty good, I really enjoy the flavors so I wouldn't mind going for another one. two seems like it would probably be the limit though, as this is a bold and full-bodied beer."
"Overall a very good example of the style. It's not as good as the Dogfish Head version but a lot less expensive."
"Pours brownish-red with tan head. Nose is full of spices... Nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves, ginger. Spicy hops, too. Muted caramel with pumpkin up front. Light carbonation, crisp, clean mouthfeel. Light hops at the back; aftertaste is a fine breadiness. Very easy on the palate, fantastically drinkable."
"D: Sweet and spicy, which is enjoyable, but a bit too much for repeated consumption."
"This one poured a hazelnut brown in color with a off white poofy head. It smelled of cinnamon and nutmeg with some light pumpkin bread aromas. The taste was mildly sweet, almost syrupy sweet, with good notes of cinnamon and nutmeg. The pumpkin is sutble at best but it is pretty tasty. The mouthfeel is relatively light and pretty smooth with medium carbonation. It's decently drinkable but does seem to get sweeter after awhile."
"Pours out a deep copper, almost mahogany color. This is a darker pumpkin ale than I am used to! Smells like rich malts, and some very subtle pumpkin spice in the background. Tastes like some rich pumpkin, and some faint spices in the background. I taste some solid maltiness in there to bolster the brew, and some finishing hops to round it out. This is a really interesting brew from Sam Adams, and very nicely done. Definitely a more balanced Pumpkin Ale than most offerings, and actually this could be setting a standard for me for the style. It tastes like pumpkin, but the spices and the pumpkin flavor do not mask the ale. So far, I have tried two other pumpkin ales, one that was quite spicey,(ichabod) and one that was a delicious but really rich, amped up pumpkin ale, (Punkin'), and this one fits nicely right in the middle. Very tastey, very drinkable, and hits all the marks. Maybe they should introduce this one in it's own 6-pack."
"D- Of if this were on tap in Florida this time of year, I might actually think there was a fall season here..."
"Pumpkin ale poured a dark amer color with a nice head. It smells like pumkin and has a strong malty smell. The taste is heavy, very malty and very strong pumpkin flavors. Easy to drink. Overall very enjoayble wis it came in a six pck. I would deffently get it again."
"Nice drinkability here, not a great pumpkins beer but better than most..."
"D- Not a bad pumpkin ale, but there are better ones out there."
"Drinkability: Pumpkin beers are tough, they are either right on the money or a mess of spices, but SA did it right with this beer, the spiciness is here yet very well balanced to the malt, and it's melded to the point where it taste authentic. I'm pissed you only get 2 in a variety pack and would love to see this released in 6 packs every fall with Octoberfest. An excellent interpretation of the pumpkin style and needs it's own space on the 6 pack shelves immediatley!"
"Pours a clear amber/copper color with a nice head. Little retention. Smells of bready malts, pumpkin and spice...faint spicy hop aroma. Taste follows the aroma..Pumpkin, grains, nutmeg/allspice finish, spicy noble hops. Nice body, not overly carbonated, crisp finish. This is one of the better pumpkin beers that I have tried. Not usually a huge fan but this is good stuff. I wouldnt call any pumpkin ales very drinkable but this ranks up there."
"A good brew. definitely drinkable, but in limited quantities due to the sweetness."
"Drinkability- It was pretty good. I liked it. I would definitely like to have it again."
"Drinkability: A fine example of this uniquely American style. I quite enjoyed this."
"Even though it's only a bit less strong, this reminds me a bit of a more drinkable DFH Punkin Ale. I think it might be the darker malts."
"Overall this is one of the better pumpkin ales that's not high in alcohol."
"Drinkability is great ok Jim release this in sixer's and i will be adding it to my seasonal purchases. Must say this is one of the better pumpkin ales i have had."
"I've had much better and this one was a little thin on the flavor. It was all spice and little mash."
"Nice mouthfeel and rich orange appearance. The smell and taste are slightly hinted with typical spiced notes of nutmeg and cinnamon. It comes off as a nice mild flavored pumpkin ale for those who want a hint of autumn without getting blasted by it. It is awfully close to their Oktoberfest."
"Cheers..."
"I've found that the warmer temperatures are better at bringing out the spice and would advise you let temperatures rise as well."
"Not as pumpkin-y as I would like, but still a solid addition to the fall lineup, I'd like to see this in 6-packs."
"Drinkability is OK. An OK beer but not one I would want put in bombers so I could get more of it. Two in the Harvest pack is enough."
"Notes: not available on it's own. Only available currently in the harvest mix pack which is a nice mix for the fall season."
"Could be good for everyonce in a while, but there are much better brands of pumpkin ales"
"The beer pours a beautiful amber color with a thick frothy off-white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a dry, crystal malt and pumpkin scent with subtle hints of cinnamon and nutmeg. The taste is good as well. It has a pretty straight up pumpkin flavor along with an adequate amount of pale and crystal malts. It goes down easy with a bone dry finish and faint hints of spice. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good drinking pumpkin beer. It focuses on the pumpkin character instead of the spices; another solid seasonal from Samuel Adams."
"Bought the Harvest Collection pack just for these 2 bottles. I wasnt disappointed. Very full bodied beer with a great autumn feel to it. Strong with cinnamon, nutmeg and all spice flavors in the back of your mouth with a crisp refreshing taste. Mouthfeel wasnt to dominating with these flavors and had a smooth feel to it. Drinkability is very good only if would comei in a 6 pack and i dont get 2 bottles per 12."
"Not quite as good as Southern Tier Pumking, but a step above most of the pumpkin ales that are on the market."
"Bottle. Pours a light brown color with a small beige head that leaves a small ring and a bit of film. Nose is sweet, nutty malts with hints of pumpkin, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Spicy. Palate is smooth and sticky with a nice light carbonation. Flavor is sweet nutty pumpkin up front with a stingy light hop note in the finish. Mild tinniness on the finish. Otherwise a solid beer."
"Pours a clear, brown color. 1/2 inch head of an off-white color. Decent retention and slight lacing. Smells of sweet malt, spice (nutmeg), slight yeast, hint of pumpkin, and a hint of pale malt. Fits the style of a Pumpkin Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, spice (cinnamon, nutmeg, and all spice), hint of earthy malt, pumpkin, hint of hop, and slight yeast. Overall, very drinkable, great blend, and good aroma."
"This beer has a nice lighter feel to it. There is a nice finish to it and it goes down well. Ii is not the best beer from Boston beer Co. but not a bad one either."
"The few pumpkin ales I tried last year I liked, but I found this one pretty boring."
"D: There are so many bad pumpkin beers out there, this one is a nice change from the others. Not too over the top, but maybe a little bit too sweet."
"Great pumkin ale without too much spicy notes and overall light, easy drinking ale. With an abundance of crappy Pumpkin Ale attempts available around, SA does a fine job with this one and well balanced. Nothing extraordinary but I would definitely buy a 6 pack if it was available."
"Notes: Just an average overall pumpkin beer. I wasn't expecting too much more from SA. It is a good introductory pumpkin beer, but they need to ramp up certain spices to fix the balance."
"Drinkability - For a pumpkin beer, relatively so. Granted after one or two of these I'd move on to something else, the fact I'd reach for a second with such a spicy beer tells you something."
"Pours a clear, dark copper with one and a half fingers of a fizzy head that quickly peters out. Aromas get points for showing restraint with the spices and letting some of the toastier and brown sugary malts make their presence known. Taste is a bit spicier than the nose suggested, with some molasses notes that I didn't catch from the aroms. Medium full body is nicely carbonated. Gingerbready taste lingers on the finish."
"Drinkability is good. I definitely wouldn't mind a couple of these over a nice large meal."
"D - good all around, suitable for the style - nothing stands out, but everything well done, kept in check, and the """pumpkin""" is definitely present. BBC has a winner (and hopefully a keeper) here."
"Not a big pumpkin beer fancier, but this one was pretty good."
"High level of sweetness actually seems to be a good thing here, as it offsets some of the dry, bitter spice. Gives it a full body too. Little bit of toast comes in as it warms. Not bad, I think it would be hard to drink more than one or two at a time...but if this were to be offered in a six-pack, I would probably buy one each year. Well done, BBC"
"I'm not big on pumpkin (just ok). This one is good still (for me) not a session beer. A little pumpkin as a change of pace is fine but not for a full session."
"D - I am pleased to say that Samuel Adams has finally developed a 12-pack seasonal sampler that contains not one questionable beer, now that their Harvest Pumpkin Ale passed my personal scrutiny. This beer's only shortcomings are largely a matter of personal taste: I find it just a bit too sweet. It could stand for a little bit more in the bittering hop department to keep the finish crisp like the Autumn air. It's got quite a filling mouthfeel and body, which isn't a detriment per se, but it certainly turns it from being an awesome all-day drinker to a two-bottle at a time max. That said, almost every other aspect of this beer is simply fantastic. Kudos and cheers to Samuel Adams for continuing to produce top-quality beers without compromise."
"Nice to see a big craft brewer release a pumpkin ale, even nicer that it tastes good."
"Smell and Taste: With pumpkin and vanilla/cream, followed up by slight hops, the nose is quite nice. The taste is of slightly spiced pumpkin, with just a bit of hops. Vanilla lingers in the aftertaste. This beer doesn't overdo it with any one flavor, and so ends up being a very drinkable beer and distinctly autumnal treat."
"Drinkability: I like my pumpkin beers to be fairly mild in terms of spices and fairly forward in terms of malt flavor. This one hit the spot and for under $15 for a 12 pack you really can't trump the value."
"Overall, a really solid and enjoyable example of the style. Nothing is too innovative or complex, but everything is done well. Definitely worth a try and a solid example for someone new to the style."
"All I can say is I hope the rest of this variety-12-pack is as tasty as this one was! Great start here."
"Notes: This is a hearty beer and I hope it will be brewed every fall. Cheers"
"D-In a world full of pumpkin ales, this is one that is just a little different. Much more pumpkin flavor and very light on the spice. I suppose that its kind of open for interpretation but I like this ale opposed to a heavily spiced one because its so drinkable."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has an amberish color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of pumpkin pie. Taste is good, pumpkin, nutmeg, other spices, very flavorful. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this is a good quality brew."
"Taste: I prefer pumpkin ales to have more of an emphasis on the pumpkin spices. But this is still pretty good, so I can't rip on it too bad. More bitterness than I was expecting."
"Pretty impressed by this one. Mixes aspects I like about harvest ales with your standard pumpkin ale flavors. Well done!"
"Pours a nice amber orange with a thin white head. Excellent retention and lots of laceing. Aroma is of spices,and pumpkin. Nice but on the weak side. Body is light and creamy. Taste is of nutmeg,cinnamon and pumpkin. Spicey with a nice smooth finish. Very nice."
"I bought the new sampler pack just to try this beer out. Poured into a brandy snifter, it was amber with a decent amount of head. The aroma was pumpkin with not much else, couldn't detect much of the """spice""" going along with the pumpkin. The taste was mostly pumpkin, but it tasted like it was made with canned pumpkin.I love most Sam Adams brews, but found myself underwhelmed by this one."
"One of my favorite breweries finally comes out with a pumpkin ale after all of these years, excited to try this one. Pours a beautiful orange/red color.. definitely gets a high appearance score for its 'fall look'. Smell is of some cinnamon/nutmeg/other fall spices, great aroma. Medium bodied, great mouthfeel. Get some more of those pumpkin spice tastes, not overpowering at all though which is good. A nicely balanced beer, very tasty and doesn't exude pumpkins like a lot of the other seasonals. I liked this one a lot, highly recommended."
"D: A very approachable and drinkable pumpkin ale. I am one of those that really enjoy the sweet pumpkin beers, but I can definitely appreciate this one too. Not sure if I would buy six packs of it because of other pumpkin beers I like more, but I definitely don't mind getting it in the mix pack."
"Mouthfeel is fairly solid, and smoother than I expected. This is one pumpkin beer I could drink lots of and not get sick of. Glad sams brought this one back."
"D: A nice take on a style that's not one of my favorites. I'm glad I picked it up."
"Style #96. Only 7 more to go to! I must preface this by saying that I don't particularly care for pumpkin beers, but going to give this an honest review. Pours a rather dark amber color bordering on reddish brown with a two finger khaki colored head and some decent lacing. Aroma is definitely more spicy than I imagined it would be. Definitely picking up on some nutmeg, brown sugar, and light pumpkin. It's very reminiscent of Anchor Christmas Ale. Taste is actually pretty decent, and not over the top pumpkin. From the aroma I thought this was going to be overly spiced, but it's actually very balanced between the nutmeg, pumpkin, and possibly even cinnamon? I also detect a certain citrusy quality on the back end that could possibly be described as bitter orange peel. Not much in the way of hops on this since the spices are the true star. Mouthfeel is medium-full, which I like because most pumpkin beers seem thin and overly pumpkiny. Honestly, I have to say that I like this beer. You can tell this has a very tasty base beer, and again I like that it's not over the top with the pumpkin, although I think the spicing can be taken down a notch. Maybe I actually do like this style."
"Another one from Sam Adams fall mixer. Never new this one existed so let's give it a try. Deep orangy amber with a generous head that leaves decent lacing all the way down. Not picking up much on the smell at all which surprised me a bit. Sweet with some pumkin pie spices but deffinately not overpowering. It's not bad overall, might go great with a meal but not something I would seek out on it's own again."
"Picked up this years SA Harvest Sampler Pack, which has a fine selection of SA brews. You only get two of each beer and in this case it is both a good and bad thing, while the harvest pumpkin is not the worst pumpkin beer I have had it is certainly still trying to figure out if it is a chump or a champ. They say the use real pumpkin but it does not shine through in the flavor and it taste more like an Oktoberfest with pumpkin pie spices added. If the real pumpkin was the star then this brew would be a much higher score."
"D-initial spices taste stays but beer becomes more bitter through experience, possible to have a few, but not too much more while still enjoying the beer. still, probably one of the better pumpkin ales out there that have a low ABV."
"Drinkability: I really wish they sold this in a six pack and not the variety pack. This is a very good pumpkin beer by Sam Adams that is going to be drank again by me."
"Pours dark amber to chestnut color with generous head that lingers, and then recedes to an enduring slim layer for the rest of the pint. Nose has ripe pumpkin pie aromas. Palate offers a gorgeous melody of pumpkin and dessert spices - what a pleasant surprise. Rather easy drinking and not overwhelming with pumpkin on the finish and aftertaste."
"a wonderfully colored brew. reminds me of a pumpkin. not really. Still appealing, though. A very nice smell, a little weak. Taste is exceptional and delicious. Does not hold it's head very long and is not very carbonated. Not really what I was expecting. Would still be able to drink a lot of them. Recommended."
"I'm a big fan of seasonal beers. This beer is a great treat for a fall day."
"Overall an above average pumpkin ale. I'd like to see these in 6 packs next year."
"Glad to grab this one in the fall taster pack - had this and the Dunkel, both of which I'd never tried before. Both were worthwhile brews, although I'll say I found this one to be quite a legit Pumpkin beer. Has the deep orange color that you expect with a smallish head on top, a nice odor of cinnamon and ginger in there with some general fruity maltiness. Flavor is likewise, a nicely full tasting spiced brew that balances that cinnamon and ginger with a malt backbone. A nice pumpkin, basically - they should put this one out over the Oktoberfest, if you ask me."
"Drinkability: Very well balanced and drinkable Pumpkin Ale. Extremely good for a non-Imperial."
"D: SA should make candles with this recipe and not beer. It isn't bad or the worst I have had, thanks to Buffalo Bill's pumpkin beer. I think they could do better but this isn't awful. Just not great."
"D: My first pumpkin beer. Not too bad. It didn't knock my socks off, but I enjoyed it more than I thought I would considering that I don't really care for pumpkin."
" Quite a well balanced beer in all senses... Spices complement both the pumpkin and malt, and a nice caramel sweetness that plays into it very nicely. Body is fairly creamy, and just about a perfect consistency for the style and the season... a happy medium between the refreshing summer styles and the thick and chewy doppelbocks and stouts of the colder months. I 've mentioned in other reviews of the style that I am of the opinion that many of these beers either come across as simply being pumpkin pie spices or being very squashy without finding a nice balance or allowing it to still have solid roots as a beer. This is not one of those, and a brew that I think will likely be enough to get the variety pack again, though I'd like to see it in 6 packs!"
"D - easy to drink and quite enjoyable."
"Overall this is a fairly drinkable beer but boring in the end. Best described as middle of the road, like all Sam Adams beers are in my opinion."
"Great fall beer, glad to see it in the Harvest Collection."
"a solid pumpkin ale."
"D: this is a well done pumpkin ale and it exceeds the quality of many of the other beers that SA puts in a six pack. I think this could replace coastal wheat and I would be a happy camper."
"A deep red and ruby body sits below thin tan lacing. It fades into a nice hazel-brown and fades again into gold. The split of colors is a nice sight. The smell is delicious. Cinnamon-sugar and nutmeg, sweet, fresh pumpkin and pie-crust malts highlight the smell. It's light but sticks in your nose. The taste isn't terrible. Pumpkin-filling malts and a hint of nutmeg. A little sour. The mouthfeel is good - smooth on the tongue - and the drinkability is better. Drinks well at a range of temperatures."
"D - An ok pumpkin ale. I would try it again but not (in my opinion) one of the best pumpkin ales out there."
"This is good, but not a truly great pumpkin. I'd personally like more balance and spice in the taste and the pumpkin flavor itself could be upgraded as well. Fundamentally, this just isn't that different from the Oktoberfest. A little understated. I like my pumpkins on steroids."
"D: A darn good pumpkin beer, this is currently best in the Southland at least in early September. It's like Old Fezziwig, a shame they don't sell this in 6-packs."
"This is one of the most flavorful, yet balanced pumpkin beers that I have had in a while. Kudos to Sam Adams for making a highly drinkable, very tasty pumpkin brew. They really got the spices spot-on. I also prefer the taste and body imparted from real pumpkin."
"Drinkability: Goes down pretty easily and is, overall, a fairly respectable pumpkin beer. Sure, there are better ones out there but, like most of Sam Adams' beers, this is a faithful interpretation of the style that is certainly worth the price you pay for it."
"Worth picking up. The fall variety pack is pretty solid this year. Dunkelweizen, black ale, octoberfest. All of those are good in my book (the others aint bad either). I wouldn't mind seeing this every autumn, and its something I look forward to returning later on."
"Drinkability is really, really good. I find myself wishing I had another one to down. It's pretty sad that Sam Adams doesn't sell this by the sixer, because I'd definitely pick at least a few up. This is a very, very well done pumpkin ale. Bravo to the Boston Beer Company for crafting such a delectable seasonal brew."
"Very good overall seasonal beer, just wish I didn't have to buy it in a 12 pack seasonal box."
"Great beer, a very impressive offering from Sam Adams. Catch it!"
"Just a nice easy to get Autumn sipper!"
"One of the most balanced Pumpkin beers I have ever had which in turn makes it one of my favorite pumpkin beers. Wasn't expecting to like this, a little nervous about it in fact, but it is actually very good."
"(D) Here's where this beer does well. Most pumpkin beers are interesting and you never want a 2nd. This one does not fall under this norm. A second bottle would be more than welcomed."
"D-Excellent pumpkin from Sammy...blows most out of the water..."
"Poured into a pint glass amber red with a one finger white head. Decent lacing down the glass. There really isn't much of a scent that I detect other than a pumpkin spice. The taste actually punches your senses with a pumpkin flavor as soon as it hits your tongue. That is followed by tradition fall spices like nutmeg and cloves. I'm not much of a pumpkin fan, as in anything made with pumpkin. This isn't too terrible if you're like me."
"Pours a deep murky amber color with a bit of head that fades to thin wisps on the surface of this guy. Smells delicious with some big nutmeg, cinnamon, and pumpkin notes. A bit of yam in there too? Taste is a bit of a let-down, with an overall toasted pumpkin bread profile. The toasting might be a bit much and the pumpkin, which was readily apparent in the nose, might be a bit subdued. MF is good with moderate heft and moderate carbonation, nothing remarkable either way, though I felt the carbonation to be coarse. I liked drinking this one, and as with most Sam Adams beers, it's sessionable."
"Full bodied, a very nice pumpkin beer."
"d 3.5-4 drinkable in an inoffensive, rather than addictive, way. middle of the road, yes, but amongst pumpkin ales (which often go overboard on spice or are flawed in some other major way) it's far better than middle of the pack. still, i'm not exactly heartbroken that you can't buy this on its own (at least not yet)."
"Kind of a copper/mahogany color with a pretty fluffy off-white head after an aggressive pour. The pumpkin is a bit subdued in the nose, but there is a lot of spiciness. The pumpkin is much more apparent on the tongue. This tastes just like pumpkin pie. Lots of nutmeg and allspice along with just enough sweetness to mimic that pie flavor. I'm not usually a fan of pumpkin beers, but this is really good. Drinkability is at a high level as well."
"Transparent reddish amber in body topped by off-white head that stays and leaves lacing. Spice overload, nutmeg, mild clove, gingerbread, caramel in the nose. Gingerbread, pumpkin spice focusing on cinnamon, nutmeg, a rush of sweetness towards the finish. Light in body with medium carbonation. A sweet-toothed fall seasonal that represents the style well but way too sweet."
"It's good."
"A nice medium brown to mahogany color. Creamy, off-white head that lasts. Thick, frothy lacing all around. The aroma has adequate pie spice, not much pumpkin. Taste is much better. Good sweetness really brings out the pumpkin flavor, which mixes nicely with the spices. Medium body from the sweetness. Definitely one of the better pumpkin ales I've tried."
"Pours a crystal clear, beautiful caramel/copper color with a somewhat dense khaki colored head that settles into a light cap. Very nice pumpkin spice aroma; allspice, nutmeg and cinnamon all present. There is some brown sugar and actual pumpkin scents as well. Not overly spicy, has a solid earthy aroma. Taste is like a pumpkin pie and by that I mean it actually has pumpkin flavor do it to go with the spice. It is not a spicy amber ale. With that said, the flavor is of an earthy pumpkin/gourd flavor with brown sugar & caramel sweetness. The spice profile is not very strong; allspice seems to standout and some nutmeg. The malt has a very light lemony flavor. The beer has a moderate body with soft carbonation which gives it a smooth feel; mostly sweet but finishes with a slight lemon tartness. Good balance. This is a very nice pumpkin ale. Extremely balanced, not too spicy, noticable pumpkin flavor, smooth feel, quite good. Lets hope this one sticks around."
"Look this isn't as bad as some versions but it's still a pumpkin ale, it actually has that pumpkin pie finish to it. Between the malts and the spices added in, this also says brewed with pumpkin. Darker than most versions a dark mahogany almost brown ale appearance with tight bubbled moccha tan head. Fine lacing spreads nicely between sips on the sides of my chalice. Nose has some serious pumpkin pie action kicking, between nutmeg and cinnamon with all spice and canned pumpkin candy sweetness. Pretty good especially considering the mouthfeel which was a bit harsh with spice bitterness in the back of the throat carbonation works and medium to light bodied flows decently enough. Drinkability overall is rather good for this style of beer, especially considering I'd never thought of Sam Adams as a pumpkin ale type of brewer."
"I'm impressed. Not too sweet, sufficiently spicy and malty. Well-balanced beer and very tasty."
"T- This is slightly above average for me as far as pumpkin ales go. Its quite nice. A real surprise. Spices are toned back from what the nose would suggest. Nutmeg being the strongest. Pumpkin is there and lends a sweetness that is very welcome. Hops seem to play a bigger part here. They work with the spices to make this a very spicy and earthy beer. As sweet as this beer is from time to time, it finishes fairly bitter."
"Good drinkability for a Pumpkin Ale..."
"The SA Harvest pack was nice last year, but replacing the dreadful Cherry Wheat with the Harvest Pumpkin Ale was the best move they could have done."
"Overall not a bad brew. Reminds me of fall, with its color and slight pumpkin taste. Because of its balance and subtlety this is actually one of the better pumpkin brews that I have tried. It doesn't try to do too much and for some that may be a turn off. It's a fairly light beer that doesn't go too far, I would definitely drink this again."
"D: This is really good and I hope they release it in 6pack form soon."
"Pours a really nice orange brown color with a pillowy off white head. The retention is minimal but the head recedes to a white cap throughout the session. The aroma is deep roasted pumpkin, nutmeg and cloves. Has a nice brown sugar and cinnamon component that is very nice. The taste is very attractive and promotes all the aromatics into the flavor profile with the addition od candied Ginger. This gives it a rich spiciness that also lightens up the beer. Mouthfeel is off for me because it's over carbonated and not super smooth like most pumpkin beers are. Drinkability is high again on this brew because it's very tasty. Abv according to the website is 5.7% and it's not totally hidden, but integrated well into the beer. Overall it's a very pumpkin beer."
"D - A good amount of flavor for a beer under 6%; those who enjoy a spicy character to their pumpkin beers would dig this."
"I couldn't drink more than a couple of these in a row, but I'm not going to blame that on the beer as much as my own taste preferences. I don't like pumpkin, or many of the spices it's typically flavored with. Knowing that, it wasn't as bad as I expected it to be. Still nothing I'll be searching out in the future!"
"Mahogany color, beige head with some nice lacing. Alluring aroma of a freshly baked pumpkin pie, cinnamon, vanilla, and nutmeg. Outstanding taste of sweet malts and spices, pecans and PUMPKIN. A solid medium-bodied brew with good carbonation. I love this time of year when all the fall seasonal brews come out. They tend to be much thicker and have more complex characteristics than most of the watered down summer beers."
"12oz bottle purchased as part of this year's Fall mix-pack. Pours a deep crystal-clear dark copper with nearly an inch of off-white head that dissipates rather quickly. Pumpkin pie spice shares the aroma equally with caramel and bready malt and a hint of pumpkin. Tastes like pumpkin pie spice with caramel and toasty malt notes to balance and just a hint of pumpkin. On the fuller side of medium-bodied with ample but not overwhelming carbonation. Extremely drinkable. As far as Pumpkin ales go, this one is a bit ahead of the middle of the pack. It's not a spice-bomb, it's not overly slick or vegetal. This one is smooth and balanced - not in your face with the flavor, nor is it simplistic or subdued. Very good. Glad to see this in the new fall pack!"
"D - Another quaff-able offering from Sam Adams. This one is subtly spiced and not overly sweet which is very nice to me. I could sit down with 2-3 pints of this one, just a very well balanced Pumpkin Ale. I might buy this one in the future sometime, worth a try. Cheers!"
"d: This reminds me of the start of winter. Halloween, Thanksgiving and on to Christmas. Very well-balanced as SA beers often are. Pretty drinkable."
"Sure, it is still quite drinkable but otherwise, I don't see why they bothered to make a pumpkin ale. You probably know by now that there are much better examples available. Only try if you're really curious."
"Serving type- bottle"
"D- really good fall beer....unfortunately, I'm drinking it in August. Shame these are only in the brewmaster's packs and aren't sold in sixers of their own...nice complement to the Octoberfest"
"Drinkability/Mouthfeel: It has a tingly carbonation and is very crisp and very drinkable for this style."
"Pours a nice orange-copper color with a bit of nice head, but no lacing to speak of. Nice scent, a slight sweet maltiness with the barest hint of spice, and with a wonderful gourd-like sweetness. Very nice taste, a nice malty beer with a bit of spice to make up for low hops, but a very nice pumpkin flavor that's not overstated and not cloying like some can be; this is not a pumpkin pie pumpkin ale, thank goodness, but a wonderful ale with pumpkin attributes. Goes down very nicely and will make a great fall beer if they'd release it in six packs or cases, instead of two per fall specialty pack."
"Brown colored body, slight chill haze. Small tan head, pretty good amount of lace. Scent is pumkiny with brown sugar and maybe cinnamon. Taste is very good, one of the better pumkins ive had over the years. Lots of different spice, cinnamon, brown sugar, well-blended pumpkin. Thin to medium mouth, fairly wet. A pleasure to find in their fall sampler, but i would buy a six of this at least once a year if they sold it"
"Good, creamy, effervescent mouthfeel for a fine malty brew, and easy to gulp. I certainly wouldn't put it in the category of ST's Pumpking, easily the best pumpkin brew I've ever had (in no small part because of the greater prominence of the main ingredient), but it's well worth a try, and is a really good addition to the Harvest Collection."
"ABV-Not Indicated, but I'm guessing it's 6% abv"
"D: Nothing special, but, not being a big fan of the style, I find this beer's saving grace to be its subtlety - it doesn't slap you in the face with spices like some others. It probably won't satisfy those who are eagerly awaiting autumn for the arrival of pumpkin beers, but it's a decent offering nonetheless."
"D-Pretty easy drinking but it's not quite different enough from the Holiday Porter in the spice department for me to repurchase this one. This is my first pumpkin beer, so I'm eager to try others to compare with."
"I'm not a huge pumpkin ale fan but this one is a definite choice for those fans, and especially those who prefer a slightly dry pumpkin over a sweeter one."
"I really really hope SA makes this in a 6 pack next year, but I do not want them to drop their Oktoberfest either. Oh how I love the fall beers."
