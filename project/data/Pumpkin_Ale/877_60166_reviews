"Pours a deep orange with an eggshell white head that trails the glass. The smell was a bit more reserved than I thought it would be. There was some pumpkin and cinnamon but not as much as I thought there would be. The taste was great with a lot of pumpkin flavor up front and then spices such as nutmeg, cinnamon and I think cardamom come through. Really liked this one."

"O: A better than average imperial pumpkin beer. I'm not a fan of this much sweet or fruit or spice! It's like flavored coffee."

"Overall:  A good pumpkin beer, though it is a little too sweet and spicy for my palate"

"Pours a cloudy, medium amber brown wiith a large, persistent white head from a growler supplied by CJ's in Towamencin PA. Aroma is pleasant aromatic, mostly vanilla, with some definite pumpkin pie notes. Taste is very smooth, malty and easy drinking. There is not much pumpkin or spice, but a subtle complex mixture of all of the above. Not as intense as the Neshaminy Creek imperial pumpkin """Punkless Dunkel", but nevertheless quite good and VERY sessionable. This delicious brew will please the palates of all but the most experienced beer drinkers who have destroyed their palates with over-the-top insanely intense brews."

"I actually liked this, the alcohol well hidden, a lot of fresh pumpkin flavor with less pumpkin spice, a little sweetness. creamy smooth feel and dry spicy finish"

"Poured cold into the pint glass this seasonal shows a nice autumnal rusty caramel brown with a respectable white sheet of foam on top and solid streaks of lacing. The aroma offers a yeasty allspice and nutmeg medley with hints of orange and clove. Nice. The flavor comes on pretty strong with grassy grain pumpkin and more allspice. Unfortunately my one gripe with this beer is that alcohol is more evident in the flavor than I'd like. I appreciate that it's an imperial (a misnomer outside the Russian stout family) and many of my favorite brews are high alcohol, but alcohol in itself should not be a """flavor""". It doesn't ruin this beer for me but it does make this a bit disappointing. Like the aroma I pick up some clove and citrus notes, as well as brown bread malt and caramel. The body is medium at best and with a peppery carbonation there's a slightly creamy but tingly feel. Good for a bit of fall pleasure but short of expectations."

"Poured into a sam adams glass, developed a nice cream colored head with nice retention and lacing. Appaerance was a very hazy amber to orange color. Aroma had strong notes of spice and in particular, nutmeg. Tasted of spice and hop, nice floral, nutmeg and clove notes. Nice full and creamy mouthfeel with a spicy and lingering aftertaste."

"O/D-One of the better pumpkin brews I tried this season. I wouldn't be shocked if I revisited a 4-pack of this next Fall."
""
"D - A very nice Pumpkin Ale and by far the best offering I've had from River Horse to date... I've been a tad disappointed in their other offerings.. The end result is a solid, much better than average, but a tad bit short of top of class Pumpkin Ale... I'm happy to have encountered and will gladly invest in a 4 pack each holiday season when I'm able to find it on the shelves..."

"I picked this up as an alternative to Sam Adams Harvest Pumpkin, which has been completely sold out for over 3 weeks now at the BK in Chatham, NJ. Not as much body as the Sam but It is very good. Just a tad too thin imo and it was this or Captain Lawrence Pumpkin, which I've had before and it sahx a cawk. Nonetheless , serving the River Horse Pumpkin in a chilled glass is a nice fall treat. Get some while you can."
""
""
"Nice pumpkin ale. Little more on the brown ale side of things. Can't really taste the booze, but certaiinly can feel it."
""
""
""
"O - One of the more successful """imperial pumpkins""" I've had this season in regards to balance. Not overly cloying in any way. Well done River Horse."
""
"Overall one of the most pumpkinesque experiences out there. Fresh and vegetal."
""
""
""
"A brownish, murky brew, with lots of haze and a modest of-white head, the beer is interesting, but not beautiful. The smell is spicy...but not over-done pie spice. Instead, it is a bit peppery...the vegetable pumpkin scent comes out a little, but never fully developers. It hides its alcohol well. Mild warming, but it stayed hidden at the start. Semi sweet, the beer relies on spice and a lightly roasted flavor. The body is full, and spice really comes out in the finish. I really enjoyed it more and more as I worked through the bottle."

"Very good again. My friend and I compared this to 6 other imperial pumpkins and found this beers texture (not flavor) unique to the point of enhansing the pumpkin beer experience. They all have pumpkin flavor but the creamyness seems to set it apart in a nice way."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a real good beer. For having an abv over 8%, this beer is dangerously smooth. Perfect for the fall. I'd totally buy this again."
""
"Fall gets off with a bang - first pumpkin of the year and this one nails it. Pours dark copper amber with fast bubbles and no foam. Cinnamon pumpkin nose. Brown sugar. Taste is a rich pumpkin, spices. Bready. Pumpkin pie mouthfeel. Really good."

"Pours a amber tinted orange, fluffy and soapy white head. Light scent, moderately spicy with some underlying sweetness, not much pumpkin. Taste begins with spice and bitterness, some pumpkin comes through and a mesh of vanilla and sugar hinted at on the back end. Medium bodied. Falls in the category of pumpkin ales that are more about the spice than the pumpkin or pie."
"Overall: An above average to average pumpkin beer and certainly slightly below other imperial pumpkin ales. A good deal of dry malt and cinnamon here. Not bad, but I will look for other pumpkin ales first."
""
"It pours a murkey brown color body with a thin tannish head that hangs around for a little bit, then fades to a thin lace. The smell is of pumpkin flesh and cinnamon. The taste is very nice of pumpkin and cinnamon and other spices. The spices are not over powering, just balanced really well. The mouth feel is nice, leaves a nice after taste of spices on the back of the tongue. Overall this is a really good pumpkin beers, one of the better ones i have had this year."
"O. This is one of the nicer pumpkins this season. The overall flavor is pleasing and the rich complexity makes it very enjoyable, sip after sip. river Horse has recently been very consistent with the quality and complexity of their beers. Worth a sip. "
""

"O: Overall i think the alcohol seems to interfere to much with the pumpkin aspect of the drink. A pumpkin beer should be fun, spicy, enjoyable to drink, while most of that is distracted by the heat of going big. Im all for big alcohol beers, i just dont think a pumpkin beer is a good option where the sweet and spicy nature is muted. Not ideal for multiples, i rather a pumpkin beer i can casually enjoy around a campfire out in the woods, where the campfire will keep me warm not so much alcohol and where the flavor a bit more enjoyable and defined."

"O: Not really impressed, but it's definitely decent. Very drinkable for the style. Four of these would definitely fuck you up. Worth it if you can find it in singles, though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Decent beer overall. Have had plenty of other better pumpkin ales than this. Still pretty solid and I'd definitely drink it again."
"a nice change for a pumpkin beer. still has spices, but drinks more like a beer."
""
"Overall one of the best River horse beers I ever drank and even one of the better pumpkin ales I drank this season. Worth seeking out if a fan of the style!"
""
"O: This beer has very good flavors and hides the fairly high ABV well. Easy to drink and enjoyable, definitely one to pick up again next fall."
""
"Overall: Actually a very enjoyable beer. When this came highly recommended, I was sure it wouldn't be a letdown. This was a beer that can be thoroughly enjoyed slowly, by a nice bonfire. I would be careful after consuming one haha. Well I will have this again during a long session (football game or BS'n with the guys) and I would totally recommend this beer to anyone who would ask."
""
""
"***Side note: Taste and Mouthfeel so much better from tap."
""
""
""
"This is one of the best pumkins I've had after the big two. Great beer."
""
"D: definitely doesnt drink like an imperial pumpkin, even if the abv says different. the spice is overwhelmed while the pumpkin flavor doesnt really show its head. ummmm, i say pass."
""
""
""
"Overall: You are drinking a good beer and might just sneak into my top five pumpkins that I have had this season. Right after a cheesecake even better. Salud!"

"O- overall I really like this imperial. You don't find one flavor prodomanitly taking over another like in other pumking ales. The flavors are definitely present but in no way dominate which make this imperial very drinkable."
""
""
"Herbal, spicy (hop?) flavors up front. Spices make their presence known and stay for a bit. Cookie and graham cracker malt sweetness fills up the palate. Clove, nutmeg, and cinnamon feature prominently in the finish. Slight spicy bitterness lingers, along with a hearty dose of pulpy, pie-y malt. Medium-full body, with a creamy feel. Not bad, but there are better imperial pumpkin ales."
"O-a decent and drinkable pumpkin ale, but not as well-balanced as some others"
""
""
""
"I love this beer. It doesn't have n overwhelming pumpkin pie taste to it at all, like most tendto have. I got a case of short fills, brought them home, encouraged my parents to drink them sooner rather to later. Took 2 four packs out of the case for a party. Left the state for 5 days and came home to only 2 bottles left. It's just that good!"
"12 oz bottle from Trader’s Joe. Pours hazy brown with a short lived off-white head and lively carbonation. Nose reminds me of Belgian sour red, also some spices, caramel malt, hints of cacao. Body is full and tangy. Taste is some pumpkin, spices, herbal hops, brown sugar, and caramel. Finish is long and very spicy. Nice brew."

"Have yet to be disappointed with a River Horse beer."
""
""
"M + D: It's among the first page of heavy hitters as far as alcohol goes (at time of review). The alcohol sits fairly well behind a pretty solid flavour profile, and drinks remarkably smooth. A well-done beer, and one that will certainly have me more interested in trying out other River Horse offerings in the future."
"SOLID, NOT MUST HAVE!"
""
"Overall as someone that has had almost every solid example of a pumpkin ale that's ever been brewed. This one is slightly unbalanced, a bit boozy and forgetable overall. Would have better with less ABV and less spice additions probably."
""
""
""
""
"O - This may be my favorite pumpkin ale. I will soon be traveling to the nearby River Horse Brewery to enjoy this on tap."
"I went with a gentle pour so as not to disturb the lees and as such, I got only wisps for head. Color was an oh-so-slightly hazy orangish-amber. Nose smelled strongly of cloves and cinnamon, even a candy-like sweetness, like taffy. Unusual. Mouthfeel was slightly viscous and the taste was very much like pumpkin pie. Really spicy in terms of the nutmeg, cinnamon and cloves on the tongue, and coupled with the alcohol heat, this was a beer to be reckoned with! Finish allowed the sweetness of the malt and pumpkin puree to make an appearance. Whew! I liked it, but it is a beer to be reckoned with."

"Easily consumed from a Roosterfish pint glass. Being a pumpkin beer, this one could only be considered during the right season. This style is really not my preference, but River Horse seems to have done it well."
""
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the nectary and floral aromas, which helped keep things light. The cidery qualities were nice as well, but the souring was uncalled for. They should have either gone for it completely with the bitters and sours, or not at all. It left a bizarre muddled feel to the flavor. Additionally, the beer was horribly flat, making the mouthfeel none too exciting."
""
""
""
"O - Mellow and drinkable. Nice spice note, but low on pumpkin flavor."
""
""
"Big thanks goes out to the BA who sent me this one as an extra in a past trade (don't have my spreadsheet at home)! Served from bottle into a Samuel Smith imperial pint. Poured a dark red-orange with a one and a half finger off-white head that subsided to half a finger slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of pumpkin, spices, cinnamon, ginger, alcohol, and subtle nutmeg. The flavor was of sweet malt, subtle alcohol, pumpkin, cinnamon, subtle nutmeg, and spices. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty decent brew. I have grown to like Pumpkin brews more and more, and this one is a good example of why. The pumpkin definitely dominated the flavor and aroma on this one. While doing so, it brought a nice collection of spices to the game. Very well balanced and tasty. A definite must try for the curious or pumpkin brew fan a-like."

"Overall Impression- Now this one breaks into my top 5 list! Maybe I enjoy these high gravity/Imperial Pumpkin Ales MUCH more but how could you blame me? These ones have the punch of pumpkin and spice while the lower ABV Pumpkin Ales only have sweetness and malt that fill out the entire taste/mouthfeel. I would definitely get your hands on this one if you get a chance! Can't even notice it is a 8.1% brew!"

""

"Not a bad pumpkin, clove, cinnamon, nutmeg, all spice and squash, good malt character nice and bready with toffee and hints of caramel. Moderate carbonation a bit creamy."
""
""
""
"This is a nice pumpkin ale, but it's not setting and records."
"Smells like pumpkin pie or butternut squash cake. Body was ruddy orange with tan/beige head. Head lasts, it laces glass well. Tastes of nutmeg and cinnamon with a nice bite to it."
"Interesting, i always think the bigger versions have way more upside. This one may cellar for a few years. Going down great on a fairly cold October afternoon in Okieland. Good to see a decent offering from these guys. Started slow, but came on. My previous encounter was pretty underwhelming"
"O: This is an impressive beer that was rather good. One of the better ones that has been a stand out"
"This is an extremely drinkable beer. I liked this offering by River Horse. It is the first offering by that brewery that I really enjoyed."
"O: Pretty well representative of the style, just a little bitter and overspiced for a pumpkin ale IMO."
"O: Pretty good Pumpkin Ale, nice job River Horse nice to have another good brewery in Jersey."
"Overall: Well done pumpkin ale, and the age hasn't significantly hurt this. That being said, this one is just a bit light on actual pumpkin ale flavours. It tastes more like an imperial golden ale with just a hint of pumpkin pie. Not bad, but not as pumpkin-forward as I like."
"O- Not one of my favorite october beers but this one was not to bad."
"Poured into a tulip glass, a slightly hazy, burnt orange, with a finger or so of frothy white head that left some nice lacing. Aroma of malty sweetness, with light pumpkin and spices. Taste of caramel, sweet malts, toasted grains, with an adequate, non-overblown infusion of pumpkin pie. I prefer my pumpkin ales to have a big pumpkin and spice flavor, but this was still sufficient. Medium mouthfeel, a little bit of alcohol warmth, and generally drinkable."
"This one is a must try if you enjoy imperial pumpkin ales - much more drinkable than Pumking, as it's not the least bit cloying."
"This beer is """hot""" with alcohol notes and while not undrinkable, its not really all that pleasant, certaintly not easy drinking and not the greatest pumpkin beer out there this season."
"Very well rounded, well balanced beer, sweet, spicy, and bitter. None of which overwhelm or last long in the mouth either, an awesome autumn drinker!"
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a cloudy orange/brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is like fresh pumpkin pie. Taste is good, pumpkin, nutmeg, very flavorfull and the alcohol is well hidden. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall this is a beer worth seeking out."
"Pours a dark and cloudy orange with a half finger of head that dissipates quickly. Toffee is dominant in the nose, but not noticeable in the taste. The taste has a cider flavor up front and really lacks any pumpkin. This is not terribly heavy, but it is not an easy drinking beer either. The alcohol is not overwhelming, but it is present more so than in other imperial pumpkins. I'd recommend several other imperial pumpkins before this one."
"Notes: Not a bad offering overall but for me a bit too sweet, other than that the balance between pumpkin and spice has a nice rhythm and potential."
"Overall, this is a milder, better balanced Southern Tier Pumpking. In true River Horse fashion, nothing too aggressive here - just a solid addition to the fall beer field."
"The note on the label says """Nobody likes a show-off""". Well, mission accomplished there. I don't particularly care for over-spiced beers. If this weren't labelled as an """imperial", and the alcohol cut back a bit I would have been more impressed."
"o - To me this is a fairly standard beer. For people who don't want the artificial pumpkin taste this might be a good bet. I think River Horse does a good job of accurately creating a Pumpkin Ale but it's nothing spectacular."
"Very nice effort by River Horse. A fine example of a Pumpkin Ale. I think what's holding this one back a little is the faintness of the aromas and palate, it should stand out a little better without the drinker putting effort to taste and savor. Nonetheless, a worthy addition to the style."
"The best brew from river horse I have had. A great pumpkin brew."
"Overall: River Horse seems to have missed the mark with this one. While pumpkin meat and spices do appear in the beer, it’s overpowered by a very malt liquor-like alcohol hotness that is distracting and, honestly, unpleasant."
"Update: I tasted this side by side with the Weyerbacher Imperial Pumpkin and I was wrong. Weyerbacher is still the king of pumpkin ales in my book. River Horse comes in second."
"Medium short finish without cloying. Good carbonation. A nice beer but not one that shouts pumpkin at all. Tastes of spice on the palate are dominated by a pleasant booziness, only reappearing briefly in the finish. Overall, well made and tasty."
"Really good pumpkin with decent alcohol content. It is a sipper, unless you want to get buzzed quick and if that is the case just do a pumpkin bomb! Great dessert beer with a slice of pie or some ice cream. Most of the river horse beers are good and this is no exception."
"O: This beer is very flavorful and hides its alcohol very well considering the strength. I would definitely consider having this one again; it’s very good but a step or two below Weyerbacher’s Imperial Pumpkin."
"Poured a copper/brown/orangey color with a cream-tannish colored head about half an inch. Heavily carbonated. Smell was pumpkin pie- mostly cloves- faint pureed pumpkin. Taste was nice and well-balanced. Alcohol coming through giving a slightly sour flavor at times. Heavy on the sugary malts and cardamom. All spice. Great flavors. Nice pumpkin ale here. This was awesome but not the best I have had."
"Definitely not the best pumpkin beer I've ever had, but also not bad. Drinkable. But there are definitely better examples of this style out there."
"Overall, very solid fall beer. Can't wait to have more of it."
"O: Not a good aroma or flavor. Pretty bad pumpkin beer."
"Overall: Not too good, not too bad. If you are looking for a decent 4-pack of a imperial pumkin, it is worth a try. A bit too bitter up front for the style...pumpkin flavors are weak. I would skip this one and get the Southern Tier Pumking if you truly want to enjoy this style of beer in a tastier, more balanced form."
"o-good imp pumpkin ale. doesnt sit heavy on the stomach and can be enjoyed through out the night. like that it features more earthiness of pumpkin rather than the sweet pumpkin pie flavor."
"Overall- great beer, totally will buy it again. Well done RH! Cheers"
"Final Thoughts: A very nice pumpkin ale. I'll be buying more when the leaves are falling to the ground. Thumbs up River Horse."
"O: Better than your average Pumpkin Ale! Nose and Mouth-feel are exceptional. Great pumpkin flavors, good use of spices and an excellent balance. There's only some slight booze apparent which vanishes quickly."
"This pumpkin ale pours out as a deep copper color with a yellowish tan head. The head fizzles away leaving behind just a fee clumps on top of the beer. The smell is spicy and sweet smelling. The flavor of the beer doesn't really scream imperial to me, I found that the flavor was pretty much like any other regular pumpkin ale. The spices kick in right from the get go and the pumpkin is subtle in the background. The mouthfeel is carbonated and has a bite to it. Not a bad brew."
"D: Despite being 9% ABV, Hipp-O-Lantern drinks far more smoothly than it should. There's still a bit of a let down in terms of authentic pumpkin and spice flavors, but its pretty malt-forward with a bit of hop and specialty malt bitterness. I had a couple with ease and probably will again next year."
"D: Not recommended. One of the poorer showings that night."
"d- good stuff here for sure, yep. i'd drink this one again for sure. good stuff from river horse."
"Drinkability -- Not bad. Almost an Old Ale-cum-Pumpkin Ale: rich and fruity malt flavor with gentle spicing and adequate pumpkin character. One of my personal favorites of the style. Honestly, my only quip is the alcohol presence, while not terribly offensive, it should be really toned down for the style."
"D - This was a nice surprise...I did not know River Horse had a pumpkin ale, so I grabbed this one...not as good as Weyerbacher's Imperial Pumpkin, but it's a nice imperial pumpkin ale"
"D - It's not exactly a chore to drink but it's certainly much boozier than it needs to be. This one has too much alcohol and not enough of what really counts in a pumpkin beer; pumpkin and spice. There is some room to make this an awesome beer though."
"One extra note: allow this beer to warm up to just above cellar temperature, as this will take the edge off the alcohol, and increase the depth of the smell and taste. Great job, River Horse!"
"D - it's a decent tasting beer but the higher abv makes it a """one and done""" beer."
"D: Good but the alcohol hurts it a little."
"Mouthfeel is medium, but could be smoother and it gets a little thinner as it warms. This is a pretty tasty pumpkin ale from the folks down the road at River Horse."
"Taking a sip of Hopp-O-Lantern and it tastes great. It has an emphasize on spice, malt is also prevalent, and sweet, but not overboard. Mouthfeel is a proper balance for the style. Drinkability for an imperial pumpkin is surprisingly good. If you have access to this in your state, try it !"
"Pours a mud puddle brown color with some amber highlights. Fairly small tight head that settles into a light ring. The aroma is primarily of pumpkin pie spices; nutmeg and allspice come to mind with a hint of brown sugar. A rather subdued aroma. The flavor has some noticable pumpkin flavor to it, with the nutmeg and allspice spices. Some solvent notes come through from the ABV, which hinders the nice pumpkin and spice flavors. Kind of a shame. The feel is moderate with fizzy carbonation which gives the beer a nice crisp feel. The ABV is noticable and leaves a little belly burn. A bit sticky in the end. I wanted to like this pumpkin ale but the high abv prevented that from happening. It is not bad, has some nice flavor, but there is just not a need to imperialize this style. Worth a try."
"D - I found this above average overall, I would be pleased to try this again. It was a fresh tasting bottle and spicing doesn't overwhelm the taste. The only thing prohibiting multiple tastes is the abv a good Imperial, but there are a few that rank higher IMO"
"Pours a slightly thickened light to medium orange with a nice off white head. A bit of lacing as it goes down. Nose is caramel, brown sugar, hints of cream, and plenty of pumpkin spices. Taste is the same with the more traditional, non-spice flavors taking the front seat. Well balanced. Mouthfeel is medium and a bit creamy. Drinkability gets a higher score as this really goes down well and is one of only a few pumpkins beers that I can actually drink twelve ounces of."
"D - goes down smoothly, but the alcohol flavor really slows you down... which is good... because its 9%."
"River Horse is only 20 minutes from my home so I always want to try their brews whenever I can and as a fan of a good pumpkin ale I had to give this fall seasonal from their Brewer's Reserve a shot. This is a really nice looking pumpkin, a rich dark-orange color with significant beige head. Elaborate lacing coated the glass but without much head retention. Some """pumpkin beers""" seem to ignore actual pumpkin flavor all together but luckily River Horse kept it in the brew. This smells beautiful with a lot of allspice, cinnamon, pumpkin itself, and a little alcohol. The taste is much of the same but I couldn't actually taste the 9.00% ABV making it rather dangerous on a chilled autumn eve. Not much carbonation, the spicy flavor keeps your tongue occupied instead. The flavor wasn't as strong as it could have been which would be great for some folks but I really like my pumpkin beers to be fully flavored since I rarely enjoy more than one a night. Despite the higher ABV this is a pumpkin that someone could have a few of without being overwhelmed with spiciness. Not my favorite for the style but nothing particularly wrong with it either."
"Drinkability: this is a slow drinking beer but provides a sign that fall and football are starting. Definitely a well done beer, but alcohol will limit you to one per session."
"The carbonation is low, and the beer coats the mouth which mitigates the thin mouthfeel a bit. The fact that it's 9% ABV really sneaks up on you, though. The ABV isn't on the bottle, so I can see drinking a few of these in a row and then getting surprised when my head gets funny. But this a very good beer. I was very pleasantly surprised. I can definitely see coming back to this one a few times throughout the fall."
"Drinkability: Highly impressed by River Horse's offering, Hipp-O-Lantern shows what pumpkin beer properties should be all about, not overspiced and a medium malt backbone to keep it balanced. The highlight of this beer is the color, what a beautiful beer in the glass! The ABV is not too evident, but the added alcohol benefits this beer as it's not too thick where you wouldn't be able to grab another one. I've always been a fan of River Horse but they really put me over with this fall offering. Try it!"
"D: I can session on this beer way too easily. As soon as the temperature drops I am drinking multiple of these. Delicious, drinkable, fall, pumpkin beer. This one really surprised me. Color me impressed."
"highly recommend"
"D: Very drinkable, especially at 9%. My glass was empty before I realized it. That being said, overall I was slightly disappointed by this beer as the other beers I've tried from this brewery were very tasty. The pumpkin doesn't stand out much except with a slightly off aftertaste"
"D/M: Crisp and heavy but still very drinkable but definitely leaves an aftertaste. Very creative name and it was great to see such a great beer from NJ"
"this beer pours a hazy orange brown with a smallish off white head. it smells of pumpkin pie with whipped cream. the taste is awesome, pumpkiny with evened out spices. it leaves no bite on the tongue only a lingering taste of pumpkin pie and hops. the pumpkin isnt too overpowering; it goes well with the spices. not too thin of a beer either. i didn't notice it was 9 abv until i saw the bottle. this is a great beer."
"M/D: This beer is smooth with just a bit of heat form the alcohol. It is my first pumpkin of the season, and I think does a pretty good job overall. It would make for a nice sipper this fall, I probably wouldn't drink more than two in an evening."
"thanx to smutty33 for givin me one of these to try. and i am impressed.. i'm drinking it now and it holds up pretty solid to the other pumpkins out there.. and hats off to river horse for making an imperial pumpkin... this exceeded my expectations as i've had hop-o-lat-amus and some of their other stuff and i'd say it's just decent.. i'm not gonna do the whole ASTMD thing cuz i really don't know if many people give a s*** abot that to be honest.. but this was good.. very worthy of giving it a shot.. i will be picking this up on a near trip i'm sure.. I will say it's a solid B+.."
"I tried a couple other pumpkin beers with friends, and this took the cake. Its just not a novelty beer like many others, and tries to go back to the roots of being.... a beer!"
"D: A solid pumpkin beer and my first of the season. I am sure ill have this one again in the coming months"
"M/D - Full body that ends sticky, flavor lingers and as it fades the pumpkin an spices really shine through. Although it is sweeter than any I have tried it is really tasty, would probably be able to have a few if it was cooler. Impressed!"
"D: As a result of the thin-ish mouthfeel, it's a drinkable beer that may have you going through two or more in an evening if you're a fan of pumpkin beers. Definitely recommended for a go-around, and hats off to River Horse for making an imperial pumpkin ale."
"Drinkability - This is a nice dessert beer. I would likely only drink one at a sitting, though."
"Overall I would give this beer a """Very Good""" rating. It is one of the bigger pumpkins out there, aside from say ST Pumpking, and sure will take the chill out of a cool fall night. I would definately recomend it for anyone who likes a stronger pumpkin ale"
"Overall- The 1st Pumpkin of the season and I think it sets the bar pretty high. 1 of my friends said, """tastes like Autumn", and that's a good thing!"
