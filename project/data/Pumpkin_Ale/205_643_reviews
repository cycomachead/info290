"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before 11/13/2014. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy orange/copper color with a 1 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of pumpkin, toasted biscuit, brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, and herbal/toasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and solid complexity of bready malt, pumpkin, and spice notes; with solid strength. Taste of pumpkin, toasted biscuit, brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, and herbal/toasted earthiness. Minimal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of pumpkin, toasted biscuit, brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, and herbal/toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Good balance and solid robustness of bready malt, pumpkin, and spice flavors; with no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a very smooth and slightly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is ok. A little watered down feeling in mouthfeel, but not bad. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very solid pumpkin ale. All around good balance and solid robustness/complexity of bready malt, pumpkin, and spice flavors; and very smooth to drink. A pleasantly enjoyable offering."

"O- not a lot of pumpkin flavor, drinks more like an amber ale"
"Overall:  Pretty decent pumpkin beer, but nothing great.  The little bit of sourness at the finish is interesting.  I’m glad I tried it, and if offered, I wouldn’t turn it down, but I probably won’t get it again next autumn."

"I was shocked to see this have such a low review! It was last of all the pumpkins! I really enjoyed it! It had a light taste with a pleasant amount of pumpkin and spice! Not too bitter and no bad after taste."

"Taste / Palate: Like its aroma it has a light body with thin pumpkin pie spice and light squash like pumpkin notes. Hop flavor and bitterness are very low. The palate is light and well carbonated making it easy to drunk. Notes: It is definitely not the most complex pumpkin beer but there are no unpleasant or off flavors. The highlight to this beer is that I could drink quite a few of these in a session unlike some of the heavier spiced pumpkin ales."

"Pours a amber in color with a 1-finger white foamy head that settles down to nothing really fast. Actually no lacing is seen either. The aroma is light with pumpkin and spices. The taste is a little 'watered' down but you can taste the pumpkin with cinnamon and nutmeg with maybe a slight taste of cloves for the finish. Overall, it was alright."

"Amber colored with a long lasting off white head. Nose is pumpkin, vegetable leaves and vines; sweet cooked sugar, light cinnamon and cooking spices, noble, herbal hops. Taste follows nose with big pumpkin vegetable flavor; a sour tang underneath and some noble hop bitterness. High carbonation and medium thin mouthfeel. Tastes like fall to me."
""
""
""
""
"Light orange body, decent head but fizzles to nothing in no time which no trace left behind. Aroma is better with aroma reminiscent of pumpkin pie and assorted spices. The flavor's a mess though. Disjointed spices and cinnamon with a watery malty base. Feel kind of numbs the tongue a bit in the end(!). Mild medicinal feel, not very good at all."

""

"Overall: A servicable pumpkin ale with some intrique, but falls short of the potential of the style."

"Overall I thought this beer was just ok and as far as Pumpkin Ales go I would say this is just about as average as they get, it's got the tell tale sign of an average Pumpkin beer with the spices being the most dominant aspect and covering up some of those malts and pumpkin flavors. This beer had decent drinkability, it was fairly smooth and not filling, but the flavors didn't really hold my attention so I think one would be enough for me. What I liked most about this beer was the mouthfeel, I thought it was nice and it worked well with this beer. What I liked the least about this beer were the dominating spices, if they were toned down some this beer could have some potential. I wouldn't buy this beer again, it's not hard to find a much better pumpkin beer. I wouldn't really recommend this as a good pumpkin beer. All in all I wasn't a big fan of this beer, it wasn't that great, but it was still better than I thought it would be. Better luck next time guys."
"This is pretty standard as far as pumpkin ales go: more spice than anything else. A so-so fall offering."
"O: The beer is easy to drink but there are a lot of more interesting and more complex pumpkin ales available with more pumpkin flavors. I probably would not grab this one again but I would not suggest avoiding it."
""
"O: One of the best pumpkin beers I've had. If you want a pumpkin pie then look elsewhere; this one doesn't have a heavy spice flavor. If you want a well-balanced beer that is perfect for autumn, then pick it up."

"I liked this Pumpkin Ale version. I like a pumpkin beer to taste of pumpkin and spices and this delivers on both. Perhaps it is personal taste, but my wife and I tried this and another brewer's pumpkin beer at the same time. Without consultation, we both chose this one over the other."

"Overall I would consider this the """poor man's pumpkin ale.""" Not a trainwreck of a beer but one of the weakest offerings I've had. Not enough flavor and it feels watered down. I wouldn't recommend this but if you're in a bind and this is all you can get to satisfy that fall beer craving try it out. The subdued flavor might be good for someone who doesn't typically like the style or just starting out"
""
""

""

"Mouthfeel is too thin and too highly carbonated. It goes down like maybe a summer ale, and it could be a session beer if it didn't cost so much and actually tasted alright. Overall, this is a mass produced halfhearted attempt at a pumpkin ale, and I regret buying the six-pack, especially considering that it cost a few bucks more than it should have."

"Overall I give this beer a hearty recommendation. If you are a pumpkin beer fan, this one definitely shouldn't disappoint."
""
"Taste is pleasantly spicy, yet light in body and feel. And despite the poor reviews, I find this to be an easy-drinking, subtle pumpkin ale. Certainly, it's not as complex and layered as some pumpkin ales out there, but I've had worse. No problems here."
""
"Saw this at ABC looks like a good holiday brew so let's give it a whirl. Popping the top a get a whiff of pumpkins and spice and everything nice. Starts foaming out of the bottle top like a rabid dog so I quickly pour it into my trusty SAPP and the result is a very foamy light bronze with a structurally sound, head of off-white foam. On the taste this brew has hints of pumpkin (brilliant!) but otherwise has the characteristics of a tasty golden ale. The pumkin flavor is evident up front and carries through the middle, but is then smashed out Gallagher-like in the end by a funky semi-sweet zestiness that then finishes flatly bitter. Mouthfeel is a little bit too carbonated to carry the pumpkin to the finish line. All said this would be a good tailgate brew at your favorite football game, I think it would suit brats and burgers well. Not all that great as a sole drinker."

"Enjoyed the folksy bottle art, but liked the tasty pumpkin ale even better. One of the best pumpkin ales that I've had all season. Not over spiced so the pumpkin flavor can be enjoyed. I find most pumpkin ales are ruined by well intentioned """spicers""" who mask what true pumpkin aficionados are looking for."

"I would drink this while playing music by the Dutch drummer Han Bennink!"
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste has a nice balance of spices to it with a hint of pumpkin. The malt come through nicely also. The mouth feel is ok and overall it is a average tasting pumpkin beer."
""
"O: not bad but not great. I would drink it again but not pay much for it. All in all an average beer that has some katchupy pumpkin in it."
""
""
"O: I would label this as an average, run of the mill pumpkin beer. Does have some flavor and does a good job of not adding too much spice or nutmeg which can kill a pumpkin beer sometimes."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a bad beer. Nothing good about it. It's like a macro with a hint of pumpkin."
"Poured into a pint glass. Pours orangish copper with a thin white head that dissipates quickly. There are a lot of visible tiny bubbles in this beer. There isn't much of an aroma. I pick up some pumpkin and some of those spices. There's some sweetness in the flavor as well as some pumpkin and faint spices. I get some malt too. There just isn't much going on here. There's some sweetness in the flavor as well as some pumpkin and faint spices. I get some malt too. There just isn't much going on here. This is a disappointing beer. If this is supposed to be America's """original""" pumpkin beer, it's a wonder this style ever got off the ground."
""
"This is inoffensive enough to serve to non-beer connoisseurs, which puts it ahead of many pumpkin ales, but I would not buy this again."
""
"cheers LampertLand"
"O) If you are in search of a good pumpkin ale to enjoy this Fall, move along, there is nothing to see here."
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy amber color with a minimal white head that is gone in a flash. The aroma smells of spices and a modest dose of pumpkin with little else to speak of. Flavor is unlike anything I've tried before. A vague, unnatural juiciness presents up front, augmented by a spiciness that feels out of place with such a watery mouthfeel. There is an almost bile-like quality lurking in the wash. This initial assault soon evaporates, leaving a mild, wheaty haze at the finish. I think I may detect some hops near the back end as well, but it's hard to say. Very hard to find anything positive to say here."
""
""
""
"O - There is little to offer this as a better option to any other pumpkin beer. Not a bad beer, but hardly a standout."
""
""
""
""
"Pretty lack luster. Probably best to pass on this one."
"This is absolutely disgusting and possibly the worst pumpkin beer on the market. I wanted a beer-Not water with pumpkin spice. Disgusting disgusting disgusting!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall- I enjoyed the smell, but the watered down fake pumpkin flavors left this as a less desirable pumpkin beer."
""
""
""
""

"O - A decent, simple pumpkin beer that reminds me of a spiced wheat beer"

"Poured this Pumpkin Ale from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. It poured a clear orangish color, produced a thin white head, featured poor head retention and it left no lacing on the glass. The aroma contained pumpkin, spice (mostly clove). Medium in body, this ale had a foundation of malted grain, cinnamon, clove and only mild pumpkin flavor. Disappointed with the level of pumpkin flavor in this beer. Only slight suggestions of hops, typical for the style- semi dry finish. The bottle claims that his is America's first Pumpkin Ale. It generally does get that credit, I will say that while this is a decent session beer- I expected more from the """original"""...There are much better pumpkin ales out there- Go out and find one!"
"Definitely lacking any kick or spiciness usually reserved for pumpkin season. The nose is a bit sour I picked up a six-pack at a North Carolina convenience store and dont think I will ever finish it with all the quality beer in the Asheville area. Seems almost like an Oktoberfest with a sprinkle of pumpkin."
""
""
""
"The beer pours an orange color with a small white head. The aroma is grain and cinnamon, with a few other assorted spices thrown in. The flavor is similar. I get a lot of nutmeg and cinnamon notes, as well as a hint of cinnamon. Overall, the beer is lacking in the aroma and flavor and doesn't stand up to the better pumpkin beers. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"I would drink this again, but it's far from my favorite."
""
"O - It's like a watered down version of a pumpkin ale. The flavors and aromas I get are good, but they seem muted. I would like a stouter version."
""
""
"O: I always look forward to trying new pumpkin ales each fall, but this one was disappointing"
"O - An introductory pumpkin beer."
"Poor. And I've got 5 more to drink. It would score better if they didn't call it a pumpkin ale because it leaves you wanting something better. In the grand scheme of beer, it's merely average and better than an American macro any day, it's not a very good pumpkin ale."
""
""
""
"O: Meh."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Eh, and that's being generous. Big blast of spice followed by nothing. It's like pumpkin soda, which is good if that's what you're looking for."
""
""
""
"The color when poured into a pint glass was a sort of yellow/orange with very little foam and very little lace on the side of the glass. The smell of spice was evident in the aroma. Not a lot of pumpkin flavor, but some bitter spices in the finish. Not what I expected for a Pumpkin Ale. Just to bitter and not alot of spicey pumpkin flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O. Very light and watery. Nothing I would drink again. No, I would not recommend this beer to a friend."
""

"Poured into a Black Raven imperial pint Pours a slightly hazy medium orange amber. Thin head that fizzes out instantaneously (but made an interesting sound as it did so). No head, lacing or carbonation. Light aroma of sweet malt and pumpkin pie spices. Taste is dry pumpkin, with a distinct earthy note that had a hint of moldiness. Finishes with a slightly sour, dry flavor. Light bodied. Not that good."

"Bottle from Wing Central in U district into a pint glass. Aroma was of mild pumpkin, yeast, cinnamon and sugar. Appearance was very bubbly. Very dark orange, fizzy, and head leaves quick. Almost glassy. Lots of bubbles stick to the side of the glass. It’s more like a pumpkin soda than an ale. Taste was bland pumpkins. Sweet and not a really big profile. Too much carbonation with the sting to go with it. Palate was soda-like. Sticky and strong carbonation is all I can say. Overall, if you are looking for a good pumpkin beer, keep clear. I’ve spoiled myself having had Pumpking and Great Pumpkin as some of my first pumpkin beers. I really appreciate the style of beer. Having said that, this is not a quality pumpkin beer. I can appreciate it, but it’s for sure not a beer drinkers beer. Alcoholic pumpkin soda"
""
""
""
"I’m not fond of this beer."
""
""
""
"O - overall this is really drinkable, thought exceptionally unremarkable. In a sense, it is less than the sum of its parts, with just a hint of spicy pumpkin holding it up. Ultimately it's a bit dilute and subtle versus a lot of more direct pumpkin beers out there."

"This beer pours a clear orange amber color. It has about a finger of loose sudsy head resting on top. The head disappears almost as fast as it came, leaving no lace behind as it falls. The nose is pretty faint. I am getting some pumpkin sweetness and some light fall spice aromas. The taste follows the nose pretty well. It starts off malty and there is some pumpkin and and fall spices like cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice. There is also just a touch of hops, and there is some lingering sweetness in the finish. This is on the light side of medium and it's carbonation is pretty high. It is very tingly, but has a pretty smooth feel to it. This has okay drinkability. It goes down pretty easy and the flavor is okay. It has the pumpkin and spice that most other pumpkin ales have, but they are pretty watered down. Overall this is an alright pumpkin ale. It is worth a shot, but I won't be buying it again."
""
""
""
""
"Orange in color. Head was fizzy and dissapeared quickly. Aroma smelled ofsweet pumpkin puree. Upon first SIP, it was sweet up front but its body dissapeared. The malt is almost non existent. Ended up tasting like soda. Mothfeel was fuzzy and soda-like. Drain pour."
""
""
""
""
"O: This is far from the best pumpkin beer I have had. It is weak and just lacks a lot of flavor. Def wont buy again."
""
""
""
"Drinkability: A nice and solid pumpkin ale. Not boundary pushing, yet more complex then several i have had this year. I would get a six of this."
""
"Overall a Pumpkin Ale that was super light in flavor, even so you could taste the pumpkin and spices. But it did have a mild vinegar presence at the finish which was unusual for this type of beer. I was also surprised to see it come in a twist off bottle."
""
""
"Overall: Good tasting, but lacks complexity and balance."
"Overall Drinkability - I think this beer is great at what it does. Not my style, but I can totally appreciate it. It's soft, mild, balanced, flavorful, and inoffensive. Great novelty beer."
"Overall - an uninteresting yet swilling pumpkin ale."
"Body-Medium weight and fizzy. Not much interesting here just fairly easy drinking. I like it. I see this as more of a pumpkin I want to drink when it’s actually cold due to the spice. I like it, although the pumpkin and spice is fairly dominant over the actual beer flavors. Would get it again, though nothing great"
"This is one of the poorer pumpkin ales I've tried."
"O - Not impressed overall with this one, the flavors seem just a tad off, while it feels like a soda instead of a beer in your mouth. Certainly much better alternatives in the pumpkin ale department."
"Overall - This beer is definitely something out of the ordinary."
"this beer is like thanksgiving in your mouth you can taste the pumpin cinnamon and all the other floral smells that thanksgiving has to offer i would definatly have this with turkey it would be freakin perfect dont pass this one up i got it at my grocery store"
"O: Ugh.... Not fun at all. The carbonation is so distracting that I can't gain any bit of satisfaction. There's defiantly a pumpkin presence, but that doesn't save it from being sub par. I can't recommend this to anyone. Please look to other pumpkin ales."
"This is one of those mass-market pumpkin beers. Probably the worst one I've had. I guess I should have done some research before I bought it. If this truly is """the original""" pumpkin beer, I'm glad other breweries have done much better things with this sub-style since this."
"Very thin body with a pop-like carbonation. The flavor is also thin. There is a watery orange flavor (no sugar). No lasting aftertaste. Generally speaking, this is a weak beer with a touch of pumpkin flavor."
"O: Maybe I have been spoiled by the pumpkin ales I have had locally, but my suggestion is to avoid this one."
"overall not my cup of tea. just too overwhelming and sweet."
"Overall - I just wish that this beer tasted more like it smells but that might just be me being a fan of spicy beers. That said go grab one and see for yourself."
"I was recommended this brew as a nice counter to the more heavily spiced painted ladies. I have to say, the recommendation was spot on. This pumpkin brew is more heavily on the sweet side. It's dominated by sugary pumpkin and very little spice. I'm not pulling many more characteristics out of this beer as all I taste is sweetness. There is a moment when the beer slides down my throat where I get a hint of bitterness but it lasts a microsecond and then the finish is again all sweet. It's certainly a different take on pumpkin but not one I can say I favor."
"Overall: The guy at Sydney's recommended this and I'm glad I tried it. Honestly, it isn't that far off the DFH Punkin. A nice surprise. It's a great pumpkin, Charlie Brown."
"Picked up a six pack of this at Whole Foods for about $10, because I had not previously seen any beers from BBB anywhere in MA. Poured into a standard pint glass. Bright orange color. Nice sized head forms with an aggressive pour, but that fades quickly. Moderate amount of carbonation, and a tiny bit of lacing. Smell had a distinct aroma of vegetables, which was earthy but not very appealing. Flavor tasted like authentic pumpkins - mostly like a steamed gourd. There was no """pumpkin spice""" flavors at all. It just tastes like squash really. Mouthfeel was adequate, with a smooth but thin body. This beer might have been novel and great when it was first released, but it's been surpassed in flavor a long time ago. Nice to try, but really not very flavorful."
"not my favorite of the pumpkin beers. this one pours a little cloudy with a nice autumn color palate. smell is spice heavy, maybe cloves and nutmeg. i dont smell the pumpkin itself really. taste is again strong on the spice front, with a balanced malt body in the medium range. good in the fall, but there are much better ones out there."
"The mouthfeel is a bit too thin."
"Overall: To be honest this stuff just tastes commercial to me. I don't know if it's really considered commercial or not, but personally, I think it has all of the tell-tale signs of a beer that has been produced as quickly and cheaply as possible."
"O - overall, a nice easy drinking beer. Nothing too special I guess but not too bad on a fall day."
"O: Overall, it isn't the best pumpkin beer I've had by far. But I do think it's far better then some of the more popular pumpkin ales out there. This is my session pumpkin beer of choice to be honest."
"Overall, an easy drinking mild pumpkin beer. Its very subtle in flavour. I prefer a bit more substance for the style."
"D: Started well, but ends a little disappointingly. I like the hints of pumpkin, but that ends up falling short by the finish. A little more balance between feel and taste would help."
"Buffalo Bill's Pumpkin Ale pours a hazy orange with an off white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma doesn't do much for me, perhaps it's even a tad metallic. The flavor is a slap in the face of cinnamon followed by pumpkin pie spices. In the following sips pumpkin spices are more apparent without the cinnamon stealing the show. This isn't really my thing but not bad for what it is."
"O: Easy drinker, one that I could definitely have multiples of."
"Overall, I'll buy this each year. It really tastes centered and down to earth -- and earthy. I like it compared to the generic, over-spiced brews that have flooded the market."
"Overall- I had last years and I remember it being a little more potent and having more flavor to it. I will try next years and see how that is. Cheers"
"The aroma has potential if that artificiality wasn't there."
"O: Being the original doesn't mean it's the best."
"Overall: I don't know how to say this... this wasn't much of a beer. Easy drinking, but nothing to savor. Just needs to be more bold all around."
"O: Overall, the beer was drinkable but not crafted very well. If the pumpkin and spice flavors were a little more natural tasting and the flavors all cooperated with each other, this would be a good pumpkin beer. This was a decent first pumpkin beer for me, but I probably won't buy it again."
"O - Not gonna be a seasonal favorite of mine. Seemed like a bit of a mess that ultimately lacked flavor and character."
"Drinkability: Too watered down for my liking. Nice aroma, but not much else."
"Overall this is a forgettable Pumpkin ale in a market that is saturated with much better examples, both sessionable and Imperial varieties. Elysian makes the best sessionable example if you ask me and Weyerbacher and Williamsburg makes great Imperial versions. Look elsewhere for your Gourd fix this season."
"Pours a cloudy copper orange color with a light fluffy head that disappears quickly. Scent is heavy in pumkin, nuttmeg, clove spice, and a little bananna. Taste is smooth and clean. You can definetly pick out the pumpkin taste and a little of the spice but that's about it. I was really hoping for more spice flavor that basically reminds me of a pumpkin pie. Something seasonal to get you into the festive fall mood but that's about it."
"Overall a pretty average pumpkin ale. I guess you could call it a session beer, but I wouldn't really want more than 2 or 3 of these. I would have liked a fuller taste profile with more pumpkin flavor. Making things worse...these are twist offs making them unusable for my homebrew... so I knocked off a few points for that. Theres your beer karma for ya Buffalo Bill."
"o- the beer was alright..I like pumpkin beers and wanted to tryit, I would not buy a case of it tho"
"o: one of the worst pumpkin beers out there, unless you love spices in large amounts. not worth seeking out. my tongue and back of my throat are still burning ten minutes after finishing this beer. glad my brother paid for this six pack."
"O: Not nearly as awful as I feared, but not good."
"Poured with very little head, and what little there was disappeared quickly. Copper color, very clear. Smelled of soil with traces of spice and tea leaves. Tasted slightly malty with hints of cinnamon and nutmeg - I guess a little pumpkin somewhere in there as well. Almost tasted more like chai tea then pumpkin ale. Very crisp mouthfeel - lots of carbonation. Finishes smooth and clean, but nothing really stands out about the taste. Overall, not a bad beer, but nothing I would go out of my way to drink again with all of the other more flavorful pumpkin ales available these days."
"Pours a clear, copper color. 1/4 inch head of a white color. Slight retention and slight lacing. Smells of sweet malt, pumpkin, spice (all spice?), and slight grain. Fits the style of a Pumpkin Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of pumpkin, slight sweet malt, slight grain, slight pale malt, and spice (all spice). Overall, decent aroma and blend, but the pumpkin is strong and easily discernible."
"Overall: One of the better pumpkin beers that I've had to date."
"Not a bad pumpkin beer, just a little light in the flavor."
"M - Medium-to-thin body. Heavily carbonated. Leaves the mouth feeling watery and metallic."
"Pours out a dark orange with a thin whitehead that quickly disappears leaving no lacing or retention and lots of bubbles going to the top. The smell is by far the best of any pumpkin ale I have tasted. The aroma of cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and all-spice makes you look forward to drinking this beer. The taste starts out with some pumpkin and hints of spices, but not much there in the taste. Rather disappointing after such a wonderful aroma from this beer. The mouthfeel is very thin and watery which makes for easy drinking and not much else. Overall this is just an average beer that just doesn't do much for me."
" Two of my roommates who aren't big beer drinkers actually loved the flavor and said it was a great beer though."
"not a bad beer but a pretty bad pumpkin beer. This beer pours a ok looking cloudy brown. The smell is just a beer smell. There's no spiciness nothing special at all. I expect some sweetness and fall spices but there isn't much goin on here at all. The taste has the same problem. There just isn't enough goin on. This is an average beer ane a below average pumpkin ale. I was really not impressed by this. The only thing pumpkin about this is the one on the label."
"O - Really a bland beer but it is something that I might pick up if there were no other interesting options."
"Just cracked one open, poured into the trusty old double handed Jax mug. Pours a decently pretty and slightly burnt orange color. Rather carbonated. No lacing or head retention really at all. Taste wise I'm impressed and I'll tell you why. Most pumpkin beers are simply filled with pumpkin spices. This beer you can actually noticeably taste the pumpkin juice itself which is quite refreshing, followed by a well balanced after taste of the usual spice suspects. My only complaint is the body and mouthfeel on this one leave MUCH to be desired, though the taste is really quite good. All in all, a great session beer for those chilly fall nights. Bout to go have another out on the porch and enjoy this new found fall weather. Cheers BA brethren."
"D: Drinkability is quite high, if you actually like this beer. It's not terrible, but I probably wouldn't buy it again."
" Did they mess up the recipe for this batch I wonder. I tried 3 from this case so far and wish I could return it."
"O- My favorite pumpkin ale."
"smell the spices seem to be a bit muted but the flavor does come around in the palate."
"This beer was poured into a snifter. The beer has an orangish hazing hue to it with no head and no lacing. The beer has a slight pumpkin smell to it and almost no hints of cinnamon or allspice. The mouthfeel is very light and thin and is dominated by the carbonation. Way to overpowering. The beer has a large malt presence with a burnt taste to it. The aftertaste suggests a slight amount of spices and pumpkins. Overall, I'm not impressed with this beer, but it's not horrible."
"Overall: Get the smells on the nose to be present on the sip, and get a creamier mouth feel and this would be a decent pumpkin brew. It is not too late to believe that this thing can not be fixed. Until then, look elsewhere for that perfect autumn beer."
"This pours a light golden color, I poured very aggressive and got a very short lived head, it fizzed away faster than a coke and left me with absolutely no foam. The smell is of spices and cloves with a little pumpkin. Feel is light. Taste has some pumpkin and spices, but overall its pretty light and not very impressive. I doubt I ever get this beer again."
"Overall – not a bad brew, but not very interesting either. Also not one of the tastier of the pumpkin flavored beers."
"O: It’s a good overall effort. Fairly standard as far as mainstream pumpkin ales go. It’s not bad but it isn’t as satisfying as I’d like my pumpkin/fall-winter ales to be."
"Cheers!"
"Pours a hazy golden brown with a frothy white head that doesn't stick around long. Smells like your usual fare for pumpkin ales (nutmeg, cinnamon). Taste is pretty much the same with the addition of pumpkin and allspice. Overall a decent fall seasonal that doesn't slam you with too much pumpkin pie essence."
"Overall: BB's is one of the first pumpkin beers I had years and years ago alongside Post Road. It was a simpler time, really. Years later, it's now one of the more milder, easy drinking of the bunch, with its relatively lighter tastes, particularly the spices, and the effervescent body. While not bad, it seems most are leaning towards the bolder in the growing style, like Pumking or Weyerbacher's version. I can't say I blame them."
"Pours a hazy orange with a 1 inch extremely fizzy off-white head that fades to nothing. No lacing whatsoever. Smell is of some malt, spices, and maybe a vegetable pumpkin-esque aroma. Pretty tame overall. Taste is of spices up front with a pumpkin-like malt flavor on the finish. The aftertaste has hints of pumpkin pie. Way too carbonated however, with a soda-like fizzy feel in the mouth. Overall, not a very good pumpkin beer at all. It may be """America's Original""" but that doesn't mean it's anything worth drinking."
"Overall, this is a decent / average Pumpkin ale, and you have to give them points for being the originator of what is now a very popular historic brew style that goes back to our colonial days when our founding fathers brewed with pumpkins to give jolly King George some crap, and tell him where he could shove his English malts! Worth trying..."
"O-It's average to below. There are alot of pumpkin beers out there, alot I am sure that are way better. Sorry Buffalo Bill, your finishing near the bottom of the AFC pumpkin beer division"
"Not a bad pumpkin ale, decent flavor going on but the mouthfeel ruins it a bit, that and the fizziness make me wonder if these have carbonation issues. Goes down pretty easily."
"Serving type: bottle (poured into glass)."
"D-Overall this brew was just ok. Wish the pumking came through more and wish it was alittle more complex. Wont try this one again but it was decent to drink once."
"I would like to try the Imperial Pumpkin from them just to see the difference."
"Poured into imperial pint glass. Poured a very pale straw color, not typical for this style. Thin bubbly head that didn't last long. Small streams of bubbles rose from the bottom. Some times the aroma was like a fake pumpkin pie ice cream, other times it reminded me of cheap cafeteria meatball subs. Very strange combo. Flavor was remarkably like the aroma. A hint of pumpkin flavors, but overwhelmed by a watery ketchup flavor. Just ok in the mouth. A bit thin, and the carbonation definitely overpowered it. Overall not a good beer. Flavor was meh at best, definitely not worth what I paid."
"O: Bland & disappointing. Maybe this bottle was too old? Is 6 months too long for a pumpkin ale to retain its flavor? One and done."
"I remember having this a long time ago, during my Purdue years, so I figured I'd revisit it whilst filling one of my newest mixed sixers. It pours a mostly clear orange-amber topped by a finger of off-white foam. Plenty o' particulates float about, suspended in mid-beer. The nose comprises cinnamon, vanilla, nutmeg, clove, brown sugar, pumpkin pie filling, and honey. I wouldn't mind having a candle with this scent. The taste holds notes of clove, light black pepper, pumpkin seeds, flowers, and some light greens. Not only does this flavor combination not really follow the nose at all, it's decidedly weaker, blander, and mildly bitterer. The body is a straight medium, with a moderate carbonation and a kinda oily feel. Overall, a meek and meager pumpkin beer, one that I really don't feel like having again."
"Cheers!"
"Has an orangish color to it. Smells of pumpkin obviously and spices such as cinnamon and nutmeg. Tastes like pumpkin all spiced up and has a very good smooth feeling in the mouth. So taste and mouthful says it all for the this beer. Not a bad beer, but a good beer if your into an average Joe brand kind of beer."
"D- The ABV is low in this which makes it a easy drinker. The flavor is muted and more pumpkin pie forward than actual pumpkin tasting. A average pumpkin beer at best. Glad I got to try this one out."
"From fall brew tasting notes (2010): Pours a light yellow-orange color with a weird head that fizzles away rapidly like soda, leaving not so much as a single bubble on top. Aroma is extremely strong nutmeg and cinnamon. Cloves come in at the end. No beer aroma, just spices. Taste is offputtingly spicy. No pumpkin character here until late in the aftertaste, but it definitely gets better as it warms. The taste is extremely over-spiced. This one is really rough on the palate."
"D: I might have never given this beer a second chance, had it not been for a six-pack brought to a family gathering by my cousin. I first tasted this beer on-draft at the brewpub in Hayward around 1999 and I found it to be overpowering in the intensity of pumpkin pie spices at that time. For years after I would turn my nose up at these bottles whenever I'd see them. Presently, it seems that this beer is able to hold its own with other common pumpkin ales. Never mind that years of experience have taught me to lower my expectations when it comes to this style."
"D- it was a malty pumpkin beer that wsa one of the bottom 3 i have had. There will not be another purchase but it will do in a bind."
"Before I sampled this beer, I expected something heavier in body. It's supposed to taste like a pumpkin pie, right? But my biggest issue was that I just couldn't taste the pumpkin. When combined with the high carbonation, I'd pass if I had the chance to drink this again."
"i dont care for this ale really at all. Money well spent."
"D: Honestly, even with the low taste score, this beer is fairly drinkable... the aftertase is ok, and the carbonation makes it feel almost like soda, which is always easy to drink."
"D: Easy to drink. Some of that may be due to the lack of flavor. Easy to chug."
"Overall, what we liked most about this beer was the spicy and full aroma. The taste, however, predominantly lacked much of the nose, and failed to make up for it in any other aspect of its being."
"Overall, some subtle strengths & some significant weaknesses. Definitely at the bottom of the pumpkin ale pile, in my experience."
"D - Very middle-of-the-road Pumpkin ale, I'm afraid. It doesn't really do anything for me, and it doesn't really stand out from any of the other pumpkin ales out there."
"O: I like pumpkin ales so this is preferred to many beers, but this is most certainly not my favorite of the pumpkin beers."
"All in all though, it is a very drinkable beer, and certainly not a disaster. The packaging is attractive- it looks good on a table for an autumn feast- and most of your less beer savvy friends will like it. But there are much better pumpkin beers out there. This is nothing special."
"D: The beer is drinkable and goes down easily, but there's nothing interesting in the smell or taste that would make me want to try this one again."
"All in all, nope. Don't worry about this brew."
"I love pumpkin beers.So I gave this one a try.At first I didn't know what to make of it.But the more I drank the more my taste buds enjoyed it. This seems to have an overwhelming citrus flavor if poured into a glass.But from the bottle its seems more like a pumpkin and clove tasting beer.Sometimes beers seem to unlock more flavor when you pour them into a glass. Seems more intense in flavor.But don't let that stop you from trying it.YOu may miss out on something you would've loved."
"D: For as few positive marks as this gets, I still find it drinkable and an apt harbinger of autumn. Maybe there's some sentimentality here, as I recall friends bring over (and ultimately leaving behind) a 6-pack years ago when we moved into our house. I 've always tried to pick up at least a few bottles every fall ,despite a few better pumpkin ales on the market (though, sadly, not enough for my liking). Worth a try, but then, if you like the style enough, look elsewhere..."
"Nice cinnamon aftertaste. I don't really like to eat pumpkin pie or pumpkin inspired food so I was eary about buying this, pleasantly surprised. I could drink more than one of these at a time."
"Drink-ability: Much too filling. I feel like I ate an entire pumpkin pie; one and I will never drink another again."
"D/M: Very crisp and light on the tongue. The carbonation was good but really dissipated quickly. I wanted a little more spice and punch from the flavors. This was a good subtle beer to enjoy."
"D: Kind of flavorful, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, not the best representation of style, the sweetness and lack of hops doesn't bother me with this beer because it's a Pumpkin Ale. I think the only thing that separates this beer from others in the style is the much lighter malt character. However, for this style, that is a very significant and detrimental difference."
"Pours a copper brown color with a very thin off white head. The nose brings a ridiculously overloaded amount of spice. Taste brings ever so slight hints of caramel and sweetness sitting behind ginormous amounts of nutmeg, cinnamon, allspice, clove, and probably every other spice man has ever found. Way too spicy and a bit thin overall. Poor drinkability. The epitome of what not to do with a spiced beer."
"D- I wouldn't go seek this beer out but I could drink it again. I think there are better pumkin ales out there. Over all I'm still on the fence with this beer."
"Pours a bright orange colour with almost no head and zero lacing. Smells like nutmeg and pumpkin, but fairly faint. No noticeable smell of beer really. Flavour is a bit sweet and spicy, but not the rich pumpkin pie flavour I'm used to from pumpkin beers. Way under-carbonated, but not quite flat. Ok beer, but not one I plan to pick up again."
"Very slight notes of pumpkin pie and nutmeg are evident in this beer but overall it is a bland product with little standout points. This is a fun novelty beer for the fall with friends but not something that woudl become a staple of anyones beer fridge."
"Not a fan but my wife liked it."
"This is very watery for a pumpkin ale--it poured orange with a lot of fizzy carbonation and no head to speak of. It smells very sweet with a little bit of yeast and allspice and tastes the same--very clovey, very sweet, very simple malt profile, not much going on outside of the sweetness. A thoroughly average beer."
"D - I cant imagine drinking many of these in a row. I'd buy it again, but it is not something that I would use as a session beer."
"The yeast kind of ruined this for me. It tastes more like a hefe than pumpkin ale. I don't know if i had a bad bottle or if they just didn't label it as.bottle conditioned."
"D-I wouldn't turn it down, but it's not anything worth seeking out."
"Atmosphere is okay. The appearance is really pedestrian. Nose is a pretty aromatic combination of grain and sweet spice components. Flavor is very disjointed, and just not all that appealing. Overall, this is not the greatest quaff."
"Pours a cloudy golden orange with a thin fizzy head. No retention or laceing. Aroma is of pumpkin and spices. Body is thin and fizzy. Taste is mostly pumpkin,with a bit of creamy spice. Very weak version of this style. Don't go out of your way to try this one."
"Sunset sky in color with light bubbly white head on top. Sweet aroma of pumpkin, spices, cinnamon, nutmeg, slight brown sugar, and oddly sea salt. Offensive flavors of nutmeg, salted veggies, hops, citrus, and lemon zest. Spritzy character similar to club soda and light in body. A pumpkin beer that doesn't taste like pumpkin. Someone broke in and tweaked the recipe or switched the bottling lines."
"Pours from the bottle a light orange color with an extremely minimal white head which quickly recedes. At first, this one smells somewhat like pumpkin pie, but the initial aromas fade rather quickly, leaving something akin to an average amber ale. On the palate, this one is fairly thin, with a little cinnamon, cardamon and clove. Decent at best"
"It's a nice copper color producing a decent amount of head that doesn't last too long. The aroma was some light malts and a bit of that oh-so-famous orange gourd. The taste was of pumpkin but it didn't have that """vegetable""" tinge to it so it was a bit sweeter than an actual pumpkin would be. With the sweeter taste it went down fairly easy and made for a good study beverage. I could go for this one again."
"Firm aroma is malty with an overtone of cinnamon and a strong hint of pumpkin. It pours a nice clear amber with minimal head or lacing. Malty flavor has a pumpkiny undertone and a hint of spice, mainly cinnamon. At least this pumpkin ale tastes more of ale than pumpkin! Fizziness is minimal - but this may be because this bottle was in the car for a couple days during hot Atlanta weather."
"Drinkable and for a pumpkin beer this will do in a pinch but there's better options out there."
"D: """America's original pumpkin ale""" or not, this beer is nothing to write home about. An OK pickup, but near the bottom of the pumpkin beer pack."
"Taste, lots of pumpkin, cinammon prolly some other Thanksgiving type of spice, nutmeg, s too. Very season in its feel. Big carbonation throughout. No hops. No bitterness. This is an Octoberfestish style of beer I can tolerate. I like the pumpkin. A little pricey though, I mean, no hops, no malt, pumpkins are dirt cheap . . . why is this 8-10 bucks a sixpack? Because of that, and the fact that its the kind of beer I don't want more than 12 oz of in a day, I docked some drinkability off of it."
"I wouldn't want to drink more than one although it isn't a horrible beer; just not a good pumpkin beer."
"D - This is one of the better session pumpkin ales. Easy to drink and tastes good."
"D: Pretty drinkable, I thought it could use a better mouthfeel but this was a nice beer nonetheless."
"Not too good. I was hoping it was going to be up there with the quality of their """Orange Blossom.""" But, no go. I don't particularly enjoy pumpkin, but I've had many other pumpkins that are very drinkable compared to this one."
"Buffalo Bill's Brewery--Independent Brewers United--America's Original Pumpkin Ale--Ale brewed with real pumpkin and natural spice flavor.--2010-B New Slanted Graphics 12 oz. Bottle. 5.20% ABV. 12 IBU's. (3.0 / 5.0) Thin no lace fizzy white head. Clear thin pumpkin gold color.Mellow pumpkin spice mild hop front. Thin fully fermented dry sweet rich pumpkin spice light caramel malt body. Mild hop spicy nutmeg dry clean end. Tasty lighter smoother than prior pumpkin brew, but still missing body. Sampled 9/10/2010. Purchased 6-Pack for $6.99 @ Fred Meyer--Ballard, Seattle 9/10/2010"
"It is very drinkable just not that enjoyable so it has to loose a little there."
"I have to wonder how different the bottle version is from the actual source. It has the bells and whistles for the style but the beer component struggles a bit."
"From the 2010 series. Sampled on September 8, 2010. The pour is a somewhat murky orange-copper with a short-lived two-inch head that dissolves to nothing. In the aroma I get a more malty, yeasty character with only a hint of spice and only a modest pumpkin scent. The taste tends to be a little sweeter than many with a subtle pumpkin taste and a fairly decent maltiness. Not one of the better pumpkin ales this season but somewhat easy (and quick) to drink."
"Drinkability: Not too good, mild flavors with an overwhelming amount of carbonation."
"d - Not a very good pumpkin ale. Thought the smell was lacking spices and pumpkin, and the taste had very little. Would not want to have again."
"Drinkability- very good, You can really taste the pumpkin. I enjoyed it very much. Definitely very good"
"D- Drinks easily enough. But nothing special here..."
"Not near as good as DFH Punkin or ST Pumking, but you get the feel of a fall brew without being over the top."
"Cheers to a great Autumn."
"D-Not something i will pick up again, i plan to drink them all (six pack) but its going to take a while, it might be good with a turkey dinner or used to cook with (hell, theres enough spices present, why not?)"
"Fairly drinkable. A little too watery for it style."
"Maybe not the best beer I ever had, but not the worst."
"D- I really appreciate a pumpkin ale with real pumpkin flavor, but this one just didn't have anything else going on. Couldn't finish this one."
"Overall, this one is in the middle of the pack for the pumpkin brews. Some brewers under do it, and others put pumpkin pie in a blender. This is in the middle of the pack. If you like a big sweet spicy one, this will seem underdone but more drinkable. If you are not fond of spiced beer, this will seem a bit sweet and too well seasoned. I think it is somewhere in the middle. Didn't hate it, but found it harder to drink as I continued thru to the end. One was enough."
"All in all it's not a bad beer but seeing the label as pumpkin ale I couldn't help but feel almost conned after tasting it. I did enjoy the aroma and flavours but to me it's just an almost above average beer"
"Thanks again to Market of choice for stocking this beer. The only thing that really impressed me about this beer is the aroma of pumpkin. Some people don't like pumpkin beers, but I try to not be so objective since they are around only a small part of the year, normally. There was some light carbonation bubbles painting to top of the glass, but no lacing whatsoever. I tried one of these, and that's about all i wanted. I'm looking forward to trying some other pumpkin beers later this year."
"D - Maybe one. Go ahead and taste one if you want but there are many better choices in this category."
"By far my favorite pumpkin beer. Actually taste like pumpkin pie and not beer with a hint of pumpkin like some other pumpkin beer. O'Fallon's is a distant second. Have tried Southern Tier Pumking, Shipyard's, Lakefront Pumpkin Lager, Post Road, Blue Moon, Jack's Pumpkin Spice and IMO it's the best!"
"D: Not awful, but not very beer like. Maybe okay to drink one or two around the holidays, but there are FAR better pumpkin beers and winter warmers available."
"I would not buy this again, even if it was on sale."
"(Served in Oct 2009)"
"Beer is thin and has almost no bitterness at all. Spices up front, carbonation in the mouth is fine. Drinkability is moderate, not really my favorite even pumpkin beer. I don't think I would drink it again."
"tastes like a first attempt at home brew, slightly sour yeast flavor, cloudy amber appearance, smells neutral to sour, not a beer I would drink again. even michelobs pumpkin beer is better. do not, do not buy this at any price, just isnt worth the tourble"
"Notes: The fake sweet flavor is a no-go and really ruins it. Pretty bad, actually, and only appropriate when organizing a fall/pumpkin beer tasting as I was."
"Shows a light orange in the glass with a white froth average head retention and decent lacing. Somewhat pronounced aromas of artificial """pumpkin flavoring", cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, & brown sugar. Sweet, but definitely artificial. Flavors of grains, light pumpkin flavoring, cinnamon, nutmeg, easy brown sugar....wow...let me go in for another drink....yep...that tastes pretty putrid! It's barley drinkable, so I can't give it the lowest score possible, but it's pretty bad. Overall....avoid this at all costs."
"Drinkability is possible, its just not my thing. The brew is a hint of the style, but mainly due to spice assocation, and not actual pumkin. Mediocre at best for light brew version of the pumpkin style."
"They call themselves America's original pumpkin ale but is it really since pumpkin ale has been brewed in America since the Pilgrims."
"The spices are very strong here and could easily get in the way of enjoying this beer. I like the style, though."
"Not horrible but not really good either. I'll stick to the Tazmanian Ale on future visits to Buffallo Bills. That one is at least tasty and pairs with the food well."
"Drinkability- It is very drinkable, but not something I would seek out."
"CHEERS!"
"D: Easy to drink sure enought, but just not very special at all."
"D- I would say this is an easy drinking beer at the least, would be a perfect introduction beer beyond BMC beers. Not very exciting though if you are not a beginner."
"drinkability: theres definitly better pumkin ales out there. worst of the batch I have ever had."
"D- Well whatever. There are enough pumpkin beers out there. This one is worth a shot, it is unique enough."
"I used to really look forward to buying this beer every Sept/Oct, but I can honestly say that this is the last year I'll be stocking up on it. Makes me wonder how bad the other pumpkin beers must have been for this Buffalo Bill's brew to have been my pick of the litter. As previously mentioned in regards to pumpkin beers, Dogfish Head's Punkin will fill my fridge for the foreseeable future."
"Not a great beer. Pretty drinkable with biscuity flavors, but the tough nose is a lot to get past."
"D - how this pumpkin soda passes for a beer is beyond me. avid this beer at all costs. don't even give it a try. drain poured after 3 sips...ugh!"
"This lacks the malt complexity I have come to expect in a craft made pumpkin ale. Overall a decent drinking beer, but not as nice as most craft brews. This may be the original, but it was not perfect from the get go. Despite the apparent bottle conditioning, this has a heavy handed level of carbonation that is too much for the light body. This has a few flaws, but pretty easy to drink without thinking about it much. This is a fair choice if you're looking to do a session of pumpkin ales."
"D- Not your best pumpkin ale out there, but by no means the worst...having tried it for the past few years, it definitely fluctuates with quality, but if you happen to stumble upon one of their better batches, its a very drinkable beer for the style..."
"D - Pass. I'm having trouble even finishing this one."
"Smells like it's going to be good. I can taste pumpkin, hazlenut, cinnamon, as promised, but seems more like a light beer -- not much beer flavor to it. It's like drinking Miller Light out of a pumpkin. I'd drink it again, but wouldn't buy it again. Might be good to suggest for someone who doesn't like beer. My girlfriend doesn't like beer, and she liked it because it tastes like pumpkin and not much like beer."
"I don't know, maybe this was meant to be drank out of the bottle for some reason. Smelled better out of the bottle than the glass, and it would actually be a good thing to lighten the flavor of this mess of a beer."
"Beer pours an orange-ish, copper colour with very little head, that dissipates almost as quickly as it forms. Smells like pumpkin pie, spices and nutmeg galore. Taste is finally something i can write home about. Unlike many pumpkin beers that deliver on smell but not on taste, this one is delicious. Pumpkin flavours really come through on this one, and leaves a wonderfully sweet aftertaste. Feels a little light, watery is probably too strong a word, but does not keep me too intrigued. Very high carbonation is also a little bothersome. Beer is very drinkable however, the sweet taste leaves you wanting more, and it goes down very smoothly. All in all this is easily the best pumpkin ale i have had yet. The poor reviews mostly seemed to centre around the sweetness of the beer, which is exactly what kept me intrigued. Too many Pumpkin ales taste simply like ales that smelled like pumpkins, but never delivered on the taste. This one gives you a sweet little treat, perfect for the thanksgiving season"
"Watery thin mouthfeel with medium carbonation. It's easy to drink and kind of refreshing but it seriously lacks any complexity."
"D - It's certainly an easy drinking pumpkin ale. Much better than I had expected but although they got the pumpkin and spice proportions right, the beer (malt and hops) isn't really there. Way too thin."
"NOTES: BBCSD-0909-PatrickM"
"Overall I don't get the low scores for this beer. Was it the be all, end all of pumpkins? No, but it was solid and enjoyable. It needed a bit more body and complexity, but it was an enjoyable drinker."
"d- very drinkable, not overly spiced, or pumpkiny for that matter, but still flavorful and enjoyable, i could have a few of these."
"D- With all the mixed reviews here, I gotta say this is in no means a good beer, but it's far from horrible. Let's face it, there are a lot of fishes in the sea when it comes to US pumpkin beers, with a lot of dead fish as well. If this did not have such a dead look and feel this could be a good contender for a sixer per season, for now i'll stick to my single."
"This beer goes down pretty easy if you are a fan of pumpkin beers. Not overly sweet or bitter with a manageable abv. I didn't think this was terrible, but it wasn't that good either."
"Drinkability is governed by how much of this thin stuff you can stomach. For me, one bottle was quite enough. Definitely will not be revisiting this particular pumpkin ale."
"This beer goes down easy. It's not too complex, not too sweet or bitter, and not too heavy. Yeah, it would be about as easy to drink a bunch of these as it would be to have a lot of Cokes. From what I've experienced of pumpkin beers, it's something of an accomplishment to be able to stomach even one, which is my justification of the just-above-average score on drinkability."
"All in all this is a pretty awful beer. It's interesting but not in a way most enthusiasts would find enjoyable. A huge dissapointment for me."
"D: It is somewhat drinkable, if you like watery soda-like beers."
"this is very similar to shipyard pumpkinhead... like a generic, overcarbonated, tasteless beer with spices added and a picture of a pumpkin on the label... really cheap ($1.49) but still not even worth the money"
"Overall: I think this beer was better than the other reviewers would have you believe. I have brewed beers with odd ingredients (what homebrewer hasn't added coffee or some honey to an otherwise boring recipe?) and I know how hard it is to get the formula right--treading the narrow path between what the palate expects and what the mind knows is possible. I think they get it just about right. Not the best beer in the world, but certainly better than some that take the safe path. I'll drink this again waiting for Halloween. Don't be afraid to try it!"
"Poured into my pint glass the beer is a cloudy yellow orange. I achieved a rather large amount of head with an agressive pour. The off white head faded almost instantly leaving no lace behind. The aroma is rather promising. Pumpkin spice is there. All the usual suspects; cinnimon,clove,nutmeg. It has an apple cider feel about it in the nose. The flavor is bitter pumpkin with a boat load of cinnimon and pepper. This is like a heffe experiment gone terribly wrong. I'm dreading takin the next couple drinks. I heard this was bad but, I just figured it was hyperbole. The body is light and this with a moderate carbonation. Overall this is not good. I can file this under never again in my book."
"D - Sugary, but oddly dry. The spice is relatively mild, but pretty bland and it contributes a bit of astringency. A pretty lackluster beer, I definitely didn't need more than one."
"Drinkability: Not a very impressive beer. While it has some decent pumpkin flavor, there is no accompanying spice to compliment it. Just an incomplete beer. I won't be reaching for this one again."
"D - An ok pumpkin ale. Looks like hell, smells fantastic, average in all other respects. Does go down nicely, however, and would pair great with some Thanksgiving leftovers."
"Notes: A bit mediocre and somewhat forgettable. It is not a horrible drinking experience but lacks much of anything to making it a mildly interesting pumpkin ale."
"Poured a golden amber, leaving a frothy head that quickly that quickly went away. Nose of cloves and nutmeg, exactly what a pumpkin beer should have, a good tasting seasonal brew, the flavours are more pronounced when the brew becomes room temp. This is one of the better pumpkin brews of this season."
"Mouth feel is very prickly/sharp on the carbonation (too carbonated for me). It is a very light-bodied ale. Overall, not my favorite."
"I just wasn't impressed by this beer. I picked it up in a mixed six pack, and I'm glad I didn't buy a full sixer. This just isn't my thing."
"The mouth is thin and lacking carbination. Weak. The flavor is weak as well. Some mild pumpkin and muted spiciness are there, but very mildly. This was a disappointment. Look for better pumpkin ales out there."
"- No head, but there is a bit of carbonation present when drinking... overall a very unique brew and it isn't bad. Just don't know if I would make it a regular buy every fall."
"I've been trying every pumpkin beer I can get my hands on this year and this one is in the upper middle of the pack."
"I did not taste any pumpkin flavors at all in this beer. By the end of the glass the copious amounts of nutmeg were starting to dry out and irritate my throat."
"D = Not a very drinkable beer."
"D- You could drink a few at 5.2% ABV. I will finish the 6-pack because the beer isn't horrible just not my favorite pumpkin ale."
"Drinkability: Meh. I will not pick this offering up again, but I'm glad to know that. So far in the taste test, Dogfish Head is leading the pack and that was a great offering, but this one falls short of decent."
"You might as well just buy a Bud, nothing to get excited about here, move along now."
"Pours a nice pumpkin orange color with some decent initial head; no lacing. Nice deep pumpkin scent, hints of the gourd itself with a nice pumpkin spice scent. Nice flavor; light malt sweetness with a hit of pumpkin spice up front and a bit of the pumpkin itself at the end. Goes down quite well, with a nice sparkling bit of carbonation. A very nice pumpkin ale."
"Drinking this one right now. Pours a cloudy orange color with think white head that dissipates very quickly and leaves no lacing. Also full of sediment. Smells like pumpkins. Tastes like pumpkin as well. A bit overcarbonated. Gonna take a while to finish this, unless I decide to just chug it to get it over with as quickly as possible."
"A 12 ounce bottle poured into a dimpled mug. The beer greets the eye a murky orange color with not even a finger of fizzy off white head that disappears within seconds. Nose and flavor are of muted spices, mainly nutmeg, faint hint of roasted pumpkin meat a trace of caramel. Where's the malt? Light bodied and slightly under carbonated. Not worth your time."
"I'm not too experienced with pumpkin ales and just saw this one on the shelf first and decided to try it. I'm sure many superior pumpkin ales can be found."
"Pours a somewhat opaque amber brown body. Small whitish head, quickly diminishing. Spicy aroma, some pumpkin. Some malty fruitiness. Graininess. Spice like nutmeg. Spicy taste, fruity, sweet spice like nutmeg. Maybe pumpkin. Mmm, a nice fall taste."
"Light body, watery mouthfeel with some astringency and a bitterness of spice left on the tongue. Alcohol is not noticable in any aspect of this ale. Not an easy beer to like."
"I really don't feel like finishing this one...(Drain Pour)"
"This starts out fairly refreshing but about halfway through it just gets old. The Bros review is severely outdated by now so I don't think """avoid""" is an appropiate thing to say but I would find maybe one bottle if I really wanted to try this and that would be the end probably for good. On the other hand, this is probably the most available pumpkin ale I've ever seen in Louisiana so if I ever had to have one I guess Buffalo Bill's might be as good as it will get."
"Out of a bottle this beer was a hazy, bright orange color with a towering, overzealous head. The retention of this massive four fingers of foam was only moderate however and the lacing weak. The aroma was of citrus hops, nutmeg and musty, damp malt. The flavors were odd, starting with pale malt followed by nutmeg and a slight sourness. The pumpkin only showed up for the finish and was underwhelming. The body was medium/light, the mouthfeel average and the carbonation good. Slightly too acidic for the style."
"Drinkability: I'd like to see less emphasis on spices and more on a heavier mouthfeel. The body is definitely lacking. I think I was pretty generous with my ratings as I won't be seeking this out in the near future."
"Notes from: 1/2/05"
"Easily drinkable but lacks much flavor. I would probably pass on this beer unless somebody gives it to me."
"Tastes like cloves. It's never been a huge ambition of mine to drink liquid cloves. Mouthfeel is sharp and tacky. If you're looking for a beer that tastes like cloves, this is it. If you're looking for a beer that's even slightly good, look elsewhere."
"D: Easy to finish a sixer and it's a nice Thanksgiving beer with company. Wouldn't buy again."
"Future outlook: Hmmmm...no thank you."
"D - Easy to drink and pretty enjoyable. Not awesome but not bad, wouldn't mind having one at Thanksgiving dinner."
"Pours the color of changing autumn leaves,orange with golden edges. Hard to stir up any head and a lack of lace leaves this less than impressive. The nose smells like cinnamon and dried flowers. I really hope this doesn't taste the way it smells...and it does,dammit. I cant help but think of potpourri the entire time that I'm drinking this. It isn't as offensive as it sounds,but it still isn't good either. The body is thin and overly carbonated,a touch of dryness on the tail is acceptable. This one won't be revisited anytime soon."
"This is one to avoid."
"I was expecting more from this beer, so I guess I'm a little disappointed. Compared to other pumpkin ale's I've had, this one really doesn't stack up too well. It's not awful, but I would definately turn it down if I had my choice of other similarly-styled beers. As with anything I don't like, I'm not going to let this impression spoil any future encounters with beers from this brewery."
"Taste: Pumpkin pie flavor, but it's more subdued than some other pumpkin ales. It still tastes like a beer where as other similar beers are like liquid pumpkin pie."
"Here's one that I will drink again, when I have the opportunity."
"mid body with not much carbonation. i probably would not buy this beer given a choice. they do a good job on flavor for the style though."
"Note! Ill try again just in case I got an old case. Ill update the review if I notice a difference."
"D: Low ABV but the spices are too much to make it very drinkable. Just not my cup of tea, I guess. Thanks anyway, Corey! I'm glad I got to try it."
"Not a very pleasant beer. There are many better pumpkin beers out there."
"Had a bottle on Halloween. Poured a hazy amber with a short head. The beer starts out with a big pumpkin pie flavor, heavy on the spice, with a slight sourdough tang in the background. The body is light-medium but the balance between the spices and malt are off, leaving an small, unpleasant tang in the aftertaste. Not bad, but there are better pumpkin options."
"D: didn't even finish it. Not worth the ABV."
"Not good. Least favorite pumpkin beer of the season. Don't bother."
"Pours a nice clear amber orange color with 2 fingers of fiizzy cream colored head. OK retention and minimal lacing. Smells of cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg, brown sugar, bread, and a touch of pumpkin. Tastes of cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg, clove, and other spices up front, then a touch of brown sugar and light caramel mixed with grainy malts. Finish is a bit souring and citrusy. Light in body with strong carbonation. A good amount of spices, but lacking a solid malt backing, but a nice tart finish. A satisfactory pumpkin ale, at least worth picking up one bottle every season."
"Verdict: I find this beer bland, and that it really fails to deliver on its biggest promise: pumpkin. But, I can certainly see it's appeal to the masses and therefore why it's become so popular. Pumpkin Ale is an appealing premise for the Fall months and this beer, being on the thinner and sweeter side, is not too much of a deviation from the regular macro fare. For the more traveled drinker, however, much more complicated and satisfying Pumpkin Ales can easily be found."
"D - Good beer, one of the better pumpkin ales."
"I really did not find this beer to be very pleasurable to drink. The flavor, while fine if eating a desert, is not really something I look for in a beer. It was overly sweet and really not much of any beer taste. Seriously, it was almost like drinking a pumpkin pie smoothie."
"Waaaay too much cloves taste in this beer. Every fall I look forward to drinking a few new pumpkin ales, but this stuff just sucks. I finished the bottle 30 minutes ago and I can still taste the cloves. A """hint""" of spices? My big-fat-hairy-beer-drinkin' ass."
"Hey, it's easy to drink because there ain't much to it. Last one for me. I'll stick with my thick St. Louis pumpkin ales, Schlafly and O'fallon, please."
"Drinkable, but overall a huge disappointment from the original pumpkin ale, lacking in the proper characteristics particular to the best examples of the style."
"Notes: I enjoy pumpkin ales, but some of them are truly bad, and this is one. Glad I only bought the single. I can't imagine that any brewery can continue to sell this to anyone."
"Overall this is one of the best pumpkin beers I've had and well worth seeking out. Good stuff."
"The taste is similare, light cooked pumpkin, orange zest, hint of cinnamon, mineral water taste and feel, finish of a little pumpkin mixed with grain and grass. It's light and spritzy, on the sweet side. It's hardly great, but it's pretty good and easy to drink."
"d. Definitely not the worst of the pumpkin ales i've had the pleasure and pain of sampling, but i can't say I'd have one any time soon. It had been a few years (three or four) since I'd had the pleasure of sampling Buffalo Bill's delight, and as I rememberd from the past, it's nothing worth getting excited about. Many better pumpkin ales, and many better ales that aren't pumpkin. Nothing really worth seeing here... even if you like pumpkin ales."
"overall, not a great beer, but I did not find it as terrible as some of the previous raters did. Maybe it's my limited experience with Pumpkin ales, or maybe I'm just in a good mood, but definitely not something you need to go out and buy right now. If it is already in your fridge, dont need to necessarily throw it out, but definitely not something I will buy for myself."
"What the hell is this? Pumpkin is a rich, sweet creamy flavour. Pumpkin with pie spices even more so. This is watery insipid and bland. I said some even more flagrant things in my original review - suffice it to say I was incredibly disappointed with my first example of Pumpkin Ale."
"Overall, one of the easiest and most drinkable pumpkin beers I've ever had. Definitely good for sessioning."
"Pumpkin ales are not my favorite to begin with, but there are much better examples of this style on the market... for example, Southern Tier & DFH!"
"D - With all it's flaws, it's not a difficult beer to drink and the spice profile is slightly interesting. A poor example of the style, but thankfully not all that offensive."
"I've read some other reviews that make it sound like previous years were better, so here's to hoping they turn things around and get things going in the other direction. That said, they need to just scrap whatever they're using for that pumpkin flavoring."
"Pours a murky orangish gold in color. Only a little froth on the pour, other than that, no head at all. Smell is slight pumpkin, but lots of spice and a whole lot of lager notes. Taste is smoked pumpkin. There are some definite smoky notes that I don't quite understand. Lots of carbonation and prickliness in the mouthfeel. Being a pumpkin beer, there are still a bunch of other pumpkin beers I'd take over this."
"This one says on the bottle that it is brewed by Pyramid Brewing. Not a very attractive beer, with little head and absolutely no lacing, but not a bad deep reddish orange color. The nose is the best feature, hinting of a pumpkin aroma. Lots of carbonation, actually too much, keeps this from being as drinkable as it could be. The flavor is slightly pumpkin blended with a wheat malt on the palate. Just a touch of bittrness on the rather clean finish. Thin mouthfeel, reasonably refreshing, but not a beer I would rush out to buy again."
"The pour was standard, light amber, and the smell a hint, and only a hint, of fall spices -- clove, nutmug, pumpkin. The taste...not so good. Over carbonated, bland. Like the flavor was an afterthought. Bummer. I would not buy this again."
"Pours pure copper to a small and active head that fizzles like soda. Quickly dissipates with no trace and no lacing. Smell is a combination of herbs and spices, reminds me of one of those antique stores run by somebody's grandma. Taste is more spicy than pumpkiny, however there is a predominance of acidity that is just too uncomfortable to deal with. Mouthfeel is thin and metallic, not anywhere near the robustness I had expected. All in all, I'm thoroughly unimpressed with this beer. I won't buy it again and I don't recommend it."
"Pours copper orange and clear into a pint glass, with miniscule head that dissipates rapidly, although some carbonation is active in the glass. Aroma is minimal with traces of cloves, orange, and pumpkin. Mouthfeel is appropriately light and sandpaperish from the medium carbonation. Taste is watery and thin, spice, pumpkin hints, but seems to dissipate towards the finish. Spice seems a little off balance, not enough pumpkin to round it out. Slight hop impression in the finish. Overall this beer is fair, moreso as it warms."
"	I'll be reviewing several pumpkin ales tonight. I stopped by the Headkeeper on the way home and decided to stock up. The first one is Buffalo Bill's Pumpkin Ale. I tried it last year and found it pretty enjoyable. I poured a 12 oz. bottle into my tasting snifter. I was crystal clear and ruby orange. There was a creamy white head that gradually dissipated. The aroma had hints of pumpkin spices, cinnamon, cloves and allspice. There was a good bit of carbonation, and the flavor was good, more pumpkin spices, but not much of an aftertaste. I don't really know what all has changed with this beer from last year, maybe my tastes have matured, but I doubt I'll be pulling another one of these off the shelf."
"Lose some of that carbonation, Bill. Maybe try using some actual pumpkins next time (perhaps take a few notes from Dogfish Head's brew). Also, please spare our tongues and ease up on that spice, guys."
"D: Not drinkable, I will not be having again and I've officially written Buffalo Bill's from the list as I didn't care for the Orange Cream ale. Too bad the beer didn't taste as good as it smells."
"I'm glad I found this in single bottles because I wouldn't have drank a sixer. Not terrible, but not something I would have again either."
"As with nearly all flavored beers, it's a decent taste but nothing I'd want to drink on a regular basis."
"2.5/3/2/2.5/2.5"
"D- Well, about average. There's much better and much worse out there."
"Skip this one."
"D: It came as part of a """Winter Pack""" along with 9 others - the other offerings seem a little more promising, but this one was not something I'd really look to drink again."
"I wouldn't drink this. And if it was a part of a mixed pack, I'd seriously consider the value of the pack as distributed across the pack minus one beer since this beer is only going to be poured out or given away."
"D: Ok by style and ok drinkability but much better examples and one I wouldn't bother to have a second."
"1""" off-white head that fell quickly to a cap. No lace. Orange with gold highlights. Smells like pumpkin, fresh nutmeg, clove, cinammon, and big red chewing gum. Flavors are much like the nose...lots of cinnamon (spicy), sweet pumpkin pie. Thin body with high carbonation. Maybe once a year...I guess that is what it is for anyway."
""
"Maybe it was the 2007 batch. But I probably won't try more unless someone else is buying."
"D: A realy bad beer-- and by bad, I mean bad, not good."
"Expected so much more from this beer. Well, not much more, but better than this. It poured a apple-cider looking body with an extreme amount of carbonation, too much in fact. Had a huge, foamy and rocky head that took a few minutes to die down. Took a nice whiff and was greeted with a faint, weak pumpkin smell. Not much else at all. The spices don't mix well at all, and the carbonation overpowers anything resembling pumpkin. In terms of pumpkin taste, this tastes like pumpkin pie with a blackened pie crust. The backbite is awful considering this beer's style, leaving a dry, unpleasant finish. There is no need for someone to try this if they haven't, but I was given the samae advie and didn't heed it. Should've just wiped my ass with the $2 I bought this for."
"I'm not really going to waste my time on a full review on this beer as I really don't feel it deserves one. I picked this up at Bevmo a few months ago hoping it would be decent at best. It's not. Even this bottle I let age for 5 additional months is not any better. The spices don't work - in fact they taste 'seperated' from the rest of the beer. Where's the pumpkin??? Tastes like they poured in a bunch of spices w/o worry about how overwhelming the spice is. The beer portion of this tastes bland and boring. Not recommended."
"D-not as bad as I thought given many of the reviews I read. Maybe they changed the recipe this year. It's about an average pumpkin, which means one is nice, then I move on."
"Saw this for the 1st time in the area yesterday and decided to pick it up. Clear medium to dark orange color with light head. Smell is nicely aromatic pumpkin and spices and is very pie like. Flavor is nicely of pumpkin, with a solid spiced flavor in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is somewhat thin, and average. Nothing too outstanding, but I find this to be a pretty decent pumpkin beer all around. I'd prefer a touch more sweetness, but as it stands, its ok."
"This beer pours very little head and what's there dissipates quickly. It is very light and refreshing with some sweetness and obviously pumpkin, but very mild doses of both and an even more subtle hint of cinnamon. It finishes clean. By itself it was underwhelming but I can imagine it would be great paired with spicy food or on a hot day."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It leans medium bodied. Carbonation is okay and it's fairly smooth. Drinkability is average due to the spice overload. No more than one in a sitting for me. Overall, it's average. No more, no less."
"Pours a slightly orange amber with a quick-fading head. Aroma is unbalanced pie spices with little malt or other aroma. Flavor is pretty neutral, a little malt with the allspice on top of it, no hop flavor detectable, there's a little vegetal taste that might be the pumpkin, hard to tell, really. The slightly lighter-than-average body would be fine if it weren't for the near lack of any flavor of interest to make you want a second serving. Is this a bad beer? Not really, I've had far worse, but there are better beers to be had for the money, even in the rather limited field of pumpkin spice beers."
"Drinkability: Ok, but there are better pumpkin ales out there."
"From notes off the 2006 production. Pours crystal clear and orange hued with a one finger head that drops while leaving no lace. The nose is spiced, kind of like pumpkin pie. Maybe a little bit like sweet potato pie too. On the palate it is thick, full, and lasting. You definitely get some pumpkin on there, but more so I think, that spice that you got on the nose. Sure its a novelty seasonal, but it is a pretty interesting brew. For a few sips it was cool, and then the spice got to be too much and I couldnt finish the bottle. If I drank a third of it, thats it."
"Mouth feel is fine if you can stand the bad taste, and I guess it is easily drinkable if you like drinking bad beer that has the taste of a truck stop pumpkin pie."
"Edit: Ok, a few sips more and I can't bring myself to finish this. This is a bad beer."
"First beer from this brewery, not bad but not great either, recommended above some pumpkin beers but not the best and does not hold a candle next to Alpine's Ichabod"
"Didn't seem as bad as the first time I tried it. This time around I found it to be a reasonably pleasant seasonal brew, funny how tastes can change. I could have this with Thanksgiving/Christmas dinner quite easily. Not great but not bad at all."
"Drinkability: Interesting, but not something I would make a habit of."
"Light body, and a bit watery. This isn't the absolute worst, but really not very good."
"That's all I have to say as this beer is a dumper."
"Some pumpkin-type smell, along with a touch of cinammon. Good flavor, well balanced. Malty, with a teaser of pumpkin. Nothing overly spicy or artificial. A solid pumpkin ale. One of the better examples I have tried. A good one for a newbie to the style. Sorry, still doesn't compare to last year's Propeller Pumpkin."
"Drinkability, not so good, for me. I got this six pack as a gift a month ago, and there are still four in the fridge. I don't think this is a bad beer by any means, if you like pumpkin beer. It's just not my cup of tea."
"Nothing above and beyond, but worth a go if you're a fan of pumpkin ales..."
"Enjoyed this bottle quite a bit, very good pumpkin ale, better than others I've tried"
"Nasty stuff here. It's the """original""" that has been outdone by many. Pass on this one - a medicinal/herbal mess."
"Not a bad beer overall. If I'm feeling like I want a malty beer, I will definitely get this one again."
"When it was poured from the bottle into the pint glass, it had a dark gold color with a small tan head. The aroma was full of spices. I don't know if it's me, but I always get a bubble gum aroma with pumpkin beers. Anyway, its flavor had all the desirable qualtites of a pumpkin ale except, I found it finished a little light and dry. May be a higher terminal gravity would leave more residual sugar giving some more mouth-feel and a sweeter finish."
"This was my first pumpkin ale. In retrospect, I'm not sure if what I was finding off-putting was the specific beer, or just the style; but the balance just felt off."
"D- Good beer for Halloween due to the novelty factor and that is not a terrible beer. Not a great beer for a hard core beer drinker or one that does not like fruit / vegetable beers, but all in all a good beer to drink every so often."
"Drinkability- Easy to drink and a good seasonal but not something I would want year round."
"Drinkability- Not as complex as other pumpkin brews, but still a decent one none the less."
"Unspectacular. My local bottle shop was out of Elysian Pumpkin Ale, so I sprung for a couple bottles of Buffalo Bill's to give a try. Taste is like Alka-Seltzer cold tablets, with a little bit of spice. Pumpkin flavor? Hardly noticeable. The Pumpkin ale genre is not flush with notable entries, but this one should certainly be avoided..."
"This beer is very fun especially (but only) during these fall months. It has a warm spice (clove like) flavor with pumpkin undertones. It is not overly spicy and doesn't have a nasty after taste like some other pumpkin ales. The spice works well with the sweet pumpkin taste, kind of like a pumpkin pie beer. One thing to note is that your taste buds get tired of this beer quick. Its great to try but maybe only one or two at a time and have one of your favorite brews ready to follow it up. Try some while carving a pumpkin or between handing out candy to kids on halloween."
"Felt thin on the palate. Drinkability is OK. Not a very great beer."
"Finish again was astringent and bitter. Not gonna be back in the household anytime soon. Better than just a couple mass produced pumpkin beers."
"D: It's possible to drink a few of these alright, but not if you're looking for taste. This pumpkin ale has a flash-in-the-pan spice taste, and very little pumpkin as well. Tastes watered down and near flavorless, so I'd opt for another pumpkin if you're looking for a better interpretation."
"All I tasted and smelled was cloves, cloves, and more cloves. This was the typical overkill of spices that really hurt this beer."
"Drinkability is great. Maybe it's just the time of year, but this beer is damn tasty. I will probably finish this sixer tonight or at the latest tomorrow. Very good, highly surprised. I will pick this up again if I can find it for cheaper"
"Comment: After weighing the virtues of being honest versus blowing some smoke to maintain peace in the work place I decided my co-worker deserved the truth. Just as love (and/or a half-rack of macro lager) can cloud ones vision, I believe his taste buds were tainted by a layer of lust that gave this brew a boost in his esteem proportionate to the boost in his libido generated by his association with his new """friend.""" I hope beer helps keep them together but I pray their relationship, as well as their taste buds, mature."
"D - This is a pretty good pumpkin ale. Not the best, but certainly better than others."
" Overall I was very impressed. I have never like pumpkin brew, but now I realize I may have just been trying the wrong ones as this was great. I will really go out of my way now to try and find some more I like before the season is over. Really an outstanding light selection here and something that could easily be a good fall session brew. Look out for this if its around and give it a shot."
"The drinkability is pretty low if you like beer. As far as a pumpkin pie seltzer, in spite of the heaviness of the spices, the taste vanishes so abruptly that I can't really complain. Wait, I can, and I am. This beer sucks!"
"Semi-dry finish with a soda-like carbonation. Easy to drink but only an average pumpkin ale heavy on spice."
"The label describes this beer as """ale brewed with real pumpkin and spices""". Now that might be true, but to me it tasted like """seltzer water with pumpkin extract and orange coloring""". Okay, so this was my first pumpkin beer, but this sample was awful. One of the worst beers I've had the dishonor of trying."
"D: Easy to drink, a tasty beer, would be great for a Halloween party, a few tweaks could make this beer great, it almost feels like a rough draft, a first brewing for what could be a really spectacular beer, still it is a fun beer to drink, it really goes for this pumpkin spice flavour, which I feel is different from a lot of the pumpkin ales out there which taste like an amber ale, mixed with a bit of pumpkin spice, so this is something that I will continue to buy each October that it comes out."
"With a heavier mouthfeel, way less hops, and a bit less carbonation this beer could have been wonderful."
"Overall: If you like pumpkin beers you'll like this one. It's a decent brew, but at the same time there's nothing spectacular about it. Stil, given that it was the first of its kind it's rather impressive. I'll drink one of these each year in the fall as a form of respect to one of my favorite beer styles, but other than that I'm not going out of my way for this one."
"It comes in black and orange festival label with no freshness date. It also doesn't say what spices are used. The smell is pretty aromatic with nutmeg and pumpkin hitting your nose the second it is poured. It is a low carbonated beer that finished on the front of the tongue with the pumpkin, nutmeg and ginger flavor. It is very light and very little hoppiness. This is the first pumpkin ale so after the season I will come back and decide again."
"Not necessarily a bad drink. It's refreshing, but not tasty. Still, I don't plan on purchasing this again."
"This was a good pumpkin beer that I'd recommend and I would for sure drink this again."
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a slightly hazed brownish amber color with a thin fizzy head that completely disapears within a few seconds. The aroma is mostly holiday spices with just a touch of malt. The taste features just a touch of pumpkin flavors with spices that finishes pretty watery. The mouthfeel is thin and watery with soda-like prickly carbonation. Overall, this is just not a very good brew. It seems to be thrown together into quite a mess. Not recommended."
"It's the light pumpkin charlie brown. pumpkin see threw orange miller. Tastes big at first sip but weakens with each successive. Smells a little like pumpkin pie, you do not have to respect the authority of this beer. But it will wet your whistle to the pumpkin season."
"Pours a clean, pale yellow/ orange-sh color with an off white head. Aromas of all spice, cinnamon and brown sugar. In the taste, pumpkin, a small spice, and a bit watery in the taste. A small bitterness and a watery mouthfeel, with a small spicy aftertaste. OK beer, but kind of watery, aroma was a bit misleading as to taste."
"Buffalo Bill's had a nice balanced taste and I feel is under-rated by the crowds here at BA."
"Overall: A noble effort at mass marketing a novelty/seasonal beer to masses. I couldn't honestly drink too many of these."
"Drinkability- Well with my inexperience with Pumpkin Beers I cant really compare this with any other beer. Its a different drinking experience and really puts you in the Halloween/Thanksgiving spirit. I couldnt have more than maybe two of these little guys but definitely worth a try. Happy Fall!"
"It pours out like a flat pop. Nice dark bronze orangey color but no head to speak of. Pretty flat. It smells pretty good... Like pumpkin spice and nutmeg. It smells like a pumpkin pie. It tastes similar but I think it smells better than it tastes. It's kind of flat and watery in the mouth. Not much carbonation. It's an OK beer for around halloween time as a novelty."
"d - awful. not enjoyable at all and i almost poured it down the drain."
"I've had some decent pumpkin ales. This isn't one of them. Hazy dark orange color with a medium white head that quickly disappears. Very spicy aroma, mostly clove. The taste is spice, a little pumpkin (although I think that's stretching it). Very muted. I could drink one or two of these, but I'd have to feed the rest to someone else."
"Well it's that time of year again... Every brewery and their brother has to put out a Pumpkin Ale in a pretty orange and black bottle with jack-o-lanters all over it... In the case of Buufalo Bill's, they are nice looking bottles; and that's where it ends... Poured a cloudy darkish orange with a fizzy head that literally dissappeared instantaneously... Smelled like the usual suspects; clove, nutmeg, allspice... Tasted like pumpkin pie spices as well, but with an underlying sickly sweetness that laid on my tongue like a wet blanket... Mouthfeel was perhaps the worst aspect of this tasting; thin, soda like carbonation and that cloying aftertaste/feel made for a truly unremarkable and unenjoyable beer experience... If anyone wants five of these things, stop by soon, or they're going the way of last night's dinner scraps..."
"Drinkability: Well, it's not horrible. But it's not great either."
"This beer poured an orange color with a rocky head. The smell is initially strong of pumpkin with spice aromas lingering afterward. The taste is sweet and very spicy  definitely a pumpkin flavor. The mouthfeel is full and seems appropriate. This is an interesting beer that definitely imparts a spicy pumpkin flavor, but that might be a bit much to be considered easily drinkable."
"* I would highly recommend the Dog Fish Head though. It is really great and very complex."
"Drinkability- Not a horrible beer. I can taste the pumpkin more in this beer than any other I've tried. I couldn't drink a whole bunch of these though. Too sweet."
"Drank pretty darn good for the style. I'm of the opnion that Pumpkin ales are better with more guts & abv for starters, so I'm suprised this scored as high as it did. This kicked the crap outta pumpkihead for sure. Try it, if you like this style, otherwise try it if your just curious like me, cheers!"
"D: tough to drink due to wateriness and light over all flavors"
"This is about what I would expect for a pumpkin beer. It has pumpkin color (no pumpkin head), it has a strong pumpkin pie smell to it, it has pumpkin taste to it. As much as I love pumpkin pie, a hint of pumpkin does not do much to make an average beer better."
"Edit: I'm editing this review....I've tried the Dogfish Punkin' Ale and have to say this is much better. Up'd the score to reflect my liking of this beer increasing"
"C"
"Could be more drinkable if one was fond of pumpkin ales. I've had worse, notably Blue Moon."
"Overall, I enjoyed the beer, but don't know if I could handle many more. The aroma was probably the most interesting part of the beer."
"I was lucky enough to be in a food-pairing mood with this beer; I had some jalapeno cheese on crackers while drinking it. The cheese's hot spiciness complemented the nutmeg and clove characters of the beer, but I can't imagine drinking this beer without accompaniment. Have it with Thanksgiving dinner or don't have it at all, basically."
"It also gave me a headache on the 2 separate nights I drank it. I do not appreciate being given a headache. Bad beer."
"Drinkability: I am fine with going the spice route for pumpkin beer, but you need an underlying malt base to support it. Ift his beer had better malt undertones, it would be good. However, it doesn't and once the initial wham of the spices wears of, it is just sweet water."
"Beer poured an amber-orange with a thin white head. Nose is interesting, full of cloves and allspice. Taste is more than a subtle hint of those spices with a light hop presence. Mouthfeel is average, with a fairly light body but it is fairly lively on the palate. Overall drinkability is average. It is not a bad beer as it is refreshing me after a long day of toiling in the office jungle but I sense the spices will be overwhelming with round 2."
"Overall, the thin body and slightly medicinal quality turned me off. This isn't a bad beer, but it doesn't wow, by any means."
"Poured an orange-gold into the sample glass, very little head, but I won't count that against it given the sample size. Aroma was clove and cinnamon, with elements of mint or bubble gum in there. Not much pumpkin in the flavour, but HUGE clove presence, nutmeg, and an unpleasantly spicy aftertaste. Didn't like it, but this is not one of my favourite styles."
"Translucent pumpkin orange. No head, but a little white ring around the glass. Smells like a pumpkin pie, very fragrant. Initial pumpkin taste with a little clove aftertaste. Very light, but fantstic. Very light mouthfeel, also very smooth. Nice drinkability, especially for the holidays. Best pumpkin beer i've had so far."
"Pours to a thin white head that dies out in a few minutes. Orange-amber color and medium carbonation. Aroma is very spice-dominant with a little sweet malt coming in behind it. Flavor is also loaded with pumpkin pie spices and a bit of malt sweetness to accompany it. Finishes with residual spices and graininess. It's kind of nice as a novelty but not a year-round beer."
"This is definitely not a sit on the porch and drink a few bottles. It is a """must consume with food""" beer. It's a great complement with holiday foods, from salty sausage stuffing to pumpkin pie with whip cream. Turkey and gravy, ham with a honey glaze. You get the picture. This is a seasonal beer afterall. If you haven't tried it, or even if you have, try it during the next holiday season with the foods of Thanksgiving or Christmas. It'll be worth the wait."
"I decided to check this out because there was an excellent deal at the local Albertson's; I worked there, so I knew it hadn't been on the shelf that long. $3 for a whole six pack. Knowing what I know now, I probably wouldn't purchase it under any other circumstances."
"This would be the worst seasonal I've tried to date. It smells pretty decent, lots of cinnamon and pumpkin aromas. Pours an orangish color with some lighter tones to it, a little cloudy and very little head. Taste is way too overbearing. Lots of spice but doesn't work well together. Attempting a pumpkin pie taste, but they ended up with a mishap IMO. I wouldn't recommend this."
"Poor ending aside, this is indeed a solid pumpkin beer, and the spiciness does grow on you. I wish more brewers would try changing things around with this style, as it tends to get pretty bland."
"Picked up a six at World Market in Greenville, SC for $3.99. Pours a pretty orange amber color with a thin head. Clove and nutmeg dominate the nose with a little cinnamon and pumpkin in the background. Taste is dominated by nutmeg to the point of being overbearing. Mouthfeel is a little on the thin side. One would be OK as a single after dinner drink. Definately not a session beer for me. Buffalo Bill needs to lighten up on the nutmeg next year."
"I've had this in previous years and enjoyed it much less. This year's offering is noticeably improved. Smell and taste are of candy-ish pumpkin and some nutmeg. Taste also reveals a slight fruitiness, hinting that real pumpkin may have been used in brewing. Mouthfeel suffers a high carbonation level that seems out of place. Quite drinkable, and a nice early winter treat. A friend brought a six pack to a party, and I'll be happy to drink the left-overs."
"This brewery apparently has been craft brewing before the recent explosion and so is worth a try on that basis alone. Greg, crwills brought this one and thanks. Cinammon and nutmeg is pronounced in a lager, orange with a white head. Astringent and fizzy carbonation."
"A very flat pour, plain orange in colour, slightly hazy. Aroma super strong in clove especially, with lesser notes of basil, nutmeg, and typical pumpkin pie spices. Mouthfeel a little overly sweet, cloying in many regards. Taste is dominated by cinnamon mostly, again with light pumpkin flavour. Lots of spice but little else behind it, no hops and far too little malt to keep it standing. I coudl still enjoy it but not recommended."
"drinkability is not great either. i'm really not a fan of pumpkin beers, but i think this one is my least favourite."
"Cheers!"
"This beer is just delicious! I always look forward to this one during the fall season. Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a pint glass. The beers appearance is deep orange, with a good 1/2 inch head, but faded quickly, leaving slight lacing along the glass. The aroma is all spices, mostly dominated by the cinammon, and a little nutmeg. The mouthfeel is thin, just making this beer that much easier to drink. The taste is great!! Cinammon again dominates the flavor of this beer, with a hint of the other spices in the back. No pumpkin taste to speak of, but once you get past that, this is a very tasty beer. Too bad this is only a fall release. Also a great beer to serve to those that dont normally drink beer, during holiday gatherings."
"D - Glad I bought this as a single bottle as I'm not sure I'd really want another. If there's no better pumpkin ale avaiable, I guess this is worth picking up if you're desperate for some themed holiday beer."
"Cheers."
"Didn't find this to be up to New Hollands standards."
"Drinkability suffers greatly with the off-putting amount of spicing used in this beer. Not recommended...don't buy it!"
"This pumpkin ale is drinkable, but dissapointing. I will drink the sixer I bought, but most likely won't buy it again. I think that it could and should be more."
"This brew pours a copper coulour and sprouts a beige head that is quite fizzy and fleeting. It is fairly rich in carbonation and leaves no lacing behind. The nose is just as spicy as spices. It has a little crusty breadiness and some pumpkin to it, but it smells mainly of pepper, nutmeg, cloves and things of that spicy nature. The taste just slaps pepper across my mouth and then a smattering of nutmeg and cinnamon and cloves and potpourri before the malt and pumpkin flavours come in. I have no idea which spices are used in this concoction so my previous mentions are merely stabs in the dark. It is spiced up for sure. No doubt. The mouthfeel is light. Granny could deal with this before she inhales some turkey legs at Thanksgiving. She can have all of em if she feels so inclined because this is the last one I am ever drinking. I usually only drink one bottle of this style per year and this is not my favorite version. Not a bad beer. Just a bit spicy for me and short on the pie aspects and the pumpkin which are the best parts for me. Worth a try just for the seasonal pleasure of it."
"compared to other pumpkin beers ive tried...below average."
"Overall, when compared to other pumpkin ales I've tried, this one just didn't hold up. I wouldn't recommend this."
"Drinkable, not too heavy, nice at a holiday meal or sitting around in the evening."
"I was at the beer store and I purchased the pumpkin ale or should I say Spice ale. I poured the bottle into a frosty mug and it came out a nice amber copper tone. The smell is very strong with hints of cinnamon, pumpkin and various other spices. The taste of the beer was ok; I guess the only problem with the beer is that its only good for a couple of sips before the spices really start to mess with your mouth. Overall its a nice beer to try but I strongly don't recommend drinking a whole 6pack like I did."
"This is a drinkable beer, but more of a spice ale than a pumpkin. I think there are better pumpkin ales. It's a nice seasonal ale, and would be a good holiday choice as well. I wouldn't want to drink much of this on a regular basis"
"D - I have come to like pumpkin beers in the fall and this is one I will not be trying again. It was way too heavy on the allspice and it would be tough to drink more than one."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle with no date. Bottle notes that brewed under contract with Pyramid. Had a large head to quickly dissappeared. Also had a ton of carbonation. Smell was mainly of nutmeg with some pumpkin and other spices. The taste was again mostly nutmeg and a little pumpkin. Had average mouthfeel. Overall, an OK have once a year maybe kind of beer but nothing special. Worth trying but mainly just to mark off the list. (2.0, RB, ML, N)"
"Light-bodied with decent carbonation. Highly drinkable, but a little too much spice for a session beer. In all I don't think this is a bad first taste of a pumpkin ale, though I think a little heavier malts would be a good thing. Pleasant but not particularly impressive.. I'd recommend to anyone looking for something different."
"Notes: This is more like the pumkin pie crust with brown sugar on top. It was drinkable although that doesn't say much considering I've yet to drain a beer. This is novelty beer and brewed as such."
"This beer starts out so much better than it finishes. Pours to a copper color with white head that dissipates quicklly to leave nothing. Wonderful aroma of spices, mostly cinnamon and nutmeg, with a touch of clove. Upon initial sips, the flavor follows the aroma. Very quickly, however, this taste is offset by the watery finish and bitter pumpkin aftertaste. No alcohol makes itself known, so the final result is a less than memorable end to a beer that started out so promising."
"12 oz bottle poured into an Imperial pint glass. A clear amber orange color. Fizzy looking head that quickly disappears, no lacing. Smell is spicy with cinnamon, all-spice, and pumpkin. Taste follows strongly plus a sweet maltiness. Mouthfeel is a bit on the light, I would have preferred a creamier mouthfeel. I have enjoyed this beer, and as I worked my way through the six pack this month, I think it has grown on me. The last one was definitely better than the first."
"not a very pretty beer. a little too light in color and the head deminished almost immediately. aroma is very light, but it's malty and there is a hint of pumpkin and spices. first flavor is astringent and watery. there is some malty sweetness hiding and a light spicy clove and cinnamon. maybe some ginger. pumpkin tastes kind of soured. way too crisp and biting mouthfeel. this along with the astringency makes this beer taste cheap. a little difficult to finish at first, but calms down about half way. not a very good pumpkin ale even with a slice of pumpkin pie to compliment."
" D- Easy to drink, with a clean crisp taste. Overall a good beer."
"After trying it on tap at the brewery, I had to go out and get the bottled version. Bottled by the Portland Brewery in OR, hmmmm, so I wonder if the draft version is the same as the bottled? They taste nearly identical, but I think the draft had more pumpkin essence, less spice, a bigger maltier body, and a hoppier bite. The bottled version isn't bad, but lacks a certain extra punch. All that aside, the marriage of pumkin and hoppy full-bodied ale is made in heaven, truly a perfect pairing. A great way to get into the fall spirit. There are other pumpkin ales out there, some may be better, but this one is still very worthy and would make a great fall tradition in my glass. Cheers!"
"Is this pumpkin taste real? I have no idea! Ignorance is bliss I did a little exploring of thier site and they use real roasted pumpkin, so that changes my perspective a little."
"A clear pumpkiny amber with light bubbling. Crappy soap foam head. No retention. No lacing. A very soapy, bloody, spicey pumpkin mix greets the nostrils. Plenty of powdery pumpkin pie spices hit the tongue with the first sip. As the beer warms, the more harsh flavors mellow out a little and the malty pumkin-ness inches closer towards center stage on my tongue."
"This isn't bad, but it should be called cinnamon ale, not pumpkin ale. The one thing this brew has going for it is the smell....it smells great, but tastes fake and candy-like as if some syrupy candy additive was added to the brew."
"D- While not overtly offensive, not particularly good either. I bought a six pack and will drink it, but will not be purchasing this again. there are much better pumpkin ales out there."
"It takes a lot for a pumpkin ale to standout because the style is to beer what candy corn is the candy industry: it only comes out in the fall, everybody makes their own non-distinct version, and when it first comes youre exited because you think Hmm, havent had this in a while, I bet itll be good. And it is, which leads you consume a lot of it during the season, so much in fact that you eventually get sick of it and dont miss it until it returns en masse next fall. So, as much as I like Pumpkin ales, I find hard to get too exited about them, nor do I usually have any thing really great to say about them, even though I drink loads of the stuff when the season comes around. But this one does stand out and I do have something nice to say about: not only is a smooth, solid example of the style, but unlike so many other pumpkin ales (even the superb ones) its excellent ginger flavor comes trough very nicely. Recommended."
"I'm not a big fan of pumpkin beers. I can't really tell why one would bother. However, this one was able to hold the distinct flavor while not being annoying in any way."
"D - It's novelty wears off pretty fast...I don't think I could drink a lot of these."
"Served in a pint glass the beer pours an orange/amber color, with a good sized white head which goes away very quickly. Very strong smell of cloves, along with pumpkin, nutmeg and other spices. Probably the best smelling, or at least it has the strongest smell of the pumpkin beers I've had lately. However, the taste isn't as strong. The taste is mainly of cloves and other spices with a small bit of pumpkin. The mouthfeel is watery and thin, and it's more soda-like than anything else. The drinkability is OK, but not great. The aroma was definitely the best part of the beer, it all went downhill from there."
"D-Pretty easy to drink.Good beer to drink with baked cakes or pies."
"Poured a light orangey amber with absolutely no head. Nice pumpkin spice smell. The spice is more subtle in the taste than in the smell. Faint spice after taste that does not linger. Nothing truly remarkable in the taste, but absolutely nothing off-putting either. This beer lends itself to big gulps with a nice level of moderate carbonation. That coupled with the fairly mild / neutral taste, makes this an excellent session brew. In fact, I immediately had another."
"Overall, a beer that is tasty and easy to drink, but its mostly a spiced ale with pumpkin than a pumpkin ale."
"Pours a bright orange that looks almost artificially colored. Lots of carbonation results in a thick head. Unfortunately this completely fizzles out into nothing: no lace, no light ring of bubbles. Smells really thin and sweet, almost like a spiced cream soda. Really harsh on the spices. Tastes almost like a Pier One or Cost Plus World Market smells. Really strong cinnamon comes out like chewing on a cinnamon stick. Thin and soda-like mouthfeel with a harsh tannin feel almost as if chewing on a cinnamon stick. Even if I believed in pouring beer down the drain, I still wouldn't consider this a drain pour. I plain don't like it."
"Edit:Now that I think of it the taste and aroma reminded me of Hot Tamales, I mean seriously what the hell were they thinking? Artistic Interpretation is one thing, but this is just blasphemy."
"Sheesh."
"Not recommended"
"Poured a medium copper color. Small head gone in an instant. No lacing anywhere. Slight odor of pumpkin and spice. Strong taste of spice. Not much else going on tastewise. Mouth feel a tad thin and watery with a fair amount of carbonation. Don't think I'd be able to drink more than one or two in a sitting. Looking forward to trying the other pumpkin brews I purchased along with this one."
"Poured a brilliant light copper color with soarse, rapidly dissapearing head. No lacing. Smell is mild of pumpkin spice, but very restrained. Taste also revelas pumpkin spice, but ina very understaed manner. Extremely thin mouthfeel, such as to be almost like flat Seven-up. An OK beer, but not one of the better pumpkin ales."
"Pours a slightly hazed golden orange hue. Very thin head fizzles out to nothing almost instantly and shows minimal lacing. Ginger and allspice nose, with some background cinnamon and vanilla, but not much pumpkin or malt aroma. Mild pale malt sweetness and a hint of vegetal (pumpkin?) flavor upfront. The tongue is struck with the autumn spices described in the aroma, the cinnamon becomes more apparent, assertive clove taste, and another faint peppery spice ...cardamon or licorice? Spices dry-out the aftertaste and drown out any possible hop flavor. Very light and airy body with tons of lively carbonation; while this helps lift the heavy spice character, the mouthfeel would be smoother if less carbonated and not as heavy-handed on the spice. Basically a one-dimentional base malt flavor with no hop character that overcompensates with spices that harshen the finish."
"Overall, i'm guessing either they changed the receipe, or i'm really in the mood for this style, but i am enjoying this beer more than i did the last 2 years."
"Apparently there are folks in my area who crave this stuff. Well, they can have it. Pumpkin ale, I believe, should be eber first. This instead seems a gourdy, pie-spiced soft drink. It might be drinkable in spite of it's mediocre indentity, except on second thought, it really isn't. Those people who want this so badly are welcome to every last bottle of it."
"Exits the bottle in a warm orange pour. No head ... no lacing. Nose is nutmeg and cinnamon, suggesting moreso than imparting """pumpkin""". One of the fist things I notice is the huge carbonation ... not really digging that aspect of this beer. There's a really great cinnamon taste to this that I like a lot. It has a weird perfumey taste to it ... not entirely unpleasant but not really desired either. Decent overall but not something I want to buy again."
"Decent beer, but somethig seems like it's missing. I'll probably try a different Pumpkin Ale next time."
"Overall, a decent pumpkin ale. The spices are still used in a big way, but I never found it to be cloying or overbearing. Quite drinkable and a bit surprising after my big disappointment with the Orange Cream."
"The beers spices of Nutmeg and clove are over very stong, very light body and medium orange color the taste of pumpkin is light I would of hoped for more of a pumpkin flavor. As you open the bottle the spicy aroma hits you hard and fast. I will drink my 6 pack and maybe buy it again next year to see if it changes ."
"Daverage. Not bad for once a year, but I wouldnt have more than one in a sitting."
"You know what? I'm going to be doing something that I have almost never done - I am not going to finish this. I realize that this style can be all over the place, but I've tasted much better balanced pumpkin ales that literally taste like pie. This is so far off the mark for me. It's all spice and nothing else. There is not much endearing to me about this beer."
"Poured this from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. I thought the color was perfect for a pumpkin ale and made me think of fall colors. There isn't much of a head at all and with minimal lacing. Very carbonated though almost like a soda in the glass. There is a definate pumpkin pie aroma with alot of spicy undertones. More spice than I've ever had in a pumpkin ale at this point. If you like the spices I think this is a beer you might enjoy.... almost could qualify as a spiced ale!"
"This really isn't bad and I think it is unique. Harpoon's winter warmer has a similar feel to it. Very light bodied and drinkable, many spices. Nutmeg, cinnamin and other Octoberlike spices. Nice taste to it. Soapy head, pours a copper color and many can be consumed at once. Smells really good. I like this one."
"Pours a medium orange color with a thin white head and spotty lacing in the pint glass. Nose is of pumpkin spices - cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, allspice, etc ... accompanied by a nice malty background. Palate is the same spiciness, but a little subdued. Not a lot of definition here, but strikes me as an okay ale hiding behind the spices. A little bit on the sweet malt side of things. Mouthfeel is unfortunately thin and a little drab. Lightly carbonated and not a lot of vigor in this one. Overall, this beer smells better than it tastes, but is an okay pumpkin ale. I like pumpkin ales and would be willing to give this one another shot ...perhaps another vintage would be better. Mine was a '04 offfering according to my notes. If you like the style, it might be worth your while."
"This is a beer way out of season to be trying in June but it was on a discount rack and my cohort Trüb (pronounced tr'oob, rhymes with teets) was eager to try it. I had it last fall and was a little bothered by the spice rack perfume masque nailed to the face of a pale ale, but in general I'd drink it for the occasional episodes of spitting fire or washing down a number four combo at McDonalds. I prefer a darker beer with a hint of pumpkin goodness like Blue Moon's Pumpkin Beer, which is far more wholesome and religious and brings down the moon in the autumn to light the Devil's way home sans all the cackling witchery and hobgoblin potpourri spicing."
"Very easy to drink beer. It's the 'treat' I give to Trick or Treating Dad's that take their kids trick or treating."
"So, why do I want another?"
"Looks and smells good, but the illusion falls apart when you taste it. Completely out-of-balance, which is sad because I think if you put the unique spice/hop combination from this one into a nice Märzen or even a malty pale ale using a yeast with low attenuation, it could be quite good. On the positive side, I did pay less than $3 for this six-pack."
"D: Light creaminess goes down well. Rich flavors make it great for sipping."
"This brew pours a clear reddish-orange color. The head is one-finger in height, creamy and white with orange hues. The aroma is of cinnamon and nothing else. The taste is also dominated by cinnamon to a point where no pumpkin is noticable. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lively carbonation. Overall, this beer is decent but it would be nice if more pumpkin came through."
"More generally, this beer illustrates that one's preferences are highly individualistic, and that one shouldn't be deterred from trying a beer simply because others have given it poor reviews. You won't know what you think of it until you try it yourself. Once in a while you'll find one that, for you at least, is a hidden gem."
"Overall an excellent beer. It is a typical pumpkin ale, not too rich or tart. Its pumpkin flavor is not overwhelming. It is available at a ton of different stores, including world market and whole foods. it has an amber, orange color (go figure) and a cinnamon flavor to it, but not too spicy. Very drinkable."
"Mouthfeel was watery and light. Overall, this was not good but perhaps there are others in this style that have more character. Perhaps someone might like this at Thanksgiving as a curiosity, but not me."
"First of all, i can't taste the pumpkin at all. Well, maybe a little, but isn't pumpkin the whole point? What i can taste is spice. Spice that overwhelms any other flavor that may dwell beneath. Really not enjoyable to drink, unless you really, really like ginger and cinnamon. I couldn't finish the first bottle and gave the rest of the six pack away to unsuspecting friends."
"Well this beer was DOA. Looked ok with a yellow copper color and a decent if smallish white head. The smell warned me that I was drinking ginger ale, and when I tasted it I knew I wasn't wrong there was a good does of cinnamon in there too and that actually came through first, but no PUMPKIN flavor and the bland beer beneath this is forgetable."
"Um, not good. Not good at all. Better than Shipyard's pumpkin, but that's not saying much."
"I was in a holiday beer mood, so this beer followed a Dogfish Head Punkin' Ale. The contrast was astounding - this is perhaps the most lop-sided spiced beer I've ever run across. Gigantic, overpowering clove. This should be designated """clove beer.""" Some nutmeg struggled to rise above the din, and no other flavor could make much of a dent in the spice onslaught. I happen to like clove, and that was the only reason I could finish the beer as a curiosity. I understand Portland contract brews this. They should be ashamed."
"D: Though the smell is pleasing and the mouthfeel good, it would be difficult to drink more than one or two of these, for the cinnamon taste is a bit too overpowering, drowning out this beer's other possibilities and generally burning out the taste to experience more in the drinker. One shouldn't underestimate subtlety."
"D - About the worst thing I have ever put to my lips. Not tolerable in the least. Down the sink it goes."
"Not the worst pumpkin ale I've had, but nowhere close to the best either."
"Good brown orange colour with a foamy two-finger head. Not much of a smell to this beer. Theres a bit of hop grassiness and some spiciness to it. The taste is much fuller than the scent: malts, hops, nutmeg, cloves and cinnamon with a hint of pumpkin to it. This is savoury with a hint of sweetness to it. Not as sweet or cloying as Steamworks Pumpkin Spiced ale, but still enjoyable. Leaves the palate dry, and would serve as a good appetizer. Not quite sweet enough for desert."
"12 oz. with no freshness date - served chilled in a nonic. Pours a honey/golden color with a 1 finger off-white head that doesn't leave much lace. Smells like nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves, and pumpkin - kinda like a winter warmer without the beer aromas. The taste is predominantly spices which go away quickly and don't leave much aftertaste. It has a light bitterness and faint malts, along with a medium to light body that is a bit tingly and dry. It's decent, but there's too many spices (mainly clove) and not enough natural beer flavor."
"Not impressed by this one. I guess my standards for this style are pretty high after having Town Hall's amazing pumpkin ale. I most likely wont be buying this one, good thing I got this bottle from a friend :)"
"This is somewhat like a novelty malt beverage; not much like a beer. It looks like a beer with an orange-amber color and a white very minimal head. It had zero retention and zero lacing. The smell, although nice, it not very beer like. It was pretty darned pumpkiny, if you can imagine that. The taste is sugary, spicy, and sweet with little malt and hop focus. The focus is whatever they have added to make it pumpkiny. It feel watery and I cannot recommend it."
"Man it sure looks nice in the glass. A full frothy white/tan head rises to nearly two fingers before disipating and lacing 1/4""" above the brew on the glass at all times holding it's way down. The smell is overwhelming, spice, spice, spice, like pumpkin pie filling. The taste on this one is not good, very spicy up front and no hint of a finish at all. The watery finish of nothing feels like ambesol...that stuff that numbs your mouth. The spice coupled with this is terrible. The moutfeel is very watery and oddly flat. Will never buy this one again."
"Drinkability: A bit too sweet and pumpkin pie spicy for my palate"
"I can't say that I'll ever want to drink this again, I'll try next years to see if I am crazy or not."
"The beer pours a hazy dark gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a mild pumpkin scent along with the usual cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger. The taste is decent. It has a unique flavor that I'm not sure is good or bad. It has a decent pumpkin taste, but the spices are screwed up. There is an intense clove flavor that really sticks out. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate/good carbonation. This is a decent drinking pumpkin ale. If they get the spices figured out, this could be something to look forward to each year. As it stands, I'll pass next year."
"Overall: Not a complete disaster, but close. Probably twice as spiced as it should be, and a bit too sweet to boot. Not a good example of the style."
"My girlfriend talked me into buying this one. After not wanting to, I tried one with her and was plesantly suprised. Not a world class beer, but one of the better pumpkin beers out there. A strong, but not dominant, pumpkin and spice aromas and flavors. A decently creamy texture and no vegetable or grain flavors. Mildly sweet and easy on the palate. Finishes fairly clean. I'd probably drink another with Thanksgiving dinner."
"Not an everyday thirst quencher, however."
"Good carbonation gives this beer a pleasant mouthfeel and nice drinkability. No body and watery. I may have to pass on this beer for future pumpkin endeavors, but it will do for now."
"A decent offering in the pumpkin ale category. Poured out to a light orange color with a large-bubbled 1/4 inch head. Medium carbonation. Aromas of pumpkin and spice are present, along with a cooked squash smell. Not bad. Taste is missing something. Flavors of spice and pumpkin are here, as are weak and watery malt and hop characters. Somehow this brew just does not blend all that well. Mouthfeel was a bit on the watery side, but still not all that bad. Drinkability is average. Nothing special here. I've heard that this brew can vary from year to year. Let's hope so, as there are many better pumpkin ales out there this year."
"It is drinkable, but not one I'd call a session beer. I'll revisit this after I've had the offer to try other examples of the style so I can see how it stacks up against the rest."
"I would never buy this to drink again."
"Drinkability: well, sum it all up, right? Blech!"
"Over all I'd drink it again but it wouldn't be my first choice."
"All in all... glad I didnt buy a 6-er of this one. Still waiting on a pumpkin brew that makes me happy =("
"As it dispenses from the 12-ounce brown bottle, the beer resides in the glass a clarion amber with a modest semi-creamy light tan head that quickly disappears leaving the lace to surround the glass. Nose is sweet spicy pumpkin, with a nice bit of malt to back it up, start is somewhat sweet with a decent grain presence, top is light to moderate. Finish as a decent acidity, hops light but present, very dry aftertaste, bought two more different pumpkin ales for a small taste-off."
"Maybe I'm wrong, but I just can't taste any traditional pumpkin spices, just fake cinnamon. I'd love to see them try again and tone it down a bit."
"T: The taste was of a sweet variety with a strong cinnamon taste throughout. Some malt was there, but - like dating your good buddy's sister - it just didn't feel right. The mouthfeel was light, and because of the pour taste and other factors the beer really isn't that drinkable. I don't see myself returning to this one after this sixer is finished."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Watery and thin, the 7UP-like introduction on the tongue is followed by a disappointingly nondescript middle and finish. So boring that I sit here completely flabbergasted that a pumpkin beer I've seen for years could have been crafted so poorly, with nothing interesting or great whatsoever to speak of."
"I'd always heard this was pretty bad, and always having better pumpkin ales on hand, this is one I'd never tried. Until now. And I should have kept on without it. Pours a lackluster golden color (where's the orange glow?) Smells of women's perfume and cinnamon hard candy. That latter flavor dominates the brew, making it difficult to pick out anything else. Lots of sugary cinnamon here, and I think I'd actually enjoy it more if it had some heat to it, like those red hot candies, but it doesn't. Can't find the hops. The mouthfeel is lacking any carbonation bite or noticeable body. Yikes. I love this style...but this is just bad."
"I view pumpkin beers as more of a novelty than a serious brew, so I rarely expect to love them. It's nice once per year to change things up a little and get a sixer or two, but if they were available year-round I would seldom buy them. As far as Buffalo Bill's is concerned, this is exactly what I would expect from a Pumpkin Ale. They go a little overboard on the cinnamon/netmeg/clove flavors, but isn't this what you would want in a Pumpkin beer? I like it for what it is, but I won't sit down and drink a sixer in one night. I just like to throw it in the mix."
"I'm not a huge pumpkin beer fan but I'll give almost anything a try once and it is the season. Clear copper color with a small fizzy head that soon settles to nothing. Lacing is minimal at most. Aroma is all cinnamon, I can't get past it. Maybe a little sugary sweetness underneath. Flavor brings all spice. Maybe I got this too soon. Cinnamon and nutmeg and ginger, but not really any pumpkin. Fizzy in mouthfeel and watery in consistency. Different and not really my thing, not good even for a pumpkin beer."
"Buffalo Bill's Pumpkin is a highly carbonated copper colored brew, with a small, watery head. The aroma is full of sweet spices, cinnamon dominates with something sweeter, like nutmeg, lurking underneath. Taste is more of the same, the cinnamon is strong, almost like an Altoid or some schnapps. A mild malt body tries to keep the cinnamon from running wild. Nothing I can identify as pumpkin is present. Mouthfeel is watery and leaves no finish. This is very one-dimensional, but for some reason I still enjoy the strong cinnamon taste. This is definently a beer that will turn a lot of people off. Even though I like it, I doubt I could drink more than one of these in a session and I definently won't pick this up unless I can get it as a single."
"Body hovers just between light and medium, is softly carbonated, and creamy feeling. The only way I would want this beer is served w/ a warm slice of pumpkin or apple pie a la mode."
"D- Even thought the spices are big and bold and out shadow the flavors characteristic of beer, I enjoyed it. The ginger aroma and the cinnamon taste really kind of work together. I don't think I can drink any more of this one but I it makes me want to try a pumpkin beer that has a good balance of pumpkin spice and hops, malt or alcohol. This could be the """gate-way""" pumpkin beer."
"Well, this wasn't as bad as I expected, but it's not really a pumpkin ale, by my standards. Still, This thing isn't as bad as I had figured."
"-Oelergud"
"Drinkable, but there are better punkin's in the field."
"-UF"
"Very light copper color, with just a small white froth on top of the beer. Not much lacing to account for. Smells like moldy pumpkin pie, or old Chai. Some pumpkin, but still very musty. Very different, but not in a good way, slightly smokey and bitter, bringing it far away from what I would expect a pumpkin beer. Body is far too thin, not a very good pumpkin beer experience."
"The main problem with this one overall is that, while tasty, it's not a repeat brew due to the non-balance between the pumpkin and spice. If that was straghtened out a bit, this one would move from fairly good to very good, methinks."
"Flavors similar with some allspice or clove. Malts covered up by spices. Medium full body and smooth but not dextrinous mouthfeel. Weak hops just balances the sweetness of malts but not helping much in the finish."
" Considering how much my wife enjoyed it, I may grudgingly give it another try, probably at Thanksgiving. Like I said, can't wait."
"Pretty easy drinking, nonetheless."
"A little thin, I'd like to try this as a sweet stout. Still, a cool fall night and some cinnamon rolls or apple pie would go well.."
"D&N: I really wanted to like this one. I can't. I've tried it cold, I let it warm up, all to no avail. I like pumpkins, I think I want to try a DFH before avoiding pumpkin beers from now on. This beer is just too mired down by the overwhelming heaviness of the spices. This is the first beer in a long time I poured into the sink."
"I literally could not give this beer away. It tastes like pumpkin pie. Not a good pumpkin pie, one that was once frozen and then left out on a counter for 3 weeks. It pours orange with a weak head. There are strong hints of nutmeg and cloying malts. There isn't much pumpkin flavor per se, just too sweet pumpkin pie. Try O'Fallon instead,"
"Great beer if you want to drink 1 or 2, and wait a few days. It has *too much* impact for beer."
"Picked up for super cheap so I thought that I would give it a shot. Pours an absolutely flat copper color. This one didn't even bother to leave lace on the glass. Oh well. Nose is full of spice. Nutmeg and cinnamonn via for attention with a nice pumpkin-ish backbone. Taste is like drinking pumpkin pie. Nothing subtle about this. It seems to be a direct opposite of DFH's pumpkin beer (which is surprisingly subtle). I could see having one of these for dessert over the holidays but I doubt I'll be revisiting very often."
"A new style for me. Received it in a Christmas variety pack of ales. Quite interesting. Pours an amber color with a bit of a head. The smell is of pumpkin pie, maybe a bit of yeast / hops in the background. It tasted pretty good, but more like pumpkin pie than anything else. The hops seemed to be very mellow, the malt stood out more than anything other than the spices, but the spices did not overwhelm the ale. The mouthfeel was decent, with adequate carbonation and an enjoyable smoothness. Interesting. Not something I'd look for, but a refreshing and curious change of pace. Not so drinkable as I could probably only have one or two before I'd want a nice bitter IPA."
"Overall impression: Tasty pumpkin beer - nice way to drink your dessert. I don't see myself wanting too many of these at once though. All in all, not a bad beer (especially since BevMo was clearing it out for $2.99 a six!)"
"I found this bottle in the back of my fridge and looked forward to giving it a try. If beers was all sight and smells, it would rate highly with me. Too bad it tastes so strangely. I would not recommend this beer."
"Light tan/brown body, with little head or apparent body. Nose is big and spicy, reeking allspice, nutmeg, and cinnamon, like some sort of chai spiced tea infusion. Taste is thin but insistent on the chai spiciness. I thought: too much allspice and nutmeg and too little pumpkin and body. Body is, indeed, thin and the carbonation high. Not bad, but not the type of pumpkin ale I was expecting."
"Advice: buy a sixer to split with some friends if you want to try it."
"Pumpkin beer. Sounds like a holiday treat, or is it? Poured with 1/4""" head that dissipated to nothing quickly. No lacing down the side of the pint glass. Coppery clear orange in color. Smells of spices, but not sure which ones. Average carbonation. A sweet beginning followed by an aquired spicy taste that lingers in your mouth. Drinkability - 1 at most. Could not handle more than one of these. Definatly would not try this again, but would try another brewer's Pumpkin Ale to compare."
"Drinkability  This is a big sipping ale perfect for those cool fall evenings."
"Pours a golden copper with a small, quickly dissipating, ring of white head. Smells of candy, ginger ale, cinnamon, and pumpkin spice (it better smell like pumpkin!). Tastes much the same, but the candy sweetness is not there. Cinnamon and nutmeg flavors blend with the pumpkin--or do they make up the impression of """pumpkin?""" I don't know. High carbonation for this medium-bodied ale. I'm kind of a newbie to the world that is """pumpkin ales," and this one left me desiring a better example of the style."
"Least favorite pumpkin style I've tried this year. Received three of these in a beer of the month club. Maybe I'm too spoiled with the best Pumpkin, Cottonwood, brewed locally but this one did not do it for me. Tastes like an Octoberfest with an aftertaste of club soda. Will be difficult finishing the other two. A bit disappointed on Thanksgiving with the choice."
"Amber/orange color, low co2, and a white head with low retention. Aroma is of clove and cinnamon and kinda skunky. A surprisingly light representation of sweetness with a dry, tart finish. Palate is dry and lightly effervescent. A little sweet would bring more to the table. Quite character free for a Pumpkin Ale."
"I happily surprised. not something to drink every day but a good compliment to stouts and ciders for your Halloween/Thanksgiving parties."
"This beer needs much more malt background, i think if they upped the pumpkin input and the malts to add a little sweetness this would be a good beer. Just not enough body and sweetness for me to enjoy this one, gave the rest of the sixer away."
"Overall, fair, try a different pumpkin first."
"poured a light copper with off white head. aroma like thiose red cinnamon candies, along with the nutmeg and cloves. flavor at 1st taste I thoughtthis is nothing like pumpkin but I let it stay in the the month a while and the pumpkin pie taste did come out, with a bit of bitterness. do not know if I would want this for dessert"
"Drinkability- Not a beer that you would drink on a daily basis, but a nice beer to consume during the fall/winter months. A very nice pumpkin taste. I enjoyed this beer. This is the only pumpkin style beer I have had, so maybe there are better ones around. Assuming there are since this one doesn't get that great marks. Will search out some others."
"Drinkability and overall: I really dug this. It's a festive beer and I like pumpkin pie so...this worked for me. It's a great beer for this time of year. I wouldn't want it all the time but it hit the spot while I was carving pumpkins with my niece. A nice October beer."
"Basically, it's a pulverized pumpkin pie with a little malt and some hops thrown in so it could be called beer."
"Very carbonated, almost like pop, but this is a very drinkable and probably approachable pumpkin ale."
"Had this side-by-side with O'Fallon's Pumpkin Ale. Pours an orange color with a small white head that quickly dies off. There is a definate pumpkin spice aroma and that masks most others. The flavor isn't all that I had hoped for. There is a pumpkin spice flavor - mostly cinnamon and nutmeg. Very lacking in taste. Especially compared to the O'Fallon. Dogfish Head Punkin still reigns over both of these."
"There is something going on here but it seems too much. Too much cinnamon and too much carbonation."
"Wasn't sure what to expect when I tried this, but it certainly wasn't what I was hoping for. Pours a crystal-clear golden-orange with no head or lace to speak of. Smells of strong sweet cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg with very slight hops. The aroma gives you some expectation that the beer will have interesting flavor. Alas, the taste is completely lacking. Cloyingly sweet with very strong cinnamon and nutmeg flavors. No ale characteristics to speak of. Has the mouth-feel of carbonated water. Undrinkable (I couldn't finish it, at least)."
"Easy drinkability due to the thin body, but this is not an asset here. Not very substantial except for the nice pumpkin pie spices."
"Oh yeah, the mouthfeel is like flat Pepsi."
"It is drinkable. The thing is, it is a little too bitter for the pumpkin pie lover, and it is a little too flavored up for a hard core beer drinker. I am not sure who their target audience is, I guess it leaves me with beer style confusion."
"Summary: After trying Blue Moon and this, I'm still searching for a beer as good as the Quarryman's."
"12oz. bottle poured into a pint glass. It pours a light copper color with one finger of head. There is no lacing. The smell is very very spicy. There is lots and lots of nutmeg in the nose, just a touch of pumpkin. The taste is very malty and spicy. Lots of nutmeg, some pumpkin and clove. The body is a little bit light. The drinkability is fairly good. A decent pumpkin ale."
"Pours a cream colred head over clear light orangey/gold liquid. Sweet perfumy citrus and pumpkin pie spice nose. Light bodied and somewhat fizzy on the palate with flavors of fruity flowery pumpkin notes mixing with cinnamon and maybe some light allspice. Light hopping does a balancing act between bitter and flowery. Finishes slightly uninspired at the end, nice n easy to quaff but there's some better examples out there."
"2004 edition, contract brewed at Portland/MacTarnahan's. After the dismal Orange Blossom Cream Ale, I was curious to try this but approached with trepidation. Pumpkin ale is a lot more promising than orange ale, and I have had some damn good pumpkin beer before, particularly the one brewed by Mt Hood at last year's Holiday Ale Festival in Portland, OR. This is a marked improvement over the Orange Blossom, but it still fails to fully satisy. Pours a rich bronze-orange, with rising head that disappears very quickly, much like soda. Sweet, overpowering aroma of pumpkin pie spices. The pumpkin flavor is evident in the beer, but this really should be called Pumpkin Pie Ale since the focus is on nutmeg and cinnamon. The pumpkin is relegated to the background which is a shame since the hearty squash flavors of pumpkin marry well with both malt and hops. Malt is sweet, strong, and toffeeish here; hops are almost invisible. It could pair interestingly with a slice of pumpkin pie, but I suspect it will be sweetness overload, and too similar a flavor. An adequate novelty beer, and quite light and refreshing, although the mouthfeel is disappointingly thin. To be fair, I can see why it is a hit at parties with mainstream beer drinkers. But it's not an especially good beer overall. Hopefully Mt Hood brewed another batch of Ichabod's Head this year."
"Pours a light orange. The head is white and sticks around for a short time. I like the aroma, definately smells of pumpkin pie spices. I didn't really pick up on a ginger aroma, just the traditional Cinnamon, Nutmeg, and Allspice. The taste follows the nose. Fair amount of spice in the flavor. Mildly bitter going over the back of the palate. Good mouthfeel. Good carbonation with a light body. I think it is a very drinkable pumpkin ale. I liked it."
"Pours out a light orange copper with slight haze. Any head promptly dissipates into a ring around the glass. Smells distinctly pumpkin pie with genuine earthyness. Taste is also pumpkin pie. Slight bitterness perceptible over the light maltiness. Tiny carbonation bubbles can be felt on tongue and in mouth."
"Pours a light light amber almost more golden with small offwhite head light lacing. Aroma is nutmeg, allspice, cinnamon and light pumpkin.Taste is light not enough malt but you do get decent dose of spices little to much carbonation makes it seem even lighter then it is. Too bad smelled like a pretty good pumpkin beer but taste wise nothing but average. Mouthfeel little to light, drinkability well could kill 6 of these no problem but don't think I would ever purchase 6 more. Need to get brewers to step up and brew a good pumpkin ale know it can be done ask Cottonwood for their recipe"
"All in all no as bad as anticipated."
"I was really disappointed with this, not because I love pumpkins or the idea of a pumpkin beer, but because they could have gone all-out. If you're going to make a pumpkin beer, make a PUMPKIN beer. Sheesh."
"Not the best I have ever had, but way better than most."
"Now this is what I expected, pours a nice amber orange with an off white head that rises nicely. As soon as you crack open the bottle you will be nailed by cinnamon and nutmeg aroma. The slight pumpkin pie smell is subtle but nice. The taste is nice, a strong cinnamon uprfront will lent into a nice caramel malt smoothness in the end, a hint of pine fall hops in the back. A medium bodied ale. The drinkability is down because I couldn't imagine drinking 2 or more of these, a nice beer to have with pumpkin pie but after that, not much appeal."
"There's something about this beer that seems to work. The spices are a little out of balance, mostly because the cinnamon seems to dominate, but it still has a nice pumpkin pie flavor and aroma. The hops are subtle, which seems appropriate. For these reasons I give it a good score on drinkability and would gladly serve it to guests looking for something different. On the downside is the body and mouthfeel, where it's rather thin. This lack of body ultimately doesn't hold-up well to the mix of spices. The aftertaste is a little sticky/sweet but this dissipates, and is OK with me. The head is nice and sustains itself well. It's somewhat cloudy, but I'm not sure if that's what we should expect in a pumpkin beer. I suspect that it's possible to clear this up. Overall the beer is quite drinkable if you like the style."
"Yeah, it's drinkable and would certainly please some folks, but the hopping seems way out of place, even though it's not evident in the very attractive nose, which is just about all this beer has going for it."
"Ok beer, I wouldn't turn it down if it was offered to me."
"It tastes alright, but the overpowering smell, and far underpowered feel make this one a no-go for me. Pretty drinkable, but not something I plan to drink much of."
"-Updated review 10/12-Wow, what a difference a few years make. Looking at my original review, a world of difference! Very restrained, completely muted, nearly nonexistent spices..I smell more Cali Ale yeast character than anything else. Pumpkin flavor is muted as well. Little to no spice, but a nice authentic caramelized pumpkin flavor with a hint of biscuit malt or toast character. Bitterness is mild, which is fine. Nicely balanced, but this is hardly a pumpkin ale..this is an amber ale plain and simple. Re-rated to this most recent review."
"The smell is of nutmeg, cinnamon, and of course, some pumpkin. It has a fresh, earthy smell that can only be described as dirt. It's not at all like eating pie... think more of a roated pumpkin with browned butter. The taste is just like the smell... fresh yet earthy... dirty. I wouldn't describe it as chewy at all because this is still a lighter beer. There's a slight sharpness yet an underlying sweetness/spice. Definetly a very drinkable beer. I would say it's great with a rubbed, grilled pork loin for a fall grill...."
"This is my favorite of the Buffalo Bill beers, and one I look forward to every fall. It tastes just like pumpkin pie. It's not for everyone, but it's quite unique."
"My first spice beer of the season. Not as explosive as my first sip of Holiday Spice, but not a bad intro to the season ahead. Pretty decent amber color, but not much of a head. The smell was actually pretty well balanced and not too strong, but it was pretty one-dimensional. The taste is actually very smooth and the pumpkin and nutmeg definately make an appearance. Spice beers have so much potential when brewed correctly and this one was just not anything more than average. On a side note, I used this beer and Mendocino's Eye of the Hawk as an intro to a macro swilling friend. He enjoyed both very much and looks forward to more samplings! Hopefully another BA in the making!"
"Goes great with sweat potato salad."
"The taste was of nutmeg, followed by the pumpkin. Unfortunately, it seemed cloyingly slimy, covering the tongue and basically making me want to pour it out. Which I reluctantly did. I hate wasting beer like that, but there was no way I could bring myself to take another sip of this one."
"Drinkable, but this is a specialty brew."
"Pumpkin Pie in a bottle. I like pumpkin pie. I like this beer. If I could drop a scoop of vanilla ice cream in the bottle, I would. The look and feel are not much different than others of its style. The fun is in the spices: nutmeg and some cinnamon. Pretty crisp taste overall. A good choice for after dinner in October."
"12oz. bottle: This poured an amber color. It is clear, with maybe a hint of orange to it. There is a fizzy head that dissapates almost instantly. Not getting any lacing from the beer. It definitely smells like a pumpkin pie. The flavor is malty, with a good hit of pumpkin pie spiciness. Fairly crisp and dry taste. I remember this being better years ago, but then it wasn't being contract brewed."
"Dull dark orange color with a thin puffy off-white head that departs fairly quickly, leaves minimal spotty lace. Aroma is much like a sweet pumpkin pie, with spicy cinnamon, vanilla, some baked roastyness and is pleasant to the nose. Well the taste is about what I was expecting, kinda mild of pumpkin flavors with many hints of cinnamon spices, some light roastyness and sweetness of vanilla and molasses but is very short lived altogether, hardly makes a nudge on the palate. Feel is a bit thin, watery in some notions with hollow areas and some small carbonation texture. Not something I'd keep around or go back to again, but was hard to pass up the bomber at .99$ on sale."
"Not terrible, but really only worth drinking 1 before it gets boring."
"At least the label is nice and festive. It put me in the mood for a good autumn brew. The smell is enjoyable, but beer is made for drinking. Buffalo Bill's Pumpkin Ale doesn't quite make the grade."
"Head is off-white, beer is clear red/amber. The smell is 100% pumpkin pie spice. Nothing else. Cinnamon dominates the front. It tastes like those red hot candies. Or the cinnamon-flavored toothpicks we used to chew on. Some caramel tries to break through in the middle. Maybe some fruit. There's a little bit of hop bitterness in the finish and some nice grains in the aftertaste with temperature. But really, there's just one flavor: pumpkin pie spice heavy on the cinnamon. Still drinkable, though, and I've definitely had worse spice beers."
"Overall I wouldn't drink this again....I'd smell it again for sure though....if you want to buy it just to smell I guess I'd advocate that but if you are going to put the glass to your lips I'd stay away....Not impressive at all except for the smell..."
"It's a cute novelty, not as fantastic as I remember, but a nice treat once a year."
"Overall Impression: I’m not a pumpkin fan, so I was a little worried. The taste doesn’t blow me away, but I’m not repulsed (high praise, I know). Great smell, great color, the spices are nice, but somehow I think this needs a little more beer base for me to be happy. This seems like a pumpkin spritzer."
"Sickingly sweet is my first and foremost thought about this beer. Way to sweet to be a beer. It poured a medium sized ivory head with fine-large sized bubbles that quickly diminished. The nose was pumpkin pie, cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg. The flavor was sweet, malty and of course, pumpkin. It had a smooth mouthfeel along with a thin and watery texture and it was light bodied. The lacing was sparse. Another rating down the tubes of a beer that I absolutely did not enjoy one bit."
"Mouthfeel was average to slightly above. Very drinkable ale, and especially enjoyable on a cool, rainy day...maybe a nice piece of carrot cake to go with it. I need to get a sixer and save it for Thanksgiving."
"This one should just be a cinnamon beer. It poured a copper color with a small fizzy white head that did not last long at all. The first thing I could smell was the cinnamon and that's pretty much all I could detect. The taste definantly reflected the smell and was dominated by cinamon flavors with just a touch of malt flavour in the background. The thing that put me off was that there was not much """beer""" flavour at all and it seemed like I was drinking something overly sweet. Will not be drinking this one again."
"Drinkability: Needs some pumpkin flavors for me. Too much cinnamon. Won't be trying this one again."
"Thanks to Blatzman and AKSmokedPorter for the sample."
"But as to why this is a Pumpkin Ale and not just a Spiced Ale  I have no idea, maybe it is the picture of the Pumpkin on the label ;-)"
"Overall a pretty decent pumpkin ale, albeit rather heavy on the spices. Bottle labeling is rather attractive with a large pumpkin sitting in the patch set against a black background. If you're into pumpkin beers give this one a try."
"Too bad for the 250 word minimum because I can sum up my review in one word: OVER-SPICED. Orange-copper in color with a fluffy white head. Taste is sweet with cinnamon and nutmeg dominating. It's basically pumpkin pie in a bottle. I love spices, but I think they went a bit overboard on this one."
"Pours to an orangish-copper color with an off-white head. The aroma is like Thanksgiving dinner, total pumpkin pie. The flavor is like biting into a piece of pumpkin pie, with the pumpkin pie spices like cinnamon. It is light in body and easy drinking. A definite must with Thanksgiving dinner."
"This is kind of a novelty item, I think I would get bored of it pretty quickly."
"Ok, this is not the best Pumpkin beer that I have had, but it's also not the worst. It's pumpkin smell is far stronger than the taste. The smell isn't overpowering strong though, it's a nice balance of pumpkin, spices, and hops. The color was a golden amber color with a creamy frothy head. The head lasted only a couple minutes, but when it was present, was very nice and """fluffy""" looking. Mouthfeel wasn;t anything special, seemed like your basic Bud-esque feel. Really carbonated and bubbly. Will I get it again? Maybe, nothing to get excited over though. I would rather go with the Post Road Pumpkin Ale."
"Appearance: Copper amber tone with a light colored cream head, this beer contains sparse lacing not much just specks scattered. Aroma: Great pumpkin pie aromatics very solid scent of cinnamon, pumpkin, and other cream infused spices. Taste: Flavor doesn't deliver as well as some pumpkin ales I've tried but this one is not bad, just the spicing is a bit cloying here I'd much rather enjoy another Post Road from Brooklyn brewing or even a Blue Moon much smoother and still delivers the pumpkin pie esque tones. Mouthfeel: Slightly creamy but carbonation is a bit high and overal mouthfeel seems a bit thin and textureless compared to other beers of this style. Drinkability: Decent worth a shot not a pick up a case type of beer but then again maybe not even a six pack beer I wish I could have another to taste it again but I probably won't be investing anymore money on this ale."
"I recommend this beer to anyone who enjoys giving fun seasonals. I'm seriously considering giving these out to trick-or-treaters (after carding, of course) if my local beer sellers choose to stock this nice little treat."
"This beer has a nice orange copper color to it with a small amount of head and pour head retention. The smell is probably the best part of the beer. A very nice pumpkin aroma with many spices to smell. Smells much like a pumpkin pie. The taste is good with a well balanced taste of pumpkin spices and a light bitterness. Overall a pretty good seasonal worth trying. It took me a beer to get used to the taste but after that its pretty good."
"This beer when poured is a hazy orange color, with a small white head on it. Not much lacing to be accounted for. There is a great pumkin/cinnamin/ginger smell to this beer. The taste has similar qualities going for it. There isnt a very heavy mouthfeel to this one, its almost too watery. This isnt a half-bad drink, and it will bring back pleasant memories of the fall. I will say i am a big fan of pumkin pie, and this is my first pumkin style ale. But i like it."
"Clear dark orange, weak and short head that bunches on the glass margins at best. Extremely little lace. Heavily floral aroma, plenty of cinnamon with a wet vegetal muskiness. By gum, there is a lot of pumpkin along with pie spice in this one, broadly leafy in quality, and a sense of grape skins. Low carbonation and long lasting carry-over of the aroma finishes the flavor. Not really hoppy to close, more of a sense of mint. I can't say that this is a favorite but it seems more genuine in intent and execution than brews like Shipyard..."
"Deep golden color. Not deep enough though. I expect a deep amber or orange or copper when it comes to Pumpkin ales. A slight off-white head recedes to the thinnist of coatings. The rimming sticks around for a while. I love the aroma of this beer. While spices are present, it's much more. It actually smells like pumpkin pie. The nose consists of clove, nutmeg and cinamon sprinkled atop a pumpkin pulp and caramel malt base. Flavor profile is more of the same, except less of the all important pulp/malt base. Just a tad heavy on the cloves. Also some cinamon and allspice. There's a slight sweet pulp taste. And some caramel malt backing. Just not enough. I used to like this one a lot more. Haven't had it for 2 years now. I still like it...but not quite as much."
"Mouthfeel is a trifle thin. Drinkability is fine, but I never have more than a couple in a sitting. Different but good."
"A nice beer, nicely packaged and presented, and interesting at this time of the year. Appropriately golden orange and cloudy, the body is topped with a cream-colored head just as the pie filling would have a hazy cream layer on it. The nose is full of malt and spices and this is a strong element in the taste as well. Enjoyable stuff without being too complex or assertive. A disappointing finish in the feel as this completes with a bit of thin wateriness. Completely drinkable though as this impresses as being just plain fun and uncomplicated to drink."
"Overall, its an OK beer. Nice carbonation, easy to drink. Not to overpowering with the spices, just missing a little something in the end."
"This was the first pumpkin ale that I have had. There was too much spice and not enough pumpkin. The apperance was good, a small bubbly head that discipated quickly but left a nice lace. It was a nice reddis hue that was attractive. The smell was the best quality of this beer. It smelled of pumpkin and spices but the flavor had too much of the spice. I would have gone for more of a sweet and malty pumpkin brew. The mouth feel was watery and very carbonated. I could not drink the beer. It was the first beer that I put down the drain."
"Some have said that this beer is too sweet and even cloying. Didnt seem to be in this case. Maybe it has changed a bit this season? It was more like a cheap spice candle to me then a pumpkin ale. The store I bought this from only sold it in six packs. Now Ive got to figure out what to do with the other five..."
"I enjoy trying this beer each season. This year the beer pours an amber orange kind of pumpkinesc color. Little head and minimal at best stick. Aromas are all pumkin pie spice and even some fresh pumpkin way in the background. The flavors are all pumpkin pie spice as well. A little malt adds an all most pie crust complexity to the total package. This is not a sweet spicy over the top brew, instead, a fun beer that is worth grabbing to usher in the season, and perhaps a super choice to match with your warm punkin pie."
"Overall: A good brew, but in my opinion it can hold a candle to Post Road Pumpkin Ale."
"This beer is a copper orange color and pours with a cream colored thin head. It smells strongly of pie spices, strong nutmeg, cinnamon, and allspice aromas. Quite a dry beer, not much sweetness at all. The spices in the beer are mostly evident as an aroma as one is tasting, though they also come through a bit in the finish. A fairly light beer, which is basically a vehicle for the pumpkin pie spices. The spices seem to add a bit of astringency in the finish."
"Notes: Will happily seek this out as a Thanksgiving seasonal. Not for everyone, though."
"Pretty easy to drink but a severe dissapointment after the great aromas."
"WTF are they thinking?"
"Medium gold color, medium head. Pumpkin and spicy aroma. A mild tasting ale, flavored with pumpkin, allspice, cinnamon and nutmeg. The malts and spices clash a little, but combine for a rather interesting taste. Would not want to drink a lot of this beer, but one once in a while would be OK. Mouthfeel is full and a little flat. Finish is clean. Aftertaste is a little sweet and spicy."
"Spicy nose, cinnamon and cloves wafting up throughout the tasting experience, like drinking a pumpkin pie. Other than that, I found very little traditional brew tastes (hops, yeast, malt) that came through. Very much a dessert beer. Not wholly unpleasant, but not what I would describe as """beer.""""
"Clear bright amber-orange color, aroma of cinnamon and pumpkin. Pumpkin , ginger and cinnamon flavors, very spicy. Light body with a watery mouthfeel, has a nice malt balance, this is not bad and very different."
"The strong aroma of pumpkin and ginger was really promising on this one, but the flavor really didn't deliver. With a little more pumkpin flavor and a little less carbonation I think it would have been a """must-buy""" every year around Halloween. As it stands though it was like a lot of fruit beers I have tried where the bark was better than the bite. I am going to try to hunt down a Pumpkin Stout!"
"Pours a golden orange color with a light and foamy white head.  Nose is of pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves.  Feels very thin and watery in the mouth with a taste that reminds me a lot of a shot of Goldschlager dumped into a glass of water.  Im sure that there must be better Pumpkin brews out there."
"Pours mostly clear with an orangish hue between apricot and pumpkin.  Head is minimal, though fed by light, persistent carbonation.  Smell is that of pumpkin pie spices such as cloves, ginger, and cinnamon.  Taste is rather monotonous, particularly considering the lively sell.  Pie spices again dominate, along with a sweetness that subdues any crispness.  Mouthfeel is fine; drinkability is limited by the fact that this seems little more than a novelty beer rather than something I generally would reach for."
"I don't think this style is the favorite for many.  However, it usually only offered during a limited time of the year.  I usually get it just to be different.  This particular pumpkin ale has a lot of cinnamon taste - kinda like a red hot candy.  I've had half a six pack sitting around for 4-6 weeks just because I haven't been inclined to drink any more.  I think this is less appealing than an average beer.  I would seek out another beer of the pumpkin ale variety if looking for this style."
"Amber appearance, minimal head. Not much nose for a seasonal spiced brew. Some mild flavors of nutmeg and cinnamon. Other would be flavor contributors (malt, hops, etc.) are rather bland. Thin mouthfeel. Relatively dry finish. Not bad to try once, but not one I'd go back to."
"Note: this beer was #43 in Stuart Kallen's """The 50 Greatest Beers in the World""""
"Nice deep orange amber color. Perfect tones for fall. The beer pours with a better than average head. Nice aroma, spicy pumpkin scents. Clean and airy. Spicy and pumpkin flavors are all that is available to the taste. Not much beyond that. This is not a complex brew. It is an average beer. Take it or leave it."
"And I promise future reviews won't be so corny. Really. :-)"
"Pours a clear orange color with a decent white head that leaves a nice lace down the glass.  Incredible spicy pumpkin pie aroma that is spot on what a pie should smell like.  Quick crisp malt flavors jump out at first before the pumkin flavors come out.  As the beer progresses it is like drinking pumpkin pie.  Great spicy and pumpkin flavors.  Rather crisp and not as cloying as you would think with the sweet pumpkin pie tastes.  This is definitely a rather drinkable brew that, seems to me, is only slightly overdone on the pumpkin flavors."
"Pours a nice almost pumpkin-orange color with a thin white head.  Lace is quite decent.  Aroma is pumpkin pie spice-like, but also with an odd almost medicinal herbal scent in the background.  Tasting yields a slightly sour or tangy malt flavor overlaid with fairly strong, though not overwhelming, pumpkin pie spices.  These flavors linger into the aftertaste and become more distinct.  All in all, if you like pumpkin pie, this is not bad; if you do not - pass."
"Artificial cinnamon/nutmeg aromas and flavor.  Soda-like peppery & prickly abrasiveness on the tongue. Head-less shortly after pour.  Had this last year and it was enjoyed, maybe I was too new at tasting, maybe it was actually a superior brew, probably both.  I am not fond of Buffalo Bill's Pumpkin Ale."
"Ive seen these going for $10 a 6-pack, way overpriced! I snagged a single for $1.75 in Omaha."
"Light amber / peach with a thin head.  Highly carbonated, somewhat thin.  Aroma of malt and pumpkin pie.  Flavor of malt, quite a bit of pumpkin and spice, finishing with a touch of hops bitterness.  This wasn't as disappointing as I expected, after having read so many negative reviews on here.  Maybe that's because it's the first pumpkin beer I've had, so I'm not sure how it stacks up against others. This wasn't a great beer... or even one that I'll see out again however.  Also not something that I could drink more than one of."
"Light amber hue w/ a slight haze. The ivory white large bubbled head settles into a dense, 1/2 cm. head.  Respectable lace is left down the glass.  The assertive, borderline cloying pumpkin pie spice aroma comprised of cinnamon and nutmeg initially overpowers malt notes, but trace buttery malt and light caramel becomes discernible as the beer breathes.  The initial flavor mirrors the aroma and is dominated by cinnamon, but mellow allspice and clove surface and provide some depth in flavor.  Malt nuances are completely overpowered by the assertive spicing, but malt backbone makes its presence known in the relative full body for style and smooth mouthfeel.  The paltry hop bitterness serves only to offset malt sweetness. Finishes w/ a snap of turpentine like sweetness and light breadiness fading quickly.  Although Bill's Pumpkin Ale grew on me as I drank it, it still suffers from the plague of most spiced beers... the malt profile was overshadowed."
"This beer pours a cloudy, light-orange color with a puffy white head.  Head fades quickly, and produces no lace. Smell is unquestionably pumpkin, but also fruit-like (seemed to smell apricots?).  Soft, full mouthfeel.  Foretaste is sweet.  There are some spice tastes that seem to confuse the overall pumpkin character of the beer.  Could have been better, but I always seem to recall pumpkin beer (almost all pumpkin beer) tasting better the previous year...."
"this is the worst beer i have ever had. i hate pumpkin pie, and i love beer, but the two were never meant to be together. i absolutely could not finish more than one. i could probably drink a pint of goat piss before i could drink another drop of this insane combo of nasty disasterous shat."
