"One of the best pumpkin beers I have had. I did a taste test over thanksgiving with around 25 different pumpkin beers and this was one of the ones on the top."
""
""
""
"Probably amongst the best pumpkin beers I've had. Just not a big pumpkin beer fan"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours an amber hue with a translucent clarity.  Nose expresses nutmeg, clove, peppery notes and a hint of ethanol.  Taste consistent with nose - what I like about this beer is that the spice profile is not in your face. Mouthfeel is light-medium with an even carbonation and a slight acidity.  Overall, a solid pumpkin beer.  Generally not a style in my wheelhouse; however, I enjoyed this one.  Definitely in my top three for the style thus far."

"Poured into a sniffer. Has a dark amber color with big aromas of pumpkin and spices. Mellow but present pumpkin flavor but most of the taste comes from a myriad of spices. Even gives off the flavor of being bourbon barrel aged and is rather alcoholic. This beer could use some aging to allow some more flavors to open up. (Like most pumpkin beers in my opinion). Nevertheless this is probably my second favorite pumpkin beer of all time and I thouroughly enjoyed drinking this beer."
"Tons of natural pumpkin flavor initially with the spices becoming more dominant as the beer warms. One of the better pumpkin beers that I've had."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a nice dark amber, orangish-red color with off-white head. Pumpkin, pumpkin pie spice, and caramel and malt on the nose; follows onto the palate. Finishes like a nice piece of pumpkin pie."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Tastes like real pumpkins and pie. Really nice viscous mouth feel. Not too sweet. This is really good."
""
"Likely the best pumpkin I had. It has a superior balance and it is more elegant than other counterparties with good spices complexity."
"Overall, a well-balanced pumpkin ale that highlights both sweet and spicy aspects of style."
"Not a huge fan of the style, but better than many pumpkin seasonals I've had."

"Copper with ruby tones and an off white head that fades to a small ring and doesn't leave much lacing, if any.  A bit flat looking, but I experience this with the style.  Caramel, graham crusty malt, gord meat,cinnamon, nutmeg, clove and do I detect a hint of cream?!  Starts off with a nice vegetal gord meat flavor that is wrapped in caramel and graham flavors.  The spice weaves in early bringing a perfect level of cinnamon, clove and nutmeg spiciness.  Lower carbonation and the body feels slightly thin.  Overall it's a great pumpkin ale.  It's top two for me next to Pumking."

"22oz bomber.  Pours deep amber orange.  1 finger of head.  Dissipates quickly.  Aromas of pumpkin, cinnamon, all spice, nutmeg, sugar..Tastes like a good pumpkin pie.  Less sweet than alewerks but still very good and smooth.  Easy to drink.  Same flavors in the mouth and on the way down.  Very solid pumpkin beer.  Perfect for football season and thanksgiving."

"Overall - I might have a new favorite pumpkin ale."

"The flavor tends strongly to the creamy pumpkin sweetness, almost like the whipped cream on top of the pie was included. There is little to no spiciness, that I can tell and nothing in the way of malty pie crust, but mostly the pumpkin pie filling."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Probably the best pumpkin ale I've had. They are too proud of it though ($$$$$)."
""
"O - The key to any great beer is balance and this beer has it.  The pumpkin and the splices are well matched to the beer, nothing is overpowering.  Delicious, the best pumpkin beer I've tasted in 2014."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O – Of all the harvest/pumpkin beers, this is one of the best (if not THE best) I’ve had.  The creaminess from the nitro puts it over the top."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, some nuttiness. The aroma is lovely, however the flavor wasn't as well integrated as I had hoped. A little too overwhelmingly spicy, but still enjoyable."

"No bitterness or whim-like ingredients to see what happens. This was tested and approved unanimously over, and over and over and over again."
""
""
""
""
""
"One of the better Pumpkin beers being made today.  I've had this on Nitro at the brewery and also from the bottle.  Nitro gives it a bit better mouth-feel but overall, they both pack a lot of spices and pumpkin flavor without taking away from the beer.  One of the only pumpkin brews that I see out annually."
""
"Overall this is an excellent pumpkin ale. It is not a sickly sweet pumpkin pie ale. The spices, although prominent are not over powering. I highly recommend."

"The beer pours a clear dark amber/brown with a thin off-white head that fades quickly. The nose is spice forward, but not distinctly pumpkin pie-like, instead it has a slightly cinnamon and bubble gum aroma. The taste has a similar bubble gummy/plastic spice presence, which dominates the sweet malty base and leaves little room for other expected pumpkin beer flavors i.e. caramelized sugars, vegetal gourd, grain, and yeast. Drinking this beer leaves the palate saturated by a medium-heavy bodied, boozy, punishing spice bomb. It's reasonably carbonated and sweet. This is a distinct and different kind of pumpkin ale, but the dominating bubble gummy spice profile is off putting"

"Very good beer.  I won't do the breakdown, because I tried one week ago.  It was very complex, and not overdone.  I loved this brew. Cigar City rarely disappoints."
""
""
"This may be my new favorite pumpkin beer. Not artificial tasting, nice pumpkin-spice balance, and super tasty. Seek.It.Out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The spice flavors are pretty nice but a little over the top for me. Not usually a fan of higher ABV pumpkin ales, but this is probably one of the better ones I remember."

"Sorry Pumking, this is the true king of pumpkin ales. Smell is obviously of pumpkin, allspice and cinnamon. For 8.5%, I got little to no alcohol burn on the back. The quintessential beer to celebrate autumn. Delicious. Highly recommended brew from Cigar City."

"2013 bottle poured into a white wine glass. Smells like fresh pumpkin pie. Good mouthfeel, full but not heavy. Plenty of spice but good balance with the pumpkin. Neither one dominates the other. This was good pumpkin pie in a glass. Perfect for thanksgiving dinner or special fall dinners. Probably not something I would drink on a random Tuesday night."
""
""
"Pours a dark amber color but translucent when held up to light.  Light but noticeable carbonation.  Cloves, pumpkin and brandy on the nose.  Taste is boozy, pumkin, allspice, cloves, cinnamon and ? candy corn in a perfect combination.  Delicious."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Best pumpkin beer I've ever had. Nice spice notes yet still very smooth at the same time. Sweetness was spot on. Not too much or too little. Fabulous beer!"
""
""

"Best pumpkin beer hands down!  Like liquid pumpkin with perfect balance of alcohol."

"O-a well-made pumpkin beer with great flavor and not overly sweetened as many of this style are, probably my favorite of the style"
""
""
"D: Really well done and quite enjoyable. You get the pumpkin and the spice in great balance. I don’t have much experience with Pumpkin beers but this is what I imagine one should be like."

"o - Overall I liked this one a lot; while not my favorite pumpkin beer ever it is in the mix with the top ones out there for sure. Easy to drink and the taste was great, I think I like Schlafly's pumpkin ale the best, followed by Elysian The Great Pumpkin, this, Pumking, and Alewerks Pumpkin Ale all slightly under it. Well worth checking out if you like the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Full bodied for the style with a nice balance of pumpkin pie sweetness and earthy, zesty spice notes. Strong organic tasting pumpkin and pumpkin purée/pie filling up front with prominent nutmeg, vanilla, brown sugar and allspice countered by a more musty, rustic spice profile that has hints of peppery clove, ginger, cinnamon and cardamom. There's a nice malt backbone giving off more sweetness with hints of caramel, toffee, toast and biscuit. Slight boozy sweetness in the finish but there is no heat at all. Drinks incredibly well for 8.5%. In addition to the complexity, there is incredible balance. The spice presence is really strong taming the pumpkin pie/dessert sweetness and there's just enough sweet malt and pumpkin character preventing it from feeling overwhelmingly spicy. I can see how this could be a bit too much for some but I think it's a great take on the style. One of the better examples of what a pumpkin beer can be."

"I might have a new favorite pumpkin beer here. Rich, sweet, smooth and utterly drinkable- it's certainly not often that I go through a 750 so quickly and easily on my own. This is one definately worth seeking. I can't wait to try Almighty!"
""
""
""
""
""

"A very solid, if slightly overdone, pumpkin beer."
""
""
"got to be the smoothest pumpkin beer ever. been mellowing for a year now. bronze and lazy in looks, but angry and temperamental and impatient in taste. so much here, all orange and frothy. nose of gourd, its true, cinnamon, clove, ginger, turmeric, and all kinds of liquor. smooth and comfortably spiced, this is a beer of sharing proportions. vanilla, brown sugar, and cardamom. so much going on here, but so little comprehension for me as I sip away, tasting something new each time. barrel and attitude percolate heavy, as does a soft sort of pokey vibe. spice is robust, yet I am as mellow as anything. delicate feel, needs more oomph overall, but this is special stuff. the name gourd makes me want more gourds, its reciprocal in that way, special yet understated. impress me it does, perfect it is not..."

"This really represents a perfect pumpkin pie in a beer. Pumking does a good job, but is a bit cloying on the sweetness. This has the perfect balance that really makes this the best pumpkin beer out there."
""
""
""
""
"O: I'd be surprised if you did a blind taste test of this and didn't pick out each flavor I listed. They are all there and so prominent, yet in perfect harmony. CCB went over the top with this beer, my new favorite fall release. Thankfully I have friends willing to send me bottles of this :D"

"O - If you distilled fall, had your grandmother bake it into a pie, and then brewed a beer with it, this would be that beer."

""

"Oh the epiphany. Where have you been every fall for the last 7 years dear Good Gourd? Out of distribution, sadly. But thanks to kayaksandbeer, my clutch trading partner, I can now imbibe in what I consider the PERFECT pumpkin beer. All others have been warned, this is legit."
""
""
""
"A remarkably good pumpkin beer - really great balance. Liquefied pumpkin pie, vanilla creme, yam, cinnamon, nutmeg and other autumnal spices, nice touch of warmth from the booze, pie crust. I was very impressed by this one - wish I had access"
""
"If you like Pumpkin beers then definitely try it out. To me.. I have yet to taste s better pumpkin beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a big, sweet, syrupy beer and I love it. The huge pumpkin/clove sweetness and dry finish makes this a winner for me. I've found my new favorite pumpkin beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"wow, big and boozy pumpkin beer. Strong nutmeg & cinnamon notes. Slightly thin tasting, so sweet no real character develops. Big time boozy aftertaste, reminds me of a fat Tuesday drink that tastes like a dessert and then you swallow and say 'damn, there was a ton of alcohol in that thing'. Glad I tried it, wouldn't seek out again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: this is something I'd like to share with someone. Not something to drink yourself. It holds well over night. I opened it the first night, did not finish it. Put a wine cork in, reopened it the next day and it tasted fine."
"Overall: Wow, this is absolutely fantastic. I don't love pumpkin beers but this is just great. I would expect no less from CCB, and this certainly delivers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Wow, this is really amazing. Tastes like someone put some Cool Whip, apple pie, pumpkin pie and a few cones of hops in a blender with maybe a few shots of whipped vodka. Mouthfeel is rich and velvety. Very nice."
""
""
""
""
"O-Beautiful beer. CCB has not made anything that i don't like. This is by far the best Pumpkin beer in the world. Amazing A+++"

"Pours a glowing deep amber hue, glowing edges with some sunfire, well hazed with a frothy off white head that laces ok, a decent sized ring. Aromas are crisp toast and caramel, vanilla and toffee, biscuits, and pumpkin puree, a bit sweeter with decent pie spice. Cinnamon, nutmeg, and more vanilla, caramel. Some crispness. Initial is medium bodied offering a touch more sweetness, vanilla and caramel blast, toffee and toast, gentle spice moves in, with cinnamon and brown sugar, toffee and biscuits. More pie spices and pumpkin puree, sweeter with caramelized malts, touches of sweetness dance, with just a hint of dryness. Fairly balanced for a sweeter beer, spice and vanilla, sweet malts. Finish is nice, gentle spice and sweetness linger. It’s not complex, but it’s tasty, sweet slanted without being anywhere near cloying. Fairly balanced. Very nice."

" I love when asked what this beer will likely pair well with, as they likely expect desserts like pumpkin pie. I enjoy explaining that it doesn't pair with dessert, it replaces the dessert!"
"Probably the best pumpkin beer out there. I reserve my final judgment as I haven't tried all the amazing pumpkin beers, but this one deserves the #1 spot for pumpkin beers that it's got right now. CCB, I love you guys and keep up the great work."

"O - In a sea of pumpkin beers released all too early, Good Gourd stands head and shoulders above the crowd, with a wonderful familiarity like that pie your aunt always brings to Thanksgiving, but this time it's tweaked. Cigar City's use of intercontinental spice gives Good Gourd a truly one-of-a-kind aroma and flavor. If you can get it, make this the one must-try pumpkin beer of the season."
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer is copper to amber hued with a quarter inch of off white head. Crimson highlights in the body. The aroma brings cinnamon, pumpkin pie, pie filling, sugar, while cream. Sweet and spicy with a smooth malty body. A touch of alcohol warmth in the finish. Really solid. Splitting the bottle a few ways is probably best."
"O- favorite pumpkin beer, and I have had many. Saw some people mixing it with Zhukov's the other night. interesting, but I love both just alone"

"pours a dark orange with a small head. smell is BIG on nutmeg and pumpkin. taste is identical. amazing flavor and perhaps the best pumpkin beer I've ever tried. lingering pumpkin taste. love it. thoroughly recommended."
""
""
""
"Overall, I think this is a big, bold treat that is intensely flavorful and will definitely sneak up on those unaware of its potency. It is probably one to be shared amongst friends on a chillier evening after a nice meal. I can see this pairing well with desserts during the Thanksgiving holidays. In my current position in hot, humid Florida, probably not the best thing. A well made beer by CCB, probably one of the better ones they have to offer. If I were to make changes, I would balance the spices a little more, maybe less clove and cinnamon."
""
""
"Bottle purchased at the brewpub. Pours a deep dark reddish orange with a nice fluffy off white head with a slightly orange hue. Aroma of cinnamon and nutmeg, maybe some sweet vanilla, and some faint pumpkin, sweet sugar, and some booze when I take a big whiff. Sweet pumpkin flavor and some cinnamon and clove spice. Lingering sweet vanilla cream and pumpkin is definite a highlight here. Finishes nice, medium carbonation. Would be even better if it weren’t 105 with the humidity outside. Neat beer even for non pumpkin beer fans."
""
""
""
""
"Absolutely phenomenal. Very dark in color with a slight head that boils down to nothing. Smells of fall. No other way to explain it, tastes like a very dark ale with many flavors and finishes off with the sweetness of pumpkin pie. One of the best CCB has to offer."
""
""
""
"O: Another great CCB brew. Pumkin beers aren't usually in my must have category but, after drinking this one I picked up a few bottles from my friend to consume later into the season. A definate must try."
""
"I used to think Pumking was the best of its kind. Boy was I ever wrong, especially with this '13 batch. Good Gourd is easily the best pumpkin beer and is now my new holy grail. The smell isn't powerful but the taste is. A little gem right here. I can't wait to stock up."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The most hyped pumpkin ale in the world? I think so. But does it live up to the hype? Yes, I would say it does. It is truly unique, memorable, and delicious. CCB does it again."
"O: It lived up to the hype and then some."
"Overall: This is a fantastic pumpkin beer. I've had some that are too sweet without balance, or where the pumpkin is overpowered with other spices, but CCB did a great job balancing the flavors and the heavy ABV gives it some character. One of my favorite seasonals from CCB and hands down my favorite pumpkin beer."
"Overall: So glad I picked up this beer! By far the best Pumpkin beer I've had. And one of the few that actually have pumpkin in it. It's a bummer that it is so damn hot outside in Florida right now. These flavors make me long for bon fires and cold nights. Pick one up or trade while you can!"
"Overall: I didn't want to get a fall beer this soon, but it being CCB, I went ahead and picked up a bottle. VERY GLAD I DID. It just makes me hate that it's summer now. I want to be cold and enjoying this fantastic beer. It looks great, the aroma last throughout, and the taste seemed to have something new throughout it's entire session. I've finished this glass, now I'm off for a refill."

"This fall I had my first Good Gourd as my first beer for a tailgate; after most of the pumpkin hype season had died down. I poured it into a red wine glass (my best option) and immediately noticed that I liked the color and aroma much more than certain other pumpkin ales. My first sip, I was hooked. I bought up several more, two for this winter, and a few to age for next year. I picked the first one up for $13, and the next few for $14; and they were certainly worth the price IMHO."
"Solid for a higher ABV pumpkin ale. Not too spicy and a pretty good balance."
""
""
"O - Fantastic pumpkin beer. Another hit from CC. Hardly taste the booze for the ABV. Another reason I love Cigar City. Beers like this make me wonder why there's not more love for pumpkin beers... but I suppose to each their own."
""
""
""
""
""
"When I first had a fresh bottle of this I thought the alcohol interfered with the beer - 13 months of age did wonders."
""
"O - I seem to be one of a few who really love pumpkin beers; this is a phenomenal representation of this beer style/flavor; the sweetness is there but not at all overwhelmingly so; I almost don't taste any booziness...that says something at 8.5%; to me, this is a perfect fall offering"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Thanks, voxomkid, for the opportunity"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D - Not bad, but I don't think it lives up to what some have said about it. Despite CCs penchant for high end spices, the pie character here is kind of bland and flabby with a malt character that only serves to reinforce that impression. I had this beer when it first came out and remember it being less sweet and spicy with more hops in the balance, but it has been so long that I might be misremembering it at this point."
"Overall: one of the best of this genre and style. Very flavorful, each flavor is well represented and distinct. a must try."
""
""
"Overall, a really unique, interesting and complex take on the pumpkin beer style. The spice note is one of a kind and doesn't overwhelm the base beer. One of my new favorites of this style. Definitely want to try this again. Balanced, smooth and complex."
"O- This was a fantastic pumpkin ale. Easily one of the best I've had. Pumpkin ales are not easy to master- a lot of breweries don't get enough pumpkin to come out and some overspice. CCB did a great job in creating this pumpkin ale and I highly recommend trying it out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer got better as I drank it. It has a vanilla taste to it but the vanilla got stronger later on. It is defiantly a better tasting beer than Schlafly but it is not as good as Pumpking to me. I would say that Good Gourd is my top 5 pumpkin beers to date. This beer was hard to find. I ordered it from Letspour.com online since the beer is from Fla."
""
"This was very enjoyable overall. Notmy favorite of the pumpkin beers, but this is definitely a solid beer in the category. Nice body, medium in the feel. Carbonation could be a little higher, but a nice ber."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This isn't a pumpkin so much as it is concentrated essence of pumpkin pie. So much spice and chewy malt the pumpkin loses out. If the spices dialed down a touch, this would be fantastic."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"So spicy. This beer seems to treat pumpkin pie spices like DIPAs treat hops; the more the merrier. I'm not sure if I really enjoy this. It's good, but it has some issues."
"Overall, this is a phenomenal pumpkin beer. I think it's right up there with my two favorites: Schlafly Pumpkin Ale and Southern Tier Pumking. It's sweet, but not cloyingly so, and the squashy pumpkin flavors are perfectly complemented by holiday spices. A fantastic fall beer."

"Big Thanks to kswartz for helping me get a hold of this one. The beer poured out as a nice vibrant orange color with a nice looking white head on top. The smell of the beer is sweet, some moderate spice notes and from what I can tell some of the freshest Pumpkin/Gourd aromas I've ever experienced from a beer. The taste of the beer is again sweet like the nose but balances out quite nicely with the subtle amount of spice that has been used. The mouthfeel of the beer is heavy, it's got a solid thickness to it, it's gently carbonated and goes down nice and smooth. Overall I really enjoyed this beer, one of the best Pumpkin beers I've had as of yet. I highly recommend this brew to anyone looking for something a little different to try than just a typical Pumpkin beer like most breweries are putting out. This one sets the bar pretty high in my opinion."

"A really wonderful pumpkin ale that would pair nice by the fireside. Probably also good with traditional fall desserts (i.e., pumpkin and apple pie) as well as homemade french vanilla ice cream. You might take a chance, too, and try pairing it with grilled pork loin."
""
"Overall this is one of the better pumpkin ales out there. Seek it out."

"I personally love Pumpkin Ales. I know it's a polarizing style, but they are among my favorites. Overall, this was well worth the online buy from Luekens'. I have been wanting to try this for a while and couldn't wait until Sept 1 (the """official""" start of fall and football season in my book this year) to try it. For me, it kind of melded together a lot of elements of Schlafly Pumpkin (with the spice profile) and Pumking (with the buttery, whipped cream finish....without overdoing it as I feel Pumking sort of does). I will definitely be ordering more of this in the future. Seek it out!"

"O - Excellent imperial pumpkin. Nails a nice balance, isn't too heavy, and comes off as natural. This is what an imperial pumpkin should taste like!"

"Picked this up on a brewery tour the day after it was bottled (8/16). One of the spiciest pumpkin beers I've tasted, tasted like a delicious, mildly boozy, pumpkin pie. Had it with dinner, but it was definitely more of a dessert or sipping beer as it is intensely pumpkin-pie like. Definitely wish I had picked up multiple bottles, highly recommend if you can get your hands on one."
"O: This one is overall OK, but I deducted significant points for the off flavor. The only think I know to cause this would be oxidization, but I know that it's fresh, and one wouldn't think there would be high-temperature exposure between the brewery & the tasting room, as they're literally connected. Either way, this had promise but didn't deliver. I did buy a bottle, so if it is significantly different I will update this review."

"The aroma is very spicy with pumpkin, cardboard, and caramel malt. The appearance is amber with an average head. The taste is a little like the aroma but has an astringent bitterness but it is definitely a pumpkin. The mouth feel is average. Overall I like this beer but I want more pumpkin and less bitter."
""
"O - 4.0 - I first drank this fall seasonal the June after its release. It wasn't even fresh but still tasted fine. Then I had it fresh the following release and it wasn't much different. Then that one again the following March. I swear a bit of age actually makes it better, counterintuitively. It isn't one I'd want to session all night given the specialty flavors involved, but as a special seasonal, a 375ml is nice. Usually I'm a few sips in to a pumpkin beer before it starts to feel like a chore to get through it, but this one is nice. April 2013 bottle confirms that this keeps getting better with age."

"O-different. Not what I usually drink but something that's good with food and desert. Spices are a bit overbearing but blend in well. Nice beer. "

"Poured from 750ml bomber into a tulip glass. Pours burnt orange along with a frothy off-white head that laces decent throughout. Aromas are crisp toast and caramel, vanilla and toffee, biscuits, and pumpkin puree, a bit sweeter with decent pie spice. Flavors of allspice, nutmeg, mild vanilla, and some caramel. Some crispness. Fairly balanced for a sweeter beer, spice and vanilla, sweet malts. Finish is nice, gentle spice and sweetness linger. It’s not complex, but it’s tasty, sweet slanted without being anywhere near cloying. Fairly balanced and quite a smooth pumpkin ale."

"I like when my pumpkin beers aren't overwhelmed by spices and this one fits the bill. It's nothing mind blowing, but a good large format pumpkin ale to share."
"Flavor keeps up with the nose. A great balance between the pumpkin and spice. I get more clove in the taste balanced by brown sugar."
""
""
""
""
"Poured a hazy orange. A decent dense foamy white head. Aroma is a nice blend of fall spices - nutmeg, cinnamon, etc. The flavor is more of the same but just bolder and with the added hint of pumpkin. Very creamy and tasty. This is EASILY one of my favorite pumpkin beers. Carbonation is spot on and it has a nice balanced mouthfeel. The 9% is hidden amazingly well making this very drinkable. Would LOVE to try this again sometime. Yes that is a trade offer."

"Overall: Hands down, the best tasting pumpkin beer i've had. Doesn't taste artificial. It's not too over the top. And it's balanced as hell as far as the pumpkin flavor and the spice. A very enjoyable beer."
""

""

"O: a good pumpkin ale that could use a creamier body and more depth of flavor. Still, it smells great and is tasty."
"O - Overall holy cow is this spectacular. Hands down my favorite tasting pumpkin beer. Excellent flavours with a very nice appearance and nose. Its worth saying again that the flavours are spectactular. Really wish I could get my hands on another bottle of this stuff."
"Overall, this is a fantastic pumpkin ale. Just the right amount o spice and pumpkin. Not too much of either which I feel is the case with most. Very well balanced and tasty."
"O: A really good pumpkin beer. If more pumpkin beers were made like this one, I would actually seek them out and buy them..."
"O: CCB's Good Gourd is one of the best pumpkin beers around. If readily available in my market, this would be a constant in my fridge during the crisp, cool autumn days. Easily recommended, and absolutely worth seeking out for the pumpkin beer aficionado and general beer advocate alike."

"i still have a bottle of this that i plan on sharing for thanksgiving. high alcohol makes it good to share but still not too high that finishing most of the bottle (for me) wouldn't be hard either. another great ccb brew."

"honestly speaking this is the best pumpkin beer i've had this year and i've had way too many."

"Overall great, one of the best pumpkin beers I've had. Nice pumpkin flavors, earthy hops and spices, great malt balance, great pumpkin pie."
""
""
""
"O: All in all, this is another representation of why I love CCB. They took the style they set out to brew, and made an above standard representation of it. If you like pumpkin / spiced beers, then you should definitely give this bad boy a try."

"o - overall, i think i may have just tasted the best pumpkin beer i've ever tried. it really is phenomenal...but if you don't like pumpkin beers, don't expect to like this one. here's hoping i see it again soon."
"Overall -- This must be my favorite pumpkin beer to date. Just amazing how well balanced and nuanced it is while still tasting like pumpkin and spice. It's the beer I wish Pumking was."
"O- Very well done. Not quite able to top Schlafly, but this is a top contender. The way the beer feels and the way the ingredients are so individualistic while still forming a unique, lingering blend is incredible. Would come back to this again and again in season..."
"A very nice, somewhat spice-forward, pumpkin ale with a tasty creamy vanilla character also."
"O: Definitely one of the better Pumpkin Ales! Complex, malty, bready, caramelly and filled with pumpkin flavors. Spicing is mild and artfully done, only lending support to the brew as a whole. Well done!"
"O- Overall, Good Gourd is a really tasty pumpkin ale. I would put it in the upper tier of pumpkin beers. Recommended!"
"O – Just jumped Pumking as my favorite pumpkin ale. Excellent all around here."
"Pours an orange amber with a one finger head that sticks around in my bruery tulip. Aromas of pumpkin spice, cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla and a bit of ginger. Taste follows nose, really creamy, smooth and easy to drink. This is a great pumpkin beer, I could drink it all year!"
"This is a medium bodied brew that is quite creamy with a light level of carbonation. There are lots of fruity alcohol notes and a solid balance of modest spices that keep everything in check. For an 8.5% offering, the alcohol is well integrated. Overall this is a solid take on the style, not the best I have had bu tone that is worth trying at least once... or twice."
"O: I'd go B+ or A- on this one.  Mainly because I don't like pumpkins.  It's Bette than the artificial flavored ones for sure though."
"I picked this up in secret halloween '11, thanks Michael. I poured from a bomber into a snifter, deep orange pour, big white head. The aroma is strong with pumpkin pie spice, especially allspice. The flavor is in good balance, good amounts of pumpkin, and spices are mixed, it has a dry finish. The body is medium, light alcohol notes, good carbonation. One of the better pumpkin beers I have ever had."
"O: very drinkable, as it's smooth but not ridiculously sweet at all. Favorite pumpkin beer that I've had so far. This was $8 at the brewery and a couple of places around Gainesville. I'm picking up another bottle."
"I'll be looking for more bottles, or i just will have to wait til next year."
"Appears as a dark orange and with a finger thick head. A decent amount of nutmeg on the nose. Tastes lighter than the average pumpkin ale. Is refreshing and could be a great session beer. Nutmeg hits on the back end of the tongue. It’s a faint amount and definitely not overpowering. The mouthfeel enhances the nutmeg notes. A great overall pumpkin beer that doesn't overdo it."
"O - Excellent aroma flavor. Fits perfectly in his style. Very pumpkin flavor with his popular ingredients. A pumpkin beer that I could recommend!"
"Overall, a bit dissapointing. I was hoping this would rival pumking or TREAT, but it doesn't quite make it there."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation being moderate. Overall I thought it was a fantastic pumpkin beer. The spices weren't overdone and the sweetness definitely helped smooth them out even more. Very nice pumpkin pie like flavor to it overall. Definitely one of the best pumpkin beers I've had, but it doesn't quite beat out Pumking for me."
"Really well done Pumpkin Ale - CC just continues to impress. Glad I picked up two of these."
"Overall: There was something about this beer that struck me as off. The feel was a little bit light, and there is some pumpkin residue flavor that is not appealing"
"Overall: A really nice change from the pumpkin spice beers. I really enjoyed this."
"That said, it still falls short of my top tier. Frog's Hollow Double Pumpkin by Hoppin Frog and Devious Imperial Pumpkin by Bethlehem Brew Works tie for top honors among pumpkin ales. But Good Gourd ranks a solid #3, snugly above ST PumKing and DFH Punkin. Cheers!"
"Medium bodied and fairly balanced. Easily drinkable and not boozy at all coming in at 9%."
"Drinks a little bit bigger than your typical pumpkin ale. Decent beer but nothing that really sets it apart from the others."
"It pours orange in color leaving very little head and tracing. Cinammon and nutmeg spices are prevelant in the smell. Very well balanced between sweetness and tart. Tastes like a liquified pumpkin pie with a slight alcohol aftertaste. For an 8%, the alcohol aftertaste isn't inappropriate or intruding. Nice warm feeling in the stomach! Try it!"
"O: This may be the best pumpkin beer I've had. Smuttynose is excellent, but slightly too hoppy, Pumking has just a little too much breadyness and sweetness, This is balanced, delicious and has a touch of what makes each other pumpkin ale great in it."
"O - A nice beer for a pumpkin beer. Good flavor, not cloying. Would drink this occassionally without a problem."
"Pours a pretty brown amber with nice clarity. Thin finger of foam leaving very little lacing. The nose hits with nutmeg, a dry vegetal pumpkin quality, cinnamon candy and baking spices - it is very much like pumpkin pie, spices are prevalent with almost a creamy pie crust scent. The nose is what gets me - multilayered complex chocolate notes - this beer looks like Theobroma and drinks like what Theobroma wishes it could be. Straight pumpkin pie in the mouth, full of spices and rich pumpkin flavor that finishes with nice carbonation and a dry vegetal quality at the end. Almost a touch astrigent on the finish and not a huge fan of the vegetal quality it presents but this is by far and away the best pumpkin beer i have had."
"O - A very nice pumpkin beer, one of the better examples I've had. Not too sweet, not overly spiced. Just a nicely balanced flavor profile that has the spice elements of a good pumpkin beer in combination with more of an earthy pumpkin profile."
"O - Solid pumpkin brew but not as good as my favorite, Schlafly Pumpkin. That said, I would def have it again and it's on the better side of my experiences with this style. Recommend."
"Overall, this is a great pumpkin ale. Definitely top 5 for me, and one of the most noticeably complex pumpkins that I've had. On a side note, I noticed the bottle was a little better than on tap, and definitely better served a little warmer."
"O: This is definitely the best pumpkin beer I've had to date. The pumpkin was purest in this one and nicely integrated in with the spices."
"On tap at Vine & Barley. Umm Pumpkin!!! This is why I love the fall and Cigar City. Its good to drink a beer, where I taste pumpkin and not a lot of spices. Now there are some spices (cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla), but just enough to enhance the flavor of the pumpkin. There is nothing artificial about this beer. I can and will drink a lot of this beer. Great job, Joey and Wayne."
"Overall this is a very good Pumpkin beer for me. Definitely on the sweeter side like many Cigar City beers tend to be, so if you are opposed to the sweeter end of beers, this may not be for you. That being said this is still quite impressive, recommended and worth seeking out for fans of this style."
"Overall: A good pumpkin beer. A bit light on the spices and lighter in body than I prefer in a pumpkin beer. Very smooth, and very drinkable."
"Medium body with moderate carbonation"
"Pours a moderate orange-copper with a good off-white head. Decent retention and some spotty lacing on the way down. The nose carried a lot of squash and pumpkin with a bit of cinnamon and miscellaneous spice in the background. The flavor didn't have quite as much spice and really focused on the squash element. Not too sweet, which was nice. Chewy medium body with moderate carbonation and a bit of spice zest in the finish. Good brew."
"Pours a nice copper-orange with a thin white head that settles to a slight haze and ring. Nice pumpkin aromas mixed with brown sugar and the usual Pumpkin Pie spices. Moderately sweet, the brown sugar/molasses character comes out nicely. Taste is similar to the nose, but with a very pronounced pumpkin flavor. This is probably the most """pumkin-y""" Pumpkin Beer I've had in a while, it's definitely more pumpkin then spice. Mouthfeel is smooth, slightly creamy, with a touch-over-medium body and good carbonation. Overall one of my new favorite Pumpkin beers, love that you can really taste the pumpkin!"
"Overall: A very good pumpkin ale. I had the pleasure of drinking this with my wife's best friend. She enjoyed this ale a lot too. I am impressed with every Cigar City brew I try. Whatever it is they do there I hope they never stop! This is my second favorite pumpkin ale next to Dogfish Heads. Cheers!"
"O: Well, this taste pretty much like pumking to me. I can tell it's high quality, but I'm still not on board pumpkin beer should be anything but a stout."
"Overall I really enjoyed this. The closest pumpkin Ale I can compare it to is Weyerbacher imperial pumpkin ale which I have not had since last year but I really enjoyed that beer. I like pumpkin ales a lot but after having a few pumple Drumkin , this just blows it out of the water and I had thought it was only mediocre on the low side. Good Gourd should probably be renamed Great Gourd? or maybe that is for the sequel that has been aged in bourbon barrels."
"The CPJ"
"Full body, lightish effervescence. Slighty drying finish with a hatsh, almost peppery burn on the tip of the tongue. Nutmeg perhaps? Not up to the usual standards of CCB."
"get you some!! PaaaaHHH"
"delicious pumpkin beer but it is a bit bitter in the finish, the smell however is totally where it's at. love cigar city beer."
"Pours a hazy reddish orange with one finger of cream colored head, settles to a thin ring, couple thin rings left on the glass. Smell: pretty substantial cooked (canned) pumpkin, sweet... a little butterscotch, nutmeg and allspice, with mild toasted and twangy grain in the back. Really mild note of clove. Taste: pretty close to a liquid bite of pumpkin pie with a little whipped cream on it. The pumpkin is the star but with ample doses of nutmeg, allspice, and cinnamon, and a little clove in the finish. Mild spicy + earthy hopping (get the impression of a belgian pale -ish base beer) mixes really well with the pie spices. Very good."
"Man just a lovely pumpkin ale here. Very round, soft, and velvety on the palate. So soft and feminine in mouthfeel and flavors. Things meld greatly with out being overly spicy. Cinnamon, cardamon, nutmeg, quince, clove, pumpkin flavors, some graham cracker, all spice, nutty flavors and more. Just a fantastic pumpkin, rivals pumking....it's a close one."
"O-as far as pumpkin ales go, i've only ever liked pumpkin and pumpking. i've now added good gourd. in fact, this puts punkin to shame. its such a complex and balanced blend of great flavors."
"Thanks again to Bryanole for shooting these my way. I have a couple of extra bottles for the fall football tailgating season that will come in handy."
"Overall - The best pumpkin ale I've had to date, but not perfect. The smell is wonderful but the taste is not quite as good."
"Pours a deep amber with a one finger creamy head. The aroma is typical pumpkin pie spices like cardamom, cinnamon, all spice, etc. There is also a nice pumpkin/squash aroma behind the spices. The taste is heavy on the spices and I get a good amount of whipped-cream. The alcohol is hidden well for a 9% beer. The mouthfeel is medium with medium to high carbonation. I'd prefer this to be a little less carbonated. Overall, the second best Pumpkin ale I have ever had. I think this would benefit from some aging and I will try to review this some time next year. Highly recommended!"
"For a pumpkin beer this has very good head retention and carbonation, though the carb is slightly loopy. Nice half a finger white head. Orange, auburn in color, slightly opaque, it looks warm and fall like. Full aroma of cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice. Really nice fresh spice pop, not muted at all. There is also some toasty malted aroma. Off the bat I can taste warm and toasted malts, some roasted squash flavor coupled with a good hit of vanilla. Mid palate all the way to the finish is freshly ground pumpkin pie spices. A tad cloying but not really too sweet just a really full bodied, full flavored pumpkin ale. I wish this beer had some more true pumpkin flavor, but otherwise this is very, very, good. This is so close to my favorite but Pumking still rains supreme for me."
"A good pumpkin ale, not great but surely didn't disappoint."
"O: Very nice example of a pumpkin ale. Best I have had."
"D - pretty solid pumpkin ale here. As mentioned, good flavor profile but a little lighter on the nose and palate than I would have hoped."
"Overall, this is my favorite pumpkin ale of the season. At $11.99 per bottle, its a bit price to get again. Well worth trying it once though - loved it."
"--Overall this will be a repeat buy. So far the best release of 2011 for my palate. Full bodied, creamy, with spice and a REAL pumpkin flavor. Delicious..."
"O: I think this is a solid pumpkin brew, but the aroma falls way short. I would put this one above average, but not on the level of pumking, IMHO. Skal."
"Overall: Excellent beer overall. One of the best pumpkin ales on the market. Like almost everything from Cigar City, I highly recommend this one."
" highly spiced but yet not overpowering as you see a lot with these pumpkins. nutmeg, and cinnamon and a good amount of fresh grass or even a tree like smell to it. Lots of spice running through it though and I could pick up even on some apple in there as well. I thought the aroma was very well put together overall. a nice grainy almost yeast like back to it which really served to lighten it up. This was followed by loads of fall spices, cinnamon, nutmeg, lots of spiced apple, just a good all around mix. There was a noticeable hoppy presence and this definitely could not be hidden. Great finish"
"Thanks to digita7693 for bringing a growler up to Jax the same day for tasting fresh from the Tap Room. ~9/2010"
"D: It's good, but in the tasting it was lower-end, and out of what I've tried in the style, it's near the middle. I'd skip it."
"D - Easy to put down a few. Not something easily said of many pumpkin beers."
"drinkability: great pumpkin beer, probably one of the best I have had. Amazing nose and flavor."
"D- Great pumpkin ale and will revisit when able!"
"Awesome pumpkin. One of the best I've found."
"Would LOVE to try this again sometime..."
"The ever so controversial pumpkin ales. What to do with them? Had the """IPA""" at the tasting room. Pumpkin ales are very up and down and are ususally very pricey. Well this guy was way up!. Poured a very nice fall brown color. With a medium density white head. For me CCB does the best job balancing beers flavors. This pumpkin was balnced in the hops, spice, and pumpkin flavors. My favorite pumpkin. Dont try to convince me otherwise."
"D: This is an absolute winner of a pumpkin ale. Finally a pumpkin beer that rivals pumpking. I hope they end up bottling this one. I would love to stock up every fall."
"Medium body with low carbonation. A very nice pumpkin ale."
"D - Considering my many other experiences with Cigar City, this is a surprisingly subtle and understated brew. It was quite enjoyable, but it was quickly forgotten after moving on to the next few brews. I heard the test batch was quite different, but I gotta review the beer I try! In any case, it's definitely one of the better pumpkin beer offerings, but I think I prefer Pumking a little bit (and Flossmoor's extinct Big Black Pumpkin, of course)."
"D: Pumpkin ales are sort of hard to do, since the spicing can really mess them up. I'm happy that CCB has managed to keep things within reason and make for an enjoyable beer."
"Bottle courtesy of JRedner. Pours a golden caramel color with thin white head. Aroma is pumpkin, spice, nutmeg, cream. Flavor is much of the same with some stronger pumpkin and spice notes, heavy cream flavors, slightly boozey. Generally medium body with a pleasing herb/spice finish. This was an amazing pumpkin beer and likely the best that I have had."
"D: I tasted this one when it was first finished and the booze could really be detected. Since it has aged a bit, the alcohol flavors have died and the pumpkin, spice, and buttery goodness have come together to create one wonderful brew."
