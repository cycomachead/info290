"Mouthfeel is somewhat rich but there is a significant alcohol """burn""".  Enjoyable on a cold night, but the alcohol could be more toned down."
""
""
"Very tasty and satisfying beer! Like many other high abv offerings from Flying Dog, you can really taste and feel the alcohol  on this one. While the finish can be a bit harsh, it's still very drinkable. The pumpkin is just right, not cloying or artificial tasting."
""
"Overall - A pretty good pumpkin beer and much better than i expected... recommended"
""
""
""
"O: Very different from other pumpkin beers because the flavors are not to much on the pumpkin side, not a bad beer at all, I have had better from this brewery though."

"How to describe the worse thing I have ever tired.. How about someone threw up a pumpkin pie on a pine tree.. ? I don't mean to be rude.. But it was literally the worst beer I have ever had. If you like Pumpkin and you like VERY Hoppy IPAs.. then I guess you might like this obination. If you lean towards liking more malty beers, and not a big fan of pumpkin stay far.. far.. far away. As you should Fear it."

"Another fairly enjoyable Flying Dog effort that was by no means the brewery's best beer but a good one nonetheless, particularly because it was such a big, well flavoured beer that was very nice to sit and sip away at. Perhaps the alcohol content could have been better hidden but it didn't take much away from the taste and it was well worth trying without truly exciting."

"opaque amber, didnt think the head was there until it was overflowing my tulip glass...big pumpkin pie aroma, heavy spice.taste is like burnt pumpkin pie. roasted malt is almost overwhelming the pumpkin flavor. i almost taste the bready crust of the pie. again, the roasted malt too quickly takes over the pumpkin flavor in every sip. this is a pumpkin stout in my opinion, and i dont much like it."
""
"This beer is like Christmas met Halloween and had a beer baby and it was good, spicy sweet and oh, so tasty.  I think you'll like this beer a lot if you have any sort of sweet tooth.  Don't get me wrong, this isn't candy and it doesn't taste like it.  Its aroma is contradictory, slightly sour but with a nice whiff of nutmeg and maple sugar oh and pumpkin of course.  It tastes like maybe a brown ale and grandma's pumpkin pie mashed together.  Goes great with cold weather."
""
"I'm usually not a homer, but this beer was there. This beer pours a very dark brown almost a deep red body, off white/khaki head. Looks pretty legit. The aroma is airy with pumpkin spices. Nut meg, Cinnamon with a hint of chocolate and toasted malts. Very pleasing to my nose! The taste"
""
""
""
"Never ever have I seen a pumpkin ale this dark, wow!, pours a dark color with a tinge of deep orange red trying to peek through. Aroma is of pumpkin pie and spices and some sweetness. The alcohol bites you at first and then a pumpkin spice flavor comes through. The alcohol continues to burn ever so slightly. The flavor is decent but the burn is amazing. Decent balance of flavors and overall(besides the alcohol) a pretty mild mannered beer"
"O: better than I expected - the brown ale was well-suited to the pumpkin bread flavors and spice; rich and warming seasonal treat"

"T: Pumpkin puree with lots of warming cinnamon and ground clove. Dark espresso-extract like malt flavor. Lots of roasted chocolate malts as well. Slightly sweet ginger and pine hopping, resinous caramel. Walnut bitterness. Bitter and roast malt forward (4/5)."
""
""
""
"Rough taste on your first bottle, but a clean finish...the next 5 go down well. Good, crisp taste."
""
"O: This is not just a good pumpkin beer, this is a great imperial. If you gave this to me with no pretext I would think it was just a really good imperial IPA."
""
""
""
"very bitter, lacks the palate taste i was looking for, also the alcohol is very dry not very smooth or soothing."
""
""
""
"Heavy Cinnamon taste but a decent beer"
"O:  Good stuff.  One of the better ones that I've had.  My third of the year, but my first full bottle (the second was the Schlafly Pumpkin and the first was Pumking)."
""
""
"A nice slightly bitter """IPA""" as in imperial pumpkin ale!  Nice molasses color and similar smell and taste.  No real hints of pumpkin to me but if i had to drink a beer, i would enjoy this one."

"I'm getting a light pumpkin taste, its good but it has a strong sour note. It has fresh fruity notes and over all its a good brew. I would still like to see the pumpkin flavor jacked up a notch."
""

"O- This one nearly hit on all cylinders, but the overpowering sweetness made this one difficult to finish. Other than that, everything else was on point"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I have a nice buzz, so now I just need something else to rinse this taste out of my mouth"
"In summary, fantastic beer, but if you are driving, watch your intake because the ABV is twice your average seasonal. Or, have a designated driving and get ripped!"
""
""
""
"O: some odd disjointed notes, but drinkable, and excellent handling of such a high abv"
"An interesting effort, though the spicing is a bit heavy-handed. Looks good, with a nicely rounded aroma of malt, pumpkin and spice. The flavour is OK but rather bitter, with a herbal quality making itself felt. Body is a little insubstantial for the ABV. This brew packs plenty of charisma but lacks balance. Worth trying, but probably not one that I'd grab again."
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a dark, vibrant, crystal clear, toffee-brown coloring with a thin, sparse, very light tan surface coat of head. Great looking brew. Aromas of pumpkin, candied sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, bubblegum, and toasted grains. Very rich, but avoids any heaviness in the nose. Flavors are roast forward, with a rich, tangy caramel and toffee blend leading a roast pumpkin character and a healthy kick of booze. Very rich throughout, and there are hints of chocolate throughout the palate, as well. The spices fall a bit out of focus, allowing the rich, sweet, and heavy characteristics to run rampant on the tongue. Heavy, on a smooth, mid-body, with a tangy sweet and rich aftertaste. This one stays strong throughout, even into the slightly cloying, slightly boozy finish. Slight warming as you drink. Solid flavors, big beer."

"Overall: This is pretty standard run of the mill pumpkin ale. It has some flavor to it, but the alcohol is obvious."
""
""
""
"O: Overall the alcohol contributes some spicenss and dry warmth, but also overshadows at times. Pumpkin quality could of been deeper. The alcohol soon settles and provides a sweet pumpkin pie spice warmth."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I think this would be better toned down a notch on the alcohol. There are good spice flavors on top of a brown ale back that I enjoy. The ending dropped the rating a notch."

"The hoppiness and bitterness really separates this beers from other pumpkin ales. This is really bitter and for serious beer lovers that can take the bitterness in this."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I'm glad to have picked up a six-pack of this stuff. I wasn't even aware of this beer until tonight, and though I turned down a few other pumpkin ales (there are a lot nowadays) in favor of this label, I'm glad I chose this one."
""

"Overall: incredible purchase and best one of the night here at TJ Finleys, thank you for offering this gem. Salud!"

"Dark amber in color, small head. Head gone in flash. Small wisps of lace also gone in an instant. Traditional pumpkin spice in the bouquet, not too strong just right. Good spice level up front in the taste, alcohol on the back end going down. Too strong, kills the enjoyability, nice mouth feel though. Getting better taste as it warms up here."
""
""
"O: Interesting take on an often underperforming style IMO. Spice profile is a bit off the beaten track and the hop factor is ramped up a bit. Not up there with the best I've had, but not bad. Worth a try, especially if you're a fan of the style."
"Some reviewers complain about the abundant hops, but I find that a huge asset in a pumpkin beer (a style I tend not to prefer). It's superior to Dog Fish Head's Pumpkin, which is overly spiced, way too sweet and tastes like a ginger snap cookie."
"Otherwise stay clear. There are more friendly pumpkin beers out there."
""
"Overall after smelling this one thought eh average but after sipping on it found myself enjoying the fullness of it. Not sure why the nose is not bigger might pick more of these up for a heavier pumpkin brew."
""
""
"Overall, a bit harsh in the flavors and mouthfeel but the smell is pleasant, especially as it warms. Strength of the brew is hidden well, though"
""
"It's rare that I'm really disappointed with a pumpkin ale, but this one just doesn't work. The only thing going for it is its unusual appearance--a dark brown color with a beautiful red thrown in there too and a head that displays fairly poor retention. From there, things go down hill. The smell consists of roasted malt and pumpkin, with the malt distracting rather than complimenting the pumpkin. In the taste, the roasted malt, pumpkin, alcohol, and spices just don't work and leave a bittersweet mess. A cross between a porter and a pumpkin ale may have sounded good on paper, but I found this disappointing and one of the worst tasting pumpkin ales I've had despite the nice appearance and mouthfeel."

"An imperial pumpkin...these are becoming popular. The beer is a rich brown with a thin tan head...soapy. Clear. The smell is of pie spice and booze. Malt comes out in a big way...slightly roasted, and a little breads. No pumpkin in the smell. In the taste, however, there are pumpkin favors, nestled within a serious alcohol warming, big spice bite, and malty sweetness. Full and thick in body, huge booziness. Long and spicy finish. Great pumpkin beer."
""
""
""
"O: This reminds me that while there are a few rock-solid beers from this brewery (like Raging Bitch), some of their other stuff is painfully mediocre. Like this - actually, no, it kind of sucks. Will not be buying again."
"Overall a nice variation of the typical pumpkin beers with the roasted malt"
""

"O_A good but not great pumpkin beer. Still can't be the king."
""

"Pumpkin beers are one of my very favorite styles, second only to a good west coast or Imperial IPA.  There are so many great pumpkin beers out there; Some very mild and not really pumpkiny at all. Some are way overdone to the point where we must ask ourselves if they are beer at all or are they liquefied pumpkin pie? And then there is The Fear: A perfectly balanced pumpkin ale that is deceptively smooth and delightfully drinkable despite the 9% ABV. The traditional pumpkin and spices are definitely all there, but subtle enough to allow the taste of an American Strong ale to come through. Bravo to Flying Dog for making a truly fantastic fall seasonal!"
""
"Mouthfeel is full and creamy, with a little tingle from the booze and hops. It seems a bit thin though."
"Bought 6 pack @ Rite Aid Liquors Westminster MD. Sorry to say that I've missed this one before. Poured into Blue Moon glass. (I know, sorry-first thing I found) Shows small head on top deep amber black pour. Lace follows glass down; smell is least pleasant part of beer; swamp water with spice! However, things get better as beer has warm spicy mouthfeel, but individual spices don't stand out and overwhelm...I think cinnamon, coriander, nutmeg? Has an almost gummy consistency as you drink it down. Hides the high ABV well; you know something is there, but the monster doesn't exactly jump out of the bushes, you know what I mean? Tastes better as you go-although there's a bit of an acidic aftertaste. All in all, very good as a onesie; don't know about multiples."

"D: This was not one of the better pumpkin ales. The scent and body were ok, but the taste wasn't ok. The finish was rough too, so it was not easy to drink. Not recommended."
"Overall, what we liked best about this beer was the robustness of flavoring. While that central bite was certainly overpowering at times, at no point was the drinker bored. At first, things did feel one-dimensional, but with time and warmth the ending of the swallow flourished with a mix of bitters and spices. This made for an ultimately interesting drink. This beer does not land well within the stylistic guidelines, as much of anything pumpkin is lost, but it is definitely one of the more forward beers for Flying Dog."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – A rather nice roasty at first and sweeter and balanced pumpkin flavor in this one. A good example of an imperial pumpkin brew and one to try if you have the chance."
""
"I would not go out of my way to buy this again at $2.50 bottle, but I also would not refuse one if offered."
""
"This isn't really the best Imperial Pumpkin Ale I've come across. Too bitter for the style, in my opinion. I was hoping for more, considering Flying Dog really excels with their bigger beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this was a pretty big miss for me. It was drinkable when it was on the colder side but as it warmed the flavor profile got spice heavy and earthy/woody/roasty for some reason. The base beer is caught between an amber and a porter which just doesn't work. I was actually expecting there would be more pumpkin than I tasted based on the nose. Pass for me."
""
""
""
""
""
"A solid beer overall. I tend to prefer the darker pumpkin beers and this one fits the bill pretty well. Worth trying."
""
"Pours a clean deep amber to brown-ish in color with a light tan head. In the aroma, sweet pumpkin, cinnamon, allspice, brown sugar, and a small alcohol presence. In the taste, somewhat boozy, small spices, but mostly allspice. A spice like bite and a medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a dry spice and lingering alcohol in the aftertaste. Somewhat boozy, big spices, and sweet to dry flavors."
""
""
""
"The mouth feel is kinda heavy but well carbonated and overall i would put this in the top 10 of pumpkin beers."
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The perfect beer for the day I guess.Poured roasted chesnut color with a tinge of amber,almost no head to speak of.Pumpkin pie spice and big sweet alcohol in the nose,a booze bomb.Spiced with an undelying sweet alcohol element that is omni present,the flavors are not bad with the spice being dominant,the alcohol gets even bigger as the beer warms.There are better imperial pumpkin ales out there that are not as hot,it's not awful though."
""
""
"Medium bodied with more roast and hop bitterness than the atom suggests. Roasted malt presence Long with dry, earthy hops and toasted pumpkin seed. This dry roasted character takes away from the better qualities of the beer in my opinion. There is still a stron zesty autumnal spice profile but most of the pumpkin pie sweetness found in the aroma is overpowered. Some caramel malt sweetness along with cinnamon, brown sugar and clove with some nutmeg and pumpkin puree buried underneath. The high ABV is very well masked but I wish it was better balanced."
""
""
"Not my favorite pumpkin ale out there, but this just might earn a spot in the top 5. This brew doesn't knock you over the head with pumpkin flavor, but how well Flying Dog managed to execute all the other flavors (especially the nice hop bite in the finish) makes this definitely worth at least a try. It's like someone mixed a pumpkin ale with a harvest ale and then added some more hops. Which isn't a bad thing."
""
"Full bodied feel, spot on carbonation at a medium level. Slightly drying with spice and malt notes lingering into the finish. Overall, this is a nice take on a dark pumpkin ale. Big and tasty, worthy of provoking the fear."
""
""
"Overall I thought this beer was good. I think it could have used more pumpkin to be called a pumpkin ale, but it was tasty."
"This pumpkin ale has strong pumpkin spicing without leaving behind the beer aspect. It has a touch of smoke and a hop touch that add to the complexity. The alcohol is apparent, so be ready for the 9% abv, though it doesn't interfere in the beer's aspects. Not quite the pumpkin pie beer that others are, this one has the strong pumpkin spicing, but has a unique character to it, as well, that makes this one worth trying, and enjoyable. Well-done!"
"The body is medium, and pretty full at that. Crispness is light and constant, balancing nicely with an equally constant smoothness. Dryness pulls into the finish."
""
""
"Overall: Great pumpkin beer! Was thoroughly surprised with this. Creative, bold and something I expected from Flying Dog."
"A different approach to a pumpkin ale, works pretty well. Sweet like some pumpkin ales, but the smokey and bitter notes take it somewhere else. I like this pretty good and would have it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Surprisingly light for 9% abv but still on the heavy side of being medium bodied. Lots of spice with a big roasted malt profile and a nice pumpkin flavor to it. Unfortunately the spice really dominates this beer to the point of lingering in the mouth. The nice roastiness of the malt however compliments the pumpkin pretty well. A bit of a sloppy beer but a pretty good effort and i complement the brewery for using this years fresh pumpkins. Could use some work but drinkable and overall tasty enough."
"O - This dark pumpkin is hard to compare to most others in the style. The roasty char character pairs wonderfully with the pumpkin and spices. This is a great imperial pumpkin I will seek out again."
""
""
"An amazing take on the style very unique in comparison to most. With that being said its not the best but very complex and still an amazing beer."
""
""
"O- A tasty pumpkin beer but the burnt flavor brings it down some. Worth trying and I will pick this up again."
""
"Overall can't say it's the worst pumpkin beer I had but it kind of makes me regret buying two since I could have had another """Devious"""."
""
""
""
""
"An rather poor attempt at a Pumpkin Stout/Porter. The booze is pretty apparent. The dark qualities are not rich enough. Meh."
""
"O: This could have been a good pumpkin ale if it wasn't hindered by flavors of alcohol in the taste."
""
"O: I really wish that there was just a hint more pumpkin flavor/aroma and that the alcohol was a little more well hidden - I like the fact that there is very little sweetness to this pumpkin. Not the easiest to drink and I will likely skip this one next year. I would describe this more as a fall/autumn beer than a pumpkin beer."
""
"Mouthfeel is nice- velvety full bodied, light soft carbonation, a little chewy. Good but nothing amazing."
""
""
""
""
"Had on cask at Max's in Baltimore. Love me some pumpkin beers.. but this one was just about average beer. I think the lack of carbonation kind of killed the overall appeal for me, I would be curious to try a non-cask version of this. Mouthfeel and body are a little off, the usual nutmeg and allspice and cinnamon tastes, but the alcohol is very prominent and just doesn't seem well balanced. Worthy of a try, but just average in my book when compared to the elites (Greater Pumpkin, Punkin, et al)."
"O- Overall this is a solid pumpkin ale, one of the best i've had. I would highly reccomend this."
"O: The Fear is aptly named. Strong, dark, spicey, it chases you along the whole drink. The alcohol and pumpkin work well together on the finish."
"I wanted to give this one an overall of 3.8, but I rounded it up to 4.0 by default of the rating options. This one is real fun, I LOVE the description on the label about fear and Halloween, really makes for an exciting journey into my stomach. The main thing that stands out in, or maybe I should say Jumps out, of this Pumpkin Ale for me is the extreme spice received when washing it down. I personally enjoy it, and the slightly higher alcohol content helps make it something more special and provides a pre-winter warming bite to it. It has delightful mouth feel, very frothy and sort of thick, coats the inside of your mouth with all that autumn spice. I drank this with a Pumpkin whoopie Pie from Whole Foods and I tell you, the combination of the pumpkin dessert washed down by the Fear was so delightful I almost keeled over with joy! I think this is one of the BEST pumpkin beers to drink with pumpkin related desserts (cookies, pound cakes, pumpkin butter battered croissants)seriously, drink this one with your favorite pumpkin sweets!"
""
"On the palate it’s more of the same, again, cinnamon, again vanilla, darker malts, some of the 9% rearing its head, yeah a wee bit boozy, but I tend to like boozy, and hey it is 9%. Tastes sort of like Double Bastard, infused with a hint and a half of fall spices and with less hops and less body. Not really getting much actual pumpkin flavor or character."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Not a normal time for a pumpkin ale, but really enjoyable and drinkable."
""
""
""
"O: This is one of my favorite pumpkin beers. It is a solid fall beer."
"Poured a very dark brown nearly opaque but not quite as dark as a stout. Very little visible carbonation but can be seem bubbling at the top. Small off-white head with decent clinging. Smells strongly of nutmeg, spice, and caramel, not overly noticeable pumpkin smell. This is more of a fall spice beer than typical pumpkin ales. Definitely a warming spiced flavor that reminds me of a spiced pumpkin coffee drink more than pie. Strong but not overly boozy alcohol. This is a nice alternative to other pumpkin beers. I would go back to this next fall."
""
""
""
""
""
"An interesting pumpkin beer, lots of spice and a multi-dimensional pumpkin flavor. The spices and sweetness are good. Not my favorite, not entirely suited to my tastes but I still appreciate some of the complexities here."
""
""
""
""
""
"o - Overall I thought this was a really good pumpkin ale, and was really easy to drink for 9% ABV. Loads of cinnamon in the taste, would definitely order it again sometime."
""
""
""
""
"Actually got this right as it kicked, but the bottom of the barrel was still good. Poured a dark chestnut brown, hazy, with a large, rocky, tan head. Aroma of grains and pumpkin pie spice; quite earthy. Taste more of the spice than the pumpkin, with a good amount of cinnamon, nutmeg, and even a hint of basil, I thought. Thick with malts, and a bit earthy, with some bitterness in the finish. Medium mouthfeel; chewy. Not too bad overall."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"One of the better pumpkin beers I've tried this season. Pours a very dark brown with small beige foam. Picked up some usual pumpkin spices in the aroma(cloves I think) but got a whiff of banana-flavored bubble gum. Taste is a little spicy with hints of graham crackers. Packs a nice alcohol bite and has a tingly mouth-feel."
""
"Taste is only fintly of pumpkin and spice; perhaps the reason for the generally low reviews? Just enough piney hops to balance the sweetness, with none of the metalic taste the is an issue for me in higher alcohol beers."
"A spice bomb of a beer that doesn't taste bad but is in desperate need of depth and subtlety. Pours a very dark brown with a tan head with good retention. Aromas are equal parts roasty, spicy, and pumpkin-packed. The taste, however, beats you over the head with spices. How much cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves can your mouth stand in a single sip? If it weren't for the redemptive roastiness and burst of black licorice that lingers on the immediate finish, I'd consider its flavor to be """below average.""" Fifteen minutes later, my mouth still tastes like I just smoked a pack of Djarum Blacks (clove cigs). As a non-smoker, I don't consider this an endearing quality."
"This was a bit of a mixed bag. I liked the attempt at the complexity and size here but the more aggressive aspects of this (mainly the roast and alcohol) just got to be a bit wearing after a while. It’s not horrible by any means but definitely needs to be toned down a bit to ultimately be more enjoyable."
"Some reviewers complain about the abundant hops, but I find that an asset in a pumpkin beer (a style I tend not to prefer). It's superior to Dog Fish Head's pumpkin, which is overly spiced."
"Appearance is dark brown with an orange hue. There is the aroma of some spice, but there is not a very strong nose to this beer, which is surprising considering it is certainly a BIG beer. The upfront flavor is very bold and is accompanied by a pie spice finish. There is some hop bitterness on the back end as well. Unfortunately, I did not pick up any pumpkin in this beer. This beer is big and bold, however, it suffers because it is a pumpkin ale with no pumpkin taste."
"O -- This is a the worst Imperial Pumpkin Ale I have had and this is number 5, maybe I was spoiled by having Southern Tier, Schlafly, Weyerbacher, and Heavy Sea's. But a crap beer is a crap beer. When your expecting something spectacular and you get this, you get pissed. I am so glad I didn't buy a 6'r of this."
"O -- rarely do I drain-pour something, but this met the bill. I let it rest and warm -- it didn't matter...I'm not a huge fan of pumpkin ales to begin with, but to date they have all been tolerable. This beer was definitely a Halloween trick..."
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest level of carbonation. Overall a very big and bold take on the style. It flirts with disaster as far as being too spiced for my liking but it overall ends up being enjoyable because it is balanced. The aggressive spicing was needed to keep the bold character of this brew in check. While I really appreciate the opportunity to give this one a try, it wasn't easy to finish the full 12oz. It is something that you should try if you get the chance but I think it would be much more enjoyable if it was toned down just a bit."
"Pours a fairly-dark brown color with a light tan head. Moderate lace. Nose brings forward some nice pumpkin spice and a bit of chocolate and roast. The flavor blends the pumpkin and porter characteristics quite well. A bit of booze, though not much. Medium body with good roast and spice. Well done; I like this pumpkin """sub-style.""""
"Beer is medium in body and mildly bitter at the back but the pumpkin flavor comes through well and clear. I enjoy the beer overall and for a pumpkin porter or whatever this is it is quite good. I enjoyed it and would have it again if I were thirsty and the only thing on tap. I'd prefer this to water in a pinch is what I'm saying."
"Overall: Not sure if this is a bad bottle or just doesn't taste good, but I'm not a fan."
"SkÅL!"
"Nearly black in color with brownish hues on the edge of the glass. Poured with a short beige foam that quickly reduced to a soapy cap that drapes sheets of wet lacings on the glass. Thick, creamy, smooth feel. Sweet pumpkin aroma with a lightly roasted malt aroma beneath. Sweet pumpkin flavor up front and into the middle with a floral hop bitterness in tow that continues to grow to the finish. Hop bitterness gives way to a brief pumpkin sweetness at the finish that leaves a lingering hop bitterness. The imperial nature of this beer is very apparent from the middle to the end. This was damn good. A truly unique spin on pumpkin ale."
"O – A little too much up-front spice, not enough actual pumpkin flavor. Not a bad pumpkin beer."
"O - This was a decent pumpkin ale...I'm glad to see Flying Dog branching out with a few new beers...the spices may have been too big and I could taste more alcohol than I'd like"
"The beer pours a brownish amber color with minimal head retention and very little lacing. The nose is spice filled, with considerable clove, allspice and nutmeg. The flavor profile replicaates the nose in this fairly sweet beer, and once again I'm impressed by the amount of spice in the beer. The cask condition tones it down somewhat, but this is still a clove and vanilla driven seasonal from FD. Mouthfeel is fairly soft with the low carbonation, and the alcohol seems a bit more noticeable as well. Nevertheless, this is an spice infused, interesting interpretation of a pumpkin ale, though a little bit goes a long way. I'm thinking one and done with this one."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation being moderate. Overall it was a good beer of the style, but it didn't really bring anything new or outstanding to the table. The spices seemed to dominate a little too much for me as well. A good beer, but not an outstanding one."
"Orange brown pour with a white head. The lacing and retention is great. Pumpkin, vanilla, spices, some roasted malty aroma. Sort of a weird smell. The taste is malty, roasted, sort of boozy. Really no hint of pumpkin or spiciness. Disjointed and like the smell is weird tasting. Light, carbonated well, just not balanced at all. The strange smell and flavor makes this difficult to drink. Disappointed in this."
"O: Overall, this really is one of the better pumpkin ales that I've had. Pumpkin ales aren't among my favorite styles, but I will definitely buy some more of these if I come across them."
"Pours a dark brown color with a nice one finger head. Decent carbonation and lacing. Very dark for a Pumpkin ale. Nose is a lot of spice- pumpkin, nutmeg, cinnamon, allspice. Lacking in complexity and depth for me. Taste is the same- it's decent, just not great- too heavy on the spices, and a little dry and thin as well. There's way too much allspice in this for me- I just couldn't get past that. Feel was better- medium body, but a little too dry and earthy for me. Overall, this was decent, but I wasn't knocked out by it. Glad I got to try it though."
"fairly high. This just has nothing worth talking about."
"O: If you ask me, this is of the best pumpkin ales on the market. No joke!"
"A really great fall beer with a lot of character. I am glad I had a chance to taste it!"
"I can't say that I'll ever cellar a pumpkin beer again. I've heard where spices seem to subside, and I can see first-hand that is true."
"Light in body and full of alcohol flavors. Very dry on the finish and earthy with that same anise that was in the aroma. Pumpkin, all spice, nutmeg, and some other herbal flavors. I like where they are trying to go but just too boozy. More viscosity could have helped."
"I purchased a single bottle at Rodman's DC today. Pours dark brown, with a nice foamy white head. It has a fabulous aroma of pumpkin pie. It has a silky mouth feel, with a nice after taste. Not as good as the DFH Pumpkin, but a great substitute. I would recommend this beer, and would love to try it on tap."
"All that said, I still really enjoyed this beer. Its big and bold, and even though the pumpkin doesn't shine through, it does add a layer of complexity to an already complex beer. I would buy this again."
"Great appearance with a dark ruby brown color. A thin head sits on top of this gorgeous beer. It smells of sweet malts, pumpkin, nutmeg, and cinnamon. The first sip blows me away. It reminds me of pumking with less sweetness and more rich maltiness. As I work my way through the glass, the beer warms showing more pumpkin flavor along with the subtle spices. Nice balance between the pumpkin, malts, and light spice. Overall I found this to be an excellent beer, like a darker pumking perfect for enjoying on a cool fall evening outside around the campfire."
