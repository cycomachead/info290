Taste is good, pumpkin, nutmeg, subtle spices, very easy drinking and refreshing. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall this beer was not overspiced as many pumpkin beers are, tasty and enjoyable.","tone77","Jan 12, 2014"

Do they even make those any more? Color was a cloudy orangish-amber (SRM = > 17, < 22). Nose seemed heavily dosed with nutmeg, although I could also smell cinnamon in the mix. The mouthfeel was kind of thin, but I liked that they had not overdone it with the spices so that the malt had a chance to come through. I was reminded of a Christmas cookie, spiced, but with a bready quality, also. Finish was semi-sweet, the result of the admixture of the spices with the malts. It was not the best version of the style that I tried over the course of the season, but neither was it the worst.","woodychandler","Beers"
3.56,-1.9,3.5,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Overall - A pretty good pumpkin beer, has the right flavors, but on the lighter side. Would be easy to knock back a few of these, nearly sessionable. A decent representative of the style.","blackcompg","0"

Pumpkin spice including the clove, vanilla, and nutmeg notes usually only found in a pumpkin pie. Flavor is straight spice minimal malts from the base beer this relies heavily on the spice additions minimal hints of gourd that may or may not have been there for the brewing process. Body is medium the carbonation is flowing thick in this beer, I'm actually amazed by the pumpkin and spice combo compared to other standard abv versions I'm getting a fuller bodied creamy carbonation pretty solid but still not something I would seek out.","WVbeergeek","Sep 13, 2013"

Aromas of fresh pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, clove, brown sugar, bread, and herbal. Damn nice aromas with good strength and balance; very authentic. Taste of pumpkin, biscuit, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, clove, brown sugar, caramel, and herbal. Lingering notes of caramel, biscuit, spices, and brown sugar on the finish for a bit. Good robustness of flavor with decent balance; spices are not overdone at all. Minimal cloying sweet flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy and slick mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with almost zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a really good pumpkin ale. Taste did not live up to the aromas; but it was well balanced and very drinkable. Definitely enjoyed this, and it is a nice example of the style.","superspak","Oct 07, 2012"

As soon as the beer hits your tongue, you'll be greeted by sweet pumpkin and malt tastes. In the middle of that drink you'll feel a pop of the pumpkin spices, most notably the cinnamon. Then on the very end of the swallow, the beer rounds off nicely again with sweet malts and pumpkin. With only 11 IBUs of hop bitterness, don't expect this beer to be anything less than a malt and pumpkin show-piece.

The beer is slightly hazy but not totally untypical for a Pumpkin Ale. The color of the ale was a copper to slightly orange like hue. In my opinion, the perfect color for a Pumpkin Ale. The ale has an aroma of Pumpkin Pie spices, most of which is nutmeg but there are hints of cinnamon and clove. I would prefer a bit more aroma by using more spice, but at any rate its very nice. The beer it self has excellent mouthfeel, very light and easy to drink. When drinking this you immediately get the pumpkin pie spice but it disappears too quickly and finishes with a slightly caramel taste. This is a tough beer to brew and there are so few "excellent" pumpkin ales on the market. O'fallon did a good job of carefully balancing hops with the spices. This is one of the best Pumpkin Ales that i have had to date, but I would like to see more of a bold spice taste.

Cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg over lay a modestly sweet malt body. The finish is more spices as well as a bit of biscuity malt that lends a hint of pie crust-like completeness. I can picture a dollop of whip cream on top. There is also just a hint of hop crispness as well to compliment the pie sweetness, and the cinnamon kind of stands out in the finish. Medium-light body with a smooth, minimally carbonated feel. It has just enough body to provide a bit of heft, but is not overly thick and cloying like some pumpkin ales can be.

2.7,-25.6,3,3,2.5,2,3,"Fort Wayne PubCrawl: Yes, thanks Silphium for bringing this bottle to our event. It poured a small sized white head with fine-small sized bubbles that mostly diminished. The body was cloudy and carbonated with an orange hue. The nose in my opinion consisted of clove, nutmeg, pumpkin, and cinnamon with a light spicy and mildly sweet flavoring to it. This beer had a bubbly, tingly, smooth, watery and thin texture to it and it was light bodied. The lacing was very sparse on the sides of my glass. Not a bad beer, but I just can't quite seem to get into pumpkin ales so far.","hotstuff","Oct 10, 2003"

Pumpkin , ginger, nutmeg? and cinnamon flavors, very spicy. Light body with a light and crisp mouthfeel, not overdone with pumpkin, nice spice and pumpkin balance.","maxpower","0"
