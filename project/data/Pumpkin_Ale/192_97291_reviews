"I Pop!ped the cap and began a somewhat gentle pour since I was unsure if there might be any lees. I need not have worried as I still got just over a finger of dense, tawny head with decent retention. Color was Deep Amber/Light Copper to Copper (SRM = > 13, "
""
""
""
"Amber in color with 1/2 finger of head.  Smell is sweet fruit but nothing really discernable.  Taste is pumpkin up front with a mix of flavors in the middle and bitter lemon at the end.  An ok beer but there are much better pumpkin beers available."
""
""
"Just not a very good beer"
"Overall:  This is only an OK beer. I’m a big fan of New Belgium, in fact, Fat Tire, Abbey, and 1554 are three of my favorite beers, but I’m not a fan of this beer.  In my opinion, there’s no balance here at all, the sourness of this beer just overpowers everything, and I can’t taste much of the malt or sweetness.  Sour fans will probably love this beer, but alas, I do not.  Sorry New Belgium, this one was a strike out for me."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I was very happy with this beer. The color, aroma, and taste of this beer are great. And the beer has great balance in the taste. Normally I don't like New Belgium beers very much, but this one is an exception."

"At first taste, this beer was too sour and too much cranberry flavor.  It lacked any hop flavor or aroma.  I initially rated it 3.375. However, as I have worked through the 6 pack over several weeks, it has grown on me. It is still sour and needs hops, but the after taste is that of pumpkin spice reminiscent of Belgian beers or a fine hefeweizen. In the end, New Belgium lived up to their goal of brewing in the Belgian style however untraditional. Thus the improved rated to 3.75."

"Best pumpkin ale I have tried so far. The spices mix exceptionally well with the pumpkin juice. The slight taste of cranberry seals the deal to create an ultimate pumpkin ale experience."

"Overall (3.62) : Pumpkick leaves a little to be desired. The droopy, drowsy mouthfeel along with its flat flavor profile makes this only a little better than the worst pumpkin ales. For the record I would drink this again. And I won't knock it because the flavor is good, it's just fleeting and watery. The label is great, and its an interesting concept, but if New Belgium reads these things, spice it up a bit with an injection of carbonation."
""
""
""
"Good fall beer... Pumpkin Yes, but I felt like the cranberry tartness kind of overpowered the nice pumpkin, cinnamon and nutmeg."
""
""
"O- I really dug this unique pumpkin beer offering.  The cranberry flavor really added a nice dimension of sweetness with the pumpkin spices."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A so-so, and kind of underwhelming version of the style, as the pumpkin and spice alike seem to be phoning it in.  Not sure that I'm overly content paying premium Canadian prices for this, when I could have had it for a song a few weeks ago in Denver."
""

"Very nice beer smooth pumpkin tastes with a heavy finish of Nutmeg. I like Nutmeg so I liked the beer others that were looking for a strong pumpkin need to look elsewhere, but I will buy it again. It also has a new label for 2014 that was quite entertaining."
""
"When I drink a pumpkin ale I want to know I'm drinking a pumpkin ale. This is what a pumpkin ale is supposed to taste like. There's nothing subtle about this beer. The pumpkin taste and aroma hit you right away along with hints of cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice. It's like a liquid pumpkin pie minus the terrible sweetness. And you can drink it guilt-free knowing they only use the best, freshest, non-GMO ingredients and sustainable business practices."
""
""
""
"A piece of liquid pumpkin pie but BETTER."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's definitely not bad tasting, but it is a poor representation of the style. The fruit juices added and the abundance of cinnamon make it taste more like a mulled cider than a pumpkin beer."
""
""
"For this style I like it a lot. Not very heavy on the spices a tiny tart of cranberry and very smooth."
""
""
"This is a GREAT beer. Some pumpkin beers are overpowered by cinnamon and while delicious are not beers you can drink more than one of. Pumpkick is delicious. It has lemon and cranberry undertones and tastes more like a slice of pumpkin bread. It is by far one of the best pumpkin beers I've had!"

"Surprised to see so many mediocre ratings for this tasty fall beverage. From the first whiff, you can tell this beer is exactly as advertised... a pumpkin beer with a twist. A lot of pumpkin pie in the aroma up front with the combination of spices and pumpkin, before the cranberry really reveals itself. First sip shows more of a balance between the sweet and tart, with a nice malty note in there as well. Overall, a nice twist on the standard pumpkin beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Subtle notes of nutmeg make this beer a nice reminder of fall, but not too overwhelming."
""
""
"Overall - A damn solid pumpkin brew from New Belgium. The cranberry twist livens up this pumpkin ale without compromising its integrity to the style. If you're looking for something with a unique take on the usual pumpkin ale, give this one a go."
"O: Pleaseant and intersting beer: intersting for both the unusual flavor profile and the mismatch between aroma and flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is my pick for pumpkin beer of the year so far. Lots of pumpkin favor, well balanced, with an interesting contribution from the cranberry. I like it better than this year's DFH Punkin."

"O:  I'm not a huge pumpkin beer fan.  Now I remember why.  I am rating this 3, but if you are a fan of this style, maybe it is good to you.  Not me."

"The body is an equally crisp and smooth one in a body that starts medium and, while remaining there, drifting toward light as it goes.  It starts with little action on the tongue in terms of dryness, which comes into the middle along with something that's not quite acidic but feels similar, though light."
""
"12 ounce bottle, enjoy by 18 JAN 15 on label (drank on September 13th).  Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a slightly hazy orange color with about an inch off-white head.  Head retention and lacing are both decent enough.  The brew smells like pumpkin, clove, and cinnamon.  Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also the addition of some nutmeg, tart cranberry and some earthiness.  The cranberry gets stronger as the beer warms.  Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit slick and has moderate carbonation.  It's also easy to drink.  I think it's a good pumpkin ale overall, the addition of the cranberry puts a nice spin on it.  I enjoyed it!  $8.99 a 6-pack."
""
""
""
""
"Taste - Mild pumpkin and spice, with a hint of tart cranberry underneath it all. It’s a well-balanced mix, and Pumpkick is an easy-to-drink, light-bodied pumpkin ale that maybe isn’t huge or overwhelming, but is quite drinkable and one I’d easily purchase again."
"Pours a beautiful deep golden-brown-orange color. Hints of cinnamon and nutmeg. Decent head and lacing. Too much spice and it took away from the pumpkin flavor which was hard to distinguish. Ok, but not one of their best !"

"O - Best pumpkin beer that I have had to date.  At the start it reflects more of a pumpkin pie than pumpkin squash but this flip flops as the glass is drained.  3.75/5"
"Overall, interesting little twist with masterfully brewed balance in this beer make it a winner in my book, New Belgium seasonals thus far have been a hit for me.  I’m glad their token pumpkin ale could do my palate justice just like their hoppy Tour de Fest seasonal did with a nice change of pace from this malt monster fall seasonal slam that most breweries send out in force."

"Gold like a real pumpkin with excellent flavor. Very nice and one of the better pumpkins this season. Wasn't a big New Belgium fan beyond Fat Tire when they came to North Florida but the newer brews are really some of the best I've had from any brewer in a long while."

"O- the cranberry adds a different kick to the style, I didn't think that I would like this one but it's actually pretty good"

"Overall: Good. Delivers as advertised. I didn't know if I'd like the cranberry infusion, but I did. A good offering from New Belgium."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, the avant-garde """kick""" in Pumpkick doesn't do the beer any favors. It could have been passable as a more traditional pumpkin ale, but something funky throws it off kilter. Beer brewed with pumpkin juice and cranberry juice didn't sound good on paper, and it tastes just as good at it sounded. Still trying to figure out why New Belgium has such a considerable following..."

"1 finger head lasts 1 minute. Smells tinny at first and then after a few wiffs I can smell the cranberry. Lots of tiny small cranberry bits at the bottom. Cloudy appearance. Fruity aroma but without the fruity taste. Nice reddish orange color. Fresh taste that is a bit thin and dry. Slightly acidic with a fair amount if carbonation. I can't taste any pumpkin nor anything else for that matter. Refreshing but not much going on. Still don't know why they call this pumpkick as there is absolutely no pumpkin whatsoever. Should have called it cranberry kick. It's a so so beer that to me is better enjoyed in the summer. If you are a pumpkin fan this will be a big disappointment. But not too bad as a dessert beer paired with fruit."
""
""
""
"The feel is bubbly but not harsh and it ends very clean."
""
""
""
"Overall: The beer has an okay pumpkin flavor and cranberry . A descent tasting beer the cranberry offers a dry tannin to the finish."
""
"Beer is medium to medium-light in body, with carbonation of medium-high intensity, resulting in a mouthfeel that is at first fizzy, calming to a gentle foaminess on the palate. A bit less carbonation would have suited this beer better. Closes dry, with moderate stickiness clinging to the palate and lips."
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"The potential is there and I wanted to like it, but I wish everything was more potent and more expressive. Worth a try, but there are much better pumpkin beers available - hopefully the tweak this one for next year."
"Light bodied and over carbonated. Not worth seeking out."
""
""
"D: Nice little holiday offering. Not something that I would drink on the reg but I do like that the key ingredients are noticeable without being overly so. All in all the pumpkin cranberry thing works."
""
""
""
"despite critics i actallly looved this beer. Great pumpkin taste and it just hit the spot for me not the best pumpkin beer on the market but a great beer to have during a nice fall day and i think that accounts for something. so really dont knock this beer to you have tried it you could do a lot worse"

"Overall: I had this beer last year when it was just called Kick and a part of the Lips of Faith series, and it was fantastic. Sadly, in turning it into a seasonal 6-pack I feel they seriously toned it down in order to give it more mainstream appeal. I will not be buying this again in future years."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I poured this beer and it has a light color body with not much head to it. The aroma has a slight spice to it. The taste has slight pumpkin flavor and some spice. I also get a very light tart hint of the cranberry. Mouthfeel is weak and overall this beer is ok."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall Drinkability: It's not that there is too much nutmeg, it's that there is really nothing but nutmeg. Reminds me of an extra-spiced Blue Moon."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pumpkick certainly has some interesting spicing going on as you let it warm. I feel that if you go into this beer expecting to find a pumpkin ale you are going to be let down. The spices are a little light, and err more towards the lemongrass and cinnamon than a pumpkin pie sweetness."
""
"A well done pumpkin ale. The taste and aroma are pleasant, but I would have liked them to be a bit more predominant."
""
""
"A very good beer that balances the pumpkin, spice and fruity flavors quite well. I feel the pumpkin and spices could even be ramped up a bit. However, I prefer the understated flavors of this beer over some others where the spices are overdone."
""
""
""
"Overall: A pretty solid twist on a pumpkin ale. The added fruits mix well with the pumpkin and spices."

"I am a fan of pumpkin so, naturally, this was a beer to accommodate my pallet. Unlike other beers with pumpkin flavor, this had some of the """spiciness""" that one would expect from pumpkin pie. Further, it had a strong finish. Being somewhat thick, it's not a brew to chug."

"O - One of the better pumpkin ales I have tried. I really like the variety of flavor I got from this one. The cranberry juice is a great complement to the pumpkin spice and really gives this beer some complexity that other pumpkin ales lack. I enjoy pumpkin flavors but am not as obsessed as some seem to be, but I usually give one or two of these ales a try every season. This is one that I would buy again."

"Overall, I like this version of the pumpkin ale a lot. The cranberry is refreshing."
"Pours a hazy amber color, with a thin off-white head. Smells of apple cider, with a strong cinnamon component. There is some nutmeg as well. Taste begins with a sweet cinnamon, then some light beechwood, then some cranberry juice, and a earthy, dry finish. Mouthfeel is a bit light. Overall a pretty good pumpkin ale."
""
"Overall/Comments: This was a very good beer that was very refreshing and drinkable however had nothing that really made it stand out except for maybe the tartness; While not my favorite pumpkin beer this is still a very good and respectable offering. Classified as a Pumpkin Ale @ 6% ABV. Consumed 9/20/2013."

"Let the beginners have Pumpkin Ales for Halloween. But the pros will reserve a few of the best ones for Thanksgiving. And that's where this ale belongs. We get the links of food flavor to beer flavor and get an added bonus of carbonated acidity to cleanse the palate: making it ideal for that savory and variant Thanksgiving dinner!"

"Decent spice notes and good body. Though again, only one of two """pumpkin ales""" are ones I consider really good. This is decent."
""
""
""
"I liked this better than I expected. The cranberry character is subtle enough to allow the pumpkin and spices to shine."
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer is just okay and not something I'd have again, not even in the fall when pumpkin beers are all the rage."
""
""
"O-This is not my favorite pumpkin beer. It smells alright, but it looks funky, tastes funky, and feels funky. The cranberries don't seem to add much and, in fact, I think the tart flavor sort of takes away from the rest of the flavor and gives it a sort of mixed-up profile. Meh."
"Bottom Line: Pumpkick strikes me as more of a novelty seasonal beer, jumping on the Pumpkin flavored (insert food or drink here) bandwagon. It is not bad, in fact it is much better than I expected. Obviously those who do not like pumpkin flavored drinks or food should avoid this beer. It is not overwhelming but this tasted more like a spiced fall beverage than a beer. If you are a fan of the style, go for it."

"O: A solid pumpkin beer, has a few shortcoming but overall enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a pretty rich copper/orange in color with a small white foamy 1-finger head that hangs around a while. Does leave some spotty lacing when sipped. The aroma is of pumpkin pie, spices and cinnamon. Slightly above average for carbonation as there was small streams of bubbles rising up from the bottom of the glass and sides even. The taste was about the same as the smell. A little watered down as this is a large commercial company (Fat Tire). Overall it wasn't that bad."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A lighter pumpkin beer. Too heavy on the spices, too light on the beer."
""
""
""
"Not too bad I have to say. I was expecting something a lot worse. A lighter version of a winter beer is what I would describe it as. I’d probably try it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Pretty safe and simple and decent, not great but not bad. Easy drinking, though it still carries that patent New Belgium malt profile somehow through all the spices and cranberries. Pumpkin is pretty muted and definitely more balanced than other pumpkin ales."
"12 ounce bottle into signature globe glass, best before 12/8/2013. Pours very hazy orange amber color with a small off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin lace cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, brown sugar, toast, brown bread, floral, light cranberry, and herbal earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of malt, pumpkin, and spice notes with slight cranberry presence; and good strength. Taste of pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, brown sugar, toast, brown bread, and herbal earthiness. Minimal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, brown sugar, toast, brown bread, and herbal earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice balance and complexity of malt, spice, and pumpkin flavors; with nearly zero cranberry presence and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and fairly crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice pumpkin ale. All around well balanced malt, spice, and pumpkin flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"(O)- Its a solid pumpkin beer. I could see this going really well at your thanksgiving meal due to the pumpkin, spice, and cranberry in this. Very festive for the fall time."
"The Verdict: Surprisingly good. The pumpkin is very muted, perhaps balanced from the bitter cranberries which give it a nice zest. I’m not a big fan of pumpkin beers generally, but I enjoyed this one."
""
"Overall not a bad fall seasonal, but the adjunct flavors are a bit over done. There are better fall seasonals and pumpkin beers."
"Overall eh worth a try if you like cranberry wouldn't buy a sixer though just one to try."
"O: Very disappointing. Pairing pumpkin with cranberry is a fantastic idea and I'd love to see New Belgium do it right. This beer might pair well with a rich Thanksgiving dinner but on its own the shortcomings are too overwhelming to recommend."
""
"O: pretty good pumpkin beer. I would order again. I was surprised to see it was brewed with cranberry juice. Didn't really didn't taste any of it though."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"why such bad reviews? this is made with pumpkin juice and cranberry juice. never heard of juicing a pumpkin, but it seems to work well in this new seasonal. the pour is as one would expect, orange tinted, mostly clear, bubbly, and with an inch of so of lazy white head. it smells a little tart from the cranberry, and I taste that element first too. the pumpkin is in the second half of both aroma and flavor, and its gentle, not overly spiced or covered up with sugar or too big of a malt, I think that aspect of this beer is quite well done. there is lemongrass too supposedly, which I guess must contribute this tropical lightness that's not usually found in fall beer. well carbonated too, it stays light despite all the robust flavors. pumpkin beer with a twist, not totally successful, but an enjoyable take on the fall classic. I will buy more this season for sure."

"Pours out a hazy orange with a thin head. Light spice, toast, pumpkin in the nose. Pumpkin and spice are subtle. Lots of toast (as with 99% of New Belgium stuff [I suppose it's the yeast strain]). Slight tartness of the cranberry. I don't pick up the lemongrass, thank God. Mouthfeel is thinnish with prickly bubbles. This is decent. Like a slightly pumpkin-y Fat Tire."

"Pumpkick has a slight edge over the usual pumpkin ales ... the mild cranberry character and good use of spice is just that. Worth a go."
"Semi-hazy light orange color with half a finger of off white head that dissipates fairly quickly. Smells like tart cranberry, cinnamon, and pumpkin. Taste is mostly tart and sweet cranberry, with pumpkin and cinnamon spice only having a low presence. Sweet and sticky with moderate carbonation. It's a good take on a pumkin ale; the cranberry adds a different dimension with tartness."
""
""
""
""
"O: Don't let this drink warm up too much because that bitterness gets fairly strong. This brew even though delicious should just be classified as a herbed / spiced beer. The pumpkin barely stands out. Quite delicious if not looking for a pumpkin ale and instead looking for a nice spice holiday brew."
""

"Pours a clear, copper color. 3/4 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and good lacing. Smells of pumpkin, hops, sweet malt, nutmeg, hint of cinnamon, hint of sugar, and a hint of alcohol. Fits the style of a Pumpkin Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of pumpkin, sweet malt, hint of yeast, slight nutmeg, hint of earthy malt, hops, and slight alcohol. Overall, I really like how the pumpkin is more of a addition than the dominant flavor. Also, I enjoy the spices being as subtle as they are in the body; the blend is amazing."
"A rather bland pumpkin ale."
""
""
""
"O: All in all decent, but it seems like it is holding on to summer instead of diving into fall."
""
"And, I should call it cheating that they used pumpkin juice, but it seems to work well enough here. Still, I prefer when real, fresh pumpkin is used."
""
""
""
"O: A solid pumpkin ale overall. I'd like more depth and presence from the cranberries, but it's not bad."
"O: Overall I thought this was OK, but I wouldn't call this one of my top pumpkin ales."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into tulip. Orange pumpkin color with nice lacing. bready spice aroma..mild but pleasant. Taste is similar..caramel, biscuit, bready, spices...and a hint of chocolate. Well balanced and really easy to drink. Yet another pumpkin ale, but its actually a decent one. Not sure why there are so many bad reviews...its a good run of the mill pumpkin. Id get again if it was available in my area..."

"Where this beer falls apart for me is on the palate. What I was expecting was two great tastes which play well together. At least thematically. And the elements are there—I can taste the pumpkin (well, pumpkin extract?) as it lends a rounded malty sweetness to the beer, and contrasts with a tart cranberry sharpness. But they don’t play well together and the dry, lingering and somewhat unpleasant finish (like licking a piece of chalk) doesn’t help. Avoid."
"Really surprised this isnt rated higher! Maybe its the tequila shots I took earlier, or maybe its the terrible pumpkin and oktoberfest beers ive had this season, but this is a nice refreshing change of pace. Well blended flavor, average look and smell, but an enjoyable brew. Im not a new belgium fan at all, but this beer is everything they promise. Just look at the name.... Pumpkick...."
""
"O: Let me say that I appreciate and understand the concept behind this brew but I really can say it works for me. The cranberry is interesting but ruins the roasty and rich pumpkin and spice flavors expected in a pumpkin beer. This is not anything I would ever purchase again but it wasnt totally horrible considering the take on the style. Again I applaud New Belgium for stepping outside the box. Cheers!"

"O - Good looking beer with great aroma that was deceiving before the taste. A strange layer of acidity was pretty much throughout the whole taste with very little sweetness. Prickly carbonation and light body through me for more clashing (gourd flavored beer) loops. Not sure the direction or interpretation they were attempting but this ended up being a miss when it started so promising."
"O. Very enjoyable pumpkin ale. I like how the cranberry cuts the sweet of all te spices. That is a nice take on this style."

""
""
"T: Tasted of pumpkin, nutmeg, allspice, malt, a little bit of cinnamon, and some cranberry. It reminds me of drinking tea, with spice, and with some raspberry instead of cranberry. It's an orange, and amber color beer. It's not bad, but I've had better pumpkin beers. I like this beer, but you can't a lot at once. Max two beers from a 6pack. S: A decent aroma of pumpkin, spices, and fruit."

"Pours a mostly clear amber color, topped with a nice, thick head that drops to a thin covering. Tart, spicy aromas...nutmeg, cinnamon, clove, dried berries, and some bready grain. Slightly sweet, pie spice blend, and caramel. Smooth medium body, a bit sticky. Not great...too much spice, not enough cranberry."

"Reddish amber hued. Head is a couple of millimeters thick. Great clarity with this beer. Pumpkin, cinnamon, and nutmeg with a touch of cranberry following in the nose. The mouthfeel is moderate as their is some alcohol here, but it is pretty smooth considering all of those ingredients. I get the pumpkin and cinnamon on the palate. At the back I get the spiciness of cinnamon and perhaps from the hops I get the pinpricks on the tongue. I get just shiny of cranberry in the aftertaste. It was used subtly and that was wise. I like a but more pumpkin flavoring in my pumpkin beers, but it's a good brew."

"O: This is a nice example of a pumpkin ale. I'm at a loss to explain the low score it has on this site. Still, a drinkable beer."

"New Belgium was very careful not to go too overboard with this beer, the pumpkin is highlighted and the addition of cranberry juice slight. Otherwise it's a straight forward amber with some pumpkin and fall spice. Not as bad as I thought this was going to be."
"Pours an murky dark orange with a foamy khaki head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, pumpkin pie spice, and slight cranberry aromas. Taste is much the same with slightly tart berry and pumpkin pie spice flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an average beer that smells pretty good with the pumpkin pie spices working well with the cranberry, but the taste of these two aspects does not mesh all that well in my opinion."

"Aroma is cinnamon/spices, mild vegetative notes and hints of pumpkin and cranberries. The flavor is pumpkin, cranberries, mild spices, fruit and a tart finish. The cranberries were different for the style; as a whole this was pretty good pumpkin ale."
"Overall- Decent but not the best pumpkin ale that I've had (nor is the best from New Belgium that I've tried. Needs more pumpkin flavoring."

"O: Another interesting spin on the pumpkin beer - the cranberry tartness is an interesting addition and makes the beer a little less sweet overall and a little easier to drink. Enjoyable though not the best (or the worst) pumpkin beer I have tried."

"Picked up NB's new fall seasonal. Poured into globe glass. Nice pour, good coloring, burnt amber with a thick head. Faint scents of sweet pumpkin, spice, cinnamon. Not bad flavor. Pumpkin taste is subtle, not overbearing and not synthetic at all. The tartness from the cranberries is a nice touch. Nice balance with the overall maltiness of the beer. Mouthfeel is light and airy. Overall a nice pumpkin ale and worth picking up. Very drinkable."

"I liked this better than I expected (I'm not a fan of New Belgium). Most pumpkin ales are hit or miss and this is closer to hit than miss. A good beer, just could have done some things differently to make it better. Easy to drink, not a session beer, but the alcohol that is there is very well hidden. I bought a sixer and I'm pretty happy I didn't go for the single."
"Overall: I wasn't expecting much from this beer. And i am not surprised. Great start, but tough ending. Taste brings down mouthfeel, and thats all she wrote."
"New Belgium Pumpkick ---3/5."

"Poured into a Dogfish Head pint glass. Pours a medium coppery amber with a half finger white head that dissipates to patchy foam and light ring around the glass, leaving patchy lacing. Aroma of cooked pumpkin, cinnamon, faint malt, very vegetal. Flavor brings in more of the cranberry juice, with pumpkin, grassy hops, holiday spices and malt that is covered by the pumpkin and cranberry. I bit on the sour side, as might be expected from cranberries. Light bodied with active peppery carbonation. An interesting take on an pumpkin ale, but not my preference for malt body; a bit too light malt and a bit too sour. The beer is only modestly sour, but perhaps unbalanced by it. Interesting, but not in my list of favorite pumpkins."

"I am a little confused by this beer and what NBB is going for. I wouldn't suggest spending your weekly beer money on this season."

"12 oz bottle poured into New Belgium globe. Appearance is a bright pumpkin orange color with nice clarity, velvety white head with heavy lacing a nice retention. Nose starts with heavy fleshy pumpkin character that comes off in a vegetal way. Mild notes of allspice and clove follow that and not much cranberry character to speak of, maybe a tinge of cran tartness at the finish. Taste is very nondescript in terms of pumpkin character. There is a wave of light cranberry tartness that seems to neutralize the pumpkin spices. The spice picks up a bit towards the finish with allspice being the most prominent note. The flavors are a little muddled which seems to make this beer lacking in the flavor department. Mouthfeel is light and well carbonated. Overall, this is a very mild flavored pumpkin ale and he cranberry doesn't come through in that thanksgiving dinner kind of way. Come to think of it, I'm not really sure why cranberry is being paired with pumpkin in the first place... It works with turkey and stuffing, but can't say I've ever really paired it with pumpkin pie. But I digress, this one is very forgettable."

"Amber with a solid quilt of near bone white foam. Smells of allspice, cranberry juice, some grain and plenty more cranberries, but sweet. Too bad the cranberries aren't more like Serendipity - that was a yummy beer. Flavor is malt, mild spice, raisin, sweet, muddled overall and kinda bland....even for a pumpkin beer. Medium bodied with light carb and a wet finish. This beer was subpar."

"New Belgium has really let me down lately, this is one to avoid, a bad example of a style that has plenty of clunkers"

"O - The presence of the pumpkin and spice is top-notch in Pumpkick, really landing in a flavorful-yet-drinkable zone that's perfect for it's late fall release - not too heavy or sweet but just right. Without a doubt, one of my go-to fall beers this year."

"Overall I thought this was an ok beer, and a fairly average example of the style, the aroma was going in the right direction, but when it got to the taste all the malt aspects that were missing in the aroma showed up in the taste a little too much so pushing the flavors that were supposed to be showcased into the background. This beer had decent drinkability, it was smooth and not filling, but the taste didn't do a great job at holding my attention, one would be enough for me, but if I was offered a few of these I could probably dink them but I don't think I would enjoy them that much. What I liked the most about this beer was the appearance and aroma, they were both nice and the highlights of this beer. What I liked least about this beer was the mouthfeel, it was pretty bland with not much life to it. I wouldn't buy this beer again, 12 is enough for me for the season and I think I'll save one or two of these for October to see if my opinion has changed. I wouldn't recommend this as a good Pumpkin beer, it's priced nicely, but it's not really a bang for your buck. All in all I wasn't impressed with this beer and when it comes to Pumpkin beers it falls right in the middle, it wasn't great or memorable by any means but there wasn't anything offensive about it. New Belgium is a pretty solid brewery, but I think they missed the mark with this one and I would like it better if the pumpkin and cranberry flavors were highlighted more, better luck next time guys."

"O: A good example of a spice, herb, veg beer. A bit more to offer than the typical pumpkin with some interesting additions; I like that neither the spice nor malt took over to overwhelmed the flavors."
"Overall - this is a fun fall seasonal for sure. Could have called it cran kick. Fun session beer, but I would only drink in the fall. Reminds me of jumping into a pile of leaves"

"O - Not a terrible experience, but not an amazing one either. This beer delivers what the label promises, at least. In a world full of up-and-coming breweries who push the envelope with fall seasonal / Pumpkin beers, this one stands right in the middle of the road for me. With monsters like Southern Tier Warlock & Pumpking, Saint Arnold Pumpkinator, Rogue Pumpkin Patch, and DFH Punkin out there, this one is decent, but not mind-blowing. However; if you want a pumpkin beer that is light and easy to drink, that also packs a decent punch that just might club you over the head, and then take your wallet when you aren't looking, give it a try. You might not be too impressed, but you won't necessarily be let down either. Cheers!"
"Alright, is there some place where I can get a bottle (or can or carton or whatever) of pumpkin juice? Am I missing something? I didn't even know you could juice a pumpkin... Anyway, this stuff pours a clear auburn-bronze topped by a finger of off-cream foam. The nose comprises white toast, a pinch of clove, a half-pinch of cinnamon, a half-dash of brown sugar, mild caramel, and a strange mini-undertow of what seems like chicken gravy. The taste brings in more of the same, with the spices all blending together into a muddled stream of near-nothingness that culminates in a gulf of rather hard water. This also serves to water down the caramel a bit. Still no sign of the cranberry (though there is a tinge in the back of the finish, but that could just be psychosomatic). The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slick feel. Overall, a pretty meek little beer, one that not only doesn't bring the spice, but one that doesn't really try to express itself in much of any way. Boo this."

"O: Not bad, but there was no """kick""" as the label suggested. A higher ratio of malt and pumpkin to water may have elevated this from forgettable to truly tasty. It's a shame."
"It's alright. It's different than typical pumpkin ales, and I'm okay with that. I like the tartness in this beer, though I barely get a hint of a fruit flavor, and it all tastes rather mild overall. Relatively forgettable, though I'd probably choose this over some of the super spicy pumpkin beers out there."

"Pumpkick pours a dark reddish color with a small but lacing head. There is a strong pumpkin and nutmeg aroma. The taste has a strong pumpkin and nutmeg flavor, with just hints of sweetness and tartness from the cranberries. Great full body, nice strong complex flavors. Overall a fantastic and fruity pumpkin ale."
"O.A. don't know what i'm gonna do with the other 2 bottles I have, glad I was able to split it with someone, wish I could had split it with 2 people...."
"O: I would not feel honest if I rated this beer at anything above 2.5 overall. The flavor isn't there, the mouthfeel is nearly there but too weak, and there is much to be desired on the scent. I wouldn't recommend the beer."

"Overall an OK Pumpkin ale. If you want a beer that is mildly flavored this is the beer for you. If you want bold flavors this isn't the beer you are looking for."

"First pumpkin beer and I'm excited to try more. I know there are probably some fantastic pumpkin beers out there. Especially ones made with real pumpkin. However, I enjoyed this beer alot and I think the cranberry tartness makes this beer delicious."
"Sourcing: Purchased at HEB in Texas on 08/06/2013 for $7.99/six-pack plus tax."
"Overall, a bit of a letdown. Might be better if they waited and used real pumpkin rather than releasing in July."

"The beer pours slightly hazy amber with lots of visible tiny bubbles and a thin, off-white head. The aromas of pumpkin and cranberry are present. I also get some mild earthiness and along with the cinamon, nutmeg, and allspice. The taste follows the nose. The spice is present in the front and back along with plenty of pumpkin and cranberry. You would never guess this beer is 6% ABV. The body is medium to full with spritzy carbonation. This beer still drinks pretty easy despite that. This is a very good beer."

"This pours a slightly cloudy amber color with a creamy head. The aroma is mild with pumpkin and cranberry. I can’t say what would make a person think that pumpkin and cranberry should be mixed together, but it does have a very interesting taste. Drinks very smooth."

"#2 - Why not omit the cranberry and just make a solid, malty pumpkin ale?"
