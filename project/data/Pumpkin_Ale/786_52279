4.75,15,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.75,"This seasonal 'Pumpkin Ale' pours a hazy mahogany in color with about a half-finger off-white foamy head. A good amount of lacing is seen with each sip, close to ring-like even. Sediment is seen in the bottom of the bottle after the pour. The aroma is like a fresh pumpkin pie. Fantastic! Even more going on with the taste as their are the perfect amount of spices of cinnamon, nutmeg and even a hint of clove in the mix. Really smooth and goes down so easy. One of the BEST pumpkin ales on the market. Medium-bodied with perfect carbonation. Love this one but I do remembered how good it was from back in 2012. This is as good as it gets!","BeerWithMike","Mar 09, 2015"

Smooth, medium body and mouthfeel with very little aftertaste. Overall this was outstanding, I can see why it won a blind pumpkin tasting in my bottleshop 2 years running.","Mikus","Oct 28, 2014"

Mouthfeel was medium and the taste was very pleasant with the cinnamon and the malt, especially the caramel malt, interacting beautifully. I really felt like it was liquid cinnamon toast! Finish was semi-dry with the spices being balanced out nicely. I feel renewed in my attempt to review such beers. YMMV.","woodychandler","Nov 19, 2013"

Not cloudy but darn close to opaque liquid, sunset red up close, more a mix of browns and oranges further away, few bubbles visible. The nose is clean and direct, cinnamon to clove spice, orange peel, the pumpkin is ripe but not sweet, light breadiness without it being pie-like, touch of cocoa powder too, nothing here overdone or unnecessarily flamboyant. Medium-bodied, has enough prickle from the carbonation to keep the sweetness in check, even has a sort of tart, metallic edge at times. Otherwise, straight up fresh pumpkin with cinnamon, nutmeg spice, chocolate and vanilla accents. Less citrus here, mostly orange, some lemon. Stays balanced and the flavors cruise at a steady altitude, you don’t get worn out by it. Finishes cleanly yet with bite. Easy to like and, again, doesn’t try too hard, always a plus in my book.","farrago","Oct 13, 2013"

Simply a very pleasant and true pumpkin ale that I would recommend highly. My wife dislikes beer with a passion, and she asked for more after her first taste. The only pumpkin ale I have liked more was Southern Tier on tap in a tulip glass, which was a revelation.

I really have to say that this is THE BEST pumpkin ale I have ever had. And I've had quite a few. I liked this even more than Southern Tier Pumking, Shipyard Smashed Pumpkin, and several others.

I'm not going to break down the taste, mouthfeel, etc., just want to note that I found this to be the best pumpkin ale I've had to date.
