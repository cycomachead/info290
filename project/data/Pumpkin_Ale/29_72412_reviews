"Sum it up in a few words:  I purchased it because I was in the mood for a pumpkin beer and the liquor store had no other options.  Not unhappy, but not amazed."
""
""
"Easily one of the worst Pumpkin Ales out there."
""
""
""
""
"light beer with a nice light spiced pumpkin flavor -too much carbonation"
"Surprisingly good.  Mild pumpkin and spice.  Balance is much better than I was expecting and there is nothing off putting about the beer."
""
""
"Awful taste. More like rotten pumpkin wheat."
""
"Cheers"
""
""
"A little too much cinnamon  taste for me, but still enjoyable."

"Overall - For me, this is a great pumpkin beer for the price.  I recommend it."

"Poured a clear orange body with abundant carbonation bubbles and no head. It looks like a poor, watery pumpkin ale. Scents of pumpkin, apple juice, sweet spices with an emphasis on nutmeg and cinnamon. Overall impression of aroma is of a very sweet, pumpkin forward aroma, too sweet with no real balance. Flavor begins sweet with notes of pumpkin, sweet spices with notes of cinnamon and nutmeg and medium-light apple cider. Middle is sweet with the same flavors continuing. Finish is sweet with notes of pumpkin and sweet spices, the same flavors continue. Aftertaste is sweet spices, nutmeg and cinnamon and some pumpkin. Overall impression of flavor is of a very sweet pumpkin ale without much balance. Mouthfeel is light bodied with high carbonation and a watery feel. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of an okay ale,easy to drink but note a witbier. Overall this is an okay ale. It is too sweet in aroma and flavor, the mouthfeel is easy to drink but not amazing. Nothing special and one of the weaker pumpkin beers."
""
"Pours a slightly hazy orange body, with thick beige head. The head reduces to a thin film in no time at all! Relatively little aroma, a veggie squash scent. Taste is rather bland, bready, plain pumpkin, no spices. Meh!"
""
""
"Just no."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Meh. Simple holiday brew. Very fake sweet taste, but, with the Turkey and the knit-sweater, it'll do, donkey."
""
""
""
""
"Well, I imagine the water in that well is basically what is used to make this beer. I have had good pumpkin beer before, but not this. You do not even taste the pumpkin. It's almost like someone dropped a cigarette butt in your bottle."

"Good pumpkin beer for the price! I have noticed that many pumpkin beers were not around for long and are expensive this one you can get and it is cheaper! I hope it is around so I can have it at Thanksgiving! Better then the Coors blue moon. Lighter and more drinkable! I will often drink a more expensive pumpkin beer and then switch to this if it is a bon fire night!"

"Not the best pumpkin beer but not the worst I have had.  The pumpkin spice flavor is mild and you clearly taste the wheat.  I just don't know if I like pumpkin and wheat combined."

"Serving type: Bottle poured into a glass – but straight out of the bottle is just fine."

"Call me as fool, but I like the Pumpkin version of Shock Top better than the original! As it's """pumpkin""" I doubt I'd drink it all year round, but then again, I might. I think the aroma is great, and that the spicing balances the malt and rounds it out nicely. Additionally, unlike many pumpkin beers that utilize too much cinnamon, that's not the case here and I can actually taste the nutmeg clearly. At the very least, in the realm of pumpkin beers, it's definitely more towards the top of the heap than the bottom."
"1-100 I give it a 91, Really liked the flavor, not too strong and light."

"Overall: Pretty good pumpkin beer, not that it’s my favorite style. Shock Top’s toned-down style works pretty well here, as I don’t want too much pumpkin in my beer."
""
""

""

"The smell of the brew is a light smell as well as the taste for pumpkin beer. I felt there could be a stronger flavor and spice, but maybe that is why I am still okay with it. Also the can I have says the ABV is 5.1% not that it is much difference just found that interesting."
"Shock Top Pumpkin Wheat brewed by Anheuser-Busch with an ABV of 5.2% This brew pours out of a brown bottle a light brown amber with a small white head. The smell is sweet with pumpkin and some grains.  You also pick up on some spices in this brew. The taste is rich with flavor. You pick up on pumpkin and spices and some grains at the end.  Not as much flavor as I would like to see in a pumpkin brew. There is a lot going on in this brew. The mouthfeel is nice and smooth.  There is nothing over powering in this brew.  Pumpkin wheat has a nice balance to it. Overall I'm giving this brew 4 out 5. I would buy this brew again."

"A little bit a sweet taste in the first swallow.  But overall I would drink it again."
""
""
""
""
""
"A very average pumpkin beer.  It's enjoyable and cheap and readily available.. but it's way down the list of pumpkin beers I'd go for."
""
""
""
"Very nice for a Pumpkin wheat."
""
"Not my favorite pumpkin of the year. The pour was a pale orange and the head was fizzy and did not trail. The smell was mostly wheat to the point where it smelled like and average shock top. And the taste kind of was. Mild wheat flavor with a bit of artificial pumpkin instead of the usual orange. Didn't care too much for it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pretty good pumpkin flavor.  Orange in color."
""
"Overall- Slightly better than I expected. Could use more pumpkin flavor but this is no micro brew. Not bad. I would drink this again, or even on draft at a bar if this was an offer. The spice taste was not overpowering either. If the pumpkin was stronger it would score better."

"Pours a orange-amber in color with a thin white head that lasts the whole drink. Some spotty lacing is seen. Small steaming bubbles rising up from the bottom of the glass the whole time. but perfect carbonation actually. The aroma is of very light pumpkin and spices (mostly cloves). The taste is about the same with more spices of cloves & nutmeg coming out then the light pumpkin and wheat flavor. No harsh or bitter aftertaste. Overall, it wasn't bad."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Definitely not the worst pumpkin beer out there, but far from the best. What we have here is a pumpkin beer that has potential, but fails to live up to it. If you're looking for a spiced beer that's not going to weigh you down after a few back to back, this is worth consideration. However, if you're looking for a full bodied pumpkin to take your time with, this isn't it."

""
""

"Over all- Nice pumpkin beer, not too overwhelming, easy to drink,"
""
""
"The feel is, not surprisingly, somewhat too thin, and the graininess contributes to an uncleanness on the palate. It has some substance, to be sure, and the crispness adds something to it. Beside that, it's not too far from smooth either. Still, stronger malts and a cleaner feel would be beneficial."
""
"OK beer, one of my favorite shock tops at least."

"Overall: Not a really good Pumpkin Ale, but it is easy to drink."
""
""
""

"Ive never tried the cinnamon challenge, but this has to be close to the same dose of spices you get cannonballing straight cinnamon. Overpowering, pungent, perfumy spices hit your senses like a runaway semi truck. I new it was BMC, I new it was gonna suck, but I tried it anyway."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a brownish.orange color with a 1 inch head. There are some floaties in the glass here. Smell is of pumpkin, nutmeg, some other spices. Taste is the same, only milder. just a touch of wheat coming through after the spices and pumpkin. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall, is a decent easy drinking brew I could enjoy several of."

"I am like the late Frank Sinatra and Sid Vicious in that I did it my way. I inverted the bottle several times to get it stirred up before I even unscrewed the cap and then used an aggro pour to ensure both blending and release. What an insult to my intellect! I got a fizzy fingers of tawny head that initially fell quickly and towards their end, suddenly created a cap that hung in quite well. Color was an slightly hazy coppery-orange (SRM = > 13, < 17). It must kill them not to filter the living daylights out of these beers. Hee hee. I got a LOT of nutmeg, followed by cinnamon and cloves on the nose. Mouthfeel was thin and watery and the taste was prevalently cinnamon with the other spices relegated to a back-up role. Finish was semi-dry, thanks to all of the spices, but I still felt unfulfilled. It just seemed to lack depth and oomph."
"O - I was very impressed. I didnt expect much but this beer had a very good flavor to it. No problem picking this one up again!"
"AB has put together a good product here. It tastes like a true craft beer, with more complexity than AB is known for. I'd gladly have this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Over all an average fall seasonal. Reasonably priced. I doubt I'll have this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A good pumpkin beer, not my favorite, but not the worst. I wouldn't go out of my way for it, but I would not turn one down."
""
""

"The Verdict: Not bad. Smooth, inoffensive take on a seasonal brew from Anheuser-Busch."

"O: Not a horrible offering from Shock Top which I had kind of expected, so I guess you could say that this one exceed expectations. Fairly easy to drink with a nice blend of pumpkin pie spices dominating without being too sweet."

"The taste was all wrong as the taste of pumpkin was washed away quickly on the palate. An exceptionally carbonated feel and rush of bubbles rinsed the palate of any real pumpkin, spice or wheat taste. What made this average and not below was that I could taste what was on the mind of the brewer but it simply never reached me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Not a big fan of wheat beer, figured I'd pick it up since I do love pumpkin beers. Very nice late summer/early fall beer, a little heaviness to it, not too much pumpkin, muted fall flavors. If this had been marketed as a fall seasonal and not a pumpkin beer specifically, I never would have marked it as one, a very pleasant beer, but definitely not the kind of pumpkin beer I'm used to."
""
"The taste is okay but has a light spice and mild wheat flavor with somewhat yeast driven taste with some cooked corn type creamy taste with subtle tangy fruitiness and mild grainy quality. Overall I was not impressed, but it has the fall spice you may expect coupled with the ordinary shock-top wheat flavors and mild caramel elements. It is not bad but one is all I really need to have."
""
""
""
""
"A little better than what I'm used to getting from an Anheuser-Busch beer, this pumpkin ale is brewed with pumpkin rather than pumpkin being added later (Shipyard, I'm looking at you) which is certainly appreciated (and expected). Smell is pleasant, with a good balance of pumpkin and spice but not much complexity. This doesn't taste much like the wheat beer that it is, maybe because the yeast drowns out the wheat. Pumpkin and spice taste good but not all that fresh or interesting. Mouthfeel is relatively thin for a pumpkin ale, but it goes down well and the aftertaste is simple, with just a touch of spice lingering. Overall, this isn't remarkable by any means. It is simple and decent."

"overcarbonated wheat beer with decent pumpkin flavor, but a poor finish. not terrible, but could have been done much better."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer is just OK. Not something to write home about. It has a nice color. An average head. I did not pick up any wheat taste or smell at all. The punpkin taste seemed to me to be by addition of pumpkin spices off the supermarket shelve. I liked that it was sweeter than most. It is a nice drinkable beer but not something I want to have again."

"Overall, this beer has an artificial feel surrounding it from the aroma, to the flavor, to the mouthfeel. One thing going for it is that it is quite refreshing when ice cold but that is about the only positive thing I can say. Not a beer I plan on having again."
"O - Overall, a good pumpkin beer. Loads better that Blue Moons attempt."

"Flavor is a bit weird as the pumpkin and wheat seem to cancel each other out in a sense. This yields a pleasant enough flavor but one with little depth or ability to linger. No notable bitterness or spice flavor. Finish is a bit thin with a light citric punch. Overall quite unobtrusive yet quite drinkable given the lack of complexity and minimal spice notes."
"Pretty good brew considering the source. Not bad. I like a yeast driven pumpkin."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: i actually enjoyed this brew, find it somewhat like the Schlafly Pumpkin Ale. If the mouthfeel didnt completely suck, I honestly think this would be an excellent brew."

"12 ounce bottle, label stamped with 12 237, I assume that's the bottled on (or best by?) julian date (August 25, 2012). Served in a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass, the beer pours a cloudy orange color with some sediment floaties noticeable. Head retention is OK, not much lacing. Aroma is nice but weak, it smells like some pumpkin, wheat, nutmeg and some cloves. The taste is similar to the aroma, but there's a slight sour bread-like finish. It's not bad tasting, but not exactly good either. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's surprisingly a bit slick and creamy, but with high carbonation. Not really impressed by this one, but it's drinkable. Got this bottle from a friend so I can't complain too much."
""
""
""
"not a bad pumnpkin beer. nice in a wheat variety really, not as commonly done as it probably should be. the pours is orange hued and hazy pale colored with a decent off white head. fades quick. the nose is more spice than squash, cinnamon and clove, even ginger or something too. yeasty as always. the flavor is also more spice than pumpkin, lots of vanilla and clove, and some pepper from the yeast. its sweet and palatable, with a quick finish and a drinkable medium body and bright carbonation. its a little filling though, and fall is a time for all day drinking, so this isnt the ideal product for that, but its a lot better than regular shock top and the other spin offs ive had. overall not a bad beer if you are in a wasteland that only carries mass produced stuff. really not bad."
""
""
""
"I must be a sucker for punishment. ...Or ticking... Well, this stuff was incredibly popular last year, so I might as well finally give it a try. It pours a clear sunset orange-bronze topped by a finger of off-white foam. The nose comprises cinnamon, brown sugar, and biscuit. Nothing more, nothing less. The taste holds notes of funky wheat, what may or may not be pumpkin, and a light dusting of cinnamon. Things do not mesh well at all, frankly, and a bad taste is literally left in my mouth in the end. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slick, nearly watery feel. Overall, a sad little pumpkin beer, one whose popularity will remain a mystery to me now..."
""
""
"Overall, I was pleased, I've been trying a lot of new beers lately and haven't been too impressed, but was happy with this submit by Shock Top - they haven't done much to disappoint me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Pumpkin ales don't get much worse than this, and it's a shame. The pumpkin to spice ratio felt right, but the watered down body tarnished anything that might have been."
""
"o - Overall a decent pumkin beer, though nothing mind blowing. The nose is a bit weak and bland, but the taste was good and it was better than I expected. Not my favorite pumpkin beer but worth checking out if you love the style and see it on tap."
""
""
""
""
"I was pleasantly surprised by this beer. I can’t handle to much pumpkin but I do enjoy a little pumpkin in beer during the festive fall. aroma- has a nutty pumpkin smell to it. appearance- looks nice with a decent head taste- Pumpkin with wheat just as you would guess. palate- good co2 on it with the ability to drink a couple...not a few though.... Overall I would reach for another one down the road..."
""
""
""
"Better than anticipated, but I anticipated it to the awful."
""
"Aside from the aftertaste, it is one of the better pumpkin beers out there. There's a glimmer of WOW but it quickly fades. If they could continue that flash of brilliance throughout the whole beer's taste, it would be a contender for the best pumpkin ale."
"Not bad...I am actually somewhat impressed considering my lower than low expectations."

"Taste/overall- Tasty pumpkin spice flavors not to strong. to much carbonation. Nice beer to drink around october and halloween or if you want to drink a pumpkin beer better then the blue moon pumpkin beer i think id try it again next october"
"Overall: A pretty bland pumpkin ale, but what do you really expect from the Shock Top brand? I guess it's good to see that they're expanding their range, but this really isn't anything special."
""
""
"Shock is a nice pumpkin beer for a hot day thirst quencher. Thumb up. I recommend it with a little hesitation. I don't think it will shock you, but you may have have a pleasant time drinking this beer. This beer is really meant to drank to some mellow rock from the 70s. You know Steely Dan Aja, Fleetwood Mac, or """Hello It's Me""" by Todd Rundgren."

"A mediocre brew here. Some wheat character, some pumpkin character and mainly washed out after the finish. Personally, I don't care much for overdone spicing, but everything about this is rather weak. Not """offensive", just weak."
""
""
""
"I sampled this beer along with two other similar choices (Sierra Nevada Tumbler and Dundee Oktoberfest) and I was pleasantly surprised. It was pumpkin in color and and hit a slight sweetness to it. It beat my average expectations. I didn't expect much and I got more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
"M: A little too carbonated and light bodied."
""
""
""
""
"O - This pumpkin is surprisingly better than anticipated, especially with the underwhelming track record of Shock Top seasonals, but this pumpkin wheat is moderately flavorful, balanced, and drinkable; everything one might expect while maintaining a profile that wont offend their customer base. A good training wheel pumpkin for example; however, it certainly won't satisfy the desires of anyone really craving a rich pumpkin brew."
""
""
""
""
"All in all, I could probably drink quite a few of these in a session."
""
"O - It's very drinkable, but not a beer I would seek out when wanting a really enjoyable pumpkin beer. For me this is a run of the mill wheat beer with slight pumpkin hints. I really wanted the pumpkin and especially the spice to hit my mouth a lot harder. I'll most likely buy it again though because it's cheap, easy to find and a pretty easy drink to enjoy with some friends or with a meal. There are much beer pumpkin beers out there, but this isn't bad."
""
""
""
""
"O I would by Shipyard pumpkin ale for the seasonal pumpkins it is much better."
"Overall: Better than I expected. A sessionable, wheaty, and solid pumpkin beer. I could have a six on a fall day. Nothing outstanding, and there are better pumpkin beers out there, but nothing to pass up either."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The finish is the worst part. It is long, but the taste is bad, so ya just sit there wishing the flavor would go away. It has a very bad light beer aftertaste. Boo."
""
"O-...."
""
""
"I love wheat beer, all kinds of it but this pumpkin spice is a very good product. Although Jack's Pumpkin Spice Ale was better this has not been a complete disappointment. I have tried several pumpkin beers & ales & there are some very good ones out there."
"Overall – A tasty pumpkin beer with a easy drinking sweetness and spiced pumpkin flavor. While not the top pumpkin brew out there it is one of the best for its price and one to go to on occasion."
"Solid beer overall. I am not sure there can be better balance of pumpkin and wheat in a beer. Easy drinker. This will be a nice beer for those hot autumn afternoons here in Florida."
"This is one of the more enjoyable pumpkin beers I have had the chance to try. It does not immediately overwhelm the senses with the powerful aroma or taste of what it is going for, yet still retains the feeling as if October is getting closer with every sip."
""
""
""
""
""

"I would definitely pick this up again although I don't think I would session this one."

"this is pretty much a light pumpkin ale, didnt really get any witbier like flavors out of it. about on par with what i expected. something i would definatly avoid in the future. tastes like a decent pumpkin ale mixed with bud."

"THE LABEL IS A MARKETING TACTIC! LOOKS COOL, MAKES ME FEEL AS IF I AM COOLER (THAN AN ORDINARY DAY OF COOLNESS) WHEN I HAVE ONE IN MY HAND. I ASKED MY WIFE TO GET ME A 12 PACK OF SHIPYARD PUMPKINHEAD...LIQUOR STORE WAS OUT OF STOCK SO SHE SUBSTITUTED SHOCK TOP. I YELLED, """NO SUBSTITUTIONS!""" HERES MY OPINION: AROMA---POPPED THE TOP AND WATCHED THE DRAGON TAIL-LIKE FOG HOVERING IN-BETWEEN THE AIR AND LIQUID, SPIRALING INTO NON-EXISTENCE. THE LABEL READS """PUMPKINS AND A VARIETY AUTUMNAL SPICES""" WHICH RAISED MY EXPECTATIONS; MY EXPECTATIONS WERE UNMET. TYPE IN """AROMA""" IN GOOGLE AND SHOCK TOP WILL NOT BE NUMBER 1. NOR WILL IT BE 2, 3 OR 4...YOU SEE WHERE I AM GOING WITH THIS. THIS BEER LACKS A DISTINCT AROMA. CINNAMON, PUMPKIN (SOMETHING REDNECKS DO DURING HALLOWEEN) AND NUTMEG HAVE A STRONG AROMA. I COOK QUITE A BIT AND HAVE USED ALL THREE. I FEEL AS IF THE FOLKS AT AH-BUSH DID NOT USE ANY OF THE THREE. AND YES, I DID FOLLOW THE POURING INSTRUCTIONS ON THE NECK. APPEARANCE--- LOOKS LIKE ANOTHER BUD PRODUCT. LETS INNOVATE FOLKS. TASTE---MEDIUM BITTER AFTER TASTE, LIGHT TO START. NO SHOCK-TOP. BING """TASTE""" AND YOU MAY GET SHOCK TOP AS A RESULT BECAUSE BING SUCKS. PALATE---LIGHT BODY, THIN POLAND SPRINGS LIKE TEXTURE, DIET COKE FIZZ, SLIGHT BITTER FINISH LEAVING YOU TO CRAVE FOR SOMETHING ELSE. CLOSE TO FINISHING THE BOTTLE, I SWALLOW AND MAKE A FACE (TO MYSELF) ; A CONTORTED, JUST SMELLED A DEAD BODY KINDA FACE. AND FOLKS, DONT LET THIS BEER GET WARM...NASTY.

"I wasn't expecting much here but this beer is actually not that bad. Descent flavor and depth. Above average among pumpkin beers. Not a favorite style of mine so I won't be going back to it regularly but descent for what it is."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not quite as thick or fulfilling as others, but average at best. Is okay to try, but like I said, average at best in the seasonal category."
"Presentation: Packaged in a custom twelve-ounce brown glass bottle, served in a Pilsener glass."

"Overall - This seems like more of a winter warmer but it's a pretty decent beer."
"This beer's ok. There are better pumpkin beers around, but this beer is easy to drink and flavorful enough to think about."
"Overall, I am not a big fan of pumpkin beers and this one lacks the pumpkin flavors, just the spices are present. As a holiday beer, I have had worse. It is pleasant enough. I would have no problem drinking one again."

"I thought this beer was overall pleasantly aromatic and tasty - it's a pumpkin-themed beer, and it tastes like pumpkin for sure. It definitely lives up to the theme."
""
""
""
""
""
"I actually didn't get much of a pumpkin taste at all until the last couple of sips towards the end at the bottom of the bottle, but then again what do you expect from an AB product."

"I had a random bottle left in my fridge from the fall, so I opened it tonight. Poured into a tall wheat glass. First thing I noticed was the fizzy carbonation, which formed a decent sized white head. Hazy orange body, but I was still able to see some unsightly floaties lurking in there. Smell had a fake aroma of holiday spices. Taste was not horrible, but I'd consider it average. There was some flavors of cinnamon and nutmeg, but tasted more like additives. Mouthfeel left a bit of a sticky feeling on the palate. Low abv made it simple to drink. Not a great pumpkin beer by any stretch of the imagination. But, it may open some Bud drinkers' minds to trying other pumpkin ales, so I won't knock this beer too hard."

"Sorry guys, I'm going to pass on this one. Better luck next time"
""
"O: I'm not going to say this is the best example of this beer, but I got to give it up to ST/AnnBus for putting some effort into this beer."
""
"Overall: As with many other macro attempts at creating more craft-oriented beer, this is pretty damn good. However, true to form, it also is just short of aggressiveness in flavor and aroma while also being too carbonated to make it a great beer. I would be fine having this again, but wouldn't search it out. This could also be a good beer to introduce to newbies."

"O: Overall this is an easy-drinking ale, but is nothing remarkable and not a beer I'd seek out."

"Those who are venturing out of the shaddow of industrial lagers may find comfort with this grainy-sweet version of Pumpkin Ales, but this is among one of the weakest brands on the market."
""
""
"Why does AB insist on producing mediocre beers when they have at their disposal the ability to produce some outstanding ales and lagers, if only they cared about the costumer a light and not just the almighty dollar."
"The beer was served in an American pint glass and looked really good. The appearance was a slightly brownish orange with a distinct pumpkin and wheat taste that lived up to its name. There was about one finger of creamy tan head but it rapidly dissipated. In spite of the small head, there was a good amount of lacing but not much carbonation. I found the beer to be overall lacking in mouthfeel and aroma, but still a good drinkable brew. What can I say? Its a pumpkin flavored Budweiser."
"Overall: Good job, A-B, you've surprised me with this offering. A delicious pumpkin ale that I would certainly buy again."

"O: Overall a drinkable beer not too bad."

"The hands-down best Pumpkin Wheat this season! Finishes smooth and leaves a warm pumpkin pie taste in your mouth. Be sure when pouring to leave about an inch at the bottom and stir the bottle to bring out the unfiltered wheat. Wonderful! I bought a case and am rationing it out keeping it all season long. Best with turkey or large banquet style Holiday meals! Enjoy!"

"O: A little tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, there are several other beers in the style better than this one."
"Pumpkin taste is noticable in the beginning of the first sip, then the cloves, nutmeg,and allspice take over the beer. The carbonation is a bit harsh, and has a strange aftertaste. Overall, I would rate this at the bottom of the pack of the pumpkin beers I have tried this year. The aftertaste is strange, and even turns my stomach a little. The original sips aren’t bad and the pumpkin flavor is slight, but there is something about this one that just does not agree. I don’t hate it, but I won’t be purchasing this one again"
"O-Overall this beer is just OK. It feels like the beer doesn't know what it wants to be - a hefeweizen or a pumpkin ale."

"For what it's worth, it's better than the Shock Top Wheat Ale base. Nothing special, though still better than what a majority of people drank during pumpkin carving."
""
""
"This is definitely drinkable, but not the best pumpkin ale out there."
"Overall: Surprisingly good beer from Michelob"
"O - Not a bad pumpkin ale, but nothing that's going to blow your pants off. If it's offered to you for free gladly accept."
"Overall - A decent pumpkin brew. It was a bit of a grab bag of spice, but it captured the style fairly well and didn't taste bad at all."
"O: Just so-so. Not unpleasant, but not enough pumpkin to be worthy of the name, even with the expected spices. Still, I find it easier to down than plain Shock Top."
"O- I like many types of brews, but I did not really like this one. Try another brand if looking for a pumpkin ale."
"D/O: This is an enjoyable change-of-pace, but the wheat makes it a bit heavy and detracts from it's drinkability for me, and the spices make it a bit of a one-trick pony."
"D: Fair (at best) wheat beer with okay use of spice (but the mix doesn’t seem quite right). Pumpkin is rather strange – sort of unripe – more vegetal than gourd. Still – tons more flavor and character than their mainstream affair. Okay to try, but it won’t be calling you back."
"An ok pumpkin to get introduced to the style. Not extremely flavorful but does give you a hint of the spice profile. Harpoon's pumpkin wheat is much better."
"O - Beer #1 in a Halloween eve Pumpkin tasting session. This one is over-spiced, particularly in the room-filling aroma. """Tastes like Halloween""" says a fellow tester."
"I poured the beer into a glass in two parts per instructions on the bottle. A three finger bisque colored head, that faded quick with a little bit of residual lacing, was evident. The second pour was 1/2""" from the bottom of the bottle swirled the spices and topped off the glass, which resulted in a orange and cloudy tint to the color. The aroma was spice with the nutmeg and cloves dominating and a flash of the cinnamon on the back end. The pumpkin made a light showing, but you can tell it is there in the aroma. There was no malt or hops that I could discern. The taste was decent. with the spice dominating the first of it fading to the pumpkin and then a little malt taste making a token appearance. Mouthfeel is ok with the carbonation tickling the tip of the tongue, but the body is somewhat watery. I was apprehensive in buying the beer at first, the raspberry beer was a disaster, and I took a few minutes staring down the beer in the cooler before giving it a try. Overall not a bad seasonal beer. Newer batches should concentrate on keeping the aroma and appearance while maybe bringing out the malt some."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. This pours a slightly hazy orangish color with a short lived white head. Smells mostly of pumpkin, spices and maybe a hint of wheat. Feel is medium to light with decent carbonation. The taste is pretty light, a little pumpkin and spice, kinda sweet, its okay but weaker than most of the pumpkin beers (but far better than the buffalo one)."
"An above average fall beer, but not great."
"Pours a cloudy reddish/orange color with a slight head that disolves quickly. Just as the beer reads, pumpkin and wheat scents are most noticable as well as those pumpkin pie spices. Surpringly great taste for a A.B. product. The uses of wheat and pumpkin work great together as the spices heighten the taste. The texture is fine but a tad to thin for me resulting in making this beer a very easy drinker. The finish is a little awkward but I imagine that is due to the wheat. A little more texture and volume would greatly help this beer. A better than average pumpkin beer and a surprise hit from A.B."
"Overall Drinkability - My least favorite Shock Top variety."
"T: There's a bit of pumpkin upfront, but then the taste goes pretty watery and you don't get much but a sort of wet wheat flavor. Lots of carbonation here and a lot of pumpkin, banana and bubblegum sweetness towards the end so that it feels somewhere in between a pumpkin ale and a pumpkin soda. As it warms, the pumpkin and cinnamon flavors on the finish begin to fade and some adjunct flavors creep in. It's not the worst pumpkin beer out there, but it's far from being one of the better examples of the style. Seek out something a bit more interesting. You won't be sorry."
"The pumpkin wheat title appealed to me. And although I can't say I'm completely dissatisfied, I will definately not rush out to buy this beer again."
"The beers was a very basic yellow beer with a lot of head. The smell of the beer wasnt anything great, just a bit of sweetness and pumpkin. The taste was not impressive at all. I get a little bit of pumpkin, but then after that just tasted like a basic adjunct beer. The mouthfeel was average and overall I dont find anything about this beer that makes me ever want it again. One of the worst Pumpkin beers I have ever had."
"O- I think I'd rather have a different pumpkin beer. Or a different wheat beer. Or both."
"overall i'm almost impressed with this...it's dumbed down enough to appeal to the masses but has the characteristics to be a really great fall seasonal should the brewer be let loose to let all the positive aspects of this pumpkin ale flow freely."
"Poured into a New Belgium globe. Typical inch thick creamy head that dissipates to a film, but never goes away. However, there is minimal if any lacing. Color of beer is a deep, deep orange, light amber. It smells sweet, bubble gum, cloves, nutmeg, maybe pumpkin spice. This tastes good, but it's all bubble gum sweetness and spices. A hint of pumpkin, I suppose. Mouthfeel is okay, just a tad watery. Overall for a pumpkin ale, it's not bad. But in the end, it feels like a mediocre mass-produced pumpkin ale, which it is. Buy one bottle, but not a 6 pack."
"I also forgot to mention that I can tell its a wheat beer and can notice the wheat smell and tastes in there as I drink it more and more. Definitely a surprise from the makers of Budweiser."
"O: Meh. Same stuff, different bottle. Hard to find a really good pumpkin IMO."
"C"
"Pours a hazy orange-ish color with an off white head. In the aroma, citrus and cinnamon. In the taste, cinnamon and citrus stand out, with notes of pumpkin and wheat. A small spice bite and medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a dry cinnamon and small citrus in the aftertaste. A different mix and a bit light, it's ok."
"O- A little disappointed with the taste and smell. Very mild for a pumpkin with a smooth, but bland taste-"
"Light orange, clear, no head, zero lacing. Smell was watery, grainy, background note of nutmeg or some type of pumpkin pie spice. Taste was mostly non-descript, grain, and the light pumpkin pie spices, almost as an after thought. This is a pumpkin beer for the masses, and nothing a craft beer enthusiast would be enthusiastic over."
"Shock Top Pumpkin Wheat is a cloudy, turbulent amber ale. The bubbles continually replenish a thin, swirling white film on the surface of it. Pumpkin and wheat are both present in the aroma, along with nutmeg and allspice. It's medium bodied, foamy and bubbly on the tongue. It leaves the mouth a little chalky. It's lightly flavored with lemony wheat. The spices come in later and the flavor and push it to be more savory. A light, green bitterness lingers after the swallow. This is kind of neat. It's like an American take on a dunkelweizen. The pumpkin isn't readily detectable. This is a nice autumn flavor for a beer."
"Overall: Certainly not the best pumpkin ale I have had this season...but also not the worst beer I've had this season."
"This beer stays true to its name: There is a strong wheat flavor with a mild sprinkling of pumpkin. It really has more of a hefeweisen feel to it than a pumpkin-inspired brew. It feels like the pumpkin/spice aspect was more of an afterthought. But, it does stay true--at least to a point--of its marketing as a pumpkin wheat."
"On tap at my watering hole, Old Chi Westy. Poured a fairly clear, somewhat orangeish color with no head and no lacing. Aromas of wheat and a bit of pumpkin spices. Taste was wheat and that's about it with no hop bitterness. After a full pint, I was still wondering """where's the pumpiin?'. Not disgusting by any means but very little going for it. I definitely would not seek out."
"Overall Impression- Is this a Pumpkin Ale or American Wheat beer? I know it states its a """Pumpkin Wheat""" but there definitely isn't any pumpkin in here that I could tell... Have to rate it as a Pumpkin Ale and I say avoid! Did not do ANYTHING for me except for the appearance after the pour. From the pour, I thought it was going to be excellent, but then went in for all the senses and my eyes were bigger than my stomach..."
"O- It was better than I expected but was still tended toward the average."
"If Blue Moon Pumpkin was too over-the-top in flavor for you, this is the beer for you."
"O: Nothing much stands out here. The pumpkin was also very mild."
"I give them some credit for trying something non-traditional, and in true AB fashion, it has """drinkability", but the citrusy and plastic-like quality was tough for me to accept in a pumpkin ale."
"Sort of like a one colored jigsaw puzzle, all the pieces are there and fit but there isn't much to it. The spice, pumpkin and beeriness just don't wow nor landing equally drinkable."
"Overall – a very good brew, especially given the popularity of the type during this time."
"To me this just another weak attempt at Pumpkin beer. I need more richness, this is a one & done"
"I can't promise I'll buy another 6 pack, mostly due to price and wanting to try new things."
"O: I'm sure there are better quality varieties out there, but for my first pumpkin ale, I have to say I quite enjoyed it. The spices remind me of the upcoming holidays, and that makes it all the better. I look forward to sampling many more pumpkin ales in the future! (And beers in general!)"
"Pours a murky copper color with a 1 inch foamy white head that settles to a film. Random streaks of lace cling to the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, pumpkin puree, sugars, and typical pumpkin pie spices. Taste is exactly like the smell with a very sweet malt flavor to go along with the pumpkin and spices. This beer has a good level of carbonation on tap with a crisp and clean mouthfeel. Overall, this is much better on tap than from the bottle. Every aspect of the beer was bumped up a notch to make this serving type a pretty good one. I would definitely recommend trying this on tap over from a bottle."
"Overall, not bad for a Shock Top, but the flavor profile is weak and this one comes off a little thin."
"Overall: Not a great beer in my opinion. Basically tastes like shock top and nutmeg; the mouthfeel is awful and I definitely do not want another one of these."
"This beer has good potential, the tastes are pretty well balanced, it's just too thin and watery for my liking."
"It's one of the best coors products I've had yet, although it's nothing special. Still, pumpkins are tough beers to make and this one wasn't half bad. Maybe one day the big three will figure out what a """Craft""" beer is after all."
"The beer pours a hazy orange color with a thick frothy off-white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a light pale and wheat malt scent along with a fresh pumpkin and spice aroma. The taste is decent. It has excellent pumpkin flavor with minimal cinnamon and nutmeg spicing. The malt profile keeps the flavor light, but I feel it would be better with the addition of more pale malts. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a drinkable beer, but I wonder why they decided to add pumpkin to an American wheat ale in instead of the traditional pale ale."
"There aren't too many great pumpkins out there, but Charlie Brown would agree, that this is one. It may have a bit more spice than pumpkin, but it works. I will buy this a again this fall."
"Over this beer is decent. Not bad, but nothing special. The price is right @ 7 dollars a 6er at my local BD. I probably won't pick this up again."
"A slightly hazed orange tinted copper hue with a light tan head fizzy and dwindling quickly, by the way no lacing left behind on my glass in this one. This one is abrasive with pumpkin pie spices almost a sugar coated cinnamon, nutmeg, all spice pumpkin pie kick going on. Is there a wheat beer in there somewhere I'm sure there is but where? Pumpkin pie spice massive loads of residual sugar, first off you must like these """pumpkin""" beers to begin with, and secondly I tend to like the ones with actual pumpkin flesh (the gourd) not just the pie spices. Mouthfeel is medium to light bodied a bit cloying with residual sugars and loads of pie spices. Definitely not the worse but by far something I'm going to be reaching for anytime soon, quit jumping on bandwagons and marketing trends and make some honestly good beer next time."
"O: This seems like a decent pumpkin offering, but there are many better choices available."
"This is a boring pumpkin beer but isn't horribly offensive."
"Actually a more exciting beer than expected. I'd grab one of these over a regular shock top anytime. Give to a yellow fizzy drinker and start the change over to better beer. It may encourage them that this one came from the big boys."
"O: I would say average for a P.A. could be improved on for sure. This is an AB product so with that in mind its not bad for them."
"Taste-A rather thin mix of clove, cinnamon,nutmeg and faint pumpkin flavor. A mish-mash of unbalanced flavors leading to a rather medicinal finish. Sessionable by ABV only. One and done for me."
"Overall: Not a horrible beer, but improvements could be made to it. I had this one with a light dinner, and it worked out ok. I probably won't buy this again, but I'd accept one if offered it by a friend."
"This brew pours out as a orange color with a fluffy white head on top. The head settles and fades into nothing, there is no lacing at all... The smell of the beer is a little spicy, has a little bit of a sweet aroma too. The taste is has a light spicy flavor... A little too light I think. The aftertaste is boring to me, it's too watered down I think. The mouthfeel is light and watery. Overall not surprised by this at all, really didn't expect something wonderful here. Basically I just wanted to try it."
"Overall- Drinkable but there are better pumpkin beers out there."
"Not as bad as I though it would be, honestly. I've had far better pumpkins, but I've had worse as well. The biggest criticism is the lack of pumpkin taste. It's more of a sweetish wheat beer with a hint of pumpkin than a true pumpkin ale to me. Wouldn't be my number one pick but I wouldn't turn it down."
"O- there are so many better options for pumpkin beer out there. I picked up a single of this on a whim to see if AB could do something solid like they did with the raspberry wheat. They failed miserably"
"Bottle marked 112288G70. Sampled on September 22, 2011. The pour is a cloudy copper color with a lot of carbonation but little head to top it off. On the nose there is a pleasing enough note of pumpkin spices and wheat.The body tended to be thinner than most. The pumpkin was subtle and mild in the taste as it gave way to a more bitter experience with a dash of spices and a near dry ending."
"Much better than regular shock top. Light, creamy, and grainy. Overall, an easy to drink, subtle, nicely balanced pumpkin wheat beer."
"Drinkability: I'm just glad I purchased this in a mix-a-six pumpkin variety pack that was already made up, because after this I would never even look at this beer on the shelf again. A very lazy example of a brewer trying as hard as possible to replicate a popular style of beer and completley overlooking the fact that just adding some autumnal spices in here will not cut it. The aroma isn't too bad, but the overabundance of allspice in the actual flavor and the lack thereof of any real pumpkin flavors from the spices is a huge letdown."
"An all right pumpkin beer, I suppose, nothing offensive, just a little too, well, Shock Top-tasting.  Went well enough with the start of my re-acquaintance with Americana (mid-west style) - hockey and hot wings."
"O: decent pumpkin, but nothing to go out of my way for again"
"Overall: Didn't dig it. When you're making Blue Moon Harvest Moon look like a real treat, you know you've screwed up."
"O: Not a bad beer for the price, I would have preferred more of the pumpkin spice. Overall a beer i would try again but was expecting more of a kick of spice. Out of the 'Shock Tops' probably my favorite one."
"Doesnt touch the upper echelons of pumpkin greats, i.e, Pumpking, Weyerbachers, or Punkin, but decent, average and a good beginner beer for people trying their first pumkin beer, as it is somewhat of an aquired taste."
"O: Not a bad little beer from Busch... Very drinkable brew... session worthy with a good ABV.... Good favor and enjoyable... I will pick this one up again... Might even be a pretty good gateway beer."
"O: Avoid this beer, It could have been good, or at least acceptable, but it is neither. Blue Moon Makes a non offensive Pumpkin ale, Sam Adams makes a pretty good and balanced one. Even Buffalo Bills is better than this crap. Sorry Shocktop Maybe next year"
"O- Overall, this does not stand up to some of the better pumpkin beers. What it does provide is a mainstream pumpkin beer that will probably turn on a lot of people to the style who have never tried one before."
"O - Not what I like in pumpkin beers and definitely prefer Jack's Pumpkin Spice over this. Still, it's not as bad as I was expecting. Definitely nothing like a wheat, though."
"O - This was surprisingly good. There's not really a wheat presence but it is a nice, affordable pumpkin brew. Could be one of those gateway beers."
"first off I wanna say that I'm not a huge fan of shock top in general but do do try every pumpkin beer I can get my hands on so I thought I would give this a go. It pours a nice cloudy brownish gold. The smell is surprisingly spicy. A nice amount of cinnamon and pumpkin spice. It's not as strong as some other pumpkin beers in the smell department but it is a worthy effort. The taste is also a surprise... This is a pretyy dang good pumpkin beer. There is a rush of holiday spices at the finish of this beer. Way more than I expected. This beer is a pretty good pumpkin beer and is by far the best of the beers from shock top."
"Overall an OK beer. Certainly not one of the best pumpkin beers but inoffensive and decent enough to finish. Still now that I have tasted it I have better beers to drink."
"Very average pumpkin appearance. Dark Honey color, with a hint of hazelnut color. The smel also is an average pumpkin spices essences. Nutmeg, Honey, Pumpkin, coriander, cinnamon. Low carbonation. The mouthfeel is not soo watery, something that a like in beers. Ginger, wheat, honey, pumpkin going around."
"Poured a 2.5""" off-white head. Hazy raw sienna and burnt orange colored body. Smells mildly of pumpkin pie spices, and not overdone. Taste is a fairly sweet wheat beer style with an even milder spice profile in the taste than in the smell. Very lightweight body. Fully drinkable and acceptable but nothing special"
"Serving type: bottle; into a pint glass (following the serving instructions on the bottle)"
"O: As much as I'd like to say otherwise, this was pretty decent."
"Pours a cloudy, copper color. 1/4 inch head of a white color. Slight retention and poor lacing. Smells of sweet malt, pumpkin, and spices (nutmeg, all spice, cardamon?). Fits the style of a Pumpkin Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, pumpkin, spice, and slight pale malt. Overall, good blend, decent aroma, feel, but average body."
"The flavor is metallic, with a weird artificial-tasting pumpkin-spice mix. To boot, this one's watery and thin-bodied. There's something missing here. Avoid!"
"Pours out a hazy orange with a thin white head that has good retention and moderate lacing. The carbonation is decent and the smell is mainly nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves and a weak pumpkin scent. The taste starts out with a strong hit of bitterness, and than some spices. The spices overtake the pumpkin taste and don't get any pumpkin or wheat until the finish. The mouthfeel is rather watery and causes the pumpkin flavor to be weaker than it should be. Overall this would be a lot better if it was not as watery and had more pumpkin to the taste and the spices were not quite as strong at the beginning of each sip of beer. Not bad tasting, but there are other pumpkin ales a lot better out there."
"Pumpkin in a wheat beer actually seems like a pretty good idea. I'm surprised there aren't more examples."
"Overall: It's not a great beer but it's an improvement over most Shock Top/Anheuser-Busch products. It has a decent pumpkin flavor and is thoroughly sessionable. So, for a fall seasonal, you could certainly do much worse..."
"This ia a beer to get into crafts and pumpkin ales. Cheers!"
"With its affordability and milder tastes, I would recommend this as an intro to the style."
"A nice feel to this brew. Could use a bigger malt bill, but drinkable nonetheless."
"O: Not bad for the price."
"M/O: Very crisp and drinkable. the beer has some nice simple flavors. The wheat aspect is really lost on the beer because it really only changes the nose. Very decent overall."
"Better than I expected but the thin flavor and mouthfeel bring down what could be a decent ale. The sweetness and spices aren't supported by a watery overall feel."
"This is no Dogfish or even as good as UFO Pumpkin but I'd buy another sixer anytime."
" Cheers!"
"12oz bottle purchased as part of a six-pack at Shaw's in North Hampton. Pours a murky dark amber body with about an inch of short-lived off-white head. Smells like pumpkin pie spice with hints of some nutty phenols. Tastes sweet and spicy, with pumpkin pie spice playing a big roll but not over-doing it. Malt, nut, and bread also help comprise the flavor. Medium-bodied with moderate carbonation. An easy drinker. A lot better than expected. Balanced, not a spice bomb, and while it's not the the most complex beer out there, it keeps things interesting. I'm wondering if this is supplanting Jack's Pumpkin Spice Ale - this one is definitely a better version in my opinion."
"I'll pass. They got it right with the original Shock Top. I don't see the need for more variations."
"Pours a nice fluffy head that lingers for a little bit. Also has a pretty brown color. It is very drinkable, almost too drinkable considering what I was looking for and expecting. There is not nearly enough pumpkin, nutmeg, and cinnamon flavor/smell. If AB doubled the amount of flavoring, this would be one heck of a drink. Regardless, it is not a bad buy."
"While it's not the best pumpkin beer I've ever had, it's far from the worse. I'm such a big fan of the style, that I will definitely buy more of this in the next couple months."
"I really enjoyed this one, however I am still waitng for the new pumpkin beer that stands above the others. It was as if you were biting down on a fresh warm pumpkin beer and very pleasant spices"
"Overall, a very solid beer for the price. Not just that, it's something that could probably go for more, as it is above some of the more """complex""" beers out there. Something that will be enjoyed over and over again during the fall months. Cheers."
"Overall, another pretty average Pumpkin brew; I understand this one replaces the Michelob / AB Jack's Pumpkin Spice brew....not much different."
