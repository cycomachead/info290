Try a Whole Hog Pumpkin or that tsp of vanilla extract per bottle beer that everyone on BA likes so much Pumking. This falls in line with alot of the Wolaver's stuff I've had in that it's not a wow beer, but there's also not much wrong with it.  It's a beer you aren't going to fall in love with, but it's also an easy drinker in a category that seems to go way overboard with flavors.  If you're gonna have just one, this probably isn't the one, but It's a nice followup to drink after punching yourself in the face with some of the other pumpkins out there.  Try it after you drank something called Imperial Pumpkin something or other and you'll be glad you did.","thebeersrallright","Oct 14, 2014"

There’s also a good deal of fall spices, particularly cinnamon, though the sweetness takes over. The taste follows, very sweet up front and at the end, with a bit of a toffee character to the malt. The middle has some of the actual pumpkin flavor, with weird banana notes. Overall, this one was too sweet for me. I assume Wolaver’s uses only organic pumpkins in the brew process, but the flavor tastes similar to artificial pumpkin to me.","asaharyev","Feb 16, 2014"

Mouthfeel was medium and the cinnamon was big and immediate on the tongue. The finish was semi-dry from the spices and I felt as though I had been chewing a stick of Big Red when I was finished.

There's a hint of soapiness in there too, but not unpleasant. Medium-light bodied with a tough of astringency. Overall it's a decent beer. I prefer over-dry and over-spiced to cloyingly sweet in pumpkin beers. I'm not sure I'd go back for this one as it's a bit too dry and hoppy for a pumpkin beer, but it's a decent beer.","spokeydonkey","Sep 02, 2013"

The beer's head is unremarkable and minimal lacing remains. The pumpkin flavor tastes fresh, and there's just a touch of spice along with it. Hops and malt are there to balance fairly well with the pumpkin. The mouthfeel is very smooth but could use a bit more carbonation to pick this one up. Overall, this was enjoyable, but mainly just because I like the style. I disagree with many reviewers who say that it tastes """bland"""--but maybe this year's release has more pumpkin flavor. Anyway, while I enjoyed it, I won't be going out of my way to find it again.","DeFaz","Aug 02, 2013"

Aromas are very sweet, with a pumpkin and sweet potato backbone supporting a light spice blend of nutmeg and all-spice. Flavors are light, with a caramel syrup foundation that overpowers any of the harvest flavors. The spicing becomes an afterthought, and you might be able to catch a hint of nutmeg if you really swish it around in your mouth. Sharp, spiced aftertaste on a light, wilting body. The finish is limp, but heavily roasted and spiced at the very end. A final pop for a brew that was fading fast on the palate. Not a great brew.","GarthDanielson","Nov 23, 2012"

I would agree with others that as a pumpkin beer it definitely could pop in the flavour category a bit more, along with being a little heavier/malty. I'm all for pumpkin beers that ACTUALLY use real pumpkin, and organic at that, but was left wanting more with this one. If you're run out of pumpkin beers to try in your store, or are in the Vermont area, it's worth a try, but not to keep going back to unless you like light beers....then hey, maybe it's for you.","4ster","Oct 20, 2012"

3.1,-10.4,3,3,3,4,3,"D - A very interesting beer to say the least. I definitely could not drink more than one of these a night, and highly doubt I will ever buy a sixer of this again.

2.81,-18.8,4,3,2.5,3.5,2.5,"Pours a slightly clouded amber brown with a creme head. The spices grabbed my nose as I was pouring, and I didn't like. Perfumed clove is dominant. Bleh. Flavor carries the same. Way too much man. Too much spices, no evident pumpkin. Feel is...eh who cares. I can't drink this.","RblWthACoz","Oct 09, 2008"
3.92,13.3,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Pours a typical amber-orange body. Very hazy (which is fine). Not much head. Not much lacing. There's an odd tart note to this beer that I initially found off-putting right out of the fridge, but which I then came to enjoy as it warmed a bit. It's unique. Most pumpkin beers tend to have a sweet malty base, and some over do it. Of course, that's true for the spice as well, and I think this almost falls into that category. It's not so heavy handed that it builds on the palate or anything, but it IS spicy. Apart from that my only complaint is that the head retention is limited, but that's probably due at least in part to the spicing. LOTS of ginger. A healthy dose of cinnamon. Seemingly all-spice. I question where that tartness is coming from though. Is it just the pH of the brew? Probably not. Is it the heavy use of ginger? Could be. It's slightly thin as well, and perhaps that has something to do with it. I dunno. In any case, it's a little quirky but I kind of like it.","NeroFiddled","Oct 08, 2008"
2.24,-35.3,3.5,2,2,2.5,2.5,"this is overpowered by ginger fallowed by an obnoxious wave of cinimmon. the pumpkin was slightly present but was bland and lost in the great wave of spice. this is by far the worst pumpkin ale that i have ever had, this is also the first drain pour that i have had in a long time, you should never try this one ever","orcasteve","Oct 08, 2008"
3.03,-12.4,3.5,3,3,3,3,"Pours a reddish body with a good one-finger head that stays around a little bit. Thin smell of faint caramel malt and spices; little hops. A little funky with the amount of sourness in this beer; retains some malty taste along with pumpkin spice but not a great beer. Also a little thinnish for me; i prefer my pumpkin ales heavy with the pumpkin and nutmeg flaovr - this isn't one of them.","clayrock81","Oct 06, 2008"
2.94,-15,4,5,2,3,2,"This beer went from a lot of potential to not much in a short amount of time. As I poured it the whole room began to smell like a fresh baked pumpkin pie... fantastic aroma. Appearance wise its a hazy golden pumpkin color... beautiful. Taste wise is where it begins to falter. Up front its good with some nice fall spices to go along with some spices, but then this very sour aftertaste is felt after the initial hit on the palette. This sourness is overwhelming and kills what could have been a great beer. Tough to drink after that.","oriolesfan4","Oct 06, 2008"

3.45,-0.3,4,4,3,3.5,3.5,"big wolavers fan, had to try this one. i really dig the whole grown local brewed local concept, sadly the beer didn't deliver as well as it could. pours a solid amber, nice white head. the smell isn't overpowering but the spice notes are definitly present. the initial taste, as others have said, is a mouthful of pumpkin but watered down kind of. the tartness is what suprised me most. not exactly what i expected, but at the same time very drinkable and not overpowering. i almost like it more than other pumpkin ales that are so in your face with flavor that drinking more than one or two is impossible. this one is almost, dare i say, sessionable. not something i'd run uphill barefoot in a snowstorm to get, but fair enough.","scarletfire79","Sep 27, 2008"

2.58,-25.4,4,3.5,2,3,2,"Well...as a long-time fan (and consumer) of Wolaver's (and Otter Creek), I must admit that I am a little bit disappointed with this attempt. I love the concept of a locally and organically brewed (and grown) beer, and I really do enjoy pumpkin ales, especially this time of year. That said, this version falls short of Wolaver's typical standards. The beer does pour nicely, with a pale-white head, and the color is a wonderful -- and appropriate -- shade of amber. The nose is nice as well: cinnamon, cloves, and the usual suspects for a pumpkin ale, but not in a cloying sort of way. The taste, however, is where this offering falls short: after an initial mouth full of pumpkin, the taste quickly turns tart/sour, detracting from the overall enjoyment, and quickly banishing from your mind (and your taste buds) the initial flavors. This is not a horrible beer, but unless the sourness is cleaned up, I do not think I would get this again. Wolaver's Oatmeal Stout, however, is a different story...","stephendedalus","Sep 24, 2008"
3.72,7.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Pours a slightly hazy pumpkin-cooper color with an average white head that settled into a sparse cap. The aroma is of pumpkin, allspice, and nutmeg; more of an earthy or powdery scent. The taste hits with a strong pumpkin and grain flavor followed by a lemony tart and some light nutmeg and allspice. Some earthy hop flavors round out the brew. Definitely used real pumpkin with this one. Has an odd sweetness, probably from the pumpkin and grain, perhaps it could have used more body. The feel is light and well carbonated, sweet and spicy yet good balance. The brew is definitely takes on more of a pumpkin flavor than pumpkin pie. Some odd flavors but overall quite solid. Nice earthy autumn time brew.","Gmann","Sep 19, 2008"
3.88,12.1,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Drinkability: A very wild and weird yet solid pumpkin ale. I can see how people may not like this, but I like it a lot, and I'm glad I have a few more. Bitter and balanced and weird, if you're down for that, then certainly try it, but as far as a normal version of the style, this isn't it.","asabreed","Sep 19, 2008"
2.72,-21.4,3,3.5,2.5,3,2,"Hazy amber with an off-white head. Pleasing aroma of cinnamon and pie crust. Here is why people are trashing this beer - a burst of cinnamon on the flavor quickly turns sour with metallic notes and dill pickle! Ouch. medium body, and more cinnamon and sourness on the finish. Something went wrong. I hope they fix it next year, because this is their first try on this. Please don't make me wish I had an A-B pumpkin beer instead of this one.

3.15,-9,3.5,3.5,3,3,3,"Not a bad pumpkin ale by any means. Nothing out of the ordinary however, unfortunately. A light bitter ale with the classic pumkin spices. Watery in mouthfeel with an overdone all spice. Still not bad and better than many of the un-imaginitive pumpkin beers. Can we get more Alpine brewing, Southern Tier, Midnight Sun, and Dogfish pumpkin beers out there. The base is what is what it's all about.","mcallister","Sep 13, 2008"
3.9,12.7,4,4,4,4,3.5,"This ale has a warming effect to it, and I don't think it can be attributed to the alcohol as I would guess it is quite moderate. The pumpkin and spicing just gives you that warm feeling of late summer/early fall and the harvest season in the northeast. Drinking pumpkin ales fresh is key in my opinion, and this one right now is very fresh and tasty. Although not one of my more favorite styles, pumpkin ales are always fun to visit in September/October to complement the colorful leaves and chilly air, and Wolaver's rendition has not disappointed.","kkosmoski","Sep 12, 2008"

2.45,-29.2,3.5,3.5,2,2,2,"This is a pretty lousy pumpkin ale, as far as the style goes. It pours an amber color with a decent head and retention. The aroma is unmistakably pumpkin, some nutmeg, some spices, some maltiness in there too. The taste is quite imbalanced. There is a definite pumpkin flavor, but it is compromised by the strong nutmeg, rind, and sharp spices. The pumpkin flavor should be sweet, and it is just sitting on top of a raw bitterness. This is an unpleasant brew, from an otherwise decent brewery.","albern","Sep 05, 2008"
3.1,-10.4,4,4,2.5,3,3,"Bought a lone bottle from City Mark-Up on a whim. Poured out a slightly hazy amber color leaning towards the honey side. Three finger head of tan with orange highlighted foam. Aromas of pumpkin, allspice and nutmeg with some subtle malt behind that. Slightly sour at first and a little off. Reminds me of a beer that has been light-f'ed. The pumpkin is there but it's not very pleasant because it lacks sweetness. Orange peel and nutmeg are too heavy giving the hops a bitter, astringent character. Laces quite well but the mouthfeel is a little fizzy and thin. Gotta say, after the great way it looks I was very disappointed with this beer.","thekevlarkid","Sep 02, 2008"

It has a very aggressive pumpkin flavor with little in the way of malt character. The spices are present, but weak comparitively. It's easy going down, but quite dry and astringent. The mouthfeel is nothing to speak of. It's a medium bodied beer with almost no carbonation. This is a very forgettable brew. If it were well carbonated I may be singing a different tune.
