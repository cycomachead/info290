"Too much rum, not enough else."

""
"Too sweet, too much yam"
"Apparently my rating of 1 for taste is an outlier. In terms of flavor, I'd have to describe it as """overwhelmingly, nauseatingly sweet.""" Sorry, but it made me gag."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The best beer I ever tasted."
""
"Exceptional, but too expensive and rare. Basically, I loved it, but wish I could have it again."
"Disappointing as I had been wanting to try this for years. This definitely has potential. Perhaps some age will mellow it out."
"Not a fan of the style which could lead to the lower rating.  Too much rum came through and not enough barrel flavor.  Didn't detect the nutmeg or cinnamon either."
""
""
""
""
"This is so much sweeter than I expected it to be, with loads of molasses, toffee and cane sugar, kicking my teeths in, finished off wih an intense alcoholic burn, while the barrel's woodenness gets almost swallowed entirely by the sugar. The malt foundations gets overpowered by the sweetness already during the very beginning, joined by a sharp alcoholic impact, and only manages to try finding its balance during a later stage, due to the calming herbs and spices, which all in all aren't capable to stop the sugar madness too. The rum barrel is very well integrated though, providing a burning, slightly bitter counterpart to the sugar, which would result into a slightly dry, medicine-like impression, if it wasn't for the muddy, leafy herbs of mace, cardamon and vanilla, to provide some sort of balance. FInishes with caramelized malts among molasses and an confirming booziness, leaving enough space on the palate for the actual pumpkin to fit in, supported by wooden herbs."
"Aroma of ABV, pumpkin/yam, rum, vanilla, nutmeg, other spices, butterscotch.  Taste sweet malty pumpkin, ABV, spices, toffee, rum, butterscotch."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: there should be a warning label on this beer for diabetics.  It is good, but holy crap the it's like drinking a pint of syrup."
""
""
""
"This is a sweeter beer, to be sure.  It also shows its power a bit.  If you are not a fan of a sweeter beer, you can save your money.  If you like real pumpkin beers, and aren't dissuaded by the previous sentence, give this a try at least once.  Beware, it's likely a slow sipper based on its ABV and sweetness."
"T: Blast of sour mash and green apple up front with sweet, rich notes of rum and bourbon barrel wood that follow. ABV tastes strong but well masked at 16.7%. Touches of vanilla and cherry linger on the tongue. Balanced carbonation, milky, smooth mouthfeel overall."
""
""
"Pours a beautiful burnt orange. Initial nose is rum, pumpkin, brown sugar, molasses. First taste and holy sweet pumpkin Batman! After I got past the initial diabetic shock and let it warm, the taste follows the nose. If you were to caramelize some pumpkin in butter with brown sugar and then deglaze it with a dfh 120, that is pretty much the flavor you get from this beast. Excellent mouth feel and hardly any booze burn (though halfway through the glass my equilibrium can definitely detect the booze). Excellent brew."
""
"Sweet almost like a barleywine"
"12oz bottle $10.99. I'd heard about this beer for years and finally capitulated to the high price. To start off it looks like shit, tons of sediment mixed throughout what would have been a pretty beer. Aroma is this strange melange of pumpkin, spice, and booze. The flavor is very sweet, spices, pumpkin and booze. My first couple sips had me ready to pour it out but it grew on me and I finished my glass. Still, this one is not for me."
""
"Very good and pleasant beer. Definitely worth putting one or two to cellar."
""
""
""
""
"This brew is a deep, dark amber. Smells of alcohol & a fruity sweetness. The initial taste mirrors that smell with dark molasses & roasted pumpkin flavors. That is followed up by a boozy shot of cinnamon & other spices. I think the rum adds a slight warming into the finish. Despite the high abv popping through, this is a very tasty pumpkin offering that y'all need to go pickup. Good brew to sip next to the firepit after sundown."
"Super hot. Full of sugar and sweetness. I split this 12 oz """beer""" and I 'm glad I did. Full of flavor. Not any pumpkin at all but tons of sugary goodness. Should have aged this beer to let it cool down."
"Won't have again; but, if you like boozy BA beers and/or pumpkin beers, you can't go wrong, this has got to be the cream of the crop for you : )   (3.75)"
"I can't get into the beers that are this hard as much as I'd like, though it could be a good enough sipper for sure."
"Rum and pumpkin, what more do you need?"
"Had high expectations, but taste was too sweet and miserable."
"An amazing pumpkin beer, every time i drink it I find something else I didn't notice before. Seriously need to buy it when you see it; it will be off the shelf very shortly."
""
""
"Wow, Avery. Avery, Avery, Avery...how did you do this? A boozy, rum soaked pumpkin ale sounds like a gimmick on paper. But this beer is a watershed in the big beer category. Amazing, top notch, world class. Beautiful."
""
""
"This is definitely a brewing accomplishment- but not one I'm sure needed to be accomplished. It's just too much for the sake of being too much. It does taste good, for about 2 oz or so."

"Pours a clear dark orange to amber color with no head. Aroma is huge alcohol, almost mediciny. Also get some fruity esters and vanilla, along with just a slight rum hint. The taste is super sweet, like dark molasses on the front end, with some nice lingering pumpkin and spice notes. Alcohol is very present. The mouthfeel was hot and a little oily feeling, but in a nice way. Super tasty beer- I haven't had a bad barrel-aged beer from Avery yet."
"Had this as a Thanksgiving  digestif a few hours after the main course and dessert. I am hoping to get another bottle to age for next year. It was excellent fresh but I believe that it has the potential to be epic with some age on it."

"2014 batch, fridge temp into a snifter and allowed to warm. This is an extremely—bordering on obscenely—sweet beer. Like, it should carry a warning for diabetics. There's very minimal alcohol heat, and the rum is quite muted (except for the degree to which it contributes to the, again, extraordinary sweetness). As it warms, a bit of complexity begins to emerge, most notably in the form of an almost bacon-y aftertaste (which is a good thing). Overall, this is very tasty, but it's a bit one-dimensional and lacking the complexity I get from the truly world-class barrel-aged offerings."

"O- Pretty fine beer. If you do rum, do this...."
""
""
"On tap at Ginger Man NYC. First sip was """too sweet", next two or three less so. By the fourth sip I was on board. Complex flavor that balanced the high alcohol perfectly. Rum? I caught hints,  which is exactly what made this a perfect beer to me. Full of subtle flavors that kept me going back and discovering more with each taste."

"I'll revisit it after it's aged a bit.  For me, fresh, this beer was super hot, boozy, and overly sweet.  I enjoyed the spice and pumpkin aroma and flavor, but the sweetness was overpowering for me.  Hopefully in time it ages into a wonderful beverage."
""
"Batch No. 3, bottled Sept 6, 2013. Poured into a snifter, the beer is a hazy, muddled, opaque, amber-brown coloring, with no head whatsoever. Aromas of booze, pumpkin sweetness, brown sugar, woody notes, tangy caramel, and a subtle spice blend of cinnamon and nutmeg. Flavors are very layered, with a rich pumpkin bread characteristic of sweet pumpkin, cinnamon, and nutmeg, leading the way, followed by an immediate blast of booze, both in strength and warmth. Woody and vanilla notes come through in highlights, as well as some brown sugar and heavy molasses characteristics. This thing is a beast. Slick, oily, robust bodied, with a huge warming factor as you drink. The aftertaste is surprisingly light on booze, and more of a sit down and chat with the pumpkin and spice blend. Very pleasant surprise. The finish is slick, quick, and surprisingly clean, with only the slightest candi sugar linger. Great beer!"

"this beer is fantastic. the rum, pumpkin and spices come all together and just make  a great beer."

"Tasted from a 12 ounce bottle on January 4, 2015.  Bottled Sept 22 2014"
""
""
""
""
""
"Nothing like the average pumpkin beer, although I don't think I could drink much more than 1 at a setting, this would be perfect around the campfire, on a cool fall night."
"This year's batch they call 18.5%. I believe it. Not quite revolting, but the 8 oz glass was more than the two of us could get through."
""
""

""

"As during that ill-advised 'nightcap' in metro Denver, the bristling threat of this offering (not necessary to detail here, look it up, or read a label) seems to just bleed away, once you dive in with both feet.  Large, fully of bloated pumpkin pie, barleywine-esque malt, and actually polite rum barrel booze.  What's not to like, especially when it's drinking this well, this soon?"
"whoa! As billed the 2014 Rumpkin is a big hit of rum followed by a mellow pumpkin flavor. Great right away, and cannot wait to see how it ages."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: What it all comes down to is this, this brew as expensive as it is an absolute delight. Worth every penny and worth the trouble looking for it. It is literally dessert in a glass. Already one of my top three pumpkins, salud!"
""
""
""
""
"An over-the-top pumpkin ale styling that punches your senses with a heavy sweetness. There is so much sugar action going on that it does a good job of hiding the high ABV. Definitely unbalanced with the huge sweetness, but it does offer a rather varied array of flavors although the pumpkin aspect is pretty low-key. For the adventurous..."

"Take pumpkin pie and banana bread, smash together and add a healthy splash of oak aged booze. By far the best pumpkin beer I've ever tasted. Sweet, boozy, spicy. I almost wish it was snowing while I drink this"
""
""
""
""
"On tap on Tapwerks in an 8 oz snifter. Dark red/amber caramel color with very little head produced.  Very sweet aroma of rum, caramel, and cinnamon. The taste is interesting.  Very sweet at the start with caramel candy flavors, slight cinnamon, nutmeg, banana bread ,vanilla, and cane sugar rum flavors. Definitely some alcohol warmth, but surprisingly not boozy.  As this warms up its gets way too sweet and cloying to point of being unpleasant.  Mouthfeel is sticky, full ,and cloying towards the finish.  Overall, its good, especially at first, but  way too sweet towards the end.  Plenty of rum flavor and sweet candy sugar, but it becomes too much and even at 8 oz it was hard to finish.  I'd have it again, but I'd prefer an even smaller portion.  (82/100)"

"Plenty of pumpkin pie spice and moderate rum.  Tasty but very sweet. The rum is a nice touch.   Thick mouthfeel. Glad I tried 5 oz of it today.  I enjoyed it but not as much as other pumpkin beers I've had this season at 1/3 to 1/2 as much alcohol."
""
""
""
""
"Just fantastic."
""
""
""
""
"It is, simply, the best pumpkin beer I've ever had.  The sweetness of the rum barrel perfectly goes with the pumpkin flavoring.  The high alcohol is totally masked, making this an extraordinarily enjoyable drink.  Pump[KY]n is also good, but this is on another planet."
""
"This beer is no joke. It's high ABV is very noticeable & it burns in a good way! Look for it & trade for it! If you like a stout that's sweet with a high ABV, you'll love this!"

"O: a real nice pumpkin ale - rum barrels seem to consistently bring pineapple to mind for me - this beer brings savory vegetals and tropical fruits together in a smooth fashion - sure to please fans of big boozy pumpkin ales."
""

""
""
"Be warned, it is a beast of a killer brew."
""

""

"Tastes the same, extremely rich, sweet, and boozy. Sticky sweet caramel, marzipan, oaky vanilla, toasted plantains. Low carb with astringent booze. Though extremely sweet, the flavor profile is one I'm partial to, it's pretty similar to Samaels. Overall it is what it is, tastes and smells pretty nice, though not much in the way of distinctive rum/pumpkin elements."
""
""
"Overly sweet could harld drink a taste of it"
" The taste is excellent with a nice pumpkin quality and slight clove-like spice and mild caramel intertwined with a subtle spicy cinnamon woodiness with the rum barrels mild molassess and toasted character with woody undertones and spicy presence of alcohol. There is a good amount of pumpkin sweetness and malt in the taste but pretty rum barrel dominant as it warms with spiced flavor and alcohol into the finish. Overall a great blend of a strong ale with spice and the pumpkin quality still noticeable in the taste with rum enjoyable as an enhancement to the base."

"O:  This beer is absolutely delicious. I drank half the bottle at a temperature of 59F. It could have a been cooler initially, but was still stunning. The booze is subdued for something so strong, yet it's clear you are drinking a huge beer. An in your face cornucopia of fall flavors with subdued spices."

"Taste is really smooth, unbelievably so actually. Cinnamon dusted pumpkin pie with a floater of Meyers Dark rum. Damn...I didnt realize this beer was as good as it is...fantastic! More like a liqueur than a beer, but the dark fruits know no bounds. This is one of those beers I need to get more of for sure and kicking myself for waiting so long to try it. Well done Avery."

"O- This beer is very sweet, a bit too sweet for me to finish one bottle by myself, should have split this with someone. It took me about 2 hours to drink the thing. After a while thought it really grew on me, maybe I was just getting drunk. An interesting beer that I'm really going back and forth on a lot of aspects of the flavor but ultimately it's just too sweet for me to really find it outstanding, and I generally love sweet beers like Wee Heavys and English Barleywines."
"12 oz. bottle. Enjoyed this on Thanksgiving Day with a slice of pecan pie and also pumpkin pie. Poured a dark amber color with minimal head. Smells incredible, spiced rum, spices, caramel, malt. Tastes-Whoa! The high ABV is not hidden at all but still has amazing flavors. Pumpkin? Pretty subtle. Spiced rum dominates. Finishes hot. I shared the bottle which was a good idea. Perfect end to a huge Thanksgiving day meal and paired very well with dessert."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm just not really sure how to describe what I was tasting. Was like drinking a really thick, mulled cider. Lots of rum, cloves, cinnamon, and alcohol burn. Not very smooth and I don't really feel like the flavors complimented each other. Glad I was given the opportunity to try this, but don't really feel l need another. Possibly would be better with aging."

"I first had this beer at FOBAB in 2012 and recalled adoring it. This was my first chance to revisit it and I'm hoping it becomes an annual thing. I can't recommend this beer enough if you're a fan of big, spicy-sweet yam and pumpkin beers. I do wish I'd enjoyed one at the height of the Autumn months. This would be an absolute gem on a crisp Autumn day."

"O-There was no need for this high of alcohol. Rum barrel aging was a good idea but it threw off the balance."
"Bottle share at Proof courtesy of scotchzi. Opaque orangey amber. Zero head, but who cares? Aroma reminds me of hot cider: spice (cinnamon, clove) sweet almost burnt sugar, and pumpkin replaces the apple, but there is a touch of baked apple too. Taste is very similar, but a warm spiced rum comes through too. Thin-medium body with almost no carbonation; but who cares? Extremely well thought out brew, and yummy as hell. Maybe my new favorite pumpkin?"
"Alcohol burn is all I'm getting.  A sweet, sugary mess."
""

"Batch #3 bottle that I picked up in San Diego for $13.99. Better be good. Part of a 2-man tasting alongside Good Gourd Almighty and Almanac Heirloom Pumpkin. Pours a slightly cloudy dark orange without much head. Aroma of spiced rum, pumpkins, a little cinnamon and nutmeg. Flavor is sweet caramel and light butterscotch, a little pumpkin fruit, light cinnamon and nutmeg spice, brown sugar, a bit of marshmallow cream. The sweetness is very nice here. Alcohol warmth is like whoah, as expected. Sweet, not quite syrupy mouthfeel with medium to low carbonation. Overall I like this a lot, and it is a huge improvement over the disappointment that was Good Gourd Almighty that we had right before this one."
"O: Ridiculously huge and over the top. I love it. An easy sipper, like a fine cognac or cordial. It really is sweet to the point of being cloying, but it just works here. This is the biggest pumpkin beer I've ever come across, and one of the most unique. I look forward to its release every year. Makes for a nice, slow dessert sipper."
""
""
"O: One wild ride of a beer. It is thick, deep, and complex in every area. I have to give Avery some respect for making this so drinkable for how big this beer is. It is also pretty amazing just how much pumpkin and spice cuts through the booze and rum. Artfully done and like nothing else on the market. The taste is a bit muddled and maybe a bit overly sweet but with that being said I would not hesitate to pick another up for a special occasion like Thanksgiving dinner! Sit down strap in and let rumpkin take you on the outer bounds of what beer is!"
"Deep copper to brown in color. I see definite evidence of alcohol from rum barrel aging in the cloudiness of this beer. The head was minimal and quickly vanished after the pour. The aroma is of dark rum and perhaps dark malt with a bit of caramel. The mouthfeel is thick,chewy,and warm with alcohol. I get dark rum on the front of the palate. I get some sweetness and body from the pumpkin. I also get some definite warming in my throat from the alcohol. While you can tell there is abundant alcohol,I would not have guessed what I see listed on the bottle!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: In the same vein as a lot of the bigger BA Avery beers, although I think this works better in terms of restraining the booziness and sugar compared to, say, Uncle Jacob’s Stout or the shelf beers."

"Poured from 12 oz. bottle at Common Table. Much more rum beer than pumpkin beer in smell and especially taste. Smooth mouthfeel for such high alcohol content. Sweetness masked any alcohol burn for me - however the sweetness grew to a nearly intolerable level before the bottle was halfway finished. Glad to have tried this one, but far, far too sweet to order again."
""
"Overall: Really an interesting beer. Lots of oak and rum lead the way, but the mild pumpkin and spices shine brilliantly in the background. The body is sticky and similar to a liqueur, but is much easier drinking than one. Sweet and delicious - this is a wonderful sipper for autumn."
""
""
""
""
"o - really interesting take on a pumpkin and i really enjoyed it. i think it could have used another year or so of aging as it was still a little hot but still a pleasant heat."

"Just doesn't do it for me. It's super alcoholic, and more rum beer than pumpkin beer for sure. I'm buzzed just from my share of this 12 oz. bottle. Yikes, this is potent. Not a whole lot of positive flavors, and a serious alcohol burn. Not one I'd drink again, and I struggled to finish off the bottle with my friend (who said it seemed more appropriate for drinking down by the railroad tracks)."

"Overall this was great. Lots of complexity, big abv and very tasty. Can't wait to see what some aging does."
"O - This is definitely a sipper that I could see a good after dinner drink. It manages to have some nice rum presence without being too boozy. Nice to have on a cool fall night"
""
""
"Overall a pleasant surprise. I was expecting a boozy mess, but the rum really complements the pumpkin aspect of the beer. The rum obviously makes the beer very sweet. The best way I can describe the beer is that it's like a Firestone Walker Double DBA on steroids."
"Mouthfeel/Overall: The body on this beer is quite big as you would expect, and all of that carbonation does not show quite as much on the palate, oddly enough. A bit on the syrupy side. Extreme alcohol burn on the back end. Overall, this is a beer I was very excited to get ahold of and try. It certainly lived up to expectations on a number of levels. Very flavorful and a good fall beer. In the end though, the ABV for this style is just too high for me, making this a quintessential sipper and a bit hard to get through. Half of this 12oz bottle would have been sufficient for me. Definitely worth a try though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Glad to have tried this extreme beer. Avery seems to push the envelope more than most. Good times."
"Wickedly big - rum barrel, pumpkin pie, molasses, brown sugar, cinnamon, ginger, dense pumpkin bread. Really good - would be a task to take down 12oz, but a task I would welcome. Definitely on the sweet end, with a tingling rum finish. Perfect for 11am on a Friday :)"
"Good beer for a cool fall evening. Not sure it's worth the price or one I could drink often but definitely glad to try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The body is rather light than I prefer as well for a pumpkin ale, but I suppose the body's gotta be as is due to the high ABV. Doesn't come close to Almanac's, but still a great pumpkin ale to enjoy during the cold fall and winter months."

""

"O - an great beer. Unique and flavorful. It drinks very easily. I genuinely did not know its strength. Definitely in the dessert beer category but it has been quite pleasure to taste this beer."
""
"Both years are great beers and enjoyable. I liked the earthiness of the fresher bottle and I feel it gave it better balance. I wish I could combine the flavor of the 2012 with the lack of booziness of the 2011."
""
""
"Great job by Avery in commiting to a flavor profile and nailing it. A nice treat in small doses. I'm glad that I split the bottle though, as a little goes a long way. I would happily drink it again though because this is a tasty beastly take on a seasonal classic."

"Just watched I Heart Huckabees. Epic movie yet so humble in its honest and easy truth. Easy truth about the complexities of life. Any fart, this beer started out huge. Big pumpkin aroma and flavor. Some molasses. Spicy alcohol. Little hop profile. Then it immediately became a Dogfish 120. Not quite a Mephistopheles but almost a Samael. Dusty profile. Huge alcohol taste. One dimensional. Just heavy booze. Then it hit me. The complexities in this brew are buried beneath the dominate alcohol. So subtle but very real. Just like I Heart Huckabees, this beer is real life. Great at first, redundant inbetween, and a real eye opener in the end. Oh and it is crimson in color. Just like the other rum beer I've had in this series (The Black Tot) I think it's waaayyyy too boozy. Go fudge yourself Avery. Fudge away..."
""
""
""
"This is definitely a sipper. Take your time with this beer. You're not going anywhere any time soon when you're drinking this beer. This is one of my more unique beers that I've had lately. Is it worth a shot? Oh yeah! Even if you're not a fan of pumpkin ales. It's still worth a shot. "
""

""

"O - The strong alcohol presence forced me to score this lower on the taste scale which is unfortunate because the beer is wonderfully complex. The first few sips left my throat with a """fire in the hole", too medicinal and needs to be aged to mellow out as would any young high alcohol beer like this. (IMO) 'Good thing I have (5) of these left to cellar experiment with. Looking forward to trying another in 6-12 months to see how it's progressing."
""
""
""
""
""
"D - Very drinkable. The almost 16% abv is well hidden and the overall balance is fantastic."

"O-  Rumpkin is definitely a unique beer in the pumpkin category.  For what it is (an ultra boozy, spiced, very sweet pumpkin beer), it definitely is well done in my opinion but is not for everyone.  I definitely suggest lying some down for a year or two, the spices/sweetness will dull down a bit and if anything it will become a bit smoother.  Overall I enjoyed this beer although I wish I split it with someone and at a $15 price tag it isn't something I would buy much of."
""
""
""
"O: Huge improvement. I actually wish I had another bottle to hold onto for a few year. My guess is this will only continue to get better. I absolutely recommend you age this over drinking it fresh. Having had it fresh on tap and in the bottle, this is much better. 4.5"
""
"O - I really wanted to like this one, but alas I'm just left perplexed. Sticking a pumpkin ale in a rum barrel sounds like an amazing idea. Somewhere along the line Avery decided to make the beer an 18% abv monster. Big boozy beers rarely bother me, but this one is just a bit too harsh and simple."
"Really rich mouthfeel, full bodied with a light to medium carbonation. The alcohol hotness is really pleasant, and the barrel aged taste is great. I wish there were more of a rum flavor, but it could be that it's just blended into the mix. Great beer!"
"Mouthfeel is good. Certainly full bodied and a slight weak carbonation level. For such a high alcohol beer, it's actually not too hot, I'm sure rum has something to do with it instead of the normal bourbon or whiskey barrel beers. The balance is good, starts really sweet and a nice warm finish. It's drinkable but certainly a nice sipper. Good night cap beer on a cool evening. Well done Avery, another solid brew."
"O- the rum aging works very well with the pumpkin beer. I think another year on this beer and the booze will fade more and will drink very well."
"In all a very good winter slow sipper."
""
"Overall - I doubt I'm going to be able to finish this. I figured I could handle the 12 oz. bottle, but this is intense. Not really worth the flavors it provides."
"I scooped up one these by chance as my local beer store was not suppose to get any of these... Glad they did though! Poured into a snifter, stuck my nose into it, and was punched in the face with rum notes, nutmeg, and pumpkin. Pours with a slight head and quickly disipates to a clear, dark redish/orange color brew. Very smooth and sweet and the first sip left behind a nice burn in my chest almost as if I took a shot of whiskey. The most overwhelming notes on the palate to me is the rum and molasses sweetness. This is a very refreshing change from the super bready big pumpkin beers on the market like the Pumpking from Southern Tier... Though no where near the ABV of this. Aside from this being a little to much on the sweet side, I wish I was able to get more and set aside until next year because I would love to see how this would do with a year or two of aging. Overall great beer, especially if you're a fan of extreme brews! Plus since only 418 cases of this were sold this year, you would be silly not to pick on up if you find it and have not tried it yet!"
"O: Rumpkin is as well crafted as any """extreme", high gravity brew out there. Very difficult to make 18% as palatable as Avery has. Brewdog should take some notes from these guys. Job well done.."
"Overall: If you see this, drink it. Period."
""
"Overall, this is stunning beer, and most certainly not your average pumpkin ale. The difference between this and the standard seasonal offering is kind of like the difference between a Toyota Camry and a fire-breathing, gas-guzzling, nitroused funny car. This does, of course, mean that anyone not already familiar with some of the more extreme possibilities of barrel aging should likely be very wary of this brew, and anyone who finds the alcohol kick of straight bourbon or rum should also stay away. But if you are a fan, and you’re ready to spend several hours nursing this sucker (because there’s no way you’re going to shoot this in ten minutes), it’s definitely an amazing offering."
""
""
"O: I didn’t like this beer as much as I thought I would. I love pumpkin beers, but the booziness is distracting to me. Not sure the process to sit this on rum barrels, but I’d be curious to know if there’s any way to cut the ABV a bit to optimize the flavour profile of this a bit more. It has potential at a lower ABV to be good (the autumn pumpkin spice notes are nice and well executed when not hidden), but again just too boozy."
""
""
"O: Splitting this one 3 ways was about right. The alcohol and thickness of this one makes it difficult to drink much of in a session. Despite the booziness and alcohol burn (What do you expect at 18%?) I really like this one and would buy it each year. Its almost like drinking something outside of the beer realm. If you like strong beer, rum, or any dessert-like beverage, than seek this one out despite the steep price tag. I'd like to set a few aside next chance I get, I'd love to have a 5 year old version of this one."
""
""
"O: this is a really good brew.... Rum barrel aging seems to really round out the spice of this abv monster, giving it a nice pumpkin pie like spicing without being overbearing.... I really enjoyed this.... Honestly I went in With a negative attitude, not being a fan of the style, the idea sounded gross to me, and I now have a favorite pumkin beer, glad I have this a try."
""
"The taste didn't quite live up to the aroma, probably because the alcohol is overwhelming the subtler elements. Have another bottle for the cellar so we'll see how this drinks in a year or two."
"An interesting beer and just about as big as it gets. Worth a try but probably only once."
""
""
""
""
"O/D-Is this my favorite Pump? Without question the answer is yessir. Transcends the boundary I thought a Pumpkin brew could reach. This is not just a great Pumpkin Ale, this is a great time. So happy to have had this. Rum and pumpkin, rum and pumpkin, RUM AND PUMPKIN!"
""
""
"Pours a burnt dark orange/bronze with absolutely zero head. Aroma has a ton of heat to it; dominated by the rum with some pumpkin and spices hiding underneath. Flavor too is dominated by the heat, it lets you know its 18% but the other flavors are more prevalent in the flavor, some pumpkin, spices, and a nice thick sugary vanilla.. Mouthfeel is nice, fuller with little activity. Overall, I was hoping for a little more from this than it delivered. Avery usually does an amazing job disguising the ABV in these beers but here all 18% definitely showed itself. I would have liked the pumpkin and spices to have been more assertive to help balance things out."
""
"WOW! Thanks to my friend Chris for shipping this one in for me from Colorado! The pumpkin beer of pumpkin beers! 18.1% alcohol is out of control, but you would not know the alky content is that high....beer is smooth and sweet. Pours a nice dark orange amber color, cloudy, not clear. Smell and taste is of sweet rum, caramel (sweet, sweet caramel!!!), and spices. Mouthfeel is super smooth, almost of an oily consistency, but nice bringing the flavors together. Overall, I think this si the best Pumpkin/fall seasonal beer that I have enjoyed this 2012 season! Very nice!!!"
""
"this has been way way up on my list for a long time, and i was fortunate enough to find this today. its from 2012, bottled on september 17th. it pours a seasonally perfect orange caramel color. it doesnt appear to have much carbonation to it, as there is basically no head after the big tan bubbles fade out. it smells sweet like molasses, and quite boozy, as it of course must at this strength. i smell some vanilla and sweet wood too, the rum conditioning is obvious in the nose. the flavor is beautiful, everything i hoped it would be. mellow and squashy at first, lots of pumpkin flavor and not too much spice at all. it says ginger on the bottle, and i can taste a hint of that in there, which is a nice twist in a pumpkin beer. all of a sudden though the alcohol sets in, and is overpowering, but it doesnt last that long before a swet nugmeg vanilla fall spice thing comes in and drags you through a long strong finish that has hints of apple and whiskey. so delicious. its incredible really. the rum component is perfect in a pumpkin beer, where sometimes i think its weird in other beers because of its sweetness. this works wonderfully. i also really dig the mouthfeel, despite its really low carbonation. the alcohol almost acts as a surrogate for the bubbles, keeping it quite light with lots of sting in the mouth. its vigorous in that way. the sugar content is high, but its okay. this is the perfect fall beer, definitely on to share, and definitely worth the price, whatever the hell i paid for this..."

"M: It's a big medium leading to full."
"Pumpkin beers aren't usually my thing, but this was an enjoyable over the top take on one. Would still prefer some other barrel aged things to this, but still very solid."
""
"Overall this beer was amazing. I've had it fresh and aging it for almost a year has transformed it into a completely different class. This beer is definitely the gold standard when it comes to Pumpkin/spiced beers, yet its uniquely different from any pumpkin beer I've had. Its a shame that there is no more of this beer available and no plans have been made to release it again. One thing is for certain though, if it does get released again, I will be hoarding a case for my collection."
""
""
"O. Very surprised. This is boozy and really too much for one person to comfortably enjoy. But it's like a pumpkin barleywine, a behemoth of a pumpkin beer that is very well made. Like a traditional pumpkin on steroids, Avery Rumpkin overcomes its shortcomings to, in the end, become a pretty good beer. (bonus points for using """come""" three times in the last sentence)"
""
""
"The beer pours a hazy orange color with no real head. The aroma has a lot of pumpkin pie spices in it, as well as some rum notes. I get some cinnamon and allspice most predominantly. The flavor is similar. I get some big pumpkin notes, as well as some cinnamon, allspice and cloves. There is also a good dose of oak and a ton of rum character. The beer is very boozy and fairly sweet. Medium to thick mouthfeel and medium carbonation."

"This beer hides the abv well and drinks fairly easy despite all the spices. Reminds me of new Hollands rum ichabod."

"Rumpkin will age with the best of them; can't wait to see how this develops in a few years."
""
"O - Overall this isnt a bad beer, it should be expected that this would be super boozy. Glad I have a few extra bottles to try and age to see if things mellow out."
""
""
"This is a medium to full bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. Despite being a huge brew, it is lively in the feel with the bubbles keeping this one from really dragging you down and destroying your palate too easily. The big presence of alcohol also helps to seemingly thin things out a bit by almost evaporating on the tongue. Overall I found this brew to be really good. I know it is met with big variance but I really enjoyed it and will be looking to secure more of this for drinking in October for years to come."
""
"O: Soo this is a good offering. Nice and complex but prolly should of split it with a friend to compare notes with. I dig it but wish it was a little drier and wish it i could taste more of the wood and rum"
"O: The tap version of this was so-so but this bottle is great stuff. I am sad I only have one more of these and definitely plan to get more during the next release."
""
""
""
""
"o - overall, a winner. i've had the pleasure of having this once before and it is just as amazing as i remembered. as far as pumpkin beers go, this one is at the top of the list. as far as barrel aged beers go, this one is at the top of the list. perpetual ISO."

"O: I planned on Rumpkin being my last beer of the night, but that wouldn't have been fair to myself or my palate. So I sent back what remained in the glass and ordered something that I could enjoy."
""
"Rich, the richest pumpkin I have had? I am overwhelmed by booze and rum, did I know and expect 16% abv? Medium brown, with cinnamon and nutmeg. Smooth mouthfeel, a tad above average. No lasting head. Spicy invigorating but yes high abv aroma. Damn I must eat to stay balanced after this amount of booze, but damn worth it."
""
""
""
"O: A wee hot after its gone down and sat a while but this is very enjoyable. Definitely one to split, sip, and savor."
"Overall this is an outstanding beer. I can see how it could be a bit too sweet for some, but it's a gustatory homerun for me. The second bottle was a bit overkill, but the first one was amazing."

"O - The sweetness of this one, mixed with the high ABV, made it a little tough to get through. DEFINITELY a sipper if I've ever encountered one. Really interesting idea, although I wonder if rum barrels were the best choice for a beer like this."
"O - Well, it's a nice take on a pumpkin ale, but a bit too boozy for me to enjoy more then 4-6oz. I couldn't finish the 12oz bottle by myself without fear of passing out, so I just gave the rest to my sink. That said, I would easily drink my first pour and did enjoy it. It's """different", but not near excellent or world-class. Give it a try and see for yourself!"
""
"Bottle: Poured a cloudy dark orangey color ale with a sizeable foamy head with OK retention and minimal lacing. Aroma of rums and cinnamon is quite intense with loads of sweet notes. Taste is a complex mix of cinnamon, light pumpkin and rums layered with a solid but extremely sweet malt backbone. Body is full with limited filtration and good carbonation. This is a complex one for sure though it was too sweet (a 12 ounces bottle can easily be shared) to drink repeatedly."
"The bottle has an interesting label and describes the beer adequately. It's easy to observe a thin layer of yeast sediment at the bottom of the bottle. An unexpectedly rich hazelnut brown pours from the bottle leaving almost no head. It smells like a caramel apple mixed with fall spices...intoxicating. There is something slightly vegetal smelling and almost none of the alcohol bite can be detected in the nose. The taste follows through with syrupy brown sugar and intense rum which is followed by an interesting contrast from the potent alcohol. This beer defines """Fall," but doesn't highlight the pumpkin. The mouthfeel is sweet and spicy with a medium-full body and ample carbonation. It's definitely a sipping beer. Overall this beer is too expensive and too hard to get. However, I'd be excited to have this beer once a year to celebrate the fall season and pumpkin harvest!"
"4.5 D: I like this beer a lot. I think pumpkin beers are a great thing, but sooo many breweries bitch out and make weak, tasteless base beers and throw pumpkin spices in. Avery gets all the credit in the world for bucking that trend."
"Pours a deep copper/brown color with good clarity. A small tan head fades and leaves some lacing. Smell is FULL of alcohol with lots of spices, pumpkins, grains, and caramel. Aroma is strong. Taste is decent. So much booze and pumpkin. Not much going on in the taste. Leaves a sticky coating on the tongue. Mouthfeel is pretty full. Overall this is a truly unique beer but just too much for my palate."
""
"D/O - Drinkability is surprisingly high. My prior experience with Avery's high alcohol beers (Mephistopheles) ended in a very alcoholic affair that was a challenge to get this. Rumpkin is almost completely different from that, however, as even though it is still a beer that is gently nursed and sipped, each taste is to be savored as even the smallest sip delivers a rush of flavor. I guess my only qualm is that I wouldn't exactly call this a pumpkin beer as it isn't the focal point of this beer at all. The alcohol is not as off-putting as I was preparing for, but I can easily feel it halfway through the glass. Thankfully this is only bottled in a 12oz format!"
"[88/100]"
""
""
"O - For a guy that hates pumpkin beers, this is mildly enjoyable. About halfway through the beer I discovered I was drinking a 15.9% beer. Other than a very slight heat i'm getting in my gums, the booze is hidden like a boss."
"This beer is very original, and a treat for anyone who doesn't mind the intense flavor and noticeable alcohol."
"Overall: Definitely a sipper, but a nice treatment for the pumpkin ale. The rum flavors add a nice depth that compliments the delicious fall spices. A bit too aggressive overall, but a year or two should make this interesting."
"Bottle poured into Founders CBS snifter. Pours a dull brown with no head whatsoever. Smell is wet wood with some hint of orange/red fruit. Mouthfeel is on the thicker side but no overly so. Taste is first tangy that gave me a twinge in my jaw (usually means sour/bitter), then a burst of brown sugar sweetness, and then the finish has as darkness to it that is musty that turns too sweet after about 3-5 seconds. Overall this is a decent beer but not sure if I will be buying it again. One thing of note is that there is absolutely no alcohol hint AT ALL, which is really weird. All this being said, I am usually not a huge fan of pumpkin beers, so the review might be slanted as such."
""
""
""
"Overall – Well, I am not going to lie. This beer impressed me, if nothing else, due to the fact it is almost 16% and the alcohol is insanely well hidden. There is some warming and just a hint of alcohol in the taste...but for how young this beer is, it is nothing unacceptable. Would I buy another? Probably not...but I will give props to Avery for this interesting take on a pumpkin beer."
""
"O: This was a very interesting beer. It had old ale and barleywine qualities to it. The pumpkin gets lost in the taste really and I would have like more of the nose to shine through in taste. If it had a touch more pumpkin I would have given this a much higher score. Not bad, very different."
"O: This beer just isn’t doing it for me. It’s seems like a barleywine or an old ale that is just starting to turn into a sour mess."
"I really dig the way the pumpkin and rum play off each other but I'm glad I was only drinking a 6oz pour of this. It's very boozy and thick. Proceed with caution."
""
""
"Beer is a little like syrup, very strong, very sweet, some pumpkin sneaks through but the rum wins on this one. As I suspected, if you like rum, you'd like this beer, if you don't like rum avoid this beer. I for one liked this beer but it gets a little cloying after a while. Probably couldn't drink a whole bottle alone but definitely worth the look."
"O - A kick to the mouth, a big bold beer. Super spiced and sweet, this should be consumed with warning and moderation."
"Never thought this one would be found on my local shelves, but, hey, I'm not gonna argue. It pours a sunset tawn' topped by a half-finger of cream-tan foam. The nose comprises spiced rum, extra brown sugar, light oak, vanilla bean, and caramel. A heavy spike of booze keeps full enjoyment at bay. The taste follows pretty closely, with the rum getting all up-close-and-personal with my tastebuds. The spices and vanilla bean are strong as well. There's pretty much no trace of any pumpkin, save the residual spices that get lost in the pre-existing spice forest in the rum. And, once again, the booze is more than present. The body is a stolid medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a thick, syrupy feel. Overall, this was too much of a rum bomb to be fully enjoyable. If you like spiced rum, you'll love this stuff. It's not bad enough to be considered bad, but nothing I would really feel comfortable calling truly good."
"The beer is sunburst orange with a thin, off white cap. The aroma yields booze, malt, spices. Good flavor, with rum emerging more so than in the aroma. Sweet, and best in small doses. Alcohol is there, but not a barrier to enjoyment, even in spite of the nearly 16% abv. Overall, very good. I would definitely have this again."
""
""
"D: This was really a great beer! Amazingly smooth and easy to drink. The scent and taste were really enjoyable, and the body was solid. The alcohol was noticeable but not bad, so it wasn't difficult to drink. I was surprised it wasn't more complex, but the flavors all blended really well together. This was like a holiday version of The Beast or Samael's, but better than either of those. A great sipping beer for autumn/winter that could also cellar a long time. One of my preferred pumpkin beers."
"Overall, this is is sweet, beastly, rich, and powerful. Great flavors and enjoyable complexity."
"It looked fine, but it smelled and tasted like someone poured a glass of rum and a punch of rotten, fermented pumpkin in my ale. I could not stand anymore than three sips, it was horrid and I had a terrible stomach ache all night. I am very disappointed with avery, I know that they didn't intend for this to happen and it was a mishap, but if a beer is that expensive I expect it to be done properly. I don't want this to be taken as a bashing of avery, I just wanted to log my experience of this beer and hopefully make people aware that there may have been a bad barrel or two."
""
""
""
"I wanted to like this beer but it is too boozy and too sweet. These aspects take over any subtle other flavors that might appear. Maybe with age this will settle some, but it's hard to imagine it getting much better with the sweetness as high as it is. I get the appeal, but a rare miss from Avery for me."

"O: Interesting and unique take on a pumpkin ale. I wish the pumpkin itself were stronger, I think that would really round this one out and make it amazing."
"I applaud Avery for their inventive brews. I happen to be fairly particular about my pumpkin ales and I was very curious when I came across this one in the local grocery store for a winter seasonal. First off, very little head and carbonation which really leaves the mouthfeel to the weight of the brew itself. Soft, and a little flat. A little heavy, and naturally so at 15%. It is a very interesting combination, I just felt like the ABV weighed it down. Aging in old rum barrels was a clever combo. I wonder if this might be better with a bourbon barrel. Nevertheless, the pumpkin was drowned out. I got a little bit, but I most tasted some spice and brewing sugar. Not a bad beer, imaginative pumpkin ale, probably best for when you are in an exploratory mood."
"Notes: Monster brew that I wonder if it will age graciously. For now worth the try but ultimately a bit much. Let´s see how the other bottle ages..."

"Dangerously drinkable beer. Good thing for 5.5 oz pours!"
"Rum and pumpkin. I did not know that they could be friends. This beer is as surprising as it is good. Boozy, heavy, sugary - it should be a mess, but it's actually tasty."
"Overall: This is probably the best pumpkin beer I have ever had but it is still a pumpkin beer so that is not saying much"
"D - Pretty happy with this one - except for the price."
""
"O - This is a really unqiue and tasty beer. Glad I was able to get my hands on a bottle."
""
"Pours a murky orange-brown with a 1/2 inch tan head that settles to a film on the top of the beer. Random dots of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, spices, pumpkin, rum, and wood. A very nice barrel aged aroma on this one. Taste is of malt, sugar and spice (cinnamon and the like), graham crackers, rum, and wood. The pumpkin is there but very subtle in my opinion. This beer has a nice level of carbonation with crisp and sticky mouthfeel. Overall, this is a great pumpkin beer that turned out extremely well with the rum barrel aging."
""
"For some reason it just doesn't all come together right. A touch too sweet for sure."
"O: This is one of the best pumpkin beers I have ever had. This is well put together and the flavors are very complex. Cant wait to see how it is after it ages."
""
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation being below average. Overall I didn't really care for it. It was cloyingly sweet with too much boozy rum showing through. The pumpkin beer flavors just seemed completely hidden and overshadowed to me. Not an enjoyable beer for me at all."
""
""
""
"Hands down my fave pumpkin ale. Big, strong, powerful. Had it at the Great Pumpkin Alefest at Elysian Brewery. Spice, Pumpkin, and Rum all in great balance throughout. I dare say this is a Pumpkin ale for Barley Wine fans(wich I am). Wish I could have got my hands on some bottles for my cellar."

"Very chewy and creamy low carbonation. Good sipper with a very complex flavor profile. I'm not sure I'd like another, but it is a very well crafted beer to be sipped and appreciated."
"Overall - Not a big pumpkin beer fan and i hate rum... but as i said this one is in a league of its own. Highly creative and delicious, these brewers knew what they were doing. Oh, and 15.90 abv? WHERE?!?!?"
""
"D - boozy but in the right ways. The only barrel aged pumpkin ale I have tried so far, and I would say rum was a solid choice as it played nicely with spicing. Recommended if you can get your hands on one!"
""
"Surprisingly light in color, a light murky brown with a very thin head. Smells of pumpkin and spices. Cake and pumpkin tastes are upfront with nutmeg and cinnamon lingering on the pallet, along with a boozy warming sensation (15.9% anyone??). The beer is a sipper for sure, feels real bubbly in the mouth."
""

""

"My first Rumpkin! Been looking forward to this big bastard for awhile. Poured from bottle into Brooklyn snifter. Pours a murky dark brown color, reminiscent of dirty drain water, except darker. No head whatsoever, but I expected that given the ABV. Smell- BOOZE! Rum, dark fruits like currants, trifle cake, brown sugar. The rum is unmistakable and overwhelming. Taste- WOW. a sweet blast of rum soaked cake to the front of the tongue. Brown sugar, candied dark fruit carries forward second. some nice bitterness evens out the sweet flavors on the back of the throat. This is boozy as hell, but it all works well together. What it does not remind me of at all is pumpkin. I really get more heavy rum, dark fruit, spices, and sweet candied sugar. Very enjoyable- I will be aging a bottle of this too, but I really like this fresh. A very drinkable 15.6% beer."
""
"O - This is a fantastic treat, would love to try it with some age on it to see how the flavors continue to meld and hopefully the booze will mellow a little, looks like I gotta fork out the dough for another bottle."
""

"o - Overall I thought this beer was pretty good, and it was better than I was expecting. The taste was a bit sweet and boozy, but I enjoyed the nose quite a bit. Would be interested to see how this is with a year on it; may throw a bottle in the cellar until next Thanksgiving."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drink- Very boozy and strong but well tamed. If you've had this beer that sentence makes sense. The pumpkin/rum combo was a smart choice for Avery to go with. One of the other barrel treatments and I fear this beer wouldn't have worked as well. I feel a year for this to sit and mellow would do wonders for it. Now I guess I have to try and find another bottle since Bevmo sold out....What a problem to have."
""
"Overall a very unique complex brew!"
""
"O - Yeah its really good for a pumpkin ale but it is full of booze. Really great smell and flavor, but I'd be suprised if someone could finish one of these by themselves. Great for sharing though, especially around the holidays!"
""
""
""

""
""
"I can see where they're trying to go, but to me, they didn't quite arrive. Poured with a small, cream colored head that quickly subsided and no lace. Color is a cloudy, honey amber. Aroma is malt, pumpkin, spice, dark ripe fruit, raisins. Flavor's like nose with sweet malt, pumpkin and rum flavors on top, followed by the carbonic tang, then the other thangs. Body is excellen but carbonation seems a bit light. Finish is like flavor, very long, and surprisingly not up front boozy; it's there, you know it's there, and then, Oh man! is it there!"
""
"Verdict: This is a strong sipping beer so I’m actually glad it comes in a 12 oz. bottle. The flavors are really balanced and the rum barrels really make this beer. Easily my new favorite pumpkin beer."
""
"I don't know that pumpkin beers are very good for aging but I have a hunch that this one is going to get better over 2-6 years."
"O-I do not know why but I kept sipping on this beer. It is not that great but for some reasonable enjoyable. Worth a try once. It is like old school barleywine with a pumpkin twist. Super weird beer."
""
""
""
"Fuller body, decent carbonation, sticky, chewy, and coating on the tongue. I was happy to try this, but I thought the rum was a little overboard and the sweetness was pretty strong."

"O: I was told by some other patrons to leave this """palate-wrecker""" toward the end. I was skeptical; how badly could this wreck a palate at a BARREL AGED BEER FEST? Turns out, quite badly. A very sweet beer."
"T: The pumpkin works unbelievably well with the sweetness of the rum. Some nice spice notes coupled with the alcohol make you feel like you're eating a warm piece of pumpkin pie. Definitely a sipper but delicious."
"Tremendous beer, very enjoyable. The flavors mesh very well, outstanding balance on the palate. Rumpkin is a bit of a sipper, though it is certainly a beer that you do not mind nursing for an evening. Big thanks to FosterJM for this excellent extra, very appreciative for the chance to try this beer."
"The bottle says this is from Batch No. 1. Pours a deep orange/copper color. Pretty clear and tons of tiny bubbles rising to generate a fizzy two finger head that quickly dissipated. Aroma is intense! Brown sugar, vanilla, and spice hit first, but there is a nice overall pumpkin presence. Smells like pumpkin pie. Alcohol is definitely noticeable on the nose, but not offensive. The taste is exactly like the smell. The first thing I noticed was insane amounts of carbonation on my tongue. Starts out syrupy sweet, but the spices come in to help balance it out. It finishes with a semi-dry fresh pumpkin taste. Mouthfeel is somewhat thick, but the carbonation is very high. Overall, the most unique and intense pumpkin ale I have had to date. If there were such thing as a Double/Imperial Pumpkin Ale, this would fit the bill. There are definitely some flaws to the beer. The carbonation is just too much. There is also a definite burn from the alcohol. I know 15.9% abv is high, but Avery could have masked the alcohol taste more. With that said, this is an epic beer and one that I would definitely try again. The rum barrels add a very nice touch. This will definitely benefit from aging."
"O: a decent beer, but much too sweet. I like the rum characters, but the pumpkin aspects are lost in the sweetness and alcohol."
"Overall, I dig this beer, one of the best rum barrel beers I;ve had. Would I buy another for $10? Probably not, but it is good."
"Taste & mouthfeel: Incredibly sweet, almost cloying; a ton of caramel and brown sugar along with a big pumpkin and spice character. Full, syrupy body with a good amount of carbonation. Mellow rum character, very mild oak presence. Warming going down, but thankfully not harshly boozy. Sweet, sugary finish; lingering spices."
"O- damn good beer."
"O: An interesting beer. At almost 16% ABV the ethanol is a player and the high final gravity defines the beer. Fun beer to drink, does remind me of Olde School Barleywine a bit, but with pumpkins."
"Pours a clear, light amber, with a very thin lacing. You get a lot of booze smelling it, but also a clearly distinct pumpkin aroma. That’s not always the case for a pumpkin ale. A real rummy sweetness around the edges. It’s a big beer, no doubt about it. But also very sweet and shippable. The effervescence helps keep it from feeling heavy on the palate. In a word: wow."
"2012 version - A lot more pumpkin in this than I remember from 2011. I think I like it better."
"Pretty good, but probably not one I'll seek out like I would Meph Addict or some other Avery brews."
"Overall: This beer is right up my alley. I'm a huge fan of breweries trying different and weird things. I would have another."
"This beer pours a dark mahogany copper color with some ruby hues. There was a tiny layer of off-white head that dissipated very quickly leaving some specs of lace behind on the glass. The nose is big and sweet. There are dark toasted malt, dark fruits, spiced rum, pumpkin, and holiday spices. There is a big booziness as well. The taste is deep dark and sweet. There are fruit flavors like raisin, fig, cherry, and plum. There is a hefty dose of pumpkin, cinnamon, and brown sugar. It is quite boozy, which is to be expected from a beer that is almost 14% alcohol. The whole flavor seems to linger on the palate in the finish. This is full bodied and has more carbonation than I thought it would have. There is some tingling and some roastiness. There is quite a bit of sweetness, and pretty big boozy warmth in the finish. This has really good drinkability. It is most definitely a slow sipper, but the flavor is great. I enjoyed every drop of this one. I really think the rum barrels were a good choice for this beer. I recommend trying this. I thought it was great."
"O – What a truly unique beer. Not the easiest drinker, but there is so much more here that becomes a side note. I liked not loved this brew, but do recommend any BA try it simply because it is so original. Not sure I can improve upon my prior… an unrefined sugar pumpkin spiced rum bomb reflection. 4"
"OVERALL: Honestly, pumpkin beers don't get better than this. If you get the chance, drink it."
"Nearly no head. This beer pours a beautiful, cloudy orange-brown color with a great alcohol scent. Pumpkin taste is evident but not so much as the rum flavor. Not a huge fan of rum to begin with but overall great job by Avery. Really different but absolutely delicious."
"overall - never had a pumpkin beer that compares...the closest would have to be st arnolds imp stout with pumpkin spices. which is a pumpkin stout? but anyways...this is great fresh but down the road?"
"O - Tastes like a shot of Captain Morgan's with a slight beer kick. Not the most impressive, but still a nice brew. This doesn't fit the style, but it's enjoyable. I will recommend this one, but I won't be buying any more."
"Many thanks to my friend Ken for sharing a bottle of this one late Sunday morning (a perfect time for this type of beer). Poured a clear dark orange amber with a small lingering amber head. On the nose, I got rum, pumpkin pie, cinnamon and cloves. On the palate, medium-bodied, very sweet, with lots of rum, dark brown sugar and molasses. Not a whole lot of pumpkin (or pumpkin pie) flavor going on, which is good; the rum barrels balance nicely against the pumpkin pie spicing, and although they stand out, they do so in a good way. The rum barrels work much better here than they did with Black Tot."
"Pours an amber/orange color. Very little carbonation or lacing on the glass. Somewhat transparent in appearance. A very small cocoa head that actually sticks around for awhile. Great looking beer. Wow. This is amazing- the nose is cinnamon, a tiny bit of pumpkin, nutmeg, rum, oak, and molasses. Really complex and fantastic smells coming from this beer! The taste really brings the spices out- though not overwhelmingly so. Rum definitely makes it's presence known too. The taste is almost port like. Very complex flavors- and the 15.9% ABV is fairly well hidden too. Feel is smooth, silky, and rich- with a little alcohol burn on the end- Fantastic! Overall, this is the best pumpkin beer I've had by a landslide- although you don't get a lot of pumpkin. It's great though, and I'm glad I got to try this brew. Highly Recommended."
"On tap at ChurchKey in DC. Poured into a snifter glass. Pours dark reddish brown with thin head and lacing that lasts throughout. Aromas full of toffee, caramel, cinnamon, clove, slight ginger, big notes of brown sugar, molasses, some nice spiced rum, nice sweet pumpkin notes on there as well, really big and full. Taste is just as good and the alcohol is pretty much completely hidden, starts with notes of sweet vanilla, brown sugar, toffee, and molasses, some nice cinnamon, clove, ginger, leading into a perfect blend of sweet pumpkin, rum, and a slight hint of warmth, balanced with a cinnamon, clove and ginger spice combo going into a nice dry, slightly bitter finish. Carbed well enough to carry the taste through the palate, nice full on the palate as well to have a nice lasting finish. What an interesting rum-infused pumpkin ale!"
"The Rumpkin is an intense experience. I've only had it at the tap room, however its taste is hard to forget. It has anything-but-subtle pumpkin and rum flavors, as well as a strong alcoholic smell. It's a very attractive dark orange with a thin head."
"orange tinted amber with a little bit of a haze to it and ample carbonation. A nice three finger head of white lace appeared on top and gradually faded down into just a film across the top. The aroma was very big, full of spices, lots of cinnamon and nutmeg were readily noticeable. The taste followed along the same line. A very spicy little ale with just the right amount of hotness to it. The cinnamon was particularly strong and had a great effect on the flavor. Very nice light body and ample carbonation made it go down very easily."
"The Farmhouse had this brew on tap last fall and after seeing it on their website I had to go try it. The beer poured out as a nice copperish orange color. The head didn't last very long and didn't leave a lacing. The smell of the beer was spicy and boozy. The taste of the beer had a semi-sweet at first, then the spices kick in and the alcohol warmth finishes off the taste. The flavor is very strong, and I really liked the rum barrel aging. The mouthfeel is on the heavier side but it's got a good carbonation to it. Overall this is a really good beer to sip on a cooler autumn night. Enjoyable!"
"Enjoyed this on tap tonight as part of a Colorado Beer Week special tapping at Falling Rock. Reviewed from notes and a 15 minute old memory. The beer is a rich copper color, with small bubbles but no head to speak of. Aromas of spice, specifically cinnamon and clove. Rich mid-palate vanilla, with a butterscotch finish and a sharp but pleasant alcohol bite. This is a sipper, and an excellent one. If they ever decide to bottle this (and I hope they do), it'd be my go to snow day beer."
"Pours a dark orange with a creamy head. Smells and tastes of pumpkin, rum and brown sugar, with a good amount of spices. The rum really enhances the pumpkin, this tastes like the best pumpkin pie or casserole you've ever had. Very sweet, with a nice mouthfeel and moderate carbonation. As a pumpkin beer fan I was really looking forward to this, and I wasn't disappointed. Avery needs to bottle this!"
"Rumpkin comes in the tulip looking hazyish orange that is semi bright up to light. A small cap of off white foam graces the top of this one, no stick. Smell is str8 rum barrel mixed in with pumpkin spices. Some small amounts of chocolate and some brown sugar. Some alcohol as well. For 13 percent or so pretty well tamed. Taste is pumpkin spice, not so much pumpkin pie flavor. Rum is well stated comes on strong and resembles a spirit in some fashion. Some small cocco, molasses, booze soaked apples and the like. The alcohol is well hidden but feel comes off like a spirit of sorts. Coating, medium bodied, a light carb. A interesting beer, not one i'll be reaching the ends of the earth for, small pours of this are encouraged, would love to have this near the holidays with family."
"sampled this at the bistro west coast barrel aged beer festival november 13, 2010"
"D - This one will warm you up fast. It is not very refreshing due to the high alcohol content. This would be a substitution for hard liquor in my opinion."
"Delicious"
"Wow. This beer is excellent. My friend that's drinking it with me says it's the best beer he's had in months and I don't want to disagree. I had a St Arnold DR 9 yesterday, but we all know which beer really deserves to be the imperial pumpkin."
"Notes - A pretty interesting beer. Very tasty. Not very complex but all the flavors and smells seem natural and not artificial. I might consider trying this one again. Even though its a bit pricey."
"Overall I am glad I tried this monster. The spices are not overdone and it all comes together well. I am pretty sturdy and this one has me whipped at the 4oz mark. A good one timer."
"I did not enjoy this. To much alcohol and nothing else really mixes well. I would not recommend this. I love Avery, but this is a big miss."
"The taste goes quite a ways downhill as the intricate rum characteristics are overlaid with all too much booze. Just really, really heavy on the alcohol here. There is some spicing there as well. The feel takes it even lower, as there is nothing there but booze. Pretty heavy body. Drinkability isn't all that high given the excessive booze. It's a shame that the booze took this one over. I wish this were in bottles so I could lay one down for a year to see what happens."
"Pours clear dark ruby color, not much head at pour. Aroma smells spicey, clovey, cinnamon, faint pumpkin. Alcohol seems to be a big factor in aroma as well. Alcohol from rum is definitely the biggest factor in flavor, especially when the beer is colder. Still clovey cinnamon spice in flavor but not very well in balance with rum. Pumpkin takes a while to find, becomes slightly more evident in flavor as beer warms. Mouthfeel is relatively thick. Finish has an mild alcohol burn. Sweetness is a little on the heavy side, and lingers on finish. Was hoping for a litte more pumpkn and for rum to be a little more balanced with the rest of the flavors. Glad I could say I got to try it though."
"D-- Taster was more than enough. Great nose but after that not much great about it. More like rum and very sweet I thought. Too syrupy and not a huge fan of rum. Had to try it though."
""""Rum barrels from Bermuda with real pumpkin in mash.""""
"It's booze, and more booze. It nearly burns going down. What the hell do you expect from Avery."
"Overall, at $10 for a 10oz serving I will pass from now on. However, I can't help but think that Avery is onto something with pairing pumpkin beers and rum barrels. If the base of this beer was anywhere close to that of Pumking, it would be an absolutely phenomenal beer."
"While I was able to finish this beer (a problem i've had with 12oz pours of Avery beers at Cheeky Monk before), I would again suggest that a 12oz pour of a 13.2% ABV beer is ... a tad much."
"I believe the alcohol content listed here is incorrect: listing last night was 13.2%, not 13.8%."
"Surprisingly, the beer's own sweetness develops its into layers upon layers of complexity and substitutes balance very well. Savory and succulent throughout."
"Overall, for 13% this is quite drinkable. Better for colder days/nights I think. Not sure what the pair this one with."
"D: This is one beer that is a little bit boozy, but it does not suffer from this characteristic. Amazing flavor and the nose is almost as good."
