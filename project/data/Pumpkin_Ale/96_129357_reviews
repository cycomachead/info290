"Pours clear medium amber, producing slightly over a finger of beige, mostly finely bubbled but shortlived head that leaves no lace. Aroma is sweet caramel & roasted malts, heavy pumpkin pie spices & some vegetable pumpkin. Like many pumpkin ales the spices are so heavy that the more subtle aromas are somewhat subdued. Taste is thinner than the nose & is a little watery for my taste but has more malt roast than sweet caramel; cinnamon, ginger & other pumpkin pie spices stand out with low pumpkin presence. All flavors are present throughout the sip & there is a definite hop spiciness in the finish that bleeds over as a light bitterness in the dry, cinnamon & ginger aftertaste. Light-medium bodied with low carbonation, thin on the tongue & dry with a spicy prickle."
"I have an almost irrational distaste for this brewery but this is a solid pumpkin beer. Not overly spiced, has an appealing sweetness with a dry finish, medium bodied, crisp carbonation, easy drinking. Nothing at all offensive here except perhaps the label (surprise surprise). You could do a lot worse in a pumpkin beer."
"Slightly hazy orange amber color. Spice and light sugary maltiness. Tick."

"Overall:  This is a good, solid, pumpkin beer.  Malty, and slightly sweet, mixed well with pumpkin and pumpkin pie-like spices.  Definitely worth a drink."

"Looked decent and didn't smell too bad, but completely lacked in taste and feel. Very weak and watery."
""
""

"What I liked: the color was great, the fall spices were not too strong, the crispness of the beer was great. What I didn't like: the smell/taste/mouthfeel was too watery. the taste was not strong enough. What I would change: make the beer have a little fuller of a body, and make the flavors stand out a bit more and be less watery."

"12oz bottle: This one pours a coppery amber color. It is crystal clear. There was just a touch of a light tan head that didnâ€™t last long or leave any lacing. Decent nose. Some pumpkin and pumpkin pie spices. The taste is pretty good. A fairly decent body, some pumpkin pie spices and pumpkin. Somewhat neutral on sweetness v. bitterness. A decent enough pumpkin beer."
""
"Mouthfeel is good and its a average pumpkin beer."
""
""
"better than expected, poured smooth with ~1""" head.  nice robust pumpkin flavors in this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall just a mess, as expected by Magic Hat, the epitome of screw the beer quality as long as we can make something fun and useless, campy mostly. This beer is pretty much undrinkable."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 7/08/2014. Pours slightly hazy reddish copper color with a 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of pumpkin, caramel, toasted bread, cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, ginger, and herbal/toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, pumpkin, and spice notes; with good strength. Taste of caramel, pumpkin, toasted bread, cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, ginger, and herbal/toasted earthiness. Light earthy spice bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of pumpkin, caramel, toasted bread, cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, and herbal earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice complexity and solid robustness of dark/bready malt, pumpkin, and spice flavors; with a great malt/spice balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and slightly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very good pumpkin ale. Good complexity, balance, and solid robustness of dark/bready malt, pumpkin, and spice flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"The after taste is slightly  and slightly pumpkin. Overall it is possible but i will not seek it out."

"Its grainy-sweet toastiness is mildly of roasting pecan, but the medium-bodied texture quivers and becomes thin, struggling to balance the strong spice additions in the end. Echoes of pie spices continue to wash the after-palate long after the finish."
"It was a fairly average pumpkin beer, a little bit better than I anticipated, not quite as good as I'd hoped"
""
"Overall: Well I was disappointed with this beer. I was expecting a nice pumpkin beer and it did not come through."
""

"A decent pumpkin ale. Definitely tasted the allspice and cloves."

"Overall:  I like to have a pumpkin beer or two this time of year and this is a decent addition to the style; nothing particularly notable, just a well-brewed beer; Magic Hat takes its hits around here (and often justifiably so); another brewer putting this beer out would likely get higher scores"
""

""
""
""
"O - Not a bad beer, but not a great pumpkin ale. Minimal pumpkin and spice flavors along with too much carbonation detract from what it is trying to be."
""
""
""
""
""
"pumpkin spices are mild, and overall this tastes watered down"
""
"solid pumpkin ale, not spectacular, but quite tasty."
""
"Good, clean and solid pumpkin beer. One of the better lighter styles with actual pumpkin flavor."
""
""
""
"Not very sweet."
""
"Awesome!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: a somewhat spicy but above average pumpkin beer."
""
""
"Very nice amber color with some head and no lacing.  Smells slightly of alcohol and strongly of pumpkin with a hint of spices, which is nice.  Taste is pleasant.  The flavor of pumpkin shines, but the other spices--maybe almost like cinnamon or allspice--are a bit too much for me (though my wife likes it, so, whatever); it's still very good.  Mouthfeel is not bad, but a little weak and thinner than I care for.  Overall, this gets a good score.  Extra points for the fantastic name too!"

"O: A decent pumpkin ale, but nothing really different about it. Take or leave this one"

"O- not bad I have had much better...an average pumpkin beer"

"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a pretty amber color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, pumpkin, light spices. Taste is pumpkin, malts, cinnamon, easy drinking and refreshing, a bit mild on flavor. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a pretty good beer, but there are many better versions of this style."
""
""
""
""
""
" The taste begins with good malt flavor and light spice with a subtle cinnamon and vegetal pumpkin flavor with slight nuttiness and toasted malt with a light creamy bready yeast flavor in the finish. Overall this is a pretty decent pumpkin not outrageously spicy or malty but pretty smooth and drinkable without any noticeable flaws."
""
""
""
""
"Overall this one is quite drinkable.  Not my favorite Magic Hat offering but still very good. I highly recommend it."
""
""
""
"In pumpkin beers I pretty much look for a balance of spices and the rest of what is presented in the beer. This is more traditional but the balanced is nice and spices don't decimate the palate. Also, the actual pumpkin flavor is satisfying."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a deep orange clear color with ok head and lacing. Very light aroma of pumpkin spice. Taste is pretty decent, slightly watery, with flavors of pumpkin and pumpkin pie spice. Pretty mild beer, feels slick going down and well balanced. Was expecting a little more oomph from the Magic Hat guys."

"O: Not everything from Magic Hat is a winner in my book, but this is a very good pumpkin ale. Not the best I've ever had, but it's certainly worth picking up a few more bottles when I'm back at the store."
""
""
"Pours a dark clear amber with a small head that leaves a little bit of lacing on the surface.  Smell is dominated by pumpkin pie spice, mainly cloves.  Taste, likewise, is dominated by the pumpkin spice.  Good pumpkin beer flavor and not too sweet.  Medium bodied.  Overall a pretty typical pumpkin beer."
"I'm a huge fan of pumpkin beers and really love magic hat.  Sadly this one falls short of pleasing my pallet for everything Fall. The first thing I notice was that the head dissolved into nothing very quickly upon pouring it into a frozen mug. The beer was room temperature the time and maybe that had something to do with it.   The aroma is fain but I pick up hints of cinnamon and nutmeg.  Dark amber in color it is very drinkable and definitely """poundable"""  as another reviewer stated.  Poundable only because the taste is unremarkable. I'm getting a slightly bitter finish to a watered down consistency.   Won't be buying again."
""
"it was so bad i wonder if the keg or lines were bad...."
""
"Not too intrusive and delivers on the pumpkin."
""
""
""
""
""

""
"I'm really not too much of a pumpkin beer guy. I like them to be a little on the drier side and this one was not very dry. Malty and pumpkiny with some cinnamon and cloves, but generally unimpressed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- if the taste followed the aroma, we would have a winner. Unfortunately it's quite bland with nothing really meshing"
""
""
""
""
""
"Good overall beer. When you think of a pumpkin beer, this tastes like what you're thinking. it has a little hit of a whipped cream flavour as well. body is medium. I liked this beer so much I bought a growler full of it when I was the the Magic Hat brewery :)"
""
""
"Very good. A pounder"
""
""
"T: Getting lot of chocolate, rum like flavors. Slightly bitter gourd. Smooth vanilla and cinnamon among other pie spices on the follow through. The every slightest of toasted feel on some strong caramel malts with some woodiness."
"Serving type: bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
"It's entirely drinkable and enjoyable, but could use more body. The chocolate on the nose is nowhere on the palate and that's a bummer. 3.5"

"Aroma is full of pumpkin spice notes. The pour is a deep copper body with extra generous white foamy head.thehead is long lasting followed by a nice lacing of the glass all the way down. The taste is a sweet mellow pumpkin, slightly bready. Highly satisfying!"

"Deep copper hue thin cream colored head forms and leaves behind speckled lacing.  Aroma a bit of pumpkin flesh, and cinnamon, allspice, and nutmeg.  Flavor has earthy spice notes, pumpkin fruit, caramelized malts to combine a decent mix of flavors even if it's a bit too spice heavy for me.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied even flowing carbonation, lingering spices add a perfume like dryness that doesn't settle well with me.  Overall middle of the road for the style, I'm tired of pumpkin ale and it's mid September."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: 3.5"
"Overall â€“ A moderate pumpkin, with a decent roastiness, but with a feel, body and intensity in flavor that are a bit lacking.  Overall, just OK."

"Wilhelm Scream Pumpkin Ale Brewed by Magic Hat Brewing Company with an ABV of 5.4% This brew pours out a nice dark amber color with a nice white head.  The look is almost brown but not quite. The smell is sweet with pumpkin and some grains. Nothing bad about this brew so far.  Now for the taste it is rich with flavor. This  brew has a bold flavor of pumpkin and spices.  The mouthfeel is nice and crisp  There is nothing over powering in this brew.  Wilhelm Scream has a nice balance to it. Magic hat did a nice job with this one. I would but this brew again.  Overall I'm giving this brew a 4 out of 5."

"Overall, this beer is the absolute epitome of all pumpkin ales. Spices galore, easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A little tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a decent Pumpkin beer to drink for a while if youâ€™re in the mood for the style."
""
"Final Thoughts: Iâ€™ve reviewed enough pumpkin beers to be able to size one up pretty quickly. Unfortunately, Wilhelm Scream is a pretty lackluster pumpkin ale. Too heavy on the spice without enough attention paid to the actual pumpkin pulp, which should be the star but gets overshadowed by the spices. Smelled much better than it tasted. Would I drink it again? No. (3.00)"
"It doesn't taste fake like a lot of pumpkin ales I've had, with a heavy hand on the cinnamon.  I'd be happier with a bit more body, or less carbonation, but overall one of the better pumpkin beers I've tried.  Denver doesn't have a pumpkin beer tradition, so maybe I'm just approaching the style with a fresh palate.  Either way, I enjoyed this bottle."

"Overall, this is solid, but could use more malt sweetness."
""
"Orangey caramel colored with a low head that dissolves quickly to nothing.  Aroma of faint malt and pumpkin spice.  Flavors of bready malt, some low squashy vegetal flavors, not offputting, followed by nutmeg notes, and some subtle cinnamon.  Nutmeg rises up frequently, and emerges again in the finish.  Notes of vanilla linger, punctuated with a slight peppery bite.  Would like a bit more cinnamon and a bit less nutmeg, but overall a decent pumpkin beer."

"Strong pumpkin spice flavor, very deep amber color good head at first pour, poor retention and no lacing.  Strong spice aroma love nutmeg cinnamon, allspice.  Great pumpkin beer!"
""
"Serving type: bottle"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"But the taste much more bland than the aroma suggests.  Some pumpkin in there maybe. Odd bitterness at the finish. I have had better.  I cannot help but to wonder if Magic Hat was drawn kicking and """screaming""" into brewing a pumpkin brew."
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a very decent pumpkin ale for those who do not like massive spice or hardcore vegital bitterness. Worth trying!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours out a dark amber with a thinnish head.  Smells of light spice and toasty malts.  Tastes like an average amber ale with spices and maybe a touch of pumpkin?  Finishes sweet.  Mouthfeel is a bit slick and dull in carbonation.  This is OK, but not one of the better ones."
""
""
""
""
""
"Leaves behind a definite ale flavor while satisfying with allspice, pumpkin, and cinnamon. Attababe Magic Hat."

"Liked this one. Have been pretty underwhelmed by pumpkin beers this year, but this was a pleasant surprise. Appearance was dark hazel with a light head that fizzed quickly. The smell was full of pumpkins and the classic spices. However when I tasted I found that it wasn't too sweet and the spices were subtle without being forgettable. I really liked this one."
""
"[Mouthfeel: 3.75] The medium body is creamy up front, bubbly with a bit of spritz on the tongue but without taking too much from the body.  Overall, it's fairly dry with some bitterness lingering."

"maybe not the most unique and compelling pumpkin beer here from magic hat, but a solid sixer of fall beer nevertheless. its got a rich autumnal copper color and definitely looks the part. the nose shows a lot more spice than pumpkin, but dont they all? spices seem well rounded, appropriately selected and dosed, and not so dominant as to limit drinkability. pumpkin flavor is minimal here, very little real squash character, but the pie spices bring me where i think the beer is meant to take me, and it seems fally enough for me. carbonation is a touch low, as is the body. i like a little more meat on my fall seasonals, and even though its still only august, i was left looking for a bit more substance. a league below the best examples of the style, but a serviceable brew just the same."
""
""
""
""
""
"I loved this beer and can't wait to have it as nature intended - in a glass rimmed with cinnamon and sugar. Welcome back, pumpkins!"
""
"Very good flavor. Not too bitter and not too much pumpkin or spice. A great balance of flavor and texture for the palate."

"O: Good fall beer for those looking for cinnamon and spice."

"I'm a sucker for pumpkin spice beers when fall starts to come around, and this is a good one, with lots of spiciness."

"O: A fairly solid new brew, drinkable enough and affordable...I have never been much of a Magic Hat fan, and this new pumpkin ale is not going to convert me either"
"But #9 still sucks."
