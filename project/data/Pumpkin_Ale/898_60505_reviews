"Very very good pumpkin beer. If you're a fan of these kinds of beer than plz at least do me the favor and try this one. I happened to come across a whole case of these in almost April and let's just say I'll b buying the whole thing. Anyone who likes weyerbacher pumpkin ale will love this it tastes similar but packs more of a punch."

"Hopefully my brother sends me another"
"Overall:  This is a remarkable beer!  I love the candied pumpkin and ginger flavor as well as the blended bourbon and vanilla flavors.  Very, very good!  I’m getting two bottle so this at least next year, one to drink right away, and one or two to age.  Delicious!"

"One of my favorite pumpkin imperial ales, you really get the flavor of both, and I have to say it's probably my favorite Heavy Seas brew."

"My god, I can't stand pumpkins and I love this one.  It has to be served at the correct temp, around 50 degrees or a little warmer to really bring out the the bourbon barrel aging, but does the aging ever pair with the pumpkin and spices.  Pumpkins are a style I can't generally abide, everyone has different tastes, but I enjoy bourbon barrel aged beers so when I saw this at the White Oak Tavern tonight, well I had to get a taste.  After a taste, I ordered a full 10 oz goblet and savored every drop."

"This brew is great stuff.  Everything I hoped it would be an more.  It has an excellent malty base built into the base beer and the bourbon barrel vanilla and slight oak play off the subtle pumpkin pie spices superbly.  Very Well Done!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"3.0 D:  Ehhh, it's nothing special.  The bourbon is too weak in the nose and too strong in the taste.  This needs a bigger malty backbone to do well in a barrel."
""
""

"Overall:  This beer could obviously get better with age.  Might have to buy several bottles to store on the pantry."

"hoppy afterbite. The best pumpkin beer Ive ever experienced and I am not a pumpkin fan at all. Excellent job on the aging of this ale"
"Wierd after taste"

"This is a big beer.  It doesn't feel like it, though.  I've had plenty beers in this ABV range that are not shy of warning of their potency.  This one is different.  Comes in syrupy, instantly coating your tongue, finishes extremely smooth and leaves no traces of hotness.  I've never experienced such from a 10%+ ABV adjunct beer before."

"Pours opaque amber in color with one finger of beige head.  Smells like the spices that go into pumpkin pie but pumpkin is faint.  Mouthfeel is good.  Taste is like a bite of fresh pumpkin pie with nice balance of spices and pumpkin.  Finish is sweet sugar and more pie flavor.  Overall, pleasantly surprised.  Can't wait to have the next bottle!"
""
"Pours a deep dark orange in color. Sweet smells of vanilla,  Brown sugar, nutmeg, rum soaked raisins. The taste followed the nose closely albeit more subdued. The sweetness wasn't cloying. The beer is made to stand out in this concoction; the spices are just an accent. The taste of oak is slightly present in the taste also. The sharpness and burn of the alcohol is reminiscent of a brandy or bourbon and effective at breaking up the sweetness in this beer. Medium bodied, not overly bubbly. This would be an excellent beer to bottle condition for 2 years. Overall; I prefer this beer over Pumking because it isn't as sweet/ overly spiced. Recommended for pumpkin/yam beer lovers."

"3.1/5: It would be a really good pumpkin ale if it weren't so flabby"
""
""

"Not bad but not great either.  Good seasonal pumpkin ale.  Little too light and lacking in pumpkin pie for my taste.  Smooth and that golden orange brown color on draft.  Little to no head.  Smooth and light in the mouth.  Finished clean. Just needs more of that pie taste."

"Was able to get my hands on a bottle of the 2014 before it was released, very good flavor, strong hints of pumpkin and fall spices"
""
""
""
"Velvety smooth and boozy, like some sort of creamy barleywine. Tastefully restrained spicing just lets a really well crafted strong ale shine through. The bourbon barrel isn't too strong either. Vanilla from the bourbon barrel complements the pumpkin pie spice really nicely. Certainly not your typical pumpkin ale and certainly more subtle and restrained than I was expecting from a beer this big in ABV. A surprisingly elegant ale."
""
""
""
"The perfect weather for a big pumpkin ale here in NC. today.Pours into an imperial nonic a deep burnt orange in fused copper with a sticky off white head that clings to the glass it settles pretty quickly.Big alcohol and pie spices in the nose,smells like an alcoholic doozy.And the aromas are correct,cinnamon and clove flavors with a big spiced rum-like sweetness with it's mild molasses,vanilla, and brown sugar notes.Whoo this isn't the """biggest""" pumpkin ale I have had but it tastes like it might be.I get more of a rum alcohol flavor than I do the bourbon barrel,hmm odd."
"Overall, this is definitely a beer I will enjoy again many times, but nothing, still, compares to Pumking. :)"
""
"Deep pumpkin spices like cinnamon and clove dominate the start of this beer. A good deal of dry oakiness comes out as it warms which leaves a bit of bitterness.  A good beer, but I have had better."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The alcohol is extremely well hidden in this beer - I expected it to be rather hot considering the ABV and the fact that it is aged in bourbon barrels but it turns out to be real sneaky in it's strength. Very enjoyable with a nice pumpkin and spice flavor without being cloyingly sweet."
""
""
"Overall this is one of the more complex pumpkin style beers I've had. More of a sipper than most pumpkin ales, for the lower ABV types are often very drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The best pumpkin beer out there, and it's an ass-kicker too.  Great spices and cloves in the taste, but you get a wonderful dose of malt and bourbon flavors as well.  Sip this, get warm from the alcohol, and enjoy a nice evening in the fall with this beer."

"I had the GABF 2013 Rum Barrel aged version and I loved it. Not usually a big fan of barrel aging, especially bourbon or whiskey (as this beer usually is) as the liquor usually takes over too much for my taste. Using the sweeter Rum, and already being a fan of pumpkin beer, it was the best thing I tasted at the festival. Been looking for a Rum aged beer for awhile and this was a great first impression of using Rum for a sweet sample of awesomeness."

"O- this was very good, most barrel aged pumpkin beers are overpowered by the barrel, this one was not. The base beer is very flavorful and mixed with the oak nicely to provide a dessert-like sweetness. Well done!"
"Very attractive pour. The differentiation between this and other pumpkin ales seems to be the ubiquitous bourbon barrel. No pumpkin tasted, only bourbon and clove. Rating based on trueness to style."
""
""
""
"Too boozy for its ABV... Nice flavor and the pumpkin is real nice... I just feel like I have had too many too many pumpkin ales that were far better~"
""
""
""
""
"O - a wonderful pumpkin ale. It Has the balance, the flavor, and the aroma any pumpkin head would enjoy yet provides the sort of class a bourbon barrel freak would appreciate. This was an interesting beer and very enjoyable. I was almost shocked at how good Heavy Seas did with this. By far the best beer I've had from them. Ill buy it again next year as well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Prost!"
""
""
"Overall its a pumpkin beer that exemplifies the style but I still feel that this one could push the envelope a little further. A bit more bourbon and pumpkin flavor."
"An excellent BA Pumpkin beer. I think this would also lend itself well to rum barrel aging."
""
"Overall: This is a good beer, and the bourbon offers a nice change of pace from the standard pumpkin beers out there. Ultimately it just needs more flavor (both pumpkin and bourbon)."
""
""
""
"This is a fine pumpkin ale. The only flaw is that the bourbon and oak characteristics seem to be absent, in my opinion. I personally don't think aging this beer will make it improve."
""
""
"M: Medium leading to full."
""
""
""
"This is one pumpkin ale that can be skipped over."

"Found this gem at a local co-op and had an open mind as I haven't seen this brewery's products around here. Amazing aroma of vanilla, pumpkin and nutmeg escapes the bottle and it pours a hazy red/amber. Half finger of white head that dissipates. Bourbon barrel aging apparent on tasting with warm boozy aftertaste enhancing the vanilla, pumpkin and balanced nutmeg. Overall my favorite of the 2013 pumpkin beer/ale/imperial ale class thus far...but I would like to do a side by side comparison with Good Gourd."
"A pretty decent imperial pumpkin ale and one that I will probably pick up again next year when it comes out."

"	Overall, the most enjoyable aspect of this beer was its aroma. This initially came across as quite booze and metallic, but as it warmed, those notes faded, allowing the beauty of the spice and the gourd to flourish. That said, the flavoring to follow lacked the punch that we’ve come to expect from these big, oaky pumpkin beers. The oak was actually great, and almost overly so because of how sour it was, but the pumpkin was rather flat. This is not to the fault of the brewer, but rather to the fault of the product itself, as it is inherently not very spicy or savory in its flavoring. There was, however, enough spice added to keep things interesting, and to meet the wood in full. This was a nice beer for sure, and we are glad to have had it fresh, while the bourbon barreling is in full season, but we suggest you wait a bit if you want a cooler, more buttery, and smooth-sipping beverage."

"O: The English malts are delicious on the rare occasions that they are allowed to peek through the iron curtain of spices. The barrel flavors are comforting and enticing as well. Tone back the spicing by half and this would be an excellent beer, but as it stands it's a bit much."
""
""
""
""
""
"Spice dominates the aroma, but seems to be subdued by the bourbon character in the flavor. Very nice take on the style. Not overly sweet, with a pretty decent pumpkin presence, though the balance is toward spices. The bourbon adds nice complexity. And that 10 percent is surprisingly well hidden. The banana and cola character I'm perceiving is somewhat disappointing, but I think it's just a combo of other flavors...namely ginger."

"Wow. Perhaps aged a bit too long in those bourbon barrels. I like a BBA brew, but this is just more boozy than I would like. Gonna give it some time to warm and see if it improves."

"A clear brandy copper color with a modest white ring of head and weak lacing. The aroma offers brandy as well. Vanilla oak and sweet marshmallow cherry. The flavor brings an instant idea of pumpkin brandy with some low lying malt and more cherry sweetness and vanilla oak. Very tasty in a medium bodied beer with reserved carbonation and a slick feel. Very solid and a bit different for a sweet seasonal with high octane. The booze is a bit high but it's worth it."
"Not really what I expected. I expected a thicked bodied, heavily spiced pumpkin ale that had some bourbon notes. This is almost the opposite. Its light, the main flavor is the bourbon and the pumpkin profile is subtle. It is a nice blend though; the spice works quite well with the bourbon."
""
"750ml poured into tulip glass. Amber color with a one finger head. Nose is malt and spice. Taste starts with malts and spices, mixes with oak and finishes with pumpkin and bourbon. Medium body lingers nicely, with a slight alcohol burn on the back end. Very enjoyable entry into the pumpkin beer world. Would definitely buy again."
""
"Overall a boozy malty experience. Not what I am looking for in a pumpkin."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I found that the beer became markedly better once it had warmed up. Nice vanilla and bourbon flavors and a good amount of pumpkin spices"
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Pours dark orange with a single finger off white head. Smell is full of pumpkin, cinnamon, oaky bourbon. Taste starts with lots of pumpkin, cinnamon again, sweet potato, some marshmallow, sweet, finishes with an oaky bourbon, not too hot, plenty of malt, slight hop presence. This is well balanced but neither of the flavors are intense enough IMO. I did really enjoy it though."
"O - Overall, we say it's an outstanding beer. The smell definitely brings out the pumpkin, but the taste doesn't continue that. Probably not a beer you could drink a lot of, and not just for the ABV (10%). But, definitely good for us to split another bottle at some point."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, interesting. This seems to serve bourbon drinkers well, as it really took the bourbon flavor but pumpkin beer fans may not find what they are looking for."
"O/D: Alcohol is hidden well, getting most of the taste, and not that much burn. Probably won't get again, but an interesting beer."
""
""
""
""
"A bourbon barrel pumpkin ale that poured dark like a stout and wasn't too syrupy. The head was less than 1""" and its mouthfeel was a mixture of pumpkin and bourbon. You could taste the variety of spices as well as the oak casked barrel that it sat in. At 9% ABV it didn't have a crazy bite and I would definitely recommend it to someone who is looking for a mix of pumpkin and bourbon."
""
""
"The secret is out! Imperial Pumpkin Ales is what beer enthusiasts crave. Its as sultry, savory and seductive as any taste in the beer world. Heavy Seas takes advantage of the impressionable palates with a drier and spicier version of this clever and quirky seasonal beer."
""
"Murky orange pour with a thin off-white head. The nose is more whiskey than bourbon with a hint of booze. Faint pumpkin pie spices creep up in the background of the aroma. The flavor is a very nice blend of oak and vanilla with pumpkin pie and whipped cream. This is far from your average pumpkin ale. Very well done."

"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass; no bottle dating, but this should be a 2012 vintage. Slow gusher upon opening. Pours fairly cloudy orange amber color with a 1-2 finger foamy white head with solid retention, that reduces to a thin lacing cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big caramel, pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg, bourbon, brown sugar, toffee, vanilla, oak, pepper, clove, and pie crust. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of barrel, malt, and spice notes. Taste of caramel, pumpkin, brown sugar, bourbon, cinnamon, nutmeg, toffee, oak, vanilla, pepper, clove, and pie crust. Lingering notes of caramel, pumpkin, brown sugar, bourbon, toffee, cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, oak, and pie crust on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance of barrel/malt/spice flavors with some great complexity; and no cloying sweetness present after the finish. Barrel notes are a little strong, but it is still very well balanced. Light-medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy and slick mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is fairly well hidden with a decent amount of warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice barrel aged pumpkin ale. Good balance and very nice complexity of barrel/malt/spice flavors; and fairly smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering."
""
""
"Medium bodied with a nice barrel presence that's decently integrated into the pumpkin and spice flavors.  Dry oak, vanilla and subtle bourbon sweetness followed by pumpkin purée, nutmeg, vanilla, allspice, clove and ginger.  Nice warmth in finish but the ABV is well hidden."
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer has a nice amber color that I expect from a pumpkin beer. I could smell pumpkin pie. If there is supposed to be any other smells in there, I'm not one to ask since my sense of smell is weak. The head disspated a little quickly. The taste is a blend of pumpkin and bourbon. I think the two go well together. I picked up a little vanilla in there too. The beer is a little creamier than the usual pumpkin beer, but it is a pleasant touch."
""
""
"Better luck next time around!"
""
"O: A tasty improvement over the solid The Great Pumpkin. It has more of a kick yet still retains its pumpkin ale qualities (with this version actually having a somewhat stronger pumpkin flavor). The alcohol kick makes you wonder how it might taste with some age, though it's quite good fresh. It has many of the qualities of The Great Pumpkin in taste, and it's definitely a pumpkin, but here it's taken up a notch . The """aged in bourbon barrels""" indicated on the bottle is definitely evident. Is it worth the several extra dollars in price over the original? Maybe not, but definitely worth trying both to experience the differences,"
""
"O: A little tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, good kick, decent representation of style, this is yet another beer that proves that “imperial” doesn’t always mean better."
""
""
""
"This beer poured out as a very nice looking orange color with a thin white head on top. The head fades mostly and leaves just a touch of lacing on the glass. The smell of the beer is very nice, it's got a near perfect balance of spicy pumpkin aromas mixed with the bourbon and vanilla on the nose. The taste is similar to the smell, lots of spice with a wonderful balance of vanilla and bourbon notes. The mouthfeel is creamy with a heavy body and a moderate carbonation to it. Overall I thought this beer was great, I would enjoy this one over and over during the fall season."
""
"Overall it's worth a try, but generally the pumpkin beer money could be better spent on a Southern Tier Pumking."
""
"One of my favorite fall seasonals, a creamy pumpkin ale that is pretty drinkable despite the heavy alcohol. Not as spicy as the Great Pumpkin. The bourbon flavor is very forward, and slightly over takes the spices, but leaves a nice pumpkin crust finish. Well worth a try if you like full, barrel aged ales."
""
""
""
""
"The flavor is really hot. It is over-whelming. You get a ton of alcohol in this. The pumpkin really comes out. I feel like this could get better with aging."
""
"This is a very tasty beer that's easy to drink for 9% abv."
""
""
""
""
"I do like my J.D., so when I saw this in Wegman's Collegeville PA I had to try it! It is a really lovely color, a coppery orange-brown, and fairly strong bourbon nose. The bourbon for me overpowered the overall taste a little, and also had a bit of the """hot""" quality. But as I said I do like my bourbon as well as my beer, and I like pumpkin too! I'd like to taste a little more pumpkin and maybe a little more spice (not more cloves though). That doesn't take away from the brilliant idea of pairing the taste of bourbon with pumpkin and spice, all in a beverage that can be enjoyed in more than one tiny sip at a time. Great job! I'm going back for more tomorrow."
""
""
""
"Overall: Really impressed. This beer gets less credit than it deserves."
"An interesting variation of the ever popular fall seasonal pumpkin brew. I haven't tried the base beer but I'm not sure it's quite enough to stand up to the bourbon barrel aging. The woodsy bourbon is nice but the pumpkin kind of gets lost in the mix. Still, a pretty good value as far as barrel aged imperials go and I don't regret the purchase."
""
"Thanks Chris for sharing this one!"
""
""
"Ov - Bourbon seems to weaken over time esp in open air. Do not wait longer than I did to drink it, After so long the beer will go totally flat. I was very lucky that i didnt wake up after I did. The beer was timed perfectly from absolute random luck. (~5-6 hours later) FYI the bottle was 2/3s poured into a pilsner glass. Very little surface area from the brew. The rest was still sitting in the bottle, I constantly poured the remaining amount to try to obtain a bit of foam before drinking."
"D- being a """big beer""" and considering my notions of pumpkin ale, this shit is off the chain. Barrel aging sells it to me but even without that I believe this would be a stellar spiced ale. I'm not kickin it here all cinnamon faced either. Nutmeg and brown sugar are up front, although the brown sugar could be elements of the vanilla flavors from the wood. Either way, it's a banger."
""
""
""
"Overall a very nice beer, better than most of the pumpkin beer out there in my opinion."
""
""
""
""
""
"OveralI, I chose to age this because I heard it was farily intense upon the release and it it still so after a year. The bourbon and spices are just overdone causing an intense flavor profile is just hard to really enjoy. I don't mind aging beers for more than a year but a pumpkin beer doesnt fit that MO for me"
""
""
""
""
""

"I enjoy pumpkin beers, but i like more spice then this one. This one was also probably better fresh when the bourbon was stronger."
""

""

"I thought a touch of bourbon would do good things to a pumpkin beer. And maybe it would. This beer throws so much bourbon into the equation that it is nearly incomprehensible. And this beer may or may not have made me need to vomit."
""
""
""
"Out of a bottle purchased at Hopheads this beer was a hazy orange color with a thin layer of white head. The retention was not very good but it did leave some streaks of lacing throughout the sample. The aroma was an appealing blend of pumpkin, spices, booze, caramel malt and hints of toasted nuts. The flavors were good and definitely put it amongst one of the best pumpkin beers I’ve had. It was doubtlessly boozy right from the beginning with notes of bourbon and vanilla but beyond that first wave was the pumpkin and spices one would expect followed by the subtle notes of caramel and butterscotch. I suspect this beer would age really well because I felt the strong booze notes were quashing some of the potential complexity. The mouthfeel was good, the body medium/full and the carbonation on-point. A “big” beer but a good one and exactly what I’d expect from Heavy Seas."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Well I'm getting down to the last few pumpkin beers to try this year, and the Heavy Seas """The Great'er Pumpkin""" has really set the bar high. I think tomorrow night might be the time for the Pumking, and we'll see if it holds it's own again this year."
""
"Bottle shared at the December iteration of the Santa Cruz tasting series. Dark orange color. Peppermint and cinnamon aroma, very wintery, pumpkin pie plus spices. Smooth pumpkin sweetness, big spice notes, too much nutmeg/cinnamon. Didn’t get any bourbon. Dial down the spices, dial up the squash and the booze."
"O: A pretty good pumpkin ale. While the bourbon does tend to dominate the pumpkin flavors, it does not completely mask them."
""
""
"O – Outstanding flavor profile, but almost no pumpkin flavor."
"Overall: The bourbon comes off a little too strong. the sweetness compliments it well but the lack of spices in the flavour make it a little imbalanced. A very noteworthy attempt."
""
"Overall not bad, it has some decent bourbon and buttery oak, decent pumpkin that adds a nice flavor not canned flavor, spices are kept in check, drinkable, light bitterness, a bit too sticky and sweet esp on the finish. Nothing special but tasty and done well."
""
"Overall: They didn't bourbon barrel age this. I think they pumpkin aged some bourbon. Seriously off balance and almost undrinkable. If I wanted to drink a glass of bourbon, I'd do it."
"o - overall, who would've guessed it...barrel aged pumpkin!?! and it works!!! overall it is good, but the alc is just intense and i never say that. enjoyable none-the-less and a must try for the fans of the pumpkins."

"Poured from a bomber into a true pint, the beer is a light, bright, yellow-copper coloring with a slim film covering of white froth. Light pumpkin sweet aromas, with only a slight spicing, and some stronger bourbon and woody overtones. Flavors are boozey right off the bat, with strong oak and bourbon highlights on the slick pumpkin flavors. The spicing is slight on the tail end, and ends up slightly overpowered by the other flavor profiles. The aftertaste is pumpkin and bourbon, which blends nicely. The finish is clean and quick, after the smooth, round body throughout drinking. I was surprised how different this brew is from the Great Pumpkin Heavy Seas offers. Tasty."
""
""
"O: Interesting take on a pumpkin beer, never had a bourbon barrel one. Definitely adds a decent bit of complexity that complements the beer. Base beer isn't really all that hot unfortunately, needs more spices."
""
"O - heavy seas' greater pumpkin is a unique and great take on your traditional pumpkin ale. I'm all about aging pumpkin ales in bourbon barrels now!"
""
""
""
"Overall: Is this a complex beer? Maybe not... heck, it is all about the pumpkin and the bourbon! But I love it nonetheless. Drinkable, delicious, autumn-y, beautiful. And- different! Yeah. On cask, even better."
""
""
""

"A light cloudy orang amber with a sizable off white head. A bit of carbonation is seen as well as a good bit of lace along the sides of the glass. Smell is sweet malt and pumpkin with pie spices. A good healthy splash of bourbon but not overpowering. It flows into a mild alcohol sharpness. A nice pumpkin bread component as well. Taste is a bit different. Pumpkin pie is the main course but the bourbon underpins the whole thing giving a boozy holiday flavor to this one. The bourbon and pie spice meld into a beer equivalent of a rum fruitcake. I kinda wish I had waited till Thanksgiving to open this one. Nice malt backbone is backed up by firm earthy hops to close out the beer with a clean dry finish. Bourbon comes in to add some vanilla and oak. Feel is creamy and supple with enough thickness to take on dessert and coffee. A lovely beer of complexity and depth."
"O: Not the worst thing ever, better than a bunch of beers but the flavors are unbalanced and there’s way too much bourbon. Maybe not the best type of beer to age in bourbon barrels since the flavors don’t hold up."
"O - Nice flavor combination. I enjoyed this more than the base beer (which I also thought was pretty good)."
"Finally got my hands on a barrel-aged pumpkin beer this year...and now I've got a second one! Right on. This one pours a clear dark amber-tawny topped by a half-finger of off-cream-white foam. The nose comprises bourbon, vanilla, light cocoa, honey, cinnamon, clove, brown sugar, caramel, and a touch of ruby red grapefruit rind in the background. The taste brings in more of the same, with the bourbon, vanilla, cinnamon, and newcoming oak rocking the forefront of everything. More spices and a touch of toasted pumpkin seed back them up nicely. The body is a stolid medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta syrupy feel. Overall, this is what a barrel-aged pumpkin beer oughta tste light. It brings in the best of both worlds and combines them very nicely. There are times when the bourbon looks like it's getting to big for its britches, but then the rest of the components come in and deftly cut it. Good times."
"Big thanks goes out to my boy Lunch for sending me this one in a past trade! 2010 Vintage! Served from bottle into a Stone nonic. Poured orange with a minimal off-white head. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, pumpkin, wood, and sweet alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, cinnamon, brown sugar, wood, and sweet alcohol. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a fairly good brew. After having the base version right before this one, I was a little concerned on what I would think of this one. However, this one definitely improved quite a bit with the -bal treatment. The barrel added a nice bit of complexity that was lacking in the previous beer and made it much more enjoyable to drink. Definitely the better of the two without a doubt. Just ask nickd and he will tell you why."
"I gotta make a bourbon pumpkin pie sometime. The flavors meld nicely with the mild barrel influence and strong pumpkin ale flavor."
"Notes: I many need to revisit the Great after having had the Greater Pumpkin… This works pretty well. Now, it´s only the second barrel aged bourbon pumpkin ale I try, and both, but this one in particular, were quite surprising… I may need to pick up another one of these."
"This was nice and was much better than I thought a BA Imperial Pumpkin Ale would have turned out. Besides some misgivings with the nose, I really enjoyed the overall integration of the flavors here and I was extremely surprised at how much of a smooth sipper this ended up being in the end. A full bottle was a little too much for me in one sitting but this is a perfect one to split."
"One of the better pumpkin beers we have had, among a great 2011 crop. Bottle picked up in New york. Orange body, with bright tastes of orange, ginger, cinammon. Very fresh tasting although aged from last year. This ageing led to a balance and a dangerous smooth drinking. Bourbon added complexity without taking over or felling boozy."
"O- Wished I would have gotten more pumpkin in the flavor. If taste was like aroma, this would be impeccable! Not sure how she will do with this, as I feel the pumpkin flavors I want may settle even more. Decent, but many other options out there which taste better and my wallet enjoys more."
"Pours a murky honey orange with a 1 inch puffy tan head that fades to an oily film on the top of the beer. Small streaks and dots of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, pumpkin, spices, and some minor vanilla and wood aromas. A bit of a boozy smell comes out too but not necessarily a bourbon aroma. Taste is of malt, pumpkin, spices, vanilla, wood, and a bourbon flavor on the finish. This beer has a crisp mouthfeel with a good level of carbonation. Overall, this is a good pumpkin ale that is pretty much just as good as The Great Pumpkin just with added aromas and flavors."
"O - Fun dessert type beer, they did a nice job defining a """new""" style to me."
"O: Not terribly drinkable. It tasted really strange. It was balanced, but the aftertaste was just so weird. Certainly glad I tasted it, but I wouldn't get it again."
"D - a very nice pumpkin ale, all of the flavors seem to meld together nicely, including the bourbon. Nothing overpowers and makes this one very easy to drink. Not sure if this is due to a year of aging."
"Big beer, big bourbon as well, not a whole lot of pumpkin, pretty messy. Drain pour normally, but i wanted to get drunk."
"Overall- Liked it alot, much different than others, I like that there is a giant burst of pumpkin with mild spices rather than lots of spices and lil pumpkin. Very pleased with it. Cheers"
"O - Overall, I'm mixed on this beer. As a bourbon beer, its not too shabby. As a pumpkin beer though, it leaves somethign to be desired. Wish there was more pumpkin in here than bourbon, but its still not a bad brew."
"O- This is a solid pumpkin beer and the bourbon barrels really did add a nice extra kick. Perfect for the fall weather and would be a great drink for something like Thanksgiving dinner. Hopefully I will be picking up a few more bottles soon."
"O: Very interesting twist on an imperial pumpkin, leave it to Heavy Seas to make one feel even more jacked up with the additional bourbon-aging. Sit around the fire and sip in the 9% ABV Great'er Pumpkin with ease. Or in a sincere pumpkin patch."
"The time has come to rethink aging every beer we can get our hands on and throwing it into a bourbon barrel. It works with stouts and some barleywines can stand up to the strength of that liquor. Pumpkin ale sounded like a good idea to treat in this manner, but I don't think it really worked here. The original product was probably not bold enough and perhaps Weyerbacher might think about putting their Imperial Pumpkin Ale into bourbon barrels. It might do better sticking up for itself."
"O- A very good pumpkin offering. The first barrell aged pumpkin that I have had and was impressed."
"not my favorite pumpkin ale, not my favorite imperial pumpkin ale (fishermans imperial pumpkin stout!), not my favorite bourbon barrel aged beer (allagash curieux), but an enjoyable beer that I would drink again."
"Overall, this was one that I was wanting to try and am not disappointed in it at all. Different, but nice flavor to it. Not on the level of Pumking, but nothing else is either. A nice after dinner treat for me on a chilly October night."
"Good stuff here, although I can imagine that there will be a lot of folks who outright hate this. It's hot and minimally spiced, so as pumpkin ales go, it might be lacking the expected flavor profile for some. I dig it, though, and imagine it will cellar quite well."
"Malty aroma has firm notes of pumpkin and cinnamon and a bourbon overtone that comes from the barrels in which it was aged. It pours a slightly hazy dark orange amber with a pale orange-tan head that does not stick around for long and leaves minimal lacing. Flavor has a strong bourbon note that dominates the flavor but does not overwhelm it, allowing the malt, pumpkin and cinnamon notes along with the whisper of caramel to have their say. Thick, smooth texture is fairly tingly and has a strong nip thanks to the bourbon. A perfect beer to begin October!"
"Was looking forward to this and found the barrel aging made it a little tough to drink. One and done."
"Poured from a bomber that I picked up over at Bestway in G-boro. Light amber with a frothy white head, bit of cloudiness to it. Head sticks around with good lacing. Smells like some raw pumpkin guts, light vinegar or sourness, vanilla, and the traditional pumpkin pie spices. First sip reveals the 9% alcohol that was missing in the aroma. Fairly sweet with vanilla and caramel blending in with the pumpkin spices. Oak aging gives it a strange twang, sort of like sour wood, but it adds a new dimension to the brew. Raw pumpkin sneaks in again towards the end of the sip along with some booze and lingers. Mouthfeel is amazingly creamy with a moderate body to it. Nice carbonation going on. I enjoyed it, though some of the flavors seemed out of place and the alcohol seemed overwhelming. Nice pumpkin character to it."
"O: Overall, this tastes more like bourbon that anything else. Not necessarily a bad thing, just not really pumpkin-y at all."
"I thought I was done with boozy, overspiced pumpkin ales for the year but this one sucked me back in. Once again, bourbon was the source of bad decision making."
"I would enjoy this with brie, bread, and pecans. It would definitely jazz up some pan gravy made with turkey stock for a stellar open-faced hot turkey sandwich with a side of sweet mashed potatoes."
"Clipper City Brewing has crafted a beer that is amazing. It has some of the syrupy-sweetness of Pumking, and some of the crispness of Smashed Pumpkin - throw in the bourbon accents and you have a flavorful pumpkin ale. Heavy Seas rolls with a bangin' (newly upgraded (from 9.0))10.0 abv, and that's got to be hard to beat. Get one if you see it."
"Overall, this is going to be a hit or miss beer with most people. I think it's a must try, if you do happen to find a bottle or two of it around your area."
"Pours an expected hazy burnt orange color with a soapy, off white head and a whole sheet of lacing down the tulip snifter. Aroma of pumpkin, vanilla, spice, bourbon, and alcohol. In the taste, nice pumpkin pie goodness with alot of vanilla, I suspect some from adding vanilla bean and some due to the aging in the bourbon barrels. A small bourbon presence is felt and tasted, but mainly sweet vanilla pumpkin pie. Creamy, smooth, full bodied feel. Overall, a fantastic pumpkin ale, recommended."
" and a Sierra Nevada Tumbler before this and now I have to consider how many hours I've been drinking, what I ate and how much I weigh, because I'm feeling this brew in each breath I take and there is a noticeable pleasant buzz in the works. Fear not! I'm sitting in my home office just drinking and a typing...and staring at the pumpkin I just bought."
"Smells like nutmeg, cinnamon, some pumpkin and bourbon. Everything I expected, bourbon a little on the heavy side. First few taste I get pumpkin pie with nice spices and a bourbon burn at the end, but the more you drink it the more the bourbon takes over the overall taste of everything else. Mouthfeel is average, slight carbonation. A little sticky. Overall the bourbon overpowers everything else this beer has to fifer. Starts off great with all the smells and tastes you expected but gets killed by the bourbon. Don't get me wrong, I like bourbon-barrel aged stouts, the flavors in this just can't hold it's own. Next I will try the regular greater pumpkin to see how that is."
"O: The Greater Pumpkin by Heavy Seas is a must try with well balanced characteristics, although I would swear this beer is higher than 9%!"
"Overall: The aftertaste just killed this beer for me. It smells wonderful, but I found myself enjoying each sip a bit less than the last. Probably won't do this one again."
"Overall: Very tasty, smooth drinker. Well done."
"Overall, a wholly enjoyable beer (but it's like the Pumking's alcoholic cousin, that is difficult to tolerate in large portions)."
"Even if you don't like (or don't think you'll like) pumpkin beers, if you've ever enjoyed a bourbon-barrel aged imperial stout, you'll love this beer. I guarantee it."
"O: Very delicious. I love it. I'd definitely have another and recommend you go get one now."
"O: One of the best pumpkin ales I've encountered. Maybe the best. It's perhaps a little strong, but the booziness gives it a layered complexity that I think improves the overall effect. Recommended, if you can find one. I'll certainly keep my eyes peeled."
"Murky orange with little head and not much lacing on the glass. Smells very much like cinnamon, cloves and coriander. Taste is pretty spicey, fairly sweet/sugary with the bourbon chiming in but not overly so. It's pretty nice but not the pinnacle of pumpkin beers. Mouthfeel is about average (I guess) for the style. Glad I got to try it but it was just slightly too spicey for me."
"Poured a hazy auburn w/ good carbonation leading to a large head that dies slow (not much lace). The aroma is a mix of pumpkin (not overbearing), some caramel/sugary sweetness, cinnamon, spicy pepper, some bready dry malt and hints of bitter citric hop. First impression is real sweet and smooth, as a sweet pumpkin (along w/ sugar, caramel, and maybe vanilla) taste hovers over the spicy, alcoholic edge. This sweetness is thin, however, and there is a crisp, dry finish of spice and a touch of hops, plus a touch of that bourbon barrel (I think...might be power of suggestion). This finish amplifies the sweetness on the next sip so I couldn't put this beer down and overall I'd say it's nicely balanced, although some might find it too sweet."
"O: I would like to have tasted more malt backbone in this."
"Nice example of the style. It’s got a lot of interesting flavors inside — some working in harmony, some competing with one another. The finish could be a little less dry and the solvent alcohol could be taken out of the flavor, but it’s drinkable enough."
"O: great beer with a sub-par """findabillity""". It took me forever to find this damn beer and when it got to my nose I was a bit pissed. The nose could be better but the taste is amazing and the MF is good. I will continue to search this beer out when its released each year."
"This was a one time special for me."
"Its an easy drink, sweet but not cloying, and not overly spiced. The balance was done nicely, its just not my favoirte pumpkin beer."
"The mouthfeel is a little above medium bodied and carbonation is on the lower side. I like the lower carbonation for a barrel aged beer. Drinkability was pretty decent. The spices mixed with the barrel flavors better then I expected, but I can't say they complimented each other as well as other styles do. Pretty drinkable, really cool and unique, and a very enjoyable pumpkin beer overall."
"Notes: I can understand if this is a polarizing beer. Some will really embrace it and other will be repulsed. Actually I find that this is the case for any pumpkin beer. I came in skeptical but interested and I go out pleased with this beer."
"Dense, deep pumpkin-orange with a creamy eggshell head that leaves pretty lace on the glass. The aroma is pumpkin spice and bourbon barrel, toasted oak notes. A creamy, custard-like pumpkin pie and whiskey barrel quality..who wouldn't like that? A toasty, oaky whisky barrel version of a pumpkin beer. Good stuff. Full bodied,oaky and sticky."
"D: A friend had this on cask and said it was one of the best beers that he had ever had. This was a big let down for me. I think they might have a small issue on the bottling line. Their draft beers are always remarkably better. For a big barrel aged beer this is kind of bland."
"Worth drinking but I believe that there is better in the 8-9 dollar bomber range."
"Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"22oz. bottle served in my Darkness tulip. Pours a semi-hazy burnt-orange with a creamy, loose, one inch bright white head. Head gradually disperses into a creamy slick with some thin, but densely packed strands of lacing evident during the tasting. Nose expresses bourbon, a buttery quality, pumpkin spice aromas and a trace of citrus. Taste follows nose - pumpkin pie flavors dominate upfront; nutmeg, allspice, cinnamon, followed by bourbon flavors that nicely integrate with the other elements. Mouthfeel is light-medium (but closer to medium), with a lively carbonation, a slightly silky texture and some residual alcohol heat detectable at the finish. A very pleasant variation on the style and makes a great post-Thanksgiving digestif. That being said, 22oz. is perhaps a bit much. A 12oz. bottle split amongst two is more than satisfying."
"Good pumpkin beer, less bourbon than expected. A big beer that needs sharing as 22oz would be too much for one person."
"D: good sipper, flavors are balanced well, bourbon adds a nice touch."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: Smooth even slick full bodied beer low carbonated but works well with the beers character. No sign of the alcohol in the mouth. The more of this I drink the more I am digging the beer. The beer would be a sipper for a more restrained beer drinker. Nicely played!"
"D- A bit of a sipper, but very memorable and enjoyable. Worth seeking out for something different."
"Pumpkin spices and bourbon are two flavors that can be unpleasantly overpowering in a beer. Mixed together, the two manage to complement each other quite nicely. This beer is a little bit hot and boozy, especially as it warms."
"It won't be difficult for me to finish my glass of this imperial beer. I wouldn't want to have too many glasses of this in a session, simply because it is so strong. I would like to pick up a few bottles of this next fall to spread out across the season. It's a very enjoyable beverage. Who would have thought bourbon aging a pumpkin ale would work so well?"
"I'm not a fan of this style, but this is a wonderful pumpkin ale...without a doubt, the best I've had. It is very rich, so a 22oz bottle is plenty but I could see myself picking this up again next year, or even sitting on a few bottles."
"This is more evidence of what some time in the woods can do for improving character. This is a completely different creature from its Great pumpkin sibling. It pours cloudy orange and has a fair amount of head. The Bourbon is very evident in the first sip and combined with the pumpkin spices it has a flavor much like egg nog. The smell is very spicy still much like pumpkin pie. It has a bit more of an boozy feel then the great pumpkin, which I like. In my oppinion this is probably my favorite pumpkin beer (when I had the great pumpkin I was debating whether I liked it more or Dogfish's punkin ale) as of now this is the best."
"I was really curious about this one as I've never had or seen a bourbon barrel aged pumpkin beer so I really wanted to try it. Poured a very dark cloudy hazy orange with a somewhat small to medium sized white head. The head fairly quickly dissolved but somewhat stuck around till almost the end of the beer. Left hardly any lacing on the glass. The smell for me reminded me of a lot of bourbon barrel aged beers or at least had a familiar smell of that with the twist of a pumpkin ale. Had the bourbon, the vanilla from the oak, pumpkin and spices. The smell was very good. Taste was pretty much the same except I think the vanilla, bourbon, and the other taste from the barrel really stuck out with the pumpkin not totally in the background but still very upfront and well balanced. The pumpkin was there but not overpowering which I liked a lot. Went down really smooth, not very bitter at all actually kind of sweet. Mouthfeel was pretty average, nothing to rant or rave about. Drinkability was great. A mildly high ABV but very well hidden in my opinion. I could smell and taste the bourbon but it played no effect in making """hot""" or undrinkable. I could have easily done another after finishing this one. Overall not the greatest pumpkin ale I've ever had but I'd put it up there. I was skeptical about a bourbon barrel aged pumpkin ale but it turns out it was quite wonderful, the bourbon and the oak barrel add great flavors to this beer. If I ever see this one again I will pick it up without hesitation. Great beer and great pumpkin ale."
"After trying Avery's Rumpkin recently, I redoubled my efforts to acquire this beer, and, as luck would have it, I ended up with 5 of them. Fortunately, it is quite enjoyable. Pours a dark golden color, bordering on amber, with a good dirty white head on top. Aromas of bourbon initially, giving way to vanilla, cinnamon and a host of supporting pumpkin pie spices. On the palate, this one drinks way to easily for 9%, with a nice creamy mouthfeel, and flavors of brown sugar and sweet malt, buffered by autumn spicing and a lingering boozy finish. Very nice."
"The beer pours a pumpkin orange amber color with good head retention and lacing. The nose is impressive in this pumpkin ale, showcasing a boatload of clove, nutmeg, vanilla, cinnamon, all spice and brown sugar. The beer smells sweet and very spicy. The flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely in this fairly sweet beer, though there's also something of a buttery mouthfeel and considerable alcohol as well. While I realize this is meant to be an """imperial""" style ale, this beer comes across as an 11% or 12% abv. beer.... that's how boozy it is. Mouthfeel is soft, smooth and almost slick in this low carbonation presentation, and the beer has a farily long, spice infused finish. As seems to be typical in these mutiny fleet beers, drinkability is not this beer's strong suit. The combination of sweetness, spice and in your face alcohol made it impossible for me to finish even the 10 ounce glass I was served at Mahaffey's. While interesting, at least for me, this was ultimatley another mutiny fleet dud."
"22 ounce bottle. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours a cloudy orange/copper color with about an inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both decent. Aroma is sweet and spicy, it smells like pumpkins, spices (cinnamon, nutmeg), vanilla and bourbon. Taste is similar to the aroma, but with some alcohol/booze being noticable but not overpowering. The bourbon flavor is a bit stronger than the others, but the flavors all mesh well together. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit syrupy and has low carbonation. Drinkability is good, it improves as the beer warms up. I think it's a good overall brew, I'd buy this again."
"D: I could see this being great, but the bourbon and spices are just overdone at this point."
"Pours lighter than I expected, more a golden color than a brown- on the lighter side of amber. A fairly slight head, but that seems okay for the style and abv. Smells boozy and sweet, with some pumpkin pie spice notes. The bourbon is light and clean and style, rather than heavy and laced with oak and molasses. Tastes like a bourbon laced pumpkin pie- creamy, sweet, bourbony and with chocolate and some surprising lemon notes as well that add some nice acidity that cuts through the rest of the richness. Smooth and rich in the mouth, This is quite a nice variation on the standard pumpkin beer."
"A hazy lite golden brown beer with a nice head and some minimal lacing. The nose is full of hot bourbon with a little pumpkin and spices. The beer tastes like bourbon with pumpkin and spices, more nuanced and complex than the nose, heat is noticeable but it does not distract from the beer in a negative beer(I despise heat is most beers). The heat actually works here. A very smooth mouthfeel from the pumpkin, mild carbonation. Overall, this is one of my favorite pumpkin ales and it is a style I just don't appreciate. A decent beer that has some strong points and some weak points."
"Beer is light in body and quite hot. Its mildly spicy but the pumpkin some how cuts through and is still present. My wife enjoys this beer and this style more than I do but this is a decent beer. I wouldn't have expected much from a bourbon barrel aged fruit beer but this one comes through. Its a little harsh on the onset but overall its OK."
"Notes: fantastic pumpkin seasonal. they prove that bourbon barrel aging a pumpkin beer works extremely well. delicious."
"Poured this into a pint glass. The body is hazy orange with about a finger of off white head that looks thick and creamy. The body actually really looks like sweet apple cider. Maybe because it's Autumn. The head doesn't retain very well and leaves just a little spotty lacing. I can definitely smell the pumpkin in this one, a bit of oak and certainly the bourbon. The bourbon is actually a bit aggressive, it makes it a bit to intense. Ugh. Pumpkin and bourbon don't go well together at all. This reminds me of cough syrup. I can taste the pumpkin, bourbon and Autumn spices but the bourbon is too much. I remember having the regular version last year and it wasn't bad. But these flavors just don't go well together. The mouthfeel isn't bad. Not really good though because the feeling in my mouth is just the really bad taste of cough syrup. Not at all drinkable. I'm really pissed at Shane from Tully's for pointing this one out to me and convincing me I should try it. That's strike two Shane."
"Goes down all right, but it just doesn't leave me wanting more. The difference in the unwarmed state will probably cause me to not seek this out again, which is about par for the Mutiny Fleet series in general."
"D- Im going to buy more of this."
"The bourbon mellows the spices from the base beer pretty well and gives the impression of a well-balanced pumpkin beer. Not bad."
"D- I want to have 2-3 per night....i can afford 1-2 per month"
"D- it's hard to judge this beer because of the uniqueness; def nice to try but I can't really see myself going through a 6-pack if it were able in that packaging; it's not as pumpkin-pieish as other beers in the style, but more of a blend of flavors...if your looking for pumpkin pie dipped in bourbon your not going to find that intensity of flavor with this beer; definitely a nice version of the style but not my favorite"
"D- This stuff is just too delicious... and dangerously quaffable. Hands-down one of the best brews I've had from Heavy Seas!"
"Heavy Seas The Great'er Pumpkin is a cloudy orange/amber beer with an off white head that fades quickly and leaves nice lacing. There's lots of oak in the nose. That's pretty much the aroma: bourbon barrel. It's full bodied and bubbly. It leaves the tongue a little silty. Charred oak dominates the taste. There is possible nutmeg detected, but no pumpkin. This is a bourbon flavored beer. Fortunately, I like bourbon. This is some heavy stuff, though."
"The mouthfeel is OK, medium body and medium carbonation, with some lingering booze and spice. Overall, this was just not working for me, and I was very excited by the idea. The execution, however, was just not great, but an admirable attempt. I'd love if someone made a bourbon barrel aged pumpkin beer with lots of vanilla from the barrel, maybe a barrel aged imperial chocolate pumpkin stout. That's the ticket. Until that get's released, stick to the regular Great Pumpkin or pour a bit of Makers Mark into a Southern Tier Pumking (don't try that at home, I'm kidding)."
"Awesome beer, tremendously drinkable. Almost zero booziness which is surprising considering we are talking about a 9% -bal aged beer. This has become my favorite pumpkin ale and possibly my favorite holiday beer as well. In the past I have found Heavy Sea to be solid but not much more, this is the first offering that truly impresses me. Highly recommended."
"As far as the side by, to be honest, I couldn't pick up on any major differences. I think the Greater Pumpkin is a correct description, as I preferred it over the other, but again, no striking major differences."
"The beer pours a hazy orange color with a thick frothy off-white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great! It has a warm pumpkin and spice scent along with a nice bourban barrel aroma. The pumpkin and bourban character works well together. The taste is decent. It has a very aggressive bourbon flavor that goes down easy and finishes warm with good pumpkin character. The barrel aging dominates the palate and diminishes the overall pumpkin and spice taste. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is the first bourbon barrel aged pumpkin ale I've ever tried. It's unique and complex, but I prefer the regular version."
"Pumpkin and bourbon barrels, now here's something very different...and I like it!"
"MF is thick, chewy, coating. Maybe a hair more carbonation to keep it moving but that's about it. OK drinkability, but I can't get past the buttery character of these beers. Maybe it's me--I'm pretty sure it's not the bottles since this is the same flavor I've found in two of their BA beers."
"D- This is a very good, different pumpkin ale. The bourbon barrels add a different character-and certainly a big kick. This is clearly a strong pumkin ale that doesn't hide its booziness. Job well done by Clipper City here- one of my favorites from them."
"Poured a hazy orange with an unbelievable nose. If I could rate higher on the smell, I would. Pumpkin, peppermint, american oak come to mind. Taste was delish and mouthfeel was right on. Shared this with friends (poured 4 ways) and I wish I had the whole bottle to myself. I true jewel!"
"Notes: The bourbon barrel notes were a nice touch to base pumpkin beer. I liked the lighter balance of spice here in The Greater Pumpkin Ale vs. the regular The Great Pumpkin Ale."
"This is a style I just couldn't resist trying -- while it's got some flaws & I don't necessarily think the pumpkin is enough to support the bourbon barrel, it's enjoyable nonetheless. Definitely a sipper, & I can think of a handful of pumpkin ales I'd go to before this, but I'd be up for it again sometime for sure."
"D/M: Very thick and strong beer. Really should be enjoyed on a warm day with some strong food. Great carbonation and balance. I applaud the improvement with this version."
"This one packs a punch and is clearly meant to be drunk in small portions, though it's tasty enough to forget this and down the whole bomber."
"Pours a hazy orange to light copper color with an off white head. In the aroma, bourbon, oak, and pumpkin spices. In the taste, mellow bourbon, oaky, and mellow pumpkin spice. A smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry bourbon to a clean aftertaste. Light bourbon probably due to the spice contrast. Nice warming feeling."
"If you like Nemesis 2009 you'll like this."
"D - I don't think age will do much more with this beer since after a while the sediment starts to set in destroying the flavor. Was really hoping for more with this beer but has really opened my eyes for big ABV Pumpkin ales. Most of them (Smashed Pumpkin, Hopping Frog Double Pumpkin, and this) were total booze bombs. I will stick with my Screaming Jack from Michigan. PASS!"
"Decent beer but a pumpkin ale? The bourbon shows through nicely but like the bourbon barley wine it's not necassarily the best bourbon out there at least the way it's aged. Ahh some hints of cinnamon and nutmeg with a butternut squash finish and a bit of oxidation on the finish as well. Some toffee malt oak and vanilla in the middle but not much else. Good but not what I was hoping."
"drinkability is awful - 3/4 of this bottle went down the drain"
"Taste: this is where the beer gets lost to me. Just about all I taste is vanilla and oak. There is lingering spice in there, but it is way overshadowed by the oak and the whole beer gets steered off course. In other words, it totally flew over the seasonal runway. I could drink this in February and basically think of it as a strong ale brewed with spices and aged in oak. I then may have given it better scores because I wouldn't have been thinking """pumpkin, pumpkin, pumpkin""""
"D: This was better than the average pumpkin ale, but not amazing. The bourbon aging was a nice twist, and it seemed to work well with the other flavor elements. But the general quality and crispness of the brew was somewhat lacking. Nice body, and it hid the alcohol well, so it was pretty easy to drink. Enjoyable, but a bit sloppy, so there was some missed potential."
"D- High. I really like this beer, it won't be for everyone but I think the bourbon barrels work really well with the pumpkin ale base. I've bought a half-case of this already and will buy more if I see it. Good stuff."
"Overall I was very impressed with this beer and even more impressed that the bourbon was as subtle as it was. A very well done beer that's well worth a shot, especially as the weather cools."
"D - Pretty decent beer. Definitely a sipper. Warming alcohol notes makes me think this would be a good cold weather beer. Worth trying for a new experience."
"d - I actually liked this one more than The Great Pumpkin, though it isn't as much as a pumpkin beer. The spices and caramel malts that The Great Pumpkin had were kind of lost here due to the bourbon and oak, but a very enjoyable beer. Would have again."
"Just give it some time... in the cellar &/or simply w/ some air!"
"I opted to go ahead and pour this one instead of aging it. The curiosity got to me. It poured a cloudy, murky dark burnt orange with almost no head at all. You can smell it from a couple feet away. You can pick up the pumpkin, nutmeg and cinnamon. Up close you get little more than bourbon, oak, and vanilla. The taste isn't what I wanted it to be. It's subtly pumpkin while overly bourbon. I would've liked it the other way around. It drinks slightly """hot""" too because of the bourbon flavor paired with the 9% alcohol content. It has a medium to body and leaves the bourbon flavor on your palate. I like it, but it could've been better. I'll probably buy another one just to let it age for a couple years."
"D: This is a very interesting experiment, however, I don't believe that this is a style that works as a barrel-ages concoction. When I go shop for a pumpkin ale, I want just that...a pumpkin-flavored ale."
"D: OK drinkability. The alcohol and cloves started to get annoying halfway through."
"Pours a dark, dark brown with the slightest tan head. Smells slightly of bourbon and a little bit of pumpkin pie spice in the background. Neither seems to stand out. The taste ups the intensity a little bit, but not in a good way. The bourbon and pumpkin spices just don't really blend all that well in this version. The mouthfeel is medium with low carbonation. No noticeable alcohol. Drinkability is pretty good for a beer of this heft, and I'll give it points for not having ridonkulous amounts of pumpkin spices, but that's about all I can say."
"Great smooth pumpkin flavor and spices just like the original but you pick up sweet bourbon flavors. It smooths the pumpkin spice out which I prefer.. The alcohol taste is there but subtle. If you like the original you have to give this a try. Clipper city!"
"D: Somewhat smooth. But too much bourbon to drink it quickly. Definitely a sipper."
"Overall - I think this beer could have been exceptional if the Bourbon influence was toned down. All on all, this beer is a bit of a let down."
