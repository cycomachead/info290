"Welp. Pumpkin flavor is the dominant one. Still tastes like a beer, so at least they didn't go overboard there. Color is great. Mouthfeel is good. Aroma is… pumpkin."
"O- one of the more malty pumpkin ales out there, and it works well with the spices, very drinkable at 8% as well"
"Poured from bomber. Dark copper color with good streaking from an initially thin head. Roasted malt and pie spice aromas with a bubblegum note from the yeast, perhaps. Full, rich flavors. Medium sweetness with all the spices."
""
"Overall:  This is a really, really good beer!  I really like the savory tartness that this beer has.  If Long Trail put this out next year, I’ll certainly get a bottle of it to enjoy!"
""
"One of the best pumpkins I have had.  bomber bought at the brewery two months ago poured into a snifter.   Very nice carmel and malty flavor with very light spice.  Would search this one out if you like low spice in your pumpkins."
""
"Sweet smooth hint of wine. An ok beer."

"First impression: Circus Peanuts, those faux orange flavored soft candy. That doesn't sound appealing, I know, but it works. Up front is a solid amber flavored base. The hop kicks in during the swallow. The aftertaste is first hint of sweetness and the confection marshmallow of orange.  Very rich body with a low carbonation--rich."

"either way, one of the better straight-shootin' craft pumpkin beers"

"This taste like drinking  a slice of pumpkin pie.  come on  this is beer.....  and well.  if you make a pumpkin beer it should have some pumpkin back bone. The spices shine through but the bitterness is impressive.   Nice, smooth, and well pumpkin."

"Long Trail's Imperial Pumpkin is an exceptionally well-proportioned pumpkin ale. Its success at harmonizing nutty, malty sweetness, hop and squash earthiness, and baker's rack spices makes it exceptionally approachable (especially considering its strength). Like most of this brewery's offerings this is well made and reasonably priced; an easy one to recommend."

"The taste never reaches the level of sweet as there bittering hops counteracting any sweetness that might be present. Finishes clean and the hops balance the pumpkin spices with an interesting take on the style. Those looking for a sweet pumpkin pie bomb probably won't care for this one, but I found it to be a solid representation of the style that is slightly off center."

"For a pumpkin ale it pretty decent, I'm a huge Long Trail fan!!"

"O:  This is a big in your face tour of malt.  It's the perfect big malted pumpkin for a crisp fall night.  The pumpkin and spices are not making a bold statement...rather a supporting flavor."

"Bottle, poured into a tulip.  Had a Weyerbacher Imperial Pumpkin last night so I wanted to try this during the 1 pm games today.  Solid.  A: poured a very pumpkiny orange-brown, with a thick head that was creamy white on top and more orange down towards the beer.  No lacing, and the head did not stick around long.  S: great pumpkin flavor, but lots of spices.  There was a malty sweetness, but no creaminess.  T: warming, solid cold and after warming up a bit, with aggressive spice and pumpkins.  No hops whatsoever, as expected. Aftertaste of some dry spices and an earthiness, like a wet grain.  Tasted more bitter than sweet.  Solid, but not great--mostly nice because it wasn't imbalanced like a lot of other pumpkin ales.  M: mouthwatering and medium-bodied.  You do feel that 8% ABV.  O: Pretty good, and better than most pumpkins.  Nicely balanced and not overly spiced nor super-sweet, but a bit too much astringent/bitter flavor for me, and you could taste the higher content more than other imperial pumpkins."

"one of the better pumpkins going in the early season here. its great, not over spiced, which i love, but also not under flavored. featuring the pumpkins better than most others i have seen, just a light nutmeg hit in there, and maybe a little honey or maple sweetness as it finishes. the alcohol is warming, and when the beer is room temperature, it burns just enough. maybe its still hot outside, but this beer brings me to fall. i like the beers that take me someplace, and this one definitely does that. rich caramel malts and even a hint of rye spice in this, although i question its presence. it is a little thin in body for its size, so the booze stands out more than it should towards the end. mild cinnamon on the close, but its never spice before squash. overall a nice beer from this series, seasonally perfect in the early going."

"I poured this beer it has dark mahogany color body with a small head. The aroma is of cinnamon and brown sugar. The taste is malt upfront then the spices come through. The cinnamon and nutmeg and brown sugar. The mouthfeel is smooth and overall a good imperial pumpkin ale."

"Decent. More of a nice english brown ale with a hint of spice, rather than an imperial pumpkin ale. Nice to try once."
""
"Pours a one finger light tan head that fades slowly leaving a good lace. Cloudy amber color. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Strong pumpkin pie nose and flavor is sweet pumpkin pie spices, hints of hops at finish. Higher ABV is hidden. $6.99 for a 22oz bottle from Market Basket Concord, NH."
""
"Pours auburn autumn color, red hints, some white foam. Brown sugar, sweet pumpkin nose. Rich hearty pumpkin taste, malty caramel. Sweet hop. A little boozy. Quite filling. A very good imperial pumpkin. Recommended."

"I'm not big on fruity beers; I'm more into IPAs and good stouts and porters. For kicks and giggles I'll try certain seasonals. I recall Shipyard Pumpkin being the first of its kind and I concluded 'this wasn't for me'. Then came Samual Adams Pumpkin. Overall I found this was an improvement. Today I had the privilege tasting Long Trail's Imperial Pumpkin on tap. Now we're talking! It was cloudy and amber in color. Taste was a near perfect balance of pumpkin and spices. I am scheduled to try Samual Adams Fat Jack this time next week. I almost can't see how it could be any better than this one but we'll see!"

"Overall: a nicely flavored pumpkin ale that is enjoyable on a cool afternoon. Easy to consume and hits the tastebuds just right."
""
""
"D - Love the artwork on the label, but I guess that's the point of the brush & Barrel Series... Excellent appearance and aroma... Things drop off a bit in terms of flavor and ... It's still a rock solid beer and different lives up to it's """imperial""" label... Not your typical Pumpkin Ale by any means, but that's okay... Just not sure this is something I would recommend nor indulge in with regularity..."

"Considering Ive had several other oaked aged beers (primarily in bourbon barrels) this beer was great. Heavier on the pumpkin and all spice flavor with not too much of an oak flavor. The beer while holding a higher ABV did not have too much bite and was on the syrupy side of things, something I appreciate. Poured with an aggressive pour and it had just over 1""" head. Definitely recommend it to those of you who are die hard pumpkin fans such as me."
"Overall a great pumpkin beer """bang for your buck""" and I have had worse. Could use more spice though as always..."
""
"Overall – An overall quite enjoyable pumpkin brew. It had a good level of sweetness which was balanced by the pumpkin, spice, and light roasted flavors quite well. A good one to give a go to if you have the chance."
"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass. Pours a bright reddish orange with a beautiful, 2 inch off white head that leaves awesome lace and had exceptional retention. Smell is pumpkin spice, cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, and some brown sugar. Taste is all that, very balanced and not over the top like some of these pumpkin beers, nice. Body is medium, nice amount of carbonation, not dry, and easy sipping, pretty tame for 8%. It is a nice cool fall evening the perfect night for this, probably my favorite pumpkin fan ever. Not really a huge fan of the style normally."
""
"O - It gets better as it warms up, thats for sure, but for $7 for a bomber, I think thats a decent price for the weight of this beer. Its got a decent complexity that others dont really score on, but I dont like the finish on it."
""
""
""
""
"I taste as many pumpkin beers as I can find because I believe a good pumpkin beer is very elusive. This is one of the few that I've ever had that caused me to buy multiple bottles at a time. Beautiful color, thick foamy heady and delicious malty head with just enough spices and a sharp, strong ale flavor. I really enjoy this beer and hope they stick to the recipe in future years."
""
""
""
"O. The pumpkin is tamed, but it's a rich-tasting brew. Perfect on an autumn evening, but if I'm nitpicking, it lacks that defining pumpkin taste that I look for. But an excellent brew."
"Nice artwork on the bottle, too."
""
"Found this beer to be rather pleasant. The pumpkin is not overwhelming nor underwhelming in its taste and mouthfeel. Seemed to go down rather well. For an imperial, it was not too heavy and complex. So much so that it is almost a session beer. 8.0 % is still high enough to need close monitoring. Enjoyed the beer as well as the bottle cover art."
" I think I will have another Dogfish Head Punkin Ale."
""
""
""
""
""
"Aroma of candied fruit has much pumpkin but little in the way of spices. Not as much depth as I'd expected from its high ABV, imperial nature. The flavour is also not as complex or well balanced as I'd hoped with a real focus on bittering hops and alcohol heat in the finish. There are plenty of caramelized malts, toffee and pumpkin fruit in the body but almost no cinnamon or nutmeg or other typical """pumpkin pie""" spices."
""
""
"O - Long Trail's Imperial Pumpkin is a big little beer. 8% alcohol is light and warming, caressed by roasted pumpkin and delicate spice with malt complexity at it's core as it's a simple and tame imperial pumpkin."
""
""
""
""
""

"16oz. bottle poured into a large pint glass. Pours a dark orange or amber with minimal head and carbonation that fades quickly. Small amount of lacing. Noted of nutmeg, cinnamon and other spices in the taste. Surprisingly, this pumpkin beer has a minimal pumpkin taste, but instead tastes like a spiced ale. The 8% is hidden pretty well. Smells of cinnamon and nutmeg as well. A pretty good taste, but far and away not in my top 10 pumpkin beers. It is a very good value for how cheap it is though."
""
""
""
""
"This was my first pumpkin beer of the season, and I didn't think it was anything special."
""
"I am glad I tasted this one, but overall it was a little to light and thin for me"
""
"Overall not a bad way to kick off pumpkin beer season. A little heavy for mid-August but tasty. Touches upon all the expected flavors of the style. A little too dry but that's just me being picky"

"Whereas the hops were difficult to find in the aroma they present themselves more so in the taste after a quick flirtation with sweet malts, pumpkin, spices, and cinnamon. Moderate lingering bitterness at the end. Nicely done."

"The body is thick the flavor is nearly... not pumpkin. This is fascinating but not exactly brilliant. I feel Long Trail is close to finding a new take on pumpkin beers but needs to clean up the alcohol heat and marry the flavors a bit more to make it get. In a sea of generic pie spiced pumpkin seasonal beers, though, this one stands out as a unique and brave take on the style."
"22oz. bottle: This one pours a clear, orangish-amber color. There was almost no head on it, and no lacing. The aroma is decent, and expected. Pumpkin, cinnamon and nutmeg are the dominant ones. Not overdone, but they mask anything else. The taste is pretty good. Nicely balanced between the hops and malts. A touch of pumpkin, the pumpkin pie spices, and a hint of bitterness. A nice fall beer!"
""
"On tap at Capone’s. Served in a Long Trail shaker pint glass. Caramel orange. Over spiced and quite dry. Some pumpkin spice. Tannic. Not very good. Wouldn’t try again."
""
""
""
"Overall OK but not great, decent malt profile, and spices don't destroy it but do come on a bit too bitter and slightly unpleasant. On top of that, the pumpkin is there but not great tasting overall, and booze comes on late and, despite not being very boozy, it brings a slight fusel like flavor. in the middle of the food chain as far as pumpkin beers go."

"Another high ABV seasonal pumpkin ale. This one is an amber color with reasonable clarity and a firm white head (good lace). The aroma is pumpkin pie spice, malt, and distant hops. Some starchy pumpkin flavor in the taste, along with a solid dose of spice and bitterness. The ABV is present in an underlying warmth, but doesn't overwhelm the beer. Its mouthfeel could be smoother and richer, to balance the spice and bitterness. Otherwise, this is a fine example of this seasonal beer (that is my annual search)."
"O: This isn't that bad of a pumpkin beer, but I think I might have enjoyed it more if the smell and taste of alcohol was better hidden."
"O: Overall a decent tasting ale, but with some amazing pumpkin beers out there this one disappoints a little. It has some nice spices to it and is quite smooth drinking, but for something called a pumpkin beer it is very light... I would say drop the pumpkin labelling and perhaps re-market this one as a Winter Seasonal beer....Not sure we'd buy this one again but was worth a try... (and found that a proper glass will make a difference to the smells/flavours a lot)"
"Poured into an imperial pint glass a deep amber tinged pumpkin ornage a very nicely formed sticky slightly off white sticky head atop.Nutmeg,roasted pumpkin,and clove in the nose,I found it outside of the straight spiced box,nice job here.A very smooth feel to the beer,for me maybe to smooth.Flavors just don't jump out at ya like I was hoping,some alcohol and light pumpkin spice but it comes up a little short here.This beer has alot going for it until you put in your mouth than it peters out a little,still I have had much worse of the style."
"Overall is is quite substandard for a Pumpkin ale, Imperial or not. It falls quite short of the higher quality examples like Weyerbacher and Elysian. Lacking the real pumpkin flavor backbone with all spices to carry the flavor profile."
"Pours a darker copper tinted amber, little to no head. Strong caramel and firm seasonal spicing lead the nose, little to no pumpkin, some nutty and roasty qualities, light metallic whiff. Taste light on pumpkin but heavy on the caramel - sweet and lightly roasty, moderate spice with a touch of metallic and minerally earthyness, hints of alcohol. Medium bodied, a touch under carbonated. Unspectacular brew, lacking in seasonal qualities."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a good pumpkin bomb. Definitely worth trying if you're into this style"
""
"O- A good pumkin beer for people who dont like pumkin pie. A little underwhelming, but quite pleasant."
"Toasted, nutty, and slightly bitter notes up front. Spices and pie filling takeover the palate simultaneously. Slightly sweet, with notes of brown sugar, graham cracker, and singed caramel. Clove and nutmeg are the dominant spices, with a little cinnamon. Woody bitterness in the finish, with lingering spices. Medium body, with a little too lively carbonation. Not bad, but not as good as Weyerbacher or ST in the imperial pumpkin department."
"Overall: You know what really good, Long Trail has probably made the best Imperial Pumpkin for your money. For around five bucks you pretty much get it all, I was impressed. I know there are some mixed reviews on this brew, but don't judge by brand or presentation, it is well put together and makes you want another glass once finished. Salud!"
"O: A pleasant change from the cloyingly sweet nutmeg and vanilla bombs, but still leaves something to be desired."
""
""
"Long Trail Imperial Pumpkin is a murky copper ale that's topped with a generous and long lasting, creamy yellow foam of a head. There are lots of spices in the nose: coriander, nutmeg, etc. It's smooth and full bodied. The finish is chewy and a bit dry. It's quite sweet. It tastes boozy-- boozier than it is. I taste possible fusel and lots of spices. There's a long, lingering juniper bitterness. I'm known to enjoy crazy pumpkin ales with great delight. This one is just kind of... rude."
""
""
""
""
"Even and balanced flavor of pumpkin and spices. Low bitterness, clove and dried leaves linger. Very well blanced flavors of pumpkin, malt, and spice. Subtle cinnamon and nutmeg, spices are not overpowering on this one, which I prefer in a pumpkin ale. ABV does not detract. Above average mouthfeel, full but not too viscous. Overall a very good beer, one of the best pumpkin ales I've had."
""
""
""
"Poured from a bomber into a tumbler pint, the beer is a crystal clear, vibrant, ruby colored brew with a thin, filmy surface coating that is white and bright. Aromas of sweet, roasted pumpkin with some nutmeg, cinnamon, and all-spice highlighting throughout. Flavors are mild, with a roasted pumpkin backbone, both rich and sweet, with a bready characteristic. Spicing is present to keep things in check at the end and clean up the palate. Spicy and roasted aftertaste that is subtly sweet, which goes perfectly with the light, smooth body. Crisp, clean finish that leaves a slight spicing to linger in mouth. Pretty tasty."
""
""
""
""
"Cheers!"
""
""
"This is pretty decent stuff. Not being a huge fan of the style I find this easy as pie to take down. 8% is not that light though so a whole bomber while doable, would zonk me out.. I would like to find a happy medium between this and pumKING in both taste and ABV as I have not yet found a favorite Pumkin brew."
""
""
"Pours a burnt orange with a finger of head that dissipates rather quickly. The nose has just a mild hint of pumpkin in it. The flavor is certainly full-bodied with some pumpkin and a touch of cinnamon. There is a touch of sweetness as well as a sourness that likely comes from the pumpkin itself. The finish is bitter, but not overly hoppy. There is some alcohol presence to this offering, but not enough to make it unpleasant. Big, good, but not great."
"O: a fairly standard pumpkin ale it drank a lot like a dubble in the mouthfeel and the spice flavoring but alcohol was present perhaps some collaring may mellow that out a bit but by doing that the spices in the beer would also dissipate losing some of its character"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation being moderate. Overall, I thought it had a pretty good aroma for the style but the spices dominated too much in the taste. Not a bad pumpkin beer, but not a stand out in the style for me."
""
"O - Yep, it's a pumpkin beer."
"Pours great - expecting or hoping for orange like the inside of a pumpkin but pours a deep amber and orange - doesn't disappoint, it's like the inside of a pumping but as expected with spices and brown sugar. Smell is pumpkin first with brown sugar and maple, then spices, and finally a bit boozy. The booziness almost disappears via the taste and reinforces heavy pumpkin and brown sugar. Spices are present but have had stronger in other similar brews. Well done."
""
""
""
"As a whole, this is one of the better pumpkin-based beers I’ve tasted, since it manages to be both delicious and understated at the same time, as opposed to many of its peers which taste like pumpkin puree and overpowering clove. The flavors here blend well, playing off one another and each refusing to overpower the others. There is a slightly sharp touch of alcohol on the back of the throat, and the aftertaste does lean slightly too much toward pepper, clove, and anise, but as a whole this is a very good flavored beer."
""
"O: This is a pretty average pumpkin beer but it is pretty easy to drink for an 8% ABV beer, which is saying something. It is a great deal at $4.99 for a bomber, much cheaper than other pumpkin beer offerings available in bombers locally. Enjoyable but nothing really stands out with this beer."
"Overall: Not a bad pumpkin beer. I am new to this style so I dont have much experience to compare this beer with other pumpkin beers. As for my tastes I could take it or leave it; I did not get to excited about this beer."
""
"Pretty drinkable for 8%abv, may be its greatest attribute. Nothing wrong with this one but nothing stands out either. Whatevs."
"Served in a stem glass, burnt orange color, with a small cap of off-white head, minimal lacing and retention. Nutty aroma, malt sweetness and mild pumpkin pie spice. Taste is fairly nutty, woody, brown-ale-ish maltiness, notes of pumpkin, cinnamon and nutmeg, not very big in the pumpkin pie territory, and when it comes to pumpkin ales, I do like a big up front slam of pumpkin and spice. This beer just came up short. Medium body, fairly drinkable, but nothing I'd go back for, especially with the likes of Weyerbacher around."
""
""
""
""
"O: This one is over spiced for a pumpkin ale. I like it, but it is slightly out of balance with all of the spices taking over and stealing the show. The malt body seems to be good and it is relatively thick for a pumpkin ale."
""
""
"O: Not a bad pumpkin ale really. Too heavy on the spices, almost giving it a harsh flavor. It needs to be less spicy or perhaps sweeter instead to balance it out. It was still quite good and I enjoyed drinking it, regardless."
""
"Unsurprisingly, another first beer from a new brewery for me via the pumpkin or octoberfest variety. After sampling a few other staple pumpkin beers earlier this week, I bought a case of 22's of this selection. It's definitely an ale, with good body and consistency, and easy to drink. This beer has a comparable taste of other """spicy""" pumpkin ales with less abv. which impressed me. I'm not particularly a fan of this type of pumpkin ale, but as an ale fan, this beer is strong."
"Head crests at over a finger of dark tan, orange tinged foam, good mix of different bubble sizes, dissolves to a basic coating, lacing takes the form of not so sticky sheets. Bronze to red rust colored liquid, mostly translucent with a fair amount of visible bubbles, turns a bright yellow around the rims. The amount of pumpkin in the nose is above average, however, it is really the brown sugar, maple syrup which dominates, followed on by cocoa powder, nutmeg, candied orange peel, has a certain toasty feel to it, has an herbal underpinning to the spiciness, carries itself proudly. Medium-bodied, has a softer and creamier mouth entry which then stiffens as the carbonation sets, creates a tighter weave. The pumpkin flavor melds with mocha, coffee, whipped cream, cinnamon and nutmeg along with an orange zest infusion. Seems indecisive in terms of wanting to be structured or sweet and fruity, would probably benefit from just going for it full throttle on the pumpkin. Mouth perfume too heavy to lift much. It’s actually a quite pleasing brew, only needs to have more fun to excel."
""
""
"A great pick. Skip the regular Pumpkin Ale and go for this, especially on a cold October night."
"Kind of a mess of a beer. Imperial pumpkins just don't work in my book. More of an Imperial amber with a muddled spice mix and odd alcohol bitterness. Less amber more pumpkin."
"Compared to other pumpkins at this abv level, this one really crapped the bed."
"Overall: Good, not great. I can see why brewers are getting in on this popular style of beer (which I enjoy), but for my money, there are much better offereings such as Southern Tier Pumpking and Weyerbacher's pumpkin. Cheers!!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall a very good addition to the pumpkin lineup. A little less expensive than the heavy hitters yet still holds its ground. Glad Long Trail released two this year."
"O - very nice pumpkin beer. a nice amount of spice. needs a little more pumpkin flavor"
"Served on tap at the brewery on the release day. Nice hazy orange/amber color. Light head with moderate lacing. Nice, but not overpowering aroma of nutmeg, pumpkin and other spices. Nice spicy taste of nutmeg, pumpkin and light cinnamon, with a mild alcohol warmth in the finish. It could use a little more pumpkin, but I really like this beer."
