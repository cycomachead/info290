The mix between the lemon and the pumpkin/fall spice is something I've never seen and so it was a unique experience, one that was quite tasty.

3.64,2.8,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.25,3.5,"was it just me? or is this thing pretty good? never would have thought to do a pumpkin shandy, but the lemonade aspect of this does a lot of the pumpkin, livens it up without the need for fall spices, which i guess makes it pretty unique in the pumpkin beer world. also, are these guys new? this is the first ive seen from them but am indigenous to the area. its clearish and rather orange, strange looking really, especially for what it is. the taste is nice though, slightly tart from the citrus, rich and earthy from the pumpkin, clean in the finish, and indeed refreshing. im not sure the right context for this, as its too fally for hot weather with the squash, and too light in body and high in carbonation for a hearty fall beer, so its sort of stuck in no mans land out in the middle of september or something, but i like it just the same. uniqueness goes a long way with me, and this is certainly that. also appreciably dry instead of sweet like many other shandy types, so that helps it stay sessionable for me.","StonedTrippin","Nov 30, 2014"

The pumpkin flavor itself is not bad, but the shandy makes it too sweet. It starts to taste more like a fall version of Mike's Hard Lemonade. If you want a different take on a pumpkin ale, I would recommend New Belgium Pumpkick. While not great, I think the sour tartness from the cranberry is a better spin. This one is fizzy, sweet, and was hard to finish.","WesMantooth","Sep 29, 2014"

It is a shandy and the label does not hide the fact that it isn't going to taste like pumpkin ales so I can't accuse Traveler of false advertising.  It certainly isn't bad but there's far too much lemon taste in my opinion.  It tastes like a sweet lemonade swallowed with a mouthful of weak pumpkin pie.  The pumpkin pie taste is definitely there but it's competing too much with the lemon.  It was definitely worth trying because all pumpkin beers deserve a chance but I'll pass on this one next time I'm in the store.","badun","Sep 09, 2014"

I still only mamaged too produce a finger of soapy, tawny head with moderate retention as a result. Color was an orangish-copper (SRM = > 9, < 13) with NE-quality clarity. Nose smelled like pumpkin pie spices - cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice. I did not really get lemon, but that's okay, since it would be kind of out of place. Mouthfeel was kind of thin, which is common to shandys, apparently. The flavors were kind of riotous in the mouth, loads of spices, the lemon peel asserting itself and even a molasses sweet-bitterness. The finish was semi-sweet and the molasses taste overcame the spices in an unexpected twist. This was a curious drink. I may not have liked it as much in the Fall, when I was inundated by Pumpkin Beers, but as an out-of-season break from Summer seasonals, it was pretty good.","woodychandler","Jun 19, 2014"

Not very bitter or hoppy, in fact not at all. Good body and not too strong of an after taste. This is a decent beer and worthy of being on this website.","chudson1992","0"
