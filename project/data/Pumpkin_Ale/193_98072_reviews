"Not a bad pumpkin beer, but like some others it just wasn't balanced. Too much on the sweet."
""
""
""
"It's a good brew. Not sweet or candy-like which is a problem with several of the more popular pumpkins... not over-spiced. It's moderate in all areas to include carbonation, and really makes a nice beer to open after work."
""
"Pours a dark clear ruby amber with a medium beige head. Aroma is of mild pumpkin, nutmeg, some cinnamon spices, notes of caramel malt become more prevalent as it warms up. Taste similar to aroma with some mild bitterness. A medium body with moderate carbonation on the palate. Caramel malt, pumpkin, nutmeg and mild cinnamon spices and mild bitterness on the end. Not as cloying and overly sweet as some other pumpkin brews, but nothing really stellar either. Overall an ok drinking brew for a pumpkin brew."

"O: A good exemplar of a much-maligned style, although not something to seek out."
""
"Overall: For the style this one is a better beer. It blends just enough of the spice and just enough pumpkin flavor to make it work. I do suggest it, but in limited quantities."
""
""
""
"Copper-ambaer colour, with a big head and big lace that never seem to vanish. Smell of fruits and spices, smoked, pepper, cardamom. Medium to light body, soft palate. Taste of cardamom, smoked touch, pepper, fruits, caramel."
""
""
""
""
"Overall mixed feelings, it started nice, spices weren't overpowering, but don't get a whole lot of pumpkin, and plenty of sweet syrupy characters, thankfully also not too much, but still not a very enjoyable beer and hard to drink more than a glass, but not that bad."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Just a little bland and watery and has a slightly off-putting dry finish, like there's too much hop or spice that builds up."

"Pretty tasty. I could definitely see knocking back a few of these while watching football"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is smooth and a little on the light side. If you are in the mood for a Pumpkin Ale, this one meets all requirements."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is solid with a more bready malt take on the style."
""
"Overall: It's a really good pumpkin beer. If you're a fan of strongly spiced pumpkin beers it probably wouldn't be fr you. If you want just enough pumpkin spice to remind you that it is the fall, my recommendation is to try it. What I really like is that the base beer is tasty enough to stand by itself. Even if you aren't a fan of pumpkin spice, the nice toasted flavor in the beer really makes this a pleasant beer to drink. I'm going to pick up some more."

"Exceptional pumpkin ale with a balanced profile and not too overwhelming pumpkin pie flavor.  The aftertaste brings home the sweetness of the pumpkin, and solidifies this as a well-rounded seasonal ale.  The aroma was very subtle, though, with not much to offer.  Once again, Anderson Valley does it right."

"Overall - Your average craft pumpkin ale; drinkable but not very rewarding. Glad I was able to try it, but this does not make my short list of pumpkin ales worthy of buying."

"Really solid, flavorful pumpkin ale with great sessionability.  Hits the right spice notes for me, some cinnamon, a hint of nutmeg, some pie crust, just a little pumpkin not too overpowering just subtle and balanced.  Great slick mouthfeel."
"My first pumpkin ale in a few years and I wasn't terribly impressed. Good strong nutmeg and cinnamon aromas and flavours, but a lot of spice and not enough pumpkin. Good amber colour, but a bit thin for a beer with so much flavour."

"Not too sweet or overly pumpkiny. Liked it"
""
""
"So what stands out about this one? Spice and brown sugar flavors. The nutmeg, cinnamon, and brown sugar are pretty loud here. If you like heavy spice in your Pumpkin beers, Fall Hornin' will deliver."
""
""
""
"Dark pour that is not quite black but has some red and brown highlights. Has a tan one finger head. Aroma is lightly spicy with nutmeg and cinnamon standing out. Taste follows the nose with nutmeg and cinnamon flavors but also can taste gingerbread, brown sugar and a very light pumpkin presence."
""
""

"i like it all except the body here. quite a few watery drinking pumpkin ales this year, not sure why, but i like them heavier than this one. despite its darker amber look, its so fizzy and thin that it feels more like a soda than a beer. the head is like a soda float too, huge bubbles and a lot of carbonation activity in this. the flavor of the beer is great though. a hit of ginger in there with the nutmeg and the pumpkin. nicely selected amber malt base, which i think is the right platform for these flavors, i just want it to be a bigger contributor to the feel. white pepper and brown sugar i the finish, if this had more body to stand on it would be a real impressive brew. just enough hops to balance the finish too, i think the recipe is close to being a real winner."

"Yay for a pumpkin beer in a can!  I've had many a pumpkin beer and actually found this one to be fairly tasty.  The pumpkin spice flavors are there but not overpowering other nuances of the beer.  Definitely one of the more balanced pumpkin beers I have had."

"2.8/5: ...have I mentioned I don't care for most pumpkin ales, yet?"

"A nice pumpkin ale with an impressive head, firm spice backbone, plenty of pumpkin flavor, and a darker character than most. Medium body, slightly chewy."
""
""

"Just enough spices and pumpkins to balance out a nice malt bill."

"Overall: Far less than exemplary, barely average really, with little to support a return visitation. Nowadays, there are innumerable better pumpkin beers."

"I like the color scheme and artwork on this can, but I have to say I don't get the Fall Hornin' name. I don't understand what that means. But whatever, this beer pours really dark brown with a nice head. A lot of pumpkins don't really get a lot of suds but this one does. Aroma is malty and herbal, spiced, and has another buttery element, which really comes through in the flavor. As with a lot of other pumpkins, I don't get much pumpkin, mostly spice. Has a nice mouthfeel, a lot lighter than I expected with how dark it is in color, and good carbonation. I do like this beer, and think it's a nice take on the style."

"The aftertaste isn't bad - a bit of dark malt comes up, and a booziness. As I drink this I keep lowering the rating. It is a disappointing brew from a great brewer."

"Another interesting beer from Anderson. This one pours a nice dark pumpkin. The aroma and taste are slightly subdued and that is ok because it allows the pumkin taste to come out naturally and not be overpowered by too many spices. The pumpkin is a natural flavor and this beer is light yet still refreshing and satisfying"
"Pours a cloudy brown with a creamier white head. The head mostly leaves quickly, but a little hangs on to leave a small amount of nice lacing. The aroma is distinctly pumpkin, but real pumpkin, not the candy-corn pumpkin pie-esque smell of other pumpkin ales. There is also a hint of the spices. The taste is savory, with the pumpkin's gourd qualities front and center and the spice backing it up. It all comes together on the finish. The body is thicker and there's a fair amount of carbonation. This is a pumpkin beer I'd drink again."
"Overall, it’s an easy going great tasting pumpkin beer that doesn’t way you down in anyway…very nice beer here folks."

"Wasn't expecting a lot as this was the first Pumpkin Ale I'd seen from Anderson Valley but I was very pleasantly surprised with one of the better Pumpkin Ales this season. Will recommend this one to friends as it was smooth with lots of mild fall flavors while still presenting a nice pumpkin flavor. Excellent."

"Overall really pretty good. I'm pretty new to pumpkin beers but it's like drinking pie. A big thanks to Anderson Valley and many other breweries this year for putting these out so early. I keep forgetting Halloween is in August"

"Big thanks to Jimbo for bringing me a portion of the new can!  This stuff pours a clear tawny sienna topped by a half-finger of khaki foam.  The nose comprises maple syrup, granola, light molasses, toasted pumpkin seeds, and a relatively mild blend of pumpkin pie spices.  The taste brings in more of the same, the spices blending with the syrup/molasses-laden graham-cracker malt backbone rather well, ensuring neither faction attains too much authority.  The body is a stolid medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a thickly fluid feel.  Overall, a rather nice pumpkin ale, one that doesn't dropkick you with spice or booze.  I could see drinking a few sixers of this during this upcoming pumpkin ale season."

"A big thanks to the creator of the canquest, woodychandler, for this beer. Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a deep brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of pumpkin, a bit of spice. Taste is not as strong as the smell, some pumpkin, malts, a bit of spice, very drinkable. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a pretty good beer."
"A perfectly serviceable pumpkin beer. Porterish, brownish, and easy to drink with muted but present pie spices but perhaps no real silkiness from any real pumpkin. Still, it hits the spot without filling you up too much, is a bit different from some of the other pumpkin beers, and is conveniently in cans. I've bought more than one sixer and enjoyed it."
"O: Surprisingly good. Not sickly sweet or synthetic. One of the better pumpkin beers I've had."
""

"Overall: Not a bad beer, very easy to drink but no where near the top of the food chain when it comes to pumpkin beers. It's good to have for the moment and definitely still better than some other beers that try """harder""". Salud!"
""
""
"Overall a very tasty and gourd forward punpkin ale."
"My pour netted me a finger of dense, tawny head with good retention. Color was a deep copper (SRM = > 22, < 27) with NE-quality clarity. Great lacing began to form as the head fell. The nose smelled like a Yankee candle, thanks to a heavy (seeming) presence of vanilla to go along with the other spices. I am unsure just how I feel about this as it is different, but I have also tried a LOT of different pumpkins this year and for this to just appear is wondrous. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full and I am beginning to wonder if that is not a construct of the spices interacting with the yeast in some way. It was not quite creamy, but it was on the approach. Cinnamon was the prevalent spice, but clove and ginger were also in the mix and so was the vanilla flavor noted on the nose. Finish was semi-dry with the malt getting a chance to offset the spices. Overall, it was better than many, but not as good as some. YMMV."
""

"O- It’s a nice change to see a darker pumpkin ale. I loved how it smelled. I found myself inhaling deep whiffs of this one. The initial flavor was good but after 2/3 of the bottle the palate kind of gets tired of it. Needs just a bit more body."
""
"12 oz can. Pours dark amber with off-white, long lasting, foamy head. Aroma is of pumpkin, caramel malt, spices and some piney hops. Body is medium and smooth. Taste is of pumpkin, caramel, spices and herbal, piney hops. Finish is long and astringent. I expected much more from this brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured to a great, full and thick head, tan in color, with great retention and lacing. Appearance was a brilliant ruby color with just a slight haze. Aroma was of spice, hints of cinnamon and nutmeg with some malt notes. Had a pronounced mulling spice note up front with some malt and caramel on the back. Nice creamy mouthfeel with a clean finish. One of the best fall beers I've had."
""
"The aroma was a full-on spice attack, no pumpkin, let alone malt, yeast, or hops, showed through. Same dealio on the tongue, just palate wrecking spices. The body was nicely medium, and had a pleasantly dry finish. Drinkability was non-existent, I had 4-5 ounces, and passed it back across the bar. Overall, a poor example of the style. Admittedly, it's not a style I like, but I'm being as fair as possible here. There are many, much better P-brews out there, drink them, avoid this one."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, 2013 release. Pours slightly cloudy deep ruby red color with a 2 finger dense and fluffy khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of big pumpkin, caramel, cinnamon, gingerbread, nutmeg, toast, brown sugar, allspice, light chocolate, and floral/toasted earthiness. Nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt, pumpkin, and spice notes; with good strength. Taste of pumpkin, caramel, chocolate, cinnamon, toast, toffee, nutmeg, brown sugar, gingerbread, allspice, biscuit, and floral/toasted earthiness. Minimal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of pumpkin, caramel, chocolate, toast, toffee, cinnamon, nutmeg, gingerbread, allspice, biscuit, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of pumpkin, malt, and spice notes; with great robustness, malt/spice balance, and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy and lightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice pumpkin ale! All around good balance, complexity, and robustness of malt, pumpkin, and spice flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"When i poured this beer, it has a dark brown color body with a thin tan head that lays down to a sticky lace. The smell is your basic pumpkin spices, cinnamon, nutmeg. The taste has a balance flavor of pumpkin and spice, spice is a little more than i like but it is still a good beer. It has a great mouthfeel and overall a well done pumpkin beer."
"A very well done pumpkin beer. Prominent pumpkin pie spices without being overwhelming or cloying."
""
""
"Overall: Wow! This is an exceptional, exceptional pumpkin beer!! I love the huge amounts of spice, which is beautifully balanced with the pumpkin, sweetness, malt and hops. I’m definitely getting some more of this, and it’s definitely being added to my yearly pumpkin rotation! It’s absolutely one of the best pumpkin beers I’ve had!"

"Overall, this is good but the spices dominate the pumpkin, big time. Would buy again."

"O- I have to say I am disappointed with this beer. This is nothing more than an average (maybe even slightly below average) pumpkin ale. Pumpkin, pumpkin pie spices. That's it. Every store in my area has this from $12.99-$13.99 for a 6-pack. That is outrageous! I saw that and automatically thought that the beer must have something special, or maybe it was just damn good. Luckily I only purchased two in a mix-a-six at my local beverage center. This beer should be in the $8.99-$10.99 price range just like the other six-packs of average pumpkin beers right next to it on the shelf. The UFO, Sam Adams, Smuttynose pumpkin ales are just a few that are much better. How a brewery or a store could offer this product at such a price is ridiculous. I will never buy this again. Why pay $14.00 for a six-pack of beer when there are a dozen more representations of the style that are much better and for $4.00-$5.00 less?"
""
""
""
"Overall this pumpkin beer weighs in on the pumpkin side of this type of beer. The spices and sweetness don't overwhelm the palate like many of this style do. Well balanced for a change."
"Overall: Pretty solid pumpkin beer. Might have to get a few more before the season is over."

"This is a nicely crafted fall seasonal that just needs a little something to elevate it from good to great."

"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a cloudy mahogany brown with a fine two finger light tan head with great retention and lacing. Aroma of caramel malt, pumpkin, pumpkin pie spicing, heavy on cinnamon and a hint of bandaid. Flavor is sweet bready malt, pumpkin, brown sugar (flavor, but not cloying sweetness) and well adjusted pie spices, nutmeg, cinnamon and a hint of ginger. Nice lightly hop bitter pumpkin in the finish. Medium bodied with a hint of creaminess and good carbonation. A well balanced, mellow pumpkin ale that covers all the bases without going overboard on anything. The spicing is distinct, but did not overwhelm the pumpkin. There are some truly awful as well as supurb pumpkin ales out there and this is one of the good guys."
""
""
""
""
""

""

"Overall, the beer had too much carbonation for my taste, drinking much closer to what a soda feels like, and the canned taste only added to this sensation. After the exceptional looking head and appearance, I had high expectations for this beer, alas it wasn't quite up to snuff and nowhere near as good as yesterday's Fat Jack."
""
""
""
""
""
"Let it warm a bit to bring out the pumpkin flavors."
""
""
"Overall: Coming into this, I was really into this beer and it proved to be interesting and tasteful. The combination of spices, pumpkin and some maltiness all went well together and just overall well-balanced. I would have this beer again and would totally recommend to a friend. Cheers!"
""
"O- an average, middle of the road pumpkin beer. Not bad, but not near the top with the best of 'em."
""
"12 oz can from """Lifesource""" in Salem. $1.89. Poured into my New Belgium snifter. Certainly looks gorgeous dark amber with a nice thick and creamy light tan coloured head. Very strong aromas, of cinnamon and allspice,pumpkin and toffee nice Taste is very spicy up front with the cinnamon dominating,kinda drown out everything else! Mouthfeel is fine..well carbonated but smooth at the same time..except for the cinnamon! Overall if this beer had replicated the aroma in the taste itwould have been a 4.0..too much cinnamon..its like cinnamon chewing gum flavours!"
""
""
""

"Overall not sure if I would buy it again but it's a fairly tasty fall time treat. As always I crave spice so Elysian Night Owl is my go to pumpkin ale."

"O: A very good example of a pumpkin ale. Definitely drinkable."
"overall one of the better pumpkin beers out there. lacks on sweetness which is a plus. recommended."

"Iam starting my fall seasonal beer tour today although it's nearly 90 fricken degrees,still seems odd to see pumpkin ales out when it's this warm.Poured into a standard pint glass a tawny brown with a auburn infusion,a thinner light tan colored head atop.Buttery notes along with pumkin spice but not real strong.Nutmeg stands out most at the onset of the palate along with mace and graham cracker crust,not bad.The feel was a bit fizzy and on the lighter side wich took away from the flavor profile.My first pumpkin beer of the season is....ok."
""
""
"O: I thought this was a more interesting take on a pumpkin ale as it has all of the pumpkin and pumpkin pie spice flavors but without the sweetness I usually associate with the style and some light to moderate amounts of earthiness. Easy to drink and it hides the alcohol well. I would definitely grab another of these."
""
""
"Overall: Solid, not envelope pushing, spicy pumpkin beer. I really enjoyed this one and would get another six pack of this. Very clean."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This pours a medium brown color with a creamy, beige head. The aroma is full pumpkin, nutmeg, cinnamon and clove spice. The texture is about average that will quench your thirst. Once you get to the taste though there isn't a whole lot of to define this as a pumpkin beer. It does finish with a nice cinnamon spice after taste. Above average, but there are better pumpkin beers on the market."
""
""
""
"This is a decent enough pumkin ale. But, I have had more pumpkin-forward examples in the past, which I prefer. This comes across as more of a spiced beverage."
""
""
"Pours a hazy super dark orange-brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of earthy malt and pumpkin pie spice aromas. Taste is much the same with dirt and pumpkin pie spice flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an above average beer with a solid pumpkin pie spice aroma but there is an odd dirt-like flavor that I am not too fond of."
""
""
""
"Nonetheless, for those too conditioned to have some hop or bitter edge to their beers, or for those who typically do not like any flavor, whether spice, fruit, or coffee 'n chocolate, for all its great qualities, this is not the beer for you."
""
""
""
""
"One of the more pumpkin forward of the seasonal beers. The ginger/cola overwhelms a bit. Would've preferred it to be more subtle to allow the pumpkin to dominate. The excessive bitterness also detracts a bit, but the nuttiness saves the day."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A decent pumpkin ale with a lot of spice. Would go well with holiday foods such as honey baked hams and sweet potato."
""
"M: medium body with medium carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A really nice pumpkin beer that's a bit less than excellent. The flavors are a bit on the mild side and the finish is forgettable. Still, the flavors that are present are very pleasant, balanced, and enjoyable."
""
"The body is about medium but on the lighter side of it by a stretch. It's a little crisp and a little smooth, but neither very much. It's a solid feel, but nothing that wows."
"Where the attempt to keep this Pumpkin Ale first and foremost ale-like is much appreciated, that's not what draws us to these tasty beers. It's the abandoning of traditional recipes in favor of accenting the spices with sweetness and strength is what's best about them. Though this is a well made ale, its certainly not the guilty pleasure that drives beer drinkers into a frenzy as if its catnip for adults."
""
""
""
"I often feel that Schlafly Pumpkin is the level by which all others are to be judged and though this is not Schlafly this is very close to it."
""
""
"Drinkability: I'm glad I bought this and tried it, I'll happily drink the rest of the six-pack, however, I'll definitely not be coming back to this one anytime soon. This is good beer, its just not anywhere close to being good for a pumpkin ale. It really needs to step up its game to be able to hang with Schlafly, DFH, Rivertown, and the like. Its great beer, no flaws, but it just misses the mark for being a pumpkin ale..in my opinion."
""
""
""
""
"This is ultimately a safe pumpkin ale. It's fine, but there's nothing about that makes it standout from the pack. Solid, but run of the mill, in my opinion. The fact that it comes in cans is a plus, considering this is a style that is rarely seen in cans."
