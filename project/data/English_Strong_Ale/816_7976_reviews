"Like any Ontario beer drinker in the early 00's (or the two decades prior) I was weaned onto craft beer by Granite Brewery, back when that was one of the only games in town. At that time Peculiar was about as rich and complex as beer got in Toronto - how far we've come. Sadly, while I still maintain fond memories of this Old Ale, it hasn't translated well from cask to the bottle."

"Overall - The odd tart/lactic/vinegar flavour threw me off with this one. Just wasn't doing it for me. Wouldn't buy this one again."

"O: the maltiness of this beer lets you know right up front that this is a British style ale. The flavor and body are just screaming pub ale to me, and I would happily have a pint or two again if offered."

"Clear-reddish brown colour, one finger of white head, some lace. Smell i s a nice mix of toasted grainy malts, fruity with a bit of nutty chocolate, light roast, biscuity with a little floral-fruity hops. Taste is malty with toasty grains, light hop bitterness. Lightly carbonated, light-medium body. This is pretty good but not terribly interesting though, would not pass up if offered but not somethign worth seeking out."

"Drinkability: surprisingly easy for a beer this dark. One of my all-time favourites."
"Poured a dark ruby, bordering on burgundy with a tan head and good retention/solid lacing. Nose has some soft toffee, sweet tobacco, bit of smoke and roastiness. Taste has more caramel/toffee, with a gentle bitterness underlying. Dark bread, with some toast and roastiness to the malts. Great mouthfeel, full. Good drink, something to check out."
"A really nice pint that is made for cask. Light grassy bitterness with a pleasant hop bite in the finish but this not about the hops. Cocoa, earth, a hint of rust, caramel, toast. Light flavored but nuanced and pleasant. The almost complete lack of carbonation suits it as the mouthfeel is creamy and pleasing, drawing out the flavor. An easy pint to finish and I would gladly have another."
"Love the taste of this beer. Dry but sweet, dense but light. A nice caramel undertone which i feel balances the fuggle hops that are used in the mix. Just fantastic. A great beer to have with some banger's and mash."
"A pretty sturdy full-flavoured beer, I could see the appeal of having this as an old standby."
"D - A little too sweet for my taste, but otherwise not bad."
"On tap at the Granite Brewery in Toronto. Deep ruby red liquid underneath a huge rocky head. Beautiful to look at. Aroma and flavour both have strong caramel and chocolate notes. This beer is also pleasantly smooth and fresh tasting. A very sessionable drink."
"Pulled from a hand pump not two feet from my seat, this beer pours out a beautiful deep red with brownish hints and a light tan head that settles out from a foamy body and lasts very well, leaving solid lacing. Some light citrusy hops come on top of a deep and resiny malt base. Almost an old ale, but well classified, I think, as an English strong. The complexity showing with the very moderate ABV is impressive. Coffee and piles of thick caramel, sticky and sweet. Taste only improves upon the promise held in the scent. Vinous notes pour forth, the hoppiness showing well in a balancing role, but not distracting from the real show, the strong malts and barleywine character. Nuttiness in the finish. Mouthfeel is a bit watery, typical for cask, plenty of body though, and quite warming. Drinkability is excellent. My favourite Granite brew, just great."
"drinkability is good. well balanced and low alcohol presence make it very drinkable."
"This was the whiskey barrel aged offering at Volo Cask Days. There was a faint smoke aroma in addition to the regular malty profile. The barrel added a bit of whiskey sweetness to the flavour, as well as a sharp smokiness that was a bit out of balance. It was great to see the brewer trying something new with a long established product. Hopefully we'll see this one again."
"D: Quite good."
"Enjoyable overall, I preferred this to the bottle version. Nice compliment to an enjoyable meal on site."
"Pours a reddish brown body, with a thin white cap. Aroma is floral, toffee, grain, a tad minty and citrusy. Taste was excellent. Great balance. Strong on the malts, fruity, toffee, some chocolate. Balanced by a nice hop bitterness, dry after taste. Smooth, creamy and easy drinking. Great cask ale."
"This is a nice Canadian ale closely based on Old Peculier from the UK. Its a little to sweet from me and the malts a little too plummy."
"Served on tap at Granite Brewery. Peculiar is a nutty reddish brown colour, with thick whitish head when poured. Smells interesting, maltiness and a little bit of citrusy scents. I love the taste of this brew, dark malty sweet with some fruitiness and a bitter finish. The mouthfeel is excellent, very full and creamy. I love this beer very much and I think it has very high drinkability. I suggest anyone in Toronto who hasn't been to Granite yet does so."
"This review supplements my bottle review below. The on-tap is more carbonated, bit more of a head, fresher and served colder. For taste, I prefered the bottle. The on-tap would go better with food and was a good mix in the session. Still coffee toastiness apparent. Less brown appearance."
