"A solid offering from Adnams to be sipped in the colder months which i could have again any day. It reminds of the stronger Stouts and easily the best i´ve had on this style at the moment. Had to edit my review because this fine ale is growing on me. Pretty good!"

"Overall, not the usual beer I would go for but enjoyable none the less. I would not have guessed the strong alcohol content and it wasn't as thick or filling as I expected which is a good thing for me. A beer which is very different to most which I would recommend."

"I really had no idea what to expect and it turned out to be pretty solid, I'm wondering what else this brewery's getting up to and I may just go out of my way to find out"

"Smells of an even blend of caramel and toffee malts with a general toasted nuttiness and plenty of dark fruits. The bottle wasn't kidding when the label boasted of a fruit cake aroma. The flavor follows suit mostly, with a touch of balancing herbal / medicinal hopping. A faintly metallic ghostly flavor nuance does appear as the glass warms up, but rather than being a flaw, it surprisingly seems to provide a dab of extra counter-balance to the malt sweetness! It's really good... right up there amongst my other personal favorite English offerings."
"An approachable, and conquer-worthy old-world strong ale, the subtly of it all clear in the restraint in the main players' getting lost in the timid, though distracting enough off-flavours - to note: mineral and must (which sounds like an old Judas Priest song...). Still rather good though, and duly representative of the style, one, like its kin, having lost its place to the more effusive American take on things, sadly, I suppose."

"Overall interesting, pretty much a good example of an English strong beer, that has characteristics of a bitter and a brown ale, with tons of molasses cake, fruity esters, biscuit, etc. and the hops add a nice bitterness and herbal earthy flavor that doesn't go to the icky taste I don't like. Drinkable, and something I wouldn't mind drinking a bunch of at a pub."
"Taste is similar, extremely rich and complex, engaging and lively. It has rich spicy-sweet caramelized dark breads, rum-soaked dried cherries and caramelised jam, a hint of plum pudding, strong earthy-toasty finish and earthy-spicy bitterness. It has amazing richness of character whilst remaining light and engaging. It is somewhat similar to another favourite of mine, Fuller’s 1845."
"Pours a clear brown with a tan head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is very malty along with some caramel and slightly fruity aromas. Taste is of sweet malt and some burnt caramel flavors. There is a medium amount of bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with a very malty presence that I am enjoying."

"Taste-Subtle fruit, caramel, toasted malt,mineral essence. Subtle hop bite leads to a dryish finish. A very traditional English strong ale. Very pleasant, good character. An enjoyable pint."
"http://abarwithnoname.wordpress.com"
"Aroma is not strong but has tempting notes of malt and fruit with hints of molasses and toffee. It pours a clear, dark cola brown with a decent light tan head. Flavor fills the mouth with malt, caramel, wood, molasses and toffee with a subtle undertone of fruit, mainly apple and cherry. Smooth texture has plenty of fizz and leaves behind a nice malty, woody tingle."

"Drinkability : a good beer in the style English Strong Ale."

"Aromas were caramel and hop but not quite leaping out of the glass. Flavour is caramel, toffee and a bit bready with a crisp bitter finish. Not super complex but still tasty. A risk of booziness but restrained enough not to spoil the balance and mouthfeel. Not the best strong ale but enjoyable and relatively inexpensive."
"The brew pours a see through mahogany hue with decent carbonation that leaves behind a two finger fast vanishing head with sporadic lacing,the smell is xmas pudding,brandy and earthy hops,it has a medium bodied mouthfeel and has tastes of xmas pudding,caramel,burnt toffee,fruit bread and finished with a plum jam dryness and definately moreish and overall a nice drop thats very drinkable and hides its high ABV very well."
"Mouthfeel is medium-full mouthfeel that makes the beer a pleasure to drink. Hops add a nice drying finish. Overall this is definitely one of the better English Strong Ales I have had in recently memory. ABV is well masked and the flavors and pleasant bitter finish make up for the average aromas. Recommended over the ESB from Adanams; both are good, but not revolutionary, but that is not their purpose."
"This is a solid beer, though nothing I'd seek out."
"( 39/50, 6% alc/vol, Home) Very thick and chunky head of thick bubbles of light brown color. Leaves lace everywhere. Beautiful pinkish-brown color. You'll see… filtered and hazey. Usually, expired beer doesn’t smell this good. There's gotta be a catch! Strawberry tartness and chocolate vanilla. Some esters of banana cream pie. Light but for an english ale, wow! There's the catch! The metal aftertaste of an expired brew. I really want to try this new and fresh or on draft! Bitter finish ruined by metal. Could be on the over-bitter side. Silky smooth, medium thick body. Warm and sensuous on the tongue. Small tickle of carbonation. Slight sour. Nutty and Sweet. Oh! How dissapoointing, smelled and looked like a clear winner. Still very nice brew, smooth, bitter and aromatic and warm."
"An excellent dark ale, and well worth seeking out. Achieves a great balance between the dark malt and hops bitterness. I'd have this again...."
"D- For a Full bodied beer you could probably session this which speaks alot for it despite the flavors. A great beer. I have a soft spot for this style but this is top class."
"D. I admit that this beer is not my favourite tiple nor is it my least favourite by any means. A good, robust brew from Southwold that is a good session drinking beer, be careful how you go though, at 6.3%ABV give it the respect it deserves."
"6.3% 50cl bottle from The Beer Emporium, Sandbach. Poured into a pint glass, a brown / ruby colour, minimal lacing. Smells of cherries, sultanas, prunes and malt obvious. Tasted strongly of rich fruit and malt with a bitter finish on the palate. Body is good with a satisfying feel and not over carbonated. One of these beers was enough for me."
"D-Not terrible, but the tartness accumulates overtime making the bitter aspects somewhat abrasive. Could be slightly more balanced"
"Overall this was a good find and I'd get it again to enjoy once in a while with a heavy meat dish."
"Overall, a solid brew, but seems to be in need of some minor tweaking. I was surprised at how pronounced the alcohol was in both the nose and in the taste, considering that it's not much higher than the standard percentage. The sweet, fruit cake character in the nose was the highlight of the beer for me. This one's a good alternative in terms of pricing to Fuller's offering, but in terms of quality, I'd stick with Fuller's."
"Ruby-brown beer with decent off-white head, some lacing. Low carbonation, fruit nose - grapes, prunes & sweet malt. Crisp taste with well expressed alcohol, also fruits and caramel, lingering on the tongue for minutes after beer is over. Warming & balanced ale."
"Notes: Good, balanced beer. Most of the flavor is malt and fruit, but it has enough hop flavor to balance out."
"D - Not the most drinkable ale, and definitely not a session one. However, it was quite pleasant to drink. I also paired it with some aged cheddar cheese, which was an excellent combination."
"The flavour is like the smell - very clean. The malt is light and not too sweet - some mild caramel, molasses tones. The finish is more prominent with enough hop to give it a good low-level of grapefruit bitterness which lingers well after the drink."
"Bottle: Poured a dark amber color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of light dry fruits and some dry caramel malt is mildly interesting. Taste is also a balanced mix between some medium dry figs and raisins with some notes of dry caramel malt. Body si about average with good carbonation and no signs of alcohol. I thought the aroma had some fruity ester that could have lead tom something interesting but the taste couldn't really match up with the rest -not bad overall but I won't seek this again necessarily."
"A solid example of a British ale great and at 6.3% ABV good for warming one up this time of the year."
"Not a bad after dinner drink, but the carbonation might be a bit filling. I'll pick up a few more before they're gone."
"Overall, its a satisfying drink for colder weather. The remaining sugars make this a sweet (but not sickly) sipper, with just the right amount of body to provide the depth and meat of a heavy hitter."
"Dark ruby body topped by a pile of beige foam. The head is moderately retentive and leaves behind a spotty lace. Lots of dried fruit in the aroma; scents of raisin, current, prune, and toffee remind me vaguely of fruitcake. Maybe thats just the power of suggestion given by the blurb on the back of the bottle. Regardless, this stuff smells pretty good. It tastes of malt bread and toffee; fruit flavours at first seem more mute than the scent suggests, but come forward more as the beer warms. Earthy, floral finish provides a lingering bitterness in the aftertaste. Medium-bodied with low carbonation. Feels smooth. Flavourful and balanced, I plan on drinking more of these while it's still to be found on LCBO shelves."
"The mouthfeel is adequate but nothing special and the hops leave a slightly unpleasant bitter aftertyaste which makes the beer challenging after the first couple of sips."
"Just a terrific ale. Well worth a try if you like the style, certainly good for a session, although the ABV is certainly high enough to warrant caution."
"I wouldn't recommend this with pizza, but by itself, it's a respectable ale."
"Drinkability: Worryingly drinkable for a strong ale, could easily see my drinking more than recommended in one night. The heavily malt driven flavours are rich and full, offering a superb classic English ale."
"I tried this beer on August 1, 2008 at ""Smokeless Joe's"" in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The beer poured a very dark brownish red, with a thin tan head. The aroma was caramel malt, and wood. The mouthfeel was medium bodied, creamy, and medium carbonated. The flavour was caramel malt, some spice, and a little bit of hops."
"Would drink again, but only under the right circumstances. ABV on my bottle actually read 6.3, so slightly higher than listed here."
"My last pick at the beer store. It had an attractive price. What a nice suprise!"
"Thanks to Shigadeyo for this one. Pours a murky dark red/brown and has a small but lasting head. Aroma is rich malts, ripened fruits, ashy hints, mild licorice. Flavors of sweet candied malts and fruits, light oaky hints, molasses. Sort of reminded me of a milder Youngs Old Nick. Lightly dry and bitter in the finish. I liked this one alot. Thanks again Craig for this nice suprise."
"drinkability is good. nice balance, solid malty base, and great english hop character. good stuff. even with the moderate ABV, i'm tempted to throw a few of these in the cellar and see how they change. i think that caramel+malt would really come to life once the bitterness mellowed a little, likely approaching more of an old ale character. still, a fine brew as it stands today."
"D - This is a great strong ale. Smooth and complex."
"My expectations where met."
"The aroma has raisins, yeast, brown sugar and carrots. The appearance is red-brown with a large head. The flavor is very sweet with plenty of bitterness and alcohol. There are also the elements from the aroma. The palate is just slightly chewy. Despite some good qualities it has a medicinal aftertaste. This is alright."
"A good English Strong Ale. Something I would recommend."
"This may be a lot more tame than something like the Fuller's Vintage Ale, but it reminds me strongly of it. It doesn't have the peeking alcohol or the intensity of flavour but it does have the same kind of satisfaction come an empty glass. This works for me on so many levels: pints at the pub, a full goblet near the fireplace, or with a hearty meal come cool weather."
"D - Somewhat complex. Not a sessioning beer. Fairly tasty and worth trying."
"Feel is quite thick and syrupy, with malt sweetness on the palate, a bit of heat. Very smooth though, carbonation is appropriate. Finish is on dark fruits, toasted malt, burnt sugar. Hmmm. I like the look and aroma more but this isn't too bad."
"D: Very approachable, but the flavour was a little tiring."
"Pours a cloudy dark orange, brownish hue, tight off white head forms, slightly fizzy, quickly settles itself down to a thin ring, no real lace to speak of. Smell is nice and malty, caramel, raisins, hint of metallic, some citrus, brown sugar, very fruity, a bit woody, nice. Taste is similar, very malty and sweet, lots of brown sugar and caramel up front, raisins, bread, very fruity, berries and cherries, bit of orange, metallic finish with a bit of chocolate milk, light alcohol. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, pretty thick for its ABV, with medium carbonation, with warmth from the alcohol. Not bad stuff, big malty brew thats easy to drink, but kind of simplistic and the alcohol is apparent."
"Nice body but carbonation seems a little much. Too spritzy for the malty flavours you get IMHO."
"Interesting, worth a try, quite substantial."
"Interesting brew, but I'll have to seek out more examples of this style to get a grasp on Adnam's Broadside place in the beer universe."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, this is a good beer with a lot of substance that is worth drinking for a long time."
"Had again a month later and good bitterness."
"Not to be confused with the regular Broadside, the Strong Original weighs in at a healthy 6.0 % ABV - high by English standards. A nice dark chestnut color it fills the glass with a reasonable sudsy head upon pouring which dissipates slowly. Full aroma of malty - fruity notes. Good body as you might expect, strong rich flavors - orchard fruits, malt, caramel, some citrus hop. Rewarding to drink. One of my favorites on this visit."
"Taste of palemalt, nutty, light roasted, a bit husky, and earthy. The top layer of caramalts only enforce the great depth of maltiness. Bitterness is high for style, it balances the sweet malts. Fruit notes given by the yeast of grapes and peach. Body is a bit sweet, but well balanced."
"Drinks very easy, despite the hops not really being simpatico with me. Cask Broadside about 1.2% weaker was one of my go to real ales when I lived in England. This isn't a bad substitute, although cask will always be better. A solid, sessionable strong ale"
"Overall, this one is certainly on-point for an English Strong Ale - one of the best representations I've come across... this one is the real thing - Definitely recommended with an ultra-easy level of drinkability that combined great flavor and taste without any cloying or interfering flavors... Recommended..."
"This is one of the better English strong Ales I've had. Easy to drink and enjoy."
"If there is a cask version this needs to be found..."
"Fours across the board."
"nice auburn color, with a small but firm head .... the distinct smell includes syrup cake and preserved fruits ... the palate is a very interesting mixture of smoked dark wood (tropical), blueberries and tandoori chicken ... with 6.8% ABV this is rather strong stuff ... Broadside is best enjoyed as a after dinner digestive (where it faces fierce competition from some Belgian trappist brews) ...."
"d: i really enjoyed this beer as it was reasonably strong & smooth. one fine english strong ale -- i look forward to the next."
"Starts of tasting rather like a Belgian beer as the nose suggests before a rather more sweet kick, then back to the yeast again before a faintly bitter finish. The feel is smooth, rendering a beer which could otherwise prove cloying relatively drinkable. This one is definitely worth a try."
"16.9oz brown bottle from Florian's. Hazy brick-reddish/brown with around an inch of off-white head that leaves a good amount of lacing. Diacetyl plays a big part in the aroma with a fair bit of malt. Biscuit malt and earthy hops dominate the flavor with undertones of diacetyl. Very well balanced. Full flavored. Full bodied with a good amount of carbonation to support it. Drinkable as well. This is a damn good English ale. I'm quite impressed, and will deffinitely be picking this one up again."
"D: Not great, the end of one makes you not really want another. Not crisp and refreshing or particularly true to the style. It's a good beer, but not really what it says it is. Recommended for dark Belgian ale fans moreso than British IPA/bitter fans."
"Adnams Broadside is a good example of the English Pale Ale, enjoyable, but not my favorite beer style. A beer I think would be much better on cask, in a London pub on a warm, rainy summer afternoon."
"Deep rich red/brown color, slightly cloudy with a small head that left quickly. Rich, fruity malt in the nose; thin mouthfeel. Taste was first rich malt, then sweet carmel, then buttery malt, then slight hop tartness with a bitter, solvent aftertaste. Very complex and interesting, but not as drinkable as I would have liked. Still, worth trying."
"12 oz. bottle poured into a nonic pint glass. Light khaki colored head about a fingers worth dissipated down to a super thin lace around the edge of the glass. Good looking amber, reddish color that is slightly and evenly cloudy. Very little visible carbonation. The nose is full of yeasty, green apples and extra ripe pear mixed with a strong malt sweetness. There's also a small amount of noticeable alcohol. Medium body that is creamy, smooth with a little bit of stickyness. The beer seems to be fuller through the back, pronouncing its big malt back bone after getting a quick blast of buttery, fruity yeast esters and English hop flavor. Slight medicinal/solvency aftertaste. Not too drinkable in my opinion but an interesting brew to say the least."
"Alas to sweet for my taste but a nice product for those who prefer the malts in my humble opinion."
"Poured to a brown color with hints of ruby red, with a thin off-white head that lingereed midway and left okay lacing. Aroma was muted, but slightly nuts and caramel. Flavor was somewhat malty sweet, and while body was fairly creamy, any true flavor was diifficult to ascertain. Although only 6.3%, the alcohol made itself known toward the end in both aroma and flavor, and the palate and finish were just so-so. Not a bad beer, but not great either."
"This one is easy to drink. Mellow for the style, adding to drinkability. A fine, classic example of an English strong ale."
"A powerful beer whose characteristics play off each other well. Complex, would like to try it on tap."
"Pours a brilliant golden-amber, with a generously fruity malt-driven nose and a dense tan head of a rather lengthy duration. Sharp, tangy, sweet, and sour are words that come to mind at first sip. This strong ale (6%) has plenty of character and tastes darker and heavier than it looks . . . if that makes any sense? Flavorful, aromatic malts and hops tug at the tastebuds, vying for your undivided attention. Avery subtle hop bitterness lingers at the end of the palate, inviting sip after glorious sip. Fruity esters abound, thanks in part to Adnams proprietary yeast strain, and notes of citrus joint the melee, struggling for attention. Medium-full bodied, with a touch of creamy smoothness and rather lively carbonation. In some ways this compares favorably with Fuller's 1845, although there's no such yeast deposit (nor is there quite the booze deposit either, but you catch my drift.) Wonderful stuff! (Edit: Adnams were also among the first dozen brewers imported by Minneapolis-based All Saint's Brands. I hope this brew sticks around for a while this time!!!)"
"too bitter for me, actually, but otherwise a fine beer"
"Adnams Broadside Original Ale was a slightly hazy dark red-amber color with a large light tan head. The head was thick and longlasting with lots of lacing left behind. The aroma was sweet malt and a little toasty. The taste was malty, toasty, fruity and a touch peppery with just enough hops to balance the malt. It started fairly sweet with a semi-dry finish. The mouthfeel was full with moderate carbonation. Drinkability was good. This is a very good beer."
"This was very good but I still feel somewhat disappointed after the almost amazing appearance. Stiill, a highly regarded English pale ale."
"Notes: Tasted pretty damn nice. Missed alot of the other categories in my opinion. Rather heavy for the style in the mouthfeel, kinda syrupy at times. Bit of a tinny presence as well. All told this is probably the last I'll have of this. In order to pay import prices I'll have to have a stunner to keep up the purchases."
"All kinds of hefty malts in this beer. This would probably make a great Fall season ale."
"Overall - An excellent strong ale... Recommended..."
"It looks like Smithwicks when poured yet it tastes nothing like it. At first sip you can tell its a strong ale.The alcohol and hops work together to give a spicy tang and warmth. I don't think I would have more than two pints of this brew. A lingering hop aftertaste is pleasurable and is what I think a beer should taste like."
"D - A nice ale to be had, though nothing outstanding."
"I'm not huge on bottled English ales that have made the journey over to the US, but this one surprised me. Caramel color...cappuccino-like lacing left on the glass. Great bold toffee malt and biscuit flavor..with a nice dry bitterness as well. I'm just glad this didn't turn out to be one of those bland, forgettable English ales (which it certainly is not)..and actually reminded me a bit of Fuller's ESB..only $3 a bottle at my local bar, not bad at all."
"Mouthfeel- A little dry and sweet, but mostly refreshing. This beer kind of made my palate feel relaxed."
"This pours a dark brownish red with a large tan foamy head. The smell has a strong dark fruit,prune or raisin, and alcohol aroma. The taste is malty with dark fruit flavors. The flavors are strong except for the malt, which is too weak for my tastes. The m/f is light with flavors that don't mix well at all. The fruit is much too strong with the malt sweetness being an afterthought. This is an Ok beer, but it is flawed."
"D - very tasty brew, alcohol, while in the nose, seems to be fairly well hidden in this one. At 6%, a very quaffable ""strong"" ale. Has that unique Adnams tangy flavor. Keep up the good work, lads."
"A dark amber coloured brew with a white cap of foam. The aromas are hoppy, fruity, and very, very, well-balanced. The taste is maltier than the cask version and the added abv kick is noticeable though this beer still stays very true to it's uk roots as it is jam packed with malt complexity and sweetness, but there is still some hop character as well. Mouthfeel is a bit harder edged than on cask, but the drinkability remains lovely or is that lurvly?"
"This is an alright beer, but I will not go out of my way for it."
"Very drinkable,aye me buckoes. (big wink)"
"better yet, bottle condition it, age it a year, and you've got yourself a damn fine strong/old ale. come on, you know you want to."
"Pours a lovely dark reddish brown with a decent head. Nice aroma with hints of fruit and sweet malts. The fruit found in the aroma makes a return in the front end of flavor and fades to a slightly roasted malt flavor. The only thing I didn't like about the flavor was the peppery finish. This is a decent brew but not my favorite."
"A real bargain with good, go with a meal quality. If you find this for a buck, go for it indeed."
"A good, decent beer, and at $5.99 for a four pack of 12 oz bottles, this one is a great value!"
"There's some degree of alcohol present in the smell. The taste is pretty good, bringing plenty malt flavor to the mouth. Alcohol can be tasted, but it's not as strong in the taste as it is in the smell. Hops are definitely apparent in the finish."
"Drinkability: Different from what I was expecting, this is one of the better British brews I have tasted"
"D: less satisfying than my last bottle. I reckon that I serve this one slightly warmer (15 C) and that might be the culprit? Nevertheless this is still a quality brew worth sipping once in a while, esp. now in winter."
"This is a tasty beer that doesn't make too many demands on the palate, but at the same time is more interesting tasting than a typical English pale ale. It would go well with a hearty (earl of) sandwich, and you'd probably fare better than Mr. Montagu if you chose this."
"Tasted: 11/07/05"
"Brought back from UK this is a beer with a distinctive profile. The beer tasted slightly of caramel with a real semi-sweet malty finish. I really liked the fact that it created its own identity with the toffee richness. Big head on a pretty light brown body this beer is a real charmer."
"In the '90's I spent a few months every year in England and Scotland and made a point of drinking as many different beers as possible. So I am surprised that I never had Adnams before."
"Poured a medium copper with abundant off-white head. Smell is very malts combined with dark fruits (plums, raisins). Taste is fruity mixed with a nice hoppy bitterness. Finishes smooth. Good drinking beer. Thanks to BA mtanji for the sample."
"I like this one a lot. An easy drinker that is worth seeking out. 6% abv is well hidden but could catch up if sessioning this beer. Overall a very good strong ale that I would buy again."
"500 ml bottle, bought in Denmark. Deep copper coloured, very good off-white head. Nice aroma of dark fruits, leather, oak and caramel malts. Flavour is malty sweet with a certain alcoholic burn, but not unpleasant. Some raisin notes too. Decent hops and a peppery finish. Not bad at all."
"Beautiful looking beer. A red- tinged brown with a creamy dense head that is of mild- medium size. Smell is wondefully complex; musky, lighly hopped aroma, some nice roasty things in there. Slight fruitiness on the nose if you look for it. More intensity of smell than most beers I've had. Taste is a nice mix of base malt and an appropriate degree of roast malts underneath giving way to a sharp little hop bite when the slight seetness fades. Good slick fullness in the mouth and stays in the mouth for a long time. It has all the intensity and complexity I love in a world- class beer, but a light enough hand in it that I could find a lot of these empty in a night. If all the bottles are this good (especially for $1.79/ pint bottle), I'm stocking up."
"nice beer overall"
"Pours out a deep amber brew with a nice 1 finger head. Smells of beer, i thought i smelled a slight bit of skunk at first but if it was it left quickly. Taste of sweet malt ,nicely rounded out by hops very subtle.Goes down smooth nice sweet lingering aftertaste.Pretty good brew,wouldnt mind having a few of these bad boys around."
"500 ml bottle. 3 months after the Best Before date, but have no fear, this beer is in great shape. Dark amber with a nice off-white head. Sweet malt aroma with subtle fruit and toffee. Chewy malt flavor flavor with a hint of fruit, and a nice hop flavor in the finish. Great balance, complexity, and drinkability. It's hard to put this one down. I would love to try this beer on cask. It must be orgasmic. Until that day, keep the 500 ml bottles coming. Great beer."
"Burnt reddish-brown with a bubbly cream-colored head that fades away to a small ring around the glass. Brute aromatic force asserts itself through the tiny opening of the bottle right from the get go. Sweet, rotting pine forest smothered in sap, flowers, and alcohol. The slightest roasted flavor provides a welcome accompaniment to the sweetness of the generally smooth, sweet, malty taste. Almost fruity, really. Some grassiness and a mild astringency leads to a potent but brief burst of hops. Very thick and beefy."
"Overall an interesting ale of quiet intensity. Surprisingly warming with only 6% ABV. It seems to me this ale would be done utmost justice straight from the firkin. Will seek this out on tap in the future."
"Really nice deep auburn color with a creamy tan head. Fruity aroma with some hops but a little vegetable note in there as well. Taste is very creamy on the mouth with a rich caramel sweetness and good English hop hit on the backside that provides a fruityness. Slight buttery note actually helps the smoothness of this really thick, chewy bready body. It all works here. Depth is an issue and the richness could be overwhelming after a few but overall this is simply a really well made English ale."
"Drinkability  This one is a mouthfull, thats for sure. It is thick and chewy and almost needs a knife and fork."
"I like this beer much more than I thought I would. While Adnams SSB was pretty good stuff, Broadside Strong Original is a cut above. I'd love to get my hands on the whole Adnams line, but I'm not sure they're available on this side of the pond. Recommended."
"Overall this beer is decent though nothing special. Its worth a try but its a little one dimensional with the malts."
"a pretty good beer that's worth a try."
"I couldn't finish this beer. I gave it to my friends dog. It was like drinking metal shavings. The water was so metallic like many other english beers. It had a decent pour with a decent white head that hung around for a little while. The first sip was like licking the body of a rusty Ford, once I got past the metal fragments stuck in my tongue I tasted a lot of what I smell which was an average amber ale. They should keep this one in England."
"Other comments: After living in Belgium, I was used to 6% abv as the norm. In the UK, this is considered ""strong", but with that also comes more flavor than the typical British ale. Now that winter is here, it is nice to have some of these higher abv British ales around."
"The mouthfeel was a little bland to me without sufficient carbonation. Maybe I got an old bottle. I'd find it hard to stomach too many more of these."
"Caramel, dark fruit (plums & figs). Finish is quick & off dry w/ some restrained English type hop flavours. Very drinkable."
"A very easydrunk beer, balanced and well tasting."
"strong enough to balance out the malt. Finishes fairly sweet, with hints of the 6.3% ABV that lurks within, sort of like a barley wine, with a very slight sourness(possibly from wood aging, if they do it). Full bodied and great mouthfeel, with a moderate carbonation. This is definitely very drinkable and a very tasty brew from England."
"In England they may call this a Strong Ale, but here in the states I call this a session ale. I could have many many many of these."
"Rich enough to be served for dessert. Overall well balanced, of big carbonation, thickness, and malt taste."
"A nice strong ale, not on par with fullers 1845 but its different, good stuff"
"Absolutely outstanding."
"Clear copper in color with a large, beige head that slowly recedes to form a nice sheet over the liquid. Some sporadic lace is left behind. Toffee and fruit aroma with earthy hops in the backround. Very malty with caramel and toasted flavors. Green apple crosses the palate along with a buttery flavor. Earthy and lightly spicy hops balance out the malt. Finishes sweet, then drys out. Medium-full in body, very smooth and slick. Highly drinkable. Very flavorful but not too assertive. A wonderful ale."
"Poured a deep amber color-on the border of brown.Huge foamy head that slowly receeded and continued down the glass.Big malt aroma-hints of caramel.Somewhat spicy.Great flavor-malty with notes of chocolate and caramel.Big,full mouthfeel.Velvety smooth.Great residual sweetness.A great beer I could drink all night.Some of the recent British beers I have had are really lacking something-this makes up for all them in a big way."
"ng"
"The beer came in a 500 ml. brown bottle with a best before date of 3 February 2005 on the back label. The pour was clear reddish brown with a decent sized reddish white head. The lacing was good too. The aroma was sweetly malty with some earthy mild English hops lurking in the background. The taste was similar with chocolate malts, dark skinned fruits, rum raisins, and charred wood. The hops were restrained, but provided a peppery kick and a dry mouthfeel. It is a bit of stretch to call this one a Strong Ale, as this is at a mere 6% ABV. I would put it in the category of an ordinary Brown Ale. But call it what you may, it is quite good."
"It had a rich, malty taste that had so many flavors intertwined I couldn't pick any particular ones out. It was quite good, with a lingering bitterness. One I wouldn't mind having again."
"Slightly murked ruddy chestnut hue. Mountainous, fluffy light tan head leaves frothy lace. Mellow notes of singed toffee and licorice in aroma, accompanied by earthy hop and trace butterscotch. Just a touch too soft aromawise, but welcoming nonetheless. In flavor, prevalent in malt character is an impression of treacle sweetened burnt biscuit and raisin. After a deliberation, dryish, baker's chocolate melds with butterscotch and dark crystal malt tones to lend a cocoa dusted caramel candy impression. Hop bitterness creeps in, soundly offsetting caramel sweetness and lending overall balance. Undertone of candied fig augments as the beer warms. Mild woody hop flavor complements bitter chocolate notes. Agreeably dextrinous in mouthfeel, but not overly so. Finishes with a surprising surge of hop bitterness that yields to a continution of burnt malt tones. A flavorful, rather complex ale that's seemingly a hybrid of a true ESB and English old ale. Not every flavor component coalesces, however, thus precluding excellence. Regardless, Broadside is certainly worth a try."
"Backwash: I was very happy to find this beer, because I like Adnams on draught, and an Adnams pub was one of my favorites in London (its gone now). However, this was somewhat of a disappointment. First, this really isnt much like a bitter. Its more like a hoppy brown ale/winter warmer. I dont think the hops are traditional UK varieties. Considering some of the other great bottle-conditioned beers Ive had lately from Fullers, Freeminer, and OHanlons; this isnt quite up to snuff. Id certainly give it a try if I saw it on draught, but I wouldnt go out of my way to find this."
"This is a beautiful color, a deep ruby thats fairly clear. The head is a bit fizzy, and fades incompletely pretty fast. This is a malty beer. A little wood and a good bit of caramel, brown sugar and cherries. Not a lot of hops present and a bit sweet in the finish."
"Notes: A very flavorful strong ale with simple complexities. An easy pick to pair with a nice hearty sandwich for lunch."
"Not a bad offering....nice dark amber appearance with a decent head, however smell was abit faint with a light malty note. Taste was sweet on the front with a very nice biiter finish. Mouthfeel was a bit too oily for me and that reduced my overall rating. Likewise, due to the oil quality, I reduced my drinkability rating."
"On cask at the St. James Tavern in London. Dark amber/brown color with a medium thin light tan head. Thin and quick lacing. The aroma is rather fruity, with hints of caramel and malt. Medium-bodied and very smooth and smokey. Flavors of caramel, grape, and roasted malt. The finish is silky and long. This is a solid beer that can be found in many pubs/taverns in London."
"Drinks well for a relatively strong beer. Very well-balanced and deep, this is a classic beer that would be even better cask-conditioned, I'm sure."
"Overall, not to my taste, but a great example of this style."
"16.9 ounce bottle. Marked at 6% ABV. Best before 26 Nov 04."
"A nice find here,pours a rich amber with a nice looking slightly off white head.Aroma is deeply malty with some yeast notes with a touch of fruit,taste is sweet and rich with some great fruity depth.Very smooth going down I have a case and I will savor it.A light bitter finish but a nice big malty brew."
"The beer pours a dark amber/brown color with a 1/4"" off-white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It is dry with a malty scent. It also had a fruity yeast aroma. The taste is good. It is full of malty flavor with a strong caramel finish. It has a dryness that makes the beer very crisp and slightly bitter. The mouthfeel is good. It is a full bodied beer with good carbonation. This beer drinks well. It is a good strong ale. It has good flavor and malt complexity."
"I didnt enjoy this beer all that much. Orange-amber in color with a slight tinge of ruby. Porous foamy head thinned out pretty quick. The taste is fruity and heavy handed with sweet malts. Sticky sweet and almost wine like, actually. Leaves a coating of syrupy sweetness in the throat. A sweet ale, that was hard for me to finish. Maybe I just wasnt in the mood for this one. Not bad."
"A great ESB sent to the states."
"Mouthfeel is a bit fizzy, and another beer where bottle-conditioning would have a positive impact. Quite drinkable for what it is, and a very nice example of the style. Best before date of February 3, 2005."
"Nicely hopped, bitter finish, asks you to have another taste. Supersmooth and completely drinkable. A very impressive beer in my opinion. Really worth the wait. Purchased at a grocery store near Prestwick, Scotlund and stuffed in the back of my beer fridge for the last 7 months."
"I keep coming back to this on the shelf. This one is a keeper. Keep some in your cellar for those days you need to relax and reflect on the better things life has to offer. It's that kind of beer."
"i really never notice that its quite strong, even for a traditional english ale, but that is yet another thing about broadside that makes me give it consideration every time im in the mood for a top quality beer from the u.k. i cant wait to head over there next year and get into some of this from the keg!"
"Overall a very good beer. I'll buy again."
"The first Adnams that I had was at The Nags Head in London. That was on cask, this is in the bottle. Both excellent."
"WOW! An English Ale in a brown bottle! I'm rating the taste high just because of that. Deep brown with a copper/gold tinge. Head retention was good, but had to be enticed. Nice even balance of maltiness and hops,maybe a bit of oak and also picking up on some fruit. I would have to call this a ""flat"" beer, in respect to it's equal parts malt and hops acroos the board. Aroma is typical ale but is fresh and inviting. Mouthfeel is good and drinkability is high. Cool bottle too."
"Pours with a serious yellow-brown head that stays, leaving thick sheets of lace. High carbonation. Amber/ruby color, strong malty nose. Medium bodied. Rich malty flavor with some hops in the background. The brewer describes this as ""A heart-warming English beer"" which is exactly what he has brewed."
