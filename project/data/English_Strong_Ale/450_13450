3.48,-7.4,4,3.5,3.25,3.5,3.75,"This is quite a strong ale.  I can't get a grasp on the style?  I guess it is sort of a Belgian golden/pale ale.  Great looking pour with a nice two finger head and golden to copper body.  Scents of esters of apple and alcohol.  Maybe some pears?  Medium bodied with again, a Belgian golden mouth feel.  Pears, apples, and apricot. The drawback is a huge alcohol kick back that is quite noticeable but not unpleasant.  The deist, Thomas Jefferson, who supposedly crafted this beer in the 1700's, must have had quite a high tolerance to consider this one a "tavern ale".  Worth But still, worth a shot.","bigdeuce","Mar 23, 2015"

The enticing aroma is of toffee, or, perhaps, flan. The beer's flavor brings home the aroma's promise of savory, sophisticated sweetness. It's a soft and smooth taste--almost that of a "comfort food"--yet deeply satisfying as beer. The texture is rich. For all of its 8%, it goes down easily.

Bright zinc orange colored liquid, quite a few visible bubbles and they are super-fat, transparent and clean throughout. There’s a well-cooked bread crust stiffness to the nose, however, at the same time sweet grapefruit to orange citrus, honey and ripe apricot, peach notes, then more peppery, grainy bite, definitely has an earthy funk to it as well, a forest floor covered with pine needles and fallen leaves and branches. Full-bodied, sweet and sticky attack even though the carbonation does punch as hard as possible to get things stirred up. Actually turns appreciably drier through the mid-palate, earthy and herbal. The return of banana and bubblegum seems close to Belgian, loses most of the honey as well as the juiciness in the apricot, peach, apple fruit. The citrus in turn comes off as more sour. The textural fullness extends the finish when most of the primary flavors have begun to trail off. Due to its palate weight can’t say it is sessionable or the like. But it has this unique, just off-center character which ultimately keeps you sipping again and again.","farrago","May 16, 2014"

Taste is a kinda one note sweetness with a bitter, boozy finish. Lots of malt shows up, but it lacks complexity. Just sweet caramel. Feel is too thin. It’s not terrible, but it could be drier or richer or more complex. There’s just something missing. On top of that, even though there aren't a ton of English Strong Ales around, I still consider it a strong style, and this beer just doesn't live up to other takes for me.

Tastes strongly of nuts and caramel, sweet but layered; earth, cracker, and pine. Just a hint of alcohol, some bockish grape, touch of smoke, touch of spice in the back. Wonderfully crisp, just that perfect medium level, with a touch of sourness, light bitterness, medium body that can go either full or light depending on the moment. Nice herbal quality. A very authentic english strong ale that I understand that closely aligned with Thomas Jefferson's creation and style.","CuriousMonk","Jan 01, 2011"

For me, I was expecting this to be a bigger mouthfeel. It is about a medium mouthfeel, with almost no carbonation. This beer is a different beer than when I had it fresher (it has 5 or 6 mos on it).

Feels heavy as a stone, and couldn't be less filling if were a bag of sand.

This one pours a clear copper amber topped by a quickly-fading finger of white micro-foam. The nose comprises caramel, spruce, some very light coffee (I think that's what that is...), and a hint o' citrus. The taste starts off with a solid caramel backbone, but then quickly spreads out into a panoply of citrus and floral bitters. Some peppercorn is detectable near the back. Throughout, a vague maltiness is perceived, sorta like a bland old ale hangin' about in the background. The body is a solid medium, with moderate carbonation and an almost chewy feel. Overall, a decent brew, a good occasional, but not really a go-to or everyday offering, if you ask me.","TMoney2591","Jun 29, 2010"

Nose is a mix of herbal hops and sweet maltiness blended with astringent alcohol. The smell of the alcohol carries through into the taste. It has a slight grainy profile that is bitter upfront from a combo of hops and alcohol that blends through the body with some malty sweetness and finishes quite warming from the alcohol with some lingering bitterness.

A wallop of sugary malt from start to finish...The nice surprise is that it finishes juuust crisp enough that some 'dryness' enters the picture.

The flavor makes a little more sense, thought it's still nothing normal (I like that). It's juicy at first, then there's a hit of biscuity grains followed by citrus rind and earthy hops. I should mention the aroma hints at a possible infection. I can't tell if its juicy hops, or something more acidic and musty. Oh well, it's good for now. Worth a try for something different.

This sacrifices very little for its higher ABV, maintaining a nice balance between malts and hops and a very nice drinkability. I dont know exactly why this is quite so expensive, but I have to say that much of the cost shows up in the glass, so Im much less likely to quibble about it.

3.82,1.6,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Red/peach color in the glass. White head on the pour leaves the glass quickly. Outer slight white ring and lace left on the pint glass. Touches on honey and malt sweetness and roasted nutty malt. Thick sweet malt initial taste followed by a roasted hazelnut and dry grass finish. The mouth is medium thick and coating upfront with a dry tongued apparent abv finish. Not a bad brew.. just solid though.","frank4sail","Feb 24, 2004"
3.65,-2.9,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"A turbid and murky looking orange tone. Minimal head, but the bone white collar leaves some sporadic lace along the way. Aroma is pretty earthy and herbal. Some lemon notes highlight. And whiffs of hay enter my senses as well. The flavors are unique. Some lactic sourness compiments biscuit like malt in almost a lambic sort of way. The aftertaste is dry and acidic. The body is almost full and carbonation in the mouth is subdued. If I lived during the times of the Revolution and came across this brew, I'd drink it.","Bighuge","Feb 14, 2004"
3.63,-3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Sits in the glass a chilled hazed peach skin color, thin off-white head faded quickly, some spots and smaller patches of lace stick. Smells of dulled sweet malts giving off a kind of fruitiness of nectarine, red apple, and raisin and very slight caramel. Taste has a very dullish malt profile, slightly chewy, smooth and malted up like crazy, where's the hops? Seems more like all malts to me, but I guess the hops could be adding to some of the dryer dulled citrus tones that are coming through late along with a tiny woodish note in the finish. There's a very tiny spice and floral tone coming through as it warms nearer the finish. Feel is close to medium and quite smooth with a milder tone of malts and just a nudge of carbonation and husk-like texture midway to finish. This was a bit more malts then I like my pales, like em much more hopped up and/or at least balanced evenly between the two, but this was nice enough, reminded me of a Maibock. Thanks to Francisweizen for throwing this in!","tavernjef","Jan 27, 2004"
3.93,4.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,"Pours a ruddy, brownish-amber color with considerable haze and a lot of sediment. The head is large, frothy, and long-lastingleaving large tufts of foam on the side of the glass. Its a much more attractive head than Id expected. Aroma has a wild tartness to it. Its herbal, lemony, spritzy, yeasty, and slightly bread-like. The taste has a refreshing mild acidity and nice maltiness throughout. Finishes on the dry side, with a lingering spiciness. Its remarkably drinkable and all around quite good. I wonder if this actually resembles the brews of colonial and revolutionary times? Fill my blackjack!!","Suds","Beers"
3.95,5.1,3.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Wasn't entirely sure what to expect from this one. Pour was nice, with a very thick head developing quickly and dissapating slowly. Smell was understated, with a bit of citrus (lemon?) notes coming through. The payoff was in the taste. Very meaty for a pale ale. lots of bright notes in the beer, again, a lemon/citrus zing rings through for me. Hops are present, but not overpowering, as is the malt. Very different from what I think of when I think Pale ale. Very easy to drink this one down. It hides the 8% ABV very well. I could easily have several of these over dinner. Very drinkable.","sideshowrob","0"
3.57,-5.1,3.5,4,3.5,4,3,"Deep copper color with minimal head. The aroma is fairly sweet, and hints at familiar bourbon nuances. A bit of smoky oak, a hint of vanilla and carmelized sugar. The taste is rather earthy, with a bit of sweetness and a strong resurgent bitterness on the finish. A slight hint of alcohol is also present on the finish. Lingering woody bitterness on the aftertaste makes me feel like I'm using the old wooden drinking vessels of Colonial America. The mouthfeel is pretty robust, but not overpowering. Drinkability is OK, but the strong earthiness combined with the alcohol drop it down a notch in my book. Nonetheless, a pleasant find, and another creative beer idea brought to you by the folks at Yard's.","aaronh","Dec 31, 2003"
3.98,5.9,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"ales of the revolution. sounds interesting enough. the tavern ale pours with an off-white medium sized head that retains a mild stickiness. the body is orange/amber in colour and looks to be a bit high in the carbonation department. perhaps a nice, crisp pale ale awaits? the smell is somewhat decent here. seems like it's going to be a bit thin in the flavour and body department from smell alone. there are hints of sweetness, earth, wood and malt here. the taste improves upon the smell, though not by much. it is more bitter than the smell would lead to believe and has a nice earth/hop balance to it. still seems watery but less so than the smell led me to believe. the carbonation evened out as well once the beer sat for a while. it actually ended up being rather smooth and easy drinking. this one is not bad, not great, just a decent to good brew. i'm actually hoping for better things from the washington porter, but could easily drink this one again and would not mind it at all for a session brew.","SixpointJMH","Dec 28, 2003"
3.77,0.3,3,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Overall, a very drinkable beer. I'll keep an eye out for this if I'm ever in a bar in Philly.","NJpadreFan","Dec 27, 2003"
4.32,14.9,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"This one pours with a rocky, just off-white head settling (with awesome lacing) over hazy sunset amber liquid. There's apparent fruitiness in the nose, with lightly toasted maltiness sneaking in as well. The taste offers rich mouthfeel with lingering hoppy undercurrents mixed with yeasty fruitiness, malty sugars and a bit of warming alcoholic heft. Finishes toasty fruity and bitter...those Colonial boys sure drank some good ale back in the day.","beerluvr","Dec 15, 2003"
4.1,9,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Another superb offering in the Ales of the Revolution series. A nice pale ale that's more malty than most (were there not hops in Colonial America?), and certainly one that I would have in the future!","beergeek279","Dec 15, 2003"
4,6.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Dark peach with a small white head. The aromas are of fruit, booze, melons, malts, and hops. The taste is of hops, fruit, and booze. The mouthfeel is nice and the finish is warming. The drinkability is very good for this interesting ale as well. This was an interesting beer that I am glad to have gotten the chance to sample. Unfortunately, it was not my favorite beer from Yards, oh well. It's still tasty and very different.","francisweizen","Dec 11, 2003"
3.78,0.5,4.5,4,4,3.5,3,"Appearance: Pours a glowing golden amber with a nice frothy off white cream colored head leaves thick patches of evenly strung lacing. Aroma: Nice floral and herb like hop dosage very nice flow overall with a nice caramel malt backbone supporting sweetness here. Taste: Suprisingly more alcohol than I was expecting with some sweet gingery bread notes and a load of hops crashing down on the palate this isn't half bad. Usually not a big fan of Yard's brews but this one named after ol' Tommy J is a contender. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied ale decent carbonation but for whatever reason it's a bit cloying with some alcohol notes in the end. Drinkability: Decent strong golden ale not a beer that would get me hooked but I'm glad I had the opportunity to give it a try.","WVbeergeek","Jan 14, 2003"
4.17,10.9,3.5,4,4.5,4,4," Smooth and rich with very light carbonation. This one has a lot of body and flavor. The hops and apricots start you off with a somewhat earthy flavor. It slightly reminds me of the hop flavor of a real ale I had on cask (which one, I can not remember). The alcohol produces a little bite, but it is welcomed. It adds a nice warming effect too. Some big spices come in with a piney finish to really give you a kick in the pants. This is a well-made beer. Although the porter could have used a bunch of work, this one is a bit closer to a great beer. I am still curious why this series of beers costs an extra $6 above their normal 6-pack prices. I would just as well stick with their regular line up and Trubbel de Yards.","ElGuapo","Aug 01, 2002"
4.32,14.9,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"The Ben Franklin Special Ale along with the George Washington Porter and the Thomas Jefferson Ale are all from Yards brewing co. and are brewed exclusively for the City Tavern in Olde City in Philadelphia. This beer that is well worth seeking out if your in the area","WilliamPhilaPa","Beers"
4,6.4,4,4,4,4,4,"This beer is only available at The City Tavern in Philadelphia. It was originally brewed by Dock Street to a recipe based on records of what was purchased for the brewing at Monticello. The appearance is crystal clear (unusual for a Yard's product, and I'd guess The City Tavern may be insisting its being filtered as there is no sediment in the bottle) with a very nice, deep orange-copper color showing orange and ruby highlights. The head is off-white, and needs to be coaxed a litttle, but builds a fairly dense 1/4" head. Once thinned, the whispy head lasts fairly well and leaves some Belgian-lace. The nose is mainly fruity with some caramel malt in the background, and some earthy/mineral notes although there are few hops to speak of. The flavor is far more malty than the aroma suggests, but not very complex. However, once coupled with the rich fruity flavors, it's fairly interesting. There's also a fair amount of alcohol involved, but it's well hidden. The taste ends with a gently spicy dryness and hop bitterness that eases away like the setting sun. Similar in many ways to their IPA. Well worth trying. A beer that becons you to keep tasting.","NeroFiddled","0"
