In fact, other than the higher ABV, I'd classify this as a bitter or an English Pale Ale before I'd call it a strong ale. Not good enough to get again (again, not a great smell, just okay in the other categories) but is strangely drinkable. I finished this off rather quickly despite the smell. I found it went quite well with food and maybe that is what makes it drinkable. Good for washing down a meal, not good on its own. So overall average and maybe slightly below average, but strangely drinkable. Go figure.","damndirtyape","Dec 21, 2012"

Aroma is super fruity with layers of baked christmas bread and an oak barrel aged cherry syrup back ground note. Earthy herbal hops seem to blend within the style as well, pretty interesting smelling beer. I like the concept of the label and the idea of a reindeer rebelling against Christmas and Santa's Dominion. Flavor as a whole is pretty nondescript English style without too many bells and whistles. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a slightly syrup like finish, even keeled drinkability not outwardly too flavorful. A nice Christmas beer marketing brew with more commercial dollar incentive than substinence.","WVbeergeek","Mar 21, 2011"

It's not hard to drink, but I can't say I was anticipating my next drink of this either. It's not bad, but there's nothing about it that would make me want to seek it out again. Other than the appearance, it's an average beer. Not worth the price, that's for sure.","bluejacket74","Dec 21, 2007"

3.47,3.3,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a clean orange-ish copper color with a off white head. In the aroma, sweet gingerbread malt, and hops. In the taste, a sweet mellow malt and quite hoppy. A sweet bitterness in the mouthfeel and a dry, small hoppy aftertaste. Kind of feels like a English IPA, nice balance and quite surprised with the hops.","OWSLEY069","Dec 09, 2007"

3.03,-9.8,3.5,3,3,3,3,"Not really impressed with this ale. Although it poured a medium amber and had a fair amout of foam and some lace, it just didn't do anything for me. The smell of mild roasted malts and hops seem to be a little weak. The taste had the flavor of mild roasted malts and hops, but, the bitter flavor was there, then gone. A very short finish, with not a lot of flavor. In fact, the flavor and everything about it was a disapointment. Not to buy again!","BeerManDan","Dec 07, 2007"
3.26,-3,4,3,3.5,3,3,"Bright, clear bronze color with a huge, fluffy white head. OK aroma-slight hop aroma and a touch of toasted malt but not much of anything in general. Sweet malty flavor with a touch of hops. Kind of grainy tasting. Finishes dry. Ok mouthfeel. Not very impressive overall. Very similar to Youngs Winter if you ask me.","lackenhauser","Dec 06, 2007"

3.96,17.9,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,"Poured into an English pint glass a clear full golden with a tight fluggy 1 1/2 finger white head that held good lasting power,a nice looking pour with great clarity and a well defined head.Caramel toffee aromas dominate with a hint of lightly roasted nuts hop presence is slight but it has a nice malt profile.A little thin going down but not overly noticeable,malt driven flavors starting out big and buttery with caramel dominant a firm biscuity base stays through a leafy/minty hop presence is there but it takes a backseat really to the malt.I really like the caramelly,nutty aftertaste.I am a hophead but this beer really wore on me as I drank more mildly sweet with good malt complexity.","oberon","Beers"
4.18,24.4,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Christmas ales typically make me think of spices, heavy ales. Although this beer is a solid, pure English Pale Ale, I was wanting something with more 'Christmas' character. The beer is a lightly colored pale, golden color with creamy head formation, retention, and lacing. Aromas are a solid blend of clean barley malt and fresh hop spiciness. Maltiness is a hearty, bready-sweetness bring on a mild caramel / toffee taste. Hops are pine-ey, grassy, and with a spicy resin note. The balance doesn't prefer either, but round eachother out nicely. Very clean medium texture with a snappy refreshing finish. Good experience, but there is nothing that makes this beer any more Christmas than any other good English Ale.","BEERchitect","0"
3.68,9.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"I'm not sure what an English Xmas Ale is, but this is a nice British bitter that is worth seeking out. It pours a very clean amber with a thick, frothy head, with bubbles, retention, and copious lacing. The smell is sweet malts, some hop bitterness, some vague citrus, but overall rather subtle and insubstantial. The beer is medium bodied, decently carbonated, and starts on the crispy, dry side right after the pour, but tilting towards a more mellow sweetness as thing settle. The taste is a bit tinny as well when it's cold, although this dissipates as things settle down a bit. The beer has nice bready malts, a hop bitterness on the back end, some sweet and floral tones coming through in the middle, and increasing as the beer warms. There is some buttery consistency on the tongue, the aftertaste is mild, yet the beer feels heavier than it is at 6% ABV. Worth seeking out. L'Chaim.","albern","Beers"
3.47,3.3,4.5,2.5,3.5,4,4,"Pours a four finger off-white head that fades slowly to a thin layer leaving some lace. Nice crystal clear amber color. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Not much with the nose maybe faint malts. Flavor is a nice balance of malts and hops without a lot of spices that some Christmas ales have. $5.20 for a 500ml bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma.","jdhilt","0"
