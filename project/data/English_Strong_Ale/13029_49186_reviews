"DARK. Smells maple-y. Taste honey up front and nut as F on the after.  Which is surprising for a dark beer this dark. Bit of a boozy afterbreath. Trails off with a clovy/spicelike taste. Leaves chocolate taste in mouth. Overall pleased. Probably wouldnt buy again. Not because its not good. Just not my cup of meat."
"F - incredibly smooth, easy on the palate"

"Very complex beer with a unique flavor, all notes are potent, they come and go giving space to the next one. Thornbridge is one of my favorite’s breweries and this is an interesting brew to wake up your senses."

"O- There are things I like about this beer but there are almost just as many things that I don't like. Kind of all over the place."

"D - Nice complex and balanced English Strong Ale."
""

"O: Beautifully complex dark ale that benefited from the firkin treatment."
""
""

"Overall, thick, nice, and whiskey-like. It's quite strong, but a good flavor combination."

"Pours a black color. 1/4 inch head of a tan color. Great retention and good lacing. Smells of anise/licorice, sweet malt, dry hop, hint of pale malt, hint of floral hops, alcohol, honey, and tea. Fits the style of an English Strong Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of dry hops, sweet malt, hint of roasted malt, alcohol, honey, hint of hops, and tea. Overall, good appearance, decent aroma, blend, and body."

"Cheers!"

"O: unique, as far as my scant experience - what a dynamic, expertly-rendered ale - wow! - the alcohol is so beautifully woven in - do break the bank on this one, please!"
""
"Overall/Drinkability-Really, really fantastic stuff here, a unique drinking experience; addictively drinkable and keeps you coming back."
"O: I thought this a fantatstic beer - truly unique flavors and a lucious body. Gotta grab one if you spot it. I would shell out the dough to pick up another one if its still on the shelf when I go back."

"Bottle from Lakeview Liquors. A stout and a mead. Black with a bubbly head. New Zealand honey is a noticeably premium honey and here. Lacey. Wickedly Smooth mouthfeel. Chestnuts, a bit intense flavour in the finish. Good drinkability, something unique and special."

"Outstanding and rich without being cloying. Bold flavor and in a different way than other English beers."
"Overall: Bracia is a fantastic beer and easily the most interesting one I have had recently. I would love to see a barrel-aged version (maybe a peated whisky barrel?) in the future. I will be buying a few more of these for the cellar."

"Some misses in the smell is well compensated in the taste."

"Bottle: Poured a dark brown color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and some good lacing. Aroma consists of dry fruits with dry toffee notes are quite unique and quite strong. Taste is a strange mix between some dry toffee notes with caramel malt with some molasses notes with some light fruity ester and some chestnut. Body is quite full with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Very complex beer with maybe a tad too much going on."
"OVERALL: This one was really tough to score. It’s very unique and extremely flavorful, with lots going on and plenty to contemplate, but the aggressiveness does make it somewhat difficult to enjoy an entire half litre yourself. Perhaps this is something better off shared with a buddy. Regardless, this brew has definitely made me interesting in trying more of their stuff. Very impressive. If the opportunity arises, don’t pass this one up. Highly recommended."

"Picked this up at my favorite beer store in Belgium, Dranken Geers. Deep black pour with a gorgeous two finger caramel-colored head with good retention and great lacing. Very unique roasty, nutty, and subtly sweet nose with hints of dark chocolate, espresso, licorice, molasses and peat. The taste is complex and unique. A lot going on that I've never experienced. Lots of roasty espresso and dark chocolate along with hints of dark fruit, specifically black cherries, licorice, peat, tobacco, and hazelnuts. There's something else in there that I just can't put my finger on. Perhaps it's the chestnut honey, which I'm unfamiliar with. The mouthfeel is thick, chewy, and oily with a bittersweet finish. Very smooth and drinkable for a 10% beer. It's a little expensive, but definitely another unique and great offering from Thornbridge!"

"The feeling is not thick like a stout. There is a lot of body in the flavor, but not as much in the feel. There is a light vinous feel to it."
"Overall, a pleasure to sample and I am glad I had the opportunity, but at the price I don't think I will again. However, this is a fantastic beer!"
"D - I've been in a English sort of mood, having had this and Courage RIS on back-to-back days. This doesn't have the brett character of the Courage, but it's got that well-attenuated dryness and quintessential English character to it in spades. Unique and somewhat hard to categorize - more of a smoked beer than a strong ale or stout, but with elements of all of them. I was initially slightly turned off by the aroma, but this grew on me quite a bit over the course of a half-liter (yes, I drank it all by myself). Pricey, challenging, but ultimately rewarding."
"O: This beer is very well balanced and complex even though it is not a full-bodied beer."
""
""
"this is by far one of the most fantastic breweries if come across that consecutively make traditional english beer in poignant and unique form. for anyone hoping for a courage RIS just get this."
""
"O: This is a seriously impressive effort, and quite possibly one of the best stouts I've had in a long time. I love the complex flavors imparted by the heavy hopping and Italian chestnut honey. What's even better is that everything is well-balanced. Unlike many other American double stouts, this one manages to be complex without being over-the-top."
"Overall pretty good, the only issue I see is the peat smoke always gives it a weird flavor, the more beer I have with peat smoke the more I don't like it in beer (and I'm a peat-o-phile when it comes to scotch), but nice flavors otherwise, great dark malts, oats, light nuts and spices, chocolate and roast, the sawdust flavor I think comes from the peat smoke but not sure, which is also not the best flavor, if regular smoked malts instead of peat I think this would be an A."
"The bottles of the original batch are still dry and drinkable. And a splash onto vanilla ice cream is the kind of beer & food pairing that excites my gentleman area."
"Bottle from the free table at Woodshop 5.0. Pours dark brown with a thin tan head. Aroma is licorice, black malts, and an odd note that took me forever to figure out but that I believe is soy sauce (I wrote 'fishy' in my initial notes, but that's not quite it). Flavor is much better, with tons of roast and vivid dark chocolate. Peat is mild, and I don't really get any honey. Caramel and chalk make an appearance. Thick, bitter, and dry."
"Overall - A superb example of an imperial stout... could maybe do with a few more months just to mellow things out a little but definitely recommended..."
"The honey and hazelnuts are obvious in the aroma and flavor. While chocolate roast and cocoa dominate the flavor. Yum Appears pitch black with a milk chocolate head. There's a long, espresso aftertaste. Hot damn, this is good beer. There's a paler malt notes that pop up in the aftertaste, but there's a whole lot of roasted malt going on that dives into roast chestnuts, honey, and spicy British hops. Delicious."
