Caramel malt, dark bread, cherry and plum are all prominent in the flavour profile. I love the overall packaging and complexity of this beer. Once again, Fuller's shows exactly how to craft a multi layered, substantial ale.","Bunman3","Feb 23, 2015"

Nice fluffy head that dissipated slowly and then left a very nice lacing that stuck around as I drank the beer.  Outstanding looking beer, I dare say beautiful.  The smell is not overly strong, there appears to be some caramel with the malt smell, and there seems to be some dark fruit of some sort.  Taste is outstanding but not overly complex.  An easy and very smooth drinking strong ale but lacks wow.  More of a lighter version of strong ales.  The feel is also kinda light, not real creamy or thick, it also leaves you kinda dry which is weird.  Overall an extremely enjoyable beer that I would have anytime.  Don't remember the cost as to whether it was a good value.","JamieDuncan","Jan 09, 2015"

The beer smell has strong bread notes and nice toasted malt notes as well as a light and bitter hop note that is concealed under the other notes. The beer taste is phenomenal. The bitter hop notes are stronger than in the smell and works very well to balance out the same toasted notes present in the smell. However, the malted notes are a bit weaker and not as diverse. The malt notes have a slight caramel note and a lightly toasted bread taste. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and smooth with a very light carbonation despite the vigorous head. Overall, a fantastic beer and nice to sit down with after a tough day at work.","HattedClassic","Nov 08, 2014"

Poured into an old school English pint glass, this venerable and potent ale is a reddish amber hue with a nice solid tan head that reminds one of lighter-colored sponge toffee. My wife wondered "what was wrong with it". Haha! Aroma is expectedly rich and malty, with some spicy esters and tangy Goldings hops combining to evoke rich fruitcake and dried apricots. Palate is correspondingly rich and complex, with a gorgeous honeyed malt flavor and a rather light body. Does coat the mouth and the earthy, woody finish lingers for quite a while. Some shortbread, sponge toffee, treacle, and tree nuts (pecans?) provide the sweet, dark backdrop but there is also a bright, almost sour fruitiness like cranberries and even a whiff of smoke. The alcohol is well-concealed but it does peek through to add yet another layer of complexity. Certainly reminds one of its big brother Fuller's Vintage, albeit brighter, fruitier, and maybe less multifactorial ... Still, why compare? This one stands on its own considerable merits.","CalgaryFMC","Jan 12, 2014"

Aromas of big raisin, fig, caramel, toast, toffee, molasses, chocolate, brown bread, light roast, light nuttiness, floral, and toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of malt and fruity notes; with good strength. Taste of big raisin, prune, pear, molasses, toast, caramel, toffee, chocolate, light roast, brown bread, light nuttiness, herbal spiciness, and toasted earthiness. Fair amount of earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark fruit, molasses, toast, caramel, toffee, chocolate, brown bread, light roast, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic complexity and balance of fruity and malt flavors; with big robustness and no cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied; with a very creamy and moderately slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent English strong ale! Big complexity and balance of robust malt and fruity flavors; and very smooth to drink. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jul 16, 2013"

The taste is good, with a complex banquet of slightly roasted malts, dark fruits, chocolate, spices, toffee and cream that comes just as fast as it goes, leaving just the slightest hint of roast, fruit and creaminess on the tongue. The mouthfeel is fairly prickly for the style at first, but is strongly drying. Overall, it's a very good English ale that's a bit more aggressive than I expected.

Darker breadiness as well, with a note of grain in the finish. Body is medium with some definite thickness to it, and is fairly smooth in texture; low carbonation aids this mouthfeel substantially.

Lightly carbed and great, smooth cask-like mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very tasty, lighter malt-forward ale.

Tastes slightly bitter on the back of the tongue with herbal hops, lots of sweet, slightly fruity malt flavors emerge, there are hints of plum and alcohol with a bitter finish.

Flavour is the same but much more intense and well balanced with a nice crisp bitterness that finishes the mouthfeel cleanly. There is a whole raft of caramel, malt, golden syrup and some florally notes. At 6.3% ABV there might be a slight tendency to booziness but the whole flavour presence rounds out the experience nicely. This is a great beer but I think only in small doses. One pint at a time is probably enough.","rjimlad","Jul 24, 2011"

Rich malt, some caramel, a little date and prune. A surprisingly sharp bitterness assaults me, cuts the malt down to size. The warming of this beer has left a peculiar feeling in me of desire. There is a bit of earth and spice in the hops there, the sweet malt begins to backseat. An impressive beverage. The nose had me convinced I was in for something very different.

This beer is the epitome of what in my opinion is an English Strong Ale; that mysterious mixture of session ale and barley wine, being both full-flavored and complex, yet highly drinkable and "easy in the glass". What a fine line to walk, and one that is seldom trodden with such finesse and flair, either by brewers in the US or the UK. Fullers very well might be the best traditional brewer of English ales in the entire UK, and possibly the world.","allforbetterbeer","Apr 11, 2011"

Moderate fruitcake and caramel aroma on a hoppy background. The flavour is malty with some spices and decent hops, but not VERY complex. The ABV is evident, but alcohol does not dominate the flavour. Hoppy bitterness in the aftertaste. A decent beer, but not the best I've had.","Sigmund","Feb 14, 2011"

4.03,-1.9,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Beautiful clear ruby-mahogany pour with two finger off-white head and nice lacing. The nose is dominated by the biscuity, bready malt. Lots of caramel and toffee with hints of dark fruit. The taste is toasty and malty, with a nice slightly spicy and bitter hop bite to balance out the sweetness. Hints of dark fruit and tea round it out nicely. This thing really opens up as it warms. Silky smooth and ever so slightly thick and chewy at the same time. It's only 6.3 ABV, but it somehow seems stronger, especially when it comes to temperature. The alcohol isn't overpowering, but sneaky, since it's such a drinkable beer. Another great beer from one of my favorite British breweries!","beerdrifter","Feb 06, 2011"

Bronzed orange to brown color, good clarity without sacrificing depth of hue, only a few tiny bubble beads which come and go. Boozy nose, vanillin whiskey notes, butterscotch and freshly whipped butter, stronger hoppy grain and hay notes, date, dried pineapple and apricot fruit, the maltiness has more edge than you might expect, lots of push, even if in the face of a lack of scent diversity. Medium-bodied, the carbonation is tightly woven and contributes to a firmer mouth feel. Still has that whiskey barrel touch, just without any vanillin creaminess. Fig, date, raisin flavors, simply without deep sweetness, the same for the candied red cherry and more basic apricot fruit. The orange citrus joined by tarter white grapefruit and a little lemon. Smoky, burnt kindling ash accents. The general bitterness more in place here, pushes the molasses and maple syrup off to the side but not off the map. Kind of an "intellectual challenge" sort of brew, not so much immediate, visceral pleasure but each sip keeps you focused on it.","farrago","Oct 07, 2010"

First thing, its a heavy, big bodied beer and it leads off with sweetness, some alcohol, mild overall, and some caramel. Its a lot of malt. There is a mild bitterness, probably about 30 IBUs that lingers at the back of the mouth. The finish is nice, not too dry, just dry enough for this kind of beer. There is no aftertaste. Its a decent beer overall but its kind of like a weak barleywine. I'm going to try the Yorkshire Sligo next to compare the two.","drabmuh","Sep 18, 2010"
3.93,-4.4,3.5,3,4.5,4,4,"Appearance and aroma were disappointing but misleading versus the taste which was pleasantly good. A little on the sweet side but very easy to drink. Almost like a liquid beer version of fruit bread w/molasses. I dunno if it was because of the age, but it wasn't for the tired aroma, this would've rated a bit higher. This is quite good and I'd definitely drink it again. Would be interested to try it in London at the source!","milkbaby9","Sep 09, 2010"
4.13,0.5,4.5,4,4.5,3,4,"Pours a hazy brown with a beautifully frumpy tan head. Interesting nose. Aromas are highly malty, with biscuity and toasty notes leading the way, along with a lot of earthiness and faint brown sugar notes. Each of these elements come through on the taste, except that the brown sugar is more accentuated and the bitterness is sharper and woodier and more herbacious than the nose would suggest. The body is too light and overcarbonated for my liking in a beer of this complexity. A pity, because it is otherwise nearly perfect.","droomyster","Aug 25, 2010"

The first flavor is a sweet and moderate hop that's swarmed underneath by a complex and refined malt that's straightforward in presentation but complex upon further reflection.

Maybe some more fruit in there too and slight hops. Has a very solid ale flavor, tasty. Mouthfeel is medium and good carbonation, a very smooth ale.

The flavors are very fused. There's a touch of roast and a lot of malt that's not really sweet nor dry. Dried fruit, like prune, is apparent.

Crisp hops break into the palate first, delivering a quick citrus bite that's followed by sweet notes of marmalade jam, fig, raisin rum, and a backbone of caramel malts. The maltiness takes on somewhat of a roasted character near the finish, adding a tinge of bitterness that mingles with the hops. Subtle hints of shoe polish and whiskey-like booze linger after the sip. Carbonation is sharp and creamy at the same time, adding some pep to the middle of the medium body. Good lord, the complexity is off the charts with this beer...so much to think about, but at the same time if you turn off the "Beer Geek" mindset and just enjoy it, it's one hell of a tasty, well-crafted beer.

I really should have let it warm more before uncapping it, but I just bought it from the grocery store where it was chilled and I'm saving the ESB for tomorrow or the next day. I'll sip it slowly. The smell is sweet caramel malt with hops that are very close to just how I picture English hops, refined and bitter. The flavor really brings out a delicious balance of flavors. It's a strong bitter, almost like a weak Old Ale. Lots of big malt notes dominate the palate but the whole package is well-balanced. After so many recent West Coast beers, this beer is like a breath of fresh air or, rather, malt. The feel is sudsy and just a tad watery as I feel are many of the larger production English bitters, although that's all I've really had not that I wouldn't mind a microbrewed cask conditioned bitter if someone is offering to fly me overseas.","popery","Dec 13, 2008"

Caramel, dark fruit, some chocolate. Some crisp hops in the finish. But at times it seemed harsh. Mouthfeel was ok as well as the drinkability. I really wanted to like this beer, because at times it was excellent, challenging and flavorful, but something in the flavor at times that didn't hit me right. I will give this another try because of the notes that I liked in it. This beer left me with more questions than answers.","nickynick","Sep 03, 2008"

Not like other Fuller's stronger brews which all have stronger fruity and hoppy presence, this one is predominantly a malty brew but still full of complexities when appreciated quietly. The cask-version which I tried a year ago at a Fuller's pub on Fleet St., London, "The Old Bank of England", told a different story--with more fruit presence and more soul-lifting in terms of body. Can't explain why but I like them equally.","wl0307","Aug 25, 2008"

This beer pours a dishwater brown color with a surprisingly large beige head that leaves ample lacing down the entirety of the glass. The aroma is far more citrus then I would have expected. While I have had this beer before this is the first time I remember getting this much lemon out of the nose. Toffee, chocolate and roasted malts also come through. The taste is bready off the bat with hints of chocolate and dark fruits. The tail of the beer is a bit astringent (reminds me of the smell of lemon sent Pine-Sol) which throws off the balance. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a light carbonation. If it weren't for the astringency in the tail of the beer, this beer would have received high marks.","hwwty4","Aug 21, 2008"

3.76,-8.5,4,3,4,4,4,"This is a very nice strong, British bitter. It pours a deep mahogany with plenty of head, lacing, and retention. The smell is muted, but what you do get is fruity esters, candy like aroma, toasted malts, and a barley wine style syrupy sweetness. The smell is more subtle than pronounced, and I believe it creeps out more as the beer settles and warms. The taste is quite dry and bitter, with hints of chocolate, bready malts, tart dates/raisins, and lots of background hops. The tartness and bitterness is not your typical burnt caramel variety, and for that, I am very pleased. This is more your medium bodied, slightly carbonated, dry, creamy, dark chocolate variety of bitterness and it is very pleasant. The aftertaste is quite noticeable and the alcohol is masked very well. The beer does not have even that warming alcohol note to it because it doesn't have to. I was surprised at the 6.3 ABV, thinking it was quite a bit lower. This is a very good British strong ale if you are in the mood for such and have an appreciation for the style.

Then, a toasty flavor, with a nice bitterness to match. Carbonation is a little high for the style, but if you let it sit out for awhile it gets to authentic British levels. It's a shame that Fullers doesn't bottle condition all their beers like this, as the yeast adds a great flavor. Simply fantastic. One of my favorite beers of all time.","tronester","Oct 06, 2007"

The nice orangy brown body is topped with a lovely but not too long lasting foamy head. The scent is minimal and probably its weakest point. Good mix of hops bittering and flavorful maltiness. The flavor bounces from a sweet honey taste to a burnt smokiness. The aftertaste is a little pasty on the tongue leaving a cotton mouth.

The beer itself is a just hazy copper red with minimal carbonation...my god, the head on this thing is out of control; I've been pouring a bit here and there over the past few minutes, but the head just continues to grow. I've now got what looks from afar like a scoop of ice cream floating on top of a red beer! I don't know if this is good or bad, but it looks pretty cool! Aromas are very subtle, with honeydew, kiwi, pressed cider, and a clover honey note. Floral. Not what I expected for this style, but nice all the same. Fruit-inflected bready malt flavors throughout the front, with a slight fusel alcohol presence just after the middle. Closed out by a lemon pepper spiciness. Honeyed summer fruits and a pervasive but unobtrusive mineral twang. Feels slightly heavy on the palate, but is more than anything medium-bodied. Dull zinginess, juicy pucker, and a dry finish. Some caramel flavors int he aftertaste. Quite a complex yet understated beer! Nothing I'd crave very regularly, but a wholly unique experience nonetheless.

Taste, however, is boldly malty, balanced with earthy hops, and heavy on the bredy / yeastiness.

It doesn't have the delicate malt-hop blend you get out of American pale ales and IPAs (yes, I mean delicate in the sense that you get a soft maltiness under the hops; the maltiness in this one is more caramelly, burnt toffee-like, and the hops are not floral, they are more aggressive than that).

So many tastes, sweet malt and heavy hops with wood and bread! I don't really understand how those chemicals like phenols and diacytal and ester taste, but I think these are probably in here, because there are a lot of flavors that I can acount for, that show up in just about every English Ale I taste. The color is almost like some one took ale and poured either blood or transmition fluid in it. Definitely complex, as with most english ales I've tasted, it gets smoother as it warms up. I wouldn't really drink alot of these the way I would other beers, oh wait, yes I would. I can imagine most people drinking this to inebreation.

The color goes along with the substantial nature of the beer itself, making it a good representation. It smells of malt and fruit, with a slight caramel aroma to boot. Not a terribly strong smelling beer, but pleasant none the less. Tastes bold, with a deep and malty flavor, distinguished by more than hints of caramel. A slightly bitter aftertaste is completed by a chocolate-type finish. Very flavorful!! Mouthfeel is thick and sweet, with a good deal of carbonation. Overall this is a good and tasty beer.

Some caramels, and fruit with a nice roastiness that gives way to the taste of English water and the carbonation dissipating on the tongue and then the bitterness of the hops at the end that soothe the tongue instead of agressively attacking it like American hops do. Some lingering (and faint) roastiness/hoppiness leave the mouth happy at the aftertaste. I think the water used contributes to this almost metallic mouthfeel that is typical of English ale.

It is very pleasant and may actually have a nicer mouthfeel too but taste and smellwise I give the nod to Smutty. Maybe its just that much fresher but you can definitely taste the higher abv in this one too.

Aromas are quite malty giving off some plummy dark fruit tones, along with some caramel and biscuity malts. Initial flavors start off decently sweet with some dark fruity notes giving off flavors of plums, figs, and slight grape. The body of this brew is quite full, and very malty. There are additional tones of of a slight roasty chocolate flavor, but they are quickly consumed by more fruity tones and just a hint of sweetness. The finish is just slightly hoppy and balances the flavor of this brew nicely. Overall a great beer full of flavors that just balance out nicely. A must try..","bigbeerdrinka","Dec 18, 2004"

Surprisingly has a moderate acid bite that hurts a bit the roundness and development of the deep malt flavors. Slight smoke in the finish. Medium to full bodied, low carbonation.

Bitter, bitter and exotically nuanced with Asian incense, buttered, charred pastries, fruit preserves and shoe leather. Quite tannic and boozy, the save comes from the generously gassy, beaten cream texture.

Theres a lot of berries and and none of the toffee found in the nose. There a very weak hop profile, literally just a little bit of bitterness (apparently its brewed with only Goldings).

3.68,-10.5,4,3.5,4,4,3,"1845 is light cherry coloured in the glass, rosewood, dark honey amber, pouring with just enough head, which is thick and spiderweb-like but recedes rather quickly, leaving entrails of off-white lace, some of it clinging to the glass for good. Sweet, lightly scented malt in the aroma at first, buttery and lightly roasted. Spicy and biscuity, with definite butterscotch notes. I was expecting a little more complexity in the aroma, though there is very little to complain about. The taste is the same sweet roasted malt with butter and cream, followed by strong hop bitterness on the finish. In between are some subtle fruits, yeasty esters, and the warming phenolic presence. Burnt cereal and caramel. Adequate carbonation, and smooth substantial feel in the mouth. For some reason I am finding the robust bitterness a bit much this night, limiting its drinkability for me personally. Not my favourite of Fuller's, but still so much better than a great deal of other ales; Fuller's never disappoints me.","Cwrw","Aug 13, 2004"

Taste is extremely different from most beers Ive tried. The hop profile is there, and quite distinct, but so unusual I have a hard time putting my tongue on it. At first I was so shocked by the taste that I was ready to criticize. But nearing the end of my bomber, Ive found that I cant get enough of it. Its wild  exactly like my experience learning to love IPAs! Mouthwatering and full of that unique hop profile, from first sip until the aftertaste 20 seconds later.

Dense yellow-white bubbles surge and froth, pillowing into a crowning mesa. Rather auburn in color; when held to light shimmers an electric bronze and metallic apricot, with streamers everywhere racing to the lip of the glass. Stunning! Smells of a tropical marmalade of sweetnesses: mango and papaya when cool; shifting to cantaloupe with warmth. A tad of biscuity maltiness. Beneath this, an underlayer of grass and loam, as if inhaling a meadow. Nosefeel is ambrosial, wafting. Biscuit is more pronounced in the flavor up front, followed by an affirmative, citric and grassy bitterness. Gets quite yeasty in the midpalate, with the flavor of rising dough displacing an initial light fruitiness (apricot). Finishes with a pointed, earthy bitterness with suggestions of mint. Mouthfeel is slightly plain in body with a ticklish carbonation; finishes dry and resiny. And the drinkability? After a few initial sips, I went straight into quaffing. Oh for another bottle...","NearerMyBeerToMe","Feb 08, 2004"

It's not so much balanced as artfully blended, a testament to craftmanship, and the simple combination makes it very drinkable and enjoyable. It has just enough going on to intrigue, but not so much that it ever overwhelms.

Mouthfeel is also a bit dry, though it remains rather soft with a hint of acidity. Has that full, robust English ale flavor character...rich and malty with hints of caramel and just a touch of alcohol in the finish. Bitterness is quite present but is tamed by the massive toasted malt character. I would love to have this with some roasted chicken. To me this would pair so well with a variety of foods.

Taste had a more smokey, metallic taste with grainier malts and just a touch of hops and a warming alcohol presence as the liquid moved down my throat and a bready full aftertaste.

The finish contains a small dose of hops and alcohol. The mouthfeel is fairly nice and strong. The drinkability is also fairly nice. Not a bad brew from Fuller's.","SheepNutz","Aug 13, 2003"

Because of the bitterness, I gave it a low drinkability score.","Indybeer","Aug 11, 2003"

The nose is a treat for the senses: treacle, caramel, spice, with a muted hop tone set amongst a firm malty base. The taste was firstly straight up hops! Followed by bittersweet/salty toasty malt flavors mixing with a nice low-key alcohol note. Finishes long and bitter and very complex. Superb!","beerluvr","Jul 24, 2003"

It had many complex flavors of spiced rum cake and prunes. It has a nice hop presence that comes out in the finish. This beer has a tremendous body and mouthfeel that really lives up to a strong ale. I didn't know by the taste this was a strong ale cause the alchohol is warming but not that detectable due to the overall complexity and richness of this beer.

Lovely nose, caramel with hints of butterscotch & toffee, a suggestion of fig with fruitiness throughout. As for the palate; caramel malts upfront with chocolate malts that complement, a royal combination. Sort of an earthy consistency as well then, just too add complexity, delicate hops bitterness balances a faint sweetness. The mouthfeel has tremendous texture (which only adds to the enjoyment), slightly bitter finish with an organic yet caramely aftertaste. For the style the body is lightish (not thin). This only adds to the drinkability. This is an excellent brew and I highly recommend it.","bditty187","Feb 18, 2003"

It is a bitter beer and can be rough on the palate depending on what you have before it. I recommend avoiding sweet stuff before this one.

The woody and earthy hop flavor complements the fruitiness well.  Moderately bodied, w/ smooth mouthfeel conducive to high drinkability.  Caramel and biscuit malt become more pronounced as the beer breathes and warms.  Finishes w/ bittersweet fruit and hop bitterness pleasantly lingering.

Where the ESB hits you with it's full chewy maltiness, the maltiness in this beer is more subdued and you're actually slammed by the bitterness the first couple of sips. As you get used to the bitterness, you'll start to notice the sweet maltiness (although this is still more subdued than in the ESB) A little later especially after the beer warms up, you'll start to notice some toffee notes starting to mix with the maltiness and slightly citric bitterness.
