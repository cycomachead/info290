"An interesting and overall very enjoyable strong ale. There is a slight hint of tannins and phenolics in the flavor although it doesn't detract from things. Very much a dark malt and alcohol focused beer without any heavy-handed residual sugars or excessive booziness. The body is a little bit on the weak side but shouldn't matter to most folks as the appeal to the other senses is solid."

"Not a bad beer, but not quite as good as I hoped it would be. I could try aging the booziness out of this beer, but don't see the point. I'm confident there are superior offerings out there."

"Enjoyable strong ale that does not hide its alcohol"

"Way better than Chocolate Old Tom."

"Excellent ale – I could drink this all day if it had a better price point. Oh well; champagne tastes and a beer budget!"

"Overall: This beer came right out of nowhere and made my night. It is always a relief to find good beers in Okinawa, this being a classic no less."

"Overall 4.25: Excellent beer. Big, balanced and no hint at all of its 8%+ ABV. Smooth, delicious and just an excellent ale, this baby may very well be the best of its kind in the world. It really reminds me of a Scottish ale, what with its deep malt obsession, but it does have the English interest in hops about it as well. This beer was a revelation to me, certainly one I had not heard of before, but certainly one I will buy again, this time in bulk. Highly recommended."

"O: fan-damn-tastic!... is this what a latter-day Burton Ale tasted like? I've found few British imports here in the States that have tasted quite like this... can't help but pick up another bottle"
"all old ale should taste like this. old tom is a classic, a genuine no frills english ale of the highest class. underrated as they get, this is everything we think about when we envision old world english evenings turning into late nights, and as claystation phrased it so eloquently, one sip and you expect to be visited by the ghosts of christmas past present and future all at once. its got just enough dark malt roast without being bitter like darker ales, rich enough, without being sweet at all, even dry in fact, and hefty while still being sturdy yet sessionable. its winter beer for me i think, but its not that confined. the combination of grain and yeast in this is impressive, i dont wish for anything else. a great balance between dark and light as well as strong and approachable are on display here. one of the more enjoyable beers on the market at about five bucks a bottle, it is an overwhelming success and a fantastic example of what true english old ale should taste like and feel like. a blue collar treat."

"Overall- Above average to good beer. Seems fairly true to a style that I don't have much experience with. I'll have to track down a Bracia to get a firmer idea of the English Strong Ale. Definitely worth a shot as I can see this beer having fans."

"O - 3.75 - This is a good old ale, but not the best by far. The American made ones are more smooth w less booze taste - like Bell's Third Coast Old Ale and Double DBA."
"Overall: watch out. This has an unpleasant heat to the booziness on the back that's not matched by enough flavour to give it structure or purpose. By the end, I felt a little bit battered."
""
"this is so good, so malty, cool, calm, and utterly lovely. My goodness. I like this more and more, as I drink it down. I'm practically in love with it, ...mmmm."
""
"O: A well done, oddly likeable beer. Definitely tasty and drinkable."
""
""
"Pours an almost opaque super brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, caramel, molasses, and slight dark fruit aromas. Taste is much the same with dark fruit, toffee, and alcohol flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is slightly strong and boozy."

"Drank from a snifter."

"An average beer if truth be told, I did enjoy it but they alcohol was a little strong and although pleasant the sweetness and fruity flavours did little to mask it. The beer is a strong and boozy one that leaves you with a warming alcohol taste to it and it was easy enough to drink despite the alcohol."

"Overall, I think this beer is pretty incredible! If it is not world class, it has to be close. I do find it a touch on the sweet side and a little bit high on the alcohol, but that is part of the story of this beer. It is an attractive looking, smelling and tasting beer that is not hoppy and I am going to give it a solid 4 out of 5! Well done! I will seek this beer out and recommend it to others!"
"Rich, deep garnet color. Not much carbonation but a nice, slim tan head on top. Ok aroma-very malty and bready. Some dried fruit and a trace of alcohol. Big malty flavor. Plums and currants. Malty sweetness. Burnt treacle. Mild booziness. Nice sticky mouthfeel. Quite full. Damn fine UK strong all. Nicely priced as well. Will definately get this again. Bet it is lovely on draft."
"O: I like it, but man it could be so much better. I wish it just had a little more malt to even out the alcohol content. enjoyable though...and I'm certainly saving the bottle."
"Port-like in so many ways. Overall, a very rewarding bottle, as it should be for the $6.00 price tag. A once a year treat for me."
""
"D= Super high drinkability on this one. I find this to be an exceedingly enjoyable English old ale / winter warmer, and the drinkability combined with the hidden alcohol make this one deliciously dangerous!"

"A good beer, but too alcoholic to be a very good one. Drink ability very much down by end."
"Not really what I'm looking for in a strong ale -- I usually like something maltier, smoother, rounder, sweeter. This one is more mineral/alcohol/dry."
"Haven't had a good ol'-fashioned British old ale in a while, so let's see how this one stacks up. It pours a deep garnet-brown topped by a finger of tan foam. The nose comprises molasses, black pepper, dark red wine grapes, light oak, and a pinch of clove. The taste brings in more of the same, along with a hint of tobacco and some extra pepper for the sake of it. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, a very nice old ale, one certainly worth re-visiting on a number of future occasions."
"Taste is light and lively in body and feel, dark brandied fruits, brandyish toasted-spicy dryish finish with bitter wood. It has a lot of brandied cherries throughout, with spicy-peppery-woody qualities, zesty, engaging."
"Old Tom is a reddish brown ale with a soft, dense, khaki head that has nice retention and lacing. It has a sweet, malty aroma with a healthy dose of chocolate. It smells a bit like wet stone. It's medium bodied and quite smooth with a dry finish. There's lots of chocolate in the taste-- not dark chocolate-- milk chocolate. Besides that, there's a little grassy bitterness. There's kind of a malt extract flavor. It's a bit sweet and the sweetness lingers. The chocolate seems a little out of place with the base beer, but I'll always take chocolate in beer."
""
"Pours a murky, even, chocolate brown with little head and almost no lace, Nose is fruity with grapeskin and plums and your basic malt notes. Understated but just about right. Taste is mellow and hides 8.5% like a magician. I do taste the pepper mentioned on the label briefly but the flavors generally blend together. Carbonation is blessedly light. English hops (Goldings?) show up in the finish and aftertaste, bit only in a supporting role. Love the balance throughout. The goal isn't to amp up or overwhelm, but to satisfy. Not everyone loves traditional English Ale, even in England, but this is excellent English ale."

"Strong B+, possibly pushing A- territory"

"Poured into a Black Raven pint glass. Pours a dark clear red amber. Nice two finger light brown head with good retention and lacing. Intriguing aroma of dark malt and fruit. Flavor supports the aroma, sweet malt, dark fruit, distinct molasses, hints of cherry. Complex and fun to drink. Finish rather abrupt, leaving memories of faint dark malts and light hops; somewhat watery in the finish, unlike the main body of the flavor. Slightly oxidized flavors. Medium bodied, approaching, but not quite reaching creaminess. I like a beer that appears interesting and then surprises with an unusual flavor profile and this does both. Nice ale that I will return to. I also enjoyed the chocolate and ginger versions."
"Overall I found this to be an enjoyable, well-balanced ale, although a bit expensive."
"O: This is a great English beer, the dryness makes it really dangerously drinkable. A modern classic as I've read and heard about this beer from the late legendary Michael Jackson, but never had a chance to try it, glad I came upon it today."
""
"O: Although this is a nice beer to sip, it’s quite drinkable because the alcohol is well hidden from the taste and it isn’t heavy on the palate."
"The beer is full-bodied. It has a rich malt flavor that cuts through with some nice fruit flavors and a bit of metallic flavor."
"A boozy one for sure, but with the complexity of flavor, it really comes off as some sort of delicious malt liqueur. Could use a little more fruitiness on the palate, but the nose is stellar."
"O - A good ale, but World best as the CAMRA claims???"
"I liked this, but could have liked it more. Needs some lingering flavors, even though the complexity is there. Flawed but good, and worth trying."
""
"O: Interesting, different. Definitely try it, it's good but I'm not in love."
"Disappointed by this. Excessive booze rawness that pretty well fails to integrate with the rich malt and dark fruit character. Similar to, but a pallid imitation of a decent Scotch or Old Ale."
"O: A nice Barleywine that probably will evolve nicely in my beercellar - lucky me, who bought a whole case..."
"Pours a dark thick kola hue with a two finger creamy coffee laced head that stays and leaves heaps of clingy lacing everywhere,the smell is chocolate,coffee,barley,dark fruits and a touch of brown sugar,the mouthfeel is thick and creamy with tastes of dark berries,mocha,dark malts,herbal hops and a touch of dark port on the finish and overall i think this is categorized wrong as its definately not a English barleywine but it is a very nice Old Ale cheers."
"Think Charlie Sheen would like this."
"Having said that, it's not a great example of the style. This one had a year or two to mellow and is still harsh which, combined with a lacking body, undermines any flavors here. Closer to Old Peculier than Ola Dubh."
"After the beer warmed up the coffeesmell of roasted malts came in my nose. Pleasant smell and good taste. This was a surprise for me!"
"A rather accessible barley wine."
"This is certainly not worth considering as a Barleywine; it lacks both the potency and depth in the mouth to be. However, as a soothing and just delicious Old Ale, I think it sets the standard. Smooth and lush malts meet sticky fruits and wide custard flavors in a harmonious and masterfully crafted beer. Awesome."
"D. Strong English barleywine who's alcoholic warmth soothes the chest. A lovely sipping ale to have at hand. A good nightcap."
"D-Supremely enjoyable on it's own account, could potentially be even better with so mild cheeses or some savory fruits."
"Served from a 330ml bottle."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low to medium carbonation. A pretty solid English barleywine, I like it. Thanks Rob!"
"Pours a rich russet colour with an off-white head that soon dropped to a collar. Nice sweet aroma with strong notes of raisins, alcohol soaked dark fruit and sherry. The flavour follows up with the same elements, but has the added bonus of some decent hopping, and a nice combination of flavours. In a way it felt like a cross between a barleywine and a pale ale. Medium body and carbonation. I thought this was quite well done. While not as rich and heavy as some of the others we had, I think this may well have been one of the most drinkable bottles we popped, which surprised me after the disappointing Chocolate Tom."
"D: A decent drinker."
"Overall, I found this an excellent beer. It was to me a Belgian strong ale, reminding me of Goudon Carolus or even Chimay Blue or Unibroue's Maudite. It was not quite at the level of the three I mention, but a very drinkable strong ale."
"Mouthfeel is refreshing and creamy. I could have it again but I am disappointed since this should be labelled a stron Barley Porter so you would know what to expect"
"Despite the relatively high ABV, this is a much more drinkable ale than other barleywines I've tried. There isn't the strong taste of alcohol like there is with some other strong ales. The smaller size bottle makes it easier as well. Very interesting indeed."
"M&D - Medium Carbonation, and a bit harsh going down. Would have loved it to be a bit smoother and easier drinking, but, HEY! this is a barley wine. So I should stop my Whining."
"A good example of this style, but not really a style of beer I like. The treacle taste is a bit too dominant for my liking and it is a touch on the sweet side. But, it does look lovely and the smell is quite intriguing."
"Surprisingly excellent head, sandy white, airy and smooth with great retention. Body is thick coffee brown with sparks of bright red-orange. Lovely nose with plenty of caramel, chocolate, raisins, and vinous dark fruits, plus a honey-biscuit note reminiscent of graham crackers. Flavor is big on prunes, black tea, caramel, and dark rum, although the alcohol is well-integrated - not exactly hidden, spicy but not too hot or medicinal. Cola and oaky red wine round out the flavor. The mouthfeel is a nice balancing act; it's medium-bodied, lush but also quite dry. It could be richer, but that might make this too sweet. Overall this is very nice, almost Belgian in character - fruity, spice, drinkable and complex."
"This beer falls into the category of brews that I'd wanted to try for a very long time. I'd read about the beer years ago, but never found a bottle until coming across it in a great beer shop in Italy. The beer pours a dark chestnut color with a firm and soapy head. The foam is densely packed and a chocolate-tan color with lots of staying-power. The aroma is solidly good, vinous, with plenty of oak and malt. There's also a touch of vanilla, caramel, and booze-infused dark fruit. The taste is complex and mildly sweet. Balance, drinkability, and subtle flavor nuances are the key to this beer. It's quintessentially English in style, not the in-your-face American strong ale. This suits the beer perfectly. Smooth and complex, the beer is a real joy. The carbonation was a little more pronounced than expected, but it fit nicely with the brew. Very enjoyable."
"330 ml bottle, bought in Scarborough. Mahogany coloured beer, large and lasting tan head. Malty sweet aroma, notes of port wine, oak and bakery. Excellent mouthfeel, full and rich. Flavour of generous malts, caramel, dried dark fruits, moderate but noticeable hops (Goldings and Northdown), port wine finish. Fairly sweet, but not cloying. A true classic!"
"Overall - A complex and rich brew, hardly any sweetness left on the lips but oodles of character and flavour. An excellent beer that I shall be buying again!"
"D - A good offering. Lack of alcohol bite aids overall drinkability."
"a bit hard to finish. Too sweet for me."
"A very good beer. By far the best beer I have had from the Robinson brewery."
"Would recommend this as a barley wine for those who have not tried the style."
"Presented to the 2007 BJCP class in St. Louis, MO. Thanks for sharing your beer knowledge."
"Good nightcup."
"D- Its an ok barley wine, but i would take a harviestoun old engine oil over this any day. Its just too thin for my tastes. Actually reminds me of a poor doppelbock"
"Other comments: This sample was nearly a year old. Still seems quite fresh and hasn't changed much from the first review. I'll have to let the third bottle sit until beyond the best-by date (Jun 2007) to possibly see some more drastic changes."
"D: compared with my previous note of this beer on draught, it seems that the bottled version shows less alcoholic warmth and also less explicit fruity elements but better-balanced... Slightly lighter-bodied than expected, this beer just punches above its weight and makes a really smooth yet complex digestive instead of a glass of port to round off my X'mas celebration~~ Wonder how it'd taste if bottle-conditioned?"
"Overall - A pretty good beer.... Worth a try... Not quite as good as i was expecting though...."
"Old Tom is not a good barleywine, no matter its country of origin. It may have originated from a hand-written recipe from 1899, but this is one instance where historical accuracy should take a backseat to common sense. This kitty could stand to replace a large portion of its soft purr with a snarling lion's roar."
"A pretty brown beer with a nice head, but alas nut much going on below the surface. Very smooth and somewhat malty, this beer is too subdued in the flavour profile to being highly regarded. I sensed the quality but could not really grasp the nuances as they were too far down in the mix."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"This was a good beer up until the point that I took a drink."
"Thanks to tavernjef for mail this one to me, I'm glad I got the chance to taste this one for myself."
"A fine ale for those grim, cold winter nights."
"This beer is hard to choke down after half a bottle. I thought I'd give it a try and that's all it gets."
"A nice strong ale, i was happy to find this on cask, its hard to believe that this is from the same people who brought us double maxim brown ale :S"
"Couldn't pass this up at only $1.99 a bottle. Strange cat on label and what appears to be a reference to Capital Brewery on the neck label. The appearance was pretty weak with a resemblence to flat pepsi. The aroma is pretty malty with chocolate and sugar undertones. Pretty uneventful for a barleywine as far as taste goes. Not as explosive as I hope barleywines are. Decent for a one-time tasting, but not impressive!"
"alright, i dont know what the deal with this beer is, but i was completely not impressed. This beer had a skunkish, kind of rotten smell. It poured a really dark amber color. Small head was present. The taste is all malts. Not enough hop balance, I even like my barley wines to be more on the malty side, but this is just too one sided. Not recommended."
"Big malty caramel head. Dark dried fruit, leather and burnt oranges. Bitterness, though not present on the initial palate, shows well on the after taste. This lacks the depth of malt flavor that Old Nick has. For some reason this seems to be the barley wine of choice here in Osaka. Give me an Old Foghorn or Old Nick any time."
"Feels a bit thin in the mouth to be honest. I was expecting something a bit more rich and full-flavored. It's smooth through, and the carbonation is at the right level. One of these is enough, however."
"Deep crimson hue with excellent clarity. Light beige, soapy head yields sparse lace. Mellow, ripe fig and dark caramel upfront in aroma, with a splash of cocoa. Trace black licorice and earthy hop hints. Tame and clean aromawise. Prevalent in flavor are notes of toffee drizzled biscuit and prune. Mild hints of baker's chocolate and woody, almost oaky hop tones add a bittersweet contrast mid palate. Nutty, burnt almond hints lend a trace astringency late. Lightly bittered, but well attenuated, with only moderate residual sweetness. Thinnish in body, with a mouthfeel shy in viscosity to support the malt profile. Finishes with a snap of singed chocolate cookie hints and a lingering, woody sweet Fuggles twang. A rather understated, but well rounded strong ale that's somewhat dangerous in its softness. Subtle and rather tasty."
"Lovely soft bottle-conditioned mouthfeel. Carbonation level is just right - whisks away the malt in preparation for the next sip. Very nice barley wine that doesn't go over the top in any way. Perilously drinkable for what it is."
"This strong ale poured a dark ruby and was very clear. Head was thin and airy and slightly off white. Very strong alcoholic aroma, sweet malts evident. Some stewed fruit was in the taste profile, very malty and powerful. A sipping ale. Seemed stronger than it probably was after a steady diet of bitter."
"Dark burgandy with a light tan ring that forms a circle around the edge of the glass. Aroma consists of malt and dark fruit along the lines of raisins or prunes. Mouthfeel is smooth with slight carbonation. Flavor seems less complex than I expected. Malt and the aforementioned fruit flavors seem to dominate the palate. Even as the beer warms the alcohol is masked very well and you never really taste it. Finish contains flavors of prune and is somewhat vinous. Not overly complex but very smooth drinking. If there ever was a barley wine to ease someone into the style without bombarding them with hops (like some American brewers tend to do) or scaring them alway with a noticably high tasting level of alcohol, Old Tom might be the one."
"Mouthfeel is a bit too thin, especially for the large alcohol content of an old ale. Mostly medicinal taste, with yeasty and sweet cherry tones. I keep expecting more flavor from the beer, but all I'm left with is the yeasty aftertaste - which isn't bad, but not what I hoped for."
"Comes in a 9.3 oz bottle - Nice deep dark russet brown color with deep ruby red tones and highlights. Crowned with a tall, loose, tannish head that faded pretty darn quick and the lace is very minimal in spots that evaporate. Smell has a soft caramel malty front notes lend bits of fruity darkness of cherry, plum, prune, and raisin and a little covering of alcohol. A simple yet divine little nose, nothing potent here besides the warmth of the alcohol thats a little hard to get past. Taste is mellowing caramel malts mostly with a few notes of darker fruits of plum and raisin, a slight burnt quality adds and sweetens more towards the finish. Hops barely detectable, something associated with most BW's from across the pond, this brew is UK all the way and is a fine specimen for a calmer, toned down version of most US versions. Its mellowness and tamer qualities are nice but not something I was wanting. Feel is touch on the thin side with some boldness and small girth towards the finish where the malts lay a nice little lingering burntness of chewy caramel and sweetness, nice solid finish. A pretty nice barleywine all-in-all, a beer for anytime and not special or really memorable. But I will be using this to introduce others to the style for sure."
"Dark reddish-brown hue, fairly deep, modest beige head, sinks to a long lasting collar, no lacing. Lovely nose, malty-sweet alcohol, prunes, candy does lack depth, a touch empty the invitation is modest (but inviting nevertheless). The palate is not as flavorful as I wanted, malty sweet, figs, nuts, candy-sugar, touches of alcohol. Rather dry modest bitterness (more than typical for a British Barelywine). Fairly long finish, pleasant malty-sweet aftertaste. Tasty. Medium-full body, lightly carbonated. This is not the best Old Ale Ive had but Id gladly have it again solid. Try one, if you're new to the style."
"Poured with a small white head that doesn't stay, leaving no lace. Almost no carbonation. Dark, clear ruby color. Nose is alcohol. Starts with an alcohol/sweet taste, finishes flat with alcohol overtones needs some malts and carbonation. Label has this as a strong ale but site says ""dark, rich and warming superior barley wine"". It is warming! Found in York, England, 275ml was £1.89."
"They list this as a Barley Wine but it really tastes more like an Old Ale...Also, no question this is a British Brew...pours a Ruby Red color..a slight creme colored head...On the nose I get dark fruits...tobacco....and alcohol...smells almost like a port...mouthfeel is sweet and sticky, but definitely not thick enough to qualify as a Barley Wine in my book...taste is sweet....a load of maltiness....dark fruits....some nuttiness....tastes like a port somewhat...I bet this would go great with a big thick maduro robusto cigar.....as a beer it's not bad by itself....I think there are better old ales out there but I wouldn't pass this one up..."
"Thanks for effort cokes."
"This is pretty decent and distinctively British, just not what I look for in a barleywine."
