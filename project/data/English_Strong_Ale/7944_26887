This beer is fairly clear in appearance- you can see right through it. The nose has grain, malt, apple, and a slight honey smell as well. Improves as it warms, but not much more than average here. Wow- The taste is completely different than the nose. Big malt and honey take over here- a little better than the nose. I don't really get any of the 9% ABV in the taste at all. Feel is light, syrupy, and carbonated w/ a hops bite on the aftertaste. Overall, this is a style I haven't had before- and I'm glad I got to try one. I probably won't buy this again though.

Whats even more distressing is the bad flavors intensify as it warms. Again one cant help but wonder if Hepworth spent as time in designing the beer as the label design and marketing the name, if they would have a better product. I still buy them -once- and am usually disappointed, but I still buy them. Yet again another ho hum, bah humbug beer. Ah well one more to go. The beer is a little watery and a touch thin as well as that weird taste. Mouthfeel is thin. Finish is crisp and clean.

Reminiscent of an IPA, yet without as much of a bitter edge. The after-taste was pleasant and non-offensive. The color was a true amber (not yellow, not exactly orange) and with no cloudiness. I enjoyed this bottle very much. I have bought a few more of these, even though the price tag for the 21 oz. bottle was a bit spendy. The more I had it though, the magic seemed to fizzle.

Has a slight hop bitterness in the end. The feel is light and almost watery, fizzy carbonation, and finishes slick, sticky, and boozy.

The beer pours a very clear light amber with a frothy white head that does lace quite well. The smell is spicy, malty candyish, and okay. The taste goes downhill from there. There is a spicy tartness, a cloying sweetness to this beer, and this god awful candy taste from the malts. There is plenty of carbonation, and the consistency is largely medium bodied. The beer doesn't hide the alcohol well, although the aftertaste is light for a beer with 9 ABV. This beer is a supreme disappointment considering the other Ridgeway beers have been quite good.

About the same orange amber color, but carbonation was more active in this one. The smell of this beer let me know that this was a different animal altogether. The aroma was significantly stronger here as a result of more hop presence and more alcohol. The taste was closer to the other beer than the aroma indicated, but it was less sour, and more bitter, which made it taste a touch better. The metallic tinge however was still very jarring on the taste buds. I also did not find this to be as rich and soothing in texture as the weaker sibling. Better overall beer, but not worth purposefully seeking out at full price no matter how bad the elves get.","rajendra82","Mar 06, 2007"

Slight hop aromas rise from the thick fluid. Tastes of sweet malts with an alcohol backbone, sour fruit flavors hit the tongue chased by a weak hop bitterness. Thick, smooth, but not syrupy fluid, but perhaps with too much carbonation. Tasty drink, good job covering the big alcohol without making it syrupy.

The 9% is well-balanced too and there are some other characteristics consistent with the style - but it's missing something.
