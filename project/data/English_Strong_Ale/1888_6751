Body is almost medium, could use a little more carbonation, not overly dry, and drinks easy enough. This is solid for the style.","SawDog505","Mar 09, 2014"

The taste comes on strong with the tangy note of bitterness evident in English Bitters. There is also a hint of caramel and something nutty about it that reminds me more of a brown ale.

The flavor begins with a sweet, fruity character which slowly evolves into a rich, bitter finish. The aftertaste is mainly of bitter hops and lasts for a very satisfying length of time. It's a tad fizzy for my taste, but I'd gladly have another. The ABV wasn't noted on the bottle, and I'm surprised to learn here that it's 7%.

Some caramel, but less than the nose indicates. Bitter aftertaste. Carbonation is low, sits well in the mouth. Drinkable, hides the alcohol very well. Just a touch too much malt in the balance to make this a real quality strong ale. Really enjoyed it though.","Darkhorse09","Aug 11, 2009"

First impression of this one is that it's very smooth and well balanced, Definitely hides its 7% ABV well and is very drinkable. Style is a bit of a misnomer, as this beer is aiming to be a British style and tastes like it, but I guess there isn't a British Strong Ale category. Taste wise you get some dark fruit kind of tastes in there (maybe some fig/raisin) but other than that tastes like a British pale ale to me. Nothing too extreme here but is a nice smooth brew with some subtle taste.. not too bad.","oriolesfan4","Aug 02, 2009"

A touch nutty/woody, not much hop flavor or bitterness. The feel is light to moderate with fizzy carbonation, definitely has a sour twang thing going on.

A good dose of chunky lacing is left clinging to the sides of the glass. Smell is earthy, malty, and nutty. Brown sugars and toasted chocolate malts as well. Unfortunately the nose overall is pretty weak, you really need to dig down into the glass to get a good whiff. Taste starts off with some caramel malts and roasted grains. Midway an unfortunate minor metallic flavor emerges with some dirty hops as well. Aftertaste consists of cocoa powder, rye bread, and molasses. I definitely recall the flavors being more rich and chocolatey on tap, shucks. Medium body with a surprisingly soft feel in the mouth, carbonation is a tad high though.

The flavors were rich, dry and alcoholic. I tasted toffee first before it went dry with toasted nuts, toasted malt and a nice bitterness at the end. The toasted malt notes were so dry it reminded me of a baked pretzel! These notes also nicely balanced the brown sugar and caramel malt flavors that became more apparent as it warmed.

Starts sweet with cocoa and tart bitterness, then gets sweeter like brown sugar and zestier hops with the carbonation released on the finish.

Pretty easy drinking and on the refreshing side for such a dark ale. There's a little more wheat flavor noted near the end of the 12 ounces, a dry ending.

I read all sorts of wonderful things about Lake Placid Brewing while on my very recent vacation in Montreal visiting friends. I decided to stop at the new Plattsburgh, NY facility to pick up a growler or 2 as provisions for camping out that night in the Adirondacks. Obviously, as any experienced camper knows, you want the largest container for your beer as possible (less waste). Unfortunately, they had no more growlers stocked at the brewery. All they had was 6'ers. So I was forced to drink the UBU strait from the 12 ounce bottle. Still, I was not disappointed. The drinkability was outstanding with idea balance between malt and prominent, yet very yummy hops. I think the reason that this beer does not have a higher BA rating is because, stylistically, it does not fit in to the typical categories. What is an American Strong Ale any way? If you are in the area, all you hophead campers out there MUST pick this up. This beer should be considered the official elixir of the Adirondack experience. Cheers!","djamieson","Jul 30, 2007"

A bit mild overall in the flavor and aroma but pleasant. There are notes of fruit and a bit of smoke in the taste as well. Mouthfeel was about medium, a bit lighter than expected.

At the back of the tongue the chocolate maltiness and pleasant but not-too-sweet fruits break loose for a nice fuller finish.

The taste of sweeter malt along with a roasted flavor is the first thing that I notice, almost a dark fruit flavor? Then you get a taste of a nice hop hit, being English hops in this brew I would imagine that it is Fuggle.

Dark lovibond caramel with a roasted grain tinge is secondary. Trace prune esters. Tame, but clean aromawise. Burnt toffee sweetness incipient in flavor is ensued by bitter, unsweetened baker's chocolate notes and butterscotch hints. Hop bitterness is moderate, lending a parcing dryness especially considering the high attenuation and paltry residual sweetness. Subdued floral hop flavor. Burnt biscuit tones augment as it warms, further facilitating the dry overall impression. Lightly bodied, with a lightly dextrinous mouthfeel that could use a notch more girth. Understated raisin and bitter powdered cocoa hints. Finishes with lingering, sharp, thirst inducing hop bitters mellowed slightly by cookie dough hints.

The smell was sweet and had a nice earthy texture to it with some peat and a decent hop presence. However, the taste was more like a brown ale gone wrong. I have some good high octane browns(Arrogant Bastard, Shed Mountain Ale), but this one was still stuck in 1st gear. There was a metallic resonance to the beer and there was little in the way of any interesting flavors going on with the alcohol. The malts were decently sweet, but they kept morphing back into a more confused state. The hop presence became non-existant until the finish, but I think it came on a little too bitter in the not so good way. More metallic than anything else. Meh.","GreatPondBrewer","Feb 21, 2004"

The flavor is much richer than the nose suggests with a tight combination of caramelish malt that fades away to reveal a light chocolate note after the swallow; a mild underlying fruitiness that suggests apples, dark berries and raisins; a well-infused hop flavor that's floral and gently grassy; and a firm, supportive bitterness that allows the gently sweet malt character to shine but not overwhelm.
