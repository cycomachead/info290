3.6,-3,4,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Clear looking mahogany brown with a loose, thin tan head. This beer doesn't have great lacing and looses its head relatively quickly. The beer smells like a strong ale with a sweet malt base and some biting alcohol. There is a touch of fruitiness in the nose, but it's not delicate and refined like a Belgian. The taste is slightly sweet toasty/chocolatiness with some biting alcohol. The mouthfeel is all wrong and completely off balance. Overall I would suggest that you do not seek out this beer because clearly it's not made for the general beer drinker...it's made for someone interested in sucking down an unrefined mess of beer-related flavors.","ThePorterSorter","0"

Brown Ale-esque maltiness throws down a nice base layer for a pretty hefty mineral aspect. Looking at the label and brewery, I was thinking this one would be a little on the gimmicky side...ok...alot on the gimmicky side; but this is quite a nice little treat that shows some nice depth and some solid UK characteristics.

3.75,1.1,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Pours an effervescent copper color with a huge towering head that dies away relatively quickly. The aroma is mostly bready maltiness which is sweet and nutty around the edges. The flavor is also very bready/nutty. A bit of that 7.7% ABV shows. The body is medium and carbonation is lower than the pour had me anticipating. Overall this is a nice little brown ale that is pretty drinkable for the ABV.","alcstradamus","Jul 19, 2010"

4,7.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Thanks to Doug and Eric who threw this in on a beer trade. Clear copper pour with decent head and lacing. Nice malty nose with lots of toffee, brown sugar and just a touch of alcohol. The taste evolves as this beer warms. Lots of nice toasty caramel, maple syrup, brown sugar, with a hint of nuttiness to it. Just a touch of bitterness on the finish to balance it out. The slightly higher alcohol is really well hidden which makes this extremely drinkable. Reminded me of sitting in a pub in London. Really a well done beer and unexpected surprise from a great beer trade!","beerdrifter","Jun 25, 2010"

3.78,1.9,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Enjoyed on tap at the Tap Room / Colgate Inn in Hamilton, NY, this one shows a dark copper color with a decent white cover and good lacing. The aroma brings honey banana toffee, pleasant but not very strong. The flavor matched the aroma with much more force. There's cider mash and maple sugar with an herbal hop touch. It's medium bodied and medium drinkable. A hint of alcohol. Very interesting, a worthy entry. Somewhat of a cough medicine taste or maybe bourbon inflected. I would like to try again, not a barn burner but different and enjoyable enough.","Durge","Sep 21, 2009"

3.88,4.6,3.5,3,4.5,3.5,4,"Looks like Dr. Pepper with little carbonation. Sweet aroma of malt and a little molasses maybe. I really like the malt balance on this one and the sweetness is just right.

2.05,-44.7,2.5,2.5,2,2,1.5,"Overall - I've had a number of beers from Cooperstown and every single one that I had yielded an exploding head that required me to wait to finish pouring. Worse yet, every single one has a very strange perfumey and flowery aroma that seems very off flavored. Furthermore, when looking at the sediment left behind, I see a collection of pinhead sized ""pellets"" on the bottom of the bottles. I wonder if these ""pellets"" are infectious colonies of bacteria/yeast but I see these in each bottle that I had.","DmanGTR","Nov 25, 2008"
4.2,13.2,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Pours a thick tan head that thins but sticks around. Color is an unfiltered reddish brown. Smells a of ripe apple with a bit of hops and malt. Tastes great in two phases. Starts out thin and crisp and then gets stronger at the end. Apples mildly the whole way and strong malt at the end with a touch of hop bitterness. Gets better with every sip. Stays in your mouth, but isn't over powering.","mjaskula","Nov 16, 2008"
3.58,-3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"this beer pours a nice brown copper color with a thick off white head that recedes to patchy lace that clings to the glass. the aroma presents a lot of sweet malt and fruit esters, with a touch of hops in the background. the taste follows with a decent amount of caramel and crystal malt up front finishing with some hop bitterness, the bit of warmth on the way down is nice, in conjunction with the medium body and good co2. a decent beer, and one that I look forward to having again.","almychristopher","Nov 02, 2008"
3.69,-0.5,3.5,4.5,3.5,3,3.5,"D: A decent offering, and an interesting style choice. When all is said and done, it's a fairly tasty brew and it smells great. I did find it a bit boozy as it went, so it's not the most accessable beer, but worth trying or having a couple.","Proteus93","Oct 24, 2008"

3.42,-7.8,3.5,4,3,3.5,3.5,"This poured a clear copper color with a little bit of off-white head. It smelled like lots of caramel and roasted malts, with a bit of lemon hops. It tasted like strong orange and lemon hops mixed with sweet malt, and had a bit of alcohol flavor. It was watery with some carbonation, and had a sour aftertaste. Overall this had more flavor and complexity than the other Cooperstown brews, but it wasn't an overly enjoyable flavor or complexity. Keep trying.","Pencible","Jun 06, 2008"
3.73,0.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Smells very caramelly and sweet. Got my tastebuds ready for some serious residual sugars, however the taste, though on the sweet side, was nowhere near as sweet as expected. Mostly malts and fruit in the flavor. Surprisingly smooth and mellow considering the ABV. I thought this was one of Cooperstown's better offerings.","Hoagie1973","Jun 05, 2008"
3.79,2.2,3,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Thanks to hyland24 for pulling this from the upstate connections. Poured an apricot color with golden hues lining the egdes of the glass. Had an unmistakable ""Big Apple"" aroma. Reminded me of walking in an apple orchard. The taste was sweet apples up front with a mild bitter finish. Was not like a cider but more like a bubbly apple wine. Had a very light and bubbly mouthfeel will be a great summer beer.","Pleepleus","May 09, 2008"

3.13,-15.6,4,3.5,3,2.5,3,"Poured reddish-amber into a nonic. Complete with a half-inch of white foam that dissipated quickly. The aroma was of bread and butter. A malty brew, with hints of caramel. The bread and butter undertones shine through. An almost salty taste also came out. The bread theme that this beer seems to have taken on shine through even through the feel. An almost bready chew on this brew. I can't say I'm looking forward to finishing the other bottle of this pair that came with my mixed pack. Bread and butter.","Jp7010","Oct 24, 2007"
3.75,1.1,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Mouthfeel is nearly full-bodied, and the carbonation is not very aggressive which makes it smooth and soft on the palate. I'm not sure I'd have more than one of these in a sitting, but this is a really interesting and tasty brew that I'd have again if given the chance. Definitely worth a try.","number1bum","Oct 15, 2007"
3.06,-17.5,4,3,3,3,3,"Pours a light amber hue with a 1.5 finger off-white head that slowly dies down to a thin frothy layer. Stickiness is pretty nice, holds on well to the sides. Smell is that Cooperstown ringwood yeast, caramel malt, roasted nuts, raisins, and hint of booze. Taste is pretty woody with some smoked nut flavors. Hints of vanilla seem a bit out of place but are quite strong. Butter and yeast are in the aftertaste and linger for quite a while. Medium bodied with a mild amount of carbonation, a bit dry in the mouth. Pretty decent brew, just like Middle Ages with their ringwood yeast. If their brews aren't your thing, avoid this beer.","BeerTruth","Oct 06, 2007"
4.27,15.1,3.5,4,4.5,4,4.5," The 7.70% ABV is a bit too high, and it can be felt pretty easily after a sip or two. Not to worry, it doesn't stand out or overpower the beers flavor in any way. One thing I noticed is that many reviewers said this had a buttery feel to it. I can't really detect it, but the subtlety of the flavors combines to give this a pretty amazing amount of depth. It's a shame that there's only two of these in the 6-pack that I was given, since Cooperstown's got a winner her. Any chance that this is what the Rockies have been drinking the last 3 weeks?","JerzDevl2000","Sep 11, 2007"

3.8,2.4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"This is a nice brew from Cooperstown. I wasn't thrilled with it at first but it simply needed some time to warm up and let the flavours and aromas come out, so If you are poured one and it seems a bit too chilled, do the same.","SixpointJMH","Jun 25, 2007"
3.97,7,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Pours a clear brown/copper, thin off white head, leaves some solid lacing, good retention, nice layer. Smell is very sweet, caramelized, very fruity, nice dose of alcohol, sherry, very malty and strong. Taste is similar, sweet brown sugar/caramel front, sherry, some citrus, malty as all hell, fruit and alcohol.

3.97,7,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Pours a transparent but muddy orange brown colour and maintained a short, but steady level of head. The body is a little thin not boasting any harsh of dominant qualities. The aroma is incredibly sweet with notes of raisins, dates, fermented berries. The flavours mimic the aroma with a similar sweetness in the aftertaste that rings out for a few seconds then seems to disappear. This works as a good winter warmer, the malt bill is very complex. Also notes of oak. No suggestion as to the alcohol percentage. There's not much roast, not much bitterness, or alcohol sting. What there is a lovely soft brandy/sherry complex. I liked it a lot.","biegaman","May 18, 2007"

3.73,0.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"This is the first beer I have reviewed. I thoroughly enjoyed this with beer with dinner, but am not getting the same taste experience now that I am not breaking it up with bites of food. I like its clear, amber color. As for smell, maybe I should have smelled it before tasting it, because now, I experience very little aroma by sniffing, but what I get is subtle fruit and caramel. I deceded to grab some food (turkey breast) to enhance the drinking experience. This helps. I really enjoy the taste. It's not terribly complex to me--mostly caramelish malt, yet I've never had a beer quite like it. The alcohol is making me tipsy, and I wouldn't have guessed it to be 7.7%, based on the taste. Rating numerically seems a bit misguided to me. The mouthfeel is what it is--nothing astouding, but to me. perfect for this beer. The last sip was a pleasure, as well as the mellow aftertaste, which I will take to my bed, if it lasts after I brush my teeth! Well, I've had quite a delicious time with this, and I encourage you all to try it. It also seems like a ""safe"" beer to offer all kinds of friends; there's nothing eccentric, extreme. or weird about it. Now that the glass has been empty for a few minutes, I am tasting the yeast; it's a subtle aftertaste--nice, even though I don't usually like the taste of most yeasts. Well, I think you can see why I chose my handle, and thanks for allowing me to share my novice beer-drinking experience with you.","TotalNovice","Aug 09, 2006"

3.75,1.1,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"On tap and later in a bottle, this brew is strong and assertive. It does mellow the more you drink it- maybe due to warming a bit or because it's high alcohol content (both I guess). It has a very sweet almost honey like aroma. Taste is also on the sweeter side, really seems made in the style of an English Strong Ale(which is what is it supposed to be). Carmel predominates in this beer. It's a little too one-sided, made to be strong, yet kind of a one hit wonder. Not a bad beer by any means. It's enjoyable when one is in the mood for a strong ale. I like that American brewers are trying to make different styles of ale like this one.","AaronRed","Mar 07, 2006"
4,7.8,4,4,4,4,4,"this one is tasty and very drinkable (if you dont mind the ringwood yeast strain, it doesnt bother me personally...) - but watch the ABV. I'll buy this one again, maybe not in the spring or summer but in the fall for sure.","Ego","Nov 21, 2005"
3.83,3.2,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Purchased at Sam the Beer Man in Binghamton. This beer pours a translucent amber color with a bubbly off white head and thick lacing. The aroma is of toasted malts with some sweetness, maybe a bit lemony. The first taste gives you a bit of bitterness but mostly toasted malts and caramel that is very enjoyable and drinkable. The beer has a nice bit of carbanation that reminds me of the texture of a beer like Duvel but with different taste. With an abv approaching 8% this beer is deceiving as it is approachable.","ggaughan","Aug 11, 2005"

Theres a grist-like, sugary smell, mixed with yeast and fruit (blackberries?)molassessort of reminiscent of a barley-wine. Just great!! Its got a little slick oiliness, but it fits right in to the beers character. Hoppy and bitter finish. I didnt know what to expect from this beer, and it sat on the back of my beer shelf for a long time after I bought it. That was my loss. This is fantastic!!","Suds","Jun 27, 2004"

The maltiness is the previlent characteristic with a little bit of smooth bitterness at the back of the tongue.

2.68,-27.8,3,2.5,2.5,3,3,"Poured vigorously to get a small off white head that quickly faded to a patchy film. Creamy butterscotch aroma almost too buttery, not inviting. Clear, dark iced tea colored beer with some fine carbonation floating up through it. Sweet malts, butterscotch, lightly bitter finish. Moderately full body, but a little too sweet and one sided. I'm not sure if this beer is bad or not, it definitely seems off, but not as bad as the Back Yard IPA I just poured down the drain. I bought singles of the other beers they make and drank them a week ago and they were all fine. I like my butterscotch flavors as much as the next guy (Mmm MIddle Ages), but this is a bit much. I'm dissapointed :-(","HappyHourHero","Dec 07, 2003"
4,7.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Deep amber pour with a creamy head. A deep aroma flows with tones of caramel and toffee with and underneath of light spice.

However, I have not yet found a beer that pairs up better with pizza. I don't have the most discerning palate yet, but it seems to me as though the malt flavor is linking up with the wheat in the crust. If I were rating this beer as a pizza companion I'd give it a 5 for drinkability, but for a general rating I had to score it lower.","Weissenheimer","Oct 22, 2003"

3.7,-0.3,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"The beer pours a dark golden to light amber color with a white lace head. The aroma is a very refreshing fruity malt smell. I love this quality in beers. It tastes light with a med. addition of caramel malts. It is high in alcohol boasting 7.7% abv. , but is still very drinkable. A good beer to drink cold. I didn't detect much in the line of high powered hopping for either flavor or aroma. Overall, this is not a bad beer, but not the best that Cooperstown has to offer. It could do a little more with better head retention, higher hopping, and a larger aray of malt complexity, but how many beers do you know that could do the same.","WesWes","Dec 04, 2002"

Very smooth, belies its alcohol content. The caramel and toffeeish maltiness and the Ringwood yeast flavor (not as pronounced as in Middle Ages brews) are balanced by a spiciness that seems to be from the hops.  A very, very nice ""spring and summer evening by the fire"" brew.","sponberg","Beers"
