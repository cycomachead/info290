"Enjoyed a bottle of this great beer.  great pour with a nice dark red body with nice thick cap.  Was nice an malty brown and very drinkable with 7.4% ABV.  Really wish I had more than just one of these and look forward to finding a few more."

"Pours  a ruby colored dark amber with a nice head.  Easy to drink, kicks like a mule.  Try it!"

"My go to brown ale. Amazing price for what you get."
"could be my go to beer..."

"Good. On the lite side of dark beers."

"My go-to-beer. Simple, readily available, 7.4% brown ale for a good price. I enjoying having a variety of beer and tend to not buy 12 packs of anything with the exception of Shed because I could go for one after a long workday"
"Pours a hazy amber to a very dark almost ruby black color. Head builds to excellent level and shows good lacing retention. Some carbonation can be seen towards the bottom where the color is lightest. Smells of fresh biscuits, caramel, and faint Scotch like alcohol scents. Mouth is all malted bread and caramel. Good alcohol bite at the mid=palate with light hop notes. A little bitter on the back side of the flavor profile. Just enough to let you know there is some hops there. Whiskey barrel flavors of smoke, leather, and oak linger. Not sure where that comes from but it's pleasant and complimentary. Very good. 4.25 out of 5."

"Brownish in color but certainly not in character, absolutely drinks like a session or Irish red.  Lack of mouthy maltiness."

"O: Overall it's a nice beer and the creaminess balanced with the warmth was really nice.  The bitterness of the grapefruit didn't linger long.  I would recommend it, felt like the people that made it put a lot of heart into it."

"O: not all that interesting or complex;"
""
""
""
""
""

"A bit too malty and sweet for my tastes....more hops would have balanced it out better."
""
"Nice maltiness. Not quite enough hop presence. Lacks complexity, but still, a good tasting, exceptionally smooth drinking beer at 7.4% abv. A great companion on a cold winter night."
""
""
"Overall:  I found myself liking this beer and craving more almost right away.  It's unassuming, and gently flavorful."
"Nice malts and caramel notes."
""

""
"I thoroughly enjoy this beer. Nice earthy taste. Lightly sweety and caramel under tones."

"Very good! Will warm you to your bones!"

"This strong ale could wear the ""winter warmer"" label in my opinion. Hearty, malty, and high ABV will make this even better later in the year. Recommend"

"I have to admit that brown ale is among my favorite beer varieties, and I am therefor biased. However, even among a genre of which I am inclined, this beer sticks out. Its flavor is not only rich, but it is distinct among brown ales. It is not too harsh , and is remarkably smooth for such a strong flavor. I usually like to explore new beers and breweries, and don't often buy the same thing twice, however, this will certainly be an exception."
""
""
""
"O: A good strong/old ale. Nice and warming. I will buy this one again next time I am in New England"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"pours less than brown, almost a burnt / amber orange brown. small amt of sudsy khaki colored head. slight hop and burnt malt aroma. flavors are well balanced, some burnt spicy peppery notes with a touch of citrusy hops, and some roast in the back end"

"O = I like this one and would drink again. I wish there was a website for the brewer, Otter Creek, so I could read their take on this ale, but it's currently ""under construction."" I would enjoy this again occasionally and can imagine it pairing with a hearty beef stew and crusty dark bread."

"Overall- Great ale, I'm glad I took a risk and bought a case. Very easy drinking. For a beer with 7.4 abv, the price was fair too. Personally, I feel this is well suited for the Winter. Give it a try!"
""
""
""
" Complex with an easy-breezy vibe."

"O - A solid English Strong ale. American Strong Ale's are more my style, but this is a good beer. A good amount of flavor, albeit not real complex. Dangerously drinkable at over 7% ABV. Paired this with (very) hot wings, and it was an outstanding combo. Certainly recommend this beer."

"While not a session beer, it would be possible to have more than one in a sitting just because there's enough going on here. As the favors faded into a anisette/licorice combination in the end, I couldn't help but notice that I hadn't quite had anything like this before. If there was such a thing as an Imperial Brown Ale, this would be a good example of how to brew it right. This isn't a pushover beer but at the same time, it's hard to imagine anyone being offended by what's going on here."

"Overall: this is a very drinkable smooth malty sweet brown/red ale. I look forward to the colder days when this beer will taste even better - aka Vermont. - by the way, I use a fluted wine glass to drink all my high quality beers like this one."
""
""
"Clear chestnut body with a thin light beige cap. Modest head retention with a bit of short-lived lacing. Malty aroma, toffee was dominant with fainter brown sugar and nuts. Hints of alcohol, butter, and toast appeared as the beer warmed. Same malty character in the flavour, but with moderate bitterness and more pronounced nuttiness. Faint cola, herbal, and alcohol notes towards the finish. Decent texture, medium bodied with lively carbonation. Overall, a pleasant beer that drinks easier than the abv would lead you to believe."

"At first the taste is cloyingly sweet, but by the third sip the hops become much more apparent and aggressive. Surprising how drinkable this is. Very tasty, possibly dangerous. Happy to have had it!"

"This is a really good tasty brown ale, very nice balance and flavor, goes down smooth, a definite must-try."

" A decent English style beer and worthwhile. I'm glad that my roommate shared this with me."

"Overall, pretty decent and real easy drinking for 7.4% also."

"O: Overall warm nuttiness with earthy silty tea stands out making this pretty good. decent complexity."

"definitely one of the better American browns ive come across in awhile. this, from right across the lake in Vermont, is a hopped up version like few ive had. it pours as red as it does brown, especially in the light. its got over an inch off tan head, but the retention is rather poor. still, a creamy rich liquid beckons. the nose is a great balance between sweeter English and American malts, and fresh east coast hops, with mild acidity. a little woody, a little sweet, and a lot yummy. the taste is the best parts of the nose, rich chocolate and caramel malts do their thing, while the beer finished on the bitter end of the spectrum with a wide variety of hop flavors and feels, including pine and sticky ganja. easy drinking for a beer of this alcoholic strength, its fuller in body and the carbonation is pretty good. its got a creamy texture and seems like a nitro tap would make this elite. I like this better than the shed ipa, and I look forward to more of their beers. this is excellent, and its even better on tap."

"Toasty and tea-like like a Northern English brown but big and full like an American brown. Neat genre straddler but not something I'd buy again. Or buy in the first place technically."
""
""
"O: This wouldnâ€™t be a bad beer to sip on a cold day. It definitely lives up to being described as ""a rugged brown ale"" on the label."
""
"All in all a good beer but not one I'd care to have again."
""
""
"Good, an interesting beer with some nice complexities, reminded me of a doppelbock kinda."
""
""
"It is early, so I decided to go with a heavy-handed pour that ended up producing some cascading action in the glass. It also produced two-plus fingers of dense, foamy deep-tan head with good retention. Color was a deep-brown with burnt orange highlights and just a touch of haze in terms of clarity. Nose had an interesting mix of chocolate malt and minty, evergreen hops. It is Girl Scout cookie season and this made me think of Thin Mints. The lacing that had begun to form was wonderfully sticky. Mouthfeel was medium, approaching full and the chocolate malt was immediate on the tongue with the minty hops following as I breathed in. This was really good, much more than I was expecting and the finish really did have a Thin Mint cookie quality to it. I will be recommending this one to others."

"This is a pretty nice one. Decent body, flavor is bringing something, though it's slightly too tangy. Just a wee bit. Carbonation is a bit too high as well. Overall a pretty good brew. Glad to be able to try something from a new (to me) brewery. Will keep an eye out for more from them."
""
""
"Pours a two finger khaki tan head that fades quickly leaving no lace. Brown hazy color. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Light malty nose, flavor is sweet malty and nutty. Better than the usual brown. $1.80 for a 12oz bottle from Concord Coop Concord, NH."
"O: Third time I've had this beer now. They were all given to me as gifts. Its a pretty good beer. Nothing that astounded me or made me want to go out and get some but the experience was enjoyable and memorable."
"This is more like an English Brown, than an English Strong. The flavor was more muted than you would expect. The flavor on this one is deceptive compared to the ABV."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Starts with darker malt but, in the swallow is a good dose hop. In short,well balanced. Thin bodied with a level of carbonation above normal. Earthy overall with a low sweetness."
""
""
"Overall - This brew is deceptively smooth for a 7.2%, it goes down with grace. Enjoyed wholeheartedly."
""

"O: Nice to see this brand brought back from the dead. This is a good beer. Rich, flavorful, and smooth. Highly drinkable despite its size. You would not know that this is 7.4% abv. A great fall beer, though I'm glad it's offered year round."
""
""
""
"One of the better brown ales on the scene. Crafted with care to produce a palatable taste."
""
"Overall, a nicely done beer, and perfect for a night by the fire. These kinds of brown ales are rapidly being lost under the influences of more hop-forward examples, so it's nice to see the New England style come out to shine. Recommended."
""
"Pours dark amber. Had it on tap at JAX right off Killington mountial. Tastes great, a boarder line American Pale ale but had a hint of dark Belgian after taste. I had never never heard of this brewery before coming to VT but this was a great ale and I'd love to try some of their happier offerings"

"O: A little tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, good kick, decent representation of style, itâ€™s a decent beer but there are other similar beers that I would choose first."
""
"I found this brown ale to have a very unique character in the flavor and aroma. I'm not completely blown away by this beer, but I would buy this beer again and certainly would recommend this over some (most) of the other duller brown ales out there. Better example of an American Brown Ale than most."
""
""

"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a dark, vibrant, ruby-highlighted brown coloring that looks dark and deep. A thin, sparse, filmy coating on the surface of the beer is all you get for head. Aromas of rich toffee, molasses, and a touch of roasty qualities. Smells very heavy/big, but not overpowering on the nose. Flavors are much more roasted than the nose lets on, with the rich, dark, sweet flavors entering in after the forward punch of earth and roast. Malty profiles overall, with a touch of bitter coffee at the end to draw a bitter close to the palate. Roasty and blended aftertaste, with hints of the dark, earthy sweetness you just tasted, as well as the bitterness that brought everything to a close. Smooth and clean in mouth, with a slight effervescence at the end of the drink. Very easy to drink, with a rich, roasty finish that hangs on just long enough to bring you back for more."
""
"PRETTY GOOD, GIVE IT A TRY!"
"Notes: A very large malty backbone but still very smooth and drinkable. Cheers."
"Overall: There is absolutely nothing wrong with this brown ale, and if it was available, I would drink it, but it is not memorable and does not warrant going out of the way to find. Otter Creek taking over The Shed brewery, may have made this more mainstream, but it is just OK."
"This is one of those beers that I really like because it moves through several sensations as I drink it. It begins sweet and slightly malty, coats the tongue in a creamy way, and then ends with a low to moderate bitterness which lingers and finishes dry. I had this on tap once in Vermont but the bottle is just as nice."
""
"Overall - Middle of the road in nearly every category. The nose held a faint promise, but nothing really delivered here."
"O- drinkable, but not my favorite. A little flat, a little watery. Reminds me of a can of cola left open overnight."
""
""
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a very dark brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is nutty, some hops. Taste is well balanced hops and malts, some nuts are present, very easy drinking. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a solid beer but unspectacular."
""
"Pours a deep brown with reddish highlights when held to light and a huge fluffy off white head that persists forever. Smells of caramel and light chocolate with a hint of earthy hops. Not much of a nose on this one. The flavor follows the aroma quite well. Caramel, brown sugar, and a hint of chocolate with a touch of earth and mineral water. Medium to thin body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet slick and bubbly mouthfeel. Strong ale is a real stretch for this brew, but at 7.4% I never noticed the abv. This drinks more like a brown ale but even at that its really bland. Nice to try, but I doubt I'd pick it up again."
"O/D-A good 6-pack of ""Strong Ale"". Definitely a hybrid tht balances between styles. I enjoyed this single. Vermont to the rescue!"
"Poured into a 13 oz tulip, bottled in early October. Pours a a dark brown, with a half inch of light tan head, that leaves some lace. Smell is biscuit, brown sugar, some carmel, and dark fruit. Taste is more aggressive with burnt brown sugar and roasted almonds leading the way. Body is medium large, plenty of carbonation, not dry, and drinkability is easy. This is a nice brew, not earth shattering. Nice price."
""
""
"Feels like an English Brown Ale with a slight Belgian influence thrown in there and a decent amount of hops. I would be very interested in what yeast strain they used. Interesting beer for sure and not what I expected going in."
"After last week's disaster with Trout River Choclate Stout, I was a little gun shy about adventuring into something else. I have seen Shed around but never triied it until tonite. The suprise I got tonite was one I would welcome anytime. I spent the same money (about ($9.00 for 6) but this time instead of anemic, flat, disgusting ,rusty barrel water, I discovered an amazing beer. Everything is right here. Pours dark with a beautiful creamy head. Full bodied high quality malt with a light hop finish. This is an amazing beer. They don't get any better. 7.4 % what else could one want?"
""
""
"Really good flavors with none of that fruitiness that can sometimes take away from a good malty brew. Really clean with flavors that go well together and an incredible balance. 7.4%? tastes like it should be lower, could be dangerous."
"Overall pretty good, nice overall robust winter like ale. I could see downing a few of these while up in the cold mountains, keep me warm and decent flavor, and for what it is it has a big flavor but still fairly drinkable."
"12oz. bottle served in a standard pint. Pours a deep chestnut hue with ruby highlights when backlit. Head is three inches, dense, off-white and creamy. Head eventually dissipates into a frothy, quarter inch cap; textured clusters of lacing adhere to the sides of the glass during the tasting. Nose is somewhat subdued expressing light, toasted malts, a hint of fruit (dates/figs?) and caramel notes. Taste consistent with nose - no aspect really stands out per se but it all coalesces together nicely. There may even be a trace of coffee present in the flavor profile behind the fruit. Mouthfeel is medium-light in body with a pleasant, even carbonation. Overall, this comes off as a slightly more flavorful brown ale. I think this beer would be quite pleasant on-cask, but I'm afraid it would be dangerously drinkable - the 7.40% abv is very well-hidden."
"I like this okay. I'd prefer a mellower more drinkable brown ale. This is basically just a stronger brown ale."
"Overall I was pretty pleased with this beer. Hearty yet drinkable."
""
""
"Medium body and carbonation; feels smooth and has a little heft to it. Average drinkability. Tasty but not super exciting; a little one dimensional, perhaps."
