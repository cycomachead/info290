"Simple but refreshing mouth feel. A nice lighter styled dark/brown beer with enjoyable features"

"nothing about this beer says holidays to me, or English strong ale for that matter. more of an dark English mild, save for the still modest alcohol by volume. dark nut brown color, half inch of lazy tan head that's relatively stagnant, doesn't go anywhere. the nose is sweet and earthy English malts, chocolate malt, and a sweetness I don't all the way like. lots of stale smelling ale yeast too, give it a funny metallic ting. I don't dislike the flavor, which is all grin forward, dark but not unmalted roast barley dark. not as sweet as it smells either, which I appreciate. no holiday spice at all, somewhat of a letdown in a beer that's not particularly flavorful. it reminds me of a lower quality sam smiths product from a yeast standpoint, which some may love, but I don't favor. it lacks the properties that make a holiday beer special for me. rich and robust in body though, which helps a lot, and only gently carbonated, giving it the appearance of a much bigger ale. nothing special here overall in my eyes."

"O - A terrific beer. Ticks near all the boxes required for this class. A full flavored sweet yet well balanced strong English brown ale which packs a punch. A delightful beer and one of my favourites from England yet. Much credit and respect to the brewing team at Hook Norton."

"Overall, it's fine, but really not that exciting. When an English ale like this is good, it can really be phenomenal. This one is not that, however—it feels like a by-the-numbers brown, perhaps with a little more weight behind it than you'd usually get, but missing the edge that would make it something special."
"Pours just like kola beer with a one finger head that slowly settles to a rim of lacing and leggy lacing everywhere,the smell is dried fruits,raisins,booze and cotton candy,the mouthfeel is light bodied with moderate carbonation and the tastes are pretty much just like any other dark English ale without the booze its basically toffee,dried fruits,raisins and finished with a herbal earthy bitterness,overall if you havnt tried it you ain't missing much cheers."

"O: Very enjoyable beer. Well worth checking out."
"Pours dark brown beer with tan head. Good foam retention. Nice smell: dark fruits, chocolate, roasted malts. Decent taste, close to porters, roasted malts in the front, some fruity roundness, rather warming with evident hop bitterness in the finish. Medium-bodied, balanced and full-flavoured ESA."
"O - Promised alot at first with pleasant aromas upfront. I was slightly disappointed with the taste which lacks a little intensity and complex flavours to that of a good dark ale. But nonetheless very drinkable on a cold winters evening."

"Rare dud for HN."

"A decent English Ale. Full of flavour but not overly complex. Good."

"Right up my alley, this one, so a little biased. Nice deep, dark red tan colour with thick head and some lacing on a pint handle. Aroma is a little fruitcake and roast. I'm olfactorily challenged so aroma scores are a bit sketchy. Flavour is roasted malt with plum and fruitcake as you'd expect. Good bitterness on the back palate so I didn't find it cloying at all. Boozy? according to Doktorhop. I guess it is a little but the flavour is big enough to pull it off. A bit chewy at the end but that's just lip-smackin' style and I found that all in all this is a really pleasant ale and I would like some more."
""
"Food match: The bottle states 'cheese platter' and I don't disagree. Other than that a nice game bird roast would work well - Jamie Oliver's ""Roast of incredible game birds with proper polenta"" is a great place to start."
"Overall: an interesting English Ale with a reasonably restrained flavour. The flavours that do come through, however, are well considered and bounce off each other nicely."
""
"Overall, a bit one dimensional, and dry. Add 0.5 for the Aus price point."
"O: It's alright for a UK beer, but not spectacular."
""
"The body is medium and has a bit of smoothness but opts for crispness in the overall feel from a carbonation that's just right for this beer."
"I came in with moderate expectations, and they were blown off the hinges. This is one of the better English beers that I've had in a long, long time."
""
"An interesting Christmas ale with a restrained character. All the aromas and flavours are subtle, yet this beer achieves a nuanced complexity. No spice, but a definite chocolate note makes itself known. Lovely body. Rewards the perceptive beer drinker. Well worth sampling if you come across it."
"Notes: Magnificent! Tasty! A Brown Ale with richness and malty goodness."
""
""
"Dark copper with a decent, if somewhat porous white head. Earthy malts, raisin, hints of spice and christmas pudding. Nice earthy malts, light buttery character, raisin and even a bit of brandy. Quite pleasant, but a little rough on the finish. At first, this is a little too carbonated, but it eases off as the beer breathes. Good dessert beer, but a bit rough and high in alcohol to be a true session ale."
"Overall this is an average offering but it lacks the depth and complexity for the Strong Ale category and the foreign pricepoint/small bottle size also detracts from needing to revisit this anytime soon."
"The beer poured out as a nice brownish red color with a tan head. The head sinks down to a thin white film that lays over the top of the beer. This beer Wasn't really a holiday beer to me, I suppose there were some spices in it but it wasn't very pronounced. This brew get a little better tasting once it warms up a bit. This beer might be ideal having it from a cask."
"D: very drinkable--would certainly buy this again!"
"My first beer from this brewery and it wont be the last. I would love to visit Oxfordshire to see the source."
"Very enjoyable, one of the better Christmas Ales I've had this year."
"D: Not something I would repeat. It was fun for a while, but this beer becomes quite cloying after just a small glass."
"Drinkability: I was having a hankering for a beer with a distictive English flavor and a winter beer- this is both wrapped into one and is definitely recommended."
"Overall a great winter warmer just like their stout."
"D: On the whole, a solid, drinkable beer."
"An OK beer, lacked that X Factor which I hoped for."
"Another chesnut colored winter warmer into a imperial nonic,a well formed creamy-like tan colored head atop.Big juicy fruit malt in the nose mixed with caramel/biscuit malt,the fruit really jumped in your face and was nice.Flavors are of fruit cakes with a tinge of nuttiness,very fruit forward.Its a nice winter beer thats not hot or overly sweet,a very nice winter beer in my opinion."
"Conclusion: A wonderful, tasty winter warmer in classic English style. Went wonderfully with a Grilled Red Leicester and Tomato sandwich."
"Clear, deep red-brown pour with quickly fading head and nice lacing. The nose is very malty with hints of hazelnut, vanilla, figs, and caramel. The taste is much the same but more of a roasty, almost burnt chocolate comes out as it warms. Decent mouthfeel and drinkability but nothing special. A little disappointing."
"D: Terrific, silky, buttery malty nutty goodness, all in a 5.5% package. It's much more than a Xmas enjoyment, I'll be sipping this all summer, found a supply for $3.99 a bottle on sale. One of my few repeat purchases."
"D: Two or three around the holidays would definitely be enjoyed."
"Overall - A very nice (and quite festive) brew... recommended..."
"Poured into a shaker pint. pours a cloudy mahogany color with a big fluffy light tan head that laces rather nicely. Malty aroma with hints of dark fruits and spices. Mostly dark fruits in taste but hints of ginger spice and caramel, also some buttery notes. Slight but pleasant bitter finish. Very interesting and complex brew, drinkable but not one you want to drink a lot in one sitting of. Overall a pleasant experiance."
"D: It's drinkable, but not in the good way."
"D: Goes down easily. Probably could do more than 1 in a sitting, but I'll take my time with it."
"Not your typical Christmas Ale. Not very Christmassy at all, really, but enjoyable."
"One additional note. I really like the bottle design with the label and back panel description of the brewery. Extra kudos."
"Dark chestnut amber with a pock marked sand colored head that lasts awhile and sticks to the glass. This beer smells of roasted malt, cocoa powder and black licorice with mild minty hops. Roasty dark chocolate and toasted nuts with cocoa and herbal hop notes balance nicely and finish fairly dry. Medium bodied with smooth carbonation. I'm not sure about the style but make no mistake, Twelve days is indeed a good ale. The bottle says ""English Christmas ale"" the BA description is ""English strong ale"" but I think it tastes more like a nut brown ale."
"Poured into a Squatters true pint glass, and it still was left short of a true pint, nice black color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy tan head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with a good dose of toffee/caramel. The taste is sweet, malty, with some vanilla, toffee/caramel, a slight nutty note. Medium body, a nice smooth/creamy brew. Drinkable, a nice one."
"d: a good brew with some interesting tastes but could definitely be a bit more festive"
"D - This was a pretty tasty christmas ale. It isn't very strong (as it's classfied), but it is very good and easy drinking."
"Slightly toasty medium body with a lot of silky chocolate malt, toffee, caramel, hazelnut, roasted coffee and burnt toast. There's a nice balance of sweet chocolate and deep roasted flavor that somewhat dominates the palate. Slightly bitter with a subtle lactic creaminess. With all of the dark roasted malts the body is still slightly thin and the nut profile and roasted bitter notes are a bit much. I wish the sweetness was a little more prominent creating more balance. Pretty complex for a British brown ale but still kind of underwhelming."
"Drinkability: It's fairly decent and delightfully nutty, like many of my ex-girlfriends. While nothing beyond the label and name inspires any Christmastime imagery, it is a decent, well-balanced ale regardless of season."
"A good English-style ale with a lot of malt flavor for its size. Twelve Days pours a deep ruby with a small, creamy, off-white head. The aroma is mostly caramel malt with some earthy tones. There's probably a touch of English hops in there but it's light. It's somewhere between a bock and a good English brown ale. The flavor is relatively sweet but nowhere near cloying. I can see what they're getting at with the ""nutty"" descriptor, but it's more earth to my palate. The mouthfeel gets pretty thin as I drain the glass. I imagine it's a lot better from a cask."
" M- This beer has a medium mouthfeel with no alcohol heat. D- A little fruity i the dark malts but thin until the bitter finish."
"D - A very easy drinking beer that has decent flavor and drinkability. A typical English ale really. I don't get why it's Christmas, but it's decent nonetheless."
"Drinkability is just OK as this is a bit one sided on the sugary maltyness."
"Tasty, drinkable bottle obtained recently from Premiere Gourmet. Pours reddish brown with spicey nose. Nicely integrated spiciness, though not thick mouthfeel, caramel makes it a breeze to drink. Reports in nicely with its a.b.v. you can still function. Satisfying aftertaste. A bit of ginger and cinammon."
"The regular price of US$4.99 would be money well spent!"
"I've had this bottle sitting in my cellar since middle of last year. After reading some of the other reviews I was expecting this to be lacking in body and flavour, but I was surprised. Maybe this needs to age? Overall, great malt, nice but not overwhelming fruity hops (I'm not big on super-hopped stuff) and a great full flavour. Typically I'm drinking stuff in the higher alcohol range so I wasn't expecting as solid a beer in an ale that's (only) 5.5%."
"Pint+0.9. A pretty dark amber pour, limited white head arises. Very nice malty aroma, some caramel and rainin. Maltiness is not quite a prominent, there are some piney hops and spice that balance out the sweet malt. A little peaty, roast nut with some very limited red fruits. A little thin, but exteamly drinkable. Somewhat smokey or roast finish that lingers a bit. Not bad and quite sessionable if available in that capacity."
"This is, like most english beers, a medium bodied beer that is smooth on the palate and easy to drink. This is a friendly drinkable ale that should make any holiday festival a bit more jolly."
"D, notes: I would not define this as a strong ale...maybe a kicked up brown. Still good though."
"A bold beer this is, 'dark and strong'as the label states."
"Very drinkable english-style beer. Might need to buy this again if i can get my hands on it."
"Labeled as a Christmas ale."
"Good drinkable beer."
"Some more body and a little less metal in the aftertaste, this would be a very fine winter ale."
"Pours a deep amber/ brown-ish color with a small tan head. In the aroma, small roastiness, nutty, and small citrus like hops. In the taste, sweet roastiness, dry nuttiness, citrus like hops but not too bitter. A faint bitterness and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry piney/ citrus hops in the aftertaste. A step above from a standard English warmer with nice hop presence, quite nice."
"This is a very good Christmas beer. It has elements of a porter and a brown ale. Well balanced and flavorful."
"Nice chestnut brown color. No real carbonation to speak of. Malty enough aroma with a somewhat spicy tinge to it-hard to pin down exaclty what you are smelling. Somewhat cinnamon/orange like. Solid malt flavor-rather earthy and nutty. Again a faint spice flavor though nothing stands out. Decent body-rather dry in the finish. A decent effort for sure. Gotta love how the Brits pack a lot of flavor in a lower abv."
"D- Good beer; a bit lighter than expected, but would be good when I want an English Strong Ale with a lower abv."
"Twelve Days English Christmas Ale is both delicious and highly drinkable. Bombastic Big Beer is all well and good, but restraint is sometimes the way to go. For what it's worth, I've had this bottle for more than a year and it has held up beautifully. Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good nap."
"Pours a clear brown with no head. The nose stays mostly caramel. Nice smooth and even earthy and leafy character on the flavor profile. Smooth feel, but not a mess of carbonation. A very nice ale. It's even and smooth which makes it a great one to try."
"Aroma is strong and richly malty with a strong overtone of brown sugar. It pours a clear dark brown with a thick, fine-bubbled, off-white head that stays around. Flavor is malty with ribbons of brown sugar or molasses and smoky and nutty hints. Aftertaste is rather sweet but not cloying; there is just a whisper of hop bitterness. A delightful ale."
"Notes: I wouldn't classify this as approachable even with its laid back style. It has some issues with the bitter side that doesn't translate well on the palate. Malt bill is the best part of this and would make it worthy if they can figure out the other side. Pass."
"A tasty, very drinkable, smooth, malt-accented with a nice, spicy hop touch, English ale."
"Pours chestnut with a thin head that fades to a ring. Caramel aromas as well as a nuttiness, and slightly spicy. Tastes of hazlenuts and cream with a slight sweetness. Round and mild.Smooth and creamy mouthfeel, and very easy to drink. This is a very mild Christmas brew, but a nice change of pace."
"Drinks really nice, shame this was about $6 a pint. One of the best winter beers I've had this year (so far)!"
"The guys at Cloverleaf Wine really pushed this beer as something great. I'm skeptical of British beers because they usually lack the strong flavors of American brews. However, I was pleasantly surprised with this beer. As a Christmas beer, the appearance is reminiscent of liquid gingerbread. The aroma is spicy and sweet. The taste is very nice like spice cookies with some notes of caramel and chocolate. The mouthfeel is fine - nothing objectionable with the carbonation. This is a nice Christmas beer - easy drinking with very nice flavors. Recommended."
"Pours clear reddish-brown with a slim finger of head and light lacing. Smells of nutty toasted malts and gentle herbal hops. Flavor is more malt-forward. A base of toasted caramel malt develops nutty and doughy notes in the center and slightly bitter herbal hop and hard water tones in the finish. Faintly smoky aftertaste lingers. Body is creamy and medium-light, with only slight carbonation. Pleasant but not particularly noteworthy."
"I like this English ale, but one is enough at a time."
"Poured from a unique-looking bottle into a pint glass. The beer was dark brown, clear, with a thin head. The aroma was mostly toasted malt, biscuity and nutty. Same with the flavor, toasted and burnt malts and a hint of some light fruits. The beer was full-bodied and filling, nicely complex but not really my style."
"The pour is a somewhat hazy reddish brown with a modest light tan creamy head that fails quickly leaving a velum like coating of lace. Nose has a sweet rich malt aroma, caramel, and a bit of hops, spicy and pleasant. Front is quite sweet, decently malted, with a touch of the bittering hops at the back, moderate in feel. Finish has a fair to middling acidity, the hops delectable in their spiciness, sweet and dry aftertaste lingers long on the palate, a quite nice beer."
"Drinkability- Not a great example of the style, but quite drinkable."
"I wonder to what degree the apparent perfection of this beer depends on its freshness. (It just arrived from England by way of normal state distribution.) The aromas of this reddish brown liquid are an alluring mixture of caramel malts, vanilla, cream, butter, baked red apples, red currants, sweet strawberries, brown bread crust, mashed hazelnuts and almonds, coffee and straw. Voluptuous creamy texture with a biscuity crumb lifts the bread and fruit flavors until they meet with oozing bitter tannins. The resolution is bright and fresh, bittersweet, and fascinating. Irresistable texture and organization. Astonishing drinkability."
"recommended."
"Easily a session beer as it is somewhat thin bodied and lighter in flavors."
"Pours a clear deep reddish brown. Cheery wood. No head to speak of. Aroma is sugary sweet. Candied pears. Taste is lightly toasted grain and mild pear- not nearly as slick and syrupy as expected. Body is medium. Aftertaste has a bit of an astringent bite, but that fades rather quickly into a tart(?) slightly sour(?). Rather nice. Not sure if 5.5% qualifies as a strong ale, but I was not disappointed. Ha! I just noticed the pears on the front label I guess the pear was intentional!"
"M&D: softly-carbonated for a bottled ale, and the body is just medium for its alc. strength. Overall this is a quality nut-malty as well as fruity premium bitter, and the ideal body and balanced flavour make it a more-ish pint to enjoy."
"A strong porter - chesnuts, caramel, woodsmoke, dried fruit like raisins, fits in perfectly with the holidays as a warming, thick brew -I'm not much of a porter lover, but this was quite drinkable. Bottle tasted only. Color is bread crust brown, texture is very smooth"
"D- A very sessionable ale, however nothing that suggests its something out of the ordinary."
