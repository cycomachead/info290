"O: A pretty good brew, though like many I&G beers not quite perfect. So-so looks; shame the head disappears too rapidly. The aroma and flavour are a pleasant mix of caramel malt, dried fruit, yeast esters and mild woodiness. The cherrywood adds something but the effect is subtle. Body is OK. The biggest problem is that the character seems too clean and polished - I reckon bottle conditioning would add a layer of complexity that would give it a boost. However, it goes down easily enough on a winter's evening. Worth trying if you come across it."
"M- Thick bodied and slightly syrupy, yet with plenty of carbonation to keep my palate relatively cleansed!  The flavors are robust and full, and never let you truly forget what you are tasting....I feel like this could be part of a compote for pancakes or something breakfasty.  I like it, but not quite to the same extent as other I&G fare.....still, a very good beer that is innovative, using the Canadian Cherrywood and it doesn't disappoint!"

"Overall, it's another great beer by I&G. Well-balanced and no traces of alcohol despite its 8.3 ABV"

"O – Once again Innis and Gunn have produced a winner for me. Smooth and flavoursome this is a wonderful Ale and I find it to be very good with Potato and leek dishes. If you are vegetarian then this is a great beer to drink with a stew."
"o: expected a lot more from this one.  i'm rather disappointed"

"Overall: I quite enjoyed this beer. I am a Scottish Canadian so I felt it represented both very well. The cherrywood adds a nice twist to the regular oak aged Innis & Gunn. It's a kind of beer where you would like 2 or 3 at the pub watching the game."

"Served from the bottle at the Toronto Festival of Beer, this like several I&G offerings hit me as immediately really overwhelmingly sweet, with a woody vanilla tone, a lot of candied woody character, you definitely pick up a lot of the cherry wood aspects, which is interesting but also frustratingly overpowering, I found it too sweet and woody in comparison to some of the other things they have done."
"Overall - One of the better and more enjoyable ones from I&G, but still doesn't blow me away like the original did when I first had it, but with some slightly different nuances and a well hidden ABV, you could do far worse than this. At its price point, a definite try for I&G fans"

"A nice beer and similar in a lot of ways to the breweries original beer. Smooth and quite easy to drink despite the huge alcohol content and the touches of alcohol dotted throughout the taste. Sweet and sugary with plenty going on to keep me interested and the warming alcohol feel to the palate was very nice."
"Overall, it's a lovely idea that wasn't executed well."

"Bottle: Poured a clear but dark amber color ale with a small foamy head with average retention and some lacing. Aroma of sweet malt notes with light woody notes. Taste is also quiet sweet which probably originated from the maple syrup. Body is light with medium carbonation. Too sweet for the style but nice used of cherry wood."

"O - its a tasty brew with both the cherry and the wood making itself known, maybe a little too sweet for some but it suits me just fine"

"Very enjoyable."
"I could drink this one again no problem, not overly complex but has a nice mix of flavors and very easy to drink for 8.3%"

"Overall, a decent, somewhat complex beer but it still misses the mark for me. The sweetness is a bit much and somewhat limits drinkability. Still, a nice effort by Innis and Gunn."
"Quite good.My favorite from the brewery."

"As a beverage is rates higher than how it matches the style but no one will complain."
""
"Carbonation could be higher."
""
""
""
"Overall could have been a bit thicker but I found it very smooth, tasty oak aged old ale. Well worth the 6 dollar price for more than a bombers worth."
""
""
"Overall - Okay I guess.. perhaps a little cloying in a way. Something about reminds me of an icewine flavour wise. Anyways, worth a shot - but wouldn't pick up again."

"O/D - That medicinal note was a bit off putting and the cherry note came out as blueberry later too. Althought it wasn't too bad, it didn't impress me all that much."
"Bought this because my wife has a soft spot for maple beers. Pleasantly surprised. Can't taste much hops or maple. Sweet cherry predominates. First sip seems a bit too sweet but after that it just becomes delicious. You can certainly taste the alcohol, but it's very drinkable. Although others suggest it as a dessert wine we had it with sweet and savory pizza with good results. I will definitely buy again."
"Overall, this was a great beer. I wish this was more readily available around me so that I could always have it in reserve when I want to take a break from my standard IPA for something on the sweeter side. This beer would also pair well with a smoked pulled pork, or a thick hunk of pork belly."

"Mouthfeel - Medium body, low carbonation. Feels sort of like watery syrup."

"Had this beer on tap at a local pub with fish & chips. Not much of a head with a little lacing. This was a very light tasting beer with a distinct cherrywood flavor. Somewhat woody but too sweet for my liking. Overall the beer went down pretty smooth and would make a good sipping ale for the summertime."
"Overall this beer was somewhat of a let down, and I probably won't buy this again. I still hold hope for the company though."
""
"Overall – A rather enjoyable brew overall. It is sweet of maple, fruit and other sugars but is balanced out by some of the wood, boozy and biscuit malt flavors of the brew. A nice one to give a go to."
"Found this beer on display in my local distributor. Intrigued by the cherrywood. Cracked it open with a friend and was immediately impressed by the thick reddish head. Poured it into a pint glass and admired its coppery red/ orange color. Took a sip and absolutely loved it. Not sure about tasting any cherrywood but definitely a lot going on. Slightly sweet with a touch of the alcohol. Nice mouthfeel and goes down smooth. Recommend it!"

"750 ml bottle. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours a clear copper color with an inch light tan head. Head retention and lacing are both decent enough. The brew smells like cherries, wood, maple, and bready malt. I think the taste mostly follows the aroma, with the cherry and wood flavors being the strongest. It's a sweet, fruity ale. There's also some caramel and candied fruit flavors noticeable. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick and creamy with moderate carbonation. I liked this brew, it's definitely worth a try. $7.99 a bottle."

"The 1 pint, 9 oz. bottle took a long time to down and much of it had to do with the alcohol. It could be viewed as too similar to the other, more popular beers from these guys but for me, this was a nice example of what an English Strong Ale should be. The hops aren't here but everything else is and someone looking for a good dessert beer to split without the sour tartness of the cherries would be wise to start here. Innis and Gunn beers are different and not for everyone but those who are patient will be well rewarded with a subtly smooth and strong beer that's worth the time it takes to finish it off."
""
"Much like the rum cask version of Innis and Gunn, this fits solidly into the ""after dinner"" beer category. A sweet, malt-forward ale that's not all that complex but quite enjoyable."
" I like that taste. It's honestly difficult to say what's going on, but rest assured i like it. Still, a bit sweet."
"Overall a full flavored but fairly light bodied beer. Not my favorite from I&G, but a good beer to pair with a variety of cuisine."

"Pours ruby red with a nice white red head. The smell is a cherry oak smell that is very pleasant. Actually I really didn't think this would be all that good but from the look and smell it seems it could be ok. The taste is better than ok by far. It's a very smooth drinkable beer with hints of sweet cherry. Kind of an oak presence that fit very well too. Overall, I went from thinking of this as a gimmic beer to one that I would definitely buy again. Nice work by Innis & Gunn, which I haven't had much of before, but will try more now."

"Very much an Innis and Gunn beer - all of their limited editions are really just twists off of their malty, complex, sweet wood style of brewing. This is no different. I'm really not sure what the cherrywood is giving to the equation - there's maybe a light amount of cherry flavor but that might be me imagining it due to the cherry on the label - but the maple syrup contributes a nice amount of complexity to the finish. Very tasty, as expected from I&G, but doesn't bring too much new to the table."
"O: Very enjoyable. a desert beer for sure. lots of bright fruit and can be quite complex /82"
"Overall: nice enough. Not sure what the cherrywood treatment has done for it. Tasty."

"For what it's worth, if you're ok with the sweetness, this is one almost slavish ode to Canadian sensibilities, which I'm sure was the intent all along. Maple, wood, and strong beer - what's a hoser not to like, other than that this happens to be made outside our borders? Imitation is the sincerest form, and all that, I suppose."
