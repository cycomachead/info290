"O-Cooperstown most flavorful brew but the balance and all of the other factors do not make this the best."

"Clear looking mahogany brown with a loose, thin tan head. This beer doesn't have great lacing and looses its head relatively quickly. The beer smells like a strong ale with a sweet malt base and some biting alcohol. There is a touch of fruitiness in the nose, but it's not delicate and refined like a Belgian. The taste is slightly sweet toasty/chocolatiness with some biting alcohol. The mouthfeel is all wrong and completely off balance. Overall I would suggest that you do not seek out this beer because clearly it's not made for the general beer drinker...it's made for someone interested in sucking down an unrefined mess of beer-related flavors."

"Overall with better examples of the style I am torn to hate this but it did drink very well for a Strong ale."

"O: To me, this style always tastes like the wort from a Belgian ale without the adjunct spices, and that's what i'm getting from this beer. It's like a half-baked Belgian ale. It's o.k., just not something i'm gushing about."

"Taste is quite good, I am surprised by this one! Dark fruits and alcohol go together nicely. Brown Ale-esque maltiness throws down a nice base layer for a pretty hefty mineral aspect. Looking at the label and brewery, I was thinking this one would be a little on the gimmicky side...ok...alot on the gimmicky side; but this is quite a nice little treat that shows some nice depth and some solid UK characteristics. Mouthfeel is velvety and lowly carbonated. Chad obviously knows what he’s doing sending this one around :)"
"O: Overall very nice. Tasty, and certainly interesting."
"Medium mouthfeel with low carbonation. Highly drinkable. Maybe that's why I got a case of it! Recommended."
"O: very enjoyable ale. Another good beer from a regional brewer."
"O: A little flavorful, goes down ok, not too filling, good kick, decent representation of style, it’s not too bad but there are others in the style that I would choose first."
"O: It actually started off nicely, but by the time I finished, it was not as good. The buttery flavor was a bit overpowering."
"Overall: Not a bad brew but I wouldn't recommend."
"Overall: It really wasn't special. It certainly does not stand out for a Strong Ale. Unfortunately, disappointing."
"The best beer from Cooperstown Brewing, IMO. Well-balanced, flavorful...all over a very good brew. Pours slightly reddish-brown with a bit of a white head that mostly dissipates. Rich, malty nose with some fruity sweetness. Taste of malts and implications of dark, dried fruits. Medium mouthfeel, and nicely drinkable. Light overall, but with lots of character. Had no problem taking a few home with me."
"i wouldnt drink this again..."
"O: Meh beer, probably wouldn't bother getting again. It's cheap though."
"It's sweet, but not like the smell. Also, there's a good dollop of bittering hop that gives this some balance. Very rich body with a low level of carbonation. The malt has a good biscuit and white bread (lightly toasted). This is one of the better Strong Ales I've ever had."
"I live just an hour and a half from Cooperstown, so I see their beer on the shelves all the time, but have never before today committed to buying any of their products. Next time I go on a beer run, I'll for sure be seeking more of this out."
"Notes: This beer is well made and dangerously drinkable."
"D. A pretty good brew. It warms the tongue a little and the flavor lasts a decent time. The only negative is that it is a little sweet for me."
"Pours an effervescent copper color with a huge towering head that dies away relatively quickly. The aroma is mostly bready maltiness which is sweet and nutty around the edges. The flavor is also very bready/nutty. A bit of that 7.7% ABV shows. The body is medium and carbonation is lower than the pour had me anticipating. Overall this is a nice little brown ale that is pretty drinkable for the ABV."
"Notes: A great beer from an upstate New York brewery. I think this is one of the best offerings Cooperstown brings to the table."
"Thanks to Doug and Eric who threw this in on a beer trade. Clear copper pour with decent head and lacing. Nice malty nose with lots of toffee, brown sugar and just a touch of alcohol. The taste evolves as this beer warms. Lots of nice toasty caramel, maple syrup, brown sugar, with a hint of nuttiness to it. Just a touch of bitterness on the finish to balance it out. The slightly higher alcohol is really well hidden which makes this extremely drinkable. Reminded me of sitting in a pub in London. Really a well done beer and unexpected surprise from a great beer trade!"
"single pickup from Westmere, Albany"
"D - Fairly drinkable. Strong taste holds me back, especially since the flavor sticks around for so long."
"D- a decent beer from a rather unknown brewery (at least in my neck of the woods). id check this one out again if i get the chance. having six different beers in their mixed 12 pack makes picking it up easy for an out of towner like myself."
"Enjoyed on tap at the Tap Room / Colgate Inn in Hamilton, NY, this one shows a dark copper color with a decent white cover and good lacing. The aroma brings honey banana toffee, pleasant but not very strong. The flavor matched the aroma with much more force. There's cider mash and maple sugar with an herbal hop touch. It's medium bodied and medium drinkable. A hint of alcohol. Very interesting, a worthy entry. Somewhat of a cough medicine taste or maybe bourbon inflected. I would like to try again, not a barn burner but different and enjoyable enough."
"Something ""dirty"" about it, and it has a perfumy presence. On the weak side of things... It's not ""bad", just not more than mediocre-ish, IMO. An odd, but not bad, brew."
"Drinkability: Relatively inexpensive, tasty, and should be a great sipper for when the weather starts getting cold here, which will be soon."
"This brew is VERY drinkable, an extremely tasty English Strong Ale, and at 7.7% abv, it's one of those that is so tasty and enjoyable to drink that you have to pace yourself ... I'm sure that the abv would catch up to you quickly!"
"Looks like Dr. Pepper with little carbonation. Sweet aroma of malt and a little molasses maybe. I really like the malt balance on this one and the sweetness is just right. Finishes with a little bitterness and just a hint of spice, which is nice and unexpected. This is the best that Cooperstown brewing offered. Really enjoyed this one and glad I brought a sixer back."
"Love it. I thoroughly enjoyed my 6pack of this. Make sure to allow the temp up. Looking forward to many more."
"notes and comments- medium-length citrusy finish like malty apples. this is a unique beer that us west coasters can't find."
"Overall - I've had a number of beers from Cooperstown and every single one that I had yielded an exploding head that required me to wait to finish pouring. Worse yet, every single one has a very strange perfumey and flowery aroma that seems very off flavored. Furthermore, when looking at the sediment left behind, I see a collection of pinhead sized ""pellets"" on the bottom of the bottles. I wonder if these ""pellets"" are infectious colonies of bacteria/yeast but I see these in each bottle that I had."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Pours a thick tan head that thins but sticks around. Color is an unfiltered reddish brown. Smells a of ripe apple with a bit of hops and malt. Tastes great in two phases. Starts out thin and crisp and then gets stronger at the end. Apples mildly the whole way and strong malt at the end with a touch of hop bitterness. Gets better with every sip. Stays in your mouth, but isn't over powering."
"this beer pours a nice brown copper color with a thick off white head that recedes to patchy lace that clings to the glass. the aroma presents a lot of sweet malt and fruit esters, with a touch of hops in the background. the taste follows with a decent amount of caramel and crystal malt up front finishing with some hop bitterness, the bit of warmth on the way down is nice, in conjunction with the medium body and good co2. a decent beer, and one that I look forward to having again."
"D: A decent offering, and an interesting style choice. When all is said and done, it's a fairly tasty brew and it smells great. I did find it a bit boozy as it went, so it's not the most accessable beer, but worth trying or having a couple."
"Definitely one of the brewer's best beers."
"Notes: This is my favorite Cooperstown Brewing Company beer."
"M&D: Average beer for your summer BBQ. Crisp and refreshing and best served supper cold. A nice alternative to your typical macro-brewed ale."
"This poured a clear copper color with a little bit of off-white head. It smelled like lots of caramel and roasted malts, with a bit of lemon hops. It tasted like strong orange and lemon hops mixed with sweet malt, and had a bit of alcohol flavor. It was watery with some carbonation, and had a sour aftertaste. Overall this had more flavor and complexity than the other Cooperstown brews, but it wasn't an overly enjoyable flavor or complexity. Keep trying."
"Smells very caramelly and sweet. Got my tastebuds ready for some serious residual sugars, however the taste, though on the sweet side, was nowhere near as sweet as expected. Mostly malts and fruit in the flavor. Surprisingly smooth and mellow considering the ABV. I thought this was one of Cooperstown's better offerings."
"Thanks to hyland24 for pulling this from the upstate connections. Poured an apricot color with golden hues lining the egdes of the glass. Had an unmistakable ""Big Apple"" aroma. Reminded me of walking in an apple orchard. The taste was sweet apples up front with a mild bitter finish. Was not like a cider but more like a bubbly apple wine. Had a very light and bubbly mouthfeel will be a great summer beer."
"S - Surprisingly drinkable for the abv., but just not very interesting flavour-wise."
"MF&D - Medium bodied ale. Good carbonation gives this ale a crisp mouth feel. Although ABV is 7.70% I felt this ale went down well."
"Poured reddish-amber into a nonic. Complete with a half-inch of white foam that dissipated quickly. The aroma was of bread and butter. A malty brew, with hints of caramel. The bread and butter undertones shine through. An almost salty taste also came out. The bread theme that this beer seems to have taken on shine through even through the feel. An almost bready chew on this brew. I can't say I'm looking forward to finishing the other bottle of this pair that came with my mixed pack. Bread and butter."
"Mouthfeel is nearly full-bodied, and the carbonation is not very aggressive which makes it smooth and soft on the palate. I'm not sure I'd have more than one of these in a sitting, but this is a really interesting and tasty brew that I'd have again if given the chance. Definitely worth a try."
"Pours a light amber hue with a 1.5 finger off-white head that slowly dies down to a thin frothy layer. Stickiness is pretty nice, holds on well to the sides. Smell is that Cooperstown ringwood yeast, caramel malt, roasted nuts, raisins, and hint of booze. Taste is pretty woody with some smoked nut flavors. Hints of vanilla seem a bit out of place but are quite strong. Butter and yeast are in the aftertaste and linger for quite a while. Medium bodied with a mild amount of carbonation, a bit dry in the mouth. Pretty decent brew, just like Middle Ages with their ringwood yeast. If their brews aren't your thing, avoid this beer."
" The 7.70% ABV is a bit too high, and it can be felt pretty easily after a sip or two. Not to worry, it doesn't stand out or overpower the beers flavor in any way. One thing I noticed is that many reviewers said this had a buttery feel to it. I can't really detect it, but the subtlety of the flavors combines to give this a pretty amazing amount of depth. It's a shame that there's only two of these in the 6-pack that I was given, since Cooperstown's got a winner her. Any chance that this is what the Rockies have been drinking the last 3 weeks?"
"If you like Newcastle Brown, get this, you won't be sorry."
"I wouldn't be the least bit surprised if Pride of Milford has an intensely loyal following in Cooperstown and its environs. It isn't an ale that one could drink in quantity while taking in a double-header, but is more of a 'thinking man's' beer. If I had another bottle or two right now, I have no doubt that I could understand and explain the infield fly rule. Gotta love those baseball caps. Thanks BeerTruth."
"This is a nice brew from Cooperstown. I wasn't thrilled with it at first but it simply needed some time to warm up and let the flavours and aromas come out, so If you are poured one and it seems a bit too chilled, do the same."
"Pours a clear brown/copper, thin off white head, leaves some solid lacing, good retention, nice layer. Smell is very sweet, caramelized, very fruity, nice dose of alcohol, sherry, very malty and strong. Taste is similar, sweet brown sugar/caramel front, sherry, some citrus, malty as all hell, fruit and alcohol. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with low carbonation, warms going down, nice and smooth. Very surprisingly good!"
"I cant quite put my finger on the taste of this beer but either the lines need to be cleaned on the tap or it has gone bad. If I try it in the bottle I might change my tune."
"Pours a transparent but muddy orange brown colour and maintained a short, but steady level of head. The body is a little thin not boasting any harsh of dominant qualities. The aroma is incredibly sweet with notes of raisins, dates, fermented berries. The flavours mimic the aroma with a similar sweetness in the aftertaste that rings out for a few seconds then seems to disappear. This works as a good winter warmer, the malt bill is very complex. Also notes of oak. No suggestion as to the alcohol percentage. There's not much roast, not much bitterness, or alcohol sting. What there is a lovely soft brandy/sherry complex. I liked it a lot."
"Wow, this is a diacetyl mess. Loads of butterscotch dominate the flavor alongside some grape esters. Way too buttery for my tastes. Hopefully this was a bad bottle. Down the drain you go"
"A decent beer but my have lost a little alcohol cover sitting in my basement for a year."
"D: A poor taste and high alcohol assist in making this beer not very drinkable. I will not purchase this beer again. Hands down the worst of the Cooperstown Brewing Co. options."
"Also, be sure you do not bypass this brewery if you're in Cooperstown to visit the Hall of Fame and Ommegang. It's a hidden gem. Great people and great beer."
"Trull an excellent beer. Its ability to session is limited by its completely hidden alcohol content. Great job."
"D - A very good style-selection...I'd like to pick up a few and hold on to them for awhile."
"Helllooo ringwood. Beer pours a nice red amber with white head. Right off the bat, this sucker smells and tastes of ringwood and not much else. I, for one, am a fan of the yeast so this is a good deal. I'm sure there's some malt in there, but I've mostly got tastes of creamy fruit with only a hint of butterscotch. It's good to see the big D hasn't taken over this beer. Very smooth drinking and no hint of the 7.7% abv."
"Thanks, palma, for the opportunity"
"Density is very thick and chunky. Remains on the palate for a little while, but has a smooth aftertaste. The fact that the carbonation is slight on the tongue is a bonus. As strong as this is, it is surprisingly easy to drink. Has a perfect combination of thickness and drinkability."
"Mouth feel is medium in body and is mildly carbonated."
"This is the first beer I have reviewed. I thoroughly enjoyed this with beer with dinner, but am not getting the same taste experience now that I am not breaking it up with bites of food. I like its clear, amber color. As for smell, maybe I should have smelled it before tasting it, because now, I experience very little aroma by sniffing, but what I get is subtle fruit and caramel. I deceded to grab some food (turkey breast) to enhance the drinking experience. This helps. I really enjoy the taste. It's not terribly complex to me--mostly caramelish malt, yet I've never had a beer quite like it. The alcohol is making me tipsy, and I wouldn't have guessed it to be 7.7%, based on the taste. Rating numerically seems a bit misguided to me. The mouthfeel is what it is--nothing astouding, but to me. perfect for this beer. The last sip was a pleasure, as well as the mellow aftertaste, which I will take to my bed, if it lasts after I brush my teeth! Well, I've had quite a delicious time with this, and I encourage you all to try it. It also seems like a ""safe"" beer to offer all kinds of friends; there's nothing eccentric, extreme. or weird about it. Now that the glass has been empty for a few minutes, I am tasting the yeast; it's a subtle aftertaste--nice, even though I don't usually like the taste of most yeasts. Well, I think you can see why I chose my handle, and thanks for allowing me to share my novice beer-drinking experience with you."
"Notes: A tasty strong ale, the Ringwood was kept under control here. My favorite from this brewery so far."
"Another fine Englsih inspired beer from Cooperstown ""other"" brewery."
"Drinkability: The ale is quite drinkable with an ABV that sneaks up on you."
"Notes: The picture is of the owner when he was young. He grew up in Milford, NY and played little league there."
"Drinkability: very good. Personally a definite session beer for me, one of the better brews from Cooperstown."
"Malty and strong yet very smooth and mellow. Very easy to handle for a strong ale. The ringwood yeast is used really well here too...not overdone in any way. Pretty interesting."
"On tap and later in a bottle, this brew is strong and assertive. It does mellow the more you drink it- maybe due to warming a bit or because it's high alcohol content (both I guess). It has a very sweet almost honey like aroma. Taste is also on the sweeter side, really seems made in the style of an English Strong Ale(which is what is it supposed to be). Carmel predominates in this beer. It's a little too one-sided, made to be strong, yet kind of a one hit wonder. Not a bad beer by any means. It's enjoyable when one is in the mood for a strong ale. I like that American brewers are trying to make different styles of ale like this one."
"this one is tasty and very drinkable (if you dont mind the ringwood yeast strain, it doesnt bother me personally...) - but watch the ABV. I'll buy this one again, maybe not in the spring or summer but in the fall for sure."
"Purchased at Sam the Beer Man in Binghamton. This beer pours a translucent amber color with a bubbly off white head and thick lacing. The aroma is of toasted malts with some sweetness, maybe a bit lemony. The first taste gives you a bit of bitterness but mostly toasted malts and caramel that is very enjoyable and drinkable. The beer has a nice bit of carbanation that reminds me of the texture of a beer like Duvel but with different taste. With an abv approaching 8% this beer is deceiving as it is approachable."
"A warming thanks to syrbeer for the samples!!"
"Overall: A nice strong ale that has a great drinkability for its ABV. Not my favorite, but definitely a good one to try."
"A tame yet flavorful Old Ale. The complexities of flavor makes this version of the style quite interesting. I would strongly consider this as a session beer. My favorite Cooperstown offering to date."
"Still, it is a good overall beer and the alcohol is hidden very nicely. It's a good beer to sip and enjoy, but watch out, because this guy is stronger than you'd think. A good deal too, at about $5-$6 for a sixer. A good New York beer and one that I will purchase again, but only if I can't find it on-tap."
"Spicy yeast lager. Carbonated head. Ringwood yeast, bit of fruit and almond and somewhat bitterness. Like an xmas ale of the second tier of brewers. Hops, alcohol which dries out mouth. Medium mouthfeel. Lots of malts contribute to sweetish aftertaste."
"Sweet malt, toffee, plums, & hints of vanilla. Off dry finish with a hint of citrusy American hops. Medium bodied, relaxed carbonation. Interesting, but not something I would seek out."
"Notes: For some reason, I love playing battlefield when Im drinking this beer."
"Pours a deep copper color. Not much head but very tiny bubbles. OK lace. Smells of apple with some caramel, raisin and vanilla. Slight alcohol smell. Taste is very similar to the smell except that the alcoho; is a bit more pronounced, with a nice hop bitterness. Nicely balanced. Finishes a bit dry. Overall a decent beer."
"Pours a great deep copper with a two finger head that leaves a trail of lace down the glass,big malty aroma sweet and caramely with some brown sugar in there.Taste has a smokiness to it some clove and bubblgum quite odd for the style but very tasty I get a late smokiness that lingers well.Hmm great flavors for a dark wheat beer but for a strong ale quite unique a beer to savor I love it I wish I had more damn it!."
"What is it, anyway? ""english strong""? It seems to me that it is like an American rendition of a Scottish heavy ale."
"Pours a clear woody-brown color with a thin, white head. Teriffic aromaserious malt smells. Just a hint of alcohol in the nose. Theres a grist-like, sugary smell, mixed with yeast and fruit (blackberries?)molassessort of reminiscent of a barley-wine. Just great!! Its got a little slick oiliness, but it fits right in to the beers character. Hoppy and bitter finish. I didnt know what to expect from this beer, and it sat on the back of my beer shelf for a long time after I bought it. That was my loss. This is fantastic!!"
"Wyll-"
"Orange/amber in color with a good off white head. A tasty whiff of malty sweetness in the aroma. The maltiness is the previlent characteristic with a little bit of smooth bitterness at the back of the tongue. But it is the malty sweetness the sets up home on the middle of your tongue, probably hely ther by the higher alcohol. A tasty gem."
"This strong ale pours a dark, very clear, amber, almost red, with a thin tan head. There is little or no lacing, and the aroma is sweet and peaty pruniness. Not surprisingly the taste is very earthy and heavy, and the mouthfeel is coincidentally medium heavy with a fair amount of carbonation."
"Comments  OldFroth never ceases to amaze me. This gem from PA was an education of the palette."
"Poured vigorously to get a small off white head that quickly faded to a patchy film. Creamy butterscotch aroma almost too buttery, not inviting. Clear, dark iced tea colored beer with some fine carbonation floating up through it. Sweet malts, butterscotch, lightly bitter finish. Moderately full body, but a little too sweet and one sided. I'm not sure if this beer is bad or not, it definitely seems off, but not as bad as the Back Yard IPA I just poured down the drain. I bought singles of the other beers they make and drank them a week ago and they were all fine. I like my butterscotch flavors as much as the next guy (Mmm MIddle Ages), but this is a bit much. I'm dissapointed :-("
"Deep amber pour with a creamy head. A deep aroma flows with tones of caramel and toffee with and underneath of light spice. The body is extra smooth and heavy strongly supporting a buttery toffee flavor which predominates a mellow bitterness. Very tasty and well-balanced with a creamy finish."
"Pours clear ruby red, medium tan head that slightly lasts, good lacing, tons of bubbles in the body. Aroma is buttery, fruity, and some caramel. Flavor is slightly fruity, buttery, light caramel. Body is medium, fairly dry. The second bottle I had of this was much warmer than the first, and the flavors and drinkability were much better when warmer (about 60 vs 45 or so for the first bottle)."
"Note: This is not the type of beer I would tend to drink on its own; I need a pairing to work with the crisp hoppiness. However, I have not yet found a beer that pairs up better with pizza. I don't have the most discerning palate yet, but it seems to me as though the malt flavor is linking up with the wheat in the crust. If I were rating this beer as a pizza companion I'd give it a 5 for drinkability, but for a general rating I had to score it lower."
"The color as it pours from the bottle a deep ruby to almost brown color with a portly light tan head, lace is a nice thin coating on the glass. Malt dominates the nose, but I do get a hint of yeast, well maybe it just the extra malt that makes me think that? Start is sweet, malt loaded, top is medium in its feel and the finish spicy in the hop category, the acidity mild. A nice dry long lasting aftertaste and a nice drinkable beer."
"Special thanks to Johnny P for this dandy"
"609"
"This beer had a medium sized tan head with fine-large bubbles that was mostly diminishing.The body of this beer was clear with a little bit of carbonation observed.The hue was reddish-copper and there was no lacing.The nose was malt and alcohol and the flavor was malty and a little bitter from start to finish.The mouthfeel was tingly, smooth texture and light bodied.At 7.7% ABV the alcohol was not overpowering in my opinion."
"The flavor is rich and malty, with a light hopping in the back. Mouthfeel is smooth and a little slick, with an alcoholic warmth coming through the middle and finishing the beer with mild hop bitterness. Very estery, with a hint of paint thinner astringency, although not a bad thing. Hints of plum, apple, and apricot. Tasty and complex. Great malt and hop balance, while retaining a sweet, decadent feel. I'm definitely enjoying this beer"
"The beer pours a dark golden to light amber color with a white lace head. The aroma is a very refreshing fruity malt smell. I love this quality in beers. It tastes light with a med. addition of caramel malts. It is high in alcohol boasting 7.7% abv. , but is still very drinkable. A good beer to drink cold. I didn't detect much in the line of high powered hopping for either flavor or aroma. Overall, this is not a bad beer, but not the best that Cooperstown has to offer. It could do a little more with better head retention, higher hopping, and a larger aray of malt complexity, but how many beers do you know that could do the same."
"Good head that dissipates fairly quickly, some carbonation, but no lace. Nearly clear reddish amber color with a sweet smell of malts and initial taste is malty with a complex of flavors but finish is hoppy. Goes good with tortilla chips and medium salsa."
"Gotta thank Davo for sharing some baseball history with me."
"I agree with VENOM - this beer has a lot of the same flavor notes as Geary's Hampshire Ale, with an added benefit of being available fresh year round. Very smooth, belies its alcohol content. The caramel and toffeeish maltiness and the Ringwood yeast flavor (not as pronounced as in Middle Ages brews) are balanced by a spiciness that seems to be from the hops.  A very, very nice ""spring and summer evening by the fire"" brew."
"Strong and full of rich caramel and medium roasted malt flavor. A gentle fruitiness is imparted from the Ringwood yeast. Subtle hop finish."
