"Single 330 ml bottle poured into a tulip. A flat reddish brown with a finger or just a hair under of bright beige foam, somewhere between frothy and creamy.  Sweet malt and fruit aroma with a dash of floral, woody hops ... A toffee and nutty bread base ornamented with raisins and pears. Surprisingly light bodied, at least subjectively speaking, and moderately fizzy, but delivers a big brown sugar, orchard fruit, and brown bread flavor with some added herbal hops. Pears and old brown apples, peach, pretzels, a dry woodiness, and a decent bloom of alcohol. Maybe skews more bready and woody than sweet per se. Finish is dry, more wood and alcohol. A wee bit of oxidation that does not detract. Its English all right but not as rich and redolent as the true classics. Nice of them to print the constituents on the label. The grain bill resembles that of a stout qualitatively if not quantitatively. The hop bill explains the rustic herbal notes."

"330 ml bottle into tulip glass, no bottle dating. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy deep ruby copper color with a 1 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of caramel, raisin, apple, pear, toast, brown sugar, light roast, bread, herbal, woodiness, and toast/yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good complexity and balance of dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and fruity yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of caramel, raisin, pear, apple, toast, brown sugar, bread, toffee, light roast, herbal, woodiness, and toast/yeast earthiness. Fair amount of earthy/woody bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, raisin, pear, apple, toast, brown sugar, bread, toffee, light roast, herbal, woodiness, and toast/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice complexity and balance of dark/bready malt, earthy hop, and fruity yeast ester flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and no cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied; with a smooth, lightly creamy, and fairly crisp/bready mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice Engish strong ale. Good complexity and balance of dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and fruity yeast flavors; and very smooth to sip on. This bottle was lightly oxidized, but was a nicely enjoyable offering."

"Overall Drinkability: Old school bliss."
"another decent but brew that I wont remember, I could see some people loving the ""English balance"" and raving about this one but its a one and done for this guy"
""
""
"Overall: This strong ale is almost borderline with an English barleywine. Fruity, malty, and delicious."
""
"O: I enjoyed the complexities in the smell and taste of this beer. It is relatively easy to drink but pleasant enough to sip."
""
"A decent tipple, in the way of the main island's strong ales, fo sho, with the same UK malt and hop sensibilities that this brewer may not be altogether comfortable with admitting. Maybe not my favorite, vis a vis the same concept so prevalent here on our shores, but the name is cool, and I would imagine, if I were in Dublin town center, this would be a stellar alternative, to well, anything."

"O-interesting ale, flavors are decent but balance is off"
""

"Doesn't live up to first impressions - looks good and smells promising. More boozy than flavorful and fairly weak body."
"Overall its a very hoppy and dry old ale, unfortunately I like my old ales less dry and sweet so I will not be getting this again."

"Pours a two finger cream head that fades very slowly to a thin layer leaving a good lace. Deep clear copper/amber color. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Toasted malt nose and flavor is toasted malt and some caramel. $4.99 for a 330ml bottle from Julio's Liquors Westborough, MA."

"The caps on this brewery's bottles always strike me as funny. Lots of caramel and malts on the nose and flavor profile. It could work if it were more balanced, but unfortunately, it is not. Too much sweetness and it's cloying really. This is by far my least favorite beer from this brewery. The others I tried of theirs were much better."

"Poured into a MacAndrew's thistle glass. Pours a dark coppery red amber with a half finger off-white head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of caramel malt, dark and light fruit. Flavor begins with caramel and bready malt, light and dark dried fruit, developing a more nutty malt flavor and finishing with dark fruit, hints of wood and hops. A great malty body and interesting flavor progression. Flavors become more muted as the glass warms. Medium bodied with some creaminess. Some barley wine elements, but fits as an English strong ale. I will definitely return to this ale."

"M - Medium body. Moderate carbonation."
"This brew poured out as a nice looking reddish brown color. The head was a cream color and had a pretty good retention to it. The lacing wasn't bad either. The smell of the beer had a bigger hop profile than I expected. The amount of malt used was in there also to give this beer a really nice aroma. The taste was nicely balanced with the toasted malts as well as the lively hops. The mouthfeel of this beer was really drinkable. Overall this beer is worth trying. It was actually much better than I expected it to be."
""
"M- Light to medium bodied, great carbonation helps wash away any chance of it being too boozy."
""
"Not bad, a little quirky without being terribly memorable, aftertaste kind of burns me out."
""
"Pretty good brew. Poured slightly cold with a nice, tan, creamy, thick head that soon settles to a light cover and loads of sticky lace. Color is a clear bronze with the ocassional, slow, lonely bubble trail. Aroma is malt, toffee, caramel, burnt sugar, dark ripe fruit. Flavor's like nose, is bitter up front, sweet in back and great carbonic tang to complete the picture. Body and carbonation are spot on. Finish is like flavor, sweetness tapers to a long bitter end, no alcohol buzz. Very drinkable beer. Wish I had more."

"2.0 D: This gets harder and harder to drink as you progress through the glass. The mineral component keeps gaining strength. One 330mL is too much and that should never be the case."
"Pours a clear, dark coppery brown with a very thick, fluffy and rather persistent cream-white head that leaves some good lacing. Malty aroma has a strong fruity note and a hint of grass. Flavor has a malty core, notes of apple and pear, and a woody and slightly bitter underpinning of hops. Smooth texture has good body and plenty of fizz. Blast your brain - and taste buds - with this one."

"Overall: Drinkable but rather unexciting, it's one of those indistinct beers that, were it not for logging in these notes, I'd completely forget within a day or two."

"330ml bottle.Snifter glass.Enjoyed on junÂ´11.Reddish deep amber.Off white froth.Brief large bubbled crown.Sweet malt & floral hop aromas. Crispy upfront.Green grape flavor.Medium body,high carbonation. Pungent alcoholic mouthfeel.Very dry finish.Astringent.Harsh quincy aftertaste."
"I had a nice detailed review written on this beer, let's go with a caramel chest nut colored ale with a light tan head forming thick bands of even lacing. Aroma has pine, herbal, citrus fruitiness that blends well with the inviting caramel malts and slightly sour notes. I explained the intricacies that the use in the hops in the nose don't transcend into to the hop flavor, a strong harsh hop bitterness was welcomed with each sip but I would like to see more cohesion like I did in the nose. The finish is green bitter dryness. Mouthfeel is ilght to medium bodied with a harsh level of carbonation, my main two issues with the beer were the carbonation and the temperature I served it at. On cask this would be Sublime I think it's time to visit Ireland, God Bless all those proud Irish out there because this beer is labeled 100% Irish brewed in Dublin of course."

"O: The ABV on this beer is not terribly high, but you can definitely feel it warm the soul a bit. The complexity is welcoming and it is very easy to drink (especially as it warms). Good job for the style! My favorite of all the ales offered at the Porterhouse."
"O: This is a disappointing beer. Not horrible, but Porterhouse has done better work in the past."
""

"O - Very decent beer, one to return to again and again."
"o - Overall not a bad or offensive beer, but just kind of there. Not much going on in either the nose or the taste. Wouldn't seek it out again."
"Can you bottle boring? Apparently. Beer is too thin, watery, nearly no flavor, mild bitterness at the end. It's like water, big disappointment here, which is odd because I didn't have expectations. It doesn't taste bad I guess, it just doesn't taste like anything."
"D. Just goes to prove that appearances can be deceiving. WHAT a let down. There is absolutely nothing in this beer to tell you it is a 7% ale, no alcoholic warmth, too thin bodied and nothing on the palate. Woefully bland, a poor performer all round."
"D: Really smooth and crisp with a oily mouthfeel and a sweet finish. A great aperitif to one of the many excellent meals available at the Porterhouse."
"D: Warming, absolutely scumptious, and a pleasure to drink. Definitely recommended, will drink again (in fact, I'll follow this with a pint of the stuff). Porterhouse's best beer."
"Dr: If not for the price, I'd order this left and right. If you're at the Porterhouse this is the only beer they brew themselves that's worth ordering."
"D - Not bad, but not as good as it probably could be with more age. There is a nice malt character in the aroma, but the hops dominate the flavor profile. It has a level and harshness of bitterness that is surprisingly reminiscent of an American barleywine. This beer tastes a bit young to me and I imagine that it would mellow and grow more complex with six months to a year of age."
"D - While this is one of their heavier beers it goes down easily enough and if you've already had a meal at the pub you can still continue the evening."
"The body is moderate, but the sweetness gives it a perception that it's bigger than it really is. The sweetness is a bit of a deterrent. Some slickness as well, which really hints at the diacetyl. Overall some nice complexity but some major flaws really hold this beer back. Clean those out and now were talkin."
"Overall, the beer felt very hoppy and bittery, harsh sometimes, but what I liked was that alcohol was very well hidden. Quite drinkable."
"I do think that this is one of the best on-tap Irish beers that I have had here in Ireland, but I can't drink too much of it though because of the 7% ABV. I'm glad that it's so close as I'm going to be sure to have more of it."
"A little unbalanced and unrefined, slightly harsh also but solid none the less"
"M: overall it's a full-bodied and full-flavoured, albeit overly one-dimensional, strong ale, yet the soft mouthfeel proves a little bit too sweet for me. Having said that, it's still enjoyable, better enjoyed as a digestif..."
"Woke up the next morning, with little memory of the night before. Definetly a brain blaster."
"Medium body, sweet aftertaste, with vanilla, and bitter and toasted too!"
"Tasty,smooth, hoppy, firm, very nice drop actually, disguises the 7% alc well. Some sweet lightly caramelly hops, and bitter-ish citric hops, i found it a bit sticky at times, but generally pretty soft in texture and as i said before, it disguises the alcohol quite well, pretty tasty."
