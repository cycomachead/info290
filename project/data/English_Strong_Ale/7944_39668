3.88,14.8,4,4,3.75,3.75,4,"2013 vintage enjoyed in a snifter, this interesting English imperial red pours a bright reddish amber with a thick, big bubbled white head that lingers with light lacing.  Nose of toffee, caramel, ripe peaches, cherries, and strong booze.  Flavors are intense to say the least.  Rich caramel and spicy rye like flavors come through on the front and sides with a mild toffee background.  Fruit flavors roar on the aftertaste and back with peach and cherry notes being tamed by spicy hops.  Booze runs rampant through this rather big ale with considerable heat.  Reminds me of some of the Russian alcohol forward dopplebocks, yet with more depth and character.  Very nice indeed.","Brutaltruth","Dec 26, 2014"
3.04,-10.1,3.5,3.25,2.75,3.5,3,"11.2 ounce bottle, 2013 vintage, label stamp says best before 16 09 23.  Served in a snifter, the beer pours a clear orange/amber color with maybe a quarter inch off-white head that didn't stay around for very long.  There's a decent amount of lacing.  The aroma starts off boozy, with some toffee, candied oranges, stone fruit and some caramel malt noticeable.  The taste is mainly sweet and boozy, it tastes like dried fruit (stone fruit and dark fruit), booze, and bready malt.  The booziness just seems worse the longer I drink this, and unfortunately so does the overall flavor of this brew.  Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's syrupy and coating with moderate carbonation.  This isn't bad, but it wasn't exactly good either.  Maybe it needs more age on it, who knows.  It's worth trying once, but I likely wouldn't buy this again.","bluejacket74","Dec 24, 2014"

Aroma has fruits all day, sharp cherry, dark fruits even some pear, alcohol evident but not rocket fuel. Super sweet on the palate, cloying sweetness caramel sugars with dark fruits and a bit of hot alcohol in the backend...it definitely warms the chest with each sip. Sorry folks not my cup of tea you may need to age this for a bit, too hot and unrefined for this 2013 vintage. Syrup texture pretty much kills the drinkability, cloying soft carbonation full bodied bitter earthy finish stays on with an alcohol burn. Overall if your buying this novelty brew, put some age on it before cracking it, I've seen some good reviews on bottles a year and older.","WVbeergeek","Dec 07, 2013"

The higher ABV makes this one an attention getter, as in pay attention or it will kick your tail. I really appreciate the Brits giving a go to such a different beer. The head is almost non-existent upon pouring, and the hops are left way in the background, barely noticeable. What does that say, the aim, I believe for Ridgeway, was to create a good seasonal, able to stand up to the holiday beverage lists, and yet smooth enough to keep one's interest?

With warmth, alcohol becomes very very present, with almost a small roasty note. Thick brownish cider color. Heavy at start, moderate carbonation. Syrupy feel when sloshing it around, but doesn't sit as heavy as I was expecting. mild to medium dry finish, slightly appley aftertaste, but aftertaste doesn't have the alcohol I was expecting it to have.

Slight hop bitterness is noticeable and some sweetness from caramel (maybe) is present. Once your past the alcohol and tartness the beer is pretty good.

I almost grabbed the barleywine from this series and i wish i had instead of this one because i doubt it could be worse than this. I'll be the first to say, 'to each his own' and there are plenty of things I do contrary to popular opinion on this site (ie aging maharaja) but in my personal opinion, this beer is simply really bad. The appearance is dark brown-red with virtually no head. The smell is nothing particularly unique, rich in malt and alcohol. But the taste is simple, flat, and completely unimaginative. I'll admit the alcohol burn was very slight which is pretty impressive for something this big. But the complete and utter lack of carbonation (which I didn't even think I would care about) and the foul aftertaste of stale beer are quite enough to motivate me to write this review.

4.35,28.7,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"One of my favorite Christmas Ale's. The color was a reddish mahogany color with no foam and not a drop of lace. But, the roasted malty caramel flavor made up for it. Along with a hint of sour apple and just a well balanced strong ale. It didn't have that alcohol bite even with the 11 plus percent alcohol content. Expesensive, but well worth the price.","BeerManDan","Jun 06, 2008"

4.12,21.9,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Pours a very nice clean/clear golden orange/amber color, nice carbonation, nice litte fizzy off-white head, which does leave some minimal sticky lacing. The nose is very nice, malty, some dark fruits especially cherries, slight spices, and caramel. The taste is sweet, malty, sour (cherries), and some caramel. Medium body. The alcohol is hidden very well for a brew this high in ABV, very well. Drinkable, this is a very tasty brew, recommended for sure.","Wasatch","Mar 19, 2008"
3.7,9.5,3,3,4,4,4,"Pours a mahogany with very little head. Earthy aroma, very little hop, definite alcohol effect. Taste is sweet with a bit of carbonic bite and alcohol. Nice smooth and round mouthfeel. Drinkable for this level of alcohol. Reminds me a bit of DFH 120 Minute. Good but not exceptional - another Ridgeway beer that triumphs through marketing rather than taste.","CH3CH2OH","Mar 05, 2008"

3.6,6.5,4,4,3.5,4,3,"First sip reveals an average body with some syrupy texture and very mild carbonation. Smooth and easy to drink the flavor brings out some red vinous grape mixing with brown sugar and general sweetness. The sweetness is almost too much and I am glad to have split the bottle. Some boozy peppery alcohol on the finish. The sweetness and booziness hurt the drinkability a bit but overall a nice winter brew.","sulldaddy","Feb 07, 2008"
3.54,4.7,5,3.5,3.5,4,3,"Drinkability - a most enjoyable sipper, but the abv is too high and overtakes the beer instead of enhancing it. I'd rather have more beer flavor, less hootch.","brewdlyhooked13","Jan 31, 2008"

Flavor is a very nice malt sweetness, with significant licorice liquor character. Very sweet, but not cloying. Aftertaste is pleasant sweetness, but balanced by the dryness of the alcohol. By far the best of the Elf series!","beerking1","Jan 27, 2008"

Loomkssort of a barley wine The aroma has lots of dark, deep fruits. Figs, brown sugar, and plums. The first sip gives off notes of plums, prunes, and frozen grapes. Lots of carmelized malts and sweet syrup. The alcohol intgrates very well with the sweet flavors in this beer. A little nutty sweet on the finish with a very smooth warmth. Great sipping beer.","scruffwhor","Beers"

3.67,8.6,3,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Imperial Red Ale pours an amber-orange color and has sweet notes of malt with including prune, raisin, molasses, an almost barleywine flavor which is unexpected when the color is considered. Some hoppy bitterness towards the end but is smooth going down. Not a session brew and a little disappointing after the Seriously Bad Elf experience (which I found enjoyable). Not a typical English brew in my experience. A bit too pricey for the quality but good for a quick, strong buzz without a wine or harder beverage and easily drinkable considering the 11.2%; Great label","BlaiseDemon","Dec 20, 2007"

3.33,-1.5,3.5,3,3.5,4,3,"I guess i have to go insane to enjoy the bad elf series. I beleive this one to be the best by far of the series. Pours ruby red and tranparent with a decent head. The nose does have the ridgeway funk, but its not as prominent. You can actually taste things in this one. It is quite a bit nuttier than the other elves. Strong nut flavors, and i can actually taste some hops on the finish in this one! sugary residue on the lips isnt as rotten as the other elves. A decent brew. worth a try, but i wouldnt keep one in my cellar.","AKBelgianBeast","Dec 15, 2007"
3.22,-4.7,2.5,3,3.5,3.5,3,"Notes: Once again with ridgeway...in my opinion for the price per value scale this falls short.

Average.","DogFood11","Dec 13, 2007"

3.43,1.5,3.5,3,4,3,3,"This is the last of the naughty elf brews on me list. Pours a clear golden amber color with a smallish tan head that dissipated into a ring around the glass. The smell is very faint, almost non-existant, perhaps a very light caramel malt scent. The taste starts off with a big sweet caramel/honey blast, it is followed by some nutty and wine like flavors. The feel is moderate with light carbonation, finishes slick, almost like a dessert liquor. You can sense the alcohol but the 11.2% doesn't burn the buds. The finish feels like you have just had about 5 lollipops, so needless to say the sweetness can be cloying. An average brew and worth a go to get the bottle into my collection. I must say the Very Bad Elf has been my favorite.","Gmann","Dec 13, 2007"
3.92,16,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"The beer departs the 330ml bottle a crystalline golden amber with a smallish creamy white head that erodes quickly leaving a thin coating of lace upon the glass. Nose has a malt sweet aroma, a bit of alcohol also present, a tad bit of hops, spicy and earthy, crisp and pleasant. Start is sweet with a nice malt profile, alcohol bitter at the back with a medium feel. Finish has a stern acidity, the hops present, but overpowered by the 11.20 ABV, dry sweet aftertaste, and a definite tummy warmer this one, and a real Hoot!","Gusler","Dec 12, 2007"

The alcohol is quite well-masked in the taste, which is itself sweet and smooth.

4.47,32.2,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"The latest in the 'Bad Elf' series, and likely the best. The previous Elf's became more cluttered and rough as the alcohol increased and the flavors intensified. But this one is different. A sweet, bready, toasty aroma shows no hint of higher alcohols or abrasion. Flavors are malty sweet, but the toasty character keeps the beer from cloying sweetness. Hopped for a bitter balance and little sweetness -- but never competes with the complex malt profile. As the beer warms, a sweet rum-like alcohols adds to the mix in favorable light. Well melded fruitiness complement the heavy malts well. Never fusal, phenolic, and moderately estery. Smoothly textured, but not without strong malt textures, and alcohol warming. Finishes toasty-sweet and warm. A very good beer, despite the intimidating namesake.","BEERchitect","Beers"
