If there is molasses sweetness, I can't find it.  It goes down easily enough, but I'd rather be drinking the FU Sandy, or the Redfish, or the Abbe Dubbel, or a Schlitz.","Trombone69","Jan 16, 2015"

3.15,-15.1,3.5,3.5,3,3,3,"Aroma is grainy malt and some bready yeast with hits of caramel and a little earthy hops. First sip is fairly mild with an almost bland flavor. Only some sweet malt and a little brownsugar.  The body is thin with mild rolling carbonation average texture.  The flavor lingers with a bit of sweetness and cereal grain.  I dont get too much of a hop profile and the booze is well hidden at 7.5%. The beer isnt bad but it is a let down as I was hoping for more when I bought the bottle in New Jersey.  I wouldnt pay for another bottle if I saw one.","sulldaddy","Dec 02, 2014"
