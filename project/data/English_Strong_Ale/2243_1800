3.73,6,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.5,3.75,"Single 330 ml bottle poured into a tulip. A flat reddish brown with a finger or just a hair under of bright beige foam, somewhere between frothy and creamy.  Sweet malt and fruit aroma with a dash of floral, woody hops ... A toffee and nutty bread base ornamented with raisins and pears. Surprisingly light bodied, at least subjectively speaking, and moderately fizzy, but delivers a big brown sugar, orchard fruit, and brown bread flavor with some added herbal hops. Pears and old brown apples, peach, pretzels, a dry woodiness, and a decent bloom of alcohol. Maybe skews more bready and woody than sweet per se. Finish is dry, more wood and alcohol. A wee bit of oxidation that does not detract. Its English all right but not as rich and redolent as the true classics. Nice of them to print the constituents on the label. The grain bill resembles that of a stout qualitatively if not quantitatively. The hop bill explains the rustic herbal notes.","CalgaryFMC","Oct 28, 2014"

3.68,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"330 ml bottle into tulip glass, no bottle dating. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy deep ruby copper color with a 1 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of caramel, raisin, apple, pear, toast, brown sugar, light roast, bread, herbal, woodiness, and toast/yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good complexity and balance of dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and fruity yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of caramel, raisin, pear, apple, toast, brown sugar, bread, toffee, light roast, herbal, woodiness, and toast/yeast earthiness. Fair amount of earthy/woody bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, raisin, pear, apple, toast, brown sugar, bread, toffee, light roast, herbal, woodiness, and toast/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice complexity and balance of dark/bready malt, earthy hop, and fruity yeast ester flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and no cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied; with a smooth, lightly creamy, and fairly crisp/bready mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice Engish strong ale. Good complexity and balance of dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and fruity yeast flavors; and very smooth to sip on. This bottle was lightly oxidized, but was a nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Apr 21, 2014"

Aroma of caramel malt, dark and light fruit. Flavor begins with caramel and bready malt, light and dark dried fruit, developing a more nutty malt flavor and finishing with dark fruit, hints of wood and hops. A great malty body and interesting flavor progression. Flavors become more muted as the glass warms. Medium bodied with some creaminess. Some barley wine elements, but fits as an English strong ale. I will definitely return to this ale.","LiquidAmber","Aug 05, 2012"

The taste was nicely balanced with the toasted malts as well as the lively hops. The mouthfeel of this beer was really drinkable. Overall this beer is worth trying.

Color is a clear bronze with the ocassional, slow, lonely bubble trail. Aroma is malt, toffee, caramel, burnt sugar, dark ripe fruit. Flavor's like nose, is bitter up front, sweet in back and great carbonic tang to complete the picture. Body and carbonation are spot on. Finish is like flavor, sweetness tapers to a long bitter end, no alcohol buzz. Very drinkable beer. Wish I had more.","drpimento","May 15, 2012"

3.57,1.4,4,4.5,3,3.5,3.5,"I had a nice detailed review written on this beer, let's go with a caramel chest nut colored ale with a light tan head forming thick bands of even lacing. Aroma has pine, herbal, citrus fruitiness that blends well with the inviting caramel malts and slightly sour notes. I explained the intricacies that the use in the hops in the nose don't transcend into to the hop flavor, a strong harsh hop bitterness was welcomed with each sip but I would like to see more cohesion like I did in the nose. The finish is green bitter dryness. Mouthfeel is ilght to medium bodied with a harsh level of carbonation, my main two issues with the beer were the carbonation and the temperature I served it at.
