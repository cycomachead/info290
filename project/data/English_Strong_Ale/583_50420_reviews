"Obvious bourbon, especially in tasting, but not so much as to completely overpower the nice malt base. Some good woody/barrel flavor too, along with vanilla and toffee in the finish."

"O - This is pretty straight-forward, uncomplicated ale designed to feature the bourbon barrel aging characteristics. The sugars are forward, but not so much that's it's overly sweet, like Kentucky Bourbon Ale. It's quite drinkable without being distinctive, and pairs well with something like a full-bodied, somewhat spicy cigar, which I enjoyed immensely with this growler. The best aspect of this beer is the nose - it's to be savored before drinking. Recommended as a nitecap."

"More fruity and toasty than I recall. The nuttiness dominates. It's a bit hot, but will likely benefit from some aging. A tad cloying, I couldn't drink more than one in a session."

"The feel is a little fizzy but it begins to iron out near the end. If your a real fan of this type of ale than this is a must have."
"Overall, pretty well done and probably worth trying if you are into barrel aged beers."

"Taste is a weird mix, as with the aroma. The boozy bourbon vanilla and charred oak is muted by a fruity character (again, the barleywine speaks loudest here). Though certainly not a bad beer, this one just lacks a more cohesive melding of tastes and styles."
""
"Also I don't know how this beer doesn't list an ABV. To be honest im surprised its legal to do so. Judging by the alcohol legs and feel of the beer its between 8-8.5% but who's to say."
"D/O- Very different. A lot of flavors going on here, I struggle to call this ""complex"" though. I wonder if this is what Schlafly was shoot for by mixing their barleywine with their bourbon barrel aged pale ale because that sounds delicious. I just didn't care for this one much."
""

"Overall: Not what I think of when I drink a Strong Ale. Not sure what Schlafly was going for in this beer. Are there infection issues with this beer? I ask that because i have drank 2 other Schlafly beers that have been infected. This brewery does not have a great track record with me..."

"Schlafly Special Reserve - Bourbon Barrel Ale is a strong, in-your-face dark ale that will immediately trick your nose into thinking you've poured yourself a pint of Kentucky Bourbon. The smell of this brew is not for the faint of heart. Strangely, it is exactly those bourbon tones that make this beer so drinkable when it hits the palate. The 'boozey' taste & smell from the high alcohol content that can sometimes impinge flavor is masked beautifully behind that bourbon barrel smoke screen. All in all this was a very enjoyable beer for those special occasions when only something stronger will do."
"D: Surprising beer. Very drinkable, if only a little sweet. This effort to put something other than stouts into bourbon barrels still needs some work, but shows promise as the vanilla and wood characteristics come through far stronger than usual."
"O - Glad I picked this up on my most recent Kentucky venture. At $10.99 a sixer, I can't think of many better values. A nice complex bourbon aged ale that probably wouldn't satisfy you're Bourbon lovers, but would be a nice intro into bba beers."
""
"Overall a nice smooth a mellow bourbon aged ale with no heavy alcohol taste at all."
""
"Follow-up: I tried this again about 7 months later at a beer tasting and liked it much, much better. It's possible that I had a bad bottle before or that this beer is just much better when fresh."
"This is a good beer but still doesn't stand up to kentucky bourbon barrel ale. If the sweetness was just toned down a bit and the bourbon a little more pronounced this beer would be amazing."
""
"O: A good beer and a great bargain. For only $11 per sixer, I've had worse bbal beers that cost much more for a single bottle. I would like a bit more depth beyond the bourbon characteristics and a creamier body, but it's still very tasty and smells great."

"Rich looking copper color with a light cloudiness to it. I was impressed by the thick look to it. Rich head of white across the top faded quickly leaving behind only token lace in its wake. The aroma was sweet, lots of caramel and a touch of piney hops make it just bitter enough to get by. Really nice profile here as I take the first sips. Rich malts, smooth, easy caramel flavor with a light and subtle bitterness that reminded me of a nice barleywine. Medium feel here as the syrup like nature of it lended itself to a bit thicker of a profile. thought the alcohol was very well hidden indeed,"
"Interesting nose. Buttery cinnamon toast and canned pumpkin lead the way at first, with bourbon and toffee becoming increasingly assertive as it warms. The bourbon aromas stay under control, and the bourbon flavor does as well. I think this might improve/smooth out with age, and am inclined to perhaps go find a couple more bottles. At this stage, it's fairly tasty if slightly disjointed. Tangy fruit and oak plus abundant carbonation don't quite let the toffee and caramel sweetness do their thing. Tart and abundant fruitiness, almost like jolly rancers at times. The bourbon is pretty subtle, not quite an afterthought but close. Buttered toast again comes to mind, nuts and cocoa, too. Leafy and earthy hops aren't shy. This could perhaps turn into a nice English barleywine-type ale with a little time in ye olde cellar."
"I wish I knew the abv on this one. Overall an excellent beer (the second excellent offering from Schlafly in a row for me). The beer is an awesome value and this all culminates in the sentiment that I am deeply saddened Schlafly doesn't distribute in Ohio."
"O - I want to like this more than I do, but I just don't find this overly remarkable. Not bad, just nothing special. After having had Kentucky Ale's Bourbon Barrel Ale, (which is one of my favorite beers), this one just pales in comparison."
"And whats the ABV? Even the web site don't tell ya. Overall, well worth it, find it, Buy it!!"
"Pours a murky dark copper orange with a 2 inch white-orange head that fades to an oily cap. Broken rings of lace form randomly on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted coconut, vanilla, light fruits, and alcohol. Taste is of coconut, vanilla, and cake. There is a slight hop presence in the aftertaste. There is a slight alcohol burn in the back of the throat as well. This beer has a lower carbonation level with a slightly thick and sticky mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with nice barleywine characteristics and very nice coconut and vanilla smells and tastes. My first beer from Schlafly."
"Bottle to snifter. Looks good; definitely colored (at least in part) by bourbon barreling. Smells excellent; hops are laced in nicely with the bourbon scent. Tastes good; the ale is alright, but the bourbon barreling is what this beer is all about. Mouthfeel is good as well. It's definitely a ""sipper."" Overall, a good beer (especially for its price, considering it's bourbon barreled) that I'll be having again."
"Overall I am pleasantly surprised. Great taste that is a great fusion of Bourbon and beer. The best parts Bourbon, vanilla creamy chocolate, are fused with nice sweet malts. I would definitely buy this again."
"d - Overall I liked this beer quite a bit. The taste seemed slightly watered down, but the smell and taste were good. I would certainly have this one again."
"D - There's nothing too fantastic about this beer. There's also nothing I can fault it on. Regardless its moderately tasty and worth drinking. Glad I tried it."
"Lemon zest hops that I presume come from the pale ale part of the blend up front moves into melted caramel and vanilla. Apple juice creeps in here as well. Not sure if the meeting of these two beers just imparts an odd, slightly off flavor, but it just doesn't come fully together. What it is, however, is a good beer that is unique and just misses of the mark of being very good."
"D - as mentioned, this is like their barleywine aged in bourbon barrels - awesome beer for bourbon barrel lovers. I have been really wanting to try this for a long time. I wish they sold this in St Louis (considering that's where it's brewed) because I would buy this everytime I went to the store. Solid stuff."
"Very hazy, medium brownish orange color. No head, very thin ring around edge. Very oaked aroma, with nice toastedness from barrel. Highly carbonated. Very toasty oak flavor. Sweet oaky finish, some sweet from the bourbon on the finish. Some smokiness picked up in the middle of drink. Not much else in flavor to pick out, pretty oaky all the way through. A little dryness on end, but pretty smooth, hides alcohol well."
"Mouthfeel is smooth with good carbonation. A bit on the lighter side but that is kind of nice as it makes it more drinkable. Overall, a well blended barrel aged brew. Everything works well and achieves a good balance. Tasty stuff I'm glad I was able to find this one!"
"All in all an interesting and creative take on the barrel."
"D - Ok, but after a few sips I can tell I won't want another after this one. 1 bottle is great, but 2 bottle is too much."
"D: A beer that is hard to characterize, the label says a blend of their pale ale and barleywine, not sure what I would call it, but I like it, don't love it. A nice change of pace if you want something with bourbon characteristics, but not a RIS. Not exactly a summer beer, I could easily see reaching for a 2nd if it was fall and I was in front of a campfire. Glad I have a couple more left, at the same time, I am not sure I would buy again. Worth trying if you see it."
"The only knock I have on this beer is that it is thin. There is a good amount of carbonation. Still, this is a very nice beer, and I love the blended idea. Curious on how this will age. Well done."
"This was much better than my first taste of the beer and I would say that it is aging well. I will check in on it in another 6 months. Pick some up if you can find it."
"It has a pretty thin mouth feel but it really is a drinkable beer especially for a bourbon barrel ale."
"Thanks to gemutlichkeit for this awesome extra."
"For the style this beer is actually immensely drinkable. The carbonation is very high - almost too high - so that the beer is incredibly light on the palate. The finish is slightly sticky, and holds the flavors well."
"Drinkability - I wanted to save a couple for aging...that didn't go too well."
"mouthfeel is as expected. very decent, though nothing particularly outstanding. medium bodied, and well carbonated. i dont think ill be breaking into my other bottle of this tonight because it is much to sweet to stomach more than 12 ounces, but im definitely glad that i get to experience it again. a solid B+, and one the more interesting beers you'll ever try."
"This was blind tested with the Kentucky Bourbon Barrel Ale in Cincy. The KBBA came out the winner, but it was close. Nice effort from Schlafly."
"Overall an interesting beer...but I'm wondering why they blended their barley wine with the pale ale...the pale doesn't seem to add much besides that watery mouthfeel towards the end...the hops don't come out much either"
"Overall: Not mind blowing, but very balanced. Personally I'd like the bourbon to pop a bit more than it does, it seems to fall a little short of the stronger bourbon flavor I'd like. Good beer though."
"Poured from the 12 oz bottle into my snifter, this beer is a dark copper color with good clarity but with a head that doesn't last long. At first the smell is mostly of the English hops but reveals more bourbon scent as it warms. The smell is a bit disappointing; I expected more. The taste is also a bit lackluster. I don't get much bourbon, mostly just some malty sweetness. I'm mostly comparing this to Lexington Brewery's Bourbon Barrel Ale which happens to be one of my favorite beers. The flavors with this one just seem to be muted, even after it warms. The mouthfeel is smooth and slightly sticky and I don't know what the abv is, but the alcohol is not very noticeable. Overall this isn't bad but there's other bourbon barrel ales I'd rather be drinking."
"Drinkability: Very nice flavors and a nice mouthfeel with a taste that isn't burning my throat out, so it's got that going for it... Sadly, the ABV is apparently unknown but I'm definitely feeling it, so I don't think I could sit through too many."
"12 ounce bottle. Served in a snifter, the beer pours a dark copper color with about an inch off-white head. Head retention is decent, lacing is good. It smells like caramel malt, vanilla, oak and a little bit of hops. The bourbon aroma isn't as strong as I thought it would be. Luckily, the bourbon comes out more in the flavor. I can taste oak, vanilla, caramel malt, toffee and a bit of dark fruit. There's also a lingering bittersweet fruity and bourbony aftertaste. Even though the label says the beer is a blend of barleywine and pale ale aged in bourbon barrels, I didn't pick up a lot of hops in the aroma or taste. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy and has good carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's easy and enjoyable to drink. All in all, I think this is a pretty decent brew. I'd buy this again in the future."
"this was fun and i am excited to see schlafly try something new. i was not expecting the bourbon to be as strong as it was, and that is not a bad thing!"
"D: One I would get again any day. Very good."
"This beer reminds me a lot of the Kentucky Bourbon Barrel Ale producted by Alltech's Lexington Brewing Company. Schlafly takes a better balance between the strong malt character and the bourbon aging and is a stronger beer throughout. But the hops struggle to blend with the delicate bourbon character, causing too much conflict rather than balance."
