A complex and easy-drinking beer for either a session, or chilling with for a half-hour. They cellar for a number of years too, and can improve with age.

I was extremely careful to not pour the thick sediment into the glass. Great amount of carbonation, with excellent lacing. Garnet ruby red body with orange highlights. Very nice looking beer. Smell was earthy and yeasty. Taste was very pleasurable. Malt, raisins, toffee, and fresh bread were highlights. Mouthfeel was the biggest surprise, so extra points here. It held up well over the time in the cellar, and it was mighty smooth. If I could go back, I would definitely buy a few more for a mere $3 each and age some for 5 years and beyond just to see if it can get better.

3.85,5.8,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"2009 vintage, so something like two or three years old at this point. Great burnt orange hue, nice head that settles down into a thin layer of foamy bubbles that never go all the way away. Lots of malty sweetness on the nose, some wood, some dark fruit. The taste follows the smell fairly closely, but the good news is that the wood and fruit flavors come on strong and it is not just a simple malt bomb - well crafted and well cellared beer here. The only hint at the strength of this beer is the association of the flavors with high gravity brews; I'm not really picking up any alcohol heat. Maintains surprisingly good carbonation, unsure if the liveliness is appropriate here or not but I for one appreciate it, definitely adds another dimension to the beer. Nice and full bodied without being viscous or too sticky. Altogether, not a beer I was sure I would like, and certainly one that exceeded my expectations.

Aromas of caramel, alcohol, grapes, honey and maple predominate with a touch of hops in there somewhere. Flavor has lots of syrupy malt, quite estery, some floral malts, some solvent alcohol, finish is very dry with some maple malt and grassy hops.

4.42,21.4,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"2009 batch. Sampled on May 6, 2010. It pours a handsome but somewhat hazy dark amber with a long lasting luscious looking fluffy head and excellent clinging lacing. But the most noticeable aspect is all of the sedimentary deposits swimming around the glass. It is significant as a home brew. Caramel malts is the first sensation in the aroma followed quickly by a pine tree, raisiny background and a crisp, fresh quality. The mouthfeel is fairly bold with the bits of sediments tickling the tongue. The overall impression of the taste is a kind of biterness with a dose of hard liquor. But the sweet malts and dry hoppy finish are also notable. It is complex but delightful. I can happily announce that this is the first Austrailian beer I actually really enjoyed and would actively look for again.","puboflyons","May 06, 2010"

3.55,-2.5,4,4,3.5,2.5,3.5,"2008. Poured a fairly clear tawny amber with an eggshell cap of fine bubbles. Thick, chunky lacing with good head retention. The sediment was quite loose, meaning that it was suspended in the last 2oz or so of beer, even with a careful pour. Fruity aroma, toffee, bready, ripe apple and pear skin. Malty texture, a little coarse, medium bodied with lowish carbonation. The body fell away a little bit towards the end, leaving it a bit thin. Medium to low bitterness that was more pronounced in the finish. Hops were a bit grassy and herbal, perhaps minty, and lingered on the palate. It was a bit earthy and there was a hint of anise mid-palate and in the finish. Fruity character was less prominent and seemed to be tied to a light alcohol flavour. There seemed to be a hint of oak/wood as well, contributing a light astringency. Overall, pretty good other than the issue I had with the body.","DrJay","Jan 18, 2010"

The toffee and caramel flavors come up first with the brown sugar and alcohol rounding out the finish. There is no hint of wood like in the aroma. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with carbonation that is too high for the style, and really gets in the way of the taste. Overall, this is an alright beer.

4.08,12.1,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"One of those great finds while in Atlanta, GA a couple months ago. Although the 'best by' date says 10-09-06, I beg to differ. This beer shows a lot of talent and character. A bottle-conditioned pour delivers a strong copper, chesnut hue with a haze due to the yeast (among other particles) within the beer. Aromas are soft, yet firm with serious notes of barley malt, over-rippened peaches and pears, with a subtle English hop character (Fuggles?). All blends so well... The taste gives a well-matured, softly textured, and seriously complex blend of Marris Otter-tasting malts that bring out the soft fruity esters while contributing a spicy, fermented edgy, yeasty flavor. Again, well-rippened peaches and pears all over the place, leaving a mouth watering sensation after every sip. Each drink follows with a soft ride with aged hops and a pleasant (albeit light) hop flavor and mild sherry (oxidized) notes that complemented the beer well. A mild metalic taste is the only deterant. The feel is a soft, creamy, malty fullness that never shows agression or fusal alcohols. Finishes with the same fruity flavors experienced in the taste with intermingling notes of hops and alcohol dryness. Turned out to hold a 1/4"" head all the way to the bottom of the glass with superior lacing. This is how I expect the Fuller's Vintage Ales to perform into their prime. This beer is that good.

The label indicates 7.5% alcohol and that they achieve it from choice malts and an extended top fermentation. The smell is a combination of aged, toasted malt and the sharpness of alcohol. The first taste to greet you is the sharpness of the high alcohol content. Its not particularly well hidden, especially for only being 7.5-percent. The second taste is a toasted malty pseudo-sweetness followed, again, by the alcohol dryness. Mouthfeel is quite good, body-wise and carbonation-wise, but post-swallow, the alcohol can get to you. Its not as easy-drinking beer as you would hope, and the dryness becomes a bitterness. To sum up, I wont buy this beer again. Although it looks pretty nice, and smells pretty good, Coopers makes their Extra Strong Vintage Ale seem like the 12% Belgian that doesnt balance out the high alcohol content. The only problem is that Coopers Extra Strong is 7.5% alcohol and does a poor job of balancing it out. All the more disappointing.

The nose is slightly raisiney, almost woody/oaky, with a tea-like tanniny quality to it. The flavor is slightly spicey, very slightly raisiney, with hints of tanniney wood. I like it. I was right to enjoy it back in the birthplace of this brew. The feel is moderate to thick with a moderate carbonation. I really don't get any of the 7.5% alcohol. This is a mighty fine beer.

The aroma is malty with some weird almost vegetal notes, as well as notes of alcohol, cleaning solution, caramel. The beer is sweet, quite well carbonated and has subtle oxidation notes of sherry. In some ways it is quite light on the palate. The taste is much more agreeable than the aroma hinted at. This is definitely slanted on toward the malty side of the spectrum, in some ways it even reminds me of diluted malt extract. Certainly interesting, and I am glad that I picked this up, but I think that it might be a bit more malty and fresh tasting if it was a bit younger.","Gueuzedude","Jan 29, 2005"

Taste is smoke, malt, green apple, raisins, peat, hops and alcohol (late to the party and not a bloom so much as just a presence). Mouthfeel is very rich, smooth, full bodied with an effervescence all over the mouth and tongue but biased to the tip. Warms the throat nicely. Drinkability is very high.

3.72,2.2,3,3.5,4,4,3.5,"This mahogany brown-with-orange colored brew has a bulbous, sticky tan head. The head quickly fades to a thin film of bubbles, but actually produces nice lace. Theres a lot of sediment, including large, free-floating clumps of yeast. Also, Id say theres a large amount of carbonation, which is (at times) audible. The aroma is intensely fruity (pear, banana, apple), with a little malt. The mouthfeel is dominated by the carbonationthe beer has potential for a nice, creamy texture, but the fizz keeps getting in the way. Taste is sweet and malty, but lacks depth and complexity. You can detect the alcohol, but it doesnt seem to play that big a roll in the flavor. All in all, its really not what I look for in a barleywine.","Suds","Jun 13, 2003"

3.89,6.9,3.5,4.5,4,3,3.5,"Coarse, fizzy head that had little staying power beyond a tiny bit of sticky lace. The body itself was cloudy amber with orange highlights. Chewy, toasted malt and toffee abounds in the nose, and those were mirrored in the taste. While there was no sign of hops aroma, there was a palate cleansing bitterness up front with the malt. The body was a little too thin and the finish cut short by seltzer flavor. It was a shame because it had so much potential. The 7.1% ABV did little besides warm the throat, so this beer would possibly get my vote for heavy hitting session beer of the month.","yen157","Mar 30, 2003"

A sour/fruity mix on the nose.  This beer is really lacking for any distinguishible qualities on the taste buds.  Surprising for a Strong/Vintage ale.  There are some light nuances of fruity character.  A little herbal tea like character.  sIf something good can be said about this beer, it's that the alcohol taste is absent in a 7.1 a/v brew.

On the palate big caramel malt flavor upfront, red apple tones in the background which creates a tiny sweetness / sourness (very light), and maybe slightly toasted light bread.  The mouth feel is extremely smooth.  Overall I thought this was balanced to perfection, excellent sweetness, and the 7.1% abv. is hardly detectable.

Muddy brown ale with soft, sticky head, with lager-like sparkling qualities that is trademark for Coopers. Surprisingly refreshing with an apple-y tartness in the middle, spritzy malty finish. Still some nice hop presence; not bitter or licorice-y like some older beers, but nicely buttery. Very tasty, seems slightly watered-down - a testament to its drinkability, but is that appropriate for the style? Otherwise superb.","Thrasher","May 07, 2002"
