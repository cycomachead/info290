"Pretty simply, nice notes but they don't quite mesh well together. OK, but sort of gimmicky, and not really special on its own."
""
"I think others have covered the tasting notes here. Not really light but more light than heavy. Not really getting much whiskey here. Liken it to a subtle innis & gunn original. Find that citrus aftertaste (orange) becomes a little, not very overpowering towards the end of the bottle. Definitely worth another go around and now I definitely have to try the blonde. For $7.... I would probably not drink it for a very long time but I would buy it over innis & gunn (my only reference point) 10 times out of ten."

"Overall... nothing special"

"Overall, it is not at all powerful and very drinkable for a 7% ABV ale. I don't feel the whisky vibe going on, as much as the caramel and orange flavor with the malty sweetness."
"Overall an OK beer. Let down by sweetness. Waste of high ABV given flavour."

"330 ml. bottle. Amber colour, moderate head that fades quickly. Smell of malts, some vanilla, hints of whisky, apricots and caramel. Rather thin body, kind of sweet in the palate. Taste is just the same as smell, some whisky (not really very strong), apricots and vanilla. I expected more of this one."

"O: A decent whiskey beer and is very smooth, but was lacking in appearance and mouthfeel."
"Enjoyed on 3/2/11 in an Snifter glass.Golden color, white dense & lasting foam. Wheat aromas & subtle woody notes in nose. Felt sweet in mouth. Refreshing. Hints of whisky, wood & nut flavors in a very well balanced way. Crispy sensation. Drinkable.."

"Somewhat disappointing."
"I can really see this beer (except for the hops maybe) being a 'whisky beer', as it has some whisky qualities to it, albeit weak and unsatisfying, but if it's distilled....!"
"D- Suppose this beer is just a novelty really, Doesnt look appealing to me, lack of depth in character and flavour really made this one to forget. Pass!"
"The beer is OK, not sure it is worth the cost, but glad I've experienced another whisky beer. I am sure I'll really enjoy one soon!"
"Drinkability: An interesting beer, the whisky elements adds a different dimension to classic English Ale style. Goes down easily, and a few of these would probably not be a problem."
"reminds me of Innis and Gunn as I drink it, if you like their beers I would assume you would like this"
"Nice on the tongue, natural carbonation. Actually a nice sipper - probably could put a few of these away with a nice meal."
"M&D: I can now imagine why the label recommends a cold serving for this ale, as the lack of complexity and certainly underperformance of whisky-cask ageing can be camouflaged as clean and even ""integrated", which I don't find to be the case at around 12 centigrade anyway. In fact, the nearly non-existence of alc. might be a plus for the drinkability, as is the medium-minus body, a lightly carbonated texture, and an approachable flavour profile. But considering that this is self-acclaimed as a premium whisky ale aged in a famous distillery's casks, the lack of these ""lengendary"" elements in the overall mixture is less than satisfying, to say the least. To be bold, I have to say I simply can't see the value for money (around 4 quid for a filtered and possibly pasteurised bottle!) that could be justified by excessive self-serving advertising!"
"An interesting, if not entirely original idea for a Scottish distillery to undertake, which comes off as underwhelming at best - and thin and tacky at worst. Not that it really matters by now, but the somewhat dear retail cost would certainly curtail any additional imbibing."
"Pale straw color. Nice aroma-quite malty and beer like with almost no real whisky smell I was suprised. Almost a mild buttery smell. Sharp bite to it. Mild whiskey flavor. Somewhat metalic tasting. Very grainy. Ok enough mouthfeel. Overall an ok beer. Hard to find the whisky qualities in here. Comes across as a strong Euro lager if you ask me. Thanks to my nephew in law Tam for sending this thru customs with a label stating ""beer"". Hard to believe it made it!"
"Pours copper in colour, clear with thin fuzzy head. No lacing. Smell - sweet, malty, whiskey is there as well. Alcohol slightly shows up. Taste is pretty sweet but in pleasant way, whiskey and toffee aromas with some frutiness perhaps. it is balanced and smooth brew, alcohol is hidden well, has pretty interesting character. It's somewhat dribkable, two of those probably would be my best, but I'll stick with just one for now. Have to mention the price - almost 8 dollars for 0.33l bottle - I think it's pretty pricey."
"Not bad at all, much more subtle than most whiskey beers I've come across."
"A bit of a lame duck regarding this style, seems promising up front yet doesn`t quite deliver, a mediorcre offering at best."
"The beer was medium bodied and is a very nice alternative to the usual, however it is way too rich (and pricey) to be an all night drink. Worth the try, but only for one."
"Overall, this seems to me like your garden variety whisky beer. I've yet to be impressed by a beer in this genre, and I don't expect to be: whisky makers traditionally make beer purely as a way to distill whisky, not as an art in its own right, and they are completely unschooled in the use of a huge brewer's tool: hops. Furthermore, single-malt scotch producers are accustomed to single-variety grain bills that, while they lead to great whiskies, can make for one-dimensional beer. All of this is to say that whisky makers have not distinguished themselves as beer makers, at least not yet. That trend continues here."
