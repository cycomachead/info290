"Big malt profile with hints of molasses and raisin. Mild alcoholic taste with good balance of Goldings hops. Not for the faint of heart, but I find it quite yummy."
""
"Way too light bodied and lacking the rich flavors I look for in the style. Some definite off flavors with metallic and bitter fruity hints throwing off the malts and becoming a distraction."

"Far bigger beer than most browns, bordering on the imperial stout realm... not as black and balanced a little dryer. I'm kicking myself that I bypassed this one as often as I have in the past... damn good beer at an excellent price point."

"I think this beer is very understated. It starts out with hop notes and then complexly traverses an earthy porter finish. It is a fresh beer that could be drank year round as it is fresh, but also dark and could be appreciated in the winter time after a day working outside or by the campfire."

"A small head of off white foam on top of a clear, dark brown body. An aroma of toffee and musty hops. Dry, caramel and burnt toast with some molasses in the finish. Medium body, average carbonation, and a dry finish. Not bad, fairly bland but inoffensive."
"No head really on a deep amber brown clear body. No lace really. Aroma of breads, toasted malts, nuts, molasses and earthy hops. Flavor is also very toasty opening with nuts, toasted malts and earthy but finishing with brown sugar, caramel, rye . Medium body and moderate carbonation. The alcohol is very well hidden. This one is flavorful and definitely one of the better of the style."

"12 oz bottle pours a Pepsi brown with good head and lacing. Aroma is molasses with dark fruit. Taste is caramel, tobacco, dark fruit. Mouthfeel is little harsh, but nice dry finish. Alcohol is well hidden. I'm liking this better as it warms up - I bet it's really good on tap. Not a style that I'm typically interested in but I can see the appeal."

"O: Decent English Strong Ale â€“ lots of alcohol but blended in nicely with the malt."
"O: A flavorful English style pub ale with remarkably well hidden alcohol. Recommended."

"Goes down real easy in spite of the high alcohol content, be careful!"
"Overall- My favorite offering from nimbus, i would like to try this from a cask/beer engine or on nitro. I think it would compliment bread pudding, brie, mashed potatoes and game hen. Defiantly a good beer to nurse in a pub on a rainy day while watching cricket or rowing."
"overall: outstanding nose. A bit of a letdown after that."
"This is a mellow strong ale from Nimbus, and an acceptable one at that."
""
"Pours an almost opaque super dark brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, caramel, and some alcohol aromas. Taste is somewhat the same but there is a metallic flavor that overwhelms everything else. There is a mild bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an average beer and not something I would seek out again."
""
"Overall, a fine beer. Don't age it in the 12 oz bottle, though."

"Overall: Lacks complexity, depth, and, more importantly, some much needed smoothness. For a second, I thought maybe some age would smooth it out, but I changed my mind."

"Finish is a bit disappointing but overall not bad."

"Pours a pretty deep brown mahogany hue. Head basically doesn't exist. Maybe a little bit of brown foam but thats about it. Smells like deep roasted malts. Don't detect any fruit, citrus, pine or any hint of hops. Tastes exactly like it smells. Has a full and thick mouthfeel. Overall a good beer. No complexity, but no flaws either. Just a good beer."

"a bit funky in taste/smell, which keeps the mystery throughout the glass, and keeps me drinking it trying to figure out the ingredients. very lightly carbonated and the mouthfeel keeps throwing me off! not a bad sipping beer at all, but i don't think i can handle more than one in a session."

"This one doesn't do it for me. A few flaws with not a lot of complexity going on."

"Drinkability is high, this is my favorite Nimbus ale by a long shot, loads of character, flavor, yet still dangerously quaffable. I ""monkeyed"" around to much with their lesser offering before this!"
"O: A very tasty beer that could be drank on its own. It could go with a burger or fish and chips. Nice job Nimbus, this beer rocks."
"Poured from a standard bottle into glass. Not much of an aroma, but good deep red color. I liked the taste, a little hoppy, with a slightly astringent taste and good full-bodied mouth-feel. Very little head but good lacing on the glass. Overall positive experience!"
"O 4.0 I am a sucker for full bodied beers. A very nice malty treat. I could see kicking a few of these back in an evening."
"Old Monkeyshine is intriguing -- it provides subtle yet enjoyable flavors amidst a big body an an equally hefty ABV. I like the nimble hand Nimbus played with this one."
"Heavy carbonation with a light mouthfeel. Highly drinkable"
"I would say that Old Monkeyshine has a medium-light body with light carbonation that aids the Kent Golding hops in creating a mild spiciness throughout the drink. The hops really shine more in the mouth than under the nose, but they mix really well with the strong roasted malts and caramel, neither overpowering nor lingering in the depths. The best thing about this brew is that although it holds a hefty 8.2% AVB in a 12oz bottle, the only time the alcohol is noticeable is when your head becomes airy and delicately fuzzy halfway through. There is no trace of alcohol in the aroma, and the roasted malts do a fantastic job of keeping the taste out."
"Good example of the style, almost too easy to drink for what it is."
"drink. Well done."
"A simple beer that when fresh is quite enjoyable and easy drinking for the higher abv."
"Pretty impressive for the style. One of the best English strong ales I've had."
"Old Monkeyshine- My sister had a bottle of this one in her fridge already and I was looking forward to drinking some local Tucson brewed beer from Nimbus Brewing Co. It poured a deep teak brown with a hint of red. It smelled like light vanilla, light roast and a bit caramel-y. It tasted light at first, then a nice roasted malt with bourbon notes come in and leave a little burn. Medium carbonation. Very drinkable. I was looking on their website and apparently they have a bourbon barrel aged version of this, at least at the brewery. I wish we had made it out to the Brewery as our visit to the Barrio Brewing Co seemed a bit wasted."
"Overall: I really like this style because it is nearly but not quite many other styles. Almost like a ""jack of all trades but master of none"" for old/strong ales. This example is a good one, and worth trying to you can get a bottle."
"Poured mahogany with a two finger, very frothy head. Lively carbonation emanates from the body of the beer. Nose faintly picks up melted caramel and cinnamon oatmeal which disappoints only in that I would love to have had these two aromas violently collide against my senses. Hops are in the background, again faint to the nose. Raisins, cherries are dominate the taste which is accompanies the malt and finishes with a delicate touch of hops that disguises the alcohol well. What I notice is that the aftertaste is mainly caramel, which doesn't please me that much since I don't find that flavor to work well with the initial raisin/cherry taste. That said, it is a pleasure to have this after a very long day because the malt/hop balance along with the interesting flavors makes this ale symbiotically dance across my palate. Having one or two max would be a pleasure on any random weeknight; any more would be a bit risky due to the ABV. Thanks goes out again to bennetj17 for the hookup..."
"Out of a 12 ounce bottle and into my nonic Imperial pint glass. The ale appears a hazed rich copper chestnut color with two fingers of creamy off white foam. Aromas and flavors are of rich roasted grains, deeply caramelized malt, nuts such a hazelnut, hints of brown sugar, a bit fruity. The ale falls somewhere between medium and full bodied with adequate carbonation. Pretty tasty stuff."
"Beer poured mahogany with a good off white head that is leaving lacing behind. Nose is sweet, dark fruits and heavy malts. Taste is sweet, very malty, dark fruits, dry hop finish. Mouthfeel is somewhat thin but decently carbonated. Overall drinkability is pretty good. The abv is well hidden. This is a decent beer at a good price. Would try again."
"Mouthfeel was medium bodied and the drinkability was good. Even with the 8ish % ABV its a semi session beer if that even makes sense."
"D - A pretty good beer that has an interesting taste that pretty enjoyable worth trying sometime"
"Moderate malts continue to the taste, somewhat complex with caramel, nut, brown sugar and a touch of dried fruit. A sweetness envelops it all making the flavors a bit difficult to ascertain. The same sweetness, certainly not overdone, helps give the beer a smooth feel. Finishes dry with a quick close. Good carbonation and richer in body than most ales of the style."
"My brother in law raves about this stuff, as he is from Tucson. Pours dark brown, almost looks like a porter. Aroma of toffee and caramel, with some dried fruits. Taste is dominated by alcohol, then the sweet malt and caramel flavors come through. Earthy finish. Decent beer, don't think I could have more than 2 at one time. Like Tucson, more is not better."
"D - it goes down good."
"I dont get hung up on all the nuances of beer..if it tastes good, I will drink it.."
"Not too impressed, but it works. I could really see it being a more cold weather beer, something to warm you up a bit. It does pack a decent ABV although I couldn't really taste it. Worth a try..."
"This is an interesting brew and though the flavours I mentioned say it is very complex, I feel the flavours are actually on the subdued side. That's ok for an English Brown but with the bigger abv content than is the norm, I guess I expected more. Still pretty tasty brew though."
"Drinkability is quite good. This is a nice brown ale, and it hides it's strong 8.2% ABV quite well. Enjoy a bottle, but I would probably only go for one, maybe two at most."
"That a small quibble, as this is utterly enjoyable, and monstrously drinkable for a beer of this strength, complexity, and uniqueness."
"D: I found this to be a good, easy-to-consume beer overall. Nice balance, bet it would drink well with food, such as a good nutty aged cheese or something off the grill. I'd give this another go when we next pay AZ a visit."
"As brown ales go this is one of the strangest I've tasted. Not a bad flavor, just strange. I don't quite know what to make of it."
"I pciked this up in Sedona, saw the name ""Old Monkeyshine"" and thought it was a bwine. Did not read the label..dooooh! It was a good English ale. Poured a darkbrown with a ruby highlight, nice dirty white head, average carbonation, taste was of some coffee, choc and something else that I could not pick up on. Maybe the taste uds were off. It was a good drink and the ABV is perfect. Good beer."
"M/D: Carbonation is just right and helps to produce a creamy medium bodied beer. Drinkability is good on this one as well. I have to admit, after my first experience with Nimbus, I am quite surprised by this offering. It has a lot going on for it with the hop character, and although maybe not totally appropriate for the style, really go a long way."
"An interesting flavor, especially considering the style. The only real deterrent is the tartness, which is fine, but it creates an unwelcome pucker in the mouth...otherwise this is a real enjoyable, rather unique take on a style that could use a few cracks upside the head. Thanks to msubulldog25 (he with The Righteous Beercloset) for sending and allowing me to sample my first-ever Arizona beer."
"Thanks to tayner...another extra!"
"Overall: a nice winter warmer type beer, it'd be good on a cold day (but how many of those are there in Tucson?) Good, drinkable, and one of my favorites from Nimbus, but not all that remarkable."
"Easy to drink for a big brown, pretty nice."
"Mouthfeel is good, carbonation is ok. Very drinkable for an 8% ABV beer, I finished the whole growler in a sitting. When I visit Nimbus on my birthday I pretty much drink as many as are bought for me, and the last one is as good as the first. Bottom line: this is the beer that should make Nimbus famous, and if you've only had Old Monkeyshine in bottles you owe it to yourself to try it on tap."
"D: I enjoyed this ale from Nimbus, my first from this company, makes me interested to try their other beers."
"12 oz stubbie. The beer is a deep and sinister amber color with a 2-finger ivory head that sits nicely as a finger of foam over after settling. Clarity is good and there are nice fine bubbles cascading up the sides of my glass. The aroma is rife with raisin malt, moderate caramel sweetness, and a healthy smokey phenolic character that I wasn't expecting. Its not bad at all, just was a shock. The flavor is spot on to the aroma, hitting with raisin and smoke initially, moving to a more rounded caramel sweetness, ladened with peppery hop that may have been more brilliant when this was closer to the bottling date. The finish moves back to a caramel-soaked rainsin and a mild bitter bite. There is a touch of orangey sweetness throughout as well. Mouthfeel is thick with a very mild carbonation, with a fairly strong drying quality on the finish. Overall, I am enjoying this one. I'm just starting to feel a little warmth in my stomach after making my way through most of the bottle. I think the phenols add a nice touch to it."
"The color was a medium dark brown when poured, with tan foam and lots of lace. The smell of Tobacco was evident in the aroma, with a hint of bittersweet chocolate. But after the first sip, I got a tart Tobacco/Chocolate flavor with just a hint of roasted malts. I think the Tobacco was the main stand out on this brown ale. I never tasted a brown ale with this kind of flavor at all!"
"A nice brew sent by bennetj17 and Solomon420 for my BA annv."
"A little overly sweet, but enjoyable. Kinda what you'd expect from a southern style brown ale hovering around 8%. I don't think I could drink more than one in a sitting, just because it gets a little tiresome towards the end."
"Mouthfee/Drinkability; mouthfeel is a bit fuller thatn I'm used to for a brown, but it seems to fit this flaover profile just right, and the drinkability is pretty darn good. The only thing than would keep this from be a good session beer, for me, is the alcohol."
"Notes: Astringent at times. Tobacco and slightly oxidized. I didn't particularly like its lack of focus as it jumps from taste to taste and when it tries to meld together it doesn't work well. OK."
"D: Very drinkable. Too drinkable for the alcohol."
"D- could have a few of these, not too many because they are a tad pricey, and suprisingly high in the ABV percentage, a good beer, would drink again"
"Pours a nice dark brown color, nice carbonation, nice little creamy tan head which does not last long, some islands and sticky lacing remained. The nose is malty, roasty, and some caramel going on in there. The taste is very nice of slight roasted malts and a nice bitter dry hop finish. Alcohol is hidden very well. Medium body. Very drinkable, the best Nimbus by far for me. A nice surprise."
"This beer has morphed quite a bit over the last year and I find that most of the changes are positive ones. I will probably call this experiment a success and will buy more of this to age across a span of a few years, just out of curiosity. Glad I tried it."
"Mouthfeel is a bit thin but carbonation levels seem to be good. Pretty easy to drink, much more so than my previous try at this brewery. Alcohol is well hidden, basically nonexistant. I could have a couple of these in a night easily."
"Thanks to Solomon420 for enabling me to try this as a throw in!!"
"Pours a fairly dark brown with a short lived tan head. Scents of dried fruit, malt, and weak coffee. Roasted flavors prevalent throughout, coffee, prunes, and sweetness with a slight bitterness in the finish. Not a big fan of coffee scented or darker roasted brews. Thanks to Solomon420 for the bottle."
"This drinks very easy for the 8.2abv this posesses. Probably the best AZ beer I had (more reviews to follow). Will save the rest of these for the too soon cold nights that precede winter"
"I'd give this one a try...not for everyone, but I enjoyed it."
"This is an amazingly drinkable tasty potent brew. I could easily make a session out of this one. If It was available in my cool climate i would always have some of these on hand. Very yummy brew, anyone who likes this style should find a way to check it out."
"D: Bigtime thanks to Damian for sending me a bunch of these. Very happy I've got a few left. A good change of pace in these hot summer months. Highly recommended."
"Overall, and outstanding session brew! This is a good one to try and very nice for the style."
"This is the last of the Nimbus beers I was sent and I have to say this is a damn nice brewery and I have enjoyed the hell out of these Nimbus beers. Malty, spicy aroma with hints of tobacco, caramel and bread pudding. Deep brown with a small head, but ample lacing. Sweet caramel malt and brown sugar flavors with a hint of spice and a plesant thick breadiness. Very nicely done beer from a brewery worthy of more notice."
"Pours a beautiful dark brown with a tan/khaki color head that foams very nicely and leaves nice lace. Good head retention, just to my liking. Smell is slightly sweet and bitter at the same time, gives a good indication of the taste. The taste is excellently balanced. A perfect mix of malt sweetness and bitter aftertaste. Feels exceptionally smooth in your mouth with nice bitterness to balance it out. I love this beer, it is definately my favorite beer. The only problem I have with this beer is the fact that it is 8.2% ABV so you have to be careful with how much you drink, it catches up with you. This beer is definately worth a try, my favorite beer I have tried so far."
"Notes: Drinkability is much higher than I expected from the aroma. This seems highly sessionable for an 8% beer. Not unbelievably outstanding or anything, but definitely worth your time!"
"Mouthfeel is smooth and medium bodied with a good creamy maltiness. Even at slightly over 8% alcohol, I'm finding this quite drinkable. I wouldn't mind having another. Thanks to autumnaldave for the sample, being it my first, but hopefully not last from Nimbus."
"Beer is good. Happy big ESB beering."
"Drinkability & Notes Â– Overall an interesting beer that is pretty easy to drink despite the elevated alcohol. Glad I had the chance to try it."
"Bottle: Poured a dark brown color ale with a medium dark brown foamy head with pretty god retention. Aroma contains lots of sweet roasted malt and toffee. The sweet roasted malt also dominates taste with a light hop presence at the end. Body is a bit too thin for my liking but alcohol is well hidden."
"First, what is an ""English Style Ale""? I would not have had to have lived in Yorkshire to know that there is no single Englihs style ale, and even if there is a typical English pub ale, say a bitter, this beer would not be it. In fact, I would argue that Old Monkeyshine more closely resembles a strong scotch ale. Getting Nimbus' taxonomy, the beer is not bad. It has a plesant deep mahagony color. The aroma is a bit sweet and alcoholic but not unapatising. Hints of rasions and caramel, finishes slightly tart. Supprisingly drinkable for its strength. It might do quite nicely on a cool desert winters night."
"This beer really surprised me. While it's listed as a brown ale on here, on Nimbus' website, it's called a strong ale. At 8.2% ABV, you can't really disagree with Nimbus. When I poured it and saw that it was a deep, dark brown with a small head, my mind flashed back to Tommyknocker's Imperial Nut Brown, a highly-touted, highly-alcoholic brown ale that I really didn't like. Monkeyshine is completely different, though; in the Tommyknocker, the alcohol was the dominant flavor, while here it's just a hint. I'm amazed how well it's hidden. I'm more amazed that it tastes so good, malty, sweet and brown sugary in the beginning, with a lingering bitter finish. I gave it a 4.5 in drinkability simply because it's as easy to drink as the Yuengling Traditional Lager I had last night, but with more flavor and double the alcohol. I really wish I could get this here, it's right up there with the best. Hearty thanks go out to Gueuzedude for allowing me to try this wonderful beer."
"Nice malty taste with a little more hop bite than expected, maybe too much. The alcohol is pretty well hidden, until it hits the gut. Middle of the sip is similar to the smell...with hints of raisins and sugars. Finish is of slight alcohol and hops."
"Well to be honest, at first I didnt like the taste too much. Didnt know what to make of it at first. I think I drank the first bottle too cold. The next day I drank another bottle more towards room temperature and wow, what flavour it had. Its noted as a brown ale, but if you hold it up the sunset, the colours come alive. More of a dark red/honey hue. I have to think that it was partly the mood I was in, and the setting, that allowed me to enjoy it this time. I would definately buy some more."
"This beer is a deep amber color. It is fairly clear with just a hint of chill haze. It smell malty sweet with a bit of fruitiness in the nose. Nice full bodied with a malty expression. This beer tenderly coats your mouth. This is a very well balanced beer, as an English expression of a strong ale should be. There is a hint of hop flavor that helps to carry the maltiness of this brew."
"Tasted at the 2002 Oregon Brewers Festival. Light brown color. Aroma is small white and foamy. Aroma is malty, nutty and very sweet. Deep malt flavor, not very hoppy. Lighter bodied . Nice flavor. Rich and round. Mouthfeel is full and round. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"Would be interesting to know if they use high alpha/high cohumulone hops in all their beers. There was a harsh taste in both beers I tried."
"A nice deep mahogany color on the pour, the head is moderate in size, the texture spumescent, beige in color and as it dissipates the left over lace a nice coating on the glass. Floral nose, sweet malt, caramel and quite fresh and pleasing to the senses, with the start sweet and malt, the top is middling in its feel to the palate. Finish is a Â“Hop HeadsÂ” delight; boom right in the palate as the hops over run your taste buds, mildly acidic, dry as a desert bone aftertaste and a real treat for this old strong ale lover."
"A very fine beer -- seems more like a barley wine than a brown ale to me.  Probably the best one I've ever had, and I'm fairly picky when it comes to the style.  A terrific beer."
