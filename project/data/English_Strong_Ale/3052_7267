3.43,-10,3.5,3.5,3.25,3.75,3.5,"nothing about this beer says holidays to me, or English strong ale for that matter. more of an dark English mild, save for the still modest alcohol by volume. dark nut brown color, half inch of lazy tan head that's relatively stagnant, doesn't go anywhere. the nose is sweet and earthy English malts, chocolate malt, and a sweetness I don't all the way like. lots of stale smelling ale yeast too, give it a funny metallic ting. I don't dislike the flavor, which is all grin forward, dark but not unmalted roast barley dark. not as sweet as it smells either, which I appreciate. no holiday spice at all, somewhat of a letdown in a beer that's not particularly flavorful. it reminds me of a lower quality sam smiths product from a yeast standpoint, which some may love, but I don't favor. it lacks the properties that make a holiday beer special for me. rich and robust in body though, which helps a lot, and only gently carbonated, giving it the appearance of a much bigger ale. nothing special here overall in my eyes.","StonedTrippin","Dec 03, 2013"

I'm olfactorily challenged so aroma scores are a bit sketchy. Flavour is roasted malt with plum and fruitcake as you'd expect. Good bitterness on the back palate so I didn't find it cloying at all. Boozy? according to Doktorhop. I guess it is a little but the flavour is big enough to pull it off. A bit chewy at the end but that's just lip-smackin' style and I found that all in all this is a really pleasant ale and I would like some more.","rjimlad","Jul 28, 2012"

With all of the dark roasted malts the body is still slightly thin and the nut profile and roasted bitter notes are a bit much. I wish the sweetness was a little more prominent creating more balance.

The flavor is relatively sweet but nowhere near cloying. I can see what they're getting at with the "nutty" descriptor, but it's more earth to my palate.

3.68,-3.4,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Poured from a unique-looking bottle into a pint glass. The beer was dark brown, clear, with a thin head. The aroma was mostly toasted malt, biscuity and nutty. Same with the flavor, toasted and burnt malts and a hint of some light fruits. The beer was full-bodied and filling, nicely complex but not really my style.","TurdFurgison","Dec 11, 2007"
3.92,2.9,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"The pour is a somewhat hazy reddish brown with a modest light tan creamy head that fails quickly leaving a velum like coating of lace. Nose has a sweet rich malt aroma, caramel, and a bit of hops, spicy and pleasant. Front is quite sweet, decently malted, with a touch of the bittering hops at the back, moderate in feel. Finish has a fair to middling acidity, the hops delectable in their spiciness, sweet and dry aftertaste lingers long on the palate, a quite nice beer.","Gusler","Dec 11, 2007"

5,31.2,5,5,5,5,5,"I wonder to what degree the apparent perfection of this beer depends on its freshness. (It just arrived from England by way of normal state distribution.) The aromas of this reddish brown liquid are an alluring mixture of caramel malts, vanilla, cream, butter, baked red apples, red currants, sweet strawberries, brown bread crust, mashed hazelnuts and almonds, coffee and straw. Voluptuous creamy texture with a biscuity crumb lifts the bread and fruit flavors until they meet with oozing bitter tannins. The resolution is bright and fresh, bittersweet, and fascinating. Irresistable texture and organization. Astonishing drinkability.","putnam","Dec 06, 2007"

3.73,-2.1,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,"Easily a session beer as it is somewhat thin bodied and lighter in flavors.","yemenmocha","Sep 22, 2007"
3.63,-4.7,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Pours a clear deep reddish brown. Cheery wood. No head to speak of. Aroma is sugary sweet. Candied pears. Taste is lightly toasted grain and mild pear- not nearly as slick and syrupy as expected. Body is medium. Aftertaste has a bit of an astringent bite, but that fades rather quickly into a tart(?) slightly sour(?). Rather nice. Not sure if 5.5% qualifies as a strong ale, but I was not disappointed. Ha! I just noticed the pears on the front label I guess the pear was intentional!","sacfly","Sep 20, 2007"
3.78,-0.8,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"M&D: softly-carbonated for a bottled ale, and the body is just medium for its alc. strength. Overall this is a quality nut-malty as well as fruity premium bitter, and the ideal body and balanced flavour make it a more-ish pint to enjoy.","wl0307","Feb 05, 2007"
3.08,-19.2,3.5,3,3,3.5,3,"A strong porter - chesnuts, caramel, woodsmoke, dried fruit like raisins, fits in perfectly with the holidays as a warming, thick brew -I'm not much of a porter lover, but this was quite drinkable. Bottle tasted only. Color is bread crust brown, texture is very smooth","dalri","Beers"
3.68,-3.4,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"D- A very sessionable ale, however nothing that suggests its something out of the ordinary.","seanyfo","0"
