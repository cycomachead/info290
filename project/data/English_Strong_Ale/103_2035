3.47,-0.9,3,3.5,4,2.5,3,"Overall- I want badly to like this beer and have since I discovered Middle Ages. Winter styles are some of my favorites, and this is an interesting take. It's definitely got their signature style, and has elements that bring to mind both Kilt Tilter and Swallow Wit, but it drinks something like what I imagine an imperial macro lager to be, which is decidedly painful for me to say. There's something worthwhile there, but it needs to be tweaked before it stacks up against the brewery's other excellent offerings. I definitely recommend drinking it at room temp or just below.","Lawl3ss","Jan 13, 2012"
3.32,-5.1,3,3.5,3.5,3,3,"O - For what I paid, I'm a bit disappointed. Still, it's better than adjunct stuff by far (not that that says much). Middle Ages has had some good selections, and some that are just okay. I feel like this ale falls into the latter. Still, not sad that I at least tried it. Unfortunately I've got another 5 to try after this round.","leansean88","Jan 07, 2012"

There is a bit of harsh assertive carbonic acid behind the gently sweet malt backbone. I'm a bit disappointed in the relatively light body of this beer, as to what I've come to expect from winter beer varieties.

It has a sweet, malty, toasty aroma. It's pretty light bodied, a little flat and a little watery. The finish is a little scratchy. It doesn't taste as sweet as it smells. A pretty strong, green bitterness dominates the taste. It's quite well balanced and no particular flavor really sticks out. The toastiness is prominent and it's perhaps a bit nutty.

Aromas of roasted malt, hops that give some idea of earthiness, slightly burnt brown sugar and a slight orange and buttery scent. Pretty inviting aroma, though it does feel like it is missing a little something. The flavor is good; malt really comes through here highlighting caramel and roastiness. Some fruit flavors come out and I think that could be from the yeast. Beer drinks well but if this was to be a winter warmer where spices should stick out, they where not noticeable, at least to me.

Some raisin and white grapes follow along with a bit of vanilla, then a mellow bitterness of citrus and fresh cut grass in the finish. Medium in body with good carbonation.

When chilled, it has a bitter metallic finish that is not so pleasing, but upon warming it is very nice. Feel is heavy but again has the bitterness to pull it off nicely.

Malty and caramel hit the palate first and lasts throughout. Some hops and fruits show up in the middle along with a light hint of spice. Mouthfeel was medium and was quite creamy and smooth.

The flavor is somewhat similar to a fullers esb, with the buttery/diacetyl tones followed by a slight hop bitter on the back of my tongue. I like it. The feel is moderate and creamy, some of it sticks on the tongue. Not a bad brew. I like the use of the butter character in it, as it works well with the feel and the hop.

3.45,-1.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"The 12 oz. bottle arrived in the BIF X-Mas package from shippos. The body was clear and reddish amber in color and lacked much head, although carbonation was pretty good. Aroma sweet honey malt with the Ringwood yeast signature movie theatre popcorn. The taste was soft and fruity, but a bit watery. The Ringwood off flavors generally well in check in this beer. Carbonation was prickly on the tongue, and the aftertaste was salty. The alcohol was felt in the warmth in the stomach, and the beer drank stronger than the actual alcohol content.","rajendra82","Dec 30, 2004"
3.05,-12.9,3.5,3.5,2.5,4,3,"Drinkability & Notes: If this brew cleaned up its act it would be damn good  sadly it did not win me over at all.","Jason","Dec 28, 2004"
4,14.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Dark ruddy amber/red with burnt orange edges. Aroma is very British in character with a few tea-like aromas mixed in with some nicely subdued ringwood yeast esterst. This stuff is definately still fruity and tea-like on the nost with a nice subdued hop aroma in the back of the nose as well. Taste is interesting and strong up front with the ringwood esters. The middle is bready/biscuity with a certain funk that really makes this beer interesting. The finish is a bit rough, with the subdued hop flavors mixing in with a somethwhat "hot" alcohol flavor. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, and this beer improves when it is allowed to warm up. Drinkability is good as well. Good, interesting, and another winner from MA.","francisweizen","Nov 29, 2004"
4.08,16.6,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"well I'll tell you this- I've been sitting/walking around the house cold with a blanket wrapped around me for a few hours, and finally now i am getting quite warmed up. Thanks, Wizard! Bubbles the kitten at Middle Ages said I'd definitely like this one, and to please rub her tummy some more... So I did and I took home a bottle of this. Looks a bit like the colour of weak tea- orange/reddish brownish. Small, off-white head of tiny bubbles. there's a crescent moon of no head in there. kind of cool. It smells a bit funky- sourish, grassy but in a dirty kind of way... not the best in my opinion. Tastes much better though, yeah. Not dirty, but clean like the snow outside while yer sitting in front of the fireplace with the blankets thrown in a pile next to you cos yer all warmed up and cozy. It almost tastes a bit grapey actually. Dry finish, very dry. Very good. Mouthfeel is just the perfect amount of carbonation, very nice. Drinkability--- good, but it would get to me after a while, as in, I would pass out from the heat. But in a good way. I recommend the Wizard if yer cold and need some warming up.","erica","Nov 27, 2004"

3.25,-7.1,3,3,3.5,3.5,3,"Definite hop presence on this one, but there is an alcohol tinged malt presence in the background that hold it together. Hops are nicely herbal, and not extremely bitter as they can be, though finish is a little harsh.","cbl2","Jun 06, 2004"
4,14.3,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Poured into an imperial pint glass, frothy 1" light tan head formed, which laced well. Brew is an amber hue and has a pleasant malty aroma, almost smells like a bag of pellets from my parent's grain bin. Taste is surprisingly up-front with hops that were not apparent in the nose, and rounds out with the grains that I expected. Not often you get surprised like that. reasonably well balanced with malt and hops, but the malt wins the battle here by the time of the swallow. Mouthfeel is a little rough, but overall a nice brew.","ppoitras","May 07, 2004"
3.65,4.3,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Appearance: Ruby caramel amber brown thine cream head specks of lacing. Aroma: English style malts winter warmer like caramel and butterscotch touch of earthy hops, with a slight spicy character. Taste: English varieties of malts give off a nice mix of toasty butterscotch sweetness and finishes with a mild bitterness, overall tame but well crafted English style winter warmer. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied slightly sticky perfect carbonation. Drinkability: Pays homage to other English brewers with a very nice rendition of a traditional old ale, tasty wouldn't pass sampling this one again in the future.","WVbeergeek","May 02, 2004"
3.23,-7.7,3.5,3,3.5,3,3,"Not a ton of nose just some light hints of caramel as you wiff. Slightly off white (light tan) dense 1/4 inch head after the pour. Dark peach filtered look in the glass. Very dry earthy hop taste to the inital sip of the brew. The beer also has a crusty malt base to it as well. The mouth seems of medium to light thickness.. a little light and lacks the coating nature of many Old Ales I have had. Very dry on the finish. You will be left with a sandpaper tongue.","frank4sail","Apr 21, 2004"

4.17,19.1,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"P ours a light brown with a definant orange hue with almost no head but that was expected,aroma very orangy and also some chocolate thrown in there as well. Nice big malty beer with a caramel taste emerging right away with deep fruitiness that pierces right thru every other flavor the alcohol becomes more prevelant as it warms.A real nice winter brew pretty warming and flavorful.","oberon","Mar 31, 2004"
4,14.3,4,4,4,4,4,"The beer pours a dark amber color with a 1/4" off-white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a sweet malty scent with the fruitiness of Ringwood yeast. The taste is good. It is a smooth drinking malty brew with light hopping and a fruity yeast finish. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a good seasonal. It has great malt character; a fine sessions ale.","WesWes","Feb 20, 2004"
3.17,-9.4,3,3.5,3,3.5,3,"poured a nice deep medium brown with nice medium head....notes of the normal christmas spice, nutmegy spicey aroma...with nose hints of fruitiness...had a decent bite....spices not too overpowering and leaving room for hoppiness with a nice aftertaste of fruit...i'd say an average christmas beer","hollicetales","Feb 12, 2004"
4.07,16.3,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"A hazey amber colour with a thick head that slowlt dissipates to a fine white lace. The scent was of citrus hops and nutmeg. Very nice. The taste was very fruity, it had a lemon taste to it. It was Very much of the season. Nutmeg and coreander was what I got. It also had a nice bitter bite to it from what I think was cascade hops. A very nice ale.","CBFanWish","Jan 21, 2004"
3.17,-9.4,3,3.5,3,3.5,3,"This was medium bodied, had a slight crispness and dryness on the tongue. Dryness continued during the aftertaste. Overall an average drinkability due to the boredom that settled in before I finished this off. A good beer for a newbie expanding his/her tastebuds.","Gavage","Jan 08, 2004"
3.38,-3.4,4.5,4,3,3.5,3,"Does not help to have a moderate mouthfeel with a sudsy texture. Seems like it needs some time to settle down, but will it do so well and should you have to?","nomad","Jan 02, 2004"
3.92,12,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"I've found that Middle Ages' choice of yeast has strained other brews, but in this one it's spot on, and enhances rather than detracts.","shirfan","Dec 14, 2003"
3.7,5.7,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Nice caramel malt base with a mildly hoppy and herbal aroma. I believe their must be some kind of herb or spice in this one. Has a nice drinkability but unfortuantely, mine was little too cold and I did not have a chance to let it warm up to see what happens. Another solid beer from Middle Ages and I will look for this again.","beernbbq","Dec 04, 2003"

3.2,-8.6,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3,"The taste is slighltly fruity/malty with a little caramel in there too. Moderately strong hop kick at the end. Mouthfeel is pretty solid between the carbonation and the alcohol. Not a bad little winter ale at all.","yankeeheel","Nov 03, 2003"
4,14.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Drinkability: A nice Strong Ale.. this style usually has me bailing out after a pint... but in this case, pour me another! Middle Ages continues to impress the hell out of me.","DagFishHead","Oct 31, 2003"
3.92,12,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"The color a unclouded deep brown with the head modest and frothy, the color a light tan as it evaporates, the lace forms a fine covering upon the glass. Sweet fruity nose and Ringwood yeast is quite noticeable, malts also right there. Start sweet, middle moderate in feel and the finish briskly carbonated and the hops pleasing and spicy, dry as a bone aftertaste, a good drinkable beer.","Gusler","Oct 26, 2003"
3.88,10.9,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours a light tan/dirty white foamy head. It's fading fast, I can see it shrink, wouln't last a minute. The liquid is glowing, redish mahogany in color. There's a bit of lace hanging around after the first few sips. It smells a bit sweet and malty, with a hint of butterscotch, and just a little alcohol. The taste at first is rather malty, which fades off to a mild bitterness. Not sure how it compares to other strong ales, but this is pretty drinkable. It is flavorful without any overpowering flavors, nice balance.","HappyHourHero","Oct 22, 2003"
3.71,6,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Very, very awesome. This was my first Middle Ages beer, and I've been enchanted with their labels and the whole medieval thing. I didn't know what to expect, but i was pleasantly surprised to find that it's extremely british in style, all the way down to the particular hopping. I thought it tasted a lot like Brakspear Vintage Henley. Strong flavor, agressive hoppiness, a bit of alcohol taste, and a smooth sweetness. Right on, brothers.","UnionMade","Aug 29, 2003"

3.88,10.9,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Poured an interesting coppery amber. Sticky, rocky head with good staying power. Not a lot going on in the aroma - mildly sweet malt notes. Fairly malty with toffee and caramel, and just the barest hint of milk chocolate at the edge. Finished with a solid but rather blunt hops bitterness that lingered at the back of the tongue. Overall, quite English in character. I'm surprised to see that the abv is 6.3% - my impression was of a higher alcohol content. Overall, a pleasant beer, but fell short of its full potential.","Brent","Mar 13, 2003"
3.88,10.9,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Beautiful color of clear, deep, burgundy-amber. Somewhat sweet aroma, but barely imperceptible to me; some piney hits in the smell as well. Assertive malts within the malt-hop balance, but certainly not a malty beer in itself; hops serve merely as bittering and balance. More toward a fine English strong ale, and yummy.","Hobbz","Mar 09, 2003"
4.5,28.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Glowing amber under a roof of fluffy bubbles drifting gobs of lace and cheer. Spicy fireside nose of hefty malt dusted with hops and comfort.

3.33,-4.9,4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"It is dark copper, with a thin cream colored head. It does leave some thin lacing. It smells smoky to me with hops and fruit. It has a taste that is hoppy and still tastes a little smoky to me. Good mouthfeel and drinkable. The smokiness was not expected and I do not know if that is the "real" taste here or just how I perceive a flavor I am not accustomed to.","doho95fu","Dec 23, 2002"
