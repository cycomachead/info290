3.89,6.6,3,4,4,3.5,4,"Dark brown with som ruby highlights near the bottom of the pint glass. Thin, off-white head that dissipates quickly. Lots of sediment which was hard to avoid pouring. Dark, roasted malt aroma with some caramel notes as well as raisin and licorice undertones, and a whiff of ethanol. The flavor is malty, featuring more roasted malts adding a hint of chocolate and caramel. Little to no hop presence. Medium body, bordering on being slightly thin or watery.","goldbot","Jul 22, 2011"
3.87,6,3.5,4,4,3,4,"Overall / Drinkability: I wonder if this would best on cask rather than in a bottle. It's tasty, smells interesting, and overall, I could see myself having another one - a full pint no less.","damndirtyape","Jul 17, 2011"

3.65,0,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"D: Certainly a drinkable brew, but definitely unique in that I didn't think a lighter alcohol version of an ale existed which had the same characteristics as usually much darker stouts/porters.","thekanna","Jan 21, 2010"
3.85,5.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"The body was pleasantly full without being heavy or filling. Drinkability was very nice, smooth and easy. Overall, a nice easy brew that's worth your time.","beertunes","Nov 02, 2009"
3.38,-7.4,4,3.5,3.5,3,3,"Quite a lot of body on it, but it does feel a bit thin right at the back, and incredibly drying. It feels like a big hangover-inducing beer.","laituegonflable","Jun 21, 2009"
3.45,-5.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,2.5,"D: I don't understand this beer. It has a ton of flavors, but they're not necessarily the best. I'm pretty bored of it already, and don't anticipate having it again. Its flavor combination is remarkable, but nonetheless off-putting. Given the amount of soy sauce and ginger, I can only imagine how this beer would taste with sushi.","dudecandle","Apr 09, 2009"
3.73,2.2,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"I wouldn't classify this as an English Strong Ale, not at 5.5% ABV and with no real strong alcohol presence. I didn't take notes why sampling the beer last night, but two words pretty much define the beer, the first is ginger and the other is caramel malts. Put the two together, with some modest carbonation, some complex sweet malts, a bit of leafy hop in the finish, and this is the beer in a nutshell. It is a nice, complex, enjoyable beer that I will re-review in order to write a fuller, more comprehensive review at a later time.","albern","Dec 12, 2008"
3.32,-9,3,3.5,3.5,3,3,"The aroma is sweet. It's got toasted malt, cola, soy/A1 sauce, spices/herbs, ginger, and fruit. The appearance is deep amber with a small head. The flavor is like the the aroma but has a papery finish. The palate is thin. Overall it's quite interesting but not great.","nick76","Nov 30, 2008"

3.6,-1.4,4,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Pour a chocolate brown color with a nice fluffy light brown head that settled into a thick cap. The aroma is of buttery malt, minerals, raisins, and spice. The taste is of rusty water, very slight chocolate, raisins, pine and allspice. The look and aroma scream malty but the tastes fails to deliver, though there is a nice spice kick. The feel is light and watery, well carbonated and finishes with a slight malt bitterness. An average English ale that looks and smells great but disappoints some in the flavor. I was expecting a more robust malt flavor.","Gmann","0"
3.73,2.2,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"D: Super easy drinking. I would kill for this on cask. That would be mind blowing. Until then just good. Not something I would seek out again.","aerozeppl","Feb 12, 2008"

3.73,2.2,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Pours chestnut brown, with a light tan head that leaves a slight lace down the glass. Aroma is mild dark malt with some notes of molasses and dark fruit. Flavor has some alcohol notes, although mild, along with more molasses and faint dark malt and raisins. Mouthfeel is low, finish is very slightly cloying.","beerking1","Sep 27, 2007"

3.6,-1.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"A reddish brown beer with a big malty nose, this is a spicy brew with a real ginger note to the finish. The drinkability is high in part to the smoothness and the nice blend of all the parts. Not an every day beer but rather a treat that stands apart from the usual English ales.","canucklehead","Apr 07, 2007"

3.73,2.2,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"At 5.5% this is a strong ale? Regardless it's an interesting beer. Basically it tastes like a very mild english dark ale, or almost porter with an overwhelming Gruit flavor. Cool and interesting beer.","taez555","Mar 19, 2007"

3.18,-12.9,4,3.5,3,3,3,"D - Alright. This beer is heavily spiced and it has a dominant ginger presence. Not worth seeking out, but worth a try if you stumble across it. It flavor is what I would expect from a typical bland English ale with some heavy ginger extract added. Maybe brewed with some molasses in the malt.","mrasskicktastic","Jan 28, 2007"
3.22,-11.8,2,2.5,4,3,3,"Didn't care for it at first, because I really wasn't expecting something flavored like this. And I didn't think it was too great until it warmed up a bit. I highly recommend letting this one sit out of the fridge for ~30 minutes. It gets much much better, more so than most beers, and becomes easily drinkable and enjoyable. Kind of a Jekyll and Hyde brew. Give it a chance.","smurfyou","Dec 13, 2006"

3.67,0.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"While i love cardamon (coffee and curries!), and while i enjoyed its role in this beer i feel its bitterness affects this brews sessionability. That being said, this is a unique and tasty brew, and something that anyone who enjoys cardamon should visit from time to time. Glad i got to try this one and hope to drink it again sometime.","demcorhip","Nov 26, 2006"
3.28,-10.1,4,3.5,3,4,3,"If nothing else this is one very unique ale, a real spice-fest. Many thanks to rudge75 and fisherman34 for sending this out via CanBIF #2.","IronDjinn","Nov 25, 2006"

3.97,8.8,3,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Poured clear reddish brown with a good light brown head that was mostly lasting with excellent lacing. Flavors were of Ginger, roasted malt and caramel nutty accents with a medium body and a smooth texture. A little unusual at the first taste but began to like it more as I went along.","jclzony","Nov 10, 2006"
3.53,-3.3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Typical English stuff, but with some twists. Quite dark looking, with a nearly opaque ruby hue, good retention and lacing. Smells very sweet with dark toffee, caramel malts and added sweetness. Tastes very sweet, nearly wort-y. Flavors carry a strong toffee and cola flavor that I found odd (kinda like Mr. Pibbs). Very toasty and confectionate sweet. The feel is nearly thick and cloying with a light alcohol heat and spiciness that cut through the malts. The finish reveals a ginger-like (hot) flavor and feel, piney hops, and sweet berries. Strange that these flavors show up only so late.","BEERchitect","Oct 24, 2006"
3.5,-4.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Bottle courtesy of piscator34: Poured a deep burgundy color ale with a small foamy head with average retention. Aroma of strange spices with some roasted malt. Taste is best described as a spiced English porter/winter warmer with a medium bitter finish. I honestly have a hard time identifying the mix of spices included here but would say that it was quite enjoyable. Body is about average with medium to low carbonation. Interesting beer is doesnt even start to describe this.","Phyl21ca","Oct 11, 2006"
4.1,12.3,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"The color was dark red, but deeper than the amber browns you may be used to. In short, this beer is for those who are tired of the ordinary interpretations of common styles. Very original, but maybe not for everyone. I will purchase it again","MerkinMan","Aug 09, 2006"
4,9.6,4,4,4,4,4,"Morocco Ale is an impressively distinctive beer and is unlike anything that I've ever had. It's easily my favorite of the Daleside offerings and is a beer that I'd love to drink again, if I could only remember where I bought it. If you enjoy spiced ales, this one definitely deserves a purchase. "Luck to Levins whilst t'Kent flows."","BuckeyeNation","Beers"
3.82,4.7,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Taste has a lot of the sweet-and-sour characteristics that the nose suggests. Lots of spice and packed with dark roasted malts. Caramel/Molasses sweetness that isn't cloying, and a mild earthy hop presence. The ginger is very evident on the palate and in the dry spicy finish. Mouthfeel isn't overcarbonated but feels a bit thin like I find a lot of British beers tend to. Regardless, a hefty spiced stout with lots of flavour, and drinkable, but this might get a bit much after a couple pints.","trevorwideman","0"
3.3,-9.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,2.5,3,"Dark brown in colour with medium carbonation. Aromas of ginger, soya, carrot, and earthy hops. More ginger in the mouth, along with notes of chocolate, coriander, roasted malt, caramel and teriyaki sauce. A bit too overcarbonated and light bodied for the style. It reminds me a bit of an Asian salad dressing that my wife makes. A somewhat bizzare beer, but still pretty good.","fisherman34","Apr 25, 2006"
4.03,10.4,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Pours a four finger, light brown head that slowly fades to a thin layer leaving a good lace. Deep maroon color. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Malty, bready nose. Starts sweet, malty bready, clean finish. Nice dark ale. $4.35 for a 500ml bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma.","jdhilt","Apr 17, 2006"
4.15,13.7,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"M&D: full of body yet soft on the palate, whilst the freshness from carbonation is retained just beautifully; the spicy content mingles smoothly with a potent malty body, making it a spicy yet firm dark ale, unlike some other spicy ales which sadly lose the "foundation". An unusual and quite delicious ale well worth a try!","wl0307","Apr 14, 2006"
4.1,12.3,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Supple on the tongue and easily sent down the gullet...for those who enjoy the flavor of ginger. If you're not one of those, stay clear away and shut your wallet.","feloniousmonk","Apr 06, 2006"
4,9.6,4,4,4,4,4,"The predominant flavor is an assertive caramel-candy malt, and on first pass the beer seems a bit one-dimensional. After a few more sips, however, the judicious spice flavors emerge, slightly herbal and the overall impression is a winter warmer. As the beer temperature came up, a bit more complexity developed in the malt, and bitter chocolate and coffee came through, evolving into almost porter-like beer. Quite the chameleon.","Brent","Feb 24, 2006"
3.65,0,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"The beer pours a dark amber/brown color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice malty scent that boasts of pale and crystal malts along with a strong herbal aroma. It's quite refreshing, but I can't quite put my finger on the aroma. I guess it's ginger and cinnamon. The taste is decent. It has a dry herbal flavor that is slow going down and spicey on the finish. It has a ginger beer feel. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a unique beer with good aroma. I'm just not sold on the taste.","WesWes","Feb 12, 2006"
4.15,13.7,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Coppery red and clear appearance with a big foamy orangish head. Sticky and complex lace patterns. Nice aroma, interesting if slightly phenolic, has some qualities like horehound cough drops, ginger, and peppermint. Light mouthfeel, low but persistent carbonation. I have to say I dig the taste of this beer just because it has distinctive qualities. Prickly pine cone, star anise, and spicy molasses flavors mix in to give a restrained perfume-like impression, yeah, even like a disinfected shower room (on warming it even reminds me of "Stove Top" stuffing mix). Works well for me, combining with the easy-going mouthfeel to give a nice drinkability when you're in the mood.","ADR","Aug 01, 2005"

3.63,-0.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Medium- light in body with steady carbonation. If there is historical accuracy to the bottle's claim, this can readily be seen as precusor to many a modern day spiced winter warmers (a la Anchor Our Special Ale).","cokes","Sep 28, 2003"
3.32,-9,3.5,4,3,3.5,3,"Pours a deep ruby with a thin wispy head leaving no lace behind,big orange aroma with a little ginger in there that was really appetizing.Ginger to the hilt flavor wise it gets overpowering after awhile to go along with a menthol quality to make this brew pretty odd in the flavor department and a little much to handle.If you wanna try something different this is it I wont revisit it but glad to give it a try.","oberon","Jul 18, 2003"
2.7,-26,2.5,2.5,3,2.5,2.5,"Good enough as a spiced ale, sure as hell not a Belgian pale ale.","TerryW","Mar 31, 2003"
2.86,-21.6,3.5,2.5,3,2.5,3,"First of all as a lover of Belgian ales I would have to say that this is definitly NOT a Belgian pale ale. What it is perhaps best described as is simply a Spiced Ale. It is not an outstanding beer, but, it is one well worth trying. The beer pours nicely but is let down by the fact that the ginger aroma is almost all empowering leaving no room for hop or other spice aromas to shine through. The taste is fine, although once again the ginger is perhaps a little dominant. I found the mouthfeel to be a little watery for a beer of such strong flavour. I would recomend drinking this beer alongside some heavily spiced red meats ,perhaps mediteranian style.","ALEBOY","Jan 12, 2003"
1.9,-47.9,2,2,2,2,1.5,"Kind of tasted too much like ginger ale, i couldn't pick up much else, just ginger, a bit of malt and i really couldn't detect much hops. This didn't do much for me. There wasn't much happening aside from the ginger flavour, quite unpleasant and quite hard to drink in the end. NOt impressed!!!!!!","rastaman","Beers"
