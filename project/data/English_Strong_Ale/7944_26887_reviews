"Pours a straw golden yellow with a little bit of a red hue. The smell had a bit of the alcohol in it but also had some dark fruits and apple scents to it as well. The taste was semi-sweet with almost no alcohol burn till the finish and even then it paired well enough with the other flavors."

"O: Interesting strong ale. Very malty – not my favorite brew buy worth a try."

"Seriously Bad indeed."

"An okay but rather blah strong ale. The alcohol presence comes across as the most distinctive characteristic which, for my preferences, I'd rather go with a bourbon. A more malt-like profile with a more distinctive yeast character would go a long way in improving this beer. Not bad per se, and drinkable, but hardly memorable."

"O: This is a nice beer to sip but this is something that needs to be done slowly because it’s rather strong and there are some notes of alcohol in the taste."

"Mouthfeel is very smooth and almost slick, with a watery feel, no carbonation and a medium body. Goes down easy considering the heat and ABV, this is a nice winter warmer. Perfect for washing down the Christmas feast with a little bit of British humor."
"O- This beer wasn't bad for a strong ale. It was a little bit too much on the sweet side and a little bit too syrupy however at least these characteristics hid the alcohol fairly well. Overall not bad, would have again but probably wouldn't purchase again."

"O- Not a really, really bad beer but not even close to be good. It has a bit of a nice warming feel and has some flavour range, but it's a mess, and it's not that much drinkable either"
"Drinkability: It is okay. Not seriously good but not seriously bad. Seriously, though, I doubt I will ever buy it again."
"O -- Someone think light colored beers can't be strong and characterful? Hand 'em one'a these! A smooth, cold weather sipper. The strong alcohol is present, but it doesn't hit you over the head to let you know it's there. This is a perfect sipper for a cold winter's evening."

"Pours a medium gold color w/ a one finger white head. The head quickly disappears. Not much lacing on my snifter glass. This beer is fairly clear in appearance- you can see right through it. The nose has grain, malt, apple, and a slight honey smell as well. Improves as it warms, but not much more than average here. Wow- The taste is completely different than the nose. Big malt and honey take over here- a little better than the nose. I don't really get any of the 9% ABV in the taste at all. Feel is light, syrupy, and carbonated w/ a hops bite on the aftertaste. Overall, this is a style I haven't had before- and I'm glad I got to try one. I probably won't buy this again though. Cheers."
"I got this beer for a good price and have never had a british beer with 9% abv, so I figured I'd give it a try. The pour is pretty standard with more of a soapy head that dissipates. It is a golden beer. The smell is faint honey and grain, not bad. The taste is subtle grain, malt, medicinal and more honey. I am actually surprised I don't taste much alcohol in this beer. Pretty good, I would just prefer a bit more esters to spice up the flavors a bit. Worth a try if you like british and belgium beer."
"D - to me, this is a lot like drinking a very alcoholic ale version of most big time industrial lager brews. before you put it up to your nose to smell it, the lingering odor in the air is of generic ""beer"". this is not a horrible beer, though, and is great as the kickoff to a good session, but other than that and getting knocked onto your ass, that may be all it's good for."
"appearance the same. aroma and taste have softened. no longer boozy. improved, but still not a good beer."
" Body is somewhat creamy, not bubbly, but still a bit thinner than is usually expected from a high-alcohol beer. The sweetness is a bit overwhelming, but does help mask the alcohol content. I am kind of glad that I split the bottle with my wife, but it's not exactly a chore to drink. Maybe not the most festive holiday ale, though."
"D: a very nice strong ale. Happy Christmas!"
"With a lot of flavors borrowed from both a English Pale Ale and an English Barlwyine with with more flavor and feel than the Pale but with less syrupiness than Barleywines. The beer does a good job of straddling the fence."
"Nothing to remember."
"Medium light bodied in the mouth. Slight lemony flavor, no hops, hint of spice, and an overpowering alcohol aftertaste. They definetly got the ""strong"" part of the ale."
"D- High ABV but not as bold as I like. It's okay for the one or two and the novelty, but that's about it"
"D: good brew, probably low drinkability in my opinion due to sweetness alone, abv second."
"Drinkability: The relatively okay-ness of Very Bad Elf had inspired me to give the rest of these goofy beers a 'go', but after the seriously poor showing of Seriously Bad Elf, this may be it for me and Ridgeway's Christmastime line-up."
"Mouthfeel is a medium-light and could be boosted a little more to be fuller."
"Decent beer. Drinkable."
"curious about the other elves"
"I also bought the insanely bad elf. After this tasting I am getting a little nervous."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and full, a bit of active carbonation keeping things interesting."
"I poured from a 22 ounce bottle into a standard pint glass. It pours a pale, clear amber with a moderate white head, minimal lacing. The aroma is all alcohol, rubbing alcohol. The flavor reminds me of a strong barley wine. The main flavor is alcohol, but it is not overpowering. The brew is a medium bodied sipper. This elf could use a bit more malt, but it is not a bad beer."
"D- This beer has some full flavor but they all taste a bit off and clash together. There are no real malt flavors and it is a bit of a mess. Maybe time could help pull things together but I don't know if there are other flavors underneath that would come through."
"Not a huge body; medium viscosity and easy to drink. This is a fine beer. I'm not familiar with the style but this ones leans toward a Belgian style to me, strong pale ale or something."
"This poured a clear gold with white head. It smelled very faintly of caramel malt and sweet yeast. It tasted stronger, like sweet caramel and cultured yeast and banana, with a bit of lemon hops. It was slightly thick with no carbonation, and had a creamy aftertaste. Overall this had a fairly unique and clean flavor, but still wasn't as bold as I hoped. It had good body, and it definitely hid the alcohol well. So it was easy to drink, and was somewhat enjoyable, but was generally underwhelming."
"Not ""seriously bad", but ""seriously not good", I would say. No real reason to drink unless you want to drink for the elf-theme, or you want a carmelized boozy drink. This elf needs help. Nice appearance, though."
"Number three of the four-pack for X-mas. Spicy, malty, fruity taste with almost no head on the pour. The taste of alcohol is pretty easy to identify though it's not overpowering to the point of uneasy drinking. Smell is nice while the taste is not to my liking."
"It has a nice copper brass like color. It has a so-so head but good lace. The aroma reminds me of a Scotch or Irish whiskey. There is a processed malt aroma with just a bit of crisp hops. The flavor reminds me of a whiskey as well. It is malty and sweet with some alcohol to the flavor. There is not much for bitterness at all. This beer has some fruity esters to the aftertaste. It feels almost medium bodied but not quite and has some warmth put off from the alcohol."
"I love the elf wearing a lumberjack shirt firing a christmas ball with his slingshot."
"This bad elf is a cotton-headed ninnymoggins.But I would I pass through the seven levels of the Candy Cane forest, through the sea of swirly twirly gum drops, and then I walk through the Lincoln Tunnel for some of this beer."
"Biggest problem with this beer is that the alcohol is too prominent in both aroma and taste. It's also a bit overspiced, in my opinion, but not terribly so. Not a bad brew, but if the booze were toned down a bit it'd be much better."
"Drinkability: Well it knocks out a style at least. Can't say I was very impressed with this one - a little chemically in places, alcoholy in others, and just decent in the rest. My first Ridgeway beer, but I'd gladly give up this Shelton Brothers import in exchange for getting any of their others here in Virginia."
"Drinkability: A good beer that I could drink a couple pints of. However, after the second one it would be difficult to stomach the overall sweetness of this beer. Not to mention it might become difficult to walk after 32+ ounces of 9% beer."
"D - This is a very sweet brew. It was a little difficult to drink because of the sweetness."
"Looks Great. Bottle poured into imperial pint glass deep golden orange clear nice big head tight. Smell fruit and booze - taste fruitybrandy malt booze dry. Mouthfeel okay medium body not an over abundance of carb. Drinkablitly - one is okay for me - pretty boozey - can't imagine having more than one or two."
"Drinkability: Pretty drinkable for the ABV, just boring if you ask me"
"Despite the strength, this beer is extremely well balanced and drinkable with just enough character to keep things interesting."
"D: average. A beer by description that sounds complex, though drinks rather mundanely."
"Pours a nice golden color, although not very deep, with some good initial head and some near lacing. Excellent scent, deep and malty with butterscotch overtones. Nice deep flavor, too, very complex, hints of butterscotch, caramel, a little spiciness, and a lot of deep earthy malt. A bit rough from alcohol, but not bad for such a high ABV."
"Interesting beer but not worth seeking out. Nice series and labeling though."
"Pours a nice clear/clean golden yellow/orange color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy white head, with some nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, sweet, with some light spice. The taste is sweet, malty, with some spice. Medium body. Drinkable, not a bad beer at all. Recommend."
"D: An intriguing brew... certainly has a 'winter' feel to it. After a while, it becomes a bit on the big side - almost to the point of being a bit of a burden to work through, so perhaps only one at a time."
"The drinkability is just average. There are many better choices out there for the price of this brew to recommend it. MK"
"D : I really liked it. It was a very easy beer to finish and I wouldn't mind having it again."
"Overall, not bad, and definitely a different take on what I was used to. This style actually intrigues me, and if it were a little sweeter, I think it would have turned out much better for me overall. But still I cannot say it was bad at all, pretty cool actually and would be a good call for sure."
"Finished thin and watery. No sign of any alcohol warmth here. Extremely disappointing and gimmicky."
"drinkability - I drank about half of it, for some reason it gave me a headache and I couldn't drink anymore. It didn't seem strong to me either. Was alright, I only bought it because it was on sale, like 40% off."
"Slick and syrupy mouthfeel. Low drinkability, I predict that half the bottle will find the sink."
"Pours a clear, diluted cider color with a thick frothy head that drops rapildy. Aroma is sweet apple with alcohol notes. Taste is sweet alcohol. I don't detect much in the way of spices or much else. Syrupy sweet mouth feel. Not one I'd go back for."
"A very drinkable beer and a fine english ale; I would not have guessed it would have been 9%. However, at $8.50, I wont be purchasing this on again."
"wont search this one out again but glad i gave it a go."
"D- intriguing aroma and interesting flavor, though it doesn't interest me enough to come back or recommend this to anyone, overall not enjoyable for me"
"Taste is a very well balanced hop countered with the coriander and winter spice with some apple pie tossed in the mix. Another fine brew, give it a try whenever possible  esp when they toss it in the $3 closeout bin, har!"
"·	Drinkability: Just ok, this one threw me off a bit. I was expecting something different after the pour and smell than what was delivered. Not bad, but I wont be going out of my way for it."
"Creamy, off-white head. Ligh clear color. Aroma was just plain sweet - very, very sweet. Maybe a hint of lemon and apple. As with the aroma, the taste was quite sweet. It tasted better as it warmed up. At 9% can really taste the alcohol. There were a couple of other ""elf's"" at Bullock's, but I won't buy any more."
"Green apple may be a turn-off to some with beer but I actually found this to be quite interesting. Not an everyday-drinker but one to have when the whim hits."
"Drinkability: Just not very beckoning"
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 50 degrees. The beer was a golden yellow color. The taste was rather sweet and several people tooka taste of it and did not care for this beer. It was high alcohol and was just not very tasty to all that sampled. I will not buy again."
"Pours a pale gold, brilliantly clear, with a good size, persistent head that leaves lace all the way down. Aroma is sharp, alcoholic, fruity/estery, and with a hint of hops. Bit too sharp, really. There is also some green apple in the aroma (acetylaldehyde). Flavor is alcoholic upfront, but with some nice malt, along with crystal, and some hops. Tail is rather harsh, with more green apple. Acetylaldehyde contributes to a dry, astringent mouthfeel. The lower alcohol beers in the series are better. Perhaps this one shows the limit of the yeast they are using, at least at the temperature they ferment."
"Pours a nice clear amber with a thick, white, fairly persistent head. Aroma is strong and malty, with whispers of fruit. Maltiness dominates the flavor, which has apple undertones - rather like a cider - and a strong alcohol bite. Mouth-feel is smooth but edgy; aftertaste is fruity and alcohol-ish with just a little bitterness."
"This English Strong Ale pours a medium orange color from a 50cl bottle. Medium sized white foamy head. Aroma is caramel and sweet with a touch of hops. A medium bodied English Strong Ale. The malts are caramel, fruity and sweet. The hops are slightly earthy and floral. A weird tasting beer, there is a lot of orange peel and spices, but there are also a bunch of stuff that tastes like vegetables, grain and something that might be better left unidentified. Whats even more distressing is the bad flavors intensify as it warms. Again one cant help but wonder if Hepworth spent as time in designing the beer as the label design and marketing the name, if they would have a better product. I still buy them -once- and am usually disappointed, but I still buy them. Yet again another ho hum, bah humbug beer. Ah well one more to go. The beer is a little watery and a touch thin as well as that weird taste. Mouthfeel is thin. Finish is crisp and clean. Aftertaste is slightly sweet and a touch vegetative."
"Pours a yellow-ish copper color with a white head. In the aroma, a sweet gingerbread and a hoppy presence. In the taste, a sweet maltiness and a very nice hop presence. A mellow bitterness in the mouthfeel, and a dry medium hop aftertaste. A nice hop presence and a bit sweet alcohol overall. Not to shabby."
"This is interesting but too extreme on the upfront sweetness."
"This beer is bad elf all over again. pours a slight bit darker with less head. nose is the same ridgeway funkiness. Tastes just like bad elf loaded with liquor. First taste is funky maltiness. almost a rotten hop or citrus flavor to it. The finish is dominated by alcohol. the mouthfeel is good and creamy, but still odd. Drinkability is not there for me at all."
"This was a fine winter ale. It has a typically high alcohol content as many winter brews, however, it was extremely drinkable. Reminiscent of an IPA, yet without as much of a bitter edge. The after-taste was pleasant and non-offensive. The color was a true amber (not yellow, not exactly orange) and with no cloudiness. I enjoyed this bottle very much. I have bought a few more of these, even though the price tag for the 21 oz. bottle was a bit spendy. The more I had it though, the magic seemed to fizzle. It was worth the time and effort but I have re-evaluated my assessment after trying additional fine English ales since."
"Poured a medium dark amber with some foam and also a little lace on the side of the glass. The smell of spices and a hint of vanilla, was a surprise being that this is a English Strong Ale. The flavor of spices was a little weak, not like the aroma. Little bitterness and sweetness had a decent balance, but, a very short finnish. Not what I was expecting from the ale!"
"Pours a clear golden straw color with a large soapy white head (after a rather hard pour) that left some nice lacing on the glass. The smell is faint, I pick up some sweet caramel malt and perhaps some alcohol. The taste starts off sweet and boozy and has a cherry cough drop characteristic. Has a slight hop bitterness in the end. The feel is light and almost watery, fizzy carbonation, and finishes slick, sticky, and boozy. This beer is what I imagine English malt liquor would taste like. The malt presence is not big enough to handle the strong ABV of this brew and the sweetness is almost cloying. Not something that I would seek out again."
"D = I could drink this over and over again if it weren't so pricey and I could drink it all night if it weren't so strong. The only reason I marked this lower in drinkability than the other factors was becasue of its strength. Otherwise I think it is just an outstanding beer."
"I haven't had many ""English Strong Ales", but this is not what what I was expecting nor did I really enjoy it ... just toooo sweet. I am glad I am finally getting a chance to try the Ridgeway Xmas brews, but hopefully this isn't the benchmark. I will buy it again, just not this year or probably the next; I really think if Ridgeway latched on to just one style, this brew could be probably pretty good."
"-Oelergud"
"Not a bad Pale Ale. The label says it's an English Double Ale, which I guess can also be called an English Strong Ale. Recommended."
"I approached this beer with an open mind, considering that many BA reviewers pretty much panned this beer. I now know why. The beer pours a very clear light amber with a frothy white head that does lace quite well. The smell is spicy, malty candyish, and okay. The taste goes downhill from there. There is a spicy tartness, a cloying sweetness to this beer, and this god awful candy taste from the malts. There is plenty of carbonation, and the consistency is largely medium bodied. The beer doesn't hide the alcohol well, although the aftertaste is light for a beer with 9 ABV. This beer is a supreme disappointment considering the other Ridgeway beers have been quite good. I will refrain from the discussion about what style this beer properly belongs to, its a beer not worth revisiting regardless of its designation."
"Upon its pour from the 500ml bottle it appears a golden amber color with an average white creamy head that disappears rather quickly leaving a patchy bit of lace. Nose is malt dominated with a fair bit of spice, also hints of alcohol, crisp and clean. Start has a light to moderate grain presence, slightly sweet with a hint of bitterness; the top is moderate to light in feel. Finish crisply acidic, the hops adequate in their spiciness, the alcohol pokes through along with the dry aftertaste, Strong Ale or English Double Ale, seems more like a malty macro lager?"
"It's past time for this experiment in increasingly big beer and increasingly nasty elves to end. Bad Elf and Very Bad Elf were pretty good. After that... fuggediboutit. Unless you need to sterilize a laceration and then numb yourself afterward, stay away from Seriously Bad Elf. Seriously."
"This beer pours a traditional amber color with little to no head. The smell is malty with a hint of spice, very nice. The taste takes shape as the beer is about 3/4ths of the way down, and takes on a sourness with a taste of yeast. The malt never really has time to develop on the tongue as it is quickly whisked away by the carbonation. The lingering taste is like a pleasant cider and lasts for a long time. I don't know if this beer is worthy of the name ""seriously bad", but its definitely a decent beer."
"This beer sort of reminds me of a mild barleywine or a spiced cider."
"The 500 ml. bottle of Seriously Bad Elf poured out quite similar looking to the Very Bad Elf I tied yesterday. About the same orange amber color, but carbonation was more active in this one. The smell of this beer let me know that this was a different animal altogether. The aroma was significantly stronger here as a result of more hop presence and more alcohol. The taste was closer to the other beer than the aroma indicated, but it was less sour, and more bitter, which made it taste a touch better. The metallic tinge however was still very jarring on the taste buds. I also did not find this to be as rich and soothing in texture as the weaker sibling. Better overall beer, but not worth purposefully seeking out at full price no matter how bad the elves get."
"16.9 oz bottle, chilled in the freezer for 5 minutes, poured into a english pint glass. Pours a hazy golden liquid with a one finger thick head that leaves a good ring around the glass. Heavy malt smells with a great undertone of dark fruits, maybe blackberry or blueberry. Slight hop aromas rise from the thick fluid. Tastes of sweet malts with an alcohol backbone, sour fruit flavors hit the tongue chased by a weak hop bitterness. Thick, smooth, but not syrupy fluid, but perhaps with too much carbonation. Tasty drink, good job covering the big alcohol without making it syrupy. For a beer that I saw and thought was a joke, these elfs certainly are worth a revisit"
"Cheers!"
"Too much going on for me with this one. Quite a bit lighter than i had anticipated. Seriously... poured."
"Pours a one finger off-white head that fades to a thin layer leaving traces of lace. Cloudy amber color. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Chocolate/toffee nose. Flavor sweet and sour hints of toffee, high ABV is not noticeable. $5.49 for a 500ml bottle from John's Grocery Iowa City, IA."
"Nothing wrong with this one, unless you're not into wild, spikey, spicy brews. It's definitely not an every day go-to beer, but I found it unique and interesting, and it gives the whole true-to-style thing the finger. Yeah, a seriously bad elf."
"A medium mouthfeel,very creamy the alcohol makes for a bit of roughness on the palate. A good beer overall,if you don't mind the alcohol tastes this is a very good beer. This beer went down very good even with the alcohol taste. I would drink another,but that would be it. A creeping alcohol effect to this beer. I'd recomend this beer if you like em strong,"
"Drinks very easy for the abv, this beer seems to have north american influnces on it, most strong english ales skew much more malty to me. Pretty good one to enjoy a pint or 2, pass that, night, night!!"
"I'm not going to lie - this beer kind of reminds me of heineken. And I don't know what that means considering it's an English Double Ale. It'd be a good heineken though, but that's not a glowing review from me - not a big heineken fan, and I've had heineke on draft in Holland, so I think I gave it an honest try. This Seriously Bad Elf, is actually seriously bad. Granted, it has some nice features... the appearance is pleasant, clean, and crisp and has a nice thick foamy head. The 9% is well-balanced too and there are some other characteristics consistent with the style - but it's missing something. I don't know, maybe my bottle was old, but the head retention and clarity makes me think that that was not the case. I didn't think that this was a very creative product outside of the name."
"An OK to good Strong ale to enjoy, mild, and English toned all the way."
"Drinkability: It's quite nice at first, but not really out of the ordinary. It's very straightforward in its maltiness, and there's not much yeasty fruitiness either - almost like a strong, malty lager. !? It's clean and well-balanced, but not that exciting; and that's where it falters. It's an enjoyable brew for the first pint, but with the strength that it carries and the flavor it delivers, I'd probably stop at one."
"definitely not worth the $$$ paid for a single, and not something i would revisit again in the future. at least i got the bottle with that scary elf shooting x-mas decorations at santas sleigh and reindeer. pretty funny."
"Notes: At 9% ABV and a larger-than-average bottle, it provides a good buzz. But the alcohol is too dominant in the taste. After sampling this one and the Very Bad Elf earlier this week, I'm not all that inclined to try the rest of the series."
"I will certainly pass on this beer. Tastes almost exactly like the Very Bad Elf with more alcohol. This one seems less balanced and more flawed. Surprisingly, the alcohol is pretty well hidden but the overall taste isnt good and lends a low drinkabilty in my opinion. Perhaps I am in the wrong mood but this one really missed."
"is 9%."
"Ive been drinking a lot of this Ridgeway beers lately and you can really see how very similar they are. Each , the bad elf, seriously bad, criminally bad, etc beer just brings up the alcohol and malt a bit, but for the most part they all taste about the same. Labels are nice looking, but the beer is average."
"A 50cl bottle, poured an orange color with a small head. It had a sweet, fruity aroma, as well as something vaguely caramel. A fruity, apple taste. Noticeable alcohol, which I thought was a bit intrusive. Some hops. Tart in the mouth. An OK beer, not one I'd want regularly."
"A mild flavored English Ale most notable for its toasted malt character and unmasked alcohol presence. A Strong Ale that I'll only remember for its 9% abv."
"Pours a clear amber body with a small offwhite head. Soapsuds type lacing. Aroma is fruity apricot with spicy and floral hops in an English manner. Mouthfeel is medium with moderate carbonation. Alcohol is concealed fairly well. Taste has some fruity peach notes competing with an unpleasant metalic note and a dry floral hoppiness. A hint of cardboard is distracting. The 9% abv stays hidden all the way through, and that may be the major plus with this one. Not really a bad effort. Puts me in mind of an ESB on steroids."
"The taste is almost cider-like, very alcoholic, with a noticeable English hop presence. However, the taste is far too thin and gives way to overpowering fusel alcohols. The alcohol stands out too much and doesn't blend into any other flavors. Pretty blah."
"Tangy sour mouthfeel with a medium body. Definitely worth a try if your adventurous"
"On-tap at the Blind Tiger, Very Special Keg Night. And indeed it was. This was an interesting dude, not the most tasty ever, but then, it IS a bad elf. Alcohol is exceptionally sneaky. Got some red wine flavor, some sweet fruits, a hint of sourness. Light and goes down easy and creamily, though a bit watery. Not my favorite, but I'm glad to have had it. And probably will again."
"Seriously Bad Elf is a serious strong ale! It has all of that good english malt flavor, a little bit of yeasty aroma, and a solid amount of hops. The beer is copper colored with a white head, and bottle conditioned. This beer falls somewhere between a barleywine and an imperial IPA-- right on spot with what I would consider a Strong Ale. The 9% is definitely a creeper. I would have guessed it closer to 7.5% if you blindfolded me."
"16.9 ounce bottle."
"The beer has a certain heft to it as it rests in my mouth, but is certainly not heavy. It is a bit viscous, though not overly sweet. It is quite fruity as well; a mix between green grapes, raisins, a bit of plum and a finish that, in combination with the alcohol, reminds me a bit of rum. There is a bit of hoppiness here, though not much; a bit of herbal hop character with a hint of mint and a light bitterness in the finish. In the end the beer seems a bit thin in the finish, the meat of flavors of this beer disappears way to quickly and all that is left is some flabby malt and a bit of alcohol, which lingers on in the finish."
"Mouthfeel- Felt a very subdued yet very textural malt on the palate. The alcohol aded a very warming sensation to the overall enjoyment of the beer."
"Taste was so-so. I could not quite call this an English strong - seemed a bit hoppy for the style. Seems to straddle the line between English strong and Imperial IPA. Mouthfeel was fairly good, round and warming. The finish was unmemorable. I would not buy another bottle of this. I've had the Bad Elf and the Very Bad Elf and like them both more, with I think the Very Bad Elf being my favorite of the three."
"Drinkability is good enjoying this one as I sip it. This is my third Ridgeway Holiday brew this season and by far the best, the other two were dissappointments after the good one I had last year. Enjoyed this one was worried again after seeing the score but going against the grain on this one its gooood."
"Despite the high abv this goes down pretty smoothly until room temperatures warm it up a bit too much. At that point the alcohol creeps into the forefront . It's tough to say which between the two, Very Bad Elf or Seriously Bad Elf I liked better. Both are pretty potent and easily enjoyable on a cold winter's night."
"500 ml bottle poured into a nonic. Pours a slightly hazy copper with a finger of off-white head that vanishes fast, some slight lacing on the glass. Nose is a weird off-putting sourness, rather strong, at second whiff there is some bready malt for a sort of sourdough effect, but must too sour. Taste is better, a light butterscotch malt, some slight citrus and green apple, but the sourness still rears it's head, not nearly as offputting as the smell, but still enough to detract from the taste. Slightly bitter grassy hop finish with a hint of the alcohol. Mouthfeel is medium with a low carbonation level. This is an all around stinker--tasted better when I held my nose, but that's not the way beer is to be drunk. I could only finish half the bottle before I poured this. Something's seriously wrong with this beer--I checked other reviews to see if I may have received a mishandled bottle, but I'm not alone--I won't be duped into buying this again just based on the amusing bottle."
"Music: Tomaso Albinoni  Adagio in G minor."
"Pours a coppery brown with a thin head. The beer has some odd aromas of funky hops and muddled spice. I can't discern the smells, but they are neither pleasant, nor offensive. the beer is without any defining flavors, odd for a winter strong ale. No heavy bready british malt flavor, no estery appley yeast flavors and no strong hop profile. It is almost like a muddy brew that just goes down the hatch. Not an offensive brew, but not one to crow about."
"I could be wrong on those, though."
"A good holiday/Christmas beer, but not one I would drink too often. The best of the bunch I have had by this brewery so far, but that is not saying a lot."
"drinkability, is very nice, a very potent sipping beer, perfect for the cold day's of winter, I will revisit this one."
"ON cask at the Blind Tiger Ale House (NYC). Nice size head for a cask pour. Hazy orange body. Biscuit, malty and fruity nose. Sharp powerful old/strong ale flavor did not disappoint. Might be just a bit too tangy though. A nice beer to have as a change of pace. Not something that I would want to drink regularly."
"Slick mouth that is just below moderate in feel. I'm drinking this one then I'm done with this little troll. I might buy another bottle just to see what a year or two in the cellar would do."
"Poured a nice deep bronze color with a thinner white head,big sour green apple in the aromas really hit the nose with a band also picked up some underlying caramel as well.Flavors start out with that green apple elemant up front but gets caramelly sweet with brown suger as late to the point that after awhile it got somewhat cloying.Nice flavors dont get me wrong a good sipper and after meal beer to savor but it is quite sweet,the alcohol is nicely hidden for 9% alc as well."
"Deep smoky pine and cedar aromas emerge from the red liquid. This is booze. It posesses a sweet jawbreaker candy and dried red fruit jam aroma alongside pepper, nuts and cream. Very clean and bittersweet in the mouth. The tannins are ripe and supple. An absence of dirty earthy traits. Balanced with viscous, creamy texture that controls clean bitterness, taught, candied fruit and modest buttery richness. This is something of a bargain considering volume, price and quality at little over $5 for a pint."
"on tap at the Blind tiger in the neighborhood of my childhood in lower NYC, I'm gonna miss this place, but enough sentimentality...this pours semi cloudy, medium golden with an off white head, not much lacing noticed. Nose here is of hoppy spicy goodness. Tasty, aggresivly hopped British brew, quite dry and flavorful up front , then more spice and citrus in the middle and finish, cant say this one is balanced, but for a Brit brew this one will please the hop and flavorful brew fans. worth a try, especially if yoiu see it on tap."
"Pretty good, actually."
"Clear dark orange color, big-bubbled head is faintly yellow but doesn't last long. Looping ring laces on the pint glass. Bready aroma, vague off esters and oddly sweet orange marmalade. Low carbonation, mouthfeel is less than medium but oddly slick. Gravelly and warbling flavor tone overall, like sweetened black and green teas alternating hand-in-hand with orange and slight spice. Very leafy noticeable hop bittering. Some sense of alcohol, but not a burning impression. Frankly, this brew doesn't really appeal to me, its got some odd characteristics in combination."
