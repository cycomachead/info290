4.17,6.6,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Smells of an even blend of caramel and toffee malts with a general toasted nuttiness and plenty of dark fruits. The bottle wasn't kidding when the label boasted of a fruit cake aroma. The flavor follows suit mostly, with a touch of balancing herbal / medicinal hopping. A faintly metallic ghostly flavor nuance does appear as the glass warms up, but rather than being a flaw, it surprisingly seems to provide a dab of extra counter-balance to the malt sweetness! It's really good... right up there amongst my other personal favorite English offerings.","WastingFreetime","Oct 13, 2012"
4.09,4.6,4.25,4,4.25,3.75,4,"An approachable, and conquer-worthy old-world strong ale, the subtly of it all clear in the restraint in the main players' getting lost in the timid, though distracting enough off-flavours - to note: mineral and must (which sounds like an old Judas Priest song...). Still rather good though, and duly representative of the style, one, like its kin, having lost its place to the more effusive American take on things, sadly, I suppose.","biboergosum","Oct 12, 2012"

Drinkable, and something I wouldn't mind drinking a bunch of at a pub.","jlindros","Jun 28, 2012"
4.92,25.8,4.5,5,5,4.5,5,"Taste is similar, extremely rich and complex, engaging and lively. It has rich spicy-sweet caramelized dark breads, rum-soaked dried cherries and caramelised jam, a hint of plum pudding, strong earthy-toasty finish and earthy-spicy bitterness. It has amazing richness of character whilst remaining light and engaging. It is somewhat similar to another favourite of mine, Fuller’s 1845.","Offa","Jun 15, 2012"

Smell is very malty along with some caramel and slightly fruity aromas. Taste is of sweet malt and some burnt caramel flavors. There is a medium amount of bitterness on the palate with each sip.

You'll see… filtered and hazey. Usually, expired beer doesn’t smell this good. There's gotta be a catch! Strawberry tartness and chocolate vanilla. Some esters of banana cream pie. Light but for an english ale, wow! There's the catch! The metal aftertaste of an expired brew. I really want to try this new and fresh or on draft! Bitter finish ruined by metal. Could be on the over-bitter side. Silky smooth, medium thick body. Warm and sensuous on the tongue. Small tickle of carbonation. Slight sour. Nutty and Sweet. Oh! How dissapoointing, smelled and looked like a clear winner. Still very nice brew, smooth, bitter and aromatic and warm.","iguenard","May 07, 2011"

I was surprised at how pronounced the alcohol was in both the nose and in the taste, considering that it's not much higher than the standard percentage. The sweet, fruit cake character in the nose was the highlight of the beer for me. This one's a good alternative in terms of pricing to Fuller's offering, but in terms of quality, I'd stick with Fuller's.","ludachris","Feb 25, 2010"

Lots of dried fruit in the aroma; scents of raisin, current, prune, and toffee remind me vaguely of fruitcake. Maybe thats just the power of suggestion given by the blurb on the back of the bottle. Regardless, this stuff smells pretty good. It tastes of malt bread and toffee; fruit flavours at first seem more mute than the scent suggests, but come forward more as the beer warms. Earthy, floral finish provides a lingering bitterness in the aftertaste. Medium-bodied with low carbonation. Feels smooth. Flavourful and balanced, I plan on drinking more of these while it's still to be found on LCBO shelves.","mintjellie","Jan 11, 2010"

There's also a small amount of noticeable alcohol. Medium body that is creamy, smooth with a little bit of stickyness. The beer seems to be fuller through the back, pronouncing its big malt back bone after getting a quick blast of buttery, fruity yeast esters and English hop flavor.

Sharp, tangy, sweet, and sour are words that come to mind at first sip. This strong ale (6%) has plenty of character and tastes darker and heavier than it looks . . . if that makes any sense? Flavorful, aromatic malts and hops tug at the tastebuds, vying for your undivided attention. Avery subtle hop bitterness lingers at the end of the palate, inviting sip after glorious sip. Fruity esters abound, thanks in part to Adnams proprietary yeast strain, and notes of citrus joint the melee, struggling for attention. Medium-full bodied, with a touch of creamy smoothness and rather lively carbonation. In some ways this compares favorably with Fuller's 1845, although there's no such yeast deposit (nor is there quite the booze deposit either, but you catch my drift.) Wonderful stuff!

Mellow notes of singed toffee and licorice in aroma, accompanied by earthy hop and trace butterscotch. Just a touch too soft aromawise, but welcoming nonetheless. In flavor, prevalent in malt character is an impression of treacle sweetened burnt biscuit and raisin. After a deliberation, dryish, baker's chocolate melds with butterscotch and dark crystal malt tones to lend a cocoa dusted caramel candy impression. Hop bitterness creeps in, soundly offsetting caramel sweetness and lending overall balance. Undertone of candied fig augments as the beer warms. Mild woody hop flavor complements bitter chocolate notes. Agreeably dextrinous in mouthfeel, but not overly so. Finishes with a surprising surge of hop bitterness that yields to a continution of burnt malt tones. A flavorful, rather complex ale that's seemingly a hybrid of a true ESB and English old ale.

Considering some of the other great bottle-conditioned beers Ive had lately from Fullers, Freeminer, and OHanlons; this isnt quite up to snuff.

3.9,-0.3,4,4,4,3,4,"Mouthfeel is a bit fizzy, and another beer where bottle-conditioning would have a positive impact. Quite drinkable for what it is, and a very nice example of the style. Best before date of February 3, 2005.","Realale","Feb 15, 2004"
4.38,12,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Nicely hopped, bitter finish, asks you to have another taste. Supersmooth and completely drinkable. A very impressive beer in my opinion. Really worth the wait. Purchased at a grocery store near Prestwick, Scotlund and stuffed in the back of my beer fridge for the last 7 months.","StevieW","Feb 09, 2004"

4.55,16.4,4.5,4.5,5,4,4,"i really never notice that its quite strong, even for a traditional english ale, but that is yet another thing about broadside that makes me give it consideration every time im in the mood for a top quality beer from the u.k. i cant wait to head over there next year and get into some of this from the keg!","diablo14","Jan 09, 2004"

4.2,7.4,4,4,4.5,4,4,"WOW! An English Ale in a brown bottle! I'm rating the taste high just because of that. Deep brown with a copper/gold tinge. Head retention was good, but had to be enticed. Nice even balance of maltiness and hops,maybe a bit of oak and also picking up on some fruit. I would have to call this a "flat" beer, in respect to it's equal parts malt and hops acroos the board. Aroma is typical ale but is fresh and inviting. Mouthfeel is good and drinkability is high. Cool bottle too.","dpend","Nov 22, 2003"
4.03,3.1,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Pours with a serious yellow-brown head that stays, leaving thick sheets of lace. High carbonation. Amber/ruby color, strong malty nose. Medium bodied. Rich malty flavor with some hops in the background. The brewer describes this as "A heart-warming English beer" which is exactly what he has brewed.","jdhilt","Aug 26, 2003"
