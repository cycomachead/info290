The alcohol is a little too prevalent perhaps but it's still one of the best English Strongs I've had. Sam Smith continues to impress me with their brews.","Jaysauras","Nov 03, 2014"

Poured a deep ruby brown color with a beige head, it was full bodied, had a nice creaminess and low level of carbonation. Tasting it dark fruits and raisins were upfront for me, there was plum, pomegranate, caramel and a vanilla finish with a hint of oak. I also noticed a subtle tartness that was similar to raspberries for me. This was very much an English barleywine I thought, it didn't have an astounding level of complexity, but what was there was big and flavorful. Very nice beer.","BrewChatKen","Oct 28, 2014"

Because it seems like the distribution is heavy on all Samuel Smith products I am guilty of overlooking this one too many times since then. This is a unique beer, malty, strong alcohol presence with some raisin and toast smells. Definitely in my book it is a strong beer chaser to straight Scotch.

4.62,13,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Poured a rich, cloudy, dark amber with a one finger off-white head that dissipated slowly to an off-white ring leaving little lacing. It looks excellent, yeasty and traditional. Scents of caramel, toffee, sour green apple, rich, dark bread, fruity esters, brown sugar, yeasty aromas and hints of oak. A wonderful, well rounded, rich, complex and alluring aroma. Truly excellent, showcasing the malt forward nature of the beer, the yeast and the oak cask aging. Flavor begins sweet, with caramel, toffee and honey, alongside some mellow notes of apple. Fruity flavors, including apple, but also dark fruit, raisin and prune mostly, appear in the middle and continue into the finish. Also appearing in the middle of the sip is a nice, bready malt flavor. Towards the finish and in the aftertaste there is a bit of oak and some faint wild yeast funk. A rich, complex combination of flavors, hitting all the notes I enjoy in a malty sweet beer. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with a slightly drying, yet also sticky feel and light carbonation. A very easy to drink ale that goes down smooth and quick, hiding its ABV. Overall this is an excellent Strong Ale. It has a rich, complex and truly wonderous aroma and flavor profile combination, aided in drinkability by its mellow carbonation and semi-drying mouthfeel. The barrel aging makes this beer a complex, yet not overwhelming ale. A wonderful beer and well worth the somewhat steep price.","Auraan","Mar 14, 2014"
4.01,-2,3.75,4.5,3.75,4,4,"Poured from the classic Samuel Smith bottle into a tulip glass. A dark orange amber brew, looks like moderately strong English breakfast tea, with around four fingers of resilient beige foam. Aroma is sublime. Sweet, dark, and fruity smells greet the drinker, with raisin/grape/plum, buttertart, toffee, herbal tincture, and sour apple notes all blending together to yield a pretty distinctive nose that is not easily forgotten. Palate is similarly sweet and fruity. I might describe the overall impression as more fruity, herbal, and tea-like than expected, although there is certainly a rich rum cake component that peeks out of the mix ... Evokes marmalade and toast, crabapple, lemon, licorice candy, walnut, and floral Darjeerling tea. Some Goldings hop character apparent. Richly complex but weighted towards the fruit and herb flavors rather than the malts. Not particularly sweet, almost light and fresh, with a decent chewy body (on the thin side for the style?) and a very smooth, low carbonation mouthfeel. Faint alcohol presence although this grows over time. Includes the usual Samuel Smith kiss of diacetyl and some oak wood in the dryish finish. Well done and rather unique in the universe of English style "old ales" and barleywines.","CalgaryFMC","Mar 12, 2014"

Hearty, like a good strong English ale, with a slurpy mouthfeel filled with textured carbonation. Delicious plummy flavors add to the sweeter malt notes which spring up everywhere. Robust, and not candied. Keeps an easier drinkability. The body is merely medium, but it feels a bit fuller than that. Alcohol tries to peak, but the aging has really mellowed that out. This drinks great, and I recommend laying down a bottle or two for a few years for yourself.","thecheapies","Dec 01, 2013"

Caramel candy and malt flavors with notes of buttery dark bread. Floral hops thru the middle followed by ripe fruit flavors toward the end. Yeast and fruit flavors are similar to a begian strong dark ale but not as prominent. Finishes incredibly dry with lingering floral hop and dry and ripe fruit aftertaste.

Smell is of malt, caramel, toffee, and candied fruit aromas. There is also a bit of a sour aroma that becomes more noticeable as the beer warms up. Taste is much the same with a woody flavor and an alcohol kick on the finish. There is a mild amount of woody bitterness on the palate with each sip.

3.98,-2.7,3.75,3.75,4,4.5,4,"Be careful with the pour or you will get half a glass of frothy, loosely knit foam, mostly medium to large bubbles which is sort of unusual for its size, retention is excellent and it simmers down at a slow pace, as a result, though, the lacing is close to nonexistent, first because there’s no space, second because the head is glued together so tightly. The liquid is a cloudy copper red, hard to see any bubbles, captures light well, particularly as it takes on a more orange rust to clay cast near the glass sides. The nose is infused with vanillin oak and toffee, molasses notes, pralines and figs, just short of dates, fruitcake, lightly boozy, not overly roasted and actually comes out on the demure side, not short but compact. In the mouth it’s close to full-bodied and super creamy in texture, rises to coat every pore in your mouth. That noted, not too carbonated and there’s ample opportunity for the vanilla, caramel, caramelized brown sugar and maple syrup to settle in. Not that sweet, indeed, finishes on the dry side. Stays in the range of fig, golden raisin, dried apples with a hint of orange peel. No perceptible alcoholic heat. Tactful without impairing your ability to simply enjoy it.

Pours fairly clear reddish brown color with a 1 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of raisin, prune, toast, toffee, caramel, pear, apple, brown sugar, bread, oak, earth, and light herbal. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity. Taste of raisin, caramel, toast, toffee, pear, apple, molasses, bread, light oak, light clove, pepper, earth, and herbal spiciness. Slight bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark and light fruits, caramel, molasses, toast, toffee, earth, clove, light oak, and herbal spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice malt complexity and balance with the light hop spiciness; with zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy, slick, and slightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is extremely well hidden with hardly any warming noticed at all after the finish. Overall this is an excellent English strong ale. Very nice amount of flavor complexity and balance; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering as expected.","superspak","Jan 08, 2013"

4.85,18.6,4.5,4.5,5,5,5,"I could have sworn this was an old ale. I'm not sure why it's listed as an English Strong ale. It certainly tastes like an old ale and was barrel aged for a year. The primary difference I noticed was that it was the best old ale I had ever tasted. This thing was like a meal in a glass, which was perfect because I was HUNGRY at the time. Each sip was like the next bite into a hamburger. It was quite sweet, with flavours of rotting fruits, but it was also malty and earthy at the same time, but not in a sweet Belgian brew sort of way. It was a tiny bit sour like someone added a few drops of warcestershire sauce into the beer and had an umami flavour to it as well. These are really what distinguished it as tasting meal-like. It could easily vie for the position of the most well-balanced high-alcohol sweet beer that I've ever had. Though Boulevard's dark truth and probably a couple others would still provide stiff competition. This beer definitely exceeded my expectations. I knew it must be good, but it was absolutely astounding. Only 11 oz of it really made my night.","ElCommodoro","Dec 02, 2012"

The young Stingo was a bit scattered IMO but I loved this bottle. The nose is full of hops and malt but you can tell that a British brewer made it rather than the new world hops often found in North American barley wines. The finish is long and very smooth but I never felt a thinness of mouthfeel in this beer.

Aromas of rich, dark toffee, honey sweetness, old world fruits (fig and date foremost), and some earthy overtones. Flavors are bold and forward on a surprisingly thin body. Roasty first and foremost, with a toffee underlay that supports the earthy, old world fruit sweetness. Fig, raisin, and date all impart a subtle blending of rich and sweet that is kept balanced by the clean, thin body. Oaky highlights also add a rustic feel to the palate. Smooth, rich, sweet aftertaste blending all of the fruit and earth characteristics into a nice, balanced bouquet. Smooth, clean finish that is light and only slightly lingering.","GarthDanielson","Oct 02, 2012"

Now having had the opportunty to have had a try, I'll be heading out to the store tomorrow for more, if there's any left. If you like the warmth of alcohol and scotch by all mean try this beer, pricey (at $11.00) but worth it!

The taste of the beer is pretty good, not sour like I expected. There is some semi-sweet caramel flavors with some earthy malts and a light wooden barrel flavor in there too. The mouthfeel has a pretty good body to it, the carbonation isn't too bad. Overall this brew wasn't as good as I thought it was going to be.

It is mellow and complex and wonderfully subtle. Aged strong ales from England are for me some of the most pleasing drinkable liquids on this planet, and this beer is one of the greats. For me it trounces J.W. Lee's because it doesn't sway to far into the syrupy-sweet/headache area (although I respect that as I know many people love it). Thomas Hardy's still holds the gold medal in my book, but this, Fuller's Vintage Ale and Fuller's 1845 are all solid alternatives (which are still produced).","allforbetterbeer","Aug 22, 2011"

4.35,6.4,4,4,5,4.5,3.5,"Most folks, myself included, probably don't know that Stingo is an older word that means old ale or old beer. Seems appropriate for this beer, which is apparently aged for an entire year in Samuel Smith's famous Yorkshire Squares. I'm using a goblet for this one tonight, as a special beer deserves a special glass. Pours a murky and ruddy amber. Carbonation levels are pretty high, as there's a constant stream of bubbles popping up from the bottom of the glass. No real head on this beer, just bubbles on the outer rim of the glass. Aroma is rich, deep, and pungent. You can really pick out the oak, which adds a nice earth characteristic. The first taste is simply incredible. Flavor profile is stunningly complex, with loads of molasses, dark cherry, raisin, oak, and tobacco clamoring for attention on the palate. This beer has the perfect amount of carbonation to keep the mouthfeel balanced, as the heavy flavor profile and malt profile could easily become syrupy if left alone. Happily that's not the case here, though the heavy alcohol warmth makes this a sipping beer. Samuel Smith's has done it again, creating a textbook example of a classic English style - in the case of Yorkshire Stingo, the Old Ale. Highly recommended.","eclaycamp","Dec 11, 2010"

Medium-bodied with carbonation that fades quickly, yet retains well enough to give a trademark English bite to it.

The oak compliments the warm malty flavor and adds a level of complexity in the finish. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is wonderful beer.

The vanilla, oak and spicing are in the background and it finishes with a distinct shot of boozyness. Medium bodied, fully carbonated, semi-dry finish.

Alcohol definitely shows, but not in a bad way really, just noticeable. It finishes with a tannic dryness. Mouthfeel is really great, the carbonation is right on, keeps things light, goes down easy.

The beer pours pumpkin candle orange with a small head that disappears quickly. It smells sweet and oaky, like an old rocking chair at your grandmother's house. There are some nice earth and fruit notes lingering in the aroma as well. It reminds me of a Jolly Pumpkin beer, more in the aroma than the flavor but both have that same pervasiveness, almost overwhelming oak note that I associate with JP's beers (and I say that with nothing but affection for oaky beers, particularly JP's). Of course, Stingo doesn't really seem to have been soured at all. The flavor is still quite dry, but there are hints of caramel malt pushing through. It tastes mostly of fruit and oak. The fruit flavors are citric, cider-y and a bit floral in a fruit-ish way. It's an excellent beer and I'm happy to have found myself a bottle. I may just have to go back and see if I overlooked any other beers from Sam Smith.","popery","Oct 09, 2009"
3.92,-4.2,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Bottle from BevMo. Poured dark mahogany with nice red edges. Puffy, creamy off-white head. Minimal lacing on the dimpled mug. Flattish, sticky mouthfeel that is kind of thin. Malty caramel and some crystal malt, but everything is glossed over with a vanilla-oak flavor. Its very pleasant, but I wanted more hops or something to pop out. In all, it is a very nice beer, but left me kind of disappointed.","magictrokini","Oct 08, 2009"

I was expecting a slow sipper but the flavors aren't as in your face as I was expecting and the feel and carbonation levels really keep it easy drinking. The beer is good, but its not amazing by any stretch. I guess I may have been expecting too much because I love Sammy Smith brews so much. With that said its still a good beer but I wouldn't pay that price again for this thats for certain. Still an enjoyable experience, just not all I built it up to be.","everetends","Sep 29, 2009"

Nutty English malt profile. Vanilla, caramel oak and raisin. Finish with some grass and tea, hint of hops. Drinkability is good, just a hint of warming, but not really. Alcohol non-existent.

4.2,2.7,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Very, very nice to see this offering from Samuel Smith's in the Atlanta area. Really looking forward to this one. Aged in oak casks for over a year. I wonder what sort of casks they used, and if they were new or used previously? A whole year is long enough for some critters to infect the wood and bring a little sourness to the beer, which this has, even in new oak. This has a note of apples in the smell and taste, however and I wonder if a cider or scumpy barrel was used? Or a calvados barrel? This pours a slightly turgid reddish brown with a thin, creamy head that settles to a ring. The beer smells nicely of stored apples, a bit of brandy, and a bit of spice from the oak, and some sweet, rich bready malt on the end. The taste is lean and woody, with more of that apple fruit, dry oak notes, a touch of sherry vinegar, and some very dry crackery malt. Nicely taut in the mouth, this is a very pleasing old ale in my book, of a style not often seen on these shores. Very nice.","Georgiabeer","Sep 20, 2009"

4.05,-1,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Poured a clear leather brown body with a faomy tan head that died slowly and left lace on the glass. A rich malt smell of sweetness and breadiness along with roasted and oak/wood and minor floral hops - english beers always give off that slight "tea" smell to me. Taste is more of the same as this a medium-bodied beer that is real smooth and a little creamy. Has some fruit notes and even something like a fig or raisin taste in there as the yeast and oak complements the beer in both going down and taste. Also has that dry breadiness to it along with some minor sweetness like caramel or molasses. Has a easy dry finish and I had no idea that it was an 8% beer - I will have to have this again next year.","clayrock81","Sep 15, 2009"
3.85,-5.9,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"D - Thick and heavy, this is not an easy beer to drink. It borders on being overly sweet, and the thick malt is almost too much. It is possible to pick out some oak character, but it is not out in front and only serves to mellow and compliment the malt. The dark malt flavors are quite rich and complex, and it is almost like a belgian dubble or quad. Not bad overall, I like the malt complexity, though I probably won't be looking for another bottle of this.","nickfl","Sep 14, 2009"

Highly recommended!","corby112","Sep 11, 2009"
4.15,1.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Taste & mouthfeel: Toffee and a touch of buttery slickness up front, with solvents lending a slight sharpness. Fruity mid palate, fruit cake more specifically, a bit nutty, with just a hint of that tartness I pick up in the nose. There's a touch of diacetyl, but in that pleasant English way; it pops up for a moment and then disappears before the finish. On the fuller side of medium-bodied, rich without even approaching cloying, and very mellow in the finish, with a subtle tartness balancing the lingering caramel. I don't get a lot of wood from this one beyond a hint of tannin, but from the sounds of it, this one is aged in old oak barrels that have lost much of their natural character. Delicious stuff all the same; rich, mellow, and easy to sip on over the course of a couple hours.","largadeer","Sep 11, 2009"

Smells of caramel and stonefruit, Tastes of peaches apricots and vanilla with other lurking flavors like oak and plum and I'm surprised that I'm not getting the stony flavor that I've gotten from those yorkshire squares in some of their other offerings most likely due to the oak barrel aging after the yorkshire squares. Mouthfeel is creamy and warming at the same time.

More of the same in the flavor, with some mild alcohol notes and a bit of sweet molasses. Mouthfeel is perfectly balanced, with the alcohol never seeming hot. A sipper of a beer too, this is one to sit in front of the fire to sip and enjoy. This is a stellar beer from Samuel Smith, and perfectly fits the criteria for what I look for in a strong ale. I highly recommend laying a fwe of these down to age in the cellar. I can imagine a little time would do wonderful things to this beer. Cheers","jamie2dope","Sep 03, 2009"

The smell is sort of like mincemeat without so much of the spicing: savory and sweet, with notes of dried currants and indeed a little nutmeg. There is a definite alcohol presence. The taste is more of the same, with strong hits of maybe juniper added in -- that comes up at the finish with the alcohol burn. It's highly carbonated, a little thick, very full in the mouth. I've been an hour working on this pint: not a sipper, exactly, but slow and pleasant going. A very nice beer.","gory4d","Sep 01, 2009"

The malt profile, like many English styles, are modest in comparison to many American beers... smooth and creamy, but the oak aging has added a big flavour of vanilla and 'damp wood.' There's quite a tartness to it... almost even a bit sour, and quite intense as it breathes. It can become a little cloying and challenging to drink, and is more appropriate to be taken very slowly or shared with good company.","Proteus93","Aug 29, 2009"

The ale appears a crystal clear bright crimson color with about an inch of off white head. Truly awesome looking when help up against a light. Nose and flavor consist of raisins, prunes, dried cherries, treacle, toffee, brown sugar, vanilla, oak, figs, slight alcohol, fruity. Dry with a medium to full body and rather light carbonation. Excellent stuff and quite easy to drink. All strong ale fans need to seek this one out.","ClockworkOrange","Aug 28, 2009"
4.15,1.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Pours a light cherry red with a large and furious pure tan head which begins to fade quickly, then about halfway down stops, and slowly disintigrates before settling into a thick covering. Some small jagged lines of lace are scattered to and fro. Big sweet malts and spice hit the nose up front as some dark, sweet and sour fruits and some booziness float around in the back. Tastes of spice, big sweet malts, vinegar, brown sugar and sour grapes. A lingering, but not at all bothersome alcohol heat sticks to the tongue and the back of the throat. It's medium bodied, yet goes down fluidly, with a little airiness involved. Our British droogs should be way proud of this one.","stephens101","Aug 27, 2009"

Starts off with an oaken malty spiciness that progresses to some nice flavoring hops, then some slightly roasted and nutty characters before finishing with an alcoholic warmth and lingering floral bitterness reminiscent of a lambic. Mouthfeel is smooth and slightly effervescent, almost like a bubbly cognac. This beer is extremely drinkable and balanced. It's a great example of what an old ale can strive to be; there's a fine balance between an old ale, english barleywine, and flander's ale.

Importantly, through the ageing process, the alcoholic content has been totally tamed - what ends up in the glass is a truly mellow malt wine for my palate, benefiting a lot from the creamy carbonation, too. This "Old Barley Wine" has some really lovely finesse that requires patience to unwrap and fresh palate to appreciate. Just give it a try!
