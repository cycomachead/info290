"Nothing special but a good ale"
""
""
"Poured from Geary's bottle into a pint glass. Pours dark Amber with a slight redness it seems up to the light. Half finger of white head and more than average lacing long after. The nose is of heavy malt, bread, syrup, and strawberry or raspberry I can't quite tell. The taste is nothing of memorable quality, strong alcohol taste (almost rubbing alcohol), malt, and burnt syrup. The mouthfeel is thin and definitely minimal carbonation. Overall nothing great and nothing I would get again"

"This is a great session beer but at 7% ABV, it needs to be respected! This has been my go to for 15+ years. Very well balanced.... ""Special"" indeed"

"Overall: This seems to me a well executed beer, but it's a little harsh in a way that isn't as appealing as truly great ""big"" beers are harsh. It might just not be my kind of style. I lean towards imperial stouts and IPAs when I want to go big. Fans of ESAs might dig this."

"An enjoyable beer that seems to add the right amount of American hops to what I would assume would be a solid ESB or English-style IPA, styles that I can appreciate but rarely wow me."
""
"Pours a rich amber with no head at all. Aroma is of bread and caramel with a light hint of fruit. Medium bodied on the tongue it's very upfront with the caramel sweetness of the malt but finished with a nice hop bite. The alcohol dies linger for a while but is very satisfying."

"O - Very English and very Portland. No matter how many newer more inventive breweries pop up in this state, the old school open fermented ""Yorkshire"" inspired ales with ringwood yeast in my opinion are sort of the foundation of Maine brewing, and Gear's HSA to me is some sort of the Pièce de résistance. A decadent deluge of English inspired flavor done in the old world style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Crisp with a surprising heft on the front of the tongue, this beer is nevertheless barely medium-bodied but well within range and with a nice smoothness along with the good, clean, crisp bite."

"O: Normally, I'm not a fan of this style, but these guys damn near nailed this. It's super clean, drinkable, yet nicely complex and savorable. I would definitely buy this again - this is one of those 'hidden gems' that few people know about but is actually really damn good."
""
""
"The taste has an upfront roasted malt and caramel sweetness and a wonderfully lingering dry finish. Only 7% yeah, but some Strong Ales still have a boozy feel but not this one. Geary's has hit the mark on the style. It really feels like I'm drinking it at a British pub rather than at m y computer in New Hampshire USA."
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability: Easy. Light and mind blowing complex. I'd be surprised to see how many of these I could have in an evening before the weight (flavorwise, not ABV-wise) got to me. I guess I could have 2 or 3. But, damn. Try it for yourself. It's something which hasn't ever not been not nothing."

"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a ruby-highlighted caramel coloring with a thin, filmy, white head. Nose of apricot and mango fruit sweetness and a caramel backbone. Tangy aromas, overall. Flavors of roast initially, with a biscuit backbone, honey and fruit sweetness, and a spicy blend overlay. Light bodied, with a roasty and tangy sweet aftertaste. CLean, slightly sharp finish. Surprisingly easy to drink despite a slightly elevated ABV and heavy flavor profile."

"Pours a relatively dark amber with a light beige head. The head sticks around for a medium length of time. Little lacing. The aroma is rich with deep caramel malt flavor. It's doughy and sweet. Toffee, shortbread, raisins, prunes, dates, syrup. It's a rich muddling of toasted malt sugar. There's some booze in the aroma and a bit more in the taste, but once the beer hits the proper temperature, it contributes more warmth than harshness. The taste is otherwise quite sweet, but the hops are more apparent than in the aroma and, besides providing some respite from the caramel, adds in a mineral/grassy note. The mouthfeel is full and thick for a 7% abv beer. This is an interesting beer. Before it had a chance to warm up, the booze seemed to come out in excess. At cellar to room temp, the sweetness shined and the booze blended into the beer. Good stuff."

"O: A mega drinkable beer that could possibly use a touch more carbonation to pitch the strength, but has all the balls of a strong ale with the balance of a female mental structure. But if that doesn't make total sense then lets just say, it goes off with a bang but cuddles your taste buds into a sweet finish."
"Overall; a unique and enjoyable beer. Quite old-school and not something I drink on a normal basis but I dig it."
""

""

"Popped one of these open tonight, and poured it into a pint glass. It has a beautiful reddish-brown hue, with a light fizzy head that disappeared almost immediately. Wonderful malty aroma, and plenty of malt taste, but with a decisive bitter finish. Good solid beer, but a little flat. Geary's beer always reminds me of when beer was beer, if you know what I mean. A strong old school foundation. This is a good beer, but not really my style."
""
"Kind of a malt bomb but the bitter finish helps to balance. Enjoyed it more the second time."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Nicely balanced and drinkable for the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is an above average beer that is very drinkable. I would definitely buy it again were it available in my area."
""
"D - Actually not bad. I didn't expect much after finding this one in a local bottle shop that I rarely visit, but it turned out to be a decent example of the style. The malt character is quite nice and if finishes with balanced bitterness that makes it quite drinkable."

"O: This beer is rather easy to drink for the style and hides its alcohol well, although it’s complex enough to enjoy sipped slowly."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I definitely enjoyed this one. The esters were nicely balanced with the grain flavors. The bitterness in the middle is a bit acrid, but other than that this is a tasty ESA."
""
"o - a solid beer and seems to fit the style well. very drinkable too. it's no fuller's, but i'd buy it again if i came across it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"For lack of other options in the particular environment, I drank quite a few of these and they grew on me. Probably not a trade bait type beer, but certainly a moderately complex and very well balanced one. Despite being decent sized at 7%, it drinks whacked easy. I like that there is some significant malt quality to it, and more hops than a lot of IPA's. I'll have it again."
"I have a lot of English Strong Ales in my fridge right now, especially compared to the style's availability in the US. Let's start with the one American version I have. Pours an attractive red-amber color with a finger of head. The aroma is rather sweet, with caramel and butterscotch malts, along with some floral hops. The taste has that sweet toffee malt kinda thing going along, with a substantial floral English hop presence. Aftertaste is fairly non-existant, which is the biggest knock I have against this beer. The mouthfeel is heavier bodied for an English ale, and is very lightly carbonated. Overall, a nice strong ale. Bring the rest of them on!"
""
"O. Pretty solid. I wouldn't seek it out religiously, but would buy it if I found it. Wouldnt drink too many at once, either... this heavyweight packs a punch."
"M - Buttery Smooth, light carbonation, very drinkable."
""
"D - Solid. Was expecting it to taste a little bigger and complex but not disappointed."
""
"Overall, this brew lived up to it's high rating in the ESA category, and will be climbing after my review. Loved this brew and it is right up there on my favortites in the style list w/ Thomas Jefferson's Tavern Ale from Yards. What more can you ask for, an ESA produced in Maine that can compete w/ if not edge the legendary Fuller's 1845."
""
""
""
""
"This poured out as a clear looking golden color with a fizzy white head on top. The smell of the beer was decent, nothing too exciting though. The taste of the beer had a good amount of malts and grain flavors with a dry bitterness in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel was lighter than I expected. The carbonation wasn't bad either. Overall this was an average beer in my opinion."

"D- not a bad brew for a stock ale, strong ale, whatever, geary's has UK style brews down solid. abundant use of goldings and lots of malt work well, but the flavor can get intense."
"O: always love this one by Geary's, good for the style and good for me."
"O: Another solid brew from Geary's. The style is done very nicely and is definitely a pure example of an English strong ale"
"The Geary's HSA pours a beautiful dark amber, sticky-icky up the sides and a beautiful 1/4 inch head. It smells good but would probably smell better if my dishwasher didn't do such a shitty job. Sorry Geary's. The beer still tastes great. It almost tastes like an ESB despite it's strong ale label. I know the salesman told me I'd say that, and my heart wants to be contrarian, but it does taste like an ESB. Feels great going down. Excellent beer."
"D - This is an exceptionally well crafted English Strong Ale... Strong in all facets... If this were available to me on a regular basis it would no doubt be in my go to rotation... I will gladly invest in a sixer of this anytime I'm passing through ""DL Geary"" territory and stronglys suggest that you do the same... Definitely more than the sum of its parts..."
"Kind of musty and old feeling. A little like I pulled an old bottle out of someones basement. Ok beer."
"drinkability: a great fusion of american and english ales"
"I sometimes wonder how James Joyce got away with this crap for so long."
"O- Didn't even bother to finish. Too flat. Temperature was fairly cold. That felt right. Flavor and carbonation did not cut it for me."
"O/D-Most of my reviews depict the battle between expectation and actuality. This one beats expectations. I think this is a pretty cool beer. Hey, maybe my evading Geary Brewing Company was a bad idea. Geary's Summer, Pale Ale, are you next?"
"O: expected more in the aroma and flavor. I believe I may have waited too long to try this, as after reading some reviews, my aromas and flavors seem lacking. Nice beer though and will try it again."
"Overall- I really like this brew. I will certainly try to get more of this. I think it's certainly a drinkable beer, just watch your quantity with that 7% ABV, it'll catch you."
"Though not bad, this certainly isn't a beer to get excited about."
"The feel of this beer is pretty even and goes down with a smooth feel. Some nice aftertaste that does linger a little too long."
"Man, I love this. That's not a very objective statement to put into a review, but I think it's because this is a taste for yourself kind of beer. It is unbelievably agreeable and sensational, but the reasons why are sort of vague. There aren't huge hoppy notes, or big malty sweets. There is just a balance of all things which create a wonderfully in-tune song. I guess you just have to try it. And I am going to try it...again...and again!"
"D - it depends for me. i love this beer, but there are times when one is surely enough and other times where i can drink 4 of them. the alcohol is well hidden for me, but the buttery taste from the ringwood yeast can make this a sipper."
"Spot on for the style, this beverage emmits a rich though pale malting. Medium golden coloured body with a generous, intially enormous foamy white head. Above average mouthfeel, themalting is complex and tasty, with a dryish and slightly bitter finish."
"D: Nice malty sipping beer if not served too cold"
"The rich fruity malt is masterfully balanced by the grassy hops. A very complex brew that is a joy to drink."
"Why did it take me so long to discover this beer? Geary's really hit it hard with this beer. Right up there with Yorkshire Stingo."
"A recent BOTMC arrival. Looks like a buttkicker at 7%, let's give it a whirl. Popping the top I get hints of licorice, brown sugar and molasses. Pours to a deep bronze with a micro-bubble foamy head. The taste is a kicked up brown ale flavor with a nice noble hop bite. The AC is slightly evident in the lingering but smooth bitter finish. Mouthfeel is good with a nice sparky carbonation to augment the hop bite. This is a very high IBU special ale and is indeed quite tasty. A great drinker but the 7% probably sneaks up fast. I think I'll cellar the other two bottles I have and see how it tastes a year from now."
"D - This is a very interesting beer for sure. I really think it could be marketed as an ""Imperial Amber"" as I find the hops don't seem to be totally true English hops as the BA classification might imply. Nonetheless, I like and think it's really well done."
"D- Could definitely throw back plenty of these without a second thought. Very drinkable IMO"
"Had on cask at Cambridge Common. Deep mahogany color that blended perfectly with the table, topped by the loosest head I've ever seen. I could have dropped a golf ball between the bubbles. At first this had an odd, Flemish-sour bend to it, but that disappeared after it warmed up a bit (relative to its initial temperature). Plenty of hops in the nose, along with vanilla, cherries and a burlappy smell that reminded me of a warm barn. Hops were mild in the taste; malt was dominant with fruit and figs, and the whole thing was very, very dry. Tasty indeed, but I have a suspicion that this might be better a bit colder from a bottle."
"Now this does look like an intriguing beer, doesn't it? It pours a clear russet-ruby topped by about a finger or so of light ecru foam, which doesn't hang around to chat very long. The nose comprises vodka-soaked buttery biscuits, light rye bread, and a smidgen of orange rind. Interesting turn; let's see where it leads. The taste strips away some of the booze, which is replaced by a stronger version of the orange peel. Everything else remains fairly static from nose to tongue. (...Now, that's an image, am I right?) The body is on the heavier side of medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly syrupy feel. Overall, an interesting brew, indeed, but not something I can see drinking very much of in the future."
"DB- I like the malt and yeast flavors but the bitter alcohol finish throws the balance off for me. Interesting but wears me down with a beastly finish. Certainly a ""stronger"" 7% beer."
"The color is a deep amber and it makes a small head when poured. I liked the finish of the beer, but its tanginess reminded me of many German beers -- rather than British ales (as advertised)."
"Drinkability-This beer is very one dimensional. All carmel and malt. if you like these flavors, you will like this beer. The carmel is not overwhelming however, so it does go down easy"
"I'm originally from New England and was never a huge fan of Geary's Pale Ale, but this stuff is INCREDIBALLY GOOD!"
"What a beautiful pour. With the yellow label I was not expecting the dark amber pour. head was creamy eggshell, 3/4 inch. Dissipated quickly, but not quickly enough to keep me from getting that great creamy first sip through it. Soft grass and citrus in the nose, with definite caramel maltiness. velvety mouth feel and orange peel flavor fade into a delicious fresh grass and faint alcohol on the exhale. My favorite Geary's for sure."
"Take my review with a grain of salt - I am not very experienced. But this is the best beer I've ever had."
"D- Average drinkability is affected by the evident alcohol and astringency."
"Overall impression: Not bad at all, but probably not something I'd revisit."
"A solid, well balanced beer."
"I'm a definite sucker for banana bread, so this beer had me from the start, really. While technically this beer suffers from the flaw of ""smells better than it tastes," it tastes good enough."
"Drinkability: The flavor profile, the 7% abv, and the syrupy quality lower the score for me."
"This beer pours a murky brown color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes slowly into nice lacing. The aroma is of molasses, hints of dark chocolate, and caramel. There is no detectable hop presence. This is a rather simple aroma, yet I still find it really appealing. The taste is much like the aroma. It is very malty, but I can sense that there are some hops in there. They don't really come through in the flavor, but there add some balance to this beer. How ever small a hop presence it might be without it I would easily confuse this beer with a Wee Heavy. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with moderate carbonation, and a velvety texture. Overall, this is a nice beer that I will certainly drink again. I am a big fan of IPAs that have enough malt to add complexity. I feel this beer a lot like those beers in that it is a malt bomb but with enough hops to add complexity."
"D: Pretty drinkable but the abv is a bit high and the alcohol has a somewhat more prevalent flavor than I would have liked, but still overall a good beer."
"Cough drop--ish at times, earthy at others but consistently approachable and warming."
"D - This is an interesting style of beer and one that I think I could enjoy quite a bit. I like that many of the barleywine aspects are present but simply toned back. At only 7% abv I think the alcohol taste could be hidden better. Overall, though I am glad I have a six pack of this to store away for a rainy day."
"D: This is an excellent example of the style, a well done brew. It is well balanced and flavorful. It has some strength so it is hard to drink it too fast so drink slowly and enjoy!!"
"The HSA has a very smooth creamy feel. Its a one and done beer for me."
"D: Enjoyed this one fairly well."
"D- Very drinkable beer. I am not terribly familiar with the style, but this is easy to drink and very tasty."
"T- It's quite bitter, very hoppy. And dry, too. It's actually very dry. There is something of a sweet candy aftertaste to it. Honestly, this is too dry for my liking, even if it's a high quality beer."
"3.5 D: Not a bad brew, but not really my cup of tea. I'm not a big fan of English styles."
"Encountered this specialty brew at The Great Lost Bear in Portland, ME. It has a dark clear copper color with a scanty white head and fair lacing. The aroma captures plenty of woodsy malt and light floral hops. The flavor declares a smooth fruity malt that harbors just a hint of wheaty alcohol. There's a touch of bubblegum and more of that floral sweetness. After the initial acclimation you pick up the dry hop aftermath. I don't feel this is very complex, there's not much to say. It's medium drinkable, not something I would rave about, OK, that's about it. Malty alcohol and some dry hop. Just not winning me over."
"This, hands down, is the best beer I have tried from Geary's. It reminds me of a Chimay Red combined with a Sierra Nevada wet hop ale. Just super, and a bargain to boot, for what it is."
"This is a nice pleasant IPA ..errr Ale."
"Drinkability: I think this one hid the alcohol fairly well. I could have a couple as I enjoy the sweetness, but not more."
"12 oz brown bottle obtained at Hannaford's Supermarket Derry, NH. pours a crystal clear copper liquid with barely any head, maybe a centimeter and that's pushing it. smells of woodsy-ness, hops, and raisins definitely invades the senses. definitely taste the raisins and the earthy quality of the hops. doesn't give a nice after taste, reminds me of my nail polish remover. moderate carbonation. the drink ability of this beer isn't very good.... unless you like to drink nail polish. I get the impression that the bottle of beer i purchased wasn't very fresh, so hopefully I will obtain a fresh brew of this kind and be able to give this a better score,"
"I would definitely recommend this. The brew is surprisingly complex and is quite drinkable for an ale of its strength."
"D: Ya not to to many but a few more would be nice. I would think this would be a great beer to put out in the fall."
"A delightful little ale."
"Flavor starts with a bit of fruity spice and caramel-toffee malts that give way to a finish of raw, bitter hop leaves and sticky booze. Occasionally I detect traces of chestnut and oak. Thankfully, the sweetness never becomes cloying, though, as I've found this to be the case with many higher-ABV English ales. Body is dead-pan medium in consistency, with an uppity carbonation level that brings out some of the milder characteristics of the malts and yeast esters towards the finish. Top notch English Strong Ale, here; if you ask me, Geary's is underrated."
"12oz. bottle served in a standard pint glass. No freshness dating indicated. Poured a hazy copper with a half inch off-white head that evenutally settles into a fairly consistent, thin cap. Some strands and spatters of lacing present during the tasting. Nose suggests caramel and dark fruit (perhaps fig and/or prunes). Taste consistent with nose for the most part, but there is a strange, chemical aftertaste detectable at the finish, that lingers between quaffs. Also a little bit of alcohol heat comes out in the mix. Mouthfeel falls between light-and medium-bodied, but carbonation is a little prickly and there's a lingering bitterness at the finish. Interesting, but I'm not loving it. A little too much of a chemical character to be drinkable."
"Drink ability: Being full bodied, this beer probably would be very filling after 2 or more. Although it is filling, this beer is most definitely enjoyable. I thought that the balance between malts and hops was well done."
"I've had this on-tap and in bottle form, on-tap kicks the bottles rear, but I went with a bottle review since that is how most people will get to experience HSA."
"I had this last night and have quite the headbanger today. Must be the higher ABV, but I think that ringwood came back to bite me in the ass. Drinker's beware, when Geary's says special, they really mean ""special."" A very good beer."
"Easy to drink and well-priced are it's big attributes to me."
"Drinkability: While not a session beer, I could easily have two of these and would get this one as a beer for a cold winter night."
"d: I'd never heard of this until a buddy handed me one. Very nice stuff."
"Poured a deep copper with a thin white rim of foam. Settling left a slight bit of lacing around the glass. The nose is very malty. A little bit of breadiness and some hop sweetness. The taste is very malty, with some caramel sweetness. There is a definite bread taste as well. Overall this was an interesting beer and worth a shot."
"Drinkability - A little to sweet for my taste, but a very good stab at the strong ale style. Quite a nice offering."
"Amber colored beer with rapidly fading head.Aroma is dark fruit.Taste is dark fruit,caramel and toffee.This is one of the most aromatic beers I've had in awhile.Taste and smooth,you cannot tell this beer is 7% from just taste alone.I would recommend and purcahse again!!"
"Overall- Big buttery and sweet make this a bit cloying. alc., eventually, smoothes out."
"D- excellent, a very nice offering from Geary's."
"Drinkability is excellent on this beer. For all of the strong tastes and flavors in this beer, they all balance very nicely and compliment each other. So smooth and drinkable this is a great beer for the style, probably the best I have ever had."
"Nice cold weather warmer. Good flavor. Enjoyable brew. Wish I had access to this & others from Geary's."
"This has a high drinkability, especially considering the 7% factor. This might be my favorite of Geary's thusfar."
"Nice. Not everybody's cup of tea, but nice."
"Pours a beautifully clear reddish amber with a frothy off white head that dissipates quickly. Smells of alcohol and a bit of floral and perfume, some sweet malt in there bread and biscuit. Really great nose. Taste is sweet malt up front some toffee and caramel. With some alcohol and hop bitterness mid to finish. Some raisins or dried fruits in there too. Medium to thick body. A syrupy oily mouthfeel. Low carbonation. Great Strong ale, if not a touch sweet. Not cloying, but a little sweet."
"I expected more of this beer and while I am not usually turned off by a strong alcohol presence, it's somehow a bit too much in this beer. If I was freezing my tuchus off in Maine, I might have a different opinion ..."
"Geary's has come up with a pretty impressive English Strong Ale here. I actually had somewhat low expectations and walk away surprised and impressed. I think dialing down the carbonation would smooth it out and improve it to a degree. But, other than that, it's alright. Definitely worth a try."
"Big thanks to charlesw for sending this my way in Beer Powerball."
"Drinkability-Exceptional definitely a must have!"
"Full and creamy on the tongue. A little too much carbonation or this would be a 5. A really god beer. Seems sessionable as the alcohol is pretty well hidden, but at 7%, this beer is testing the boundaries of sessionability. A good, solid beer."
"Personal favorite, can't say enough good things about it. We're blessed with the availability of a great assortment of great beers in Portsmouth (including our hometown favorite, the illustrious Smutty!), but this one will always have a special place in my heart."
"D- Not too bad. The oxidization takes it down a notch, but the flavors are very mellow and are improving as it warms."
"D: While probably past it's prime glad I tried it. Totally different fresh. Don't hold on to one for more than 3 years tops."
"D: Overall, this is a drinkable beer - if you're into the style. It has a complex character on the whole that's a little bracing at first. Still, a solid brew."
"A tasty one for sure -- I think I pulled this one in the wrong season. Hard to knock back more than one in the summertime, but I'm sure once the cooler fall weather hits I'll be stocking this a bit more. Grabbed this as a single and glad I did."
"Sampled this on draft at Harlow's Pub on 1/6/2005.. Poured an amber color with a relatively thick head and quite a bit of lacing. Quite malty and sour with caramel and some bitter hops. Overall, a strong brew that tilts towards malts. I'd get it again."
"Not overly complex but well done."
"Honey amber reddish body hosts a two finger off white head that fades to just a skim in minutes. Nose has big floral notes with phelonic spices, creamy fruits, and candied alchol notes. Flavor profile is abrubt with shrill bitter notes and citrus rind sour tones. A balance of grapefruit like hops and rocky malts round out the taste profile. Mouthfeel is a grapefriut rich bitter and a bit of a soapy tone. This is decently drinkable but a bit scattered."
"D - A decent enough brew, but not what I thought it was going to be. Solid, but there's nothing outstanding about this beer."
"M/D - Medium bodied but a little thin on the feel. Good carbonation. A very sippable brew."
"Appears an amber copper hue with a large off white cream head fine bubbled forms thick at least three fingers deep on the pint glass. By the way the head dwindles slowly and JohnnyP this one's for you. Lacing is left behind evenly in thin streaks between sips. Aroma contains tart fruit notes namingly some cherry and wood essence with an air of anise. Almost a cidery character to it in my opinion, again with more barrel notes. Flavors are wild with a front to back barrage of tart fruit, alcohol and wood aged caramel with anise spiced booziness. Caramelized brown sugar and strong alcohol flow together in the finish tickling the nose hairs just a bit but the body is a simple syrup texture with light carbonation that doesn't catch you until the back of the throat, really interesting definitely hard to describe. Drinkability overall this is a bit of a strange bird and it definitely screams a unique New England quality. I'm assuming that part, I've never traveled that far to the Northeast but again worth a try holds a special place in my beer memory and I saw it in Virginia had to pick up a bottle. A little bit of dust collected on the bottle but I assure you this one is still drinking prime."
"When finished I was excited to try a different brand."
"Poured a light amber and off white head into a pint glass. Got a good whiff of some good hops. The first taste in the sip was a nice bitter hop followed by some slightly sweet and nutty smooth malts. The head left nice lacing down the pint glass. Definitely a great, quality ale. I could have a couple of these in a sitting."
"An okay beer, does its job by packing a little more punch than a Pale Ale without going into the Barleywine territory. Lightly complex. Recommended."
"Try this beer if you like strong ales!"
"I enjoyed this beer, and I'd buy it again."
"D: Overall a generally good ale, with a outdoorsy palate of dried woodiness, malt, pine and citrus making for an easy drinking ale by the fireplace."
"D - A very tasty brew, and one worth seeking out. I've yet to experience many in this field, but I must say, this has certainly sparked my interests."
"Definitely recommended..."
"D- Despite its odd flavor and texture profile, this is a beer that is nothing if not incredibly drinkable. By halfway through the glass I find myself craving more of a beer that at first taste seems sub par at best. This one is definitley different and worth a try if you are adventurous."
" .. which is insane. i can see how so many people get hurt drinking this stuff. makes a fantastic session beer, and the palate doesn't tire of it. gulp, gulp, grin."
"All in all I was very happy with this beer!"
"D: Not very tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, good kick, decent representation of style. I really wasn’t all that impressed with this beer and it’s not one that I’d want to drink again."
"This ale surprised me, and I found it to be full of flavor, excellent in balance, and very drinkable. This would make a good session ale, despite it's high ABV. I'll be buying this again."
"gives you an ""imperial"" sort of unexpected buzz. very warm."
"D: Damn fine beer, could have a few and be feeling great. Rich and interesting and well balanced. Can't ask for much more."
"Pours a clear amber brown with a light tan head. On the nose it is tar like with a slight alcoholic tone to it. There is something else that is extremely prevalent that I just cant put my finger on. Peat, maybe? On the mouth it is...whoa...sorry...was tasting and typing at the same time. Smooth and even. Strong caramel tones on the mouth. Feel is good, with a lower carbonation. Thicker with an almost syrupy feel. Definitely drinkable, but its definitely a strong English ale."
"Drinkability: wow  this goes down quickly and smoothly  an excellent ale, one that should have a permanent place in the refrigerator."
"Thanks again, John!"
"Wonderfully complicated. This is one of the nicer complex offerings."
"This beer poured a dark copper color with very little head. It smells of toasted malts and a hint of sweetness. The taste is pleasant with a sweet tartness followed by a little bit of hops. This is a very easy drinking beer with a pleasant crisp mouthfeel. I expect I may be picking it up again in the future."
"12 oz. stubby with no freshness date. It pours a clear, coppery amber, with high carbonation and a half-inch, light brown, fine-bubbled head that leaves decent lacing. The bouquet is big on floral hops, with toasted, caramel, and maybe buttery malts, some candy sweetness, and a touch of apple - nice, but it could be more aromatic. It has a big toasted and caramel malt flavor, with diacetyl, dark fruits, and hints of molasses and alcohol. There are also floral/perfumy and citric hops that impart a medium bitterness, and are almost abrasive at the back of the throat. Quite smooth, medium in body and carbonation, and it leaves a long finish. Good beer - English malting, but American-level hopping - kinda reminded me of a hoppier Eye of the Hawk. Tastes great, but could use some refinement."
"Drinkability: This beer exceeded my expectations and then some. I find it to be smoothe and satisfying with dark, fruity flavors and a drying bitterness to keep me coming back. It has a lot of tastes/feels/aromas to enjoy. Highly worth trying."
"Medium-bodied, and smoooth, with a good drinkabilty for the abv/noticeable alcohol. Well-made, well-balanced and true to style."
"Pours a mostly clear reddish-brown color with a medium thick and creamy light tan head that has good retention. Patchy lacing on the glass. Equal parts toasted malt and hops in the nose. Medium, smooth body with a moderately hoppy character supported by sweet caramel and malt flavors. Mild spice and alcohol are present too. The finish is hoppy with touches of toasted malt and fruit in the aftertaste. Straightforward and easy to drink, this is a pretty good session beer."
"D: Quite tasty! Intriguing flavors, something different. Easy to drink, too (mine didn't last more than 5 minutes...it was a long day at work...); 7% makes it a strong ale to 'session' but I certainly have liked another..."
"Drank real easy for the ABV, a really tasty offering from one of the first Maine breweries I ever tasted (back in the 90s)"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- It's tingly in the beginning, but at the same time it's soapy and slick. Great body, and the drinkability is... well, ""dangerous"" as Michael Jackson once said. At 7%, this is superbly crafted and round."
"Pours a light amber color with a one-finger head. Smell is strong and malty upfront, much like the style implies. Taste is reminiscent of a barleywine, with a softness to it and a lot of fruity/biscuity overtones in the finish. Very tasty to me. The alcohol seems to have mellowed, creating a very drinkable ale that is far more suited for sipping than chugging. I like this very much."
"Cheers."
"Drinkability: A little too sweet from my perspective, this ale offers an interestingly different approach and is worth a try"
"D - A nice clean ale w/ a bit of strength. There is a nice English ale character that is very drinkable and full of flavor."
"D: Tasty and smooth but very full-bodied and with heavy alcohol presence."
"Orange in color with a good head, looks like it will be a decent brew.It tastes slightly English if that makes any sense but it is a little too strong and I usually dont say that. This is a decent beer but not one I will seek out again, doesn't suit my tastes."
"Great drinkability, just a pleasure to drink. My first look at this style, and it's fairly impressive."
"Final Statment: It wasn't until after I took the notes I was told of the percentage. I was about to declare this a very sessionable ale until I found out it was 7%! There was no hint of alcohol warmth in this at all. Could be a dangerous beer. Definately nothing to turn down."
"Nose of heady honeysuckle flower with a noticeable ferric element. The malts are in main attendance here, showing nice marshmallow and tropical citric essence as well. Moderately assertive hop character balances out this brew. Tasting this beer, the hops take the forefront, much more so than the nose would lead you. Moderate hopping with generous warm honeyed malts makes for a well-made and enjoyable brew. Alcohol is virtually undetectable. Slightly viscous and nicely creamy and crisp in the mouth, this is fine ale for enjoying straight up or with your favorite meal."
"Drinkability: I gotta say I can't see myself drinking this beer very often. All the grassy, earthy tastes are not something I enjoy in beer. I might come back to something like this once and a while, but probably just to remind of me what those tastes are."
"On the whole, this is an eminently drinkable beer. A bit heavier and more potent than a true session beer should be. Nonetheless, cut out a couple of these from your total alotment and you would have the perfect beer to enjoy for a time while sitting and talking with friends, watching a game or enjoying any kind of celebration. A truely 'Special Ale,'"
"Overall, a pretty tasty beer. I begin to wonder why we only see this in my area during the summer. A damn fine english strong ale, although there are a few better strong/old ales and barley wines out there. Well worth trying, and picking up. Don't go way out of your way for it, but if you haven't tried it, pick some up. Normally, Geary's beers I find to be VERY hit or miss.... this seems to be a pretty solid offering."
"Poured amber with a head that quickly fades to nothing. Spotty lacing. The smell is quite malty, but dry. The taste has that same dry maltiness up front, but this is followed by quite a whallop of bitter orange hops and a spicy finish. Quite tasty. Mouthfeel is a bit prickly, but it suites the hop slam. Quite a nice treat, a beautiful if hoppier than usual exampleof the style."
"Pours a nice clean/clear dark golden amber color, nice carbonation, nice small foamy tannish head, nice sticky lacing follows. The nose is malty, slightly spicy, and lots of caramel. The taste is malty, slightly bitter, some spicness, and lots of caramel. Medium body. Very drinkable, a tasty ESA, glad to have had a chance to try it."
"I want to drink these all night even with a 7.00% ABV. Yum."
"This one is a good drinker. The 7% ABV is pretty well hidden."
"one of the most drinkable beers i've ever had. i don't want to put it down. pours dark amber brown with a frothy white head. great staying power, decent lacing. definitly picking up some fruity notes in the nose, sweet like honey. the taste is balanced, mellow, malty, hoppy, i could go on. just very nice. i'm sorry i didn't pick this up sooner. kind of like a barleywine junior. good beer."
"Pours a deep copper orange color, accented by rich orange highlights when held up to the light. A fat two-finger head sits atop and leaves a bit of lace. Nice enough, to be sure, but nothing to write home about. The aroma is full of dark fruit. Dense prune and raisin scents, with some banana and pear thrown in for good measure. Malty and fruity aroma for the most part, but with some spices as well; maybe some coriander, or something akin to that, and a hint of pepper. The taste is quite pleasant. A very nice balance of fruit and spice, with the kiss of hops making themselves known in the end. Boozy, but not overwhelmingly alcoholish. At 7% ABV, this is, perhaps, to be expected. Crisp, clean mouthfeel, but still sturdy. I wouldn't call this a highly drinkable beer, but it is an entirely drinkable beer, if that makes sense. Not for the faint of heart, and not for everyone, the Geary's HSA is a tasty treat for spicy malt beer fans. A beer I won't seek out often, but one that I'll gladly have again."
"This beer pours a nice copper orange with only minimal head which doesn't hang around long. Minimal lacing. The smell is very good, even right from the bottle. I detect lots of malt, caramel, wheatiness, some hops, maybe some spices. This is a pretty syrupy, full bodied beer, sort of sticky consistency with moderate carbonation. The taste is quite strong for a 7 ABV. I thought it had a higher ABV just from the alcohol tones which are present throughout. The taste is caramel, some orange, some spice, malt, and bitterish hops. This is a complex beer with lots going on, but a little on the bitter side for my tastes. There is some imbalance towards the hops and the alcohol taste is a bit too strong for this one. The aftertaste is also quite bitter and the esters of the hops do come through as well. Good but not my favorite either."
"Clear medium amber with a thin cap of fine, whitish foam. Some stickage between sips, decent head retention for what's there. Aromas of floral hops, caramel, brown sugar, and fruity esters (pear?). Malty flavour, not overly sweet, but with a mellow caramel backbone and a solid, balanced bitterness. A little bready, toasty, estery middle, and a hint of alcohol. Medium bodied, lowish carbonation, slightly grainy texture with a bit of warmth at the end. Very nice. A well-crafted, easy drinking english strong ale. I like this one quite a bit."
"On tap at Eastern Standard in Boston, this hearty brew poured a dark amber color with a very small off-white head. Head dissapeared completely. Strong aromas of sweet malt and alcohol hit you in the nose. Big malt flavors abound here, with a mild fruity quality and a pronounced alcohol presence. Bitter hops display themselves in the finish. Almost whiskey-like aftertaste. This is a big and malty beer to sip on a cold winter's night. Another good one from Geary's."
"12oz bottle. Pours a medium straw colour, with significant carbonation but not much head. Aroma is all malt and of a decent strength. The first taste is a bit too sparkly due to the carbonation, after which the malt flavours shine through. Some hops linger in the aftertaste. Some alcohol is noted in the nice lingering taste. A bit too sparkly for my preference, but this is rather well balanced and enjoyable."
"D- It is pretty good. I think it is a solid brew but not sure if I would get another any time soon just since I would prefer to try other new beers. If I found it around here though I might buy some."
"Medium bodied with light carbonation. Sweet, dry aftertaste. Good beer to have on a cool day as the alcohol has a nice warming effect."
"D: What this beer lacks in complexity it makes up in drinkability. It can be paired with almost any food. It's also great on its own. Above average ABV helps make this a great winter time brew, as well. One of my favorites. A staple in my fridge."
"Very fruity with a crisp after taste, mild hop smell, light lacing and light carbonation. The 7% alcohol is hidden well. A fair beer that could use a tad more hops. Fruitier than my taste, still not bad but I wont be making any special trips to Maine for this one."
"Pours an intense rubied orange hue, with a scummy thin head despite the rousing pour into a chalice glass. No lacing. The aroma is intense and complex--a sweet intense caramel malt aroma, fruits and dark syrups, alcohol and some hop aromas, but dominated by a complex fruity sweetness. The taste is unique, malty, and intense, english style with spicy malts and a fruity sweetness--a bit alcoholic, but it's hidden in the mix and not a swash across the palate. The hops are present, oh yes, spicy and resinous flavors linger. The key word for this beer is complex, but after a few sips, you loose that complexity and taste that it's too sweet, with a hoppy compliment. Moutheel is light for this style, but not water. More body would definitely make this more enjoyable drinking, and a bit carbonated for me, but thats nothing a harder pour couldn't remedy for my preferences. Overall, I like this beer, and seeing as I don't much care for strong ales, this is a winner. I can indeed imagine it being even better than it is, but it's a solid drinker that is not hard to locate, and that's always a plus for a local good-drinking brew."
"This was a college favorite back when this was only available when the weather sucks and was capped by gold foil. Still a tasty brew in spite of its expanded production and distribution. A high-octane session beer for discriminating barflies."
"is one for you."
"Medium-bodied, medium strength. Has a nice ale flatness. A good, solid ale. Slight alcohol bite, but with a sweet balance. Quite drinkable."
"Drinkability is wonderful. While an ale, this could also double as a winter warmer as well. I'm not usually a fan of beers with heavy fruit notes, but this one passes in my book. Recommended."
"I've been on a strong ale kick lately and this is one of the better ales I've sampled. Retention isn't great, but the orange-ruby red coloring is gorgeous. Smell and taste are both subtle and appropriate for the style and I'm tempted to give 4.5's, but I just can't pull enough complexity out (maybe next time). Tastes of orange, apples and sweet berries with a touch of grassy bitterness. Smooth mouthfeel and very easy drinking. No hint of alcohol, this one could be a dangerous session beer. Go try this."
"Drinkabliity- I'm not thinking of going back here again anytime soon it wasn't awful just not for me anymore."
"Too bad this isn't available in Minnesota where you need winter warmers for about six months of the year."
"The drinkability is ok, I just can't decide if I really like the unusual sweet fruity taste . MK"
"Interesting and tasty ale that doesn't seem to fit nicely into a defined style."
"Into a pint glass, pours a nice copper with pretty good head and spotty lacing. Aroma is light, sweetly malty with faint hops, of the English persuasion. Mouth is well bodied with good carbonation, and nicely warming. Taste also is sweetish, caramel malts probably, a touch dry through the middle with accompanying fruits and (acidy?) hops. Finish is long and the alcohol makes cameo about here. Overall, pretty darn good beer, thanks to hopdog for the trade"
"Tasted good , but probably would be happy with just one."
"12 oz. bottle from Tiger Town in Gardiner. Red/amber body with about a finger of off-white head. Smells malty butterscotch, and yeasty (ringwood). Roasty malt dominates with hints of diacetyl, alcohol, and hop. Definitely a malt-forward beer. Medium-bodied. Alcohol warming creeps in after a few sips. Tasty and drinkable. One sip invites another, and one bottle invites another too! A solid ale. Worth the hype."
"Pours a clear copper color with hints of amber throughout. A half finger white head quickly sinks to a swirly coating. Great smell with toasted sweet malts dominant. Also present are caramel, cherries, and some vanilla. Taste is much like the smell. Sweet malts, again, dominate but also present are molasses and cherries. Finishes with a bit of spicy hops which bring a bit of bitterness. Nice medium body with moderate carbonation. Good drinkability, nicely balanced I will definitely have this again."
"It is smooth and almost creamy, but drying as well. An interesting feel. It masks the 7% well. I wish I had another....I would love to try this fresh. Very nice. Thanks Paulie."
"Very good beer, looking forward to more of this as it gets colder. Not something I would think of drinking more than 2 or 3 at a time."
"This beer is pretty magical. It is sweet with light caramel, like candy, but has the pepperiness, alcohol zip, and frim bitterness to balance it off. There are not many beer that can have full flavor, warmth, and yet retain ultimate drinkability. There is enough going on in this beer to keep me interested all night, and the finish always makes me want another. The seven percent is too high to be the best ""session"" beer, but the warmth is certainly appreciated in the cold months. Its looks are ok, a copper beer with a small off-white head that laces a bit but does not last for that long. The nose is oak butter with a couple golden leaves of earthy hop. The taste is strong, complex, and all good. Resiny with some alcohol heat. Medium-big bodied, but not sticky. Finishes in a sweet-candy/bitter-flower-petal warmth. Special ale indeed; I enjoy this more than the numbers show."
"Pours a semi-clear amber/copper color with a half-inch head that comes and goes. No lacing to speak of. Smells of sweet malts, toffee, butterscotch, fruits. Taste is of more toffee, butterscoth, cherries, pretty sweet, and finishes with a good hoppiness. Mouthfeel is not heavy but not light either, velvety, moderate carbonation. Very drinkable for the abv level. A definite pleasure to drink."
"I'd like to try a fresh sample a) to get a sence of how hoppy this beer really is, b) to hedge against possible oxidation and c) because it drinks pretty danged easily for a seven percenter."
"peace...bc"
"A tasty strong ale and quite drinkable.I suspect that it will even continue to improve after a few more months in the cellar. It definitely makes me want to try more of Geary's offerings."
"it's pretty highly carbonated, and that takes away from the malt experience. brown sugar aroma, with date and raisin. more darker fruit flavors in the flavor. strong bitterness"
"This offering from Geary's pours a crystal clear orange body that leaves a thin off-white lace. The aroma is sweet, citrus hops are what comes to mind, followed by some malty sweetness tough to make out though. The taste starts very sweet upfront on the palate, it leaves you with a brown sugar, caramel, feel that is quickly balanced with some english style hops not pungent at all more mellow and smooth. The finish is silent, no real, back end to this beer maybe a bit of spirit quality to it but overall very drinkable. This brew paired well with the pepperoni and mushroom flatbread pizza I was having."
"The box proudly proclaims ""now available year-round"" and explains that available since 1989, this brew was ""only"" available eight months a year. Uh, I guess. Maybe it's a Maine thing...this is a cold weather beer in my mind. (note to self: see how this compares to Double Bag...need more data!)"
"12 oz. bottle, 7% ABV indicated on the label. Pours a hazy reddish/copper color, with a foamy off-white head. The head fades rather quickly. Aromas of caramel, candied fruits, alcohol, and pine forest. Flaovrs are similar, adding some spruce or juniper, apples, pears, and some zesty spices at the end. Just enough bitterness to hold things together. Perhaps some floral hops at the end. There are really a lot of flavors going on here, very nice. Big thanks to mcallister for this one!"
"D: This is my first reviewed Eng. strong ale, and I think I prefer the American versions so far. Not a bad beer, but it just isn't very interesting to me."
"I didn't really think this was anything special the first time I tried this, but it really has grown on me. Translucent, golden-copper appearance to go with a thin, off-white head isn't anything out of the ordinary. The STRONG, warming alcohol tinge to go with hints of molasses and smokey maple syrup in both the nose and the mouth make this beer a flavor-filled monster . Amost like an ultra-malty version of an American IPA. Be careful, this will pretty much kill your palette, but it's well matched with strong cheeses and rye bread. It's the perfect Winter beer even though I'm lovin' it in the Summer."
"Poures a deep reddish-copper color with magnificient white puffy head that lasted throughout the glass. Smell is dark fruity and malty. Taste presents itself with a strong malty, fruity taste that is nicely balanced with a pronounced hoppiness. Finished nice a dry and beckoned for another taste. Nice drinkability for a strong ale."
"D - I could drink this beer all day and night....and get into serious trouble doing so. My favorite Geary's brew!"
"Shew, had trouble finishing this one, in fact I gave the rest to my girlfriend who apparently loves it."
"Aroma is a great balance of caramel malty notes and spicy hops. Taste is roasted malt and nuts, with some brown sugar sweetness and a dry hoppy finish. A perfectly balanced brew, and extremely drinkable for a stronger beer. I could easily session a few of these, and end up drunk due to the strength. Definitely lives up to its reputation."
"Fairly full body but not heavy. Surprisingly strong carbonation. I think this beer could improve if the carbonation was lighter -- it seems a bit harsh. This is a sipping beer, but a drinkable one. Yum."
"It's an American craft brew standard, and while that's a lot to live up to, I enjoyed it very much. It's got a fresh, fruity personality that makes it one very flavorful quaff. The ABV warms a bit, and does nothing to impede its drinkability. I have five more of these, and I expect each one to be as good and enjoyable as the first."
"Damn good beer. Silky smooth mouthfeel with a long long finish. As in the nose big caramel malt flavors, rich buttery toffee, some hop grain, sweet cinnamon. Easily drinkable a damn good beer."
"Drinkability is tops. I love the British style brews, and this one is a new favorite."
"Best of the bunch from Geary's I think. Pours golden/red color. little head. Smells malty. Taste? Nice balance of hops, malt, some sharp fruity flavor like apple. Mouthfeel is damn good. Overall I like this one a lot. I ahven't had this in a while, but it's easy to find and will get more soon."
"Aroma is mildly spicy and perfumey with caramelized sugar notes (crystal malt), caramel malt and toffee. Body is a ruddy orange with a thin white head. Fore is fruity with apple, pear and honey laden throught he middle with mild hop bitterness. Also some bready malt notes from the middle back. Doesnt go anywhere unexpected flavor wise, but it is fairly intense and assertive and I found myself quite eagerly knocking back bigger and bigger sips. Nice brew."
"first hit is well balanced light on the palate, with a doughy, wheaty flavor's lightly sweet from good malt the sweet flavor is very rich and deep, with subtle hints of ""greens"". I find myself really enjoying this one, Very drinkable. Goes down really easy. this one really impressed me, one of fav's of this style! Nice work Geary!"
"Overall: Not my favorite style, but a decent, good brew that does nothing to wow me. Sweet and malty with a full body. Probably not one I'd try again, but glad I tried it at all."
"Thanks to geexploitation for this very solid beer, I bet it would be awesome on cask."
"Lightish copper. Fairly aromatic, with a unique blend of malts, creating lovely caramel, toffee and fruit aromas with a light hint of floral hops. Fluffy, creamy texture with a heavy body. Awfully bitter, unfortunately, as it seems to take away from the multi-dimensional malt flavor. Soft crystal malt character with a light hint of peated malt, providing pleasant butterscotch hints. Light apple notes and caramel are present as well. Sharp hop bitterness on the finish. Pretty nice stuff."
"Drinkability: Definitely a solid brew, and though I drank it sans meal, I imagine it would go well with all kinds of good stuff. Glad I finally picked this up. At 7% ABV you don't want to go crazy, but craving for at least a minor session certainly warrants the possibility of having this sucker around."
"Feels good to drink local!"
"Rich, full, balanced flavor and loads of personality. Very enjoyable and highly recommended."
"This beer it suprisingly awesome. Its nicely complex and seems to cover a lot of different tastes. Kind of like yummy controlled chaos."
"Pours a nice amber with a descent beige head that recedes quickly but leaves some lace. The aroma has a nice caramel sweetness, along with some buttery diacetyl. Some berry and cherry fruits, honey and a touch floral hops and a hint of alcohol...subtle and british. The flavor starts of with some big malt; caramel, toasted bread, berries and cherries, and honey. Also a fair amount of diacetyl, as well as some esters and alcohol. The mouthfeel is big and slightly chewy with subtle carbonation and drinkability is descent. An enjoyable english strong ale, but a bit much on the diacetyl for my tastes."
"This brew poured a very nice red/copper color with a thick white head that died down very quickly. Smell was somewhat medicinal with toasted malt and grain along with some cherry and wine aromas surfacing as well...kind of barleyine like. The taste had a good deal of complexities to it; namely burnt grain and some biscuit in there also. Funny how the smell differed so much from the taste. Mouthfeel was very medium bodied and prickly. Although none of the flavors were overpowering, I don't think I could drink more then one or two of these beers. A very interesting offering....seemed very similar to an altbier in the taste and mouthfeel. Definetly a beer worth trying."
"Drinkability: The combination of alcoholic hotness and rather overwhelming citrus hoppiness would probably keep me to just one."
"Finally, Geary's Hampshire Special Ale provides an opportunity for some Irish Car Bomb-type fun. Perhaps this is blasphemy on this site, I don't know, but take my advice and, sometime, drop a shot of primo bourbon into a glass of Hampshire Special. The flavors complement each other very, very well. Enjoy!"
"flavor. Feels great in the mouth, and is very drinkable. Highly recomended as a wonderful every-day beer."
"Mouth feel is a bit oily and actively carbonated."
"Its beers like this that highlight the downside to buying singles when trying new beers: once in a while, you come across a brew that makes you wish you had bought a six-pack, maybe two. Gearys HSA is one of those beers and man am I kicking myself for passing up the sixer. Great malt flavor with nicely balancing hop bite. Drinkable and delicious, I highly recommend this one!"
"Drinkability - very tasty and at 7% abv, is just within session range (having disposed of 5 sixers in the past 2 months). Hey, at $4.49 per sixer, that's hard to resist."
"from the bottle. poured deep amber with a smal off white head. aroma, sweet berries, honey, cherries, caramel, toffee, malt and hops. flavor, didnt let me down the flavor was just like the aroma, but the honey took a back seat to the rest of the flavors and got a nice touch of alcohol. a good beer"
"Nice copper color with smallish tan head that dissolves into a nice thin cover. Rich aroma. Sweet aroma. Draws you in with its caramel stickiness. Light toasty flavor. I didn't expect it to be that light. Very easy to drink. Sweetness feels the mouth and sticks to the lips, yet dry finish tingles the tongue. Alcohol is a little too apparent for my taste, but it is not bad considering that it's a relatively strong brew. This beer may make me a fan of Geary's."
"I was pretty surprised to find this one at my local beer store, but am glad I happened to notice it as I glanced over their selection."
"Geary's has made a great beer.Try it."
"A nice Ale ! Very drinkable and I think it would only take about four (4) in a row, and I would be in fine mellow condition !"
"I've had the chance to have this brew on cask today. Much more complex than the tap or bottle versions. Much deeper malty flavors and complexity. There appears to be less diacetyl, although it isn't huge in the bottle or tap versions either. Incredible maltiness and flavor. A great beer."
"M&D Fantastic. Losing motor functions as I type. Great beer"
"Wow, amazingly drinkable. I think this is my favorite of the Geary's beers. I think this would be my perfect session beer. Its maltiness is kind of reminiscent of an Oktoberfest beer's. I love it! Can't wait to get more!"
"A nearly perfect beer."
"Overall very good! I look forward to having another. I would really like to try this on tap."
"Satisfying and not overpowering, with flavors sufficiently understated to emphasize each characteristic. Will definitely revisit this brew."
"Good beer. Rich and flavorful. Started out so-so and really came on."
"Better than I expected. Looks rusty and a bit murky. Moderately carbonated and laced well. Lacks head retention. Smells malty, slightly toasted and roasty. Mild spices come through the nose. Tastes Malty and molassas-like. Nutty, fig-ey, and caramel round out the sweetness. Balanced with bitter and flavor hops, spices, and carbonation. A chewy body again moderated by light carbonation. finishes a bit cloying and malty. Better balance and a rounder beer than I had given it credit for. Will try again."
"I enjoy D.L. Geary Brewing Company's beer, it is always enjoyable and delicious. This is one of their more famous brews. The Hampshire Special Ale has a nice amber red glow to it. No head when poured into a pint glass. Has some nice earthy aromas with hints of spices. Some malts come through as you inhale more. Nice first taste, hitting right on the front of your tongue. Good flavor as the spices and a slight sweet flavor cut through the malts. Slow aftertaste creeps in as the bitters end. Good overall taste. Good session beer, just dont get too far in the hole."
"Taste is fantastic, there is malt, and caramel, spices, honey, fruit and that hint of alcohol are all going across the tongue. It is well balanced with all the flavors going on and a well done brew. I could enjoy this beer all the time. If you see this one on the self, dont pass it buy it is well worth the try."
"I expected this beer to be a litte bit bigger. It was pretty light bodied for it's style, but it's worth a try."
"drinkability is fine, very nice brew, that I would drink again, no complaints here."
"Drinkability  I wouldnt put this in a taste test with Fullers, but it was good enough to enjoy."
"I enjoyed many HSA's on many cold New England nights, always a pleasure. It's nice to revisit some old favorites and discover that they are as good as ever!"
"Pours a dark copper color, and maybe I poured to slowly but there's barely any head on this thing. Smell is very fragrant, sprucy and fruity, smelling of pears, apples, and even an odd bubblegum scent in there. Solid taste. Lots of flavors, such as those listed above as well as some buttery toffee and English tea character and faint alcohol qualities. Nicely balanced, neither hops nor malt takes over, leaving the tastebuds free to explore the tastes of this beer. Slick medium mouthfeel. A pleasure to drink."
"This beer is fantastic. A fantastic balance of hops and malt, one of those beers that doesn't come around every day. One taste and you know this one lives up to the term ""special", if not defines it. Each sip begs another, highly drinkable and wonderfully tasty. Definitely recommended."
"Bought a six pack from Martignetti's . Poured a nice deep amber , minimal head. Bourbon like smell, indicative of the 7% ABV. Very tasty mix of fruit and spice, does not hide the alcohol as well as others but it's not too overpowering. Overall a great beer that I'd go back to anytime."
"This one was a great pre-dinner beer. Did not have another to go with my meal but would certainly like to have another. Drinkable for sure."
"The mouthfeel is very soft with low carbonation. It seems well suited to the flavor profile. Very easy to drink beer would be a good session beer for anyone who likes brown ales, English ales, etc. Glad I finally was able to try, next time I will bring some home!"
"Finish is pretty dry and bitter but leaves a cool refreshing aftertaste that surprised me."
"Nicely balanced drink this; flavors of pecan sticky buns and toasted maple branches plaster your buds. Slick sips drain easily while aromas of coconut marshmallows and circus peanuts stick to your nose hairs like insane sugar sea jellies. Finishes mellow and wet with traces of stainless. Pleasant drinking if you don't plan on more than a couple."
"I was very glad that Geary's decided to make this beer a year-round offering. Its a solid beer and one of my favorites from this brewery."
"In conclusion, this is a well crafted beer that rises above average in every aspect, however doesn't quite rise to the occasion of being excellent in any category except (luckily) the taste."
"I'd highly recommend this one...i was quite suprised!"
"a very good all around beer, drinkable for the ABV to be sure, not harsh or strong enough in any category to make it a no-no for any type off food.. from sushi to pizza this one does fine."
"I have to be honest -- there's not a lot to say. It's a reasonably strong, sweet-ish ale. This is a pretty one-dimensional but extremely well executed beer. A great pizza, football, or chillin-by-yourself beer."
"12 ouncer, with a new label motif, twist off cap. No freshness dating. Pours a nice honey/golden tone of amber, white head of tiny bubbles and leaving moderate lacing. Clear, with bubbles streaming to the top for a good long while. Nose is malty, with some vanilla, and confectionary sugar. This is a sweet, flavorful brew. Goes down very easy. Notes of vanilla, mild rum, straw, and lightly spicy finish. A bit warming. Feels and tastes slightly thin for the style. Understated and very British, ie: subtle and balanced, two fine qualities in a brew.. Pleasant wintertime sipper"
"Notes: The head and lacing were both something to admire. The thing that made me really enjoy this beer was it's structure. It is very balanced. Not boring, balanced."
"Clear orange, little to no head. Surprisingly intense aroma. Extremely sweet fruity apricot, pears, and orange hoppiness. This is another fruit blend (had with wachusett winter ale) that seems to work pretty well though this one is a lot hoppier. Wet juicy mango flavor with malt closing to earthy. Generous hoppiness is rather complex, something of a cascade hop, but with more depth. Perhaps a bit cloying at the end, but still pretty enjoyable."
"This one pours an amber color with a small off-white head that doesn't stick around long and doesn't leave much lacing on the glass. The aroma is sweet malts, but the hop presence balances this well. The flavor is of brown sugar and caramel malts, but as in the aroma, it is well balanced and not as sweet as I expected it to be. This has a light mouthfeel and is slightly thin. I'd prefer it to have a thicker body. Drinkability is good."
"This is a good beer! From the deep amber color to the inviting, deep, toasty and mildly fruity aroma, and the complex flavor profile that includes banana, hazelnut, toasted coconut, mocha, and dark chocolate. This is a great cold weather beverage. I like to think of it as a winter session beer as I'm ready for another and am feeling nice and toasty!"
"Nice coppery color-head last the whole way down. Decent carbonation level. OK aroma-very malty. Theres almost a metallic odor,bordering on a high alcohol level but I wouldnt think thats it at only 7%. Very malty flavor. Caramel like. Very slight earthiness to the finish. Decent body. An enjoyable beer. I havnt had this in years. Seemed to improve as it warms a little. I dont know how much Id look to have this again as it has never been a personal favorite. Worth a try though in all honesty."
"The beer pours an amber color with a 1/4"" offwhite head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice malty scent that boasts of pale and crystal malts along with a wonderful hop aroma and warm finish. The taste is good as well. It has a warm malty flavor that is a bit dry and hoppy on the finish. It has a bit of yeast fruitiness. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good winter seasonal. It has excellent flavor and aroma; an awesome drinker."
"Drinkability: Easy. Light and mind blowing complex. I'd be surprised to see how many of these I could have in an evening before the weight (flavorwise, not ABV-wise) got to me. I guess I could have 2 or 3. But, damn. Try it for yourself. It's something which hasn't ever not been not nothing."
"Simply put an amazing beer. I really think this can give sierra nevada pale ale a run for its money. A bit darker and richer, but not as hoppy. Even at 7% alcohol this is a great session beer. Ill have another."
"Deep copper, slightly reddish hues with a small, but persistant light tan head. Nice malty tones dominate the nose. Slighty grainy with mild hops detected. Good malty sweetness, with a dry, grainy finish. Reminds me of a red ale. Flavorful and dry mouthfeel. Not too heavy. Quite nice. Very drinkable. I wish I could make this a regular brew for me, but alas, I have only been able to get 2 bottles. Definately recommended."
"Thanks to SheepNutz for providing me this beer in a trade. It pours a deep amber to slightly deep red in color. The head starts about a finger high, but falls to just ring the top with sparse cover. What a nose. I love malt and I love hops. This give me the best of both worlds. The malt is giving me caramel with a rich toffee, almost buttery tone as well. The hops blend really well into the malt, but I get some citrusy notes from those. Very rich flavor, like a super rich caramel floods my taste buds. There is a fantastic hop bitterness dncing on my tongue after swallowing the beer. Good good and good. The beer is thick, but not as thick as I would have expected. This is a trade-off in my book, as it increases the drinkability. For the full flavor, this beer is very drinkable. Just a good beer."
"A hearty Strong Ale; drinkable for the style at 7% abv. This is not a boring beer given the spectrum of flavors. Very enjoyable."
"I wasn't a big fan of this after my first couple of bottles, but it does seem to ""grow on you"". An acquired taste, in my opinion. The earthy, woodiness takes some getting used to. Overall, there still seems to be something that is slightly, unbalanced with this ale."
"a well-done ale. very english in spirit! not bottle-conditioned, but a very nice strong ale. i recommend this one."
"Drinkability is very good. highly drinkable and enjoyable brew. Thanks to Mikeys01 for the offerring."
"My thanks to kfoss99 for this contribution, now I know what all the fuss is about."
"Geary's. The recycling bin near the cabin is full of your bottles."
"Hampshire Special Ale: from a stubby brown bottle. Pours a reddish brown, perfectly clear. Nice head, off white, that leaves a little covering but not much lace. The aroma is malty, but with an unmistakable whiff of alcohol as well. The taste is very nice, malty and with definite tastes of dried fruits including raisins, prunes. Sweet long lasting aftertaste, with cidery flavors. Fairly highly carbonated. Interesting brew, but the alcohol taste is notable, and would have earned this beer another half star without it."
"This is a very smooth beer, and would warm me up just nice in the winter."
"Can a beer be too balanced? I love balance but the flavors seem to mix here and almost void each other out. I can hardly get anything from the smell of this beer, maybe an alcohol spicyness. I can't really distinct the sweet from the bitter, the malt from the hop here. There's a fruity flavor that is both tart and sweet. Bittersweet caramel and earthy aspects. The finish is very strong in alcohol, esp as I let it warm. But this is an extremely drinkable beer, atleast for a couple. I liked this beer a lot, but it didn't blow my socks off."
"Overall, a solid beer. Thanks to OldFrothingSlosh for the bottle!"
"Poured a golden orange color and topped off with a thin film of a head. The aroma is interesting with fermented apple wine notes, fresh bread and even cherry cider. The taste is rich and complex with bitter musty fruits in the forefront and a semi-sweet dry alcohol finish. Medium and herbal malt body that leaves a candy like spiciness on the tongue. Creamy and pleasantly bitter with a nice tang to boot. A very nice ale. This has a lot to offer."
"I took a gamble on a case of this HSA (as a 2002-2003 the store had it in the discounted out-of-date section). It poured A clear dark orangy gold with a minimal head. The initial aroma was of sharp spices and maple malts. There's also a touch bitter of hops back there somewhere as well. The mouthfeel is luscious--a medium thickness offset by modest carbonation. The taste is reasonably well balanced; there a syrupy cherry and pear sweetness at the start, but it fades quickly as the hops kick in, and the finish is rather tart. The alcohol is more evident in the taste than I expected for a 7% brew; I think it's more potent than reported."
"Thanks to doctorwu100 for the fresh bottles!"
"I'm not a big fan of strong ales, but this one is actually drinkable and enjoyable. Many of them are too solvent-like for my tastes. HSA is complex and tasty; too bad it doesn't have a wider distribution. I'd love to have the opportunity to try it on-tap some day."
"Copper colored with a beige head of bubbles of assorted sizes that settle quickly, but leave a fine layer of foam across the top of the liquid. Complex aroma of malt and spice and apple and pear and cinnamon and butterscotch and cotton candy. The more I sniff, the more I notice in it. Flavor seems to be made up of small parts of malt, hops, banana, and spice, with a definite alcohol finish and lingering bitter. This is a very warming beer with a rich and satisfying flavor."
"i, for one, don't see what all the hype is about here. to preface, this is not a bad brew...at all. far from it, in fact. but what is also is not is the beer to end all beers like i've heard described. it pours a sloid dark amber colour with a moderate head that just doesn't last for very long and leaves almost no lacing. the smell is of butter, toffee, malt, and, along with in the taste, but maybe moreso here in the smell, is a weird rubber tire type presence. it's just a bit off to me and that alone knocks this one out of the '4' catergory for smell and taste. other than that, it is quite nice, with malt and alcohol dominating the flavour with that nagging rubber taste in the back. this is a moderately bold brew that i'd revisit again for sure, but would have trouble having more than 2, maybe 3, in a sitting. overall, i'd recommend trying this one at least once, but i'll stick to my favourite geary's brew (and one of, if not my overall favourite of the new england brews), their standard pale ale any day over this one."
"Medium body, seems much higher in ABV than it really is. This just didn't appeal to me at all."
"This is a good, strong beer, but it would be hard to drink it all night."
"Edit: revisiting this one after being away for 3 years... 7% doesn't knock me quite on my arse anymore. It's an interesting beer... There's some of that Belgian astringency in there... Who'd a thunk it? It's just beautiful - stunning! Bumped drinkability up a lot, appearance (wow! What a beer!) way up. Knocked the flavor down a little for the astringency. Still THRILLED to have scored a half rack! It's been three long years! Man, this is a good beer!"
"Clear amber-copper hue with bronzy-brown influences, the color is fabulous! The head was very small at its apex, it might have reached a 1/4th of a finger in height; it faded quickly to a thin soapy collar. The lacing was absent. The nose had some lovely depth; there was a mix of light citrus juiciness, sweet maltiness, a hint of biscuit, buttery-toffee, a faint note of woody-alcohol. The potency is modest but the bouquet is inviting nevertheless. The palate is down right tasty! The toasty caramel malt really stands out in this offering; it is rich and deep with just enough of a hint of biscuit. When the buttery-toffee notes mixed in, all I can say is, wow! The fruitiness was mild and interwoven perfect, citrus and honey soaked berries. The bite of hops is surprisingly burly, no Im not talking West Coast hoppy but it is nicely aggressive. The persuasion of alcohol is very faint. The palate is well-rounded and tremendously gratifying to quaff. Medium in body, the carbonation is low and natural, mouthfeel is a tickle thin; maybe I am knit picking. HSA is a relaxing beer; it fits comfortably like an old pair of slippers. I see why this beer is so respected, it is very agreeable. If I had this beer available locally I would treasure it like gold, a thank you goes out to Bierman9 for the sample. Recommended."
"12 ounce bottle. A very nice, drinkable, and hoppy brew."
"A little taste of Maine, right here in the Midwest. A big thanks to JohnnyP for the 2 bottles."
"Served from a 12oz bottle. The HSA pours into my glass crystal clear deep amber color, with a light swirling white head of nice tight bubbles. Aroma is very sweet and malty, and also quite fruity, reminiscent of apples and pears fallen from the tree in autumn. Very little hops in the nose. Taste is initially sweet and carmely, with the fruit coming in towards the middle. Finish is surprisingly hoppy and bitter, amazing how well the hops were hidden at first tast. This is a different beer, fairly well balanced but just tipping to the malty side of the scale. Body is on the high side of medium to almost full, this is a good beer for a cold night, but not quite as bold as I expected."
"Pours a clear, deep chestnut color with a thin head. The aroma seems centered around alcohol with caramel and malt. Dry bread crust and nutswalnut and almond? A little floral hop character as well. First taste is malty and, but quickly turns to a sharp hopiness and astringency. Finish is smooth and soft; very nice balance. As you drink it, youd swear that it has more than its stated 7% ABV. However, although its solidly good, nothing about the beer particularly stands out."
"This 12oz bottle of ale poured a clear dark copper color with an inch of head that fizzled out in a couple minutes. Has a very nice hop aroma that is slightly floral and grassy. Chocolate malt coming through in nose also with notes of nice fresh grains. Medium bodied and smooth with a sharp carbonation at the back of the throat. Flavor is balanced between malt blends and hops with a nice English like bitterness in the finish. I also detect some sweetness in the malts. Overall a fine example of an English style, one that could be a very nice session brew. Thanks David (Bierman9) for the sample."
"Very nice winter brew!"
"Yum City. 12 oz into a Nonick pint. The aroma is slightly citrusy, almost like pines. The taste, slightly caramel, reminiscent of better imperial stouts, but with a lighter body and a slightly sour mouthfeel that is almost heavenly. The carbonation is almost ideal. I think I'm going out and getting a sixer of this tomorrow. The beer restocker guy at Whole Foods recommended this, and I later heard about the JohnnyP fan club. Still, I highly recommend this one. Good session beer. Great sour hoppy citrusy taste."
"12 oz bottle courtesy of JohnnyP. Poured a copper/red color with a moderate head that quickly faded leaving a fine lace ring on the glass. Aroma is sweet and malty with a shot of hops. Taste starts off sweet from the malt and then you get that hop twang, and the alcohol warmth. Nicely carbonated. Thanks again JohnnyP for the chance to sample this great brew."
"Clear dark bronze color, really cottony head on a hard pour, settles to 1/4 of an inch in a minute. Wide brimming lace. Bready aroma, slight lemony accents. Medium body and lower carbonation. The flavor strikes me as extremely nutty, almost Brazils and Filberts with the skins on, working with an odd dryish hop flavor. Slightly buttery but I've had worse. Finishes full, somewhat papery, with a light molasses tone. I'd drink it again, especially if they fiddled with the hop bill a little. Thanks to (who else?) JohnnyP for the beer -- its got character, alright... ;>)"
"Hmmm, think I'll go have another..."
"When poured into an imperial pint glass, a slight head forms, which quickly dissipates. The color is a dark and malty, with a slight tinge of red to my untrained eye. A nice aroma, with an obvious alcohol odor in the offing. Taste is nice, with a slight warming present, an indication of the 7% ABV. A benefit of the brew (a nice, unexpected bite of bitterness), can also be it's downfall, knocking it's session-ability down a bit. However, on cask (Great Lost Bear) it was incredible."
"($1.43 / 12 oz.)"
"Enjoy it while the weather sucks!"
"With the whole JohnnyP HSA thing, I thought this beer was going to be overrated, but I was wrong. This is fantastic!!! Thank you to mydeadguy for shipping this beer...if I can find it, this would be a beer I'd have again!!!"
"A well-polished topaz color that lightens on the edge, this beer pours out a heaven of clouds for a head. Soft puffy stain often sticks out. Smells sweet, abundantly fruity, and slightly yeasty. Taste is tart, with flavors of big malts turned funky. Sweet but thin, tasting of lemony licorice, it has an atringent dry tart finish with a roasty burnish. I often feel the warmth of the alcohol, and it doesnt blend in well. Also, the thin mouthfeel is often bubbly and often oily. Not my cup of tea but good for the style."
"Notes: Not my favorite seasonal, but easily drinkable."
"Pours a pretty clear amber copper color, it is topped by a light tan head. There is a nice dry hoppy aroma, evocative of English hops; A bit lemony, slightly grassy. Wow, I was not expecting so much hop flavor to be packed into this beer. It has a balancing malt sweetness a bit of caramel. Quite good, I am duly impressed. The hop flavor is citrusy and floral in character. The beer has a medium body, which is perfect for this beer. This is still an easy drinking beer but has enough body to balance the stellar hop flavor. I certainly wish that I had access to more of this great beer. Overall this is a very well put together beer."
"This is a dark tawny amber brew with hints of red. The aromas are of sweet malts and spicy hops in the background (do they use saaz in this stuff?). This is not overly hopped nor overly spiced, so that makes this stuff a wonderfully easy to drink winter seasonal that still packs a bit of a warming wallop with its 7%abv. Like I said the drinkability is very good and the mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, without being too thick or cloying. I raise my glass to JohnnyP ""This HSA is for you!"". I guess it is nice to have this available year round and cheap up in Maine. Over here, these bottles are rarely seen. I had to beer trade for this one!"
"This stuff tastes lovely, and is incredibly drinkable. The combination of spiciness and hops is, to my palate, just challenging enough. It's not as grandmotherly as Harpoon Winter Warmer, which showers you with wonderful pumpkin pie spices; neither is it a harsh taskmaster such as Sierra Nevada Celebration, which flogs you - in a loving way, mind you - with bitter hops. This stuff walks right down the middle; it's obviously a fantastic session beer."
"Nice color and a nice smell of sweet malt and toasted grain. Has a nice firm carbonation upon first sip. Great flavors that are dominated on the sweet side of butterscotch, toffe, spicy malt and dried fruits. Has a nice alchohol punch to it but by no means is is overpowering. Very rich full texture and a nice hoppy finish that tries to keep up with the malt. Like this one"
"Another impressive brew from Geary's. Crystal clear copper colored with very minimal head. Aroma is bready malt and fruity hops. Apples and caramel with a touch of butterscotch. Very smooth with a buttery, buiscity taste. Toffee and fruit make an appearance as before being rounded out by big oily hops. Mouthfeel may be a bit thinner than I prefer, but I sure didn't want to stop at one. So I didn't. I like strong beers, so this is *almost* like a session beer for me. Good stuff."
"Backwash: The one word (other than delicious) that really fits this beer is Balance! I realized after working my way through a few of these that it reminded me a little bit of Fuller’s 1845. BA calls both Strong/Old Ales and I can’t disagree. Few beers live up to their hype (especially from homestate chauvinists), but I was extremely impressed with this beer. As I lean more toward malty beers, this hits my sweet spot. Goes very well with hearty cheeses. JohnnyP, sign me up for the cult. I drank the Kool-Aid and I’m now an acolyte. Finestkind!"
"Had this on cask at the Great Lost Bear. Pour was slightly cloudy dark copper. The 1/2 inch head lasted till the end of the pint! I found the aroma to be of husky grain. The taste was well-rounded, and the alcohol was easily detected in this one. Very smooth and balanced: not a hop monster. I also noted a slightly nutty aftertaste. Very good, but could get you in trouble if you decided to keep knocking them back. pat"
"Clear copper color with a one inch ivory colored head of smooth, thick fluff that faded super fast to a thick skim and fast dripping lace. Aroma is faint of woodish dryness with touches of leafy dry hops, light caramel, and dulled citrus. Taste is mild and subdued, with lightly sweet roasty/toasty breadish malts, lightly playing hop bitterness lending a bit of leafyness and citrus. Notes of dry wood. Malts build a bit more into the finish with some light chewyness and sweet tang of fruits that are hard to distinguish, pear maybe? Feel is quite smooth and medium bodied with an easy carbonation, finishes a bit crisp with lingering malted sweetness. An OK Old Ale if there ever was one. Thanks to mydeadguy for the bottle through BIF 4.0"
"Geary's HSA is amber in color with little head or lacing. Smell is nothing special. Hops and barley. Taste is not bad, but unbalanced. Again, harsh bitter hops (in a good way), with subtle malty caramel background. Mouthfeel is okay, as is drinkability. I bet this'll get a lot better in a year or two."
"Prost"
"Drinkability: JohnnyP was right. A very nice beer for the holidays. Let it snow! I have some set aside to age and can't wait to see what happens to this beer over time."
"It appears some Maine beers are making there way to Michigan and that is fine by me. A very good beer and one I will grab again throughout the winter."
"Pours out clear & deep gold with little head to speak of. Aroma has some bready burnt malts, and a decent citousy hop scent. This is one of those scents that singes the nosehairs, with some spices in there to boot. Taste is very unique. Starts off with some sweet maltiness and some spice, then a wallop of floral hops hits you, yet finishing off creamy. Good dry aftertaste. This is one of those beers that wants to breakdance in your mouth..alot going on here.. Heavy carbonation makes for a good strong mouthfeel and dry finish. Drinkability is pretty good, in part due to the creaminess of this brew"
"This is a very sweet, full, rich, and ungodly drinkable beer. I put away four of these on a Sunday afternoon before I knew what I was doing. A special ale, certainly, and a new favorite for me."
"I do not know if there is a bigger advocate of one beer than JohnnyP and this one. I thank my lucky stars (and JohnnyP) I had a chance to try it (and cellar one)."
" if this is a winter seasonal, I better buy up all I can, this is one fine beer."
"Huge thanks to marc77 and Bierman9, who both submitted samples! Prost!"
"Bwst beer hands down for me while in Maine,pours a rich golden color with a slight red tint,not much head to it but what there was left some real nice lace.Rich is the word I use to describe this beer in color,aroma,and mostly flavor very malty and whiskyish and of dried fruit for a malt maven or whatever u wanna call it this to me is a perfect or near perfect beer,rich and warming a great winter beer."
"Very tasty and complex. Definitely a beer marching to the beat of it's own drum. A bit rough edged with some strange flavors that don't entirely go well together, but as a whole, it's an enjoyable pint. I can certainly notice the alcohol after a couple of these, and it's a bit palate fatiguing, so I didn't think the drinkability was all that high."
"2001-2002 Edition, given to me by a beer store owner who said that 3 6-packs of this has been sitting on the floor of his store for 2 years. 12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a deep reddish-copper color with one finger of head. There is almost no lacing left on the glass. The smell is slight alcohol and sweet caramel and malt, a fairly full nose. The taste is fairly sweet at first, with little bits of toffee and dates, then finishes with a little hops bitterness and alcohol. The mouthfeel is fairly thick and heavy on the tongue. The drinkability is pretty darn good for a 7% brew. I definately need to go back and pick up the rest of those lonely 6-packs from the beer store floor!"
"Poured a deep amber color with a slighlty thin head. The head slowly receded to the rim of the glass along with some spotty bubbles on the surface. The aroma was sweet, but the alcohol was definitely noticable. The flavor was a great balance of sweetness, spiciness, and bitterness. Very smooth and full bodied. There is a slight malt and alcohol aftertaste. Definitely a tasty ale."
"2002-2003 Fruity/spicy aroma... some nutmeg, apples, all kinds of smells came out. Poured a deep copper with a thick and dense, off white head. Nice visible carbonation. Slight bubblegum note to the nose came out as it warmed. Flavor of sweet fruit with some nice cinnamony spicing coming through. Bitterness was fairly high but fit well with the rest of the beer. After a while aroma and flavor started to remind me of artificial strawberries (think lollipops)."
"Had this for the first time last night. Took a six-pack down to Young's Lobster Pound and drank out of the bottle with a lobster dinner. Damn good out of the bottle and even better tonight out of a proper glass."
"A lovely copper colored ale with a nice but not thick head. An even malty sweet aroma greets you with the first sip and stays throughout the whole glass. The taste is excellently balanced between a gentle maltyness and a smooth hop finish. I'm glad to hear that this is now available year round."
"Praise Be to Preacher Sir JohnnyP for sending some of it to the West Coast."
"Very quaffable for such a high ABV. Is it the holy grail of strong ales? Not in my book, but it's pretty darn good."
"Note: I tried this off the shelf in August 2003...As it is a seasonal brew, I have to add that it certainly held its character beyond the March date mentioned on the brewer's website. By the way, there was no date on my bottle."
"Magic in a glass !"
"Rich barley sweetness at the start, yet quite soft and approachable. Some nice delicate spicyness, with a touch of caramel and toffee, quite a hoppy, bitter-ish finish, quite alright, this was the last of the night, perhaps it didn't benefit as much as it could have because of this very reason, still a nice tasty strong ale."
"A very violent pour is the only way to get a lasting head on this puppy. The buttery flavors of the ringwood are strongly dominant and a little bit goes a long way. Malts and hops are diminished because of it. There are some interesting fruity undercurrents, some intriguing spiciness which I think is derived from the alcohol, and the malts (if you can discern them buried underneath all the butterscotch) are sturdy, salty and delicious. I would love a bit more crispness from a more forceful hop presence. Other reviewers have mentioned a fair amount of hoppiness, but I'm not getting any of it. The sweetness and butteriness of this beer gets cloying, especially as it warms; I preferred it at a cold right-out-of-the-fridge temperature, unusual for this style of beer. This is not a bad beer but I think it is overrated. That said, it does grow on you and each bottle tastes better than the last. Perhaps a fresher bottle, or a cask-conditioned pint, or even a more wintery setting would enlighten me as to why this beer basks in universal acclaim."
"Pours a nice amber color....Nose is very inviting....a bit of whiskey...some bing cherries...and even some leather and mustiness...body is thick and firm but easy drinking....about perfect...feels good in the mouth, like it was meant for me to drink a six-pack of this tonight (although I only have one which is a probably a good thing)...A verynice flavor to match the nose although slightly weaker than the nose.....same elements...sweet fruit/whiskey/leather...finsihes with a nice twang of hops that throws this malty badass into balance.....a very enjoyable beer...one of the more drinkable barley wines I've had...A guy could get in trouble with this....a lot of character with this beer, but a high drinkability as well....thanks to Bierman9 for providing this memorable beer.."
"This strong ale poured a clear, iced-tea brown color with creamy, off-white foam that was persistent. The carbonation was lively. The smell was citrusy floral hops and sweet malt (very nice). The taste was sweet caramel malt and strong floral hops with a little biscuit thrown in. The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy and hoppy with medium body. Very nice balance. The drinkability was very good. This was a very tasty ale that left me wanting more."
"2002 - 2003 edition. Garnet hue with a light chill haze. Almond white, thin, but well retained head leaves loose lace. Mellow, strawberry like esters with a tinge of fig along with smooth, medium lovibond caramel and sweet biscuit. Damply floral, lightly perfumed hop nose. Trace butterscotch and bubblegum esters arise with a swirl. Deeply toasty, borderline tannic, amber - like malt sweetness is perceived at first in flavor, then is ensued by notes of burnt caramel and dry, roasted, sugared pecans. Subdued fruitiness of a berryish, red licorice nature emerges mid palate along with mild diacetyl, lending an odd, yet agreeable buttered and candied fruit impression. A touch shy in residual dextrins and / or over attenuated. Passably smooth in mouthfeel, but no more. Earthy, humus like hop flavor. Finishes with a lingering, cleanly bittersweet toffee and hop bitterness combination. A flavorful, well rounded strong ale, with a pronounced biscuit presence. The slight astringent note upfront prevents Hampshire S.A. from reaching its full potential. Tasty, but not outstanding. The relative high strength goes nearly unnoticed, and aids in the brew's fine dinrkability. Thanks to Mainebeerman for the sample."
"This beer poured into the glass an amber/cedar wood/ruby color that was clear. The head was thick and creamy, the color that was produced was a French vanilla crème that was fairly sticky and left a sticky lace behind. The aromas that came from the glass were of malts, sweet fruits (berries, slight oranges), caramel, light flowers and I also noticed a very, very, very slight metallic hint at the end, not horrible just there. The flavors that came from the beer were of dark fruits, (berries, plums, and some raisins) caramel, hops, sweet malt, flowers, and a creamy sensation like you get from butter. This beer was surprisingly complex, when the first pour and sip was taken I thought it was fairly simple, but the more I poured and tasted the flavors seemed to arise and become more complex. A good beer, it surprised me from top to bottom of bottle, very well balanced."
"2002-2003. A clear, copper colored body is capped by a thin but creamy off-white head that holds quite well but leaves little lace. The nose displays a lightly buttery caramel malt; some nice fruitiness (berries, citrus peel), and a touch of hops (Fuggles?). It's medium bodied with a fine, median carbonation that caresses the tongue - very nice! A rich maltiness that seems to derive from the Maris Otter varity dominates the flavor. It's caramelish with a mild touch of butter; fruity with light notes of orange, green raisins, plums, and cherry; and a touch of licorice that's probably created through a combination of sweetish malt and a somewhat minty hop flavor. It's rich malt is balanced by a bold bitterness; and it lays on the tongue in a long finish with malt, hops and fruit all making an appearance. Nicely complex!"
"This is a winter seasonal - Must Try! Deep golden bronze/amber with a tint of red. Very complex dry robust malt with a trace of sweetness. Powerfully hopped, then dry hopped for good measure. The maltiness rolls forward throughout the glass and begins to reveals a trace of berries and some smoothness. An unusual, but nice pine essence is long lasting. The alcohol is noticed, though not overly so. The creamy beige head lingers and nice lace is formed. As with all of D.L. Gearys brews, there sort of a raw wildness, like Maine itself. Its easy to picture a Norman Rockwell Maine coast pub scene in winter where the cheerful patrons are toasting one another with a frosty mug of Hampshire Special. Now that really warms the heart! BTW  Hampshire Special pairs really well with hearty stews. Try braising a roast with this ale in place of Burgundy wine."
"Pours a dark amber, closer to copper in color, medium white head, slowly receeds to leave medium lace. Aroma is strong on the malts, some biscuit, lots of butterscotch, and some caramel. Flavor is strong on the butterscotch, slight hints of alcohol towards the end as it warms, and finishes with a slight hoppiness that balances everything out quite well. Very thick and strong body."
"Once again Dave has outdone himself. IMHO this is what Maine beer is all about."
"2002-03 version. Pours a beautiful ruby red color with a nicely sized head. Smells engaging, not quite sure what's to come. Hhhmm, this is a great conducted brew. There is a marvelous cherry wood flavor that tastes so good on a cold winter's day. As the mouthfeel progresses, you get some very pleasant spritzes of candy coated hops. A well made beer that is tasty to the max!"
"2002-2003 edition. Drank on 3/7/03. The beer was an almond/orange color in the glass with a lumpy 3/4 inch high head. Smell was wonderful with some floral notes and malty nose present. Sip gives a hint of caramel with a some hoppiness hidining the background that is present after holding in the mouth. At different times I thought I tasted some nutty flavor or some pepper. The high alcohol is sneaky but a warming sensation is noticeable after a while. I just got a six pack and am thinking of cellaring a few but there really isn't an edge to pull of this one. It is pretty drinkable as is."
"Aged a year, but not as good as I remember, alas."
"Had this on tap at Redbones. Poured with 1/2 inch frothy head. Deep reddish amber in color. Enticing aroma with hints of caramel. Pleasant mouth feel. Strong caramel/toffee flavors are most apparent, the hops take a back seat in this brew. Slightly sweet, but not cloyingly so. Not bad, but I think there are many more flavorful barleywines to be had. The alchohol was notably present in the taste."
"This ale poured a red-brown with a small creamy white head. The nose is full of malty sweetness featuring caramel and molasses. The taste was much milder than many of the strong ales I have had and only a bit of barley-wine sweetness showed through. As soon as I thought the sweetness might be too much, the hops kicked in and balanced the whole thing out. While I wasn't overly impressed by HSA, I would recommend it as a good winter ale."
"Still not too sure what to make of this one. Had it at Redbones on tap. Pours a deep copper color. Does not really taste like an ale but does have a pretty intense alcohol. Ithad a taste that I just could not put my finger on...a taste that I was not too thrilled about. Definitely got better as I kept drinking it. Heavy malt and caramel flavor. Burned caramel?? Maybe that was the taste."
"Nice oranges hew with a small eggshell colored head. Geary's Special Ale has a malty bouquet and nose and a slightly alcoholic finish. A strong 7.0% abv but it tastes even stronger. It has a soft mouth feel and leaves a tingling sensation on the tough. Not a bad drink, better than most, however, it is not my first choice of barley wines or strong winter ales."
"I have only had their summer ale so I did not know what to expect from this beer, but I must admit that I was pleasantly surprised with it. The smooth pour revealed a beautiful, dark, amber hue that had a thin, white, styrofoamy head that clung to the side of my glass all the way down. The smell was very arousing with scents of a sweet caramel balanced with a salty, teriyaki like smell. The taste was very dry with deep full bodied taste. Very good winter brew!"
"2002-2003 Edition. Clear bright bronze in color with a perfectly sized head for a pint glass. The aroma of maple and butterscotch misled me into thinking it would taste sweeter. Starts with a sweet bread taste then a hint of hazelnut and caramel hold for awhile until it balances out with a dry bitterness. It leaves no lace and carbonation is light but has a great mouthfeel. I think i had this from cask at the GLB after the Maine Brewers Fest but my memory of that night is foggy at best. I loved it then and still think it's a kick ass winter from the bottle."
"2002-2003 Bottling. Clear amber pour forms a rocky beige head which quickly thins. Moderate-well carbonation. Aroma is of spicy hops, crystal malt, clean american ale yeast, and a subtle peppery bite. Initial taste is of spicy hops, then makes way to a firm, but not overly malty sweetness, some very noticeable alcohol kick (not really annoying, however), and ending in a long bittersweet hop finish. Firm body with alot of carbonation that erupts on the tongue. The malt continues to hang in there for the finish, balancing with the spicy hop finale. No noticeable oxidation or diacetyl, fusel flavors. Think Sammy Boston Lager X 2...while good, it doesn't really do anything to excite me, and probably nothing I would seek out. Clean profile and well-done balancing act contribute to it's good drinkability despite it's modest ABV."
"Nice brown/bronze color. Not much head, but the beer maintained an impressive sheeting of tiny carbonation bubbles up the sides of the glass throughout. Malty with a touch of honeysuckle blossom honey. Solid bittering drops in at the finish, with a lingering, thickness at the back of the tongue. Very tasty, and thanks to Cooper for the Christmas trade."
"Poured a fast dissolving white foamy head that left a few traces of lace up my glass.The color was of a dark amber and copper.It offered a distinctive smell ranging from that of maple syrup to cherries.It has a full body and is somewhat thick and very malty.It has a barley-wine kind of taste to it.A truly different taste with flavors of banana,cherry,prunes,maple syrup,and a finish that tastes almost metallic like copper or iron.Goes done smooth with alot of flavor on the finish but leaves a dry feeling in the mouth,not very refreshing.A wheaty aftertaste is noted with a touch of bitter hops.At 7.0% it is very strong,but no real alcohol taste is present.Indulge in moderation with this one!"
"This is an interesting old ale. Nice color with a thick head on the pour. The aroma is of malt and hints of nuttiness. The initial flavor is quite smooth with a push of malt. The malt grows through into a nice deep bitterness that lingers through the finish. There is a hint of nut-brown at the very end. All supported by a smooth body."
"The beer pours a cloudless amber color with the head impressive in size, frothy in texture and the color an off-white, the left over lace thick and clinging. The hop floral tones quite pronounced, along with the customary malt and sweet caramel. Begins quite sweet and the top middle of the road mouth feel wise, finish is has a monster hop bite and the carbonation pleasant, dry as a bone aftertaste, quite ""Quaffable""."
"Beautiful copper red body, with fine rising carbonation, capped by a rapidly decaying oatmeal head which quickly becomes a very thin topper. Opening the bottle, I was hit by a burst of fresh bread aroma. Then some caramel. Taste is rich and deep, malt sweetness at the center and hop notes tingling around the edges. The ads always say ""Available when the weather sucks"". Today the weather sucked, and this beer is""melting"" away the traffic, the closings, and the shoveling. A great winter seasonal, perfect for sipping by the fire."
"01-02 bottling. This hazy, deep amber/pale copper colored ale pours with a thin off-white head. The beer leaves a mild lacing on the glass as you drink it. The aroma is sweet, with a touch of spice. The taste is impressive, with sweet malt, orange, honey, and spice all wrapped up in one. It is very complex, with a lot going on in every sip. The hops are present in the taste, but are not the first flavor one notices. The mouthfeel is solid, with a nice bitterness on the finish. Fine carbonation is noticable on the tongue. With the moderate ABV, this is definitely a drinkable winter ale."
"Pours amber in color with little to no head. The smell is all malt. Mellow and malty in taste with a nice warming as it goes down. I remember having this on tap when I was in college. I loved it then and I love it now. Others have mentioned things like fruity & watery but I don't get that at all. Please do try as this is worth every penny."
"This is the 2002-2003 offering. Deep amber coloring with a frothy off-white head. Malty, toasty, fruity aromas. Medium body, medium carbonation. Sweet flavors are the main storyline, with caramel and ripe dark fruit evident. There's an earthy hop presence that lends some balance, but this is a malty brew, and a big, warming one at that. Bit of a metallic twang in the finish. Nice for sipping on a cold night."
" Cheers!"
"I had heard good things about this beer, and I am not disappointed! It's a gorgeous beer, deep copper, with a creamy slight tan head. Smell is malty, caramel and molasses, with a touch of mild, floral hoppiness. The maltiness really comes through in the taste, again creamy, caramel, molasses, nice and smooth. Finishes with a mild hop twang, and a slight bitterness at the back of the tongue. Gentle spicy alcohol notes as well. Very, very nice."
"They still sell it in Shaw's (local supermarket)!! I picked it up last night and brought it home. Cracked one while cooking dinner. Nice white head. I tasted those great hops with the first sip. Then the bitterness. This is the best seasonal beer. I anticipate ""when the weather sucks"" so I can drink it. I have been known to hold on to six packs of this into August."
"Nice dark ale, not hop dominated, but good hop bitterness, nice malt flavor, hints of caramel.  A very solid beer, with a good deal of alcohol.  It is very drinkable.  My local store has been selling me six packs since last winter, I must be the only one in town who is enjoying this stuff. A great beer."
"This beer is still one of my favorites and I wish David Geary would make it available year round."
"This beer celebrates everything I personally dislike in Northeastern beer:  the Ringwood yeast strain.  Deep amber color.  Nose is fresh hop, diacetyl, and sweet malt mixed deep within.  Mix of sweet english malt and ringwood yeast flavor/diacetyl, buttery overtones.  Slightly earthy mix of hops and yeast.  Very well-constructed and a solid rating even if I don't personally enjoy it."
"118"
"Clear amber liquid with nice head following a vigorous pour. Toasted caramel and semi-sweet bready aroma. Caramel and toasted malt predominate the flavor with a touch of grapefruity hop. Alcohol warms the belly nicely. Delicious."
"Pours a nice dark amber/copper with a thinnish bubbly tan head that dissipates.  Great malty alcohol smell.  Nice caramel maltiness and some decent balancing hop bitterness.  Good slighlty creamy mouthfeel and very drinkable for the style.  I've had this on draught and in the bottle, definitely much better on draught.  Aging a bottle of this might be interesting."
"A balanced beer to say the least, with both a distinct malty and hoppy flavour. Very smooth, very drinkable and very alcoholic on the breath. Can't really go wrong with a beer like this, unless you can't handle a RIngwood beer -- but it's well-blended into the mix. One of my favourites and one of Geary's best beers IMO -- ""special"" indeed."
"This is a disappointment - love the ads - brewed only while the weather sucks, or something like that.  There are much better winter beers.  Just not what I expected."
"Notes: Year after year this one is a sure thing for winter seasonals, bitterness seems a step up this year which is fine considering all of the malt flavour to deal with."
"This is as close to a session beer as you can get at 7% abv.  Its a really nice feeling beer on the palate, and the toasty biscuit flavor is delicious.  I didn't like the minerally, hard water flavors though (you can actually smell this too), and I think the hops could be more up front.  Still a very good winter brew."
"WOW, this guy does a few beers and does them well. This is the showcase beer for this brewery. A strong ale that gives off malt and hop aromas rather than booze fumes. Mouthfeel is perfect in my opinion. Too often these types of ales are sticky or too heavily bodied. Highly recommended."
