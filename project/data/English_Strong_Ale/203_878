Really smooth overall and highly drinkable but a bit too restrained on the hop character even for an English IPA. Malt character is also a bit one dimensional and dull, but not bad and the balance is just right. Definitely some diacetyl in there. Finish dries out nicely with bit of a bite, has a touch of iron which isn't ideal but also has a nice, lightly fruity (citrus/berry) edge to beady malts that’s very pleasant.

It's easy to argue against it, as the beer is clearly not in the state that the brewer intended, but it's also true that these bottles represent the state of the beer "in the wild," as it were. They brew the beer with significant hops, bottle it in clear bottles, and ship it halfway around the world -- to say that the condition of the beer is less than it would be straight out of the fermenter is to belabor the obvious. This bottle being a freebie from the vendor only makes this claim more specific, as the distributor clearly intended for this to be a sample bottle showcasing the beer's strengths.

Let it sit out and warm a bit and the odd scent intensifies (in a very good way). Calm and lightly malty at first, this hen pecks you immediately as the beer hits the back of you mouth. I'm having trouble finding descriptive words here but it's yeasty with a good dose of sour fruitiness. Sour is prevelent in my head but that doesn't seem quite right.

That caramel-malt character sticks around in the aftertaste, making me crave more. Unfortunately it's got just a hint of skunk in the aftertaste too. On the lighter side of medium-bodied with ample carbonation. Pretty drinkable and refreshing. If it didn't have a little of that 'long voyage overseas' flavor to it, it'd be better.

Nonexistent carbonation in the body but when tasting the brew the beer attacks the tongue with force. Strong alcoholic taste masks the malty, molasses flavor. In fact, the alcohol seems to take the flavor hostage threatening to kill it and I believe by the end of the bottle it goes through with the threat. This beer must be from the English pirating days when rum ran out on ship and they needed something else to suffice. The aftertaste is very strong and adamant about staying in the palate as long as possible. By the end of the drink your mouth fills up with a decaying, spunky flavor reminiscent of whiskey shots.

Therefore, the scent was very sour, like soy sauce and limestone, with undertones of wheat, cultured yeast, and caramel malt. It tasted mostly acidic and chalky like vitamin C, although there was noticeable earthy and caramel malts with copper hops. It was watery with some carbonation and a slightly bitter aftertaste.

The liquid is clear copper, more golden along the glass's edges. A great sniff brings the aroma of fresh white country bread (compared and verified this morning, even the leftover, unwashed empty bottle retains this marvelous odor), and earthy yeast. Pouring in the yeast increases the aforementioned earthiness, and adds a bit of citrus to the nose, as well. On my first sip, I'm amazed. It's just like eating a warm loaf of bread, perhaps with a bit of marmalade to provide the citrus burst. The bread analogy ends, but the beer does not. It progresses to a spreading, dry bitter finish. In the mouth, it is unexpectedly thick, very low in carbonation, and wildly warming. This is a fiendishly strong bitter, quite complex, and yet easy to savor on all of its levels. The crafty deception of its abv only increases my joy.

There is something about the smell and taste that just reminds me of a brewery. That sounds pretty generic, but it's hard for me to put my finger on as well.

However, ive had much better head retention with this brew before. Smelt really good, malty scents mixing with fruit (apple was very apparant) and strong yeast smell to round it off. The taste had a lot going on, a little malt sweetness, some apple taste, almost spicy hops and yeast. The mouthfeel is nice as well, its fairly carbonated, nothing that hampers the enjoyment of one or two, but i definitely wouldnt want put down a number of these in one night.

Kind of weak in the hop flavor department this brew leaves a little to be desired overall but the yeast flavors seem to be the only point of realt intreset as the fruityiness really comes out due to the lack of other flavors to compete.

4.08,18.3,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"Its slightly hazy (bottle-conditioned) copper body displays bronze and ruby highlights beneath a short, creamy head of off-white foam that drops readily but holds a thin cap throughout the pint. The nose displays and iron/mineral character, some delicate apple-ish fruit, and some leafy hops over a caramelish malt. The body is full, creamy and smooth in the mouth with a very fine, natural carbonation that just lightly caresses the tongue (similar to a cask-conditioned pint!). The flavor delivers a biscuit-like maltiness, some lightly-dry and apple/pear-ish fruitiness, a distinct note of diacetyl, and a subtle touch of blood-like iron all backed by a solid bitterness and some leafy, tea-like hop flavor. It finishes dry with a lingering character from almost all of its attributes except for its slightly elevated alcohol which seems to remain hidden at all times. Quite nice!","NeroFiddled","Nov 20, 2003"

4.05,17.4,4,4,4.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a clear brown/orange color. I couldn't put my finger on the aroma exactly, Mild hoppiness and alcohol. The aroma instantly made me curious of this beers flavor. It has a good head that stuck around for at least half the journey. Unique flavor. It has a bitterness to it that makes it very original. There are some fruity esters. Semi-sweet at first. good mouthfeel. This is an excellent ale and it is very unique. I'd love to learn how to replicate this ale at home.","Brian700","Oct 25, 2003"
2.23,-35.4,3,2.5,2,2.5,2,"Poured a pale orange color with a large, fast dying head that leaves some lacing on the glass. The aroma was pretty plain with some alcohol notes budding in from time to time. The flavor of this reminded me too much of a malt liquor such as Colt45. Maybe I just got a bad bottle, but I really didn't enjoy this brew very much.","clvand0","Sep 29, 2003"
3.53,2.3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Poured very nicely with an orange hue and a rich head that disapated quickly. Aroma is dominated by malt with a backgound note of noble hops. Taste is rather sweet but not unexpectedly so, especially after the malty aroma. Hopping is light, almost like a Scotch Ale. Mouthfeel is very smooth and silky. Taste is initially dominated by the malt with hints of carmel, but has a bit of a bitter lingering aftertaste. I detect no off or sour notes. As a bottle conditioned beer I find it pleasing and well worth the money, but that said, it is a bit too malty for my tastes, so I would hesitate to enjoy it regularly.","bobes","Aug 16, 2003"
2.99,-13.3,4,2.5,3,3.5,3,"An orangish color somewhere between apricot and copper. Hazy with active carbonation that feeds a substantial and lasting head with moderate cling. Smell is pretty strong but also pretty disappointing. Faint grain and alcohol scents are overwhelmed by a smell that is perhaps best described as sour. That sourness carries over to the finish which is both dry and sour. That's not wholly unappealing, mind you, as it cleans up the mouthfeel. Grains and citrusy flavors at the front and then a strangely metallic taste that also coats the lips. This one's unique--no doubt--but that's not entirely a good thing.","BitteBier","Aug 13, 2003"
3.58,3.8,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Pours out a pale orange color with an appropriate sized head for an English ale. Chunks of yeast floating around the glass, and there was still a lot on the bottom of the bottle. Aroma of yeast and alcohol, not much else. Taste shows me more yeast than I thought there would be and it was a little off tasting but improved the more I drank it. Pale malts were apparent with some citrusy hops that layed low. Improved as it warmed.","granger10","Aug 08, 2003"
3.26,-5.5,4,3,3.5,3,3,"Very much a live beer in the British tradition. Pours with a massive creamy head. Nothing of exceptional note in the nose. The taste was a basic pale malt with a dose of yeast. Hens tooth is not the greatest ale I have ever tasted (I would have liked a bit more of a fruity aroma and taste) but its not the worst. My bottle was certainly fresh ( I have managed to culture the yeast) and the beer was very drinkable but there are better beers out there.","ALEBOY","Jul 26, 2003"
3.98,15.4,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"This is a bottle-conditioned ale that used go by the style name "Traditional Ale". A billowy beige rests upon a dark amber body. An aroma of malt, yeast, hops and alcohol lasts for an unusually long time. Lots of grainy malt and flavorful fruit, citrusy and tea flavors, separate at first, balances and blends as it warms. A somewhat astringent bitterness lingers throughout, as does the increasingly noticeable alcohol kick. All in all a very unique and multi-faceted brew.","BeerResearcher","Jul 17, 2003"
3.05,-11.6,5,2.5,3,3.5,3,"Smell was pretty funky but not very strong. Was mostly some farmy scents, some sweet smell of a presence, but in all pretty bad funk. Taste was a big bitter and a great roasted flavor. Tasted equally of malt, hops, and actual toast, but then came some acidic twang. The whole taste took a bit to get used to. in sum, this beer is pretty aggressive with twangs and thangs from all types of directions. An experiment gone wrong?","nomad","Jun 04, 2003"
4.23,22.6,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Pours an amber brown with a thick, creamy head that last through-out the beer. Watch out for overflow, this beer develops a head quickly and easily. The nose screems hops and alfalpha. The taste is creamy, sweet malt, and hops. Just bitter enough for taste and substance. The finish is smooth and creamy. Great beer.","Loki","Apr 24, 2003"
3.67,6.4,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"This beer pours a clear medium orange/brown color with a large creamy light tan head. The mouthfeel is soft and rounded. The smell is nice pleasing breadlike with tealike accents. The tase is of tea with mild peppery alcohol and a malty/cedary finish. I found this to be a pleasing mild tasting ale-pretty mild considering it's designation as a barleywine.","fattyre","Apr 01, 2003"
4,15.9,4,4,4,4,4,"Bottle conditioned, clear, thin-necked full pint bottle with a tag expressing the conditioning aging process. Color was orangey dark brown with a thick head about two fingers high. Smells of the mighty yeast much like its counterpart Old Speckled Hen. A bit stronger aroma, very bitter and dry floral hopiness, has some caramel and malt tones with some bread like notes. Taste is much of the same, caramel and malt flavors with a good floral hop kick thats balanced quite well. Slightly smooth, butterscotch and bread grain notes with a dry hop finish. This is some pretty decent stuff. Very strong at first, a bit " in your face" with its hop kick, but the malt helps keep it in check. Sip it and have it chilled slightly and let settle. It takes a bit of getting use to. Took me awhile to finish it. Didn't help that it was a full pint of the stuff.","tavernjef","Mar 23, 2003"
3.95,14.5,4,4,4,3.5,4,"The taste had a slight bitterness to it but was covered by the honey. I liked this beer. I wouldn't consider it a barley wine (not even close) but overall I would drink this again. I had this with my favorite fish-n-chips so it accompanied it well.","Ahhdball","Mar 01, 2003"
2.44,-29.3,3.5,2,2.5,3.5,2,"Murky copper color and giant creamy carbonation of over an inch in height. Laces in thick glue-like sheets. Some floral hops in the aroma, LOTS of skunkiness with maybe some weasel musk added for good measure. Medium buttery diacetyl flavors abound here, possibly the beer's best characteristic, some sense of mown grass and nutmeg as well. Hops are harsh and extremely un subtle at the close, drying the beer harshly. I don't know -- this bottle was picked out of some just put in the fridge at Thomas Liquors, but alas there's a big sense of oxidation, yeast gone out of control, and light-striking skunkiness here. I'll re-rate some day...","ADR","Feb 21, 2003"
3.16,-8.4,4,3,3,3,3.5,"It poured a nice amber color, but the head was totally missing. It barely had any aroma. Tasted rather bland. Bad carbonation, bordering on none.

3.88,12.5,4,3.5,4,4,4,"I've reviewed Old Speckled Hen, Tanner's Jack and this one together (all tapped on clear glass bottles). They all have similar characteristics and appear to have been brewed with the same kind of malts and hops. Hen's Tooth comes out as the winner with the most pronounced flavor and character. I might have to revise that statement when I review a fresher version of Old Speckled. It looks like I got luckier than other reviewers and got a fresh bottle.","zakery","Oct 04, 2002"
2.84,-17.7,3,1.5,3.5,3,3,"It has been a while since I'd had a Hen's Tooth. This bottle was an overcarbonated "conditioned" bottle and gushed when poured gently. Initial aroma was nasty; musty and metalic - like something gone bad. Great head retnetion and cling, cream colored and dense over the copper ale. I liked the flavor and found it meduim bodied with some caramelized malt and fruity notes and a solid hop presence throughout. The aroma improved as it warmed to a citrusy/ marmalade like scent that, minus the musty smell which lingered, reminded me of Fuller ESB. Strong hop aftertaste - (very British) and a slight alcohol warm. I think I caught this bottle just before it went south. Good to see a reasonably strong Ale (6.5%) from the UK. I recommend refridgeration to stall fermentation.","Shiredave","Sep 08, 2002"

2.78,-19.4,3,2.5,3,3,2.5,"Mmm...curious brew here. HUGE carbonation, I could barely pour this stuff without ending up with four parts foam and one part beer.

I don't think I'd go back to this one.","John","Apr 08, 2002"
3,-13,3,3,3,3,3,"No shortage of carbonation here.  One of those bottle conditioned beers where you have to belch after every drink to make room for the next.  Caramel malt was the forefront flavor, and I didn't get much hops working in this beer.  Maybe this was too understated for me to appreciate, but this beer didn't do much to hold my interest.","Brent","Nov 15, 2001"
