4.08,7.4,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"I would say that Old Monkeyshine has a medium-light body with light carbonation that aids the Kent Golding hops in creating a mild spiciness throughout the drink. The hops really shine more in the mouth than under the nose, but they mix really well with the strong roasted malts and caramel, neither overpowering nor lingering in the depths. The best thing about this brew is that although it holds a hefty 8.2% AVB in a 12oz bottle, the only time the alcohol is noticeable is when your head becomes airy and delicately fuzzy halfway through. There is no trace of alcohol in the aroma, and the roasted malts do a fantastic job of keeping the taste out.","Lucklys","Jul 22, 2010"

It poured a deep teak brown with a hint of red. It smelled like light vanilla, light roast and a bit caramel-y. It tasted light at first, then a nice roasted malt with bourbon notes come in and leave a little burn. Medium carbonation. Very drinkable. I was looking on their website and apparently they have a bourbon barrel aged version of this, at least at the brewery. I wish we had made it out to the Brewery as our visit to the Barrio Brewing Co seemed a bit wasted.","femALEist","Sep 09, 2009"
3.92,3.2,3,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,"Overall: I really like this style because it is nearly but not quite many other styles. Almost like a ""jack of all trades but master of none"" for old/strong ales. This example is a good one, and worth trying to you can get a bottle.","allforbetterbeer","Sep 03, 2009"
3.46,-8.9,4,3,3.5,4,3.5,"Poured mahogany with a two finger, very frothy head. Lively carbonation emanates from the body of the beer. Nose faintly picks up melted caramel and cinnamon oatmeal which disappoints only in that I would love to have had these two aromas violently collide against my senses. Hops are in the background, again faint to the nose. Raisins, cherries are dominate the taste which is accompanies the malt and finishes with a delicate touch of hops that disguises the alcohol well. What I notice is that the aftertaste is mainly caramel, which doesn't please me that much since I don't find that flavor to work well with the initial raisin/cherry taste. That said, it is a pleasure to have this after a very long day because the malt/hop balance along with the interesting flavors makes this ale symbiotically dance across my palate. Having one or two max would be a pleasure on any random weeknight; any more would be a bit risky due to the ABV. Thanks goes out again to bennetj17 for the hookup...","Arsenal04","Jun 13, 2009"

3.95,3.9,4,4,4,3.5,4,"12 oz stubbie. The beer is a deep and sinister amber color with a 2-finger ivory head that sits nicely as a finger of foam over after settling. Clarity is good and there are nice fine bubbles cascading up the sides of my glass. The aroma is rife with raisin malt, moderate caramel sweetness, and a healthy smokey phenolic character that I wasn't expecting. Its not bad at all, just was a shock. The flavor is spot on to the aroma, hitting with raisin and smoke initially, moving to a more rounded caramel sweetness, ladened with peppery hop that may have been more brilliant when this was closer to the bottling date. The finish moves back to a caramel-soaked rainsin and a mild bitter bite. There is a touch of orangey sweetness throughout as well. Mouthfeel is thick with a very mild carbonation, with a fairly strong drying quality on the finish. Overall, I am enjoying this one. I'm just starting to feel a little warmth in my stomach after making my way through most of the bottle. I think the phenols add a nice touch to it.","kmpitz2","Apr 11, 2007"
3.88,2.1,4,3.5,4,4,4,"The color was a medium dark brown when poured, with tan foam and lots of lace. The smell of Tobacco was evident in the aroma, with a hint of bittersweet chocolate. But after the first sip, I got a tart Tobacco/Chocolate flavor with just a hint of roasted malts. I think the Tobacco was the main stand out on this brown ale. I never tasted a brown ale with this kind of flavor at all!","BeerManDan","Mar 10, 2007"

3.66,-3.7,4.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,3.5,"A little overly sweet, but enjoyable. Kinda what you'd expect from a southern style brown ale hovering around 8%. I don't think I could drink more than one in a sitting, just because it gets a little tiresome towards the end.","UnionMade","Jan 31, 2007"
4,5.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Mouthfee/Drinkability; mouthfeel is a bit fuller thatn I'm used to for a brown, but it seems to fit this flaover profile just right, and the drinkability is pretty darn good. The only thing than would keep this from be a good session beer, for me, is the alcohol.","RedHaze","Beers"
2.92,-23.2,3,3.5,2.5,3,3,"Notes: Astringent at times. Tobacco and slightly oxidized. I didn't particularly like its lack of focus as it jumps from taste to taste and when it tries to meld together it doesn't work well. OK.","DogFood11","0"

4,5.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a nice dark brown color, nice carbonation, nice little creamy tan head which does not last long, some islands and sticky lacing remained. The nose is malty, roasty, and some caramel going on in there. The taste is very nice of slight roasted malts and a nice bitter dry hop finish. Alcohol is hidden very well. Medium body. Very drinkable, the best Nimbus by far for me. A nice surprise.","Wasatch","Nov 21, 2006"
4.65,22.4,4,4,5,4.5,5,"This beer has morphed quite a bit over the last year and I find that most of the changes are positive ones.

3.63,-4.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Mouthfeel is a bit thin but carbonation levels seem to be good. Pretty easy to drink, much more so than my previous try at this brewery. Alcohol is well hidden, basically nonexistant. I could have a couple of these in a night easily.","blitz134","Sep 28, 2006"

4,5.3,4,4,4,4,4,"This is the last of the Nimbus beers I was sent and I have to say this is a damn nice brewery and I have enjoyed the hell out of these Nimbus beers. Malty, spicy aroma with hints of tobacco, caramel and bread pudding. Deep brown with a small head, but ample lacing. Sweet caramel malt and brown sugar flavors with a hint of spice and a plesant thick breadiness. Very nicely done beer from a brewery worthy of more notice.","Jredner","Apr 23, 2006"
4.8,26.3,5,5,5,5,4,"Pours a beautiful dark brown with a tan/khaki color head that foams very nicely and leaves nice lace. Good head retention, just to my liking. Smell is slightly sweet and bitter at the same time, gives a good indication of the taste. The taste is excellently balanced. A perfect mix of malt sweetness and bitter aftertaste. Feels exceptionally smooth in your mouth with nice bitterness to balance it out. I love this beer, it is definately my favorite beer. The only problem I have with this beer is the fact that it is 8.2% ABV so you have to be careful with how much you drink, it catches up with you. This beer is definately worth a try, my favorite beer I have tried so far.","uabigdaz","Apr 21, 2006"
3.88,2.1,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Notes: Drinkability is much higher than I expected from the aroma. This seems highly sessionable for an 8% beer. Not unbelievably outstanding or anything, but definitely worth your time!","beerinator","Jan 19, 2006"

3.52,-7.4,3.5,4,3.5,2.5,3.5,"Bottle: Poured a dark brown color ale with a medium dark brown foamy head with pretty god retention. Aroma contains lots of sweet roasted malt and toffee. The sweet roasted malt also dominates taste with a light hop presence at the end. Body is a bit too thin for my liking but alcohol is well hidden.","Phyl21ca","Jul 02, 2005"
3.48,-8.4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,4,"First, what is an ""English Style Ale""? I would not have had to have lived in Yorkshire to know that there is no single Englihs style ale, and even if there is a typical English pub ale, say a bitter, this beer would not be it. In fact, I would argue that Old Monkeyshine more closely resembles a strong scotch ale. Getting Nimbus' taxonomy, the beer is not bad. It has a plesant deep mahagony color. The aroma is a bit sweet and alcoholic but not unapatising. Hints of rasions and caramel, finishes slightly tart. Supprisingly drinkable for its strength. It might do quite nicely on a cool desert winters night.","Bcant","Jun 22, 2005"
4.3,13.2,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"This beer really surprised me. While it's listed as a brown ale on here, on Nimbus' website, it's called a strong ale. At 8.2% ABV, you can't really disagree with Nimbus. When I poured it and saw that it was a deep, dark brown with a small head, my mind flashed back to Tommyknocker's Imperial Nut Brown, a highly-touted, highly-alcoholic brown ale that I really didn't like. Monkeyshine is completely different, though; in the Tommyknocker, the alcohol was the dominant flavor, while here it's just a hint. I'm amazed how well it's hidden. I'm more amazed that it tastes so good, malty, sweet and brown sugary in the beginning, with a lingering bitter finish. I gave it a 4.5 in drinkability simply because it's as easy to drink as the Yuengling Traditional Lager I had last night, but with more flavor and double the alcohol. I really wish I could get this here, it's right up there with the best. Hearty thanks go out to Gueuzedude for allowing me to try this wonderful beer.","battlekow","Apr 26, 2005"
3.95,3.9,4,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,"Nice malty taste with a little more hop bite than expected, maybe too much. The alcohol is pretty well hidden, until it hits the gut. Middle of the sip is similar to the smell...with hints of raisins and sugars. Finish is of slight alcohol and hops.","blackie","Sep 18, 2003"
4.1,7.9,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Well to be honest, at first I didnt like the taste too much. Didnt know what to make of it at first. I think I drank the first bottle too cold. The next day I drank another bottle more towards room temperature and wow, what flavour it had. Its noted as a brown ale, but if you hold it up the sunset, the colours come alive. More of a dark red/honey hue. I have to think that it was partly the mood I was in, and the setting, that allowed me to enjoy it this time. I would definately buy some more.","Solomon420","Sep 04, 2003"
3.93,3.4,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"This beer is a deep amber color. It is fairly clear with just a hint of chill haze. It smell malty sweet with a bit of fruitiness in the nose. Nice full bodied with a malty expression. This beer tenderly coats your mouth. This is a very well balanced beer, as an English expression of a strong ale should be. There is a hint of hop flavor that helps to carry the maltiness of this brew.","Gueuzedude","Beers"
3.8,0,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Tasted at the 2002 Oregon Brewers Festival. Light brown color. Aroma is small white and foamy. Aroma is malty, nutty and very sweet. Deep malt flavor, not very hoppy. Lighter bodied . Nice flavor. Rich and round. Mouthfeel is full and round. Aftertaste is slightly bitter.","beerguy101","0"

4.27,12.4,4,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,"A nice deep mahogany color on the pour, the head is moderate in size, the texture spumescent, beige in color and as it dissipates the left over lace a nice coating on the glass. Floral nose, sweet malt, caramel and quite fresh and pleasing to the senses, with the start sweet and malt, the top is middling in its feel to the palate. Finish is a Â“Hop HeadsÂ” delight; boom right in the palate as the hops over run your taste buds, mildly acidic, dry as a desert bone aftertaste and a real treat for this old strong ale lover.","Gusler","Beers"
4.87,28.2,4.5,5,5,5,4.5,"A very fine beer -- seems more like a barley wine than a brown ale to me.  Probably the best one I've ever had, and I'm fairly picky when it comes to the style.  A terrific beer.","mzwolinski","0"
