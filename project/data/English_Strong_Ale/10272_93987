3.55,-7.6,3.25,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.5,"O: A pretty good brew, though like many I&G beers not quite perfect. So-so looks; shame the head disappears too rapidly. The aroma and flavour are a pleasant mix of caramel malt, dried fruit, yeast esters and mild woodiness. The cherrywood adds something but the effect is subtle. Body is OK. The biggest problem is that the character seems too clean and polished - I reckon bottle conditioning would add a layer of complexity that would give it a boost. However, it goes down easily enough on a winter's evening. Worth trying if you come across it.","jazzyjeff13","Nov 23, 2014"

The flavors are robust and full, and never let you truly forget what you are tasting....I feel like this could be part of a compote for pancakes or something breakfasty.  I like it, but not quite to the same extent as other I&G fare.....still, a very good beer that is innovative, using the Canadian Cherrywood and it doesn't disappoint!","ChrisCage","Nov 01, 2014"

The brew smells like cherries, wood, maple, and bready malt. I think the taste mostly follows the aroma, with the cherry and wood flavors being the strongest. It's a sweet, fruity ale. There's also some caramel and candied fruit flavors noticeable. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick and creamy with moderate carbonation.

The hops aren't here but everything else is and someone looking for a good dessert beer to split without the sour tartness of the cherries would be wise to start here. Innis and Gunn beers are different and not for everyone but those who are patient will be well rewarded with a subtly smooth and strong beer that's worth the time it takes to finish it off.","JerzDevl2000","Jul 27, 2013"

I'm really not sure what the cherrywood is giving to the equation - there's maybe a light amount of cherry flavor but that might be me imagining it due to the cherry on the label - but the maple syrup contributes a nice amount of complexity to the finish.
