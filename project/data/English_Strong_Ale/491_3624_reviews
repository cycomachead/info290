"Overall: this is definitely the best of Coopers' beers, with their Best Extra Stout taking a close second. A complex and easy-drinking beer for either a session, or chilling with for a half-hour. They cellar for a number of years too, and can improve with age. Well worth the AU$83 for a case of 24 x 375mL."

"Fruity apples and apricots easy drinking"

"Hazy amber colour, big head and big lace. Smell is very faint, apples I think and caramel. Medium body and correct carbonation. Taste of fruits, apples and apricots. Easily drinkable, but I don't feel nothing special in this one."
"2009 vintage. Aged 4 years"

"O: cannot recommend this old style ale despite its fine aroma."
""
""

"O - very tasty and easy dinking, leaves me thirsty after each sip"

"a good quality beer that is the best in the coopers range. Will be interesting to taste again in a year or two."
""
""
"Overall: Cellared from beer of the month club. This beer has mellowed throughout the cellaring process. However, I don't believe this has benefited the beer. Not as developed as I had hoped for this style."
""
""
""

""
"O: Nice easy drinker, good beer the end the day with. Worth a try."
""
"Pours a clear copper with a foamy bone head that settles to a film on top of the beer. A foamy curtain of lace coats the glass on the drink down. Smell is malt, caramel, and fruity aromas. Taste is much the same with caramel and hop flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that smells better than it tastes in my opinion."

"overall, a decent thicker english brew. definitely one which you need to 'step back' and re-evaluate before making a decision... i'm intrigued by the sediment sitting on top of the thin film of white; by the thick feel on the tongue and the bitter, yet malty sweet taste on the palate afterward...."
""
"I did like this beer, not too heavy, still flavorful and hoppy. I wonder how it would be if I drank it in another couple of years or younger. Though after 3 years it showed up as a great beer, maybe at its peak."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The side of the bottle did say to pour with care because there is sediment in the bottom of the bottle, I pour first and read second. It would be easy to drink more than one of these beers in a sitting. Overall a pleasant beer and I would buy again."
""

"""Coopers Ales and Stout are brewed using the centuries old top fermentation method and natural bottle conditioning, resulting in a characteristic fine sediment forming on the base of the bottle. This sediment is completely natural and can be gently mixed before stinking or poured carefully leaving the sediment in the bottle."""

"This is the 2008 vintage that I have been aging in my cellar for a few years now. Poured into a Brooklyn Brewery snifter. I was extremely careful to not pour the thick sediment into the glass. Great amount of carbonation, with excellent lacing. Garnet ruby red body with orange highlights. Very nice looking beer. Smell was earthy and yeasty. Taste was very pleasurable. Malt, raisins, toffee, and fresh bread were highlights. Mouthfeel was the biggest surprise, so extra points here. It held up well over the time in the cellar, and it was mighty smooth. If I could go back, I would definitely buy a few more for a mere $3 each and age some for 5 years and beyond just to see if it can get better. But it's pretty great tasting at 4 years, no doubt."
""
""
""
""
"Conclusion: Very nice at 2 years and at 4. Could it go longer? Yes I think it could, but not past 5 or so years, and not without good cellar conditions. I really enjoyed seeing this evolve into something good but different. Now I want to taste it fresh."
"O: An interesting beer to have tried..."
""
"O - Somewhat disappointed in this. Too hot and spritzy for what it offers in terms of flavour and complexity."
""
"I knew I should be suspicious of a 5-year-old beer in a twist top. There are the whiskey notes of a mature strong ale, yes, but the whole thing is thin, flat and one dimensional, without even worrying if it's a bit stale. Not the best from Coopers or Oz."
""
""
"Over all this is a nice vintage ale well cellar-ed, leans towards a barley wine style. I would be interested in trying other beers in the Cooper's fleet of beer."
""
""
""
"I would highly recommend this one as it is exceptional and is a great treat."
""
""
"I didn't age this one, these '09 bottles were purchased yesterday. A letdown six-pack purchase. Never having had it fresh, I have nothing to compare them to. And, considering what's here now, there's no reason to let these sit any longer. 3.5"
""
"Overall, interesting, but can't say I am desiring this again."
"O: Not bad, but not overly interesting. Very well balanced, though."
"2009 vintage, so something like two or three years old at this point. Great burnt orange hue, nice head that settles down into a thin layer of foamy bubbles that never go all the way away. Lots of malty sweetness on the nose, some wood, some dark fruit. The taste follows the smell fairly closely, but the good news is that the wood and fruit flavors come on strong and it is not just a simple malt bomb - well crafted and well cellared beer here. The only hint at the strength of this beer is the association of the flavors with high gravity brews; I'm not really picking up any alcohol heat. Maintains surprisingly good carbonation, unsure if the liveliness is appropriate here or not but I for one appreciate it, definitely adds another dimension to the beer. Nice and full bodied without being viscous or too sticky. Altogether, not a beer I was sure I would like, and certainly one that exceeded my expectations. Australians keeping it real here."
"330ml bottle.Tulip glass.Enjoyed on nov´11.Orangish cooper. Close froth,yellowish in color.Large bubbled quickly dissipated head. Yeast, sugar,slightly toasted malt aroma & hints of candies to the nose.Gentle malty flavor at first sip.Notes of spices & brandy.Orange zest & sugar. Kind warming alcohol & bitter underneath.Fruity finish.Full body,soft carbonation.Woody aged aftertaste.Pleasant & paused drink in the evening.Well balanced beer."
"Pours a maduro brown with some creamy foam accenting the top. Spot lace. Smells like malt and a hint of molasses with a solid point of oxidation. Maybe some tea like aromas. Flavor is surprisingly oxidized and fruity for the nose. Lots of wood, yeast and cherry flavor. Medium bodied with hi carb and a semi slick finish. Not a particularly impressive offering."
""
"O/D - Not good. Maybe infected. Weird cloying and offensive flavours in the finish. Sad to have bought this with such high expectations."
""
""
""
"T: Big and malty flavor with some dark fruit notes. Prune and some raisin are the biggest flavors. Mouthfeel is a bit thin despite the big flavors."
"O: Overall it is a decent beer. I give it an average because I'm on the fence overall with this beer, which is how I feel about most average beers."
""
""
"O: 4"
""
"Overall: this beer is rough around the edges in some ways; its strength and the forwardness of its alcohol flavors impinge on its drinkability. However, that is clearly what this beer is supposed to be -- extra strong! I rather like it."
""
""
"Again, a gentle pour, but this time with just wisps for head and a deep-amber color with just the hint of haze. Nose had a more pronounced caramel sweetness. Mouthfeel was fuller and more carbonated, suggesting that fresher may be better, especially in this case. The taste was more pronounced, as opposed to aged, and I really caught the interaction between the hops and the malt. Toffee was prevalent, but not overwhelming, on the tongue. This was actually quite pleasant, where the previous vintage was more of a challenge. Finish was very caramel, very fitting for Christmasween."
"o) A very drinkable ale with enough complexity to keep interest. I think the bottled version is slightly better."
"O: This is not as strong as I had hoped but the fruitiness is very pleasant."
"Mouth feel was slick and medium heavy."
"2010 Vintage (consumed August 2011). Hard to get excited on this tasting. Flavours seem hard and unforgiving with bitter stone fruits. Some malt sweetness tries to get going but never really takes hold. Dumb phase? Have seen much better examples from previous vintages."
"If your into beers that really don't fit into stout, IPA, Belgian or whatever style but have a pretty good and different taste you will want to try this and the price isn't to bad either."
"O - This was really quite tasty with 3 years of age on it. I'd love to try a fresh bottle for comparison sake."
"Overall, this seems a little bit young or green, maybe best to sit on for a little while."
"Food match: Rich game meats like Venison or Kangaroo... in fact a grilled ""roo"" steak with roasted vegetables and a dark chocolate sauce would go down a treat with this."
"Poured an amber/copper color, very light tan head, but it doesn't stay long. Aroma is slightly fruity, malty and caramel. That carries over well into the taste, though it has a slight bitter edge and more nuttiness. Feels pretty good...medium bodied, a tad creamy and sick. Low carbonation. No real booziness to it, so it drinks easy enough, but it's just nothing too spectacular. Decent enough though....may sit on a bottle for a while"
"As a comparison I had a 2007 around six months ago that I almost though of as 'a perfect beer', and would have almost gone 5s or 4.5s across the scoreboard board on. Such an integrated Christmas cake sweetness to the flavour that was to die for."
"O - So clearly this is the pick of the Coopers stable.. although it has a price to match. Very pleasant and easy to drink. Proof that Australians can make a decent beer when we try!!"
"Overall this tastes very much like a English barley wine. It was very good and at a real good price. 11 bucks Canadian for a 6 pack. Coors light 6 packs cost around the same amount so i fought it a awesome deal."
"Drinkability - a little too bitter for me in general, but still good-tasting and complex/intriguing. Very decent brew."
"A somewhat plain vintage ale - kind of flabby all around. The well-integrated ABV helps in making this easy enough to drink, but it just doesn't grab my attention, the staid essence of English heritage perhaps my bias to bear."
"First sip confirms my suspicion; this smell & tastes a lot like an American-style Scotch Ale/Wee Heavy, which is good because I am currently in love with the style (namely,Lake Louie's Warped Speed) and it's kinda turned into my go-to beer this winter. A rustic sweetness characterized by roasted caramel with a chilled out bitterness gives my mouth a full flavored yet super easy drinking experience. My only complaint is that I drank it too fast."
"I've had this a few times over the years but I've never held on to one for more than a year/drank one older than a year and maybe next time, I'll give that a go. At 1 year or less, it's good but may be potentially beter."
"This beer is probably the best australia has to offer beerwise. Coopers is a brewery which I've ways felt was a tad not right, maybe it's those 50's labels on the sparkling and pale ales. I think if they gave their labels a makeover they could be an australian unibroue."
"Drinkability - Nice beer, would definitely have another. Quite heavy and fruity so not a session beer. Might suit a cider drinker better. Also quite potent in terms of alcohol."
"nice to slowly sip and let it warm and expand."
"D - i'm not gonna lie, this brew goes down nice and easy but it feels filling so i'm not sure i'd want to drink more than a few at a time. would not seek this out in the future."
"D- not the most drinable style, but i could have a couple in an evening though."
"D: Not bad, but a little to week in smell."
"Age it to perfection."
"Not bad, but honing the sharpness and increase the earthiness would improve it, IMHO."
"Drink: On the bottle they talk about how ageable and delicious this beer is, and honestly, I wish it was. After two years it hasn't held up at all, maybe it's a shipping thing or it wasn't properly stored, but for $16 a six pack, I feel ripped off."
"O: Quite easy to drink, but doesn't deliver something special. A bottle left on the shelf will maybe change my opinion later years."
"This beer should probably be cellared for a few years, but as it is now I have a hard time seing that it would have any chance to become more than average."
"A decent Strong Ale. I think I prefer it fresh but this isn't bad."
"D-- Carbonation hurt the drinkability of this. Really over carbonated. Flavors and the texture are pretty good though. This could develop into a really good beer in time. Have an 09 in my cellar and should have reviewed that one. Will hold off on trying a 10 again for at least a year."
"I keep trying to appreciate this beer more but it just doesn't work for me. I do appreciate that it's well made though."
"Pours an unfiltered copper with a thick cap of off-white and attractive head, clearly bottle conditioned, though with a bit of chunkiness to the yeast. Aromas of caramel, alcohol, grapes, honey and maple predominate with a touch of hops in there somewhere. Flavor has lots of syrupy malt, quite estery, some floral malts, some solvent alcohol, finish is very dry with some maple malt and grassy hops. Feel is nicely thick, but carbonation seems over the top, which is the norm from Coopers it would seem. This is a fair strong ale without much standout character."
"Taste: Quite a disappointment. I think perhaps it didn't have a malty enough body to stand up to 2 years of aging. Earthy herbal hops and a decent bitterness in the finish."
"2009 batch. Sampled on May 6, 2010. It pours a handsome but somewhat hazy dark amber with a long lasting luscious looking fluffy head and excellent clinging lacing. But the most noticeable aspect is all of the sedimentary deposits swimming around the glass. It is significant as a home brew. Caramel malts is the first sensation in the aroma followed quickly by a pine tree, raisiny background and a crisp, fresh quality. The mouthfeel is fairly bold with the bits of sediments tickling the tongue. The overall impression of the taste is a kind of biterness with a dose of hard liquor. But the sweet malts and dry hoppy finish are also notable. It is complex but delightful. I can happily announce that this is the first Austrailian beer I actually really enjoyed and would actively look for again."
"D: Good flavor, but not an enjoyable mouthfeel. And no one really wants to watch floating bits sliding into their mouth from a beer. I understand drinking sediment but this is large particles."
"2009 Vintage. Rusty orange with a thick billowy head. Lookin good. Nice fruity esters and some hints of raisin and dried fruits. A wonderful hit of rich bitterness and warming alcohol in perfect balance. Very much Eglish in style like most things Coopers does. Quite moreish. This is possibly the best vintage yet."
"Overall, this is pretty average. The appearance risks being off-putting and the smell is unbalanced. The taste is redeeming, but not enough so that I would seek this out in the future."
"I enjoyed it, but believe it to be over-priced in my area of the country."
"This is a damn fine brew, it still is a bit hot even 2 years old, it could get better with age, though it has the twist off which is more prone to oxygenation."
"OVERALL: A tasty brew for sure. Another good offering from Coopers to go beside their fine Export Stout. Very enjoyable and drinkable, though the palate needs a little beefing up to really get it over the hump. One to try if you can find it."
"Bottle: Poured a amber color ale with a medium foamy head with good retention and some good lacing. Aroma of sugar and light subtle fruity ester with nice dry caramel malt balance. Taste is a well balanced mix between some caramelized sugar with great note light dry raisins. Body is about average with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Well done though additional complexity could have benefited this beer."
"The taste is bad, thankfully we were splitting this and I didn't have much to drink. It was bitter with bad hops. The feel was ok, but not drinkable at all."
"Really, this isn't a bad brew, but there's certainly something a bit too raw about it. Perhaps it mellows with age, perhaps is becomes slightly sweeter, and the harsher notes become blunted. Maybe. Hopefully."
"2008. Poured a fairly clear tawny amber with an eggshell cap of fine bubbles. Thick, chunky lacing with good head retention. The sediment was quite loose, meaning that it was suspended in the last 2oz or so of beer, even with a careful pour. Fruity aroma, toffee, bready, ripe apple and pear skin. Malty texture, a little coarse, medium bodied with lowish carbonation. The body fell away a little bit towards the end, leaving it a bit thin. Medium to low bitterness that was more pronounced in the finish. Hops were a bit grassy and herbal, perhaps minty, and lingered on the palate. It was a bit earthy and there was a hint of anise mid-palate and in the finish. Fruity character was less prominent and seemed to be tied to a light alcohol flavour. There seemed to be a hint of oak/wood as well, contributing a light astringency. Overall, pretty good other than the issue I had with the body."
"Poured a brown color with a two finger head that died quickly and left little lace. A decent malt smell with some caramel sweetness and hints of hops. Has a smooth, easy to drink feel and while enjoyable rather simple. Minor fruity hops mix with mild sweet malts for a rather broad brew that is a little prickly and has a minor dry backbite. Not much in this beer but it is a good one to try."
"I would have this again, though it would be mood-dependent, and I wouldn't pass up an opportunity to see what else this brewery can do."
"Still, this makes me interested in trying more."
"D - This is a pretty good beer thats fairly easy to drink the abv doesn't really come out worth a try sometime"
"D - This is a decent beer - if not an odd style - I would consider more on the light side of a barleywine. It's been aged, as evident by the oxidation, but it just doesn't reach the level of complexity one might expect from a strong ale. Nonetheless, it is worth trying, but you probably don't need to get too excited about it."
"Nice old ale I'd buy it if I see it easy to drink and enjoyable at that I could see me drinking a couple of these in a sitting"
"D-Enjoyable ale. Solid beer"
"Drinkability: Really, just kind of strange for an English style ale. However, I definitely do enjoy it, I just can't see myself returning to it too often."
"Not bad. Definitely a strong ale of sorts. Not as strong as the american cousin and slightly closer to an english barleywine, albeit not quite."
"d: Pretty tasty, but kind of green. I should have waited to open this."
"Interesting brew. Not one to drink steadily, but an ok experience."
"Mouthfeel medium and smooth with fairly heavy carbonation. Alcohol presence becomes more pronounced as it warms. Drinkability is fairly good, but lends itself to sipping."
"notes- this review is for a 2002 vintage tasted in 2002"
"This is easy to drink with enough going on to keep interest, a nice smoothness, and abv very well-covered."
"This is there 2009 vintage and it pours a deep mahogany,honeyish hue with nice carbonation that leaves a nice one finger head,it has aromas of freshly baked bread,yeasty malty notes and suprisingly some fruity notes too quite impressive for Coopers,it has an above average mouthfeel and from my first sip i know i have just found my favourite Coopers beer in their range without a doubt it has a strong malty yeast note first up followed by some light spicy,fruity hops and it finishes ever so smooth,i honestly cant believe its taken me this long to discover a true australian beauty."
"Overall: Like PapaEugene, I had this one after Pliny the Elder, so I was a bit sick and tired of a very bitter aftertaste. This is the main reason why I couldn't enjoy this beer. As mentioned by PapaEugene, for a fair review, I will have to drink it another time. But this is not too high on my beer-priority list..."
"D: I guess a bad choice after the hop-bomb pliny the elder. To give it a fair review I would have to drink this again..."
"This vintage ale calls for aging. However, nothing in body, flavors or character could lead one to conclude that aging will help this dull, simple and short flavored beer with a fantastic nose. Smell it; don't drink it. Just one guys opinion."
"Interesting beer. Got this at Sam's in Chicago last week. Poured with a tan head and a few drops of dark sediment. Color is a very hazy dark amber to brown. Nose is some malt, caramel, toffee, nougat, and varnish. No lace and head mostly subsides quickly. Flavor is malty, toffee, a bit bitter from yeastoids, Thinner than I would have supposed. Think it'll get much better with some time. Do pick up the alcohol. Good carbonation. Finish is ok."
"This beer pours a murky light amber color. The head is small, and vanishes into almost no lacing within seconds. The aroma is burnt caramel, brown sugar, alcohol, and a hint of wood as if it had some barrel aging to it (although I don't think it does). The taste is very malty. The toffee and caramel flavors come up first with the brown sugar and alcohol rounding out the finish. There is no hint of wood like in the aroma. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with carbonation that is too high for the style, and really gets in the way of the taste. Overall, this is an alright beer. I could drink it again without any complaints, but there are a lot of strong ales out there with more complexity."
"Maybe not as unique and amazing as marketing tries to make out this ale to be I still have this up there as one of my top 3 English style ales made in Australia (and in general, though my experience with international varieties are the more common garden varieties.) Definitely will drink this many times again, though it's not always quite this good and the Coopers Sparkling Ale is also very good, cheaper and more consistent with taste."
"D: This was a vintage-dated bottle dated 2008, so I probably drank it a bit too soon. Overall, those higher alcohols were the dominating flavor in this beer and were harsh at best. I'm thinking of buying a few more bottles and seeing how it ages over time, as this beer definitely needs some years to mellow out. I'll try to come back and re-review this beer once I had the chance to age a bottle for awhile."
"2008 vintage and a real pleasure to drink. The beer pours the colour of boot polish and the nose is redolent of plums and dark fruits. This is a big beer with lots of complexity but with the typical Coopers fruitiness and soft finish. This is a great example of an Old Ale with all the complexities that go with the style"
"It starts off with a little bit of sourness, and finishes sweet. Moderate carbonation, with a slightly sticky mouth feel. Overall, it is warming and shows some depth. I think this would do better with age. The alcohol could mellow a bit."
"Loved this. Exceptional."
"Very nice taste, rich and malty with a hoppy finish. Alcohol is mostly well hidden but there is a bit of a jolt in the middle, it's well masked by the hops. Finds its way a bit slowly through the mouth, a bit clunky somehow. This is a very good beer, really, impressive yet pleasant and very fine drinking."
"This has to get better with age, right? As of now, it is not very flavorful."
"Pours a dark golden/amber color. Lots of suspended yeast in this brew. 1/4 inch head with slight retention and slight lacing. Smells strongly of alcohol and some strong malt. Fits the style of an English Strong Ale (My first example of this style and if this is any indication of what other's will taste like, I'm a big fan.) Has a thick and slighty crisp mouth feel. There is a bitterness and tartness associated with an average carbonation level. Tastes of roasted malts, strong malts, slight hops, and noticeable alcohol content. Overall, this is a really good sipping beer. Worth a try!"
"The color is a deep amber. It pours a medium head that's decently sustained with light lacing. Carbonation is light. There is an taste with a slight citrus; almost woody, with a very tame and pleasant underlying sweetness. It is medium-bodied, and a fairly thick, malty mouthfeel. The malt and hops are very well-balanced and I thought the taste was very good. I will try this again."
"Pours medium amber with off-white head that retains fairly well. Nose kicks off with an immediate resemblance to ceylon black tea, slight citrus, and some metallic components as well. Light bodied ale that is rather tame with all flavors, starting with soft malt and quickly balanced by the hops that build well into the finish. Not sure that age will enhance this beer because it seems that once the hops mellow, there isn't much left that is contemplative."
"Deep rusted amber with moderate carbonation and medium white head. Fades after a minute or so, with minimal lacing in random spots. Pretty good nose, fruity malt and an earthy hop aroma. Good flavor. Slightly sweet fruits, a touch of honey and caramel, little sugar. Earthy, crisp hops to compliment from middle to finish. A tiny bit thin but good mouthfeel with a good dry finish. On par with the style, I suppose. Not bad by any means. Thanks to IntriqKen for a bottle of this Coopers brew that I haven't seen in my parts."
"D: OK, but not great. Strength and alcohol warmth makes this a good nightcap beer."
"Pours a dark brown with little clarity. Develops a thin brown/white head that dissipates quickly into a small collar and no laciness. Nice aroma of hops and malt, a lot of citruis. Excellent taste, good blend of hops and malt. Taste reminded me a lot of a belgium quad. Mouthfeel is light and crisp, with a chewy texture. Good all around beer, excellent flavor and not hard on the alchohol side making it an excellent choice for a session beer."
"2006. Cloudy brown pour with a short tan head. Lots of sediment, as usual. Woody, malty aroma. Kind of dusty, but in a good way. Heavy caramel and molasses taste with thick malt. A pleasant bitterness in the back, expected of a good ESB. Pretty good."
"D: Not the best beer. Kind of a weaker attempt at an English ale. For a strong vintage ale I was expecting much more. I also don't see thi sbeer aging very well at all."
"It was a warming brew with a slightly ""oily"" feel to it. Solid, but I would not go out of the way to get it."
"D: Good drinkability worthy of a try, pretty tasty and big for an Australian beer."
"The taste is much worse and seems just old, acrid, and flat. It is mostly just old leaves and apples with a sharp, rough alcoholic quality. The overall character is very flat."
"Good, but not sure it is worth the cash you have to fork over for it."
"This is a really nice & strong full aussie Strong Ale, well worth the $$$."
"The beer pours a dark amber color with a nice head. There are floaties throughout when held up to the light. It's a fairly murky beer. The smell is strong with some sweetness and ethanol. It's somewhat reminiscent of maple syrup with a bit of fruit. Despite this sweetness, the taste carries a fair amount of bitterness, as well. The flavor doesn't quite balance out ultimately, and the alcohol also shows up a bit much. It's a strong beer that drinks even less smoothly than it's abv of 7.5% would suggest. There is a good deal of carbonation, a bit bracing when paired with the bitter notes. I enjoyed the beer but probably wouldn't buy it again. Admittedly, this is not my favorite style."
"Good beer, no quite the standout one expects from a vintage ale, but it is a bit more drinkable than expected as well."
"A bit disappointing overall (especially after shelling out $20 CAN for a 6 of this!), it kind of teases, but doesn't own up, the flavour is too loose and disjointed to really leave a lasting impression. The abv% however tends to kick like a mule for 7.5%."
"Most likely the best Aussie beer I've ever had (only been once). I wonder what flavours are around if you cellar one for a few years?"
"D: Not very. One or two 12oz bottles for the night at most. But mainly because of the alcohol content as the taste is good."
"D: Easy to drink too many of these. The alcohol is well integrated into the flavour and does not detract from this well balanced beer"
"D: One bottle is enough. Not great, just good."
"A nice strong ale, but it is so similar to pretty much everything Coopers does why bother making it a ""vintage?"""
"The alcohol content is high enough, and although I don't taste it, I certainly feel it, that it gets docked a point in drinkability. Elsewise, this is an excellent brew that has aged exceptionally well."
"12.7 oz bottle labeled, ""Coopers Vintage Ale"" (no extra strong)in to a goblet. Purchased and cellared in somewhat warm (70-73 degrees) temp for close to a year (not sure of batch number or other). Pours an orangish brown with a light head- somewhat murky. Smells sweet with a grape/ winey scent. Sweet taste that is followed with malt. Mouthfeel is pretty light and more carbonated than I expected. This is very drinkable, and would recommend. I did not know what to expect, as this was the first English Strong Ale for me. mmmm 5 more to go."
"Overall - A good strong ale, well balanced and tasty. I would love to try this after a few years!"
"I think I drank this too young. Another year might have mellowed it out a bit. Still, I need to rate it as I drank it, not as I think it might turn out someday."
"D: This is something that I would have one or maybe two of. Not as much depth as I would have liked."
"Pours a deep brown color with golden and reddish hues. Thin off-white head that dissipates to a film quickly. Spotty lacing on the glass. Light nuts and malt in the nose with hints of peppery alcohol. Medium-bodied and well-carbonated with flavors of nuts, figs and malt. Touches of spicy hops and alcohol as well. The finish is chewy and sweet with a light astringency in the background. Above average overall."
"D = I would definitely drink this again. It was better with some age on it, but it was an enjoyable beer either way. Thanks for the trade, Paul."
"d: definitely a decent beer but not one i would particularly go out of my way to try again"
"This selection from Copper's has an dark amber color and an cream colored head and a slightly spicy scent. It starts out with a malt sweetness ballenced wiht hop spice and ending with a bitter finnish all mixed toghter with that funky coppers flavor."
"This Australian import is something of an odd duck in my view. It has a good smell and appearance and an OK mouthfeel. The taste is odd. It's almost like it starts out with a very flavorful burst and gives up. I was left wanting more in this department. I hope this is somewhat clear. This is one of those beers that's pretty good but far from being transcendental."
"An enjoyable beer that I would have ranked even higher had the alcohol not taken over the flavor and nose quite so strongly."
"Poured into Victoria Bitter pilsner glass."
"Pours a murky copper/ amber color, with an off white head. In the aroma, green apple sweetness, yet not that fruity and hints of alcohol. In the taste, malty alcohol and a small sweetness. A malty smoothness, medium to lagre bodied mouthfeel, and a dry and somewhat fruity aftertaste. A nice sipping beer, and a nice alcohol presence."
"An excellent beer and gave me a much better impression of Coopers beers than the only other one I have had."
"Poured a cloudy brown colour with some chunks of yeast and a semi thick head which dissipated quite quickly. It smelled very sweet and yeasty and had a fruity yeasty flavour that filled the mouth. Something that I probably couldn't drink a lot of in one sitting but would be good every so often to appreciate it for what it is."
"Drinkability: 2006 - great drinkability, much improved over the one year I've cellared it, but still slightly too boozy, but not bad - 4.0. 2007 - overall a bit too harsh and aggressive; time should hopefully round out the flavours and blend them more harmoniously, but overall too boozy and harsh - 3.0."
"Poured from a bottle into wine glass at room temperature. Was orange brown colour, but had no head, some sedimentation. Good bitterness with sherry undertones. Subdued odour which is slightly floral. Slight heaviness but well carbonated in the mouth. Well pleasing beer."
"Poured from a glass into a bottle and noticed alot of ""sediment"" (their words) setlling in the glass. The color is a caramel brown with a very thin head. The taste is not what I expected from what the color of the brew was. The taste took some getting used to IMO. The aroma had your usual scents nothing really stood out here. I am going to have to try this one again maybe I got a bad bottle."
"Pours a slightly cloudy orange/light brown color with a decent amount of creamy tan head that fades to a thin layer. Smells fruity and malty, and a little roasty. Very pleasant. The taste is very sweet as well, some chocolate, a tiny bit of roast coffee and a lot of malt. There's also a hint of hop flavor there as well, and not a lot of bitterness, but it works. Mouthfeel is very heavy and creamy. Overall, it's a very drinkable 'real ale' style beer. I'll definitely be getting more of this. Haven't met any Coopers ales that I haven't liked, and this is no exception."
"One of those great finds while in Atlanta, GA a couple months ago. Although the 'best by' date says 10-09-06, I beg to differ. This beer shows a lot of talent and character. A bottle-conditioned pour delivers a strong copper, chesnut hue with a haze due to the yeast (among other particles) within the beer. Aromas are soft, yet firm with serious notes of barley malt, over-rippened peaches and pears, with a subtle English hop character (Fuggles?). All blends so well... The taste gives a well-matured, softly textured, and seriously complex blend of Marris Otter-tasting malts that bring out the soft fruity esters while contributing a spicy, fermented edgy, yeasty flavor. Again, well-rippened peaches and pears all over the place, leaving a mouth watering sensation after every sip. Each drink follows with a soft ride with aged hops and a pleasant (albeit light) hop flavor and mild sherry (oxidized) notes that complemented the beer well. A mild metalic taste is the only deterant. The feel is a soft, creamy, malty fullness that never shows agression or fusal alcohols. Finishes with the same fruity flavors experienced in the taste with intermingling notes of hops and alcohol dryness. Turned out to hold a 1/4"" head all the way to the bottom of the glass with superior lacing. This is how I expect the Fuller's Vintage Ales to perform into their prime. This beer is that good. Probably should have waited to share this beer with a few local BA's (sorry guys), but this one is all mine!"
"This is a hard beer to describe as it's so simple yet so complex at the same time. A perfect simple big malty vintage/old ale with waves of big malt flavors. Just so well done"
"Tasty beer."
"d: pretty easy to drink at 7+% and a pretty good balance between malts & hops, only missing ingredient is more flavor"
"Drinkability: Great to drink on a cold winters night. Full flavoured, full of life. Strong tastes with warming alcohol."
"This is one funky looking beer. because of the sediment left in this bottle-conditioned ale, the beer pours a briney dark reddish/brown with a lot of sediment floating around. That gives it a very malty, bready aroma. Also lots of apples, bananas, dates and sugar. The taste reminds me a lot of a traditional English pale ale, but this one is a bit thin. There's a nice bitterness, reminiscent of a barley wine, but this one is a little thin on the palate. Not a bad brew despite its scary looks, but I'll try something else for my English ale fix."
"Drank alright, alcohol starts to show up at the end. I'd loved to found this back when I was in OZ, I know all the other coopers I've had were better fresh. If priced right, I'd revisit, no problem"
"It's an interesting beer, and fairly drinkable for its strength, but it lacks the character and depth of its superior rivals. It's lighter and refreshing, and quite unique in that way. Taken for what it is, and simply enjoyed hedonistically without reference, it's quite enjoyable. Worth trying!"
"drinkability: just fine"
"D: Average. The aging didn't do it any favors one way or another. Maybe I should have had it right away."
"It has a silky feel on the palate after the swallow. Easily drinkable but almost scared by the appearance the heavy sediment. Almost looks like there is something wrong with it."
"Drinkability - ok, this is a new style for me and since this is my first English Strong Ale I have nothing to put up as a comparison. I think this is an interesting style with a fine sweet/malty taste. I have several more and will hold on to them."
"I would rather drink other beers that are tastier & smaller ABV%."
"As with most Coopers beers, this is yeastier than I like, but still a nice drop. Reminiscent of many a strong, yeasty Belgian ale. Good head retention and lace, quite sweet overall and not bitter as I earlier implied. Very drinkable for 7.5%abv."
"(12.7 oz short brown slight hourglass shape with ""Coopers"" logo embossed around the neck (X4))"
"Notes: I was much more generous rating this beer in the past. Enthusiasm affects my rating system, but it may have actually been better six months after purchase rather than two years. I might just store a six-pack for next winter, and see if it has changed from what I think of it now..."
"I'll happily endorse this as Coopers best ever product, and quite possibly Australia's best ever brew. I'll also have to note that batches and years have varied greatly. I've tasted older batches that are far worse."
"D - Great drinkability, this ale is welcome in doses of a pint or less. It leaves you wanting more with relatively low bitterness and mature maltiness."
"Cheers!"
"cheers!"
"Aftertaste is comfortable drying with a hint of the cider left on the tongue."
"Pours a very murky light brown and very little head. There is also a lot of sediment and some yeast in the bottom of the bottle. Not a pretty sight. The nose is substantially better, a malty sweet smell combined with a slight sour sharpness that is not unpleasant. Maybe some apricot and spice as well. Its a little faint, but fine. The taste is a little unusual, with a deep but light maltiness, a little bit of spicy hops and some orange peel flavors. A touch of dried apricot makes another appearance. A little funky, but somewhat tasty. Mouthfeel is smooth and a little light. A little too off balance for me to drink all the time, but not bad to try once."
"what a disappointment. dont know if age will help tame this beast. not that i need to worry as this is the only bottle i got, and dont plan on going back for more."
"Notes: (Bottle best before 10.09.06) Tastes much better after having been stored at 55 degrees for 8 months, has aparently absorbed some the off flavors into the yeast. I've had this happen before with minor heat damage. But of course, there is no substitute for proper cellaring."
"Verdict: I liked it quite a bit, but it seemed to lack a hook that would make it stand out."
"good for after dinner to be sipped slowly over conversation."
"This is an almost no flavor, aroma brew. It may be too cold, or old. But it is worth a try for the try."
"Bottle reads best after Jun 06 and, typical of Coopers, it's a twist off. Cloudy brown colour. Poured so as to force a large white stable head. Some lacing left on the glass. Banana yeast aroma. Fresh, grainy sweet malt and vanilla too. Flavour is fruity (banana, apple), yeasty, toffeeish and caramel like. Alcohol is hidden fairly well but some nice warmth is provided. Chewy mouthfeel and medium bodied. A very good brew from Coopers and better than what I remember of the 2004."
"2006 vintage tasted. Careful not to disturb quite a bit of sediment, it pours a clear copper. There is little head which dissipates quickly. Smell dominated by synthetic fruit aromas: fruit jellies, apple peel, banana milkshake, and toffee. Quite sweet to taste with alcohol coming through very strong. Nice fine bubbles with a creamy mouthfeel. Overall, okay I suppose, but overly sweet and I was expecting more intensity with this beer."
"It's vary drinkable, well balanced for the style, and would compliment stong flavored meats and spiced dishes."
"The flavor profile was something I didn't record in my notes (damn!) besides that it was very tasty- now that's descriptive! It was a very balanced beer, with a moderate fruit character that made easy to drink. I enjoyed this, although if it's truly a strong ale, it may not really fit the style too well. So what- it's a good beer."
"Overall- A tasty fruity beer, High alcohol seems to be pretty well hidden. I liked it."
"Sure, this beer is drinkable. Hell, I even like it. I think it tastes good. But is it special? No. I just dont get the needed complexity to keep my interest. Granted, I love English-style Old Ales, Strong Ales, and Barleywines so I ask for more out of them then other beers. I purchased my bottle in Kansas City, KS for $3. I need not buy this again."
"Excellent sipping/special beer."
"D - Not bad. Not good. Worth drinking."
"Mild malt overtones and a slightly bitter finish, but not a whole lot of character. Insipid mouthfeel that is offputting. Most of this went down the drain."
"Medium mouth is right in line with the style. It has a little more carbonation than most offerings in this style, but this is not a problem at all when paired with the range of flavors. One of the more drinkable ESAs."
"Barleywine barley and sweet malt aroma. Nut brown colour with white head, lace. Not all that strong, and a middling body and mouthfeel. Fairly simple old ale taste with drying finish. Wood and roasted barley and licorice notes, nut brown, carmel, slightly on sweet side."
"D: Not a stand out beer by any stretch, but worth a drink. Flavors are much more subdued than I'd expect out of a ""VINTAGE"" ale."
"No date on bottle, poured into pint glass leaving dregs in bottle. Hazy brown with not much head. Aroma is sweet malts and alcohol. This beer is very sweet and the alcohol is very obvious, I also notice caramel notes. The alcohol burn lingers. Hops not prominant in this one. Somewhere between medium and full bodied with little carbonation. I was expecting a lot more from this one. I don't like this one very much, but it does match the style well."
"Hazy brown color- thick lasting head- nose brown sugar roasted malts  taste brown sugar, caramel, malts, smoke, figs- medium body- aftertaste figs, malt Hazy brown color- thick lasting head- nose brown sugar roasted malts  taste brown sugar, caramel, malts, smoke, figs- medium body- aftertaste figs, malt"
"This beers' bark is worse than it's bite, still not a bad brew worth a try."
"Over all a good beer but there seems to be something missing. Maybe need an older vintage?"
"An odd but not unpleasant drinking experience. Nevertheless, I think one would suffice for me during a drinking session. Im curious to try a fresher example to see what the difference would be. Worth seeking out to try, not sure it could become a favorite of mine"
"Body was relatively light, but the chunks were a little harder to swallow."
"This pours into a pint glass. The tan thick, murky, yeast-filled, liquid is non-transparent. The head is big large bubbles that slowly dissipate with some time. The aroma is not overpowering any way it just has some earthy hops and a little stale bread. The flavor is what is also nice. There is a lot of bitterness in there, but the strong backbone of old malt that kind of a little on the stale side also shows through. The mouthfeel is medium with a drying bitter aftertaste. One is enough. Great brew to switch it up!"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Mouthfeel is buttery smooth. One of the better Australian beers I have come across (that's not saying all that much)."
"An exceptional brew from the otherwise barren land of VB and Foster's. Strong in the english sense, I don't imagine this keeping too much past a couple years, but it's one easy drinking strong ale. So creamy and smooth. I like it a lot."
"I let this one sit in the fridge for a while because I noticed it looked a little sedimenty/murky. Well, that was a bust cause it poured a muddy amber to copper color with no real head other that some beige-like floating bubbles. Lightly fruity in aroma with some dull honeyed breadiness and some odd mineral notes. Tastes like the same strain of yeast is utilized from the Sparkling Ale, leaving a dry, distictive metallic twang. Lightly cidery, without being appley, almost seltzery. Too much play on carbonation and not enough emphasis on ale-like qualities. The only suggestion of its strength is a slight lingering caramel maltiness. Off-balanced and strange, but I am intrigued by it's dryness and accent on carbonation without making a good pour (twist-off?) I'll have to revisit this one again."
"Cooper's Vintage Ale pours a hazy (after mixing in the sediment) copper color with a thin head. Aroma is a bit vinous. Taste is slightly vinous, but really more fruity I think. Kind of a bit of apple flavor. Caramel also comes through. Prickly carbonation. An interesting beer from a brewery that I don't tend to expect much from. Definitely worth a try."
"Poured a brown, iced tea like body into a tulip glass with a thin white head having very active bubbles running through the body. The aroma of this beer had a very distinctive lemon nose to it and a bit malty. The taste was a pleasing toasted malty presentation and some citrus in the background. With a medium body, I found this beer to be pretty drinkable but not overwhelming."
"Drinkability - no show-stopper but certainly easy to drink."
"D - This is a joy to drink. The maltyness and yeastyness play off each other."
"Taste was malty and fruity with just a little bit of hop bitterness. I could taste some notes of caramel and a candyish taste in the finish. This beer seemed rather thin to me and not very complex in the aroma or flavor. This was a 2005 bottle, so maybe it requires a few months of aging."
"The Cooper's Vintage Ale poured a dark cloudy brown color. It smelled of strong hops and spice. The carbonation was high for most beers, but felt fairly moderate for Cooper's. The body of the beer was fairly heavy, it is a very strong ale. The hops were prominent, just as in the smell. And it had a strong finish with the ample taste of spice. This was an interesting beer. It was delicious while drinking it, but I really don't see someone drinking a lot of it. The spice was really strong, and my girlfriend said said it tasted of soy sauce, which I can kinda see(it was not a bad thing , just a really spicy finish)."
"d: Quite easy to drink and I'd definitely buy more. Not quite a session star - the high ABV makes this a one-or-two only affair."
"I dont recommend this one too much not bad but just not really doing it for me. I drank this alongside a few really really awesome barleywines so Ill review again when I am tasting it on its own."
"Coopers Extra Strong Vintage Ale reminds me of a higher alcohol English pale. It could use a tad more depth and assertiveness, but it's still a worthwhile beer that I found appealing. This is my favorite Coopers Brewery offering to date and has to be included in my top handful of Aussie beers as well."
"Mouthfeel is spiced, dry and lingering. Highly reccomended."
"Feel is soft carbonation. Nothing spectacular but that would be good if it strikes the mood. like a marzen."
"Poured a cloudy coopper copper coler with only modest slightly off-white head. Quickly fell to only thing ring.Has a nice fruity smell with the promise of great things to follow. The taste is truly extraordinary. Nice maltiness with a very strong fruitn character (dates, plums). Finish is very smooth, and although there is a distinct lack of carbonation, it ends nice and creamy. For a 7.5% beer, this is a suprisingly easy drinker."
"D - I'm at a bit of a loss with this one, as I haven't really encountered anything quite like it before. Much more drinkable, and enjoyable that it initially appears ... this ale is worth a try for sure. It's complexity and elusiveness in being easily identifyable is a virtue in this case, I believe. I wonder what it would be like with the heavy sediment removed altogether ...? I suspect this is a good part of it's appeal however. A worthy, although odd, ale. I can honestly say I like it and would drink it again ... and since I have 2 more bottles, I intend to do just that."
"overall- this isnt a bad beer, just not very good. its pretty easy to drink, but i just dont get much pleasure drinking it."
"Overall, i think this one is certainly one to try, but one i really need to be in the mood for to have again. Especially the price. Where i got it, it was $20 a six pack (although that place is always expensive). luckily they sold it singly or i wouldnt have tried it."
"Drinkability: Just a few too many flaws here and there to be very good; I'm disappointed as I had high hopes for this Aussie; is this supposed to be a malt liquor?"
"This is a complete mess-up. I can't think of anything positive about this brew. Riddled with off-flavors, looks horrible, acrid mouthfeel, bad drinkability...it's all there. Definitely pass on this one, it totally sucks."
"Drinkability: I'm more than impressed by this brew, especially for the seemingly lower end reviews (meaning many significantly lower than a total of 4), but I think this is complex, satisfying, original, tasty, and altogether a great drinking experience. Make sure you decant properly if you're not a big sediment fan, though, because like Smuttynose IPA, there's tons, and it'll make its way into the glass if you're not careful. Then I ask: what did the four years do? I guess it has to be good things. Either way, I'll be getting more of this, and even if you're a bit wary, you should try it for sure."
"Drinkability... damn good. I will have to get another one and cellar it until the date on the bottle."
"Easy-drinking and utterly undistinguished."
"Is it a good beer .? I dont think it is"
"Coopers Extra Strong Vintage Ale comes in a vintage looking bottle, and pours a deep mahogany brown, yet cloudy colour with a humongous head that crowns up over the glass without spilling over. The label indicates 7.5% alcohol and that they achieve it from choice malts and an extended top fermentation. The smell is a combination of aged, toasted malt and the sharpness of alcohol. The first taste to greet you is the sharpness of the high alcohol content. Its not particularly well hidden, especially for only being 7.5-percent. The second taste is a toasted malty pseudo-sweetness followed, again, by the alcohol dryness. Mouthfeel is quite good, body-wise and carbonation-wise, but post-swallow, the alcohol can get to you. Its not as easy-drinking beer as you would hope, and the dryness becomes a bitterness. To sum up, I wont buy this beer again. Although it looks pretty nice, and smells pretty good, Coopers makes their Extra Strong Vintage Ale seem like the 12% Belgian that doesnt balance out the high alcohol content. The only problem is that Coopers Extra Strong is 7.5% alcohol and does a poor job of balancing it out. All the more disappointing. I adore their sparkling ale and stout, but this beer is not one of their best."
"but this is not a bad sipper, especially if you want something a bit different."
"D: a quite strong beer, it somehow is quite restrained and simplistic in terms of overall flavour. Still, this is a nice beer to savour once in a while."
"CHEERS! Beertracker"
"Nice drinkable beer here but I think I can find better."
"The beer pours a dark amber color with loads of floaties and a thick frothy offwhite head that fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a traditional English ale scent, which is sweet, but with a bisquity aroma. It's bitter with a slight warmth and some burnt toffee character. The taste is decent. It has a smooth toffee flavor with a slight warmth and residual sweetness. The mouthfeel is average. It is a medium/full bodied beer with less than adequate carbonation. This is a pretty good beer. I haven't had any exceptional beers from these guys, but they all drink pretty well."
"Swirlling up the yeast and other sediments in the last few ounces, I found it to be agreeable to the taste and wonder about the concern others have had re. this issue."
"Body could use some beef, but is still medium. Mouthfeel is creamy and quite smooth with fine, pin point carbonation."
"12 ounce twist off bottle. 4-OCT/2002. $3 at OUAV in Richmond, VA."
"It pours an amber color with a small head that falls away quickly and doesn't leave any lacing on the glass. The aroma is sweet and spicy with some distant malt character. The flavor has a nice malt base, slightly raisiny and it also has a warming alcohol sinsation. Not really my favorite style. The mouthfeel was moderate and the drinkability was just ok because of the apparent alcohol."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, smooth with a nice punch of carbonation. For a strong ale this is a good drinking brew. I could sit down and enjoy a few of these after a hard days work. Recommended."
"A stand-up brew. Would go great with a heaping serving of heavily spiced apple cobbler and a scoop of vanilla ice cream."
"I first had this beer at a bar in North Adelaide, Australia. Was a very special brew, as it was ""expensive"" and therfore really good back then. I've seen it around and have been looking for a single, which I finally found. It pours an oranged light brown color with a small coat of head over top. The nose is slightly raisiney, almost woody/oaky, with a tea-like tanniny quality to it. The flavor is slightly spicey, very slightly raisiney, with hints of tanniney wood. I like it. I was right to enjoy it back in the birthplace of this brew. The feel is moderate to thick with a moderate carbonation. I really don't get any of the 7.5% alcohol. This is a mighty fine beer. Really brings back some memories to this young beer drinker."
"Drinkability- This one was very tasty and went down super easy. At $2.79 per, this one was worth it for sure."
"Drinkability & Notes: Wow, very tasty  nice bite from the hops with the lingering spicy alcohol to complement. Went great with a plate of lamb & veal ragu over fusilli."
"Treat with care and you'll enjoy..."
"Pours a hazy amber orange color that is topped by a thin tan colored head, with a medium level of carbonation. The aroma is malty with some weird almost vegetal notes, as well as notes of alcohol, cleaning solution, caramel. The beer is sweet, quite well carbonated and has subtle oxidation notes of sherry. In some ways it is quite light on the palate. The taste is much more agreeable than the aroma hinted at. This is definitely slanted on toward the malty side of the spectrum, in some ways it even reminds me of diluted malt extract. Certainly interesting, and I am glad that I picked this up, but I think that it might be a bit more malty and fresh tasting if it was a bit younger."
"Poured out a cloudy medium brown with very little head, just a ring really, and less lace. Smell is smoke, malt, wood, green apples, raisins and hops. Taste is smoke, malt, green apple, raisins, peat, hops and alcohol (late to the party and not a bloom so much as just a presence). Mouthfeel is very rich, smooth, full bodied with an effervescence all over the mouth and tongue but biased to the tip. Warms the throat nicely. Drinkability is very high. The flavor is very complex and well balanced both to the nose and the tongue. I will be drinking this again."
"Sadly, the nasty looking crap at the bottom of the glass makes you not want to finish it, which really affects drinkability."
"Flavor is sweet ripe fruit and brown sugar with some toffee too. No real alcohol presence. Beer goes down very easy and smooth, but the finish is a little empty. Not the best brew for aging I think, even with the hype on the label."
"375 ml bottle batch # 4-OCT/2002 pours hazy with chunks of yeast floating around, orange amber color with a fluffy white head that lasts. Spicy, fruity, yeasty aroma. Spicy and peppery pear and oak flavor. Medium body with a crisp and snappy mouthfeel, finishes with some dryness."
"Extra Strong Vintage Ale: batch no. 4-Oct/2002. This beer poured a cloudy, transluscent amber/gold. The head was small and ephemeral and there was no lace. The subdued aroma contained traces of citrus, toffee and a wisp of alcohol. Other than a strong hop bite there was little to the taste except some toffee and a little sweetness. The finish was plain, just a bit sweet and dry. I guess I was expecting more and so I was disappointed with this Coopers' offering."
"Appearance: Hazy amber with big floating chunks suspended, awesome cream colored head nice size leaves specks of lacing. Aroma: Big malty layer of fruity undertones semicitrusy hop notes bready yeast and raisin sweetness along with an alcohol tone that just creeps in. Taste: Rich fruity ale with bready notes nice spicy layer excellent beer especially when compared to Coopers other ales. Mouthfeel: Medium body nice mild carbonation semi syrupy texture coats the palate. Drinkability: Excellent with my smoked BBQ chicken, but an all around solid strong old ale, can't have too many but this one was a treat."
"D&N: Batch no. 04Oct2002. Smooth drinking, very complex, a real pleasure to drink, but I wouldn't want to have more than one or two at a time, this is a pretty strong beer. Very nicely done, and I'm glad I had it. Yum."
" Very drinkable and quietly complex in its own way. Alcohol is very well hidden."
"I guess I was expecting more from a ""vintage"" ale, one that was advertised as able to age well. The label recommended this beer be consumed within 18 months so I was catching it right near the end of that time limit. Still, it appeared to not have held up all that well. Word of advice: if you don't want a mass of sediment in your beer, pour this one very carefully."
"2000 Vintage - It is a copper/amber color with a thin wisp of a head. The aroma was weak with some fruit notes. I have not tasted this beer when it was fresh so I have no frame of reference to compare it. It is malty and creamy, but it seems that any hop character has all but disappeared. It is a mellow beer that goes smooth and easy, but is just average in taste."
"I won't be buying this again, unless I have reason to believe that I got a bunk bottle or they move to another recipe."
"Pours with a off-white two-fingered head that stays and leaves a good lace. Cloudy amber color and loaded with chunky bits. Pour this slowly. Batch No. 4-Oct/2002. It has aged well. Starts sweet and finishes sweet with just a hint of hops. $16.99 for a 6-pack of 375ml bottles. $2.99 for one 375ml bottle from Liquorama Upland, Ca."
"Really impressed with how this has aged. At 3 it is looking strong and should have a few more years to go...thankfully this is the first of 6! A great winter beer that seems to get a lot more going on a it starts to warm up. (4)"
"Approximate duration of aging in bottle: 13.5 to 14 months."
"Also in hind sight I should of been more careful pouring this. Because expeariance should have warned me. My very first Coopers was a Stout MANY years ago and it had about 3 tablespoons of sediment on the bottom of that bottle."
"always good when coopers put this out. its a very nice strong ale and while the 2002 isnt necessarily the best it definately improves with age."
"Overall: This one has clearly aged well and according to those in the now, is ideally at its best after 18 months. Judging by how good this was, I cannot disagree with them. Quite simply, the best Aussie beer that I have yet had."
"A nice translucent golden amber color on the pour, the head modest in size, light tan in color, the lace fine sheets that cover the glass. The aroma of malt dominates the nose, a tad brandy like, fresh, crisp and somewhat sweet, pleasing in its own right. Sweet malt start, top middling in feel, finish pleasantly acidic, hops purposeful in their spiciness, dry linger aftertaste, and a ""Damn"" good drinking beer."
"Rich and creamy yet with a thin to medium body for the style. Tingly carbonation."
"Update  I had a 2002 in 2005 and really enjoyed this beer opened up. Theres a yeasty background to the nose (less so at the taste) with some leafy bitterness just for good measure. Its malted up after three years of storage and isnt bad. I raised a few ratings that upped the Overall score by 0.30."
"This is a bit weak for an Extra Strong ""Vintage"" Ale, although it's not bad if it had been named Coopers Fairly Good Ale. It pours a mud puddle brown with a thin beige head. The aroma is balanced between sweet malt and fruit, with a mild alcohol fuminess. The full sweet malt is slightly nutty with a faint taste of butterscotch. A lime-like citrusy bitterness is mellowed by apple, pear and hint of banana flavors. The alcohol is noticeable throughout, though never overpowering. Nice little bits of yeasty goodness float around like snow globes."
"Medium brown gold color, medium head. Full bodied ale. Malty and fairly hoppy. Somewhat fruity, with a very strong dry finish. Very nice balance. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is very dry. Aftertaste is slightly malty. Finish is more champagne like than beer. Interesting beer. Some alcohol bite at 7.1%"
"This is a unique and very active beer with an attractive golden/amber color. It is very complex with a lot of fizz and a fruity cider smell. It is shameless in its quantity of sediment -- the chunks are just rolling around in the glass. The mouthfeel is smooth yet finishes with a nice bite. This beer is very pleasant, easy to drink and has a lot of great qualities. It is a little pricey, but is worth enduring the sticker shock. In the end, I felt a little disappointed that I really liked a beer with a twist off cap."
"An intersting, but not captivating, beer. It became much less enjoyable as the alcohol smell and taste took over. I have one of these set aside for aging that I will try in a year or two to see how it has changed. However, I don't think that this brew is big enough to age well for very long."
"If this is Cooper's ""top of the line", I'm unimpressed. All of thier ales have a sour skunkiness that doesn't appeal to me. It's unfortunate, because the fruity taste underneath is pleasant enough. This one looks like swamp water, with the color and floaties. Has a weird smell, and unusual taste. The overall effect isn't bad, but for what is supposed to be a vintage beer, certainly nothing special."
"This mahogany brown-with-orange colored brew has a bulbous, sticky tan head. The head quickly fades to a thin film of bubbles, but actually produces nice lace. Theres a lot of sediment, including large, free-floating clumps of yeast. Also, Id say theres a large amount of carbonation, which is (at times) audible. The aroma is intensely fruity (pear, banana, apple), with a little malt. The mouthfeel is dominated by the carbonationthe beer has potential for a nice, creamy texture, but the fizz keeps getting in the way. Taste is sweet and malty, but lacks depth and complexity. You can detect the alcohol, but it doesnt seem to play that big a roll in the flavor. All in all, its really not what I look for in a barleywine."
"I was kind of disappointed in this, but I think I set my hopes about it a little too high before I tried it. Pours a reddish brown, with no head and little carbonation. Dark malts in the aroma, but very little trace of hops, which surprised me. Has a somewhat nutty flavor mingling with a warming alcohol, but the mouthfeel is really really thin. Warming and not bad drinker, but not worth seeking out."
"Coarse, fizzy head that had little staying power beyond a tiny bit of sticky lace. The body itself was cloudy amber with orange highlights. Chewy, toasted malt and toffee abounds in the nose, and those were mirrored in the taste. While there was no sign of hops aroma, there was a palate cleansing bitterness up front with the malt. The body was a little too thin and the finish cut short by seltzer flavor. It was a shame because it had so much potential. The 7.1% ABV did little besides warm the throat, so this beer would possibly get my vote for heavy hitting session beer of the month."
"However, for something touted as EXTRA, and SPECIAL, and STRONG, I was disappointed. Perhaps, as they pledge, this ""vintage"" will improve with time. It was just ""okay"" for now, though."
"Swampy ice tea appearance, with small chunks of yeasties. Head is minimal and lasts about 25 seconds. Aroma is of a Heath Bar, toffee-ish. Very candy-like flavors, some chocolate and buttery diacetyls, a touch of shortbread as it approaches the back of the mouth.. Hops do a good job countering any tendency toward over-sweetness. Well done, Coopers...not a killer but a fine and satisfying brew here."
"I was completely underwhelmed, not disgusted just disappointed."
"The amber colored brew throws out a nice head, albeit fizzy.  Carbonation is evident in the glass, with CO2 surfacing rapidly in the form of tiny bubbles.  A sour/fruity mix on the nose.  This beer is really lacking for any distinguishible qualities on the taste buds.  Surprising for a Strong/Vintage ale.  There are some light nuances of fruity character.  A little herbal tea like character.  sIf something good can be said about this beer, it's that the alcohol taste is absent in a 7.1 a/v brew.  Very drinkable for that level of alcohol."
"Pours a slightly cloudy bronze color; the head is solid.  Pretty dominate caramel aroma with a touch of red apple tones.  On the palate big caramel malt flavor upfront, red apple tones in the background which creates a tiny sweetness / sourness (very light), and maybe slightly toasted light bread.  The mouth feel is extremely smooth.  Overall I thought this was balanced to perfection, excellent sweetness, and the 7.1% abv. is hardly detectable.  Just overall enjoyable, easy to drink, smooth, and refreshingbut a bit high in price, but I assure you it is worth a try."
"Just slightly above average in all departments, i was expecting more, but i guess it wasn't to bad in the end, hope it imroves in the next few years."
"Brewed in 2000 and released after an extended maturation period. The 375ml bottle states: ""Contains approximately 2.1 standard drinks."" Muddy brown ale with soft, sticky head, with lager-like sparkling qualities that is trademark for Coopers. Surprisingly refreshing with an apple-y tartness in the middle, spritzy malty finish. Still some nice hop presence; not bitter or licorice-y like some older beers, but nicely buttery. Very tasty, seems slightly watered-down - a testament to its drinkability, but is that appropriate for the style? Otherwise superb."
