"Okay, so I picked up a 22 of this from Old Farm in Frederick because they had it on a sale for $1.89 a bottle. Hell, the bottle is worth a buck to me to homebrew so how the hell can the beer not be worth 89 cents. Had to try a few of the Minhas beers. Pretty good looking beer, but not sure what I am smelling. But I have had beers with no nose that were tasty. Well, not so much, not the worst beer I have ever had but certainly not what I would call good. The funny thing is that I am trying to figure out if I would buy more for the bottles and the alcohol, I mean, $1.89. Nah, rather save a little liver mileage for something else. That said, gonna use the bottle so nothing lost."

"Looks a lot better than it drinks!"

"This beer was less than expected. At the pour I had thought i stumbled on a gem. Poured a dark mahogany with off white head. That's where the gem lost its luster. The smell was biscuit and banana. . .(strong banana). The initial mouth feel was quite pleasing but the finish was metallic. Struggling. To finish, maybe it needs to age longer, maybe the sink need a drink.... i may have it again, if given...won't be buying this again.(even though i did get it for $2.50)."

"Poured from a brown 22 oz. bottle. Has a pretty mahogany color with a 1 inch head. Smell is sweet, malty, some dark fruits. Taste is of malts, sweet, kind of mild compared to the smell, a little bit of alcohol is present. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a decent beer."
""
"Overall bleh. Poorly done beer, tastes like an adjunct beer that was oxidized and brewed mostly with corn syrup and straw."
"O - Overall this was uhh meh. Just mediocre. Really not worth the money."
""
"O=If you are throwing a beer tasting party and want bombers to sample to start out newbies, this would be an outstanding example to serve to show newbies of what a slightly above average beer is. Should pair good with food...if this were available in 7 oz. shorties, I'd buy again...but otherwise, I would only buy if under $1 a bottle."

"Pours a solid dark brown with ruby highlights when held to light and a huge tan head that persists forever. Smells of toffee and brown sugar with an earthy mineral edge to provide some balance. Light caramel and a hint of chocolate round out the nose. The flavor is a bit sweet with a heavy toffee and caramel up front. There's a weird back and forth between malt and earthy mineral and metallic flavors that sustains for most of the flavor curve. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet mineral water mouthfeel. Not a bad beer, and it grew on me a bit after it warmed up. I probably wouldn't try it again, but thanks for the opportunity Dave."
"I was surprised others scored this beer so low, and looking at some of their comments I think they got bad batches. Poured a 1"" beige head of decent lifespan. The body is a deep dark burnt umber brown, even held up to the light. It smells very mildly of roasted malt. So far at this point it's very typical. But then the taste blew me away. A delicious complex sweet roasted malt with hints of cola and hopping reminding me of some English ales. And this was a pretty decent value for price. I could drink it all day."
"Overall, I did not like this beer at all. I am struggling to finish it."

"Okay, these mice have had way too much blood tea... Anyway, this stuff pours a clear dark ruby-garnet topped by a finger of sandy khaki foam. The nose comprises sweet caramel, dry biscuit, and ruby red grapefruit syrup. The taste holds notes of dank tobacco, stale toffee, bad tomatoes, and menthol. Wow, this went steeply downhill very quickly. Ugh, it honestly hurts to drink, and the flavors malinger for what seems like decades. Bad combination. The body is a very light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a watery feel. Overall, another nice-looking and horrid-tasting beer today. Just not my day..."

"This one poured out darker than I expected. The beer looks to be a deep brown color with a fizzy white colored head on top. The smell of the beer has some light malt aromas, some spice and hints of molasses. The taste of the beer is sweet upfront with some roasted notes and it actually had a nice bitter finish to it. The mouthfeel was drinkable, still a bit on the thin side but not terrible. Overall this is the best brew I got to try while at Minhas. I'm glad I got to finally see what all the Anti-Hype was that my friend Traci was telling me about this brewery."
""
"O - For some reason did not expect much, but pleasantly surprised. Very pleasant and easy drinking beer."
""
"Strong tea tannins pair with cocoa and a rich toasted caramel backbone with an herbal bitterness. This works well for an English Style."

"Ultimately not really a beer to seek out, and as a budget buy, at nearly $6 locally its not much cheaper than craft bombers or sixers that taste much better... if people are paying less than $3 for this, i've been ripped off :("
"O:  Th claim of this mystical creature has fallen short delivery an easter bunny rather than a powerful fierce creature of myth and legend.  This ale is not entirely bad but truly bland and not as complex as should be. The hops are timid and the malts are not bold either. For what it is, a $3 bomber, I can appreciate it.  However, a great ASA it is not.  "
"Clear reddish brown with some fizzy bubbles that lingered and formed a slid cap. Balance of sweetness and hops in the aroma and flavour - hints of mint and bread with some currant and date fruitiness. Medium body and carbon dioxide with decent texture. Solid."

"The best of the four from Minhas we've had, but that's not saying a whole lot."

"Poured a dark brown color with 1.5 fingers of soapy tan head with little to no retention and lace. Smells of toasted malt and bootstrap molasses mostly, perhaps an extremely ghostly whiff of earthy hops, making me re-check the label and goggle in wonder at the ""80 IBU"" printed on the bottle. I'm not really sure I believe that claim... Flavor is sickly molasses sweet, also vacant of the espoused 80 IBUs on the label, but has a disturbing metallic finish on the strangely astringent monotonous grain flavor. For a strong ale, I was expecting a hell of a lot more complexity than what I received here... Texture is just medium bodied, carbonation actually is fitting for support (not too much nor too little) but problems exist within what is being supported..."
"O-I would clasify this as one of the best bang for your buck beers I have ever had. I do not normally drink ASA's, but I may have to give this beer more shots in my beer rotation."
"O- Very surprised by this beer, the perfect Strong Ale for someone who wants to try the style or someone who's new to craft beer in general. The price really can't be beat either, especially for the style. For 2.39$ I would definitely buy this again. I especially love this beer since it's from such a small local brewery here in wisconsin. A great cheep beer."
"O- This has some barleywine and stout characteristics with nice rich toffee notes and good support with the yeast character. The bitterness is a bit too strong but the alcohol and sweetness counteract it."
"Overall: This is probably the one I like best of the bombers I have had from the Minhas Brewery. Give it a try< and I'm sure you'll be, atleast somewhat, satisfied."

"An oddly appealing beer with a heavy emphasis on sweetness, without full maltiness. This leaves me wanting much more malt crispness and less raw sweetness. The claimed high hopping rates also leave me wanting more."
"Wow, it started off so well, what could have gone wrong? I'll tell you - Minhas has found a new way to fuck with me - instead of obviously flaw-ridden, bottom of the barrel lagers, they're now pushing pseudo-craft offerings, which ring with the same sensibility as BMC's similar ilk (and they're in bombers, to boot!). This one looks good, smells decent enough, and then, whooosh - through the trap door you go. Like my previous experience with their, heh, chocolate stout, the aphorism ""lipstick on a pig"" was never more apt, and to play into their label chicanery: no, I wish that this beer was not for real, cheapest bomber around or not."
