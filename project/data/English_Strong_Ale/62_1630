Half finger of white head and more than average lacing long after. The nose is of heavy malt, bread, syrup, and strawberry or raspberry I can't quite tell. The taste is nothing of memorable quality, strong alcohol taste (almost rubbing alcohol), malt, and burnt syrup. The mouthfeel is thin and definitely minimal carbonation.

4,2,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a relatively dark amber with a light beige head. The head sticks around for a medium length of time. Little lacing. The aroma is rich with deep caramel malt flavor. It's doughy and sweet. Toffee, shortbread, raisins, prunes, dates, syrup. It's a rich muddling of toasted malt sugar. There's some booze in the aroma and a bit more in the taste, but once the beer hits the proper temperature, it contributes more warmth than harshness. The taste is otherwise quite sweet, but the hops are more apparent than in the aroma and, besides providing some respite from the caramel, adds in a mineral/grassy note. The mouthfeel is full and thick for a 7% abv beer. This is an interesting beer. Before it had a chance to warm up, the booze seemed to come out in excess. At cellar to room temp, the sweetness shined and the booze blended into the beer. Good stuff.","popery","Nov 28, 2012"

Probably not a trade bait type beer, but certainly a moderately complex and very well balanced one. Despite being decent sized at 7%, it drinks whacked easy.

Pours an attractive red-amber color with a finger of head. The aroma is rather sweet, with caramel and butterscotch malts, along with some floral hops. The taste has that sweet toffee malt kinda thing going along, with a substantial floral English hop presence. Aftertaste is fairly non-existant, which is the biggest knock I have against this beer. The mouthfeel is heavier bodied for an English ale, and is very lightly carbonated. Overall, a nice strong ale. Bring the rest of them on!","shand","Feb 20, 2012"

Pours to a deep bronze with a micro-bubble foamy head. The taste is a kicked up brown ale flavor with a nice noble hop bite. The AC is slightly evident in the lingering but smooth bitter finish. Mouthfeel is good with a nice sparky carbonation to augment the hop bite. This is a very high IBU special ale and is indeed quite tasty. A great drinker but the 7% probably sneaks up fast.

I could have dropped a golf ball between the bubbles. At first this had an odd, Flemish-sour bend to it, but that disappeared after it warmed up a bit (relative to its initial temperature). Plenty of hops in the nose, along with vanilla, cherries and a burlappy smell that reminded me of a warm barn. Hops were mild in the taste; malt was dominant with fruit and figs, and the whole thing was very, very dry. Tasty indeed, but I have a suspicion that this might be better a bit colder from a bottle.","gfreed","Nov 07, 2010"

The nose comprises vodka-soaked buttery biscuits, light rye bread, and a smidgen of orange rind. Interesting turn; let's see where it leads. The taste strips away some of the booze, which is replaced by a stronger version of the orange peel. Everything else remains fairly static from nose to tongue. (...Now, that's an image, am I right?) The body is on the heavier side of medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly syrupy feel.

It is very malty, but I can sense that there are some hops in there. They don't really come through in the flavor, but there add some balance to this beer. How ever small a hop presence it might be without it I would easily confuse this beer with a Wee Heavy. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with moderate carbonation, and a velvety texture.

There's a touch of bubblegum and more of that floral sweetness. After the initial acclimation you pick up the dry hop aftermath. I don't feel this is very complex, there's not much to say.

Nose suggests caramel and dark fruit (perhaps fig and/or prunes). Taste consistent with nose for the most part, but there is a strange, chemical aftertaste detectable at the finish, that lingers between quaffs. Also a little bit of alcohol heat comes out in the mix. Mouthfeel falls between light-and medium-bodied, but carbonation is a little prickly and there's a lingering bitterness at the finish.

Aroma contains tart fruit notes namingly some cherry and wood essence with an air of anise. Almost a cidery character to it in my opinion, again with more barrel notes. Flavors are wild with a front to back barrage of tart fruit, alcohol and wood aged caramel with anise spiced booziness. Caramelized brown sugar and strong alcohol flow together in the finish tickling the nose hairs just a bit but the body is a simple syrup texture with light carbonation that doesn't catch you until the back of the throat, really interesting definitely hard to describe. Drinkability overall this is a bit of a strange bird and it definitely screams a unique New England quality. I'm assuming that part, I've never traveled that far to the Northeast but again worth a try holds a special place in my beer memory and I saw it in Virginia had to pick up a bottle.

The bouquet is big on floral hops, with toasted, caramel, and maybe buttery malts, some candy sweetness, and a touch of apple - nice, but it could be more aromatic. It has a big toasted and caramel malt flavor, with diacetyl, dark fruits, and hints of molasses and alcohol. There are also floral/perfumy and citric hops that impart a medium bitterness, and are almost abrasive at the back of the throat. Quite smooth, medium in body and carbonation, and it leaves a long finish. Good beer - English malting, but American-level hopping - kinda reminded me of a hoppier Eye of the Hawk.

Nice enough, to be sure, but nothing to write home about. The aroma is full of dark fruit. Dense prune and raisin scents, with some banana and pear thrown in for good measure. Malty and fruity aroma for the most part, but with some spices as well; maybe some coriander, or something akin to that, and a hint of pepper. The taste is quite pleasant. A very nice balance of fruit and spice, with the kiss of hops making themselves known in the end. Boozy, but not overwhelmingly alcoholish. At 7% ABV, this is, perhaps, to be expected. Crisp, clean mouthfeel, but still sturdy. I wouldn't call this a highly drinkable beer, but it is an entirely drinkable beer, if that makes sense. Not for the faint of heart, and not for everyone, the Geary's HSA is a tasty treat for spicy malt beer fans.

I detect lots of malt, caramel, wheatiness, some hops, maybe some spices. This is a pretty syrupy, full bodied beer, sort of sticky consistency with moderate carbonation. The taste is quite strong for a 7 ABV. I thought it had a higher ABV just from the alcohol tones which are present throughout. The taste is caramel, some orange, some spice, malt, and bitterish hops. This is a complex beer with lots going on, but a little on the bitter side for my tastes. There is some imbalance towards the hops and the alcohol taste is a bit too strong for this one. The aftertaste is also quite bitter and the esters of the hops do come through as well. Good but not my favorite either.","albern","May 04, 2007"

A little bready, toasty, estery middle, and a hint of alcohol. Medium bodied, lowish carbonation, slightly grainy texture with a bit of warmth at the end. Very nice.

3.82,-2.6,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Pours an intense rubied orange hue, with a scummy thin head despite the rousing pour into a chalice glass. No lacing. The aroma is intense and complex--a sweet intense caramel malt aroma, fruits and dark syrups, alcohol and some hop aromas, but dominated by a complex fruity sweetness. The taste is unique, malty, and intense, english style with spicy malts and a fruity sweetness--a bit alcoholic, but it's hidden in the mix and not a swash across the palate. The hops are present, oh yes, spicy and resinous flavors linger. The key word for this beer is complex, but after a few sips, you loose that complexity and taste that it's too sweet, with a hoppy compliment. Moutheel is light for this style, but not water. More body would definitely make this more enjoyable drinking, and a bit carbonated for me, but thats nothing a harder pour couldn't remedy for my preferences. Overall, I like this beer, and seeing as I don't much care for strong ales, this is a winner. I can indeed imagine it being even better than it is, but it's a solid drinker that is not hard to locate, and that's always a plus for a local good-drinking brew.","Liquids","Feb 01, 2007"

There are not many beer that can have full flavor, warmth, and yet retain ultimate drinkability. There is enough going on in this beer to keep me interested all night, and the finish always makes me want another. The seven percent is too high to be the best "session" beer, but the warmth is certainly appreciated in the cold months. Its looks are ok, a copper beer with a small off-white head that laces a bit but does not last for that long. The nose is oak butter with a couple golden leaves of earthy hop. The taste is strong, complex, and all good. Resiny with some alcohol heat. Medium-big bodied, but not sticky. Finishes in a sweet-candy/bitter-flower-petal warmth.

The STRONG, warming alcohol tinge to go with hints of molasses and smokey maple syrup in both the nose and the mouth make this beer a flavor-filled monster . Amost like an ultra-malty version of an American IPA. Be careful, this will pretty much kill your palette, but it's well matched with strong cheeses and rye bread.

The malt is giving me caramel with a rich toffee, almost buttery tone as well. The hops blend really well into the malt, but I get some citrusy notes from those. Very rich flavor, like a super rich caramel floods my taste buds. There is a fantastic hop bitterness dncing on my tongue after swallowing the beer. Good good and good. The beer is thick, but not as thick as I would have expected. This is a trade-off in my book, as it increases the drinkability. For the full flavor, this beer is very drinkable.

The initial aroma was of sharp spices and maple malts. There's also a touch bitter of hops back there somewhere as well. The mouthfeel is luscious--a medium thickness offset by modest carbonation. The taste is reasonably well balanced; there a syrupy cherry and pear sweetness at the start, but it fades quickly as the hops kick in, and the finish is rather tart.

The head was very small at its apex, it might have reached a 1/4th of a finger in height; it faded quickly to a thin soapy collar. The lacing was absent. The nose had some lovely depth; there was a mix of light citrus juiciness, sweet maltiness, a hint of biscuit, buttery-toffee, a faint note of woody-alcohol. The potency is modest but the bouquet is inviting nevertheless. The palate is down right tasty! The toasty caramel malt really stands out in this offering; it is rich and deep with just enough of a hint of biscuit. When the buttery-toffee notes mixed in, all I can say is, wow! The fruitiness was mild and interwoven perfect, citrus and honey soaked berries. The bite of hops is surprisingly burly, no Im not talking West Coast hoppy but it is nicely aggressive. The persuasion of alcohol is very faint. The palate is well-rounded and tremendously gratifying to quaff. Medium in body, the carbonation is low and natural, mouthfeel is a tickle thin; maybe I am knit picking. HSA is a relaxing beer; it fits comfortably like an old pair of slippers. I see why this beer is so respected, it is very agreeable. If I had this beer available locally I would treasure it like gold, a thank you goes out to Bierman9 for the sample.

Taste is initially sweet and carmely, with the fruit coming in towards the middle. Finish is surprisingly hoppy and bitter, amazing how well the hops were hidden at first tast. This is a different beer, fairly well balanced but just tipping to the malty side of the scale.

It pours a deep reddish-copper color with one finger of head. There is almost no lacing left on the glass. The smell is slight alcohol and sweet caramel and malt, a fairly full nose. The taste is fairly sweet at first, with little bits of toffee and dates, then finishes with a little hops bitterness and alcohol. The mouthfeel is fairly thick and heavy on the tongue. The drinkability is pretty darn good for a 7% brew. I definately need to go back and pick up the rest of those lonely 6-packs from the beer store floor!","SheepNutz","Oct 25, 2003"

3.37,-14,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,"A very violent pour is the only way to get a lasting head on this puppy. The buttery flavors of the ringwood are strongly dominant and a little bit goes a long way. Malts and hops are diminished because of it. There are some interesting fruity undercurrents, some intriguing spiciness which I think is derived from the alcohol, and the malts (if you can discern them buried underneath all the butterscotch) are sturdy, salty and delicious. I would love a bit more crispness from a more forceful hop presence. Other reviewers have mentioned a fair amount of hoppiness, but I'm not getting any of it. The sweetness and butteriness of this beer gets cloying, especially as it warms; I preferred it at a cold right-out-of-the-fridge temperature, unusual for this style of beer. This is not a bad beer but I think it is overrated. That said, it does grow on you and each bottle tastes better than the last. Perhaps a fresher bottle, or a cask-conditioned pint, or even a more wintery setting would enlighten me as to why this beer basks in universal acclaim.","Thrasher","Jun 22, 2003"

3.8,-3.1,4,4,3.5,3,4.5,"2002 - 2003 edition. Garnet hue with a light chill haze. Almond white, thin, but well retained head leaves loose lace. Mellow, strawberry like esters with a tinge of fig along with smooth, medium lovibond caramel and sweet biscuit. Damply floral, lightly perfumed hop nose. Trace butterscotch and bubblegum esters arise with a swirl. Deeply toasty, borderline tannic, amber - like malt sweetness is perceived at first in flavor, then is ensued by notes of burnt caramel and dry, roasted, sugared pecans. Subdued fruitiness of a berryish, red licorice nature emerges mid palate along with mild diacetyl, lending an odd, yet agreeable buttered and candied fruit impression. A touch shy in residual dextrins and / or over attenuated. Passably smooth in mouthfeel, but no more. Earthy, humus like hop flavor. Finishes with a lingering, cleanly bittersweet toffee and hop bitterness combination. A flavorful, well rounded strong ale, with a pronounced biscuit presence. The slight astringent note upfront prevents Hampshire S.A. from reaching its full potential. Tasty, but not outstanding. The relative high strength goes nearly unnoticed, and aids in the brew's fine dinrkability. Thanks to Mainebeerman for the sample.","marc77","May 30, 2003"

The head was thick and creamy, the color that was produced was a French vanilla crème that was fairly sticky and left a sticky lace behind. The aromas that came from the glass were of malts, sweet fruits (berries, slight oranges), caramel, light flowers and I also noticed a very, very, very slight metallic hint at the end, not horrible just there. The flavors that came from the beer were of dark fruits, (berries, plums, and some raisins) caramel, hops, sweet malt, flowers, and a creamy sensation like you get from butter. This beer was surprisingly complex, when the first pour and sip was taken I thought it was fairly simple, but the more I poured and tasted the flavors seemed to arise and become more complex.

The nose displays a lightly buttery caramel malt; some nice fruitiness (berries, citrus peel), and a touch of hops (Fuggles?). It's medium bodied with a fine, median carbonation that caresses the tongue - very nice! A rich maltiness that seems to derive from the Maris Otter varity dominates the flavor. It's caramelish with a mild touch of butter; fruity with light notes of orange, green raisins, plums, and cherry; and a touch of licorice that's probably created through a combination of sweetish malt and a somewhat minty hop flavor. It's rich malt is balanced by a bold bitterness; and it lays on the tongue in a long finish with malt, hops and fruit all making an appearance. Nicely complex!","NeroFiddled","Apr 11, 2003"

Powerfully hopped, then dry hopped for good measure. The maltiness rolls forward throughout the glass and begins to reveals a trace of berries and some smoothness. An unusual, but nice pine essence is long lasting. The alcohol is noticed, though not overly so. The creamy beige head lingers and nice lace is formed. As with all of D.L. Gearys brews, there sort of a raw wildness, like Maine itself. Its easy to picture a Norman Rockwell Maine coast pub scene in winter where the cheerful patrons are toasting one another with a frosty mug of Hampshire Special. Now that really warms the heart!

At different times I thought I tasted some nutty flavor or some pepper. The high alcohol is sneaky but a warming sensation is noticeable after a while.

Initial taste is of spicy hops, then makes way to a firm, but not overly malty sweetness, some very noticeable alcohol kick (not really annoying, however), and ending in a long bittersweet hop finish. Firm body with alot of carbonation that erupts on the tongue. The malt continues to hang in there for the finish, balancing with the spicy hop finale. No noticeable oxidation or diacetyl, fusel flavors. Think Sammy Boston Lager X 2...while good, it doesn't really do anything to excite me, and probably nothing I would seek out. Clean profile and well-done balancing act contribute to it's good drinkability despite it's modest ABV.","Mitchster","Jan 21, 2003"
