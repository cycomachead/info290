"Vanilla, spice, and a faint sherry note first engage the nose, and then light hop aromas, malt and slight caramel with a hint of fruit become more apparent. It pours brilliant copper amber under a fluffy 1” off white foam cap. The palate really highlights the oak in a masterful way with vanilla, a slight mustiness that suggests a bourbon with considerably less alcohol. Behind this lurks a nutty, graham cracker, fruity ESB flavors. Above average carbonation also masks the ESB qualities a little bit as does a creamy texture. The body is just above medium. Almost like a jazz riff on an ESB."

"The beer pours a nice, white head that borders between creamy and bubbly. The beer itself is a dark copper that borders on brown and is clear. The beer has very strong oak notes when it's cold but the vanilla beans really come through and work well with the oak, which gives a bit a of a nice spicy note to it. The malts come out but not as strongly and give an interesting sweetness to the bouquet. The taste is similar to the smell notes but that the oak is much stronger than the vanilla bean and the malts are fairly sweet. The notes combine to give off a roasted coconut taste, which is pretty good. The mouthfeel is very soft and smooth with biting carbonation. Overall, a very good and unique beer; one that I will definitely pick up."

"O: Should have never been bottled. I detect some spoilage here."
"a fun little beer here, very flavorful for an esb, lots of vanilla, lighter malts, and a toasted caramel sweetness towards the finish that is really nice. its oaky in a different way, this isn't in wine or bourbon, its new oak that still has a lot of its pop to it, sappy and full of flavor that's earthy and sweet, not tainted like some other alcoholic beverage. the wood goes great with the vanilla sweet malts and the effervescent carbonation makes it drink a lot lighter than it is. sweet flavor but does not stay sweet, the wood and English malt take over in a drying way. a light amber colored liquid that stays light even as it warms. a beautifully crafted beer rather fairly priced for what it is, about 10 bucks for a big bottle. get it if you can."

"Overall: Pretty good stuff for a sweeter style ale; like the balance and complexity"
"Oak in your face. Its a solid beer, nice caramel backboned strong ale, but as it warms it is just completely dominated by oak. I love barrell aged beers, but all I taste is barrell. Needs to either kick up the ABV, or tone down the barrell. It simply smells and tastes like a platform for oak."
""
"Overall: Overall, the phenolic character is too over-powering for me. However, after the initial taste of solventy-plastic is gone there is a nice floral sweetness left behind. The second taste sensation makes me want more though, and I did enjoy the whole glass."

"o - Overall a nice strong ale aged in oak barrels. It has some vanilla to it from the barrels which I liked. Not sure I'd want to drink a full bottle by myself, but splitting it with someone this winter would be nice."
"O: a highly driknable brew, that I would gladly buy again."
""
""
"O: Pretty much exactly as described. Tastes and smells like an ESB that's been oak aged but without the bitterness. Nice, clean crisp and balanced flavors. Relative simplicity keeps it from scoring higher but it's definitely a beer I enjoyed. Super malty and the drinkability is very high."
""
""
"Cheers!"
""
"Overall the beer is very drinkable but not overly memorable. No flaws but Im not wow'd either. Worth a shot if you like english strong ales, just not as complex as I hoped when I bought the bottle."
"O: Not a bad brew but maybe not something I’d seek out again. Flavors weren’t anything outstanding and the carbonation was a bit much."
""
"o: Unique is the best word to describe this. Everything I found in here was subtle and well incorporated. Thanks for the treat B and E."
""
"Sometimes I don't bother with writing about the mouthfeel, but this is a huge part of the beer. The carbonation instantly stings your tongue when you drink this. I like variety so I'm saying this is a positive."

"A very smooth and mellow beer with interesting and unique flavors. I want to like it, but I think it's a little too loose on the palate, maybe just some bittering hops to tighten things up. The oak is somewhat odd too, maybe not the right barrell or staves (or the right toast level) for this recipe. Worth a look if you liked Sam Smith Yorkshire Stingo."
"Overall the oak was really heavy and made the beer not enjoyable for me. I’d like to try the base beer for comparison as it seems like an interesting beverage, but the oak dashed any hopes of that."
"A lot of barrel age beers I've tried taste more like bourbon than beer. EOS has a nice balance between the beer and the barrel."
"O: Very impressive. I don't usually gravitate towards ESB's/ESA's but the oak ageing (and this brewerys' track record with me) made me really glad that Jax sent this along!"
"Overall this is a very good, well put together brew. Element brews cost a bit more than some, but they are definitely worth it."
"If you end up digging the overall buds offering, you'll also find it somewhat medium-full bodied yet somewhat light, easy to drink and refreshing. I thought it was alright - better maybe minus the above. I'd try it again w/o wood."
"D - Drinkability is high. Incredibly easy to put this down and the flavors keep enticing me back for more. The alcohol is non-existent and overall, just a finely crafted beer."
"Not too shy to show off its presentation of epic lacing and pale amber sheen. Oak, fruit, yeast tone, doughy biscuit and lemony hops are a great showing for an aroma. Heavy, silky smoothness. The malt and oak character intertwine so much and so deeply that they play off each other ... and compliment each other. Subtle hopping evens out the fruitiness that bounces around. Leafy. A drier side shows more toward the finish with oaky overtones and a lingering fruitiness. Yeah, the alcohol warms, but it's very delicate. A brush of greatness they have created on this canvas."
"You have to take this one a little slowly and it seems better paired with a cold winter day. Or after dinner. But very nice..."
"Purchased a bottle for $9.99 at Wine Nation in Millbury at the Blackstone Shoppes. Poured into a stemmed glass. Dark orange color, bordering on shades of burnt auburn. Not a lot of carbonation, but a nice sized head that surprisingly lasts for quite a long time. Smell has a subtle hint of wood and bourbon to its credit. Taste was very pleasant. It had a mellow bit of oak, along with hints of vanilla and caramel. Mouthfeel was on the thin side, but that would fit well with the style of an ESB. Drinkability was in the high range, as this beer was very smooth and tasty. The ESO was my first taste of Element Brewing, and if I can find more, I would certainly be willing to try another from this brewery."
"D - Pretty drinkable overall. Pretty light. Nothing is repugnant about it."
"Taste starts with clean malt character, then find the off part of the nose again in the middle, then closes with a floral bitterness. Dry bitterness clings to the tongue. Mouthfeel is very soft over the tongue, but drinkability is limited for me by the flavor and aroma. Not quite liking this one as much as their other offerings which I have enjoyed."
"F: Mostly dry with a touch of lingering sweetness, some minerality, slight bitterness, creamy flavors are there too as it's just starting to get the nitro feel. A little chocolate again, with a lot more wood esthers, oak and whisky late on the finish, coming on stronger as it warms. There's also a little weird bitterness that won't go away either."
"Indistinguishable from the classic English ESB, except for possibly a higher alcohol level. That's nearly imperceptible but I wonder."
"D) For me just an average brew. The body is a bit thin. Overall doesn't taste much like a beer - more like whiskey with beer consistency sans the alcohol kick."
"WOW, like nothing I've ever had before! Oak aromas without any hops in the nose. Creamy texture with a oak like never before finish. I can't tell is is a wine, port, whiskey, barrel? Some vanilla, spice, tannin. Has a alcohol wallop that you will not see coming. I had 2 of these at the bar and I was done. There is no booze or heat like you would expect from such a potent beer. Very well done."
"Thanks to Thirstybird for breaking this one out. Poured with the appearance of sweet tea - no head, just a skim and a frothy band around the shoulders of the glass. Nose was somewhat subdued - light, fruity esters and a little malt. Taste consistent with nose - a little oak with some buttery diacetyl and a slightly grainy character in the mix. Mouthfeel is light-medium, with a smooth, even carbonation. An easy drinking brew. Not sure how style consistent it is, but definitely solid, interesting and consistent with the brewer's description."
