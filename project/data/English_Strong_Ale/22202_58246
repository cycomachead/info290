4.69,24.1,4.5,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.5,"Vanilla, spice, and a faint sherry note first engage the nose, and then light hop aromas, malt and slight caramel with a hint of fruit become more apparent. It pours brilliant copper amber under a fluffy 1” off white foam cap. The palate really highlights the oak in a masterful way with vanilla, a slight mustiness that suggests a bourbon with considerably less alcohol. Behind this lurks a nutty, graham cracker, fruity ESB flavors. Above average carbonation also masks the ESB qualities a little bit as does a creamy texture. The body is just above medium. Almost like a jazz riff on an ESB.","pat61","Jan 16, 2015"

4,5.8,4,4,4,4,4,"The beer pours a nice, white head that borders between creamy and bubbly. The beer itself is a dark copper that borders on brown and is clear. The beer has very strong oak notes when it's cold but the vanilla beans really come through and work well with the oak, which gives a bit a of a nice spicy note to it. The malts come out but not as strongly and give an interesting sweetness to the bouquet. The taste is similar to the smell notes but that the oak is much stronger than the vanilla bean and the malts are fairly sweet. The notes combine to give off a roasted coconut taste, which is pretty good. The mouthfeel is very soft and smooth with biting carbonation. Overall, a very good and unique beer; one that I will definitely pick up.","HattedClassic","Jun 21, 2014"

3.99,5.6,3.75,4,4,4,4,"a fun little beer here, very flavorful for an esb, lots of vanilla, lighter malts, and a toasted caramel sweetness towards the finish that is really nice. its oaky in a different way, this isn't in wine or bourbon, its new oak that still has a lot of its pop to it, sappy and full of flavor that's earthy and sweet, not tainted like some other alcoholic beverage. the wood goes great with the vanilla sweet malts and the effervescent carbonation makes it drink a lot lighter than it is. sweet flavor but does not stay sweet, the wood and English malt take over in a drying way. a light amber colored liquid that stays light even as it warms. a beautifully crafted beer rather fairly priced for what it is, about 10 bucks for a big bottle. get it if you can.","StonedTrippin","Oct 06, 2013"

3.51,-7.1,4,3,4,2.5,3.5,"A very smooth and mellow beer with interesting and unique flavors. I want to like it, but I think it's a little too loose on the palate, maybe just some bittering hops to tighten things up. The oak is somewhat odd too, maybe not the right barrell or staves (or the right toast level) for this recipe. Worth a look if you liked Sam Smith Yorkshire Stingo.","SFLpunk","Aug 18, 2011"

4.2,11.1,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Not too shy to show off its presentation of epic lacing and pale amber sheen. Oak, fruit, yeast tone, doughy biscuit and lemony hops are a great showing for an aroma. Heavy, silky smoothness. The malt and oak character intertwine so much and so deeply that they play off each other ... and compliment each other. Subtle hopping evens out the fruitiness that bounces around. Leafy. A drier side shows more toward the finish with oaky overtones and a lingering fruitiness. Yeah, the alcohol warms, but it's very delicate. A brush of greatness they have created on this canvas.","BeerAdvocate","Feb 03, 2011"

3.95,4.5,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Purchased a bottle for $9.99 at Wine Nation in Millbury at the Blackstone Shoppes. Poured into a stemmed glass. Dark orange color, bordering on shades of burnt auburn. Not a lot of carbonation, but a nice sized head that surprisingly lasts for quite a long time. Smell has a subtle hint of wood and bourbon to its credit. Taste was very pleasant. It had a mellow bit of oak, along with hints of vanilla and caramel. Mouthfeel was on the thin side, but that would fit well with the style of an ESB. Drinkability was in the high range, as this beer was very smooth and tasty. The ESO was my first taste of Element Brewing, and if I can find more, I would certainly be willing to try another from this brewery.","morebeergood","Sep 15, 2010"

3.21,-15.1,4,3,3,4.5,3,"Taste starts with clean malt character, then find the off part of the nose again in the middle, then closes with a floral bitterness. Dry bitterness clings to the tongue.

Not quite liking this one as much as their other offerings which I have enjoyed.","ppoitras","Sep 05, 2010"
4,5.8,4,4,4,4,4,"F: Mostly dry with a touch of lingering sweetness, some minerality, slight bitterness, creamy flavors are there too as it's just starting to get the nitro feel. A little chocolate again, with a lot more wood esthers, oak and whisky late on the finish, coming on stronger as it warms. There's also a little weird bitterness that won't go away either.","jlindros","Jul 14, 2010"

3.06,-19,4,3,3,3,3,"D) For me just an average brew. The body is a bit thin. Overall doesn't taste much like a beer - more like whiskey with beer consistency sans the alcohol kick.","u2carew","May 24, 2010"
5,32.3,5,5,5,5,5,"WOW, like nothing I've ever had before! Oak aromas without any hops in the nose. Creamy texture with a oak like never before finish. I can't tell is is a wine, port, whiskey, barrel? Some vanilla, spice, tannin. Has a alcohol wallop that you will not see coming. I had 2 of these at the bar and I was done. There is no booze or heat like you would expect from such a potent beer. Very well done.","ComputerBeer","May 23, 2010"
3.65,-3.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Thanks to Thirstybird for breaking this one out. Poured with the appearance of sweet tea - no head, just a skim and a frothy band around the shoulders of the glass. Nose was somewhat subdued - light, fruity esters and a little malt. Taste consistent with nose - a little oak with some buttery diacetyl and a slightly grainy character in the mix. Mouthfeel is light-medium, with a smooth, even carbonation. An easy drinking brew. Not sure how style consistent it is, but definitely solid, interesting and consistent with the brewer's description.","Jwale73","May 10, 2010"
