"O- A well-balanced, fully flavoured offering from this brewer, a worthy beer indeed."
"Overall - this is a very tasty beer, nothing complex or overpowering but delivers on flavour. and even though it seemed very carbonated when poured after drinking over half i had no excess gas or boating which seemed likely. would have again when looking for something smooth to relax."
"D: This is a solid drinking ale. However, I found humor in this being styled as ""Enlish Strong Ale."""
"Dr: Very good. Very pricey."
"The beer pours a yellow-orange color with a white head. The aroma is bready with some lighter fruit. The flavor is grain, grassy hops and earthy hops. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Not bad, but not to much going on."
"A tasty, easy to drink English ale. Plenty of malt character and a good fruitiness."
"Drinkability: A very drinkable and well balanced beer. I will definitely purchase this one again."
"From bottle. Pours a medium, mostly clear amber with slight off-white head. Definite nose of fruits, honey and caramel malt. Very well done brew, well balanced with hops and malt presence, but neither overbearing. Lacing throughout. A very enjoyable beer with medium body. Not too sweet, not too fruity, not too dry - Just perfectly bitter for my taste. Very surprised at the great taste since this is from bottle and not cask. CHEERS to Thwaites!"
"This beer pours a pale see thru amber colour with average carbonation that leaves a fast vanishing one finger head with sporadic lacing here and there,it has big aromas of nice fruity hops,it has an average mouthfeel with a very dominant fruity hop driven taste that finishes quite sweet for the style with a barleywinish finish and no hint of alcohol whatsoever,a very easy beer to drink that wouldnt go out of my way for but wouldnt knock back if offered."
"More intricate than the average English strong ale, and the hops make it a good summer drinker to boot."
"Great drinkability, I could stay on this for 3+ pints no problem. Not a great English Strong Ale but worth a try"
"And so now you know: Professor Homer may not love the English so much, but he sure does love their beers! Especially those from the Lake District of England approaching his beloved Scotland. Ah Scotland - home to men in skirts (kilts) and those fine winter wee heavies..."
"Pours a clear tan/orange with a medium off-white head. Smell is a hint of malt. Taste is toasty malt, a hint of butter, definite British yeast strain. A hint of earthy hop flavor as well. Bitterness levels match up well. Mouthfeel is nice, high carbonation though. Drinkability is quite good, as it usually is with English Ales. Labeled as a strong ale, at 5.2% abv it is by British standards for cask ale, but in the US, its average gravity. Would drink again."
"Pours a hazy orange with a large dirty white head. A huge rush of carbonation keeps the head holding on for a while. Nice chunky, webbed lacing is left behind. Smells of bubble gum, hops and malts. Tastes much better than expected with some fruit a decent malt backbone and a little candy sweetness in the background. A very faint bitterness is also noticed. Medium bodied and goes down nicely and just a tad on the dry side. I'll admit, I'm not a big fan of British brews, but this one is just unique enough and tasty enough to win me over, and I have to wonder if its heritage might cost it some points."
"I don't think of this as a strong ale at all. It seems more like a good pale ale. Well coordinated with a good balance of malt and hops, this one slides down very easily, tasting almost exactly as the nose suggests: a simple beer done well."
"Pours a light amber with relatively thin head and some light lacing. Smells quite malty, and relatively dry, but not biscuity. Oddly, there is a smell of alcohol despite the relatively tame abv. A touch of sweetness and copper rounds it out. Tastes pretty light for a strong ale, and there is a touch of grainy sourness at the beginning and at the finish is a bit of soapiness. In between is malty and round but a bit thin. A little boring for the style and not as rich or pleasing as it could be. Okay."
"This is one of the two beers I brought back with me from Europe for the purpose of conducting proper reviews. Purchased in eastern London the day before flying back to the States. Half-liter bottle, brewed with English Golding, Fuggles and Brambling Cross. It pours a crystal-clear amber, with low carbonation and two fingers of frothy, off-white head. Very pleasant aroma, with soft perfumy and citric notes, and a late malt sweetness. On the palate, it's a barrage of delicious hops that deliver a big dose of orange, along with some herbal and perfumy notes. The hops become more pungent as I go, and impart a slowly-increasing bitterness. Pretty dry, medium body, with adequate carbonation and a longish finish. Not the best beer from my two months in Europe, but far from the worst, and it makes for a tasty, hopped-up English ale that is worth the purchase if you ever come across it."
"Pours an orange amber with a considerable head which settles after a while; it leaves a good lacing on the glass. Moderate nose, malty and fruity. Strong tasting beer with hints of spice amidst the malt and touch of caramel. Lot of body makes for a good mouthful. I haven't had Thwaites before; I think it brings more of a northern style"
"I drink with all my senses, this didn't look great and the mouthfeel let it down too, not a beer I will seek out or long for."
"A very flavourful big english ale. Its no 1845 or special london ale... but its good"
"Other comments: This is nice. A ""commemorative"" beer that actually steps out a bit, as opposed to just tasting like any other typical English ale. Scrumptious!"
"Overall - A very good strong (not really that strong) ale... I initially thought it was going to be too sweet but thankfully it became much more balanced after the first few mouthfuls... recommended..."
