Hell, the bottle is worth a buck to me to homebrew so how the hell can the beer not be worth 89 cents. Had to try a few of the Minhas beers. Pretty good looking beer, but not sure what I am smelling. But I have had beers with no nose that were tasty. Well, not so much, not the worst beer I have ever had but certainly not what I would call good. The funny thing is that I am trying to figure out if I would buy more for the bottles and the alcohol, I mean, $1.89. Nah, rather save a little liver mileage for something else. That said, gonna use the bottle so nothing lost.","JamieDuncan","Jun 27, 2014"

The smell was biscuit and banana. . .(strong banana). The initial mouth feel was quite pleasing but the finish was metallic. Struggling. To finish, maybe it needs to age longer, maybe the sink need a drink.... i may have it again, if given...won't be buying this again.(even though i did get it for $2.50).","superkustom","Mar 20, 2013"

3.33,8.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Pours a solid dark brown with ruby highlights when held to light and a huge tan head that persists forever. Smells of toffee and brown sugar with an earthy mineral edge to provide some balance. Light caramel and a hint of chocolate round out the nose. The flavor is a bit sweet with a heavy toffee and caramel up front. There's a weird back and forth between malt and earthy mineral and metallic flavors that sustains for most of the flavor curve. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet mineral water mouthfeel. Not a bad beer, and it grew on me a bit after it warmed up. I probably wouldn't try it again, but thanks for the opportunity Dave.","johnnnniee","Nov 01, 2012"
3.78,23.1,3.5,3,4.5,3.5,3.5,"I was surprised others scored this beer so low, and looking at some of their comments I think they got bad batches. Poured a 1" beige head of decent lifespan. The body is a deep dark burnt umber brown, even held up to the light. It smells very mildly of roasted malt. So far at this point it's very typical. But then the taste blew me away. A delicious complex sweet roasted malt with hints of cola and hopping reminding me of some English ales. And this was a pretty decent value for price. I could drink it all day.","MoreThanWine","Oct 25, 2012"

The nose comprises sweet caramel, dry biscuit, and ruby red grapefruit syrup. The taste holds notes of dank tobacco, stale toffee, bad tomatoes, and menthol. Wow, this went steeply downhill very quickly. Ugh, it honestly hurts to drink, and the flavors malinger for what seems like decades. Bad combination. The body is a very light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a watery feel. Overall, another nice-looking and horrid-tasting beer today. Just not my day...","TMoney2591","Beers"

The smell of the beer has some light malt aromas, some spice and hints of molasses. The taste of the beer is sweet upfront with some roasted notes and it actually had a nice bitter finish to it. The mouthfeel was drinkable, still a bit on the thin side but not terrible. Overall this is the best brew I got to try while at Minhas. I'm glad I got to finally see what all the Anti-Hype was that my friend Traci was telling me about this brewery.","Knapp85","Sep 03, 2012"

Smells of toasted malt and bootstrap molasses mostly, perhaps an extremely ghostly whiff of earthy hops, making me re-check the label and goggle in wonder at the "80 IBU" printed on the bottle. I'm not really sure I believe that claim... Flavor is sickly molasses sweet, also vacant of the espoused 80 IBUs on the label, but has a disturbing metallic finish on the strangely astringent monotonous grain flavor. For a strong ale, I was expecting a hell of a lot more complexity than what I received here... Texture is just medium bodied, carbonation actually is fitting for support (not too much nor too little) but problems exist within what is being supported...","WastingFreetime","Feb 02, 2012"

The price really can't be beat either, especially for the style. For 2.39$ I would definitely buy this again. I especially love this beer since it's from such a small local brewery here in wisconsin. A great cheep beer.","Zachtheporter","Beers"

I'll tell you - Minhas has found a new way to fuck with me - instead of obviously flaw-ridden, bottom of the barrel lagers, they're now pushing pseudo-craft offerings, which ring with the same sensibility as BMC's similar ilk (and they're in bombers, to boot!). This one looks good, smells decent enough, and then, whooosh - through the trap door you go. Like my previous experience with their, heh, chocolate stout, the aphorism "lipstick on a pig" was never more apt, and to play into their label chicanery: no, I wish that this beer was not for real, cheapest bomber around or not.","biboergosum","0"
