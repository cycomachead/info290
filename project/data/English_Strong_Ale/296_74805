3.32,5.4,3,3.5,3.5,3,3,"The Saints is an excellent way to wean someone onto scotch. With only one real feature (peatiness), however, it is hardly the long storyteller that a good single malt is. But it does offer at least a superficial taste of what distinguishes many of the finest whiskeys, albeit without any of the complexity, elegance or alcohol burn. St. Peter's is hit and miss and this offering could fall on either side depending on your tastes.","biegaman","Nov 10, 2012"

3.16,0.3,2.5,4,3,2.5,3,"Deep yellow coloured, without a head. The aroma is big peat whiskey whiskey and wood, and that's what I get in the taste. Highly carbonated, not so drinkable, like a cheap watered down whiskey. Why drink it at all, I could not. At least it was not high abv.LCBO acquisition. Brewed OK for what it is. Big whiskey fans may like this, good luck.","Sammy","Oct 22, 2012"

2.63,-16.5,3.5,3,2.5,3,2,"Reddish orange with some forced white bubbles as a head - low carbonation it appears. Nose has some skunk/weed initially (green bottles?), with strong peat, earth and burnt firewood upon closer inspection. Taste rehashes this, a ton of peat, smoke and light malt character. Really intense and off-putting. Light breadiness in the malt. Light body, bitter and lingering peat. I can take these flavours in moderation but this is way over the top for the mood I'm in. Drainpour.","liamt07","Oct 02, 2012"

3.32,5.4,3,3.5,3.5,3,3,"O - I really liked the smokey peat notes, but the ashy finish was definitely a turnoff. Worth a try and a brew that would receive a wide ranging reviews given the flavour profile. I wouldn't buy it again, but I'm glad I tried it nonetheless.","andrenaline","Sep 25, 2012"

2.68,-14.9,4,3.5,2,3,2.5,"Clear golden colour, near 2 fingers white head, sticky with lots of lace. Smell is full of smoke and peat with a little bit of biscuity malt underneath and to a lesser degree a bit of floral hop, but mostly just smoke and peat. Taste a strange mix of smoke and biscuity malts, peat is certainly there but this honestly just tastes like smokey salt water. Light carbonation, light mouthfeel, pretty average feel. Didn't get through much of this, really not my thing here, something I really should have passed on.","peensteen","Sep 21, 2012"
2.83,-10.2,3.5,3,2.5,3,3,"Hmmmm - I'm not loving this, though it's perhaps a matter of personal taste. It does what it says on the tin; there's plenty of whisky character in this beer. However, I find it excessive and unbalanced - you could be forgiven for not realising that this is a beer. The first impression is that someone's dumped TCP into your pint - it's a very strong aroma/flavour. After a mouthful or two you can begin to tease out the aromatic components and analyse them. Medicinal and solventy, the underlying beer never stands a chance to make an impact. This would probably benefit from having the whisky toned back somewhat, though I'm sure there are those who love it. Divisive - if you love peaty whiskies then this is the brew for you. Caveat emptor!","jazzyjeff13","Sep 21, 2012"
3.03,-3.8,3.5,3,3,3,3,"A miss for me. Not sure why this brew was part of the release, other than for the sheer novelty. An interesting experiment, but it just doesn't have the balance of other beers of the same style.","JohnnyBarman","Beers"

2.82,-10.5,4,2,3,3,3,"The taste grew on me, but I just think this one smells awful and can’t enjoy it. Was expecting a sweet Scotch Ale type of beer, but this is made for fans of smoke or chipotle beers.","bryehn","Apr 09, 2012"

2.61,-17.1,3.5,2.5,2.5,3,2.5,"The nose is all peat smoke and wood fires, as is the taste: I'd never have guessed this was a whisky beer if I hadn't poured it myself. Ashtray smokey and much too much for my palate: I had trouble finishing the bottle, my wife took a sniff and refused to help, it nearly went on the Bratwursts as a marinade but she didn't like the sound of that either. I'm sure some people will rave about it, but it isn't for me.","BlackHaddock","Feb 05, 2012"

3.48,10.5,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Overall an interesting beer. I'm a big fan of peated whisky so this flavour worked for me! Would I try again? I wouldn't go out of my way for it, but I would happily raise a glass if someone gave me a bottle, quite a unique beer and I do reccomend trying it for a couple of quid from Waitrose!","Ruds","Nov 26, 2011"

3.45,9.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"A bit high on the carbonation, and a bit one-sided in the taste - too much emphasis on the smoky, peaty part of it and not enough development elsewhere. A good beer - I might by it again, but I've had subtler, smoother whisky beers.","BDTyre","Nov 02, 2011"
3.88,23.2,4,3.5,4,4,4,"M&D: the mouthfeel is generally refreshing while carbonation always at medium level, which I like; all in all this whisky-flavoured beer (I guess whisky was added to the maturation stage, instead of fermentation?) is an easy-drinking, rather well integrated one for any peaty whisky lover, or at least for me. Where the complexity of beer has been neutralised, whisky contributes a naughty dimension to the overall tasting experience.","wl0307","Beers"
3.31,5.1,2.5,4,3.5,2,3,"St. Peter's Brewery works with St George’s Distillery to create this Beer. It Pours a clear brown unexciting with little to no head and just a bit of lacing. The Aroma however is quite exciting, if you like whiskey, which you should if you bought this beer. The nose is ALL whiskey, Peaty malty whiskey. So much that I feel like I can smell the alcohol but as this is only 4.8% I doubt that is what I am smelling. Again, there is no other way to describe this beer other than ""Whiskey Flavored"" I mean it is like a maltier scotch and soda with a hint of beer. The palate is a bit thin and over carbonated and overall it is not one that I will be buying again, but it is exactly as advertised and I am glad I tried it.","thepeter","0"
