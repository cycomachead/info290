review_text
"500 ml bottle into snifter, bottled on 10/27/2010. Pours nearly opaque dark brown color with a 1-2 finger dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big molasses, caramel, toast, toffee, brown bread, chocolate, raisin, plum, light cocoa, light nuttiness, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt and fruity yeast notes; with good strength. Taste of big molasses, caramel, toast, toffee, brown bread, chocolate, cocoa, raisin, plum, light nuttiness, and yeast/roasted earthiness. Light earthy herbal/roast bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toast, brown bread, toffee, molasses, raisin, plum, and yeast/roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity and robustness of dark/bready malt and fruity/earthy yeast flavors; with a great malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth, creamy, and lightly slick/chalky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an outstanding English porter style. All around awesome balance, complexity, and robustness of dark/bready malt and fruity/earthy yeast flavors; and very smooth to drink for the ABV. This held up very well for it’s age considering the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."

"O) A beer of two halves, but they add up to something distinctive and enjoyable. Recommended."
"Aroma malt, dark chocolate, hint smoke & fruit, molasses.  Taste chewy leather, ash, malts, prunes, faint spice, licorice, & bitter finish."

"Pours an opaque dark brown similar to a stout, but not black.  Well below average head, lacing and retention.  Outstanding nose of dark fruit (plum, fig), sweet chocolate, slightly burnt molasses and just a hint of alcohol.  The nose is similar to that of an Olde or Scott Ale, but lighter - as is the flavor profile.  Light medium body with a hint of slickness.  Normal carbonation with a bit of effervescence in the finish.  The outstanding flavor profile is reasonably intense, very complex and masterfully balanced.  The beginning to middle is a blend of flavors that slowly fade allowing subsequent identification.  All flavors of the nose are present and basically cascade from burnt molasses to dark fruit and then into a light bitterness followed by a chocolate note and associated sweetness.   The finish is a slow fade of malty sweetness with a hint of alcohol and a bit of hop and alcohol bite."
"There will be more of these in my future. It's f%^&ing righteous."

"O: Old Peculier is the closest thing I’ve had to this, although this is slightly better. The interesting thing is that it's almost as flavourful when chilled as when it's warmed up."

"This is a somewhat unique brew (or at least the style is). Not sweet like an English Barleywine (such as the superb J.W. Lees Harvest Ale). Not bitter like an ESB. And nothing like an English porter or stout, although it looks like a stout. It starts just a little hoppy or sweet but grows in complexity and fruity and wine characteristics as it warms. In fact it gets better and better as it goes down. Another excellent offering from a superb brewery."

"One of the better English Strong Ales that I have had. Worth buying."

"A first-rate effort; just what a strong ale should be. It looks lovely, while the aroma and flavour are rich, sweet and fruity. The booziness adds depth. Great balance and a smooth body. A perfect sipper for a winter's evening - the age of the bottle clearly did this no harm. A top-notch brew; don't pass it up if you see it."
""
"One of the best English porters. Awesome."

"A tug of war between the sweetness - both fruit and chocolate - and the bitterness - both roast and hop, with the sweetness winning. I've read there's some impressive hop character in this, but with a Dec 15, '12 bottling date, that was never going to happen here. Real depth - even some old ale notes - out of a historic recipe, though, and one I'd be willing to investigate again fresh."

"First off, a porter this beer is not. Sure, it's dark and well, that's where the porter comparison needs to end. Then what the hell do we call this thing? Not sure actually. Maybe an historical English black ipa? It is pretty hoppy, has the tell tale muted, well traveled old school English hop character. A bit fruity, a bit earthy or even herbal, English is what I call it. Fairly bitter as well. Tastes a bit like chocolate (ok, score another point for porter), but it's mild, smooth, nuanced even. Not at all roasty, no acrid burntness (burntness? Maybe someday it will be a real word). It's sweet chocolate, milk chocolate lite. Hops in the flavour as well. Quite hoppy actually, or perhaps surprisingly. Bitter end, lingers. Ok, perhaps porter might be the best place to put this thing. As it warms, the roast wakes up and yawns a bit before going back to sleep. Also, I have no idea how old this shit is. Really fresh I'm sure it's easier to define, maybe. I'll sum it up here. It's very dark, pleasantly hoppy, has some nice milk chocolate notes, faint roast, bitter and sweet at the end. It's a super bloody strong, hoppy English porteresque beer! Oh, it's also very good no matter what it is."
"It is warm and sunny outside as I drink and write this: even though this is a coal fire and winter brew in my eyes, it can also be taken during the summer months."

"O: This porter is quite flavorful but really sets it apart is its drinkability."
"O: Not a bad english porter. Flavors are mild but well integrated and balanced. Smooth and drinkable."
""
""
"O: Flavorful and goes down easily. Has some qualities that overlap with a Baltic Porter, including a fairly well-hidden high ABV. Readily recommended."

"D - This is a really unusually thick and dark British ale with spicy character that is reminiscent of a winter ale. Like the other J.W. Lees beers I have had it stands out as better than most examples of the style and it has a rich complexity that would probably do well with extended aging."

"O: Manchester Star is a very pleasant and drinkable beer. It is easy to see why porter was popular with the workers of Industrial Revolution England. This particular porter blends its 7.3%ALC very well, while still offering nice and mild flavor. Its nutty slightly smokey and meaty flavor would do well with most food. A small negative is that the body of this beer could be a wee heavier."
"Pours a very deep brown color with a tiny head. Aroma is a nice, sweet malt with roast, chocolate, and a touch of dark fruit. The taste is a very nice, slightly amped up English porter. The signature sweet malts and dark fruits are ever-present, backed up by some milk chocolate and just a touch of coffee. The mouthfeel is smooth, and the drinkability is very good. Overall, it's a very good English porter."
"Poured an eighth inch of mocha head which vanished fast. The body is a clear burnt umber brown almost as dark as coffee. It smells very mildly of roasted malt and I'm not picking up the menagerie of other smells others like to point out. The taste mirrors the smell and I'd have to say this is the absolute mildest porter I've ever had. It's best attribute is the body which is smooth and creamy and a nice mouthfeel. In the finish a very sublime English hop bitterness sneaks in."

"Overall it smells better than it tastes. Doesn't taste bad it is just under flavored"
""
""
"Conclusion: This is an excellent English porter, and I believe it is the strongest example of the style I have tasted to date. I like it is actually different from conventional porters and stouts, and tastes like the original style is described."
""
"man, what a classy beer!"
"O: This is a solid, but not spectacular English Porter. Very drinkable, though."
"This is a full body beer, very heavy. Porter? this beer makes some stout seem light, it hides the alcohol very well but is way to heavy to be called a porter. Any chocolate desert would go very well with this."
"Dense mouthfeel that is very smooth overall. Great brew that is one I would love to have for an after dinner drink. Would pair well with a nice mild pipe tobacco."
"Taste is prunes and figs in brandy, dark toast, dryish toasty finish after a sweeter, fruity and more alcoholic start. It has some dark leafiness and woodiness throughout, some spiciness. It is not super complex or deep but is well-balanced and well rounded with a goof, firm character and a little complexity. It’s slightly on the thin side, light for the ABV, and very drinkable."
"O: Maybe the bottled version is better, but the cask version is bland and watery. I wouldn't spend money on this beer again."
"Pours a black color. Two inch head of a tan color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of sweet malt, oatmeal, slight dry hop, alcohol, hint of syrup, and hint of yeast. Fits the style of an English Porter. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, hint of roasted malt, slight grain, alcohol, slight dry hop, and a hint of syrup. Overall, good appearance, mouth feel, and blend."
"I really enjoyed this porter. I don't drink as many porters as I used to but it's always nice to have a subtle, drinkable example."
"D: surprisingly easy to drink for a cask ale. Not sure I'd order it again, but it's easy to drink and I'm glad I ordered this glass."
"Creamy mouthfeel with low carbonation."
"A beer of resurrection. Big, brown, heady start ... such a dark, inviting brew. Tart plums to spiced molasses cake to caramel make for a showy aroma. Hefty body and a deep smoothness. A little burnt, with more of a burnt sugar flavor in the end. Maltiness is all over the place with bread, caramel, brown bread and unsweetened dark choco- late flavors to sort out. Some modest hopping is helped along by the fruity alcohol, keeping it on an even keel. Caramelized pineapple. Fading burnt grain finish with a long lingering of ripe fruit. Super tasty, this one is--a keeper, a sipper and an absolute delight."
"Pours a grainy dark brown with a slight tan head. Malty, molasses, raisin aroma. Similar in taste, with light grains/nut and sweet chocolate. Subtle carbonation. Some tobacco like qualities in the finish. Pretty drinkable, mellowed and balanced out more as it warmed. Not bad, but too much sweet malt and not enough roast for me."
"Pours black with off-whit generous head. Licorice and malty aroma. Above average mouthfeel. Good representation of English porter, most drinkable black licorice mostly, some chocolate malts. Not very sweet, understated roast and that bit of tabacco that remains on the palate."
" The taste is very malty sweet with some subtle fruit at the end. Looks thick but has a very light body, kind of an oily texture. Very little carbonation makes it go down extra smooth."
"Not a fan of this one."
"Quite a complex take on the style, well done, drinkable beer, though not one to pound all night in my opinion."
"I would enjoy one or two of these at a time. This is a quality product that many people love. Having said that, it's a little too much like drinking molasses water for me."
"Mouthfeel- Low to medium carbonation gives it a smooth texture. Malty sweet with the dried fruit-figs and raisins coming through in the taste as well. A froth on the palate barely reveals some earthy hop bitterness. Flavors remain the same with some of the alcohol giving a mild warmth on the finish. When I poured it I thought it looked like a Porter and apparently it is! Does not mention Porter on the bottle that I recall. With sub zero temps outside this is a great winter warmer, perfect at 7.3% abv. I would also enjoy this as a robust cold quaffer. Not sessionable but I could do one or two at a sitting."
"D: an interesting beer with a robust presence and could be food in another time and place, a bit carbonated and heavy for a daily drinker, but worth a shot at something tasty and reasonably unique."
"You'd be hard pressed to stop after only one of these. This is a quality porter from J.W. Lees. Try one when you get the chance."
"Drinkability is great, wow am I loving this beer! I could drink these all night, and will have to next I hang with Simon, who would love them also. I would take this over pretty much any RIS stout out there, and appreciate the price and reasonable strength. This is really a fantastic beer, without even considering the historical tie-in and back story. I love how satisfying it is, I'm in no hurry to finish this, and would surly have a second if I could!"
"Next time I'm at my fave packie-- I'll very likely buy a bottle or two-- unfortunately the price of this import dampens my enthusiasm for stocking my stash with too much of the same brew."
"Pours totally black with a miniscule brown/tan head. Nose is one dimensional molasses and malts. One odd thing that hit me on the flavor: vanilla!? Wouldn't have expected that with an English Porter, but hey: Garrett Olivers name is on the back label. This is going to bring something like you would expect it to as an American. (to the non-Americans, this is a prime example of the prowess of what the best American brewmasters can do with old world styles - just be ready for something a bit 'more') Feel carries a slightly thicker liquid body. Carbonation is lower, but it's appropriate. Very easy to drink. I like this beer. I like it a lot."
"drinkability - exceptional. Just try it."
"This beer reminded me of what was available several years ago when old-style porters really started coming back onto the scene, before brewers started pumping them up with lots of chocolate and coffee notes. The beer has a pretty substantial malt backbone, with vague coffee and unsweetened cocoa notes in teh background. Finish is firm, with a good balance of malt sweetness and bittering."
"Medium-bodied, milky, mouth-coating, and just a bit sticky, this savory drink is a prince among porters."
"Overall a very good and robust porter. Good representation of the style and good drinkability."
"This is a beer I will be trying again. I think I'm missing something in the aroma, but this would be an excellent beer for a hearty winter dinner."
"D: A great English style body with a great drinkability factor."
"Hard to saay how old this bottle is. No freshnesss date on the bottle, but it was pretty dusty when I bought it. Only indication is the back that says this was brewed again in 2004. Don't know if has been brewed since or not. Definitely some sherry aromas as I open the beer, so likely it is a little older. Pours black, but wwith almost no head even with a hard pour. Smell starts out sherried, but quickly opens up to notes of cocoa, vanilla, and sweet malt as well. Taste is somewhat similar. Definite cocoa and vanilla notes, and quite sweet. There is a touch of sherry and a touch of earthy hops, and a low level of carbonation. Slightly sticky in the mouth. Too sweet for me for a traditional porter, and not very lively. I'll go somewhere else for my porter fix. I'd more call this an old ale. Even then, I'd like a little more bite and a little less sweetness."
"From the 500ml bottle, the beer pours an opaque brown, the head modest and creamy tan, as it evaporates, the lacing provides a concealing curtain to drape the glass. Nose has a sweet malt aroma, molasses, caramel, and a touch of earthiness, with the roasted grain present. Start is rich in sweet malt, a bit of bitterness at the back; touch of bitterness, top is rich and full in feel to the palate. Finish has a benignant acidity, the hops understated but noticeable, quite dry and sweet until the end."
"Very tasty brew - malty but with enough balance to it. A fine one to sip on a cool evening."
"This beer pours a dark, dark brown color with little to no head. The smell is roasty and robust, with distinctive notes of chocolate and a hint of yeast. Like most english porters this beer does not develop any real definition until about half way through the mouth, and as it warms up to room temperature you notice many nuances. The first noticeable taste is alcohol, followed by very smooth dark malts. There is zero sweetness as this beer goes down, and it seems as though the sweet malts dominate the whole tongue."
"Overall: an excellent and very unique beer. It's like the flavor are in a tug of war but in a stale mate. I can see that some of the scores for this one would be low because of the shock of the sour notes, but if you like lambic and porter, jump on this one."
"D: Pretty high for a porter. I could definately have a couple in a session."
"D: A pretty easygoing beer, nothing too spectacular about it, but still solid nonetheless. I'm not sure this is good enough to warrant another one, but it definitely has its time and place."
"Luscious beer. Full rich - fetid? Definitely not the usual porter. Lots of character. Huge aroma of all manner of dark things... coffee, chocolate, dark ripe fruits, earth, burnt sugar, old leather. Gnarly beer. But good. Actually a velvety texture. Great finish. Very close to the commercial description. Love to try it on draft."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, slightly filling, good strong kick, there are a lot of qualities of this beer that seem to border on the Baltic Porter & RIS styles. It’s a nice beer to relax with sip slowly, but I couldn’t really see myself drinking a lot of this beer in one night."
"D  Delicious beer that has great flavor and goes down very smooth."
"Overall: An interesting beer, and I'd be likely to drink it again. That said, it does not fall into the style of what most of us would now consider to be a porter; it really does present itself as a sweet and strong stout."
"500(?)ml brown bottle from Florian's in Auburn. Completely opaque black body with only a thin film of light tan head. Smells of burnt and caramel malts with hints of black licorice. Burnt malt, caramel malt, coffee and chocolate flavors dominate with just a hint of black licorice on the finish (along with coffee flavor). Full bodied, almost to the point of chewiness. Bears some similarity to Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout IMO, though lighter in body and alcohol slightly, and a bit more complex. Fantastic. The great mouthfeel and complex array of flavors make this beer a clear winner. I'll be getting it again - a new favorite porter!"
"Drinkability: A really interesting combination of flavors; really like the unusual fruit character that blends with the sweet malts"
"Bottle courtesy of Hogtownharry: Poured a light black color ale with a big foamy head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of black chocolate is very enticing with some nice English malt also noticeable. Taste of lightly sweet chocolate malt is very good and dominated the taste spectrum. Body was slightly watery with some medium carbonation. This was a very good beer but it is lacking a little something to be truly great."
"A good typical English porter..although not my style."
"This beer is a deep, brownish-ruby color with a frothy light-chocolate head. The aroma is enticing: molasses and malt (almost a malt-syrup smell) with dark chocolate, alcohol, and a mix of fruity esters. At times it has the faint aroma of booze soaked fruit. Its a far more pleasing smell than I expected. The taste is semi-sweet with a focus on the malt. Theres a little toasted bread flavors, chocolate, and roasted grain as well. Wonderful, complex, and satisfying. The carbonation is quite restrained, giving the brew a smooth body with medium heft. Its very drinkable, despite the sweetness. I was very impressed with this one."
"The beer pours very dark brown with a tan head. It smells like roasted malt, molasses, coffee and bittersweet chocolate. However, the aroma isn't very strong. The taste is sweeter than I anticipated, with it tasting like molasses, plums, caramel and chocolate. There's also a small coffee-like bitter finish, but the sweetness overpowers it for the most part. The mouthfeel is creamy, with low/medium carbonation. It's very easy to drink, and it goes down nice and smooth. The alcohol isn't very noticable when I'm drinking it, even though it hits you later. I think this is a pretty good beer, I'll have to buy it more often."
"Had this brew on tap last night, first time I have seen it. Brew was poured to a dark black color with a tan head. The aroma was of chocolate, molasses and dark fruit like cherries, which seem to give of a sour like flavor. Ok, not sure if this brew might be going bad but I had noticed a strong sour taste (kind of like a Flanders) mixed in with nice Chocolate and charcoal like flavors up front. It was a little surprising but not bad, I actually did not mind it too much. Over all this was a pretty good brew, do think it may have run its course and the ratings here will show that. I will have to get a bottle of it to compare, but it is a brew I would get again as even though it had a sour smell and taste it was quite complex with the other attributes of this brew."
"from the bottle. poured black with mahogany tint to it with a tan head. aroma a slight sourness comes out, than roasted malts, bitter chocolate, brown sugar as it warms the alcohol pops out along with some dark fruits. flavor, plums, and orange, molasses, some smoke, port wine. chocolate, nutty. a nice dry finish enjoyed this one"
"Manchester Star is interesting beer. Thankfully, it's also good beer. Along with Samuel Smith's Famous Taddy, Fuller's London and Original Flag, it's an English porter to be reckoned with. If you're looking for a quintessential, across the pond version that is nothing like its American counterparts, give this one a go. Tasty stuff."
"Notes: This could be cellared for a 1/2 year to a year."
"Was not what I was expecting, seeing it says ale on the bottle. Poured pitch black, very sweet burnt malt/caramel smell. Tastes like sweet malt, dried fruit, raisins and a little bit of cocoa. Overall pretty good. Again I was a bit surprised since I was not expecting a porter, but it's good stuff. Seek it out."
"I have to admit, I really enjoyed about half of this. After that, it just got to be too heavy and sweet. After a while all I could really perceive was the syrupy nature of the brew. Good to split with someone and move on to something. Too much of a good thing."
"I could probably sip a couple of pints before the fruit juice-like sweetness got to be too much for me."
"Lovely, smooth roasted malt and chocolate taste. No alcohol detectable. A sweeter, smother version of Fuller's London Porter. Smooth, low carbonation mouthfeel. Drinkable, but be careful of the ABV...English porters are generally not in this range for ABV and this can hit you all of a sudden."
"I especially like the mouthfeel as it works very well with the flavors despite the low carbonation. A very enjoyable English Porter that I will be sure to revisit."
"D - high, unless you only like bitters, a great brew, to me very similar to the George Gale Festival Mild Ale"
"Pours an opaque black with a descent tan head that doesnt retain well. The aroma is mostly composed of roasted malts, chocolate and coffee, with some dark fruits, floral hops, and minerally burtonized water. The taste starts off with expresso and milk chocolate notes, as well as dark fruit (plum, fig, raisin), burnt bread, and some minerals and metallic water. I was dissapointed initially, but this is supposed to be a traditional porter that the english would have drank in the late 19th centruy. This beer feels very authentic, the mouthfeel is lighter than expected and the drinkability is good. A very nice interpretation of a late 19th century english porter."
"Appears black in the glass, with a small, poorly developed light tan cream. Very light malt aroma, with a hint of espresso (with cream), roast and chocolate along with a touch of charred raisins and a hint of leather. Flavor is really rich and malty, quite unique in its composition. Hints of chocolate covered plums, salty cashews and a light hint of coffee. Light in body, but with a fitting texture and a moderate hop finish. Very tasty porter, but lacking aromatically. Still though, to be drinking this in 1884..."
"Drinkability: I intend to grab another bottle or two at my next stop at Wells."
"Poured a deep brown nearly black with some ruby tint when held up to the light a thinner mocha colored head atop.Deeply roasted malt,molasses and bitter chocolate aromas dominate,somewhat drier porter here starts out very roasty with some raisin quality along with a touch of brown sugar but finishing very earthy with notes of unsweetened chocolate.Just a solid beer thru out nice balance of sweet to earthiness."
"Who cares, the only thing that sucks is the price, but I think it's well worth it."
"I imagine this would be an excellent dessert beer. Quite sweet and sumptuous."
"Aroma has lots of dark fruit sweetness and some low intensity roasted malt aromas. Deep black with a quickly diminishing head that compresses to a fine dime thin line. Fore is both malty and fruity with lots of prune and raisin and a bit of molasses for good measure. The alcohol is unoticeable. Tobacco elements do come out, but only as it warms a good bit. Found it quite tasty."
"Pours with a two-finger light tan head that fades quickly leaving no lace. Black - totally opaque. Light carbonation, medium-heavy bodied. Nose is molasses/raisin. Starts sweet, didn't really notice the hops, smooth molasses finish, excellent porter. Pricey, $6.99 for a 500ml bottle from Julio's Liquors, Ma."
"Pours a dark opaque brown with two fingers of coffe colored head that fades quickly, little lacing. Nose is a nice strong roasted malt with a hint of sweet molasses. Taste is more of the same, a slightly sweet toasty dark malt infused with molasses, a slight hop bite, a slight hint of alcohol on the finish, a bit of smokiness coming through as well. Medium/thick bodied with a nice smooth carbonation. This is a solid porter, sweeter than most I've tried, but very flavorful."
"Very tasty and dangerously drinkable. Taste is superlative, but slightly on the sweet side with the dark fruits, Concord grapes, and milk chocolate. Wish this one was not so expensive."
"Raising this Old School English Porter high tonight to the England Cricket Team and their magnificent series win to regain the Ashes, fantastic stuff!"
"The beer pours a deep, dark black color with a 1/4"" tan head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a rich malty scent that boasts of crystal and roasted malts. It has a some sweet chocolate malt scents as well. The taste is good. It has a very sweet and malty flavor that goes down easy and finishes a bit earthy and warm. It has some residual sweetness from the use of many crystal malts. It has a roaste malt feel as well as some chocolate hints. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a tastey beer. It has an excellent malt bill that adds complexity and great flavor to this English Porter. It's sweet with a warm finish; a good drinker."
"This brew pours a deep dark brown color with a very light ruby hue, but ruby nontheless. A small ring of head sits atop, but no real head formed on the pour. The nose is a light figgy and chocolate, with a light burnt character, but everything is very light. Not a lot of aroma. The flavor is also a little light. There is a slight soy-sauce character, with a slightly dark roasted, to burnt. Most of what I though is a molases flavor. Not too sweet, but very full in flavor. The feel is light moderate, with a light carbonation. Overall, a very enjoyable beer. I would like a touch more aroma, but the flavor is nice and complex. Tasty brew."
"Pours a dark color with a small head that falls fast and doesn't leave much lacing on the glass. The aroma has some some marshmallow/diacetyl going on. Also some dark malts. The flavor doesn't have as much dark malt character as I expected, but it had some of the diacetyl and marshmallow. Reminds me of a nice sweet stout. The mouthfeel is just short of thick and the drinkability is good."
"Drinkability  I liked the last sip a lot better than the first. This one kind of grew on me in the hour or so it took me to drink it. If you love Porter and want something to session, this is your baby."
"Bear"
"D-Wow this is a nice smooth beer. It has wonderful malts that blend together but are not overly complex. A good solid porter that has a nice quality but shows its uniqueness from brown ales and stouts."
"Pours a small dense light brown colored head that fades quickly to a film. Roasted malt aroma mixed with some vinuous tobaco notes. Deep black colored beer with a ruby hue when held to the light. Roasted malts, some cocoa and marshmallow, and some vinuous tobacco mix and mingle up front. Soft light body. Tons of flavor that reminds me a bit of Storm King, only a bit sweeter."
"Overall, this is a really intriguing, complex, satisfying, and enjoyable pint that would make a great finish to a night; or perhaps an after-dinner drink, or even cigar-beer. Very nice!"
"16.9 ounce bottle. Original recipe from 1884."
"Pours a dark near opaque brown. Small head, the fell to nothing after a minute or two. Smell is smoky, smoky chocolate and smoky malts. Taste is sweet smoky molasses with some carbonic bite. Mouthfeel is unexpectedly thin, but the flavors provide some body to make up for it. Like many smoky ales, one is plenty to drink. Tasty but one is plenty."
"I'm more or less indifferent of the actual brew. It is drinkable, and a fair example, but my wallet holds a grudge like a motherfucker and it won't let me buy this again."
"After having somewhat high expectations for this brew, Im left a little disappointed."
"I appreciated the weight of the empty bottle, which energetically I find adds to the rootedness of the brew."
"Cola brown with not much of a head to speak of. The aromas remind me of an interesting melange of things. Tire rubber, biscuity malts, cocoa, weak coffee, a bit of smoke, and more. The taste is more coffee and chocolate than the aroma leads on to belive. But the malts are there in full force, and the interesting rubber flavor comes back on the back side as well. Well integrated and nice, but a bit thin in the mouth. Drinkability remains good though. Truly an interesting brew, that I hope to sample again. I wonder if they will produce casks of this for the UK market? One can only hope!"
"Pretty nimble mouthfeel considering the depth of the malt contributions and the 7.3% alcohol. I would love to come across this on tap or even cask conditioned. Great beer!"
