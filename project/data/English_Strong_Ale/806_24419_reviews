"Overall: this is by far one of my favourite English beers - it ticks all the right boxes. Nicely complex, great feel, great package, great aroma, easy drinking and can be a slow-sipper if you want. A decent price too for a top-end Brit, at AU$8. definitely worth the having."

"Copper colour with no head. Theree seems to be dried fruit, apple, lemon and sherbet in the nose. This is certainly on the citric side for an English Strong Ale, but there is a pleasant variety of discernible flavours aside from lemon, including vanilla, oak, brown sugar and a little mint. Good stuff."

"Pours a dark copper hue with a off white two finger head and very nice clingy lacing everywhere,the smell is fruitcake,strawberry jam,boozy alcohol,brandied raisins and herbal hops,the mouthfeel is medium bodied,moderately carbonated but still rounds the palette with tastes of chocolate coated cherries,booze,roasted nuts,herbal hops and finished with a caramel candy bittersweetness and overall i like it and the perfect after dinner drop and would buy again as would age well cheers."
"An excellent beer with tonnes going on and a beer that strikes a great balance between the rich malty flavours and the sweet, dark fruit like ones. The caramel that both the aroma and taste start with are a lot stronger than I would have expected but this is a beer that I will be seeking out again in the near future."
"O: It's a good beer, but far from outstanding. While I might still get this beer every now and then, I could live my life without ever having this again. A good beer to drink if you're looking for something easy but with character."

"O: Not overly complex but perfect tasting. One of the most balanced beers I've ever had. Absolutely beautiful."

"O: Nice, on the lighter side for a Strong Ale, but still nice."
""
"Actually too boozy and sweet, lacks freshness."
"Pretty one dimensional. Meh."
"I had expected a heavier and sweeter brew, but I got a tremendously drinkable and quite hoppy one. Will probably gain some complexity over the next years."
"Overall: great texture and complex taste, keeps you guessing at what the flavour is which is exciting"
"A really really good tasty ale."
"O - A rich, complex, full flavoured beer. Best sipped and savoured."
"Nice - a quaffable strong ale. Subtle and sweet; a good sipping ale that suits winter more than summer. The reduced score for appearance was due to the excess of floating yeast. I like this one, and commend it to all who encounter it."
"Pours mahogany with a bubbly cream coloured head. Translucent body, with moderate head retention and good lacing. Nose is bready, alcohol, sweet and mildly acidic grape skins, a very fine and extremely mild acetic note and caramel overriding most of this. Notable English character in the mild hopping and malt. Taste is interesting, again an English caramel and bready quality, with some slightly sharp alcoholic notes. A fine hint of balsamic vinegar, some pear and a general fruitiness - berries and some other dark fruits. Touch of spice. Mouthfeel is moderate with a medium high carbonation, alcoholic for the most part however. Interesting, yet quite confusing as to what I should be rating this as - foreign to almost anything I've tried. Pleasant to try, doubtful that I'd revisit."
"Overall, I would not seek out this beer again. but am happy to drink the bottle that I have. I knew going into it that this was not a Belgian tripel, but I wish it had been!"
"Bought 2 bottles, reviewed the first march 2011. Half litre bottle. Dark ruby mahogany colour. Clear. The head goes fairly quickly. The malts dominate the smell but some sour pear comes out as well. The 7.2 percent comes through strongly, its too much, it dominates. I got a bit of smoke with some apple. This isn't a smooth beer. Not easy to drink. Have to say I expected a bit more. Second bottle reviewed one year later. Aging the beer really worked, it had a nice fruity aroma, a much smoother texture and the alcohol was so well hidden. This is definately a beer to age before drinking."
"Nose is exceptionally floral and fruity, loads of green apples and flowers. Hints of honey and caramel malt. Flavor is clean and approachable, while not altogether noteworthy. Middling sweet, pleasant hints of bread and honey, light cocoa, caramel; quite a bit of bittering hops in the finish which provides a really grassy, dry finish. Extremely light body for the ABV which is hidden - nowhere to be found except in your head as the bottle progresses.... Drinkable and pleasant, could use a little more complexity but for what it is, it's a pleasant beer."
"Why has it got a bee on it?"
"Pours a deep ruby red, thin creamy white head that settles at the edges with slight lacing showing up. Smells malty with caramel, toffee, slight lemon zest with hops revealing themselves toward the end. Tastes malty with caramel, sweet candy like notes, noticeable alcohol with a medium bitterness and a sweet aftertaste. Medium to thin mouthfeel that was watery at times, good light carbonation though. This is above average but thats it, I feel like this would be good on tap as opposed to bottle, I would have it again but not for some time though."
"the alcohol is also hitting me really hard. i'm gonna go high on this even though i'm not sure exactly what i am tasting. it is very flavorful and compelling but has some mystery to it that i cant quite grasp."
"Very glad I took a chance on this one, I'll definitely seek out a few more bottles."
"Could do with being a bit more supple but still tastes pretty good to me."
"Drink - The beer really had a fantastic appearance, not sure I've ever seen so much lacing. The taste reminded me of an ESB with a higher level of alcohol. It's an above average beer that I'm glad I tried."
"Very interesting beverage. Smooths out after repeated sips, though you still end up feeling the booze."
"D - This is a top quality English Strong Ale"
"Drinkability - I am really impressed with this beer. From the appearance to the tasting, this was a full package beer. Something i would seek out and have on hand. It pours nice and serves well."
"D= Oustanding ale here, and dangerously drinkable for the abv. I bought this while on a recent trip to Toronto and will have to see if I can get this locally in Chicago."
"The mouthfeel is gently carbonated and not overly creamy or thick. It glides easily over your palate and has just enough carbonation to tickle you the whole way. Overall it is a nice round medium body with a smoothly rich palate. The finish is sweet with a short hint of bitter hops. This would be a nice accompaniment to roast game dishes or rich cheeses, but really I think it was built to stand on its own."
"500ml bottle from the LCBO, poured into a goblet. Deep reddish brown with a thin ring of cream white head. Smell and taste are cherry, bubblegum, toffee, rich malts, barley, red plums, dark fruit sweetness, fig, Christmas cake, butterscotch, citrus hop bitterness, quite spicy and astringent, warming alcohol to end. Fuller than medium palate coats the mouth with foamy, citric, and drying textures. An unusually hoppy English strong which isn't surprising given the generous use of Cascade hops. Perhaps not as complex as the style can be, but still an outstanding sipper. This will now be a regular purchase for me."
"I can't see asking anything more from an English Strong Ale. Many British brewers operate on illusions of grandeur but few actually create the succulent, refined ales they boast to. Brakspear Triple, along with Fullers Vintage Ale, 1845 and Greene King Strong Suffolk, are the beers that truly define what it means to drink to the fullest extent."
"Not a bad little strong ale, very drinkable. The alcohol isn't masked perfectly, but the corresponding flavors certainly get the job done. A bit strong for a session, but it works as a good finish to a long day."
"Pours a dark amber, almost brown colour with thick off-white head. Tons of lacing. Has a sweet, roasted fruit smell. Taste has a lot of banana and raisin with some sort of spices. Little bit of hop presence too. Very smooth carbonation level. This is dangerously drinkable for a moderately strong beer. I'm glad I randomly picked this up."
"Drinkability : a good beer in the style English strong ale."
"D- Very sippable and pleasant but perhaps too big and complex to be enjoyed for a lengthy stretch."
"Notes: Not like a Belgian Tripel, and quite British in flavor. Also vaguely reminds me of a Euro Strong Lager. Lots of apple and some alcohol pretty dominate, resulting in a tangy tasting beer."
"Overall: Definitively not a typical (Belgium-style-like) tripel. More a boozy ale. Not bad to try once, but a too flat and too boring."
"Drinkability is alright but would not want more than a bottle"
"Coffee brown, mahogany along the edges with a yellowed ivory head. Not very good retention for a bottle-conditioned ale. Nose is mostly cola with a good smack of citrus, especially lime and grapefruit, intersected by grape and pear-like fruitiness and unusual notes of dark honey, varnish, and fresh pineapple. Tastes rather sweet and surprisingly bland; bready and yeasty with some quiet fruity and spicy notes. A surge of whiskey-like alcohol fires up the finish, which, along with a consistently hoppy bitter orange flavor and a light, airy, dry body, helps to add balance. Not bad, but not very interesting - way too bland to warrant the strength."
"D: Even though this is relatively high alcohol beer, it is not overbearing in any way from the alcohol, the hops, or the malt. Everything about this beer is balanced, if slightly pronounced. I could enjoy this all night long. This was a lucky find for me!"
"Old leather armchairs, Gentlemens clubs and money, that is what this beer reminds me of. I can imagine warm lounges, smoking jackets and cigars when drinking this. A very good beer, the 7.2% is well hidden and balanced nicely. A beer for people who like the better things in life."
"3 M&3 D: even smoother than the last bottle, yet the texture turns a bit thin at the tail of each sip, while the body is not yet three-dimensional. It seems ageing hasn't done a great deal to improve its overall complexity and especially the hop profile~~"
"Mouthfeel is a bit on the syrupy side for my taste. Palate is hot, stinging, generally fruity and sweet. Finish is even hotter with some yeasty bitterness and lots of alcohol. Not bad but rather 'malt liquorish'."
"500mL bottle from LCBO. Consumed Feb 08 with a best before date in April 08. Pours a dark gold with just a couple of floaties from swishing the bottom of the bottle. Solid malty aroma. Solid malty flavour as well, but with a slight bit of tangy fruitiness as well. However, the aftertaste is all malt, which isn't quite my thing. RE-RATE in April 08. Man, it's going down nicely. Still malty, but seemingly richer and satisfying an itch as it goes down the throat. Upped the ratings a bit."
"I would probably want this in a 330ml bottle as well, as after finishing the 500ml, the alcohol was very apparent!"
"Bottle conditioned from the LCBO. Pours a very dark brown, with a rocky off-white head, which diminishes to a fine film. Really fresh aroma...apples, oranges and pine needles. The taste has a nice apple edge to the malt body, but I can also detect the presence of darker fruits, as well as caramel and nut. The finish is refreshingly bitter, with a slight warmth from well-hidden alcohol. Excellent beer, that seems to gain complexity with each sip!"
"drinkability is good. excellent balance, almost completely hiding the alcohol. nice malt depth. a fine beer."
"Bottle: Poured a deep clear amber color ale with a medium foamy head with OK retention and small traces of lacing. Aroma of biscuit malt is very enjoyable. Taste is also dominated by nice biscuit malt notes with medium sweetness. Body is quite full with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Nicely done but nothing earth shattering in here."
"Pours a slightly hazed amber, almost golden, decently thick off white head forms, not as voluminous as most triples but still decent, leaves behind a lot of lace, good retention. Smell is very nice, honey, bread, sweet malt, hint of biscuit, strawberries, grass, caramel, bit of yeast, very nice floral aroma. Taste is neat, spiciness up front, very bready, sweet honey and caramel malts, lots of grass and floral, some minerals, strawberries, yeast and honey in the finish, some dry spices as well, just a touch of alcohol but its nicely hidden. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation, smooth, nice dry finish, little bit of warmth. Surprisingly great, I wasnt sure what to expect from an English triple, but it tastes like a tripel with British influence, well done."
"D: I'm not particularly fond of the earthy-mineral flavour and the alcohol warmth."
"Despite the fiziness, the mouthfeel is fine. Thin, but in that loveable English ale sort of way. This i dangerously drinkable for a strong ale. The British ability to completely mask alcohol is unnerving. I'd drink this again."
"Perhaps would be interesting to try when well-aged"
"This is a tastey strong ale. Vibrantly hoppy and full of malt and yeast goodness. My only criticism is the alcohol could be more hidden."
"Love it!"
"d: pretty good english ale that had decent balance between hops & malts. worth a try"
"Has a smooth drinkable feel on the palate. Notes of citrus, sweet malt, dried herbs and a yeasty fruitiness. Another great beer from the U.K."
"The ""triple"" tag is not unjustified although this beer is not as complex as the top belgians. I'd say this is between a tripel and strong ale in style. For a bottle conditioned beer I can get at the supermarket easily this is one I will be going back to."
"I thought overall a decent brew, mayme more of a winter warmer."
"A tasty offering from the Brakspear brewery, worth a try"
"Bottle condtioned, 500 ml. Bottle No. 001880. Trade with maeib. Pours with a large, thick and lasting beige head. Beautiful copper colour, transparent, no sediment in bottle. Delightful sweet aroma - Christmas spices, caramel, brown sugar, oak, fruits (sultanas, plums), sherry. Flavour is malty and spicy with some brown sugar notes, but not too sweet. A substantial hoppy bitterness from start to finish. I cant believe some raters did not think more highly of this one! My warmest thanks to maeib for picking it out for me!"
"D - A pretty good effort which is worth taking a look at."
"Not very complex, but oh so delicious."
"I understand it's not a belgian style ""tripel", rather it's a triple fermented brew, but the overall sweetness is somewhat similar. The flavor profiles are more or less parallel. Good beer. Nothing I'd get again, because of the price and lack of importation to the States, but if this were made locally, I'd be happy enough. God knows there's far worse strong ales out there, brewed much closer."
"Other comments: Great beer, classy bottle/packaging. Very impressed by how settled the yeast is in the bottle. I poured it normally without realizing it was bottle conditioned. The yeast stayed put and the beer was crystal clear!"
"Overall - A pretty good beer.... Recommended..."
