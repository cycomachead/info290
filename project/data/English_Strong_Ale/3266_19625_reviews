"Good roasted flavor and decent winter brew"

"This was like an IPA with a big, thick “stick-to-yer-ribs” maltiness. A good combo for a cold winter’s day, which it was when I drank this."
"Well done, this beer drinks a lot easier than 7% ABV. With a good balance of semi-sweet malts and tongue biting bitterness, it doesn't lose your interest. One way I would describe this beer is like Fat Tire on steroids, and with much more bittering hops to pair. Recommended."

"O: Very unique and tasty Winter drinker. Still, couldn't drink a lot of this, but Sockeye is doing a good job."

"O: English strong ale eh? Tastes pretty damn close to an IPA or a hoppy red or something. Either way, it's very tasty. Nice hop strength and variety. Flavorful and drinkable. Awesome."
"Overall this is a good but not great beer. It lacks a punch or a standout feature. You keep sipping looking for more but there just isn't anything else to make this memorable in any way. A very drinkable English Strong Ale as I would have no idea this is 7%ABV. This is one of those beers that would be better served in a 4 or 6 pack at a lower price point and would be much more popular"
"This is a medium bodied brew to full with a modest amount of carbonation. Seemingly creamy in the feel. This is farily easy drinking with a low alcohol impact for 7%. Much more toasty than any brew I have had recently, that was a welcomed surprise. Perhaps a bit more depth to the malt would be encouraged but overall not bad."
"I was really impressed with this beer. Medium dark looking beer with an off white 1/2 head that fizzled down and left nice lacing on the glass. The aroma was very pronounced and hinted of sweetness and malts. The taste did not disappoint. I did not detect the spices associated with many winter style beers, but a great blend of hops and malt with a nice sweetness- caramel perhaps. I will be returning for more."
"This warm glow is a welcome accompaniment to a hearty stew on a frosty Northwestern Intermountain night."
"Edit note- second tasting much better. Carmel and butter played in their tonight. Really liked it."
"Pours a hazy burgundy, with a 1/2"" off-white head. Smell is chocolate, pumpernickel, some faint earthy hops, a touch of roast malt. Overall quiet, but pleasant. Hops are much more present in the flavor, with some Cascade/Centennial-style piney notes. The hops are balanced by either a high Crystal or chocolate malt, but the beer is not particularly sweet. The mouthfeel is very ""present," without being sticky or syrupy in any way. Highly drinkable, but it fits more into the hoppy brown ale category than anything else."
"pours a nice oakish red color hazey with a thin off-white head. minimal hop presence on the nose, but mostly malt smell, like a weak barleywine. all malt in the taste, the hops don't seem to show up much, I also notice some kind of berry or fruit in the taste that i can't quite put my finger on as it blends in to the mix very well. the mouth-feel is super smooth all the way through, very nice on the tongue. drinks nicely not deceptively easy to down but not too difficult to drink either. a damn good winter ale, try it."
"Pours a red/deep purple. Smmmooookkkeee on the waaataahhh! sorry. One finger white head that dissipates pretty quickly leaving some lace. The nose is subtle, but has a little bit of winter spice. Taste is reealllyy creamy. This is immediately one of the better winter ales I have tried. A great malt character here, but not as harsh as something like jubelale or hibernation. Very crisp on the finish with good hop flavor yet almost no bitterness. This is a fantastic beer, I dont know what it is about it but its great. ahhhh now I know. It is the mouthfeel! Nice and viscous without being too soupy. This enhances the creamy taste and makes it really feel like a true winter ale. Drinkability is great, the abv although not terribly strong is well hidden without taking away that great winter warming effect. I am very suprised by this beer, maybe I am alone in this, but this is one of my favorite winter ales for sure. Props to Toby!"
"Drinkability- A very full flavored, very interesting winter warmer. Nice and fruity and definitely a tasty brew for a cold winter night. This is the second brew Ive had from Sockeye and theyve both been solid. Good stuff!"
"Man, I love fresh beer. Now I wish I had not shared with Brenda and kept it for myself, or I could have sprung for another bottle ... but I can always go back tomorrow. Sockeye is a really good brewpub and the only one in the Boise area that does any sort of experimentation... Cheers fellas and keep up the good work."
"Drink like a fish! :)"
"Definitely worth a try."
