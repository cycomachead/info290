"Dark and quite sweet with a great body and quite a rich, flavoursome taste that is very easy to drink and quite enjoyable. One of the better cask beers I've had and another I wouldn't might trying a bottle of in future."
"Good body feel and depth: a very pleasant beer all round."

"This review is an unabashed attempt to level-out the ridiculous reviews of bottles that are 12-15 years old. This beer shouldn't be aged and those that have and then have unfairly rated it should be ashamed. If I came on here and slated an aged bottle of pliny then I'd get slated in return, so why is this any different. To quote a previous reviewer. 'suck it'."
"Good stuff all round."
"Overall: Is this the same, damn-near life-changing beer I had back in 2005 on cask at the York Brewery? Well, not quite. I managed to pop into the brewery this past summer to grab a half-pint after a whirlwind tour of York's city center, and I thought it was pretty good, if not remarkable. I also had a bottle this summer in York and it was...meh. This, on the other hand (I believe from a fresher batch) is really quite tasty, if, as I said, a bit more bitter than I'd like for the style."

"I tasted this blind and man, was I confused - who'd have guessed a Black Bitter?? Plenty of roast, very umami, but light enough to be drinkable. Satisfying."

"This one's seen better days, though it wasn't even the most vile beer I drank that evening!"
"Overall: This beer is 13 years old and I can't believe I had the chance to actually drink this. This is one of those beers that I never thought I would be able to try but thanks to MrVonzipper I got the chance and I am eternally in his debt. Oh yeah the beer SUCKS"
"Overall its pretty Bad but not the worst I've ever had.Â The nose is still great but everything else has turned to crap."
"An excellent ale - I reckon this to be the best of York brewery's fine offerings. It has a rich flavour that would round off a session nicely. Well worth seeking out..."
"I really enjoyed this a lot on cask at the Brick Store Pub. Gravity pour as well, which was nice. Pours a beautiful very dark brown, almost black, with ruby highlights. Has a relatively thick pancake head that is off-white. Some nice lacing. Smells grainy, including a touch of grain sourness, as well as some gentle cocoa and roasted notes. Perhaps a little touch of coffee as well. The taste is really very nice- rich and full, but smooth and creamy, with a pleasant light nuttiness, more cocoa notes, and some very light creamy roastiness. Sweet and creamy on the finish with some light earthy hops. There is a touch of copper throughout, as well as some subdued dried fruit. Very pleasant. Pleasantly smooth and creamy in the mouth, and just wonderful overall."
"A very nice sessionable brew... well worth a try..."
"D - This is a very nice cask ale with a excellent malt character. The combination of light toffee and red apple yeast character is perfect and manages to work with the mouthfeel to create a very satisfying drinking experience. The bitterness is stiff, but just enough so to balance everything out and make for a quaffable brew. In many ways, this is exactly the sort of beer that I think of when I imagine drinking in a British pub and I will gladly drink it again whenever I have the chance."
"Notes: Best before 28/August/2010. Very enjoyable beer to drink. It's definitely English although I don't think it fits neatly into a style. Well balanced and very enjoyable beer. Worth grabbing one if you can."
"Rich, earthy malt flavour and low hop profile. Very nice mouthfeel - low, natural carbonation. Could be a nice session beer, but it is a little ""heavy"" and even the brewery itself admits its not really for session drinking."
"This was a very tasty, highly drinkable brew. I wasn't about to mention this there, but reminded me of Murphy's."
"The taste was light and pleasant, subdued toasted malt, tobacco, and an essence of honey in the aftertaste. Fairly toned down and mild for a ""strong ale"". Pretty light bodied, yet went down very easy. This was a nice cask ale, nothing too wild but tasty nonetheless."
"hmm... this approaches porter/stout territory."
"D - This was one of my favorite ales of the festival. Great drinkability."
"***ALSO, WHEN IN YORK MAKE SURE TO TOUR THE BREWERY. VERY INTERESTING AND INFORMATIVE***"
"Pours dark brown. Earthy and woody flavor that carries a slight nut tone. Bitter edge is there for sure, but its mature enough to be able to keep it pleasant. Feel is smooth with a low but slightly biting carbonation. It's pretty smooth and nice to drink."
"D: an impressive ale truly deserving a medal, although I didn't try the runner-up and bronze-medalist in the same category to make a detailed comparison. Somehow this beer makes me want to revisit that beautiful, historical city again, maybe combining it with a proper pub+brewery tour in Keighley and Yorkshire countryside~~"
"I had this beer at the brewery on my trip to york, I loved this beer and it was the best I had while I was there. I also had this beer from a bottle at a later date and I must say cask is much better and I probably wouldn't have it from a bottle agin but I very much want to go back to York for this beer and some tourist things."
"This ale poured a very dark, almost opaque brown with light brown foam that persisted a bit. The smell was very pungent: sweet dark malt, and piney and chicory hops. The taste was mild dark malt with a touch of sweetness and a bit of piney hops. The mouthfeel was smooth with medium body and low carbonation. The hoppy, malty flavor lingered on the tongue. This was a very nice ale."
