Malt forward but complimented nicely with a slight bitterness. Wynchwood's Hobgoblin is much more flavourful in my opinion but King Goblin is quite similar but with that added alcohol kick. I recommend.","PorterPro125","Feb 04, 2015"

This is not really of any benefit to the substance of the beer, but it is still an attractive gimmick.  The sweetness is there, but unfortunately it isn’t solely in the form of fruitiness.  It comes more from residual sugars and ethanol, making for a harsh-finishing beverage.  Otherwise it is hearty enough, and full enough, to keep you happy and warmed throughout.  Perhaps we should have waited for the full moon, so as to realized its full potential?!","TheBrewo","Beers"

The nose comprises maple syrup, light brown sugar, light red apple skin, light toasted biscuit, and the vaguest possible sense of candied orange peel. This is a strange amalgam of general fruitiness, sweetness, and spiciness. Diggin' the complexity, even if it means I can't pinpoint things entirely. The taste continues the complexity, but in a sideways direction: hints of old orange rind, dusty toasted biscuit, brown sugar, bad carrots, dark and musty greens, and grass. It's a sharply painful flavor at times, basically taking an evil mirror to the elements of the aroma. The body is a lithe medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda drying finish. Overall, this stuff just didn't do it for me. The flavors break the promises made by the smell and rub my face in their deceit.","TMoney2591","Jan 21, 2013"

Tastes again of sweet malts with a nice caramel backbone and an ever so slight tingle of hops on the tongue. There is a flavor in the initial swig that reminds me of sweet vegetables… Unfortunately that is the most specific I can be on the taste… Its swigs nicely on the tongue, a bit watery, but with just enough oomf to suggest its caramel flavor. Overall this is decent beer, I’m not as taken with it as I was with the HobGoblin, the wateriness of the beer is a little disappointing, though I’m sure it holds out well as an almost session-able ale.","Maxwell","Jun 23, 2012"

The flavor is sweet, roasted caramel malt with good balancing bitterness. It finishes with some toasty, toffee accented bitterness. This brew is quite enjoyable. Smooth, just a hint of Alcohol on the back end. It's been some time since I had a Hob Goblin, it's time to compare it to it's big brother.","beergod1","May 18, 2011"

I tasted it in comparison with similar-tasting Fuller's London Pride, and King Goblin is definitely the better beer, but not by a ton. It seems a little pointless for me to describe the characteristics of King Goblin because I'd just be parroting descriptions of the English ESB style. It does have good mouthfeel, good carbonation. Tastes malty, toasty, a bit solvent. This is is a good ESB and it won't jump out and surprise you either positively or negatively.","ILessThan3Brett","May 10, 2011"

A great backbone to this brew. Mouthfeel; being a fairly strong beer with alcohol content, it's not as heavy as I thought it'd be. Nice and smooth.
