"The style seems more of an Old Ale than a combo of Strong ale and Old Ale. A classic taste and worth checking out. I will try to find another bottle."
""
""
""
""
"Repeatable"

"Very good. Dark for an ale with complex spice notes. If you can find it, buy it. These are limited release and usually go fast!"

"This is a very, very tasty brew, and I can definitely see it serving the advertised purpose: a Fall evening sipper, perfect for the holidays. It could easily fill the role of your evening Belgian nightcap (if you have one)."

"Incredibly smooth, very well balanced. A little malty and a little sweet with a really great head. This was the first legal beer I ever got and I've been trying to find it again ever since but it's tricky to find. Still remains my favorite beer I've ever had"

"Yeast and malty brew with a spiced flavor reminding me of the pumpkin brews in a way."

"*Overall this is a fantastic beer that everyone that did beer tastings during the day loved. Just the right amount of richness and flavor. Not too heavy, but certainly not light. I wouldn't want this with turkey. It's too much like bourbon in character and I think that would clash with turkey and mash potatoes. But it's really good to sip and have during the day when conversing with the relatives. GOOD JOB ON THIS ONE MAYFLOWER!"
"WEll done."

"Enjoyed this bottle and will share the next with a friend around Christmas"

"It's an odd flavor. Not at all hoppy. The malts are all there. It's not bad, but it's not quite my bag. Maybe it's the bitter, slightly metallic, aftertaste. Something here doesn't quite work."

"D - There's a bit too much oak character, even after a year, but there's nothing really 'wrong' with this beer; it's just not all that special. If there were limited options I certainly wouldn't turn it down, but I can think of numerous beers I'd rather drink first."
""
"o: Thanks E, I really liked this one. I don't think I've had anything quite like it."
"O: A very tasty beer. Unfortunately, it's 8% and only comes in bombers."

"Poured into my Lost Abbey tulip glass. Pours an attractive auburn, with a one inch off white head, leaves no lacing behind. Smell is bread, vanilla, dark fruit, brown sugar, and banana. Taste is very pungent. Taste is all of that with some toffee and booze mixed in. Body is medium, enough carbonation, not dry, and pretty good drinkability. This is a different and good beer."
"O/D-God, I can just picture this next to a cut of dark meat and some voluptuous stuffing. I have avoided this for about four years. After trying this, I really regret the wait. I like how this is one of the only beers I have ever come across that has been aged on oak and such a proclamation hasnt been stamped onto the front of the label. Overall, I will definitely purchase one of these every year."
""
""
"Overall, a really nice english style old ale. The balance and toasted character of the malt really seperate this from other beers. Works perfectly for the season too and priced nicely."
""
""
"D - A good beer. If they tweaked the mouthfeel, this could be a great beer. I'd like this thick and chewy, personally. A solid offering, nevertheless. Good to see a local brewery succeeding."
""
"I poured this beer into a pint glass, it has a deep amber color body with no head to it. The smell is rich and malty. The tate is very malty and sweet. It also has some spice to it (cinnamon,allspice,nutmeg). The mouth feel is nice and smooth. Overall this is a good beer for the winter time."
""
"Not a bad beer at all, but it has some problems that may be due to age... but then the flavors wouldn't be nearly as good. Conflicting on this beer, conflicting."
""
""
""
"o - Overall a pretty nice beer; kind of reminded me or a marzen. Fruity and toasted malts with some oak, and pretty easy to drink. Would have it again."
"Reddish brown appearance with a red tinted tan head. Pale malts, bread, grannysmith apples, brown sugar off the aroma. Fresh hops, rye and wheat bread, malted barley on the initial sip. Mild hint of pears, apple pie spices and oatmeal. Bitter, sweet body with lots of smooth malts and bready flavors."
""
""
""
"I was excited to try this when I received it, as I'd never heard of it and it looked like a 'different' strong ale. It is a bit different. Belgian yeast isn't all that apparent, while the skillful use of different malts is. I recommend it."
""
""
""
"Overall, while there was much in this beer I did like, especially the range of flavors, I found the bitter Dr. Pepper/kola nut/wood notes slightly too strong, at times reminding me of biting into dandelion stems. A slightly sweeter touch would have better served the beer, showing off the great sugary esters that lie beneath."
"This pours the color of burnt sienna, a ruddy amber, with a solid layer of foam that holds up as it warms. It has a pleasing malt profile that reminds me of an English mild. It has a malty, mild flavor with a lingering mouthfeel. Some sweetness? Not chocolate-flavored but there’s an interesting, intriguing flavor that reminds me of hot cocoa in its sweetness and finish. Fennel? Fenugreek? Maple? Can’t quite place it but I like it. This is a good beer, one I’m enjoying enough to wish I had saved it long enough to share."
"Poured from a bomber into a tumbler pint, the beer is a vibrant, rich, ruby-copper coloring with only the slightest filmy covering of a head. Aromas are earthy and richly sweet, with brown sugar and vanilla characteristics on a toffee backbone. Smells rich. The beer's flavors are strong and rich, and they are conveyed on a full-bodied, creamy mouthfeel. Roasted and toasted, the flavors of caramel, butter, nut, and vanilla shine through, all very well blended and balanced, with a grainy flavor lacing throughout. Interesting, and surprisingly drinkable with all the strong qualities. There is a hops presence that reveals more into the aftertaste, with the roasted qualities combining to leave a slight drying effect, giving the beer a short-lived, somewhat clean finish. Very tasty brew, and would likely go well with just about any kind of rich, meaty foods...like, say, turkey."
""
""
"O: Good, big beer that will conspire with turkey to put you to sleep for the afternoon. Which is good because the Cowboys always win the late afternoon game, so why bother watching? (Seriously, screw the Cowboys)"
"O: This 8% ABV American strong ""old ale"" is a very interesting blend of an oak-aged, acidic English-style ale. Like mixing an English barleywine with an oak-aged American strong ale and funky yeasts. If this is what the puritans were drinking, maybe settling the states wouldn't have been so bad."
""
""
""
"It pours a dark amber with good clarity and bubbly carbonation. It almost looks like a soda. The aroma is subtle and mellow with a fine mix of barley and rye malts, sweet sugar, and a downplayed hoppy character. The body is medium. It has a nice taste that doesn't make you think too hard, which you don't want to do on Thanksgiving. It is bitter but mildly hopped. Overall I found it to be nice and drinkable. I wish I had another one available."
""
"Overall: A nice and malty treat. This seems like a super spiced up dubbel with some of the flavors of a Christmas beer. I could have a pint or two. Not something I would get year round, but good for a cool night."
""

"Pours a dark copper color with a smallish off white heads that displays minimal retention and lace. Smells fruity and sugary. Lots of toffee and brown sugar mixed with some darker fruits like cherries, prunes, plums, etc. Slightly earthy aroma is able to just barely cut through all the malt. Taste is sweet and fruity like the nose suggested. I'm picking up an astringency that is a bit unpleasant. I can't figure out if it's from the wood that I otherwise can't find or something else. There seems to be a hint of Belgian yeast in here as well. Medium body, moderate level of carbonation with a sweet fruity syrupy mouthfeel. Mayflower keeps making these 22oz bottles and I keep foolishly buying them. I just didn't enjoy this one its all over the place."

"O - A high alcohol, flavorful, complex brew that is also ridiculously drinkable?!?!? That's something we don't see enough of. A good choice to serve to craft beer loving and non craft beer drinking Thanksgiving guests alike."
"This reminds me of Fuller's Vintage Ale, one of my favorite Old Ales. A side by side tasting will be interesting."
"Pours a two-finger cream head that fades quickly leaving some lace. Clear amber color. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Light hoppy nose and flavor is malty caramel with a light pine hop finish. $6.49 for a 22oz bottle from Julio's Liquors Westborough, Ma."
"This is a grown-up beer. Bitter from toasty edges, and not to be consumed in gulps, a sipper for the flavor and not the booze (wow, a real change). I'm glad this is in a bomber. I'm going to grab couple to hold for the holidays. One to share with those who appreciate all styles. Marketed as Old Ale, and I can see it as such."
"1404"
"I'll give some thanks for this nice ale. The American Strong umbrella is sooo big though. Definitely not an Arrogant or Nosferatu in likeness at all."
"Minutes after finishing this beer I can still taste the beer writing the review. Serious lingering flavor."
"The beer pours an amber color with a white head. The aroma is very malty with some caramel malt and some dark fruit notes. The flavor is toffee, caramel malt, yeast and some dark fruit. Overall a decent smelling and tasting beer, but there is really nothing too exciting going on. Relatively easy to drink. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Overall, pretty nice. A bit thick & a bit seasonal(& a bit confusing), but I enjoyed it. Thank you Jeff."
"Really pretty color. Amber with lots of red in it. Smells hoppy and a bit boozy. Tastes fruity and malty. Very malty ... A bit boozy on the tongue as well, probably should have some more age on it. Fairly drinkable... But too boozy to be more than a sipper"
"A good, interesting plethora of flavors. Definitely works as a holiday beer."
"Has this with the turkey this year. Nice Amber/brown with minimal head and lacing. The smell was fruity with caramel malts, vanilla, and oak. The taste followed, with a fruity body balanced by delicious hints of spice. Very, very good for a holiday beer, or any cold night."
"Clear tawny amber with a hint of haze. Dark beige foam, mostly a collar of soapy bubbles with a thin skim of fine bubbles coating the beer's surface. Some sticky, spotty lacing too. The Belgian yeast character is quite up-front in the aroma, bready and spicy, slight banana and clove, but the caramel sweetness really cuts through and provides some balance. Light herbal and grassy notes, perhaps some nutmeg. Same in the flavour, but with some raisin/dried fruits and sturdy bitterness providing a base for the malt and yeast. Banana was more prominent, as was caramelized sugar. Alcohol warmth was apparent in the finish, but not strong or hot. Nice texture, medium plus body with fine carbonation. I enjoyed this beer. The flavour profile was interesting and nicely balanced."
"A decent little beer for the holiday. The oak really plays a role here and will determine how much you enjoy this beer."
"22oz bomber poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a dark reddish brown with a hint of orange. Practically no head save for a small ring. Aroma was slightly sugary sweet, very small hint of alcohol, touch of caramel. Taste was a tad bitter up front, but mellowed out. Not as sweet as would be expected, a small hint of smokiness. Not quite what I would expect for this style. Felt outstanding in the mouth, coated extremely well, with just a hint of carbonation. Fairly drinkable, not overly strong, and not as syrupy as some."
"Interesting blend of high-alcohol, darker dryish malts and spicy hop. In the swallow, the alcohol wins out. Certainly, it's not an everyday beer. Somewhat thin for the style. I do like the balance of the aftertaste."
"D..Very easy to drink given the ABV of 8%. I could have three or four glasses of this with a dinner, or even an afternoon session in the fall. I certainly look forward to getting this one again when the opportunity presents itself."
"This one is pretty drinkable for an old ale. Glad to have it. Could be a Thanksgiving tradition."
"Poured into a tulip on second Thanksgiving courtesy of Andy. Thanks! Pour is maple brown with no real head, just a bit of opaque white foam and thin lacing. The aroma is full of a bit of scotch, somewhat fruity and toasty malts. Not bad, just not as complex as I'd hoped. The taste is much like the smell, toasted malts, dried fruit, kind of a scotch finish and a dry finish. The mouthfeel is nice. Smooth, nice carbonation and a little bit dry in the finish. Overall this is nice, I'll enjoy it with my turkey and it drinks pretty well."
"Although not my favorite of theirs this Thanksgiving Ale is exactly what you need with your Turkey - it's mild enough to taste everything else but looks and feels like a treat."
"drinks okay, but doesn't quite come together very well. wants to be a smooth drinker, but stays too harsh. won't pick up another one to drink with Thanksgiving dinner."
"A-"
"Taste follows the nose, with a few peeks of harshness alcohol trying to shout down the maltiness, spicing, and barrel character. Mouthfeel is good, with nice carbonation even after the barrel-aging, and drinkability is pleasing as well. On the lookout in 2010..."
"D: Not bad. Solid but not great."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, slightly filling, good kick, good representation of style, this is a decent beer with a lot of substance and flavor that make it worth drinking for a while."
"MD - thin and not much of a body to it. Could drink more but didn't really want to with other good beer available."
"3.5/4/4/4/4.5"
"Thanks, Bounty628, for the opportunity"
"It was easy to drink the alcohol didn't show up at all and the flavors did make fro a great sipper. I would buy one next year for the holidays, if I see it"
"again, if you're going into this beer thinking old ale, you will be disappointed. the beer has some downsides, but the flavor is definitely there. i'd say it's worth a try at least once."
"Pours a nice clean/clear golden brown color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy light tan head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, slight hop note, with some spice notes. The taste is sweet, malty, some hops, bitter, slight smoke note. Medium body. Drinkable, a very tasty brew, glad to have gotten a chance to try it. I've not been dissappointed from this brewery yet."
"Just like at Thanksgiving often times the best part of the whole day is tasting the food piled onto your plate, Mayflower's Thanksgiving Ale's real selling point here is the taste, as well. The malts that were present in the nose really are exhibited nicely in the taste with a rich roasted caramel to almost cocoa nature in play with this ale. The vanilla that was present faintly in the nose really comes through nicely in the taste as it streaks its way across the roasted complexities and brings out a bit more of the hops and oak barrel uniqueness that launches this ale into a category of Thanksgiving greatness."
"Lots more rye than I was expecting (which was a pleasant surprise). Oak chip aging isn't in your face, but helps blend in the alcohol very well. Anyone that loves rye ought to seek this one out!"
"Pours a clear mahogany color with a full finger loose foamy off white head that fades fairly quickly to surface, leaving spotty patterns of Belgian lacing behind. The smell has an appealing complexity. Sweet malt vanilla cinnamon oak and spices supported nicely by a grainy backbone. Lightly carbonated, the mouth feel is creamy smooth tangy and full bodied complimenting the taste nicely. Full flavored, the grainy sweet malts vanilla and cinnamon tastes are very seasonal. 8% ABV yet really drinkable. Thoroughly enjoyed this one...many thanks Andrew!"
"I would prefer this one slightly sweeter, or at least better balanced, and definitely heavier on the palate. Still pleasant."
"D- Fantastic beer and easy to drink. I enjoyed this after Thanksgiving dinner, my only regret is that I had only one bottle and did not have this with dinner. Well done!"
"Would I buy more of it? - yes, every Thanksgiving going forward I will do my best to have a bottle on the table."
"2009 vintage served at 50 degrees in my Old Stock snifter. Poured a translucent mahogany with a bubbly, off-white, quarter inch head the quickly disperses into a soapy skim and a cluster of bubbles around the perimeter of the bowl. No lacing on this one. Mild nose - definitely getting a little oak and some sweet malty goodness. Taste follows nose - also a little creamy and toasty, with a touch of bittering hops coming out at the finish and a lightly lingering, somewhat medicinal quality. Mouthfeel is medium-light and lively with a slightly dry finish. Tasty with a well-hidden, but flavor profile seems a little nondescript an American Strong."
"Great local treat, worth a try."
"22oz bottle, Happy Thanksgiving at dinner! POurs a nice darker brown, nice lookng carbonation. I can smell the heavier sugars and can feel this one is gonna feel bigger than the ABV. Sure enough a thicker mouthfeel but not overwhelming. Molasses and honey finish this beer sweet but not cloying. A worth first beer at the table!"
"Drinkability: Excellent beer that tastes great and is incredibly easy to drink. More flavor than your typical English Ale and a little sweeter as well. Decent ABV, without being obtrusive. Incredibly easy to drink"
"This has the makings of a red ale, on high test. The beer is low carbonation, clear, mahogany, no lacing or retention. The beer is quite syrupy too. The nose has the slight chicory aroma of a red, coupled with phenols, some ABV whiffs, with some liquor soaked florals. There are some roasted, almost charred notes in the taste, lots of crystal malts, some English ale yeastiness. There are also some caramel in the taste too. As the beer settles a bit, there are definite boozy fruit flavors coming through. This is a nice beer, tasty, a bit strong, a little bit of ABV makes its way into the finish, but overall quite respectable. There is a touch of hop in the finish just to keep things a bit more balanced. If you're in the mood for a relatively flat, slightly syrupy, crystal malty ale, this is a good stop."
"the drinkabilty is fantastic for an 8% abv beer. this is a fairly straight forward, but finely crafted beer, and as for pairing with thanksgiving dinner, i'd say this is spot on (though i haven't tried it out yet obviously)."
"Poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass. This beer pours brown with a cherry oak colored highlights when held up to the light. Pretty clear in color has a cream colored head that was about an inch and a half thick that goes away fairly quickly. When it's gone it produces a ring around the edges with minimal lacing. The smell isn't what I expected. It actually smells bready/yeasty, Belgian actually, and almost a banana aroma. Malts are present, caramelized. Has a very slight citrus hop that you really have to search for. The taste is better, but still nothing like an American Strong Ale. There's still a lot going on in the flavor department however. Heavy on the malts, maybe some type of bourbon or scotch flavor to it. Very yeasty again and it almost seems to have some type of peanut oil aftertaste. There are some hops present in the flavor as well, has a bitter smokey aftertaste that goes along with the previously mentioned peanut oil taste. With all that's going on. Mouthfeel is pretty good, a little dryer than I expected, but good, it's pretty drinkable as well. I'm generally a pretty big fan of American Strong Ale's, but this was nothing like I've ever tasted before. I'd like to try it on tap and maybe get another bottle, because Im almost not convinced this is what it was supposed to taste like. If I don't like it the second time it won't keep me away from the brewery though, that's for sure."
"Cheers!"
"D: This is a well balanced, well blended beer. Goes down easily and another solid offering from Mayflower."
"Drinkability. One bomber will be plenty. I'm about halfway through and I'm thinking I wish I could share this with someone else to savor. A special holiday treat that should be enjoyed as such."
"It is great to see Mayflower release their first big beer in bombers. I was lucky enough to try this last year on tap, and now it has arrived in the bottle. I poured it in to a Duvel glass. Color is a dark rosewood color, with a big pillow like white head. Despite the color, it still maintains a lot of clarity when held up to the light next to me. The first thing that strikes me is the strong wood notes in the nose, I can tell right off the bat that this had oak involved in it. There are also some smells of peanut butter, vanilla, toffee, and a hint of whiskey. Man, that peanut butter flavor really shows up in the smell along with the oak. Chocolate and molasses are other flavors that come to mind when sipping. It comes off as moderately sized, with the malt dominating...I might like a little more weight. Drinkability is fine, but with the large flavors and complexity, it definitely is a brew to take your time with, and let open up. This is every bit as good as I remember it being last year, perhaps a notch or two better. My favorite thing about this beer is that it speaks to the history of New England. Great stuff here from Mayflower, and I cannot wait to see how that barrel aged Barleywine turns out. Pair this one with Thanksgiving dinner. Cheers"
"i had never heard of this until i found it on tap at union brewhouse in weymouth. very muddled taste with unknown unpleasantness hidden towards the back... think oak, smoke, vanilla, and whiskey. yeah, it didn't really go together. i like the concept of a beer tailored for thanksgiving, but not the final product. it is worth noting that my friend liked it a lot more than i did..."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with light tannins, and a sugary, dry finish."
"I drank my serving of this beer really quickly; its extremely tasty bordering on chuggable. A beer I was looking forward to trying that did not disappoint me."
"Overall a very nice, quality seasonal beer. Very sweet and quite unique from anything I have had in the past. I would not mind trying this one again any day."
"Really a nice offering from Mayflower. Great drinkability on this guy, even with a nice warming finish."
"Had on tap at Moan and Dove. The appearance was really perfect: a dark, beautiful, clear red look with some thin lacing. Aromas were really, really, really good: sweet vanilla with smoky malts and alcohol. Heavy malt and vanilla flavors are maintained in the taste of the drink. Really smooth and warm structure; really helped me warm up from the cold New England night. Overall, a perfect beer for the thanksgiving season."
"Tastewise there's a lot going on. Very light carbonation and sweet nut flavor make it seem like a built up nut brown, but there's a lot more going on. Lots of oak. Has a distinct vanilla bourbon bite. Too thin mouthfeel. Despite a high ABV Thanksgiving Ale highly drinkable."
"M/D - I think this one is perfectly carbonated, not too heavy and is something that I could sit down to glass after glass, which I intend to do right now, to finish out this growler."
"Great drinkability considering the alcohol content. Could go very well with a variety of American fare, and could even taste great on a hot day."
"Hopefully, I can snag a growler for Thanksgiving dinner with the family."
"This is fantastic. I need to get back to the brewery for another growler or 3. Mayflower has hit it right on the head with this one. Great first venture outside the 4 staples . This like the others are top notch brews"
"I picked up this growler at the brewery. These guys are making some fantastic beer down there."
"Had on tap at Union Brewhouse. Poured into a pint glass. Pours a clear, darker reddish-brown. Very thin to no head. Almost looked non-carbonated. Good, strong aromaa. I get oak, whiskey and some vanilla. Taste is similar - lots of booze in the flavor. First off I get a lot of vanilla, then the whiskey. Someone commented ""I think someone put a shot in my beer!"" Very full flavor-wise. Very thin mouthfeel. I don't know if it is from the lack of carbonation, though. I cant believe this beer is only 7.7%- it's strength in flavor makes it seem much more. Pretty drinkable, though. I had 2, and will definitely have again!"
