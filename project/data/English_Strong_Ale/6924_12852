3.45,-2.5,,,,,,"Overall: this beer isn't completely to my taste.  There's lots of bread and biscuit, and not much of the fruitiness I often enjoy in the style.","flagmantho","Aug 03, 2014"

4.04,14.1,4.25,4,4,4.25,4,"22oz from Fred Meyer in S.Salem ( Commercial St. store). Surprised to see this at Freddys hope this gives this small brewery a boost. $3.99. Certainty looks like an English style ale in my Imperial nonic glass..chesnut brown with a small creme coloured head. Attractive. Smells of english hop,tobacco,toffee,light cocoa..very nice and very authentic. Taste is the same as aroma with a bit of demerara sugar and hazelnut, lovely quite lovely. Great palate to this one,low carbonation and smooth finish. A very good English ESB really better than any i have tasted from American brewer","Reidrover","Jul 03, 2013"

3.57,0.8,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.75,"The body was nicely full and smooth, although there was just a bit of stickiness on the finish. Drinkability was very good, this big beer went down easily, and there may be another in my future. Overall, a very solid take on the style. Certainly worth your time if you see it, and very close to being a must try.","beertunes","Sep 30, 2012"

3.53,-0.3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Smells mostly of the expected English style earthy-toffee-bready malt blend with a small side serving of chocolate and pitted fruits. The flavor is more dry, leafy, and nutty than the nose had led me to expect, and it has hardly any of the fruitiness from the nose at all! ABV is very well hidden. This is... a fairly nice beer but not really something to go out of your way to acquire.","WastingFreetime","Jul 31, 2012"

3.38,-4.5,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Not bad, not great. Poured at a good temperature with an average off white head and some lace. Color is a very slightly hazy dark amber. Aroma is super mild with only a hint of malt and hop. Flavor's like nose, carbonic tang up front, followed by bitter/sweet. Not a lot going on. Body and carbonation are good. Finish is like flavor, average length, and forgettable.","drpimento","Feb 27, 2011"
3.43,-3.1,3.5,3,3.5,4,3.5,"While the beer is still very drinkable, I'm not sure how much a person will be able to drink in one sitting. Give it a go if you're curious, but don't expect to have the most frabjous day on account of this ale.","Pintofbrown","Nov 23, 2009"
3,-15.3,3,3,3,3,3,"Overall an ok beer, which is my first from this brewery. I am not that impressed with this beer but it is not bad by any means, I will look out for more beers from this brewery.","chumba526","Jul 18, 2008"
3.55,0.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5," Body is fairly rich and creamy, a nice example of an English-style pub ale amped up to American standards. The high ABV limits how much I would want to consume in an evening, but this is still an enjoyable beer. The husky bitterness is a little troubling, but overall this is a well-excecuted ale.","ElGordo","Feb 13, 2007"
2.9,-18.1,3,3,3,3,2.5,"This English-style old ale begins with a faint dark-malt aroma - not roasted as such, but melanoid. It is glazed mahogany with low suds and a light sugarplum taste. Though not a bad beer at all, it comes across as indistinct and lacking any formative identity. The flavors are too understated to evoke sustained enthusiasm.","RedDiamond","Sep 22, 2003"
3.87,9.3,3.5,4,4,4,3.5,"Pretty tasty and interesting beer. Not really my cup of tea, but I can appreciate how well made this one is.","flexabull","Beers"
3.93,11,4.5,4,3.5,4,4.5,"Taste is very smooth, and somewhat mild for a strong ale. Pleasant malt and orchard tastes. Low carbonation and nice body make for a very drinkable ale, surely this is a winter delight.","freed","0"
