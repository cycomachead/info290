"An above average ale with some nice aroma and body and a decent flavor.  Nothing special, but certainly enjoyable and refreshing."

"o: ultimately a little too lightweight for my tastes, but I'd drink it again."

"O-A boring bland beer, makes me wonder why I pick up Middle Ages when I see it."
""
"Overall nothing to write home about. fits well in the winter but could use some more oomph."

"If I am to put on my Wizard's hat and peer into the future, I don't see myself buying this again. I enjoyed it, but there's just not that much magic to it. It is another beer that fits squarely into the ambit of Middle Ages' abilities, which is to provide nothing less and nothing more than agreeable, if slightly more hoppy English-inspired offerings."
"O- Perhaps a bad bottle or maybe from last year (no bottle date), but if this is what was intended, it is not good. Got through half the glass before opting to drain pour."

"Overall- I want badly to like this beer and have since I discovered Middle Ages. Winter styles are some of my favorites, and this is an interesting take. It's definitely got their signature style, and has elements that bring to mind both Kilt Tilter and Swallow Wit, but it drinks something like what I imagine an imperial macro lager to be, which is decidedly painful for me to say. There's something worthwhile there, but it needs to be tweaked before it stacks up against the brewery's other excellent offerings. I definitely recommend drinking it at room temp or just below."
"O - For what I paid, I'm a bit disappointed. Still, it's better than adjunct stuff by far (not that that says much). Middle Ages has had some good selections, and some that are just okay. I feel like this ale falls into the latter. Still, not sad that I at least tried it. Unfortunately I've got another 5 to try after this round."

"a nice winter warmer. smells less spiced and sweet than most, but has a beautiful aroma like a strong red ale, with generous hop additions. tastes like a winter warmer, but again not spiced and sugary. english malts and what feels like dry hopping make this one very sessionable. have had this on tap from the brewery as well and is even better. a great local holiday brew, and a nice warm body buzz."

"The taste, while malty and sweet as the nose would suggest, is rather dry compared to what I'd expected from such. There is a bit of harsh assertive carbonic acid behind the gently sweet malt backbone. I'm a bit disappointed in the relatively light body of this beer, as to what I've come to expect from winter beer varieties. It is rather light weight and prickly in texture, though all in all a very decent brew."
"Pours with a nice reddish body. Thin wispy head as expected from a cask beer. The aroma has good strong maltiness without much bitterness. This is somewhat different than the taste which has a distinct bitterness. The body is quite thin, even for a cask beer. It ready detracts from the beer. Not their best showing."
"Wizard's Winter Ale is a very clear, sparkling copper ale with a thin off white foam that quickly fades to a blotchy, bubbly film and leaves nice lacing. It has a sweet, malty, toasty aroma. It's pretty light bodied, a little flat and a little watery. The finish is a little scratchy. It doesn't taste as sweet as it smells. A pretty strong, green bitterness dominates the taste. It's quite well balanced and no particular flavor really sticks out. The toastiness is prominent and it's perhaps a bit nutty. It's not too bad."
"D: Goes down pretty sweet and smooth. Overall it's a pretty decent beer, though in some ways it seems more like a Belgian style dubbel"
"D-fairly drinkabke, if I wanted to have it again"
"Pours amber brown with a good amount of head that hangs around. Smells bitter and fruity. Like a poorly made lager... Overall, not very tasty. The herbs and spices are covered by a undesirable taste that i can't describe well. Overall an undesirable brew"
"S: I think it's worth the price (less than $1.50 a bottle) and I might buy it again in a mixed six pack. I don't think I'd search it out or recommend it, but I'd share it."
"D - I won't be picking up any more of this when I go back up to NY it just doesn't taste good and I never heard anything back from the brewery after I sent them an email about my bottle bomb"
"Not sure why it's sold as a ""winter ale", as it's not full bodied, a stout, spiced, aged in xxx, big on abv., etc. etc. Whatever, it's pretty decent alternative to all that stuff when the store is flooded with it. :)"
"D - Quite"
"Brew poured to a nice deep amber color with a fair sized creamy light tan, which has good retention and left some ok lacing. Aromas of roasted malt, hops that give some idea of earthiness, slightly burnt brown sugar and a slight orange and buttery scent. Pretty inviting aroma, though it does feel like it is missing a little something. The flavor is good; malt really comes through here highlighting caramel and roastiness. Some fruit flavors come out and I think that could be from the yeast. Beer drinks well but if this was to be a winter warmer where spices should stick out, they where not noticeable, at least to me. Would get this again."
"Mouthfeel is nice a medium bodied with a slight slickness towards the end. The extreme, slightly unbalanced malt sort of got to me by the end of this in terms of drinkability. An enjoyable brew.. hopefully next time not at the end of Spring."
"Decent drinkability..."
"Drinkability: I know this brewery likes the Ringwood yeast but here is exhibit number 1 as to what it produces; just not my cup of tea"
"Pours a clear dark amber with red highlights. Two + fingers of foamy khaki tan head has very nice creamy retention and leaves some nice lacing. Smells of caramel, lightly toasted malt, cinnamon, brown sugar, and floral hops. Tastes of brown sugar, molasses, and caramel with nutmeg and cinnamon. Some raisin and white grapes follow along with a bit of vanilla, then a mellow bitterness of citrus and fresh cut grass in the finish. Medium in body with good carbonation. Smooth and sweet with a touch of wintery spices and a pleasant lightly lingering bitter finish. Not the most hearty of Winter Warmers, but satisfying and easy to drink."
"Drinkability: For a seasonal this beer is good. It is snowing out right now and this is a complement to the season. Maybe on Christmas I will have another one of these, but I would probably just stick with the winter for this one."
"Overall: Not my favorite style but this one was pretty enjoyable. There was a perfect amount of spice to balance out all the caramel malt. I enjoyed it. One of my favorite winter ales."
"Drinkability is again average, not to bad though, with a bit of work this one could rock."
"12 oz. bottle poured into a pint glass with 2 fingers of off-white head that dissipates quickly leaving some lacing. Light, clear caramel color and an aroma of citrus and butterscotch. Tastes of grapefruit, caramel, and a clean citrus finih. Medium-bodied highly drinkable beer."
"The taste starts of malty then some fruits and yeast jump on the taste bandwagon."
"Pours a clear darker amber brown. No head. Nose is quite malty and caramel toned in a very minimal sense. Seems to be a leafy hint on the back side. Whew. The flavor is...tangy shall we say. The first hit almost goes right back out. The second swig is not nearly so shocking on the tastebuds, but things still aren't working here. Feel is nice, but this just isn't doing it for me. Sorry sweetheart, but you've got to go."
"Other: Average Winter Beer at Best, But Worth a Try."
"Musty horse blanket aromas blended with fruity aromas of slight red berries. The malt comes up in the background and is slightly caramel-like. It finishes with notes of oak and some slight vanilla. The mouth feel starts off with a blend of bitterness, and strong carbonation. Finishes dry and sharp. Overall a very interesting beerand can be enjoyed if you really analyze it. Trust me you should. It is worth it."
"Overall an interesting winter warmer. The flavor was a bit confusing though - almost a cross between a scotch ale and a dubble."
"Drinkability- Overall not a bad brew but this is a bit different of a winter warmer than I expected. The spice in the nose isnt present in the taste but plenty of hops are. A good solid beer that Im glad ncvbc shared, thanks again!"
"A red copper colored brew with a whispy head and thin lacing. The aroma is winelike, heavy with some caramel, and thick cranberry. The taste is of berries and caramel with some pine hops bite. It's aqueous with a touch of licorice and alcohol noted. I also pick up a little bit of the dreaded but all too familiar ""cardboard""! It's well carbonated with average drinkability. It's interesting and not bad. I would drink again for sure as a flavorful winter ""warmer""."
"Final Note: Wizard's Winter Ale is a brew that will definitely warm you, enjoy!"
"D - My 1st winter ale of the year and it did not disappoint. Could easily sit and enjoy several. Definitely a session beer for late fall, early winter"
"D: For a winter warmer this was super drinkable. I have had this in a bottle and the cask blew it away. If you can find it buy it."
"Overall-this is not what I think of as a winter warmer. It is not that warming. Alcohol is a little low for me to 'warm'. There is no spicy edge. I am not talking actuall added spices but I except some spicy hop notes like from Target or goldings."
"Decent and even enjoyable, this is hardly mindblowing, and I suppose I can think of other beers I'd rather warm with this winter, but overall it's on the side of quality. Just not the most memorable brew by Middle Ages."
"This one is actually 6.8% abv and the brewery calls it an ""English strong ale."""
"Drinkability: This beer came across pretty average to me... an average amber ale in my opinion."
"A good winter seasonal offered by Middle Ages. This winter warmer pours a cloudy burnt orange with a frothy head. Aroma of this brew appear more malty than anything with a hint of grapefruit. There are multiple tastes to this brew including that of citrus from the hops and a roasted nutty caramel flavor from the malts. A great beer to sip on during a cold winter night in front of the wood stove."
"Overall a good Christmas party brew!"
"Clear orange/copper, fizzy off white head forms, settles down to a thin layer very fast, few spots of lace. Smell is sweet, some toffee, butter, fruits, yeast and bread. Taste is almost all diacetyl, seems to be a problem with Middle Ages. Little bit of sweet malt, strange medicinal citric flavour, bread, wheat, very dry astringent finish, very unpleasant. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, low carb, heat going down, coats the mouth in not a good way. At least the colour is nice."
"This is a complex beer. Normally, this alone would have me giving it a much higher score. However, there are some flaws (in my opinion) that detract from its potential greatness."
"D - A decent winter warmer with a very subdued profile and an interesting hoppy crispness. Nicely drinkable and very enjoyable as a one-off for the evening. With a little recipe tweaking, this could be a killer."
"Picked up a case of this at the brewery, on special for $20 because they're trying to get rid of it. I've had it many times and have always enjoyed it. Pours a clear dull redish color with a nice head but little retention. Smell is sweet, almost like honey along with malt. Taste is also sweet but not syrupy sweet to the point where it's undrinkable; has a honey, buttery sweet flavor with the presence of malt but little hops. It's July and I'm drinking it but although it's summer I am still enjoying it."
"Overall not to bad. Kind of a middle of the road winter warmer. Not quite old school american pale ale micro, not quite english pale, not quite winter warmer. It's drinkable, but I've come to expect more from this brewery."
"The flavor is also fairly mild. I get a bit of brown sugar up front and some caramel and red grape fruit that rolls to a lite piney hop finish that doesnt linger very long. Overall the beer is much milder and supressed than I would have expected. Thought there would be a bigger nose or flavor in here but it is pretty much not very exciting. I wouldnt buy it again, but wouldnt turn down a free one either."
"12oz. bottle: This one pours a somewhat hazy dark amber color. Mine had some off white head that subsided rather quickly. The first thing that hits the nose is a bit of spices. They are followed by a whiff of some caramel and fruits. The taste is quite good and well blended. Individual flavors arent fighting to come out. Somewhat of a dry aftertaste. Very drinkable."
"Mouthfeel was creamy, moderate, carbonation light. Tasted malty and sweet, a hint of toffee / a bit of diacetyl in the middle, and a touch of tart hops on the end. I found a metallic edge on the finish as it warmed. Despite that edge, I found this drinkable and would try it again. Thanks, shippos, for the sample."
"Middle Ages Wizard's Winter Ale pours a hazy amber/brown with an inch or so of tan head. The aroma is mostly malt and spice, with a bit of a peach-blossom thing in the background. The taste has a prononced fruitiness along with the rich malty backbone, mostly peach/plum, no real bitterness, rich but not sweet or cloying. Delicious!"
"Pours a dark amber. Tan head and lots of lacing. Mouthfeel is medium and carbonated. Smell is malty and spicy. Wish it was a bit stronger. Taste is of malt,and spice with a little hop kick.Nice smooth finish. The more i drank it,the better i liked it. Worth a try!!"
"Not a bad brew, but the spice and overall sweetness are a little much."
"Pours a rich chestnut with no head. Smells of caramel sweetness and floral hops. Taste is much sweeter than I expected - almost like butterscotch. A bit too syrupy I think. Strong malt backbone balances this out enough to make its drinkability fairly high. Not a particularly memorable beer - a nice drink at any time. My only wish was that it had more warmth that I like in a nice sub-zero wintery day beer. I felt that I could have just as easily been sipping this brew during a July heat wave."
"D - Very nice. This is a great winter ale. I could go for several more of these, shame they aren't readily available in my area."
"Pretty easy to drink, but nothing special."
"Amber waves of grain-juice with a picturesque head that is very creamy, lasts a while, and laces a bit. Nice. Smells like rummy cinnamon butter. The apparent spicing and warmth makes me think of ""holiday"" celebrations with loved ones. Flavor is thick but with a spicy bitter bite that keeps the caramel candyishness from being cloying. When chilled, it has a bitter metallic finish that is not so pleasing, but upon warming it is very nice. Feel is heavy but again has the bitterness to pull it off nicely. This beer is exactly what I expected it to be, no more, no less. It didn't leave much of an impression, but it was enjoyable while it lasted."
"Beer is good. Happy early Winter beering."
"Bender factor: This one improves drastically with age. Cellared for over 3 months. Avoid in November. Amped up Grail Ale"
"Poured out a dark amber/brick color with a good size head. Left some lacing around the glass after I was done. Smell consisted of malts mostly, with some toffee and earthy aromas. Some spices are in there, but I would of liked to see more of them in here. Taste was good. Malty and caramel hit the palate first and lasts throughout. Some hops and fruits show up in the middle along with a light hint of spice. Mouthfeel was medium and was quite creamy and smooth. I paired this with some black peppercorn pork roast and went very well together. The peppercorn gave the extra spice that this beer needs. Quite good."
"A little disappointed. I can't really get Middle Ages Brewing around where I am, so I picked up a bottle while on a road trip this weekend. I expected more."
"A clean dark amber beer. Has a big fluffy off white head that leaves a little lace.There is a big burst of butterscotch that overlays the malty background of the aroma. The flavor starts out with the butterscotch and malty sweetness and finishes with a slight sharp hoppiness and a dry finish."
"Wizard's Winter Ale is a pretty good winter warmer. Even though the body/mouthfeel could be improved, there isn't much else with which to find fault. Thanks to HappyHourHero for the bottle."
"Thanks to shippos for this one. Pours a standard amber color with a small head that dies off quickly and leaves a little lacing on the glass. The aroma has a slight hop presence with a buttery caramel character, as kmpitz2 stated. The flavor is very much like the aroma and finishes with a bitter kick at the very end. Very nice. Smooth and enjoyable."
"Thanks to shippos and clvand0 for bringing this beer to my glass. This beer departs the bottle a nice copper/mber color with an active carbonation and a finger of tan head that falls to coat the beer. The nose is buttery caramel to toffee. Interesting. The flavor is somewhat similar to a fullers esb, with the buttery/diacetyl tones followed by a slight hop bitter on the back of my tongue. I like it. The feel is moderate and creamy, some of it sticks on the tongue. Not a bad brew. I like the use of the butter character in it, as it works well with the feel and the hop. Not necessarily a beer I would try hard to find again, but its a nice take on a winter warmer."
"Edit: After reading some of the other reviews, it looks like this is my first brew to feature Ringwood yeast..."
"The 12 oz. bottle arrived in the BIF X-Mas package from shippos. The body was clear and reddish amber in color and lacked much head, although carbonation was pretty good. Aroma sweet honey malt with the Ringwood yeast signature movie theatre popcorn. The taste was soft and fruity, but a bit watery. The Ringwood off flavors generally well in check in this beer. Carbonation was prickly on the tongue, and the aftertaste was salty. The alcohol was felt in the warmth in the stomach, and the beer drank stronger than the actual alcohol content."
"Drinkability & Notes: If this brew cleaned up its act it would be damn good  sadly it did not win me over at all."
"Dark ruddy amber/red with burnt orange edges. Aroma is very British in character with a few tea-like aromas mixed in with some nicely subdued ringwood yeast esterst. This stuff is definately still fruity and tea-like on the nost with a nice subdued hop aroma in the back of the nose as well. Taste is interesting and strong up front with the ringwood esters. The middle is bready/biscuity with a certain funk that really makes this beer interesting. The finish is a bit rough, with the subdued hop flavors mixing in with a somethwhat ""hot"" alcohol flavor. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, and this beer improves when it is allowed to warm up. Drinkability is good as well. Good, interesting, and another winner from MA."
"well I'll tell you this- I've been sitting/walking around the house cold with a blanket wrapped around me for a few hours, and finally now i am getting quite warmed up. Thanks, Wizard! Bubbles the kitten at Middle Ages said I'd definitely like this one, and to please rub her tummy some more... So I did and I took home a bottle of this. Looks a bit like the colour of weak tea- orange/reddish brownish. Small, off-white head of tiny bubbles. there's a crescent moon of no head in there. kind of cool. It smells a bit funky- sourish, grassy but in a dirty kind of way... not the best in my opinion. Tastes much better though, yeah. Not dirty, but clean like the snow outside while yer sitting in front of the fireplace with the blankets thrown in a pile next to you cos yer all warmed up and cozy. It almost tastes a bit grapey actually. Dry finish, very dry. Very good. Mouthfeel is just the perfect amount of carbonation, very nice. Drinkability--- good, but it would get to me after a while, as in, I would pass out from the heat. But in a good way. I recommend the Wizard if yer cold and need some warming up."
"Unique for this brewry coppery color, less aggressive hops so maybe shelf life less."
"Definite hop presence on this one, but there is an alcohol tinged malt presence in the background that hold it together. Hops are nicely herbal, and not extremely bitter as they can be, though finish is a little harsh."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, frothy 1"" light tan head formed, which laced well. Brew is an amber hue and has a pleasant malty aroma, almost smells like a bag of pellets from my parent's grain bin. Taste is surprisingly up-front with hops that were not apparent in the nose, and rounds out with the grains that I expected. Not often you get surprised like that. reasonably well balanced with malt and hops, but the malt wins the battle here by the time of the swallow. Mouthfeel is a little rough, but overall a nice brew."
"Appearance: Ruby caramel amber brown thine cream head specks of lacing. Aroma: English style malts winter warmer like caramel and butterscotch touch of earthy hops, with a slight spicy character. Taste: English varieties of malts give off a nice mix of toasty butterscotch sweetness and finishes with a mild bitterness, overall tame but well crafted English style winter warmer. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied slightly sticky perfect carbonation. Drinkability: Pays homage to other English brewers with a very nice rendition of a traditional old ale, tasty wouldn't pass sampling this one again in the future."
"Not a ton of nose just some light hints of caramel as you wiff. Slightly off white (light tan) dense 1/4 inch head after the pour. Dark peach filtered look in the glass. Very dry earthy hop taste to the inital sip of the brew. The beer also has a crusty malt base to it as well. The mouth seems of medium to light thickness.. a little light and lacks the coating nature of many Old Ales I have had. Very dry on the finish. You will be left with a sandpaper tongue."
"Drinkability is high although relatively weak finish detracts somewhat."
"P ours a light brown with a definant orange hue with almost no head but that was expected,aroma very orangy and also some chocolate thrown in there as well. Nice big malty beer with a caramel taste emerging right away with deep fruitiness that pierces right thru every other flavor the alcohol becomes more prevelant as it warms.A real nice winter brew pretty warming and flavorful."
"The beer pours a dark amber color with a 1/4"" off-white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a sweet malty scent with the fruitiness of Ringwood yeast. The taste is good. It is a smooth drinking malty brew with light hopping and a fruity yeast finish. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a good seasonal. It has great malt character; a fine sessions ale."
"poured a nice deep medium brown with nice medium head....notes of the normal christmas spice, nutmegy spicey aroma...with nose hints of fruitiness...had a decent bite....spices not too overpowering and leaving room for hoppiness with a nice aftertaste of fruit...i'd say an average christmas beer"
"A hazey amber colour with a thick head that slowlt dissipates to a fine white lace. The scent was of citrus hops and nutmeg. Very nice. The taste was very fruity, it had a lemon taste to it. It was Very much of the season. Nutmeg and coreander was what I got. It also had a nice bitter bite to it from what I think was cascade hops. A very nice ale."
"This was medium bodied, had a slight crispness and dryness on the tongue. Dryness continued during the aftertaste. Overall an average drinkability due to the boredom that settled in before I finished this off. A good beer for a newbie expanding his/her tastebuds."
"Does not help to have a moderate mouthfeel with a sudsy texture. Seems like it needs some time to settle down, but will it do so well and should you have to?"
"I've found that Middle Ages' choice of yeast has strained other brews, but in this one it's spot on, and enhances rather than detracts."
"Nice caramel malt base with a mildly hoppy and herbal aroma. I believe their must be some kind of herb or spice in this one. Has a nice drinkability but unfortuantely, mine was little too cold and I did not have a chance to let it warm up to see what happens. Another solid beer from Middle Ages and I will look for this again."
"Drinkability - 6.3% abv is a tad above normal but this is a very drinkable potion."
"The taste is slighltly fruity/malty with a little caramel in there too. Moderately strong hop kick at the end. Mouthfeel is pretty solid between the carbonation and the alcohol. Not a bad little winter ale at all."
"Drinkability: A nice Strong Ale.. this style usually has me bailing out after a pint... but in this case, pour me another! Middle Ages continues to impress the hell out of me."
"The color a unclouded deep brown with the head modest and frothy, the color a light tan as it evaporates, the lace forms a fine covering upon the glass. Sweet fruity nose and Ringwood yeast is quite noticeable, malts also right there. Start sweet, middle moderate in feel and the finish briskly carbonated and the hops pleasing and spicy, dry as a bone aftertaste, a good drinkable beer."
"Pours a light tan/dirty white foamy head. It's fading fast, I can see it shrink, wouln't last a minute. The liquid is glowing, redish mahogany in color. There's a bit of lace hanging around after the first few sips. It smells a bit sweet and malty, with a hint of butterscotch, and just a little alcohol. The taste at first is rather malty, which fades off to a mild bitterness. Not sure how it compares to other strong ales, but this is pretty drinkable. It is flavorful without any overpowering flavors, nice balance."
"Very, very awesome. This was my first Middle Ages beer, and I've been enchanted with their labels and the whole medieval thing. I didn't know what to expect, but i was pleasantly surprised to find that it's extremely british in style, all the way down to the particular hopping. I thought it tasted a lot like Brakspear Vintage Henley. Strong flavor, agressive hoppiness, a bit of alcohol taste, and a smooth sweetness. Right on, brothers."
"523"
"Poured an interesting coppery amber. Sticky, rocky head with good staying power. Not a lot going on in the aroma - mildly sweet malt notes. Fairly malty with toffee and caramel, and just the barest hint of milk chocolate at the edge. Finished with a solid but rather blunt hops bitterness that lingered at the back of the tongue. Overall, quite English in character. I'm surprised to see that the abv is 6.3% - my impression was of a higher alcohol content. Overall, a pleasant beer, but fell short of its full potential."
"Beautiful color of clear, deep, burgundy-amber. Somewhat sweet aroma, but barely imperceptible to me; some piney hits in the smell as well. Assertive malts within the malt-hop balance, but certainly not a malty beer in itself; hops serve merely as bittering and balance. More toward a fine English strong ale, and yummy."
"Glowing amber under a roof of fluffy bubbles drifting gobs of lace and cheer. Spicy fireside nose of hefty malt dusted with hops and comfort. Earth foots creamy caramel malt for a magical balance that soothes and excites. A choice brew for cold-weather quaffing."
"Gotta give some props to Davo for shipping this sample to me."
"It is dark copper, with a thin cream colored head. It does leave some thin lacing. It smells smoky to me with hops and fruit. It has a taste that is hoppy and still tastes a little smoky to me. Good mouthfeel and drinkable. The smokiness was not expected and I do not know if that is the ""real"" taste here or just how I perceive a flavor I am not accustomed to."
