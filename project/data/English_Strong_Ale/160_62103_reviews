"Too watery beer, hd higher expectations of this one..."
"o: An excellent ESB, very drinkable and full of malty goodness, with just enough slightly bitter fruit notes to keep the malt from being overly sweet.  I would definitely buy this again."
"O- Another great brew from Wynchwood. Lots of great characteristics that are typical of an English style Bitter. Malt forward but complimented nicely with a slight bitterness. Wynchwood's Hobgoblin is much more flavourful in my opinion but King Goblin is quite similar but with that added alcohol kick. I recommend."
"beer is ok and ac/dc are showing all the posers in the audience how it is done."
"This is a malt forward beer with notes of cookie, honey, toffee, and some toasted grains. The hops is very subdued but tastes of grass and herbs. The yeast lends flavors of dough and earth. The scents of cookie, toffee, toasted grains and earth are noticeable when bringing the glass to your mouth."
"Tastey beer. Should try it"
"One of the best from this brewer.  Lots of lovely hops waft over the big malt backbone . Tastes quite a bit like Bah Humbug"

"O) More sophistication in there than the nose suggests. Maybe I drank it too cold to get the full effect.  Would recommend as it represents value for money and offers a notch above the average English ales of 4-5% ABV."

"Overall, if this brew is truly only brewed under a full lunar moon, then that’s awesome.  This is not really of any benefit to the substance of the beer, but it is still an attractive gimmick.  The sweetness is there, but unfortunately it isn’t solely in the form of fruitiness.  It comes more from residual sugars and ethanol, making for a harsh-finishing beverage.  Otherwise it is hearty enough, and full enough, to keep you happy and warmed throughout.  Perhaps we should have waited for the full moon, so as to realized its full potential?!"

"Not a nice beer. Overly bitter and lacking in flavour compared to other goblins."

"Overall a very tasty beer."

"O: Its good and on the right path. I wish there was a little more alcohol and it was unfiltered which, in my opinion would have made it a little more interesting."
""
""
""
"Overall: a decent English heavy, if a little one-dimensional. Still, a decent sessional beer. Not sure the price is worth it though. The massive import taxes in Australia really hurt, else I would have this one a bit more often."

"This is the regular Hobgoblin on steroids."

"Serving type: bottle"

"*I tend to favor malty heavy brews."
"Overall, a nice, easy drinking clone of Hobgoblin. Small, rapidly diminishing head somewhat lowers the visual appeal for me, but still a reasonably priced reasonable ale."
""
""
""
"picked up after my fall hobgoblin purchase"
""
"Good feel to this beer: I make no secret about my preference towards malty, sweeter brews and this sits right in that slot for me. If this was brewed by some fancy Dan brewery people would be pontificating about it for ages, well they should do so even if it's from a Marston's subsidiary like Wychwood."
""
""
""
"Overall: Beers like this are what sparked my interest in beer. Very nice dark beer and a nice balance of bitterness on the tongue. I could guzzle down a few pints of these at a good English pub any day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Very nice beer, rather enjoyed this one and think it's the best product I've had from this brewery. Definitely would repurchase."
""
""
""
"Pours a dark copper with a rocky, 2-inch head that dissipates to a quarter-inch. Aromas of caramel malt and hops. Flavors of sweet caramel up front with with brown sugar and a mild hop bite. Finishes with an alcohol warmth. Creamy mouthfeel. Rich, smooth and malty beer. Very enjoyable, but nothing terribly extraordinary."
""
""
""
""
"Hazy dark orange-amber pour with a two finger off-white foamy head with minimal retention and decent lacing. The nose is malty and fruity with hints of caramel, banana, dark fruits, toffee, pear, apple, and subtle hops. The taste is malt forward as well with lots of dark fruits along with hints of toffee, tea, caramel apple, and nutty brown bread. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, slightly thick, with great balance and a subtle bitter hop finish. Overall, a pretty decent and drinkable beer..."

"500 ml bottle into pint glass, 2011 bottling. Pours lightly hazy deep ruby copper color with a 2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of caramel, pear, apple, toast, toffee, pepper, floral, grass, brown bread, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of malt, hop, and fruity yeast notes; with solid strength. Taste of caramel, toast, toffee, brown bread, pepper, floral grass, apple, pear, brown sugar, and floral/yeast earthiness. Moderate earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, brown bread, pepper, floral, grass, pear, apple, and floral/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice balance and robustness of malt, hop, and yeast ester flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a moderately creamy, slick, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a nice English strong ale. Good balance and robustness of malt, hop, and yeast flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A nicely enjoyable offering."
""
""
""
""
"Reminiscent of a young beer, something with a short secondary and a brief carbonation period. A creamy sweetness matched with a piney English bitterness."
""
""
"O - This is one of my favorite beers. I loved this brew and how it's Hobgoblin all grown up. I wish they had more of their selection out here. I love Wychwood! I'm a fan boy forsure!"
""
"Pours clear copper beer with moderate beige head, consisting of big and small bubbles, good retention. Aroma of dark fruits, strawberries, cherry, candy sugar, raisins. Taste is full, not very complex, warming alcohol, caramel, like most of british beers, leaning to malt profile, simple unnoble bitterness, that disappoints. Liquorish palate. Low carbonation, good at winter, worse in summer. Decent english strong ale."
""
""
"very decent however. I appreciate the attempt to balance it out. not as good as the 'other' common brew here- hobgoblin, but very good indeed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I'd have to do a side-by-side, but similar to what the Hobgoblin is flavor-wise, though obviously stronger. Not better, though. Less balance in this one. More brute malt force leading to a sweeter, boozier attack."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Enjoyable example of the style."
""
""
""
"Pours a cherry copper hue with a nice creamy three finger head and lacing everywhere,the smell is glazed cherries,earthy hops,toffee,marzipan and caramel,the mouthfeel is just under medium bodied and a bit over carbonated with tastes of toffee,earthy fruity hops,caramel,butterscotch and finished with those earthy hops and overall it's not bad and very English and ill buy again cheers."
""
""
""
"Just what the doctor needed during a cool night like this, full moon or not."
""
""
""
""
"M&O: the carbonation level is generally very decent, well complementing the rich body of malts and fruitiness but the palate is still semi-light; this full-bodied premium bitter or strong ale is richly-flavoured and decently dry-ish bitter in the finish, easily living up to the standards of Wychwood’s craftsmanship in general. Not bad."
""
""
""
"O: Very solid beer for not a lot of money and good for any occasion."
"Love the ""only brewed under a full moon"" schtick. This stuff pours a clear amber-russet topped by a finger of wan cream foam. The nose comprises maple syrup, light brown sugar, light red apple skin, light toasted biscuit, and the vaguest possible sense of candied orange peel. This is a strange amalgam of general fruitiness, sweetness, and spiciness. Diggin' the complexity, even if it means I can't pinpoint things entirely. The taste continues the complexity, but in a sideways direction: hints of old orange rind, dusty toasted biscuit, brown sugar, bad carrots, dark and musty greens, and grass. It's a sharply painful flavor at times, basically taking an evil mirror to the elements of the aroma. The body is a lithe medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda drying finish. Overall, this stuff just didn't do it for me. The flavors break the promises made by the smell and rub my face in their deceit."
""
"o - a good beer, but I think it's a little closer to average, maybe slightly above. My first couple of sips, I thought it was much better, but with the long aftertaste it turns to a bitter coffee. Still a decent option. I'm harsh on beer ratings, so maybe I'm rating this lower than it deserves."
""
""
""
""
"D - It's ok. not something I would seek out."
"Food Match: I know the festive season is over but the traditional Christmas fare would work a treat with this... oh well, next year."
""
"500 ml bottle. Pours dark red with an off-white, tall, long lasting, fluffy head. Aroma is of bready malt, caramel, earthy hops and cherry. Body is full and smooth. Earthy hops, caramel malt, ripe fruit and peppery notes fill the mouth. Finish is long, peppery. Delicious brew."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a deep reddish brown with a huge fluffy beige head that persists forever and sticks lots of lace to the glass. Smells of toffee and butterscotch with a hint of caramel and brown sugar. Hints of earthy hops provide some balance, but this one leans to the malts side of the equation. The flavor is quite sweet with toffee in spades along with brown sugar and caramel batting cleanup. Hints of earthy hop flavor, burnt sugar and mineral water attempt to provide a balance to the sweetness but its not enough. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet almost syrupy mouthfeel. Decent enough beer, but a bit on the sweet side."
"O: its a pretty decent beer, and a good starter for those getting into the micro/craft brews"
"Overall: This is an ok beer with nothing standing out but still enjoyable."
""
"Imagine drinking a Newcastle Brown Ale that was crossed with an IPA. Very dark red in color, not much of a head. Tastes very rich, with caramel notes but is yet still easy to drink. Nice balance between sweet and bitter. Good beer to curl up by a fire with during the long winters up here in Vermont."
"This is simply great stuff, and in my list of the top English Strong ales to date."
""
"O: A good beer. Having it right now with a steak sandwich and it's very complementary."
"O - This is a nice English Ale. I was hoping for more from a strong ale, though."
""
""
""
""
"The taste starts as the smell indicates (some residual caramelized sugars), but there's a good dollop of bittering hops which take over the flavor in the swallow. The aftertaste is a blend of the aforementioned hop along with a bit of warming alcohol. Very rich body, almost oily. Moderate carbonation."
""
""
""
""
"500ml bottle purchased for $4.99. I used to love hobgoblin back before I really got into craft and was mostly drinking British ales so i thought I'd try this for nostalgia's sake. Dark ruby red, creamy off-white head. Aroma of malt vinegar hits me almost immediately and this is what I usually pick up from British ales, not a fan. Flavor is very fruity, malty, not bad at all. Overall I wish I had my $5 back because this just isn't my cup of tea anymore."
"O- Decent beer to try. I never picked up wychwood until today, I may give their wit a go in the future, but nothing too extraordinary about this ale. For a fair price it's a fair beer."
""
""
""
"Overall: this is a decent beer, if possibly mis-categorized. I would definitely have this again."
"Quite enjoyable for a hot summer night. The fruity qualities help in this regard."
"The beer pours an amber red with nice amounts of carameling and some yellow along the edges. It also pours with a nice white head and good thick lacing that dissipates at a medium pace. Smells of sweet malts, almost an apple juice-like smell with a faint hint of biscuit in the back. Tastes again of sweet malts with a nice caramel backbone and an ever so slight tingle of hops on the tongue. There is a flavor in the initial swig that reminds me of sweet vegetables… Unfortunately that is the most specific I can be on the taste… Its swigs nicely on the tongue, a bit watery, but with just enough oomf to suggest its caramel flavor. Overall this is decent beer, I’m not as taken with it as I was with the HobGoblin, the wateriness of the beer is a little disappointing, though I’m sure it holds out well as an almost session-able ale."
""
""
"Overall, good session beer in taste - if not ABV :-)"
""
""
""
""
""
"O – This one is everything its weird little brother (Hobgoblin) wants to grow up to become; a very solid, flavorful, unique, dark English ale. I could just see sipping this by a fireplace in some quaint little pub in the English countryside. I’m a fan. Would recommend if you enjoy English style ales."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Probably not something Ill be on the lookout for in the future."
""
""
""
"M: Starts balanced and shows some bitterness or to say it better is a bittersweetness, sensation is long enough for a good ending nothing short and/or simple."
""
"Overall: they definitely over-sell it a bit; this ""special reserve"" is not particularly interesting, but the hop profile is nice. A good Bitter but nothing more than that"
""
""
""
""
"A malt job. Nothing special to look at (slight amber colour), neutral aroma, medium mouthfeel.Caramel, light toffee, light toast. Ok drinkable, but nothing special, another LCBO choice from their limited palate.Where are the nice balanced English ales?"
"Overall: Boring as hell"
"Poured a 1.5"" beige head with moderate lifespan. The body is a clear deep amber. The smell is good but a little less complex than Hobgoblin, with malt and toffee. The taste mirrors the malt and toffee smell plus there's lots of dried fruit and even a bit of banana esther in there. The moderate length finish highlights sweet toffee, not slow burn bitter hops like Hobgoblin. All in all I like it I just find it less interesting than their Hob to which I'm comparing it."
""
"O: It is bold and delicious and much better than Hobgoblin."
""
"This beers better than Hobgoblin. I'm a fan of traditional English beers, and this is another one that I've really enjoyed."
""
"O- Very mellow brew, this is probably my favorite from Wychwood Brewery. Very simple."
"Also, nice to see Wychwood using brown bottles now!! Hopefully their other beers are coming in such bottles now too."
""
"Overall this is a pretty good beer but not quite my style. A little too heavy and sweet."
""
"O: improved a bit with warming."
""
""
"Great strong ale that was enjoyed by myself, father, and grandfather. I don't typically come across a beer that all three of us would find outstanding, but this was one. A traditional English ale turned up up a notch with big malt and a assertive hop character. Would definitely recommend!"
"Overall: A beer that definitely needs to warm up to reach its full potential. For the price I cannot see myself buying it again, but it was enjoyable and went well with a Ploughman's lunch. The hops in this are interesting (piney at times and also classic English Bitter) and are well balanced again the higher level of malt. Well, King Goblin, I'll pay my respects to you, but will not pledge my fealty."
"O - I wouldn't call it ""extraordinary"" as the label does, but it is a flavourful and easy drinking strong ale, well worth a purchase"
""
""
"O - A tasty seasonal ale, some unique spiced characteristics, definitely worth a try."
""
""
""
""
"Definitely a must try."
""

"Pours a dark red, with a couple fingers of white head. A bit of lace sticks to the side of the glass, and a thin film sticks around. Nose has toffee, some earthy and dark breads notes, a hint of caramel and leather. A bit of dry sweetness and a light vinous note. Taste has some bitter caramel, toffee and dark bready notes. Again, a fruity vinous note comes through again, light bitterness in the finish. A touch drying, but sweet throughout as well. Medium heavy body. Decent drinkability. This was nice to try but I don't know how often I'd revisit this (as with most Wychwood offerings)."
""
"Drinkability: It's a smooth drinkable beer accompanied with good flavors and aromas."
""
"OK I gotta say this. The beer is nearly 5 bucks and frankly I can't justify doing this beer again at anything close to that. 16.6 oz so yeah I'm used to the premium that somehow gets placed on singles, but it is absurd! This beer is about the same price of Bastard, which btw if you over hopped this I might compare it to. I hear this is a brown ale and I'm missing the nutty flavors I expect in that style. Regardless of style I really enjoy this one. (half point deduction for price)"
"Overall: Not bad, provides a bit more of, well, everything to fill the woeful void of character the standard Hobgoblin harbors."
"Perfect concept for Halloween, but probably not a beer I'll purchase again."
"King Goblin makes a wonderful beer for a moondance, whatever that means. It has a strong (and actually fairly distinct) flavour profile has a certain 'English' character to it that extends beyond the overtly earthy, herbal, Noble-esque quality of its Sovereign hops. It is an inherently good companion to dark, chilly evenings."
"Overall – An above average beer that was tasty and enjoyable. I think I was expecting the taste to be a little more bold and over the top based on the whole 'king' thing, but it was still good nonetheless. I'm not going to rush out to buy more, but I'm glad I gave it a try."
"Overall, a nice easy drinking variant of the Hobgoblin. Pick it up if you like robust malty English strongs."
"Body seems pretty thin."
"Yet another quality product from Wychwood and one of the best English ales I've had in a while. Took me two just to BA. Ironically, the others I've really liked lately have been Goliath and Wychcraft."
"This beer had decent head retention, decent lacing and good mouthfeel - nice brown color, a nice hop profile both on bitterness and taste/aroma. Good bold taste and well balanced. I quite enjoyed this one, and would buy this again, overall: another nice product from Wychwood"
"M - Light to medium body with a slight chew. Moderate carbonation."
"This appears to be a pumped up Hobgoblin. It's labelled ""Special Reserve"" and has 6.6% alcohol per volume. It looks good in the glass with lots of carbonation and fuzzy head. kind of looks like a cola in fact. The taste however is nothing to get excited about. it's fine. It has a chalky texture on the palette. It's a big bottle so there's a lot here but I wouldn't seek this one out again."
"Overall - Very drinkiable and tasty. Totally what you look for and expect in a english ale. This beer drinks like a 3.5-4% alcohol Level. If you enjoy hobgoblin you will love this."
"Clear copper colour, 1.5 fingers of dense tan/off white head, lots of lace left on the glass. Smeel is biscuity and malty up front, fairly hoppy in the nose, lemon, citrus fruit, some pie crust like scents as well. Taste is a little sweet up front, caramel and toffe, bread/biscuit flavours, moderate bitterness with nice citrus notes in the finish. Light to med carbonation,creamy and full body, nice weight. This was quite good, it definitley won me over as I kept drinking, one of the better offerings from Wychwood."
"O- I've always enjoyed Hobgoblin as an occasional treat and this one is an even better treat."
"I really like the standard Hobgoblin ale, been drinking these ales since I lived in California back in 2001. Pours a deep ruby chestnut amber with a light khaki head, forms thick nicely retained head dwindling slow leaving behind speckled lacing with each sip. Aroma has a nice rolling fruitiness rich malt character with a touch of caramel and dark fruit with hint of a vinous/tart white grape character. Flavor is pretty dry a herbal tea earthy herbal hop character going through with each sip, moderate dark roasted malt character. A nice balanced beer not overtly sweet or one dimensional in anyway which makes for a nice fall beer. Pretty boozey for an English ale, compared to other fall seasonal ales. Again easy to drain the 500 ml bottle and completely enjoyable, my kind of English ale."
"Split a 22oz. Another winner from Wychwood Brewery. Similar to the staple HobGoblin from Wychwood with a bit more flavor and kick. I actually enjoyed this more than a HobGoblin but certainly this one is a beer that might get a bit much after one or two bottles. While English Beers are not my thing, I thoroughly enjoyed this one. Give this one a shot as well as the other fine beers from Wychwood Brewery. You'll be glad you did."
"Pours a clear amber color with a 1 inch puffy beige head that settles to a thin cap. Random streaks of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of sweet malt, unidentifiable fruits, citrus zest, and an alcohol zing. Taste is of sweet malt, citrus and other types of fruits, and a bitter hop finish. The bitterness is very dry and lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a clean and dry finish. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with an unexpected fruity flavor. However, the bitterness on this one doesn't sit well with me."
"O- Its my fifth or sixth beer of the night so my description is probably a little lacking. I enjoyed finding this and enjoyed drinking it. Well balanced but it can be a little overly sweet at times. Good beer. Glad I found it. Another good offering from Wychwood."
"O: King Goblin is only brewed on a full moon so yeh, its kinda cool. A notch above 6.5 this King can cut loose. Not as malty as its subordinate and a nice change up from the Hobgoblin, but personally I'll let the King have his swill and drink with the grunts."
"A very nice English brown ale."
"I like this English Swill."
"O- This beer is very mellow with some soft dry malt and soft hops, being mostly bitterness. There is an odd character in the aroma and the taste that could be age or ringwood yeast it is slightly vinous aswell, but because the beer is so soft that flavor sticks out."
"This beer was really more of an English Pale Ale than a strong ale. And for that style, it was about average. I will always remember this beer for it's name, which should obviously be ""David Bowie, the Goblin King."" Yup."
"This is a drinkable beer. The flavors are balanced and not overpowering."
"The carbonation could stand to be a bit less, but its not entirely out of style. A nice, richer version of the Wychwood classic and one of their better beers."
"O: This is one of Wychwood's better efforts. A very solid, drinkable beer."
"With a mere 6.6% abv., the beer is much more akin to a more robust English brown ale than Southern browns usually exhibit, but as the trend upwards in gravity, strength, and flavor continue, perhaps this is the new stride in English browns. ...and Wychwood can say that they were there first."
"All right, I guess."
"Pours clear dark amber with an off white head. Some lacing all the down the glass. It smells of toasted malt with caramel and a light chocolate characteristic. The flavor is sweet, roasted caramel malt with good balancing bitterness. It finishes with some toasty, toffee accented bitterness. This brew is quite enjoyable. Smooth, just a hint of Alcohol on the back end. It's been some time since I had a Hob Goblin, it's time to compare it to it's big brother."
"-JH-"
"This is an excellent representative of the ESB style, but it isn't unique enough for me to go out of my way to find it again. I tasted it in comparison with similar-tasting Fuller's London Pride, and King Goblin is definitely the better beer, but not by a ton. It seems a little pointless for me to describe the characteristics of King Goblin because I'd just be parroting descriptions of the English ESB style. It does have good mouthfeel, good carbonation. Tastes malty, toasty, a bit solvent. This is is a good ESB and it won't jump out and surprise you either positively or negatively."
"Features a mature, full bodied flavor and aftertaste but has too much carbonation, especially at the outset. Light in texture and easy drinking. Complex with nice balance. A well crafted heir to the Hobgoblin throne."
"A nice bitter, and it's actually bitter. Beyond that, not much to say."
"O- Drinks very easily. Very solid beer, definitely worth a try. I could picture myself drinking pints upon pints of this stuff at a pub in England all day, then stumbling my way back to the hotel. Good stuff."
"A good strong ale that probably will gain of some cellaring."
"O=A solid ESB, but it doesn't meet my expectations. For a beer that is this highly touted by the brewer, it needs to back it up with a higher quality flavor."
"Mouthfeel has a low-medium body. Carbonation is mild. At 6/6% ABV it is pretty easy to drink one bottle. I'm not sure a second bottle would be a good idea. It is probably a good idea to switch things up after this."
"Overall: The body of the beer is medium light and the finish is medium. This is a good easy drinking beer that can make for a session beer."
"O: Very smooth. A sipping-beer."
"I've always been a fan of wychwoods hobgoblin- so I was pretty excited to see this king goblin special reserve. I really like the coloring of this beer a really rich deep brown. The smell is of faint spices. The taste is a strong bitter. This is what I think of when I think of an english beer. Makes me wanna go sit in a pub and watch some rugby."
" Grade F Purchased at Stoney's -- $4.99 bottle"
"Overall a typically English beer. I liked it."
"Overall, this is a great example of a bottled strong bitter. But until I can try a cask version of the 'king' goblin, I'll stick with Hobgoblin next time I buy a Wychwood ale"
"A full grown ESB, much taste and stamina."
"Final Notes: A very good beer with lots of flavor and complexity. Not exactly a session beer, but a great all-purpose beer nonetheless. I dig it."
"Taste is wonderful, complex, balanced with nutty-toasty bread crust, dried fruits, caramelized fruit, grain and tea, with a lot of earthy-tea bitterness to balance the sweetness, along with wood, spice, and herbal hints."
"Powerhouse of a beer. I want more!!"
"D - An english ale of the highest quality"
"Hobgoblin has been a long-time favorite of mine and ESBs are one of my preferred styles. This is definitely one of the better and more sessionable (despite the 6.6% ABV) ones I've tried. Now...hopefully I can find more."
"A decent ESB and a nice one off from Wychwood."
"This beer tastes like I'm drinking an antique shop, but in a good way. It also tastes exactly like its color, and its color is something that takes me back to before I was born. And it's so beautiful, too. It looks like it really IS something. Looking at this beer, and then drinking it, and then looking at it again, and then drinking it again... it helps to counter nihilistic perspectives. This beer is that sort of thing."
"Verdict: Super-unique offering from this UK brewer is sure to please some and repulse others. Find and try for weirdness' sake."
"Quite possibly one of the better examples I've had. If you want an example of how beer should be, check this out. Drinkable (albeit not quite a session ale) and good enough for a couple of pints."
"All in all a pretty good ESB. I'm not overly versed in the style, but I liked it a lot, I'm glad I made the purchase."
"Was hoping this beer would redeem this Tolkeinesque brewery in my eyes but it has unfortunately only reconfirmed my longstanding impressions."
"Drinkability: After reading the other reviews, i may have just gotten an older bottle that was not preserved well but was fairly disappointed. Wanted more complexity before the hops hit me and also more body/head."
"D: this is a great ESB. Much tastier and drinkable than Hobgoblin. Would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a nice, well balanced, English ESB."
"D: Let me first say, that I love just about anything from the ENG, SCO, and ROI. This style is a favorite, but for some reason I don't love it. It's a solid ESB, but think the flavor + smell could be a little more accessible. Give it a try, I could be wrong and hey I may have to try it again, just to be sure. :)"
"D: Overall this is a good beer, but I find the extremely grassy finish a little off-putting."
"T: Toffee, caramel malts with a slight bitterness. Very nice tasting beer."
"Dr: This beer grows on you as you drink it, but ultimately there are better beers to be had at this price point (particularly here in Ireland). Don't write it off if you're a fan of the style, but don't expect it to lift your skirt up."
"The mouthfeel is medium-full, slightly slick. Overall I enjoyed this beer very much, a little too caramely for an ESB in my opinion but still a quality offering."
"D- Glad I tried it, but don't need to have it again."
"Pours a very nice mid-deep copper color with great initial head, non-lasting, and a bit of nice lacing. Great scent, very citrusy and deep malty aromas. Great taste, a huge malty backbone that's deep and strong; great earthy fuggle hops up front with a very slight citrus tone at the end; hints of chocolate and caramel in the flavor. Goes down wonderfully smooth with just a bit of hop roughness. Great beer."
"This beer is a light brown color...like a dark cedar color...with faint, wispy head. The aroma is great: caramel and bread, a passing scent of alcohol, toasted malt, and earthy hops. The flavor is very well balanced: firm bitterness and a great malt presence. Finishes dry. Medium in body. This is a great drinking beer."
"Overall, a pretty good ESB. Certainly worth a try."
"Overall not to bad, but I have had much better ESB's at much lower prices."
"Reddish brown color with two fingers of head that had good retention before settling to a thick cap. Heavy lacing was left on the glass. Aroma is a bit subdued but it is pleasant with sweet malt and a little citrus. Quite malty flavor with notes of toffee and caramel. Bitterness is there but not much flavor from the hops. Just a little unidentifable fruit. Plenty of body resulting in a filling beer. Nice carbonation. Pleasant drinking beer with some clean flavors."
"D - This was a pretty drinkable beer. It went down pretty smooth, and it made me want more after each drink. I liked Hobgoblin better, but I think that this is a real nice brew. This is my first beer of this style, and I am excited to try more. Cheers."
"A medium-heavy mouthfeel leaves the drinker in no doubt that that this is a beer. Overall a thoroughly excellent beer, but at a fairly hefty price and 6.6% alcohol volume this is not going to become my regular tipple, but a nice occasional treat."
"Poured my King Goblin into a glass, it poured to a very deep reddish color with a nice thick head that retained well. Smells fairly malty smell with very light fruity sweetness in the background. Tastes great malty beginning and gives off some great chocolate and toffee flavors that finish fairly mild nicely. A great backbone to this brew. Mouthfeel; being a fairly strong beer with alcohol content, it's not as heavy as I thought it'd be. Nice and smooth. Overall drinability is an excellent beer for these rainy days we've been having. Warms you up nicely and tastes great."
"Note: Apparently the first beer I've given straight 4's. Interesting, but in keeping with my experience with this beer. Everything was good; very little was either mediocre or excellent. Take this as you will."
"D. Hobgoblin's BIG brother. Although it is available year round it is a good winter warmer. A little pricey but still nice to have one every so often."
