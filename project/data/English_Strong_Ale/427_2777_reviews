"Enjoyable but huge booziness."

"A fairly average strong ale. Very yeasty and slightly sweet, but lacking in malt flavours and aroma. I guess I'd expect the style to have a darker and more distinct malt character. No aromatic hops, and the bitterness is dry and harsh. There are certainly better beers out there - give it a miss."
"M: The ending is the best part because it last really long it is very bitter at the end and can be felt in the back part of the mouth."
"D - I'm not sure this beer is categorized correctly. To me it's a very good quality EPA, Whatever it is this beer is a very solid brew."
"Dr: It hides its alcohol well, and if I were a fan of the style, I'd have another. It's not horribly ambitious, but what it tries to do it does well."
"500 ml bottle pours nicely into my 300 ml ""pint"" glass. Minimal head leads to some lacing in glass. Nice dark golden colour. Smell is not overly assaulting to the senses. I was hoping for more piney citrusy sensation. Taste is average, once again, not as hoppy as anticipated, just a mild sensation of hops, very mild malts and some alcohol warmth. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied. Drinkability is fine-certainly more desirable to an American macrobeer from the big three. I would try again but there are other strong pale ales that would end up in my cart first."
"D- If this was available on tap, I'd be ordering this often. I can see myself drinking this as a nice session beer. The alcohol is well hidden, it's refreshing, flavorful and is easy to drink. Would go excellent with pub food. I recommend trying this one out."
"I liked it better than ""Pedigree"" and will probably buy it again."
"Quite smooth for a fairly well carbonated beer, the hops only become apparent in the aftertaste and then only with significant concentration. Otherwise there is a pleasant but unremarkable caramel tinged malt domination."
"D - I didn't have to pour it down the sink, but I'm not heading back to the store for another one, either."
"Overall, it's a lot more drinkeable than you might expect for a 6.2ABV beer. Clean and tasty."
"Given the ABV, very drinkable if you get some fresh bottles which I was lucky enough to find. No clear bottle skunk here."
"Not a bad drink at all, but not something I'll be impressing any friends with. I have a feeling the 6.2% might come back to hurt me later."
"Overall: pleasant strong ale. The alcohol is there but not as a preponderant feature. I liked the bitterness of this one. Not outstanding but quite an enjoyable experience nevertheless."
"Keep an eye out for this on draught/cask."
"Pours a medium copper, exceptionally clear and with obvious effervescent carbonation rising in abundance. A fairly bright white head that builds to about two fingers before subsiding gradually to a nice, thick covering on the surface of the beer which leaves decent lacing. Smell is just a touch off, caramel obvious and a bit of butter. Slight hops, a bit of light fruits. Taste is fuller, lots of malts with some noticeable alcohol. Slight hop bitterness, nothing to write home about. Mouthfeel is very well carbonated, full bodied and very pleasing. Drinkability is quite good. Pretty average, but they need to lose the clear bottles."
"50 cl. bottle. Pretty copper colour. Not much foam, and fades very quickly. The usual sulphur limestone aroma, that can be found later in the mouth too, with a hint of citrus and fruits. Medium to light body. Taste, besides the sulphur, is fruity, pine, some honey and a bit of cookies."
"M&D: with a lively mouthfeel throughout, this is a reasonable, not particularly strong, English beer in need of a more assertive character here and there. Not complex enough for a 6.2%abv. strong ale and the body is a bit too thin. Dare I say that this is a story to English bitter a strong, malty lager to Pilsner?--that is, missing the delicate elements while not being bold and satisfying enough. Won't buy it again unless it's on sale..."
"Nice deep amber colour as visible through the clear bottle. Smell is a flat malty smell, with a bit of hops to it. Nothing spectacular. Flavour: malt with a tad of hop bitterness, and an underlying sweetness. Nothing overwhelmingly amazing, but still a somewhat unique taste. I find the mouthfeel a bit tingly, but not terrible. Alcohol content limits the drinkability somewhat; this is quite a pint to put away."
"Other comments: A bit of a let-down after the last beer I reviewed (Fuller's Golden Promise) and the skunkiness didn't help its case. Clear bottles are inexcusable!"
"Clear 500ml bottle. This strong ale looks somewhat orange in tbe bottle; in the glass it is a very attractive peach/nectarine colour. Transparent and rich in appearance. I had to pour fairly vigorously to get the head a decent size, but when it stopped churning at about 1 cm, it was creamy, with some patches and holes in the foam. Cream coloured, with fine, slow lacing left on the glass. Delicious English hops, sweet bread and caramel at first in the nose. I can never seem to get enough of these butterscotch-goldings or fuggles combinations. A lovely hit of buttery roasted malt, just sweet enough to balance the spicy vinous hop. A respectable balance. Raisins and cream, definite vanilla, sourish green hop freshness, and roasted nuts. The flavour is all malt at the front of the tongue, but the hops make their dryness quite early, in the middle of the tongue, following through to the finish where it is all bitter. Yet, the malt can still be detected equally, and the whole flavour, though favouring the hops, is exceptionally balanced. Caramel, some spiciness, raisins, maple syrup, dry bread, lactosed malt in the finish. A very tasty English pale, but not as complex as some. Mouthfeel is a perfect carbonation, and very full. Easy to quaff, cold day or hot. A respectable beer which I would definitely buy again."
"500ml Bottle sampled from a Guinness glass. Pours with amber clear colour with no significant head retention. There is a malty, sour mash nose with almost metallic notes. The taste comes on slow with the 3M attack: malt, (sour) mash, and hints of maple. Developing into roasted malt, with a slight astringency, and a smooth and slightly creamy mouthfeel. The aftertaste is again in the sour malt/mash vein, which is quite nice for a while but evolves into bitterness after not too long. Overall its not bad and has reasonable drinkability but sadly enough, I wouldnt put it much above something like Kokanee Gold. I suppose this ones just not for me."
"This is the same colour as Pedigree but the tastes are very different. The bitterness is higher and so is the taste of alcohol in the finish. I wished for more hops but this is a decent enough beer. Given the choice though I would drink the Pedigree as it offers a more multi-faceted set of flavours at a lower alcohol."
"Pours out thin, a clear medium copper hue with minimal head. Metallic grains hit the nose first, some caramel malt surfacing behind them, and then some herbal hops behind that. Curious combination of boozy sweet malt accompanied by a dry husky texture on the initial flavour, where it flattens out to a smoother boozy sweetness in the middle and finish, and the hops make a tardy appearance well into the aftertaste. Not much of a balancing act going on. The mouthfeel is average, a bit watery for a 6.2% abv ale. After half of a glass it is not sitting very well with me. A pass on this one next time."
"A fairly good ale"
"Tasty, nice to look at, but I'd imagine tough for some folks to get past their nose."
"Drinkablilty: very enjoyable beer. this could be had on a daily basis even if it's not my favorite pale ale."
"Pleasant, manly beer here."
"A nice product once you get past Pepe La Pew..(sp)"
