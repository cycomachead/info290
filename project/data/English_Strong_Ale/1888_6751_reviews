"Overall: I really enjoyed this beer, nothing was overbearing & the combination of it's features really made me wish I had a few more in the fridge. I'd definitely buy this beer again."

"Specifically the draft version brewed in Lake Placid. The bottle doesn't compare"

"O - A strong ale that doesn't really shine in the flavor department. It is certainly strong in some aspects but unbalanced."

"Poured into pint glass from bottle. Very dark, almost black. Like soda. A strong aroma and taste. Long lasting bitter aftertaste. Sticks on the tongue for a bit. Kind of a earthy flavor. Very low carbonation. Overall it is a pretty good beer. Will try again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a 12 oz tulip glass, not sure of the bottle date. Pours a dark brown, with a quarter inch of white head, minimal lace. Smell is toffee, biscuit, fig, and molasses. Taste is similar, toffee and biscuit in the beginning and fig in the finish, with some caramel. Body is almost medium, could use a little more carbonation, not overly dry, and drinks easy enough. This is solid for the style."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Tasty beer. A lot darker than expected. Interesting earthy/woody flavor that lingers with a back of the tongue finish."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A friend gave me this beer to try. A very OK beer. It really didn't wow me or impress me, but I wasn't turned off by it either. Completely drinkable. This would be a good beer to have when you want something that's slightly robust but you want only one."
""
""
"Overall Drinkability: An ok beer, but not a great, hearty example of a strong ale."
"T-it has a smell that is very different from the taste"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability is ok. So little flavor that it is effortless to drink, but it's far from inspiring or anything I'd want to drink again given a choice."

"This beer was a pleasant surprise. I found myself in Utica, NY for work, and the trip wasn't so great, but then I found this! Awesome."
""
""
""
"Would drink again for sure. Much better than expected."
"The best from this brewery- then again they don't have many other good options."

"O - Pretty good beer, nice firm taste, nothing too special, hides the alcohol well, nothing great but nothing bad, just a nice good session beer for my tastes."
""
""
""
""
"Poured into nonic pint glass; dark brown/black in the glass with a huge fluffy brown head. Smells malty, sweet and boozy. Taste is similar to a barleywine, except with an odd bitterness to it, almost like...the aftertaste of cheese, is the only way to describe it. It works with the style; lots of lacing on the glass as it's drunk, a delicious and hearty beer."
""
"O: This beer is rather drinkable considering its strength and completely hides any traces of alcohol. The taste isn't very complex so I doubt that I would have more than one of these in a single sitting."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall/Comments: Not a bad beer overall although I was a bit thrown by the musty aroma. The flavor contained non of that must and proved to be very appealing. Classified as an English Strong Ale @ 7% ABV. Consumed 6/4/2013."
""
"O - Very impressed, probably in my Top 15 beers now. Lot's of great taste without being too sweet or bitter. Goes great with food. Highly recommend."
""
""
""

""
""
""

""
""
"Overall a very good malty ale. Highly flavorful."

"O: Nothing to really brag about with this brew, it was a nice tasting beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I poured this pretty average beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer poured a dark reddish looking color. The beer really did not pour much of a head though. The taste was a combination of caramel and roasted malty taste that was not too bad. I'm thinking I will try this beer again and hope I could find it on tap."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I liked this beer but would not try it to often."
""
""
""
""
"Overall an enjoyable, average strong ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: An interesting beer that sort of resides in the middle of a bunch of styles - American Strong Ale, English Strong Ale, a hopped up American Brown, and even an American Black Ale (along the lines of a Victory Yakima Glory). I've had this beer dozens and dozens of times - including at the brewpub in Lake Placid - and was surprised to discover recently that I'd never reviewed it. Solid stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
"A very nice English- style ale overall, Ubu is worth a try if you can find it."
""
""
""
"I like this beer a lot. Gonna go to the brewery tomorrow and try it on tap (I'm in the area)."
""
""
""
""
""
"Very tasty and strong, with a slight aftertaste that you expect from a stronger ale."
""
""
""
"Dark Brown w/ chestnut highlights. One finger, light beige head that dissipated, clung and laced. Smells of sweet malty caramel and chocolate. Taste is same caramel and chocolate. It is semi-sweet throughout and hops only bitter. Mouthfeel is creamy and linger is just about right. This is an absolutely fantastic brew that must be tried. Only wish they sold it locally."
""
""
""
""
"O - Interesting in that it is a lighter type of Strong Ale. I could see this going well on a cold northern NY night."

"-Overall 4.0: Very good to excellent strong ale. This is somewhere between a porter and a stout and just very enjoyable. If you are a fan of unique beers THAT ARE ACTUALLY ENJOYABLE this is the brew for you. If you find it, buy it."

"Pours dark amber-red with a creamy off-white head that settles to a thin haze and ring. Malty aromas of toasted grain, caramel, toffee, and fruity yeast. More caramel and toffee flavors, but not a ton of unique character in this one. Just tastes like a generic malt-forward...beer. Mouthfeel is crisp and drinkable, with a medium body and good carbonation. Decent enough beer overall. Doesn't re-invent the wheel."
"Not as good as I remember it, but still an OK beer. Heavy and rich, but worth the risk of trying it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Notes: Not as strong as I thought is might be but still decently drinkable. Cheers."
""
""
"Overall a beer I enjoy again and again. Would recommend to anyone, especially those who enjoy a good porter."
""
""
""
"This beer pours a clear reddish brown with a thin head and lastin fine lace. It's aroma is of dark fruit with a hint of molasses. The flavor leads with coffee with dark cherry and plum notes. The coffee fades and chocolate covered cherry comes through as it warms. The mouthfeel is medium and there is a pleasant warmth in the finish. Lake Placid Ubu Ale is a good beer, recommended."
""
"O- Overall a solid beer that I am happy I have more of. Definitely would like to try more Lake Placid beers."
"OK, NOT MUST TRY!"
""
""
""
""
"Not bad. Judging by the bit of oxidation I taste, this may be an old bottle. But the beer below is still quality. Tasty English strong ale stuff."

"Thanks to mjtiernan for the chance to taste this one- a new beer I have not heard of yet. Poured from bottle into DFH Snifter. Pours a pretty dark brown/black color, thick off white head sits on top and stays for awhile. Nice looking brew. Smell- raisins, prunes, brown sugar, dark cherries. Taste- raisins, prunes, brown sugar. Matches the nose well. Mouthfeel is super creamy, makes for great drinkability. Nothing too complex here, but this is a nice brew that I would have again."

"Very tasty American Strong Ale...kind of has some Belgian Strong Ale qualities going on as well."

"Though it is not on the label this is very Scotch Ale in style."

"awesome awesome beer. the flagship from lake placid now widely reknowned as da bomb! pours dark brown with a great thick tan head, smells like english malts and alcohol. taste is very english in nature as well, definitely an ale. more happening than a standard brown ale, but with a similar base. notes of tobacco and brown sugar are present as well. the thing that makes it interesting is its complexity and uncanny drinkability for its abv. it is very strong beer, and while full bodied, it isnt mean and nasty in the gut. a six pack will get you shitfaced long before it fills you up, and its a very heavy buzz from this one. i like to drink it year round, but the fall is most appropriate. also delicious in a bottle and ultimate on tap at their brewery with some of the parmesean chicken wings!!!"

"Lake Placid does a really nice job with this beer, like I said, great for its price range, and just the right amount of malt and flavor."
"One of my favorites, rich malty taste with a bit of hops in the back ground. Nutty,toffee caramel taste and a rich creamy feel on the tongue. Lake Placid is one of my favs and this beer a go to when i feel like drinking a six and catching a nice buzz..."

"The mouth has low carbonation and mid-level heft."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, it's good. Nothing to write home about, but definitely worth a try."
""
"Drink- Not a huge beer by any means. Has a good profile but has a more English layering effect. A bit thin in parts but still tasty. Don't know if I would have this again with Stone Arrogant in my back yard."
"Had this on tap at the brewery and liked it more; the mouthfeel was smoother and a bit creamier and the booze was tamed a bit. I understand the bottles are contract brewed and are not done nearly as well as the brewery does it in smaller batches. Eh, probably wouldn't order or buy this one again. Not particularly outstanding."
"O: The flavor of this beer wasn’t the best, and the mouthfeel could use some work, but overall this wasn’t as terrible as some people make it sound. I would certainly drink this over a large variety of other similar tasting beers out there. Thanks again for giving me the chance to try it, Austen."
"Had this at the Lake Placid Pub & Brewery in the Adirondacks and it was excellent. $3.50/pint. Poured a dark mahogany with an inch off-white foamy head leaving a consistent amount of lacing along the glass. Smell was sweet and malty. Taste was also sweet, slightly bitter, with a good amount of carbonation. for the 7.00% abv, this was an exceptionally easy beer to drink. thumbs up."
"It has a dark, yet smooth taste and feel to it. It goes down real easy. It leaves you with a pleasant after-taste that left my mouth watering. It was definitely the local kind of taste I had been anticipating. I will definitely order it again when I see my brother."
"D: Second sixer of oxidized beer from this brewery. Oxidized in the bottle, but not at the brewery - Grrr….. As is, it still has some really good bits – but oxidation is too distracting."
"O- not a bad beer but doesn't have the complexity it should for the style."
"Overall, very enjoyable. The big range of scores here seems to indicate it isn't consistent, though. Too bad."
"Overall: A decent little brew definitely worth a try"
"Pours a very nice dark brown, rich, creamy brown head...long-lasting with delicate lacing. Very beautiful in the glass. Aroma is sweet, caramel with hints of dark chocolate. Then things begin to go poorly...the beer's taste is malty yet overwhelmingly dominated by roasty and strange molasses flavors that don't mesh well. Overcarbonated, with a sharp, stinging carbonation."
"I was pleasently surprized with this beer. I was expecting something like an amber ale, but this style took me back a bit."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a very dark brown color with a 1 inch head. Smell is dominated by malts, a touch of yeast. Taste is malts up front, some hops, just a touch of alcohol. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall is a good quality beer."
"O-pretty good if they had this beer around here it would probably be a regular in my fridge but since they don't I must continue my search and keep trying other beers. :)"
"This is a fairly dark ale, perhaps best described as reddish-brown. The flavor is malty, though this hop-lover found the nutty taste quite palatable -- and somewhat sweet. I would not say it tastes of chocolate, but it perhaps hints of it. The hops do arrive by the end and I very much appreciated that balance. It is an interesting American version of an English Strong Ale and worth a taste. The alcohol content is robust (7.0%), so the beer has a kick."
"O – Alcohol very well hidden. Personally, I’d call this a Porter with a high ABV. A good beer, which I enjoyed more on the second sitting 4.0"
"Overall: This type of strong ale reminds me of a smooth summer time drink that one turns to when they're feeling extremely dehydrated. I'm sorry, but I like my strong ales to be, well, strong (not in the ABV category, but according to my smell and taste receptors)."
"O-I haven't had anything else from Lake Placid but this beer is decent and was worthy the retry."
"O- Really nice beer from Lake Placid here, pleasantly surprised by this beer that I hadn't heard until about 20 seconds before I poured it into my glass."
"Overall- a nice beer that I found enjoyable, by the end of the review I wish to note approval of the 7% ABV which took no time to warm me up. Also a pleasant surprise. Very decent, acceptable brew."
"O: This one is easy for me to find here in NY and is reasonably priced- so it makes it a nice go to beer. Not my favorite version of the style however. If someone asked me if I would want one I would definitely take it- can drink 4-5 of these no problem."
"An interesting beer for sure. A big malt body with nice hop, but all the balance is towards the malty front. A good beer but not something I'd buy very often."
"O (D) - interesting, pretty good. Malt forward."
"Overall this is a very nice and enjoyable beer that is very easy to drink. I would certainly not hesitate picking it up the next time you see it. Enjoy!!!"
"Maybe this past its prime, either way this failed to excite me"
"I match my friends sentiments. This is a very good beer."
"Overall - Not impressed, this is a beer i am happy i tried, but not something that blows my mind."
"Average ale, certainly much better on the market."
"This beer rocks. I am not an official beer tester, so I won't try to impress you with terms I don't normally use. This beer is thick and tasty and that is what I'm always on the hunt for.I LOVE this beer !!!! If you l want to experience what I believe beer tasted like back in the Colonial days and before mass produced watery beer became the norm, then this is an excellent selection. Highly recommended by me. Enjoy!"
"Recommended. Taken this camping and woodsmoke in the air just kicks it up another gear IMO."
"The Rest: Body is on the thin side of medium, and drinkability is OK. The balance isn't great on this beer."
"Drink - I've had this previously on tap and it had a really pleasing scent. The bottle didn't seem to do it justice. Still an above average beer and highly drinkable given the alcohol level."
"Pours dark brown/black with a touch of foam at the top but very little. Chocolately smell. Malty. Light coffee taste, mild hop throughout. Subtley carbonated. Residual cola taste. Very drinkable, solid beer."
"The beer was really good, the rich flavor probably would limit me to only one or two of these."
"Black colored beer with a slowly fading head.Aroma is chocolate malts.Taste is cocoa,hops and sugar cane.The alcohol gives a nice warming.Overall a good beer that is perfect for a cold winter day.I would recommend to try at least once and I would certainly purchase this again."
"D- Very drinkable. Not a session beer for the faint of heart (7%), but a worthy member of the rotation."
"D- Drinkable def, very tasty."
"As strong ales go, this one is a 98-lb weakling. I thought at first it was just too cold so I let it sit for a while; as it warmed, it gained nothing. The aroma is thin; the taste is flat except for a brief peek from some Cokey pepper. Lake Placid? More like Lake Flaccid. Not a great choice."
"easy to drink, and paired well with a barbaque dinner."
"Nice to finally try this, but where does this fit into my beerin' life-style? Noteworthy, I suppose."
"D - Don't really care for it much. has a funny cheap alcohol taste to it. I'm glad to have tried it but don't intend to try it again."
"M: Extremely smooth. Carbonation is appropriate and excellently balanced with the medium body of the beer."
"Dark brown body pours with a half finger white creamy head.'quite pleasant. Smells sweet and caramelized, a faint hop smell, some musty quality too. Overall good smell. Tastes starts sweet and coating, medium full body average carbing makes this 7% slide down nicely. On the finish there is something that I can't describe better than funky, not in a bad way, it's interesting and tasty all at once. I'd pick this up again. $1.70 a single at BoTW Rochester."
"Mouthfeel is thinner than beers with this much dark malt character. This makes it a very easy drink. Rich in flavor, but the light body and carbonation makes it an easy one to put down. One of the best beers we've got here in Upstate New York."
"I'm disappointed. This is a shell of what Ubu Ale used to be."
"D - The flavors are well balanced together and the chocolate malt flavor works well. The beer is overall pretty creamy, but the carbonation is just right to keep it smooth. Very drinkable."
"Overall, I do enjoy this brew but the taste just is not enough to really blow me away"
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, while there are others in the style I would pick first this is still a solid beer worth drinking for a while."
"D - I think this ale is quite good and I could certainly have more than one."
"It felt great going down - nearly full-bodied, with a creamy taste. Similar to some other American Strong Ales, but mostly just the good ones. Drinkability takes a hit from the high abv, but it's a strong ale so it should be a bit higher, and taste-wise this is a repeater."
"This is an exceptional brown ale that is relatively strong, but very easy drinking. It's backbone is solid roasted malt profile, but is not overly sweet. It finishes dry and there is almost no hint of alcohol. A good pick when your in the mood for a smooth dark beer."
"D - Really high considering the abv. Alcohol hides well behind the mix of flavours. A good find."
"D: Good ale, an easy drinker. Nice way to end the day."
"Not exactly a normal ale, and more like a stout, but a very good beer which I've enjoyed several times. The flavor leaves a nice coffee aftertaste and this beer always goes down easy."
"Notes: What I enjoyed most about this beer is its finishing flavor. After it has progressed nicely over the pint, the last sip leaves you with a nice bready malt finish that was great."
"d - An ok strong ale. Some nice fruity malts; would try again."
"The beer pours a red-amber color with a white head. The aroma is toffee with some earthy and dirty hops. The flavor is toffee, earthy hops and some fruit. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Decent, but nothing special."
"I enjoyed Lake Placid UBU enough that I will probably give a couple of their other beers a try. UBU is pretty unique; it tastes fairly different than anything else I have had, which is something I don't come across very often. UBU is definitely worth a try."
"Dark roasted malts develop into a ruby highlighted brown ale hue with a light cream colored head with evenly spread lacng. Aroma has dark English malts very earthy and herbal tones going on. I had no idea what Ubu was but it's named for a Black Lab from Lake Pacid, NY cool. Nose also has some deep cocoa dark chcolate tones, with a flavor that adds some complex earthy bitterness to a dark roasted English Ale, touch of peated malts and somkiness but finishes dry with herbal/earthy hops. Mouthfeel is medium bodied slight alcohol caramel streaks across the palate smooth mild carbonation. Drinkability is decent nothing I'm reaching for soon, somebody visited England and wanted to make English ales in Lake Placid, listen up this is American we don't have to brew to style."
"I was unsure of the style, it surely did not taste like and American Strong Ale at all, it was more like an American Porter, which it did have decent flavor. It was a decent beer but not for the style."
"Clear brown with a coppery, reddish hue and a half inch of dense, yellowish beige foam. Great head retention, lacing consisted of thick sheets that really clung to the glass. Malty and fruity aroma, caramel and faint roast, chocolate, light citrus and dried fruits, a hint of smoke. Mild bitterness with a lot of fruity character up front, some citrus and plum, alcohol, malty caramel and bread towards the end. Slightly spicy finish. Medium bodied with ample creamy carbonation, nice texture. I liked it."
"D good, I would drink this beer again. My only reservation is the lack of assertiveness with the alcohol."
"D-other than the smell the alcohol doesn't really come out which makes this beer very easy to drink. I wish the taste was a bit more complex, but it is a decent beer."
"the taste was mild for a strong ale butt very mild for a beer this dark it had a very nice aftertaste almost nut like very pleasing and easy to drink"
"This is a very pleasant dark beer. If you are on the stout/porter side of life for the night, by all means, fill up. A very drinkable dark ale."
"$7.99 a six in a 12 ounce brown bottle"
"Overall, somewhat flawed and unbalanced. A single was enough. Decent beer, but not great."
"This strong ale has a nice big body, light carbonation, is very smooth and easy to drink. A nice English-style offering from a very small American Brewery. Kudos to Lake Placid."
"M: Light/medium bodied, smooth all the way, finish with sweet malt aftertaste"
"A nice carbonation lends a hand to a lightness not expected from the appearance of this beer. The mouthfeel is the highlight of this strong British brown and if you're lucky enough to have a pint at the brew pub in Lake Placid (and I have...quite often) then you've had a better experience than what comes out of the bottle."
"D- this is a great brew. I have to say, I try not to buy it at home because I like to embrace at the brewery. It goes down easy and has the flavors to keep it tasty. I highly recommend the trying of this. It embodies the adirondacks as the ""flagship"" brew"
"12 oz. bottle: This one pours a fairly clear, reddish-mahogany color. There was a bit of a tan head on it that didn't linger long. The aroma is a bit light for a 7% beer. Faint notes of chocolate, earthy hops, some other malts. The taste is pretty good. There aren't any real standout flavors, just a decent mix to make a fairly tasty brew. Some smokiness and chocolate do peak out. A slightly sweet taste and a hair dry finish. I would have it again."
"D - Goes down nice. Not a bad overall first impression of Lake Placid. Not sure if I'll have the Ubu again - maybe on tap if I ever run into it, but I'm interested in trying their other brews."
"This is simply a nice smooth strong ale. The malt overwhelms the palate, but there's some nice complexity too. I taste some butterscotch undertones along with some toffee, chocolate, and plum. Has a nice bite on the aftertaste, but goes down very smoothly."
"Drinkability is better than the parts. In the end it just feels like a very enjoyable beer. I prefer this much more than their IPA."
"single from Ye Olde Spirit Shoppe, Frederick, MD"
"Poured into a shaker pint. Pours cloudy dark amber with red highlights with a nice creamy off-white head that hangs around a long time till it slowly goes into a thick film that has excellent lacing. I could not detect much aroma-wise except a slight woodiness. Taste is caramel sweet and citrus tart with a just strong enough hoppy bitter finish. Nice and crisp. Highly drinkable. This brew hides it's alcohol well so beware."
"Overall, this a good beer, I look forward to trying some other Lake Placid brews in the future."
"I would definitely recommend this one."
"Poured from 12 oz bottle with no freshness date into a Unibroue tulip. Pinky of light beige head slides away after a moment. Aroma is mainly of dark, sweet malts and mild hops, along with some dark fruits. Taste is slightly roasty, mildly sweet and dark fruity. Very nice mouthfeel and very easy to drink considering the ABV. Very pleasing overall."
"Cold winter afternoon...perfect time for a stronger ale. This one pours a rich reddish-brown color. It's dark and deep in hue, with a nice tan head. The aroma is great...lots of malt, mixed with a little alcohol, resiny wood scents, and a slight toffee smell. Nice. The taste is a lot drier than expected. It's a good taste, but the malt flavor didn't continue retain the prominence that began in the smell. Good balance. Nice hop bitterness in the finish. There's a firmness and full mouthfeel. Quite a good beer, all in all."
"It's very smokey, with a burnt taste. Black porter style. Carbonated and crisp. Taste more like a stout or porter than what I think of when the term Ale is used, but outstanding no matter what the title."
"Overall this is a very interesting and strong brew and I will be drinking plenty of it as I have just moved up to Saranac Lake (8 miles west of Lake Placid). Cheers!"
"A delicious, smooth, malt-accented brew!"
"Growing up in NY, Ubu was one of the first real microbrews I got into. I still seek it out when I'm home, a great winter beer."
"Notes: I had this and LP 46'er back to back and found this one much more enjoyable. While still lacking slightly in smell, it is a very enjoyable beer. A nice slightly darker ale, but good drinkability."
"M/D - Medium to full bodied. Moderate carbonation and very easy drinking."
"Drinkablity: You can get a 6-pick for around 8 dollars, which is a great deal, and you may be able to find it cheaper. Almost drinks like a barleywine, which means you can make this last a while. Recommended."
"Brings me home literally. Sit around a open pit fire on a cold night and enjoy the a smooth chocolate ale - not quite a chocolate stout - taste the hops, but not overpowering. Not sure it matches an English style ale but a taste of its own. Will present on special occasions to family and friends."
"This was a great extra and I was surprised by how easy this drank. Thanks Jeff!"
"This beer is the beer that got me into dark beers, and to this day is my favorite. I brew my own, have been to...way too many micro breweries, and this one is still the staple. Even though I find myself to be an IPA man for the most part, I love this beer the most...damn all you who disagree."
"This dark reddish brown ale pours with a nice white head. Toasted biscuit flavors dominate the flavor profile, with lighter caramel, slight chocolate and heady alcohol playing a supporting role. The nose is tingled with bready malt and subtle, balanced English hops. Aggressive malt sweetness is balanced with hop bitterness that commands attention, but still allows the malts to play the leading role. Flavors are strong and backed by a sufficiently heavy mouthfeel which makes this a great beer for contemplating the passage of time."
"Overall pretty interesting I have to admit, again nothing crazy here, but I was not really looking for Crazy. I could do this one again for sure."
"D) A delicious brew. I'd definitely recommend this beer and, of course I'd have another too."
"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle marked 2099-1253. Sampled on October 4, 2009. The pour is mainly brown with a frothy, long-lasting beige head. But when held to the light a ruby red hue glistens in the pin glass. The aroma is a bit weak but the aroma that is there is sweet and nutty. The mouthfeel is bold and heavy. The taste comes on strong with the tangy note of bitterness evident in English Bitters. There is also a hint of caramel and something nutty about it that reminds me more of a brown ale. A happy hop ending helps it go down with a smile. A fine session ale and one that deserves the many awards and accolades it has received over the years."
"D - the alcohol is well hidden which makes this a nice smooth beer to be drinking."
"Drinkability: An above average strong ale, but really not interesting enough to merit trying again. Not a bad beer, but nothing jumps out. It almost drinks like an imperial English brown--if there is such a thing. One is enough."
"D - Just ok for me. Alcohol is a little on the high side, metallic aspect is rather distracting for me. Think this is a one and done, not bad but I'd much rather go with something else for my next beer."
"The beer had a typical mouthfeel and was drinkable. If you like hoppy ale you would likely find this very drinkable."
"Notes: I would like to thank my good friend Don for telling me about the Lake Placid Pub and Brewery and for recommending the Ubu Ale. I really enjoyed very interesting and complex ale."
"Lingering bitter finish made me want another immediately. I suspect it would be easy to drink too many of these. An unexpectedly delightful find!"
"D: Makes me wonder if I have a bad bottle. Probably will try one more to make sure. I'll update this review appropriately."
"Pours a dark brown, with a fizzy, cola-like head that lasts a good, long time. The nose is dominated by dark roasted malts, but bits of dark chocolate and coffee, and a touch of ripe fruit sneak through. The flavor begins with a sweet, fruity character which slowly evolves into a rich, bitter finish. The aftertaste is mainly of bitter hops and lasts for a very satisfying length of time. It's a tad fizzy for my taste, but I'd gladly have another. The ABV wasn't noted on the bottle, and I'm surprised to learn here that it's 7%. Dangerous if not known ahead of time!"
"Palate: Full bodied, which is expected for the style. Tastes of dark brown toasted malt, with very subdued hop bitterness to balance it a little. Some caramel, but less than the nose indicates. Bitter aftertaste. Carbonation is low, sits well in the mouth. Drinkable, hides the alcohol very well. Just a touch too much malt in the balance to make this a real quality strong ale. Really enjoyed it though."
"Pours a dark red, almost black color... nice head to it which stays consistent all the way down to the end, good amount of lacing as well. First impression of this one is that it's very smooth and well balanced, Definitely hides its 7% ABV well and is very drinkable. Style is a bit of a misnomer, as this beer is aiming to be a British style and tastes like it, but I guess there isn't a British Strong Ale category. Taste wise you get some dark fruit kind of tastes in there (maybe some fig/raisin) but other than that tastes like a British pale ale to me. Nothing too extreme here but is a nice smooth brew with some subtle taste.. not too bad."
"Then we get to the taste and we have a too watery, too bland, roasted, slightly charred, overly musty, slightly biting beer that doesn't go anywhere. The finish is musty as well, a bit too lingering with the charred brown sugar flavors. The beer has a burnt toffee flavor, some overwrought roasted cherry notes. The taste isn't too good."
"Saw this on the shelf at Perfect Pour and, after reading the description on the bottle, opted to pick up the 6'er and carry it out. Pleasantly surprised. Nice dark brown color, almost cola-like. Initial hint of dark roasted malt in the nose, with a rich malt flavor, a decent hop bitterness and an almost smoky stout-like aftertaste. Nicely balanced and genuinely good tasting. Well worth trying."
"Carbonation is small & sturdy. Feel is dirty, but smooth alcohol & a decent balance make it work. :)"
"Very dark, but clear ruby with a thick, creamy, sticky head of foam. Nose is caramel, coffee, and light floral notes. Lots of dark sugars, some burnt grain and cocoa backed up by a hefty dose of bitter hops. There's some fruitiness that mingles with the roasty flavours and a bit of acidity, but this beer is mostly about the roastiness. Moderate body is has a good carbonation level, and is fairly drinkable although the hopping is a bit one dimensional."
"Sit, Ubu, sit..."
"Overall it's a pretty interesting and tasty beer, though I think the alcohol content is a touch harsh and overdone."
"D: Malty at the start, and boozy at times may limit and hinder consumption and multiples. Not a bad beer overall, just not session material and perhaps a bit unbalanced. Warming, boozy, and malty and perhaps more suited as a winter warmer."
"Not a bad beer, but far from good. I'd never buy it again. I'm ashamed of spending $10 on a 6 pack for it."
"The beer poured into the glass to reveal a very dark amber almost brown color. The aroma was sweet and mildly of roasted malt. The mouthfeel was about medium. The taste was mild-medium in terms of sweetness with a slight roastiness. This is a nice ale, but a bit too sweet for my taste."
"notes and comments- rich maltiness with a good hop balance. interesting interpretation of an english ale. this beer was brewed in tribute to a choclate lab named ""ubu"" from the mountain village of lake placid."
"Good beer, very drinkable."
"What does Ubu mean anyways?"
"D- Nothing special here. I don't think I'd run out and buy bunch of these put then again probably wouldn't turn 'em away."
"Like the Ubu itself, this brew is dark, mysterious and a mutt, of sorts. Doesn't really fit any particular style, but it is a pretty good beer nonetheless."
"Overall- A bit subdoed but the flavors are there and its easy to drink. Another good offering from Lake Placid!"
"Good drinkability - I can hit these all day, in all weather."
"Drinkability is moderate. The flavors run from common to unusual, and they make this an interesting beer to drink. With more carbonation I might find this a bit more to my liking, but, again, interesting brew."
"Drinkability? No probs drinking this bottle as the flavours keep pouring it on with every sip making it a real joy to drink. My first sample from Lake Placid and colour me impressed! Oh and great head retention and super good lacing!"
"Pours a dark ruby brown color with a moderate head that left some lacing on the side of the glass. Not much on the aroma; very very light toasted malt aroma and very very light hop. The taste has a sour metallic twang, lemon rind, not much of a malt presence despite the appearance. A touch nutty/woody, not much hop flavor or bitterness. The feel is light to moderate with fizzy carbonation, definitely has a sour twang thing going on. Not sure of the strong ale label, though I know it is a bit of a catch all category. Needs more body and hop presence. Not all that impressed."
"Poured a dark brown, smelled a bit sweet with hops, tasted a little sweet as well, with a touch of hops but not too much of any flavor. Ive had it in a bottle before and thought it was very good but it is better on tap"
"Pours a semi-cloudy mahogany with a light brown finger and a half finger head that takes a good five minutes to die down to a frothy layer of foam that lasts throughout. A good dose of chunky lacing is left clinging to the sides of the glass. Smell is earthy, malty, and nutty. Brown sugars and toasted chocolate malts as well. Unfortunately the nose overall is pretty weak, you really need to dig down into the glass to get a good whiff. Taste starts off with some caramel malts and roasted grains. Midway an unfortunate minor metallic flavor emerges with some dirty hops as well. Aftertaste consists of cocoa powder, rye bread, and molasses. I definitely recall the flavors being more rich and chocolatey on tap, shucks. Medium body with a surprisingly soft feel in the mouth, carbonation is a tad high though. The 7% abv is hidden pretty well, but the bottled version is nowhere near the deliciousness of Ubu on tap."
"It's a nice dark brown/amber with a slight tinge of snow-white head. The smell is a bit woody, and the taste has a hint of chocolate and hazlenut. It may be a bit on the thin side, but that contributes to its drinkability - despite a relatively high ABV, it's easy to drink a few."
"Off their taps at the brewpub this English Strong Ale (45 IBU, 37 SRM, 7% ABV) was a deep copper color. The one-finger of sandpaper-colored head displayed good retention and consistent lacing. The aroma was of toasted and roasted malt, nuts and a touch of sweetness. The flavors were rich, dry and alcoholic. I tasted toffee first before it went dry with toasted nuts, toasted malt and a nice bitterness at the end. The toasted malt notes were so dry it reminded me of a baked pretzel! These notes also nicely balanced the brown sugar and caramel malt flavors that became more apparent as it warmed. The mouthfeel was a little oily and tongue coating, the body medium to full and the carbonation average."
"I lucked out by ordering this off a relatively limted micro menu. Glad I did, Ubu is great!"
"d- It's pretty damn good as far as drinkability if i lived in upstate i'd possibly throw this on the ""6 pack a week"" list"
"(rated Feb 6, 2007)"
"A BOTMC that has been aging for a few months so lets see what we got....smells like some fuggles and tarty hops with some roasted malts and a hint of brown sugar or dark candies. Like a hopped up dubbel. Pours like a syrup into my trusty tulip, head is medium bubble. Color is deep translucent brown. Mouthfeel is smooth and heavy. Taste is very complex. Starts sweet with cocoa and tart bitterness, then gets sweeter like brown sugar and zestier hops with the carbonation released on the finish. The carbonation seems a little too high and detracts from the mouthfeel and masks the finish a bit. Otherwise this a very good HG brew with nice complex flavors."
"D: I love supporting Ny beers I just cannot recommend this one. If it's the only thing in the fridge go ahead. Otherwise try something else."
"D - Not much alcohol taste which makes this a nice smooth beer to be drinking"
"This English strong ale was named after a 'legendary' chocolate lab. While it falls short of the lofty standard known as legendary, it is damn good beer that I'd love to drink again. Man's best friend? Ubu. Man's second best friend? Ubu Ale."
"One of my favorite ale's. Ubu is a dark ale that has a rich really nice finish. Great out of a tap or in a bottle. The brewery is in my town so this beer is easy to find and on tap at most bars. It's a good beer to start the night off with, sitting there with friends enjoying an Ubu. there is even a nice story behind the beer, about a dog and such, I'm not going to spoit it for you read it yourself. Highly recomend, if you are in New York, look it up."
"Mahogany body with a small creamy head. Aroma of cocoa and nuts. A fair bit of caramel joings the chocolate and nut in the flavour, and the sweetness is cut somewhat successfully by a decent hop finish. The alcohol is well concealed, so this is more drinkable than I would expect for a strong ale. Medium body and carbonation."
"Deep amber colored, pouring a moderate tan head that seemed to fizzle down rather quickly. Aroma is slightly sweet and malty. Flavor is a mix of malts with some chocolate in there with mild hops in the background. Slightly bitter aftertaste. I guess this is their flagship beer but I liked their 49er IPA (or Pale Ale) a little bit more."
"This was a gem to find because I didn't actually trust the brewery at a glance but I came away satisfied. Nice dark color that reminds me of a dark brown ale. Great aroma of roasted nuts and chocolate malt; MMMmmmm. Aroma gives away the taste rather than disguises it. The palate is filled with chocolate malt, roasted nuts, and a hint of coffee. The 7% ABV is hid fairly well leaving a content drinker behind."
"Not quite what I was expecting but, overall, quite a decent product. Not what I'd look for in a session beer although it seems to be their flagship. On balance, I'd opt for the IPA as the best offering I've tasted from this brewer."
"D = This is a pretty simple straightforward beer. It has okay drinkability but I wouldn't rush out to try it. Certainly willing to drink it again though."
"Very drinkable. I have one more bottle and it will be saved for a COLD winter evening in front of a fire."
"D - I like it. When I had this for the first time it was with a cigar. This really masked most of the subtly and I wasn't very impressed. Now, enjoying it with just some popcorn, it's quite pleasant and enjoyable."
"Pours a reddish brown with a fairly slight head. Smells malty and fruity with cherries and grapes. Very fruit-cake like. Delicious beer, if rather simple. Slightly sweet with flavors of mixed glaceed fruit, and caramel as well as some citrusy hops in the mix. Smooth and creamy, and at 7%, this a strong ale you can put away without too much worry."
"D: That aftertaste became somewhat medicine like as the beer warmed, all but ruining what started out pretty well."
"Beer pours brown with ruby highlights with a tan smallish head. Nose is of sweet malts and cereal. Taste is of dark sweet malts, with hints of chocolate and a bit of citrusy hops to finish. Mouthfeel is pretty good, medium bodied and it glides across the palate fairly well. Drinkability is good as the abv is well hidden. This is definitely a unique beer. It is enjoyable and worth a try."
"It pours a deep reddish-brown coller with a nice medium head that leaves a nice lacing. I'm not picking up much on the smell. It has a nice malty taste with a hoppy bitterness on the finish. Not a bad beer but not one that I'd go out of my way for."
"Drinkability: This is pretty tasty for a strong ale. I would definitely recommend, especially out of the snifter."
"MF&D - Medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation. Not bad, but I don;t think I'd go out of my way for another."
"Sampled on 3/28/08."
"This beer pours a deep reddish brown color with a medium sized and medium bodied white head that laces the glass very nicely all the way down. It has a very sweet malt aroma underneath a bit of dark fruit aroma. The taste is pretty good. It has a nice deep but sweet roasted malt base that is the basis for the slight hints of caramel, dark fruits, and a slight hoppy bitter taste at the end. It blends very well together and is a bit darker than most strong ales on the market which makes it a little easier to drink. It has a very smooth, fairly thick, and warming mouthfeel. The drinkability is pretty good for a strong ale as I didn't really detect the alcohol and I could have more than one of these in a sitting."
"The flavor really saved this beer in my eyes. Rich, dark fruits (grape & plum), fig, resinous hops, caramel, and a light citrus note all combined to bring an amazing complexity to this beer's flavor profile. The bottle classified this beer as an ""English Ale", but Ubu had an unmistakable hop flavor that left me quite satisfied. The body was well carbonated, medium in thickness, and packed an excellent, bitter hop finish that lingered just long enough. Overall, this was a very good, drinkable brew that I will definately look for in the future."
"This is easy to drink and flawless. Good as a darker, but mild, alternative."
"Not really my kind of beer, but I can appreciate the characteristics it illustrates as a dark brown ale."
"The beer was light to medium bodied with good carbonation. A good nutty, malty, smokey combo definitely worth trying if you get the chance."
"Bottle. Poured a cloudy dark amber color with a thick beige head. Plenty of lacing. Aroma is very nutty with a hint of fruit. Mouthfeel is a little too fizzy for what I like my strong ales to be. Flavor is ok. Mainly roasted malts, and more bitter than I'd expected. This was decent, but nothing I'd go out of my way to get."
"Very good even if not exactly to style."
"Overall? Good winter beer.... good with a bowl of soup."
"After the head quickly dissolves into the beer, you notice a dark brown color. The smell isnt all that impressive, some may say ""skunky"". It basically smells like any other strong ale. The taste however stands all on its own. Surprisingly smooth for a beer that is 7% ABV and great flavour. Great for a cool evening or after a great outdoor experience. Afterall, it was brewed among the high peaks in the Adirondacks."
"I'm afraid the 7% on this can come at you quickly without you having any idea that it was sitting in your lap the whole time."
"Got this in my first BIF and first beer I've tried from there. Pours very dark at top, lighter on the bottom, just a little lacing. Old ale smell complements the caramel and molasses. Not too strong but easy to drink for the style. Notes of chocolate and nuts, desirable in all areas."
"Ruby root beer colored brew with a tannish head that settles to a fuzzy cover with pretty good lacing. Smells kind of astringent to me, like rubbing alcohol but there is a fair malt presence along with cereal/wheat. The taste is again kind of peppery and tangy with a very fine carbonation and a brown sugar background. There is some charcoal at the finish, as well. An unusual mix of sour and carmel qualities. Pretty easy drinking and on the refreshing side for such a dark ale. There's a little more wheat flavor noted near the end of the 12 ounces, a dry ending. I was torn between liking it a lot and dismissing it as slightly off on my taste buds. But I think it's pretty good and I look forward to finishing this six-pack to solidify my opinion!"
"As is the case with many great beer drinking experiences, this one came with a story. I read all sorts of wonderful things about Lake Placid Brewing while on my very recent vacation in Montreal visiting friends. I decided to stop at the new Plattsburgh, NY facility to pick up a growler or 2 as provisions for camping out that night in the Adirondacks. Obviously, as any experienced camper knows, you want the largest container for your beer as possible (less waste). Unfortunately, they had no more growlers stocked at the brewery. All they had was 6'ers. So I was forced to drink the UBU strait from the 12 ounce bottle. Still, I was not disappointed. The drinkability was outstanding with idea balance between malt and prominent, yet very yummy hops. I think the reason that this beer does not have a higher BA rating is because, stylistically, it does not fit in to the typical categories. What is an American Strong Ale any way? If you are in the area, all you hophead campers out there MUST pick this up. This beer should be considered the official elixir of the Adirondack experience. Cheers!"
"Very drinkable, and tasty to boot. Enjoying it in the beauty of the Adirondacks only added to the experience."
"Chestnut brown in color. Sizeable head that receedes quickly. Malty, slightly phenolic aroma. Decent malty flavor upfront. Some bitterness. Has a touch of ""sourness"" to it-not bad but it is definately there. Nice sort of dryness in the finish. Good body overall. Definately drinkable brew. A few might be too many in one sitting. I would like to try it on draft for a comparison."
"It is kind of thick but not to thick. With a bit of after taste it definitely lets you know that it is there but its slight fruity flavor is very pleasant and so is the aroma."
"The feel is thick and malty but not too chewy. The aftertaste lingers a bit, but is pleasant. It's slightly syrupy but doesn't build up on the tongue. The rough edges smooth out as it warms up. The heavy malt is hard to repeat over several glasses in a row. It has the thick, strong ale feel to it. It's a heavy, sleep-inducing beverage."
"Aroma has some dark malts and sweet candied fruit notes. Body is a dark ruddy brown and holds a firm and lasting pinky sized tan head. Tart fruit notes in the fore...apple, cherry..which meld into sweet dark malt flavors. Almost approaches sour at times, but in a good way....a little bit like New Glarus Cherry Stout though much less concentrated and without the overy cherry flavors. The finish is a mix of the previous flavors but imparts a more defined tartness that defines the flavor of the whole beer. Very nice suprise."
"At room temp, the carbonation is close to non-existant. Medium-bodied with some drying features toward the swallow. Decent."
"D: Sort of like Newcastle, in that it's a dark beer that drinks like a lighter beer. You absolutely cannot tell that this is 7% abv."
"1/2"" beige head over the deeply brown brew. Plentiful lacing. Aroma was lightly of tart but sweet palt malts. Taste was well-balanced, with a clean close, with nary a slight of all that abv. Mouthfeel and drinkability were both great. This is a brew for all seasons."
"D: English strong ale? Hardly. Doesn't have that limestone twang. This is a strong brown ale."
"Poured a very dark copper color with modest slightly off-white head. Smell is mainly of roasted malt with no hop presence notade. Taste is totally malty, and very pleasant, with nice dark fruit dominating. Large creamy mouthfeel with a strong malt ending. Very drinkable with no alcohol taste to be found."
"This beer is rather well balanced for such a malty beer. The flavor and aroma really come out as the beer warms."
"Well, sometimes you don't expect too much, but just enough, and that's what you get. That's the case here. There's nothing memorable or fascinating, but it's very enjoyable as you're drinking it. The ABV is big enough to be felt, but it's presence in the flavor is merely fleeting, so that works toward having more than one. While it would never be the first beer to spring to mind when making recommendations, its nonetheless a fun beer that has reason to be the pride of a brewery."
"Pours a dark brown that held up to the light is actually a deep burgundy. What head there is disappears quickly. Smell is sweet and malty, with a hint of nuttiness and maybe a bit of chocolate. A burst of hops hits you on first sip, but semi-sweet malty flavors take over from there. Fairly heavy and a bit buttery, it's actually quite balanced and smooth. Very tasty, in fact, and easy to drink."
"Nice dark brown with a short head and some lacing. Aroma is a mixture of pale and chocolate malts. Taste is mellow with subtle dark fruit flavors and chocolate. Doesnt feel like a 7% beer, very drinkable. I dont know where the 'strong ale' distinction comes from. I've always considered this to be a pretty nice brown ale thats a little on the strong side. A pretty good beer, easy to find at the bars I frequent in Syracuse."
"Santé"
"This was a nice example of the style. It's easy drinking and has some nice flavour to it."
"I like this beer a lot, and can easily put back a few in a night."
"Very drinkable in my opinion, not too heavy or too light. Its great in the winter and would be a nice switch from the usual light summer ales, although I probably couldn't drink more than 1 in the warm weather."
"12 ouncer sampled, pours dark amber with a moderate tan head, nose is a nice malty sniff, this is a malty brew, notes of caramel, smoky light toffee notes. Pleasantly balanced and packing a well hidden 7%. Took me awhile to get around to this Ubiquitous brew, but I'm really impressed, tasty stuff. Warming malty finish, long lasting, smooth and satisfying, Nice strong ale. Fine winter quafer."
"Decent brew, some hops and yeast in aroma. Some bitterness and roastiness and nuttiness. So complexity and higher alcohol is assimilated. Amber colour. Medium mouthfeel. Will try again in bottle.Not for everyone because of bitterness on tongue, but I could have a few pints.."
"Drinkablity is good; the 7% is not detectable. This could lead to problems."
"Maybe a little on the heavy side to drink all the time, but serving cold makes it more drinkable by controlling the flavor. Well-rounded... yum."
"Pours out a fairly dark brown with a small tan head. Aroma is nothing all that interesting...taste is more like a robust English brown ale of sorts more than an American strong ale (even says its english style on the bottle). Taste is mostly malty with a slightly burnt finish, almost a porter-like finish. Though its malty, its not sweet. Not heavy on the palate, easy to drink a few (which I've done before). Like I said, this screams English brown ale to me. And while nothing is all that special about it, I do really dig it."
"Bottle: Poured a medium black color ale with a nice foamy off-white head with standard retention. Aroma of roasted malt is kind of weak and I could not find anything else really. Taste is also a bit thin with some roasted malt and not much else going on. As mentioned, body is thin and carbonation is low Ive had much better beer form that style to truly care about that one."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Rolling in the mouth, and very drinkable. At 7%, you'll want to be careful this one doesn't sneak up too fast on you. Good job Lake Placid, I look forward to trying your other brews."
"Thanks dmeadows for the trade!"
"Slightly opaque dark amber body with a moderate white head. A little of the head stuck around for a good while. Strong malty nose, a little bit of hops and the alcohol comes through some. Ok, but not a memerable aroma. Alcohol really pops through at the begining of the sip, and there's a strong hop bite at the end. It's quite malty too. Great mouthfeel, very smooth, perfect CO2. A good solid beer. Certainly worth a try, especially if you find it on tap."
"Unsure of the age at tasting but I know that this was not relly fresh but that can be a benefit in this style. Pours a deep red almost brown color. Has a smallish head and very light carbonation. Nose is nice and big with chocolate, similiar to a brown ale. Hops come out in the flavor and the malt takes a backseat to them. But not way out of balance. Finish is big with hoppy dryness."
"A bottle I have saved since March 2003. This beer is nothing spectacular to look at but the taste is still wonderful and it goes down easy considering the 7% alcohol. Taste is roasted malts with hint of chocolate that finishes nice and dry. This was never an over the top hoppy ale but the finish is dry and given the situation another one would be in order. Wish I had saved another one. Oh well, time to get some more."
"Murky looking russet brown. Thin dirty white head. Lacing is moderate. Nice little caramel and toffee based maltiness on the nose with a splash of cascades coming through nicely. The caramel malts form a decent base. English style toffee enters the picture. Hops are not overdone and add a nice grapefruit tone to it all. Nice drying effect after the swallow. This beer is quite dry. Cedar dry. Good though. Body hovers around medium. Mouthfeel is a little chalky, but nice. Definitely an enjoyable brew from the land of miracles."
"Hmm this is nice. It pours a dark brown/reddish color with an inch tall fizzly head. Smells sorta fruity. Not sure really how to describe this. I tasted some caramel flavor but besdies that I dunno. But it is good whatever it is. It is fairly drinkable too. I would never had guessed it was a 7% abv."
"Sampled on 1/12/05 from a 12 oz bottle courtesy of slander. Appears a very dark reddish brown with and inch high tan foamy head. The lacing was pretty good as was the head retention. Aroma is a bit fruity and malts sweet. Notes bitter earthy hops are lurking in the background. Caramel malt and a slight bitter earth tone hops. A bit mild overall in the flavor and aroma but pleasant. There are notes of fruit and a bit of smoke in the taste as well. Mouthfeel was about medium, a bit lighter than expected. Pretty good drinkability overall. An interesting example of the style that seems like its just a bit to mild for its own good."
"Pours a deep, dark, nearly opaque brown with a nice off white head the soon fizzled out. Aroma of toasted malts mingling with fruits like cherry and melon. The taste of this seems to build up to a great finale. At first it's just a mild toasted malty taste with just a hint of sweetness. At the back of the tongue the chocolate maltiness and pleasant but not-too-sweet fruits break loose for a nice fuller finish. This is another one of those beers that I find scores higher in drinkability than taste. It's not something I would buy a case of but I could easily put down a few more and enjoy it."
"On-Tap at Porters in Easton. Dark ruddy red with a small off-white head of foam. Aromas are juicy fruit gum, citrusy hops, and big bolshy malts. The taste is big up front with the fresh hops, juicy malts, and big fruit flavors all competing for your attention. Mouthfeel is medium bodied>thick and the drinkability is good as well. A good. solid. simple. beer."
"Pours with a five+ finger light tan head that fades slowly leaving a good lace. Cloudy amber color. Light carbonation. Nose is faintly malty. Medium bodied. Starts and finishes with a balance of malt and hops, the high ABV is not noticable. $1.85 for a 12oz bottle from Hoosick Street Discount Bev. Troy, NY."
"Brew pours to a deep brown mahogany color with a nice thick dark tan head that has great retention and leaves nice lacing through out. The aromas of this brew are very nice, Malt characteristics, buttery and a fruit ester. Seem to wrap together into a pleasant smelling brew. The taste of sweeter malt along with a roasted flavor is the first thing that I notice, almost a dark fruit flavor? Then you get a taste of a nice hop hit, being English hops in this brew I would imagine that it is Fuggle. Over all I think this is a very nice brew and am a little partial to it being from the Albany area with many trips to the North Country. Over all it is a solid brew, one that I have enjoyed and will continue to look for."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Ubu ale is an amber coloured ale that starts with toffee and crystal malt grainy notes, and finishes with a dry but floral hop flavour. I was surprised that it did not feature an alcohol taste, given its strength. A nice beer to finish the night, if you do not like stout or porter."
"On tap at the pub in Lake Placid. Orangeish with an ok head. Has an earthy, malty smell, with a following whiff of hops. It is good stuff, with a smooth maltyness that starts creamy, and ends with a kiss of hops. A bit watery overall though, a very mild brew, not overly flavorfull. It is nice and smooth though, and the pleasant creamyness to it makes this a brew you can drink through the night, if the pub didn't have other fare to try before you skipped town."
"Cheers and Beers to McCall for allowing me to sample this one. Very Nice!"
"Very hoppy with little of the malt characteristic promised on label. Reminds me of an IPA that is dark. A definite letdown for me."
"A great beer, definitely an individual in the american craft brew scene. I'm not sure if it's a strong ale, more like a cross between a scotch ale and an english strong ale. The earthy, smoky (?) woodiness is interesting, and I enjoy it. I dunno if I'd want to drink this by the case, it gets a bit overbearing after a couple bottles, not to mention the punch it's packing. Possibly a future classic, and certainly worthy of some attention. Don't pass up a pint if you see it, just make sure you ain't driving."
"Mahogany with creme-colored head with R&L. Smell is or roasted grain and english hoppage. Definitely some plums and faint banana peel. Taste is big on the chocolate and hop flavor in the manner of a porter, but very one-dimensional as it does not develop or change throughout the sip and finish. Smooth, down, easy. An average, simple, porterish strong amber with light body and sweetess."
"Hazed ruddy chestnut hue. Lofty, persistant beige head leaves rough lace. Soft woody hops with earthy undertones upfront in aroma. Dark lovibond caramel with a roasted grain tinge is secondary. Trace prune esters. Tame, but clean aromawise. Burnt toffee sweetness incipient in flavor is ensued by bitter, unsweetened baker's chocolate notes and butterscotch hints. Hop bitterness is moderate, lending a parcing dryness especially considering the high attenuation and paltry residual sweetness. Subdued floral hop flavor. Burnt biscuit tones augment as it warms, further facilitating the dry overall impression. Lightly bodied, with a lightly dextrinous mouthfeel that could use a notch more girth. Understated raisin and bitter powdered cocoa hints. Finishes with lingering, sharp, thirst inducing hop bitters mellowed slightly by cookie dough hints. A unique strong ale, with a heavy emphasis on bitterness, both hop and dark grain derived. Not overly complex, but dangerously drinkable, indeed. Tasty! Thanks to Feloniousmonk for the delivery."
"Overall: This beer is a quaffers delight all the way. Very smooth and very drinkable. I've never really had a beer like this before. It's quite unique for supposedly being a strong English Ale. This makes for a great session beer, but might be too strong for some people to drink in quantity at 7% ABV."
"A real nice find while visiting the in-laws in Buffalo,pours a deep amber with nut much head to speak of a nice deeply fruity malty taste with an appetizing dry earthiness that lingers thru the finish.A somewhat chewy very appetizing night cap beer,now I know why I love this style of beer!"
"Poured a solid, light coco colored, head left a decent coat of lace. Mahogany colored beer lets just a bit of light escape. The aroma is solid, some chocolate, a bit of hoppy roasted malts. Chocolate malt flavor, balanced by mildy bitter hops, that fades to leave a coffe bitterness on the back of the tongue. Nice creamy feel on a beer with a good amount of body to it leads to an easy drinking, tasty beer."
"Are there style guidelines for ""brewed herbal tonics""? This could be the archetype. It's not bad, but very...unique."
"This very nice brown ale poured a pleasant dark brown (I guess you should expect that), with a nice beige head that lasted for the entire glass, providing good lacing all down the sides. Good bitterness in the mouth, that lingers after you swallow. Very good carbonation that tingles the tongue, but doesn't get in the way. No smell of note, but the malt is definately there in the flavor. This beer is very drinkable, being much lighter in texture than you would expect from the look."
"My sample is a bit overly carbonated and yet still rates a nice enough mouthfeel 'cause it is pretty rich - with a little less carbonation (maybe in anther batch) it could surely be great."
"Strong or old ale? My sample was more like a stout. Very nice dark brown color with a malty aroma. 7.0 abv? My sample didn't feel like it. Taste was initially sweet with a bit of roasted malt character and a touch of alcohol mid-palate. Finish had a slight roasted malt quality. Mouthfeel and drinkability were fine, but my question is....is this a strong ale...or a stout? I'm strictly rating it on my experience..I liked it and would definitely have another."
"Very strange beer indeed. Listed as a strong/old ale, but I didn't pick up on that exactly. Poured a dark brown/copper color with a slightly tan head. The smell was sweet and had a nice earthy texture to it with some peat and a decent hop presence. However, the taste was more like a brown ale gone wrong. I have some good high octane browns(Arrogant Bastard, Shed Mountain Ale), but this one was still stuck in 1st gear. There was a metallic resonance to the beer and there was little in the way of any interesting flavors going on with the alcohol. The malts were decently sweet, but they kept morphing back into a more confused state. The hop presence became non-existant until the finish, but I think it came on a little too bitter in the not so good way. More metallic than anything else. Meh."
"A bit more interestingly flavored. Grain driven sweetness that reminds far more of the calm before the hop storm of a pale ale. Very well balanced and thus extremely easy to drink; this goes down with remarkable ease. There's that hint of chocolate again, this time in the mid-palate. So perhaps I'm not imagining things. Imperceptible alcohol. Pretty simple but tasty."
"This has a presence that almost demands it be known. A rich dark colour and a thick tan head, one would think it's a porter at first glance. It had a malty smell and taste I senced a bit of pininess and graininess to it. It has a very well balanced taste that is among the best in the world. This is a beer that goes down smooth. Love this beer. It will treat you very well in return."
"Tastes quite strong and powerful. Big rush of toasted malt is quickly followed by a a very dry middle. This then proceeds to a hopped up ending. Lots of little notes of nut and molasses in the middle. It lives up to the category of strong ale."
"The flavor is very malty, with some slight bitterness detected while swallowing. Some very mellow and faint chocolate tones are also noticable. Medium body beer (slanting towards the heavier side) produces a good mouthfeel. Carbonation levels are good. The higher alcohol level is not very noticable, which makes this extremely drinkable. Overall a nice flavorful ale."
"The beer pours a hazy dark amber color with an overflowing white head that takes forever to fade. The aroma is dry and musty. It has a bit of maltiness to it. The taste is decent. It is mildly malty and smooth. It isn't very complex, but it does the job. The mouthfeel sucks. It is way too overcarbonated. It is medium bodied and not very enjoyable. It's one and done for me."
"This beer looked cloudy, dark brown, and quite fizzy when poured in a glass. The aroma was dominated by lightly roasted malts and bready yeast. I could also detect faint and distant hints of roasted coffee. The taste was dominated by smoky and chocolate malt, however a hoppy bitterness and spiciness continued to assert itself. I was not expecting it to be this hoppy based on the initial aroma. Very tasty beer with a strong alcohol content. I guess they did classify it properly. Thanks Weissenheimer for the trade."
"It poured with hues of deep, dark chestnut/chocolate (like its name sake Ubu the Chocolate Lab) topped with slight off-white head that quickly fades to a thin surface covering. Lacing was minumial. There is a faint malty nose with hints of chocolate/toffee and some floral hops. The body seemed a little thin, but it had a creamy, smooth texture. The taste profile was pleasant but not strong or overpowering. It is dominated by a caramel malt flavor with a noticable grainess and a mild underlying dark fruit-type flavor. It finishes dry, but with a weak hop flavor and bitterness. Generally well-balanced and drinkable brew."

"Thin bodied but far from flat, it tasted much more balanced than most old ales, as the strong hop presence kept it from being sweet water as are many old ales. Helped the drinkability, too. A warming winter ale, aging could do some interesting things to it."
"Drinkability: Not really a standout for the style... I'll keep looking."
"I do wish I could try one again, to further explore it's mysterious secrets, and give thanks to the good McCall for providing!"
"The sticker and marketing are great the beer is average!!!"
"It pours with a dark amber body and thick foamy tan head. Smells of both sweet malt and strong hops, and this carries through nicely to the taste. It's moderately hopped, but not dominated by it, there is a nice maltiness as well. Rather drinkable, especially if you're looking for a nice ale with a sweet taste."
"A tasty strong ale, it was a tad hard to get by the musty character but other than that it ended up to be not half bad."
"Hmm ... not too sure what to think? An English-style Strong Ale at 7% ABV, which you can't even detect, and no real malt character that would suggest such an alcohol content. A bit bland, very mild and uneventful, but regardless, it's quaffable at the moment."
"A hearty ale....nose is pretty soft(at first) but it's interesting....leathery, musty and spicy, and then later in near the end of the glass I detect some chocolate notes, and some salami or meat of some sort.......pours a deep dark brown.....excellent lacing along the glass...full bodied...flavor profile is really pretty balanced..a nice malt backbone...but then the english hops (fuggles mainly) jump into the fray and provide an excellent spicy balance..finishes dry and tight.....this is a quality beer that I grew more impressed with the more I drank....it's more complex than I thought it was at first...Well worth trying..at first I thought I would not end up rating this above a 4.0 but as I drank it I became more attached to it..."
"A ruby colored ale, hoppy nose, and malty mix make a nice balance. The hops are in the finish. A nice beer from a new brewery that has subtle flavors and a nice hop bite. Alcohol is not very noticeable and this is a highly drinkable beer if you enjoy hoppier styles."
"A great, weighty brown ale, but not nutty and mild like most browns. Rather, this is a big, brazen, malty beer with flavors of maple, caramel and beef jerky. Enough hops to give it a tasty bitterness as well as a minty herbal quality. Effortlessly drinkable considering the proof. The beer is dark amber with a good-sized, lasting head. Aroma is deceptively sweet. Mouthfeel is lustrous, unfiltered, and great. Overall a great beer, certainly as good as any other beer available, it's wonderful to see this in bottles."
"Theres caramel/toffee flavors here also. Medium to full bodied, with an underlying bitterness. Finishes pretty clean and dry. Very well made and drinkable for a strong ale."
"Pours a dark heavily hazed tea brown color with a modest light tan head that although was small, it kept a nice thin layer for quite a while. It has a nice malty aroma with hops in the mix as well. The taste is more complex but still as nice as the smell with a caramelly roastiness and a nice coffee-like bitterness and tapers into a warming alcohol flavor but not as noticeable as you would expect from one with this ABV. It is a medium bodied brew and finishes lightly bitters and sweet. This is a very nice brew that I would mind coming across again sometime! Thanks to McCall for the opportunity to taste this good brew! Cheers!"
"Acquired in the Philly BA Gathering Beer Exchange."
"The taste here is the prize...chocolate and medium sweet. Certainly not a session beer, but a brew to be served and savoured."
"This beer poured a very deep reddish brown, head was off white and it lasted all the way down the glass. Lacing was plentiful and decorative. Good malty nose with a spicy accent. Very smooth taste that leaned heavily towards the malt. There was a bit of a lingering finish which was very slightly sweet. A good nightcap brew that I enjoyed very much. Thanks to McCall for this fine ale."
"Overall, this is pretty darned drinkable for a strong ale. Be careful!"
"All in all, a good solid unique beer that I will buy again."
"The taste is well rounded with a good chocolate malty feel at the begining finished off by some hop kick. I personally found the aftertaste to have an unpleasant metalic quality that I couldn't shake. Alcohol is present but no pervasive. Overall a slightly above average brew."
"Cheers"
"A clear, deep chestnut body is topped by a frothy light tan head that holds with tenacity. It eventually drops to a creamy collar and thin surface covering but leaves some very nice Brussel's lace that actually looks like lace! Its malty nose displays a note of chocolate and some mild grassy and floral hops. The body is medium and it's quite creamy across the palate with a very fine, moderate carbonation. The flavor is much richer than the nose suggests with a tight combination of caramelish malt that fades away to reveal a light chocolate note after the swallow; a mild underlying fruitiness that suggests apples, dark berries and raisins; a well-infused hop flavor that's floral and gently grassy; and a firm, supportive bitterness that allows the gently sweet malt character to shine but not overwhelm. It finishes dry with some lingering hop flavor and bitterness. Exceptionally well-balanced with the malt, hops and fruitiness playing off of each other! A highly drinkable ale that offers enough complexity to keep it interesting through several pints!"
"And the best part - come November, it'll be coming out in bottles. Sweet!"
