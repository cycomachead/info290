"Not my style and kind of too sweet for my liking."

"This beer is pretty figgin' delicious."

"O- awesome beer from block 15. This one gets overlooked because of previous infections but should be seriously looked it. Even fresh, it drinks as it's been aged for years. Worth seeking out especially if you like winter beers"

"A little extra sweetness but awesome beer. On tap at beermongers, no infection noticed so I can't comment on how the bottles taste."

"Not sure if Block 15 should have released it, even if it was with the buy at your own risk. I prefer when breweries don't release infected beer or have a if it is infected we will refund your money clause."

"O - This was clearly an infected bottle, possibly at the bottling line. I've had this beer several times before and it tasted nothing like this. Disappointing would be an understatement."
""
"Pours a clear reddish-brown with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, brown sugar, dark fruit, spice, and brandy aromas. Taste is much the same with slightly sour malt, dark fruit, and brandy flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of woody and spice bitterness and an alcohol kick on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an above average beer that is fairly tasty but there seems to be some sort of infection going on with this one."

"O - It's getting colder outside so... Fruity and sweet brandy makes it sweet, a bit overly sweet, but great flavors."

"Drink- It was a nice idea to open this on Christmas. Shared with my brother in law. I thought it was okay. A bit let down that it didnt meld a little better but dropped off in the bottle. Maybe next release I can land a fresh bottle."
""
""
""
"I do have another bottle of this that I guess I'll save for a special occasion, but based on this tasting, I'd recommend drinking this beer NOW, so you at least get some of the spice quality from it."
"I didn't really know what to expect from this beer but suffice to say, its very aptly named. Fig presence is very apparent and it works well with the other flavors present here. A unique and delicious brew in every sense."
"This is a beer that rides the short bus - special. Never had anything like that, & in this case, that's a compliment. Wonderful use of figs, great barrel presence, unique, complex, tasty. What more could one ask? Excellent beer."

"O: Maybe the best vintage of this beer yet -- definitely better than last year -- and a pity that they weren't able to bottle any this time around."
"Overall I really enjoyed this holiday inspired American/English ale. The sum of the parts (spice additions, barrel aging, fruit additions) are all done in balance and work really well to develop the overall flavor profile. For such a big beer this drinks very smoothly, definitely a sipper but an enjoyable and not over-bearing one."
"O: As with other Block 15 beers, I'm at the point where I like them, but I'm not blown away. Worth trying, particularly as a sipper on a cold night, but it's not something I would go out of the way to acquire, unless the particular style is appealing."

"o 0 REALLY enjoyable. great meld of flavoring. almost like a barleywine. i really loved it."

"Overall - Not as dessert-y as I expected. Not as brandy-y as I expected. Not as interesting as I had hoped..."
""

"Overall: This beer is mild and smooth and easy drinking. The mouthfeel is the best part of this beer. It was not what I expected, I was thinking it was going to be a heavy sweet dessert beer with spiciness from the cinnamin and nutmeg. It was my first English Strong Ale that I have ever drank, so I will just call it expanding my palate."
"Very Belgian/quad like. I don't know, it was alright. Wouldnt care to try again actually. Thanks for the share Brian (4DAloveofSTOUT)."

"O: Drink great. Sweet and fruity but the brandy balances well. Fig is there but not overwhelming. I liked it. Thanks again bbb099."
"We're edging up on hyperbole here, but I freaking love this beer. The 5 I'm about to give it puts all the recent 4.5's I've rated to shame, and that includes Pliny the Younger. I wish I could afford to drown in it. Please, mommy, can I?"
"O - Incredibly sweet beer. Great taste for the high amount of abv."
"O: Good, but it caught me a bit off guard."
"Overall: Pretty good, unique and easy to drink given the strength and richness."
""
"Beer is medium in body and a little boozy, sweet and a thinning alcohol on the back end. The overall experience of the beer is nice, a little biscuit and a little malt sugar / syrup. A nice strong ale for sure, I'd have it again."
""
""
"Everything about this beer is above average but not great. There are a fair number of flavors working well together, but it drinks a little bit light and has a light body. If the flavor was a little stronger, with a fuller body, I would like it better."
""
"Pours deep amber in color with a finger of off-white head. A slightly sweet aroma with a fair bit of oxidation. There’s a nice bit of toffee and caramel, maybe some brown sugar. A little underwhelming. The flavor is good, but not great. There’s a mild vanilla and oak flavor with the same type of sweet, malty notes of the aroma: caramel and toffee. Maybe a hint of dark fruits. Medium body with smooth carbonation."
""
"Pours a medium brown color with a good off-white head and a thin collar. The nose brings some nice fruity notes plus a good dosing of spice. Moderate amount of barrel character in the background. The flavor has some stone and dark fruits plus a nice bit of spice and spirit. Medium-full body with a bit of booze. Interesting and fairly tasty."
"(D)- Overall, this is an entertaining and interesting beer; great for the winter season. It is mostly well integrated together, though I think it could use a bit more of a thicker mouthfeel."
"O. A okay beer, nothing mind blowing or impressive. I really wish you could taste the barrel or the brandy. There was no hint of being a BA beer. A simple, thin beer, just not what you would expect. Something I would try if it was sitting around, but not something I would ever go out of my way to trade for."
""
"Pours a murky dark amber-brown with a short tan head that fades to a frothy ring. Aroma was my favorite part of the beer; subtle blend of oak, cinnamon, apple, plum, nutmeg, molasses and all things Christmas. Flavor is much drier and less sweet than expected. Cinnamon is fairly strong though out and cuts the sweetness of the brandy barrel nicely. Plums, figs, apples and light cherry fruit flavors throughout and a dry, oaky finish. Medium thick body, smooth and creamy throughout. Not nearly as spicy or fruity (or more generally, novel) as imagined, but the balance and subtle alcohol presence this fresh is impressive."
"At this point, at $15, I'd give this a B-B+"
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest to high level of carbonation that gets very frothy inside the mouth. It contains a nice arrangement of flavor but wasn't exactly what I was expecting. It is certainly worth a try and overall is quite good for what it is."
""
""
"Overall: Really nice strong ale, but I can't help but feel a little disappointed about the weak brandy presence."
"i'm always nervous about spiced beers, but this is exceptionally well done."
"O - Perfect beer for the holiday season. Might need to stock up on this one. I'm afraid of what would happen once the alcohol and carbonation were to fade. This beer would become a sticky mess."
"O: A really nice treat for Xmas morning, gave to my wife as a present and she wanted to open it immediately. Fortunately for me, she shared the bottle and it didn't disappoint, great Christmas beer. Again, thanks Rob for making this happen."

"This is a very unique brew and serves well as a winter warmer on the right occasion. Not sure it lived up to the hype for me but very glad I got to try it."
""
"Overall this beer was a crowd favorite. Packed with flavor yet light. Absolutely wonderful."
""
""
"I've averaged my impressions for the two, and if reviewing the '10 alone would have given a higher score, but again, my expectation is that the '11 will evolve nicely and ultimately end up as the better brew. I hope. ;)"
""
""
"Overall: A very complex beer that I liked quite a bit in small quantities."
"Glad I had a chance to try this one. This is really a very nice Winter Warmer, and would probably not be something I would enjoy any other time except in the dead of Winter. Regardless, this is an impressive effort from the folks at Block 15."
"A challenging and tasty beer. Quite nice. 4"
"drinkability - such a complex feat of delicious brew, a sipper's beer"
"Lucky to try this elusive brew. Pours a ruby/dark brown, head stays around the edge with no lacing. Smell is vanilla, figs, tobacco, and booze. Taste is excellent. Figs, apricot, vanilla, maple syrup, and leather dominate, with some alcohol bite and mild bitterness to balance an enduring sweetness. The mouthfeel is where this shines, exceptional medium body and smoothness. Drinkability is good with the booziness and the abv preventing more consumption. I would love to have a bottle of this aged. The best Block 15 beer I've had."
"Nose was bready, well spiced, cloves, cinnamon, ginger, and light fruits. The initial flavors started out malty, very sweet, toasty and nutty, but really turned boozy and hot towards the finish. Definitely a brandy kick to it. One to two years would do wonders for this brew. Other notes of vanilla, apples, bitter-sweet molasses, and ripe fruits. The yeast played like champagne, creating a very dry finish and a bit of carbonation on the tongue."
"D: No doubt this is fine and interesting today. Sure, it's a bit boozy now - nothing that a few months more in a cellar can't resolve, however. Review and scoring will be revised as necessary when the day comes that I open a bottle. For now, just seek out a bottle (or a pour: only 64 cases produced and limited kegs) - you won't be disappointed."
"Pours a pretty amber color with orange highlights, without much of a head. Sweet aroma of pale malt, candi sugar, a whiff of molasses and brandy, and tons of sweet, ripe figs. Palate is sweet throughout - molasses sweetness and candied figs, with a hint of cinnamon. Body is rich and pretty creamy, with some very light carbonation to provide a little lift. Finish is sweet and warm from the considerable alcohol content. Very tasty and complex, although I'd like to see what a few months in the cellar could do for it."
