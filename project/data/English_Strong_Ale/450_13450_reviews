"This is quite a strong ale.  I can't get a grasp on the style?  I guess it is sort of a Belgian golden/pale ale.  Great looking pour with a nice two finger head and golden to copper body.  Scents of esters of apple and alcohol.  Maybe some pears?  Medium bodied with again, a Belgian golden mouth feel.  Pears, apples, and apricot. The drawback is a huge alcohol kick back that is quite noticeable but not unpleasant.  The deist, Thomas Jefferson, who supposedly crafted this beer in the 1700's, must have had quite a high tolerance to consider this one a ""tavern ale"".  Worth But still, worth a shot."

"Prost!"
"Superb drinkability and flavor. Goes down like a session beer and and hits like a velvet hammer. Just excellent and if an accurate recreation Jefferson was at the top of home brewing  field along with Washington."

"o: i think its cool if this really is based off a recipe that was made and drunk those years ago.  its nothing crazy, but has a nice sweetness to it, and a nice smooth mouthfeel that would make this a real nice fireside sipper"

"I really like this one, one of the best English Ales ,made in America"

"Tastes like yuengling, but a little better, without the dry mouth. Will drink again."
"Yards may have 'followed' Thomas Jefferson's original recipe but they obviously veered from the path at some point. For something that sounds different, even niche on the surface, Tavern Ale is actually quite conventional and entirely approachable for the average beer drinker. There's nothing at all ""revolutionary"" about it. It seems traditional recipes aren't quite the same thing when brewed with modern technologies and with modern palates in mind."

"A good ale that does not taste anywhere as strong (8%) as it is."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Holy moly. Does NOT taste like 8% ABV. Very nice."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear light red with little head. Nice clean caramel malt aroma with little hops. Caramel and a bit of toffee amid a bread crust note. Nice caramel flavor with medium low hop bitterness. Nice bready notes throughout. A nice brown ale."

"It arrives at the table with a tight, topographically variegated foamy cap surmounting a perfect amber body with a perpetual upward swirl of tiny bubbles. The enticing aroma is of toffee, or, perhaps, flan. The beer's flavor brings home the aroma's promise of savory, sophisticated sweetness. It's a soft and smooth taste--almost that of a ""comfort food""--yet deeply satisfying as beer. The texture is rich. For all of its 8%, it goes down easily. I'm a little reticent about giving a beer this high of a rating, but this is pretty good stuff."
""
""
""
"A pleasantly refreshing ale which neatly hides the 8% ABV. This seems like a lawnmower beer until it runs over you."

"A solid English Strong Ale. Not entirely forgettable. Worthy of a pick-up."

"Pleasing finger of eggshell white foam, adequate retention, the lacing sticks for a brief while, more breadth than length to the streaks. Bright zinc orange colored liquid, quite a few visible bubbles and they are super-fat, transparent and clean throughout. There’s a well-cooked bread crust stiffness to the nose, however, at the same time sweet grapefruit to orange citrus, honey and ripe apricot, peach notes, then more peppery, grainy bite, definitely has an earthy funk to it as well, a forest floor covered with pine needles and fallen leaves and branches. Full-bodied, sweet and sticky attack even though the carbonation does punch as hard as possible to get things stirred up. Actually turns appreciably drier through the mid-palate, earthy and herbal. The return of banana and bubblegum seems close to Belgian, loses most of the honey as well as the juiciness in the apricot, peach, apple fruit. The citrus in turn comes off as more sour. The textural fullness extends the finish when most of the primary flavors have begun to trail off. Due to its palate weight can’t say it is sessionable or the like. But it has this unique, just off-center character which ultimately keeps you sipping again and again."

"Overall, I really enjoy this presentation from Yard's. I liked the Tavern Porter, but this beats it hands down."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours out a deep gold with a shorter-lived creamy white head. Not much lacing left. The aroma is pretty minimalist, with some mild light fruit notes. The taste is a little bit more robust, with some nice balance from the rye and the honey. The body is a little thinner, but it fits with the almost delicate flavors, which doesn't really include alcohol despite the 8% ABV. The third president knew something about brewing."

"Overall: My second ancient beer of the evening; interesting but in both cases they lack the bitter balance I prefer; hope to return to the 21st century tomorrow"
""
""
""
""
"O: Decent beer. I would say this is my second favorite in the Ales of the Revolution series, with the Porter being the best and the spruce ale coming in last."

" The flavor has a brown malt toasted quality with spiced yeast element that enhances the moderately bitter hop profile and there is a gentle English yeast with mineral quality that comes in near the finish with a slight alcohol warming. Overall a pretty decent strong ale - you get the English influence and it is pretty drinkable for the strength."

"Overall- Enjoyable to drink. I was surprised since the smell was nothing special. The taste was much more memorable. Decent complexity. The fact this was based off of Thomas Jefferson's ale recipe adds intrigue here. A great ale indeed!"

"I've had this both on tap and in bottle.  The latter is more subdued and hop-forward, while the tap version has a sweetness on the front end which was pleasantly surprising.  Either way, this is a well-balanced ale which is imminently drinkable and (for better or worse) never belies its high octane nature."

"16 oz draft on tap at the Victory Athletic Association. Medium carbonation. Nice lacing. Great appearance in my glass. I could not pick up as much of a smell as I reach middle age and my senses dim. Gotta say I really enjoyed the taste. Enjoyable ale on a Saturday afternoon!"

"o: Time travel is interesting but ultimately not quite all that I had hoped it would be. But then I wonder how Jefferson would have reviewed Firestone Walker Double Jack. ""When in the course of human drinking affairs,..."""
"Overall: According to Yards, this beer was crafted from Thomas Jefferson’s original recipe, using wheat, honey, and rye. I found it to be a very damn good beer, one that will be on my rotation of usual beers, as will be the General Washington’s Tavern Porter. Another home run from Yards!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A hard beer to pinpoint, very unique overall. This beer is certainly strong though it does not taste overpowering and there is almost no residual sweetness which suggests it fermented out completely. This is one of a series of 3 traditional ales from Yards so it will be interesting to see how the other two compare."

"Pours clearish light copper with ring of foam. Mild malt nose. Hard to flesh out. Taste is a funky, stale malt. Odd bitter close that is a bit persistent. Classic mixture, somehow comes together. Odd, but it works."

""
"Overall, I am deeming this lovely lady world class. She gets the Cate Blanchett award for being a true beauty! There is absolutely nothing that I don't like about this beer and I feel that it fits Beer Advocates criteria to a T. Although they mention a solvent aroma as part of the class, and I don't get that, OR want that! 5 out of 5 on this baby Yards! I don't think that I have given a score like that yet!"
"O - Pretty boring flavors and a mediocre beer overall. I'd pass this one by."
""
"O - This is a great brew, you do not taste or feel the 8% at all, if this is actually derived from Jefferson's recipe, then beer drinkers back then would be proud to know that it has kept up with beers of this era. Good, drinkable, and full of flavor."
""
"Overall, a rather boring beer. Not something I'd drink more of."
"O - Always fun to have something from Yards. These guys have consistently made some good stuff. After having this and the Washington Porter, I need to get a bottle of Ben Franklin's spiced ale."

"From notes. 7/27/11. Pours a translucent medium brown-ish orange. Eggshell head. Aroma is caramel, cider, spice and a some booze. It’s not very good. Taste is a kinda one note sweetness with a bitter, boozy finish. Lots of malt shows up, but it lacks complexity. Just sweet caramel. Feel is too thin. It’s not terrible, but it could be drier or richer or more complex. There’s just something missing. On top of that, even though there aren't a ton of English Strong Ales around, I still consider it a strong style, and this beer just doesn't live up to other takes for me. That said, I do plan to give it another shot."

"Flavor profile starts off with malty sweetness, but it's held nicely in check by a mild hop bitterness. Overall, it's quite well balanced for an 8% beer. Caramel and toffee for the most part with some bright hops on the finish. Mouthfeel is straight down the middle of spectrum,and carbonation is neither lacking nor overly fizzy. I guess I'd liken this to an ""Imperial ESB."" This beer is more than the sum of its parts and achieves great flavor and balance for a strong ale."
""
""
"Overall: a beautiful, simple reminder of what an ale can be--strong but drinkable, aggressive but rewarding--worth the sampler purchase by itself..."
""
""
""
"O: I've had better English Strong Ales, but this isn't bad. It's really drinkable."
""
"O: This strong ale wasn't that difficult to drink because the alcohol is well hidden from the taste. I enjoyed the complex taste of this beer but it seemed that it could have used a stronger smell."
""
""
"O - Well rounded with a good depth of flavor. Seems like it hits the mark for style."
""
""
"Light amber in color with yellow hues and a slight haze. Poured with a short white foam that maintained a thick cap throughout that huge sheets of sticky lacings on the glass. Earthy malt and toffee aromas with a touch of floral hops. On the heavier side of medium bodied with a smooth oily feel up front and a tangy crisp finish. Sweet caramel malt, biscuit malt, and toffee flavors from start to finish with floral bitter hops from the middle to the end. Finishes crisp and dry with toffee and floral hops. Higher abv is well hidden. One of my favorites from the local Yards brewery."

"To be fair, this did live up to its style as this was quite strong but as I said before, the alcohol complemented everything else nicely. The balanced is here for those looking for a good example of this style to savor, this is a good beginning. The namesake on the bottle would be well pleased if he could give this a go!"
"I poured the beer from the bottle into a pint glass. I noted that after I opened the bottle, the beer foamed. The beer was slightly below room temperature by the way. The color is a good amber color, the head dissapated quickly. There wasn't much lace on the glass. I could smell something, but it was weak (and my sense of smell is weak). I could taste some citrus and spice, I was reminded of an orange spice bread I had once. I could pick up some caramel. The sweetness went away, the aftertaste was dry."
""
"Overall – Much easier to drink then I would have expected with a decent flavor profile. Not too shabby."
""
""

""
""

"D: Strong but with a nice bouquet. Powerful sense of history. Throw back a few of these, and you’re ready to go kick some British ass!"
""
""
""
"This is a complex and tasty brew that makes one dream of discussing taxation without representation while knocking down a pint or two."
""
"Yards just keeps on making great beers, these guys are truely masters. In most of their beers I can really taste the PALE ALE MALT, much like IPSWICH, GEARY's and the UK imports."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Really cant get past the sweetness on this one, its not a caramelized malt sweetness, its something else entirely, just doesn't taste right."
"Complex, approachable, great concept. All 4's."

""
""
"This is a throwback to the turn of the century ales that were brewed back in the day. One of my favorite beers partially cause I am homer."
"Bought at Food and Friends in Philadelphia, appropriately enough, in the 12 oz bottle. I still like the Spruce best but this is very drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
"D: This was a great historic ale, with a strong herbal blend that worked well in the scent and taste. The body was great and the alcohol was well hidden, so it was very easy to drink. Not my favorite type of beer, but it was a nice change of pace and very well crafted. Definitely worth a try."
""
""
""
""

"O: If Jefferson named this a Tavern Ale, I would say he had good beer sense in addition to other faculties. This is a mellow drinking ale with a high ABV. It is pretty smooth, offering malt, some hops, and a rich burnt flavor. One can feel a bit of alcohol in the throat (and in the belly), but it is not blended poorly. This is a great looking beer, and though it does not overpower with flavor, it has enough to allow the beer to be a sipper.It fits Tavern Ale well: a beer one can sit back and enjoy with some food."
""
""
"Jefferson knew how to make a good beer, as well as a good country."
"O: Of the 3 beers in the variety pack, this is likely my #2 choice behind Washington's porter. This is a well brewed beer. I just don't think I could drink it everyday as it has a little too much sweetness weighing it down. It's great trying to taste what the founding fathers drank at some point, but I'm glad that I can live and drink in the present time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I thought this one was only average, the booze was a little too assertive, even for the style, and drinkability was only fair. Definitely warming. Flavors also seemed a little muddled to me. Sweet but dry in the finish."
""
"It's a beautiful golden brown, with tiny specs of sediment within. Unfiltered is good in my book. Carbonated, with only a thin ring of a head, though. Aroma - fresh, soap and linen somehow, toasted malt; grainy/bready. Interesting dichotomy. Flavor is sharp on the tongue and somewhat heavy. Definitely very tangy/sour - although there is surely some hops in the finish, I'm not sure where that bite comes from exactly... the alcohol? Not a bad thing, but not a beer you can drink all night."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. has a copper color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, slightly sweet. Taste is a bit unusual, bready, hops, sour, some alcohol, seems like lots of flavors pulling in different directions. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a mediocre beer."
""
""
""
""
"This obviously quite young, because it does taste a little brash. Opening up with candied fruits , a little caramel and toffee, this is quite nice. Burnt sugar does lend a little bitterness, but I do detect some hoppy bitterness as well. Bready, this is mildly alcoholic on the back-end. Medium full in body with soft carbonation, this beer feels quite nice on the palate. The finish is especially nice, with a lingering toffee sweetness and burnt sugar bitterness. There's aspects to it that make me think whiskey. The flavor notes are well-integrated for the most part, and this beer is quite nicely done. Solid stuff, I'd drink it again."
"Overall – Interesting beer, worth trying, not one I’d seek out."
"For a subtle beer I happen to enjoy this one a lot. A touch of bright fruit balances the richness of the beer on the finish making the large body more approachable. Pretty damn good."
""
"D- this one is amazingly drinkable. I never would've guessed the alcohol was so high. It drinks somewhere between a refreshing European pils and a biscuity pale ale and is quite good."
"O: I like this more than the rating indicates, but it just doesn't stand out very much. This is definitely a nice winter beer though, it's warm and inviting."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: For 8% this is a super easy drinker and few can go down fast and smooth. I also enjoyed the $8 six pack."
"The mouthfeel is grassy, hoppy and thick. The bitterness lingers after swallowing but the bitterness is not too strong. It is really just right. I normally prefer 'malt forward' brews but Yards got the hop level in this one just right. This is great for any time of the year but I believe this brew would be best in summer and served at a barbecue or other outdoor party."
""
"O - You could probably warm this up and serve it like tea...it has herbal, spice, and sweet characteristics all throughout...I'd say it's a good representation of what they were drinking back then"
"O: Love the idea, and the beer is OK. I'd go B on this one. I think that some carbonation would help this out a bit."
""
""
""
"The beer when poured into a pint glass, has a golden color body with a thin but thick head that hangs around for a while. The smell has a slight hop smell to it with some malt coming through. The taste is fruity with some bitterness of the hops coming in right after wards. This beer has a nice mouth feel and over all is a good strong ale."
""
"Overtall this beer is enjoyable. There are many fine ales out there-- whether I'd choose Yards Tavern Ale over others is debatable. Maybe it's Thomas Jefferson's portrait that will jog my memory."
""

"Mouthfeel is very well-balanced for a beer with 8% ABV. Nice change from the bottle."

"Overall: Would have been so much better if it weren't for the irony taste at the end."

""
""
"NICE, WORTH TRYING!"
""
"O: An interesting beer. Good to have tried, but not one I'll return to unless the pickings are slim."

"Overall, at first this didn't seem real interesting but as it went along it got better. It does come off though as just a bit average for me."

"The aroma was rather weak for me. Typical English ale with a huge malt bill attached to it. Lotso of bready notes here coing through now with that deep musty like smell, like wet hey it would seem at times. The flavor followed it up almost perfectl with a solid offering of english malts, and a nice little bit of hop bitterness, albeit not much, but just enough to give it some depth. Lots of musky wet earthy flavors here as well coming through, with the finish being very nice and drawn out which suprised me"
""
""
"Overall a great beer!"
"D: After making my way through this Ales of the Revolutiony variety case...I guess historically recreated beers just aren't my thing."
"Pours from the 12 oz. bottle a bright copper color with a full, sticky 2 finger head that hangs around for a minute or 2 before settling into a medium collar. There is lively medium carbonation. Aroma is a mixture of caramel and breadiness. 1st sip brings a slightly sweet caramelized malt note with the breadiness coming in along it a hint of hops/alcohol bitternesss. The palate is of medium heft, with a slick, creamy texture with a soft amount of carbonation. The finish is rather bitter, but not in a bad way, owing to the hops & 8% abv. Overall, a tasty offering from Yards. Thomas Jefferson should take his rightful place next to Samul Adams among the pantheon of brewer/patriots!"
"Served on tap in a stem glass. Poured a dark amber color, hazy, with a short, study, white head that leaves little to no lacing. Aroma of sweet malts and dark sugars, fruit esters, and a bit of herbal hops. Taste is bready, with notes of caramel, molasses, maple, with a bit of fruitness, and a mild, drying hoppiness. Thick and a bit syrupy, heavier-than-medium mouthfeel, bold and drinkable."
"O- Not bad not great, it’s enjoyable but nothing that stands out, the abv is well hidden does not drink like an 8% beer."
"O: Good beer, hides the high abv well. Could definitely knock back a few of these without much thought."
"Cheers"
"D - Nice beer. I am really enjoying the huge malt character, which is balanced out with the spicy hop flavor. The drinkability is surprisingly high for 8% ABV, and even though I could easily go a few rounds, I would prefer it as a sipping beer. Overall, a good strong ale that is worth checking out."
"Way more drinkable than it should be at 8%. Not especially profound by any means, but great as an after work, ""I ain't doin' shit"" style beer."
"O: Interesting but I wish the taste was a bit more complex."
"Overall a good beer but nothing special. It didn't live up to the promise of it's nose."
"Overall it's tasty and interesting."
"Overall, Tavern Ale is definitely a strong ale. The hop bitterness and alcohol notes in the aoma & taste make you quickly realize that this is a big beer. However, those traits subside into a more easier drinking ale that would make our ancestors proud. I'd recommend this to others to try."
"Overall: Good english strong ale with nice fruit characteristics. Didnt really care to much for the mouthfeel nose was really good a bit on the lighter side but when you really inhaled it was very nice. I would purchase this again and again if it was available in California"
"O: Decent English Strong Ale. Good session beer with a decent amount of alcohol to make it interesting. Overall pretty well balanced and very drinkable."
"Pours a nice cloudy amber color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy off-white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some spice notes. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, nice little spice note. Medium Body. A nice little brew, glad to have gotten a chance to try it."
"Quite a big beer."
"The body was full and solid without being heavy. Drinkability was very good, especially for an 8% brew. Overall, a very nice beer. I would certainly have this in my regular rotation if it were local to me. Certainly worth trying if you have the chance."
"M/O: Very good interpretation of a homely bar style beer that has some good richness while maintaining some real drinkablilty. I think the beer seeks to be a refined and modern interpretation of what might be served back in old Philadelphia."
"O: Not a bad beer. From what I've had of Yards, they've been a nice Eastern brewery whom I've not had a lot of experience with...but have recently been pleased to try!"
"O: Drinkable and good flavor worth revisiting again."
"Overall, I really like this beer. It's my first offering from Yards Brewing Co., and it's good enough for me to seek out more of their beers. While my experience with this style is admittedly limited, I would, if asked, probably recommend this one."
"D: Malts are a little out of balance with the finish in this one. Fruity aroma and flavor surprised me a bit."
"This beer poured out as a reddish brown color with a little head on it. The aroma was basically all malts and some other farmhouse grains in there too. The taste wasn't very impressive to me. The taste had an odd Sourness to it. Not sour like a Lambic but something different. It was an interesting difference but didn't really help the beer at all in my opinion. The mouthfeel wasn't too bad. I would try this one again because I'd like to see if it still has the weird flavor to it."
"D: Great easy drinker. But not a session beer cause of alcohol content but easily would drink another or ten."
"Dr. I like this stuff. I had no clue it was 8% until I popped up the review window."
"A decent sipper, but not one I'd go back to again."
"D The more I drink the less I like it. I'll sleep good tonight or I'll be praying to the porceline god. I would not recommend this beer to anyone."
"Overall, it's a decent beer. I don't think I've had very many beers like this one."
"The carbonation is high, which when coupled with the relatively heavy consistency of the beer, makes for quite an enjoyable texture on the palate. However, the high ABV, noticeable alcohol, and not enough balance between the sweet fruits and caramel and the strong earthiness, it's a hard one to get down easily."
"Overall: Not a bad beer. I wasn't wowed by it but decent enough to try again."
"Drinkability - to me this is more of siping beer than a drinking beer the alcohol is too noticeable for me on the finish it outweighs the nice strong sweet tastes on the start. Not a great beer but a nice beet that I am willing to try again."
"Drinkability: Great drinkability for an above-average ABV."
"My 200th review that deserves some merit as this beer holds dear to me as I had several of this beer at my rehearsal dinner the night before my wedding. Poured from a 12 oz bottle and/or on tap in a chilled pint glass. Pours a deep orange body (a little darker than orange) with a sudsy beige head. Aroma of pale malts, slight spices, and candy sugar. Tastes strongly of nuts and caramel, sweet but layered; earth, cracker, and pine. Just a hint of alcohol, some bockish grape, touch of smoke, touch of spice in the back. Wonderfully crisp, just that perfect medium level, with a touch of sourness, light bitterness, medium body that can go either full or light depending on the moment. Nice herbal quality. A very authentic english strong ale that I understand that closely aligned with Thomas Jefferson's creation and style."
"This is a drinkable beer, as i have drank this beer all night before, but I really wouldnt call it a session beer."
"d: this beer goes down easier than most 8% abvs. exercise caution."
"thick smooth mouthfeel. very drinkable for an 8%abv beer. appearently Jefferson had it right."
"Overall a good beer, and a quality offering from Yards who continues to impress me."
"This is a solid, malt-heavy ale, but not a brew for which I would make a point of seeking in the future. If someone offered this to me at a party, though, I would be happy to partake."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with slightly below average carbonation. The lower carbonation worked pretty well for it. Drinkability is pretty good, it had some nice flavors to it and felt pretty well balanced. I really like the concept and the history behind it. Jefferson had a pretty good beer here."
"Thanks to my mother for bringing this from D.C."
"Slainte!"
"Murky dark orange with small white head on top. Aroma of sugars, citrus, lemon zest, some alcohol, and spices. Clean taste of citrus, floral notes, prunes, tang, spices, slight alcohol burn towards the finish along with some hop bitterness. The drink rides out with some caramel and prune flavors. Medium in body with light carbonation."
"Drinkability is good. I could easily go for another 12 oz bottle. This is a tasty, well crafted beer."
"Another style I am not quite fond of but I do like this one."
"Pours a nice moderate amber color with a thin white head. The nose brings a good deal of sweetness with caramel, candied fruits, light citrus, and some brown sugar. The taste is definitely sweet with a bit of booze. Light fruits, bread, and cake. Feel is medium with lowish carbonation. Drinks well overall."
"Drinkability: The strongness of the alcohol flavor makes this a sipper. I can't imagine drinking more than one or two of these."
"This is a nice amber beer with a fluffy dense head with good retention. There is a little bit of lacing down the sides of the glass. Very nice. The beer has a good toffee, caramel smell. I also think i am getting a little bit of dark fruitiness as well. The taste reflects the smell, with more of the fruity character coming through. For me, I was expecting this to be a bigger mouthfeel. It is about a medium mouthfeel, with almost no carbonation. This beer is a different beer than when I had it fresher (it has 5 or 6 mos on it). The carbonation mellowed out, and the hops faded, giving way to the almost barley-wine-esque character. Very easy drinker for the high abv."
"D: Yeah, it's 8%, so what? I liked this a lot on draft and continue to like it from the bottle; an intriguing and flavorful beer that would do Mr. Jefferson proud. I can imagine him out in the fields at Monticello, cultivating his crops, stirring the wort, sampling the unfinished ale, then finally kicking back on the porch for a tankard-full... well, really, I can't except for the porch part... the rest may have been left to the 'indentured servants'... but who knows. What I know is this: TJ's Tavern Ale is an enjoyable brew, one I'd love to have more of. Well done once again, Yards!"
"D: Not bad; I was suprised how much I enjoyed this. I was apprehensive to try this one considering Yards pale ale reminds me of celery and tobacco - not a good combo. This one is much better by comparison."
"A somewhat hazy deep copper colored brew with a very healthy light oatmeal colored head with great lacing. The aroma is a yeasty caramel malt with apple hops hints. The flavor is pretty sharp maple syrup with an interesting juniper burst. This is kind of thick stuff, a mid to full body with a somewhat syrupy feel. I pick up caramel and tart apple, maybe even butterscotch. Lots of flavor but not the smoothest concoction. Worth a try, not highly drinkable."
"This is yet another winner from Yards. They always have good looking, good tasting brews. Good tasting brew, and at 8% alcohol, makes for a nice session that will hit you hard later. Good stuff."
"Interesting concept and pretty tasty beer, but not my favorite offering from Yards."
"Poured into a pint glass. Showed yellowish golden brown with a good head and retention. Smell of sweet bready malts, some earthy grains and even slightly dry and bitter. Taste similar to the smell, very bready and malty, sweet with some good carbonation. No trace of the 8% abv, very drinkable."
"So there are tradeoffs, and you can't be more Virginian than drinking this stuff on President's Day."
"D: I really like this one... the ABV is a little high to make it a session kind of beer, but one or two would be great on a cool evening. Jefferson was a pretty damn good brewer."
"This beer is pretty hard on the palate. It has a nice and zesty carbonation, but it isnt very smooth. I've tried it twice , but probably won't be interested much in the future."
"Drinkability: Nice and strong, but not overly strong. Certainly would recommend trying this mild style of high abv beer. Its fair to say Thomas Jefferson got me a buzz, and could brew a pretty excellent beer."
"Pours amber with a small off-white head. Aromas are more subdued than I expected but good nonetheless. Smells predominately malty, with caramel and notes of breadiness. Interesting herbal aromas are also present, as is a faint whiff of alcohol. Tastes of big, chewy, sweet malts. Lots of caramel and toffee right up front. Feels heavy as a stone, and couldn't be less filling if were a bag of sand. Its biggest drawback is that it lingers long on unappealing notes of mainly alcohol; this is not the way I wanted such an otherwise tasty beer to finish. Fascinating nonetheless. Worth trying."
"In the end, this is a very good strong ale but the textures could be smoother and a fuller, rounder flavor and feel could help complete the session."
"Drinkability- overall its decently drinkable but not mind blowing the beer is good but not necessarily great, has decent balance but overall certain more on the malty end, a bit heavy and strong to make great session but its not unsatisfactory either, a good beer overall but not sure one id rush to have again"
"Drinkability: Not a bad drinking brew. A little sweet for my tastes, and it is lacking a bit in the complexity arena, but not bad. It's not a style I'm very familiar with, but I would drink it again if offered."
"Poured a cloudy copper/amber hue, with two fingers of white head, and great lacing. Smelled sweet; caramel, apple, honey, and malt. Taste starts with malty/apple/molasses, and then eventually dissolves to a sweet apple finish. Well-hidden alcohol content; no hint of it. Thick and smooth; creamy texture. Very good specimen of a strong ale."
"D: A really nice offering from Yards. I have not experienced this style too often, but this is a good beer. A higher ABV makes me only want one or two in a sitting."
"Jefferson, indeed! Were we to drink his actual recipe, it would taste terrible! Nothin' 'gainst ol' TJ, just sayin'. This one pours a clear copper amber topped by a quickly-fading finger of white micro-foam. The nose comprises caramel, spruce, some very light coffee (I think that's what that is...), and a hint o' citrus. The taste starts off with a solid caramel backbone, but then quickly spreads out into a panoply of citrus and floral bitters. Some peppercorn is detectable near the back. Throughout, a vague maltiness is perceived, sorta like a bland old ale hangin' about in the background. The body is a solid medium, with moderate carbonation and an almost chewy feel. Overall, a decent brew, a good occasional, but not really a go-to or everyday offering, if you ask me."
"Overall, this speaks to me as a brawny pale ale. The idea that this is (or may be) a Jefferson recipe enhances the experience, no doubt. Ignoring that, though, this is definitely something different and quite enjoyable and drinkable - but, be warned - you may get tired of it if you buy a sixer, as I did once. Hard to get through in any short amount of time. 2 or 3 will set your spirits high. But I'll surely kick this growler by the end of the night. Seek and enjoy!"
"This is from the Presidential Series from Yards. The beer pours out a dark amber with a bit of head on the top. The flavors are dominated by malt and the hops struggle to get their say in this beer. However, as the beer finishes the hops start to make their appearance in a subtle way."
"The rare non-IPA where the smell is significantly better than the taste. Good, & I love that it evokes that specific sense memory, but the booze character is a turn-off."
"I poured this into a Sam Smith nonic. It is a dark orange-amber colour, and like any good English ale, it has a fluffy white head and good lacing. I'm detecting some grapefruit and hops, although its more muted than your average IPA. But once you begin to taste it, there is a thicky maltiness, almost caramel. Mouthfeel is medium with dry finish. This is a great beer to drink occasionally, and I must give Yards credit for doing hard to find British styles."
"D: A pleasant, surprisingly quaffable strong ale from Yards. Kind of an interesting flavor, although it gets a little cumbersome in the body after a while. Another solid, unique offering from this little brewery."
"The beer is a bit medium to heavy bodied and is very smooth but yet pretty well carbonated in its finish. Very complex....very nice!"
"When I drink this beer, as I do quite regularly, I feel as if I get time-warped back to a dingy, old English pub in the 1800's. I feel like I should always drink this out of a pewter mug or something, might have to seek one out. I would seek this brew out if I were you."
"Simply put, if this 8%ABV golden ale is even close to Jefferson's tipple then dinners up at Monticello must have been fantastic. Richly fruity and with smooth caramel flavours, this is a wonderfully drinkable ale, almost like some of the best bitters I enjoy when I go home to the UK, just with an added alcoholic glow. Why on earth one of the Cville breweries isn't making this, is quite simply beyond me. As ever, this is a beer that I would happily sit by a fire place and enjoy copious amounts of, before being poured into a taxi home."
"M/D - Full body, again not sticky or hot. Easy to drink but sneaks up on ya. Not really memorable, not bad but I wouldn't look for it again."
"D - Wow what a great beer! I have two more ""ales of the revolution"" to try the ""Tavern Spruce"" and ""Tavern Porter"". Yet no Treasury ale? It's advertised on the side and yet it was not included. Regardless great brew."
"D- not bad and a nice appetizer beer. This would be good for the spring session."
"I poured from a 12ounce bottle into my SA perfect pint glass. It pours a clear orange with a slight white head, minimal lacing. Big toasty malt notes on the nose, with hint of caramel, and alcohol. The malt really comes through on firt sip, with oak, vanilla and caramel notes. It finishes dry with the slightest hint of booze. It is well carbonated and a full bodied brew. The ABV is pretty well hidden, but this one is kinda a sipper. I would purchase this one again."
"Drinks well here- very smooth malts make it drinkable."
"M/D - Mouthfeel is smooth and even along that is quite pleasant. This is very drinkable with no alcohol burn and a complex flavor that gets better the longer it sits on your tongue."
"A simple, no frills, highly drinkable brew any time of year."
"My first time trying a beer from this brewery, I found this at the local grocery store in a six pack. The beer has a nice orange color with little head and little lacing. Beer had a nice not overpowering sweetness to it with a fairly bitter finish. Tasted quite drinkable for its strength. Overall I quite enjoyed it."
"Pours a clear light amber color with some faint particles stuck floating around in suspension. Head appears slightly stained yellow with less than a finger of strength and retains poorly leaving some lace clinging to the glassware. Nose is a mix of herbal hops and sweet maltiness blended with astringent alcohol. The smell of the alcohol carries through into the taste. It has a slight grainy profile that is bitter upfront from a combo of hops and alcohol that blends through the body with some malty sweetness and finishes quite warming from the alcohol with some lingering bitterness. Medium feel with this beer and it is moderately carbonated. The alcohol flavor is pretty much the dominant factor in this beer with the hop bitterness and malty sweetness trying to tame it. Overall it isn't bad."
"D: A really good beer with an interesting mix of flavors and an genre-buster although I think English strong ale is a pretty good stab at it. A nice malty brew which is crisp and not at all cloying with good ale yeast characteristics as well. A good first brew from Yards for me."
"D - I love the Ales of the Revolution concept, brewing back to life the brewing recipes of our founding fathers... Not sure whether or not there's any legitimacy to the claim, but I would like to think there is... Quite quaffable as the 8% ABV is well hidden... Easy drinking all the way around..."
"Drinkability: I went through 2 pints in about an hour!"
"Mouthfeel is well carbonated. Drinkability? Ehh. The alcohol is obvious, and that doesn't help. It says 8% ,and I can just tell its 8%. Doesn't mask the ABV, which is probably a good idea. Still, its a good beer"
"Pours copper with a slight head. Aroma is slight but flavor is strong, malty, carmelly - maple dominates. There is a low, flat bitterness that develops late. The flavor has lots of maple and molasses. Mouthfeel is slick but a little sticky."
"Overall, I am a history (and beer) fan, so I decided to try this strong English-style ale from Yards. It is tough getting US beers to replicate their colonial cousins in the UK, but this is certainly a good offering from Yards. Def. worth a try."
"Very attractive dark copper color with a nice head and good lacing. Not a whole lot of aroma, but I did smell some fruity, malty sweetness and a hint of what smelled kind like raw almonds. I found the taste to be quite nice. Nice and malty with plenty of caramel. Also seemed to be a little bit of toasted malt that gave it a nutty flavor. It had a nice amount of fruity/herbal hops that broke up the maltyness just enough. I did not perceive any of the 8% abv. It has a slightly sticky finish with body that is on the fuller side of medium, But I found it just dry enough to be nicely drinkable for its style and ABV. This is a good thing since I can see myself having more of these in the future."
"Overall this an interesting and flavorful beer and another decent offering from Yards. Worth a Look."
"Picked up a case of the Yards Ales of the Revolution variety at the brewery. Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass. Dark copper minimal head. Heavy spice and hop notes. This is a strong ale, citrusy hops, spice (ginger, nutmeg) and sweet bready malt, alcohol finish. Full bodied with moderate carbonation. Overall I enjoyed this. Perhaps more so because it is Jefferson's original recipe. Also, makes a mean cheddar ale soup."
"(Bottle into pint glass) Poured a cloudy dark amber with a very small head that didn't last at all. A ton of heavy toasted grains in the nose, but otherwise no distinctive aroma. I might even venture to say it was burnt... Mouthfeel was very pleasant, but holy hop! The hop bitterness and the roast overpowered everything. About halfway through the glass it became too overpowering and I wasn't able to finish. I don't think I'll be back to this one, which is disappointing since I tend to like the Yards offerings."
"Mouthfeel: Lower carbonation, very smooth. Quite boozy."
"I recommend this beer to people who tend to favor English style ales as well as red ales."
"Part of the Ales of the Revolution variety pack. Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a pint shaped glass. Copper, golden color, it appears very appealing. The scent spices, and a moderate hoppiness. Full bodied flavor profile includes balanced hops and some citrus. Very well balanced between hops, malts, sweetness, and a hint of ginger. Alcohol is covered by the flavor making this very easy and enjoyable to drink. Overall kind of bland and nothing to outstanding although it paired well with a nice chunk of dark chocolate."
"I could drink a couple of these in honor of one of history's finest."
"D: This is a ale that I will drink again and again."
"D: Being a strong ale, it's hard to know what to except and criticize. It's drinkable for 8% without much knowledge of the alcohol, and it's reasonably tasty. But it's not something that I'd seek out, either."
"This beer is chewy up front... it opens right up into a huge sweet presence that fills the mouth, more specifically we pick up caramalized almonds, a bit of honey and candied oranges. It arcs with some herbal sharpness then spreads and softens in the finish with a massive dose of of caramel that grows into roasted territory. A wallop of sugary malt from start to finish...The nice surprise is that it finishes juuust crisp enough that some 'dryness' enters the picture. The sweetness doesn't coat much, but instead leaves echoes at the top of my mouth. A good beer to drink on a lazy fall evening."
"Drinkability: Since Jefferson's version of this beer was first brewed before the existence of the current style categorizations it is appropriate that this incarnation of the beer be in a ""catch all"" category like English Strong Ale. I quite enjoyed this beer, found it easy to drink, and am expecting to have another. In fact I'm pleased there is more left for another evening and to share with friends. I think Jefferson and Mrs. Jefferson who also brewed in his absences from Monticello would approve of this recreation of their recipe."
"D: Pub style ale that had that old time feel to it. Moderate enjoyment and consumption, better then average all around but really has no individual character that I would consider good in any way. Wouldn't drink this in multiples but decent by itself though limited in complexity with the booziness taking over the drink at times."
"A pretty high abv and a big, hearty mouthfeel limit the drinkability. Plus, the flavors aren't enough to have me clamoring for my next sip."
"A sipper on the syrupy side. An interesting one at that. Well-balanced. Strong but not overbearing or harsh. It's one that I enjoyed the flavor (and overall character) as it progressed."
"D- Excellent, unique, sweet, malty taste with an agressive feel to it... well hidden ABVs, can easily drink a few in a row, a great, unique beer."
"A good brew for cool weather."
"Great beer from Yards. I will definitely be searching for this one."
"Drinkablilty: I would definitely drink this brew again. Something I haven't tasted in a while and I actually enjoyed. Perfect to savor. Wouldn't recommend a fast drinking style."
"Notes: At City Tavern in Philly and this was my favorite of the night. Well balanced and rich."
"D: This is a better nightcap beer, something big to lull me to sleep. As it is, I hope I stay awake through the 2nd half of the early games."
"There's not a whole heck of a lot going on here, but it's smooth and easy to drink. I wouldn't seek it out, though."
"D - Overall this is a pretty decent ale. Surprised to find this has an ABV of 8%, because it is a fairly easy drinker. I like the sweetness and graininess of the malt, but it's a little thin and the finish is just a tad abrasive."
"An interesting beer, I still have no idea what this really is. It seems a little bland, but with such a generic bottle description I don't even have an idea of what the brewer was trying to do."
"The ale poured into my tasting snifter with a golden ruby color, and was crystal clear. There was a thin head that quickly dissipated. I couldn't quite place the aroma. I could detect the hops, but other than that it's a mystery to me. Yard's website indicates that this brew is made with ingredients indigenous to Jefferson's native Virginia. It's quite pleasing to taste, and you can definitely pick up on the strength of the alcohol content. It's an enjoyable beer worth checking out, just to see what the Founding Fathers drank."
"Appears a hazy orange-amber with a thin white head and lacing. The aroma is an odd mix of fruit and herbs. The flavor makes a little more sense, thought it's still nothing normal (I like that). It's juicy at first, then there's a hit of biscuity grains followed by citrus rind and earthy hops. I should mention the aroma hints at a possible infection. I can't tell if its juicy hops, or something more acidic and musty. Oh well, it's good for now. Worth a try for something different. Sort of like Rock Art Ridge Runner barleywine, an imperial ESB if such a thing existed."
"Move along - nothing to see here. I find nothing to recommend this beer. Sort of a sweet, bland high alcohol beer."
"It poured nicely with a lot of bubbles but the head died quickly. It starts out nice but ends with a very bitter end. I enjoyed this ale but half way through the bitterness was making wish I was done with it."
"Pours a very light copper to orange flavor, with no lacing. It's a bit overcarbonated, the head built up a lot quicker than any other beer I've had in a long while, causing a couple of small messes. Light scent, it's missing the heady scent of most strong ales, but it has a nice floral/fruity scent that's nice. Nice taste, a good blend of grains, malts, and hops, along with a little floral aftertaste, but it's a little weak as far as flavor depth. Goes down fine, but the carbonation hurt here, too."
"Pours a slightly fogged amber with a crème head. Nose is slight pine-y hops. Full, but not in my face. Flavor is outstanding I say. Nice full hop tones that stay constant. Almost seems to be a fruity edge to it that seems like apples and a touch like cherries. Feel is very smooth with carbonation and has a nice body on the liquid. Overall this is extremely drinkable. Goes down smooth and has a nice full character. Would love to have this on tap."
"Medium-bodied with a dry finish. Nicely drinkable."
"D: Quite subtle, but a very enjoyable beer. A bit more flavor would be beneficial."
"An enjoyable ale. I hope the founding fathers enjoyed ale such as this, and if not i'm sure there are many people today who would be happy to."
"Don't drink and review."
"Light sweet wheat, yeast, and honey flavors give way to a full dark hop profile. Finishes smooth with tastes of fresh bread."
"Overall a good beer with a surprisingly high alcohol content for its taste."
"A little surprised that this one was called an APA; the flavor was strange, certainly not standardish. Pours a dark amberish color. Nose is good, some spiciness and then a good amount of malty sweetness. Taste is good, lots of fruit all over the place although hard to pin down, mostly malt overall, some honey as well. Hints of alcohol in the back. Feel is medium-bodied and good on carbonation. A tasty beer, although one with a surprisingly high alcohol content that doesn't really seem to manifest much in a positive way in the taste. A good one though."
"I can and have sessioned with this one. It's quite nice. That Jefferson was a bright fellow."
"Yards' Thomas Jefferson Tavern Ale poured a great amber color with a creamy head. Unfortunately the head thinned out shortly after the poor, but it did not go completely away. The smell was clean and light with a hint of sweetness, likely from the honey. There was a slight note of caramel malts and just a hint of hops. The taste was crisp and clean with just a touch of sweetness to set this apart form other tavern or pub ales; the non-bitter character of this ale was a welcome change from many ales in its class. The honey came through in the taste, but certainly not too much, just the right amount. The smooth feel of this ale on the tongue and its light finish make this a great ale to enjoy on many occasions. Cheers!"
"The beer is a pleasant amount of carbonation for me, which is less then average. Overall the beer is very drinkable, especially for being 8%"
"Taste is thick for an APA really alcoholic but there is some malt hop balance, thick finish you can still taste everything for sure after its gone. Mouthfeel is intense, good drinkability for a dinner meal like the one at City Tavern, I would like this again for another big dinner. I guess those Founding Fathers did have some brewing ideas after all."
"And where the nose is herbal and such, the mouth is malty and... also herbal. Supposedly a truthful rendition of what the Jeff would have brewed himself, its a tasty brew that feels every bit historical. Takes a while to develop, but once warm, the malts strengthen up, hops turn a bit fruity, a faint but distinct grapefruit in there, still herbal, and a bit of alcohol, which is surprisingly high and very well hidden. The mouth is solid with good carbonation, a decent, drying finish, really a good beer that could easily turn into an everyday beer."
"Cheers!"
"Two things immediately jumped out at me regarding this beer: 1) No matter how hard I tried, I could not get it to produce any head beyond mere wisps and 2) it had a Nebraska-quality to its clarity, which is not usually the case for Yards. The color was a bright copper and the nose had a biscuity sweetness to it. The mouthfeel was medium and I got a definite biscuit taste in the mouth. The finish was dry and even a little grainy. It really belied its 8% ABV. I found it entirely drinkable and would probably have to be careful with it, given its subtleness."
"D-I like this stuff,I only have 3 bottles of it so im gonna drink em real slow.I may have had this beer a long time ago when I wasnt a BA.Ide buy it again but there are other choices that I wanna try first."
"Not too bad. Its a well done beer for sure, but not one Im rushing out to try this one again."
"Along with the ESA, my favorite of the Yards offerings. Would love to try this from a beer engine."
"The second of the ""Ales of the Revolution"" I've had the good fortune to have on tap at home. Pours a darkish orange color, with an off-white head. No nose to speak of, but the taste is delightful. Very well balanced sweetness and bitterness, and alcohol? what alcohol? You'd never guess this was an 8% brew. And mouthfeel is JUST right for the flavor - it's thick enough and rich enough, but not so rich as to fill you up (and prevent you from getting another). I will definitely have this beer on tap again. Very highly recommended, and props to Yards for another fine instigation to Revolution."
"[If you've ever had Smuttynose's Wheat Wine from their Big Beer series, that's comparable to TJ's Tavern Ale.]"
"Otherwise, not bad. There's also some honey in it, I believe."
"d- At first the alcohol taste hit but then the hops and malts combine to make for a pretty good beer. I would recommend trying one even if it's not your usual style beer."
"On Tap -This beer poured to a golden-copper color with a small white head that quickly dissappeared.The aromas were of caramel,malt and hops.The flavor was also very hoppy with a medium to light body in the beer.I personally thought this beer was ok,not a great standout though.Maybe I will have to try it again at another time."
"What I love best is it's drinkablility , this is an 8% beer but you cant taste the alcohol at all. They did a remarkable job of making a great tasting classic beer that puts you on the floor right quick!"
"Hazy copper, topped with a thick white head. Head dies to nothing, with no lace. Big grainy, malty aroma. Honey, molasses? Rather sweet and fruity. Apple and raspberry syrup. Earthy hops. Sweet flavor, toned down by the big earthy graininess. Caramel and wood, immediately dry, moving quickly into pepper and apple skin. Soft buttered biscuit. Dry, grainy finish, moderately hoppy, woody, with a yeasty tang. Modest carbonation, full bodied, kinda gritty on the palate. Strange sugary sweetness in the finish. Alcohol is entirely hidden. Dryness is nice, but the grain is a bit overbearing. Kinda feels like rye bread in the aftertaste. Lingers forever. Good thing I'm a fan of rye bread. Not the smoothest, but it's decent and tasty. I'm not sure I could drink a lot of this. Is this what beer was like back then? Odd. Still beats Bud by a long shot."
"Drinkability and Overall: At first I didn't quite know how to take this beer, but now, I really like it. It's very intersting and unique for sure, but it's also quite tasty. Definitly recommended if you're in the mood for something different."
"12 ounce bottle, w/o freshness dating, pours basic, semi cloudy light amber, with an off white head, just leaving a minor amount of lacing. Nose also is pleasantly standard, light hops and maple malt. This is a smooth and easy drinking 8% pale ale, nice malty underpinings and subtle, understated hops late and in the background. Perhaps a hint of roasted grain and smokyness to seal the deal on this nicely crafted ale."
"This pours a nice golden color with a huge foamy head.The smell is very biscuity with some citrus aromas.The taste has a real fruit,apricot,buttery,malt,and hop flavor.The m/f is light and well balanced with a real nice crisp flavor.This is an excellent ale.I highly recommend it."
"Tight nice gold with a white head that yeilds plenty of lacing. Smells of spicy hops and some malt sweetness. Taste is kind of bland middle of the road except the hops in the finish that really give it some life, bitty and spicey just not really floral or sweet all of that is left for the malt. You can't really taste the alcohol but the body is good and this is very sessionable, but at $10 a sixer around these parts I don't drink it very often."
"M & D: Mouthfeel is smoothness that makes you wonder what type of beer it is. I thought maybe an altbier or a bitter. Drinkability is real nice--Gonna work on the six pack tonight. Had a bunch of these while I was at the City Tavern for dinner about a year ago. the Rabbit was wonderful!"
"into the pint glass it pours a light brown almost dark honey. not much of a head but a think white foam across the top. smell isn't too potent somewhat average lightly malty and fruity. it has an nice balanced flavor mild malts with a little spicy hops...very nice mouthfeel and i can definatley drink a sixer"
"Appeared a deep orange color atop which sat a quickly dissipating 1/2 finger head. Slightly cloudy and no carbonation apparent. Light roasted malt aroma with grainy background. Very pleasant toasted feeling on the tongue with a hint of fruitiness in the back of the mouth. Perfectly balanced and a good aftertaste. A nice tingling about the tongue. If Jefferson really drank this beer no wonder he went chasing after Sally Hemmings! A wonderful brew."
"poured a deep peach color with nice long-lasting head that stayed throughout the glass.Smell is fruity with a bit of hops. Taste is supremely smooth with a nice fruity texture. Finish is moderately dry and absolutley enjoyable, This is a geat beer. I find it hard to believe that they put 8% in here."
"Taste mixes a fruit apricot, a sour afternotes, as well as a solid malt base. I honestly especed more hoppy ness, but it never showed. I did like the sweet and sour fruityness mixing the obvious alchohol notes, they played well off each other"
"I am not sure if Thomas Jefferson formulated this recipe after his tour of Paris as ambassador, but I wouldnt be surprised if he did come up with this beer after visiting some Belgian or Dutch tavern after making landfall in Europe."
"Bottle describes this as a strong golden ale. Emphasis should be on the word ""strong."" The aroma lets you know right away that the gloves are off. Up front, hops bite in with a non-aromatic bittering that coats the tongue and up to the roof of the mouth. Some malt sweetness struggles to break through, but a wall of hops bittering blocks most progress. 8% abv shouts out it presence throughout. If this is what the founding fathers were drinking, it is a wonder they were able to sign the Declaration of Independence. Interesting, but, in the long run, a bit too heavy handed. Wins the coolest bottle cap award, though."
"Great Ale. Highly recomended"
"Poures a deep burnt orange with a huge billowing head that really takes its time settling leaving big globs of lace behind,really pick up some lemon rind in the aroma along with some Belgina like spiciness?Not sure what kinda yeast is used here but man I get like a spicey,yeastiness in the aromas very unexpected.Wow nice mingling of flavors very citrusy and lemony upfront with that underlying spiciness but finishes with a dry toastiness with just a tad bit of alcohol burn as it warms.Very interesting and unique ale here is this what one of our greatest forfathers was brewing at Monticello?The bottle says so, damn I wish I could have shook his hand,just great."
"Poured from a nicely designed 12 oz bottle, this beer pours a clear deep amber with a small white head. The liquid is viscous in appearance. The smell is sweet malt with fruity tones. The beers flavor starts malty and sweet with biscuity malt flavor, followed by a grainy bitter finish and alcohol. The alcohol finish is lingering and a bit solventy. The mouthfeel is very full and smooth with average carbonation. Drinkability is OK but too much alcohol burn and malt sweetness to drink much of it. I'm reviewing this for what it is, and it's really not an American Pale Ale, and not really fitting in any style guidelines. I'd call it a American Strong Amber Ale."
"poured with a huge rocky pillowy white head on a slighlty hazy orangey honeyish color. fruity hoppy aroma, very citrusy with some sugar/malt sweetness and a bready yeasty character develops as this warms up. very very smooth body and a slick suculant mouthfeel. sweet raw sugar, very well defined hop character with a dry bitter aftertaste. very highly drinkable."
"Not a great beer. And its pretty expensive. I would not buy this beer again."
"""Ales of the revolution."" I love this kind of stuff. Picture of Jefferson on label and cap."
"Drinkabilty. Spot on, a good beer for food. Some crusty bread, sharp cheddar and summer sausage."
"($1.79 / 12 oz.)"
"This is a very well crafted ale, and highly drinkable. Watch your step with this one, or you might be trying to purchase large tracts of property from naive, French royals or potentates."
"Another pretty bottle from the Yards Brewery. Pours a nice amber color with a thick head that dies down fairly quickly and doesn't leave much lacing on the sides of the glass. The aroma had a little maltiness to it, but the floral hops were very present. There is a nice citrus hint in the aroma. The flavor had some caramel, malt, and citrus. Finishes a little dry and leaves an interesting flavor on the palate. I would have this one again."
"This one pours a nice amber color with just a cover of head that falls to nothing. The nose is orange, but without the acid of citrus in there. The flavor is pretty much on par with an earthy hop flavor pf an APA. The hop could be more prevalent, but it works okay. The mouthfeel is nice and thick. I could drink a few of these beers. I dig it."
"Faint apricot color with a disappearing off-white head. Aroma of biscuity malt, not too sweet, with some fruit and a touch of cinammon. Mouthfeel is full and creamy, leading to flavors of bitter orange peel hops, followed by a strong bitter alcohol flavor. The alcohol is too overpowering. I think I feel fumes going up the back of my throat and stinging the back of my nose. It's actually making me sneeze. No other depth of character or flavor."
"Definitely rough around the edges here with the alcohol potency, and I think I'd need a few to grease the chute before really getting into this."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1 1/2"" light beige head over the dark amber brew. Head is long-lasting, with foamy lacing here and there. Aroma is relatively hoppy, but somewhat spicy as well, hits me like cinnamon? Taste is pretty hardy malts for an APA, and the spices are kicking as well. Makes you almost forget this is supposed to be a hoppy offering, which I'm not sure how I feel about. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both okay, nearing good. A bit too exotic in the aroma and flavor areas for me to make an enjoyable APA. Almost seems like it should be in with the spiced ales or something. Worth a try for variety, but not an everyday, for sure."
"Had this at the City Tavern. Had asked what they had that was the strongest/heaviest, and was told by one of the guys that this had more body to it than the George Washington stout, kinda surprising. Dark honey golden with a white creamy head. Tons of lacing. Don't see the carbination too much, but it is there in the taste. Hoppy scents, light pine. Bit of fruitcup, little bit of grapefruit. Nice biteyness! Alot of carb in the taste, bit too much?...maybe.. yeah...to me. Light grapefruit juice and hops, little bit of sweetness that jumps from the background. Good alcohol taste, I like that. Decent brew, not one I would go back especially for."
"12 ounce bottle."
"Pours an amber copper color with a carefully poured pillow of beige head. Faint tones of some American grassy, lower-alpha hops and some caramelly malts. Reasonably well balanced, swayed a slight bit towards the maltier side. Evidence of a mixture of some paler and amber malts, with botanical hops in the background. Pretty darn drinkable. I'm taking a fondness of the Revolutionary era recipes that Yard's is reproducing. Now if we could only get a John Quincy Adams Unadulterated Gruit Ale in the lineup..."
"Golden and glistening, this beer leaves thick rings of lacing around a pint glass. On the first taste, the hops seemed a little overwhelming, but after a few sips everything seemed nicely balanced and easy to drink. There are hints of sweetness and fruit, especially in the aftertaste, which lingers a long time on the tongue. Well done, Yards."
"I had this brew on tap at City Tavern. This beer was very uninspiring and left a lot to be desired. Undercarbonation left it with a flat feel in the mouth. It coated the mouth in a bad way. Wheaty taste but not much hops to be found. It looked great in the glass with a moderate head."
"Very hazy amber with a thinning head. The aroma is slightly malty with a little bite of almost peppery hops. I really was a bit surprised that the beer was as strong as it is. Its pretty drinkable. Toasted bread is the base of the malt in the flavor. This could pass for a decent ESB. Drinkable."
"A great brew and an interesting pale ale."
"Backwash: If this is indeed authentic, I can see why the Founding Fathers were, braver, smarter, and more innovative than the statesmen of today. This comes pretty close to the kind of beer Ive often dreamed of brewing or drinking: a double or extra strong ESB. In any event, it's definitely more than a pale ale. This sacrifices very little for its higher ABV, maintaining a nice balance between malts and hops and a very nice drinkability. I dont know exactly why this is quite so expensive, but I have to say that much of the cost shows up in the glass, so Im much less likely to quibble about it. Maybe its because I let this sit for awhile before getting around to drinking them and they improved, but I was genuinely surprised that more people didnt enjoy this as much as I did."
"Poured from a tap at Bishop's Collar in Phila, the second try of Yard's beers of the revolution. Another good beer that is a dark auburn color with a small white, short-lasting head. The beer was strangely dull in aroma. We were drinking at an outside table, and it's possible the outdoor aromas overpowered the beer, but what aroma existed was primarily one of malt. The beer, fortunately, has a lot more taste than aroma. It is a rather complex ale with a basic sweet maltiness base with fruity overtones. The beer has a hops kick at the end that lends a bitterness that balances the sweetness of the malt. It has a thick and creamy feel in the mouth and is an easy beer to drink and begs for a second."
"Somewhat thick, and fairly heavily carbonated. A very nice quaff."
"Thanks to beerluvr for this great ale."
"The beer pours a dark gold/amber color with a thin white lace head. The aroma is decent. It has a strong pale malt scent with some light crystal malts. The taste is good. It has a smooth yet intense pale malt flavor that finishes dry and bitter with a bit of a breadlike taste. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a decent pale ale. It has a little too much abv., but it is still quite enjoyable."
"A big, thick, off-white-mocha head that dissipates slowly and remains substantial -- leaving thick lacing on the glass. The color is slightly darker and more orange hued than your average pale. The aroma is earthy, like farm air after a storm, with a hop bitterness that bites the nose lightly. The mouthfeel is light and a bit syrupy, with a carbonated tingle that compliments the hop aspect of the aroma. The taste is very clean, but ""filling"" -- substantial in it's delivery of a nicely blended citrus/sweet malt/ bitter flavor. Quite enjoyable, and I could easily have more than one in a sitting."
"Another beer I had at the City Tavern in Philly. It is a cloudy orange-brown color. Decent sized head and fruity and floral aroma with some sour notes. It is malty and I think they said that honey is used and I detect a slight amount of it. It finishes with a crisp hoppines and a slight sour dryness. Quite refreshing."
"The mouthfeel is smooth with a dry finish. The malt rides the tongue for a few seconds after swallowing. Carbonation is quite light. Medium bodied and can be considered a hearty ale. Nicely drinkable. Interesting to see how the founding fathers liked their beers."
"Red/peach color in the glass. White head on the pour leaves the glass quickly. Outer slight white ring and lace left on the pint glass. Touches on honey and malt sweetness and roasted nutty malt. Thick sweet malt initial taste followed by a roasted hazelnut and dry grass finish. The mouth is medium thick and coating upfront with a dry tongued apparent abv finish. Not a bad brew.. just solid though."
"A turbid and murky looking orange tone. Minimal head, but the bone white collar leaves some sporadic lace along the way. Aroma is pretty earthy and herbal. Some lemon notes highlight. And whiffs of hay enter my senses as well. The flavors are unique. Some lactic sourness compiments biscuit like malt in almost a lambic sort of way. The aftertaste is dry and acidic. The body is almost full and carbonation in the mouth is subdued. If I lived during the times of the Revolution and came across this brew, I'd drink it."
"Sits in the glass a chilled hazed peach skin color, thin off-white head faded quickly, some spots and smaller patches of lace stick. Smells of dulled sweet malts giving off a kind of fruitiness of nectarine, red apple, and raisin and very slight caramel. Taste has a very dullish malt profile, slightly chewy, smooth and malted up like crazy, where's the hops? Seems more like all malts to me, but I guess the hops could be adding to some of the dryer dulled citrus tones that are coming through late along with a tiny woodish note in the finish. There's a very tiny spice and floral tone coming through as it warms nearer the finish. Feel is close to medium and quite smooth with a milder tone of malts and just a nudge of carbonation and husk-like texture midway to finish. This was a bit more malts then I like my pales, like em much more hopped up and/or at least balanced evenly between the two, but this was nice enough, reminded me of a Maibock. Thanks to Francisweizen for throwing this in!"
"Pours a ruddy, brownish-amber color with considerable haze and a lot of sediment. The head is large, frothy, and long-lastingleaving large tufts of foam on the side of the glass. Its a much more attractive head than Id expected. Aroma has a wild tartness to it. Its herbal, lemony, spritzy, yeasty, and slightly bread-like. The taste has a refreshing mild acidity and nice maltiness throughout. Finishes on the dry side, with a lingering spiciness. Its remarkably drinkable and all around quite good. I wonder if this actually resembles the brews of colonial and revolutionary times? Fill my blackjack!!"
"Wasn't entirely sure what to expect from this one. Pour was nice, with a very thick head developing quickly and dissapating slowly. Smell was understated, with a bit of citrus (lemon?) notes coming through. The payoff was in the taste. Very meaty for a pale ale. lots of bright notes in the beer, again, a lemon/citrus zing rings through for me. Hops are present, but not overpowering, as is the malt. Very different from what I think of when I think Pale ale. Very easy to drink this one down. It hides the 8% ABV very well. I could easily have several of these over dinner. Very drinkable."
"Deep copper color with minimal head. The aroma is fairly sweet, and hints at familiar bourbon nuances. A bit of smoky oak, a hint of vanilla and carmelized sugar. The taste is rather earthy, with a bit of sweetness and a strong resurgent bitterness on the finish. A slight hint of alcohol is also present on the finish. Lingering woody bitterness on the aftertaste makes me feel like I'm using the old wooden drinking vessels of Colonial America. The mouthfeel is pretty robust, but not overpowering. Drinkability is OK, but the strong earthiness combined with the alcohol drop it down a notch in my book. Nonetheless, a pleasant find, and another creative beer idea brought to you by the folks at Yard's."
"ales of the revolution. sounds interesting enough. the tavern ale pours with an off-white medium sized head that retains a mild stickiness. the body is orange/amber in colour and looks to be a bit high in the carbonation department. perhaps a nice, crisp pale ale awaits? the smell is somewhat decent here. seems like it's going to be a bit thin in the flavour and body department from smell alone. there are hints of sweetness, earth, wood and malt here. the taste improves upon the smell, though not by much. it is more bitter than the smell would lead to believe and has a nice earth/hop balance to it. still seems watery but less so than the smell led me to believe. the carbonation evened out as well once the beer sat for a while. it actually ended up being rather smooth and easy drinking. this one is not bad, not great, just a decent to good brew. i'm actually hoping for better things from the washington porter, but could easily drink this one again and would not mind it at all for a session brew."
"Overall, a very drinkable beer. I'll keep an eye out for this if I'm ever in a bar in Philly."
"This one pours with a rocky, just off-white head settling (with awesome lacing) over hazy sunset amber liquid. There's apparent fruitiness in the nose, with lightly toasted maltiness sneaking in as well. The taste offers rich mouthfeel with lingering hoppy undercurrents mixed with yeasty fruitiness, malty sugars and a bit of warming alcoholic heft. Finishes toasty fruity and bitter...those Colonial boys sure drank some good ale back in the day."
"Another superb offering in the Ales of the Revolution series. A nice pale ale that's more malty than most (were there not hops in Colonial America?), and certainly one that I would have in the future!"
"Dark peach with a small white head. The aromas are of fruit, booze, melons, malts, and hops. The taste is of hops, fruit, and booze. The mouthfeel is nice and the finish is warming. The drinkability is very good for this interesting ale as well. This was an interesting beer that I am glad to have gotten the chance to sample. Unfortunately, it was not my favorite beer from Yards, oh well. It's still tasty and very different."
"Appearance: Pours a glowing golden amber with a nice frothy off white cream colored head leaves thick patches of evenly strung lacing. Aroma: Nice floral and herb like hop dosage very nice flow overall with a nice caramel malt backbone supporting sweetness here. Taste: Suprisingly more alcohol than I was expecting with some sweet gingery bread notes and a load of hops crashing down on the palate this isn't half bad. Usually not a big fan of Yard's brews but this one named after ol' Tommy J is a contender. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied ale decent carbonation but for whatever reason it's a bit cloying with some alcohol notes in the end. Drinkability: Decent strong golden ale not a beer that would get me hooked but I'm glad I had the opportunity to give it a try."
" Smooth and rich with very light carbonation. This one has a lot of body and flavor. The hops and apricots start you off with a somewhat earthy flavor. It slightly reminds me of the hop flavor of a real ale I had on cask (which one, I can not remember). The alcohol produces a little bite, but it is welcomed. It adds a nice warming effect too. Some big spices come in with a piney finish to really give you a kick in the pants. This is a well-made beer. Although the porter could have used a bunch of work, this one is a bit closer to a great beer. I am still curious why this series of beers costs an extra $6 above their normal 6-pack prices. I would just as well stick with their regular line up and Trubbel de Yards."
"The Ben Franklin Special Ale along with the George Washington Porter and the Thomas Jefferson Ale are all from Yards brewing co. and are brewed exclusively for the City Tavern in Olde City in Philadelphia. This beer that is well worth seeking out if your in the area"
"This beer is only available at The City Tavern in Philadelphia. It was originally brewed by Dock Street to a recipe based on records of what was purchased for the brewing at Monticello. The appearance is crystal clear (unusual for a Yard's product, and I'd guess The City Tavern may be insisting its being filtered as there is no sediment in the bottle) with a very nice, deep orange-copper color showing orange and ruby highlights. The head is off-white, and needs to be coaxed a litttle, but builds a fairly dense 1/4"" head. Once thinned, the whispy head lasts fairly well and leaves some Belgian-lace. The nose is mainly fruity with some caramel malt in the background, and some earthy/mineral notes although there are few hops to speak of. The flavor is far more malty than the aroma suggests, but not very complex. However, once coupled with the rich fruity flavors, it's fairly interesting. There's also a fair amount of alcohol involved, but it's well hidden. The taste ends with a gently spicy dryness and hop bitterness that eases away like the setting sun. Similar in many ways to their IPA. Well worth trying. A beer that becons you to keep tasting."
