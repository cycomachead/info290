4.19,8,4,3.75,4.25,5,4.25,"O: A fabulous brew from Rushing Duck. I am really glad we checked out this bar-restaurant (Capital City Gastropub in Albany) and got a chance to try this beer. I was a little sad that the experimental Naysayer Pale Ale was not available, but I am really glad I got a chance to try Nimptopsical -- it is a fantastic beer with a great malt-hops balance and an unique, superb mouthfeel. Excellent and check out more Rushing Duck offerings if you can find them in New York State.","argock","0"
