4.35,17.3,4.25,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.25,"Pours a hazy amber to a very dark almost ruby black color. Head builds to excellent level and shows good lacing retention. Some carbonation can be seen towards the bottom where the color is lightest. Smells of fresh biscuits, caramel, and faint Scotch like alcohol scents. Mouth is all malted bread and caramel. Good alcohol bite at the mid=palate with light hop notes. A little bitter on the back side of the flavor profile. Just enough to let you know there is some hops there. Whiskey barrel flavors of smoke, leather, and oak linger. Not sure where that comes from but it's pleasant and complimentary. Very good. 4.25 out of 5.","digitalflood","Feb 28, 2015"

If there was such a thing as an Imperial Brown Ale, this would be a good example of how to brew it right.

Malty aroma, toffee was dominant with fainter brown sugar and nuts. Hints of alcohol, butter, and toast appeared as the beer warmed. Same malty character in the flavour, but with moderate bitterness and more pronounced nuttiness. Faint cola, herbal, and alcohol notes towards the finish. Decent texture, medium bodied with lively carbonation. Overall, a pleasant beer that drinks easier than the abv would lead you to believe.","DrJay","Aug 18, 2013"

3.99,7.5,3.75,4,4,4,4,"definitely one of the better American browns ive come across in awhile. this, from right across the lake in Vermont, is a hopped up version like few ive had. it pours as red as it does brown, especially in the light. its got over an inch off tan head, but the retention is rather poor. still, a creamy rich liquid beckons. the nose is a great balance between sweeter English and American malts, and fresh east coast hops, with mild acidity. a little woody, a little sweet, and a lot yummy. the taste is the best parts of the nose, rich chocolate and caramel malts do their thing, while the beer finished on the bitter end of the spectrum with a wide variety of hop flavors and feels, including pine and sticky ganja. easy drinking for a beer of this alcoholic strength, its fuller in body and the carbonation is pretty good. its got a creamy texture and seems like a nitro tap would make this elite. I like this better than the shed ipa, and I look forward to more of their beers. this is excellent, and its even better on tap.","StonedTrippin","Jun 23, 2013"

It also produced two-plus fingers of dense, foamy deep-tan head with good retention. Color was a deep-brown with burnt orange highlights and just a touch of haze in terms of clarity. Nose had an interesting mix of chocolate malt and minty, evergreen hops. It is Girl Scout cookie season and this made me think of Thin Mints. The lacing that had begun to form was wonderfully sticky. Mouthfeel was medium, approaching full and the chocolate malt was immediate on the tongue with the minty hops following as I breathed in. This was really good, much more than I was expecting and the finish really did have a Thin Mint cookie quality to it. I will be recommending this one to others.","woodychandler","Mar 16, 2013"

4,7.8,3.5,3.5,4.5,3.5,4,"Overall, a nicely done beer, and perfect for a night by the fire. These kinds of brown ales are rapidly being lost under the influences of more hop-forward examples, so it's nice to see the New England style come out to shine. Recommended.","ithacabaron","Jan 04, 2013"

Better example of an American Brown Ale than most.","MusicaleMike","Dec 13, 2012"

4,7.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a dark, vibrant, ruby-highlighted brown coloring that looks dark and deep. A thin, sparse, filmy coating on the surface of the beer is all you get for head. Aromas of rich toffee, molasses, and a touch of roasty qualities. Smells very heavy/big, but not overpowering on the nose. Flavors are much more roasted than the nose lets on, with the rich, dark, sweet flavors entering in after the forward punch of earth and roast. Malty profiles overall, with a touch of bitter coffee at the end to draw a bitter close to the palate. Roasty and blended aftertaste, with hints of the dark, earthy sweetness you just tasted, as well as the bitterness that brought everything to a close. Smooth and clean in mouth, with a slight effervescence at the end of the drink. Very easy to drink, with a rich, roasty finish that hangs on just long enough to bring you back for more.","GarthDanielson","Dec 04, 2012"

2.63,-29.1,2.5,2,3,3,2.5,"Overall: There is absolutely nothing wrong with this brown ale, and if it was available, I would drink it, but it is not memorable and does not warrant going out of the way to find. Otter Creek taking over The Shed brewery, may have made this more mainstream, but it is just OK.","Chas58","Nov 30, 2012"
4.08,10,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"This is one of those beers that I really like because it moves through several sensations as I drink it. It begins sweet and slightly malty, coats the tongue in a creamy way, and then ends with a low to moderate bitterness which lingers and finishes dry. I had this on tap once in Vermont but the bottle is just as nice.","puboflyons","Nov 29, 2012"

Smells of caramel and light chocolate with a hint of earthy hops. Not much of a nose on this one. The flavor follows the aroma quite well. Caramel, brown sugar, and a hint of chocolate with a touch of earth and mineral water. Medium to thin body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet slick and bubbly mouthfeel. Strong ale is a real stretch for this brew, but at 7.4% I never noticed the abv. This drinks more like a brown ale but even at that its really bland. Nice to try, but I doubt I'd pick it up again.","johnnnniee","Nov 14, 2012"

Smell is biscuit, brown sugar, some carmel, and dark fruit. Taste is more aggressive with burnt brown sugar and roasted almonds leading the way. Body is medium large, plenty of carbonation, not dry, and drinkability is easy. This is a nice brew, not earth shattering. Nice price.","SawDog505","Nov 12, 2012"

The suprise I got tonite was one I would welcome anytime. I spent the same money (about ($9.00 for 6) but this time instead of anemic, flat, disgusting ,rusty barrel water, I discovered an amazing beer. Everything is right here. Pours dark with a beautiful creamy head. Full bodied high quality malt with a light hop finish. This is an amazing beer.

3.85,3.8,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Overall pretty good, nice overall robust winter like ale. I could see downing a few of these while up in the cold mountains, keep me warm and decent flavor, and for what it is it has a big flavor but still fairly drinkable.","jlindros","Oct 17, 2012"
3.71,0,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"12oz. bottle served in a standard pint. Pours a deep chestnut hue with ruby highlights when backlit. Head is three inches, dense, off-white and creamy. Head eventually dissipates into a frothy, quarter inch cap; textured clusters of lacing adhere to the sides of the glass during the tasting. Nose is somewhat subdued expressing light, toasted malts, a hint of fruit (dates/figs?) and caramel notes. Taste consistent with nose - no aspect really stands out per se but it all coalesces together nicely. There may even be a trace of coffee present in the flavor profile behind the fruit. Mouthfeel is medium-light in body with a pleasant, even carbonation. Overall, this comes off as a slightly more flavorful brown ale. I think this beer would be quite pleasant on-cask, but I'm afraid it would be dangerously drinkable - the 7.40% abv is very well-hidden.","Jwale73","Oct 14, 2012"
