Very much a dark malt and alcohol focused beer without any heavy-handed residual sugars or excessive booziness. The body is a little bit on the weak side but shouldn't matter to most folks as the appeal to the other senses is solid.","beergoot","Oct 18, 2014"

Smooth, delicious and just an excellent ale, this baby may very well be the best of its kind in the world. It really reminds me of a Scottish ale, what with its deep malt obsession, but it does have the English interest in hops about it as well. This beer was a revelation to me, certainly one I had not heard of before, but certainly one I will buy again, this time in bulk. Highly recommended.","BeerDocT","Apr 16, 2014"

3.98,6.7,3.75,3.75,4,4,4.25,"all old ale should taste like this. old tom is a classic, a genuine no frills english ale of the highest class. underrated as they get, this is everything we think about when we envision old world english evenings turning into late nights, and as claystation phrased it so eloquently, one sip and you expect to be visited by the ghosts of christmas past present and future all at once. its got just enough dark malt roast without being bitter like darker ales, rich enough, without being sweet at all, even dry in fact, and hefty while still being sturdy yet sessionable. its winter beer for me i think, but its not that confined. the combination of grain and yeast in this is impressive, i dont wish for anything else. a great balance between dark and light as well as strong and approachable are on display here. one of the more enjoyable beers on the market at about five bucks a bottle, it is an overwhelming success and a fantastic example of what true english old ale should taste like and feel like. a blue collar treat.","StonedTrippin","Feb 01, 2014"

This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is slightly strong and boozy.","UCLABrewN84","Jun 12, 2013"

4,7.2,4,4,4,4,4,"Haven't had a good ol'-fashioned British old ale in a while, so let's see how this one stacks up. It pours a deep garnet-brown topped by a finger of tan foam. The nose comprises molasses, black pepper, dark red wine grapes, light oak, and a pinch of clove. The taste brings in more of the same, along with a hint of tobacco and some extra pepper for the sake of it. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, a very nice old ale, one certainly worth re-visiting on a number of future occasions.","TMoney2591","Sep 25, 2012"

3.68,-1.3,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Old Tom is a reddish brown ale with a soft, dense, khaki head that has nice retention and lacing. It has a sweet, malty aroma with a healthy dose of chocolate. It smells a bit like wet stone. It's medium bodied and quite smooth with a dry finish. There's lots of chocolate in the taste-- not dark chocolate-- milk chocolate. Besides that, there's a little grassy bitterness. There's kind of a malt extract flavor. It's a bit sweet and the sweetness lingers. The chocolate seems a little out of place with the base beer, but I'll always take chocolate in beer.","yesyouam","Jul 11, 2012"

Taste is mellow and hides 8.5% like a magician. I do taste the pepper mentioned on the label briefly but the flavors generally blend together. Carbonation is blessedly light. English hops (Goldings?) show up in the finish and aftertaste, bit only in a supporting role. Love the balance throughout. The goal isn't to amp up or overwhelm, but to satisfy. Not everyone loves traditional English Ale, even in England, but this is excellent English ale.","daliandragon","Jun 30, 2012"

Flavor supports the aroma, sweet malt, dark fruit, distinct molasses, hints of cherry. Complex and fun to drink. Finish rather abrupt, leaving memories of faint dark malts and light hops; somewhat watery in the finish, unlike the main body of the flavor. Slightly oxidized flavors. Medium bodied, approaching, but not quite reaching creaminess. I like a beer that appears interesting and then surprises with an unusual flavor profile and this does both.

Flavor is big on prunes, black tea, caramel, and dark rum, although the alcohol is well-integrated - not exactly hidden, spicy but not too hot or medicinal. Cola and oaky red wine round out the flavor. The mouthfeel is a nice balancing act; it's medium-bodied, lush but also quite dry. It could be richer, but that might make this too sweet.

The foam is densely packed and a chocolate-tan color with lots of staying-power. The aroma is solidly good, vinous, with plenty of oak and malt. There's also a touch of vanilla, caramel, and booze-infused dark fruit. The taste is complex and mildly sweet. Balance, drinkability, and subtle flavor nuances are the key to this beer. It's quintessentially English in style, not the in-your-face American strong ale. This suits the beer perfectly. Smooth and complex, the beer is a real joy.

Slightly lighter-bodied than expected, this beer just punches above its weight and makes a really smooth yet complex digestive instead of a glass of port to round off my X'mas celebration~~ Wonder how it'd taste if bottle-conditioned?","wl0307","Dec 11, 2005"

2.59,-30.6,2,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Couldn't pass this up at only $1.99 a bottle. Strange cat on label and what appears to be a reference to Capital Brewery on the neck label. The appearance was pretty weak with a resemblence to flat pepsi. The aroma is pretty malty with chocolate and sugar undertones. Pretty uneventful for a barleywine as far as taste goes. Not as explosive as I hope barleywines are. Decent for a one-time tasting, but not impressive!","ALESwhatCURESya","Jul 13, 2004"
2.24,-39.9,3,1.5,2.5,3,2,"alright, i dont know what the deal with this beer is, but i was completely not impressed. This beer had a skunkish, kind of rotten smell. It poured a really dark amber color. Small head was present. The taste is all malts. Not enough hop balance, I even like my barley wines to be more on the malty side, but this is just too one sided. Not recommended.","bnuttz","Apr 27, 2004"
3.85,3.2,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Big malty caramel head. Dark dried fruit, leather and burnt oranges. Bitterness, though not present on the initial palate, shows well on the after taste. This lacks the depth of malt flavor that Old Nick has. For some reason this seems to be the barley wine of choice here in Osaka. Give me an Old Foghorn or Old Nick any time.","Naerhu","Apr 05, 2004"
3.22,-13.7,3,3.5,3,4,3,"Feels a bit thin in the mouth to be honest. I was expecting something a bit more rich and full-flavored. It's smooth through, and the carbonation is at the right level. One of these is enough, however.","Skidz","Jan 20, 2004"
3.63,-2.7,4,3.5,3.5,2.5,4.5,"Deep crimson hue with excellent clarity. Light beige, soapy head yields sparse lace. Mellow, ripe fig and dark caramel upfront in aroma, with a splash of cocoa. Trace black licorice and earthy hop hints. Tame and clean aromawise. Prevalent in flavor are notes of toffee drizzled biscuit and prune. Mild hints of baker's chocolate and woody, almost oaky hop tones add a bittersweet contrast mid palate. Nutty, burnt almond hints lend a trace astringency late. Lightly bittered, but well attenuated, with only moderate residual sweetness. Thinnish in body, with a mouthfeel shy in viscosity to support the malt profile. Finishes with a snap of singed chocolate cookie hints and a lingering, woody sweet Fuggles twang. A rather understated, but well rounded strong ale that's somewhat dangerous in its softness. Subtle and rather tasty.","marc77","Dec 05, 2003"
4.02,7.8,4,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,"Lovely soft bottle-conditioned mouthfeel. Carbonation level is just right - whisks away the malt in preparation for the next sip. Very nice barley wine that doesn't go over the top in any way. Perilously drinkable for what it is.","Realale","Dec 01, 2003"
3.55,-4.8,4,4,3.5,3.5,3,"This strong ale poured a dark ruby and was very clear. Head was thin and airy and slightly off white. Very strong alcoholic aroma, sweet malts evident. Some stewed fruit was in the taste profile, very malty and powerful. A sipping ale. Seemed stronger than it probably was after a steady diet of bitter.","Mark","Beers"
3.68,-1.3,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Dark burgandy with a light tan ring that forms a circle around the edge of the glass. Aroma consists of malt and dark fruit along the lines of raisins or prunes. Mouthfeel is smooth with slight carbonation. Flavor seems less complex than I expected. Malt and the aforementioned fruit flavors seem to dominate the palate. Even as the beer warms the alcohol is masked very well and you never really taste it. Finish contains flavors of prune and is somewhat vinous. Not overly complex but very smooth drinking. If there ever was a barley wine to ease someone into the style without bombarding them with hops (like some American brewers tend to do) or scaring them alway with a noticably high tasting level of alcohol, Old Tom might be the one.","Winter","0"
2.86,-23.3,3.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,4,"Mouthfeel is a bit too thin, especially for the large alcohol content of an old ale. Mostly medicinal taste, with yeasty and sweet cherry tones. I keep expecting more flavor from the beer, but all I'm left with is the yeasty aftertaste - which isn't bad, but not what I hoped for.","jahred","Sep 19, 2003"
3.53,-5.4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Comes in a 9.3 oz bottle - Nice deep dark russet brown color with deep ruby red tones and highlights. Crowned with a tall, loose, tannish head that faded pretty darn quick and the lace is very minimal in spots that evaporate. Smell has a soft caramel malty front notes lend bits of fruity darkness of cherry, plum, prune, and raisin and a little covering of alcohol. A simple yet divine little nose, nothing potent here besides the warmth of the alcohol thats a little hard to get past. Taste is mellowing caramel malts mostly with a few notes of darker fruits of plum and raisin, a slight burnt quality adds and sweetens more towards the finish. Hops barely detectable, something associated with most BW's from across the pond, this brew is UK all the way and is a fine specimen for a calmer, toned down version of most US versions. Its mellowness and tamer qualities are nice but not something I was wanting. Feel is touch on the thin side with some boldness and small girth towards the finish where the malts lay a nice little lingering burntness of chewy caramel and sweetness, nice solid finish. A pretty nice barleywine all-in-all, a beer for anytime and not special or really memorable. But I will be using this to introduce others to the style for sure.","tavernjef","Sep 10, 2003"

The palate is not as flavorful as I wanted, malty sweet, figs, nuts, candy-sugar, touches of alcohol. Rather dryÂ… modest bitterness (more than typical for a British Barelywine). Fairly long finish, pleasant malty-sweet aftertaste. Tasty. Medium-full body, lightly carbonated. This is not the best Old Ale IÂ’ve had but IÂ’d gladly have it againÂ… solid.
