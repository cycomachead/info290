"While this lambic is a whole lot more approachable than the norm, especially since it's unblended, by the same token, it's equally unchallenging. Still good, though, my enamel firmly in place for the onslaught to come."

"Poured from a tabletop keg at Dag van de Kriek in Eizeringen. The appearance is cloudy, apple-amber colored, still, with just a bit of bubbling suspended near surface. The smell is of the cellar, the apple barrel, but not mildly. Flavors of apple, banana, a bit of caramel, a sour undertone rather than attack. something minty herbal in there, a bit of bitter in the finish. Exceptional. Very good mouthfeel of quaffablly thin attack but cleansing acidity. Memorable."

"Jonge Lambic. Pour is slightly hazed golden yellow with virtually no head. The nose has some light rindy funk, notes of rubber band, touch of sea salt. Some sweet lemon and sour peaches in the back with a soapy citrus note behind. The taste falls short in expression, wet newspaper and some cheese rind. tart lemon and sour peach in back with light citrus and hint of bitterness. Lightly body, soft on the palate, soft carbontion and maybe a hint of dryness."

"D: A nice jonge lambik that will one day contribute to a nice gueuze. In the meantime, its an enjoyable experience to drink jonge lambik. A bit too intense for multiple glasses, but the one I did have was quite nice."
"Overall, glad to have had the chance to try this, and it's nice enough. Somehow feel the sample I had was not in it's prime, but still good."
"Sampled at the Oud Beersel caf√©. This Lambic is served in the traditional manner, completely flat (no CO2 at all) from the tap. The Lambic served here was most likely a young version. The beer had some reddish notes to it, unlike the Gueuze, which was much more of a gold color. The smell did not smell as sour as I had expected. The reason I think it was young was that the acidity seemed a bit low; on the other hand it had a pronounced mustiness to it that was not unpleasant. The beer was quite a bit smoother than the Gueuze, probably a combination of no carbonic acid and an overall lower acidity level."
