4.35,0,,,,,,"The beer poured a dense, cloudy yellow, straw color with a nice 1/2 head. The nose is has some fresh citrus and apple character to it. The taste starts out a tad bitter and has some pepper notes. After while a nice apple taste and orange as well comes through. The taste is a bit herbal as well. No real sour or tart taste. Very easy drinking. It is wonderful to taste such a fresh lambic, straight from the barrel. I will definitely be going back to get more of this!","ggaughan","Beers"
3.72,0,,,,,,"M&D: although this young lambiek lacks a bit of depth and complexity that is more common to older lambieks, the pungent and superbly dry palate still makes this a lovely sample of the unblended sour beer. The key thing was the condition of the beer in cask; if I had got this half-pint several hours earlier, the drink might have shown a bit more liveliness and pronounced flavour.","wl0307","0"
