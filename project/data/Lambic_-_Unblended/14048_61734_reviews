"O: A very intriguing, interesting, complex sour ale. I am not entirely certain that I would say it is equal to some of the better Belgian sours, but it is definitely close. Probably the most unique sour ale I have tried in some time."

"Very refreshing and assertive Lambic. Worth trying."

"this is a tasty bretty/sour beer. is it worth the $1 per ounce price tag i paid on an almost 12oz bottle? absolutely not, in my opinion. had it a bit of carbonation, it would've made a world of difference i feel, but the way it was, just wasn't worth it. not for the price. there are plenty other lambics/sours out there just as good (and carbonated) or better."
"The beer pours a bright hazy yellow. Very few bubbles. Almost still. Smell is earthy and musty with some lactic fruit. Taste is a bit of nectarine and pineapple. Slightly metallic. Some sulfur. The smell and flavor seems muted, possible because of the lack of carb. Mouthfeel is like water. Really hurts the overall experience of the beer. A decent effort at a sour but the mouthfeel is a real letdown."
"I love the beer, but I'm not ""in love"" with it. Why? Because it promises a high level of complexity and flavor with aroma but is so blissfully timid in its delivery that I feel stood-up on a blind date. Not real sure what to do now?"

"O: Nice light flavors and aromas of tartness/sourness without being too intense - I found this one pretty easy to drink and very enjoyable."

"Overall: For a 3-4 year-old lambic this was pretty spot-on. I would have preferred a bit more sour character, but it was quite quaffable for a sour."
"Worth a try but nothing you probably haven't already had."

"Pours light transparent yellow with a thin bubbly white head. Nose is very nice, dusty and cobwebs up front, light earthy dirt note with a strong vinous note of white grape and fruity pineapple. Taste is similar, light earthy notes and fairly dusty. Very fruity in back, vinous white grapes, big pineapple and peach with a nice light sourness. Body is very light, smooth and soft with a gentle carbonation and moderately dry finish."

"O: Gotta say, this was impressive for an Italian beer. I'd actually consider having this again."
"From a 33 cl 2008 vintage bottle brought home from Italy. One of the most subtle sours I've had. Pours almost like a soda, with plenty of carbonation and big bubbles. It has is a slight cloudiness, not surprising as there appears to be a bit of sediment in the bottom of the bottle. The color is golden and there is no lace and only the slightest ring of foam kept alive by the copious bubbles. Aroma is keeping in line with the style, slightly sharp and oakey with sour cherries notes. There is also a bit of maltiness that might be masked in stronger sours. The flavor intensity is also scaled back from a typical sour. Here, the malt plays a bigger part. Yes, there is the woody, tart characteristics you expect, with a well established (but not overdone) bitter finish. But again, the malt comes through. As it warms there is an ever so slight fermenting apple like taste at the finish. Light bodied and packed with a biting mouthfeel from the carbonation, this beer was nice, very approachable, sour."
"D: I had about 4 of these in my four days in Brussels. although Im not sure how many I'd like to have at one sitting. An excellent and interesting beer though."
