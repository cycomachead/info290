3.52,-6.4,4.25,4,3.25,3.5,3.25,"Pours a hazy yellow-orange with a foamy off-white head that settles to a small cap on top of the beer. Foamy swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is slightly sour malt, grain, fruit, and funk aromas. Taste is much the same with slightly sour fruit, funk, and chlorine flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an above average beer with a nice smell, but the chlorine taste I am getting is odd.","UCLABrewN84","Jun 16, 2014"

Firm residual tartness, slight aftertaste of wet straw and grain husks. Well carbonated with a brisk champagne effervescence. Italy's attempt at Cantillon, close but seems a bit far off on the details.","emerge077","0"

Those smoky, funky and salty flavors are a few of the intangibles that are hard to include in proper balance. No such worry here!","BEERchitect","Dec 10, 2013"

Funky taste, with fruit. Finish is a satisfying bite. Carbonation right there.A lambic to be had when you can.","Sammy","Aug 29, 2008"
4.05,7.7,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Bottle: Poured a light dirty yellow color beer with a large pure white foamy head with good retention and minimal lacing. Aroma consist of bretty barnyard notes with some light tart green apple notes. Taste is also a well balanced mix between some bretty and sour notes with some distinctive barnyard notes and some sour/tart green apple notes. Full body with limited filtration and good carbonation. Very well done with loads of character.","Phyl21ca","Beers"
