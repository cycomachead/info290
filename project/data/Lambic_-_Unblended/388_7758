The official name on the board was Single Barrel Lambic #2 (unblended) so I'm hoping this is the right place for this review. Vinegar, must, earth, wet wood, funk, and barn come through in the nose and the flavor. It sounds strange but you can really get the barrel and unblended qualities from this. Not as effervescent as blended versions. Started the day with this and was very happy with that choice. Great stuff.","Gatch","Dec 01, 2012"

I wouldn't say this was as flavorful as other Cantillons, but it definitely had the unique Cantillon funk that the microorganisms in the brewery creat.

The nose has a touch of lemon with a nice dusty funk to it, cob webbs and light leather, more lemon with some golden fruits faintly weaved in at the end. The taste is extremely dusty and funky, very old bookshelf. There is some tart lemon that comes in as peaches, golden fruits and some floral bitter hops present themselves behind in order. The body is light, very gentle, soft carbonation and rather dry in the finish. Funky is the focus, age may add some fruit as this is probably a newer oude lambic.","cpetrone84","Dec 30, 2011"

3.65,-11.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Drinkability and Overall Impression: I thought this was a very interesting beer to sample since it is, or will become, one of the components of Gueuze. Since it has already passed its first birthday, but not by much, it clearly has some maturation in its future before being blended with the other lambics that will one day join it to make up a Gueuze. I’m guessing that this one has to be let age a lot longer so that more of the mustiness and sourness can develop. My overall impression, as I’m learning more about Lambics and Gueuzes, is that this was a great opportunity to taste one of the beers that the blender works with. While it was not an exceptional beer the experience was unique and worth seeking out if possible.","drtth","Nov 04, 2010"

3.7,-10.2,3.5,3.5,4,2.5,4,"Amber-honey in color, slightly hazy with no head. Lemon, rubber, aspirin, and vinegar mingle with honey and shortbread for a thoroughly strange and mish-mashed aroma, even for a lambic. The flavor is oddly salty, sour but not powerfully so, full of green apple, orange juice, and pickled plum, with a finish of toasted grain and a dollop of butter. Generally speaking it is reminiscent of seawater - savory, salty, tangy, and a perfect match for seafood or Japanese food, I suspect. The cask carbonation is all wrong, though - this needs to be fizzier and more lively, and colder. Not a brilliant beer - in my mind this is more Gose than gueuze - but drinkable and potentially a very good food beer.","soulgrowl","Jun 04, 2010"

4.12,0,4,4.5,4,4,4,"D: I found this to be a relatively mild beer after having my palate conditioned by a taste of the Rose de Gambrinus. It was funky, but not in nearly as aggressive a manner as, say, DF Hommage. Nor was it sharply dry. Overall, it was very pleasant to drink.","Arbitrator","Jul 01, 2009"

4.37,6.1,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"On tap at Monk's in the back bar. The beer poured a hazy golden color with no carbonation into a tall flute glass.The aroma gives you citrus and a bit of farmy funk that you would expect from Cantillon beers. The taste is a very citrusy, barnyard mix that is enjoyable to the mouth and tastebuds. This is enjoyable for a sour beer as I found myself looking for another and another as it is drinkable.","ggaughan","Jun 28, 2005"
4.67,13.3,4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"The body was light, but it has more mouthfeel than expected. It tastes of fresh lemon peal, honey, and of course barnyard. It finishes very clean for a sour beer and it leaves you with just enough to always want more. I don't feel it is as agressive as other Cantillon beers, but it is still fantastic. A wonderfully complex beer that I would enjoy any time, but I think it goes especially well at the begining of a meal.","ark57","Sep 04, 2003"
4.55,10.4,4,4,5,4.5,4.5,"The beer is a cloudy golden peach color with nothing in the way of a head. Only the slightest trace of carbonation can be found, and only that when the beer is drank. Smells of tart apple, wheat and tangy pear greet the nose. I realize this is straight lambic with no fruit added, but a non descript frutiness comes about from the funky Brett. The taste is quite clean on the pallete and starts with a muted sweetness and grassy flavor which quickly spins on it's head to a citric acidity and back again. Amazingly sour and amazingly refreshing. I could have drank this all night, and any ulcers would be worth the risk. The body is light and the beer drinks incredibly easy. Seeing as this is nearly 3 years old, I tend to think some of the sharp funkiness and biting acidity has been smoothed out. Although this probably won't be embraced by drinkers new to the style, the straight lambic Cantillon puts out is fantastic and is worth getting whenever it can be found. Many thanks to Monk's for bringing this treat to Philly.","99bottles","Dec 30, 2002"
3.98,-3.4,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"This is a rating for the 1 year old Lambic. This was served from the cask at the brewery. This one-year-old was quite mellow, the characteristic Cantillon acidity had yet to come into full force. Served completely flat. The beer released a musty sour aroma to my nose. The taste though not overly acidic tasted of citrus. Tasted slightly herbal as well, with a faint woodiness to it. Definitely interesting to taste along with the other more aged products, still has a ways to go in the complexity department.","Gueuzedude","Beers"
