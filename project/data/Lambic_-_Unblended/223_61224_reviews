"Similar flavors of lemon and crabapple, sharp and acidic sourness, not unlike straight lemon juice. Dry oaky finish, citrusy and a touch briny. Very low carbonation as is expected, body has substance though. Tasty and very sour, a slow sipper to savor. Bockor has brewed lambic since 1981, and their coolship is on the brewery's roof, little known fact..."
"Overall this unblended Lambic is very sour and refreshing. It isn't the most interesting but still very good."

"This aged lambic is crazy tart and too intense to be very drinkable, but it was fantastic when mixed with the Jong. So THAT'S why they make gueuzes!"
"D- really cool to see how the lambic process works with this 4 year old brew. I had this with the new lambic side by side and it was fucking cool to see how it changed. Mad props to the great lambic blenders."
