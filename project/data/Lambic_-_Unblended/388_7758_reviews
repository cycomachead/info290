"Went to the brewery for the tour. Really enjoyed the tour and would recommend. However I am glad they only give you a small glass of the lambic itself at the end. The taste gives me nightmares!!"

"The flavor is good with a raw yet not extreme sour flavor of lambic with mild funk -still refined in its unblended young form fresh with lemony and woody elements yet the nice tropical tangy juicy flavor is not as intense with light acidity. Overall very good and was interesting to try side by side with a more finished tasting fresh bottle of Gueuze which lets you understand the progression of the flavor and feel better."

"O-Nice treat to be able to try it at the brewery. Good, but not the best of their offerings by any means."

"Unblended lambics have no smooth edges. They can typically be summed up in three words: funk, funk, and funk. Both literally and figuratively they lack the 'pop' of Gueuzes and instead really narrow in on those aspects of the style that most resemble, as Martyn Cornell has put it, ""a rugby team changing-room after a tough match on a hot day"". Sound appealing? Strangely, it is!"

"Overall- Interesting. It seems to basically be Bruocsella Grand Cru, but more raw and with a bit more carbonation."

"O - I feel like this is exactly what an unblended two year old lambic should taste. Sure its a little rough around the edges, but thats why its perfect for blending and fruit additions. I am glad I got to try this, I look forward to having it again one day, hopefully a little closer to the source."
"Nice to try the regular unblended lambic."
"O – This was a really nice 2 year lambic on tap. Clean crisp flavors, some layers of funk and acid. I really liked this since the Brett didn’t get too funky."
"This is a medium bodied brew with a lower level of carbonation. A kiss of alcohol keeps things interesting. This was tart but not puckeringly so. I found myself crushing my glass quicker than I wanted to was left wanting to drink more. I dont know how often a treat like this comes around but if you get a chance, you need to try this."
"Overall this was an interesting experience to taste a lambic so fresh and unblended. It is really oaky but not overly so but the lack of carbonation hurts the drinkability. It is still quite tasty just kind of one dimentional considering the unblended nature and the youth. I would definitely have it again but I don't NEED to as with other Cantillon offerings."

"overall this beer is great, but i do prefer 1900 grand cru"

"Overall it's a solid lambic, even if it doesn't look like something I would want to drink."
"Very interesting and unique beer. Never had an unblended lambic until now. The official name on the board was Single Barrel Lambic #2 (unblended) so I'm hoping this is the right place for this review. Vinegar, must, earth, wet wood, funk, and barn come through in the nose and the flavor. It sounds strange but you can really get the barrel and unblended qualities from this. Not as effervescent as blended versions. Started the day with this and was very happy with that choice. Great stuff."
"O- I'm very glad I got to try this- not only was it very interesting but it was very good. It was awesome being able to try this alongside other Cantillons. I wouldn't say this was as flavorful as other Cantillons, but it definitely had the unique Cantillon funk that the microorganisms in the brewery creat. For an unblended lambic this was fantastic and practically just as enjoyable as any blended lambic. Overall this was an awesome experience and I would recommend any one to try it as well if they get the chance."
"O- A very interesting beer, not my favorite from Cantillon but it's still a great beer and cool to compare to Bruocsella."

"The beer is transparent and copper to amber in color. No head whatsoever. The aroma brings basement, rain water, funk. The taste is much sweeter than anticipated. A bit of Cantillon funk in the finish, but not to the usual level. Notes of ripe fruit. Overall, this was just ok. I look forward to trying this from the source and comparing to this vintage bottle version."
"O - This is a very enjoyable, easy-drinking beer. I am not a huge fan of lambics, but this one is very impressive for a ""work in progress"" that is meant for blending and not intended to be sold on its own."
""
"A decent beer with nice complexity and an incredible mouthfeel. I can see where the Cantillon magic stems from. Definitely worth seeking out on tap."

"Beer is medium in body, a little cidery on the nose, the finish is nice with a little tartness coming through, a shadow of funk is in there as well. I really am looking forward to one day trying this beer at the source."
""
"Overall: The smell was nice but not strong enough. I enjoyed the balance and the fact that this one didn't try to kill you with tartness. I would have it again given the chance."
""
"Cheers!"

"Had on tap at Moeder Lambic. Pour is a peachy yellow, mostly transparent with a thin off white head. The nose has a touch of lemon with a nice dusty funk to it, cob webbs and light leather, more lemon with some golden fruits faintly weaved in at the end. The taste is extremely dusty and funky, very old bookshelf. There is some tart lemon that comes in as peaches, golden fruits and some floral bitter hops present themselves behind in order. The body is light, very gentle, soft carbonation and rather dry in the finish. Funky is the focus, age may add some fruit as this is probably a newer oude lambic."
"O - Pretty good but not one of my favorites from Cantillon. The nose is good, but I don't think the taste lived up to what I was expecting. There's less complexity, but it is damn easy to drink. Obviously, you're going to try it, no matter what I say. It's Cantillon."

"Overall, a very refreshing beer and infinitely drinkable. This is the foundation of many Cantillon beers."
"This was our first beer after getting off the plane and it did not disappoint. Great way to start the trip."
"overall- a good beer. great if you like tart flavors. great if you like bitter flavors. not so great if you don't like the taste of hops."
"Very drinkable, and very enjoyable. A really good experience. This is definitely worth trying when you get the chance. And the temptation is surely great enough that every beer geek will get the chance at some point."
"O: This is an experience I will likely have only once, but certainly I will recall it so frequently. My wife will be tired of hearing this story over and over. One of my best experiences. If you ever have the chance, try this, and at 2 euro, it's a bargain in my book."
"O/D - I'm so jealous that people in Brussels can session this so easily. Quite a nice little sour beer. Lot's of flavour and an ABV considered low these days. It's worth marvelling at."
"Drinkability and Overall Impression: I thought this was a very interesting beer to sample since it is, or will become, one of the components of Gueuze. Since it has already passed its first birthday, but not by much, it clearly has some maturation in its future before being blended with the other lambics that will one day join it to make up a Gueuze. I’m guessing that this one has to be let age a lot longer so that more of the mustiness and sourness can develop. My overall impression, as I’m learning more about Lambics and Gueuzes, is that this was a great opportunity to taste one of the beers that the blender works with. While it was not an exceptional beer the experience was unique and worth seeking out if possible."
"If you see this jump at the chance. Same with raw lambic from any of the majors."
"What a special experience to have this at the Cantillon brewery. Not exactly my favorite thing (I like the blends better), but very cool to have after seeing exactly how it's produced."
"My first unblended lambic, so not sure what this is supposed to taste like. Not unpleasant; I finished a half pint without struggling."
"Amber-honey in color, slightly hazy with no head. Lemon, rubber, aspirin, and vinegar mingle with honey and shortbread for a thoroughly strange and mish-mashed aroma, even for a lambic. The flavor is oddly salty, sour but not powerfully so, full of green apple, orange juice, and pickled plum, with a finish of toasted grain and a dollop of butter. Generally speaking it is reminiscent of seawater - savory, salty, tangy, and a perfect match for seafood or Japanese food, I suspect. The cask carbonation is all wrong, though - this needs to be fizzier and more lively, and colder. Not a brilliant beer - in my mind this is more Gose than gueuze - but drinkable and potentially a very good food beer."
"this is painfully easy to drink and insanely delicious. very refreshing through out and no overly anything."
"drinkability: good"
"Very interesting to try, but ultimately I prefer Cantillon's lambic older (Bruoscella Grand Cru) or blended."
"D: I found this to be a relatively mild beer after having my palate conditioned by a taste of the Rose de Gambrinus. It was funky, but not in nearly as aggressive a manner as, say, DF Hommage. Nor was it sharply dry. Overall, it was very pleasant to drink."
"Highly recommended if you happen to be in Brussels."
"D - My enjoyment tapered off a little as I drank more, but that is of course relative to the impeccable initial taste"
"Regular availability would be sweet !"
"On tap at Monk's in the back bar. The beer poured a hazy golden color with no carbonation into a tall flute glass.The aroma gives you citrus and a bit of farmy funk that you would expect from Cantillon beers. The taste is a very citrusy, barnyard mix that is enjoyable to the mouth and tastebuds. This is enjoyable for a sour beer as I found myself looking for another and another as it is drinkable."
"The body was light, but it has more mouthfeel than expected. It tastes of fresh lemon peal, honey, and of course barnyard. It finishes very clean for a sour beer and it leaves you with just enough to always want more. I don't feel it is as agressive as other Cantillon beers, but it is still fantastic. A wonderfully complex beer that I would enjoy any time, but I think it goes especially well at the begining of a meal."
"The beer is a cloudy golden peach color with nothing in the way of a head. Only the slightest trace of carbonation can be found, and only that when the beer is drank. Smells of tart apple, wheat and tangy pear greet the nose. I realize this is straight lambic with no fruit added, but a non descript frutiness comes about from the funky Brett. The taste is quite clean on the pallete and starts with a muted sweetness and grassy flavor which quickly spins on it's head to a citric acidity and back again. Amazingly sour and amazingly refreshing. I could have drank this all night, and any ulcers would be worth the risk. The body is light and the beer drinks incredibly easy. Seeing as this is nearly 3 years old, I tend to think some of the sharp funkiness and biting acidity has been smoothed out. Although this probably won't be embraced by drinkers new to the style, the straight lambic Cantillon puts out is fantastic and is worth getting whenever it can be found. Many thanks to Monk's for bringing this treat to Philly."
"This is a rating for the 1 year old Lambic. This was served from the cask at the brewery. This one-year-old was quite mellow, the characteristic Cantillon acidity had yet to come into full force. Served completely flat. The beer released a musty sour aroma to my nose. The taste though not overly acidic tasted of citrus. Tasted slightly herbal as well, with a faint woodiness to it. Definitely interesting to taste along with the other more aged products, still has a ways to go in the complexity department."
"Love It, or Hate It - this is a true experience everytime."
