"Medium bodied with a vinegary acetic flavor up front with lingering acidity but it never becomes too harsh.  Subtle malt backbone provides some balance but the tart, puckerifly flavor dominates.  As the aroma suggests it's a bit one dimensional and could use some more complexity.  "
"Acetone is strong in the nose, otherwise some light fruits (pears, apricots) and an overall tart character. It tastes a little citrusy, maybe lemon, with plenty of acidity. Puckering and sour but not as flavorful as I'd like. Still, solid enough."
"D: Very drinkable. I like the spike of tartness and the wheat-like flavors that linger afterwards. A nice beer from Iron Hill."
"D: decent but not balanced enough"
"Drinkability: I did not finish the bottle, it was not compelling. As I wrote above, this has all the elements but they are not put together yet like a cantillon or Drie Fonteinen."
"Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with medium carbonation. I dig the sourness in the one. Not the best lambic but works pretty damn good for me. Thanks Dyan!"

"A bit of a letdown compared to Jolly Pumpkin's Lambicus Dexterius or Flossmoor's Anno Unum, but pleasant nonetheless."
"750 ml corked and caged bottle acquired in a trade with hopdog, shared at Beachwood BBQ last weekend with Gabe and Kyle, poured into tulip glasses, color is a golden orange with some amber in it, small 1/4 inch bubbly head that goes away quickly, no lacing either, aroma consists of cherries, brettanomyces, acetone, lactobacillus, other berries, oak, vinegar, lemon juice, grassy accents, and yeast, starts off very acidic with a chemical-like flavor, fades into some cherries and more sourness in the middle, finish is slightly dry but mostly puckering with some mild fruit but mostly blank tart, not until it warms almost fully is there a hint of caramel and something else other than tarty notes, super acidic all the way through, sour and agressive mouthfeel, medium bodied, overly carbonated, taste lingers a very long time, I had about six ounces of this and that was plenty, sourness is just overpowering and it seems like a muddled mess at times, too tart and you do not hear me say that much, would not drink again, probably still worth trying"
"As this beer warms, unlike the Wilmington version, the sweetness does not become more pronounced, in fact this seems to even get a bit more dry with time. This beer is a much more ""Lambic"" like example than the other version, though I could still wish for a bit more bracing acidity. Both versions have much more oak character than is typical in a Lambic, but it works quite well here and actually helps to balance out the sweetness to make it just a little bit less noticeable. Both versions have an acetic note to them that is more akin to a Flemish sour, but it is much more pronounced in the Wilmington version (I think this also helps to accentuated the sweetness in that version as well)."
