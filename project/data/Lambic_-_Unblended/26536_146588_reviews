"Pours a cloudy, maize color.  1/3 inch head of a white color.  Decent retention and good lacing.  Smells of strong sourness, fruit, strong yeast, slight pale malt, slight sweet malt, and  alcohol.  Fits the style of an unblended lambic.  Mouth feel is smooth, crisp, very tart, and average carbonation level.  Tastes of strong sourness, hint of sweet malt, strong alcohol, fruit, and a hint of pale malt.  Overall, the most alcoholic and warming lambic I've ever had.  A very concentrated sourness and fruit flavor that was appreciated.  Also, the sweetness was not too strong."
