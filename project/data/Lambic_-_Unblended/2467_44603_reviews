"It's the hidden magic Fou Foune as far as I am concerned, but a real unique animal with giant fruit quality, mix of sweet and muted tangy sour quality, and.  Aging could be argued made a difference, but man I don't have the patience for this kind of thing, just stick it in my veins."

"I really don't like this style and don't understand that people would like something that taste like bile or  vomit.   Beer should be pleasant and not be like vinegar."

"Pours a hazy yellow-orange with a foamy off-white head that settles to a small cap on top of the beer. Foamy swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is slightly sour malt, grain, fruit, and funk aromas. Taste is much the same with slightly sour fruit, funk, and chlorine flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an above average beer with a nice smell, but the chlorine taste I am getting is odd."

"Tastes of lemon, grapefruit, and crabapples, tart and fruity traces of white wine, trace minerality, fairly full bodied. Firm residual tartness, slight aftertaste of wet straw and grain husks. Well carbonated with a brisk champagne effervescence. Italy's attempt at Cantillon, close but seems a bit far off on the details."

"Though led by sour taste, the ale really shows a lot of complexity but in effortless manner for the drinker. Those smoky, funky and salty flavors are a few of the intangibles that are hard to include in proper balance. No such worry here!"

"Overall - It's pretty good. Not the most interesting profile."
"O: Feels a little too ""dirty"" and home-brew-like."

"Interesting beer, but without the deepness of a lambic."
"Mondial 2009 sample. Light colour, light body with lots and lots of head--becomes a white cream that cushions the mouth. Aroma is a delight, peachy and berry. Funky taste, with fruit. Finish is a satisfying bite. Carbonation right there.A lambic to be had when you can."
"Bottle: Poured a light dirty yellow color beer with a large pure white foamy head with good retention and minimal lacing. Aroma consist of bretty barnyard notes with some light tart green apple notes. Taste is also a well balanced mix between some bretty and sour notes with some distinctive barnyard notes and some sour/tart green apple notes. Full body with limited filtration and good carbonation. Very well done with loads of character."
"Neither the most complex nor tart Lambic I have reviewed, but still highly drinkable."
