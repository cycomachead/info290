Pours lightly hazy bright golden straw color with a 2 finger fairly dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin lace that lingers. Minimal spotty lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big tart apple, lemon, pear, grape, clove, oak, hay, grass, vinegar, white wine, funk, leather, and yeast earthiness. Awesome aromas with great balance and complexity of yeast and oak barrel notes; with good strength. Taste of tart apple, lemon, pear, grape, clove, oak, hay, grass, pepper, white vinegar, funk, white wine, leather, and yeast earthiness. Fair amount of acidic tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of light fruits, clove, oak, hay, vinegar, grass, white wine, leather, funk, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and balance of fruity/spicy/funky yeast flavors with moderate barrel presence; with a great malt/tartness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and moderately acidic mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent Lambic style! All around great balance and complexity of yeast and barrel flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink with the moderate acidity. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Sep 06, 2013"

I poured a couple glasses and it was an amber orange color and while not quite translucent it wasn't turgid or anything. The aroma settled down after a couple minutes and it was less vinegar but still had an apple cider quality. Flavor was more cider, sour, apples, not bad at all. If you are judging this as a lambic you will be sorely disappointed but I do respect them for going down a difficult path. As an American wild ale its just fine. There are just some qualities to authentic lambic that Americans haven't nailed yet, maybe its the funk, maybe its the yeast, maybe its a je nais se quoi.","ArrogantB","Jun 08, 2013"

Once entering the glass it bubble up about 1/2 a finger of head before quickly disappearing into a very slim rim of bubbles. the nice golden hue of the beer is vibrant and cloudy at the same time. the aroma from the opening still last in the glass and is very enticing, which leads into the taste. the taste wasnt quite as stellar as the smell, it has a bit of watery essence at the end of the sip, that would be the biggest complaint. 1 or 2 yrs down the road i can see this developing more in the bottle. the mouthfeel was spot on for a nice american sour. overall im glad i have a second bottle and ill be seeking at least one more out. good job Rivertown, I cant wait to get my hands on the other sours from this "local" brewery.","kaips1","Aug 14, 2012"

4.22,5.2,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Thanks to jdiddy for breaking this beer out. A great label with a bottle shape that is very reminiscent of a single malt. 2010 vintage served in a tulip. Pours a pale gold hue with a hazy clarity and a loose, quarter inch bright white head that dissipates into a thin, tight white band around the edges. Nose is somewhat Cantillon-esque - salty, funky, citrusy, cork. Reminds me a bit of a funky version of Ithaca Brute. Taste follows nose - no surprises; however, the funk is less prominent than suggested by the aromas present in the nose. Mouthfeel is light-medium (but closer to light) and slightly astringent, but not overly so. Carbonation is pleasant, not overly assertive and even from start to finish. Overall, I really enjoyed this beer and would love to track down a couple more bottles to cellar. The surprise of the night for me.","Jwale73","Dec 11, 2011"
4,-0.2,4,4,4,4,4,"Big thanks goes out to my boy aasher for giving me this one during our MASSIVE in-person trade when he came down to visit! Thanks buddy! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller taster flute. Poured a hazy golden yellow with a one finger pure white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, citrus, lemon zest, funk, and slight tart fruit. The flavor was of sweet malt, funk, lemon rine, lemon zest, citrus, and wood. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. I was really surprised at how citrus/lemon forward this one was. The funk aspect was quite nice on this one and played well with citrus however. My only gripe was that this one wasn't as complex as I would have liked, but still managed to come across as a nice brew to all who tried it. Worth trying if you can find it, and worth seeking out for fans of the style or lemony brew fans.","thagr81us","Dec 09, 2011"

Pours a hazy straw gold, ample white head, and a thick cap of lacing after the head had fallen. Smells like lemon zest, saltwater (in a good way), light grain, straw, very appealing. Salty citrus, lemon, slight sweet malt, mild citric acid, slight black pepper. Mouthfeel is light-medium and carbonation is high, body lingers just enough, very well balanced, extremely smooth drinking. Damn I need more! Oh and brewer- upgrade the cork, presentation is everything, and I'd hate to have a bottle ruined by a disintigrated cork!","youradhere","Nov 12, 2011"
