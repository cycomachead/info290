"Non-beer geek friend quoth: ""A delightfully perky little number!"" so it's that, too."
"Boon isn't as celebrated a name as, say, Cantillon, but their unblended Lambic is every bit as good (and, for my money, even better). Though extremely rare, this style is so unique as to be incomparable to anything else; scarcity is its least important aspect. Still, I'm jealous even of myself for having gotten the chance to try it. Don't ever pass this one up!"

"An old lambic that is unblended. Overall a good example of an old lambic that is fairly smooth and quite drinkable."
