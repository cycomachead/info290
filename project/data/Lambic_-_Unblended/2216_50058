What an experience. The beer is hazy orange to copper hued and appears still. Earthy, mushrooms, grass, farm, funk. Light and smooth. Refreshing and delicious. Complex yet simple. What a day. A memory I shall cherish forever.","Huhzubendah","Oct 20, 2012"

4.08,-2.4,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Had on tap at the pub. Pour is a dark golden amber color, mostly transparent with very little white head on the edges. The nose is light cob web funk, sweet caramel transitions into sweet peach, orange and citrus, with a sour note accompanying. The flavor has more dusty funk, creamy lacto aspects, very strong sweetness in back, tart sour lemon, citrusy orange, peaches, and light bitterness. Creamy medium body with a soft palate and fairly assertive carbonation with a dry finish. Great balance to this, very sweet and assertively sour, less funk than I thought going in but will add a nice dimension to a future gueuze.","cpetrone84","Nov 15, 2011"
