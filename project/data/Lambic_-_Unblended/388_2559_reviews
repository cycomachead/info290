review_text
"I liked this one more than I anticipated - perhaps even more than the Lou Pepe Gueuze opened the night before.  Just slightly effervescent, the mostly flat, oily mouthfeel is more akin to wine than what I am used to in a beer. The nose is beautiful in a funky way - barnyard, hay and earth. The funk carries to the flavor but there is also a bright lemon/citrus quality and an overall lightness that is greatly balanced. The acidity is moderate and allows the delicate qualities of the lambic to shine through. At first, the flatness was off putting, but the more I drank this beer, the more I wished it wouldn't end. This beer is outstanding, and in my opinion, underrated."

"Bottle had at Kwints in Brussels, overlooking what looks to be the tower on the bottle label. 2010 sticker, March 2014 bottle date. Cool! Pours deep golden colored with no head and no real bubbles coming up. Aroma is vinous, white wine, oak, vinegar, some sugar sweetness. Flavor is honey apples, vinegar, lightly sour, funky yeast notes, a bit of buttery influence, and drinks very much like a super smooth chardonnary. No carbonation and medium bodied. This was very interesting, pretty unique, and something I’d order again in place of white wine."

"O - Mellow, complex, and unique. Striking for what it is, but not as good as the lou pepe gueuze."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is not my favorite Cantillon, because it shows less complexity than a blend as in a Geuze and I do miss the carbonation. However, it is still a Cantillon and it is always nice to experience a brew from this magical place."
""
""
""
"Overall: Another excellent beer from Cantillon. While the sourness is low by Cantillon standards, this one is hugely funky and complex. It really provides a similar drinking experience to a good wine. This one doesn't get the same the same amount of love as their other offerings, but it ranks right up there with most of Cantillon's other regular offerings."

"Overall, this beer is quite good with the proper expectations and letting it warm considerably. It is not nearly the same sour/funk experience as the other Cantillons I've had, but still a good quality beer if you're into the style."

"Overall- Not super complex, tastes a lot like Classic Geuze but flat. An interesting take on the lambic, cool to try but if I had the choice between Classic Geuze and Bruocsella, I would take Classic anytime."
""
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL: This is alright, but not as bold and flavorful as some others in the style. I would take a De Cam lambic over this nine times out of ten, for example. Still, this one is enjoyable and easy to drink, making it a perfect lambic to open on any occasion. Give this a shot if you get the chance, just be sure to try others in the style as well. Recommended."

"Just not digging the stale, just-before-the-snow-flies must that has wound its way into the DNA of this beer. Decent enough, but easily my least favorite of the pantheon we experienced during & after the trip."

"Overall. Not a fan of the no carbonation despite it being that way on purpose. Lacking a bit in flavour as well compared to other offerings. Nice to have tried but I won't be buying it again."

"I like it but don't quite love it, seeing how I don't think I've had Un-blended lambic before so personal taste may weigh in here more then normal. Cheers Ian for bringing it over"
"O - Not a huge fan of this one. It reminds me of a flat gueuze with a mustier and dark fruit aspect to it. Worth trying but I'll pass going forward"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, it's fantastic. Really deep flavors."
""
""
"Verdict: A nice unblended lambic from Cantillon, but the lack of carbonation really makes this a hard beer to drink. The flavors never really come to life and everything is somewhat muted by the still nature of the beer. Worth trying if you've never had it, but not a beer I'd seek out regularly."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Regardless of it being traditional as a three year old unblended lambic, it just is light years beyond the enjoyability I get from drinking almost anything else in the Cantillon lineup. Toss this one and Mamouche on their rears, focus on everything else they make, because they're all world class to me when you exclude those two."
"O: Good drinkability. Not the best Cantillon I've had but still a classic. Recommended"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I enjoy a still lambic every now and then but I still prefer them to be carbonated. I like the aromas and flavors but this just isn't one of the Cantillon's I would seek out. Great to try it but that was fine for me."
""
""
""
""
"Its a straight lambic. Pours a clear amber color. No carbonation here. Smell is mildly lactic with belgian barnyard funk mixed in. Taste is about the same. Mouthfeel is very smooth and buttery. Plenty of funk and an soft apple bite at the end. It's a little thin but that's expected from a 100% lambic. Overall I was really glad to have a couple of these. It's very one dimensional. Like a building block for doesjel or a close runner up to lambickx."
""
""
""
"Overall: This is nice enough but I preferred the 2 year old blended lambic that i had the same day. I'd have more."
"O – I was not impressed by this beer. I wish it had some carbonation, that might have changed my opinon of this beer."
""
""
""
""
"O: Not much else to say, I just wasn't feeling this one. 3"
"overall this beer is great, im glad i have a few bottles tucked away."
"Nothing too bad here and probably hurt my opinion that I had it the same day as Cantillon's best, but didn't really do much for me. I'd normally enjoy drinking a glass of this, but would prefer other fruited or more flavorful options when I want to reach for a sour beer."
""
""
"Overall it's a little un-varied if I could say the word, but it's a solid lambic backbone for taste and easily drinkable, but I think I am looking for just .. ""more", more fruit, more diversity, more finish."
"Sanding right there when this was poured into a tulip glass, I was surprised to see the faintest amount of bubbles that immediately vanished as I was handed the glass. The color is a bright gold shade that looks pretty. Swirls dont bring any bubbles either, I realize this is unblended lambic. Smell is barnyard scents mixed in with some apple and pear, lazy lambic scents. Hay comes through as it comes up to temp and the oak is quite bold in the end, it all comes together. Bg amounts of oak in taste with wet wood, musty basement, sour apple, light malt build, no hops. I just like the simpleness of this beer and it is more enjoyable off the tap with just a bit of life within the light body. I could drink globs of this stuff."
""
""
""
""
"Super clear orange, light ring of bubbly white head, zero retention, zero lace. Smell is of funky barnyard and a ton of fruit, tart apples, pear, lemon, musty oak, white wine vinous character and a pronounced acidity. Taste is quite tart, sour but less so than the other two beers I have had from them, fruity, apple, lemon, bits of balsamic, quite a bit of oak, earthy and musty flavours with a sharp acidic finish. Just about zero carbonation, medium body, drying feel. An enjoyable brew but SOME carbonation would have done wonders for this, still a nice mix of flavours here to make this rather drinkable."
"O - Smells amazing, but the taste just wasn't the same."
"O - This seems to be the lowest rated 'loon but I loved this beer. The lack of carbonation works so well as the tartness and funk don't get lost in a wave of spritzy carbonation like in a gueuze."
"Medium-light bodied with low but present carbonation. Easy to drink and endlessly fascinating. an instructive look at an unblended lambic, with essential flavors deep and vivid. Would love to drink this again."
"Overall, pretty good but easily the worst Cantillon beer I have had. Does not compare with the rest of the roster."
""
"O. Not to bad."
"O: An okay Loon, but the lack of carbonation is too distracting for me at the end of the day. I envision this being a great beer if it were carbonated. I'll definitely seek out some other vintages of this though."
"Overall - It's tasty, but simple. I haven't had many other straight lambics that I can compare, though, so I still think it's good."
""
""
"O: This was ok but feels incomplete and a bit boring."
""
"I know it is pretty much a cliché to like rare Cantillon bottles. Though screw that. This is something that I truly love. The unblended lambic is a great treat that I would highly recommend. Just an experience that I really enjoyed."
""
""
""
"was fortunate enough to try this one at a tasting. a cloudy and uninteresting moldy yellow liquid rests in my glass without much head at all, i know this is older, but im not seeing anything sexy about it. the nose has got plenty of fruity vinegar notes as well as a real sour flavor like unripe apples. the flavor is good, fruity and farmy at the same time, the yeast playing off the juicey sugars nicely. the finish is bang bang sour, more than brett or anything else, its like lemon juice from concentrate, puckery and bitter at the same time. no hops at all, but thats okay. feel is interesting, acidic as anything, and very little carbonation. body is medium and drinkable. id like to do a whole bottle of this but i dont think i can afford it. yummy stuff from the world renowned brewer."
"Overall: Great beer but definantly could not drink it every day like the brewers do. Overall I am Amazed with the beer. However VERY happy I did not pay money for this"
""
"O- a great beer, very interesting and would definitely enjoy another bottle of it. i think cellaring would do this brew a great deal of good. not your typical Canty, still has the yeastiness of Canty but not quite the ""wildness"" and spontaneity (for lack of better terms) that i have come to associate with their brews."
""
"As stated, the age has worked wonders for this beer. I would love to acquire another bottle of this vintage, but that's going to be hard to come by. Really good stuff, let it age, IMO!"
""
"o - overall sour egg water. if you like sour you will dig it. however, this one isn't really the tops for me. i can respect this beer, but my palate isn't there for something like this. this is beyond what i love about the style and the sourness from the age is intense for me. good and glad i tried it...but not my bag."
""
"Impressive - while there are a number of Belgian lambic brewers very few of them sell an unblended lambic (arguably the purest form of lambic beer if not the pinnacle of the art). Bruocsella delivers everything you expect from Cantillon; it's intensely dry and sour, with a light fruity character and musty depth. The only let-down is the mouthfeel - the absence of carbonation removes a desirable dimension from the body (I realise this is a contradiction, as unblended lambics are uncarbonated). However, it remains a brilliant effort - the flavour of time itself. A must-try brew; don't pass it up."
""
""
"Overall, this is an above average lambic. It's meant to be this raw look into true lambic beer, and it achieves that. NOT for the lambic neophyte, but worth a try."
""
"O- A solid from Cantillon. It is a different style, which at first I did not like very much, but the flavors and the style itself grew on me. Not the best from them by any means, but one to definitely check out if you're a fan of their other brews."
""
""
""

"Bottled 11/16/2009. Pours clear yellow without much of a head. Notes of lemony funk with some herbal tones and some horse funk. Sweet lemon upfront fades to some sour funky notes. This dominates the front of the palate. Ends with a lot of sour lemon and bitterness. Full body without much carbonation. This is a pretty good Cantillon. Not as much complexity as others in their lineup, but loaded with the sour goodness. Good, but not at the level of others."
"Lighter medium body, tart and very dry on the tongue, completely flat. There's some tasty sour and fruit flavors in this, but I have a hard time getting into beers that are completely devoid of carbonation."
""
""
"Big thanks goes out to funkydelic for sharing this one during a recent tasting! 2012 Vintage with Belgian label! Served from bottle into a Kuhnhenn tulip. Poured yellow-orange with a minimal white head. There was no lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, earth, funk, tart, and fruit. The flavor was of sweet malt, earth, funk, green olive, and tart. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. I was really quite surprised at how close to being a still brew this one was. Even though this was the case it was still quite enjoyable. All of the flavors were delicate while being intense at the same time to keep your palate on its toes throughout the glass. Really glad I got the chance to try this one fresh as I have a few sitting my cellar. Definitely a must try if you get the opportunity to do so even if you aren’t a Loon fan."

"Cantillon Bruocsella Grand Cru pours orange, lightening to tangerine at the edges, and with not quite 100% clarity. A few scant bubbles briefly form on top of the beer, but that's it, not even a bit of head to it. The nose is a little dull, but it has some wet hay notes from the brett, as well as a light tartness. There's a bit of honey soaked apple at the open of each sip, which is a nice touch. The barnyard funk comes in mid palate, and is surprisingly restrained. A brief citric/lemon sourness comes in for the finish. The mouthfeel can only be described as flabby. It's damn near completely flat, and leaves the body feeling way too full for a wild ale. I guess it was bound to happen, but Bruocsella Grand Cru is the first time I've really been let down by Cantillon."
"O- A really nice unblended lambic, like everything I've had from Cantillon I had a great time drinking this."
""
"Pours a murky orange with no head and no lacing. Smell is quite sour, tart, and funky with a slightly cheesy aroma as well. Taste is pretty much the same but not as intense as the nose would indicate. This beer has no carbonation with a flat mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer but much different from other Cantillons I have had in the past."
" Golden pour, light haze. Even a vigourous pour couldn’t raise a 1 finger head - a few whitish bubbles and then nothing. expected sour nose, grapey, tart lemons. In the mouth the beer shows plenty of sourness, lemon peel notes, sharp acidic finish, a little woody character at the end. Medium bodied, carbonation is pretty much absent here. Overall this was quite a bit more mellow and a bit less sour than I was expecting, but the key lambic notes are present. The stillness if this beer is a little strange, but the taste is fantastic."
""

"A straight top notch lambic, clean and very typical. Well done! 2006 Vintage,"
"O: This is pretty interesting to have tried, and grows on me a little bit, but I think that overall it's not for me. I'll probably stick with gueuze."

"2011 vintage. This beer pours a light bodied apricot orange in color with no carbonation at all. It is what it is. The nose is really subtle and the sour fruit characteristics are faint. There is subtle, watered down dried apricots with moderate funk. It's really light. The flavors are watery and again there are dehydrated fruits making up the sour. It's almost a neutral lambic (I know there isn't fruit), like sour water. It drinks very light in watery in body. I know it's supposed to be still but it doesn't do the beer any favors. This is still very drinkable. It won't wow you in any way but it's a nice, easy drinking lambic."
""
""
""
"A vigorous pour produces a glass of hazy deep golden liquid with a smattering of tiny bubbles on top. Dark apple juice comes to mind. Smells funky and fruity with a hint of sweetness. Tart sour cherries and lemons via for attention against a sweet sugary backdrop. Funky sweaty horse blanket with a touch of plastic phenol round out the nose. Funky phenolic comes out first before a bit of fruity lemony lactic puckers me up a bit. There's still a bit of malt sweetness in there that tries to counter the onslaught of funk, but it fails. Medium body, still carbonation, with a tart earthy sourish puckering mouthfeel. Lots of raw funk in this one, I enjoyed it, but I've honestly enjoyed some of the blended lambics a bit more."
""
""
""
"delicious, i can see why this is a grand cru, it's good."
""
""
""

"Overall: I really enjoyed this beer - the fact that it was flat did not bother me at all. I will certainly have this again in the future!"
""
""
""
""
"O. This is absolutely great, Really loved it."
"This beer pours completely still. Pale yellow/orange. No head. Aroma is very nice funk, mild cider apple aroma, and a bit of citrus rind. Pretty sour a bit bitter with funk and apple cider. Pretty damn sour. Mouthfeel is what unexpected from a still unblended lambic. Could have been a bit lighter, but very nice anyway. Overall this beer is a very well made, refreshing, sour, assertive, awesome beer."

"This poured out as a clear golden color with basically no head or lacing at all. It looks much like a white wine to me. The smell of the beer is funky and tart. The taste of the beer isn't overly acidic which is nice but it does give off plenty of sour and tart flavors. The mouthfeel is thin, again feeling much like a wine. Overall this beer is something that isn't for everyone. I can only handle so much of these types of beers. If you enjoy the style, you'll enjoy this for sure."
"Edit: it appears that the Iris has been restored to its former style. The machinations of the BA-verse confound me yet."
"Drink- I don’t have much to compare this too, because this was a different animal. It was supposed to be uncarbed and yet still be more mellow from the cask. I like the profile but needed more pop for me to come back to this flavor profile vs a standard gueuze or lambic"

"D- 4.5"
"Overall this beer would be a lot better with carbonation. Hard to drink."
"Poured a light gold, some bubbles fall to almost nothing but a thin ring of head. Lightly hazy body body, with no lace or retention. Nose has some wheat, sour green apples, Cantillon funk-iness and some barnyard. Hints of oak. Taste was tart, tart, tart initially. More green apple, wheat and funky notes again. Tartness subdues as the glass warms. Flat body (expected for the style), slick, medium full and a lemony tartness that puckers. Maybe a touch of hop bitterness at the end. Easier to drink as it warms, a nice introduction for unblended lambics to me. I'd love to try more."
"Probably my least favorite Cantillon, but I wonder if it's just me because Jean Van Roy seems so happy when I purchased it."
"O - What to say about the Bruocsella? Is it good? Without a doubt. Highly recommended. Is it good for Cantillon? Well compared to other brews from Cantillon, this one isn't quite as good as I'd hoped it would be. You could almost say it misses the mark but that seems to be a bit harsh. It's still better than alot of brews that are out on the market today."
"Bruocsella 1900 Grand Cru is pretty good stuff. The only complaint I have is the lack of carbonation. I really think more bubbles would improve it all-around. Otherwise, it performs well. The flavor is good and relatively deep. The oak flavor adds a lot. I like it. I’d probably like it more with a bit more bubbles. Thanks a ton, Chris."
"A decent enough lambic, though I prefer mine with bubbles. Above average, but my least favorite offering from Cantillon."
"O: A fine offering from the master. However not my cup of tea as far as lambics go. I need SOUR POWER."
"*pro-tip: Blend with New Glarus Raspberry Tart for extra fun!"
"Over all, this is still and above average beer, with more bubbles, this beer would be absolutely amazing. This is truly something unique and very enjoyable, just wish they would make one improvement. More carbonation..."
"Overall: Nice lambic, bit too single dimensional for my liking though, prefer the geuze"
"Aroma is strong and fruity, mainly apple with a little pear, and has a pleasant woody undertone. It pours a rich, and bubbly to the point of being hazy, golden orange; there was not much head, but I have had this bottle for a while before realizing it was an unblended lambic, a style I have never had before. Fruity flavor is more like a cider, or even wine, than a beer, but still quite tasty and pleasing, with an undertone of green wood and a sour apple bite. Texture is very smooth, yet a little edgy, leaving a fruity, woody and rather tart finish."
"Overall good, nice tart fruits, sour, bit of acidity, some light funk and bready malts, could have used more carbonation too. Not the best Cantillon, but decent."
"Stagnant and refined - dusty yet graceful...tradition in a glass. Subtle compared to some of the more robust examples of the style - but very good none the less."
"O- Yes, please. We opened this up after tasting many big boys- Crianza, Cable Car, Zwanze, Beatification, etc etc, and this one more than held its own. Really good stuff."
"Overall: Very good flavor but the lack of carbonation really detracts from this beer."
"O- A very complex oak forward lambic with funk. Hard to get into depth with this brew however without any carb, would be delicious if it a better mouth feel."
"Overall, not bad. I was expecting more funk and sourness, but was willing to settle for a more drinkable if less memorable beer. A little more carbonation would have been nice."
"Fairly tannic nose, oaky dry, a little pure apple juice with a dash of dry white wine. Foam nonexistent. Entry in the mouth easy enough but the tannins take advantage very quickly (oak) with this small taste of white wine or cider. Unfortunately a bit too flat. Sour and acid, but without being in abundance, like Cantillon products. However, the beer is too far from a final product to be really interesting."
"O - Very, very good, low carbonation hurts a bit, but still very drinkable. Held up pretty well in a group of some serious sours/wilds we've sampled tonight."
"O- A simple and very enjoyable lambic showing all the nuances that a barrel can give a brew. while some may not be down with an unblened lambics still nature im digging the purity of it."
"Thanks Khaz, for another excellent choice!"
"A must try for the serious beer drink. Loved it, but wouldn't hold it against someone who didn't."
"750ml. Poured a mildly cloudy light amber color with very thin head. Still had some subtle carbonation. Wonderful sour, funky, oaky aroma. Very sour with a little bitterness. Lots of grass, barnyard, and funk. Different then most Cantillons I have tasted in the past, but very enjoyable."
"This beer is pretty fresh (for a Cantillon) and as is, it is by far my least favorite Cantillon. I have a few more bottles of varying age and am eager to see if time will improve this beer..."
"O - A great beer; so complex and enjoyable."
"Right away, no gas. Flat. Light murky hone, no head, no lace. Tart smell, funky, my wife says it smells like barf. Taste is thin an lackluster. Horrible. Mouthfeel the same. THIS BEER SUCKS. i can only hope that this was a bad, but very expensive, bottle."
"M/D: No carbonation, but the style dictates that this will be the case, and honestly you forget about it midway through. The sour and tartness are interesting and biting enough to not really need it. It's great to be able to see the base of the geueze by itself. Will drink again. Highly enjoyable for me."
"A solid lambic with balanced flavours and no overbearing sourness."
"D - Somewhat boring, especially for Cantillon. Not worth the money."
"the cpj"
"Really my least favorite Cantillon I have ever had. My standard of Sour Belgian beers is fairly high. It was tasty, unique and certainly worth a try."
"This is a fantastic lambic. Its smoothness and flavor make it pure and simple. The flavors are so well balanced, that it is difficult to distinguish flavors. It is very similar to sour ales."
"Cantillion Bruocsella pours still, no head and a rich golden color. Aroma of musty basement, feet and sourness. Taste is quite bitter, some light oak/wood notes and a small sour. The flavors are alittle toned down and its hard to get too excited about this syrup that vaguely resembles beer. Mouthfeel is thin and flat. Drinkability rates fairly low, I was not impressed with this."
"d - While I enjoyed this quite a bit and it is certainly not a bad beer at all, this is one of the lesser Cantillon's I've had. It's drinkable and has a great nose but the taste it s bit lacking and no where near as good as some as their other beers. Would have again but not for the price."
"The flavor follows the nose quite closely. There's some initial acidity followed by a bit of earth and very light funk. Mouthfeel is light with very low carbonation. Acidity is somewhat brisk but no terribly long-lasting. Drinkability is pretty nice. Had this with plenty of cheese and it served its purpose quite well. Still, not one of the better Cantillon beers I've had."
"The body is light and dry and flat as expected. Overall I really enjoyed this beer as an experience much more than as a tasty drink. I probably wouldn't buy it again other than as an experiment in long term aging, but nonetheless I highly recommend this to anyone even if it is merely a way to learn to appreciate the sheer beauty and art of gueuze blending."
"M/D: Pretty light with good carbonation. Overall it was pretty good, not amazing, but solid for sure."
"Quite lackluster in all aspects and certainly not worth the pricetag."
"Very underwhelming. Love the flavor and idea but the head, mouth feel and even flavor suffers from a straight-out flatness. Ripe pear in the nose, slick mouth feel and a pleasant tartness of fallen apples. Tartness fades and depth is lost ... Not worth the high price tag at all."
"D - There would be no reason to want to drink something so unique. Maybe it's the fact that this is the first Lambic I've reviewed but I can't help but feel like I need to visit Belgium again. I could drink variations of this style or simply this beer throughout a night without a problem."
"Overall, a beer this old was great. One of the oldest I have had and it seemed to have held up well. It was drinkable. A lot sweeter than I expected. Good stuff."
"Easy sipping, low alcohol beer that goes down easily. Pretty flat, but this one works well without the carbonation. Goes great with dinner. Tons of flavor and just the right about of tart that doesn't obliterate your palate. I haven't had many offerings from Cantillon, but I feel like they definitely got it right with this one."
"Maybe I'm just not a fan of unblended beers, or this wasn't a great batch. Either way, this is the probably the least good Cantillon I've had and can't imagine having this again."
"D. Drank 3 glasses of this trying to enjoy it but had a hard time. This is a one and done for me."
"D: I love my cantillon beers but have to say that it is not my favorite. Still a solid lambic and drank good."
"As expected, simpler than other Cantillon lambics. Well-crafted and enjoyable, but the lack of complexity would prevent me from buying more. Give me a Fou Foune or Geueze any day of the week."
"D - more than the sum of its parts. tasty, low alcohol, and well rounded for a spontaneously fermented lambic."
"I typically tell beer newbies that lambics are a ""love it or hate it"" style, but I somehow find myself right in the middle of this gamut. Lambics aren't really my thing, but I do enjoy them in moderation from time to time. And pretty much anything from Cantillon is special (and worth trying), this one included. Cheers!"
"I have only had 2 uncarbonated lambics, and this one is definitely the crown of the style. You somehow forget the carbonation, I think the acidity of it has to do something with that."
"D - perhaps one of the more unique offerings from Cantillon that I've had. you can really grasp the simplicity of an unblended lambic. goes down quite easily, while making the eyes cringe once in awhile."
"The feel of this brew falls short, it is nearly still. It is watery but highly flavored with a sharpness of acidity. Unfortunately we had a bit of cork failure when opening this which might prove the faults in this brew so I would certainly like to give this brew another shot."
"D: This one reminds me a bit of JP's Lambicus Dexterius. A bit more flavor here though and an appreciated lack of hop bitterness. Nose could use some work but overall, a very solid lambic and one I wouldn't hesitate to pick up and age at some point."
"B: 50, 5, 13, 17, 8 = 93"
"D- I was glad to finally be able to try this but I would rather reach for some of the other Cantillon offerings. Not to say its bad but if you are looking for a sour, look elsewhere."
"Bottle: Poured a clear golden color lambic with no bubble or any carbonation as unblended lambic should be. Aroma of funk and barnyard notes are quite dominant with some stinking cheese notes also noticeable. Taste is also dominated by funk with loads of barnyard note. Body is about average. Not bad though not my favourite - I think a classic gueuze is still better then this."
"This is a fantastic beer in the taste department. The nose doesn't pop and the feel doesn't pop because it's flat! I know that's the way it's supposed to be, but I think this would be incredible with even just a little bit of carbonation. I love Cantillon offerings, but this one falls a bit short for me. Damn good flavor, though."
"Pours a clear golden, almost orange color with almost zero head and carbonation. Lots of sour funk upon popping the cork. Great sour funkiness with sour apples and pears. Also get some very floral notes as well. Taste is very apple forward with great lemon flavors. The flatness on the carbonation is really turning me off from this beer though. It makes me sad because this beer would be AMAZING with some good carbonation. This drink more like a wine (I'm not a big wine fan). It does finish dry and nicely sour though. Drinkability is not very high due to this carbonation factor."
"(D)- Not the best offering from Cantillon, however, it sure is the most easily drinkable one. Light-bodied in every way. This is a drinking lambic for the dining table. Crisp and refreshing."
"This was very complex and delicious, but it's too bad they don't release a single batch 3 year carbonated lambic :)"
"A good beer, but more challenging than enjoyable really. I greatly prefer other Cantillons that I have had. However, the worst of a great lot is still quite good. Worth a try if you're into lambics."
"M - The bitter"
"750ml bottle, I think it was bottled in 2007. Pours medium orange, almost no head, but little bubbles throughout and a fine white ring on top. Nose is very Cantillon, sour citrus fruits, dried herbs, really sour and funky. Light carbonation in the mouth. Classic Cantillon expression, big, funky, barnyard. Lemon and dried sage, dried mint. Of course really sour and dry, not as effervescent as the Gueuze. Pretty refined and nuanced."
"Drinkability: A very nice, and very tart beer. Lambics are truly one of the most unique beers out there- this beer was my first non-fruit lambic, and I enjoyed it. This isn't a beer I would drink often, but I could see myself having random cravings for this then seeking it out. Certainly worth a shot, and I look forward to more future lambics."
"D - Refreshing and enjoyable. The lack of carbonation through me off a bit."
"Had this with friends at Novere Res. Poured into a Cantillion glass. Pour is a hazy golden with a slight orange hue. No head and zero carbonation on this. I had trouble picking up anything at all on this. Earthy tones and tart apples but I feel like I might be reaching. I couldn't get a lot but it was nothing unpleasant. The taste was sour and earthy with tart fruit to it. A bit of funk made this a nice complex and enjoyable beer. The mouthfeel was interesting. With no carbonation it was smooth and easy to sip. Nice and light and enjoyable to finish the night."
"An eminently drinkable lambic."
"Drinkability: A very different brew. My first reaction was I really like the way the oak mixes with the sour. After the sourness numbed my tastes some, I realized how much this tastes like a good dry white wine. This one is a sipper and I would be curious to get it on draft. However, I am not likely to pick up another bottle at the price point. A good solid beer that is worthy of trying--at least once."
"like other reviewers have said, this is kind of a hard beer to rate, seeing as there really aren't that many unblended lambics available to us here in the us, or period for that matter - despite what the bottle says, i can think of two other, and i'm sure there are more. there is no head, but i wasn't really expecting one, just a nice, hazy, burnt gold beer. Nose is delicate and subtle, but complex and definitely opens up as the beer airs out. i get lemon, preserved lemon, grape, grapefruit, sour milk (just a touch), wood and cobweb on wet rock. pretty awesome actually. really evokes a sense of place. the taste... woah!! taste is sour, lemony, oaky... with a cobweb on wet, musty cellar wall finish. sounds strange? it is, but equally awesome. slick, medium body with a tang that holds. not so sure yet where lambic/geuze fit in to my repertoire, but the authenticity of the flavors are becoming extremely alluring to me. not for the faint of heart, but a really interesting treat when you're in the right mood."
"D= Hmmm. This Cantillon actually dissapoints a little bit. A lovely brew but not an unblended lambic in my humble opinion. This resembles a white wine. It isn't carbonated at all and the tannins and astringentcy really take over. Interesting but not for me right now. I'll prolly throw one in the cellar for fun though."
"D: Probably the most lackluster of all the Cantillon lambics I've had. Not much depth of flavor, but perhaps I need to try an aged bottle of this."
"EDIT: It was brought to my attention that 1900 was the year in which Cantillon was founded. The more you know. [Insert shooting star graphic here]"
"D: Decent stuff, not sure I'd pick this up again 3.5"
"The beer pours a clear orange color with a small white head. The aroma is awesome with very tart lemons as well as some oak notes. The flavor is pretty good, but not near as tart or sour as the aroma led me to believe it would be. I get notes of lemons with some oak. The beer is extremely dry. The only real problem I have with the beer is that the body is extremely thin and watery. The carbonation is very low."
"D - Very nice in small quantities, split this bottle between 5 people and we were all happy with out samples. Had this after dinner at a tapas bar, found it to be a great digestif."
"It's mouth-watering and fruity on the tongue, like taking a bite out of a tart granny smith apple. Tannic, leathery oak counters the juiciness, lending a strong dryness that creates and interesting dynamic. There's plenty of fruit flavor on display, from tart green grapes to apple cider to lemon flesh and peel. Acidity is strong but at a balance with the other flavors. It isn't harsh in the least, but it's certainly felt over the course of the bottle. The woody, drying, earthy tannins really take hold in the finish, giving me a mild case of cotton mouth. The stillness works wonderfully for the beer, allowing each and every nuance to have a turn on the palate and leaving the flavors lingering for minutes after each sip. Thoroughly enjoyable on the whole, this is an excellent low alcohol sipping beer with a light body but tremendous complexity."
"D: The Bruocsella Grand Cru is pretty sour/tart/acidic. It begins to wear on my palate. Would not drink it again"
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability: goes down easily, probably a good thirst quainter on a hot day, right behind a bottle of fantome. Not my favorite Cantillon but that still means it is amazing."
"Admittedly, I don't have much experience with lambics, blended or otherwise. I tried the (in my opinion) awful Lindemans fruity offerings early in my beer-drinking life, which soured (thank you) my view of lambics. I've been trying a few wild ales and lambics over the past year, and am really getting a taste for them. I thought this beer was delicious. Lots of flavor, lots of interesting mouthfeel, but nothing too overboard (and a nice, low-for-me ABV). I'm not giving it ""Well, I guess it's supposed to taste like that..."" 4s, but solid, ""These flavors work; I want to drink this again," 4s. I'm not sure I have a developed enough palate to know a 5 in this style when I taste it, but I suppose that's the risk you take when you read unsolicited user reviews."
"Notes: To be fair within style this may need to score much higher. My lack of experience with these offerings alongside what I perceive challenges offered by the brew, with a notion of overall quality made this ratings what they are... Having said that, the brew felt like a rare, and difficult, treat: rather pleasing in small servings but with a marked sour and vinegar character that is a challenge to most palates over the long run. However if one is interested in beer varieties and experiencing a quality unblended lambic this is quite the brew. I guess that outside of its ecosystem this works best shared with beer enthusiasts."
"D: Quaffable. Another gem from the world's best brewery."
"nice acid Mouthfeel (is that considered an oximoron)"
"I'm not sure why I assumed that an unblended lambic would be more funky than the blended guezes but that's not the case at all. This beer is not tart, there is no sulfur character, not a lot of funk. Drinkability is high. I really enjoy this beer but its not what I expected."
"Pours still, amber, and cloudy. Aromas of tart strawberry, with tropical notes such as pineapple, and notes of light cheese and butter. I believe that the lack of carbonation does not allow the aromas to be fully expressed. Flavor is vinous, with apples and a tropical fruit explosion before the tart finish (though not as tart as the gueuzes of Cantillon or Girardin). The lack of carbonation detracts from the experience, as the bubbles often give the tartness a nice pop. Still, a complex and wonderful beer that stands up to the other Cantillon offerings."
"Overall I'm glad I finally get to taste an unblended lambic however now I see why they're normally blended. This is a very well made beer but it lacks a bit of complexity normally found by adding and augmenting one beer with another. Still, very well worth a shot if for nothing but education."
"solid beer that keeps me sipping away. it's more dry and flavorful than any wine, but far more than just a beer. perfect for what cantillon is."
"J"
"Overall, seems like it could be a good lambic, and tastes pretty good, just dead flat, which i really don't enjoy."
"Drinkability is high. I could down this much more easily than your typical sour beer."
"Drinkability is very easy, due to the lack of funk I prefer. An elegant lambic, but not my favorite."
"D-Good beer, though a little strange. Is this my favorite lambic or even my favorite cantillon? No. Is it good and at least worth a try? Yes"
"D - This is very drinkable, although mostly because of the very mild taste. I'd have preferred things the other way around (huge flavor, lower drinkability) as there are lots of less expensive session brews to be had out there."
"drinkability is great. supremely drinkable and just mellow enough to bring the funk without getting overdone or bland. excellent offering from Cantillon. cheers!"
"A very nice lambic, and a fun beer to complete my journey to try all listed 103 styles."
"D: A nice beer from Cantillon, I can't say I was terribly impressed since I hold Cantillon in such high regard, but I'm glad I finally got to try another one of their beers."
"Light crisp fruit notes. Cherry, grape, apple pear, etc. Sour lactic funky. Not nearly tart enough but still puckering without being very acidic. More vinegary than anything else with a lot of oak/vanilla."
"M/D: astringent dry feel like cooking wine and really thin. The drinkability is difficult do to the poor taste and astringent feel."
"This is a very enjoyable, though admittedly acquired, indulgence. One is sufficient for late evening or possibly as a cocktail."
"Overall, definitely interesting enough and tasty. Worth a look."
"Havent met a Cantillon i didnt like, and this one is certainly no exception"
"(total score 3.1/C+)"
"D - A beer to be drank by someone who appreciates the style that's for sure. And even then it's a challenge. The non-existant carbonation is quite weird. Would I drink it again? Probably. Would I search it out? Probably not."
"M&D: the texture is very smooth or slick even, as no carbonation is felt against a moderate body, making this beer truly like wine or liquor in the glass. My very last encounter with any old Lambic was Girardin's at last year's GBBF (BSF bar), and the memory is quite hazy that I can't make any responsible comparison here. But this revisit shows this beer as a truly unique offering, if not a truly great one due to the quiet performance overall."
"Pours golden brown with no hint of a head or carbonation. Nose has sour funk, oak, tropical fruits and tart wine grapes. Taste is quite tart up front w/ a funky oak presence as well as a ripe citrus fruits. Medium body with no carbonation and a dry finish. Well balanced, very authentic ale. Should pair well with fine cheese, berries and smoked fish."
"Picked up a bottle of the 2005 while in Ghent. Cork says it was bottled in 2007. Overall a tasty and relatively drinkable (though not sweet) gueze that oddly enough had almost no carbonation, but I guess that's how it's supposed to be. The lemon-lime juice taste really dominates this beer, though musty barnyard notes creep in behind the fruit and come on stronger in the aroma. Worth a try, but really I haven't met a Cantillon beer I haven't liked yet."
"D: Drinkable out of interest in the different and odd but a bit disappointing really. I could see it becoming an acquired taste if I had easier access."
"2005 Vintage. The beer is a completely still, gold colored liquid. It's mostly clear, with just a slight amount of haze. Zero head, and zero carbonation. The aroma is really interesting here. The first sensation is of oak...like a white wine aged in oak barrels. That scent is followed by more expected citrusy, lemony, horsey, musty, funky wildness. Wonderful aroma. The taste is dry and mouthpuckeringly sour. It's not as intense a sourness as I expected, and seems to have been softened by the aging? This makes the beer a lot more drinkable than other Cantillon's. Light, easy to sip, and interesting. Not quite as complex or intense as it could be, but this is instead a refined, subtle, sophisticated, and very approachable lambic."
"Mouthfeel is still, almost no carbonation, medium bodied."
"750ml bottle of one surprising lambic that cost me $20. Bottled 09/05/2007. No head, and almost no bubbles. Still, orange, smells musty yet juicy. It tastes like so many different things, juice, apples, sour, must, basement, no wonder gueuze is so good. This lambic did not disappoint."
"This beer is quite interesting. When poured, it does not give any sort of head, there is absolutely no visible carbonation, belive me, I looked. The color is, however, a quite clear and atractive shade of gold. The smell, well, its like a punch in the nose, you can smell it from across the room, sour sour sour. A bit of Funk. The taste is rather underwhelming, quite one diminsional. Its just sour with a touch of oak tannins on the side of my tounge. Its even more sour than the smell gave away. The mouthfeel was like wine, completely flat. I would not want to drink a whole 12oz pour of this beer, in fact, I was a bit tired of it after about 6 oz."
"Broucsella is interesting, a unique not quite ""finished"" beer and quite fun if you like lambics - I don't know of anything else like it. But it's not really a ""good"" beer - it lacks the complexity of its Cantillon brethren and the drinkability of... well, most anything else. A good beer to have at least once; after that I'd spend your money on one of Cantillon's superior offerings."
"This beer pours and orangy amber with no carbonation so no head or lacing. The smell is of sour... almost like lemonade. The taste is nice and complex, some nice malt flavors in there with some sour/bitter lemon flavors as well. nearly no carbonation and a mild dry aftertaste didn't help the mouthfeel for this beer. Actually an easily drinking beer for all the things going on, just not the flavor wow in my opinion for the price tag."
"This deal is obviously solid and then some...drinks very nicely, is enjoyable as hell but as mentioned is a little tight for more than one or two. Still, awesome."
"The pour was decent enough with a clear, dark grape juice looking liquid with only the slightest bit of carbonation sticking to the inside of the glass. The aroma is sour, tart notes, hints of a woody or oak like touch with a vanilla touch to it. Small notes of cherry or some light fruit notes. As I take a taste the feel really throuws me off. It is almost like oily water, no carbontion and slick feeling, really distracting. The bite of tart apples is lightly offset with a touch of vanilla and oak in the finish, nothing too bad at all, but nothing blowing me away. Just a touch one to put down, the tartness was not strong enough and the subtle hints of oak, too light to make a difference. My least favorite Cantillon beer to date."
"D-- dit is extreem"
"The flavor opens with a touch of malt sweetness, almost immediately overtaken by funk, sourness and more sourness. Very light and super attenuated, with minimal carbonation. Bright, green apple sourness, with cheesy, mousy flavors. Unripened peaches. A bit grassy, very puckering. The sour finish dominates. Lasts long in the aftertaste. Dry as a desert. Intense stuff."
"This is a standout for style beer."
"I love the funk. Cantillon does make the best lambics I have had."
"Would not revisit, though it was nice to try something new."
"2001 vintage shared via fisherman 34. Pours a cloudy light orange juice colour, minimal head. Nose- citrus tart, old socks, dusty leather. Taste- not as sour as expected, but brings the funk in a big way. Very dry with a strong cheesiness and barnyard character. Light in mouthfeel, minimal carbonation. A very easy lambic to quaff. First unblended lambic I've tried. Very nice"
"Very thin,light mouthfeel,acidic,very tart fruitiness,green unripen apples,lemon rind,very earthy with wooden cask notes,very dry husky finish, vinious qualities start to finish with a slight touch of peppery vinegar aftertastes."
"6/3/6/4/13 (3.2/5)"
"This is probably one of the most drinkable sour beers I've ever consumed. I'm really digging it. It's clean and smooth and very tasty. Outstanding."
"Citrusy lemon zest, tart with some sweaty farmhouse cheese character. The oak aftertaste has a woody cinnamon bark taste that is unique. A flat body of course (unblended lambic is without carbonation by design), but the tartness doesn't allow it to be lifeless. The tartness is approaching moderate without becoming aggressive. Easy to sip and savor an entire bottle to yourself, or preferably to introduce someone else to the world of Lambic."
"good drinkability, it's actually smoother than i anticipated, being a pretty easy drinking experience as these types go."
"2007 vintage bottle. Pours out with no pop when de-corking and no head at all. A vigorous pours sees some bubbles floating around. A cloudy deep yellow color. The aroma is a sour perfume-like and woody note. The initial taste is sour, but not anywhere near some of the others I've had, such as the Iris. Instead, a strong funky sourness is alongside a smooth and full sawdust flavor. As it warms a ton of flavor is released, mostly more wood infused sourness, some slight funky and citrus. Quite good. Something original and pure. Though it has no head, the body is somehow smooth and nice. It also goes down quite well."
"d: I'll treat this as a novelty I suppose. I wanted to taste where gueuze comes from and now I know. Trying this makes me appreciate gueuze all the more. My curiosity is satisfied, no more unblended lambic for me."
"D: This one's a little rough for my palette."
"Hazy golden color with a few soapy bubbles but basically no head. Sour aroma with grapefruit and stinky cheese. Musky and woody. Flat and watery with a good body. Everything in this beer is subtle but delicious. Its drinkability is higher than most lambics I've had."
"D-Quite refreshing and amazingly highly drinkable. Hold your nose and enjoy the master funk of Brett!"
"D - Not a very drinkable beer. You may want to try it to experience an unblendrf lambic but it's not something I would make a habit up, especially given the price tag. Interesting, yes; pleasant, not so much."
"This beer pours a cloudy bright orange color. There is no head. The aroma is of barnyard, orange peel, green apples, minerals, oak, and happiness. The taste is of green apples, followed by barnyard bretta, with a dry puckering sour finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, with low carbonation and a silky texture. Overall, this is a wonderful lambic. I will certainly drink this again."
"D: Not my favorite style. considering that it's still not as drinkable as i'd like."
"I don't think I'll try this one again because the price is a bit much for my income, and I don't think it blew me away the way an $18 beer should. But it was still nice to try, especially for fans of the style."
"I had never seen this particular Cantillon beer around, so decided that it might be good for a hot day like today. Poured in to a wine glass (as suggested) an orange amber color, with quite literally no head at all. Aroma is typical for a Cantillon brew, with lemon, grass, yeast, some funk etc. Taste is of fresh lemons, oranges, grain and some slight vinegar. This one is not quite as mouth puckering as some of the other brews I have sampled from this brewery. Perhaps the age of this beer has calmed it down a bit. Body is my only real gripe with this beer. There is no carbonation whatsoever. I suppose that is what they were going for in their comparing it to a chardonnay, but I like at least some fizz in my beer. A bottle was rather easy to drink. Not a bad beer IMO, but not something that I will be purchasing again. I will stick with the Iris."
"D: Well I hate to waste beer, but most of this one is going down the sink. I tried to enjoy it, but I would rather have water than this one. Its just not my thing."
"Slightly hazy golden pour with zero head whatsoever. Smells like a dirty medicated band-aid. Musty, funky, bacteria laden. Taste is completely bland, acidic tartness. No balancing malt. Zero carbonation and feels like drinking rancid bile water. Not an example of the style that I enjoyed, and I found this very hard to drink, unfortunately."
"Very refreshing and highly drinkable. Better on tap than the bottled version."
"Non-carbonation works surprisingly well for this sour, interesting change from the aggressive foaming of say, a geuze with similar flavors."
"D: Definitly a great single blended lambic that will leave you puckering from the sourness and wanting more. Very acidic and tart."
"I've heard all sorts of scary things about real lambics (not those stickysweet fruit lambics that qualify as chick beer). About how they're hard-edged, uncompromising, extremely variable from batch to batch, and so on. Broucsella 1900 Grand Cru is pretty easy to live with and the first half has gone well enough. When it's all said and done, though, I don't think I'll be plunking down the cash for another bottle."
"I had this bottle in my refrigerator for quite a while, waiting for the perfect time to open it and I finally just decided to open it with dinner tonight. I paired it with honey mustard glazed Basa fillets and Sauteed green beans and garlic. I was afraid the sweet glaze on the fish would clash with the sour beer, but it was an excellent match. It was happy surprise that the beer contained some mustard notes that further complimented the glaze. The beans were more ambivalent, but the sourness of the lambic complimented the garlic in a nice way."
"Off notes from 6-2007. Pours a hazed gold with a funky nose (surprise, surprise). Flavor is a load of tangy oranges. The liquid feel is thicker than I usually expect lambics to be. It's good. Not my favorite lambic really, but still pretty decent. Just a bit too tangy for my likes is all."
"Hmmn. After lots of various lambics and Guezes, I believe this is my forst still, unblended lambic. I definitely prefer blended ;ambics and some carbonation. That said, it is what it is. Poured absolutely still and golden, just the tiniest bit hazy. The smell is very light, with lemon sourness up front followed by some light barnyard aromas and finishing with a spritz of acetic aroma. Taste is sour and slightly herbal up front, sorta like orange juice tastes after brushing your teeth. This is followed by flavors of ripe soft cheese and some oaky tannic bitterness. Mouthfeel is still, tannic, and a litttle puckery. Not really my style, but interesting to try."
"D = Not my cup of tea. Never again."
"Some string provel cheese will go nicely with the next glass."
"A delicate, somewhat reserved Lambic; no doubt due to the three years of aging in oak barrels. Not my personal favorite of the Cantillon offerings, but pleasant."
"Pours a clear gold, tiny white head forms, big bubbles, leaves a ring around the glass. Smell is insane, acidic, citrusy lime, salt and vinegar, barnyardy funk, almost burns my nostrils! Taste is similar, very acidic, citric, sour funk, malt middle, vinegar, barnyard, tart lime finish, crazy. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium to high carbonation. Another Cantillon I want more of. So crazy but so good."
"Originally reviewed March 25, 2007. 750mL thanks to Dr. Bill. Horsey wild grunge with an almost lemon goat cheese lactic flush. Mexican cilantro floralness kicks in and runs through the nostrils. Pours a clouded pale gold. Crushing sour tannic flavor, with raging earthy mustiness. Sewer notes? Very parching and old, with fresh bandages. Astonishing acidity and finishes with a hop-lavender flutter. Smacks on lemon pith. A little coarse and biting, but somewhat endearing."
"D: Surprisingly refreshing. Drinkability kept getting better and better as the temperature rose."
"Drinkability: I'm tellin' ya, ""Gas Line Lemonade""."
"Pale, turbid auric hue. It's nearly still, thus no head or lace forms. Initial waft of fermented lemon peel and overripe apricot gives way to soft leathery notes along with sweetart hints of partially converted cider and white wine vinegar. Swirling release notions of honey and aspirin. Enticing aromawise, indeed. Incipient in flavor is a brusque wash of clean, simply tart dilute acetic acid. Ensuing mid palate is a burly melange of goaty caproic acid, tepid lactic acid tartness, all enveloped by rounded fermented citrus pith like bitterness. As the beer warms, lemon and dried sour plum candy hints arise along with suggestions of powdered quinine. Dusty, thinnish mouthfeel that's akin to filtered still cider. Finishes with a snap of bile - like bitterness and lingering white grape skin like tannins. A delicious lambic, with stunning complexities, yet it sits softly on the palate. Outstanding. Big thanks to Realale for this fine brew."
"The beer is pretty straightforward with the flavor: imagine a fruit lambic without any sweetness from the fruit and you have this beer. Not as a gentle as some gueuzes, this is just straight up sourness. Loved it and it would make an excellent session beer for lambic lovers."
"Overall: I am glad to have tried this beer. I liked it, and would definately have it again."
"Tough beer to review; not like others I've had. Poured into a flute, it's a dark yellow with no carbonation. It looks like a glass of wine. An intriguing fruity, musty aroma, with perhaps a little spice. Sour fruit (apple) taste. Very still. I initially didn't like it, but as it warmed a little and I got used to it, I began to enjoy it more. I'll probably try it again."
"This is a well put-together beer, and you can tell there is a lot of quality and thought to this, however it just doesn't come together as well as you'd hope. There are definitely better lambics out there."
"Very interesting, and recommended."
"Overall a very enjoyable and drinkable beer. I picked this up for $9, which for a Cantillon 750 seems like a hell of a deal. I would definitely recommend this and would love to have more lying around for myself."
"Thin pungent sourness soon fills out and envelops the tongue. Funky and powerfully sour. The sourness remains long after the beer is gone. Mouth is very lightly carbonated, nearly flat. For Cantillon, it's fairly drinkable although a sipper. This is an interesting beer but I don't think it will be a regular."
"Ahhh, man. Cantillon is the unquestioned master of lambics and this is a prime example of what I am talkin' about. Yeah."
"interesting but for me cantillon makes far superior and more interesting brews. if I want something tart hand me their gueze. The oak adds some interesting notes but not much imo."
"Overall, this is a very unique taste profile, and I enjoy it as a once-in-a-while treat. Good stuff when craving something tart."
"Poured from 750ml bottle, slightly chilled, into a wine glass. Hazed golden hue, very delicate and still, with a light ring of froth around the rim of the glass. Sour apple in the nose. Tart upfront, which isnt so harsh after the first sip. Sour mash/bretty tastes dominate the flavor, but a light pear or apple infused white wine (no idea what grape) is noted. Mouthfeel is very dry and light, with a puckering sour finish. Very enjoyable, easy enough to drink. Drink it slow, however, and appreciate its complexities."
"I remarked that while this could be found at Whole Foods, I didn't think it would be served in Shea stadium anytime soon as one needed a lot of time to go over it to find its reason of being."
"This has a thick-water feel that is mineral rich as though the water sat in a cistern for a long while. It has the affect that I get upon chewing on some fresh bio-dynamic spinach: The corners of my mouth are itchy with minerals, and acid. The oak is puckering. The body is as soft as the favorite parts of my lover. Did someone sqeeze a fruit tree through a juicer here? This is so dry except for a keel of honey thinned with green apple juice, a couple drops of tropical fruit essence, and grain soaking water. The sourness is so pervasive, but smooth. Sip after sip gives me pleasure that is both relaxing, and inpsiring. This is a real transport beyond time. This kind of pleasure is why people smoke a pin joint every evening; or pour a couple fingers of bourbon, or scotch; or light aromatherapy candles around the bath/hot tub. This is gentle relaxation. It is the definition of idle time well spent."
"A good lambic as all Cantillon's I've sampled have been. However I find the mouthfeel to be way to thin on this one. I think it could have used a little more cabonation, or at least strength to balance the acidity."
"Overall: This beer is enjoyable, but it doesn't stand up to the Lou Pepe Kriek or the Rosé De Gambrinus. The qualities that cause the taste score to suffer increase the score for drinkability though."
"The beer pours a hazy gold color with a thin white head that quickly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a light pale and wheat malt scent along with a wickedly tart yeast aroma; very nice. I'm not picking up any oak barrel scents. The taste is good. It has a light malt flavor that seems a bit weak and watery. It goes down easy and finishes highly tart and fruity. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a medium bodied beer with less than adequate carbonation. This is a good tasting beer, but it lacks mouthfeel and a real malt presence."
"One of the best unscrewed-with beers out there. I really appreciate what Cantillon accomplished with this brew. A very tart, sour smelling and tasting brew woven into a lightly hazed, canary yellow colored, thinly laced liquid. No head retention and no carbonation to speak of. It's perfect. Unblended and unadulterated goodness. Has a light citrus (lemon and limes) flavor with granny-smith apple and a light berry flavor. Mildly vineous and woodsy. Lightly musky and powdery. Intense sourness quickly gives way to an ultra clean, crisp feel. Lightly astringent and a tad grainy (to be expected). Flavors are fleeting and the body finishes abruptly. The perfet summertime thirst quincher. Ideal to style."
"750mL bottle poured into a snifter. It pours a slightly hazy medium orange color with almost no head. There's no lacing at all, the kind of appearance you'd expect from an unblended lambic. The smell is funktastic. Lots of sour and tart aromas. Nothing much else to it, yet nothing else is needed. It's intoxicating. The taste is nice and funky up front. Lots of that classic Cantillon musty flavors. It's too bad though, because the flavor drops off rather quickly. Where the hell did all the flavor go? The mouthfeel is a little weak and watery, but again, that's expected from this style. The drinkabiliy is wonderful though, and non-lambic lovers could easily handle this one."
"Personally, I'd prefer a gueze or a framboise. Without the carbonation the tartness can be very overpowering. But all in all, this is a wholly unique brew, and I highly recommend it."
"This was a unique experience, this is my first beer with almost no carbonation. I liked it. I prefer Cantillon Gueuze or Vignerrone, but this is a very worthy, complex and funky lambic."
"Follow-up comment (3/27/6) - I had very mild heartburn/acid indigestion when I drank this beer on the review date. A few days later I had major heartburn when trying the 2003-cork fou fonne, where I actually noted it in the review. Yesterday I had another 2005-cork grand cru and noted the same mild heartburn sensation. I have had nearly all of cantillon's products over a number of years and these two are the only times I have felt this, and I still drink other products from them regularly. Not sure if this is a products of a particularly strong lambic year (2002 maybe?), or some other specific attribute. I had older versions of grand cru in the past with nary a symptom."
"*Edit* I have since bumped up the scores for this beer as I have grown to LOVE sour beers. These adjustments are based on my assumption that, should I be fortunate enough to get my hands on this beer again, I can't help but think I'd be a lot more into it."
"Drinkability: not bad, almost wine like. One of these is enjoyable every now and then if you are in the mood, but this is not a beer I can have every night."
"A friend brought this back while on a business trip. We drank it on New Years Eve while counting down to midnight. Another friend had been raving about Cantillon for months and I was glad to finally get to taste one of their beers. We poured it into flute glasses and it basically had no head and very little visible carbonation. Aroma was sour and earthy and the taste was about the same with a little fruitiness. Finish was very dry and tart. I have not had the opportunity to have very many true lambic style beers, but I certainly liked this one. Despite some rude comments from some non beer drinkers in the room regarding the smell and taste, we both found the beer to very drinkable and enjoyable. It would probably go very well with some strong cheeses and fruit. Hopefully I'll have the opportunity to try more of their beers."
" The pour is totally still, save for the few bubbles resulting from the rough pour. Looking straight down at the beer, there appears to be an oil slick on top. With this beer, the smell and the taste are the same. Sour, funky, barnyard, hay, and fresh dirt. Kind of tart. Mouthfeel is good, drinkability is great with the surf and turf. If paired with just the lobster tail, it wouldn't go so well. The key is the filet, seared on each side and finished in the oven. Mmm."
"D: An interesting, solidly produced beer. The tartness and acidity make it a strong choice for the special ""once in a while"" brew, something worth revisiting from time to time. I can imagine this being excellent with a meal to lessen the ""tartness apathy"" it instills after at time."
"Taste: It's smoother than some of the other Cantillons I've had the previlege to sample in the past, it's not as astringent and mouth-puckering as I would like, but still has a nice refreshing acidity."
"D- This is very smooth and doesn't have a lot of flavors from the barnyard. The tartness and crisp refreshing taste makes this really refreshing. I guess the age has really made this smooth."
"What a drinker! Pristinely clear gold-orange, tinny in tone but shiny as all get out. Light head on top gets supported by plenty of tight carbonation. Scents are all layers of tartness, bretty spices and herbs, and a malt ravaged by all types of things I don't attempt to understand. Exceptionally clean clear flavor, just exploding with balanced tart and sour with the raw funk of nature. Tons of slick malts behind it all with pils, kilned sweetness, and wheat twisted by wild yeast. Carbonation is a dream, sprite yet soft, an amazing effect and aids the flavor tons. Slick and complex. Damn, like the Brueghel painting I could drink this by the tankard on a Fall night. Can we get more unblended lambics, please? A fascinating experience as the lack of barrel blending makes a for a clear and singular flavor profile."
"2003. Pours an orange color with no carbonation and no head. Aroma has a lot of sour notes along with some fruity hints. The flavor is extremely smooth - I believe this has something to do with the lack of carbonation. Flows really well on the palate. Lots of sour flavors in there and some fruits that I can't pick out because of the sourness. The mouthfeel seems extremely thin, but this could be caused by the lack of carbonation. If you like sour beers, this one is a good one."
"Pours a light copper color with very nice clarity. Light chunk fell into the glass before I could stop it. A very nice looking brew. No bubbles are present, suggesting a still beer. The nose is divine. Acrid sour and tart, but not offensive at all. Lemony and funky acidic. I dig it a lot. Flavor is very well balanced and unoffensive. I get a lemon start to the beer before swallowing. After swallowing, the light sourness and acidic nature hits, but nowhere near as strong as others I've had. The sourness does not linger at all,moving to a slightly sweet finish. The feel is moderate with no carbonation. Slightly sticky spit hangs on my tongue, but not too much. Incredibly drinkable beer. I really enjoy it. Its a toned down gueuze that makes the drinking very easy."
"I guess that was the only bad incident, but the rest of the beer I did not enjoy because it seems to me that it's too much like their other beers. the sour smell was a clear upfront indicator, I could've been drinking any other Cantillon Lambic here. Side-by-sidedness would not help. Plus, it wasn't too carbonated either. and the saltyness I'd felt before was still there."
"Mellowed out cellared bottle.Just a mellow cantillon sounress and oak flavour, but well done on that account. Went well went varied with a doppleback and a mead. Cloudy yellow with no lace. Medium mouthfeel with acid that was tolerable. tart, dry finish."
"Hell Yes!! This is a benchmark offering and a very rare chance to get to try and understand a traditional 3 year old lambic. Try it  Love it."
"remarkably drinkable for such a gnarly style, mostly due to the proper temperature and nice carbonation. bartended wanted to puke when i ordered it, i think he steers people off it."
"Cork says bottled in 2004. Pours a glowing hazy straw color with absolutely no head. There is coating of fine bubbles all around the inside of the glass. Very tart flavor almost like lemon juice, but not quite as puckering. This flavor is balanced by a cider flavor as the beer warms. Mouthfeel is light, and a bit watery. There is lemon in the aroma, but it is much more subdued and joined by a dash of spring meadow (dandelions and grass?). Different, but not quite as funky as I'd expected. Definitely not bad, but a bit of an acquired taste."
"2004 edition. Wow, these are interesting beers. Pours a vibrant light orange color, zero head, and apparently zero carbonation. But even before I poured it, as I let it warm up a tad from being in the fridge, I could smell it from the bottle a few feet away. Once it's in my awesome Schlitz snifter the fragrance is even more pronounced. Major funk, dirt, spices, lemmon rind... burns the ol nose hairs if you take a huge sniff. First sip; the taste is much more subtle than I was expecting. Much less intense or sour than their gueuze, which at first threw me off. However, I think since your tastebuds aren't attacked there's more room for unique flavors to present themselves. Wow there's a lot more here than I originally thought. There's a real wet hay taste to it, mixed with freshly cut grass. Also, lemon juice and citrus, along with some spice (maybe even a hop or two thrown in there). I'm also getting some distinct saltwater action, like taking a gulp of the ocean. Everything hits you again in the aftertaste, which lingers. Incredibly light and smooth mouthfeel. A really interesting beer, one you could taste again and again and find new and challenging things."
"This was my first sample of a Cantillon, and I could see where a couple of these would make you want to get up and boogie; must try more by these folks."
"Ut vivat, crescat, floreat!"
"Drinkability and Overall: This is a very unique beer, different from any other lambic I've had. It still has the lambic qualities but without the fruit focus. According to the back, this is the onlytru unblended lambic you can find. Really? Well, at least it's a good one."
"Had this on tap last evening. The brew was poured to a cloudy brass color with no head what so ever. The smell was tart, as my wife said it reminded her of sour patch candy, also notices earthy like aroma. The taste was quite sour and also had wine like highlights. As the brew warms the tartness comes out more and more. Also notice what I believe is a oak like taste that seems to complement it quite nicely. Over all it was a good brew, just not my cup of tea. Would try it again, but not regularly."
"Poured from a corked 750 ml bottle. I was a little worried because the side of the bottle was sticky, and the cork crumbled when I open it, but everything turned out fine. This beer pours out a hazy orange with a great deal of floaties. No head at all. The aroma is sour, typical lambic. Not quite as funky as some, but the funk is still there. Sour grapes and lemon. Acid burns the throat. This unblended lambic is not as complex as some gueuzes. No carbonation, but it's still easy to drink, even with the mouth puckering. A little thin, but very flavorful. Not the best from Cantillon, but a very good beer."
"A wonderful treat. Very complex and satisfying."
"Drinkability- I'll pass on this one. It was the cheapest of the Cantillon line when I bought it 6 months ago at about $12. Hopefully my next try will be better. Not even giving up on them yet."
"Cloudy golden yellow, very hazy, no head. Sweet honey nose with strong brett profile. Kiwi, lemon, grapefruit and mostly pineapple make for a dynamic fruit salad. Horsey funk, salt, ink, lactic and big rubber tones make up for funk lovers. I couldnt dig the flavor so much, plastic and rubber are a bit too dominant. Im not one to complain about crap, leather and the likes, but I find no interest in plastic... Astringent and citric grapefruit/pineapple juice. Still body, juicy and funky. I expected more from my first unblended lambic experience.."
"Out of a capped and corked 750ml split with a friend. It pours out very mildly carbonated with no real head to speak of, a few bubbles cling to the insides of the glass at most. The body is thick with haze and is an orangish shade of amber. The nose is alive with damp hay, musty oak and sour funky aromas. Sipping this brew is almost a shock at first and even when you're used to it will still come back and slap your tongue around a little bit. Initially a bit astringent, mid-palate the funky flavors of damp earth and hay appear alongside musty oak and then intertwine and are eventually eclipsed by face-caving tartness that lasts through the finish where it is met a with the flavors of grapeskin. I can't even really describe everything that goes on in this beer but it is a wonderfully complex experience."
"Upon it disembarking the 750ml green bottle resides in the glass a beclouded straw color with a smallish off white head and the resultant lace a thin but sealing sheet. Nose is tart, with hints of sour apples, citrus like in its crispness; start is dry and sour with the top light. Finish continues the devastatingly tartness, dry as a bleached desert bone, and the aftertaste lingers long, a true lambic lovers brew that you will love or hate, I love it, but beware its not meant for everyone even if you like most lambics"
"Cheers..."
"What a complex yet well balanced beer. I really like it but I think I like the gueuze better. Cheers to Cantillon for keeping the tradition alive and well! FYI...Vintage 2003. I guess I couldn't wait any longer."
"Pours out a strawish color with little to no head. Tastes big and sour just as one would expect a true lambic. Cantillon keeps putting out some of the best lambic in the world and this Grand Cru Broucsella is no exception. But you either like the beast or you don't. If you do like the sourpuss lambic, you won't lose with this one."
"This lambic is everything and more of what it is trying to be. The gods blessed this barrel well. Phenomenal."
"Initially sharply acidic. Held on the back of the tongue, it's just like lemon juice that you buy in a bottle. Slightly sweet when held on the front of the tongue, with earthy mushroom forming somewhere deeply hidden. Jaw-clenching sourness when rolled to the sides, with explosive crab apple and drawing tannins. Very, very dry in the finish, with acidic lingerings long, long after the swallow."
"This lambic poured a cloudy, golden color with thin white foam that settled. The smell was a tart, musty, gueuze-like aroma. The taste was sharp and tart with some musty and vinous qualities. Some tanins could be tasted in the astringent finish. The mouthfeel was sharp and tart and dry. The body was medium with moderate carbonation. The mouthfeel had a sublime quality and the dryness and flavor lingered nicely. This was a very nice lambic."
"Had this on tap at Redbones...pour was a cloudy apricot color. Aroma was of sweet sweatsocks. I found the taste sweet to start, but sort of hit a tannic, or leathery wall...intriguing. The beer became a bit more tart as it warmed up, with horseblanket notes coming on strong towards the end. A beer I need to do more 'research' on, definitley not for the faint of beer palate."
"A relentless masterpiece, this Bruocsella 1900 Grand Cru, a bold, yet benevolent fellow. My mouth won't know quite what to do with itself when the bottle is gone."
"Big thanks, Bighuge"
"I think I could drink this from time to time. I'd like to explore the rest of the Cantillon line."
"Being an obsessive Cantillon fan, I couldn't pass this brew up when I first came across it. It comes in a capped and corked 750ml bottle, with a note from the brewer on the back stating that this is the only unblended lambic available. Pours a slightly cloudy golden color with no head - this beer is as close to uncarbonated as possible. The nose is full of oakey, earthy notes, with just a hint of the sourness to come. Taste is as sour as can be, with some barnyard notes and a firm oak backing. The body is light, and the acidity makes the beer jump off the palette and leaves you ready for more. An amazing, unique brew, although I must admit the traditional blended geueze is a little more my style."
"Poured a clear golden yellow, no head. Smell is of oak, musty barnyards, sour vinegar, and an almost ""clean"" scent that I can't quite place. The taste is fantastic. Massive depth. The oakiness smooths the entire range of flavors and unites them into one unified tongue demolishing front. Lactic and acetic notes predominate and the finish smoothes over with a rich tannin quality like a dry white wine. The mouthfeel is interesting, but I think I'm just not used to beers with purposefully no carbonation. It is a cascading array of flavors and tastes. Truly an exceptional beer."
"After describing the unadulterated lambic, I enjoyed the rest of it with stinky mushroomy/earthy French cheese smeared on slices of French baguette....excellent!"
"Underneath nary a head (bubbly and white) sits an inviting golden liquid of pure unblended real lambic. Aroma is of wool, acetic acid, lemon and hay, must, lime, dew and a slight funky barnyard character as well. The carbonation is very low. Almost negligible. The flavors of this tart beer are surprisingly refreshing. The acidic nature offers a bit of a bite, but the flavors blend together nicely. Lemongrass, vinegar, funky barnyard stuff, aged hops, army blanket... And bone dry. And that's an understatement. Yeah, this is lambic. And a good one at that."
"Refreshing in an unparalleled fashion, this is the only unblended straight lambic I've had the pleasure of sampling in bottled form. Truly remarkable, Grand Cru actually paired quite well with baked escolar in a mango-chardonnay marinade. The acidity of the lambic balanced out the oiliness of the fish and the sweetness and tanginess of the marinade. This is one fantastic beer, aged for almost two years in the bottle. It could go much longer, and for some folks' tastes, probably should. This will no doubt frighten the unenlightened."
"Bottled 2003 after being aged in an oak barrel for three years. Appearance: After a vigorous pour forms with thin large bubles and quickly fades away leaves behind an apple juice looking nectar. Aroma: So much exubrance of crazy aromas that probably shouldn't be in a beer, however this is a lambic. Tones of barnyard funk, acidic leathery qualities, woody finish fromt the oak barrel aging is evident, extreme in my book for being so different and traditional to this ancient craft. Taste: More stand offish when it comes to sourness, yes it is extremely sour but more mellow than other Cantillon products I sampled aggressive tartness blended with an oak flavor and tons of wild flavors barnyard in nature is how most describe this stuff. Mouthfeel: Medium body coats the palate with a dry finish, completely unique and hard to describe. Drinkability: Wow, not me I can't sit here and sip on it like a lemonade challenges my palate with many alien tones, but I see why this artform is so highly regarded I have a great respect for it."
"This is a great (and one of the few) examples of a traditional Lambic. This beer is one of the few chances for most to sample an unblended Lambic, and for this alone Cantillon is to be applauded. I do like this beer quite a bit. A bit of warning though, these flat bottles of Lambic need to be served warmer than usual, about 60*F (15*C), as I find uncarbonated Lambic needs to be a bit warmer than usual in order to fully express it's charms."
"Corked and capped 750 ml bottle bottled 2003. Poured a golden color with light amber highlights. No head, no real carbonation to speak of at all. Barnyardy, old gym sock, malt vinegar, champagne like aromas. Sour and acidic, quite lactic tasting. Astringent with each sip. Beautiful beer, I'd expected some carbonation, but I coped with it."
"Wonderful silky bottle-conditioned mouthfeel. Outstanding drinkability, and one of the most accessible Cantillons. A great dinner companion."
"750ml capped and corked bottle...2001 vintage: This is a dark golden colour with a huge head of fluffy white bubbles. The aromas are of a-typical gueuze-like tartness, and funky stuff, but this brew is much more subdued than the afforementioned gueuze. The taste is quite tart and funky with some lovely sweet and sour notes, and the undeniably amazing complexity of all of this breweries beers. The mouthfeel is sharp, astringent, and not as carbonated as their gueuze and the drinkability is amazing! World class stuff!!!"
"I selected this beer as a celebration of the end of the semester, as well as a toast for good luck for tomorrow's GRE. I can see why someone said this is a love or hate beer...though one glass is a fantastic and complex experience, this would take quite a robust soul to session with! Still, a nice celebration beer, and certainly one I'd save for other rare occasions in the future!"
"Drinkability  You will love or hate this bottle. Either way, it is very complex. The depths of the flavors are beyond reproach."
"This particular bottle poured completely flat -- not a bubble to be seen -- ahh well, you take your chances with these lambics, I suppose. Golden orange in color, with a slightly tart aroma that strikes one first as mostly tart, but then develops a tropical fruit like sweetness. The flavor, too, is tart and fruity, with a sweet mid-palateness and a re-assertive tartness to the finish. Pretty good as-is, but I'd love to see a better sample."
"The bottle reviewed was bottled in 1999. The head is not particularly attractive for this kind of beer, with an orange colour. The smell is horse sweat, aged leather (!). It's a flat lambic, quite quiet, with maybe a little lack of aggressiveness and naughtiness... It is advisable as an introduction to lambic."
"Extremely fizzy from the start leaving a dense head of fine bubbles. Reddish gold in color. Horsey, tangy and slight metallicy twang hit the nose. Sweetness greats the front of the tongue and eventually gives was to a tangy, almost metallic, finish. More balanced towards the sweet side for a lambic, but not too sweet for the style. Not as dry as other examples of the style."
"Body is dull medium-light amber. The head forms easily and fades easily. The aroma is mulch or the loam in a forest, hint of horse blanket and ripe citrus or peach. The flavor: Basalmic vinegar and cotton candy (minus the sweetness). Salt and really thin, sour kumquats or oranges that aren't quite ripe yet, a little orange peel as well. A bit bitter in the finish. Is tart, but not as harshly tart as the Hanssens Oude Gueuze I had a few days ago. I didn't care for it to start with, but the more you drink, the easier it gets."
"Pretty wierd stuff. No head whatsoever, murky light brown to slight orange appearance, very balsamic, tart nose. It attacks your tongue with brutal sourness!!!! Amazingly mouth puckering, veeeery sour. Quite earthy in aroma and taste, and extremely dry, which i like. This was one of those beers that you don't know if you truly love or hate, and thats how it got me."
