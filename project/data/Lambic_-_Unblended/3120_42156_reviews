"Bottle courtesy of johndoe8. Served in a mini snifter. Pours a clear, still golden color with no head or lacing. Nose has a bit of acetone along with some lactic acidity. A bit of a stone fruit character in the background, though not all that much. Still with a strange acidity; not my favorite, though not a terrible first effort. Iâ€™d like to see if they can develop a program and improve on this."
"I really wanted to like this beer but the solvency of it overwhelmed any nice character it might have had, there are bright spots in the beer like the dry finish with a mild oakiness and tartness but the forward and midpalate are dominated by the acetone flavor that is just too hard to drink. I can't recommend this beer."
"The beer is hazy and golden hued with virtually no head. The aroma offers some nail polish, barrels, citrus. Smells eh... The flavor and feel both bring a sharp, harsh, palate attacking acetic character. Virtually no carbonation with a lingering sharpness. Some vinegar as well. maybe not as appalling as I described, but I won't be having this again.."

"Came out to alpine for the beer week releases, didn't get anything. Luckily this was on tap. Into tulip, poured a golden, hazy hay color much like all the ipas. No head, very little carb bubbles. Nose is musty, acidic bite, tartness. Taste is tart, sharp and sssliightly acidic. A bit dry as well. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, but it goes well with the flavor profile. Not much carb out of this one, but small bubbles spark up when it hits the tongue. Very thankful to have tried this. Worth the journey!"
"D-Easy."
"D-Is this from southern California or Belgium? Excellent stuff that is so tasty yet not overdone. A truly outstanding job for an American lambic."
"Overall, this was a pretty solid Lambic. Fruit, oak, and funk were in well balanced abundance, with my only gripe being just a touch too much souring character in the back, which inhibited the drinkibility a bit for me."
"Mouthfeel has a thin body with very mellow carbonation that is just enough to be noticeable. This one is a sipper due to the depth of the acidic sourness. I was glad I shared this bottle as even a 375ml might be too much for one person. Thanks to sfoley333 for the opportunity to try this."
"Notes from 9/26/08"
"I have sat on this one since the release earlier this year. Finally opened a bottle tonight and poured into my Delirium Tremens snifter. Pours a clear golden yellow color with a slight orange hue. No head even with aggresive pouring to lure one out. Smell is mixture of sour orchaid fruits intertwine with acetic acid, brett( more cheese and not barnyard), and oak. Taste is sour lemon tartness with a green apple profile. Again there is the vingear present but not as sour as the unblended lambic style with a nice balance between sweet and sour not as dry as lot of sour beers. Uncarbonated and while apprioate for the style(unblend lambics should be uncarbonated) I really believe that overall it would of been better off with a low to medium carbonation level considering the mild to slight intense sour level(and since its made in Alpine and not Belgium but respect Pat authenticity in the style). A very drinkable lambic reproduction on par with Cantillon Grand Cru Bruocsella but diffently not for beginners to sour style beers."
"Not near as good as their Chez in my opinion, overly tarty for my palate and I almost choked after a few different sips, still a good lambic indeed though, just glad I got to try this rare treat because there was not much of it to go around, it sold out at Alpine pretty quickly from what I understand, would like to drink it again and compare various bottles, recommended if you can still find one"
"D: A nice level of drinkablity. With most lambics I have no desire to drink more than one, but as my glass empties (partially my fault) I find myself wanting to open another Briscoe."
