"O- While I would certainly take a Tilquin over this any day, it's quite good for what it is.  Not really worth the price asked IMO, but I'm glad I got to try it all the same."

"Has a low carbonation, which leads to a fruity beginning in which mandarin, oak and lemon peel stand out, accompanied with slightly lactic notes. Acidity get more intense, the longer it stays on the palate, leading to a very sour overall impression. Still, it is very enjoyable due to barley malt and dough yeast, keeping the beer in balance. Lemony fruitiness stays on the palate with a dry sourness, leading to an even dryer finish. Easy drinkable and complex at the same time."

"Pours an opaque light orange/yellow color with a small head which quickly fades. Minimal lacing. Aroma is lemon, citrius, and apricot with grass and earthy tones. Aroma gains complexity as the beer warms. Taste is sour with light carbonation. Not much alcohol present and a touch on the watery side. The bitterness lingers on finish. Very smooth and light overall with a nice sour kick that's not overpowering. Purchased for $40, a bit steep but enjoyable nevertheless. One of my favorite beers at the moment."

"Not bad, pretty interesting with a big classic funky character."
"A decent lambic, rougher than the usual blended.  To my taste, not worth the price."
"Light and fruity. Not as funk as I had hoped. Especially for the $."

"hazy golden orange, no carb, salty, oily, lightly bitter.  Not really my thing."

"Outstanding beer. But very expensive. Not sure I would buy it again at $35."

"Picked this up from the De Cam Brewery. Bottled Jan 2009. Mostly clear orange-yellow pour with an immediately fading head and almost no lacing. The nose is amazing with a huge musty funk and sharp tartness along with hints of oak, sour lemon, and barnyard. The taste follows suit with sharp, almost cheesy notes initially along with hints of barnyard, tart lemon, earthy funk, and oak. The mouthfeel is smoothly sour with very little carbonation and a tart, puckering, oaky finish. Overall, an amazingly flavorful and hugely drinkable Lambic. Highly recommended!"

"A beer that on one hand begs to be sipped and savored for days, and on the other, that is so refreshing and complex and simply drinkable that you wish you could drink it by the carafe."

"Poured a pale golden orange body with minimal head and lace. The aroma is typical tart/sour with a touch of acidity as well as wood/oak. Brew is more of the same as the beer is smooth and easy to drink as it comprised mostly of a sharp, acidic sour tartness but it comes across less sour apple/cherry and more sour/tart tropical fruit. In other words, for as sour as this beer is there is a bit of both oaky woodiness and sweet fruit notes to this beer, and it's not just sour but also a touch of funkiness. These are the sours I like b/c it's more complex than drinking some highly carbonated sour juice that some beers of this style are like."
"Overall: My first De Cam beer. This easily exceeded my expectations. What a nice lambic! It reminds me of a gueuze that is slight heavier than most gueuze. Complex, balanced, with a very nice mouthfeel. A must try for every sour beer fan!"

"Large format corn and caged bottle from Tipples. Bottled 2/2012, drank on 2/23/2014. Pours perfectly clear golden orange with no head at all. Nuthin, but I expected that. Aroma of sour vinegar, sweet sugars, a tiny hint of mint. Smells very pleasant. Flavor is sour but not puckeringly so, sweet with some peachy influence, a bit of vinegar, fermented apples maybe, and a bit of spearmint in the back. Completely flat, but I was told to expect this. Honestly I think the flatness takes a bit away from the brew. Slightly dry finish. Mouthfeel is medium, but somewhat heavy for the lambic style that usually comes off extra dry and light to me. I like the flavors but the lack of carbonation isn't my thing. More like drinking a dry white wine than a beer. For $40+ I'd rather have a couple Fou Fones, or one of many other things. Glad I got to try it though, and get my Unblended Lambic tick."
"Overall: Really good lambic. Hugely funky with lots of character. I can't help but feel like some carbonation would have made it better, even though I understand it's intended to be still. Overall, I'd say it's worth the high price tag."

"O: Great drinkability. Very delicate Lambic. Excellent stuff"

"One of the best straight lambics I've had, though it is the oldest I've had as well. Definitely compares to Drie Fonteinen and Cantillon."

"Medium bodied with delicate carbonation and a nice balance of lactic funk, acetic acid, oak barrel and sweet fruit.  Tart and puckering with the perfect amount of sourness.  Great oak barrel and lactic/cheesy funk flavors along with lingering acetic acid that's complimented by light fruit and zesty citrus.  Not solvent-like, harsh or overly acidic with strawberry and orange zest sweetness countering the sour funk.  Mouthfeel is incredible with the perfect amount of acetic qulaity that leaves me thirsting for more.  Incredibly complex yet insanely drinkable. Excellent!  "
"Overall: A really nice lambic - up there with the best"

"Overall - These beers always make me crave a full on gueuze. It's a teaser."
""
"Overall. Great stuff here. Quality is up with the best making 3F, De Cam, and Cantillon the best of the best when it comes to gueuze ...like any beer geek didn't know that already, it's just nice to try this one and confirm it for myself. Thanks again Jeff!!"
"O: This was a really sneaky hit for the night. Even though it was flat it was still deliciously complex. I wish I had another."

"O- I really enjoyed this beer, my first from De Cam. This is a really well-made, delicious beer that has aged very nicely, I would love to drink this again."
""
"Overall, this was a nice lambic. Pretty easy to drink, but one glass was enough."

"OVERALL: A solid lambic that I was glad to try. Lots of good tart, fruity elements with just a touch of acidity to give it the kick it needs. Pretty impressed with De Cam so far, so hopefully this trend continues. Recommended."

"O: This smells great, but is tasting very young and a bit too watery."
"A bright golden orange, near amber color with a thin yellowish cap made up of various sized bubbles. The nose is of spoiled fruits and musty, old wood. Some notes of aged cheese, saddle leather, wet hay, and citrus fruits. Amazingly musty/funky. On the palate, fruity notes seem to emerge up front before a rush of barn, old wood, salt, cheese, and sweaty saddle leather. A good sized dose of lacto and vinegar in the finish. Good and sour. Medium body, dry and tart in the finish. Low carbonation. This is a pretty amazing unblended lambic. A good amount of wood comes through in the finished product, I wasn't quite expecting that, but it really adds this wild dimension. Sour and funky in all the right spots."
""
"Mustard brown colored with a rapidly disappearing fizzy head. Loads of funk but limited acidity in the aroma. Very welcoming tartness with notes of hay, must and some phenolic bitterness at the end. Very lactic. Dry and sharp mouthfeel. Very good."
"Very approachable and enjoyable moderately sour beer. Doesn't have quite the intenseness of a 3F or Cantillon, but still pleasant. My only nitpick is the vinegar was a little strong at times."
""
"Pours a slightly murky honey yellow with a slightly foamy tan head that settles to dots of lace on top of the beer. No lacing on the glass on the drink down. Smell is sour, tart, funky with some woody and acidic aromas. Taste is much the same with a woody finish. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer but I think it smells better than it tastes."
"O - A world class beer. Its just held up so well over the nearly ten years its been in a bottle. Really complex and layered, yet approachable and drinkable. Certainly worth the wait."
""
"Bottled January 2009. Mmm. Juicier and smoother than a gueuze but with all the same notes. There isn't that rough bite or sour jaw-clenching tang. The aroma holds the funky wild barrel character and the flavor is almost a touch juicy. There's nothing new in this beer, it's just a very well built lambic that smoothed with time to showcase the barnyard and farmhouse notes is a more gentle format. Very cool beer. You could use it as an intro to lambics or just enjoy on a summer afternoon."
"O: A great example of an unblended lambic being better than most geuezes. Simply fantastic."
"Overall: Pretty nice lambic. We had a 2003 shortly after and aged had improved it."
"Overall - Overall an alright beer."
"1999 vintage. Still pour into in de verzekering tegen de grotto dorst lambic/gueuze glass. Hazy, dark gold body. Aroma of intense vinegar, sour acid, rotted green apple. Taste follows suit. Dry finish, less vinegar/acid aftertaste than expected.  Graceful aging. The kind of beer that makes you want to build a cellar. "

"Overall this is by far the best example of an unblended lambic I have ever had, not too puckering or overly tart or unpleasant in any manor. Just really complex with many different light flavors of hay, wet oak, must, but all balanced quite well together. Definitely recommended and worth seeking out for fans of the style."
""
""
"O: Very impressed with this now 8-9 year old beer, I can see why these things age with grace. Lots of flavors, and an intense sourness, that isn't harshly acidic. A very fine, yet very expensive beer."
""
""
"O: have to say it was one of the best lambics I've ever had and was drinking fabulous, definitely wish I could get my hands of more of this brew."
""
""
"Flavor of an umblended perfect. Great body, great sticky flavors. Some white grape ad kind. Tannin bitters and oak bittering. Phenomenal."
""
"Light bodied, lightish carbonation, nice mouthfeel. So damn drinkable. This is a crazy good and, at the same time, scary brew. Well worth the time and trouble to seek out."
""
""
""
"O: Great flavors, low acidity, very dry, and super easy to drink. A few more bubbles and this would have been perfect. Thanks again for sharing, Chris."
""
"A real under-the-radar lambic. Smells great and is really funky, sour, and developed overall. Lack of carbonation is a plus for me in this style. Worth the money."
""
""
""
"Feel is pretty light, this thing while being unblended, still has a lively crisp feel to it. The sour just whisks around the mouth, causing sweet damage. A whole bottle of this, you betcha. If I found a bottle if this now after the street date, I would not hesitate."

"O: At 5%, this drinks WAY too fast. It might be the most expensive beer I’ve drank in terms of how long it lasted. I can’t get enough of that FUNKY, yeasty tartness and general Belgian Lambic aroma. So good. De Cam knows his shit. 4.5"
"Right before the Tap & Table closed they were doing a beer of the week special. The description they had on this beer sounded like it would be pretty amazing. So I bit the bullet and bought a bottle to bring home with me. The following day I had gone to a friends place and we split the bottle together. Popped the cork out and gave it a pour, the hazy orange yellow liquid didn't produce much head or lacing. The smell was filling our noses before we even had put the glasses to our faces. The funky smell was very prominent, the deeper you breathe this one in the more aromas that come out. It had a really interesting sour grapefruit aroma in there mixed with earth and wood. The flavor of this beer is acidic at first, tart citrus flavors like grapefruits and some apple in there too. The taste then fades into a much smoother earth flavor. The mouthfeel is almost medium bodied. Overall I found this beer to be pretty good for it's style, I can't see myself ever buying it again because of the cost. I don't enjoy this style enough to drop almost $30 on one bottle. However if you like the style and you have the money do yourself the favor and try this, it's impressive."
"Shared this one with my doppelganger by the pool as a part of my birthday weekend! Served from bottle into a Stone nonic. Poured yellow-orange with a half finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, cherry, and funk. The flavor was of sweeet malt, cherry, funk, and earth. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. The cherry aspect on this one was quite nice and enjoyable with the funkiness going on in it. This one was quite easy drinking with the earthy aspect. Glad I got to share this one with a few others as well as this was a nice brew all-around."
"overall loved it,"
"Overall, a great musty raw lambic with citrus and funky undertones. I really liked it. A great unblended oude lambic, but not affordable or abundant enough to drink frequently."
"This is the 2000 batch bottled in 2003 that came to the US earlier this year. Amber orange color with actual carbonation, it isn't still. Aroma is funky lambic and a bit of must. Flavor is sour lambic but nothing mind-blowing. I've had bottles of Cantillon bruocsella that were better and some that were worse. This was definitely not worth the $32 I spent and the De Cam gueuze is better."
"This is a fantastic beer and recommended to anyone enjoying lambics or sours."
"Overall: Beautiful lambic that aged gracefully!"
"O: Nice to have a oude lambiek available in bottle form."
"This is right up my alley. Glad to have gotten a chance to try this."
"This one is pretty still on the feel; as would be expected from an unblended. Overall, this one is though to beat. Really unique and one I'd love to have more of."
"This is a very quite funk train, rather mild horse blanket, mildly acidic on the finish. Sour yes, lip puckering no. A distinct ashy and leathery quality is dicernable. Reminds me of a fine washed rind cheese. This is a fantastic well balanced effort. I am very happy to have shared this with good friends."
"Light and enjoyable, with some absolutely unreal complexity. Phenomenal on all levels...from the flavors, to the feel, to the aroma. Nothing in this beer underperforms the world class lambic that it is. I need to pick up some of the 03 to see how they compare."
"The palate opens intensely sour with grapefruit peel, lemon peel, very briny and salty. Intensely funky, this is quite acidic but still doesn't overwhelm the palate. Salty, sulfury and mineraly, the stinky cheese character is complex. Tannic and drying on the finish, there's also a little juicy, lemony character, keeping things fresh. Medium-light in body with light carbonation, the mouthfeel is sublime. Probably the best unblended lambic I've had"
"Notes: Disappointed by this. At first I thought the overt musty character indicated a flaw, but it's consistent with most reviewers' notes. Not a fan of the big must, though."
"Opinion: I must say that the low carbonation in this beer really hurt it, and I guess I never really realized how dependent this style is on having high carbonation. All of the Lambic elements are there, so I would personally just write this one off to a failing cork and would definitely try this beer again in hopes of getting one that was a little more lively. I have never had a review that was this mixed, but I really think that this is a really good beer and that this particular bottle just lost some fizz. I would try it if you have the chance and you like this style. The bottle you get may be more carbonated."
"D: Not as sharp and sour as I had hoped but tasty and very drinkable. Glad I had a chance to try this one."
"A fantastic brew."
"Pours a hazy orange-ish color with a small off white head. In the aroma, tart and oaky, white grape fruitiness and somewhat dry. In the taste, dry and tart white grape, and a nice oaky flavor, quite clean and full. A smooth and sour medium to light bodied mouthfeel, with a dry oak and hints of tart fruit in the aftertaste. Whats not to love here, tart and oaky, clean and fantastic."
"D - A very nice brew with good complexity and drinkability for it's biting sourness."
"Thanks to Scott for the chance to try this one. Pours a straw color with a nice beige head. Nose has a great sour presence, but is well balanced. Some earthy funk in there as well. Taste also has a nice amount of tartness. Crisp and refreshing yet soemwhat full body. Great stuff. Will have to pick a couple up for the cellar."
"Beer is thin and mildly carbonated on the palate, the lead off is a little weak but that's ok because it's quite tart on the backend of the beer. Puckering would be a good way to describe it. There is a citric style sourness to it followed by some milder lactic smoothness. Acetic is minimal. The beer overall is quite good. I'm glad I opened it. Very enjoyable."
"This beer appears very hazy and orange hued, with virtually no head whatsoever. It looks almost completely uncarbonated. The aroma is great, with notes of hay earth, tart citrus, straw. The beer is very enjoyable, with a dry finish. Oude Lambiek De Cam has enough tartness to cause your cheeks to pucker after each sip. This brew is a solid example of an unblended lambic, and a beer I would certainly drink again."
"(D)- A fantastic lambic. The age has obviously helped and its lack of carbonation really puts the smooth, yet mellow funk and acidic sour fruits in full view. I could easily have drunk this whole bottle if I felt like it."
"Overall this beer is a fantastic, world class treat that is worth the price tag in my opinion. The bottle works well split 4 ways."
"D- I could drink one of these a night, easy."
"D- im not sure how i would feel if i dropped the $30 on this one. glad i got to try it. maybe it could use more time to become something i would really enjoy? right now, i would probably pass on another glass of this and let someone that really loves it have it."
"D- Light on the palette with a low abv, nothing is too harsh here,harmonizes perfectly."
"D: I am extremely glad I picked this up. I will have no trouble finishing off this bottle on my own. Cheers!"
"Drinkability: Neither too acidic nor too funky. A good balance of the two. Great beer."
"Drinkability: I seemed to enjoy this one much more than everyone and look forward to trying it again."
"Certainly an interesting example of the style that is more authentic than most. Definitely a beer that you don't want to drink too much of at once."
"this is delicious, one of the best unblended lambics i have had."
"2013 batch: 3.7 ...not nearly as good as the 2009. A bit muted and on the bitter side. Feels a little bland as well, barely tart and not really sour. Muted grapefruit pith at room temperature. Okay, but would save my money next time."
"Very good. Doesn't have enough complexity to put it in Girardin territory, but it still very good. Surprisingly understated and approachable."
"mind blown. will go on record as stating this to be the best lambic i've had to date. simply amazing and delicious. 2003 vintage. Brewed in 2000 and bottled in 2003. pours a slightly hazy orange-amber and actually develops a little ring of a head. nose is musty, cobwebby cellar, wet oak, overripe lemon, mineral (wet rock), barn and lactic sticks out more than acid. wonderful. taste is round and smooth and defined. not bracingly sour. everything has come together perfectly. in the taste, must, oak, citrus and barn rule, but are rounded out and balanced by a citrusy, mouth-watering middle and a long, almost peppery finish. soft and silky, the aging process has managed to give just a hint of tingle to the medium body which seems fuller and more present/living/real than other lambics that i've tried. i could drink this everyday. an outstanding beer well worth tracking down."
"Taste is mouthpuckering and tart, it's got that wet horse blanket taste to it that's really cool. Theres a nice light carbonation to I that I like a lot, it makes it much more drinkable. Overall very good."
"Overall, a very nice lambic that I am glad to be able to try. Might be a little harsh in my review since I can't help but compare it to J&J Blauw, which was also a lambic from 2003. Definitely recommended if you get the chance to try it."
"Overall I thought this beer smelled amazing and tasted almost as good. A very well-crafted lambic that's well worth a shot."
"I had high hopes for this and although its above average, doesn't meet my wild expectations for De Cam or a 10 year old lambic."
"The flavor adds in some good notes of citrus and rind underneath the hay, funk, and wet leather that the nose had pulled together. The finish is quite excellent with a slight sourness and a beautiful dryness. Carbonation is light throughout and this goes down quite well. Thanks again, Eric."
"D - I really like this one, although I think it may be past its prime at this stage. Looking forward to comparing it to a fresh vintage. Very easy to drink in any case."
"D - Meh, it's okay, not mind-blowing. The metallic harshness that's showing up for me is off-putting. Glad I was able to try it."
"D - A nice treat, aging well, an evening out of the nose would have improved this one a bit."
"No way I've had a better lambic to date. I've tried some other classics while in Belgium (and also those that are available in the US) and this one is my favorite."
"The toes? A happy accident."
"2000 bottle. Medium orange clear pour, thin white ring of a head that fades into nothing. Funky, minerally on the nose. Some vibrant lemons. Quite a refined and balanced nose. Pleasant flavor, refined yet lively, focusing on lemon citrus acids, a good dose of barnyard funk, and minerals. Soft, soft flavor. Very nice, reminds me of Crianza Helena in its refined, balanced nuances full of really expressive flavors."
"D-this has a huge drinkability factor to it, everything is very soft and subtle with a nice balance to it."
"This is not as complex as it could be and the texture is a little flat at times, but this is a straight Lambic, so you have to expect that. I really like the ample wood character here though. The aroma is definitely a touch more interesting than the flavor and a bit more balanced too; the texture seems to compete with the balance in the flavor. Overall though this is a very nice and tasty Lambic, and I would love to have a bunch of these in the cellar."
"It's very interesting to finally have an unblended lambic this old. I think as it ages it gets more complex but it takes a very long time to do so. I'm still trying to explore this style."
"D: While you do have to enjoy the oak component, this is still a nice lambic that is quite easy to drink."
"Woody and lactic on the palate, firmly sour and fruity with strong but soft tannins. Very smooth and drinkable, the tannins are nicely balanced by the lemony acidity. Carbonation is at a low, almost flat level. It finishes oaky and drying with notes of mellow lactic acidity, cider and lemon rind. Excellent."
"Drinkability was also perfect as no alchol was present and it is lower abv."
"M&D: for my palate, the texture falls slightly too flat; but for an old lambiek I guess that's the rule of the game, and it's remedied by a very soothing sourness throughout that keeps my tongue happy. This is a medium-bodied, subtle lambiek worth trying at least once in one's drinking life. My mind now plays with the idea to drink it served straight from the barrel... I'm sure it's gonna be sublime. But it seems no further ageing is needed for this vintage or this bottle at least, otherwise the delicate balance will be replaced by real boredom, I think."
"Hazy golden, gentle white ring. Deep slightly citrusy nose, lactic and well ponctuated with yeasty horseblanket. Good lemon juice acidity, all in all well blended and smooth, fairly light. truly appealing and diplomatic, close to a 9 for the nose. It doesnt quite hold up in flavor where it is juicy, horsey and astringent. There is this herbal bite that feels almost like a tame jalapeno, which would be paired with a straight hay juice shot. Flavors finish very quick and are far more chaotic than in the nose. Correct mouthfeel on the other hand, a bit light, but fully carbonated if the bubbles dont last very long."
"1995 lambic bottled in 2000 and drank in 2004. Poured a pale hazy yellow beer with almost no carbonation, which was to be expected. Nose of citrus and a bit of acidity. Taste is quite dry and sour with a surprising but welcome subtle sweet ending. Again notes of citrus (lemon/lime) are present. Im not expert on what should unblended bottle lambic should taste like but I can say that this was a real good experience. Too bad I probably wont be able to get my hand on some of this again."
