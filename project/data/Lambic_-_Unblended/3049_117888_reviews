"Pours a light amber color with little head. Aroma of tart unsweetened vinegar and hints of unripe berry. In the taste, unripe fruit, vinegar and lemon. Quite acidic but nice. Refreshingly tart, though near puckering. Has a smooth, light to medium carbonated feel. Overall, a quality sour ale, a coolship done right. Still not at all a replica of Belgian lambic, it's more like a sour brown. It is more palatable than any Unblended Lambic I've had, however. Id have this again."

"Overall, not bad. Couldn't do more than the 6 oz., though."

"On tap at the Federal Taphouse in Lancaster PA. Flat appearance with the fruit and sour hitting the nose. A lot of bang in the taste with pucker to the end that has you going right back for another sip. Outstanding sour that I will hope to sample again someday."

"Served in a goblet, a honey-amber colored liquid, flat, no head whatsoever, no carb, thus no lacing whatsoever. Looked like a glass of juice. In the nose...whew...anyone have some fries [or rather, chips] to go with all this vinegar??? Acetic acid overload, and just about nothing else aroma-wise. In the taste, another acetic twinge up front, very acidic, apples, cherries, some lacto tartness, cork. Medium body, chewy, fairly drinkable, but I really wouldn't go back for a second pour of this one. I'm not sure I'd call this a lambic."
"Overall this is closer to an unblended Oud Bruin or something, nothing close to traditional Belgian lambic, but enjoyable in its own right."
