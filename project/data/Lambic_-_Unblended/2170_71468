4.25,-3.2,,,,,,"The taste is very good with tangy white grape and miold woody tannin and mango-like tropical flavor with slight lemon quality in the background with slight hint of sweetness and juicy citrus tangy acidic flavor which blends with slight funk and herbal flavor which is best described as 'woody with a more tropical taste almost like pineapple with a dash of grapefruit bitterness in the tangy/juicy/dry finish. Overall this is a pretty decent lambic for my first experience with De Cam, not great carbonation but then the flavor and nose make up for that. I would drink this again","Slatetank","Oct 06, 2013"
