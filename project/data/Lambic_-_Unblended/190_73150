3.18,0,,,,,,"Sampled from the barrel. Poured from a jug @ Tour de Geuze. About 12 months old and described by them as still fermenting by them and young. Appearance is also super-murky, milky with some bubbles here,… I quite like their older stuff and lambic I have had from them before but this is a bit too weird for me to get into,… I have never had a lambic like this. Nose is pure rotting grains, spoiled yoghurt, very lactic, rotting barn, mash, soggy cereal,… Taste is fermenting grains, mash, lactic, spoiled yoghurt, rotting barn, mildew, residual sugar,… Watery but also sort of full because of grainy and residual nature,… Wow too far out for me I supposed, how much extracts do you need to add to this in Gods name in order before it tastes like their sweetened & artificial stuff. This stuff is so weird....","77black_ships","Beers"
