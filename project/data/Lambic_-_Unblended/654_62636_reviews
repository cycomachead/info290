review_text
"The beer is served on the warm side as this is still very hot and the cellar here has been warming up. The beer tastes nicely lactic and tart, which engulfs the palate on the first sip. The beer finishes with an oxidized apple character as well as some pear like flavors. The beer is light bodied, but still manages to have some texture to it. The acidity manages to wipe the palate clean quite quickly though. This is only softly acidic, though the lack of carbonation does tend to mute the sourness of Lambics. Musty Brettanomyces flavors, a touch of urea and a musky, sweat dried blanket note are quite apparent in the finish of some sips. There is some astringency and bite in the finish of this beer too. Despite being a little warm, this is still quite nice and refreshing."
