4.25,10.1,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Poured a gorgeous cloudy goldenrod orange body with no head. Overall impression of appearance of is of a very pleasant, rustic lambic. Gorgeous. Scents of sour barnyard funk, horse-blanket, earthy aromas, hay and cider vinegar, mingled with moderately sour notes of lemon and light citrus, along with some light oak and apple aromas on the background. Overall impression of flavor is of an amazing, very traditional lambic. Wild, barnyard sourness dominates and makes this a very pleasing aroma profile, despite what you would think. Flavor begins highly sour with notes of grapefruit, lemon, lemon zest, lactic acid, a bit of oak and a sour, barnyard funk with notes of hay. Middle continues to be sour with notes of oak, lemon zest, lemon and sour barnyard funk. Finish is highly sour with notes of barnyard funk, hay, light hop bitterness, lemon, lemon zest and a bit of grapefruit. Aftertaste is sour barnyard funk, spicy phenolic bitterness and light hop bitterness. Overall impression of flavor is of a nice, traditional, highly sour lambic that is quite refreshing. Very nice. Mouthfeel is medium-light bodied with low carbonation and a sour, puckering, crisp feel. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a light beer that still feels somewhat full, quite nice. Overall this is a great sour. It fits the guidelines for a classic lambic quite nicely and is incredibly sour, complex and refreshing. Quite nice.","Auraan","Mar 27, 2015"

3.96,2.6,3.75,4,4,3.75,4,"Overall, if you’re looking for something a bit lighter, but still with enough soured punch to pack, then this might be the ticket for you.  The malty crispness lends well to the soured, wild dryness and bite of the yeast and bacteria, without overly washing it out.  While it does remain a highly lightened beer, it keeps true to style, without allowing too much carbonation to compromise the complexity of the flavors within.  One thing that we felt was muted, actually, was the oak.  There was more dense woodiness through the taste than the nose, but still, we were left wanting.  We may have tapped this one a bit too early, however.  The puck of tartness, while inviting, does take the first layer of skin from the mouth.  A bit more age would certainly mellow things out, but we would have to be careful as to not allow too much cloy to enter the picture.  It is a wonderful thing, getting into the world of sours, wilds, lambics, and gueuzes, and this one marks another notch on our journey to perfection.  While it doesn’t quite get us there, we are happy to have had the chance to sample it, and feel that if you’re in the mood, then this should do you fine.","TheBrewo","Oct 05, 2014"

Layers of funky complexity burrow deep into this beer with tart and sour components with descriptors that would make the uninitiated sour drinker question why anyone would consume such a "beer". This blended lambic is not, for many reasons, a training wheel sour but it's a damn good beer for those who know what to expect.","BeerFMAndy","Jan 10, 2014"

3.64,-5.7,3,4,3.75,3,3.5,"not as good as i wanted this to be, the 2010-11 vintage in oak and chestnut. it pours a still apple jiuce color, not bubbles at all. hazy, but sunny and bright still. the nose is really funky, authentic lambic smelling with lactic tartness and high acid content. lots of citrus too, smells wild and strong, it fills the room with its funky aromatics. the taste is a little more subtle, sour only in the finish, with rustic wheat malt and lemon juice making up the bulk of the taste. as it warms a yellow grapefruit complex really comes out. fleshy grapefruit is the exact flavor, its uncanny. i have a real problem with the lack of carbonation. i know its one vintage of lambic and is supposed to be this way, but it makes it hard to get into it, i want sour beer like this to resonate and sing, this just falls short of that by quite a bit, its almost dead on the palate. i am glad i got to try this, but at 23 bucks or so per bottle, it is absurdly overpriced. i know there are a number of vintages and barrels released of this, and others may exhibit other characteristics, but at this price i am unlikely to continue experimenting with lambickx.","StonedTrippin","Dec 22, 2013"
3.94,2.1,3,4,4,4,4,"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled in 2012. Pours lightly hazy pale golden straw color with no head or lacing. Some light streaming carbonation from the glass . Aromas of big tart apple, lemon, pear, grape, leather, wood, clove, pepper, hay, straw, grass, wheat, musty funk, white wine, light vinegar, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of wood and yeast notes; with good strength. Feels drier and more oak/wood forward than most lambics I have had. Taste of tart green apple, grape, lemon, leather, clove, pepper, wood, hay, straw, grass, wheat, musty funk, white wine, light vinegar, and yeast earthiness. Fair amount of earthy/spicy tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of green apple, grape, lemon, leather, wood, clove, pepper, hay, straw, wheat, musty funk, white wine, light vinegar, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and balance of wood and yeast flavors; with a moderately dry finish with no cloying flavors. Minimal carbonation and medium bodied; with a smooth, earthy, and slightly acidic mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice lambic style. Very dry with nice complexity and balance of wood and yeast flavors; and very smooth to sip on with no carbonation and light acidity. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Dec 15, 2013"

This is an everyday Lambic if I've ever had one. One that you can take to picnics or have during a warm day to refresh yourself. If the oak were heavier, it would definitely be a more restrained beer, but luckily it's not and comes off as simply an easy, flavorful, unique beer to drink.

After paying around $25 at Binny's South Loop, I am entitled to express some angst. The aroma was a sour grape aroma. If you were deciding whether to eat the hypothetic grape on smell alone, you would probably put it back. On the intial taste, one detects dry grape skin and faint sweet berry in the background. As others have pointed out, it tastes a little more like a farmhouse than a lambic with the lemon notes. As many others have pointed out, this lambic is disturbingly flat. The carbonation makes me think the bottle was never corked in Belgium. In fairness, I probably will not being buying another bottle of this unless somebody wants it in trade.","JohnnyHopps","Jul 19, 2013"

The bottle describes it as lambic and indicates it's aged 2 years (rather than a mix of different years). The level of carbonation is also quite low, although most gueuze wouldn't referment this rapidly either. But, despite these stylistic uncertainties, I still find this rather enjoyable. I'll probably try to find another bottle and cellar it for a couple years to see if it picks up carbonation.","kscaldef","Dec 05, 2011"
4.54,17.6,4,5,4.5,4,4.5,"O: Very nice sour/lambic...very light, barnyard aromatics. A worthy beer for the $27 tag.","BillHilly","Nov 26, 2011"

4.19,8.5,3.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Big citrus flavors at first, lemony with some grapefruit and a slight creamy cheesiness too. Tannic bitterness, moderate puckering sourness. Bone dry oaky aftertaste, slightly honeyish. Medium bodied with fairly low carbonation. Nice work on this lambic, it's legit and highly drinkable. If I had to wager a guess, maybe it's a 2 year old lambic from De Cam, as V&D imports them also...","emerge077","Nov 20, 2011"

4.07,5.4,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Yeah, it was expensive, but, dammit, sometimes ya just gotta splurge, amiright? Anyway, this stuff pours a lightly hazy tawny-straw topped by over a finger of short-lived white foam. The nose comprises lemon zest, lemon rind, light lime peel, tart pineapple, sour green apple flesh, spicy white grapes, and a touch of oak in the background. The taste brings in more of the same, with all of the fruits really coming into their tart own. A small splash of white vinegar and a very brief cobweb encounter round out the highlights. The body is a light medium, with a moderate carbonation and a very dry finish. Overall, a pretty enjoyable brew all-around. My buddy's girlfriend (more of a wine drinker, really) thoroughly enjoyed her pour and went back for seconds and thirds. I would have followed suit, but I knew other beers were waiting in the wings, and I wanted my 'buds in prime condition. Good times.","TMoney2591","Nov 11, 2011"
4.39,13.7,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Quite a wonderful blend and they did a nice job of selecting lambics to create this gem. I can't wait until their next one and hope to find Lambrucha one day.","Naugros","Nov 09, 2011"
3.92,1.6,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Bottle to stemless white wine glass. Looks alright, but very orange, and a little opaque for its type. Smells like heartburn in a glass; heavy sour and citrus. Tastes good. Sour and pear. Mouthfeel is busy and HEAVILY carbonated. Overall, a decent beer, but I think it's WAY overpriced.","b3shine","Nov 08, 2011"
4.3,11.4,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a hazy straw yellow with a small off white head. In the aroma, dry sweet tarts. In the taste, tart pear, dry yeast, and some more sweet tarts. A small sour bite and a medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a dry fruit skin and tartness in the aftertaste. Nice tartness and fruit presence.","OWSLEY069","Nov 07, 2011"
3.81,-1.3,3,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,"D - It was easy to drink - Mike and I destroyed the 750ml bottle. A bit of carbonation might brighten the flavors up, although too much might over-accentuate the woodsy character. Unfortunately, there are better options at this price point so it's unlikely I'll see how this develops over time.","MasterSki","Nov 01, 2011"
3.59,-7,3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"O - Not a bad beer, became very easy to drink and Alex and I did the bottle together without much trouble. Not a great Gueuze, and probably not worth the price tag, but had some good characteristics.","AgentZero","Oct 31, 2011"
3.59,-7,3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Its... okay. Maybe even good. Probably one of the best examples of where a gueuze can start from. A good jumping off point. To further explain why I don't like this beer, the citric acid-like, possibly a mixture of lactic and citric really, flavors don't just hit you... they destroy you. Like drinking a bit of water oversaturated with warhead powder. You aren't left with anything complex from acidity and just a burnt out feeling with bitter tastes.","Khazadum","Oct 31, 2011"
3.88,0.5,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Overall I'd say this is a very solid lambic blend. It's not a style that I am super familier with, but one I'm getting to know more and more. I'll have to see how this compares to the Cantillon Classic Gueuze I have.","DangerDawg","Oct 15, 2011"
