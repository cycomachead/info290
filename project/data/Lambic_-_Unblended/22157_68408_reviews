"This is a lambic for the fourteen and younger crowd, approachable, easy-going. I could see this as a Middle Ages table beer when the water was full of cholera. Good."
""
"Very good tartness, citrus with a pleasant funk. Excellent beer."

"Overall:  Not many reviews of the 2010 vintage here and perhaps none of them have this much age on it; wow, was I impressed with how this bottle has matured; would be hard to pick this out if one were asked to identify the American lambic from a group of Belgians"

"O-A solid lambic, from 2011 all that is left is the acidic notes, can only wonder what it is like fresh"

"Carbonation is noticeably low....the somewhat intense tartness hits me up front in the face. Wow. Definitely an acidic, white grape, wine-like experience here....after the tartness subsides, a note of grain does peek through, giving this more of a ""beer"" flavor. It isn't the most tart beer I've had, but it's certainly high on the scale."

"O: Quite complex and tasty. My first Lambic and I'll definitely be exploring the style more. I'll try to buy another bottle of this to try with some age"
""
""
""
""
"O - This is my first unblended lambic. I enjoy the sourness of the beer, but I would like more. With no experience with Belgian lambics, I am eager to try more. I like this one."

"Really just a decent sour. Nothing too special, but all the flavors and qualities of a good lambic are there in varying degrees. For the price tag of $10-12 it's not bad, but more than that, and you might as well use time and effort to get the Belgians."

"(O)- It is definitely a successful lambic from the states. Always like to see more breweries around here try their hand at my favorite styles."
""
"Overall - Not a complex flavor, but it's decent."

"O: A nicely balanced brew. Quite enjoyable. The acid and funk is there but in no way overwhelming. /91"

"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, 2011 vintage. Pours lightly hazy bright golden straw color with a 2 finger fairly dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin lace that lingers. Minimal spotty lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big tart apple, lemon, pear, grape, clove, oak, hay, grass, vinegar, white wine, funk, leather, and yeast earthiness. Awesome aromas with great balance and complexity of yeast and oak barrel notes; with good strength. Taste of tart apple, lemon, pear, grape, clove, oak, hay, grass, pepper, white vinegar, funk, white wine, leather, and yeast earthiness. Fair amount of acidic tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of light fruits, clove, oak, hay, vinegar, grass, white wine, leather, funk, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and balance of fruity/spicy/funky yeast flavors with moderate barrel presence; with a great malt/tartness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and moderately acidic mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent Lambic style! All around great balance and complexity of yeast and barrel flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink with the moderate acidity. A highly enjoyable offering."

"Appears apricot hazed hue with a light white head fine streaming bubbled carbonation. Fine speckled lacing left behind. Aroma light fruit hints of cherry peach I'm not sure which fruit this lambic uses, wild yeast notes excellent stuff acidic lactic yogurt notes. Flavors are pungent with tart lively acidity, bitterness from nutty earthy yeast and aged hops rolling complexity with hints of peach/strawberry Chobani yogurt dynamic yeast lively flavors great beer. Mouthfeel bone dry lively carbonation effervescent wine like great finish goes down as uber authentic lambic not like a sugar infused Lindemann, I'm in awe. Overall excellence in a bottle, these brewers are inspired keep the sour wild ale program kicking and you will be successful."

"O: Very good lambic from Ohio out of all places! Very enjoyable."

"O- A very solid American sour. I've gotta emphasize though that this is not a lambic, and never could be (it also probably shouldn't invite that comparison either, which can only ever be unfavorable for itself), but besides the linguistic technicalities this is a really nice, tasty, drinkable sour."
"O - fizzes out towards the end but absolutely fantastic up front. I dont know why but I always associate a certain taste in many sours with horseradish... does anyone else know what im talking about?"
""

"1.5 D: If I'm dead tomorrow then it's probably because I finished the bottle by myself. Wholly undrinkable, even for the most seasoned lambic drinkers. I'm not a sour noob, so I'm not overreacting. This may be even less balanced that the Cantillon Kriek I had a while back. Brace yourselves, acid is coming."
"I got this in a trade from one of you fine people last year but I have forgotten who, thanks bud! The first whiff of the opened bottle reeked of cider vinegar, uh oh. I poured a couple glasses and it was an amber orange color and while not quite translucent it wasn't turgid or anything. The aroma settled down after a couple minutes and it was less vinegar but still had an apple cider quality. Flavor was more cider, sour, apples, not bad at all. If you are judging this as a lambic you will be sorely disappointed but I do respect them for going down a difficult path. As an American wild ale its just fine. There are just some qualities to authentic lambic that Americans haven't nailed yet, maybe its the funk, maybe its the yeast, maybe its a je nais se quoi."

"I'm happy to say that the ale is spot-on Senne Valley. If the glass blindly arrives at my table and if told it was an authentic Belgian Lambic, then I would have agreed. With few years under their belt, the Rivertown brewers have figured out the sour puzzle in masterful display."

"D - Very nice lambic. Great overall balance and complexity."

"Pours a murky honey orange with a foamy khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is sour, tart, and funky with malt and fruity aromas. Taste is much the same with a fruity flavor on the finish. There is a mild amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with solid aromas and flavors."
""
"Drink- Its better than average, but not the best beer in the world. Pretty solid."
"Most brewers steer clear of naming their beer a “Lambic” due to the Senne Valley indigenous affiliation and expectations that come with it. Rivertown is obviously paying homage to the originals with their own twist. From the pop of the cork and an amazing aroma, to the freshness of sourness and oak of the wine barrels, this one is here to impress. Top notch."

"O: An easy drinking, delicious unblended lambic. Not that many American breweries are brewing traditional lambics but this one is highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
""

"O - Overall, surprisingly good. Who would have thought a decent lambic could come out of Ohio!"
"Overall this a great beer, holds true to the style, highly enjoyable. Would gladly drink again."
"Overall nice, much better than I expected from a lambic from Midwest, although not top of the top but still a well done lambic."
""
""
"I liked this beer a lot and it's one that I will get again... I don't have access to any other domestic lambics and this is one that I could see myself having again... very nice and well done..."
"Solid lambic that I'll be happy to have anytime I'm in Indy and can snag a bottle, but nothing overly special. I'd prefer more of a sour kick."
""
""
""
""
"My first unblended lambic, and I enjoyed it. I'm still not very familiar with the range of sour beers, but can say it was tasty, even though it seemed just as much of a dry cider or white wine as it did a beer."
"D - Wow this is the most boring lambic I've ever had. The aroma was soft and semi-inviting but the taste was mega-fail."
""
""
"This is upon opening has some of that classic lambic smell, which is always a good thing. Once entering the glass it bubble up about 1/2 a finger of head before quickly disappearing into a very slim rim of bubbles. the nice golden hue of the beer is vibrant and cloudy at the same time. the aroma from the opening still last in the glass and is very enticing, which leads into the taste. the taste wasnt quite as stellar as the smell, it has a bit of watery essence at the end of the sip, that would be the biggest complaint. 1 or 2 yrs down the road i can see this developing more in the bottle. the mouthfeel was spot on for a nice american sour. overall im glad i have a second bottle and ill be seeking at least one more out. good job Rivertown, I cant wait to get my hands on the other sours from this ""local"" brewery."
"Pours a clear golden color with a white head. A light vinegar note, but still a decent lactic character. Lots of lemon peel, straw, and a decent funkiness, though mostly just must. A touch of oak and green apple. The palate is a little dull, but not awful. Good tartness with oak, green apple, lemon, and a touch of white vinegar. Not terribly complex or funky, but still nice."

"Overall: This has gotta be an under the radar sour. Its made in Ohio of all places and thats where an under the radar sour would probably come from! Get yourself a bottle if you like a sour brew."
"Good ""local surprise"" here. Would have again would recommend to sour fans. Thanks MaxSpang...go to snobbybeer.com!"
""
"Overall – Pretty good stuff. I wasn't expecting much but the flavours are very good and the beer isn't that far off from some of the more renowned lambics I have tried."
"Overall Impression- While sour beers are some of my favorites out of any style, this one rocked the festival into conversation all day about it! If you get a chance, pick up more than one bottle and I'll take one off your hands in a trade! Perfect unblended lambic attributes. The appearance and smell were above average but the rest of the beer has high marks!"
""
"Light body, with some refreshing carbonation. Alcohol is a non-factor. Not overly complex, but some nice flavors. Well done from a younger American brewery, and in my home state!"
""
""
""
""
"In terms of a ""bang for your buck"" beer, this is a strong winner."
"M/O - Low carbonation. Maybe that was the result of the early gush of foam, or the odd cork issues. Overall I'd classify that as a valiant effort, but there's definitely room for improvement. But hell, I think it's cool just to see a US brewer attempt a true lambic. Party on."
""
"Rivertown Lambic isn't a bad beer, but it's lacking in the wow-factor department. Not a bad early effort. hopefully Rivertown keeps it up."

"Thanks to jdiddy for breaking this beer out. A great label with a bottle shape that is very reminiscent of a single malt. 2010 vintage served in a tulip. Pours a pale gold hue with a hazy clarity and a loose, quarter inch bright white head that dissipates into a thin, tight white band around the edges. Nose is somewhat Cantillon-esque - salty, funky, citrusy, cork. Reminds me a bit of a funky version of Ithaca Brute. Taste follows nose - no surprises; however, the funk is less prominent than suggested by the aromas present in the nose. Mouthfeel is light-medium (but closer to light) and slightly astringent, but not overly so. Carbonation is pleasant, not overly assertive and even from start to finish. Overall, I really enjoyed this beer and would love to track down a couple more bottles to cellar. The surprise of the night for me."
"Big thanks goes out to my boy aasher for giving me this one during our MASSIVE in-person trade when he came down to visit! Thanks buddy! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller taster flute. Poured a hazy golden yellow with a one finger pure white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, citrus, lemon zest, funk, and slight tart fruit. The flavor was of sweet malt, funk, lemon rine, lemon zest, citrus, and wood. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. I was really surprised at how citrus/lemon forward this one was. The funk aspect was quite nice on this one and played well with citrus however. My only gripe was that this one wasn't as complex as I would have liked, but still managed to come across as a nice brew to all who tried it. Worth trying if you can find it, and worth seeking out for fans of the style or lemony brew fans."

"Cork pulled apart in three pieces- cheap agglomerated cork, not a good sign initially. Pours a hazy straw gold, ample white head, and a thick cap of lacing after the head had fallen. Smells like lemon zest, saltwater (in a good way), light grain, straw, very appealing. Salty citrus, lemon, slight sweet malt, mild citric acid, slight black pepper. Mouthfeel is light-medium and carbonation is high, body lingers just enough, very well balanced, extremely smooth drinking. Damn I need more! Oh and brewer- upgrade the cork, presentation is everything, and I'd hate to have a bottle ruined by a disintigrated cork!"
"Overall good. Would like a little more fruit though. Solid stuff"
"The beer is really hazy and yellow hued, with a thin, white head. The aroma is really nice, with an authentic Belgian lambic vibe. Funky citrus, yeast, hay, straw. The flavor is quite enjoyable, though it lacks the complexity that was potential in the aroma. The finish is not as full or exciting as the first half of the flavor profile. A decent example of an American gueuze."
"O: Glad I got to try this before it was totally gone. Not a bad first lambic from a Cinci brewery. I didn't expect anything great so this pretty much met my expectations. They could really nail this with the next batch. Worth checking out."
"O - Pretty good beer! probably the best one I've had from Rivertown, and one of the few that doesn't have any glaring deficiencies."
"Pours a light hazy yellow. A good amount of white head. Smells tart and light. Funky but not that earthy. Tastes tart and funky. The sourness is not that strong. Overall tasty but nothing special. Enjoyable and one of the better offerings that Rivertown has. A great first attempt and I'd love to see more of this!"
"O-good first attempt on this. Would like to see it with age"
"Overall: Surprisingly good."
"A good stab at a very hard to replicate style."
"I am very happy with this and proud that its from Cincinnati. This gets me excited about what Rivertown is going to come up with next. I need to give their Hop Baron another try because if they can make this, I have to believe their Hop Bomber is better than the one I tried."
"Brightly tart and sweet fruit flavors, nectarine citrus, tangy lemon. Mellow vinous feel, a bit cidery, though not getting any vinegar or acetone at all, more of a clean tart lacto. Some slightly bretty funk that reminds me of warm white wine. Mildly acidic with some bite to it. Could be a little drier, and show more oak character. Overall though, a great example of an American Wild Ale inspired by traditional Belgian Lambic."
"Overall a great sour. This is my first but I think it is really great. Sour but not so that you will clinch up like a Mormon. Feel just fits the taste and the taste is very pleasant. Time to try more sours"
"750 ml capped and corked bottle, 2010 vintage. Served in a flute, the beer pours a hazy straw gold color with about a half inch white head. Head retention is decent, and there's a small amount of lacing. Aroma is lemon peel, oak, and some funk. It's a nice but light aroma. The brew tastes like tart apples, pears, lemon peel, vinegar, and some funk. Nice lingering tart finish. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium and it's well carbonated. I think this is a good brew, I'd buy this again in the future. Definitely worth a try."
"M. A good beer; certainly one of the best from Cincinnati. I wish it was a bit more full in terms of both mouthfeel and flavor. It's a decent tartness, but it should be sitting on top of a more complex background. I certainly hope they continue to refine this."
"Despite the flaws I've mentioned in my review, I felt this beer still worked, which is why my scores are a little higher than you'd expect from the review itself."
"O- A decent brew that I'm glad I got a chance to pick up. The $13.99 price tag will probably keep me from getting it again anytime soon though."
"There is some nice lactic sourness with an acetic brightness, mild malate and some citric too. All the players are on the table here. There is a shift here to the brightness and away from the lactic creaminess, this beer would take some sour fruit well. Overall a great attempt and I'm looking forward to other sours from these guys."
"Pours a light straw-yellow color with a mild white head. The nose brings some light cheese and funk with a bit of acidity. The taste starts like a berliner with some mild grain and wheat plus a touch of acidity. Some mild peach and apricot character there. Light body and mild tartness with low carbonation. The nose brings some bready yeast as it warms. Mild acid in the finish. A really nice attempt and a solidly-drinkable brew, especially on a pretty warm evening."
"I wasn't sure what to expect from a Lambic done by Rivertown. I am in love with this beer. It seems to really hit the nail on the head style wise. Its very well done."
"O: I am really impressed with this offering from Rivertown. This is a really good stab at making a very funky beer. Well done!"
"O: Very good overall. I am proud to see the local boys turning out styles like this. I think if it were to age a year or two it would really be somethin'."
"This is a very nice lambic, I think it would be great if they keep some in oak for a few years so they can take a stab at gueuze in the future. It would be very cool to see this type of development in the USA, especially in OH."
"Moderate sourness and funky qualities with medium carbonation. Black cherry and other red fruit flavors on the mid palate with tart fruits on the finish. Nice acidity and very nice overall."
