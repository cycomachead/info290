Lemons cherries and raspberries meld nicely with a hint of vinegar some leather, oak, and funk. Medium body with a light level of carbonation and a tart puckering mouthfeel.

The flavor is mirrored by the aroma; sweet cherry and fruit notes with some overarching funk to it. Not as funky or sour as I would have expected. Balanced. Overall, am I impressed by this? Yes and no. Yes in terms of how this has held up and the overall experience of getting to drink this. No in the fact that if this was a ""new"" beer I would have been a little let down. Some carbonation would have been nice. Medium mouthfeel. I find myself saying that I could drink this all day.","Samichlaus82","Sep 18, 2012"

4.26,-6.4,5,4,4,5,4.5,"750mL Auction bottle 20/250 courtesy of Urbain. This was of course the beer I looked forward to the most during our sour epic. But this was very disappointing. It pours a beautiful dark pink with a small, white/light pink head. Aroma is stellar: it is probably the best kriek/sour nose I have ever encountered: it is full of cherry pie, wet oak, soft leather, tannic acid, horsey Brett. Very soft nose and refined. Taste is a little bit sweet, slightly medicinal, full of sweet cherries, sour raspberries, and light vinegar/acetic acid.

The musty aroma is there, but the cherry still comes through pretty strong with some barrel. Flavor is slightly sour at first, followed by the cherry and then I get the vinous flavors coming through. It is hanging around between sips and very enjoyable. The feel is pretty thin, but I think it's fitting. Overall very enjoyable. I am very grateful to have been able to try this legend.","Mark000","0"

A nice cherry, musty, and leathery aroma wafted from my glass that I greatly enjoyed. The taste combined some sour cherries, with a slight lactic souring. Red jammy and dark fruit also present in the taste. Mouthfeel was medium to thin, very smooth and I was surprised at how the carbonation held up. Very drinkable and I was glad I tried this gem.

The taste shockingly still has a solid presence of cherries. Vinous and slightly sour/funky. Very nice flavor. Age has treated this one well. The mouthfeel is light and low carb. Drinks very easy. Overall, this is a very good one to have tried. The effort at this point might be a little much to justify, but it is a really good beer.","seeswo","Aug 25, 2012"

3.86,-15.2,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"OVERALL: This was a real treat. Dirty Horse has aged very gracefully after almost thirty years, but you can tell it's starting to get old. Consequently, while drinking this was a wonderful experience, is was probably not as memorable and impressive a beer as it would have been years ago. That said, this was very well balanced and the flavors mellow enough to drink is mass quantities. The cherry flavors, while muted after so long, still provide a nice, tart flavor to go with the funky sourness and light bitterness. It was great to finally try this beer, and I look forward to trying the 2005 batch at some point in the future. Thanks again for bringing this one to Copenhagen gents!","Jeffo","Apr 30, 2012"

Wet earth, bready malt, sherry and tart cherry dominate. Slight oxidization but nothing out of the ordinary for something this age. Medium thick, soft chewy body with trace carbonation. This and V005 were our most anticipated beers of the tasting. This bottle of Dirty Horse was an amazing experience, but was a little past its prime and the blend is probably a safer bet at this point.","yourefragile","Apr 16, 2012"

4.1,-9.9,4,4,4,5,4,"o - Overall I thought this was a good beer, but not great, and no where near deserving the hype. Very easy to drink and great mouthfeel, but the nose and taste are a bit old, musty, and weak; I think the beer is a bit past its prime at this point.

I keep going on and on about the mouthfeel because it was the best part of the beer. The beer itself was a little bland, flat and mildly fruity with a musky oaky finish. I'm not saying it was bad but it is not the best ""unblended"" lambic I've ever had. I'd be interested in trying the blended version.

5,9.9,5,5,5,5,5,"Bottle 001/250. 100% unblended 1983, hand signed- thanks Urbain!!! Drank with my Dad, Carl, Jamie, and Chris. After about 5 minutes at chipping away at the bombproof wax job, I am finally able to see a cap. Upon prying it off, I am met with some mild gushing. After a proper lambic pour by Chris, I am met with a gorgeous brownish tinted garnet body and a robust off white head. The aroma is like nothing I’ve ever experienced. A huge old must character gives way to sour cherries, geuze cellar, leather, and the most profound funk profile I’ve ever encountered. The flavor holds tons more old must with a beautifully balanced cherry acidity that gives way to a mouth puckering finish. The mouthfeel is ultra dry and ultra crisp. My mouth felt just as dry even 10 minutes after finishing my last sip. Easily the best example of sour beer I’ve ever encountered. I don’t know how beer could get any better.","JamesOtey","Dec 27, 2011"

Insanely nuanced and balanced, this beer is a true testament to Urbain's craftsmanship. Truly a world class offering, and I hope that I am able to try the new batch to be able to compare my experiences.","NittanyBeerFan","Beers"
4.64,2,4,5,4.5,5,4.5,"A couple of observations: one, there seems to be significant bottle variation here. At least one review from a different 100% mentions high carbonation and a drying finish, neither of which mirrored my experience. Two, it's remarkable that this beer hasn't turned into vinegar. Acetobacter isn't a forgiving souring agent, and I'm surprised that the oxygen that's enabled the sherry note to develop hasn't negatively affected this brew. Three, I wish I get to try the blended version, 'cos I can only imagine that will be brighter and have a more pronounced cherry character - not that this beer needs either, but simply because it'd be interesting to try.

The flavor is amazing and definitely the highlight beer of the night in our massive tasting of great sours - again, lots of cherries in here, with drying oak and lactic funk.

The balance between cherries, acidity and oak is brilliant, wonderfully mellow yet flavorful. The body is silky, almost buttery, and it finishes with a blend of sweet and sour cherries and drying oak. Taken as a Flanders style red, this is great, better than most anything else I've had in the style. Taken as a lambic, it's on par with some of the greats.","largadeer","Jun 26, 2010"

4.73,4,5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Overall: I have to say that I normally really not like this style, actually, I almost avoid it. But after the Crianza Helena and Blabaer from Cantillon, this is the 3rd I love. Pity all of them are limited brews....","rvdoorn","Sep 19, 2008"
4.85,6.6,4.5,4.5,5,5,5,"Wow!!! This is one hell of a Sour/Lambic. Shared a decanter of this 5 year old Horse with Urbain, Peter, Phil, and Joe at the Struise Farm. Pours into the glass as an orange/hazy color with hardly any head. This is where fun begins; the aroma was fruity and vinous with a hint of cherry, along with a light hint of wood. Flavor is a light cherry goodness, while remaining lightly vinous, lightly acidic, along with a light hint of wood; an exceptionally complex brew. The balance of this stunning sour and intermixing of sweet and sour flavors, with an underlying hint of cherry is just superb! Perfectly smooth light body and juicy funk to balance the sourness. Absolutely a world class beer and one that I would love to try again; words can't do this brew justice! Thanks Urbain for this rare treat.","ygtbsm94","Beers"
4.97,9.2,4.5,5,5,5,5,"Samnpled at the Struise Farm from Urbain from a wine decanter. What a wonderful 5 year old treat. The beer poured a hazy orange color with nearly no head. The aroma of the beer had nice notes of fruit, cherry, and some wine like qualities. Slightly sour. The taste was the real treat. Although 5 years old the taste was very present. A nice cherry quality, not to acidic but had a good sour quality. There were some definite wood notes as well. I found there to be an excellent balance of the sweet fruit and the tart character as well. This is one very drinkable and well rounded beer. I just wish there was more to go around. I wanted to run with the decanter and drink it all but that would not be good form for a guest at the farm! Seek this beer out if you can find any.","ggaughan","0"
