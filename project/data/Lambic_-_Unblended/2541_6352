3.2,-17.7,3,3,3.5,3,3,"Pours a dark golden amber, transparent, creamy off white head and a lot of lace. The nose offers sweet caramel and candied fruit with a touch of a metallic twang and some light cherry behind. The taste is a little more put together, still very sweet. Notes of lemon zest and some lightly soured cherry on top of caramel and candied sugars. Lighter body, soft on the palate and very creamy. Decent carbonation and a semi dry finish.","cpetrone84","Apr 02, 2012"

4.33,11.3,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Golden orange brown pour with minimal head and lacing. Spicy aromas that carry into the flavor along with candied fruit - some nuttiness too ... reminding me of a port without the wine backbone. Good body and a long lasting terrific finish. Canâ€™t wait to have this one again!!","brendaniel","Feb 25, 2010"
3.63,-6.7,4,3.5,3.5,4.5,3.5,"I really wonder how Girardin makes this beer, it is likely a blend with a bit of Lambic in it and some caramel color; quite weird in some ways, I am really not quite too sure what to think. In the end this is a bit simplistic, but still nice.","Gueuzedude","Jun 05, 2008"

3.8,-2.3,4,4,3.5,3,4.5,"Pours amber. Big yeast bananna bread aroma. Thick and foamy head. Good retension. The yeast smells and tastes much more like the strains used in Hefeweizens rather than most belgian beers I've had. Still very good. Fruit, malt, wheat-yeast.... goes down very smooth.","gonzo46and2","Jul 02, 2006"
4.2,8,4,4,4.5,4,4,"MF&D- The beer was medium bodied, chewy and breadlike. Coated the mouth well with its slight thickness. Definitely a great beer and worth hunting down. I drank the entire bottle while watching the NCAA championship game and looked for more when I was done.","hyland24","Aug 02, 2004"
3.63,-6.7,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"I had this with a friend this past weekend after we finished a bottle of chimay red label. The vos has a similar smeel, taste and feel to it but it has a little more bite than the chimay. I prefer the chimay to this one but it is still a very good beer. You can shave with the amount of foam head that comes out of the bottle. Goes down smooth too and like I said with a little more bite than the chimay.","Poppypitbull","Sep 30, 2002"
4.1,5.4,3.5,3.5,4.5,3.5,4.5,"Other comments: We had intended on having a late lunch here, but since they only take cash and the KBC bank in the square wouldn't accept my ING card, I had to settle for a beer only. So, I went for this one which I was really looking forward to trying. It was served very cold from the tap in a small tapered glass. Though the serving temperature was probably too cold for a real ""tasting", it was fantastic that way. Even my wife liked it (and she doesn't usually like any of the beers I make her try).","GreenCard","Beers"
3.76,-3.3,4,3,4,4,4,"I was told by the older lady behind the bar that this is a one-off by Girardin, a blend of Lambic and Faro. The lack of flemish and the fact that our party was 30+ people on a quiet Saturday prematurely ended the discussion at that point. Thats all I know of this beer. Different to most blended lambics, and quite simply - quite unique, it seems.","TheLongBeachBum","0"
