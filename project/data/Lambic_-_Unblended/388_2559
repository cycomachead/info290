4.45,13.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.25,4.5,"I liked this one more than I anticipated - perhaps even more than the Lou Pepe Gueuze opened the night before.  Just slightly effervescent, the mostly flat, oily mouthfeel is more akin to wine than what I am used to in a beer. The nose is beautiful in a funky way - barnyard, hay and earth. The funk carries to the flavor but there is also a bright lemon/citrus quality and an overall lightness that is greatly balanced. The acidity is moderate and allows the delicate qualities of the lambic to shine through. At first, the flatness was off putting, but the more I drank this beer, the more I wished it wouldn't end. This beer is outstanding, and in my opinion, underrated.","brianmandell","Thursday at 07:59 PM"

Pours deep golden colored with no head and no real bubbles coming up. Aroma is vinous, white wine, oak, vinegar, some sugar sweetness. Flavor is honey apples, vinegar, lightly sour, funky yeast notes, a bit of buttery influence, and drinks very much like a super smooth chardonnary. No carbonation and medium bodied. This was very interesting, pretty unique, and something Iâ€™d order again in place of white wine.","BMMillsy","Sep 12, 2014"

The color is a bright gold shade that looks pretty. Swirls dont bring any bubbles either, I realize this is unblended lambic. Smell is barnyard scents mixed in with some apple and pear, lazy lambic scents. Hay comes through as it comes up to temp and the oak is quite bold in the end, it all comes together. Bg amounts of oak in taste with wet wood, musty basement, sour apple, light malt build, no hops. I just like the simpleness of this beer and it is more enjoyable off the tap with just a bit of life within the light body. I could drink globs of this stuff.","BARFLYB","Dec 01, 2012"

Bruocsella delivers everything you expect from Cantillon; it's intensely dry and sour, with a light fruity character and musty depth. The only let-down is the mouthfeel - the absence of carbonation removes a desirable dimension from the body (I realise this is a contradiction, as unblended lambics are uncarbonated). However, it remains a brilliant effort - the flavour of time itself. A must-try brew; don't pass it up.","jazzyjeff13","Jul 28, 2012"

The flavor was of sweet malt, earth, funk, green olive, and tart. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. I was really quite surprised at how close to being a still brew this one was. Even though this was the case it was still quite enjoyable. All of the flavors were delicate while being intense at the same time to keep your palate on its toes throughout the glass. Really glad I got the chance to try this one fresh as I have a few sitting my cellar. Definitely a must try if you get the opportunity to do so even if you arenâ€™t a Loon fan.","thagr81us","Jun 07, 2012"

3.4,-13.3,3,3,4,2,3.5,"Cantillon Bruocsella Grand Cru pours orange, lightening to tangerine at the edges, and with not quite 100% clarity. A few scant bubbles briefly form on top of the beer, but that's it, not even a bit of head to it. The nose is a little dull, but it has some wet hay notes from the brett, as well as a light tartness. There's a bit of honey soaked apple at the open of each sip, which is a nice touch. The barnyard funk comes in mid palate, and is surprisingly restrained. A brief citric/lemon sourness comes in for the finish. The mouthfeel can only be described as flabby. It's damn near completely flat, and leaves the body feeling way too full for a wild ale. I guess it was bound to happen, but Bruocsella Grand Cru is the first time I've really been let down by Cantillon.","axeman9182","May 19, 2012"

In the mouth the beer shows plenty of sourness, lemon peel notes, sharp acidic finish, a little woody character at the end. Medium bodied, carbonation is pretty much absent here. Overall this was quite a bit more mellow and a bit less sour than I was expecting, but the key lambic notes are present.

The flavors are watery and again there are dehydrated fruits making up the sour. It's almost a neutral lambic (I know there isn't fruit), like sour water. It drinks very light in watery in body.

Funky sweaty horse blanket with a touch of plastic phenol round out the nose. Funky phenolic comes out first before a bit of fruity lemony lactic puckers me up a bit. There's still a bit of malt sweetness in there that tries to counter the onslaught of funk, but it fails. Medium body, still carbonation, with a tart earthy sourish puckering mouthfeel.

Tartness subdues as the glass warms. Flat body (expected for the style), slick, medium full and a lemony tartness that puckers. Maybe a touch of hop bitterness at the end.

Nose is delicate and subtle, but complex and definitely opens up as the beer airs out. i get lemon, preserved lemon, grape, grapefruit, sour milk (just a touch), wood and cobweb on wet rock. pretty awesome actually. really evokes a sense of place. the taste... woah!! taste is sour, lemony, oaky... with a cobweb on wet, musty cellar wall finish. sounds strange? it is, but equally awesome. slick, medium body with a tang that holds. not so sure yet where lambic/geuze fit in to my repertoire, but the authenticity of the flavors are becoming extremely alluring to me. not for the faint of heart, but a really interesting treat when you're in the right mood.","timtim","Jul 31, 2010"

Tannic, leathery oak counters the juiciness, lending a strong dryness that creates and interesting dynamic. There's plenty of fruit flavor on display, from tart green grapes to apple cider to lemon flesh and peel. Acidity is strong but at a balance with the other flavors. It isn't harsh in the least, but it's certainly felt over the course of the bottle. The woody, drying, earthy tannins really take hold in the finish, giving me a mild case of cotton mouth. The stillness works wonderfully for the beer, allowing each and every nuance to have a turn on the palate and leaving the flavors lingering for minutes after each sip.

I've been trying a few wild ales and lambics over the past year, and am really getting a taste for them. I thought this beer was delicious. Lots of flavor, lots of interesting mouthfeel, but nothing too overboard (and a nice, low-for-me ABV). I'm not giving it "Well, I guess it's supposed to taste like that..." 4s, but solid, "These flavors work; I want to drink this again," 4s.

Having said that, the brew felt like a rare, and difficult, treat: rather pleasing in small servings but with a marked sour and vinegar character that is a challenge to most palates over the long run.

I believe that the lack of carbonation does not allow the aromas to be fully expressed. Flavor is vinous, with apples and a tropical fruit explosion before the tart finish (though not as tart as the gueuzes of Cantillon or Girardin).

Wonderful aroma. The taste is dry and mouthpuckeringly sour. It's not as intense a sourness as I expected, and seems to have been softened by the aging? This makes the beer a lot more drinkable than other Cantillon's. Light, easy to sip, and interesting.

The bite of tart apples is lightly offset with a touch of vanilla and oak in the finish, nothing too bad at all, but nothing blowing me away.

Something original and pure. Though it has no head, the body is somehow smooth and nice. It also goes down quite well.","Douglas88","Nov 12, 2008"

Aroma is typical for a Cantillon brew, with lemon, grass, yeast, some funk etc. Taste is of fresh lemons, oranges, grain and some slight vinegar. This one is not quite as mouth puckering as some of the other brews I have sampled from this brewery. Perhaps the age of this beer has calmed it down a bit. Body is my only real gripe with this beer. There is no carbonation whatsoever. I suppose that is what they were going for in their comparing it to a chardonnay, but I like at least some fizz in my beer. A bottle was rather easy to drink.

Swirling release notions of honey and aspirin. Enticing aromawise, indeed. Incipient in flavor is a brusque wash of clean, simply tart dilute acetic acid. Ensuing mid palate is a burly melange of goaty caproic acid, tepid lactic acid tartness, all enveloped by rounded fermented citrus pith like bitterness. As the beer warms, lemon and dried sour plum candy hints arise along with suggestions of powdered quinine. Dusty, thinnish mouthfeel that's akin to filtered still cider. Finishes with a snap of bile - like bitterness and lingering white grape skin like tannins. A delicious lambic, with stunning complexities, yet it sits softly on the palate. Outstanding.

This is so dry except for a keel of honey thinned with green apple juice, a couple drops of tropical fruit essence, and grain soaking water. The sourness is so pervasive, but smooth. Sip after sip gives me pleasure that is both relaxing, and inpsiring. This is a real transport beyond time.

Unblended and unadulterated goodness. Has a light citrus (lemon and limes) flavor with granny-smith apple and a light berry flavor. Mildly vineous and woodsy. Lightly musky and powdery. Intense sourness quickly gives way to an ultra clean, crisp feel. Lightly astringent and a tad grainy (to be expected). Flavors are fleeting and the body finishes abruptly.

I have had nearly all of cantillon's products over a number of years and these two are the only times I have felt this, and I still drink other products from them regularly.

Finish was very dry and tart. I have not had the opportunity to have very many true lambic style beers, but I certainly liked this one.

Exceptionally clean clear flavor, just exploding with balanced tart and sour with the raw funk of nature. Tons of slick malts behind it all with pils, kilned sweetness, and wheat twisted by wild yeast. Carbonation is a dream, sprite yet soft, an amazing effect and aids the flavor tons. Slick and complex.

But even before I poured it, as I let it warm up a tad from being in the fridge, I could smell it from the bottle a few feet away. Once it's in my awesome Schlitz snifter the fragrance is even more pronounced. Major funk, dirt, spices, lemmon rind... burns the ol nose hairs if you take a huge sniff. First sip; the taste is much more subtle than I was expecting. Much less intense or sour than their gueuze, which at first threw me off. However, I think since your tastebuds aren't attacked there's more room for unique flavors to present themselves. Wow there's a lot more here than I originally thought. There's a real wet hay taste to it, mixed with freshly cut grass. Also, lemon juice and citrus, along with some spice (maybe even a hop or two thrown in there). I'm also getting some distinct saltwater action, like taking a gulp of the ocean. Everything hits you again in the aftertaste, which lingers. Incredibly light and smooth mouthfeel.

3.79,-3.3,3,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Had this on tap last evening. The brew was poured to a cloudy brass color with no head what so ever. The smell was tart, as my wife said it reminded her of sour patch candy, also notices earthy like aroma. The taste was quite sour and also had wine like highlights. As the brew warms the tartness comes out more and more. Also notice what I believe is a oak like taste that seems to complement it quite nicely. Over all it was a good brew, just not my cup of tea. Would try it again, but not regularly.","Stimack","Mar 05, 2005"
4.25,8.4,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Poured from a corked 750 ml bottle. I was a little worried because the side of the bottle was sticky, and the cork crumbled when I open it, but everything turned out fine. This beer pours out a hazy orange with a great deal of floaties. No head at all. The aroma is sour, typical lambic. Not quite as funky as some, but the funk is still there. Sour grapes and lemon. Acid burns the throat. This unblended lambic is not as complex as some gueuzes. No carbonation, but it's still easy to drink, even with the mouth puckering. A little thin, but very flavorful. Not the best from Cantillon, but a very good beer.","beveragecaptain","Feb 27, 2005"

3.44,-12.2,3,4,3,3,4,"Cloudy golden yellow, very hazy, no head. Sweet honey nose with strong brett profile. Kiwi, lemon, grapefruit and mostly pineapple make for a dynamic fruit salad. Horsey funk, salt, ink, lactic and big rubber tones make up for funk lovers. I couldnÂ’t dig the flavor so much, plastic and rubber are a bit too dominant. IÂ’m not one to complain about crap, leather and the likes, but I find no interest in plastic... Astringent and citric grapefruit/pineapple juice. Still body, juicy and funky. I expected more from my first unblended lambic experience..","Rastacouere","Jan 24, 2005"
4.5,14.8,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Out of a capped and corked 750ml split with a friend. It pours out very mildly carbonated with no real head to speak of, a few bubbles cling to the insides of the glass at most. The body is thick with haze and is an orangish shade of amber. The nose is alive with damp hay, musty oak and sour funky aromas. Sipping this brew is almost a shock at first and even when you're used to it will still come back and slap your tongue around a little bit. Initially a bit astringent, mid-palate the funky flavors of damp earth and hay appear alongside musty oak and then intertwine and are eventually eclipsed by face-caving tartness that lasts through the finish where it is met a with the flavors of grapeskin. I can't even really describe everything that goes on in this beer but it is a wonderfully complex experience.","FormatKid","Dec 06, 2004"
3.9,-0.5,4,4,4,3,4,"Upon it disembarking the 750ml green bottle resides in the glass a beclouded straw color with a smallish off white head and the resultant lace a thin but sealing sheet. Nose is tart, with hints of sour apples, citrus like in its crispness; start is dry and sour with the top light. Finish continues the devastatingly tartness, dry as a bleached desert bone, and the aftertaste lingers long, a true lambic loverÂ’s brew that you will love or hate, I love it, but beware its not meant for everyone even if you like most lambics","Gusler","Nov 29, 2004"

4.55,16.1,4,4,5,4.5,4.5,"Pours out a strawish color with little to no head. Tastes big and sour just as one would expect a true lambic. Cantillon keeps putting out some of the best lambic in the world and this Grand Cru Broucsella is no exception. But you either like the beast or you don't. If you do like the sourpuss lambic, you won't lose with this one.","scottum","Nov 03, 2004"

4.32,10.2,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Initially sharply acidic. Held on the back of the tongue, it's just like lemon juice that you buy in a bottle. Slightly sweet when held on the front of the tongue, with earthy mushroom forming somewhere deeply hidden. Jaw-clenching sourness when rolled to the sides, with explosive crab apple and drawing tannins. Very, very dry in the finish, with acidic lingerings long, long after the swallow.","rabidawg","Jul 27, 2004"
4.25,8.4,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"This lambic poured a cloudy, golden color with thin white foam that settled. The smell was a tart, musty, gueuze-like aroma. The taste was sharp and tart with some musty and vinous qualities. Some tanins could be tasted in the astringent finish. The mouthfeel was sharp and tart and dry. The body was medium with moderate carbonation. The mouthfeel had a sublime quality and the dryness and flavor lingered nicely. This was a very nice lambic.","UncleJimbo","Jul 05, 2004"
3.65,-6.9,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Had this on tap at Redbones...pour was a cloudy apricot color. Aroma was of sweet sweatsocks. I found the taste sweet to start, but sort of hit a tannic, or leathery wall...intriguing. The beer became a bit more tart as it warmed up, with horseblanket notes coming on strong towards the end. A beer I need to do more 'research' on, definitley not for the faint of beer palate.","PatandDavid","Jun 27, 2004"

4.37,11.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Being an obsessive Cantillon fan, I couldn't pass this brew up when I first came across it. It comes in a capped and corked 750ml bottle, with a note from the brewer on the back stating that this is the only unblended lambic available. Pours a slightly cloudy golden color with no head - this beer is as close to uncarbonated as possible. The nose is full of oakey, earthy notes, with just a hint of the sourness to come. Taste is as sour as can be, with some barnyard notes and a firm oak backing. The body is light, and the acidity makes the beer jump off the palette and leaves you ready for more. An amazing, unique brew, although I must admit the traditional blended geueze is a little more my style.","ColForbin","Mar 10, 2004"
4.62,17.9,4.5,5,4.5,3.5,5,"Poured a clear golden yellow, no head. Smell is of oak, musty barnyards, sour vinegar, and an almost "clean" scent that I can't quite place. The taste is fantastic. Massive depth. The oakiness smooths the entire range of flavors and unites them into one unified tongue demolishing front. Lactic and acetic notes predominate and the finish smoothes over with a rich tannin quality like a dry white wine. The mouthfeel is interesting, but I think I'm just not used to beers with purposefully no carbonation. It is a cascading array of flavors and tastes. Truly an exceptional beer.","jlervine","Feb 26, 2004"
4.62,17.9,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"After describing the unadulterated lambic, I enjoyed the rest of it with stinky mushroomy/earthy French cheese smeared on slices of French baguette....excellent!","HiroProtagonist","Feb 22, 2004"
4.22,7.7,4,4.5,4.5,3,4,"Underneath nary a head (bubbly and white) sits an inviting golden liquid of pure unblended real lambic. Aroma is of wool, acetic acid, lemon and hay, must, lime, dew and a slight funky barnyard character as well. The carbonation is very low. Almost negligible. The flavors of this tart beer are surprisingly refreshing. The acidic nature offers a bit of a bite, but the flavors blend together nicely. Lemongrass, vinegar, funky barnyard stuff, aged hops, army blanket... And bone dry. And that's an understatement. Yeah, this is lambic. And a good one at that.","Bighuge","Feb 04, 2004"
4.42,12.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Refreshing in an unparalleled fashion, this is the only unblended straight lambic I've had the pleasure of sampling in bottled form. Truly remarkable, Grand Cru actually paired quite well with baked escolar in a mango-chardonnay marinade. The acidity of the lambic balanced out the oiliness of the fish and the sweetness and tanginess of the marinade. This is one fantastic beer, aged for almost two years in the bottle. It could go much longer, and for some folks' tastes, probably should. This will no doubt frighten the unenlightened.","Jon","Feb 03, 2004"
3.96,1,3,4.5,4,4,3.5,"Bottled 2003 after being aged in an oak barrel for three years. Appearance: After a vigorous pour forms with thin large bubles and quickly fades away leaves behind an apple juice looking nectar. Aroma: So much exubrance of crazy aromas that probably shouldn't be in a beer, however this is a lambic. Tones of barnyard funk, acidic leathery qualities, woody finish fromt the oak barrel aging is evident, extreme in my book for being so different and traditional to this ancient craft. Taste: More stand offish when it comes to sourness, yes it is extremely sour but more mellow than other Cantillon products I sampled aggressive tartness blended with an oak flavor and tons of wild flavors barnyard in nature is how most describe this stuff. Mouthfeel: Medium body coats the palate with a dry finish, completely unique and hard to describe. Drinkability: Wow, not me I can't sit here and sip on it like a lemonade challenges my palate with many alien tones, but I see why this artform is so highly regarded I have a great respect for it.","WVbeergeek","Feb 02, 2004"
4.32,10.2,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"This is a great (and one of the few) examples of a traditional Lambic. This beer is one of the few chances for most to sample an unblended Lambic, and for this alone Cantillon is to be applauded. I do like this beer quite a bit. A bit of warning though, these flat bottles of Lambic need to be served warmer than usual, about 60*F (15*C), as I find uncarbonated Lambic needs to be a bit warmer than usual in order to fully express it's charms.","Gueuzedude","Feb 02, 2004"
3.93,0.3,2.5,4.5,4,3,4,"Corked and capped 750 ml bottle bottled 2003. Poured a golden color with light amber highlights. No head, no real carbonation to speak of at all. Barnyardy, old gym sock, malt vinegar, champagne like aromas. Sour and acidic, quite lactic tasting. Astringent with each sip.

4.6,17.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"750ml capped and corked bottle...2001 vintage: This is a dark golden colour with a huge head of fluffy white bubbles. The aromas are of a-typical gueuze-like tartness, and funky stuff, but this brew is much more subdued than the afforementioned gueuze. The taste is quite tart and funky with some lovely sweet and sour notes, and the undeniably amazing complexity of all of this breweries beers.

4.11,4.8,2.5,4,4.5,4,4,"This particular bottle poured completely flat -- not a bubble to be seen -- ahh well, you take your chances with these lambics, I suppose. Golden orange in color, with a slightly tart aroma that strikes one first as mostly tart, but then develops a tropical fruit like sweetness. The flavor, too, is tart and fruity, with a sweet mid-palateness and a re-assertive tartness to the finish. Pretty good as-is, but I'd love to see a better sample.","mzwolinski","Sep 01, 2003"
4.17,6.4,3.5,4,4,4,5,"The bottle reviewed was bottled in 1999. The head is not particularly attractive for this kind of beer, with an orange colour. The smell is horse sweat, aged leather (!). It's a flat lambic, quite quiet, with maybe a little lack of aggressiveness and naughtiness... It is advisable as an introduction to lambic.","stcules","May 27, 2003"
4.23,7.9,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Extremely fizzy from the start leaving a dense head of fine bubbles. Reddish gold in color. Horsey, tangy and slight metallicy twang hit the nose.

Not as dry as other examples of the style.","jreitman","Apr 13, 2003"
3.99,1.8,3.5,4.5,4,4,3.5,"Body is dull medium-light amber. The head forms easily and fades easily. The aroma is mulch or the loam in a forest, hint of horse blanket and ripe citrus or peach. The flavor: Basalmic vinegar and cotton candy (minus the sweetness). Salt and really thin, sour kumquats or oranges that aren't quite ripe yet, a little orange peel as well. A bit bitter in the finish. Is tart, but not as harshly tart as the Hanssens Oude Gueuze I had a few days ago. I didn't care for it to start with, but the more you drink, the easier it gets.","aracauna","Mar 05, 2003"
