review_text
"Poured a cloudy yellow body with abundant, effervescent carbonation bubbles and a one finger bubbly head. Overall impression of appearance is of a nice lambic in color, perhaps a bit too much carbonation for an unblended lambic, but quite on point for a Geuze. Scents of funky barnyard yeast, a bit of a smokey and enteric quality, which while usually demerits for a lambic are not unpleasant here, though these aromas fade quickly, replaced by light fruity, including citrus and apple, hints of honey, light hints of tea and mild honey aromas. Overall impression of aroma is of a sour ale that is quite nice, sour, wild, barnyard and fruity combine nicely to form a good aroma profile. Flavor begins highly sour with notes of barnyard funk, Kombucha tea, light lemon juice and light green apple. Middle is still sour, with notes of tea, Kombucha tea and barnyard funk with notes of hay. Finish is tart and somewhat dry with notes of hay, Kombucha tea, tea leaves and light green apple. Aftertaste is tart with notes of Kombucha tea, green tea and light fruity flavors. Overall impression of flavor is of a very funky, barnyard-forward sour with a very apparent Kombucha flavor also present. Unique and quite pleasant and refreshing. Mouthfeel is light bodied with high carbonation and a tart, puckering feel. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a light, highly carbonated sour that is quite refreshing. Overall this is a nice beer. Perhaps a bit too simple in flavor, but its aroma makes up for that, and the flavor is still quite nice. A good, refreshing beer and an interesting version of a lambic."
"So yeah. My first lambic. Sour. Tangy. Interesting and I'll need to try another lambic sometime but not sure these are going to be my jam. In part reserving my judgment because of the kombucha angle here. Lovely color though. Like a rosé."
"Prost!"

"Tart, acidic, musty, green apple, grapefruit rind, dry, somewhat cider-like, has all the good characteristics of both a lambic and kombucha."

"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, no bottle dating. Pours lightly hazy bright golden straw color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of tart lemon, pear, green apple, hay, straw, grass, herbal tea, wheat, leather, oak, musty funk, light vinegar, light pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/funky yeast, herbal tea, and oak notes; with good strength. Taste of lightly tart lemon, pear, green apple, hay, straw, grass, herbal tea, wheat, leather, oak, musty funk, light vinegar, light pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Very slight tartness/spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, pear, green apple, hay, straw, grass, herbal tea, wheat, leather, oak, musty funk, light vinegar, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity of fruity/funky yeast, herbal tea, and oak barrel flavors; with a great balance of the tea and lambic character with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and slightly acidic mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 3.5%. Overall this is a very nice spiced unblended lambic. All around good complexity and balance of fruity/funky yeast, herbal tea, and oak barrel flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"im not a big kombucha guy, so its hard to be objective about this one, which i have been looking at forever and afraid to try. surprised by its clarity, looks like champagne in the glass, clear yellow pale with a bit white bubbly head, very clean and neat fancy looking. the nose is brutal though, like straight yellow mustard, unappealing as it gets, acid and vinegar and cheap mustard. the flavor is far better, and the lambic is tasted ahead of the tea, which i appreciate. very very sour, and way more carbonated than anything else i have had from these guys. super dry and sour funky, but just too weird for me to get into or drink much of, sits weird in the belly, and now the tea really gets going. the carbonation is through the roof, and it seems to exacerbate the sourness of the beer. the flavor isn't all that bad, but i can't get past the yellow mustard nose, it turns the whole thing for me. i like the idea, and see it gaining in popularity with crooked stave and all, but it has yet to really catch on with me. maybe ill come around, maybe not."

"After craving something light and low octane, the sour/tart/funky taste is really doing it for me. I'm glad I picked this up today."
""
""
""
"O: An very interesting beer. The lambic and tea flavors actually blend very well. I wish it was a little bit less sweet overall, with a heavier emphasis on funk. It could have been better if they blended the Kombucha with a funkier lambic."
"Overall - Really kinda gross. Not the worst I've had though."
"overall I loved this one. would recommend to everyone ."

""
""
""
""
"Fantastic. This is an incredibly successful and delicious experiment."
""
"Bottle: Poured a light hazy golden color lambic with a medium size bubbly head with minimal retention and not much lacing. Aroma of tart notes with light funky notes. Taste is refreshing with easy drinking tart notes with some light funky notes. Kombucha tea was harder to detect. Body was about average with good carbonation. Nice refreshing drink for summer with just the right amount of complexity."

"0 - Decent offering with a few strange tastes but worth trying for sure."
"D - Interesting mix of flavors, but the balance is spot on. Very crisp and refreshing."
"Poured brilliant hazy yellow, like a deep lemon with a nicely formed white head in my Trappistes Rochefort chalice. Left a touch of lace as it diminished into a thin froth. The nose is quite nice with a huge bouquet. I felt like I was in a citrus stand on a fine mid morning in summer near a farm. Lots of tartness of lemon, orange, and acid that is meshed with the tiniest whiff of a well tended field behind a farm. The quaff is refreshing, crisp, and effervescent. I can easily down the whole glass but I do prefer to savor it. It pairs very well with shrimp cocktail. Overall, a steal for $12/750ml. I will pick up more next time I see it."
""
""
"Lighter medium body, slightly higher carbonation, bubbly and unfortunately lingering on the tongue. I think ""what the fuck is this?"" was the overall consensus on this beer. I've tried it more than once and hopefully this was the last time."

"I'm going to have to consider stocking up another bottle for myself down the line. Lambrucha was an enjoyable lambic, after all."

"Pours an almost hollow yellow with a fine whtie foam. Smells strait up brats & sauerkraut, sole lemons, nice traditional kombucha character, bits of pepper. I like the nose. Flavor is tart with black tea of the kombucha and a nice lemon tartness and a slight hit of meat and a good run of herbal and depthy character. Medium with a fun fizzy, nice wet finish. I like this beer."
"Pours a murky light orange with a foamy bone colored head that fades to nothing. No lacing on the drink down. Smell is sour, tart, and funky with some kombucha tea aromas. Taste is much the same with a pretty sour flavor and a mild spice finish. This beer has a high level of carbonation with a crisp and prickly mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and very interesting."
""
""
"Aroma resembles lemonade with a touch of white vinegar aroma and sure enough, a distinctive black tea emphasis. Flavor is again mostly tart puckery lemon with a black tea emphasis and a certain light mustiness that develops as the glass warms up towards room temperature. I like this... it's simple yet refreshing, acidic and tart without being too overwhelming to the gut, and the lemon / tea blend is a really nice combo."
"O: I like lambic and Kombucha, so I was very exicted to try this. It is a very interesting hybrid, the acidity is very good, for fans of the 2, I'd say get a bottle."
"Drinkability – Definitely not one my favorites. My wife liked it, but she loves Kombucha tea."
""
""
""
"Decent beer. Not worth the price but kombucha is expensive to begin with."
"Puckering sour yet fun, thanks for sharing Americo. Definitely some mushroom and rope with vinegar. Strong fruit and wild yeast aromas. Cloudy peach colour with a nice small head. For tart fans only, and even then a few ounces is all I could tolerate."
"Overall this is a pretty unique sour beer and the abv makes this more of a cider than anything."
""
"Notes: Light to moderate in body with a very clean mouthfeel. It's tart, but not overly so like some younger Lambics tend to be. Very refreshing, and although a bit pricey, It's a perfect sipper for on a hot day. Reminds me a bit of sumac tea. Definitely worth trying."
"O= This is one strange beer. Between the pickle taste and the tartness it's not too bad. I would actually buy this again and again for some reason. Strangly good."
""
""
"Very interesting! Poured at a good temperature with a smallish, off-white head that soon setted to nothing and no lace. Color is a slightly hazy yellow amber and no bubble trails. Aroma is tea, spice, malt and mild. Flavor's similar to nose and the lambic really comes out and works well with the tea. Body and carbonation are great. It's kind of a tea-geuze beer and nicely done. Excellent summer beer."
""
"It cleans off the palate during a meal and provides cultures to help you digest...perfect for eating with."
"M + D: Crisp, with an assertive and lightly sparkling carbonation. Like most sour styled beers, it has a very refreshing finish, with a nice hint of dryness, yet not as puckering as some. I found this to be a fantastic beer, and I hope to see other breweries experimenting with this style. In the meantime, I'll be happy with this."
""
"Beer is medium light with a fairly high carbonation level that settles as the beer ages in the glass. The result is a somewhat prickly feel that transitions to a smooth, light beer running across the palate. No puckering or tartness on the tongue or other parts of mouth."
"OVERALL: This is an interesting blend of flavors, and it makes for a good drink. Being a fan of sours, the tang of the De Troch base beer is better than ever in Lambrucha. For a beer of little ABV (3.5%) it packs a punch in the flavor dept. This could easily be set down in a cellar for years with no ill affect. Purveyors turned blenders Vanberg & Dewulf picked some nice barrels of sours to make this, hopefully there will be more experimentation to come."
"Overall: Very unusual and glad I tried it but doubt I would seek it out again; a bit bland for my palate"
"more so lambic yeast dominanated than kombucha and bone dry. very light in color coming in light yellow orange.. nose is crisp ashtray sour with what smells like tire inter tubes when still. mineral bare bones. palate is dry and hunger inducing. wondrous for such a low abv and of rather high standard. a sour most."
"Overall: Interesting but kind of on the fence. The flavor is mildly one-dimensional but still manages to be good."
"O: I really enjoyed this one but I am a regular drinker of kombucha (something that you can definitely tell is an ingredient in this beer). Very light and refreshing, I could drink this one all day long."
""

"I wish I could buy this beer in about five months to drink on a summer day. It was an interesting experience. I recommend trying Lambrucha."
""
"This is one of the most interesting beers I've ever tasted and very satisfying to drink. The whole 22 ounce bottle didn't even give me a buzz, so this one is eminently sessionable and refreshing enough to quench the thirst I built up walking from Penn Station over to East 36th...well worth the walk!"
"Weird, interesting, tasty."
""
""
"Cloudy cider gold. Finger of white head. Nice tart nose. Lemons and mild musty funk. Flavors are like lemon lime soda with some sweet tarts crushed in it. Hint of the tea in the finish. Light bubbly body. Super easy drinker. Maybe not a true sour heads delight. However I could see crushing an entire 750 on a hot summer day."
"O- The smell is probably the most intriguing part of the beer. The herbal notes are well-done and subtle. Overall, it's unique, delicate and hard to place. Still, it's not exactly my cup of tea. For the price I paid, I wish I was drinking a regular, funkier gueuze instead. Still, I'm very glad I tried this experiment. I have blended beer and kombucha in my brewing - mostly not very successfully - so I wanted to try this for a long time. I would be happy to brew something like this for refreshment ( with less herbal notes) and I would go through a keg easily over a few weeks. However at $14+tax a bottle, I don't think I can justify the cost very often. Also, I've not seen this beer very often."
"O: What a refreshing beer! Great concept, great delivery, great price. What's not to like?"
""
"O: very interesting beer and at 3.5% very sessionable. The drinkability is exceptionally easy. Could drink this all day!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a very drinkable beer. The 3.5% helps, but the tame tartness is quenching"
""
"O: I'm not really certain how to rate this beer. It's unlike anything I've had before. That being said, it is an intriguing and mostly enjoyable brew that is obviously crafted with care. I'd have no problem buying this again."
"Shared with a few friends on a Friday night. Pours a fairly clear pale golden color with a decent white head that shows moderate retention. Smells of tart and funk, no really. Lemons and yellow mustard mixed with truffles and barnyard. This is quite an odd aroma, but it kind of works. Taste is tart funk with a nice puckering of lemons dominating the flavor. Earthy barnyard mixed with fungi round out the flavor. Medium body, spirited level of carbonation and a puckering tart mouthfeel. I enjoyed trying this, but I couldn't see me drinking more than the 6 or so ounces I had in one sitting."
"Conclusion: I don't even know how to rate this beer. It feels a bit like it is in a class of its own, and I don't have anything to compare it too. Lambic is such a crazily broad style that I can't say that this beer fits or doesn't fit. I like beer like this, that just ""is"". I don't personally love the flavor of this beer, but I enjoy it enough to drink the rest of the bottle with pleasure. If only it were less carbonated..."
"The body is light and the carbonation is sharp. Overall this one isn't bad. I'd preffer it to be a bit less sweet."
"D - Quite enjoyable. I really like this combo together."
"A very odd, but not unappealing beer. More dryness is needed to bring the beer closer to balance, to increase drinkability, and to keep the beer from tasting like fruit flavored candies."
"Ov- Really surprised this came from De Troch lambic. I think the kambucha culture really kicked this one up. Hope to find it again."
"The mouthfeel was light with minimal carbonation, only a fine scrubbing prickle in the finish. This one is lacking something, maybe it's past it's prime. I would try it again."
"D-Pretty drinkable but it's a little one-note in the taste department, with lemon being that one-note. I was also hoping for some more acidity/sourness than is present in this one."
"A nice tart beer and quite refreshing. The flavor is a tad lacking and is one dimensional. Definitely worth a try."
"O- A damn good and very unique beer. I'm impressed, and this def. exceeded my expectations. I'll be buying more, and hope it's more than a one-off. Good stuff."
"O - This is a bit of a surprise for me. I went into this without a lot of expectations and actually thought it might be a bit gimicky...and maybe it still is. Not sure exactly what the tea added to this. However, I really enjoyed this beer - this makes for a good summer refresher - low alcohol and going down like lemonade. Definitely worth a shot...price point will likely keep me from getting this too often, but I see myself buying this again in the near future."
"Cheers!"
"I didn't think this combination would work as well as it does - the elements of both beverages are largely preserved and retain their own qualities while the combination is quite distinctive and ingenious. I generally hate when brewers really mess with tradition, but it's hard to find fault with this one."
"As for the test, this has a wine spritzer like quality. There are lots of lemony and orangey flavors, the beer is very sweet, very light, refreshing, and definite summery aide. I wasn't picking up strong hints of the tea but the lambic is very evident. This beer is very naturally carbonated, especially right after the first pour. Things mellow a bit shortly thereafter. The beer is very low ABV, which comes as no real surprise because there is zero booziness to this beer, not even hints. It's an interesting, fizzy, almost champaigne like experience at low ABV. This one does push the dimensions of how divergent and varied beer can be. It's unique but I won't be rushing out for more anytime soon."
"I love the concept of this beer. Lambic and kombucha is a great idea and works extremely well together. This beer iswell balanced between the sourness from the lambic and the tea. It is a beer I pick up almost every time i go to the liquor store, i just cant get enough of it."
"I really like this one; I might try to track another down for a refreshing beverage during a hot summer day."
"O- this is the most unique lambic i have ever encountered. more of a novelty thing. i dont think ill pick up another one anytime soon. drinking the entire thing has made my stomach feel uneasy and im usually unaffected by anything."
"The most important part about this beer is that my girlfriend would drink it all day and i could as well."
"Finally, my first review of an Unblended Lambic! I was lucky enough to find this at Dutch's outside of Cincinnati. It pours a rich and severely cloudy apricot orange in color with a bright white head that quickly dissipated. It smells of tea leaves, honey, and mint. It's a nice threesome and formidable enough. The flavors are pretty subtle and the flavor fades very quickly. It tastes of tea leaves plus a belgian pale plus souring yeasts. The mix is kind of strange and awkward. The finish is so fast you have to ponder what just happened. It has a lightly sour tinge that leaves a leafy, minty flavor behind but like I've said, it's short lived. It drinks a little too light and as I've stated, it finishes fast. It's hard for me to fully endorse. Is it a solid drink? Yes. Is it worth it worth the 8.99 price tag? Also a yes. It's two older styles combined to make an interesting beer. I say go for it."
"Overall: Very enjoyable and a charm at 3.5% abv. Well done. I'd love a few in the picnic basket."
"O: This beer definitely has a very unique smell and taste. I would definitely try this again if I have an opportunity to do so."
"(D)- A light, crisp and mild sour. Not really sure on how this fits into the traditional unblended lambic style, but I sure did enjoy this one's uniqueness for what it offers. At the same time, this is very inexpensive for the size of the bottle and what you get."
"I love this BIF already!"
"O: One of most interesting lambics I've tried in a while. Very focused and very easy to drink."
"Not extremely familiar with kombucha, but it definitely sounds intriguing, especially when some lambic is involved as well. This concoction pours a hazy amber-orange juice topped by a bit more than a finger of fairly rapidly-diminishing white foam. The nose comprises orange peel, lemon zest, coriander, black pepper, parsley, clove, and limeade. The taste holds notes of lemon, lime, green apple, cinnamon, mild pepper (by this I mean hot, a la jalapeno or something), cilantro, and lightly tart green grapes. The body is a light medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a sticky feel. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this unique brew. I'm not sure I'd actively seek it out very often, but it is a very nice change of pace."
"The appearance is a orange cloudy body with a white frothy head. The nose is a bready orange combination with some lemon lime citrus in the back and some slight pepper and vinegar on the nose as well. It may sound hodgepodged, but it' actually really nice. The flavor carries the bready yeast flavor with it. The flavor I most prominently get is an orange-cinnamon flavor. There is a touch of the lemon tartness that carries throughout the body. I find everything about this beer to be greatly appropriate for both its style and my taste buds, it's a very good beer."
"I finally got to stop in at the raved-about, The Map Room and immediately felt right at home. Amazing tap & bottle selection. This place warrants a visit all on it's own, but a quick stop for a Vanberg & DeWulf's Lambrucha was just what I needed to strip away all the Mexican fats & flavors of Arturo's tacos. It's probably one of the most refreshing beers I have ever tried! Two of my favorite yeasty fermented flavors (lambic & kombucha) blended into one low ABV, palate cleansing beverage. Highly recommended if you can find it (apparently it's only currently available in Chicago)."
"D: I liked this, which didn't really surprise me, but considering what it really is, I don't think I would buy much of this at a fairly high cost."
"D: regardless of the weird sulfur characteristics all around it was still pretty drinkable but wasn't as tasty as I thought it would be."
"You would never know theres was any tea used. Maybe it helps subdue some of the barnyard funky I maight have tasted. But I just get a mild puckery palate and some green apple skins."
"Even though this is not a beer that I'll bring home again (especially not at $9.99 per), it's an enjoyable taste of summer sunshine on a day when the mercury will struggle to reach double digits. Bottom line: probably worth the price for those who love the style."
"d-Can't stop drinking this beer due to the flavor which is refreshing. Its very low alcohol which helps too."
"Golden clear with no head or lace, this doesn't look like much. The nose is actually pretty enjoyable. Lemon and tea are most noticeable, there's a herbal tea tannin character with mild spices. The kombucha contribution is rather noticeable. As it warms up, I get some spruce and juniper, this is mildly gruit like. The palate is the same, with more tea tannin, bright sour lemon and a drying finish that's got herbal tea and lemon peel. Light body, moderate carbonation, the finish is drying and tart. Solid stuff, this is pretty darned refreshing and quenching. I would drink this again."
"This is certainly an interesting combination, despite the similarities between kombucha and Lambic, I feel that the former dominates the flavor and aroma profile of this blend. Perhaps this is due to the simplicity of the lambic that was blended in. This is extremely light and refreshing and this definitely goes down quite easily on a warm summer's day. This last and the fact that it is an interesting use of kombucha are the main selling points for this. Worth trying, but I can't seriously see myself getting this again, but I am also not a huge kombucha person."
"Much better than I expected. Pleasant to drink albeit not very complex. Could see having a few of these on a hot day while gardening or just sitting in the shade."
"m+d- it is a touch watery. especially at the end of the sip. but I would call it a successful experiment by the brewery. cheers."
"Bottle. Very clean aroma, slightly herbal and medicinal. Very clear with a pinkish hued color. Very clean and neat taste. A nice blend of a lambic and a unsweetened tea. Not sour in really any sense of the word. Fairly carbonated. The tea flavor really doesn't come through extremely strong but is more like a tea you would get at a chinese restaurant with a lambic twist. Decently carbonated but the head quickly dissapates."
"Overall, this beer would be great on a hot summer day. Very refreshing and drinkable. I enjoyed this one."
"D- One and I was done. Never again for me, but I wouldn't mind sharing with others. People said they might like to try it again in the future, but it wasn't what they wanted on that visit. Maybe I was thinking too much of my tea adventures in my house and was let down. Once again I'll try it, but probably not for a while."
"D: all around this is a nice supper and good on a hot summer afternoon. Thanks, Alex."
"D-this is a solid beer, lots of good fruits and a nice spice balance with notes of acidity. easy drinking beer and quite good."
"D - Excellent brew. My favorite Kombucha, G.T.'s Kombucha, has been pulled off of shelves by the FDA as a result of a Lindsay Lohan (seriously!) instigated investigation into alcohol content in the G.T.'s. This Lambrucha quenched my considerable Kombucha thirst, while passing muster relative to my high esteem for Lambic."
"wow. great concept. avante guarde and it works for me. hazy burnt gold with some glowing pink highlights. white head that fades pretty quick. Nose is barn, wet hay, lemon, preserved lemon, lemon rind, grapefruit, spice, minerals... sort of like a lambic, but sort of like something else. this is a very tough beer to review, and it must be even harder for people with no experience with kombucha. taste is tart/sour preserved lemon, wet hay/ barn and kombucha. perfectly blended to me. very good job. the line is blurred between what is beer and what is ""tea"" (or adjunct), and generally, that is the point in specialty/adjunct beers. light-medium body that seems beefed up by the prickly carbonation. supremely refreshing and super easy to drink. think gose, geuze, berliner-weisse with a little twist. great value as well as being a little milder than some of it's relatives, leaving your palate craving for more abuse. it may sound strange, but this beer reminds me of Miles Davis' Bitches Brew. It may seem harsh and biting to someone that doesn't know what they are getting in to, or to a mind that isn't open, but the raw, primal, living essence and soul of this beer speak volumes about where we've been and where we're going. extremely complex and flavorful for a beer with such a low abv. i'll be drinking several of these this summer. AND>>> I agree about this beer being classified wrong. NOT just an unblended lambic. way way way more."
"D- Wonderfully tart, crisp and refreshing on a hot summer day. Very drinkable, and AMAZINGLY rich in aroma/flavor for such a low alcohol beer!!!"
"The taste is an intense grapefruit/lemon tart and sourness. There is just a ton of lemon taste to this beer. The tea influence then becomes noticeable. This beer just is the most interesting mindfuck of a beer I've ever had. These two fermented beverages blend perfectly in my mind and I absolutely love this beer and think this isn't the last you see of beer and kombucha blended together."
"This is an interesting experiment. I would not drink it again though. I did not enjoy it. I wonder if the Lindemann's tea lambic is similar to this."
"As an addendum, sure seems like there's a lot of bottle to bottle variation based on the reviews. Some call this very funky, and others non-buggy. Maybe it's a reference issue, or maybe the yeast and bacteria were not well distributed prior to bottling. I wouldn't mind finding a funked up version of this myself."
"D- It is quite easy to drink. The alcohol is very low, its quite refreshing and to me its not offensive. It is strange and it might not be everyone's cup of tea. (no pun intended)."
"This beer has a medium body which is on the lighter end of the spectrum and tastes more like a lambic than the aroma suggests. Very spicy up front with tight carbonation and hints of zesty pepper along with a slight puckering tartness which quickly fades into a slightly creamy lactic center. Dry finish. The vinegary presence from the aroma is the only sour/funky element of this beer but it is overpowered by the heavy spice presence and earthy tea leaf flavor. Also, some slight acidity. The tea leaves provide a slight tartness but really is just very earthy and unpleasant. An interesting idea that doesn't work so well."
"D- Pretty different here. Glad I got to try it, but I don't think I'll ever have this one again. Its easy to drink just not my thing."
"This is one of those things that defies what is. Try it."
"I love that this is under 4%, I wish I drank more beer light like this, but a whole bottle would practically kill me, Im up for the challenge though. Lamby is tasty stuff that's worth a single bottle purchase. The tea works well with this tart young lambic, an interesting remix."
"D- very easy drinking mild as far as sour and not to buggy. Nice light stuff. I like it. I'm interested to see what else the can do with this idea."
"Drinkabiliy was good. Not great because I could see getting bored by the end of the bottle and certainly not wanting any more after that. This was pretty unique, though, and one I'm glad to have tried!"
" M- This beer has a light mouthfeel with a tight fizz in the finish. D- This beer has a nice tartness that is a bit light like a sweet-tart candy more so as the beer warms. The tea blends nicely with the lambic and it will make a great beer in warm weather."
"If you are a huge tea fan, you might like this, otherwise it sucks."
"This is probably the best Lambic based product to come out of De Troch, though i've never tried their Cuvee Chapeau Gueuze."
