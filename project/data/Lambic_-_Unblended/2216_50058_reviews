"On draft at 3 Fonteinen last October. I can't believe I forgot to review this. Drank this while chatting away with Armand and his brother in the restaurant. What an experience. The beer is hazy orange to copper hued and appears still. Earthy, mushrooms, grass, farm, funk. Light and smooth. Refreshing and delicious. Complex yet simple. What a day. A memory I shall cherish forever."

"Had on tap at the pub. Pour is a dark golden amber color, mostly transparent with very little white head on the edges. The nose is light cob web funk, sweet caramel transitions into sweet peach, orange and citrus, with a sour note accompanying. The flavor has more dusty funk, creamy lacto aspects, very strong sweetness in back, tart sour lemon, citrusy orange, peaches, and light bitterness. Creamy medium body with a soft palate and fairly assertive carbonation with a dry finish. Great balance to this, very sweet and assertively sour, less funk than I thought going in but will add a nice dimension to a future gueuze."

"This is quite fantastic all around and I could easily drink a lot of this. The nose is so incredibly complex and even though the taste is not nearly so, it is so refreshing and balanced that I hardly care."
