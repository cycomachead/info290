"O: good, but flat and somewhat lifeless"
"Light body with just a touch of carbonation and a light bit of acidity. Very tasty."
"He also has other lambiks, brewed by Frank Boon, and Girardin to his recipe. They're quite good, but not as stellar as Armand's lambik."
"O/D - A good Lambic. The aggressive sourness might be an issue for more than one or two but it was still quite good. Refreshing and tasty on a lovely Summer day in Belgium. Very complex."
"O: I have never had a lambic with this much age, and it was nice to explore what time in a bottle does to drie fonteinen lambic!"
"The body was like water, literally in this case. It was not something I'll want again but was very nice to gain some appreciation for the progression in making a world class gueuze."
"I couldn't have asked for a better beer after that long walk in the rain. The Drei Fonteinen's young lambik poured a pretty amber color with a thick and creamy white head. Carbonation was almost non-existent and the beer had a generally flat appearance aside from the froth. Vinous aroma that isn't shy on woodiness. Tart and dry with white wine and lactic notes. Balanced and easy going with a touch of citrus flavor in the finish."
"sampled on cask at the brewery's restaurant. dark orange in color with a nice, thick head that lasts. smells tart and sweet, complexities showing immediatly. beautiful balance of sweet and dry flavors. finishes with a tartness, and dry enough to make me want more."
" This was the second straight Lambic that I had ever had, it was again far mellower than I was expecting. Of course it was 'sans-carbonation' (say it with a Cajun man accent its much more fun that way) and had a quite noticeable acidic aroma. The acidity promised in the nose was surprisingly subdued in the taste. It was much more of a balanced / mellow acidity, which I am surmising, was the result of a bit of age that helps to smooth out Lambics. The beer itself was quite a revelation. There was a fair amount of musty character, and an appetizing hint of mushroom and a bit of character nabbed from a proper strong stinky farmhouse cheese. All in all it was a great aperitif for the impending gastronomic exercise that I was about to have."
