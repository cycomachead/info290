"Pours an energetic ruby tinged amber with incredible, very fine carbonation. The head rises to about one to one and a half fingers and then quickly recedes. It is very unusual to find such fine, champagne-like carbonation with the light beer body to hold the bubbles together and produce such a fine mouthfeel. The aromas include some fruit and citrus – maybe grapefruit punctuated by a little barnyard. There are so many tastes, they are so well blended and balanced and they create such a flow of flavor in your mouth that it is hard to identify them all. There is a little fruit, malt, and a couple of different hop aspects. You can taste both the old lambic hops (dull, stale with a lot of tannins) with the fresher hop character (spicy and bitterer). The beer also has a wine-like quality to it as well as the kind of oak you would get with an oaky chardonnay. The tartness balances well with the different varieties of the hop. The tannins from the old hops and the bitterness and spiciness from the newer hops, the lemony/grapefruity tartness, and the barnyard funkiness all blend together in a very amazing way."

"Intense sourness from the very beginning, but more complex than the usual lambic with the help of a well developed malt foundation. Creates a vivid, tart mouthfeel, driven by a dough, leathery funkiness. The taste inherits both, green apples and musty white grapes among a gentle amount of white citrus peel, accompanied by their earthier stonepits. Malts turn even more intense during the finish, calming the brews lactic acidity, while creating a very interessting counterpart to citrus peel and mild hops."
"December 2013 bottling. Taster at a share."

"Had this one at the source: Cantillon Brewery itself. Pours golden, clear, with a nice fluffy white head on top and lots of floaties (got the bottom of the bottle here). Aroma is straw, a bit of tripel-like funky yeast, some vinegar, dryness. Flavor follows closely with funky yeast, straw hops notes, pears, apples, dryness on the finish with lingering grass and yeast funk together. Very light bodied, super crisp, and pretty refreshing. Unique brew with plenty of sour, but also an interesting note with the addition of the cold hopping. Liked this significantly more than I even expected. Good stuff."

"Overall (4.25), an really nice beer from Cantillon that stands out from their other beers for the higher presence of hop characteristics. Given that it's unblended, I can only imagine that the beer itself changes somewhat from year to year, with the fermentation being spontaneous. I would be curious to sample other vintages to see how different it actually gets."
"Sweet and sour tart right up front. A sense of sour funked out candied peaches and apricots that were left out in a damp basement for a few weeks. Tiny hint of some raspberries. Almost like a pollen filled spring day in a meadow. Fizzy carbonation (just right) leaves a perfect dryness to the finish. Almost champagne-like. Mild hop bitterness (as compared to American beers) dance well with the aforementioned flavors. A star! My first Cantillon- Enjoying in Le Maraise in Paris! Will go back and get more methinks."

"totally different stuff from cantillon here. all barley malt instead of some amount of wheat in here make it quite a bit more sturdy then their lambic types, and the hops are definitely more aggressive in flavor, although still really mild, especially by American standards. the beer has a darker caramel color to it, plenty of hazy as per usual with cantillon, and a tall and lasting dull muted whited head of tiny bubbles. the nose is more funk than sour, with some textured sweetness in there, and then of course the oaky mature lacto thing to finish. the taste is just like the nose, exactly like it, with the barley malt influencing this beer more in terms of body I think than flavor. the hops have an earthy dried herbal character to them than likes the bigger body, and carbonation is effervescently bright. I like the slightly richer feel to this, and the longer finish not usually there in their lambic. maybe a little less unique and distinct than some of their other beers, like say fou foune or the lou pepe fruit beers, but I think its quality is as good as any, and its definitely a new direction for them. stoked to have shared this bottle with my brother, who loves sours and wilds but until now has never had a beer from cantillon. we both really enjoyed it."

"O: This is the driest of all the Cantillons I have tried (which is not that many!). This was a real treat, a beer to be sipped and enjoy over a long period of time."

"Overall a nice lambic slightly maltier than the norm with a noble hop bitterness throughout. Delicious now but only gets better with age :)."

"75 cl bottle poured into a tulip glass. A murky ruddy orange-amber hue with almost no head once everything settles out, just a speckling of white bubbles floating there. There is a neat effect where a sip leaves some lacing composed of tiny bubbles that evaporate almost instantly. Sublime aroma, decidedly funky and sour with assertive lime, lemon, horse blanket, aspirin, flower shop, root cellar, and white wine all vying for one's attention but with nothing sticking out in an unpleasant fashion. Palate is similarly complex yet dominated by dry and sour hop and wild yeast elements with pretty minimal sweetness aside from a faint tinge of caramel, discernible in the finish if you concentrate. I get apple cider vinegar, lemon and lime peel/rind, baby aspirin, champagne, tannic grape skins, horse blanket or dry canvas sheet (seems like an apt descriptor, sorry!), and a general forest floor earthiness from start to finish. Supremely tasty sour and more pungent than some other common examples I've tried from Petrus and Rodenbach. No sugar in this sucker. The label is careful to state that this is not a lambic, which is interesting, probably on the basis of the lack of wheat and hopping regime. Very low carbonation but not flat, airy light body and a massively sour finish that manages to hit woody, hard candy, and hay elements before descending into a super-tannic green apple and white wine vinegar finale. What a beer. For some reason my ratings seem high but shall stand. I agree with Jeff Sparrow in ""Wild Brews", this bridges the gap between lambic and American sours nicely."
""

"I am pretty sure this is my favorite beer on the planet. I just simply cannot bring myself to give anything a perfect score because what is perfect? Call me jaded, call me what you will, but there is always room for improvement, no matter how subtle."

"Orangey amber color, fluffy foam beige head that diminishes and aroma of sour yeast, barnyard, citrus rind. Taste is tart lemon rind, grapefruit, woody, yeasty, with light malt & caramel notes and some lingering bitterness. Smooth mouthfeel, medium bodied, soft to medium carbonation, dry sour finish. Complex and tasty, very drinkable."

"The only thing I can say about this beer that is not absolutely perfect is the fact that there are one or two cantillons that are even better than this one. Its a fantastic sour and its pretty tart but not too bad. The balance is on par with most of Cantillons stuff so you really can't go wrong. Thinking about ordering this from belgiuminabox"
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall this beer is a giant war head. It is so sour that my lips pucker with every sip. It is suprising that there is almost no barnyard or goat in the aroma of taste. It was good but I would not call it one of the best beers that I have ever had, even in its catagory, it is just too sour."

"O: Familiar yet different, I really enjoyed this beer. My girlfriend took a sip and had a puzzled look while stating ""kind of tastes like an IPA?""... the hops really makes this interesting and I'm glad for the variety, though it doesn't make it necessarily better than other Cantillons. I really enjoyed it, but I'd go for a Rose or Kriek first."
""
""
""
""
""
"Interesting sour that is quite different from the others I've had. Tasty, sour with a nice complexity. Might be a little too bitter for me in comparison to the lambics I'm used to. Glad I tried this one though; don't know if I'll go after this one again as I would the more well-known Cantillon lambics."

"Probably the best beer I had on Zwanze Day,(although I actually liked Zwanze more than many people). I'd been waiting for this for quite some time, and it did not disappoint. Perfect blending of sourness and citrus flavors, super smooth, and very complex despite the low abv. I'm sure it's great in a bottle, but it's just amazing on tap. Loved it."
"O-The dry hopping was an interesting addition to this beer, yummy but a tad different than the others."

"Poured a bloodred brown (if that makes any sense) with practically no head or lace. Very sour and tart aroma, but thankfully the beer isn't as sour/tart/unbalanced as the somewhat wineline aroma. There is some funky spice and there's a touch of sweetness and oakiness that balances the sour, tart flavors of mostly cherry and touch of grape. Not a big red wine drinker but this reminded me of some light reds (no heavy merlots or cabs). Wish I could describe it better but it is a must try and enjoyable sipper."
""
""
""
""
""
"Smooth yet lactic feel, aroma is of wood and cherries flavor is much the same but with some sour strawberries thrown in. Tiny bit of sweetness, not really tart, well balanced. This is some serious good stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"This seems more sour than some of the normal Geuze that I've had...and it seems to get more sour with age. Buy it if you can find it!"

"Another winner from Cantillon. Heavy funk, heavy tartness, and a good meshing of fruits, bugs, and vinous flavors. The dry hopping with fresh hops is surprisingly more noticeable than I thought it would be. Certainly there would be consequences in the form of acid reflux and stomach ulcers if you decide to tackle a 750 mL bottle solo, but believe me, when you try it, you're not gonna want to share."
""
"Overall - Interesting experiment, but I prefer regular lambics over this. A lot of complexity is lost."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL: Really nice and very well balanced. The nose could be a little more present, but the flavor really delivered. A good dose of acidic sourness that's balanced really well with the hoppy bitterness this one provides. Even though my overall score might not suggest it, this one is well worth the effort. Highly recommended."
""
""
"O: I guess(?) I'm glad I tried it, but never would again -- especially for this price. I'm not sure I 'get' it. Something is going on, but what? Paired with Fiscali cheddar."

"Pardon my lower rating, but when it comes to Cantillon, I try to be as objective as possible and ignore the overhypage. Not sure what year this bottle was--I think it was 2011 or 2012--and it had some of that gnarly sediment on top of the cork. Hazy orange-yellow pour, effervescent, with a small, fizzy, white head; moderate retention and a bit of lacing. Aroma had a funky sourness to it, wet grass, citric acid and floral notes, some woodiness. There was a rather subdued sourness up front in the taste, lemon pith and grass, horseblanket, notable (and somewhat unpleasant) hop bitterness, floral and somewhat vegetal notes, raw celery, bitter and a bit medicinal in the finish. Dry mouthfeel, light-medium to medium in body. It's decent, but not really my thing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - ok, Cantillons are difficult to rate.... They, to a large extent, are all a celebration of barnyard funk, vinegar, sour, tart, and refreshing. However, it's just by the end of a shared bottle you find yourself thinking, jeez this is just great beer."
""
"O: A very unique lambic. It gives a nice burst of initial tart/sour and then transitions into a beer that focuses more on the malts and hops with the tart notes in the background. Unexpected, but yet another great beer from Cantillon"

"O-This is a tasty, but slightly different beer. I really enjoyed the cognac hints that I kept detecting on the nose and in my mouth. Although this beer is less tart than the base lambic on which it is based, the acidity is still here and would make this beer pair wonderfully with food."
""
"Served in a tulip. Appearance is pale orange, like the color of apple juice. Smells like cheese aging in a damp tack room in an old barn. Tastes of lemon, crap apple, hints of different hop profiles come through--more so than any lambic I've had, which stands to reason considering it was brewed with fresh hops, than dry hopped later--rounds out with the sweet side of grapefruit. Not much lacing."

"O: A fantastic beer. Perhaps my new favorite Cantillon. Wish I had multiple bottles because I could sit around and drink this like a session beer all day."
""
"O: Not overtly sour and still very hoppy. This was an interesting take on a lambic and I really enjoyed it. I'd like to revisit some later and early vintages to have a comparison since my first experience is with this beer being 6 years old."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a really interesting beer. This is the first spontaneous fermentation I've had with a real noticeable hop presence, and I have to admit it works well. Not my favorite Cantillon beer, but still very good."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - unusual Lambic. Hop forward for the style. Thick body for the style. Pleasant flavors with a nice balance. Less sour and funky than Cantillon Gueuze, but that isn't a complaint. Complex beer that was a pleasure to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"An interesting lambic with a very different flavor profile that is dominated by the malt body and the floral hops, not the funk. I liked it, it is a very different lambic and I would love to see how it ages."

"Overall. My least favourite of the Cantillon beers so far, but still a nice beer. Interesting for sure, and an experience as this brewery's beer always is. I've heard this is nice when aged, I'll wait 5 or so years to try my other bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
"Cheers."
""
"On-tap. 1/2pt glass. Enjoyed on mar´13. Amber color & foggy appearance. Yellowish froth leaves a thin layer on top. Yeast, citric/acidic & fresh bread aromas. Floral hues. Mild toasted malting & bread at first sip is overwhelmed by increasing tartaric touch. Light body but voluptuous palate. Moderate carbonation. Moderate hops in the middle. Long sweet/acidic finish. Grapefruit notes on the aftertaste. Delightful & refreshing."
""
"This poured out as a deep golden color with a light haziness to it. There are plenty of bubbles rising to the top of the beer that forms a generous white head on top. The retention is pretty strong but the lacing is minimal. The smell of the beer is funky, it's slightly acidic and has a bit of oak on the nose too. The taste of the beer is tart at first, it settles down as you drink it and the sweetness comes through a little more. There is plenty of fruity acidic elements in the flavor with the malt balancing it out a little. The mouthfeel of the beer was much thicker than I expected, I was surprised by it's thickness. Good amount of carbonation as well making this beer come to life. Overall it's a pretty good brew, it had some surprising elements to it which made this really enjoyable."
""
""
"O- 8/10 sourness. Good sour, very different with the no fruit added and dandelion/floral notes."
""
""
""
""
"Such an awesome and nearly pefect, but unique, beverage. As nearly all cantillon brews, this is more than worth it."
"O - Overall, yeah, you know what you're getting with Cantillon. Just an excellent beer and so well crafted."

"Enjoyed while attending Cantillon Zwanze Day 2012 at Avenue Pub! Served from bottle into a wine glass. Poured a hazy yellow-orange with a one finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet mat, funk, sour, earth, floral, and pepper. The flavor was of sweet malt, floral, sour, tart, funk, fruit, spice, and pepper. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. Surprisingly I had never had this beer before grace my palate. I have quite a few set aside, but had no comparison about how it tasted fresh and how it will be aged. At least now I can answer the first part of that. I really enjoyed this one quite a bit. The pepper aspect was definitely a nice touch as it mixed really well with the funkiness going on here. Another solid offering from Cantillon."
""
""
"Pours a beautify orange/amber color with a 1.5 finger thick white foamy head. The smell is lemony with a bit of orange. The taste reflects the aroma with some grassiness to balance out the acidity a little. Still pretty acidic and has a hint of bitterness. Fairly sour and a little drying in the mouth and throat (not unusual for a sour). Mouthfeel is pretty much perfect. The carbonation helps alleviate some of the excess acidity in the beer."
""
"O- my first cantillion .... probably not my last... very pleasing for all the hype behind this brewery and they definitely delivered the goods..."
""
""
"This is the one I was waiting to try. I received Iris brett isolates from a guy who harvested yeast from the dregs of a 2007 bottle. I’ve got them on a lambic at home right now that I brewed and never having had this beer it was a must try so I had something to go by. It was much darker burnt orange than any of the other Cantillon offerings I had had the day of the tasting. Lots of floral notes in the nose, my guess would be from the late hop additions this beer receives. Had a really nice sweet, green apple tartness to it. This beer also had a more pronounced maltiness. I also noticed this beer had a much heavier mouth feel than the other traditional lambics that were tried. Overall I like to taste the difference of this beer with the different grain bill and hop additions against the traditional lambics."

"A fantastic beer. Not a true lambic, but superbly crafted nontheless. The spontaneous fermentation gives it a sour, funky character with amazing depth. My only (slight) complaint is that the hops are too subtle and attenuated - was hoping for more in the aroma. When I had this on tap in Brussels it seemed hoppier, but perhaps the time that has passed has allowed the hop notes to fade. I suspect this is a beer best consumed young. Anyway, another quality offering from Cantillon and well worth your time. Grab one if you come across it."
""
"Side note: I laugh at my notes of smell and taste on this as I was quite the rookie back then and, sadly, could not do this beer justice with a proper review. As such, I've committed to re-reviewing it as I have some 2003 bottles aging for a special occasion."
""
"O: This beer is a bit of an oddity, but I really liked the way it worked."
""
""
""
"But finish is usual Cantillon --- sharp and dry! Interesting and unique but not necessarily my favorite."
"Overall: Very nice twist on a normal lambic. The extra pale malt and hops add makes it different and interesting."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Different for Cantillon, definitely hoppier from the fresh hopping that they do to the beer. Definitely like it, would be interested to taste it with some age."
"O-Never had this before, but I am a big fan of this. I enjoy the floral character of the beer quite a bit and it adds some nice complexity to the lambic."
"The beer pours a rich looking, cloudy amber with a thin, yet consistent, blanketing of a tan head. The nose is herbal and tart with just enough sweetness. The taste is rather harsh and the herbal characteristics in the nose are blunted by the beer's intense sour tartness. The mouthfeel is tart and acidic, but not overwhelmingly sour. The aftertaste is a mix of sweet and sour with a slightly lingering bitterness, and tons of acidity. Not the best cantillon I've had and I'm not sure what the hype is...still a good sour."
"O - Very tasty, lively and tart. Try it if you can, you will enjoy it."
"Solid beer and one I'd be glad to pick up any day."
""
""
""
"again, another smash home from Cantillon. I've only had two of their beers, can't wait to explore them all."
"Overall: Iris is a fantastic lambic - I will certainly be having a ton more of this in the future."
""
""
"Highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Verdict: Absolutely wonderful lambic from Cantillon and I feel like a broken record saying that. The hops really make this a unique treat, it adds a great fruit component that goes so well with the milder funk character."
""
""
""
"Definitely among the best beers I've ever had, as evidenced by the straight 5's. I think this being aged a couple years and on tap puts it over the top. If you get the chance, try it; you won't be disappointed."

""
"O: Absolutely drinkable. One of the best Cantillons I've ever had"
""
"Overall, a very complex and interesting beer. Body is limp but I suppose that is how it is supposed to be. Smell and taste are great. Pretty remarkable."
"Good beer. Opended the bottle to find a little liquid beer on top of the cork and a little gas fizzing out thru it. Poured at good temperature with huge, fluffy, thick, cream-colored head that settled after a bit and some lace. Color is a clear amber with a single lazy bubble trail. Aroma is tart sweet with a barest hint of hop. Flavor's like nose and again hop is in the background, more bitter. Body is a little soft as a result of low carbonation. Does have a few high point from the bitter/yeast combination, but it's not offensive. Finish is like flavor and relatively long."
"Says 2007 on the label. Cork says bottled 2009. Pours a murky, amber-reddish orange with a large white head that takes some time to go down. Scent is very funky (it's Cantillon, what did you expect?). Floral hoppiness with some sweet stone fruits and green apple. A bit of grass along with intense sour aroma. Taste is very tart at first. Very sour in the middle, with a surprisingly bitter/hoppy finish. The most hoppy Cantillon I have ever had, but work really well as it remains extremely funky and sour. Slightly earthy and grassy. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, somewhat fizzy, and highly carbonated. Drinkability is very high. Overall, this is another great Cantillon. They never let down."

"Tart and acidic, bitter earthyness with some hops at the end. Yeasty as hell, crazy complex. Wish I bought more of these when they were abundant on the shelf :("
""
"2007 vintage and I'm curious to how a fresh bottle or a very old version would differ, not cheap in these parts so I may or may not find out"
"O: Another awesome beer from the masters of the style. I could drink this every day. Perhaps I should move to Belgium… Cheers!"
""
"O- A really interesting beer, highly drinkable, great stuff."
""
"O – I really enjoyed this. Not as “clean” as some of the lambic blends, but I’m glad I tried a relatively fresh bottle, as the hop bitterness complements the lambic characteristics very nicely. Tasty."

"Drinkable sour and extremely flavorful Cantillon. Reminiscent of the gueuze but the differences are certainly there."
"Bottled (75cl) February 2011, the beer pours hazy amber with a blond tint of dissipating head. The nose is clean and complex of floral jasmine, juniper berry perfume, citrus fruit, hops and wood. On the palate Iris liberates razor sharp acidity, a well structured medium body, slight bitterness and even a subtle sweetness. Characteristics of grapefruit, lemon peel and jasmine comes to mind followed by a long aftertaste of perfume and hops. Balanced and refreshing! http://quaffable.org/?p=11"
"O: I just wanted this to be more sour. I guess I didn't appreciate this different take on the style this time around, as previously I didn't mind it at all. Still would try it again. 3"
""
"Pours a slightly murky honey orange with a tan head that fades to wisps of film on top of the beer. No lacing on this one. Smell is sour, tart, and funky with some nice hoppy aromas. Taste is the same with an almost minty flavor on the finish. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good lambic with a nice hop presence."
""
""
""
"Overall - A nice Cantillon, but far from my favorite of their offerings."
""
""
"Pours a bright orange with an off white head of about half an inch that stayed thought the first glass. The smell is nothing but sour ith just a hint of alcohol. Taste is crazy good. Sour, bitter, and slightly sweet all at the same time. Sour enough to give you the twinge in your jaw, but the the slightly sweet comes through to mellow the twinge. The mouthfeel is very light and foamy, just as it should be. Overall, another wonderful sour from Cantillion."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Very enjoyable. I wonder how many pours I'll be able to have until I've reached my limit."
""
"Iris pours an auburn color, with an off white head. Good lacing on my tulip glass. The nose is wet hay, oak, grass, hops and funk. Really amazing/complex smell. Excellent. The taste is the same profile as the nose w/ some pepper added into the mix. The feel has a pepper bite, with good acidity, and mellowness around the edges. Overall, an amazing 6 year old beer- Really glad I got to try this one. Cheers."
""

""
""
"I could have drank this all day. It really makes me appreciate the less sought after loons. This does the trick. I had some 5 years aged Iris on tap not to long ago and this blew it out of the water. I think this is a more recent vintage. Great stuff."
"Light to medium body, no carbonation, but that is expected for an unblended lambic. Pretty interesting beer, but I'm not sure aging this one was idea as some of the dry hopping would have probably helped brighten up the flavorl."
""
""
""
"Great nose with plenty of funk. Another good beer from Cantillon. Wish it were more available."
"O- Another great beer from Cantillon. Really look forward to all the offerings from them. Wish this shit wasn't so friggin expensive though."

" The dry sharp flavor with lots of acidity is in the taste right off the bat with hops and oak that give a mild cedar like aromatic wood element w/ mellow bark and almost grapefruit like sour fruit in the tertiary. The woody and citrus combo is intense with both sour and bitter blending to give a bitter herbal and lemon rind taste which also has a gentle oak accent. The hops seem to come out more toward the finish as the woody sour flavors are all over the entry to middle taste. The taste is so puckering w/ light bitter leafy edge it seems at times like a juxtaposition and others like a wierd tug of war. The drinkability is not that high for me, it is interesting and intense, but overall seems like an assault on the palate without any where to retreat, this stirs the acid in the stomach and is a bit overwhelming mixed with other lambics enjoyed, it just comes off too sharp ...it would be difficult to have multiple samples in my opinion."
""

"O/D - Wish I had a bigger pour and more time to contemplate this one. I remember it being very good the first time I tried it and it being quite an eye opening experience. A pleasure to revisit."

"This is a medium bodied brew with a lively level of modest to high carbonation. There is not much abv impact but the combination of sourness and herbal bitterness is very trying on the palate. I enjoyed this but the combination of bitterness and sourness overall degraded this brews drinkability for me. Even though this brew was split equally between 4 people, I had a hard time finishing my ~5-6 oz. To this brews credit it was very unique with bold enjoyable barrel character. I wouldn't mind having a fresh one of these for comparison."

"Upon popping the cap the cork was instantly saturated with lambic. The beer pours a light bodied amber in color with a light white lacing around the glass. It appears that it may be slightly oxidized. The aromas consist of perfume like qualities, floral acid, and moderate vinegar. It tastes quite acidic and has a particular spiced bite to it. It does have some floral and tea components as well. It's interesting to say the least. It drinks light in body and dries out your palate, yet not as much as other Cantillons. Overall it's an interesting beer and worth a try. I'm curious to know why they named the beer Iris."
"A very yummy, well balanced, thirst quenching lambic."
"O - One of the most drinkable sours around"
"(O) It's always tough for me to review sours like these as the taste is so simple and delicious and refreshing. There isn't a whole lot going on in the taste and it's not a very complex beer, but it sure is quite amazing."
"This is another great beer from Cantillon. The oaky funk is dirty and yet refreshing. Tons of flavor and huge sourness helps keep this quite enjoyable."
"Overall: I thought this beer was just ok as far as sours go. It was smooth, but I didn't find it to be very interesting."
"Too much too late? I can't even imagine how sour this might be fresh. If you're seeking balance, avoid. If you're a sour fanatic with a palate to appreciate the super-tart, might be worth a shot."
"Pours a hazy dark yllowish orange with a decent white head the clings to the glass. The nose is stong of sour citrus oranges, apricot, apple and a funkiness. The tast is sour lemons and sweet orang with a earthy funk. Its got a medium feel that is well carbonated. A very tasty beer."
"O: Yum Yum. So tart. 4"
"Overall: This combination of flavors really did not do it for me. I prefer their other sours."
"Unlike the two Zwanze's (especially the 2011), this beer doesn't knock you out. The 2007 vintage, after four years, has had considerable time to mellow out, and that it has. But in losing acute sourness, it's gained some pretty remarkable depth in the sourness's specific taste. And to have all of that among an ale that's otherwise so simple really let's it shine."
"O: Absolutely delicious. A few days after I tried this (fresh) one, I got to try one from 2006, which was phenomenal. Still tastes like a good, tart lambic, but the extra bitterness adds some great balance to the beer. My favorite by far."
"Unblended lambic a much more convincing than the Bruoscella, by far."
"Incredibly drinkable and remarkably complex. Wonderful"
"Very complex ale that I enjoyed a lot. Would love to pick up an older vintage and let it sit around for a while in the cellar."
"Drink- A very nice beer. A lot going on here but all seems to be working together and not to muddled or overpowering of each other. I would like to see a couple more bottles of this one with a little age to it."
"This was my favorite Cantillon of the day next to Zwanze '10 and '11."
"O- Really enjoyed this. Interesting citrus characteristics which work quite well with the sour, funky qualities of the beer. Hope to have this agaIn. Recommended."
"Overall: Not my favorite from Cantillon, but still well worth the experience."
"Overall just another fun Cantillon romp, really like this fruit action."
"Burnt orange yellow in color with a short lived head and no lace. A different lambic this is; a hoppy one. While it still holds that simple and appealing lactic acid, the late hopping adds a strong second dimension of grassy flavors. In comparison to other Cantillon's, this is not overly sour, which helps make Iris easy to approach."
"O - A very intriguing and complex ale that really kept me on my toes from the word go. My first Cantillon experience and I really enjoyed! I will definitely be seeking out Iris and any other Cantillon offerings that I can get my hands on."
"D - Another winner from Cantillon. After reading some previous reviews I was expecting a different beer than what poured out of my bottle. As previously stated, not as sour as other Cantillons, but another quality product. I have one more in the cellar and am anxious to see what time does this one."
"o: an alright beer, not my favorite wild ale. probably wont buy again unless someone wants one in a trade."
"Tasty, but so much better to come out of Cantillon that I wouldn't go out of my way for this."
"Lighter medium body, decent carbonation, lingers on the tongue for a bit. This was another tasty beer, although the combination of bitter and sour didn't completely fit my palate (unlike Cuvee des Champions)."
"My second chance with a Cantillon. They continue to live up to the hype."
"O- Nothing really overwhelming about this beer, but as a whole, it really comes together wonderfully. A great introduction to Cantillon and I can't wait to try the others when I get my hands on them."
"Overall this was a nice beer to try, but I'd take Classic Gueuze over this any day. Would love to give this another shot though someday, especially on a fresh bottle to compare."
"Cheers"
"O - I liked this one, just not as much as the other two. It was, surprisingly to me at least, the most sour of the three. I tend to like my sours with a bit more fruit in them but this was still very nice."
"Mouthfeel is light, spritzy, well carbonated and champagne like. Quite tart, but not too throat rapey. Low end of tartness for a Cantillon."
"O: although this may be the sourest beer I've had, which is awesome, I don't think this beer was particularly great for cantillon. Although still very good, and I would drink again and again."
"Overall; sour and just a touch funky, but full of fruity hops that just beg for another sip. This is maybe the easiest drinking Cantillon I've had so far, and I would suggest this to anyone who was starting to delve a little deeper into sour beers."
"O: It's definitely a unique lambic, probably due to it being made only with barley (traditionally ~30% wheat is used) and fresh hops (traditionally aged). It is pleasurable but flavors are a bit subdued. Again, this might be because it was bottled recently, and I would love to try a more aged one. Overall, not my favorite Cantillon, but still good."
"The flavor is overtly tart. Lip puckeringly strong. The finish is a dry bitterness--I don't think it's from any hops. No notable sweetness; this comes across like an unsweetened lemonade. The body is full while the carbonation is surprisingly light. If you like your lambics overly sour, then you'll love this one. Perhaps the sourest beer I've ever had."
"This goes down as a very mild sour. The flavors are subtle, yet very nice."
"Appearance is a nice orange tone, bright, with quite a bit of cloudiness. There was an off-white head, that did not sit atop for too long. Upon sipping Iris, right away the sour element hits your palate. Some of the specific flavors are vinegar, tart lemon, straw. MF is low-med with good carbonation. This offering from Cantillon is quite nice... well worth your time and money."
"The second time that I've had this hard to find beverage, and, so, was not so disappointed this time. Pours orange, good carbonation with some lace. Funk and flowers in the aroma, a little barnyard and rosewater. Very interesting. Not super tart, only a little sour, but definitely is dominated by the funk. While the smell is quite interesting, the taste once again falls short for me of the excitement I crave. Probably I will try this again in the future and reexamine my world."
"Overall (Drinkability): I'm a big fan of Cantillon, and this brew is a perfect example of why. Great flavor, some nice sour funk, everything you could ask for. Definitely recommend!"
"Cheers!"
"overall: one of the smoothest of the cantillons i have had. definitely not a sour bomb like some of them are. definite kudos to the smell over the taste."
"Although I enjoyed pick out the uncommon and unique flavors in this one, the ""pissy"" acidity and overly floral notes were a bit overwhelming. It was nice to try once, but I may not go back and it's certainly not one of Cantillon's best (those would be the Gueuze and Saint Lamvinus, in my opinion)."
"This is a really good, tame sour. If you like IPAs this will probably suit you. The dry hopping has given it a unique citrusy spin."
"Exceptionally sour and dry, Cantillon Iris should be enjoyed by anyone claiming to be a fan of sours. For those uninitiated to the style, this may be rather extreme."
"Taste, quite sour, green apples, white wine, you seem to be able to appreciate a slight hop existence. Tiny amount of oak mouthfeel accompanying the little dry hopping. Extremely dry. Solid tart product from Cantillon, as usual"
"O: The price was hard to swallow but the beer sure wasn't. After trying my first Cantillon brew, I definitely understand the hype."
"2007 vintage poured from a bottle. Orange opaque ruddy beer with a really lovely two finger tight white head. Spotty belgian lace grows with each succesive sip. Lightly funky sour tang aroma, with wet horse blanket and heavy lemon. This is not the most sour lambic, although it is plenty funky, oaky, and pithy. Punchy lemon flavor blended with a dusty straw taste. Iris has an acidic and bitter finish, this is slightly off putting. I assume this comes from my buddies decision to age this beer. The mouthfeel isn't thin, or all that dry actually. Overall I'd have to try this with less age on it, but it was tasty."
"Mouthfeel is puckering and dry with a crisp finish. Overall, it's really hard to beat the quality of Cantillon sours. Not sour for sours sake, but a nice well blended sweet and sour/tart flavor."
"The body is light but not close to empty, with moderate carbonation. Each sip is crisp and smooth."
"Overall: Another great Lambic from the people who know their stuff, Cantillon! You can never go wrong from anything from this great brewery."
"D. Good. I like the flavor of this, but I could sit and smell this beer all night - love this aroma."
"I'm a bit torn on where I stand here. I haven't reviewed many (any?) sour beers because I just don't have a feel for these things yet. This of the 4-5 I've had is in the middle. I've only had one that really impressed me. This doesn't impress me at all."
"Medium light body. Well carbonated. The drinkability is outstanding. I could drink this long haul."
"Pours copper with a very, very large off-white head with really good retention. The nose is pretty interesting with some slight funk and a few floral notes. There's a bit of acidity there as well. Mild earth. The taste takes this to the next level. There is a light acidic presence with some notes of light stone fruits plus some damp earth and general musk. Body is fairly light and low in carbonation. Finish is tart, yet not too bracing. Quite drinkable. Thanks again, Matt!"
"D: cantillon really knows how to brew these lambic beers and this one is no exception, really tasty and drinking fabulous."
"One of the most elegant lambics I ever had: Great stuff!"
"The mouthfeel is very big and frothy, it sits very well in the mouth and isn't as thin as it's look may make you believe. There's also some nice carbonation in the beer so that really adds to the apperciation of the drink. It's very drinkable, especially at that 50-55 degree temperature range. It's a little pricey, which keeps me from regularly buying something like this, but if I feel like I want to indulge, I will purchase this again. I may also purchase it again in getting either wine or beer people into the drink they're not into yet."
"I need more Cantillon in my life."
"An amazing lambic."
"Medium bodied and puckering without being acidic at all. Sour/tart up front with a decent balance of musty/earthy oak along with subtle pale malt, earthy, bitter hops and crisp light fruit. Very complex and well balanced with a nice amount of citrus and other sweet, vinous fruits balancing out the sour funk. In addition, the hops used make this beer very unique for the style. The dry and cold hopping results in a earthier, slightly more bitter lambic than usual, but not to the detriment of the other characteristics. There's still plenty of funk but this is slightly better balanced and easier to drink than some other Belgian sours. Recommended."
"This is one of my favourite Cantillon brews. Very complex, but still incredibly approachable. Need to do a side-by-side to figure out just how the wheat registers in their regular offering."
"Overall- My first unblended lambic. So far, so good. Very drinkable considering the strong acidic notes."
"I'm not craving any more of this, and can't foresee that urge, however I am grateful for having the chance to sample such a unique and rare beer. It's a bit of a good window on what a lot of beers must have been like hundreds and hundreds of years ago, although most likely not as good as this stuff happens to be."
"Less aggressive than other Cantillon products, still a very good beer."
"drinkability: good"
"D: This is one fantastic beer. I have never met a Cantillon offering that I have not liked, and this is no exception."
"the appearance is a dark orange color. almost brown. it smells like white grapes, very strong sour smell. tastes very sour and funky, tastes really sour, kind of like grapes too but i don't know if they use them or not citrusy too. really good mouthfeel with high drinkability. the taste is just phenomenal, cantillon makes great beers and this is one of them."
"great stuff, not sure why i waited so long on this but time treated it well. i will be buying more for sure."
"All of the Cantillon beers are intense, but this one is especially potent due to the bitterness. It borders on overpowering, but still remains drinkable, just not as refreshing as some of this brewery's other Lambics."
"D - quite sour; not sure how long I could sustain without my taste buds melting, but I'm going to try because this is delicious."
"After being a bit disappointed with Rosé de Gambrinus (my bottle of which, I think, I drank too young), I was a little afraid of trying another Cantillon beer, thinking that perhaps my expectations had become too raised and my preferences had perhaps moved away from lambics. However, these doubts were unfounded. Iris is, *exactly*, the kind of refinement and complexity I signed on for when I paid those extra dollars for a bottle of Cantillon at a store full of world class beer."
"poured from a 2007 vintage 750ml bottle it was an orange/amber color with a fresh 2 finger head smell was spice and hops with a malt and biscuit presence before the sour fruit like lemon and apples..taste was spice ,then some tart lemon with slight hops.malt and biscuit it ended with a nice sour .tart taste ..mouth feel was crisp and tart not as sour as other offerings..but it is not meant to be..this is unlike most cantillon offerings ive had not as sour but with a slight hops taste and malts,,still its outstanding and so drinkable..i loved this one will buy more"
"My third Cantillon, all have been superb."
"Had this since a couple times, was never as good as that first 2006 bottle."
"glassware: tulip"
"d - A nice lambic from Cantillon. Not my favorite Cantillon beer, but still good none the less. Lots of floral notes and tart lemon. Would drink again."
"Drinkability -- While I certainly enjoyed this, it seemed to lack a little bit of the character I normally associate with lambics, namely lacto tartness to offset the sharp acetic flavor, and perhaps the lack of wheat addition was throwing me off. As I was drinking it, I couldn't help but note the lack of depth that I associate with, say, Cantillon Gueuze. That said, it's unique, a must try, and one that I look forward to revisiting in the future."
"O: It is amazing how one's tastes change over the course of a year. This one is world class!"
"Bottle. 2006 vintage. Pours a golden orange color with minimal head into my stemware. Very floral and funky type aromas in the nose. I'm taken aback slightly as this smells like nothing Cantillon I have had before. Beyond the floral notes are some fruity and lemony aromas. The taste is quite good although again, different, from other Cantillon beers I have had before. Fairly tart and sour. Lemony aftertaste with some barnyard. Light mouthfeel. Love to try this one again."
"Well carbonated with a slightly lighter than medium body. Feels fine in the mouth... without food, your stomach might suffer though. Hard to not want more of."
"This is an engaging & complex brew. I can't say I have any other straight lambics to compare it to, but found it very satisfying. That said, it's also intense & I don't think I could take more than a glass of this."
"2007 vintage- poured into a Cantillon logo wine glass. Thought I would review a relatively fresh version of Iris vs. more aged versions previously had.Popped the cork and not a wisp of air- concerned about carbonation but was not an issue. Pours dark golden/copper with a nice level of carbonation and head. Micro bubble lacing that coats the glass.Nose- apricots, lemon, green apple, oak, but overall very fresh fruit forward. Taste- hops are definitely in the foreground- woody bitterness intertwine with the moderate acidity. Lack of wheat gives the malt more sweeter flavour to the malt. Finish is drying from the hops and cheesy."
"Reviewed from my notes. Colored opaque orange, with a deeper color in the center. A tiny off-white head caps the liquid. Some musty sour yeast and slight hops make up the aroma. It is flavored slightly like apricot. Soon after, a good sour flavor kicks in. It isn't too puckering. Some yeast flavors linger. I find it very tasty. It has a medium body and low carbonation. As I said, very little puckering sensation--just enough to let you know its there. Not much coat, just what you would expect from this style. It's very drinkable. Not too sour and very refreshing. The low ABV keeps them coming."
"D - Another interesting beer from Cantillon. Good for a treat every now & then."
"Iris pours a golden orange color with pretty good clarity. Very well carbonated with bubbles and a nice fizzy head fizzes quickly. Aromas are herbal, vinegar, floral, and sour. Taste is similar to the nose with sourness being the dominant characteristic. Very smooth with plenty of acidity. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and very well carbonated. I was loving this beer other than the fairly high price tag. I would love to keep a few of these bottles and see how it ages."
"I wish this beer wasn't finite. or so expensive. great sour lambic though. one of my favorites."
"Iris pours what initially appeared to be a murky dark orange/brown, but proper lgihting revealed it's true nature, a relatively clear and radiant orange. A most impressive three finger creamy bone cap forms, and head retention is excellent. Lacing is nonexistent, but this doesn't come as a huge surprise. The nose is enticing, but fairly one dimensional. It's pure, unadulterated musty barnyard funk, the same classic smell associated with many wild ales. It's not bad, but I was hoping for a bit more, and I hope the beer is a little more exciting than this. After even the first sip any fears were assuaged. A brief splash of malt and oak segues beautifully into a wave of tartness. It's half sour apple and half citrus, like a sour apple blow pop dipped in a little bit of citric acid (and I mean this in a good way). The earthy barnyard funk that so dominated the nose finds its place here on the back end, closing each sip and lingering just long enough. Body is on the thin side, as one usually finds with a beer fermented with such voracious yeast, but it coats my tongue with each sip. I do find myself wishing the carbonation was a bit more lively and expressive though. I find that any true sour or wild beer can't be rushed and must be savored, and the same is true here. Aroma and mouthfeel are minor chinks in Iris's armor, but I'm happy to overlook those when faced with a beer that tastes as fantastic as this one does."
"Note: Vintage 2007, bottled in 2010"
"Overall a unique and special beer. I would definately recommend this to someone looking to break into the world of sours."
"Drinkability: this is my first Cantillon, so you might chalk it up to shock. I was really expecting to like this beer, and boy, was I right in doing so. Call it confirmation bias. I just call it damn tasty."
"- Overall this an A grade sour... and the lightest one I have tried.. and I love it... great hot weather sour. Must try."
"D- Not my favorite style of beer, but great for what it is. I can drink about 1 bottle, but thats about all. Not someting I would tell my friends they have to try, unless I just want to see the look on their faces."
"Beer had soaked through the cork when I popped the cap off. Smells funky before I even pulled the cork out. Pours a very lovely amber orange color with a large white head that fell slowly leaving whispy rings of lacing. Aroma is nice and tart, semi-sweet, doses of lemon and light funk. Taste is acidic but not overly tart, and funkiness/cheese factors are kept to a minimum. Splashes of lemon rind, a bit of leather, and a gentle herbal hoppiness that's not bitter but certainly present. This really is a great beer. I was expecting this to be super sour and tart considering it's unblended and age 3 years, but the acid is very pleasing and complimentary to the bready, darker malts. Mouthfeel is somewhat thin and there's virtually no carbonation. I would almost believe this is close to flat if I didn't see small, wandering carbonation bubbles in the tulip glass. Good drinkability considering it's a sour beer. I will drink on this slowly over the course of the evening and it will actually go very well with the homemade pizza I'm whipping up later on."
"D - Very drinkable in terms of ABV but the palette needs to get used to the tartness. especially for the younger vintages."
"Vintage 2007, tasted from 375mL bottle at Lush West Town. Pours light amber orange with a quickly fading white head. Nose is brett funk with some burnt rubber, vinegar, and a dandelion florality and just a hing of lemon and green apple. Taste is very bitter on the tip of the tongue and very sour with some citrus. The body is medium minus with sparkling carbonation and a medium finish."
"i'm going to go ahead and say it... this is my favorite cantillon beer to date. everything i love is going on here. sharp citrus notes and bright green apple coupled with funk and earth and horse and mushroom and more fruit and a touch of caramel/honey sweet malt and a beautiful, subtle hoppiness that is totally unexpected, but does wonderful things to round the beer out and help give it some clarity and definition. zippy, tart, sour, earthy, wild, malty, hoppy. to me, this is the most approachable cantillon beer, and one i could drink almost every day. still definitely not for everyone, but one of my favorite beers. more please!!!"
"T: Mineral water, resin, burgundy, maybe dry sherry up front with soft horse blanket in the finish with some acidity. Very refreshing."
"**To update, after having this much more (particularly with more time on the bottle), this might be one of the best beers from Cantillon to age, it gets so nicely rounded, balanced, and drinkable, that it definitely makes me wish I had more of this to sit on. **"
"D: Good."
"Overall, this is a pretty drinkable sour. It has a lot of nice flavors to it and very unique from some of the other lambics I have had. More oak and more hops show from this one. A very solid offering."
"Extremely drinkable, I doubt it gets more drinkable then this."
"Overall, not as fruity as other Cantillons but it's not supposed to be. This is for the oak cask flavor traditional lambic lovers. This pairs very well with most dinners."
"Love this stuff! One of the greatest brews on this planet."
"This beer has dramatic impacts from the split second that it hits the lips until extremely deep in the finish. For a light and thirst quenching beer, this beer has an impressive range that keeps the complexity going and going."
"Incredibly tart with some sour layering and woody brett flavor in the middle. Finishes off very dry with some more tannic tartness. The oak is readily apparent as it warms, toasted with plenty of acidity. Very good complexity and balance. Sourness diminishes as you work the bottle, but plenty of other flavors come up to fill the void. Very drinkable and went exceptionally well with some chevre goat cheese. I think I could live in Cantillon's cellar."
" D- This beer has a nice crisp tartness with some good depth of funk and fruit."
"My first Cantillon. The flutes really showcase the long-lasting carbonation, the bubbles keep coming up through the glowing amber body, maintaining a thin skim of foam as a memory of the thick tan head. Lots of sour and funky notes in the bouquet, with a hint of hops. After the first taste, the sourness is very strong and pleasantly intriguing. Lots of layers here, with faint soapy hops in the finish. Looking forward to comparing this to a Cantillon that is not dry-hopped, don't think I'll miss the hops too much as they're almost like an afterthought in this beer. Very refreshing carbonation keeps the sourness from being overwhelming on the palate, and call me crazy, but I could drink this (and any sour) to excess easily."
"*=ideas from fellow tasters"
"D - VERY drinkable at 5.00% and for how great it tastes, this one could be drunk for quite a while. I would like to see how this tastes with a more subdued hop profile. Might have to age a few."
"Fairly hazy golden colored brew, non-stop rising bubbles produce a big white head. Scent is sour and fruity. Taste is fairly barny and quite a bit sour. Interestingly there is a pretty noticeable hop profile. Im not a lambic master, but i cant recall hops coming into play very often. Good amount of puckering fruit, lemon, grapefruit. Im almost picking up wheat tones as well. Some vinegar. Very interesting and tasty, i.e. cantillon"
"I have to say i've enjoyed this more when it was fresher (clear hop flavor and bitterness). Cellaring at length seems to deplete what makes Iris unique, the dry hopping and pale malt. Will try it again fresh and update this review."
"D - i've heard a few times that Iris is best fresh, perhaps this is a little past its prime as the acidity is pretty dominating. still good, especially if you're in the mood for it. would seek this out again, and drink it on the spot."
"D= This beer is really nice. A wow beer for me. This beer is sour without being dominating and really sort of letting some of the beers complexities come through and shine. It has a real ""beer"" taste as well as some of those sour notes I love so much. I'll be buying more of this."
"D-pretty solid brew, nice oak aging with a good level of acidity to it, nice balance and not too sweet at all but still a good flavor and some earthy characteristics. Very good!"
"I tried this beer on June 10, 2009 at ""The Beerbistro"" in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. I'm convinced that this brewery can do no wrong. The beer poured a relatively clear golden orange with a small amount of haze and a whole lot of effervescence. The aroma was sour apples, some earth and must. The mouthfeel was medium-bodied and highly carbonated. The taste was both sour and bitter, and a great experience for the tongue."
"Notes: This was one of my first few lambics I've tried so I'm not terribly experienced at tasting these but I did like this one for the most part. It was a bit on the overpowering side but I think this is just due to my inexperience. I would still but this again if the price was right :)"
"Absolutely delicious. Good mouthfeel and amazing drinkability. I usually get burned out on Guezue's and Lambics after 2 glasses but I could literally drink Iris all night long. An absolute winner."
"A good beer with lots going for it. Interesting, different and well worth a try."
"D: I'd say I could have two of these, the sourness and citrus seems like it would upset the stomach after 2-3 of these. 1 was enough for me, my gums and tongue were dry and puckered enough for me."
"Taste is very sharp and sour but super smooth and easy drinking given the style. Hints of flowers, honey and tart candy. Finish is tangy and fruity."
"Beer is super sour and has a nice funk to it. Lots of carbonation in the mouth. This pushes the limits of what I think a sour can be. Very lactic / citric in the front and then oak and woodsy at the back with a lingering funk. Drinkability is good but its not my favorite lambic from them. Overall I still thoroughly enjoyed it."
"Drinkability: I would def have this again and recommend this to those who enjoy a lambic with tons of sour and earth backbone."
"D: Very easy drinking with strong but not overwhelming tartness."
"D: Perfect on a warm day. Could easily keep drinking this if my wallet were fatter."
"D: Not my favorite of the Cantillon beers, but still really nice and better than many American sours. A really pleasant beer to sip on after watching the Sharks beat the Wings."
"D - This is very good stuff; it just isn't head and shoulders better than, say, the widely available Gueuze Boon or Girardin Black Label."
"Drinkability: Don't pass this beer up if you have the chance."
"My first venture into sour beer was a Cantillon Geueze several years back and I just wasn't ready for it at the time. I literally had no idea what I was getting into. Lately I've been making an attempt to try more wild/sour styles now that I have a better understanding of such beers. I really enjoyed Iris and I will continue to pick up different Cantillon beers (dispite the high price) as I have the opportunity."
"Drinkability: Highly drinkable, like any cantillon. Does not disappoint, but does not stand out either."
"D: Very enjoyable, I don't think this could be a session though. Just a little too much everything, and entirely too complex to disrespect by drinking so many. This is a fantastic beer. Highly recommended."
"Pours a hazy burnt orange color with nice cap of stiff white bubbles, good retention and lacing. Smell gives hints of its sour and tart being with a decent background of earth and must. As scent dictated, the sourness and tartness hits the tounge first followd up by a light funkyness. Additional sips shead light to a multitude of flavors such as vinegar, sour grapes, apples, hay, bread hidden behind the tart/sour/funky flavors. The earthyness and mustyness present at the backend of each sip. Body is medium, active carbonation and dry finnish. A nice straight forward lambic. Dont expect any delicate softness here, pretty pourful stuff."
"Opinion: I am thinking that I should wait and review this one some more as it warms up some. Right now I already know that it is an incredible beer, but I am thinking that it is too cold at this moment."
"The body is medium and carbonation is high but appropriate. Overall, another stellar beer from Cantillon. Can't say it really separates itself from the rest of their lineup, but is that really a critique? Speaks volumes for a brewery when an average beer by their standards is a solid A-"
"D - perfect example of the style. only thing wrong with it is that it's gone already."
"I'm now curious to see how a fresher, 2007 vintage compares to the 2005 I just had. The hop character is likely to be entirely different, perhaps the carbonation level too. The 2005 is drinking fine though for what it is."
"D: I would drink Iris anytime. It's always a good day when you're drinking Cantillon."
"A fine beer that I will get again as soon as I see it. This sour habit I'm forming is so pleasant yet getting to be pricey."
"The flavor begins with a nice sharp carbonic bite and it then moves onto a sharp acidic bite from the acid. Very dry and the brett is the dominant flavor yet everything is remarkably balanced. In some cases lambics can get out of hand yet Iris is very drinkable. I wish more lambics tasted like this, yet I am glad that such a rare beer exists and that I got to have some. Due to the nature of seasonal production and the changes that occur this beer might never be replecated exactly. This is the best lambic that i have ever had."
"Fantastic!"
"Have enjoyed every Cantillon beer I have sampled, as with the others, 375ml is a large enough serving for me. Would like to revisit this one in the future..."
"Notes: Well, there it is, #900!"
"D: This beer is good and sour, and it lingers awhile. My only complaint is that there isn't the same hint of sweetness in the taste that there is in the nose."
"Pours a nice apricot orange with smallish white head that fades quickly. Smells good (which might be a first for my sours) some good horseblanket, lemon zest, some oak, and must. Taste has some vinous notes, some vinegar sourness, something that seems a bit buttery, and lots of apricot. MF is a bit smoother than others I've had, bigger body, dry finish. Very drinkable, a great sour. Glad I got to try it."
"D- Goes down really smooth. One of the easier drinking Lambics I've had."
"D: I'm enjoying this one, but I think 12oz will be enough for one sitting. Of course, it will take me awhile to finish this since the flavors are quite potent. I'd be up to have it again at another time, for sure."
"This is a cloudy, gold orange beer without much head (my bottle is six years old). It has a powerful aroma of vinegar-- almost mustardy-- plus apple, lemon, nutmeg maybe, and something a little tropical, but mostly just that sour smell. When you taste this beer, the sourness keeps coming and coming until your cheeks hurt and your eyes water. What does it actually taste like? Sour. Green apple, grapefruit, funky, wood resin, and sour sour sour. Yum."
"D- This was a very drinkable beer. I bought the smaller size and think that was perfect to have. I could have drank an entire bottle of this but I didn't want to spend the money that it was to do so!"
"Consumed: 2/6/2010"
"d: definitely worth a try; very good and unusual; nothing quite like it."
"A solid lambic. I really enjoyed the caramel and sweetness in this beer, rare in lambic. I'm assuming they added some kind of crystal or kilned barley, very impressive, adds a lot more layers. Highly recommend."
"I recomend this, others may not because of the complex taste, that is okay to me this is great."
"Excellent Beer."
"D- very enjoyable and easy to finish. very well balanced for a lambic. something id like to try more often."
"Didn't notice until the end of the second pour. Bits of what look like charred something or other in the head. Looks like charcoal. Strange, but no matter. Great beer!"
"D: Very good. Wonderful little beer we have here."
"drinkability is good - it may not be a brew you drink very often but i enjoyed sipping this beer"
"Pours a nice hazy orange, with a big frothy head. Nose is funk and sour lemon/tangerine with hints of juniper or ginger. Flavor is bitter citrus evoking primarily grapefruit, with little cloves on the finish, and a huge astringent/tannic aftertaste that builds and peaks at 5 seconds. Really adds to the feeling of biting grapefruit and is not entirely appealing (from maybe a few too many days in the barrel). The bitterness is tempered as the beer warms toward room temperature. The taste it on the thin side for a lambic and not overly complex, but the acidity is just right. Overall a nice lambic but drinkability suffers from the bitterness."
"Very round and full in the mouth, quite highly carbonated, an easy and refreshing drinker with 12.7oz leaving you wanting more."
"Not as high of a carbonation as the pour would have indicated, but I did savor this ~6oz pour over the course of at least 30 minutes with some healthy swirling to knock out a bit of carbonation. Very intense beer that is very drinkable considering the flavor profile. Yes please."
"Pours and orange color with an off-white head. Aroma is a very tart, sour. Some spices and floral qualities also. The flavor is vinegary with some great tart fruit. You get some wood notes in the flavor as well as a good mix of citrus and some barnyard funk. High carbonation and extremely drinkable."
"D - This is an exceptionally complex and drinkable lambic. The wild character is intense and complex, but the sourness is rounded and never overwhelms the palate. There is a lot of fruity complexity that works with the funk to create a sweet and sour character that reminds me a bit of a Flemish red. All of this is backed up by a nice malt character that is quite a bit more complex than that of most lambics. A great beer that deserves a place in any collection of sour beers."
"D: 4.0-4.5 - This has quite a different character than the younger vintages and the qualities of each are both quite respectable; however, they are different enough to require some forethought in choosing how ""sour"" you want to go."
"D: For sour lovers, you can't go wrong with this one."
"Thanks for the bottle, mikey711."
"D: This tasty brew was a nice demonstration of some age mellowing the power of the sour/tart notes. Refined and somewhat delicate. Nice offering from Cantillon."
" Mouthfeel was wonderful with balanced sprightly carbonation. As for drinkability, although fairly acidic, the craftsmanship of this brew along with its addictively tart flavor certainly would keep me coming back for more."
"D - A delicate sipper... Highly enjoyable... This 5 year old version is proof that this beer can be aged as those still possessed vigorous tartness and carbonation..."
"Overall, interesting and a change from the lambics I've had recently. Another great offering from Cantillon and I would recommend it."
"*Strongly influenced by fellow tasters."
"Drinkability is good, a great wine bridge, with nice complexity without being overly sour...however, overly sour is what I look for from Cantillon!"
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this isn't the type of beer that I normally drink but this a very nice sour beer to drink for a long time."
"The beer is perfectly carbonated and the balanced flavors make this a sour that is quite drinkable."
"I'm still relatively new to sour beers, but this leapfrogged its way right to the top spot. Fantastic."
"Not as great as I hoped, but a very nice experience."
"Tried this on tap at Ebenezer's Pub. It definitely lived up to the hype I had heard. Great nose and color, and just the right amount of tart, funk, and bitterness. I liked it so much I sought out a bottle the next day - Tully's in Wells, Maine was able to support my fix."
"Not a big review but a delicious sour- highly recommended"
"D - There are other lambics I prefer over this one from Cantillon."
"Mouthfeel: A light rolling carbonation keeps the body feeling light and puffy, with a tingling wine-like mouthfeel"
"D- I'm sad that I don't have any more. I can't wait to see this again, a must own."
"Fantastically drinkable."
"Hazy orange pour kicks up a clean white head, which soon fizzes down to a spotty film. Horseblanket dominates the funky and complex aroma, and overlays a crisp sour lemon and vinegar bouquet. Sourness dominates the palate, but this beer never becomes less than eminently drinkable, in part due to a light sweetness that pulls things back in. Tart lemon flavours contribute the bulk of the sourness, and leave a clean feeling in the mouth, not unlike a dry white wine. Funky horseblanket and hay notes add further layers of complexity. The medium-light body and pillowy carbonation only add to the refreshing character. Unbelievably drinkable for its sourness!"
"Drinkability: Wow, could've plowed through a lot more than I did. Easily a winner. If it were more readily available, I'd buy a case. It's that nice. The scores may not read out clearly how much I really liked this beer, but I'm just glad to have another bottle for a special occasion."
"drinkability is great. funky, soft and a touch of sourness make this a solid lambic. another great brew from Cantillon. cheers!"
"Overall- Very refreshing and would definitely love to try again."
"Thanks to juicestam for sharing his loot from Belgium!"
"This is an amazing beer, everything about it is good, maybe now awesome but very good. I might have to stock my cellar with this beer."
"Nice to see what happens when things go 'unblended' in the Senne Valley - like this is all that different from this one's blended ilk - except maybe for any specific fruit's neutered contribution to the matter, and perhaps a heavier leaning on the wood vinegar way of things. At any rate, a heady, uncompromising affair of a beer, worthy, I suppose of the $30-plus price tag in tony King Street beerdom."
"Mouthfeel was medium to low in carbonation with a fine texture. Silky. I wish my bottle was larger."
"The flavor is slightly sweet with a lot of citric-style sourness. Not full-on vinegar-style puckering, but a pleasantly crisp and fruity beer. Mouthfeel's just fine, drinkability hurts a bit as it finishes just a little off from this tap."
"I'll finish it, and may buy another to compare, as I feel this one may not be the best representation."
"Overall another winner from Cantillon. Sort of a simple lambic by their standards, but a fine one, as they constantly seem to acheive."
"D - Nice beer for savoring and observing a special occasion."
"looks like i prefer blends and gueuzes. this one just seems a bit too straightforward with the tartness and barn flavors."
"Try this beer fresh. It's quite different than older vintages!"
"Drinkability is OK. This is definitely not my favorite Cantillion, but thing I will say is that it is interesting and not bad at all. In fact, I think I would recommend Iris for people who are new to sours and want to get started. With just a touch of sourness and a familiar hop presence, this is a good transition beer."
"A good beer, but over hopped.The bitterness is not pleasant or ideal in the style."
"Cantillon has lived up to my expectations i cant wait to have more of there brews"
"I thought the unusual flavors would make this less drinkable than other lambics, but it's refreshing, balanced, and easy to drink for a sour tooth."
"Pours a dark sunset orange, with a low eggshell head, sparse foam puddle after it settles .. . I love the aroma, from sour white grapes, zest, vinegar, all kinds of delicious wrong flavours that are just so right!! ..Man Utd Forever!.. . quite a bitter mouth to it, with a tanglicious refreshing bite.. quite complex in the mouth lemon to sherbet to aspirin to other sour animals .. . Its got something to it, i like it, it hates me: word.. . I like everything about it except the braising bitterness in the aftertaste.. . .."
"12.7oz bottle, corked and capped, vintage 2005. The beer is clear with a touch of haze, copper colored with almost no head. The aroma is sour and barnyardy, kind of musty and a little metallic. The taste is just perfection, Cantillon makes the best lambics I've tried. I get a lot of sour citrus like lemon or puckering grapefruit juice, funkiness from the wild yeast, tart and delicious. Full bodied for a lambic (meaning light in body versus many other beer styles), I found the bottle disappearing quickly. I'll get the big bottle next time."
"Iris isn't quite as bitingly sour as some of the other Cantillon lambics and could be considered good introduction to the Cantillon family. They never disappoint and Iris is another gem in their stellar lineup. I'm going to pick a few more of these up for cellaring; especially being that this is one of the cheaper Cantillon bottles out there."
"Overally this was a really tasty brew. The bottle went down way to easily."
"75cL bottle from 2006. Pours a hazy copper color with a small cap of resilient foam. Tart, musty nose with some citrus character. Flavor is quite acidic with a slightly sweet background. Some mineral character and woodiness. Dry, tongue-curling finish. Medium feel with light carbonation."
"Pours a clouded amber gold with a surprisingly thin creme head as opposed to none that most of these lambics have. Nose is floral and funky. Flavor is not so abrasive as other lambics. Smooth funky barn tones with a smooth funky character as well. Citric acidity rides in the back. Feel is thicker on liquid. Carbnonation is light and nice. Quite easy to drink. Lou Pepe releases and Lamvinus aside, this is the easiest of the Cantillon releases to drink. A real pleasure. And definitely something lambic rookies might want to try if looking to dive into sours."
"Iris is a really nice, solid beer. It's well done in all respects and doesn't have any glaring flaws to discuss. I can't say I'm head over heels for it, but that's attributable, in part, to personal preference. I'm just not the biggest sour fan. Coming from a not so sour guy, this is good beer. That's saying something, right?"
"Light - Medium bodied with a good level of carbonation."
"Crisply carbonated, light body."
"Overall - This would be great as a before or after dinner drink, or one for casual sipping. Definitely not for drinking quickly. But I enjoyed it nonetheless."
"Cap was rusted and cork and top of bottle were moldy. 2005 Vintage with cork saying bottled in 2007. Two finger head that dropped within a minute. Deep amber color in the body, opaque. Smell is funky, musty attic smell, earthy, sour, floral. Tastes like a battery, really not very appealing at first, gets better with more drinks, but then reverts back, there is something off here. Chemical like tastes, wow, its really off putting. I'm glad I shared this with a friend, I don't know if I could have drank the full 750. Mouth feel is good with carbonation, drinkabilty suffers from the weird off putting metallic/chemical flavors I'm getting. This might be my first unblended lambic."
"D: I don't think this beer is meant to be drunk, I think its just for collectors and blenders. I blended the remaining portion of the bottle with Muse a sweeter saison and the two together were fantastic."
"Drinkability... this went down real goood. I could have had more, were it not for the price."
"D: Being as intense as this is, it is great for sharing, but I am working on this bottle by myself tonight. Much easier drinking than some of the others in the Cantillon lineup, less acid, smoother. If one craves a few glasses of something quite sour this is a good option. Great for a special occasion or just savoring for the hell of it."
"D: Much different than the other Cantillon's I've tried, mainly due to the lack of wheat and fruit. It's also not as sour as some others, but certainly does the trick. Honestly, it's this is the least favorite yet of the Cantillon sours I've tried, but that's not saying much -- it's still an extraordinary and refreshing beer. I couldn't fathom turning another one down short of being offered some other more appealing sours."
"Don't drink and review."
"Overall a very nice old lambic. Expensive, as all of these are, but worth it from time to time."
"Picked up a short green bottle for about $8. This lambic is a bit unusual for it hop character and all-malt grain bill, but it's a nice change of pace. The aroma begins the drink with a mix of musty leather and orange blossom, and the flavor is dominated by a pleasant lemon-lime juice. Tangy sour candy notes dot the edges of the palate, while orange rind and grapefruit hops provide a mild bitterness. This is an excellent lambic and a bit wine-like for white-wine lovers. Highly recommended and worth the money every once and a while."
"This is a standout beer for style."
"Drinkability: If you like the aforementioned sour funk, it's quite possible that you'll enjoy this brew immensely - I just didn't find it too terribly complex, unfortunately. I can appreciate what it was and what it was trying to be however, and that, coupled with the low alcohol, makes me think that it must be pretty drinkable."
"Notes from: 12/11/04"
"NOTE: I'm going to cellar a bottle of this for a year or two, and see how it turns out cellared."
"Poured sparingly into my Koningshoeven goblet. This beer pours a hazy, muddled, orange with a thin inch head that left no lacing and no retention. The aroma is extremely tart, citric with orange and lemon zest. White wine vinegar, and bit of apple, and a whole lot of funkiness. The flavor is very citric and funky. I don't know if you can make vinegar out of lemon juice, but if you can I would imagine it would have some similarities to this. Also there are a whole lot of earthy undertones. The mouthfeel is very dry, leaving a very tart flavor on the palate. I really enjoy this beer but I find it very hard to drink a 750ml by myself. This is definitely a beer to share among several people."
"Served well chilled and poured into a champagne flute. Pours a nice copper color with a foamy white head. Has a very sour/funky aroma with a bit of citrus and very little fruit. The taste replicates the smell but also includes a barnyard taste and no real fruit or sweetness. Very little carbonation and a light body concludes with a dry finish. Easily drinkable though incredible tartness could be perceived as a turn off. Wish I would have bought a smaller bottle but would definitely try again."
"M + D: A mellow carbonation, no real bite or sting at all. A bit of a tingly foaminess, giving way to a moderate body that finishes remarkably dry. Quite an interesting brew... I'm quite glad to have tried it and would be more than happy to go about having it again were it to cross my path."
"I am not a huge fan of lambics, but I do have some experience with them. This is one of the best unblended I've had. Quite refreshing and complex, but like nearly all lambics it's one and done."
"Mouthfeel was lively."
"Pours a semi-clear sunset orange with a big 'ol two finger fluffy white head that quickly dies down to a thin layer of fluff. Virtually nothing in terms of stickiness, if anything, a possible spot here or there. Good god this is a sour beast. Grass, lemon, and vinegar explode in the nose with some sour apple underneath. A very powerful aroma overall, but in a good way. Taste begins, well, pretty tart. Lip smaking grapefruit and white grapes with some crisp hay underneath. Vinegar and lemongrass midway with a hint of unripe cherries. Aftertaste is pretty earthy and dry with leather and dust flavors on the tongue. Light and dry body with a big puckering mouthfeel. Pretty strong carbonation but it fits very well with the style. The abv is pretty low, but the crazy tartness is a bit much for my tastebuds. Not bad, but the price tag is a bit of a turnoff."
"2005 vintage. This is the first unblended lambic I've tried. Pours hazy orange-gold with a bubbly white head that quickly disappears. Musty aroma of yeast, lemon, apple, spice, and old wood. Taste is fruity, citrus sweet up front, but instantly turns into a dank acidic sourness with an apple wine/vinegar bite. As it warmed the sourness lightened up just a bit. Dry, sweet finish akin to a Flemish."
"D- At 19 bucks a bottle, its kind of steep, but i cant think of any other beer i'd rather have with key lime pie. hands down best cantillon ive tried."
"Drinkability is pretty high. I couldn't slam pint after pint of it, but that's not really the point. I could easily finish the small bottle myself, but what is the fun in that. Highly recommended as something different for fans of sours."
"Drinkability is good here. I like this beer from Cantillon. They can do no wrong."
"D: Amazing, holds up well after a number of years and I would assume, years to come. Incredible complexity, wonderful taste and fell and not too sour to give you heartburn. This beer demands attention and it should be given its due. A beer that I would gladly return to or give to someone else who is interested in getting into beers of this style."
"Eric"
"This is a beer I'll be revisiting again. Very drinkable, I put the entire bottle away by myself before I knew it."
"2005 Cantillon Iris. One word: Delicious. Would love to compare to the '08 bet I would not be disappointed. Want to know about the beer? Buy one...and if you can't imagine this: Brett, pure un-adultered heavy Brett with no sour bite. Not your typical Belgian experience. Nirvana in a glass...no joke. Made with mostly barley and some fresh hops (according to Cantillon's description on their website). Worth seeking out."
"d: Very good, unlike lambics or sours I have had previously. Really reminds me of acidic wine that has seen some oak. Wonderful."
"Great example of the style, but 2 glasses max for me"
"Pour a rich cedar brown and has a lacy light beige head. The nose has funky oak, tart fruits and a flowery herb presence. The taste is super complex and well balanced between musty funk, sour fruits, oak and again flowery hops. Crisp body goes down quite nicely. Another great brew from cantillon."
"D - So this is raw, unedited, uncut lambic. It manages good complexity; it is keeping me interested through the 750."
"I've seen this beer before and wanted to try it but Cantillon 750's are a little pricey $15-$25. Luckily I found this in a 375ml for $10 and who really needs more than 375ml of lambic or gueuze? The label read vintage 2005 and the cork read 2007 so three years old now. The cork was pretty disgusting, beginning to rot with a gross black liquid bubbling out of the cracks! Oddly, this did not deter me and seemed sort of normal...Anyway it looks like a gueuze, golden orange hardly any bubbles. It smells nice, fruity and malty with a slight earthiness. The flavor is bitingly sour, dry finish, dusty grapes, I think I taste hops?"
"Fiendishly complex, superb. I'll remember this one forever - massive beyond its abv, and I appreciate that. An incredible beer, I'd love to try some 1990s vintages."
"2005 Vintage. Amazing. It smells like a pig farm, and it tastes like old yeast, dirty socks and underripe grapes. Yet as unappetizing as that sounds, it's one of my favorite Lambics of all time. Probably too sour & funky for some tastes, I find it has just enough hoppiness to balance it out and crisp it up. This baby works on every level."
"This is an interesting one - very funky but with subtle complexities that are quite unique. Ver drinkable despite puckering/near-puckering quality."
"Pours a very nice cloudy golden orange color, very nice carbonation, nice little white creamy head, white little sticky lacing. The nose is very upfront, sour, with some yeast, slightly grassy. The taste is big time sour, slightly yeasty. Medium body, very sour, slightly bitter. Drinkable, this is a tasty beer, but too much for my tastes."
"1996 vintage! Wow! I was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to have this at a small beer tasting. The aroma is very sour with some oak and funk. The taste like the aroma is very sour with a vinegar-like flavor, oak and touches of citrus. Extremely interesting beer, and I am very amazed at how well this beer has held up after 12 years considering it's low ABV. It was quite an experience for sure, really nice beer."
"Notes: Excellent stuff, I'm going to have to revisit this soon."
"Tastes of tart fruits, funk, mouth puckering sourness and a bit of grass. Another well made beer from Cantillon."
"D: What a drinkable beer this is. It is very much on the sour side, but makes for a very refreshing drink. Try pairing this with Port Salut cheese. Pure. Heaven."
"M/D- you work a lot of carbonation out of it just by swirling it so much to keep bringing back the aroma but it really offers a nice intese sourness with a good funky bite to it as well."
"drinkability is good. the intense sourness makes it a bit of a sipper, but the other elements are balanced well."
"Overall, another very nice sour ale from Cantillon. Definitely a different experience from the Kriek and Geueze, as this is more subtle and nuanced. Well worth trying."
"D-I have some to expect nothing but good to great beers from Cantillon and this one does not disappoint. Gets better with each and every sip. This a a very nice example of style."
"D: Very drinkable for a lambic."
"D-A good beer for the style no doubt about it, very glad I tried this beer, but I doubt I will ever buy it again given the price and some of the difficulties I had drinking it."
"This is either the worst Belgian beer I've ever had, or the beer went bad. I popped the cap and beer started to come through the cork. This is a bad sign, and it is possible that the beer just went south somewhere along the bottling process. If not, yikes. The beer pours a slightly frothy head, plenty carbonated, but the smell is rancid vinegar, maybe some safflower, and other tart flowery herbs. The taste was largely undrinkable. Bitter, sour, flower petal bitterness, perfumey, just not at all good. As I said, it is possible the beer went bad on me, which I hope, because otherwise this was a total waste of a ten dollar purchase."
"Gets better as it warms - again, non for me but a very well-made effort nonetheless."
"Pours a cloudy orange dull color with a spritzy, non-lasting white head. Smell is sour peach, funky barnyard and fruity. Flavor was exceptionally dry to me, with almost no sweetness, and a light sour vinegary character and bland fruity notes than need a little more sweetness to make them pop. Honestly not too impressive flavorwise for me, with a thin dry unsweetened apricot or peach sourness. Unique and while not bad, didn't wow me with its dullness of flavors, complex as they were."
"Pours an amber color and is cloudy. A thin white head sits on top. Aroma is subtle for a lambic. Typical oak characteristics giving a sour nose. Also a little yeasty. Taste is extremely bitter. Essence of fruit, yeast and wheat is also present. Makes your mouth pucker and water for more. Mouthfeel is on the thin side with a low level of carbonation. Drinkability is fairly low as the tartness will eventually overwhelm the drinker. A nice bottle to share."
"Very refreshing and highly drinkable. It's nice to have unblended lambics to be reminded of what these beers can taste like in their ""naked"" state."
"Excellent with an aged Gouda or/and Chimay cheese and a good Pate."
"As always, a unique and pleasant offering from Cantillon. Heavy on the cedar and notes of oak is how Iris will be remembered. Still quite young and not quite in balance. I would be very interested in sampling earlier versions."
"good drinkability. smoother than it intitially appears, probably one of the most easily quaffable cantillon beers."
"Overall I would have to say that this one is an absolutely excellent selection. If you were just getting into sour beers this might be a good stepping stone as well, because it is not extremely mouth busting, but at the same time will give you a very clear picture of where the style can go. I would definitely have to recommend this one and will more then likely be trying it sometime in the near future."
"Whenever I want to treat myself I usually by this beer. The bright green citrusy hoppy taste mixed with the old hop traditional musk of a lambic is like nothing I have ever tasted before. The time in aok really does wonders for this beer. I felt it takes the harsh edges off the beer and really bring all the flavors together. Great beer!!!"
"This one poured very clear and a beautiful gold colour. There was a bit of fizzy, short-lived off-white foam, a bit of a ring supported by constant bubbling. The aroma was very floral with a nice tartness, a bit of acetic acid and light funk. The flavour was quite tart with berry notes, a bit of vinegar and a light sweetness. Dry, fruity sourness lingered. Apple/cider character developed as it warmed. Light bodied with some residual sugar present, ample carbonation and some dryness. A tasty, mouthwatering beer with restrained sourness that wasn't overpowering. Good stuff!"
"Drinkability: This is definitely a sipper for the sourness, but, as I said, it's a gentle sourness."
"I think this beer has excellent long-term aging potential. It would be a completely different beast a few years from now."
"Overall one of the most deliciously strange things I have ever tasted. Masterfull complexity."
"On-tap in a flute at the Capital Ale House in Richmond, this beer arrives orangey and crystal-clear, with low carbonation and a thin, vanishing head. Smells sour, lactic, tart, and lemony acidic. The flavor adds to this a slight woodiness, medium bitterness, and a delicious, fresh mozzarella character. There is little, if any sweetness, which enhances the extreme dryness of its medium, mildly carbonated body. Very refreshing; assertive, but not overwhelming, and I think the cheesy element to the flavor is a tasty novelty."
"D: A great lambic beer from Cantillon, I probably won't buy this again due to the price, $18.99 plus tax for a 25.4 ounce bottle, but I'm definitely glad I tried it, an interesting experiment, a 100% malted barley lambic, and it worked."
"Definitely recommended for those into lambics/gueuze or sour flavors."
"Review added 10-27-2007, translated from french 1-31-2008."
"A 750ml bottle poured into a tulip glass. Vintage 2004 on the label, bottled 2006 on the cork. Hazy golden red color with a tiny head and little carbonation. A tart fruity aroma, very earthy. Citrus fruit taste, very sour, yeast, crisp, clean finish. Loved this beer. Could drink it all night if my salivary glands were up to it."
"2003 edition. The blonde of lambics. Iris, Iris, fair and graceful in your looks. The smell of the earth, a pleasant mouthfeel. The taste of sweet apple not harsh. And livable sourness. A work of art not to punch a hole through. Satisfying like a very good white wine, 5 for satisfaction."
"Nice change-of-pace lambic when I'm in the mood for funk but done differently. Certainly not one of the best beers Cantillon makes but without a doubt a very good one. Recommended."
"D - A bit cloying overall. The kind of beer I want to like, but really have a hard time doing so. Not my favorite lambic, and not too easy to drink or even savor. Alcohol is not a factor."
"Pours a hazy orange/red, thin white head forms, nice layer, lacing, looks great. Smell is sweet, sour, very acidic, lots of fruits, funky, trademark Cantillon, but more malt in the aroma. Taste is caramel, sourness, very funky and acidic, almost pungent on the tongue, clean bitter finish with more acidity. Mouthfeel is lighter bodied, medium carbonation, nice bitterness, malty, more backbone than most Cantillon, nicely done. Thanks Martin!!"
"Drinkability- Yes! It's bizarre, funky, reeks, and is fruity. I like it. A strange and pleasant suprise from Cantillon."
"D: 750 mL bottle is easily finished, great refresher for summer."
"D - It may be tough to finish the 750ml by myself, the tartness is huge."
"D: Not very drinkable as a session beer obviously. I had no prob. getting my two wine glasses down, but i dont think i would go past that."
"D: This style is not my favorite, the acrid tartness is too intense for my likes. My wife though, she loves this stuff. Crazy!"
"Recommended. A nice, unblended lambic. Well done, Cantillon."
"I dont know if I would take this beer over their Kriek or the blended Gueze, but a delicious beer from a superb brewery."
"Wow"
"Drank: Early 2007"
"Drinkability- Excellent output from Cantillon. Maybe my favorite of the bunch to date."
"Had this tonight on-tap at Concordia Ale House in Portland, OR. Was served in snifter glass. Came a golden orange with no head but some carbonation fizzling up. Smell is some tartness and white wine grapes. Taste was simply amazing, tart, hints of honey and chardonnay. Mouthfeel is slightly sweet and tart and really pleasant. Drinkability may not be great for some people, but i was amazed at how great this was. I could have drank this stuff all night."
"between crown cap and cork was a clear liquid layer that smelled of madeira , and vinegar 750 ml. bottle- color of orange honey , with a tick eggshell colored head  delicate nose of sweet white grapes (chardonnay , riesling ) , yeast , lime , sour grass , yellow apples ,and hint of floral hops  taste of wonderful sourness , and tartness , white wine vinegar , chalky , slight maltyness , slight caramel , and barnyard  body is dry , acidic , and a little harsh aftertaste of chalk , white wine , and astringent"
"Drinkability: a pleasant slow sipping lambic that some may be turned off by, but this grow on you. Pretty easy to quaff."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability: This is definitely a celebratory beer, but I could give this a go fairly often with the right food pairing."
"If this style is what you are looking for, then here is your drink."
"drinkability: far too bitter for my preference, however, the complexity is so intriguing and makes this an interesting lambic for sipping and pondering"
"This is one kick ass experimental lambic, one of the tastiest Cantillons Ive had the fortune of tasting. The fresh hops and sourness work better then I was expecting."
"i like this beer, but i couldn't drink two in a row. as much as i enjoyed it, all i wanted afterward was the maltiness of a nice scottish ale"
"Originally reviewed on December 6, 2005. Pours a gushing honey orange hazy pour, with copious off-white head. Sour, ascerbic aroma of brandied pears, olives and some green grapes. Also a little parmesan cheese and some cask aroma. Sour dry flavor of olives, oak and more cheese, all very funky. I dont have much experience with true Lambics, so I never know what to expect or garner from the situation, but even since my run in with NG Sour Brown, Im more interested in wild fermented beers. This is wildly funky beer. In a way, I feel like Im drinking green olive juice. Very much pimento in this beer. Theres a nice subtle, floral sweetness in the background thats lifting and airy, and really brings a lot to the table. This is much more quaffable than my previous experiences with past lambics. Palate is some how dry at first, then finishes sweet and supple. A softness and smoothness to this beer. My bottle keeps gushing. Interesting and woody, a lot of tooth and chewiness. Enjoyable. Tastes old, which I appreciate."
"Fine carbonation yields a smooth mouthfeel that is dominated by a tart oaky flavor. Hints of pear and apple are present underneath the intense tartness. Finish is wet wood."
"M&D: very smooth, almost no fizziness is detected on the mouthfeel, while the texture is rusty and chewy as usual. The body is pretty balanced for a lambic, perhaps due to the amount of hops used at different stages in making this beer. Distinctive from Cantillon's other offerings, with a pronounced edge of hop bitterness and fragrant flavour to make this nice beer apart from other great ales by this traditional brewery. I'd love to try the draught version if it's ever available. A really nice hoppy one this is~~"
"Its one of the Beer axioms I live by, when you see Cantillon on tap, order it! So when I saw this on on tap at My Place in Ct. my choice was a no brainer...this one poured cloudy, dull light amber, with minimal head, lacing etc. Nose was the expected sour, funky ripe apples. IOn the tongue, this classic, unadulterated Lambic continued the theme of sour, but not too sour, apple notes, funky, flavorful, unique, intense, complex, what can I say I love the Cantillon brews and this one was just lovely. Support the producers of these world class artisinal creations."
"D: At first I was taken back by this beer but it grew on me. I couldn't get used to the earthy bitterness but finally adjusted after a while. Not bad."
"this is a very sour but good beer. and a good example of unique craft from cantillon. Well worth a try!"
"750 ml bottle. Iris pours out an orange color topped with a white head. The aroma is more beer-like than the average lambic. There's actually some maltiness in the aroma, along with the expected tartness. The flavor is tart, with a strong lemon flavor. This beer has a pronounced bitterness, probably from the fresh hops used. There's a bit of a woody flavor too. Perhaps not as intense as the gueuze or some of their other beers (or maybe I've built up a tolerance), but this one is not at all lacking in flavor. Spritzy carbonation. Great drinkability. This is a delicious and unique lambic."
"Bottle (per label 2003 batch  per cork 2005 batch) drank in 2006: Poured a hazy orange color lambic with a quite big foamy white head with pretty good retention. Aroma of hops is clearly detectable and I thought it provided an interesting mariage with the sour and brett character of the original lambic. It also seems to help balance the level of acid in the beer, which is a real, plus since I sometime find the Cantillon lambic to be too acid. Horse blanket and farmhouse quality are still apparent as well as the citrusy hops. Very nice experiment from the folks at Cantillon."
"Extremely characterful, dry, vinous, woody taste that does in fact taste much different than other unblended lambics."
"Was tempted to order another (it was only $12 for a 750!) but was distracted by a great (and cheep) beer selection. Will defiantly make it back to pick up some more of this one."
"Bright vibrant red, like kool-aid or a crayon. No head. Extremely tart, strong nose. The taste was intensely tart and sour, maybe even beyond Dogfish Head's Festina Lente. I mean that in a good way, though. I really enjoyed this, and dont know what to compare it to, other than the above mentioned lambic. I dont know if the flavor was supposed to be cherry or raspberry or what. The lowest mark for this lambic was the drinkability. It is pretty intense, and I dont know how much the average lambic drinker could handle."
" Taste is a little tart, and possesses all the characteristics of the smell. This must be sipped to fully appreciate the compexity. Mouthfeel is full, but not thick. Drinkability isn't the best, and I do like this beer."
"This brew pours a clear bronze-amber color. The head is billowy and white, and the lacing is thorough. The aroma is tart, sour, and sweet. The sip is tart with sweetness in the finish, and more tartness in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is light bodied and dry, with nice carbonation. Overall, this is a fine, tasty, relaxing brew."
"Ahhh. It's not my everday beer by any means, but when I get the itch there's nothing like a super fresh super sour funky lambic from Cantillon. Had this one on tap at Sunset. Appears a golden color, with little to no head, and great clarity and shinyness. The best thing about a world class beer like this is the freshness. Everything about it screams fresh and wild. The scents coming off this one are like apple and pear skins, a hayfield, and a slight grassy and herbal hop quality. Taste, as expected, is quite sour, but not unpleasantly so. Complex, musty, funk after taste supports the ripe fruityness and sourness. I don't know if it's just the power of suggestion, but this beer has a really nice hop quality to it that makes it particularly unique. Once again, tastes how a big wild field smells in the fall. Excellent slick yet super dry mouthfeel. An incredibly natural and hedonistic beer."
"From Notes: Tap version sampled at Redbones on a dinner stop home from Maine. Dark slightly hazy orange/sunflower with a nice small but tightly packed head of white/off white foam. Aromas of barnyard funk, and wild yeasts abound, with a nice actual malt base, and some real heavy handed hoping (for a Cantillon) making this one quite unique and different, for a brewery that prides itself on being unique and different. Taste is sharp and funky, sour, with all of the gueuze qualities we know and love. The hops add a slightly citric sharpness to the finish of this one, which is as dry as ever. Mouthfeel is refreshing and bubbly, making this brew totally drinkable. Another great brew from these master lambic makers..."
"750ml bottle with ""2000"" on the cork. The cork bursts out of the bottleneck and several ounces worth of foam goes rushing onto the countertop. I struggle to get the bottle under control. People are already complaining about the smell. I guess that's a good sign. Poured into a champagne flute, the beer is about the same color as raw honey or the light maple tabletop on which it is standing. A single thin, vigorous line of carbonation runs through the liquid, connecting to the bottom of a gruesomely pock-marked, 1/4"" deep head that's the color of dirty dishwater. No cling or lacing. The smell isn't quite as offensive as I had hoped. It remindes me most of malt vinegar, the acidity being more acetic than uric. There are residual odors of cork and yeast. Tastes like sour dirt, and how. Sour enough that I'm wincing after each sip. Horrifying copper sourness rots through a layer of apple skins into a field of dead cabbages and finishes with leather and must. At first, the acids have my tongue trying to turn itself inside out, but the mouthfeel evolves to become refreshing and vibrant. Drinking it begets its own drinkability. Intense, intense stuff; and so complex it'll probably take me a few weeks to figure out if I actually liked it."
"Another amazing cantillon that not only matches, but exceeds its bottled form."
"this is an ok beer, but some other offerings from Cantillon are certainly worthier of my time."
"Intense beer probably over the top for the uniniciated definitely something to be drank with fellow lambic lovers"
"750 ml bottle, corked and capped. Bottled in 2004 on cork. Purchased at Green's in Atlanta, GA."
"from the bottle shared with bieristgut. poured a orangish with a off white head. aroma sour, musty, malts, and some nice hops come out, and hints of fruits. flavor not as sour as the aroma, pears, grapefruit, and malts. this is not one of the styles that I care for that much, but I did like this and glad I got to sample it"
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Another jewel in the Cantillon crown. Perhaps my favorite thus far."
"Shared this bottle with orbitalr0x in Chicago at the Map Room. We had to ""settle"" for this one since they were out of the Vigneronne. Bastards. This beer poured a hazy amber color with a healthy 3 finger head that fell to coat the beer generously. Upon smelling it, I was taken back, even thought I had this beer once before. Sour and fruity notes hit me first, followed with tart and acidic barnyard funkyness kicking me in the face directly afterwards. Wow. The flavor is something that has to be experienced to understand. Immediate sourness and acidic flavors assaulted my tongue. This was as close to making me pucker as a beer can without making me actually do it. Damn, this beer is fine. The feel was moderate with a slight carbonation to keep it lively on the tongue. The flavors and aroma on this one is so far beyond the norm, that it can be nothing but greatness. I had to hide from one of my wife's friends, as she kept stealing drinks from my glass. I had to tell her where she could find a bottle for herself at home."
"Smooth, crisp mouthfeel with small bubbly carbonation. This is so easy to drink and each sip just leaves me wanting more and more. Gueuze and lambic are becoming some of my favorite styles and Cantillon has blown me away so far...I highly recommend Iris and I look forward to trying more of their beers."
"Overall:	I think I like this better than the gueuze- it has very similar characteristics (at least to my palate, which still has a lot to learn), but it isnt quite as overpowering and over the top in sourness and musty farmyard aromas/flavors."
"Overall a very different beer, something that you have to get used to. I would not be able to drink much of this."
"Lambics are an enigma to meso much wildness and unrestrained flavors. This beer was no exception. Ive been sitting on a bottle (cork says its from 2001), and finally gave it a try. Its a truly unique brew. The cork, which was quite damp through half of its volume, was extruded with a loud Pop. The brew is a hazy orange with a billowing white head. Aroma is a mix of deep, woody oak and musty manure. Theres plenty of lemony, vinegar-like acidity going on in the smell as well. Its a totally un-hinged, wild aroma. The taste is solidly acidicit crosses the line from tart to downright mouth-puckering sour. No malt is detectable through the acidity, though there is a notable oak character and bitter hop finish. The oak is not unlike that of a decent Chardonnay. Unfortunately, the sourness made the beer very difficult for me to drink. Maybe it would be a wonderful aperitif, but in anything other than small quantities, its a rough-sell. Extraordinarily interesting, and completely wild"
"Wow, I've got a young one here, picked up at ""From the Vine"" in Columbus. Cork is dated 2004. Cork came out with no gushing. Pours a light orange with a minimal white head that retreats to just the sides of the glass fairly quickly. Nose is not as assertive as previous Cantillon's that I have had. A sharp fruity/citrusy aroma is well guarded by notes of cork. A slight musty smell creeps up at the end, but it remains in the background. Taste is very citric. Large hints of grapefruit are present. Finish is very tart and cutting. Musty flavors are only found in the middle as the finish reminds me a little of lime concentrate, pretty acidic as well. Very unique. I'd like to try this after cellaring for a few years. Out of all the Cantillon's I've had, this is easily the most accessible. A quality beer for sure, but if I had to choose one brand it would be their Gueuze."
"Cork dated 2001 vintage. Pours a glowing orangey-gold color with a frothy off-white colored head. Rich barnyard funk with a bit of honey, oak barrel and pale malts in the aroma. Initially tart, but a honeyed sweetness does shine through, sometimes reminiscent of sour apricot or peach. Ooh, there's some hops in there, too, they interact with the tartness very nicely. Oak barrel aging is evident in the taste, as well. Delicate carbonation is good for this ale. Probably one of the best lambics I've tried."
"We debated somewhat on the drinkability, and pondered if we could spend a whole evening drinking nothing but this amazing brew. I'm definately up for it! Too bad this stuff is so hard to find."
"Memorable!"
"Impressive. Plenty of funky, earthy type flavours. A slight hint of apples. Tons of oak. Acidic, lemony notes lead to a dry, dry finish. Sour, tart, & very complex. Lively, & actually quite refreshing. Light / medium bodied with gentle carbonation."
"A delight for lamibic-geeks only and an occasional treat for weird beer-freaks like yours truly...such an unusual ale, a rare treat, another horse-blanket treasure from the barnyard geniuses!"
"Cantillon Iris was served from a corked (2001), capped, and foiled 750ml bottle. In a chalice, this beautiful beer was a brilliant and shiny copper color, and was topped by an everlasting, fine, and creamy off-white head that left sheets of luxurious lacing wherever it touched. The carbonation was varied and fascinating, consisting of slower small streamers, and large speeding bubbles that would hit the surface with such force they could be seen making bumps in the head from above. The nose presented an aggressive sourness with a soft musty grapefruit component followed by herbal juniper berry and powdery floral perfumy notes. On the palate, an up-front oaky dry sourness with an assertive raw lemon accent explodes then gains a tannic bitterness before slowly dropping off, leaving lingering herbal/grassy earthen lemony aftertastes. The body is very smooth, slick, and richly full, serving to counter and balance the dry oaken sourness. The vigorous carbonation matched well with the flavors and character of this lambic. I found this beautiful all-malt lambic to be wonderfully aromatic, robustly flavorful, and a pleasure to drink."
"Sampled 12/20/03"
"Related notes: My bottle was dated 2002; I sampled in March 2004. Most definitely not a ""pedestrian"" beer."
"Overall: I wish I had started investigating lambics a while ago as I like nearly all I've tried, including Iris. Definitely worth trying out."
"The lack of wheat in this beer seems to make this beer a bit fuller/ richer in the mouth than a typical Lambic product. This beer is not overly hard either, especially for a Cantillon Lambic. This was a wonderful first beer on a Superbowl Sunday afternoon. It paired wonderfully with the aged sharp cheddar, prosciutto, olive oil, balsamic vinegar, and rustic bread. Cantillon definitely delivered once more with this beer. This is a world class beer, whose only flaw, given the specialty designation on this beer, is that perhaps it is not quite distinctive enough from a traditional Lambic, but how can I really complain since I do love Lambic."
"When I told MJR that I had not had this Cantillon, but it was in the tasting queue, he said that he thought it the most easily accessible of the main Cantillon bottlings for those lacking experience with them, and I have to whole-heartedly agree. If you want to taste Cantillon start here. Its definitely less challenging than some of the other offerings as to acidity and funk, but its on par in quality and a hell of a beer by any standard. Simply another awesome beer from Cantillon. 2001 bottling."
"Color is a rusty deep golden clouded yellow, tall fluffy white head bursts up quickly becoming big bubbley and fizzy. Then lays flat to leave a fizzy collar. Lots of thin webby lacing. Aroma is pungently strong, albiet a bit more pleasing then the vulgarly pleasing Vigneronne. This has a steady waft of the funky horse blanket - barnyard thing, without the canned tuna and arrogance that the Vigneronna has. Otherwise its nearly the same with citrusy notes of grapefruit, lime, and lemon, floral deepness with the roots and all, earthy and highly sweet. Taste is quick and tart with citrus rinds of all kinds, moslty lime and grapefruit, dry and sour puckering sweet with nice floral notes creeping in. Lots of layers to the souring tartness, musk, fresh flowers, grasses, sour candies, citric acidicness, dirt, sour, sour, sour. Whew, its packed. Full on tartness, sourness, and sweetness. Its actually not bad, it takes a few sips to get used to, but as you snap your senses around it and it warms, its pretty good. Still though, its a big time sipper with all that tongue drying, cheek puckering, lip tingling sour tartness."
"Lively mouthfeel with refreshing qualities and penetrating acidity keep this beer interesting, and in turn, highly drinkable. Would work quite well on a hot summer day, very slightly chilled (45-50 degrees), with a sampling of robustly flavorful cheeses. I drank this one at cellar temperature and was most pleased with the results. Another wonderful offering from Cantillon's portfolio."
"I wonder if I am just not totally bowled over by lambics...while I enjoy them, they are not getting tremendous marks, I think it could be the mouthfeel..anyway, this was a light peach when poured. Again with the barnyard/horse aroma that could be off-putting to some, I'm just always pleasantly surprised when the beer doesn't taste like it smells. A dry crisp fruityness when tasted. The carbonation is not overwhelming. While not overwhelmingly tart, I can see that this would not be as much as a session beer as others. An interesting beer to drink and enjoy, maybe not one to drink a lot of at one setting. Pat"
"This is quite a shocker. Pour vinigar on a tatami mat and lick it and you will know what this beer tastes like. This was not even a novelty it was just sour (can be good) and bitter (usually a good thing), but together it foul. I kept looking for redeming qualities, but there are none. This is not refreshing, tasty or anything else."
"Once the crown cap was removed the cork moved a quarter inch above the bottle lip on its own. This beer wants to be consumed. I was amazed at the loud pop produced when the cork was removed. 3 years in oak and its still so lively?! The beer poured with a lot more head than I expected and smelled almost like vinegar. I have to stop now and admit that this is the first true lambic I have tried, so the smell worried me a bit. Iris has a nice reddish-tan cloudy appearence. It is a color I find somehow comforting. Its first taste was not as sour as I had assumed by smell, but still very tart. It finished sharply bitter. Once the initial sour shock has passed it smells of apples and grapes. I will agree with past reviewers on the ""grassy"" aftertaste. I am surprised that oak is not discernible. Iris has a nice light mouthfeel - I would have liked to try this in the dead of summer. After reading the love them or hate them comments about true lambics, I am very happy to say that this beer is quite refreshing and I look forward to trying other examples of the style. My only complaint is that no one is here to share the bottle with me, but I doubt any of my friends would understand anyway."
"This lambic is actually copper in color. Gas bubbles rise quickly and steadily. Head is creamy and tan. And also long lasting. Aroma is yeasty, lemony, musty and funky. Pretty cool. The mouthpuckering quotient is pretty high for this one. (Higher than the Cantillon Gueuze I just had the other day.) Tart as hell. Acidic. Lemon Juice. Grassy. A little of that funky barnyard stuff going on. It's almost like sucking on one of those sour gobstoppers. Interesting to say the least. Mouthfeel is nicely carbonated. Maybe medium body at best. Yet again, Cantillon does not disappoint. The masters of the authentic lambic."
"Kind of strange really, very sour yeasty aroma, with hints of parsley, lemongrass and flowers. Quite sour and then bitter, with a grassy earthy flavour, complex and different. I don't think this quite worked, that green stemmy, flowery quality, didn't seem to fit alongside the sour yeastyness. Still, hardcore."
"Drinkability: Quite the change of pace for Cantillon, this is a very enjoyable brew. It's a surprising, and delicious experience...like all of their beers."
"This new friend has personality enough to last a lifetime, but fortunately, you can endure it in somewhat smaller doses, which is good because, for some reason, you'll find yourself always begging for more."
"On the pour a pearlescent orange color, the head Brobdingnagian in size, creamy in its texture, the color a magnificent light tan, the lace a satin sheet to drape the glass. Fruit sweetness followed closely by the vinous aromas tart, clean and quite appealing. Start lightly sweet but the stinging acidity and tartness hits your palate immediately, hops are mild and unassuming, also quite dry and lingering aftertaste, in my humble opinion a quintessential Old Style Lambic!"
"A truly unique beer, that is pseudo-lambic, rare for Cantillon the Masters of Tradition. Another excellent, high quality, offering."
