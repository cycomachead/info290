"Pour is a slight hazed golden orange with a very little bit of thin white head. The nose has a cob web aroma, light spicy yeast, and some soft peach in back. The taste is very dusty cob webb up front, light spice, and a little rubbery. There is some lemon zest in back with a bit of sour apricot as well. The body is light and soft, light carb with a hint of driness."

"A really well balanced lambic, went very well with ripe goat cheese. At a food and beer tasting at De Klomp, Link√∂ping, Sweden."
"The beer feels very smooth as it first hits my palate. It finishes with a light tartness, some oak astringency and a biting quality that is quite light. Fruit flavors linger with notes of apple and some pear that is even more noticeable. This has a nice lactic character to it, though it is not quite as apparent as the Mort Subite Oude Lambik that I just had. A sip of Cantillon Lambic brings out some musty yeast character in this beer. This really has a nice, subtle, but influencing oak character that seems fairly noticeable."
