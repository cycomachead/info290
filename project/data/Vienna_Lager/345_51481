3.76,8.7,4,3,4,4,4,"Fuller bodied than expected with a nice crisp hop presence up front that provides a dry bitterness that lingers over the malt into a sweet and slightly dry finish.  Some grassy pine notes countered by the sweeetness with hints of caramel, toffee and biscuit.  There's some bready yeast adding fullness and light fruit notes in the finish.  Well balanced and easy to drink.  I was pleasantly surprised by this beer.  ","corby112","Apr 02, 2010"
2.88,-16.8,3,2.5,3,3,3,"Brewed by Victory for PJ Whelihan's, as the name would imply. Poured a clear, copper-amber color with a thin, fizzy head, fed by obvious carbonation. Smell of grains, pils malts, and light floral hops; very light. Light body and light taste, sweet German and pils malts, lightly hopped with floral and slight citrus accents. Nothing special, but drinkable at least.","Rifugium","Jul 29, 2009"

3.76,8.7,4,3,4,4,4,"D: I would definitely order this brew again. There is a P.J. Whelihan's right down the road and I can see myself having quite a few of these down the road. It complements any hearty meal, along with their critically acclaimed chicken wings.","MLasoski","0"
