"Lightly hazy deep golden color with a minimal head. Earthy bready pilsner with hints of fruit an floral spicy hops. Nice brew that I returned to a couple of times, but to be world glass it needs to clean up some rough edges."

"Another good, clean, simple and authentic lager from Trapp."

"Overall a tasty malt forward lager."

"Tap: Poured a light clear amber color lager with a small foamy head with good retention and some light lacing. Aroma of light cereal notes with light caramelized malt notes. Taste is a mix of light medium-sweet caramel malt with some cereal and grainy notes. Body is light with good carbonation. Nothing earth shattering here but well balanced and easily drinkable."

"Growler from the brewery. Pours hazy-golden with short-lived white head. Nose is of noble hops and bready malt. Body is medium and crisp. Taste is of noble hops, biscuit malt, cooked vegetables and yeast. Finish is long and clean. Nothing special is going on here but it is still crisp, refreshing brew."

"This beer was decanted from a pitcher and had no head in my glass. Medium copper color with good clarity. Aroma is lightly fruity with noticeable, but not excessive, diacetyl. Very nice flavor coming from bready malts, with a creamy, chewy mouthfeel. Medium carbonation."

"Overall a real satisfying Vienna Lager."
""
"I suspect this is the last one of these I'll have for a while. The Trapp beers come in quart (whoops - liter) flippies which is a format homebrewers like. The Vienna is a toasted hazy gold in the glass and the head was pretty sturdy. Initial smells seem subtle but inviting and get better. It's that first wonderful soft so balanced lager taste that wins every time for this beer and its brewery. An absolute Olympic gold medal winner."

"Got this while on vacation in Stowe. Was looking forward to this brew; a little disappointed. The appearance was light copper in color. It had a decent smell; thought it might have been a little more malty though. Its taste was average at best, nothing spectacular. Overall, a good beer, but again I was looking for something a little more special. I will have to try a different brew next time. I am definately not giving up on this brewery yet."

"Overall this is a very solid lager and true to the style. I also enjoyed their Dunkel lager on tap which was just as enjoyable."
"The Vienna lager is an often overlooked beer style but this example was quite noteworthy. Well balanced and quite flavorful, this could be quite sessionable."
"Drink - A pretty bang on example of the style. The flavour is very well balanced and it would work well as a session beer."

"Poured clear with a good frothy head. Good retention. Smell is sweet malt with a very faint caramel/cotton candy aroma. Taste is moderately sweet malt, commanding but not cloying. There is a faint burnt caramel edge that doesn't quite fit in, and this affects the otherwise near perfect mouthfeel. Very drinkable, would be an A+ if the malt was a little smoother."
"Drinkability is where this beer really shines. It is crisp and clear and provides a mouthfull of taste."
"Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with medium carbonation. A great lager, very smooth and drinkable, very clean, just fantastic stuff."
"drinkability is good. nice balance. crisp and refreshing. a tasty lager!"
"While I found this on tap at american flatbread, I would definitely visit the actual brewery. Very well done and I think this is the brewer's (Allen Van Anda) true calling. You can find the helles lager at the Farmhouse Tap and Brewery as well (I didn't get a chance to sample it there)."
"Taste is very rich and malty and super drinkable. There's a very lIght hoppiness and smooth crisp finish. Really this is an xcelle t xample of the style a bit less toasty than I'd like but very good."
