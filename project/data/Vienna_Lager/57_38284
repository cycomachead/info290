The thing that gets me about this beer is the pretentious bottle -- wrapped in foil as if this is a really rare treat. I'd not be opposed to having it again, but it's just too "blah" for me to warrant ever buying it.","Alextricity","Jun 12, 2013"

4,19.4,4,4,4,4,4,"A quick observation: i have been told by a friend that Bohemia uses artificial colors and additives in it brewing process and that it will give you rather nasty hangover. Though i can advocate the former to be false nor true, i can say that i have yet to experience any kind of hangover from Bohemia Obscura, even at times drinking more than a dozen in one evening.","DavidPantsSmarty","Aug 21, 2012"

It's great for a dry and hot weather, like those in a typical Mexican summer. Highly recommended if you come to Mexico and want to taste something different and better than Corona.","Pexkool","Dec 25, 2011"

3.14,-6.3,3.5,2,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pleasant appearance, but unfortunately a brutal corn syrupy aroma. The higher alcohol content (as compared to most Mexican beers) deepens the flavour profile, which has some maltiness along with the fundamental sweetness and over-riding corn adjuncts. What a shame hops don't seem to have made it south of the border. However there is an underlying slight bitterness to the finish, so this beer is actually growing on me as I finish it...","hopsolutely","Nov 27, 2010"

3.5,4.5,3,3,3.5,4,4,"M/D: Goes down very smooth, extremely drinkable. More complex than most Mexican beers, probably my favorite, but a little harder to find in stores than most in Mexico. If it is available, its what I am drinking.","mdaschaf","Feb 25, 2010"

2.29,-31.6,3,1.5,2,2.5,3.5,"D: As a macro, drinkability is high. This is a little bit more expensive than most of mexican macro beers, and could be the best of them. Very good to pair with spicy mexican food.","jazztoloc","May 29, 2009"

4.05,20.9,4,4,4,3.5,4.5,"Perfect choice. Screw overpriced coronas at the Mexican shores. Get a 6 pack from the local Wal Mart for $60 mxn...you save money and get 6 delicious beers. This beats easily most other Cuahtemoc beers and Modelo beers. Remember, this is not the regular Bohemia, this one is Bohemia Oscura and has a silver seal on top instead of gold. Very recommended!","WildMaverick1200","Jul 09, 2008"

3.85,14.9,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Tastes of smooth malts with nutty caramel and lingering coffee undertones. Feel is quite nice. The light coffee sticks around in the finish and is met with some malts for a balanced close. Not very sweet and light on the tongue with just the right amount of carbonation. Easy drinking. Dark and reasonably complex yet smooth, making it well suited for the typical weather of its homeland.","HalfFull","Dec 23, 2007"
3.33,-0.6,3.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,"Sometimes it is creamy somwtimes it is quite alcoholic. BUt it has softer aroma than the regular. It broke the myth of Bohemia being a dark one. It is malty in tste and I prefeer it over the other one. The quality is good but not exceptional. Let us say it is a potable beer in here.","nekronos","Aug 20, 2007"
