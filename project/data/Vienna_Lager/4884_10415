Fairly sweet nose, caramel and toasted malt, maybe some slight diacetyl. Creamy, smooth body with light carbonation and finish of slight hop bitterness. Flavor again has a slight diacetyl presence which is distracting. Regardless, flavor has strong toasted malt backbone, light grain flavors but overall just feels flat and lifeless. Not bad, but a little more carbonation would help. Drinkability is hurt by diacetyl presence.","yourefragile","May 26, 2009"

Taste is a clean/crisp bready malt with a hint of bitterness midway through. Aftertaste is a honey sweetness with a bit of salty butter. Mouthfeel is light bodied with a fair amount of carbonation that leaves an unexpected dry mouth. Pretty good beer that goes down quite easily.

Malts, wood, grain, husk, a note of bread and dough. Again, quite nice. The mouthfeel is uneventful, with little carbonation making it to the tongue. A step above water, otherwise.

It has a crisp and dry malty flavor that goes down easy and finishes slightly bitter. The hops linger in the aftertaste; very nice. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a good drinking German Octoberfest. It has excellent flavor and aroma; a good drinker.","WesWes","Oct 12, 2004"

But this Amber-Colored Beer is exceptionally smooth and soft. Very pretty new Flip-Top Bottle; giving it the look of a turn of the century brew.","Dasa1044","Nov 21, 2003"
