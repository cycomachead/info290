"Overall, this is a delicious beer that is built to be paired with food of all types. I recommend using it to wash down a hearty black-bean burrito with spicy salsa and rich guacamole."
"Solid but taste like a west coast hoppy lager, not much Danish about it."

"quality lager here, and the vienna style never really does much for me, but this one never gets sweet, and relies more on a special red type malt than the same generic medium crystal we always see, and the yeast character adds a lot to a beer that usually has very little of it. frothy looking light amber brew, to call it red is a stretch, but it has great clarity and it holds its head. the nose on it s really muted, almost stale and with a wet cardboard thing, it doesnt smell real nice at all honestly, but the taste is lovely. dry but still malty is hard to do, refreshing in the finish with a light dried fruit character and the lager yeast. hops arent robust, but the beer is well balanced. light enough to drink a ton of, good in all seasons, and finally an example of a vienna lager that i would buy again."

"Flavor is clean and also pleasantly malty, bready with a light plum ester, dry finish with trace hop bitterness. Light and medium bodied with very little sweetness if at all. Pairs well with food. Thanks to WST for this one!"

"first time I had this beer was in a bomber that I overpaid for, drank it alone and was not super impressed. tried it again tonight, this time in a 12 oz bottle, with food and found it quite enjoyable, and definitely superior to something like Sam Adams Boston Lager. this is a smooth and easy drinking Vienna style lager, I will drink it again."

"Was hoping for a bit more, but I wasn’t terribly happy about this beer. Definitely decent for the style, but that’s it."

"I love how they just throw it out there, ""Danish Style Red Ale", as if amber ales from Denmark are so commonplace that we all immediately go, ""Oh yea, that Danish style of red beer."" Maybe someday the Danes will become known for their red ales and we'll have Figeuroa Mountain to thank."

"D- Quite enjoyable. A bit overpriced, but I am a sucker for a good Vienna Lager."

"Overall great Euro style red ale - reminds me of a modern version of Old Speckled Hen or the likes. Nothing out of the ordinary just a solid take on an old style."
"Overall can't recommend wanted to but can't."
"M- lighter than average carbonation. Medium body. Sticky and cloying as it warms. Nasty. 1.5"

"Another new brewery out of nowhere. Photo of the 22 oz bottle purchased at Bottleworks in San Diego."

"Pours a clear copper with a foamy bone colored head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, caramel, and some slight metallic notes. Taste is much the same along with some herbal hop flavors. There is a mild hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is drinkable but pretty basic."
"Finish is a malty bitter, burnt toast/roasted grain bitter that is long lasting."
"Great color, head retention, and lacing. Brilliant amber colored, thick rings of lace around the glass, and a head that lasts forever. Not so much is the aroma, which is mostly a mild toasty sensation (no rhyme intended). However, the taste is an improvement, where the toasty malt is more intense, some bread crust is thrown in, and is a little fruity. Light bodied, crisp, refreshing. Reasonable beer, like a beefier version of Yeungling."
"The color was a medium reddish brown with a medium amount of white foam and some lace. The smell of lightly roasted malts and the aroma of soft hops was evident in to aroma. The taste was one of the best Danish Reds i've ever had. Nicely balanced in aroma and flavor. Suttle and not overly bitter or sweet. What a pleasant surprise."

"Not bad, nice to see more lagers, but this really wasn't something I will go back to."
"O: Decent. Has this great mineral quality in the body of the beer, so it quaff's pretty crisp & refreshing for what it is."
