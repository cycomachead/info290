Aroma is a blend of toast & biscuity malt, notes of honey, fruit jelly/marmalade like notes of pear & maybe a hint of peach, cobbler like with a faint grassy hop hint. Taste is malty-sweet up front with the same fruit jelly/marmalade like notes of pear & maybe a hint of peach, cobbler like with less honey than the nose, then come notes of biscuit, toast, caramel, a hint of butter & grassy/herbal hops.  Dry in the finish with an astringent & bitter aftertaste with mineral & metallic hints. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation, silky, maybe even a little slick with a nice prickle over the tongue.","mothmanscott","Feb 03, 2015"

A decent amount of lacing is seen when sipped, like a good German brew. The aroma is of malts for the most part. Pretty much the same is for the drink with a slight hoppy and bitter finish. Medium-bodied and good carbonation. Overall, really not a big fan of this type of brew.","BeerWithMike","Nov 08, 2014"

3.68,1.7,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"16 ounce bottle into lager glass, bottled on 6/28/2012. Pours lightly hazy deep golden amber color with a 1 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of caramel, biscuit, toast, brown sugar, pear, apple, raisin, herbal, floral, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of bready malt and fruity yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of caramel, biscuit, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, pear, apple, herbal, floral, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of caramel, biscuit, toast, brown sugar, pear, apple, herbal, light pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Good balance and solid robustness of bready malts with fruity/earthy yeast ester flavors; with a good malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish, Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and lightly bready mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice vienna lager. Good balance of bready malt and fruity yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Feb 16, 2014"

And now it's in cans (so it tastes like it was just made). Picked-it up last night (cold) and took it home. Poured deep golden/amber with nice 1/2 inch cream-color foam on top. Ample carbonation brought out a subtle malt smell and hint of bitterness in the nose. Initial taste was biscuity malt with a hint (just enough) of sweetness, followed by a refreshing hops bitterness that immediately tickles the taste buds and makes your mouth water. As it warmed, it just got better, lacing the glass all the way down. Very well balanced, very drinkable (maybe too drinkable) and yet with a craft-brew mouthfeel and only 5% ABV, it was hard to put down. Excellent!","tugdriver7","Mar 13, 2013"

Smells mostly of heavy caramel malt, bready yeasty notes, and some very mild earthy and spice hop aspects. Taste is like graham crackers and nut-tinged malts stampeding all over your tongue. The mild hop presence doesn't even appear until the finish, and even than it is an understated kiss goodnight of noble hops on your lips. It could use a small boost to those noble hops. However, the body is the main issue with this brew. To my mouth, this beer comes across as thin and watery, if only it had a slightly chewier texture, or just a bit heavier body, than I would have to search really damn hard to find something else to nitpick.","WastingFreetime","Aug 14, 2011"

I let it settle down, as I always do with little kids, taking a W. C. Fields stance towards them. The Glug resulted in a dense rocky finger of tawny head with modest retention. As to color, this was truth in advertising at its finest - a beautiful, deep amber bordering on copper with NE-quality clarity. When I see women with a natural head of hair this color, I fall instantly in lust. I turn into Lennie from ""Of Mice and Men", wanting to touch their hair and jabbering on about freckles and pale skin. Sometimes, it actually works! This beer was equally beautiful. The nose had a caramel malt sweetness to it and while that may not be enticing to me, it was not off-putting, either. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full with a grassy light astringency on the tongue. Finish had a mild grassy bitterness overlaying the light sweetness underneath. I am definitely getting some of this for the cooler!","woodychandler","Jul 11, 2011"

3.23,-10.8,3.5,3,3.5,3,3,"Funny how ""special"" has a few meanings, each with its own level of prestige, so to speak. Let's see where this beer lands within that spectrum: It pours a clear amber (how thoroughly apropos) topped by a half-finger of slightly off-white foam. The nose comprises biscuits, graham crackers, and a touch of caramel. It's like a dry, slightly woody (dammit, I forgot to mention the hint of balsa, didn't I?) malt-bomb of the highest order. The taste brings in some mandarin orange and decidedly mild flowers, but these are in turn enveloped by the caramel and graham-influencing honey. It's a lot more nuanced than the smell, and the balance, though off, isn't altogether lost. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a feel that leans toward watery without ever actually making it all the way there. Overall, an okay Vienna, but way too one-sided and too thin to really produce a wow factor.","TMoney2591","Jun 15, 2011"

3.53,-2.5,3.5,3,4,3,3.5,"The amber lager pours deep golden color with good clarity. A thin white head formed, but diminished soon after pouring. The aroma of the beer is moderate malty, mainly caramel sweetness, with a little toasted grains as well as a low floral/earthy aroma from the hops. The taste is rather malty, but not overly sweet. Flavors upfront are much like the smell, predominately caramel like, malty sweetness, the finish has moderate amounts of flavors of more toasted malts, as well as a little earthy hop flavor, and leaves the mouth slightly dry. The carbonation is on the higher end and mouthfeel is medium-full bodied. The drinkability of the beer is decent. Overall I think the beer is well balanced, but nothing really stood out as great. I enjoy the finish the best, when the toasted grain shines, hop bitterness pokes through and leaves the mouth feeling slightly dry. From the description on the bottle I was anticipating more hop aroma, but really didnÂ’t find too much. Overall a solid beer but I didnÂ’t find anything too striking.","uwmgdman","Feb 16, 2007"

The taste is average. It has a very bitter hop flavor that goes down slow and finishes dry with some residual malt sweetness. It has a metallic aftertaste that seems to be due to overwhelming amount of hop character. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation.

Even when it diminishes, there is a good 1/4 inch head that stays to the end. Aroma is all about caramel and roasted malt, with the aroma of hops there to balance it out. Flavor achieves a wonderful balance between sweetness and bitterness. The sweetness coming in the form of sweet malt with hints of caramel and molasses. The bitterness coming from the darkly roasted malts and hops. In the realm of mouthfeel, a very ""middle of the road"" dark beer. Not nearly as thick and heavy as some dark beers but with a nice body that says that you are drinking a full flavored darker beer. This is a great beer to linger over.","petercmartin1","Aug 28, 2005"

4,10.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a bright, clear copper-amber color and is topped by a light tan to cream colored head. The aroma has notes of bread, caramel, lightly toasted malts, crackers, and perhaps a faint grassy suggestion of hops. The taste is clean, dry up front, yet off dry in the middle and finish. There is a lightly spicy hop component and a corresponding clean hop bit in the finish which perfectly balances the residual malty sweetness that is left in this beer. The malts manifest themselves with flavors of biscuits, toast, and a nice caramel note. The hop character of this beer is quite nice, and really starts to open up as this beer warms in my glass. This is a really nice Vienna Lager, it is pretty much spot on for the style. For those who appreciate the subtlety that is this style, this is definitely well worth seeking out.","Gueuzedude","Aug 02, 2004"

Good crispness in the mouth, yet a bit of the Sprecher over the top cloying-ness can be found in this offering as well as most others. Malt dominates the taste profile in a big way.

Taste has about the same notions as its aroma with malts lasting throughout with some roasted character, lightly breadish sweetness rouse in and out, light crisp hops that are slightly dried sneak in towards its pilsner like finish.

Poured an amber color that was clear and transparent with a medium sized creamy off-white head. I noticed quite a mixture of malts and hops in the aroma but nothing I could really distinguish. At first sip I immediately noticed toasted Vienna malts come alive. Strong flavor there. The bitter hops followed that toasted malt flavor. After that more malty flavors showed which included biscuit, caramel, and some light fruit taste. Finishes with some more hop kick. This is quite nice and very thick for an amber.

Hops are present throughout, but more apparent in the finish, which seemed too bitter and citric for my liking.
