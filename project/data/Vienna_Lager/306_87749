1.5,-50.2,2.5,1.25,1.25,2,1.75,"I used to enjoy this beer, but I opened one today and poured it down the sink. The aroma is completely wrong for an amber ale, and reminds me of a coors lite. If I had any, I would do a comparison. The taste of this beer is also terrible and is reminiscent of a budmillercoors lager and is not anything like an amber ale. There is a faint hint of toasty malt but the aftertaste is more like that of a cheap lager. This beer is also very sweet.","Greatblueheronbrewing","Mar 27, 2015"

2.47,-17.9,3.5,1.5,2.5,3.5,2.75,"High hopes came with a very nice pour of clear honey color, a 2 finger head and plenty of carbonation. head slowly subsided and disappeared in about 2 minutes but left some lace about halfway down. The initial aroma was faint but pleasant, sweet malt but went away quickly never to return again. I liked the carbonation and crisp mouthfeel but taste was blah, to be kind, with some kind bitter, not in a nice hoppy way, after taste. I'll pass on any more of these.","classixIII","Mar 12, 2015"

I hate to say this as a long time union member but the boys in Ft. Worth are brewing some excellent beers. Check out the Fosters Oil cans from the same brewery. Best Fosters ever.

Taste is also mild, malty, a bit of grains, refreshing but bland. Feels light in the mouth and overall not terrible, but nothing special about this beer.","tone77","Jul 24, 2014"

3.92,30.2,5,3,4.25,4,4,"Bought a 6-pack of this at the grocery store liquor store because I noticed it was on sale. Drank from the bottle poured into my beer glass. Tried it both cold, and again when it warmed to room temperature. I really liked the appearance of this one- a rich, golden red. 1/2"" head that dissipated very rapidly. Very very light lacing on the glass. The carbonation was decent, but almost too much for my taste. Very light smell- hard to pick it up, but I'd describe it as wheaty with a light caramel apple in the background. Taste was excellent. Very flavorful, but not too strong or overpowering. Malt, grass, citrus, and apple with a very light bitter citrus aftertaste. I actually liked the beer better after it warmed up to room temperature. The taste became much more sweet and defined. I had mixed feelings about this beer before trying it. I had heard good things about it, but wasn't sure how it would be, especially since it's made by Coors. I'm happy to say that I really enjoyed this beer and would definitely drink it again.","boogieman","Jun 25, 2014"

I like the color of this brew- not too light, but not too dark. Third shift has a an abv of 5.3. The smell is rich and sweet. There is nothing bad about the smell of this brew. The taste is rich with a hit of sweetness but a bitterness at the end. For being a dark amber brew it is well balanced. No hard after taste at the end. This brew is not overpowering but not underpowering. Third Shift Amber goes down smooth with a little bit of bitterness at the end. Over all I'm giving this brew a 3.75 out of 5.

Granted, the harshness alleviated somewhat upon the third and forth tastings, but I'm left with an aversion to drinking it.

Faint biscuit malt and caramel flavor with a hint of spicy peppery hops, not really bad in the flavors just in the sense of texture that it tastes like a mass produced product with a harshness that's hard to describe with loving and discriminatory words. It's just not that good and sales will project the same opinion especially for the price point this beer has I'm glad I found an individual can to review, not bad really after one it's not bad could a pour another in my glass, hell no.

Now that I hit the site, I see it's a Coors product and a sister to Batch 19. Hey, if Coors starts putting out rich, flavorful lagers at this price point, more power to them. Drinking $12 bombers and $15 4-packs gets expensive damn quick, and if I'm going to be occasionally forced by my budget into the lower tier, I applaud the lower tier rising up to meet and even exceed my expectations.

Poured a light amber with better head retention than Batch 19, lighter color and less viscous looking. The smell is much more subdued; slight caramel and toasted bread, no scent of hops at all. Very easy drinking and smooth taste that follows the nose; subdued caramel, lightly toasted grains, slightly nutty. A barely-there hop presence hides in the backbone. The mouthfeel is medium-thin and the carbonation is appropriate. This beer is very easy to drink and sessionable, but I also see this as the main flaw as this beer just has no ""wow factor"" to it. I preferred the thicker, rougher, more characterful taste of Batch 19. Easy to drink, tasty, and finely made, this is still not the best example of an American amber lager. Samuel Adams still dominates in that category but Third Shift is worth picking up if the price is right. (Paid 9.99 on sale at Rite-Aid.)","Aaron_Ramson","Apr 03, 2013"

Mouthfeel is light, CO2 is on target. On the balance, the beer is very much in the mold of Killians and other mass-produced reds and ambers brewed with the lager yeast and processes the big boys use. I've had this beer again since the original review was logged on April 2013. It has disappointed me even more this time. It seemed blander and more metallic. Never again.

I am going to guess and place it at 15 degrees Lovibond. Nose had a honey-wheat bread quality which seemed okay to me. I have grown so tired of adjunct-filled lagers that any lager that smells like something other than cobbled together liquid will get my vote. Mouthfeel was big and full, not overly carbonated, but dense. The flavor was quite sweet, caramel and bread bein the prevalent tastes. Finish was semi-sweet, not overly sweet and refreshing.

Third Shift isn't bad looking at all, it's a nice orange-amber color with a large head that retains well for a Coors product. The aroma lets me down right away though. There's the distinctive ""wet dog"" aroma that I associate with every American Adjunct Lager. There's a touch more malts in the background, but beyond that it's remarkably similar to a Coors Heavy. The taste starts off stronger with a nice caramel malt, but quickly collapses into the same AAL finish I'd expect from a Coors product. The mouthfeel is nice though, it's got a heavier body than a normal Coors and a spot-on carbonation level, and the drinkability is solid enough. Overall, it's basically Yuengling but worse. It's a step up from the average Coors product for sure, and something I'd get if there were no better options. Gotta say though, I love seeing Union Made on the label!","shand","Mar 08, 2013"

I generally like a hoppy malty type of beer,but I am not too snobby about it,and I think that Third-Shift would fare pretty well against similar craft beers,IF it were done in a blinded taste test,as I suspect that some people would dismiss it out of hand if they knew it's pedigree. So my advice is to try it with an open mind,and consider that it's a decent,more interesting beer for the price of a more common,less interesting one.","tmac57","Mar 04, 2013"

Anyways seen this in 16oz cans and bought two. The apperence to me not really amber more like a bud but more orange i guess. the head didnt last to long, and leaves a tiny ring aorund the glass. Smell is pretty good, though i do smell corn but not sure if it is used in the beer. toasted malt no spice no hops maybe nutty. The taste to me is just like the bud crown if you have had that, this is very much the same, toasted malt i do taste the corn but not over done. sweet nutty after taste, enough hops to balance the beer pretty good for what this is. This beer to me is coors/miller way to compete with bud crown which it does, and i also think the whole amber lager kinda crafty thing is a way for both of these companys to compete with yeungling. though i think yeungling beats both by far with a more session abv at 4.4. I will say it is better then any american lager from BMC. though ill take yeungling if i can find it over this.","DrewsBrews450","Mar 02, 2013"
