3.5,-1.7,,,,,,"Overall - The malts in this brew are definitely a stand out. Would like to have had just a little more hops to add a little more balance. Otherwise, a tasty Vienna lager.","leaddog","Jun 30, 2014"
2.87,-19.4,3.75,3,2.75,2.75,2.75,"The beer poured a clear amber with a big head that didn't last long. The nose is some light breadiness. The taste starts with some slightly piney hops with just a little bit of sweetness to offset it. The hop oils linger on the palate and make for a bit of a cloying aftertaste. The alcohol is present as well, giving it a little bit of warming. The mouthfeel is slightly carbonated with a little thickness. Not a bad beer, by any means. It just doesn't bring a ton to the table and feels a little off-balanced.","TheTrevor","May 01, 2014"

2.48,-30.3,3,2.5,2.5,2,2.5,"Bottle: Poured a light clear copper color Vienna with a medium foamy head with good carbonation and some light lacing. Aroma of biscuit malt with light caramel malt is good. Taste is dominated by light dry caramel malt with light gain notes. Body is about average with good carbonation. Nothing really special here.","Phyl21ca","Nov 02, 2012"

3.78,6.2,4,3.5,4,3,4,"Not a bad everyday drink, has a good flavour to it. Caramel malts dominate and beer has a good texture and flavour profile. Only improvement would be to have the caramel slightly less cloying/sweet. I'd still recommend it, very sessionable, and a good profile of the style.","mick303","Beers"
3.57,0.3,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with decent flavors and aromas. Very refreshing.","SebD","0"
4.02,12.9,3,3.5,4,4,5,"Final Thoughts: If you want a beer to teach you Macro buddies on what beer should be, try them on this. It has a high drinkability but a rich malty flavour that should win people over the generic straw taste of so many lagers. I really have to try more of King's offerings because this was great.","TheHammer","Jul 04, 2012"
3.62,1.7,3,3.5,4,3,3.5,"This is a style I tend to overlook, as there just aren't very many quality ones available around here. Not being an expert in Vienna lagers, perhaps the only useful information I can offer is this - it's a better choice than Dos Equis Amber. Definitely worth a try, and something I'll probably pick up again some time.","thehyperduck","Jun 25, 2012"
3.8,6.7,4,4,3.5,4,4,"O - I can't say that I'm overly familiar with the style, but I can certainly say this was a non-offensive, flavourful and easy drinking offering. Worth a try and I would certainly down a 6-er of this, no problem.","andrenaline","May 30, 2012"
3.7,3.9,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Having experienced very few examples of the style, all I can say is that this does a fair job of hitting the majority of the academic laundry list of points, and is enjoyable enough to have more than a few, in addition to conveniently being BBQ and boardgame friendly.","biboergosum","Feb 01, 2012"
3.99,12.1,3,4,4,4.5,4,"Copper coloured, with a large off-white head. Poor retention and spotty lace. Clean aroma shows bread, toasty, and light floral notes. Bread crust and mild nut flavours up front, with very low hop bitterness in its short short finish. Light-medium bodied with low carbonation - it's mouthfeel is smooth and crisp. A bit delicate, but easily and enjoyably sessionable.","mintjellie","Nov 28, 2011"

4.11,15.4,5,4,4,4.5,4,"A beer of this sort is fit for a wide range beer drinking experiences. It will certainly shine on its own with great company, but will also be a wonderful pairing with soft cheeses, turkey, grilled or roasted chicken, vinaigrette salads, light deserts, spice and hearty fare, as well as classic pub food. My personal favorite is fish and chips.","StephenRich","Nov 20, 2011"

3.6,1.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Canada's King Vienna Lager would take backseat to no authentic European offering - it demonstrates every bit the quality and craftsmanship of those original, old-world brands. And it's engineered for German-levels of consumption too! A six pack of this stuff will not last long. Another good King rendition of a Germanic classic.","biegaman","Aug 31, 2011"
3.47,-2.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Overall: It's alright actually. A well done lager that is a bit average but overall worthy of attention.","papat444","Aug 28, 2011"
3.33,-6.5,3.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,"Though not as grand as their pilsner, King's vienna lager is a decent, serviceable brew that would make for a fine patio/bbq sixer to bring along. A bit more assertiveness and more body would have made this a stellar brew (compare with Great Lakes Eliot Ness).","JohnnyBarman","Aug 27, 2011"
3.65,2.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Overall I think this is a good example of the traditional Vienna Lager beer style. Not my own personal favourite, but would recommend to anyone who enjoys that style.","hopsolutely","Aug 02, 2011"

3.62,1.7,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Another solid entry from King Brewery. I don't like it as much as their pilsner, but this is a really accessible, easy-drinking beer that will likely find its way into my regular rotation for dinner parties.","bryehn","Apr 26, 2011"
3.68,3.4,4,3.5,4,3,3.5,"Overall a fairly text book example of the style that aims for greatness but falls just short for me. I wish it had a little more oomph and body. It's incredibly drinkable though.","MeisterBurger","Aug 29, 2010"
3.68,3.4,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Pours gold, with hints of orange. Creamy head, nice lacing is left. Some grain, general bready notes. Mild caramel and some light floral hops. Taste has more grain, bread, red apple, caramel, lager yeastiness. Medium mouthfeel and a medium-low carbonation. Simple and another well crafted beer from King. Something "sessionable" I could revisit, and hope this will see bottle distribution at some point.","liamt07","Aug 29, 2010"
3.78,6.2,4,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,"On tap at Beer Bistro. Pours an amber-orange colour with white head and a little bit of lacing. Smells of mild hops and sweet bready malt. Flavour has a small amount of refreshing bitterness, but the sweetness comes through more. Carbonation was good. This was a good beer to start off a warm Sunday afternoon. I've been impressed with everything I've tried from King.","kwjd","Aug 22, 2010"
3.45,-3.1,4,4,3,3.5,3.5,"On tap at Beer Bistro. Slightly reddish tinge body with some lace. Great malt aroma. Dryish lager, balanced and easy drinking.A tad sweet. Bang on for the style,as this brewery accomplishes consistently, and likely my more or less average rating for this pleasant style over the years.","Sammy","Beers"
