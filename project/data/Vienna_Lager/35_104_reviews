"Maybe this is rated so high because it's the most well-known ""craft"" beer, but it's just not my style.  There's only been one beer that I've not been able to even finish half of and this isn't it, but I will definitely never drink it again."
""
""
""
""
"Lovely... fruity followed by a mellow malty after taste.... wow..."
""
"This beer smells very good, but it leaves an odd flavour in the aftertaste, didn´t like that."
""
""
""
""
""
"ok for last resort crft beer"
"Great Beer. always start with this one at a bar"
"It was a very blan ipa. Not satisfied"
"-still,a very good amber lager"
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
"I don't get the hype with the beer, it just ain't that good, and I've had a bunch. Not a good beer at all, overhyped for a macrobrew."
"Very good taste.  Distinctive, not overbearing.  Great beer."
""
"When someone says ""do you want to get a beer"" this is the first beer I think of."
""
"Great smell and color. Better than average taste. A classic."
""
""
"ok slight skunky smell still a decent beer"
""
"Boston Lager is a solid brew to introduce a novice into the world of craft brewing. It's approachable and crisp. A smooth lager that is relatively common everywhere. I often pick up a 6-pack at lower stocked store that mainly carry the ""Big Brands""."
"This is a pretty good beer for a pretty good price. The hops have a very prominent appearance in its flavor, but also there is a malty sweetness to it as well that makes a great combination."
"Forget the haters, Sam Adams is my go to sports bar beer. It was the first craft you could even get and still hits the spot."
""
"This is a great lager. Looks and smells great, the taste doesn't really have much of a ""bite"" but it still has good malt and just enough hoppiness. Very smooth and enjoyable. A classic."
"I like this beer and look forward to my next drink."
""
""
"I enjoyed the crisp and overall feel!"
""
""
""
"First craft beer I've ever bought/drinken and it did not disappoint. Looks good, smells good, goes down smoothly and tastes great. Flavors are balanced well with a little spice and fills you up. One pint left me completely satisfied. Definitely my go-to beer now."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's a decent beer. Not bad. Something you would show to friends who are looking to get into beers."

"I'm not such a fan of lagers in general, so I guess it's no surprise that I didn't like this so much, I was kind of hoping a lager from a craft brewery would change that though. It didn't, I guess I just have to give up on this style altogether."
"Excellent lager. Way ahead of the macros. Very good flavor with crisp clean finish."
""
""
""
"Overall : Great craft having incredible rich smooth flavors, but with a strange nose indeed."
""
""
"Either much maligned or much loved, Sam Adams is a solid choice when you want a beer with more flavour. Vienna Lagers are under appreciated and this beer compares favourably. It has a nice robust malt profile, a bit of spice, and bittering hops. It's worth periodic revisits because it is widely available, even here in the Great White North."
""
"This is a good beer. Very complex flavor but its full and robust. Not a bit smooth."
""
"Barely better than BMC, terrible."
""
""
""
""
"Great look.  Not big on lagers but this is a winner"
"3/3 (Draft - Houlihans Chicago) - Copper pour with minimal head and carbonation. Mild malt aroma, not very strong with a light texture and feel. OK beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Great beer to drink with your buddies at the sports bar"
""
""
""
""
"Did not enjoy this beer at all. It is what Alexander Keith's is to Americans. It's a mass produced knock off attempt at a craft brew."

"Beautiful Amber color with great aroma and taste. Not overpowering in flavor and is for the casual drinker looking to enjoy a few beers at parties. You can drink these like your typical party beers (Bud, Coors, etc.) but enjoy added flavor with every sip."
"ok regular bar beer enough said!"
""
"This is where it all started. My taste palette developed so much. Still a great lager"
""
""
"It taste like beer. It doesn't have the watery flavor of coors or bud."
""
"This is the beer that popped my cherry into  more hop forward beers. I'm a sucker for IPAs now but this is still a solid go to beer. You can't go wrong with a Boston lager. Beautiful look lacing smell taste mouthfeel. It's just all around a great brew. If you are someone who has only had pilsners and other american adjacent lagers and are looking to step up in the beer world toward the hops route. This is a great starter and solid cession brew"
"I'm a darker beer fan but I like this beer. Will always drink over domestics if it's on tap."
""
""
""
""
""
"It's the most famous but not their best"
""
""
"On draft at LaGuardia the other day, I'd rate this as the best Boston Lager I've had.  I think it has evolved, it is less aggressive in hop character, less astringent.  Very good classic helles flavors which you notice more in the aftertaste."
""
"Good everyday lager with lots of flavor...a classic!"
""
""
"Outstanding beer, that is available on a budget. It is easy to locate, cheap and has a beautiful look to it when poured. Goes down easily, and doesn't fill you up too quickly. It's a smooth beer that can be drank all day everyday, and you won't get sick of it."

"12 oz. bottle from Trader Joe’s. Deep golden color with a rich creamy head. Smell is slightly hoppy. Taste of caramel malt and grains combine for a silky, creamy palate. Good carbonation. Balanced, dry, slightly bitter finish. It’s hard to find fault here. It’s just a fine basic lager that is, thankfully, widely available. A standard."
""
"Good beer, I enjoy Sam Adams."
""
"Great Beer! The taste is smooth and rich. It's a must for the Fall season."
""
""
""
""

""
""
"It's Samuel Adams you bet it's good."
""
"Of all the widely available lagers, this one is different and has both good taste and mouthfeel."
"This beer is so over looked in our craft mania world....the fact that this beer was Koch's Great Grandfather's recipe from the 1800's is so cool.....and remember this beer along with Bell's Amber Ale and others really kicked off the beer revolution we know today....so take a step back and try a six pack....you won't be disappointed!"
""
""
""
""
""
"This is in my top 5 of favorites. Great taste and feel."
"Overall: A archetypal beer to me. Nothing super exciting, but solid."
""

"Middle of the road. It's whatever"
""
""
""
"Great standard beer..awesome lager IMHO ..clean crispn great balance always available always great"
"A go to for me.  Perfect balance of sessionability, malt profile & hops."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is clean, smooth, malty sweet. Some hops detected on the finish, but not much. Very, very smooth and highly sessionable. Lots of flavor to enjoy here."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: this brew is a usual for me, would recommend everyone to try, one of the best lagers"
""
""
"The best everyday lager you can drink !!"

"12 oz. bottle at the Greenspring Holiday Party in Springfield, VA; unknown brewing/packaging dates; drank out of the bottle over 30 minutes"
""
""
"Pours a golden amber and smells sweet, floral and malty. Sweet malts up front, caramel notes and maybe some pine towards the end. Body and carbonation is medium. Not an outstanding beer but I can always count on it as a good option in an average bar."
""
"Have had this in bottle and on tap on numerous 0ccasions over the years. A safe choice when other offerings aren't available. Always solid and consistent."
""
"Really enjoyed this right out of the bottle. Enjoy the malt flavors that linger just right. I can see why it is a go to for many."
""
""
"Smooth, crisp, and refreshing beer for any occasion."
""
"Outstanding. Flavorful and crisp. Enjoy any day of the week 10 times over"

"Balanced, with a lot of character. Everything you wish from a good beer"
""
""
""
""
"Way overrated. This is not a good beer / lager. Whether from the tap or bottle, it always has a hint of vinegar (smell and taste). Not worth the ""premium"" charge."
""
"Pioneer of craft. Definately surpassed in that field! But thanks for getting the taste of crack and hooker spit out of my mouth at 9 am that one wednesday. You totally saved my job and marriage."

"I will take this over a macro brew any day."

"The beer pours a bright tangerine color with lively carbonation that sends bubbles streaming to the surface. This one could grace a beer commercial. Perfect, thick white head that falls gradually with lacing all the way to the rim. Impressive. Fruity esters and a buttery malt aroma in the nose. A little bit of citrus and spice from the hops. The flavor is malty, complex and delicious. I think we beer advocates forget just how good this beer truly is. There's just a touch of caramel sweetness, with cereal grain and a well-balanced bitterness in the finish. Hints of orange peel spice and some toffee on the tongue. The body is remarkably fuller than one might expect. I attribute this to a little sleight of hand with the aggressive carbonation. The prickly suds convey a creamy mouthfeel and feign fullness with masterful precision. Nice clean finish that begs for another gulp. At under 5% ABV, this is a powerhouse of flavor and texture. I cannot think of a single small lager that packs as much moxie as the flagship beer from Boston. Still world class in today's glut of aspiring craft kings."
"Don't like everything Sam Adams puts out but there flagship is defiantly done right. You have to think about what style you are drinking.This beer is perfect the way it is."
""
""
""
""
"A classic go to beer!"
""
""
"Great beer for everyday. Good beer to introduce new drinkers to craft beer."
""
""
"Boston lager from Sam Adams is a great example of how all good beers don't need to be micro-brews with small name labels.  Sam Adams really does put some great care into their brewing and definitely stands out to me and continues to even after trying beers such as Heady Topper and other micro brews with very high ratings.  Thats not to say that Boston Lager is better than these beers but it definitely holds it's own and remains relevant in today's increasingly diverse micro and macro-brew beer market."
""
""
""
""
"O - I respect Boston Lager for its craft and its place, but this is not my go-to brew.  Clean and crisp, easily drinkable, it is light-years ahead of the boring AALs that dominate the industry.  Nevertheless, though I think this is an expertly crafted brew, I find its elements and the overall drinking experience somewhat lackluster.  And for the style, there are examples elsewhere that I find more compelling."
"Medium bodied, medium low carbonation."
""
""
"Still one of the best American made beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"To sum it up: In my honest opinion, it is everything a beer should be. Refreshing, delicious, and timeless. The gold standard of all easy-drinking beer."
""
"Look:Reddish Brown like an Autumn leaf; Smell: biscuit-like, some roasted toffee, and light grassy aroma;  Taste: Heavy malty taste up-front with a minimal hoppy taste; Feel: very rich with medium carbonation. Overall, a solid crossover beer that meets all the specifications of a Vienna Lager."
""
"Always a solid lager. Smooth and favorful.  My ""go to"" when options are limited."
"Solid beer, not the best, not the worst."
"A unique taste combined with smooth finish."
"My go to beer. A real treat."
"nice an hearty.  The perfect beer to go with strong flavors."
"Didn't mind this brew at all"

"Boston Lager is one of my least favorite Sam Adams brews, and I'm not sure if it's because I know how much variety they have elsewhere or if I just don't like it that much, but it's one I typically pass up on a menu unless there's nothing else worth drinking."

"Out of a Bottle this is Some of the best dark Lager I've ever had. Out of a can its too carbonated. Good beer. bought a can for 1.00 recently. Some good stuff. Bought in a quest to find the best beer at my gas station. Between this lager, and sierra nevada's  pale ale. We have a lager winner and a Ale winner. Blue moon belgian white is better than the shock top equivalent. Over all good buy and an excellent buy for the money. Enjoyable and just easy drinking lager. this is something i would keep around. Beats anything else besides the sierra nevada. Over all a 5 out of 5. Excellent quality at a low price. After all, SA started the craft revolution. Considering this is my first craft style lager, its better than all the Bud miller and coors lagers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"This is my go to beer when there aren't any craft beers to try.  Its better than many craft beers and most all mass produced beers."

"The Samuel Adams taste had a variety of strong flavours from the hops and malt which were well balanced, all tingling away at my taste buds. Caramel was one taste that stood out. The finish is strong with a long lasting heavy aftertaste. Overall a nice solid beer and a great delicious taste.  Samuel Adams is a beer that you will remember."

"Readily available. Commercial craft and after all the years it's still a consistent recipe. Always stocked in my fridge. Never let down with this one."

"You know, I don't really care if people diss Sam Adams or not, I think several of there beers are pretty damn good...this one IMO is there best! Granted, they DO have some pretty horrid offerings (see latitude 48) but, several are superb. Boston Lager is a very well balanced beer with exceptional drinkability. Also, give them credit for saving from near extinction one of the greatest beer styles, the Vienna Lager. If you haven't tried a Boston Lager yet, do yourself a favor and give it a shot. Chances are, you will like it!"

"Overall: Sam Adams is... well, Sam Adams.  It's not the most flavorful beer in the world, but it generally beats out most other cheap AALs.  It used to be my go-to before I wised up, but it still gets the job done, and I wouldn't turn one down if it was offered to me."

"This is an amazing example of a lager style beer.   Clean, crisp and refreshing.  Pours a beautiful amber color with a thin maybe 1/4"" white head.  The smell is light, a subtle dry hop smell to it perhaps.  Very easy drinking tastes of a nice light hops flavor mixed with a light citrusy flavor. This is very easy drinking and has a great traditional clean lager taste.  I especially enjoy the lightly dry finish to the sip.  If your looking for something that is quality and easy drinking for a simple night , this is it!"

"Real boring plain old lager.... Not great by any stretch. Also not horrible either. Just plain Jane and mass produced, pretty much  exactly what you would expect~"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Still holds it own after all these years. So much flavor and perfectly balanced, so easy to drink. The first shot across the bow of the mega brewers and it still works 25+ years later."
""
""
""
"Pretty Good!"
""
"Deep golden c olour, with  a rich creamy head that never seems to vanish, lots of lace. Smell is floral, hoppy, (not surewhich hop is used, but smells a bil like marijuana). OK, I've seen Noble Hops in another review. Caramel and grains. Silky creamy palate, good carbonation. Taste of caramels, malty, grains. Hoppy bitter finish."
"The tart and bitter aspects are fairly intense and perhaps slightly out of balance with the remaining flavors, which are otherwise rich and expressive. Along with the smooth texture, the overall effect is that of an easily drinkable and satisfying beer."

""

"Sam Adams Boston Lager - in my eyes this is the beer that kicked off the craft and homebrew revolution in the US. A must have at all events whether it's the backyard BBQ for the 4th of July or with Thanksgiving turkey or while watching the Superbowl in the dead of winter. It must be stocked and available at all times."

"O – Really very good for a lager this one tastes and drinks very like an ale. It is smooth and goes down very easy like a lager should but it has some interesting flavour which for me sets it apart from a lot of others. This one is a good session beer while it is not massive in flavour it is more interesting than I was expecting and I would definitely order this again."

"The classic, the mainstay, the one everyone knows.  Better than all the big-market beers, and a good introduction to craft brewing.  Sam Adams is getting almost too big to be really classified as a craft brewery, but nonetheless, they do make some good stuff, and this is the one you can get everywhere."

"Not a wow beer, but it's a fine beer nonetheless! You get malts and a nice hop presence without it being too bitter. I wouldn't say it's a gateway to better beers, but some would. It's cheap enough in everyone's neck of the woods. Get some!"

"To those who don't yet know the greatness and variety of the lager family, I say start them off with a Sam Adams Boston Lager and set the record straight! It is a great ""transition"" beer, or starter beer, for those used only to the super mass produced stuff and isn't too bold or daring to intimidate most. The beer itself is a shiny amber with a fizzy head that really sticks to the sides of your glass. It's a pleasant yet mild caramel aroma and tastes similarly of sweet malts and caramel with a solid finish, good with or without food and not too strong or weak for sit down to a single bottle or a few. Versatility is yet another one of its many finer points."
""
""
"O - Nice complexity of flavors, especially for a lager.  Bitterness is balanced by some sweetness and spiciness.  Very enjoyable and drinkable.  3.75/5"

"Bottle poured into a Sam Adams pint glass. Looks like a perfect beer with an opaque hazelnut color. Smell is very faint but is overall not offensive. The taste was much stronger than I was expecting, so much so that it was off-putting.  Consisted of hops on a smoky wood background. The finish was very bitter and gives it a lower drink ability score than most beers in this category. For what this is, it's a decent beer but for the hyped up price, there are better, cheaper options that will provide the drinker with a more desirable experience."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"I had one last night for the first time in a long time. I must say I need to start buying this on a more regular basis. Nice bull bodied beer with complex flavors without being over the top. Drinks smooth and finished cleanly with no bitter aftertaste. Slightly hoppy and well balanced malty flavor. A good stepping stone for those entering the craft market."

"O: [2.25] It seems hard to believe but I was disappointed - and I had pretty low expectations.  I have had Sam Adams Boston Lager before - but never reviewed it critically.  It has no appreciable nose.  The taste is not something that I like and the body was unimpressive.  Overall this is not a beer I would ever seek out.  Even on a hot day I'd skip this in favor of water.  I guess if this was the only ""craft"" beer at a place that server BMC then I'd go for it."

"Pours a nice amber lager color. 1 finger white head. Smells like wheat and sort of citrusy. Absolutely a citrus note. Like orange on bread. Tastes quite similar, a very nice balance of wheat/bread with citrus."

"Pours a pretty amber in color with a good 1/2+ finger off-white foamy head. Some spotty lacing is seen when sipped that actually leaves some rings even. The aroma is of roasted malts for the most part. The taste is right up front with the sweetness of the roasted malt followed by a very slight hoppy finish. It isn't bad actually and doesn't linger. Even better on draught. Overall a decent beer though many of their seasonal beers are better."

"I gotta say i love the hoppy taste and all of the nice flavor of this beer. It is strong. Tastes sweet and very delicious. Fruity Hops to me anyway dominate the experience in the taste. to me its fruity Hops And i get a malt taste. Unlike coors light, which is what i drink all the time, it has a taste to it that is distinguishable. I like this more. It is Something beer geeks could appreciate. I taste the hops, unlike with budweiser or the AALs. The AALs taste like corn and barley and things like that. This tastes Different. Its been a while since i had it but it tastes like caramel malts with hops. Best i've had besides guinness blue moon and Bourbon stouts."

"I was told by many people that this is the 'Rolls Royce' of American Largers - maybe the hype was built up too much. I guess it is well put together beer, however, I don't think I will be having it again."
"my opinion of this brew has gotten better with time. I think the can option actually results in more flavor. Jim K has really sold me on this one - great, rich taste, color, head ... truly drinkable and enjoyable. so much character - and like JK says, today's BL is better than it was originally - super experience !"

"A good American beer right here. Marvelous appearance, bold golden hue- love at first pour. It smells great. Outstanding, four stars. Yeasty American lager smell. This lager beer has an impressive taste, much more going on here with a impressionable, strong mouthfeel and taste. It lingers in your mouth as a reminder that this is not your typical domestic budweiseresque lager. Of all the lighter beers or lagers I have tried, this is one American classic I can always depend on as a quality go to brew."

"Boston Lager is a very good everyday beer. It pours with little carbonation and a thin head, leaving some lacing on the glass. The flavor is of one-dimensional hops. The color is dark gold (not quite amber) and the taste is crisp and refreshing. Sam is a really good macro-micro brew ( a larger brewer who pretends to be small). Imagine 3/4 Sierra Nevada Pale ale, 1/4 spring water. You have a Sam Adams."

"O - Boston Beer Co. would never have gotten off the ground if Boston Lager was a bad beer. This Vienna lager might appeal more to the masses looking for something beyond fizzy yellow swill but by no means does that make it any less noteworthy. The skill it takes to create a nicely malty and balanced brew that's a bit lighter with no flaws is what I would call an art. This work of bottled art is delicious on it's own, balancing toasty, bready malts with just enough bitterness but also begs to be paired with pub fare as it's easy going and extremely drinkable."

"Sam Adams sucks. I hate all their stupid beers and their stupid commercials. This crap ain't even from Boston? I do like that some people consider it a craft beer and buy into their dumb reputation. I used to live in Boston and part of why I didn't want to stay was because this beer company was associated with it. I do like Harpoon though. That is a much better Boston beer brand. Sam Adams can suck it because it does suck it."

"Something almost everyone has had but still a nice beer. The pour was dark yellow, almost orange and the smell was a lot of malt and a bit of floral hops coming through. The taste was a nice amount of flavor from the hops and malt which were well balanced and a very clean finish. The mouthfeel was nice as well being a good balance. My biggest problem with the beer is that even though it does all the things a good beer should do, it doesn't stand out. It's basic, but basic is good too sometimes."

"A standard-setting lager; nothing mind-blowing, but an exemplar of how good a simple recipe can be."
""

"A beautiful clear amber with a solid head. It has a pronounced sweet caramel smell. The caramel taste comes through wonderfully in it's heavy malt profile, particularly at the back. It has a light and smooth mouth feel that just may possibly be under carbonated. This is a solid beer, my go to lager."

"If were to King a beer SA Boston Lager would be very high on my list. The taste and feel is near perfection! Compared to beer of equal stature is common.

"overall a great beer, but only a good Vienna lager. i would prefer a Elliot Ness over this and it's cheaper, with higher abv. SA makes decent beer however the ABV is always towards the low side, and for 10 bucks a sixer i would like more ABV. no complaints but i have had better Vienna lagers."

"Overall: There isn't much to say about this that hasn't been said. It's fairly ubiquitous, meaning that it saves good beer drinkers from having to tolerate crap beer in places that otherwise have only crap beer. It's a terrific session lager and has justified its following many times over."
"Samuel Adams Boston Lager brewed by Boston Beer Company. This brew pours out a dark amber color with a small white head. Looks like Iced Tea. The Smell is rich. The taste is bitter you can taste the hops. Samuel Adams Boston Lager is not like most American style lagers, this brew is much more bitter. There is not much else to say about this brew. It is not smooth ,but it has flavor. If you like bitter beer- then this one is for you. Not my type of brew at all. Over all I'm giving this brew a 3.25 out of 5 at best."
""
" Overall, I give this brew a 3.5. Again, the head and lacing are pretty nice& it smells very pleasant. Although the sudden bitterness sort of jumped out at me. With that said, I may buy this brew again for a higher scale cookout or the like."

"330ml bottle. Stange glass @ L´Espumossa (Barcelona). Amber color, crystal clear appearance. White froth, thin but lively crown. Crystal malt, lager yeast, floral aromas & resinous hues. Toasted flavor & arising bitterness at first sip. Light to medium body. Moderate but lively carbonation. Clean bitterness & dried mouthfeel rounded by spicy touch. Subtle honey & lemon-tea hints linger into a long bitter finish. Mild toasted notes on the aftertaste. Refreshing & easy drinkable !!"

"O: I like this lager very much. It brings a bit more to the table than the typical Vienna lager. I like the expressive, yet not overwhelming use of hops. It's right down the middle for style and is a benchmark session beer."

"very nice beer. this is a great American Lager made by the Brewer and Patriots over at Samuel 'Adams. I feel like Sam Adams is being slightly down graded from craft brew to mass produced near beer... and i get it. but they do tend to make some nice classics such as this beer here. enjoyable crisp Lager, very sessionable and has a decent complexity with the hop characters. all around a very well performed American Lager. perfect for watching the game, or the summer picnic."

"Long ago, I used to think it was too bitter, but when my taste buds woke up, I realized the bitterness is just right, with the overall caramel flavors mixed with the right amount of hops. Having this on tap is the best way to have this, but in a bottle works just fine!!"
"I originally rated this a 3.41 but as I drank it the caramel and citrus flavor wore on me and I do not believe it belongs in the lager so I took the score down."
""

"This beer pours a light amber color with a half nice white head. It had a sweet caramel smell with hits of citrus and hops. The flavor is sweet and slightly citrusy with the slight bitter after taste that comes with a lager. Great beer from a great brewing company."

"I first tried this beer in 1990 at a restaurant and have not tried it since. At that time, I thought that this was the best beer I had ever had. It was the perfect domestic beer for me. Everything is smooth, tastes great and had that certain ""it"" about it. Tried it again for the first time in 23 years and although not as great as when I first tried it, it was good nonetheless. Nice full flavor and great body. Very satisfying and highly recommended."

"Ooh, a beautiful finger of a cap of eggshell-white head with lots of exploding CO2 bubbles. Color was a deep copper with NE-quality clarity. Nose was grassy, Noble-hop like in its intensity. My mouth was watering in anticipation. Mouthfeel was full, almost downright creamy in its fullness. I CAN only hope that Jim Koch deigns to begin putting some of his beers in a CAN. Lots of grassy hops on the tongue, making me think of the Gasthaus Waldesruh in ""Cabaret"" - the biergarten where they spent a pleasant afternoon until the Hitler youth began his song. They were putting away a good bit of lager bier, along with brats and pretzels. Say, it's time for a mid-afternoon snack and brats and pretzels would be most excellent with this beer. Finish was clean, hoppy, a very satisfying beer. 1) Why jam it into the Winter Sampler box? and 2) Why CAN't it come in a CAN so that I CAN take it to the beach or school (in my imaginary cooler that I imagine every day in that classroom)?"

"This beer is THE best beer you can get for your money. The best bang for your buck. Poured into a regular glass mug. Clear, yet deep amber color. Foamy tall head and strong body. A burst of flavors great for having with any type of food including carmel malt hint, a large diversity of grains including wheat and barley, tastes of yeast that makes it seem like water-bread almost, and even a hint of some citrus (that might just be me). A little watery however. Somewhat hoppy at the end, but not as much as others say. Overall, this beer is the gateway craft beer."

"O- A decent beer as an alternative to some BMC that you'd find at most restaurants. Reminded my very much of Yuengling Amber but with a bit bigger flavor and body. I'm happy living in Kalamazoo because most restaurants have some Bell's (usually Two Hearted) and occasionally Founders on tap and will always be able to go with that over Boston Lager or Blue Moon."

"Smell, taste, aromas, and color are beautiful... I find myself drinking this beer more often. Samuel Adams is a true pioneer when it comes to beers. Boston lager is refreshing,smooth, and a great first beer for beginners who want that ultimate bold and satisfying clean finish!!"

"Pours a light brown color with two fingers of tight white bubbles that retain well. The nose, though hard to detect even in my relatively warm beer, has bready yeast notes, sweet, grainy malts, and floral hops . On the way down it's all sweet malts with a hint of caramel and a nutty backbone. It tastes refreshing, with a creamy mouthfeel and clean finish that leaves just a little bitterness."

"O: This is a full blown real beer with no thought to anything but a full flavored(malts and hops) lager. It's fully hopped and malted with crystal malts for a nice amber color. This is a man's beer and might not be a session type lager because it so full bodied and good. Beer the way it used to be I think."

"T/M: The toasty, grainy notes hop to the front of the palate, quickly followed by a caramel note and a hint of lemon zest. Chewy texture given the style and ABV, with plenty of scrubbing bubbles keeping things fresh. Finishes short and balanced with little lingering residue."

"A light russet brew with a classic Vienna lager look, the color is somewhere between sunset orange and reddish, with understated off-white head. Aroma brings a malty sweetness, some sweet fruity notes almost akin to grape, floral hops, a hint of spice. Palate is impressive, there is a downplayed hazelnut richness, a dry but somewhat fruity bitterness like watermelon rind, a sour note that just barely hints at citrus, and the expected toasty malts. Although each individual component is subdued, it all adds up to a malt forward, flavorful, and well-crafted offering that deserves the sometimes grudging respect of craft snobs like myself. A lot better than many import lagers and also widely available. You have to try Sam Adams if you call yourself a lager fan, and you'll be appreciative to boot."

"Has a strong tastes of grains, very smooth. Not too full in the mouth. The there is little aftertaste. It finishes smoothly. It's a well rounded quality beer. It only lacks on the potency of the hops, and the fullness in the mouth. I would highly recommend this beer. I believe it's one of the best mass produced American beers."

Sweet bread with a hint of caramal toasted notes. This is got to be damn near the best lager made in america and i don't care how much of this they make ill keep drinking it."

"O: A fairly often overlooked beer for me and most, but one that I do come back to and something that I would never feel bad having as a staple in my fridge. Solid at worst, it definitely deserves respect not just for what it has done for the beer revival in the US but for still being a great beer."
"O- Once again, this lager is one of my go-to beers. It isn't the best beer I've ever had but it is sure to satisfy. Samuel Adams Boston Lager is an outstanding lager with lots of character. I give my two thumbs up to this one."
""
""

"Overall: Quite flavorful for an amber lager, although the metallic notes certainly didn't win this one any points. The color was oddly light for the style, and was also surprising considering the toastiness of the malt smell and taste. I wouldn't refuse it, provided that the metallic character isn't present in every bottle (I highly doubt that!)."
"Overall- For a lager this is a pretty good beer. Great for just relaxing in the backyard on a hot summer day and throwing back a couple cold ones with your friends. That said, I don't really drink lagers so I don't really have anything to compare with."
"I'm partially bias towards this beer because almost everyone is. This is my go to ""beer."" Its a staple in my fridge. Its not crafty but its full-filling enough to be a quality brew. The color is great, the flavor is good for the style. This is the entry beer into craft. When I go out to eat to at a chain restaurant and this is the best beer available I'm grateful because this is a solid beer. Overall, a 3.60 and I will not decline this beer."
"O-For what it is, Sam is a pretty decent beer. I have never been able to really get into it, but there is no denying that it has some appealing qualities that other brews with the same availability do not possess. The flavors here certainly leave a mark, although hop heads need not apply."

"O: An excellent beer. I remember hating this beer before and now that I went back to it it was a much better experience. Perhaps my palate wasn't as developed before. It's a solid beer that goes well with many food dishes and just like the bottle says, it is a well balanced full flavored beer. This is always my beer of choice when it comes to having a beer that I want to drink a lot or with a friend. This is probably one of the most inoffensive beers around for those who want to try out beers outside the generic BMC."

"This is a sentimental favorite. It was my gateway to microbrew. Sam Adams is a full bodied malty mouthful. It is luscious. I taste roasted or slightly burnt caramel, some burnt sugar but it is balanced by some hop bite at the end. I know it is a lager but it tasted like no lager I had ever had at the time. That was 1989."

"At one point this was my favorite beer and was really my introduction to craft beers. I used to find it extremely bold, compared to the miller light that I would usually drink. The flavor seems very mild and unassuming compared to more assertive style of beer on the market, but it's still a prime example of a dark lager done right."
""

""
""
""
""

"I have always liked Boston Lager, however I bought some recently and it tasted a lot like a beer from one of the big three breweries. The notches were not marked like they usually are, and the beer had an overall mediocre taste, not old, just reminiscent of a cheap corn beer. It was a shame because this has always been a solid lager."
""
""
"Overall not a bad lager. Frankly I think it looks and smells better than it tastes, but it is still better than many lagers out there. The taste is not bad, but it is just kind of bland and one-dimensional. I want a lager on a hot summer day and this one does not have that crisp character that I want when opting for the style."
""
"O: Very well balanced and distinct beer. Classic Sam Adams malt profile that is evident in their other beers including their Latitude 48 IPA. Good balance of malt, hops and medium bodied carbonation to blend all the flavors together."
""
""
""
""
""
"Palate, a little heavy perhaps if your used to it...personally I think its because its a lager...If only they had made it an Ale...oh well its still one of my favorites, and my common beer of choice for your standard bar."

"Overall: Pretty good, if not slightly better than pretty good. Actually this is the first Samuel Adams Boston Lager that I’ve had in a while, several years in fact, and I have to say that it’s much better than I remember. Boston Lager used to be too hoppy for me, but the hops seems to have mellowed, either that or my taste buds/sensitivity to hops must have developed more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is pretty much the perfect lager. It may not get the credit that it deserves on this site frankly only because its ABV doesn't exceed 8%, but as far as I'm concerned it's the lager with which all other lagers should be compared. I'm not saying that means it is necessarily the most complex beer, but in my opinion it is a perfectly balanced beer. It smells fresh each time. Just because it's easily available doesn't mean it isn't excellent."

"Ive had this beer many times and have been very pleased with it every time. The taste is always the same"" great quality control"". The color is very nice for a domestic non dark lager. The taste is very refreshing with hints of citrus, hops, bread, and i always get a little grassy like after taste which is very nice. The carbonation is perfect for complimenting the after taste, as well as the full body feel it has while drinking. This is for sure my always, never let me down, go to beer."
""
""
""
"Boston Lager is a nice rounded beer that goes well with a lot of food pairings or with drinking it solo, and it can be enjoyed just as well on a hot day or a cold winter night. Boston Lager is close to my heart; it's the first beer that really made me appreciate what beer can be. Certainly there are other better beers, but as far as large scale brewing goes, this is definitely a keeper."

"O - This is the one that started it all for me. My first breakaway from AAL's. I owe quite a lot to this one, and even though I can safely say that it's no longer one of my favorites, it's still something that I can enjoy when I'm feeling nostalgic."

"BBC puts out a lot of good beers and doesn't always get the respect it deserves in the craft beer world. Oddly, however, and unfortunately, their iconic, flagship beer is one of their least impressive. The main problem is that it is just a little too bitter for the style. I like an aggressively hopped IPA or DIPA, but this beer enters a level of hoppiness that is just a few IBU's higher than it should be for what it is, and leaves me with an unwelcome and unwanted aftertaste."

"For this review I will pour a little into a taster, and sip the rest from the can. I will provide a side by side comparison of the two drinking experiences except when it comes to appearance, as the can is not see through… From the can the beer pours a crystal clear, amber-orange color with a beautiful head of creamy, medium sized bubbles. The head leaves a lacing of sticky thin lacing that leaves spider webs on the glass. From the glass, the beer graces the nose with a clean, crisp, fresh cut grassy smell with a light biscuit smell wafting beneath the grass and giving a warmth to the nose. From the can, the smell is slightly intensified to provide slight citrusy notes with the grassy hops, alongside slight hints of wet dog and metallic can though those might just be me. The glass has the better smell. From the glass, the beer tastes cleanly bitter with a warming bready sweetness that balances out the beer. Acids are very light in the mouth, only providing a slight wetting to the tongue. From the can the beer tastes slightly sweeter, mellowing the bitters into a more manageable taste. In flavor from the glass the beer begins as medicinal bitters, but quickly blooms into wet, bitter grass with a warm backed biscuit dough and a touch of caramel. The beer finishes grassy bitter with a touch of lemon citrus. The aftertaste is very light with bitter grass. From the can, the taste carries some slight citric lemon from the start, mellowing out the grassy bitters and bringing the caramel malt more onto the palate. Doing this review, I am a little surprised that I am liking the can more than the glass. On the mouth, in the glass, the beer feels on the heavy side of light with a heavier carbonation of fluffy bubbles that blanket the tongue nicely and provide a slight scrub. From the can, the carbonation scrubs the tongue slightly more, perhaps due to the smaller hole. After the beer leaves, the mouth is left slightly damp with saliva. Overall, this beer is quite similar from the can and the glass, which is surprising since I have had several of the cans now, and actually thought it tasted a little different… That being said, this is a terrific simple lager with light complexities that make it interesting, while at the same time inviting you to drink more and more. Boston Lager is nearly sessionable, and is a great lawnmower beer in my mind. A true classic."

"Hardly anyone gets into craft beer without enjoying several of these along the way. One of the first hopped-up Vienna Lagers I enjoyed. I suppose a bit more malt character would make this beer match the style description a bit better, but who cares. Lots of flavor and an excellent balance make this a true American classic."

"Pours amber/honey color with thick foamy head with excellent lacing. Floral/fruity aroma - more of an apple aroma. Malty taste up front, followed by very mild hoppy taste with an apple maltiness on the end. Aftertaste is more fruity. Good beer for the style. Very representative."

"I finally tried the much anticipated ""Can"" version of this , and I think the money put into designing this can could have been put to better use, the mouth itself has an opening about 1/4"" from the lip and the lip itself was curled out away from the can and the mouth was a little wider than normal cans, that combined with the distance from the lip you need to tilt your head back further to drink it, making it relatively easy to spill on yourself. The beer did not ""slide"" as it normally does for me. I will be sticking to bottles in the future."

"America used to make strong products which were reliable and a value. Now, we mostly produce crap. This beer is a prime example of how things used to be done, with pride. It harkens me back to when American goods were great. From the taste, to the smell or the price, this beer must make the brewers proud because for the first time in a while, I have found a consistent American product to be proud of. Way to go Samuel Adams Boston Lager and God bless America."
""
""
"Food match: Everything that you can find that is honey-glazed; ham, chicken, pork chops, carrots, potatoes, pecans and pears, ground to a fine paste on toasted bread."
""
""
""
""
"This was my gateway beer. Before trying Boston Lager, I would drink only lagers a notch above american macro adjuncts, like stella, heinekin, kirin. SA BL introduced me to the pleasure of hops. While retaining the crispy mouthfeel that makes lagers so drinkable, this beer has a much stronger and more interesting malt character as well as some bitterness from hops. The nice amberish color and thick frothy head give this beer a great appearance, especially for a lager."
""
"This is such a good lager, and one of the most recognizable. It has a nice maple and caramel taste to it, and a bit more bitterness than other lagers. If you're in the market for a good, standard lager, look here. I will get this again."

"O - My first experience with Boston Lager was years ago, before I'd become accustomed to hopped beers, and I didn't like it. Well, tastes change, and after downing my fair share of pale ales and trying a number of beers, I decided to give it another try. I was not disappointed. The hops are clearly present, but really just introduce you to the rest of the beer, instead of overpowering it. Behind that, the mild amount of malt and the rest of the flavors come through cleanly."

""
""
""
"Overall: My go-to beer in shitty bars. Really, this is an excellent beer that is done really well. I actually enjoyed this one better from the bottle. Maybe due to dirty tap lines? Or perhaps I am enjoying the greater malt presence since some of the hops may have faded away. A solid beer, nonetheless."
""

""
"Goes down relatively crunchy bubbly. I think I'd better stick to fresh Boston Lager on tap."
""
""
""
""
"A beer that has a rightful place in starting the move to craft, I can certainly see why it would make converts of macro drinkers. The malts and hops come through to give this beer some actual taste. It is a decent drinking lager style that does up the game. Won't be my favourite beer, not overly complex and despite the good balance none of the ingredients really makes a good case for making a really flavourful beer. Good session beer, tasty and not a beer you have to think about too much."

"O - A very flavorful, balanced and drinkable lager. This is definitely a nice session beer and pairs well with steak. I like the fact that it's available at almost any bar or restaurant, as it easily beats out all the other macro lager options."

"Poured from 12oz bottle. It settles down quickly with a fine fizzle on top. Great color with a mild malt+alcohol smell.

I love this stuff, not a geek beer for sure but you won't go broke with this one + available everywhere."

"Pours a nice ambery color, with a good head. Smell is just a nice lager smell, but the taste, while clean, nice, lagery, has a certain nuttiness, or breadiness that I really enjoy. Carbonation, mouthfeel, all nice. While I'm not a huge lager guy I've had enough American lagers to recognize that this one is pretty well brewed and I enjoy the unique taste it has. I think there are some reviewers here (in my humble opinion), who forget to do it based on the style of beer. If you hold this up against the greatest American ales of the day, it's not going to do well, but for what it is, this is good beer."

"There seem to be many people like myself, who after drinking cheap crappy beer in college realize that maybe there's something better out there and try a better beer. Sam Adams was that ""better beer"" I tried back in the day (and have had on many occasions since). Compared to Miller Light &co when I tried Sam Adams this beer seemed fantastic. But after trying different craft beers for a few years I now see its place in the beer hierarchy and it's a good above-average beer. This is what a good normal beer is supposed to taste like, but there's nothing particularly special about it that makes it stand out."
""
"Overall: This is a very solid, all-around beer. It won't amaze, but it is really easy to drink and retains enough character to remain interesting. Very easy to find and affordable too. An obvious choice for some of the more limited restaurant tap selections, and will pair decently with many foods. Just a very enjoyable, classic beer."

"Poured a 12 oz. bottle into a Sam Adams glass. Poured a a nice amber, with a big creamy head that lingers around and leaves nice lacing. Aroma is big, with notes of fruit (raisin maybe?), caramel, and little bit of hops. Taste is a little dialed back from the aroma, as those aroma notes are present, but more blended together as opposed to being distinct, as they are in the aroma. Still, a nice flavor to it, with a very slight hop bitterness on the finish. Fairly carbonated and a slightly thinner mouthfeel. A good craft fall-back."

"Slight hint of citrus in the taste along with the hops. Excellent balance of taste and filling. Great flavor without it feeling like i just ate a can of beans. Probably my top choice for a 12 pack."

"Great golden amber color with decent head. Sweet hoppy aroma that might benefit from added depth and complexity, but definitely pleasing. Citrus and hoppy notes, with a surprising depth that you might not expect from a lager. Slight bitterness that adds to the beer. Balanced mouthfeel. These two bottles are a bit more bitter than usual, but the expiration date is far into the future. Good true finish."

"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a medium coppery amber with a nice one finger off-white head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of biscuit malt, grassy hops and faint light fruit. Flavor follows, biscuit malt with well integrated moderate grassy hops, a hint of pear and apple juice, nuttiness. Nice medium body with light creaminess. A very balanced, pleasant to drink lager. Nothing really stands out here, but the whole lager is in perfect harmony. This makes it clear to me how Boston Beer Company got its reputation."

"Old reliable. The gateway beer of all gateway beers. A kind welcome to the world of better beer. Smooth, simple, and refined, an unpretentious lager that makes for an excellent nostalgic session beer. Caramel malts and sweetness with a modest hop presence. Crisp, refreshing, and good for almost any situation."

"The best thing about this brew: We can get it almost everywhere on tap, which means we don't have to settle for the average macro-brewed American beer."
""
"A Patriotic beer indeed! Very nice amber color with slight head (depends on how you pour, I pour at about 45* so That may be why a lot of beers do not appear to have a lot of head). Taste is slightly hoppy, but with no complaints. Goes well with BBQ."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"The pour is a light, clear amber with a white that fades fast. the lacing is mediocre while the head remains intact. The aroma is very pleasing. Lots of spicy hops and a nice strong malty backbone. The mouthfeel is also quite nice, although there is too much carbonation. The mouthfeel is pretty light as well. Now the bad. Up front, it tastes of stale beer. Off malt flavors intertwine with hop witternes to create, well, I don't know. That dank malty flavor never goes away.... There is about a 4 second window of delectable hops, but then it fades back to the aforementioned stale malt. It was good until I tasted it."
"I had this one in the bottle a few times and never thought much of it aside from the fact that it was an easy-drinker and quite palatable, but once I had it on tap, I was hooked. This one opened my eyes to the fact that a ""lager from America"" can be a very, very good thing. It pours a nice light orange/red with a golden hue (that's how I'd describe a Vienna lager too). It smells of fresh, earthy floral hops and a touch of sweetness. Nice head, great lacing. It teams well with the Sam Adams pint glass it was poured in and it went exceptionally well with my caesar salad and sammy. I had a couple pints of this solid brew that day and have since proclaimed this to be the best American lager on the market today! It doesn't try too hard to be different, it just happens that it is brewed with all malt and no adjuncts. Gee, Big Boys, maybe you should take a hint that even the least educated of palates can tell the difference between your toxic slop and good, all natural and real beer. Cheers!"

"12 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, best before Jan 2013. Pours slightly hazy golden copper color with a nice 1-2 finger fluffy off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of caramel, pear, apple, toast, bread, floral, light citrus, and light herbal hops. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity. Taste of caramel, toast, apple, pear, light nuttiness, biscuit, cracker, floral, light pepper, and earthy hops. Light herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, light fruits, cracker, biscuit, light nuttiness, floral, and light pepper on the finish for a good bit. Very nice flavor robustness and balance of malt/hops; with zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy and fairly crisp mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is completely hidden, with zero warming noticed as expected for 4.9%. Overall this is a damn nice vienna lager. Very nice flavor balance and robustness; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering; and a nice option that is available anywhere."

"Overall - I've enjoyed Sam Adams Boston Lager for several years. Actually sitting down and analyzing it I come to the same conclusion as I also have had. This is a good beer, but it will not blow you away with a groundbreaking, complex taste. And I feel that is how this beer should be."

""
"One of the most dependably decent beers you can get at a restaurant, and a beer I will always be grateful for having existed. Easy to drink a bunch, but also nice as a single.

"My first experience with Sam Adam's flagship beer was back in Berlin, Germany in 1987 (or maybe 1988) at Grunewoche. I thought it was pretty neat to have an American beer accepted for this big fest overseas and really enjoyed it (as I recall). As the years have progressed, I've slipped away from drinking Boston Lager except when it's one of the few bottled or draft beers available at any eating establishments my wife and I visit (there are just too many other new beers to explore these days -- a good ""problem"" if ever there was one). But back to this review -- this is still an excellent lager overall. It's nicely balanced and is a mellow, yet very tasty beer. You can't go wrong with a Sam Adam's Boston Lager..."
""
""
""
"Overall: This is actually a nice lager. Probably the best mass produced lager in the US."
""
""
"Balance about sums it up with this one. Between the aroma to taste to body, everything shines through and nothing is overdone."

"The Boston Beer Company is my favorite brewery, Samuel Adams Boston Lager is my favorite beer , brewed carefully with fine ingredients puts this companys products over the line. Taste is malty sweetness, bitter coffee . aroma is coffee sweet and bitter overall a 5 out of 5 for me a fabulous beer"
""
""
"Poured from a 12oz bottle with a surprisingly light orangey-red color and a finger width head that slowly dissipates, when on draft this head lingers longer. The smell is spicy with a little hint of sweet. Boston Lager maintains a malty taste that is quite even in its flavor despite the variety of spices and caramel that excite the drinker. True to its label, this beer really is “rich, balanced, and complex.” As a student in Boston, this has served as a reliable fallback option at bars and restaurants when other Sam Adam’s varieties are unavailable. As Mr. Adam’s most popular brew, this lager can be found in almost every seasonal variety pack available from the Boston Brewing Company and its popularity is certainly well deserved."

"O: This is a great brew and thankfully it's usually readily available at establishments with limited options. Sam Adams has saved me many times from having to drink a BMC product."

"O- Amongs the main stream, Sam Adams has always risen above the tasteless and uninspired. Back in my days of budweiser, coors, keystone, and malt liquor 40's, i heard Sam Adams had over 20the different beers, and i grew curious. I grabbed a 6 pack of this beer and it changed everything i knew about beer. I began seeking out other sam adams, opening me up to a world of different styles and flavors, that i never knew existed. This brew is an awesome session, and i owe it alot."

"Overall, hit and miss. Sometimes it seems watered down. But either way it's a balanced, tasty brew that's nearly slammable with it's 4.9% ABV."
""
""
""
"Overall - This truly is a special beer. Like I said, this got me going into craft beer. I will still drink SABL anytime, anywhere it is offered. If I can't make up my mind as to what exotic ber I want, I'll say forget it and grab this. Generally, this is a sidenote purchase at the beer gettin' place, kind of a counter balance so if all the exotic beers I get suck, at least I got a sixer of SA out of the deal. Exactly what a beer should be"
"Overall: I drink Boston Lager every so often, particularly if it's on tap. I used to think ""lager"" meant fizzy, yellow, boring beer, and Sam Adam's has shown me different. If you live under a rock, and have never had it, what are you waiting for? It's available in most areas of the United States, and at a fair enough price."

"-Overall 3.5: Better than average beer that certainly has withstood the test of time. I also know two important things about Sammy A.: 1.) it is a great session beer and 2.) it does not go well with some foods (like pizza). Still, you could do a heck of a lot worse than this brew if given a selection of US domestics."

"One of the most beautiful beers I've seen, it pours heavy burnt orange with hints of brown and gold. Floating off the considerably thick head, strong pine notes from the Noble hops are followed by a subtle citrus background. On the tongue, milder that the strong hop scent would lead you to suspect, a slight honey sweetness taking the edge off the confident hop bite, and a quick clean finish that leaves you either refreshed or disappointed, depending on your mood. This is a sold beer, not too complex but hitting all the basics, giving a great baseline with which to judge more unique beers if you so choose to experiment, or just a palate cleanser to go with a burger or fish and chips. Cheers!"

Out of the can or poured into a glass, the beer tasted flat and bitter with an almost sour aftertaste, like vinegar. think i have decided that I am finished with spending money on boston lager from a store. It's just a different beer from what is put in kegs. Even Guinness with their nitrogen tap manages to bottle something that tastes the same as on tap. Get it together sam"

"As with many people this is the beer that introduced me to the craft industry, and still to this day remains a beer that i can always count on for a quality, well balance beer... shocked that i am just now appreciating it enough to review!

"O- For some odd reason this was my first tast of the Boston Lager. I picked up the Harvest Collection but left the lagers alone because I thought they couldn't stand up to the other seasonal beers. I sure was wrong. This one is solid, and I understand why this is one of the staples in the craft world. It seems like it would make a great transitional beer from BMC to craft."
""
""
"What can be said about Boston Lager that hasn't been said before. It is just one of the classics. It pours up a deep gold/light copper with a fluffy one finger head, some retention, and elaborate lacing. Smell is biscuit and honey. Mouthfeel is okay with decent carbonation. Taste is sweet upfront with a very mild metallic note, but the bitterness on the finish balances it perfectly. Simply a good beer, found everywhere and a sure thing if all that is available is macros or Sam Adams!!"

"355ml bottle, poured into Leffe chalice. Bronze colour, clear, one finger head, poor head retention but kept some lacing. Very hoppy aroma, detected some kentish style hops plus the noble hops Hallertau and Tettnang. Tasted fruity, hints of apple, had some sweetness which was balanced out by the long bitter finish. Crisp mouthfull, smooth texture and was well carbonated. Can't add too much more to what has already been said but it was refreshing, interesting and balanced."

"Considering a company as large as Samuel Adams, it's still obvious that they put a lot of care into their brews. As far as the ""larger"" brew companies go, this is some of the best. Easy to drink and session with and it blows BMC beers out of the water, especially for the relatively low price."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Rightly or wrongly, this is the standard Vienna lager today. It's a fairly easy-drinking, accessible lager with a good amount of flavor and a nice hop profile. Nothing world-changing, but something I never mind having every time I open a Sam Adams mixed pack."
""
""
""
"O - It seems like a bit of a cliche choice to name this one as one of your favorites, but maybe there's a reason for that. A well-balanced beer that's refreshing and just as good whether you're sipping or taking a big gulp."

"Poured a nice clear amber with a thin white head and abundant carbonation bubbles. A good look for a Vienna lager. Scents of grainy malt, sweet, honey malt and some undertones of earthy and herbal European hops. A quite nice aroma profile. Malty with a nice hit of hops, very good. Taste begins with sweet, caramel and honey-like malt flavors, backed by earthy and herbal hop flavors. The hop flavors remain throughout the sip and into the finish and aftertaste. Midway through the sip the hops get a bit more intense but not overly so, still balanced by sweet malt. The finish continues with the sweet malt and hops, but with a little bit more grainy malt. The aftertaste is honey, grainy malt and herbal and earthy hops. A nice flavor profile, very balanced between malt and hops, pleasant to drink. Mouthfeel is light bodied, moderately carbonated, on point for the style, with a crisp feeling. Very good, what a lager should be. Overall this is a good session lager. Its balanced and flavorful, but light enough to not be overwhelming. Its also available everywhere, which is nice. Its a winner."

"Style tick! How have I not done this one yet!? Served from tap into a shaker. Poured a golden yellow-orange with a one finger off-white head that remained throughout the glass. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, citrus, earth, earth hop, and wheat. The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus, earth, earth hop, and wheat. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty decent brew. I have to give this beer credit as it has definitely done its part with converting people over to craft beer. There is not a huge amount going on here, but it is rather easy to drink and is fairly well balanced at the same time. This fact makes it rather easy to drink and enjoyable for those without a palate for big and bold craft beers. However, if you do have a palate like that this one might not be your favorite. But always remember to give credit where it is due and this one deserves some of that."

"This beer is a slight amber color with a one finger white head. The aroma matched the taste. This is definitely a lager and has a nice crispness to it. There is a surprisingly present hop profile in here that I wasn't expecting. This beer is however mostly malty and has a light flavored malt profile ranging from crystal malts to toffee. A heavier feel then expecting. Overall, a solid lager that wacks all the domestics out of the park."
""
""
""
"Final Grade: 3.89, a worthy B+. Samuel Adams Boston Lager is a tasty, balanced session brew packed with far more flavour than your typical 5%-ish mass-produced lager. Very good for what it's meant to be, and something most beer drinkers - from the most hardcore macro swiller to the most uptight of BAs - can probably appreciate to some extent. A solid flagship beer that I will most likely pick up again at some point."
"Final Thoughts: While Boston Lager probably the only Samuel Adams beer that I would buy a six pack of, I don't feel any urgency to go and do so. However, where ""craft beer for the masses"" is concerned, it does the job nicely."
""
""
""
""
"O: My be considered a gateway beer from adjunct to craft but its a signature beer to the Sam Adams name and is a hell of a lot better than a lot of brewers signature beers. Hence Shock Top, Blue Moon, Wachusett, and Nantasket Cisco,and maybe Harpoon, its closest rival!"

"This beer is so consistently tasty that I felt it was maybe greater than the sum of its parts and deserved a 4.5 ... still, a clear go-to at bars and c-stores that don't really do craft."

"The body is medium and carbonation is good; drinks smoothly and very easily. This is an American classic, an early, seminal craft lager that shouldn't be overlooked. It will be disdained, or at least ignored, by nouveau drinkers of big, bigger, biggest beers, but its solid and dependable and a nice session choice to boot."

"This is my go-to beer at a bar. Problem I have with the beer is it's too ""mainstream"" for the hip crowd, but too fancy for the mainstream joints, so I tend to either overpay or never see this beer at my local watering holes."

"Samuel Adams Boston Lager was the first craft beer that I ever tasted. I imagine this is true for a number of BAs. At the time, I was blown away. Now, I still like it, but I realize that it's not the best, even for its style. Prior to the bottle that I am currently drinking, I haven't had this in a while. And it's because I think this beer seriously upsets my stomach. I don't know why. But I guess I will find out if this is still true tomorrow morning..."
"After paying $10 for a six pack of the disappointing Summer Ale by the Boston Beer Company, I was reluctant to give this stuff a try. But holy SHIT am I glad that I did. Pours a clear copper with a beautiful 3 and half finger white head. Some bubbles within the head from the carbonation just adds to the beauty. It doesn't sound THAT spectacular but you must see it for yourself. The smell reminded me a lot of the Latitude 48 IPA, grapefruit, Lemon, Hops, and a whole variety of other scents coming through, Although it was a bit toned down in this brew. Still smelled great. The taste followed the smell, It pretty much reminded me of an easier, slightly lighter version of the Latitude 48. Lots of hops, Lots of grapefruit, And a delicious but very slight sherbert creaminess flavor in the finish. The mouthfeel is just as good. The flavors pretty much stay the same, But my oh my is it creamy and delicious. Definitely one of the best beers that I have ever had, If not THE best. Pick up a 6 pack of this NOW"

"O-great well rounded beer. Have had it on numerous occasions and just got around to reviewing it. Go to beer at places that doesn't have a large craft beer selection"
""
"Its hard to believe I haven't sat down to review this one yet, the shining light when stranded somewhere in a sea of macros. Pours a solidly clear deep golden color with a fuzzy white head that slowly fades but also leaves some stickage on the glass. Smells of bready and sweet pilsner malts with plenty of earthy and floral hop kick to go around. The flavor is rich and malty with lots of sweet and bready honey like and pilsner malt to go around. Earthy floral and herbal hop flavor cuts through the malt to provide some great balance. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a slick sweet resinous mouthfeel. This is a great beer and over the years as my palette has changed its great to see what more I can pick out of this beer. I still think its too hoppy for a Vienna lager, but the hop head in me likes that more now."

"after about a million of these, ill finally review it this time. everyone knows what it looks like, with its specially made glassware. it smells like english malts, bready and a little sweet, crisp but not light. flavor is pretty standard, but its well made, it really is. more flavor than a lot of mass produced stuff, but nearly equally easy drinking. a real legitimate malt complexion with a quicker finish. perhaps a little more body than i want in a lager, and gets a little filling after a few. at the end of the day its at every bar and it beats budlight by a lightyear. because of that its good, im never going to buy it at a store, but at a shitty pub ill take a pint any day. can be a refresher when its ice cold."

""

"The taste is a balance of mildly sweet and bready malts and hop flavors. Hop bitterness balances the back end well without a strong lingering aftertaste. There is mild citrus from the hops present in the flavor. The flavors are well balanced. The body is light to medium with adequate carbonation. The finish is dry. It is refreshing The drinkability is very high. Overall, this is an excellent beer that pairs well with meals or as a regular session beer."

""

"O - Sam Adams’ flagship beer is a solid one. There’s nothing outstanding going on here, but it is a very well-balanced beer with a diverse profile of malt and hop aromas and flavors. Great example of a Vienna lager. There’s a reason why this is known as a “gateway” beer into the craft world - it’s available almost everywhere, cheap, sessionable, not offensive in any way, and damn tasty."

"For as mass produced as it is, the flavor is really excellent, and it is a very solid beer overall. The color is nice, the feel in the mouth doesn't offend, and the hops carry the beer to a finish that very few beers, if any, can match on this scale of production."

"O: This beer is very easy to drink and definitely quite sessionable. To me this was a gateway beer to the craft beer scene, way back in the early 1990s when I first started to drink it. The beer has a nice flavor but it is not one of my overall favorites."

"Lovely light golden amber with a good sized head and wonderful retention. Nice lacing. Smell carries a nice malt sweetness and good yeasty bread with a lovely spiciness and light leafy hop character. Taste is well balanced with a solid, bready malt core of caramel with a hint of molasses and caramel sweetness. Superbly balanced hop bitterness is an artful combination of florals and spicy but gentle Sazz like notes. Feel is crisp with mildly a carbonated, almost creamy touch. Light enough for sessioning but enough weight to satisfy with one. A great beer in total and one I enjoy again and again. If my drinking consisted of this and a few choice now and thens I would find enough quality, variety, and flavor to be happy."

"O: A tasty beer and always a solid choice when looking for a step up from a macro lager. The epitome of a gateway to craft beer. On tap, this is an exceptional beer imo, bottled version however isn't as good as the tap version"
""
""
""
"This is by far the best American style lager I have had. Maybe they should change the name to Samuel Adams ""Perfect Balance"". Balance between malt and hops are amazing and hit at the just the right time, neither being overpowering. Carbonation is spot on as well. This is definitely my year-round go to beer. I like a few other SA beers but it's often hard to beat the original, a true American staple I'm proud to drink!"

"Poured into a perfect pint. Pours a golden-red with a finger and a half of white head. Smells of toasted malt and spiced hops. Nothing too extreme, but quite pleasant nonetheless. Taste is a smooth balance of light roasted malt, hop spice and lingering bitterness. The mouthfeel is surprisingly full-bodied for a lager of this style. Overall a very sessionable beer and a reliable standby and a great option to introduce a novice to craft beer."
"Overall a reliably good beer that walks the line of craft brew and mass appeal. I'd drink it any day."

"Overall: A decent beer, but nothing special"

"When in the course of human events it becomes necessary to drink a more perfect beer, one should really start with a Samuel Adams Boston Lager. Back in the dark ages when all you could get at the packie were Buds and Coors and Millers, in rode Sammy A. proclaiming that better beers were coming for the betterment of all humanity. Approachable flavor, classy packaging (I especially like the design of the 22oz. bombers) and an extremely affordable price ($3.25/22oz.!) have likely been responsible for the enlightenment of many a swill chugger. The real treat of Sam Adams, however, is that it takes the lager, the most American of beer styles, and elevates it to a level on par with more evolved styles. Even after all these years it remains a true pioneer and sets a standard that few lagers can match."

"The beer is slightly sweet and has a great malty flavor with a slight toffee finish. A great session beer and it's availability makes it a great alternative to the BMC versions found everywhere.

"Excellent appearence and smell. Taste a little on the bitter side for me. Good to enjoy one before lunch. Clear golden color. Head not formed well on the glass I used for the taste test. I am not really a fan of bitter beers, maybe I have to get accustomed to it before I can rate another bitter beer"
"Taste is hops up front bitter herb and some slight bitter citrus punch. Roasted chewy malt comes next with some caramel notes a nice full body. Finishes dry with a bitter herb bite. An excellent beer. I hadn't had this since I got into craft. Returning to it now, I am surprised how good it still is."
""
""
""
""
"O) Lagers kind of get overlooked a bit in my opinion. I myself am slightly guilty of this, so it's always a good idea to enjoy a classic craft brew, such as Boston Lager. This is just a really solid beer, super easy to drink, perfect session option."

"Overall / Drinkability: I wonder....did the bar get this beer diluted? It doesn't seem up to snuff somehow. I seem to remember this beer as maltier when I've had it in the past, but maybe my palate has changed so much I'm tasting this quite differently than I remember. Not sure. I'll have to try it one more time at a place where I know I can rely up on the quality and see if the beer is different yet again. If it's better - this one is getting deleted as again, something isn't quite right or my palate has really changed a lot since the last time I had this beer."

"This is worth it. This is, in my opinion, one of the best session beers that won't break the bank. It smells great and malty, tasting like it smells. I would drink this any day. The color (golden) and body (medium) and head (lingering) are more typical of ales which make this lager a great and interesting beer. Go pick up a 6 pack"
"O: Boston Lager is a classic for sure. The style is pretty plain, but it's a very nice beer. I'm glad Sam Adams puts it in all their mixed packs because while I enjoy this beer, it isn't something I would buy in a six pack."
"O- Living in Boston, I've had the Boston Lager quite a few times. It is a decent go to beer that is always in the Sam Adams mixed 12 pack. Nothing amazing, but always a decent session beer."
""
""
""
"D: overall an extremely well made beer. I think my only problem with it is a problem of mine and comes with the territory. Its simplistic. But its so good and like I said its not the beers fault the trend leans to the over indulged complexity hogs."

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a darker straw color with a small white head that dissipates slowly and leaves great lacing. Smells of malt dominantly and some sweet tones, possibly from hops, but cannot put my finger on it. Tastes of sweet malt with a a little bite of hops, but definitely on the malt heavy side, which is fine for a basic lager, but this one is superiority more flavorful than most American lagers. Carbonation a tad heavy, but not offensively so. Goes down smooth with no bad aftertastes and definitely sessionable. Overall, a very good beer and one of my mainstays when I go to bars with not much selection of on tab beers, as many will have this one."

"D - It's always been a decent beer for me; one that's drinkable, fair quality, and fairly priced."

""
""
"O: I was expecting it to taste like Bud or Millers so I was quite taken aback by its hoppiness, exactly the sort of profile I like in a cask ale. Not quite a world class beer, but as far as mass produced lagers go it's the dogs bollocks, very flavoursome. As a default beer this would definitely appeal to British ale drinkers. Would easily rival Guinness. I'll definitely drink more but on the whole, the flavour, although delicious, just doesn't go far enough for me though."
""
""
""
""
"O- First tried this a few years ago, and did not like it...this was back when I knew no beer other than BMC products. I normally get two of these 22oz bottles a couple times a week now. $1.99/bottle, makes a good after dinner treat."

"Look: very clear orange amber color with good looking lumpy frothy head. Smell: pretty faint spicy hop. Taste: good lager graininess with a good bite of hop spiciness. Lots of grain coming up on the palate. Light bitter aftertaste, faint apple fruitiness. good punchy crispy feel"
""
""
""
""
"Pours out a standard amber color with good clarity and an impressive craggy two fingered white fluffy head which lasts for a minute but leaves behind nice loops of lacing. Has a total aroma spectrum of noble hopping: earthy, spicing, and herbal all represented in approximately equal amounts in both the nose and in the flavor alongside a lovely caramel malt, all with a smooth medium bodied texture that has the right amount of carbonation too keep things lively in the mouth without being overly distracting. One of the staple workhorse lagers on the market, and it is not difficult to see why."

"O - This is a very solid lager that I have enjoyed numerous times. It's very well balanced with the biscuity/bready and noble hop flavors. It's also super drinkable and has a taste that is truly unmatched. I can see why Sam Adams includes this flagship beer in many of their variety packs as it's a great beer to enjoy with good company."

"Overall: Decent beer for when you want a beer and aren't too fussed with what sort and aren't looking to think about it or remember it. If average is defined by the range of craft beers (it is for me) this is average. If average is macro territory, this is a bit above average. It's not a beer I look for or crave, but rather is one I'll accept and be thankful for when the other options are macros."

"Overall - A solid beer from Sam Adams that appeals to a wide array of beer drinkers. It's their most popular beer but not their best, IMO. Over the years, I've found I can get through 3 or 4 of these puppies before looking to bring a reliever into the game. Drinks closer to a red ale than your standard lager."

"You know, I hadn't really had this beer for years, and to be honest it's probably better then I remember. Sam Adams is interesting to me... some of their beers I find barely drinkable, and others like their flagship beer I think are just solid and decent all around. That being said, I think this beer in terms of appearance, smell, taste, and mouthfeel is a beer that was responsible for bringing people over to the craft beer side, and I can see why. It's got some hops, but it's not overly aggressive. It has some slight sweetness in the taste. It's well balanced. It is certainly more full then the common American Adjust Lager. Definitely enjoyable and easy to drink."

"Overall to me, it's average, it appears it wants to be something better than Budwieser - which I guess it is.. but the characteristics of it do not really distinguish it as something I'd brag about. That's me... and my $0.02"

"I wonder how many people widened their beer horizons with a sip of Sam Adams? Who could resist-- it's not very bitter, but it does provide a painless education in hoppiness. A distinctive and reliable beer. I've found it in the driest beer deserts as well as the cheesiest Mexican joints. I think Boston Brewing does us all a service by making so this flavorful beer so popular and widely available."

"Overall: A very enjoyable lager. Nice flavors, well balanced and drinkable. A very good gateway beer."

"Overall: A very sessionable lager, just not much there. Still, a step up from the regular BMC selections. A great stepping stone to more flavorful Sam Adams offerings."
""
""
""
"O: This one is an American classic. Well-rounded, balanced, and sessionable. For most BMC drinkers that turn into craft beer drinkers, this is one of the gateways. Cheers!"

"O: This is a really nice Vienna lager that is not nearly as heavy as some interpretations of the style. Though this may not be the most exciting craft brew out there, it has stood the test of time and is deserving of its reputation as an American classic. If you haven't tried this beer, ignore the detractors and give it a fair shot."

"O: Can't knock this. Great for the price, and an above average ""gateway beer."" Honestly am glad beers like this are starting to dominate the larger beer markets."
"O - A solid B-level craft beer that's available at nearly any bar or corner store. I cant count the number of times I have been at a restaurant and been saved from drinking BMC products by this beer. If I'm in a hurry to get to a party or function where there is a need to bring beer and I only have time for a stop at a convenience store, this is still a solid choice.  Drank a million of them over the years and probably have many more ahead of me."

"O - Samuel Adams Boston Lager is a classic. I have a long history with this beer (it was my first legal beer and first craft beer) and it's always worth a revisit. It's not the most exciting or complex beer, but an old friend and a great standby whenever you're at a bar with limited craft options."
"You dont need a review for this...its sam adams lager!"
""
""
""
"not bad. quite sessionable in fact. though it has in no way converted me from my preference for ales."

"Not sure why, but I've found the bottle beer to be often better than the tap beer. This is the only beer I've found this to be the case (prefer bottle over tap). Often find some off flavors with the Sams Lager on tap."

""
""
""
""

""
""
"O: One of the best go to beers around. Sure, I'd pick a lot of other beers before this one, but consider this...I can walk a couple hundred feet to the local dive bar and pick up one of these for about a buck fifty. I can find it just about any place that serves liquor, and many times, this is the only other option apart from BMC, Corona, and *MAYBE* Heineken. While it's just 'good' overall, its versatile nature and superb sessionability make it ideal for luring BMC drinkers into the world of craft."

"This is a session beer, that will wind up in my fridge again."

"If this were the sort of beer I liked, I could see how this might become a go-to. Widely available, brewed by a macro brewer who still has significant roots in the craft scene. Hard to be outstanding in the style, but this is not bad, not bad at all."
""
""
""
"Overall - Very nice and easy drinker. Hoppy and malty, moreso then most lagers ive had. A great starter or evening sipper, or a great option if your at a bar and all they have is nasty macro beers on tap."

"Great copper orange color that develops a good head of thick bubbles when poured in the center of a pint glass. Yeasty maltiness and some good hop scents jump from the glass. Good refreshing carbonation. This one is a great standby and will always satisfy. This is about the only lager that I enjoy. Good example of the Samuel Adams lineup."

"Flavors are similar, some bready malt sweetness, fruity yeast. Feels a bit more full bodied than many lagers. Lingering toastiness with a slight floral hop note. Little to no hop bitterness present. Easy to have a couple with food. A pretty versatile, above average lager."
""
"Pours an amber color with a one finger head that sticks around with decent lacing. Aroma of caramel malts with a decent hop aroma. Taste follows the nose great balance between sweetness and bitterness. Crisp and clean, this is a refreshing, highly drinkable brew. It's nothing mind blowing but it's a good all around beer"

Widely available and infinitely drinkable, you can't go wrong with this beer wherever you are. Delicacy and attention to detail are king for this style this beer; Boston Beer Company has done a great job!"

"Overall: Man I love this stuff; whether it's winter, spring, summer, or fall, this beer is appropriate for all times. Easy to drink and easy to enjoy, great taste and an awesome beer."
""
"Overall - A very good, flavorful and refreshing beer. Very well balanced and extremely sessionable."
"Overall, this beer's all right with me. It's pretty session worthy and a good price."
"O: delicious, available, can't believe I haven't tried this in years. Wonderful and cheap beer."
"Overall: An American classic, and it earned it. Boston Lager, along with SNPA and a couple of other brews is, and always will be one of the quintessential ""entry-level"" and ""old favorite"" craft beers of me and many other drinkers. It remains balanced, tasty, easy-drinking, but subtly complex."
"I've had this many times but I've only reviewed it on tap. Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass best before Dec date. This pours a nice amber color with nice foamy white held with good retention. The smells are of crisp floral hops and malts. The feel is medium. The taste is pretty good, crisp floral hops and a nice malts backbone. This was always one of my early go to beers, and its still good these days even if I don't get it as often."
"I will gladly take a Boston Lager when I'm out at a bar or restaurant. It wouldn't necessarily be my first choice given other craft options; however I love that this beer is so widely available for a solid fallback. A very nice, smooth and easy drinking craft lager."
"I recommend this as a gateway beer for people drinking adjunct lagers that want to move on to something much, much better."
"Took me a while to actually write down my thoughts on this standard of American mainstream craft beer. Pours a deep golden 3/4 inch head into my chalice. Smell is inviting but not too overpowering. Malty but not too angry. The lacing urges me to take the beer and have my way with it. And I do. Nice firm malty backbone, slightly sassy, with a nice smack of hoppy bitterness. Not trying to prove anything with its medium body this lager has got what it takes to keep my attention. Definitely sessionable and overall my go to beer when the establishment I frequent cannot provide an exotic beer."
"Overall - Definitely one of the better options for draft beer at most restaurants in my area. I can see how this would work well as a gateway beer to get people away from drinking basic boring macros."
"O: One of the best lagers on the market. I am not a huge lager fan, but it tastes good and it easy to drink."
"Poured into 13 oz tulip. Pours a nice bright amber, with a nice one inch head, some lacing. Smell is bready, some citrus, and pine. Taste is that with a hint of carmel, very easy to drink. This is the beer that 17 years ago changed me. All I wanted to do is find that same reaction to another beer, that I had to my first Sammy. Then I found BA a year and half ago and have been amazed so many times since. Still a nice beer."
"Overall: I'm not a lager guy but this beer is outstanding compared to other lagers. A session beer goes great with bbq's something nice to share with friends one of the beers that people often transition to from drinking the macro beers, their available almost everywhere a nice beer and something you should try if you haven't."
"O: One of the best lagars I have had. I would try again, and would love to trey on draught."
"Overall- Honestly, I might agree with Jim Koch that this is the diaper dandy of the Samuel Adams line. It is a wonderful lager with great malt and hop balance. Why don't I get this more often?"
"Pours a clear medium amber. Big white head fades quickly. Nice floral German hop aroma, no citrus or pine. Light on carbonation, making the mouthfeel a bit bland. Very gentle on the palate. Easy to enjoy more than one in a sitting. Overall an above average selection. Iconic beer with wide appeal."
"Very easy drinking beer, it has some pleasant, subtle complexities."
"The near perfect balance goes down easy and the ber is very widely available. Always a good go to beer."
"Overall this is one of my go to beers and is especially great during warm weather. A perfect example of what a mass produced American lager should taste like."
"Overall: Nothing special here. The aftertaste lingers way too long. Not an enjoyable experience. Not as good as some of their other brews."
"Overall - I haven't had one of these in years, in college i was quite fond of it, but now that my palate has changed this really isn't anything special. One of the better mass produced beers though obviously. I do give sam adams a lot of respect, especially for their variety packs that usually have 6 beers in them to allow novice drinkers a warm welcoming to try something new."
"O: Their flagship beer, obviously, it's really quite good. Very drinkable, and a crowd pleaser to be sure. A nice compromise between flavor and taste."
"Overall, this is a solid lager and likely to be a staple to those who enjoy classic and subtle lagers in the German tradition. Highly drinkable and able to be enjoyed multiple times."
"Pretty mediocre beer. Nothing stands out, forgettable and boring. Not sessionable as I'd loathe this taste in my mouth for longer than necessary. B+ average? LOL."
"Overall: A satisfying product. Extremely sessionable lager that is ubiquitous in the US. Affordable and fresh. You can find it almost anywhere. Share with friends."
"Even though I only bought and had the one bottle during my session, this was weak enough in the alcohol department that I could have easily had two or three. I know that Lagers get a bad rap on here since they don't measure up to their stylistic opposites but this beer is as dark, complex, and enjoyable as most Ales on the market. It's not the best beer available on tap as might have been the case when this was new in the 80's but all beer lovers owe a debt of gratitude for the trailblazing role that this brew once had. It's just as good now and still deserves to be considered a classic!"
"Overall: A good lager. Well balanced. Not very complex."
"Overall I had a much better drinking experience with Boston Lager this time than the first time I had it. The first time it was just not balanced to me and the hops were unpleasant, what a difference some time makes in taste."
"O - A good New England standby, a well-rounded anytime beer. Nice if you want something a little heavier, without being thick. I do love how this looks in the glass."
"O: I got into craft beer because of the ales. I listened to all of those who insisted that lagers not be over-looked, for their quality is a more subtle one. And I agree - this a quality beer, and I will be looking to try more."
"o - personally i prefer the boston ale over the boston lager, but this is still a decent beer. sessionable and reasonably priced. not sure i'd seek it out, but i wouldn't turn one down either."
"O - An old standby that is still pretty solid."
"O: Okay, I used to drink lots of Sam Adams years ago before so many other great breweries and beers were out there to choose from. Now with so much other great beer around and wonderful selections readily available, I don't drink near as much SA, but they still make good beer and it can be purchased in so many places. A good beer that holds a special place in my heart since it is one that got me into a more ""craft"" style of beer."
"D: It's Boston Lager ... it goes down super easy.  I haven't had this in a while (probably 2 years), but it was nice to return to it again.  It's tasty, pretty well balance, not overly complex, but just a great beer to have in the evening chilling out, cooking, or watching TV.  "
"O: One of the better lager's I've had. Probably a good bunch of friends over beer."
"O: This is the first American beer I had after living in Germany during my high school years and it turned me on to American craft. It will continue to have a place in my fridge."
"Overall a nice lager with a smooth flavor. Although a staple in the craft beer world, I had it years ago and it was much better then."
"Overall - As I've said before, this beer is refreshing, light, and sold pretty much everywhere, so you're guaranteed to be able to lay hands on it. When Jim Koch started making this beer, the craft brew revolution was still in its infancy. Mr. Koch bucked the trends and got this beer to the thirsty masses, and the rest was history. It's not shooting off fireworks these days, but it's stuck around, and for good reason. (3.0)"
"O - Good session beer, a little more carbonated that I would have liked, but overall quite enjoyable."
"O- Not something I'd normally order, but at a lot of restaurants this is the best they have. It goes well enough with most food and makes for a pretty good palate cleanser between bites. This got me into craft beer, and I still enjoy it in from a bottle from time to time, but I honestly think for some reason it seems to lose a little flavor on tap."
"Went reasonably well with Mongolian beef from the local Chinese though and felt absolutely no guilt whatsoever for sacrificing its edge to a sustained chilli attack."
"Overall the beer was rather refreshing but not very imaginative."
"One of the most prevalent beers, and one of the most reliable; an American classic"
"Did someone say session brew. Here it is. Easy to drink, but not lacking in taste."
"This is one of those beers that I should turn to more often. It's simple, yet delicious, and widely available at a reasonable price. This is one of the better lagers I've had."
"Feel: Feels good, you can take big chugs and it isn't flat..."
"Draft is the same. I'm surprised to see that it's considered a vienna lager, like a mexican beer. I guess I'd have called it an amber lager. Anyway, you can never go wrong but I usually like to venture further."
"Overall, this is just a solid lager, not many out there and this is a go to brew when stuck with macros and nothing much else."
"Thanks"
"Poured from a bottle into a 12 ounce mason jar. A vigorous pour resulted in a nice amount of foam that dies down and produces a thin layer of bubbles and residue. The beer is a warm golden-amber color, like autumn leaves. Consistent and clear. There’s a sweet maltiness to the nose, not so much hops as malt. This bears out on the palate as well. The carbonation is there, and there’s a bit of caramel that hits at first, then returns in the finish. Very soft, balanced, and inviting. I am feeling kinda like the guy who stopped listening to his favorite band because it became too popular right about now. The Boston Lager is what it is, and for being what it is—and being so widely distributed (and heavily advertised)—it doesn’t disappoint."
"Overal its a good beer with nice malty, bready taste and spicy hops without a lot of biterness"
"Just a real good beer you know you can count on."
"That being said, I've certainly had better in the years since first trying it. I never buy a 6 pack of it, however I do buy the Sam mix packs so I return to this classic quite often."
"Overall: Hey, if I'm in a place that only has macro lagers, this is probably what I'm getting unless they have Sierra Nevada. Its a great entry level brew that isn't necessarily craft, but it is definitely a crossover into getting beer drinkers to see that one-dimensional macro lagers cheat them out of respecting their beer. :-) However, is it just me or has it gotten progressively worse as Sam Adams has produced progressively more year to year?"
"Overall, pretty much the gold standard for its style. Good amount of flavour that could potentially bring in drinkers to craft. It's crisp and drinks well, what more could you ask for here? One of my least favourite styles, here done well enough. I hope this gets enough attention here eventually to enter chain restaurants for an alternative to light macros for when I tag along for after work brews."
"Sam Adams Boston Lager is my go-to beer since it is available almost everywhere. It always provides a nice background for anything else I'm doing at the moment."
"One of my favorites. Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a mug. Poured a nice amber color with a slight off white head that stuck around. Smell is heavy on hops with a undertone of malt. Mouthfeel is very good and easy to drink. Taste is very much like the smell... Heavy hops with malt undertones. Very well balanced. Slight bitterness in the back of the pallet due to the hops, but it's a good bitterness. You could chug these they're so good."
"O - A very flavorful beer for a lager. Not sure how they got away with calling this a lager really. I'm sure they do it lager style, but it seems like they're kind of breaking the rules. Very heavy and flavorful for the style, and quite sessionable."
"This is certainly a complex lager. I would say it’s right in line with something like a Blue Point Toasted Lager."
"O: One of the best flagship beers out there. I never used to like it and I think my palate has changed a lot over the years. Damn fine day-to-day beer, and absolutely your best bet if the only other thing on tap is Bud or the equivalent."
"Boston Lager is sadly the best choice at far too many places. I say this as Sierra is a far better ""best choice"" but Sam Adams has really gotten their name out. I will say this is by far their flag ship and is better than most of their other options. A great beer? Oh god, FAR from it, but I'm always happy to have one."
"This is the perfect everyday for everyman (everyperson for the politicaly correct) brew!"
"O - Okay, I first reviewed this brew a few years back with pen and paper. But I wanted to try the sensory glass and review it again. Overall this brew isnt bad. It's not great either. IMHO the sensory glass looks great, but gave me the same experience as the mug. I've always been back and forth with Sam Adams brews. However, this is an average brew. If you are into this style and want something with a speciality glass get the Sam Adams. If you want a great brew in this style get the GLBC Eliot Ness. We dont have tons of options here in town, but everywhere I go that has Boston Lager 6 packs also carry GLBC Eliot Ness. Both are considered Vienna style lagers, both are around the same price. Dont get me wrong, Boston lager is a better than decent beer, but the GLBC is world class for the vienna style. IMO that is."
"Mouth feel and overall - Much better than the last time I remember having it. I must have gotten a skunked brew on my last tasting. Light, crisp and enjoyable."
"O- Believe it or not this was my first time trying this American classic. I was not disappointed."
"This is a well made beer that is widely distributed. It is a good go-to reliable beer in a place with limited choices."
"Served in a Sam Adams glass. The Noble Hops dominate the aroma in a not very pleasant way. The hops bite in the smell reminds me a bit of bug spray. Thankfully, this does not apply to the taste. There's a faint noble hops taste with a little malt sweetness, and not a whole lot else. Mouthfeel is exceptional. I could see sessioning with this, but it really doesn't stand out tastewise. It feels good in the mouth but leaves no lasting memories on the taste buds."
"O - A good solid beer. Easy to session and tasty."
"C"
"O- This is a very nicely flavored, smooth, and very easy to drink beer. The flavor lingers well on the palate after the swallow, leaving a rich and fulfilling satisfaction. This is a really good everyday beer and would work well in any situation, plus I think this would could be enjoyed by anyone! This reminds me of a light English Bitter....Well done!"
"Opened this bottle 8/19,notched for 5/19,gonna have to pay more attention,just purchased this bottle. Appearance was very good,nice golden,orange hue,also had a descent frothy foamy top. Truthfully could not smell much of anything...and the taste was also disappointing.I continually tasted a bitter floral/honey-sweet taste that lingered no matter how many times or how I drank this beer. My mouth was quite dry once finished,and I found I needed a drink of water. Im sorry to say it will be a while before trying this ever again."
"Great tasting beer that I could drink in large quantities. The aftertaste is refreshing and invites you to have another. Definitely my go-to beer when in airports or other bars with limited selections. You can usually find a Sam Adams in even the worst of places..."
"A great lager - very drinkable. It has an aromatic hop character that puts industrial lagers to shame. The only negative is the pervasive hint of diacetyl in the background, which spoils an otherwise fantastic beer. In any case - a must try for all beer lovers."
"A good beer, much better than the average beers from the big American breweries."
"Good mouthfeel and highly drinkable."
"Just a good beer overall. It reminds me most of Sierra Nevada Pale Ale for good or bad, but it’s one of my go-to beers depending on what bar I’m at."
"What is there really to day about this brew. It's what really got me into craft and a solid offering at most places that carry only bmc. It sure is a looked with a nice amber color and fluffy two finger head. Smell is very floral and inviting. Nice malt profile up front with a subtle hop flavor that comes around after a while. Mouth on it is almost perfect for the style and is velvety smooth all the way down. Overall you know this beer and probably have had your fair share but its always welcome in my home."
"Overall, this is an eminently drinkable, finely-balanced beer in many ways: first, it finds a nice ratio of hops to malt, skimping on neither but also neither letting the flavors get out of hand; and second, it manages to find a nice middle-ground in the larger panoply of beers, easily staying away from the water-like qualities of, say, Anheuser-Busch, but avoiding the harsher, polarizing palates of, say, Unibroue. Yes, there are those who think Samuel Adams doesn't make anything decent, but there *is* a reason why their beers ""have won more awards than any beer in history"" (as per their website)."
"0 - Enjoyable and refreshing beer."
"Pours a clean amber colour, one finger of white head, some patches of lacing. Smell is fairly hoppy, nice malt presence, light citrus some grassy earthiness as well. Taste is malty with some citrus kick, grassy at points, light hoppy finish and fairly clean all around. Good feel, medium carbonation, medium body. Really nice lager, full flavour and quite enjoyable."
"Iced-tea colored pour with an off white head. Plenty of fuzzy bubbles. More hops in the nose than expected. Definitely more floral than citrus/pine (nice for a change). Malt smells sweet w/o a lot of distinction other than a hint of Grape Nuts. This sample is the first where I detect an estery component that seems a little out of place. Can't call it a flaw though. Mouthfeel is on the thin side, and a bit to the beer's determent. A tad more body would be perfect. Still not bad. Finishes like not quite burnt toast."
"Overall: this has been a staple for me for years. Few beers this good you can buy a 12 pack of and keep beer lovers dropping by your house happy."
"Maybe Sam Adams best beer and great for anytime of the year."
"O - Forgot how much I enjoyed this beer back in the day. Really enjoy it, though I could do without that odd metal finish on the nose."
"O - its a lager with a lot of flavor, and it goes down easy and enjoyably"
"O - I really don't like admitting I enjoy anything from Sam Adams, as they have kind of gotten too big and too old for my tastes. BUT, this is a solid offering from them. If it's the only ""craft"" beer choice at a restaurant, I'd go for it."
"O: Good beer that has perfectly blended the flavors we expect in our craft beers with the light body and availability of the big guys."
"Well, after not having it for a few years I still like it a lot. Definitely too expensive to be a regular over more local options, but it was a great option when I had no idea what I wanted. Goes with most foods and my macro-lovin' friends will drink it too."
" Overall not a bad session beer at all, quit refreshing."
"Less hops and more malts would really even this beer out and make a great Vienna Lager. As it stands though it's just OK."
"O - Average. Nothing special in any way, I guess it's just not my style"
"Overall: Great beer overall, has the perfect blend of color and odor mixed with the taste and feel to make this a classic favorite. I love this beer and it is one of my all-time favorites"
"An okay lager. Not great, not bad. Needs more complexity to the flavor, something beyond toasted malt and mildly bitter vegetable hops."
"Overall, this is a solid brew that can be had on a budget, can be found everywhere in the U.S., and is often a lifesaver at bars and restaurants where the only other choices are BMC."
"Mouthfeel is crisp like a pilsner, but not as carbonated. Alcohol is not noticeable, as expected. Decent beer, but not necessarily a personal favorite. That dirty, diacetyl tapline scent is the one thing that bothers me with the BBC beers. Although, a gateway beer into craft for venturers."
"O: A simple beer but a good offering categorically. Still not my favorite style."
"O: A nice lager. Not to complex, just clean and refreshing."
"O: It's pretty well balanced albeit a little on the hoppy side of things. A personal favorite of mine, since it's easier to drink than an IPA but still gives me the hop aroma and flavor I crave. I guess there is a reason this beer has won a number of awards, well done Jim Koch and the Boston Beer Co. no wonder this is your groups flag ship."
"This is a staple lager - awesome beer - great to have at a bar with limited taps."
"O: This was a pretty nice beer. Thirst-quenching, straightforward and uncomplicated. Would definitely buy this again, especially for a warm summer day."
"Sampled this again over the week-end. Poured a nice fluffy head with decent retention with a light amber color. Sweet malt with some hops balancing it out. A little bready with some fruit notes. Medium carbonation and light to medium bodied. A decent offering and sessionable for me although I am not a lager fan."
"O: Probably the easiest drinking craft beer I've had next to Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. I have and will continue to drink this on a very regular basis."
"Compared to every other beer in the world, it’s not much of a contender, but considering that a lot of people see this beer as the transition from mass market adjunct mainstream ""big beer"" to the world of diverse and creative microbrews, this is a commendable effort. Regardless, Sam Adams has a much deeper portfolio."
"Appearance was golden yellow with an inch of light, white foam that faded quickly. Smell was not great...lightly grainy, somewhat sweet. Taste was cereal grains, yeasty, something that played at hops, and overall completely non-descript and generally weak. Overall this is a completely middling offering. Drinkable certainly, if you have nothing better to do and some on hand. Boston Lager resides perhaps two steps in front of the macro macro lagers and at least four steps behind the micros."
"O - Sure, craft brewers including BBC have made other mroe exciting lagers. This is still a good beer that got many into enjoying quality beer."
"I have tried this in the past and I can't get into it. I've tried approaching this beer again, hoping it will change my mind. It's not a complete failure; it's just boring. It tastes better than the macro lagers but that's not saying much."
"Overall middle of the road, but enjoyable and one that will do no problem."
"This beer is one of the more balanced brews that you can find in such wide availability. The notes here are slightly toasted malts with a smooth hop bitterness that is pronounced but not at all overpowering. There's a slight sweetness that nicely balances this bitterness. The beer itself feels slippery and bubbly to the tongue and not heavy at all. The result is a very drinkable beer that is tasty enough as to not be boring."
"The first micro brew I ever had ... In 1984. The best part it hasn't changed. Old faithful. Color a nice light caramel. Smell not a highlight or praise worthy but not unpleasant. Taste .. A nice balance here a bit sweet with caramel notes finishing with a light hoppiness. Mouthfeel.. Easy and smooth, nothing harsh. That's what makes a truely good beer. Luckily its accessible almost anywhere because everyone has been to places where you have six taps and five are Bud and /or Miller products, then this. I`ll take this anyday..."
"It's a very good lager that is both malty and filled with hop flavor. It's not something I would seek out but it's great to see a good flavorful beer that is so widely available."
"I first want to start out by saying that many great beer companies put out much better product and don't pump their advertisement every couple of minutes because...they don't need to, the product sells it self. I maybe a bit bias on this review because I had been putting off trying it for so long. But you can only go to your local store so many times and buy the greats before you need to branch out. After feeling a little bold I picked up a sixer with my buddy. This brew pours clear amber color(let me quickly say that it looks darker on tv haha), small bit of froth, no lacing. Smells sweet, malty. I taste some caramel in the body, sweet and simple, but balanced just like the commercials say. In the mouth it feels like a bit like soda...Not bad for what it is, but it is way over priced. I don't feel like this should be the work horse for any beer company but that's my opinion."
"Overall it's a damn fine beer, but considerably better when it's on tap and you've got plenty of time to kill between flights."
"D: an american craft classic for a reason. well made and very quenchable."
"A very solid beer in my opinion, definitely give it a try."
"Great American beer standard, that can be found pretty much coast to coast. Pours a clear honey-amber color with a small white head that typically retains and laces well. Pretty good balance of sweet malts and hop bitterness. The same can be said about the taste, with a nice malty profile to start, followed by a distinct but non-threatening hop bitterness. Light-medium mouthfeel, and very drinkable."
"D - Not bad for what it is, but the price seems a bit high. I have several friends who love this beer, and occasionally I'll partake in one of theirs, but I doubt I would ever purchase any."
"O: Such a nice lager--one of the best American versions out there; some discernible hops and yet quite balanced"
"O: Nice tasting lager that is more flavorful than most."
"Overall-Great beer, even when consumed out of a margarita glass. I think with this new joint opening up by my apartment/work I will be drinking alot more boston lagers."
"D: Hard to judge something I happily had hundreds of times without thinking of it. Good beer, if a little uneventful."
"For a beer that you can get at around $1 each, not bad at all."
"O: Awesome all around lager, the best part is how readily available this is."
"O: A flagship, a star, a staple in the craft world. I don’t really like it, though. It may be the #1 offering of the #1 craft brewery in the country, but then again, the #1 beer in America is Bud Light. I’ll stick to my guns and leave this as something of a last-resort go-to, as I know it will almost always be available."
"I try a lot of different beers, but I regularly find myself coming back to good ol' Boston Lager. BL has a very robust taste, especially for a brewery with this big of an output. It always finishes nice and never leaves a bad aftertaste. I will continue to hold this one high on my list. There are other beers that I like better, and would rather have on most occasions, but this one is always a good go to."
"Solid. I just have to review this one because it has been a little overlooked in my beer ""travels"". Make no mistake this is one of the best beers in the world. Malty, perfectly balanced on the sweet side with a toasty slight hint of bitter and I always have a bottle or six in my fridge."
"O: Pretty great. This is the third time I've SA Boston Lager but the first time reviewing. Reviewing it gave me a new appreciation for this beer. It is refreshing and pleasant and not bitter. A definite favorite of mine. Not to take anything away from this beer, and maybe the comparison isn't fair, but as good as this beer is, and it is great, I think SA Noble Pils is better."
"T: This is pretty well balanced. Very clean with caramel malt upfront and a slight bit of hops hidden in the back. There's a faint breadiness on the finish."
"O: There's a reason this is a great gateway to craft beer. It's approachable for BMC drinkers and substantial enough for seasoned craft fans."
"Haven't had the original lager in many years. Got 2 in a summer sampler pack. Even after all the craft beers and crazy hopped IPAs I've had recently, this beer is still a good go to lager with enough flavor to satify most of the BAs. If anyone is in the mood for a good lager, don't forget the original that started it all. It holds up the test of time with the best of them."
"O: A well done lager which I don't drink a ton of, but BBC does a great job with their flagship beer. A solid go to at a restaurant with BMC offerings."
"O: A nice alternative to the generic pale lagers out there."
"Not a bad beer, the only thing keeping me from rating it higher is the amount of hops, I prefer a little less hops is my beer. Still, a pretty solid beer, and if you like something with a nice hop bit but not to the extent of an IPA, this is a good choice."
"Still a good lager, as it has more bitterness than expected."
"The Boston Lager, it's a classic brew. The beer has an attractive mahogany color with a light tan head on it. The head settles but still leave a decent lacing. The aroma has a nice balance of hops and malts. The taste is hoppy which I like. Its got enough malt to keep it in the Lager category. The mouthfeel has a bit of a stinging sensation on the tongue. Overall it's a great beer to drink and enjoy with several friends."
"Prost!!!"
"O- Very nice. I used to think this beer was way too bitter (in my MGD days) but now it is quite mild. Still...a nice, solid beer that I would drink anytime. Not quite on par with Great Lakes EN Vienna....but good tasting and will buy when on sale."
"NICE, NOT A MUST HAVE!"
"Overall- A very quality lager from Samuel Adams, being my first offering from them I was very pleasantly surprised, I was expecting it to be just like any other macro beer out there. Although I had my doubts once I got a first whiff of it but the taste very quickly changed that and out did my expectations, miles above and beyond your average macro lager, definitely worth a try happy I tried this one to be honest."
"O - better than I expected - it has been many years since I had this; I remember it being really good; will return to it again and re-assess, but it seems like the beginning of a really good beer that just stops mid-stride..?"
"The best American beer I have tried, beautiful colour and an awesome smell, I liked the touch of fruits. The taste is also good, elaborate and the mouthfeel is great, it is refreshing and at the same time complex. This next summer I will try to have some Maine microbrews, hopefully as good as this beer."
"Overall, this is a nice beer that would be a little better for me if it were less bubbly. In that department it resembles a Bud Light or something that claims drinkability but ruins it with gas-inducing bubbles. If that were cut down, you'd have a very good beer in my mind. As is, it's merely good."
"Overall: A great beer that exceeded my expectations. Will definitely come back to this and it may even become a regular."
"O: There's nothing bad about this beer, but then there's nothing compelling about it either. However, the glass does empty pretty quickly."
"nice golden color, one finger of head with little lacing. smelll and taste are the same, sweet malts followed by hops. mouthfeel is smooth, with just enough carbonation to tickle my tongue. overall a good beer, i cant believe i only drink this once a year."
"The taste is hoppier than most lagers, but not enough to stray from the style, nor turn away those not quite accustomed to hops. Some slightly toasty malts round out the flavor and put a nice bow on the whole experience. There's a lightness and refreshing quality to the mouthfeel and the crispness of the hops, but it still remains full-bodied and pleasant. Best when fresh, of course, but great for any season. It's just one of those great beers that got so many people into beer that has quality ingredients and better taste than most macros, despite how big BBC gets. This is certainly one of my go-to beers still, and unless the recipe changes dramatically, it will most likely remain so."
"O - Boston Lager is a relatively simple brew. It's easy to drink and appropriate for various occasions and food pairings--just a good everyday beer."
"O- This is the first craft beer I had even before I knew it was craft beer. Still holds up as nice widely available beer, even if a place has a poor to mediocre beer selection I can usually bank on Boston Lager to be there. Became my go to beer towards the end of college."
"Overall Drinkability - Reasonably enjoyable, especially for the style. I'll be sure to give this one a second chance when I get a fresher bottle."
"O: Bought a 6 pack of these for our BBQ and before I knew it I drank them all. Very easy to drink, easy to find, low ABV, and easy on the wallet. Surprised I waited this long to have one."
"The taste was up front semi-sweet malts tuning into a great bitterness after the drink. Very much reminds me of almost a semi-sweet chocolate. I was washing down German food with this and it stood up to the vinegary kraut perfectly."
"O- pretty decent beer that you can find EVERYWHERE."
"O- A Boston classic. Great beer for anytime of the year or day."
"Nice job with this one Boston Beer Co."
"I recently learned about the special Sam Adams glasses - I highly recommend them. The aroma of the Boston Lager is excellent, a rich, full beer experience - which makes the flavor taste more full. The mouthfeel is great - a crisp effervescence escapes on the tongue with each drink. The color shines in the classic amber hue. While the word standard may have taken on the association of ""average", I mean to say that Boston Lager should be the standard by which other American Lagers are measured."
"O-Overall a solid brew, an American original. Sometimes when I drink it (it's usually when I go out to eat) I find myself getting full very quick. I don't know why this is. It's always Sam Lager. Anyways, a great go to beer that is always a hit at parties or just with a small group of people. Sam proper never usually disappoints."
"Drinkability: A little too bitter to drink in large amounts, but I could see myself craving this once in a while."
"O: This beer is a classic, and don't get me wrong, it is a great beer, but I prefer the SA seasonals over the Boston Lager any day of the week. As far as American Lagers go though, Sam Adams is the King of REAL Beer."
"Very drinkable beer all things considered. Not a light bodied beer or one of those ""lagers"" with so little flavor its like drinking carbonated beer flavored water. But for what it is, it is excellent."
"OA: May not be the best, but it's consistent, and available everywhere. Boston Lager's totally my go to brew if I can't decide what to try."
"This must be one of the better lagers I've had (most of them are light tasteless pilsners) but this has a nice sweet caramel tone with a slight, but very present hop taste."
"Overall- This is the original, hell what can I say. Always my go to beer and will drink it anytime."
"D/O- Entirely drinkable with the low ABV and enough taste to keep coming back. You can find this at just about any bar, even the beer wasteland known as northwest Illinois. This was my first craft nearly five years ago (December 1st, 2006) and shattered my whole world when it came to what I thought beer was. It would be very cliche but I'll say it anyways, Boston Lager changed my life forever. Review #200, a special one here."
"04/18/11"
"The beer poured a rich gold to copper with a pearly head and mild lacing. The nose was of floral hops and some underlying malt. The taste was very fresh and crisp on the palate and very different from bottles of Sam that I have had. The floral hops started the palate experience that slowly faded and was nicely balanced by the mild maltiness. This brew finished very nicely. The mouthfeel was crisp and refrehing. Overall I am aware that after drnking water over the past couple of days of hiking and camping this beer deficately had an advantage but can you really go wrong with a Samuel Adamas Boston Lager. All hail JK! Enjoy!!!"
"The biggest difference between bottle and tap with this beer is that the roasted bready malt comes out a bit more richer than usual and the hops of course are bit brighter and citric in taste and bitterness. The drinkability is awesome on this and the alcohol content is just right plus its hidden real well with the sweetness and malt profile. This is probably one of my favorite malt profiles in any beer. I've tried quite a bit craft beers and this one is still an amazing example."
"A nice step up from other widely available macro-brews, but not as good IMO as such Sam Adams products as the Noble Pils or the Latitude PA. Very good for style."
"Delivered to the table I am surprised by the look of this beer. Are you sure this is a Lager? Nothing else on the limited menu stood out at all so here we go. The golden straw transitions to orange as it nears the thick cream coloured 2 fingers of head. I get alot of spice on the nose and some herbal, grassy and pepper flavours. The taste is clean and dry for a draft lager. The mouthfeel is semi dry with a good level of carbonation but the combination of dryness and spice is numbing my tongue. I'm not a Lager fan but this is a good, clean beer."
"O: Considering that this is the best beer you can find at most restaurants, I must have had a 100 of these in my life, but taking the time to review one definitely gave me a new appreciation for the brew. Tip of the hat."
"One of the classic craft beers, although its fallen a little out of favor due to its popularity. A solid lager, although nothing exceptional. Slightly sweet taste, with a spicy background. Definitely a good choice at any marginally stocked bar or liquor store."
"Food Pairing: Really anything. All fish, Steak, Chicken, Lamb, Pork, Mild to Strong Cheese, Salted Meats, Smoked Meats, Potatoes, Vegetables, Fruits, Spicy Items, Pastas (just not creamy sauces). Like I said, almost anything. The only thing I wouldn't drink this with off the top of my head is cream sauces like bechamel."
"the color is a crystal clear, light copper. the aroma was ripe with remarkably fresh hops and sweet malt that almost lends itself to caramel. the taste was extremely fresh, more of a citrusy hop than their bottled variety..but maltiness definitely had a strong presence. it was sweet, but only slightly. great medium-light body. i wish i could drink it this way all the time."
"I have had this beer many times and overall it is a great traditional American beer. It has a clear amber look to it with a light smell of hops and spices. It has a nice calm flavor of spices, apples, hops, and oranges. This beer would is great year around and is a perfect after work beer. Cheers."
"D - Great ""everday"" beer. Nothing that offends and it tastes great."
"Drank it from the perfect pint glass. A very solid beer, as well as the first by boston beer company. Perfect balance of bitter hops and sweet malt, this beer never lets me down, great session beer. Boston Lager is what I consider a gateway to better beer."
"This is my goto beer. The brewers of Samual Adams fine craft beers need to be commended for their ability to brew a solid array of beers! The foundation for this success is the Boston Lager!!! The color is a wonderful amber, the nose is a mix of hop and malt. The taste is truly unique. There is a touch of sweetness balanced by hop and malt. I can SESSION this beer any time, any where! This IS America's beer!"
"Overall - What can you say about a beer that's sold thousands upon thousands of barrels? Is Boston Lager real, true, pure craft beer? Maybe, maybe not. I initially didn't like it at all when I first had it 10 or so years ago. But it's grown on me a lot over the years. It's a great starter beer that gets people wanting to discover what else is out there. So almost every craft beer enthusiast owes Boston Lager a debt of gratitude."
"D-A great gateway brew, a safe choice while at a bar. Use this beer convert others but I don't see much use other than that."
"O- This is a very nice beer. Good for a hot day and really nice for just sitting and relaxing. These go down pretty smooth to me."
"Medium bodied with a crisp, earthy hop bite up front that provides a nice dry bitterness lingering throughout over the sweet malt backbone into a slightly dry finish. Hoppier than expected for the style with a sweet, slightly toasted malt backbone. Hints of caramel, toffee and hazelnut as well as some light fruit toward the end of the swallow, mostly citrus peel and apricot. Well balanced with the hop profile really adding something to an otherwise boring style, making this beer pretty quaffable."
"D - nothing great, but pretty drinkable."
"Overall I really enjoy this brew, and it is my fall back when there is nothing else at the bar. Excellent drinkability and flavor for a good price."
"This is a great widely available lager. This is the beer that got me interested in craft beer."
"D: Definitely would drink another. Noticed the hops a lot in the aftertaste and even after I burped from all the carbonation."
"O=I would still consider this the standard for a lager in the U.S., but still hope to find one I like better."
"This beer shows that a beer made to please the most people can still be made with great quality."
"Decent beer. My first SABL I have enjoyed. Not bad."
"Overall: A good classic lager, I enjoy it. Its not a go to for me, mostly because of how much there is out there, but at least I know that if I see it in a bar, I can have something I will enjoy. An excellent session beer."
"Finish: Caramel with some hops and leaves a hint of stickiness on the lips"
"Has a more medium-bodied mouthfeel, yet is still very drinkable at under 5% abv, and refreshing when served cold. A great example of what a German-style lager can be, and a good intro to craft beer for many drinkers."
"D- Very drinkable, enough substance to bring me back for more, but light and refreshing enough that this could be an all day every day drinker. Not the most exciting beer ever but its a classic and a solidly good beer."
"Anyone who has ever ate some world-class ribs - tell the waitress, ""I'll have a Sam Adams with that please."" One of the Finster's all time favorites."
"A very good beer available everywhere bad beer is served."
"Obviously this is a very drinkable good brew. It made Sam Adams. If you get past the fact that they are now everywhere and not really a microbrewer, then you can enjoy it."
"Tasty and well worthy!"
"M/D: Very drinkable but nothing to write home about as being a ""must try"". Something dependable that you can find anywhere. All around i enjoyed it and would again..."
"O: Im new to the beer world, and beer has really grown to my liking. I've havent had the honor of trying any craft beer yet, but so far..Sam Adams Boston Lager is by far and away my favorite beer."
"O: well done beer. Finely tuned and stands the test of time."
"Overall, very solid beer. I think it is easy to group this beer into a mass produced beer category because of its popularity, however I feel that Boston Lager is in a class all its own."
"O - My favorite SA I've tried so far (4th SA)."
"This is my go to beer when I'm in the U.S.. Every once in a while I go crazy in Holland and will pick up a case of this stuff (wich will cost $ 50). The fact that a bunch of my (BMC drinking) friends have fallen in love with this beer says a lot about the drinkability of this beer. My favorite lager"
"MF- Light to moderate body with a clean finish and good carbonation."
"O - This beer surprised me if you couldn't tell. I've become such a snob that i have passed this up in the past. Its still not my favorite beer nor will it ever be, but this is a great example of this style IMO. I see this being a very refreshing summer beer that I will not turn down again, unless there is something I like better."
"Really a decent beer, and a good go-to choice if you're looking for a beer to drink a lot of. Easy to find everywhere, and never an awful choice in a bind."
"Drinkability - Easy to drink and not to rich for excessive drinking. Goes down smooth."
" Easy to down and doesn't fill up quick, great as a session beer."
"D - nothing great, but pretty drinkable."
"D- One of my favorite session beers. Im glad i work at a place that gets this on tap, its even more fantastic on tap!"
"good old boston lager. this grew on me as a session drink. not much of a head when poured but the color is a pretty amber/gold. you can smell the spicy pilsner hops first, then finish with sweet caramel malt. the flavor follows the smell. very smooth and easy, the nice spicy/sweet mix makes this a very enjoyable beer."
"Drinkability: I would drink this beer anytime, but a hearty meal would probably go really well with this. I would also recommend the Sam Adam's glasses. Seems that they would improve the drinking experience of any beer actually."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was how hop-forward it was, and its soft texture. Perhaps it is because we are on a slight hop dry streak, but the most noticeable component of the aroma, and essentially into the taste, was the hops. While this is no doubt intentional, it was a nice surprise. As for the feel, each sip went down with ease, coating the mouth just the right amount, while leaving it dry at the very end. It was soft, and inviting, and makes for a nice sessionable brew."
"DRINKABILITY: a good alternative to ""industrial"" beer for social occasions. I could drink more than one of these and enjoy it. Will definitely buy it again."
"The cpj"
"D - Very drinkable lager."
"Poured on-tap at LAX while waiting for a flight. I've had it so many times, I figured it was about time to put something down about it. Served in a Weisse-vase, it's an amber-gold color with a nice, thick white foamy head that slowly recedes as the beer sits. A malty aroma with the slightest hint of hops on deeper inspection. The beer gives you a malty-caramel sweet flavor with very slightly bitter hops right behind it for balance, and also a slightly peppery characteristic at the end. There is a slight sour malt on the aftertaste, and the finish lingers for a bit in mouth. Very easy to drink throughout the course of an evening."
"D-very drinkable. So crisp and clean"
"Pours a clear amber with about a finger of head fading quickly. There is a mild, malty aroma with some floral hops and a touch of caramel. Moderate to light body, slightly creamy and bitter. Some caramel joins the bitterness through the swallow, ending with a dry finish. Great flavor for a mass commercial brew, and one of my personal favorite regular beverages."
"D - If I am in the mood for an ""everday"" beer, this is usually it. Nothing that offends and it tastes great. I feel it is much better fresh on tap."
" Subdued malt nose has both caramel and toasty notes; just a whiff of herbal hop aroma. Dryish malt character up front opens up across the palate exposing mild sweetness, toasty flavor and hop bitterness. Tangy hop flavor and firm bitterness take over at finish. Aftertaste hangs on for a while."
"Pours a crisp clear pale yellowing orange. A good amount of white frothy head. Very high carbonation. Smells lagerish... not a lot going on on the nose. No real hops detectable but some nice malts on the tongue. Tastes a bit yeasty. I assume this is just from the lagering. I'm not really sure how to describe such a beer. Fairly non-descript but a decent mouthfeel and highly drinkable as is the goal of such a beer"
"For what I consider a mass production beer in the lager style, I find this a very good representative."
"D: This is an extremely drinkable beer. I could go through 2 or 3 without even thinking about it."
"EDIT: tried it again the next day in a glass stein and, yes, the constant nucleation activity (bubbles) from the other glass did make this a much drier drink. Definitely now getting at least a moderate sweet malt sweetness to this beer that gives much support to the very barleycorn predominance of flavor. Hops still play a spicy role in rounding out the flavor. Taste up to 4.0 from 3.5."
"Overall - This is one of my all time favorites. I don't love all of Sam Adams offerings, but the majority of them are good. This one is absolutely excellent. Glad almost every bar and restaurant on earth carries it. The beer has a deceptive complexity to it. Depending on the meal or the mood, I can taste different characteristics. Drink one at cellar temperatures, or even better, drink one at room temperature. You will be surprised at how robust this beer really is. I love it."
"nicely done, easy drinkin', non-offensive beer. Boston Beer Company definitly earns my respect with this tasty brew."
"D - This is a very clean and well-made beer, but not very complex or exciting. From memory, I expected floral hoppiness, but I actually found that earthiness dominates."
"D:Easily drinkable and tastey."
"M/D - Lighter bodied lager, I love this one, a go to for me, could drink the fridge empty"
"great great session beer...you can kick back quite a few of these in one sitting"
"D. A really nice lager. It tastes more like a cross between an English bitter and a German altbier than a lager. This was the first American craft beer I tried several years ago and I like it as much now as I did back then."
"Really nice caramel flavor with light hops. Very nice. Malty flavor and mouthfeel with dry aftertaste. I had this beer a while back, but I really enjoy it a lot more this time around. Excellent brew. I love this style."
"Overall- Simple non offensive beer. One of the better crossover beers to the craft world, but not much too more once you graduate beyond it."
"D) Delicious! I'd drink another."
"This beer has to be in the top 10 gateway beers to 'craft' beer geekery. I still will choose this over 90% of the 'usual' pseudo-craft beers in most restaurants, (ie Blue Moon, Amber Bock, etc.) The hops really shine and and are delightful to savor with the toasty pale malts. Some may call this 'basic' or maybe even 'bland', but I call it a craft beer clinic in consistency and balance. After 15 years or more, it still tastes great."
"Could drink these til the cows come home. I've had it on tap and it's even better, but if you catch a bottle before the date notched on the bottle, its gonna be enjoyable."
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with great flavours and aromas. It's an overall great lager."
"Overall, I really really enjoyed this. The glass probably helped, as it really livened the beer with the constant carbonation but I will definitely be drinking more of these. Not surprised, Sam Adams always pleases me."
"I've always expected a little more carbonation from this beer every time I have it and I'm always surprised by how little it has, but overall good. A good beer thats well balanced, easily drinkable, you can't go wrong with it, its like the old friend that you can always count on."
"This is what was expected! Most foreigners have told me this is the beer america offers! Its good, but maybe not the best. I would love to have this beer on tap. It had a nice dark color to it and had a great mix of bitterness and sweetness! Perfect balance!"
"I would almost like to try this recipe with an ale yeast to ""dirty"" things up a touch and fill in the gaps. The clean drinking lager vibe almost works against it, in my opinion. Also, I most definitely prefer this brew in a bottle, because it needs a good carbonation level to give it that pop. Overall, I never have liked this beer that much and don't think I ever will."
"D: Being fro New England, this is my session beer. If there aren't any pitcher or PBR sales, this is the one I fall back on. Never had a bad time with the Boston Lager and is the most consistent of Sam Adams' brews."
"Mouthfeel is crisp with a moderate body giving it plenty of umph. Overall, what else can be said about Sam Adams Boston Lager? It is a true American classic that I will always gladly have as a nice refreshing lager."
"Had both on tap and from a 12 oz bottle poured in a pint glass. Clear, golden to orange coloured and sparkling beer. Medium-sized blond head. The aroma has citrusy and slightly herbal hops. Clean, slightly bready barley malts. Clean maltiness and light bitterness in the flavor. Dryish and a bit unfresh in the finish. Light to medium bodied, smooth palate. A bit sharp carbonation. Can't do it with this one."
"Not sure what's changed since the early 90's, or how a micro-brewery is able to keep the wal-mart shelves stocked, but the beer is still reliable. I find that it often the only viable choice at many restaurants."
"D- A good session beer, however it becomes one note if you don't drink it quickly."
"Would I buy this beer all the time if it were twelve bucks a case like Miller? Maybe not. Well, I'd buy it every time I had to bring beer to a party anyway. But when this brew is priced a buck cheaper than a great micro lager or classic German example of the style? Nah, I won't be buying this again. Consider that it's more expensive than Sierra Nevada's Pale...which is a very different beer but an excellent example of its respective style...in the eight bucks a sixer range, a brew ought to kick butt...this kicks the butt of the adjunct lagers but fails in any serious lager comparison."
"Sampled at the Sam Adams Brewery in Boston, Massachusetts. Pours a clear golden yellow. One inch thick head and good retention in the provided sample glass. A very good lager, especially when compared with other American Macrobrews. excellent drinkability."
"Cheers!"
"Pours a nice clear amber with nice off white head, good lacing. Aroma sweet toasted malt and barley with some light fruitiness. Taste is sweet toasted malt and barley, some breadiness, with some light citursy hops. Palate is nice medium body, good carbonation, nice clean and crisp mouth feel. Finish is toasted malt, with some light citrus hoppiness. Overall a nice all around and nicely balanced brew. Its a great go to beer."
"Pours a dark amber color. Pleasant, smooth caramel malt aroma. The caramel malt carries through to the taste, which is well-balanced by a firm, hoppy backbone that leaves a slight trace of orange-citrus. Very drinkable, but well worth taking time to savor its depth of flavor, aroma and balance."
"I should buy this one more often. Great beer that's so easy to overlook."
"Drinkability: The best beer available at your local Applebee's, and one of the most important craft beers in America. I've pounded my share of Sam Adams at airports across the nation. It's a staple and go-to for those who respect beer when you have a limited selection, and all for good reason. A very drinkable lager that is satisfying both in taste and in tradition."
"D- This is a well balanced beer with no off flavors at all. The lower ABV is a plus."
"No one need say more."
"Some could argue that this beer, and Jim Koch, started the revolution here in the US towards microbrews and great beer. It's not the best beer available, but you can't deny it's impact on the nation. Good stuff."
"Boston Lager is an exceptional beer. It is extremely balanced and has little hop flavors which is good for a lot of beer drinkers. The beer brings a refreshing mouthfeel and envigorates my tastebuds and after every beer I seem to be wanting more ( like this is something new ) for a lager the color is exceptionally darker, resembling a lighter amber ale. The smell is faint even with the Boston lager glass ( which btw is INCREDIBLE). Thank you Sam Adams for an exceptional lager that is great to drink in lieu of coors or bud."
"A well balance session beer, and the best thing about it is I don't have to go to specialty shop to get a decent brew."
"D: Enjoyable enough, but not great. I'd drink one if offered, but probably won't pick one up again on my own."
"D: Well, pretty damn sessionable at 4.9%. Definitely take this over any AAL or light beer, but would only drink it during a session or party or if nothing else is on tap at a restaurant"
"Pours a cool copper with a hint of a redish tint, with alot of think lacy head that stuck around all the way down. Smells bitter and hoppy. Has a nice strong bitter taste that starts at the tip of the tounge and works it way back very nicely. I consider this a nice big mouthfell that would be very drinkable at any time especailly on a nice cool nice with the feet proped up after a hard days work. I will keep a few of these around pretty much at all times."
"D- This beer is easy to take down by the large amount. The lower ABV helps to this. A great gateway craft beer which I really do enjoy when I need something that is not a hop or malt bomb."
"D: This is my stand by. Am expanding my taste, but will always love sam."
"Forget Budweiser - Boston Lager is the Great American Lager. If I had to choose one beer to have for the rest of my life, it would be Samuel Adams Boston Lager. My sincere thanks go to BBC founder Jim Koch. Cheers!"
"D- This is about as drinkable a beer as there is. From start to finish this beer never dissapoints and is always the saving grace at places that don't have much going on on tap. An American classic that started this whole blessed craft beer movement."
"D - Extremely drinkable, and a very enjoyable session beer."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle to my Genesee beer pint glass. Pours a golden, copperish amber, head comes then fades. Smells of light malts and light hops, nothing too exciting. The roasted malts and sweet taste stay on the tip of the tongue until the sip is down your throat. Not outstanding, but definitely a good beginer craft beer, and an enjoyable day to day beer, very very drinkable beer. Also glad it's pretty much everywhere nowadays gives you a great choice when there is really no choice."
"Drinkability: I have had this on a number of occasions, although I only really have it when it is the best out of other mediocre options."
"Not a bad beer. The color doesn't really surprise me here (considering it's Sam Adams flagship beer, they are going to be mass producing this the most, and while some might think that means they are going to put more time and effort into this beer, I believe they will be putting less), it's basically a standard lager with a little more effort put into it, so the color is bright, somewhat see through, but in no way piss colored, it has a nice color, just nothing outstanding. The smell isn't that terrific, neither is the taste. They are both just ok. It's a very very VERY easy beer to drink, but rating it on just taste and smell, nothing to amazing here."
"Just a very drinkable and all around tasty lager. Try it if you haven't."
"Overall, Samual Adams' Boston Lager is pretty well-balanced and is very drinkable--especially for a lager. It's weaknesses are that it is slightly too dry and not quite sweet enough for this style. I'm used to Vienna lagers being a tad sweeter, but this is still quite good and is absolutely more deserving than Bud to be called ""The Great American Lager""."
"D: definitely would have it again, it's usually the best choice in restaurants/bars that are not beer oriented."
"Doesn't exactly blow my sox off, but i'll take it any day over anything more mainstream. It is becoming more and more available in Southern California bars and grocery stores which I think is a good sign over all for craft beer lovers."
"This isn't a bad beer, but I don't think I would go out of my way to pick it up."
"D-easy drinking stuff with full flavor. a little grainier than I like my lagers but still a good choice."
"D: Good beer to enjoy without getting too full."
"Sam Adam beers were the first craft beers that I ever had, and this one is a fine example of what they are capable of. Very nice."
"Very drinkable and will put this on the ""won't let you down"" list"
"drinkability for me this is one of my go to beers when dining out."
"The Rest: Body is medium and drinkability is OK. A decent beer. but I didn't really care for the finish - I found it kind of unpleasant."
"Although I haven't reviewed it, I far prefer this on tap to bottled."
"Easy drinking, decent tasting. Well made. Not a big fan of the style, but this is good lager."
" I don't mind ordering up one these over a Heineken or Stella."
"D - Highly drinkable year-round."
"I haven't had one of these in prob over a year and usually only when no alternative micro. but a very good and quaffable light vienna lager."
"The beer pours out into an orange-brown color with a two inch white head that has good retention and nice rings of lacing when taking a sip. The smell is of hops, some grains and a grassy smell. The taste is some hops followed by a grassy and floral taste with some grains, caramel, and more hops at the end. The aftertaste is a dry hop finish. The mouthfeel is a nice crisp clean feeling and the decent carbonation and smooth medium body makes it a nice go to beer. A must try for all beer lovers."
"This Vienna style Lager came from a 12 oz bottle and was poured into a standard pint glass. It was very clear with a thick, white, foamy head. The Head retention was good and leaves beautiful foamy rings with every sip. That is how you know it is good beer! The beer smells of malt and grain and it has a slight hint of hop smell. The beer starts off malty, moves to sweet and finish's dry as you swallow. The dryness leaves you wanting to take another sip! This Vienna Lager has some hop bitterness which is more then I can say for most lagers. This is a lager that is very drinkable yet has some character. It knocks the socks off of anything that AB, Miller or Coors are brewing. I would like to think that this is how a lager brewed in America should taste. Way to go Boston Brewing! Prost!"
"This is a classic craft beer, I definitely appreciate it, but there are more enjoyable lagers out there."
"boston lager has a light to medium mouthfeel with good carbonation, all in all a very drinkable beer"
"Drinkability - this is a solid draft beer to have at Lorenzos in Ottawa. I really enjoyed it and can see this been a great session beer."
"It's not drain worthy, but it's not a great beer either."
"D - One of the best beers to be so widely and readily available. Very easy to drink and worthy of any beer fan's fridge."
"D: very drinkable. Doesn't punch you in the face, nor gross you out from lack of flavor."
"The taste is bolder than the smell, hoppier up front with the malts coming through more at the end. The same grass notes are there at the last bit of each sip. Tasty... feels great in the mouth, definitely will consider this as another go-to cheaper session option."
"Drinkability - I'll say it again, I love the hoppyness of the beer. It's my go to beer when I'm looking for something to drink with friends or with dinner. The bitter aftertaste is a little much but well worth it."
"D - This beer is like a great friend who is always there for you and will never let you down. Are there sexier options out there? Of course. But this brew will always be one of my standby's."
"Poured a very nice copper color with slight head. Smell is more pleasant than I'm used to for regular lagers. Mouthfeel is what I expected for a lager (I'm still learning to differentiate mouthful between different beers). Taste is great. This is a very flavorful beer. Malty flavor with a slight hoppy finish. Great session beer."
"This is a quenching, refreshing beer which has plenty of rich malt flavor without seeming cloying of heavy in any way. Nice, bright high carbonation. It's been quite a while since I've had a Boston Lager, but I really enjoyed this a lot & will have to pick up a 6 pack sometime soon."
"Drinkability: Very refreshing, enough interest in the interaction of hops and malt to want to keep going back to the glass."
"Drinks great for a lager, its not over the top or heavy like some lagers. This brew is a great that I can grab, when I am unable to get some of my other favorite brews."
"They must water down the ones you get at the bars because I don't remember the Boston Lager tasting so hoppy on draft. Maybe something to do with bottles and kegs...I don't know. Too hoppy for the style, which might be fine if the hop profile was different, but still the best macro out there."
"In Mass if I sadly end up at a chain restaurant or a place I don't know. I usually have this beer to save me. I've been drinking this forever."
"Overall - It's BBC's flagship beer and perhaps the most recognizable craft beer in the country. I've been drinking it for years, but never reviewed it before. What is there to say? BBC provides in Boston Lager a solid, drinkable beer. It's not as flashy or even as good as many other craft beers out of there, but it's a solid product, a beer that I know I can always go back to and not be disappointed."
"D. Not the world's most complex lager but very enjoyable and drinkable nonetheless. I am always happy to order this beer when BMC dominates the choices available in bars and restaurants."
"D: Low alcohol, good tasting and balanced brew. Easy to drink."
"D - Drinks great for a lager, slight taste and hop thing, but not over the top at all, very easy to drink for me... but I drink DIPA usually. Thumbs up for a drinker."
"D: Went down pretty well as a session drink. I'm not a big fan of all/most SA beers but their flagship beer is not bad and is a really safe choice."
"D: I'll never complain about drinking an Boston Lager, but it's not a beer I would normally purchase either. Still, it's been a savior on more than one occasion for me."
"Overall, this one of my favorite lagers. Has a wide variety of taste that blends together. Always try to order this when visiting the U.S."
"Drinkable, but bland, and too heavily bodied for the taste (or lack thereof)"
"DB- Drinkable and refreshing. A solid flavor in a very affordable lager, I can understand how they would market this as their top beer."
"The beer pours a yellow-amber color with a white head. The aroma is toffee with some grassy hops mixed in. The flavor is heavy on the toffee and grassy hops, with a light amount of citrus mixed in. I also get a bit of caramel malt. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Very easy drinking."
"Notes: One of my favorite beers, and a go-to beer. Typically even better on draft. To me, the Boston Lagers I have had with Fall and Winter 2010/2011 dates are the best I have had."
"Drinkability - Good beer. Very drinkable with good fresh taste. typical of craft American lagers. Nice hop overtones. Could drink a lot of these"
"D-Could easily have all night, very often this is the best thing you're going to find in a restaurant and it pairs well with almost every type food."
"Overall, the Boston Lager isn't going to blow anyone away with its potency or uniqueness, but it is truly a great beer. You forget how good it is simply because it is so widely distributed, but I will never be disappointed seeing it on the drink menu at a restaurant."
"Im glad I got reintroduced to this beer. I tried it back in July for the first time in like 7 years, and I have been buying it with some regularity since. Nice complexity and good for the price."
"D- An easy drinking session beer, can be a go to beer someplace with a limited beer selection. One of my favorite lagers, this and yeungling are both decent."
"D - This is a very drinkable beer. It goes down very smooth, and it is also very refreshing. I could easily drink a 6-pack of these. Good lager."
"D- Very drinkable. Not my first choice of beers, but very high on my sessionable list."
"D - Extremely drinkable beer. The flavors are all really well balanced overall, and it has enough flavor to keep it satisfying. It is also super crisp and refreshing."
"D- The go to craft beer of the century. When I first got into craft it was this bad boy I was ordering, and I am proud to finally pour a cold one at my house and drink it down. Tasty, smooth, and it gets you drunk, too!"
"This kind of beer is not lost one me, but my enjoyment of it tends to be pretty situational. Like now, I'm drinking it in the first stages of winter and I'd prefer it in the summer or fall. That goes for most beer though, and I think this one is pretty good."
"This is what every good lager should be, full of flavor, very refreshing, and very satisfying. This beer is so full it's almost a meal by itself - you don't just drink it, you almost eat it. Glowing praise for this one... it's been around for quite awhile, and I hope to find this beer for many years to come."
"D: This beer really got me into craft beer and it will continue to be one of my favorites. I would have no problem drinking this beer all night."
"to be honest a pretty standard lager. The sad thing is that this is better than most of the commercially available lagers making this a better than the average example of the style. The appearance is amber gold with a medium head. The aroma has grassy hops and not so sweet malts. There is a touch of adjuncts in there. The taste is like the aroma. The palate is smooth. Overall a decent lager."
"D: High. Very high. This is my ""light beer"" of choice unless I'm mowing the lawn on a 90-degree day (then this has too much substance for that, and I really do want something watery like a Coors Light). I can smash this in large quantities, and enjoy every single one of them."
"SA Boston Lager 120z bottle into a 16oz SA perfect pint. My bottles state that this beer is 5.8% abv, not 4.9% abv. Pours a golden copper hue with 1"" off white head, and no I didn't put my bottle cap upside down on it! Recedes to a think pillow like, slightly indented cap. Smells of pale and caramel malts, light citrus hop scent, mainly lemon zest. Tastes fairly sweet, dominated by pale malt with a slight citrus hop taste, followed by a bitter presence on the swallow. Decent lacing is left behind after a few good sips. Overall a balanced beer, a mediocre brew and definatly not a Vienna style lager. I paired this with a mandarin chicken salad with raspberry vinegar dressing, the sweetness of this brew walks hand in hand with the tart dressing in my opinion. Cheers!"
"Overall an outstanding lager, though not very complex, but flavorful"
"Poured from 12 oz bottle into shaker pint glass. Poured a bit of a copper color (darker than your typical BMC offering) with a small head and a little bit of lacing. Aromas of malt; taste is a little sweet on the front with nice malt flavor and very little bitterness at finish. Not a bad offering at all; will work when bar/restaraunt is beer challenged."
"Two fingers slightly off white head, slow dissipation with minimal lacing. Copper/amber clear body, quite a bit darker than most lagers I've had, multiple streams of carbonation. Nose is dominated by roasted malt, some sweetness re caramel with good dose of floral and noble hops. Taste mirrors the nose, a bit sweet up front, good roast in the middle, and surprisingly hoppy finish, not real bitter. Mouthfeel is on light side of medium, medium effervescence. A really well made lager, and given the options this was a pretty good beer to have while waiting for a plane."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: This beer was light bodied with pretty smooth, abundant carbonation. About what I expected, but not bad. This is a drinkable beer, for sure. It beats the hell out of any BMC swill, and is something that I will come back to occasionally."
"EHad on tap probably more than any other beer, but tonight's review is courtesy of the taps at pap razzi in boston (home town of sam adams). Pours the classic clear orange color with little to no head and some signs of lacing. Smell is a malt bomb. Taste follows the nise with a touch of a bittery after taste going on. Mouthfeel is beery and drinkability, well let's just say this is far from my first sam adams and far from my last for yhe night. Typically the best on tap offering in any restaurant."
"Pours a bright amber color with about a finger and a half of off white head. Head is big and creamy that hangs around for a while leaving a faint trace of lacing as it recedes. Smell is a bit faint. Very grainy with some sweet malt tons, not picking up much hops. Taste is similar only more impressive. Again that graininess that seems to come with most lagers long with some sweeter notes. Some nice faint hop flavor in the finish, a perfect amount of flavor to accentuate a nice brew. This was one of my ""treat yourself"" beers before I discovered the rest of the craft universe, it's nice to come back and review it after trying everything I can get my hands on for the past year. I never realized until now that the abv clocks in at 4.75%, making this an incredibly drinkable beer in every sense of the word."
"12oz bottle with a Best before date of Mar. Pours a translucent amber color with a thin head. Some lacing. Aromas of lemon peel, hops, and a bit of cut grass. Nice caramel flavor to it along with lemon and some grain flavors. Drinkable and more flavor than most beers <5% ABV."
"Pours a golden amber with a fingers worth of head. Smells are sweet malt, faint hops, a little earthy. I've never really ""critiqued"" this beer before, there's actually quite a bit going on. Tastes are nutty, sweet malt, a slight green apple yeast taste. Mouthfeel is medium, drinkability is extremely high. We all know Sam Adams makes a world-class product, I'm glad I actually took the time out to sit down and review it. I've had this beer countless times over the last 15 years, and it's still quite enjoyable."
"D As mentioned, the exceptionally good taste make this very drinkable. Add in that the ABV is only 4.75% and you have one damn easy beer to drink! 5.0"
"A staple beer in my book."
"With a clean, crisp character, this is a very drinkable brew. I now completely understand why this is the perfect fall-back beer if there's nothing else good on tap. The Boston Beer Company continues to impress me with their efforts and I'm very thankful that their brews are ubiquitous in bars all around the country."
"Drinkability: An easy drinking, tasty beer that's readily available most anywhere you go. It's one that I've enjoyed plenty of times in the past, and will continue to do so whenever the selection is less than impressive. Cheers!"
"Poured a clear golden amber with a suprisingly long-lasting white head. Smells of high-quality European malt, a bit biscuity and with a touch of noble hops. Taste is more malty than hoppy, and quite rich and bold despite it's light, crisp body. I could drink these all day long, and often treat it as a go-to beer at most bars or restaurants."
"D: Good old SABL. Even in a wasteland of BMC taps, you can usually count on SA to save you from shitty beer, which is exactly what happened on this evening. I enjoyed this particular pint much more than I ever have from the bottle; it was brighter, crisper and fresher than expected. A boozy savior."
"This is always an old stand by, since I can find it on tap most places that are heavy on the BMC, but it really is more than that. A solid lager that remains insanely consistent year in and year out."
"It's a classic in American craft beer....and while it isn't the most complex beer in the world, it's pretty tasty and drinkable. Could be a good ""go to"" beer for people."
"Ok, so this brew is a dead classic. I believe I had my first SA in 1988-89? It was a revelation then. This is still a solid, well crafted beer. In a work of craft brews that has exploded in the past many years, SA still distinguishes itself. Number one asset---excellent drinkability with full flavor. Good malt and hop presence with a touch of biscuity yeast. Nice creamy head and mild carbonation. Really a delightful beer. Pairs very well with food. Sometimes it's nice to revisit the classics. SA lives up to it's deserved reputation."
"Boston Lager isn't what I thought it would be. It was bit more maltier than I would have previously guess, but it's a solid brew nonetheless. To be honest it's just not something I would get regularly but it sure is better and more complex than Bud or the other super popular macros. It's sweeter or I guess more floral-y tasting than I thought it would be, which caught me a bit off guard, but I can't say anything negative about it. Well balanced, medium carbonation, and an inviting, unique flavor make this a standout compared to the hyper-popular brands."
"Drinkability- not overowering, not anything special, but a good crisp aftertaste will lead to another beer."
"D- Very easy to drink. Almost boring but not quite. Hints of vanilla tease and carbonation is just right. Very enjoyable and creamy, dreamy beer. Not complex, but nice. Crisp finish."
"D: Felt like a mass produced beer."
"Copper in color with a nice long lasting head. Aroma of citrus hops balanced by a sweetness of malts. When you smell it you know it is Boston Lager. Body is crisp and firm . Nicely balanced flavors, with citrusy hops slightly dominate over malts. Just perfect but highly underrated lager."
"not overly complicated but just complex enough to keep me interested. great american lager."
"D - Definitely better than all the BMC beers it first competed against; very drinkable and definite classic"
"D- Is really high. This beer is well balanced, inexpensive and very enjoyable. Easily a session beer."
"D- The balance is what made this beer so enjoyable and I would drink this almost anytime."
"fairly drinkable not one of my favorite from Sam Adams but pretty good"
"I'm always surprised whenever I have Sam Adams Boston Lager on draft, how good it is. Now that it is nearly ubiquitous at almost every chain restaurant and corner beer store, beer connoisseurs seem to take this beer for granted, but it has great hop flavor and aroma. This is especially true at busy restaurants where this beer seems to sell well and stays fresh. The copper color is inviting and again, the hops keep this beer refreshing, the perfect foil to greasy burgers and deep fried food. There is enough malt and sweetness to make drinking a breeze. Beer drinkers should really reconsider this well balanced and unpretentious lager that pretty much defines the craft beer movement on the East Coast."
"Was at a bar that had the special Sam Adams glasses so had to try it out in one. Certainly looks sexy in that glass, creates a perfect frothy white head, good retention and lacing on top of a yellowish light brown, medium carbonation. Smell earthy and bready, some faint hops. Taste crisp hops balance the malt body. Very flavorful lager, several steps above any lager I've had since Smuttynose Portsmouth lager. Almost pale-ale-esque in its bitter finish. Very enjoyable and supremely drinkable."
"D: Mild-straight forward flavors, great balance, low ABV."
"Good overall middle of the road beer for many occasions."
"Drinkability: It's drinkable, that much is for sure. Really watered down though. This is a summer or session beer, the kind you drink with a meal or something. It's not that this is a bad beer, it just isn't a top tier lager."
"I may look back on this review later in life and accuse it of being colored by nostalgia, as this beer was one of my two ""pillar beers"" that forever addicted me to good craft beer (the other being Dark Horse's Crooked Tree IPA). From my current, most objective point of view however, this is a very good, very easy-to-find beer. Almost every bar worth visiting will have this on tap, so I'll always have something to drink when I go out with friends. There is a reason this beer is popular. It's a very balanced beer full of flavor and character, and one that I never hesitate to recommend. Samuel Adams may have other beers that I would select before their Boston Lager, but it will always be welcome in my fridge."
"Notes. Great lager and still one of my go to's. My first brewery tour was with them and i havent had a better lager yet then a fresh samuel adams on tap from the brewery."
"This is my favorite beer of this style. This beats any of the American adjunct lagers by a huge margin. It's my go-to beer if I'm not in the mood for any particular style."
"Having one as I write this. For a now large commercially produced beer this one is pretty good. Great taste, looks great in the glass and something you could have a multi-beer session with. Wouldn't hesitate to buy in the super market over many of the other commercially produced big beers."
"Drinkability: This is really a sessionable beer -- nothing really wrong with it at all; while it's nothing to get especially excited about, it is certainly solid and is definitely a go-to beer."
"This beer is completely different beer on tap and in the bottle. It pours just about the same with a nice dark amber color, and about a centimeter of white head. It smells of fresh floral hops, caramel, and nice sweetness. Tastes have the same notes and it is extraordinary. mouthfeel was a bit heavy and undercarbonated, but that may have been more of the fault of the bar i was at, and not the beer its self. Very drinkable beer and i was happy to have another. Out of the bottle i liked this beer, on tap, it was pretty great."
"2010 Red Boston Lager Banner Cap 12 oz-B. 4.90% ABV. 25 IBU's? (4.0 / 5.0) Dense lacy white well retained head. Clear bright pretty amber orange color. Mild Noble hop light toasted front. Mild sweet delicate caramel fruit hint amber lager body. Smooth refreshing mild hop end. Well made tasty balanced Amber Lager. Sampled 10/23-25/2010 from Winter Classics Variety Pack Purchased @ Seattle Fred Meyer--Ballard For $12.99 on 10/23/2010."
"D: A great choice when in the mood for something light and/or simple. Also a good choice with wings or other bar food while watching a game."
"Pours a clean orange-ish color with yellow hints and an off white head. In the aroma, malty, sweet to dry and a small hop presence. In the taste, gingerbread maltiness, and a lager like hop balance. A small bite and medium to light bodied mouthfeel, with a small dryness to a clean aftertaste. Simple, easy, and almost ale like."
"I can't believe it's taken me this long to review one of the gateway beers. The first beer to pull me away from drinking the crap beers in college. This pours a deep rich amber color with a thick ecru foam adorning the surface. The aroma could be fresher the hops really have not held up in this tasting, it doesn't smell all that great, but I know the potential from many previous experiences that it can get much better. The nice balance of caramel and malt gives the aroma and flavor a nice 1-2 combo. There is a wonderful toasted aroma and flavor that goes along with this beer. The mouthfeel is nothing extraordinary it does it's job, there is still residual bitterness that I can't get past, but it's still a solid brew. There may not be too many beers that are easier to consume than this, if this recipe was a tad bit smoother I would love to swim in it, but as it stands, I could drink this about anywhere."
"This is one of the best widely available beers. It's a great choice when you don't have much choice. Recommended."
"Excellent drinkability. You can really take these down. In this situation, in this format, this was one of the best beer experiences I'd had in awhile. Really excellent."
"D- Delightful to drink, smooth with a crisp finish. Would recommended with out a doubt."
"Notes: This was one of the first beers I was exposed to when I started drinking craft beer. I loved it then, and it is still good now. Taste and smell seem a bit more subdued than I remember, but I will chalk that up to a more developed palate. I distinctly detected some caramel in the taste and smell, which is not really appropriate for the Vienna Lager style, so a point or two was deducted on that account."
"Sam Adams Boston lager is my go to beer at regular restaurants and places like bowling allies and sports venues. It the the best readily available beer in my opinion, I am glad Sam Adams has gained enough popularity to be in most places."
"Totally drinkable, but I would opt for a few other things before this. Luckily for this beer, it is pretty widely available (at least in the northeast US), and is sometimes the best tap option."
"This is the one brew that's always in my fridge rotation. Really there is no other lager nearly as balanced, it's not over-hoppy, smells a touch hoppy and finishes slightly hoppy. But there's a touch of caramel, and to me it's a little nutty. I enjoy pouring it into a glass because the head stays creamy and it laces all the way down the glass. It also smells great for the entire drink, and the entire mouthful goes down nicely."
"I need to find the guy on the commercials with the long goatee and shake his epic hand."
"D: Nothing complex here, nor do I believe that was Sam Adams intention. It gets the job done nicely!"
"Great effort by Sam Adams! This beer oozes quality without going over the top, it's still very drinkable, even in quantity. A little spendy sometimes compared to local offerings, but I'll definitely grab another sixer of this again."
"I know this is the most well-known of the Sam Adams beers, but so far it has been my least favorite."
"Overall i am not a fan of this beer, never have and never will be. I just don't understand why this beer is so popular. I would much rather cook with this beer then drink it."
"Pours a hazy golden brown color with a medium white head that diminishes quickly. The scent is quite hoppy with very little malt presence. Taste is quite tasty...Initially I get some malty flavors with caramel, followed by some well-balanced hoppiness. Finishes with more tasty malt. The mouthfeel is pretty full-bodied and not overly carbonated or too light. Drinkability is very high."
"D-could dance with this one all day, only wish my Bills were this good"
"D: Excellent. If i happen to be in the mood for a lager, this is what I pick up. Plus, it's often on tap big chain restaurants and other places that wouldn't otherwise serve good beer."
"Drinkability - Smooth enough for easy-drinking, and complex enough (mostly in hop variety) to keep the drinking entertaining!"
"Summary: This is an excellent beer. I gave it 8.7/10, or a B+. I've had lots of lagers before and I like this one. It can be paired with just about any cuisine you can think of. It looks great, especially when in its custom glass. Most importantly, it tastes great. I would drink this beer again."
"First of all -- it is a decent session beer. With a 4.75 ABV it rings true to be a good session. It pours a medium amber color with medium head and half decent lacing. Smells fairly bad with a lot of booze and malted barley aroma, some hops in there but kinda hard to discern. Tastes of blended malt and hops with a good hop nose. Mouthfeel isn't too thin -- makes for a smooth drink. Drinkability is good as with most of Sam Adams stuff."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink. Mellow enough to want to drink more, but strong enough to keep satisfied."
"Caramel malts and a few notes of hops rise to the nose. Tastes malty with a hint of light fruits and a bitter back end that fuses almost perfectly. Well-carbonated and light to medium-bodied but, still quite sessionable. One of my favorite lagers, and a tad bit underrated in my opinion."
"This beer has remained consistently exceptional throughout its long and storied, and award-winning, life. So common that I hadn't had one in years, so I was very, very pleasantly surprised when I retuirned to its fold. Way to go Sam Adams! This is the quintessential American-style Lager - copper coloured and slighly overhopped. All-American in the true-blue sense of the term. Bravo!"
"Nicely put together beer. Great for a meal, watching the game or just kicking a few back. Aroma is a nice and full and hints at good things to come. Color is nice with dark orange or red tints. Taste is nice with some hops at the end, more caramel up front. Easy drinker with a rewarding taste, not the most complex beer but a good drink."
"Honestly it had been a long time since I really paid attention to a Sam Adams Boston Lager I was drinking. Well, it's a cross in color between gold and copper. Has a modest 1/2"" head but that head stayed a long long time. Flavorful enough to get noticed but not a powerhouse. You get some sweetness, some caramel, some malt. All in all a quality beer for the price."
"All in all, this was one beverage that sort of helped catalyze my interest in beer, specifically in microbrews. A good stepping stone into the beer world, and just an all-around solid brew for America."
"Mouthfeel is a light body with medium carbonation. Drinkability is good. Not a bad beer at all, just nothing to get really exited about."
"This one poured a burnt pumpkin orange in color with a poofy off white head. It was well carbonated and appeared very bubbly and active. It smelled malty and had good hoppyness to it. The taste is a nice balance of malt and hops and I'd say that if I had to choose then I would say it every so slightly favored the malt. It had slight sweetness to it, not honey but similar to. It drank fresh and crisp and was very refreshing. It's quite drinkable, although I'd never buy a six pack of it."
"D: continues to be on of my favorite pairings with almost any food, especially steaks/burgers. Doesn't overpower the meal but compliments it nicely. As many have said and I agree, great ""gateway"" beer to craft because it's just a solid offering."
"It's dark gold with a surprisingly nice head. The smell is something of an off note, as it's really just light toasted malt, but the taste is complex, with some nice floral hops to go along with your caramel malt, maybe some citrus oil as it warms. A very fine carbonation makes it drinkable and refreshing--really a solid beer, and I'm thrilled it's out there turning people onto craft."
"Had this on tap earlier today at Angelos in Anaheim. 32 oz poured in a plastic cup. Amber in color with a decent head but not lasting long. Malts and hops. Hops seem to dominate, especially in the finish but not overpowering by any means. Great drinkability with it's under 5% abv. Well balanced. Washed down my chicken strips and fries nicely."
"I think the Boston Lager is quite drinkable. It's not a beer I usually, but if it is what I decide to enjoy, I can easily have a few rounds. This is a fine selection to have on hand to share with beer drinkers of any kind."
"Definitely a good candidate for a session beer."
"No brainer, very easy to palate!"
"A beer that is considered great by many people..but i am not one of those people. Samuel Adams produces a lager that is way over hopped for that style of beer. Additionally it doesnt seem like they are even using the correct type of hops because it is far too bitter for a lager. This beer looks good but is far from it. Sam Adams claims that it is i craft brewery but in actuality it is right up there with Budweiser and Coors."
"I could drink this beer for a long time. Very delicious, smells great, tastes great."
"D- real drinkable lager. Fantastic gateway beer"
"D: I really like this lager. Hate to admit that this is the first time I've tried it after passing up the opportunity so many times. Definitely recommend this beer. It is light and extremely sessionable."
"D-very drinkable. In the Boston area, this really is a reliable beer to go to. On tap is loads better."
"A great step up from an BMC. Nice mild session beer with flavor."
"The drinkability is high since it's not too heavy on anything and doesn't seem to be lacking anything. A good mouthfeel, but nothing else really stands out. Overall though, I like it."
"Pours a copper color with a 1"" white head that left a tiny bit of lacing. The head slowly dissipated and ended leaving a thin foam on the surface of my beer. Smells of floral hops and a little bit of caramel. Taste is malty with little bit of hops to balance it out. Heavier and more flavorful than an BMC lager, but it still has the clean finish that is a point of attraction to those beers. Mouthfeel is medium with average carbonation. Overall a simple but very enjoyable beer. I drink a beer to enjoy it, not to have my mind blown by the 98 flavors to sort through. This is a simple beer, and its a great beer."
"D- great session beer or something to pair with really any type of food; it's not overly complex, but an easy drinker and craft-transition beer"
"All in all, if you go to a bar with out a good beer selection, there's still a chance it might have this, in which case it might be the best beer available. Its better than budweiser tho maybe not as tasty and drinkable as yuengling. However, once compared to the other craft beers and foreign beers, this lager falls quite short."
"Unbalanced with to much hops."
"medium bodied/carbed. almost the prototype of a session beer."
"Good beer for a simple lager. Absolutely not SA's best offering in my opinion."
"It pour a golden amber color with a good head of foam. It does have a slighty biter taste to it but just ever so slight. It makes it so it's not too strong but also not too light. A surprisly good beer for the low price and big name brand behind it."
"Pours a golden amber colour with nice off-white head. Some lacing down the glass. Smells of mild hops with some nice caramel malt and toasted nuts. Flavour has more bitterness than most lagers, but certainly not a bitter beer. Fairly sweet and malty flavour. Carbonation level is nice. Easy beer to knock several back."
"D: Yes! A very drinkable lager. Nice balance - you get the caramel malt and toastiness plus the hop bitterness at 4.75% = very drinkable."
"Overall, Sam Adams is an exceptional lager. I can't believe that I've only tried it recently. I'll definitely be buying this again."
"D: This is a solid beer, good for all around drinking. Definitely worthy of being a regular session beer."
"There is a slightly odd aftertaste at the end. I have always noticed it in this beer and never really cared for it. Aside from that, a pretty good beer."
"D: Overall, a nice drinkable beer. Likely one of the two first craft beers I ever had. I remember thinking how awesome this tasted when I first tried it. Well, after many years, this one still stands up well. But with all of the stronger, bigger beers to measure up to nowadays, this one still makes one heckuva session beer to ponder those old-time memories over."
"Drinkability is decent, but price is high and there are equally good aussie and euro beers at lower prices. Also hard to come by, maybe if the chance and urge pop up together i'll get this again."
"D- Easy to down and not too pricey. It's imported here though, so I don't think I'd be trying it again."
"D - I'd drink this one anytime that I wanted a no fuss lager. Pretty good for a mass marketed micro/macro brew."
"M- Very crisp. Highly carbonated and dry."
"D - Better than average drink. But after a few the unbalanced bitterness gets tiresome to the tongue."
"The appearance is a tad lighter than I remember and have had in the past. I find this with most of their mixed packs that the beers vary. Either way it's a golden color with an off white head and sick lacing down the glass. Aroma is malty sweet biscuity goodness but one dimensional and remains that way. The flavor is really smooth but not a lot going on. Some caramel maltiness and sugary biscuits. Mouthfeel is nice. Very good smooth flavors round out a mild hop balanced bite. Drinkability is a perfect 5 and really a perfect session beer, not by definition but by intention of drink at least a 6er of these."
"A darker amber fills my glass, as I crack open this Boston Lager from the 2010 fall seasonal pack. I immediately catch a whiff of the malts in the forefront, though some floral notes are detectable. Taste is very crisp and clean, the hop flavours are slightly more prevalent in the taste, but the malt backbone is still the star here. Feels great on my tongue, with adequate carbonation and not being too this as many in this style attempt to do, so as to have more in common with the Macro competition. Sam Adams is the perfect ""gateway beer"" They make well done craft beers that are easily accessible, reasonably priced, and almost always delicious."
"Bottle purchased from The Beer Emporium, Sandbach. Poured a pale straw colour into glass, head soon faded. I quite liked the smell, hints of malt promised more. Not a bad taste, a well balanced lager with a good malt taste with hints of caramel. Mouthfeel was smooth, a little too much carbonation for me. Overall a good session lager and one that I would try again."
"The Sam Adam's Boston Lager pours a golden honey color in the glass with a thick, creamy white froth. Subtle, balanced, an somewhat sweet aromas of Cherrios, grains, light toffee, & hops (pine, spice, citrus(orange skin)) continue on the palate with a light body, creamy texture, & long finish. The lager has a sweetness up front & crisp dryness on the finish with a definite hop presence. (By no means is this beer like an IPA or PA, but hops are present) Overall, this is a pretty good beer & the best Macro-Brew available. Recommended."
"Roasted malt and yeast to start, then mild hops. Hop bitterness remains a decently long while. Medium-light body and good carbonation. Interesting feel and flavor but not intensely captivating. Enjoyable nonetheless!"
"Could be a bock with all that malt."
"I would not recommend this lager, there are other Sam Adams brews that are much better."
"I don't know why I can't get into Sam Adams, they seem to be well reviewed and my friends love it, but the only one I've had that I liked was their summer ale. This was kind of blah, needs a little more flavor and the smell was off-putting for me."
"Drinkability - Very drinkable"
"D-Easy drinking without sacrificing flavor. Nothing too bold but definately memorable and yummy."
"Initial pour head of about one finger, but fizzed to a thin ring in a few seconds. Color is a 9 on the SRM Chart. Just a bit cloudy with very small bubbles. Pleasing taste, not too bitter or heavy. Sits well on the tongue and goes down well. The beer doesn't do the advertisement justice. I was expecting more. Not unhappy but not thrilled either. A trite pricey for what you get."
"drinkability: the balance of this beer makes it easily drinkable. also makes a good session beer."
"D- A great every day beer, very drinkable, clean, right on style, solid backbone, sold character. Nice beer."
"D- An all around good beer, though nothing necessarily stand out. A reliable beer and a classic."
"Very drinkable, the only thing keeping it from being a 5 for me is the fact that I get tired of it fairly quickly and start seeking out something with more flavor/complexity. For what it is this is a great beer."
"D: The beer is rather easy to drink and is quite sessionable given its low alcohol content."
"d - A very solid lager that is very easy to drink. Have had many times and will have again."
"F: Finishes very clean, and perhaps a little too quick, with a slight lingerin earthy hop bitterness, and light toasty crystal malts and crisp lager taste."
"D - what can I say...might be the setting, sitting in Logan watching a Sox game, but I cant remember having a Boston Lager so enjoyable. really a treat amongst all the other readily available BMC offerings. cheers to Boston!"
"D - Great, ubiquitous beer that's a good gateway for BMC drinkers. Refreshing!"
"All in all, I think this is a great example of an under-produced beer style. You can find it just about everywhere, its a good beer to choose when your at a bar with somewhat meager choice of taps. It is also good beer to bring to a party and try to get your buddies into ""craft""."
"O: Really good beer ease your thirst with."
"Great beer all around. Appearance is excellent. Smell is fresh. Taste of wonderful hops. Mouthful see taste. Drinkabilty is good. Any more than 3 beers, a buzz starts to kick in. After a six pack you begin to buzz even more. This is a beer than should have been around a lot longer than you average American beers of Bud, Coors or Miller and taste better."
"D: Excellent beer for warm evenings. I would say it's sessionable due to the complex flavors going on; the beer has a story to tell with every sip"
"D: I wanted my first review to be of a beer that started me on the path of beer. A great beer. Nothing outrageous, but balanced and drinkable."
"D: I have no problem drinking another of the same. You want the hop aftertaste to stay and not go away. It is good that the Boston Beer Company got big yet stayed true to it mission, to make good beer!"
"Refreshing to drink and enjoy. A great beer that is easy to get and just as easy to drink."
"Beer is medium in body and has mild sweetness up front, some bitterness in the back but mostly a malty feeling throughout. The sweetness up front give way to some carb on the palate and the late bitterness. Mild aftertaste overall a fine beer. I've had it hundreds of times and I'll have it again."
"Comment: The bottle mentioned that it was brewed with Bavarian Noble Hops. Overall this beer has great drinkability but is nothing too special."
"very drinkable. not overly flavorful, but compliments my pizza well. would have another if offered or if im somewhere that has nothing more exciting on draft."
"D: Easy session beer. If no quality beer store is open, this is your beer of choice."
"Taste, its all about the malt toasting, which is quite nice here for a lager. Some say hops, I don't taste it. Little bit of sweetness. Introductory level style. Way pricey for its complexity."
"Definitely drinkable. Good session beer. Great on a hot summer day. With this who needs summer ales?"
"[draft at Max and Erma's - Moon Township, PA] Wonderful coppery color. Mild hoppy aroma with just the lightest hint of sweet malts underneath. Good hoppy taste that is not too overpowering and leaves just enough of an aftertaste to let you know you just drank a good lager."
"D- I wouldn't drink more than two at a time on account to the bitterness. The taste isn't what I look for in beer, but by no means is this bad. Will drink again, and I will enjoy it, because it is a good beer."
"Drinkability- It's strong enough to be satisfying, yet light enough to imbibe multiple bottles. When I was a wee lad, I thought Samuel Adams was a disgusting beer; luckily, I have since seen the error of my ways. This is one of the best beers you can find at any major supermarket."
"D - One of the beers that got me started down the road of better beer. As I said above, very inviting. A great amount of flavor for an under 5 ABV, and a great gateway into the world of better beer."
"Final Notes: It may not be the best beer in America, but it's good. A great beer to pair with grilled foods, and a nice session beer for a night out at the bar. And for the record, no, you really can't float a bottlecap on the head, I tried."
"this beer has really great drinkability, its price and availability also make it great. quenchs the thirst on a hot summer day, but still good all year round and now that its in bombers makes it even more convienent, 3$ for one of them. just maybe next time ill check the freshness date before i buy it."
"D: Very drinkable, though my curiosity usually leads me to drink other beers when they are available!"
"One of my favorite standard lagers. A great choice while at a typical bar that doesn't offer too grand of a selection. As far as its appearance goes, it's very clear with a gold color to it and a thin head. Nice hops, great smell for a non-premium lager. Nice aftertaste - just the right amount of bitterness. Taste-wise it's not too heavy, but also not too light - very smooth."
"This review has been brought to you by the semicolon."
"Mouthfeel is slightly creamy, with a somewhat dry finish. Sessionable, and I've always thought that a blind taste test would be a good way to convert a BMC drinker, but aside from its role as a 'gateway,' it's a decent beer even for non-lager drinkers and I've had to fall back on it on occasion."
"D - As previously mentioned, my expectations were not that high, however, this one well exceeded them. The scent was much stronger than I would've thought and the flavours were nicely balanced. Finished a little on the dry side, but did not take away from the overall experience. Could and would easily take down a 6-er of this in a session."
"This is not too heavy, goes down very easy and has big flavor for a lager."
"Serving Type--On Tap."
"D: Great big flavor, but not overwhelming. Delicious but session-worthy. An all-around good beer."
"this may very well be the best beer I've ever seen on T.V. commercials. I was surprised by this beer and would drink it again with no hesitation"
"This probably the version of this style that is the most familiar to the American beer drinker. On the whole it is a solid and decent example of the style, but not exceptional. A lovely copper-gold color, a nice semi-sweet grain scent, nicely balanced malt and hop flavors, a solid but not heavy body and easy drinkability are the hallmarks of this beer. This may not be on the top of a lot of beer lovers lists, but you can count on Sam to never let you down."
"D- you can enjoy these all day. When you are surrounded by Ameican Adjunts... Sam is there to save the day. A real good brew that can always be counted on"
"Sam Adams Boston Lager is just one of those beers you can't go wrong with. It fits every occasion and taste good. It is easy to find at just about any establishment you go to. It always looks good, smells good and taste good enough not only for yourself, but when you have company over. Even the pickest of beer drinkers (my wife) will drink it."
"Overall i was very impressed with this beer, I always just assumed that it wasn't all that good cause of marketing like BMC beers, but its pretty good and most places have this."
"Pours a crisp reddish-amber color, with a fairly dense, medium white head. Aromas of sweet malt, caramel , cereal grains and some mild hoppiness. On the palate I get more of the sweet malt and caramel, a little nuts and maybe some hops. Overall, this is a very crisp, drinkable and enjoyable beer. After all these years, this one is still pretty good."
"This beer has very good drinkability. I always seem to come across purchasing this beer."
"Poured a 12 oz. bottle into my Samuel Adams Boston Lager glass, which really does create a nice presentation. The beer pours golden amber, with a nice head that leaves lacing along the sides as you drain the contents. The hop aroma is floral, green and budding with underlying notes of spice. There is a pleasently understated whiff of sweet, the light fumes of burning sugar in a pan. The body is smooth and malty. The initial sip is slightly sweet, caramel, with very slight notes of roast and nuts. Hop flavor is restrained, but notable, delivering a bit of spice promised in the aroma. I've heard some describe the finish as dry, but I would lean towards soft."
"Drinkability - Very drinkable"
"Overall: A good middle of the road lager that is a great gateway to better beers."
"Drinkability - Probably about two or three before moving on to something else. Mainly because of the overabundant hop flavor."
"D: I bought 6 and drank 6. It doesn't get any more drinkable than that!"
"If it isn't, Samuel Adams Boston Lager should be considered a classic. One of the very few easy-to-find beers that is absolutely drinkable."
"D: A highly drinkable Vienna Lager with no alcohol burn at all."
"D- easy to finish one to several of these. a great gateway into the world of craft beer. its probably one of the first beers with actual flavor that most people have."
"D - I'll find something better to invest my beer money in."
"Taste is great, very refreshing and malty. It's fairly thick and creamy. Super drinkable an crisp. Awesome lager."
"D - A very good go to beer that seems to be everywhere at this point. In some places this would probably be the only good option on the menu. I am very glad that this alternative option is quite tasty."
"NOTE: A total of three Sam Adams commercials played on the TV at the restaurant in the time I drank this one beer, hence the shameless slogan plugs in my review. They seem to have really done a good job of balancing the quality of their product with the creativeness of advertising campaigns. Not to turn this into a anti-corporate thing, but this, in my opinion, is a great model for growing the accessibility of a great product while at the same time maintaining its integrity and not compromising the basic qualities which make it a great product. Cheers to Jim Koch and the Boston Beer Company!"
"D - Quite high, the taste is great and the body is on the lighter side meaning a very drinkable beer."
"Overall - Tasty beer that I have enjoyed my share of. Probably one of the best beers out there to get people adjusted to the bitterness of most American beers."
"with just about any heavy meal and since it's a macro, you'll be able to get it at most good resturants."
"Notes - This bottle is near its May 2010 freshness date so the flavors might be a little dulled because of it."
"Everything works together well. It's sweet at times but mostly packs a bitter hoppy punch. Very drinkable; also readily available."
"Serving type bottle"
"As it warms up, the bitterness is less pronounced and blends better with the malt flavor. Overall, a nice session beer."
"Drinkability - Honestly one of my favorite ""go to"" beers. I can drink this during any season and with just about any hearty meal."
"Pours a crisp, clear amber gold with a light white head that disappears quickly, ringing the glass and leaving no lacing. The aroma is a sweet maltiness with a light bitter hop and a nutty undertone. The beer itself primarily tastes of the malt, with a rich breadiness and a crisp finish with light to no apparent bitterness. Bubbles bite on the tongue, which makes this beer only slightly tougher than water to go down the hatch... Not fantastic, just better than BMC and enjoyable."
"D- Fairly easy to drink, not the best beer ever but one of the better macros I have had."
"Thoughts: i like this beer for some parties and gatherings, and is good with food."
"Final Thoughts - Boston Lager is a pretty decent brew, though its not the best lager out there. If friends or family offer one, I wont put the offer down. You just wont find it offered at my place."
"D - Very easy to drink casually. Great session beer as it is complex and refreshing, yet doesn't get you too drunk and won't fill you up too quickly."
"Very drinkable. One you can stick to all night."
"O: Excellent drinkability. A simple but extremely refreshing beer. Excellent session beer"
"D: This beer is pretty easy to drink, well-balanced and has lots more character than most macros. Honestly one of the better lagers I've had, but I'm still not a big fan of hop-dominated beer."
"D- Well it's easy drinking in a Miller Lite kind of way. This is not the beer that I've had on numerous occasions before. I'm not sure if it's a mix-up, a bad batch or if this is is the Coastal Wheat in the wrong bottle. I got this in the Holiday pack so I have one more, hopefully that one's okay. I will re-review if it is. Very disappointing. 2.0"
"D: Very drinkable. After all, there's almost nothing there."
"Smooth, easy drinking with light to medium body."
"Everything about this beer is real good. I've enjoyed these for a while, I believe that it may in the running for on of the top five greatest flagship brews of any brewery. That being said, I intend to celebrate the 25th anniversary of its brews revival, (the original recipe dates back to the late 1870s) from bombers on several more occasions, so further elaboration of this review will subsequently take place. Its appearance grand, pleasing to the eye, a faint amber, bubbly, with good white head, just like sea foam from the shore. It smells fine, slightly hoppy, nothing overbearing, almost sweet, very good. And the taste oh, how crisp and refreshing, its what defines a lager. The mouthfeel, crisp, that drinkability above and beyond. Great choice from a bottle, always a fine option on tap, you really cannot go wrong with this fellow, its a stand by fine fine choice."
"Overall: Probably the best easy-to-find micro that's marketed as a macro. Nice choice for a classy party. Thumbs up."
"The mouthfeel is full of carbonation, and isn't overly thick. This goes down fairly easy, and is something that goes well with fairly any kind of food. Something that is great to go to when you're out, as it's not too high priced, but something that is so much better than any BMC could ever offer."
"Beer has a nice amber color with good head and carbonation. The aroma is good clean beer, nothing fancy. The taste has a sweetness & crisp and finishes with a slight bitterness. This beer is very refreshing and a good beer of the realm to measure others by."
"Drinkability - This beer is superb because it is more than the sum of its parts, which from the description is just basic beer ingredients with no gimmicky additives. It really does a lot with the basic beer flavors and mixes them extremely well in a package that is widely available at a fair price. It is the definition of a solid, straight beer in my opinion."
"D - Solid lager, well balanced, very sessionable."
"D: drinkability is good nice to have with a hot dog in the summer at a baseball game or even in the winter at a football game with a nice brat"
"D - This is a beer for Americans to be proud of. I wish every BMC drinker would convert to this or Yuengling, and get them off the Belgian or South African swill (AB-InBev or SAB-Miller)"
"D: just a really nice, easy drinking beer"
"Poured an amber color with a white head, which quickly dissipated. Lots of bubbles were visible and were able to keep a very thin head throughout the beer's life. The smell of the beer is that of malts and even a bit of hops. The initial taste of the beer was malts and hops. The finish of the beer was not as expected, there was a wheaty after taste which I wasn't too pleased with, but none the less worked well with the beer. An additional note to add is that there was lots of carbonation."
"D- I think these get a little thick after the second one so that is usually my limit. A good, refreshing beer from Sam Adam's."
"D: An exceptional lager, easy on the palate and on the wallet. Really a nice choice on any occasion, and readily available."
"Served up brownish amber with a nice head that has good retention and leaves great lacing. The smell is malty with plenty of caramel and toffee as well as grassy hops. The taste is wonderfully balanced. Malty overall but grassy herbal hops are definitely present. The malt character is wonderful with plenty of caramel, toffee and a nice toastyness. Medium, slightly chewy mouthfeel that finish a tad sticky, but not at all undesirable. Very drinkable and a welcome happy hour find to compliment my meal at a large chain restaurant."
"Notes: It´s a conflicted feeling not being a big fan of the style or typically of the brewery, but the beer itself is pretty decent, and the craft standard it has help to set deserves good respect. By now its own marketing and self-entitlement has grown a little bit out of proportion, but it remains a nice choice to have around, and while typically not mine it is still nice to see this quality brew ahead of macros on a menu."
"Drinkability is decent and I feel more than one would not be a problem."
"This is one of the best lagers I've had but its is a bit light for my taste, I really like a very heavy bitter beer and this falls a bit short."
"D- Big sips that are the size of gulps."
"Good for a lager, solid drinkable brew. I do much prefer their Boston Ale, however."
"One of the best lagers I have tasted...good sessions brew."
"Mouthfeel is ok. Could use a little more body. Drinkability is great and I applaud their quality on this grand scale."
"D- Not the kind of beer I would want to drink a lot of in one sitting as in no more than three or four 12 oz. servings."
"If you are ever trying to suggest craft beer to macro-heads, you probably can't do much better than Boston Lager as your gateway beer."
"Cheers!"
"This is an excellent session beer, fall back beer...hell even a favorite beer. It's available almost everywhere and goes down great."
"I have somehow managed to not have this iconic american brew until now. At least not to my memory, which has gone hazy on more than one occasion. I was quickly impressed with the appearance. Thick, dense head that was not at all weak and foamy like most of the lagers that are made here. Also laced pretty well which was a nice suprise. Clear copper in color. Smelled sweet of caramel malts and had a faint floral hop scent to it. Taste is perfectly balanced and true to style with a sweet front and a clean and slightly bitter finish. Mouthfeel is light and crisp. Very nice beer."
"Poured into a bottle this beer had a full head, and completely laced the glass. This beer looks alive and delicious. It has a fairly hoppy smell, but the taste is more balanced. I especially liked how easy this beer goes down, it is not watery or over carbonated. Just right. Overall a very drinkable beer, I would gladly have another."
"Pours a straight clear copper with a finger of frothy off-white head that laces quite well. The smell is a nicely balanced mixture of citrus, pine, and toffee. The taste holds a hoppy bitterness, malty sweetness, and a light dose of creamy caramel. The body is lightly moderate, and the somewhat heavy carbonation keeps the smoothness from achieving its full potential. Overall, a nice, tasty, drinkable brew."
"Boston Lager has been one of my go to beers at many establishments and is a solid choice anytime."
"Value: For a gas station beer, this one is pretty hard to beat."
"Drinkability: 4.75 = perfect ABV to drink all night or at a sporting event or elsewhere."
"darker in appearance than expected. off white, quickly dissipating head. good lace. sweet hops to the nose, but still very faint. caramel malt back throughout. the caramel notes in this beer are the most pleasing thing. light biscuit and pleasant light breadiness. light body but not too bad. you can taste the higher quality ingredient compared to almost all other american lagers."
"other notes: became one of my faves as soon as i tried it, i saw the comercials and blew it off till i tried it out of no where. I would like to point out the awsome balance between sweet and bitter, thats what really does it for me"
"D: Still probably my favorite lager. Great for a quiet evening."
" but I think I'll have another before going back out to tend the chickens."
"thats it"
"Overall I have always wanted to like this beer, but it just isn't to my palate's agreement. It's bottled almost everywhere which is nice, but this is just not one of my fav's from Sam Adams."
"This is a solid beer, one that is a ""go to"" for me. A great beer to introduce friends to when they need to expand their horizons."
"D-a very drinkable brew it is nice and full and complex yet is very refreshing and can easily be drank all night"
"O: Easy to find, easy to drink, and reasonably priced. The availability of Boston Lager will most likely save your night at some point in the future."
"The smell is malty and also gives off some floral. Comes with a nice bit of head, and a deep amber/brown color. Tastes great with the malt and even a bit of citrus coming into this one. I will go to this beer when all else fails. Easily drinkable and if you've never actually tried the boston lager you need to."
"Notes: Nothing flashy about this, but like a lot of things from Sam Adams it is a solid beer."
"I was really surprised with this one. I'm not a big fan of lagers, and was expecting much the same from this. I was surprised, and then very pleased. It pours a yellow gold, with a nice fluffy white head. The smell is much what you'd expect, but with a hint of spice. The taste is much more that I expected. I figured it would be a typical lager, and the lager is there, but add some nice hops, a hint of spice, and much more complexity than you'd ever expect out of something like this. Mouthfeel is just what it should be, and I could drink these all evening if I didn't have stuff to do tomorrow. Well done Boston."
"The body is fairly substantial for the style. Medium carbonation and heft combine for a nice creamy mouthfeel. I'm not a huge Vienna fan, but overall a solid offering from one of America's pioneer craft brewers."
"RJT"
"D: Definitley a re-drinker a very good session beer all around good everyday beer."
"Serving type: bottle"
"I must say this is a full body lager. It pours to an amber color with enough carbonation to leave a bite. It has a nice smell not overpowering of anything. The taste now that is quite interesting it has a fruity taste with quite the bite of hops. The mouth feel is heavy but it goes down smooth for a nice drinkability!!!"
"...Well being canadian I never thought Id like this beer so much. This is only the 3rd time Ive had it since its not really popular here and my opinion of it improves with each sampling."
"D - Overall DAMN it is better than I remember. Smooth and drinkable this is the lovechild of their brewery. Very nice."
"Nice malty flavor with an underlying sweetness. Hops are more noticable in the flavor than in the aroma, not overly hoppy, but definately noticable. Medium body, adequate carbination, easy to drink."
"Drinkability is perfect."
"D- Surprisingly drinkable, much better than any BMC offering,"
"Overall, I really enjoy this bier. It is a good american craft bier that can hang with our imported brethren. I recommend it. Prosit!"
"body is medium to full"
"This is a great Vienna Lager."
"D: A good classic standby. Suberbly done - sort of an extra hoppy Vienna. Perhaps the quintessential ""gateway"" beer proselytizing the good brews."
"A beer I have had many times over the years in many formats, but it is rarely ever a beer I reach for or think of due to its ubiquity. Very drinkable, and definitely a solid brew, though nothing special. It's a beer I only tend to go for in a pinch."
"An average brew should you face a desperate situation where you are in the middle of nowhere but they still have a Sammy."
"Poured a clear light amber into a 1987 Bud-Light Spuds Mackenzie pilsner glass, 2 finger head with good sticky retention, frosty looking and some wild carbonation going on here. Smells so very toasty, caramel sweet and hoppy. Tastes toasty malt, and hops, got a faint hint of caramel but not pronounced. Very well balanced and only slightly bitter that is enjoyable, really diggn' the smoothness of this blend of simple flavor. A good medium mouthfeel to this with the prefect amount of carbonation, i didnt know this was a 'vienna lager' before, but this is just a good beer. Ive had Boston Lager several times but this is the first time i really sat down to enjoy it and review, i realized there was alot i was missing out on. It seems though to be so hit or miss with the bottled version anyway, sometimes its spot on other times its very off. Either way ill be getting this again, highly drinkable, i already want another and i havent completely finished this glass yet. Sessionable."
"D: This is a beer that I will most definitely drink again."
"Overall, I'd highly recommend this as a session beer. It stands up well against other beers, and has a comparable ABV for long nights. The flavor and aroma are nice and warming, but it's got a refreshing aspect that would work well in summer heat. This is definitely an all-year beer."
"Drinkability - I will have another & another & another..."
"You will not ponder this beer like you would a big stout, but it's at the top of it's class in lager. A super star in the world of beers. A classic."
"Overall, Boston Lager is a very respectable beer. It's a good selection if I'm out and cannot find a new beer to try. It has enough positive qualities to put it way ahead of the mass produced, watered down macros that dominate the beer scene."
"D: Pleasant lager, but nothing special or worthwhile IMO. It's very expensive for what you get."
"D: Goes down smooth, everything about this beer is great."
"Tasted in a sunset of january 2009. Look: Reflects a dark amber and opaque color, creamy head with two fingers thick, good lacing; Smell: Predoimantes biscuity malt, some hops with citrus notes; Taste: Very similar, biscuity malt with floral-citrus hops; Mouthfeel: Refreshing, sweet bitterness, medium body, high carbonation; Drinkability: I enjoyed seeing the sun getting on the horizon as i drank the beer."
"Drinkability- Would make a wonderful session beer. Nothing too complex but in general a well done lager."
"Drinkability/Overall - For a macro, this is really great. A very easy drinking beer."
"D. Well I finished a 15.5 gallon keg without much help so pretty drinkable."
"Notes: It's somewhat uncommon for a brewery's flagship beer to be one of their best offerings, but that's definitely the case with Boston Lager. In fact, Boston Lager might be my favorite Sam Adams beer. I here that this beer is sublime straight from the brewery, so I make it my mission to visit someday."
"Pours very light brownish-orange with a head that starts out big white and fluffy, turns into a small layer that sits on top the whole time leaving decent lacing. Not too much for the smell here, oats, malts, a little bit of light fruit..maybe orange. Taste is smooth and malty, bready and light fruit (apricot comes to mind). A little metallic tasting at times but seemingly random. Tastes a bit like a macro, but a big step above that. Mouthfeel is okay, refreshing, high amount of carbonation. Obviously not the most exciting beer in the world, but always a pleasure to drink for me. One of the best choices if you're looking for a beer you can find in basically every bar. A nice session beer."
"But what I didn't count on was really liking this beer. I don't mean I think it is ok but I think it is great. Lager or no lager I have to rank this up there. My apologies to Jim Koch. He made a great brew."
"Very clear light brown without much head, but plenty of carbonation. Sweet malty aroma with just a hint of earthy hop smell. The taste is maltier than I expected with the aforementioned hop taste present as well. Slightly flatter than I'd like, and not as easy to drink as a macro-style light lager. Way more flavorful though. Most reminds me of a Yuengling traditional lager as opposed to a Great Lakes Elliot Ness. I feel like if I were drinking it at normal macro tap temp (33 degrees) then it would be an easier to drink."
"I could only drink a lot of these if they were cheaper. This beer is sour and watery despite its nice color and I can't say it's much better than any pale American macro lager. I was disappointed."
"Drinkability - this one is not hard to drink. Not sure if I'd have more just because...I think i'd rather have a SN, but this would be my go to choice at a resturant if nothing else is available."
"A very solid lager that goes well with a number of foods or just as a tasty session beer. A good standby for restaurants."
"Overall, I have enjoyed this beer the very few times I have drank it. I can't imagine what it would have been like to try this beer when it originally was released, I'm sure it would have been mind blowing at the time. Thank you Jim Koch for giving us this beer and helping to change beer in America forever."
"Drinkibility is OK but I would prefer more flavour and a bit of tartness. I can't speak to the specific style though."
"D: Refreshing, snappy hop finish, goes well with food. this is not a beer to savor. I would never drink more than 2."
"Cheers!"
"It is my beer of choice when I go to restaurants that do not seem to have a selection of craft beers. It has a thick and frothy off white almost tan head with a nice amount of staying power and lace. The body is red amber with a slight yellow color to it. The aroma is that of mild hops and bread. It has breakfast cereal like grainy taste. A high quality malt flavored beer with just the right amount of hops. The mouthfeel is medium with moderate carbonation."
"This is a well crafted beer with a very stong hop taste to it. The 1 inch head and the the nice yellow coloring makes the beer very appealing to the eyes, the first sip is the best along with strong aroma that makes this beer very good. i recommend this beer for something tasty and able to enjoy when your out with your buddies."
"when poured, it has a amber color with a slight golden hue and a stable cream colored head that's stable throughout the drink. Aroma is a little weak, but smells of malts. Taste initially like sweet bready malts, but the hops start to kick in after it goes down. Not too thick or too thin like other American lagers and a tiny bit of carbonation. Overall a good beer for any occasion that's practically on any menu or at any bar."
"A classic American craft beer that can still hold its own and the fact that it's so widely available is nice."
"d: Very nice lager, I'm glad it is so widely available."
"D: Yeah this one i could drink all day no problem. Sure it holds a very special place in my heart but in a pinch this is a great go to beer"
"Overall/notes: I've had quite few of these over the years, and there's a good reason. Boston Lager is one of the better lagers available, and the fact that it's so readily available boosts its reputation. It's one of those beers that you can turn to year-round and never really frown about, and more than likely one of the best options at a sports bar."
"D: SA BL is a very drinkable and full flavored lager, It is a great option for the times when only macro adjunct lagers are available as Boston Lager is typically one of the ""import"" selections. It is enjoyable but not a standby for me."
"not too much head on this beer, but the colour stays the same. the only real notable character that changes is the toasted or roasty aspect to the malts, which becomes a bit more predominant in the role of the taste. all in all the hop levels and drinkability stay the same, and continue to make a good cheap beer to go with a burger."
"Boston Lager is a great on-tap beer. It's a beautiful amber color and has a decent head. As always, Sam Adams doesn't fail in the flavor department. Boston Lager has a great taste, but isn't too heavy either. Definitely a solid brew that all beer lovers should try."
"D: I have not come across too many beers that I enjoy returning to again and again like this one. You just can't go wrong with this beer. Complements all kinds of food very well. Extremely versatile."
"D: easier than what its marketed to compete with."
"D- Simply a great session beer."
"The smell and flavor were sweet and malty but balanced by more bitterness than usual for a lager, which provided a thick bready feel. I prefer the Boston Ale and was disappointed that the Lager was included in the Winter Sampler; however, as Lagers go, Sam Adams is great. It's a great choice at restaurants that don't have a wide selection of craft beers and it was an unexpected pleasure on a cold afternoon."
"Its a nice fall back when we go out to eat and my only other options are BMCs."
"D: Good - could definitely session a few of these."
"I can see how this is the biggest-selling craft beer in America. There are enough similarities to macro and micro to keep everyone happy. Good to see a flavourful beer gain so much popularity. Very drinkable, an easy session choice."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a good hoppy, slightly dry finish. Pretty drinkable and I easily finished a 6 pack just the other night."
"D: I could drink this regularly. Good vienna lager."
"D: There are many other six-packs I would rather pick up instead of this one. However, this beer is not horrible, and was in fact better than I expected. I really liked the smell, and was impressed with the glass. It is very comfortable in the hand and the lip on the rim makes this glass very pleasing to drink from. It won't replace my tulip, but it's great to drink beers like this from."
"MD- This is a very drinkable beer. I hadn't had it for a long time until the winter sampler pack. I will drink it again."
"Poured into a shaker pint. Beautiful medium amber color with a nice creamy head and good lacing. Very nicely balanced. I guess you would call this the king of beers when talking craft brewing. This is all over the place and not a bad go to beer at the bar. I don't buy this beer by itself too much for the simple reason of been there done that so I am glad they include it in some of their sampler packs just to remind me."
"Great Beer, and very easy to find. Sam Adams Boston Lager is there signature beer. It has a great taste and great flavor to it. A little more hoppeir then most lagers, but that is something I wouldnt complain about. Had a nice golden color to it, and is one of their lighter beers, even though by no means is it a light beer."
"The appearance is a golden color with about 1/3 inch of white foamy head that faded to a nice ringed lace around the glass. Have a very strong aroma of hops but is nice and inviting. Great tasting lager with a little bitter flavor that lingers on the back of the tongue. Leaves a nice after taste in the mouth. A very drinkable beer. I really like this beer and would recommend this beer to anybody who is a lager fan."
"Quite a light beer,dont feel the alcohal burning in the body very much,very smooth going down the throat,very drinkable,but buying this beer in my country cost ard 5 USD while a Duvel cost around 3 USD which are you gonna get?"
"I recently came across a Sam Adams lager glass, so I felt it was my duty to grab some Boston Lager and do a review. It's been quite some time since I've had this. Way back, Boston Ale was pretty available and I always preferred it to the lager. I am, after all, an ale man. I also don't like that this is the defacto ""craft beer"" at many places. However, don't let that detract from this beer. It's good. Pours a clear amber. Mix of floral hops and toasted bready malts. Taste is much of the same. It's good and sessionable with the low ABV. It's a good Vienna Lager, but I'm spoiled on Eliot Ness."
"This is a beer that I like to come back to over and over. Has a good dark red color and always pours nicely into the perfect pint glass. Has a nice strong taste to it but it doesn't seem overpowering in the least bit. You can sit down and drink a couple of these and not need to switch it up due to the flavor."
" ~ This is a good brew. I'm always happy to enjoy a Sam Adams Boston Lager. They know what they're doin' at the Boston Beer Company."
"Poured out a fresh bottle into one of the new-fangled Boston Lager glass. Actually a very cool glass that makes an intentionally bad pour come out perfectly. As nearly always, Sam Adams does a great job."
"I don't know much about beers and ales but just what I like,And Sams Boston lager is dam good beer.I give it an A"
"Aroma is thin and mostly malty, the hop aroma is very grassy. The flavor is as expected, mostly malt little hops. Very clean. Good session beer, easy drinking."
"Overall a very nice and drinkable beer."
"Overall a great go-to beer. Available at nearly any bar nationwide I really can't ask more of Sam Adams."
"D: Excellent. A great session beer that goes down easy. Drinks easy like a macro lager, but has the taste profile of a well made craft beer. BL is always a go to for me, especially when craft beers aren't to be found when I go out to eat or stop at the gas station."
"While nothing about this beer jumps out, it's very easy to drink and would go nicely with just about any kind of food."
"a great beer to have when your somewhere without a great beer selection because they'll usually have Boston Lager."
"This beer goes with just about anything, it's pleasant to drink, and it doesn't weigh you down. When I don't know what to order, I'll have a Sam Adams."
"Easy to drink, easy to session, easy to come back to. For lagers from American breweries, there really are few that can compare."
"The aroma is very malty with a little hoppiness. Its very sweet. Drinking it, it tastes pretty much exactly how it smells which is a good thing. Its very refreshing and very drinkable enough making it a good session beer but its still complex enough to make that session enjoyable."
"A solid beer, and very drinkable."
"Golden lager with a two finger off-white head and good lace and retention, transluscent. Smell is nothing to write home about, mostly lacking. Taste features a feint hop presence, nicely balanced in terms of bitterness with just enough malt to round it out. This is a nice everyday drinking lager with good retention, above average, especially for a mass marketed lager."
"Poured into a pint glass, left a 1/2"" off-white head, prefect sudsy lacing with every swallow. Smells like grains, kind of woody. Taste is very refreshing, very malty with a nice bitter bite. Mild carbonation. Drinkability is excellent. I think Sam Adams only tops themselves on this with their Oktoberfest."
"Overall, very refreshing and drinkable. Much more flavor than you would except from an American lager. Tastes a lot more like a pale ale than a lager to me. Jim Koch sure chose a solid brew to be the staple for Sam Adams."
"Would not mind trying this on tap to see any difference, the bottle seems to be a one and done for me as the malts seem to dissipate into the other ingredients not so well with warming. The smell was my favorite part while the liquid is bearable."
"(D)- Just a solid beer. Nothing fancy; no bells or whistles attached. Just a good drinking beer for when you want to put away a few."
"D: This is a nice refreshing lager, and I'm not really a big lager fan. There are good, strong flavors, which is great to see in a world full of adjunct lagers. I don't drink this beer as much anymore, but it is a good choice if you're at a restaurant without much of a beer list."
"Poured into a tumbler it has a small head with decent lacing. The appearance is clear amber. The aroma is of hops and little malt. The taste is sweetly malty with nice mild earthy hops and bitterness. The feel is full bodied for a lager with moderate carbonation. The finish is pretty clean. A very very drinkable lager."
"Drinkability: I'm amazed I'd never really tried this before. It's a great beer, very refreshing, and might become my go-to when I just want to kick back with a six pack."
"a good beer but ill only drink it if i have a glass around, otherwise ill most likely choose another drink"
"D - a go to for sessioning, or just wanting a beer to drink for almost any occasion. Drinkability is amazing."
"I feel like this is the ultimate sessionable lager...it's got a nice dose of hops, but not too much, so you could probably drink this beer indefinitely without getting tired of it. One of my favorite standbys."
"Still easy drinking, especially with pizza."
"Fist time I have tried this on tap. One of the better looking beers around in my opinion. Beauiful dark amber, completely clear, huge head with pretty lacing. Smell is sweet toasty malty, herbal-floral with some pine. Complex, sweet caramel malt with some toasted earthy notes and a nicely balanced dose of bitter spicy citrus from the hops. This is bottom line good beer. There is nothing unwelcomed or offensive. Nothing is there that is not supposed to be there. Clean, perfectly balanced. Goes with antyhing you are eating. There is a reason this is a clasic. There are better beers out there, but any beer lover can't dislike Boston Lager."
"O: I keep this in my fridge at all times. Equally respected by beer geeks and casual drinkers alike. Always a good decision."
"Overall, this would be a great beer to introduce someone into craft beers. Simple and flavorful yet not overpowering, and very well balanced. One of the best beers to have with a good hearty meal that I can think of."
"Tasting notes on top of the thousand+ existing reviews would be redundant, since I agree with what people seem to be saying. One note: this is *not* a complex beer."
"What can I say, Vienna Lagers are very drinkable just like their Marzen cousins and Sam Adams Boston Lager is no exception. In a way I'm glad I hadn't reviewed it before now, it was probably the first true craft beer I ever tasted and I didn't even know it at the time. I can actually appreciate it's quality and skill with which it is brewed now. Great with food or anytime!"
"Poured an amber color. Nose and taste is also of a sweet bread. This is a good lager that goes down smoothly and is enjoyable from first to last gulp.Nice ABV keeps drinkability up. One of the most popular lagers around for a reason. Not a fan of the style usually but this is always one Sam Adams brew I can drink anytime."
"Overall one of the better beers to come from the sam adams lineup. The style is nice and rounded and this beer sticks to that style."
"Overall: Wouldn't call myself a lager fan but if I had to choose one to go with this would be in. Its balanced, a bargain of a price, can hold its own against macro, and readily available at many places. Would be perfect on a hot day but did just the trick while passing some time on the barstool."
"A very easy drinking brew, I enjoyed 3 pints at this session, I can always count on the consistency of this beer."
"This review was missing after a server crash. Added back on 10/28."
"Cheer!!"
"Drinability is quite good. It goes down smooth and is a pretty tasty brew. I think it would make for a very nice session beer. Its not the most amazing of the style but it will always be welcome in my fridge."
"D - Very light and drinkable."
"This makes for a beer that has the freshness of a lager, but with some of the mellow taste and aroma of a pale ale. Therefore it is a drinkable and uncomplicated brew to enjoy."
"Pours a clear amber with a small off-white head. Aromas of sweet and toasty malts are very inviting. The roundness of its flavors is amazing. True to its advertising, this lager is mminently drinkable. It is a good beer for inspiring macro-lager fans to sample the micro-brew landscape."
"A great stepping stone beer."
"I absolutely love this beer. On tap in my game room, you can't beat this beer. Smell, heck, so good that it attacted my wife to marry me. Taste...there's hops and smooth lagering, what else could a beer drinker want? Mouthfeel, wonderful volume and hop notes tempered with malt that nothing else on the planet could compare in any lager. Drinkability....if you're a complete wuss then you'll hate this beer, otherwise you probably don't fear the robust hops and malt. This company makes the best mass produced beer on the planet, hands down. I love it and it's what's on tap!"
"cheers!"
"Just barely achieved the taste score above. Above average aroma, very piney and bitter with hop resin and grapefruit peel. Taste shows amber malt and c-hops. Nicely balanced and extremely drinkable for a well crafted beer. Not my first choice but a classic and a go-to on those late night when only gas stations are open. As is true for many others connoisseurs , this is the beer that got me started."
"Sam Adam's flagship beer is very drinkable, both on tap and from the bottle. It's very good when it's cold and also gets better as it warms and sits. Even though some people put this in the ""mass market"" class now, I think it's still a very good beer that's light, tasty and enjoyable. I still enjoy this brew after many years of drinking it."
"D-Very drinkable lager, but not one I will reach for often since there are plenty of better ales available."
"as with the oktoberfest had this one in a bottle at applebees ,,again nothing of interest on the beer card.. you can always depend on SA this Lager pored a deep copper color with anice head ...smell was more hops in this one than the marzen with a nice toasty malt smell..the taste was smooth and flavorful it had an initial hop hit with some floral fruity tastes with some roasted toffee and biscuity malty finish all in all a drinkable lager when nothing else is on the card.and really it is a good brew one that i dont mind drinking from time to time i enjoyed this one"
"D: Despite the make up it has a solid taste that goes down well and makes for good drinkability."
"You can get this brew for a pretty good price. It's the most common craft brew. If you have friends over and are low on cash, the cheapest GOOD beer, would be sam adams. It's a hoppy lager. You can smell the hops. As for drinkability, you could easily put a sixer down."
"12oz bottle and on tap. This is the stepping stone beer towards craft beer for me. I was obsessed with it for awhile. Solid beer over all. Pours a clear golden. Very smooth and easy to drink. Can't go wrong with this if the options are limited."
"D : Good and solid brew for easy drinking - I guess it is the quintessential macro - micro lager"
"Smooth and mellow mouth feel and flavor. The taste is sweet malts with a bitter edge that's just so well balanced, making this a very easy drinking lager. The cereal flavor is strong and reminds me of BCM, but in the way that BCM's are supposed to resemble something closer to this flavor, but don't, they only attempt, if you could call it that."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: It has a good crisp/clean taste that really finishes well. The beer is very refreshing and easy to enjoy. Not too heavy and not too light."
"D- A very smooth a drinkable beer. A great go to beer."
"Sorry, Sam."
"Pourd into a glass. Beautiful amber gold color. 2 finger head, maybe more. pretty good lacing. Nice malty smell with some caramel and some notes of spices. Tastes a lot like it smells, nice caramel taste as it goes down. Nice and hoppy too. This is a great beer, one of my favorites."
"For a mass-market lager, I would say it is about the best you can hope for."
"Taste largely follows the smell, but with an unexpected caramel sweetness in the aftertaste that eventually resolves into more hop bitterness. Quite complex, especially for a mass-market lager. Mouthfeel is a little bit thicker and stickier than your average lager, almost approaching what I'd expect in a porter, but not cloying. The character of this one really changes with temperature - the sweet notes come out substantially more as the beer warms. At colder temperatures, it seems more like just a hoppy lager."
"D - good taste with a solid feel makes this beer go down quite well."
"I've had this one many times, but it has been quite some time since I have indulged. Pours light orange or dark golden color with a lofty two-finger head. Good retention and also a nice amount of lacing. Carbonation looks high. Nose has a some nice fruity sugars to it, white grapes, mildly citric hopping. Actually much sweeter and fruitier smelling than I seemed to recall. Flavor has the same white grape sweetness with some toasted malts thrown into the mix on the midpalate. Lightly grassy hops and a mild floral finish. Maybe a bit simple for a lot of BAs, but all in all I feel this is an extremely solid brew. Probably more interesting than the ubiquitous ""amber ale"" I see at so many microbrewers Medium body with a nice medium carbonation that matches the crispness and light fruity flavors. Extremely solid, I actually will probably start to buy this when I am at places with a limited selection. Glad I revisited this, easy to see why Boston Brewing. Co. managed to claim the corporate throne in the non-BMC world."
"A deep amber and mahogany hue with a frothy white head that dissipates to a thin cap and leaves a surprisingly good deal of sticky lace behind. Aromas are caramel and toasted malt, metallic, and a mild spice. Flavors are similar, with a mouthfeel that is lighter bodied and crisp in carbonation. Well balanced, refreshing, and a beer that you can find at almost any non-craft friendly location. I will never get sick of Sam Adams!"
"D - very drinkable, good session beer."
"I will buy more."
"D: Very high, much higher than in most macro lagers. What an amazing vienna lager!"
"This is a beer that every beer lover should enjoy as it's very readily available. When all other crafts are not around, I happily order a Boston Lager and enjoy it. This is a staple in the beer industry and one we should continually celebrate as it never disappoints. Kudos to Jim Koch."
"Notes: Most of us have had this and we know if we like it or not. I do. A standard for sunday football."
"Good brew to say the least."
"All in all, one of the better macrobrewery beers. It's usually one of the only decent beers available at restaurants."
"Drinkability: For $2.99 at a large public gathering, and the same price they would have charged for a BMC, very reasonable. I've never had it this good out of the bottle, but in this particular situation, price, and experience I would say this was the deal of the day."
"I good day-to-day beer, however very expensive here in Quebec."
"Bottle to a tulip glass. This was a great beer. It made my taste buds sing. The apperance was an awsomecopper color, and the head stayed there for the whole beer. The smell was also good and it had a good body to it. The beer had a citrus taste to it. It was also bitter. A great overall beer!"
"Drinkability- It's pretty good. Definitely one of the better lagers. I will drink it again. Obviously it has to be pretty good. One of the biggest craft breweries there is"
"= not complex or dynamic or exciting in any way, just a solid lager here."
"D- A very drinkable beer and a very solid lager. Much better than many of the macro lagers that are on the market today."
"Drinkability is just about as high as it gets. SA Boston Lager is almost always available and goes down so easy that it might as well be a $5 whore. At only $2 more per case than BL Lime, there's no excuse not to keep this stuff in the fridge. Having just recently gotten glossy cases in-store, this has become my stock beer. I can say that -- without a doubt -- this is my favorite SA beer. I know that the company might not get a fair shake around here all the time, but they produce quality beer."
"pours a hazy golden color with a finger width of head. some lacing on sides of glass. nose is mostly hop aroma, with the maltiness taking a back seat. taste is smooth with a nice bitterness that hits the back of the tongue to balance out the sweetness. some bitter grapefruit flavors. mouthfeel is well carbonated, ,kind sticks a bit to mouth, coating it a bit. drinkability is there with this one. seems to be one of those beers that i always pass up on, but sampling this reminds that i should drink more of it."
"Would definitely drink this again, a great beer for when non-BAs come over, drink it all night on the patio while BBQing."
"Poured a crystal clear amber with a respectable head that faded quickly to a collar. There is not much of an aroma, I got a vague lager smell. Malty sweetness and a caramel flavor. Mouth feel was light bodied with a adequate carbonation. Very drinkable, this would make a good session beer. Solid effort, comes in second to GL Eliot Ness in it's class."
"Like the Märzen/Oktoberfest beers that popularized the style, Vienna Lagers make excellent fall-time drinks. Their crisp hop bitterness and nearly limitless quaffability make them great candidates for those still considerably warm autumn days while the reddish-brown colour, the more flavourful maltiness and filling body make them also well suited to the cooler nights that inevitably follow."
"D - This beer has it all as far as balance and appeal to the masses. No aspect of the beer is overpowering and combined as they are they make for a solid beer that can be enjoyed for a night rather easily."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has an amber color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of caramel malts. Taste is good, well balanced hops and malts, a bit of caramel.Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has decent drinkability. Overall I'd say that this is a good quality beer."
"Drinkability: A solid brew. Nothing outstanding but something that I will turn to from time to time. A great session beer."
"Drinkability is great. This is a fine session beer for me, loads of flavor without being heavy. I don't remember it being this good the last time I had it, maybe it came from a different brewery or was fresher. Worth buying by the case."
"D: Ussually great, not this one."
"Mouthfeel is perfect with the beer. Not thick but not think, a nice balance and I would say that sums up the beer. Wonderfully balanced."
"Pours a clear orange initially with a 3/4 finger head of white foam that dissolves fairly fast. Leaves quite a bit of lacing on the glass. Carbination is tingly and mouthfeel is medium to light. Nose is slightly hoppy as well as the taste. More hops are in the taste than what I am use to in a lager...nice. Finish is very crisp, mildly bitter. I am picking up a bit on diacetyl as well which is a fault but it is not distracting. Overall a good beer, nothing super exciting but this sample seems to be lacking some of the hop character that I had with other bottles...perhaps this one has been sitting around too long."
"M/D - Very rich mouthfeel for a lager, it makes up for the weakness of most lagers. The drinkability is good because it isn't complex enough that you'll mind putting down a session of them, but there is a lot for when you just want a beer over some paperwork or something."
"D: What with the modest alcohol this will be very drinkable. I would Definitely want another."
"D - A reliable and widely available beer that's a good option when nothing better is offered. It also makes a good starter for a BMC drinker looking to make the switch."
"Drinkability: excellent, a wonderful session beer."
"This beer is crisp with a big malty and bready backbone that make for great drinkability and a pretty solid beer through and through."
"This is a beer that I would drink at my local bar, and enjoy with a good meal. It is also a good beer to start off with when exploring dark beers."
"Drinkability is excellent, and I imagine a lager lover would drink this 'til the snowflakes fly, perhaps longer."
"I categorize this as an escape hatch, much like beer from New Belgium: I'll drink it when the alternatives are Bud, Miller and the like, but it's not a beer I'd seek out for any other reason."
"Taste largely follows the smell, but with an unexpected caramel sweetness in the aftertaste that eventually resolves into more hop bitterness. Quite complex, especially for a mass-market lager. Mouthfeel is a little bit thicker and stickier than your average lager, almost approaching what I'd expect in a porter, but not cloying. The character of this one really changes with temperature - the sweet notes come out substantially more as the beer warms. At colder temperatures, it seems more like just a hoppy lager. At any rate, a classic."
"D: A pretty drinkable beer for the style, not a bad bar beer."
"Very nice creamy mouthfeel with just the right amount of carbonation, and a highly drinkable lager!"
"Taste: The malty sweetness is present at first and then fades into a nice hoppy bitterness pretty quickly which remains a good amount of time after. Very nice flavor."
"D - very drinkable, good session beer."
"Nice satisfying lager. Great availability which makes this a nice go to when there is a lack of micros. My brother actually loves this stuff and is a BMC drinker. This would make a good introductory beer for the regular BMC person."
"On another note, the glass really does change things. Boston Lager was the first craft beer I ever had. I remember that fruity bitterness that was unlike anything I ever had. However, with this glass, it is a different beer.(In a good way)"
"Summary- Its a great beer for just kicking around and when there is nothing else at bars."
"D: very nice for a lager."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Freshness date on bottle is Nov 09. Appearance is brown full of carbonation with a nice thick head. Smell is very hoppy. Taste of this fresh brew is very well balanced with up front hoppy flavors and malty overtones balance the flavor. Mouthfeel is great and so is the drinkableness. I could have several of these and enjoy them."
"D - very drinkable. Excellent session beer"
"Caramel malt shines through, but doesn't overpower or make this beer cloying. Overall a very enjoyable, and refreshing session beer."
"D: I would consider this beer very drinkable, considering I drank my whole beer over the course of this review. Under 5 a.b.v makes it sessionable and perfect for hot days and hot dogs."
"A moderate amount of carbonation and a medium body. Fuller than you would expect. The drinkability is the best thing this beer has going. Always consistent and there for you when you need it in a pinch."
"M&D-Medium body and pretty straightforward. Very easy to drink and session can have more than a few and feel great about it overall just a great beer to keep around"
"D- Drinks good but could use some alcohol content to add to the color."
"app. is a clear amber , that keeps foam around the ring of the glass. smells bready , I smell malt and a little bit of a sulfur note, Tastes like it smells for the most part wheat , barely ,sweet malt. reletively light mouthfeel and a smooth drinker , not really leaving a dry finish , but not a wet one , right in the middle , not bad sam , not bad"
"Certainly a no-brainer session beer, a safe choice if nothing else is available. Easy to drink and unoffensive, but not overwhelmingly remarkable in any way."
"D: This is a classic Vienna Lager, tasty, smooth and goes down easy. A crowd pleaser to be sure..."
"This brew is a nice lager - a great party pleaser. Very drinkable."
"It's a good beer. Refreshing, flavorful, and it's got a little weight to it as well. Again, this brew is a step above the rest."
"Drinkability: I love this beer. I could drink it everyday."
"D- I know others have said it but crisp is really the word that comes to mind for this one. Very easy to drink, and perfect on a hot day. My first Sam Adams brew and cant wait to try more!"
"Serves a nice deep healthy copper with a professionally tight head that doesn't fall down too much as it laces down the glass with each subsequent sip. Smell is earthy, citrusy, malty and clean. Taste is crisp, clean, tinny, empty, malty, and simple. Mouthfeel is a little watery, and drinkability is good."
"There are few things in life that I appreciate more than a fresh Sam Adams Boston Lager. I consider this my stand by and have certainly had this beer more times than I have had any other beer. I've enjoyed it for so long both on tap and bottle but never taken the time to review it and finally took the time to do it tonight. Had it poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass, pours a light amber color with a decent sized head that will go away after a few minutes in the middle but sticks around on the edges with some good lacing to it as well. Oh yeah, and perfect clarity, absolutely perfectly filtered. It smells very good, very well balanced between roasted, caramelized malts and, with great hoppy floral aromas at the end. Excellent full bodied, and perfectly balanced flavor of again the malts followed by a hop aftertaste. Mouthfeel is good not much of a carbonation bite to it. You can really taste the sweet in the beginning and the bitter part at the end. Its full bodied, but I still find it very drinkable. Just a good overall beer. I'll put a disclaimer on this, it said drink by 11/09 and it's July right now, so you know this beer was EXTREMELY fresh. Glad I got a hold of it before anyone else. One more thing I have to add about this beer, is it's a great year round beer, great in all seasons."
"D- Well balanced interesting flavour profile, including a bigger floral hop note compared to most lagers. A refreshing carbonation and mouthfeel makes this a very sessionable lager"
"Drinkability: as a well-made lager, this one goes down easy, glass after glass. It's a hot evening here, and I think I may just have another."
"Drinkability - Extremely drinkable. This is the brew that got me into craft beer. I thoroughly enjoy this beer!"
"D: very drinkable beer, solid year round choice. For the money, one of America's better beers."
"O- Pretty good beer. Wouldn't mind keeping some in the fridge year round."
"Overall this is a very drinkable beer. I would consider it a go to session beer."
"Low abv, delicious beer, not offensive in any way. This is a beer that is not going to turn a lot of heads for being overly unique, but it's got a hell of a balance and is just a well crafted beer in general. Sessionable without a doubt."
"I almost forgot how awesome of a beer this is! Definitely one of the best and just about always on tap when nothing else is."
"The label says it best: ""America's World Class Beer."" To me, this is the standard by which I judge not just Samuel Adams beers, but a great many others. As I said earlier, it embodies the ""less is more"" philosophy. The hoppiness is by far the most unique aspect of this beer. Its composition and balance just add to the overall ambience, if you will. This is an excellent beer that can be enjoyed in any situation. It stands well on its own, but also goes well with damn near any type of food. This beer is a must-try for novices, enthusiasts, and connoisseurs alike."
"D: Good beer, one of my favorite lagers, I really enjoy it."
"poured into a sam adams glass,how cool! haha,poured with a nice fluffy head that dissipated after awhile.smell is mostly malty sweetness,slightly nutty.palate is mostly malt sweetness,slightly fruity with a slight nutty taste.nice citrus hop finish.overall an easy but enjoyable beer to drink."
"Pours a dark rich copper color that is transparent and has a nice two finger head which gives way to some really good lacing. The aroma is of hops and grain. The taste is hops and roasted malts. The taste is crisp and very flavorful. The mouthfeel is good there is a moderate amount of carbonation. The overall drinkability is very high. This is a solid solid beer that can be enjoyed over and over. This is the flagship of my beer drinking."
"D: Good lager to pick up in a case for a party in lieu of your standard lighter lager beers"
"The lager thinness carries the day, letting the noble hops shine all throughout the drink. At such a low ABV and with a decently high amount of flavor, one can definitely session this beer. I myself would rather pick up a locally-brewed beer to session (for me: the similarly-flavored Boulevard Pilsner or another Boulevard year-round product) but this should do quite nicely for many people as an accessible, go-to lager."
"Enjoy, and if it's your first foray to Sam, stay with this and not the Light."
"notes: love the appearance of this beer, its almost perfect! enjoy take it slow let it warm. this beer was recommended by a friend and its good, but not great. I would say that it is better then most common beers on the market. could see myself buying this beer at a bar in the future."
"22 oz bomber poured into the Samuel Adams Boston Lager glass. Lager obtained at Shaw's Supermarket Derry, NH. Crystal clear amber color with and a nice inch think head that leaves some lacing. citrusy smell with a subtle cracker-like quality. Nice citrusy taste. The cracker taste from the malt goes nicely with the citrus, bringing some lemon taste but very subtle. moderate to light carbonation. very refreshing beer."
"I nicely flavoured, tasty lager which hits the spot when you want something that isn't particularly challenging."
"This is a great lager, it has alot of flavor without being overpowering. I like how it starts off sweet and then the aftertaste has some more hops bitterness to it. Its nice and crisp. I could drink this all night. Its not perfect, but for a widely available beer that easy to drink and taste good, it hard to go wrong with this."
"Drinkability: Still prefer the Brooklyn lager even if it is a bit too sweet. (although thanks to beer advocate I have been informed this a vienna lager, so maybe I cannot compare the two) Too dry to have several, but not flavorful enough to want to have several. An average lager. Perhaps the commericials are truthful enough to say it would go with any kind of meal because it in no way overpower any flavor because the flavor is lacking."
"This beer pours a golden amber colour with a thick head that dissapears quite quickly, on smelling this beer the hops is the stand out smell with carmel/maltish background and with with the taste it is very fruity with a nice hop finsih but no bitterness at all quite smooth actually and could see myself drinking more of this beer definately a session beer"
"The foam was light wheat in color, semi-thick and very lacey. The color was a beautiful amber with mahogany highlights, not too much carbonation. The smell was a good balance of hops and wheat (more hops), a tad of orange with a slight bitterness. The taste was semi-robust of hops and spices -a heaviness to it. A cleaness of taste and a flowery undertone. Mouthfeel - medium-bodied and fresh. Drinkability - not too bitter, not too bland - a good session."
"D- Through the roof. I was wary of this beer, but it passes all tests. Very good macro? lager. If it's a choice between this and Bud/Coors/Miller, it's a no-brainer. Sam wins every time."
"D: This is great lager, and the beer that sent me on my craft brew journey. Well balanced and flavorful, I could drink these all day."
"S. Adams Boston Lager is a drinkable, enjoyable brew."
"I REALLY wanted to like this beer, but I came out a little disappointed and am willing to accept it. (Also, I don't know if it's just me but towards the end of the bottle, the aftertaste seems to get slightly better, but not to the point of serious drinkability)"
"D - Not quite sessionable, but I can have more than one in a sitting."
"d- very drinkable, this was my first boston lager, but definately not my last, very tasty."
"D: i can drink these all day with no problem"
"Prost!"
"Mouth is oily and slightly dry in the finish. Drinks all day long, and for a Mass produced beer, For the price (10.99 /12 pk) it isn't easily beat."
"The beer itself is amber with a decent head off the pour. It gives off a sweet aroma with a little hop. Taste is a pleasant balance of sweet malt and sharp hop flavor. Leaves a little dry; very refreshing. Strong carbonation but still smooth and not filling at all."
"As far as looks go, I have never saw a better bear. Perfect shade of gold with a head that is not too big or not too small. The head goes down not too slow or not too fast. Smells good. Maybe a little weak. The fruit smell is evident, but not to an extreme. Not impressed with the taste. Nothing stands out in the taste. A little after taste, but not too much. Goes down with little effort, but some effort is there. Verdict: try it."
"D: Very drinkable... it's obvious why this is SA's flagship beer. I can't see anyone not enjoying this one."
"Thank God for Jom Koch! It is because of his ambition to enhance American lagers to a state above mediocrity that Samuel Adam's Boston Lager is now ubiquitous. Quite simply you can always know that you have a beer that you can drink in nearly every Pub or Restaraunt from coast to coast. This brew never disappoints. It is best drunk from spring through autumn at a temperature between 40-45 degrees F. but unlike the big 3 and many other middle of the road lagers, it still tastes excellent even when it gets closer to room temperature, a rarity among any lager or pilsner. It has a pleasant hops aroma and maltiness is predominant in the flavor rich with caramel and vanilla tones. overall a solid inexpensive lager."
"A great example of a Vienna, and I would recommend it."
"Suprememly drinkable. A true micro classic. As reliable a brew as you can find - its ubiquitousness makes it a great go to any place any time. I've had many of there, and will have many more."
"Overall, it's a good warm weather beer. Unfortunatly, way to pricy (In Québec) for what you got. Would be a nice introduction beer for a session. Will seek something else for a by-the-pool-beer for this summer."
"D - Great standby beer. Easily drinkable and while nothing special, tasty."
"Used to be one of my favorite fallback beers, but I have gotten away from highly carbonated beers as of late. Still a very good beer!"
"D: Pretty drinkable except I am not a fan of the extra bitter aftertaste."
"Drinkability - a very good beer, also thirst quenching, even though it has plenty of flavour. All in all very positive."
"D: I'm not usually a fan of Sam Adams beers, but this is one I'll be going back to. Wonderfully drinkable and something you can just pick up and have a couple of; would serve as a great session beer."
"A good tasty balanced beer. Reminds me of an ESB, but just a little sweeter."
"I will be the first to say this rating may be a little one sided because this is arguably my favorite beer"
"Not my favorite but given the choice of BMC I'd go with it... and that is just because its not my favorite style..."
"D: Nice balance, and one of the lagers I prefer to drink. Delicious beer."
"Final Thoughts - I think this review serves this beer a bit better then the last one did. I'd still recommend it, but I was honestly surprised that this beer really didn't fare much better. I dunno, maybe if I got it fresh again it might fare better and make no mistake it's still a good beer but I think it will be some time before I pick this one up again."
"A really good lager. Highly drinkable."
"D- Easily the best available/easily accessible lager around. A great session beer and a great first step to drinking better."
"It's a little bit too wet for me to drink as a session beer, but it has plenty of well balanced flavour without being too challenging so it's a pretty easy beer to swig with a nice basic meal."
"Solid drinker, very above average lager that is smooth."
"Pours a deep gold. Very little head, and some thin lacing. Smells of thin malt and some floral hops. The malt profile isn't as pale as you'd expect. Theres some caramel flavors hiding in there. Maybe slightly biscuity? Sharp carbonation and a decent amount of bitter hops cleans the palate. Not a bad beer and its available almost everywhere."
"Drink is good a little too heavy for me today a little hot out. Maybe on a chillier night I could easily take a few more of these down."
"D - As sort of the craft version of the american macro, one could say this is where this beer really shines. Easy drinking on the palette, abv is manageable, and the flavors meld well."
"D- nice beer and not over powering with flavor.. i like this one"
"Pours a copper/bronze color that can easily be seen through. The head of the beer isn't substantial, but there was lace all the way down the pint glass I had it from. The Boston Lager certainly doesn't have the smoothest taste of any traditional lager, but it offers a flavor full of hops and a crisp, clean aftertaste. Like any beer, Sam Adams tastes much better on tap. This is a beer that I would reach for if I didn't want to drink anything fancy, but was still looking for a solid beer. Too bad it's not actually brewed in Boston."
"I had stayed away from this beer for a long time in favor of the smaller micros. But recently it has been my favorite drink. I use the Sam Adams glasses, and I thought they were nice looking and maybe not much more. However, I just had this beer on tap in a plain pint, and I have to admit that neither the taste nor the smell of the hops was nearly as good. In the Sam glasses, the color is lovely, and the column of bubbles coming up from the center looks nice. More important it keeps a small head and aroma from beginning to end. The dry hopped Hallertauer hops are very nice, and the bitterness nicely matches the sweetness of the Vienna style malt. Just wonderful."
"drinkability is also good for a ful flavored lager"
"Verdict: To be quite honest, I was expecting Sam Adams' flagship to be rather tame and bland to help it appeal to a broad-as-possible audience. However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that Boston Lager is actually a rather tasty brew. Sure, it's not the most complex beer I've ever tried, but it certainly isn't just a throwaway either."
"D- This is the New England session beer, flavorful, yet light enough to have a few, well done!"
"Good drinkability, it's easy enough to have a couple in a night although the hoppy aftertaste does get to me after maybe 2 or 3 beers. It's a good standby beer, nothing amazing, but a helluva lot better than a lot of other lagers out there."
"SABL is my go-to craft when I'm eating out at restaurants that lack huge craft beer choices on tap. Nothing goes better with some Buffalo Wild Wings than a Boston Lager on draft. Thank you Sam Adams/Boston Beer Co. for introducing me to the beautiful world of American craft beer. I owe you one."
"decent beer, i prefer it on tap, (reviewed from notes) looks and smells about average, NOT a beer i would drink from a bottle, tasted much better on tap, in a glass, this is my favorite beer with spicy chicken wings. priced kind of high for what i think its worth, but overall one thumb up"
"Drinkability: Very easy to drink. Delicious and light enought to enjoy a large amount of. 4.5"
"I have to say if Samuel Adams makes it then I want to have it. I have not tried one beer from them that I didn't enjoy. Everything I had was gold from them. I recommend this beer."
"It's a sessionable, tasty, inexpensive beer that you can get all the time and just about anywhere. Often the best beer you'll find on-tap in a chain restaurant, and great with all sorts of food. This is really one of the best lagers on the market, and it definitely deserves high marks."
"N: this is the beer I drink when I go to places that do not have a good beer selection. Boston Lager is a mainstay in almost every place that serves beer, either on tap or in a bottle. The cornerstone of the American beer revolution!"
"Finally got my hands on this classic. It may not be the best beer around, but it's worth trying as a piece of craft brewing history. Would session it if they bring it back to my neck of the woods (and keep it cheap)."
"the most drinkable beer in the world. imo, of course."
"There's a lot of real taste here. It's a fine beer that isn't as easy to drink as a lot of the weak crap."
"A very good brew which I always have in the fridge."
"Drinkability: This is definitely a drinkable beer and one that I could drink several of in a sitting and that I will return to periodically."
"A 12 ounce bottle poured into my Samuel Adams shaker glass. Appears a clear rich amber color with around an inch of full creamy bone white foam. A very nice looking pour. Smells and tastes of sweet, caramelized malts, toasted grains, floral hops, light citrus fruit notes, and bread. A notch above medium bodied with ample carbonation for the style."
"Final thoughts: Very decent beer. I enjoyed it very much. Would recommend to any lager fan"
"Ok...I got this Boston Lager at the Wine Garden in Blackfoot, Idaho; I think it was axp. $1.50/bottle. It's a good beer. Aren't they all good beers? That was a rhetorical question...no...they AIN't all good, which is really just plain unfortunate. Ok...This baby looks good. Lots'a big white fluffy head. Nice light brown body w/ crisp and cleat looking. Drinks good. This is a good ""lawnmower"" lager. Cheers!"
"D 4.5 - Seems right on to style description. After a few more review/tastings, I have really grown to like this brew. It delivers a nice hop jab when you are in a mellow mood and prefer to avoid the hop punch!"
"D- Extrememly drinkiable. Very good session beer."
"This was one of the first beers I enjoyed along with Bass (still like it but not as much) and Pete's Wicked Ale (which has been ruined). However, I still enjoy this beer a lot, and actually don't get upset that it is ALWAYS included in every Sam Adams sampler. This is usually my fall back beer in non-beer-centric restaurants and in airports. And you know what, I am always happy to have it."
"The mouthfeel is crisp and refreshing, which leads to a nice drinkability. I have had this beer on many many occasions and will certainly be having it on many more."
"D: easily on my favorite widely available domestic lager; very drinkable and refreshing; the beer that made BBC famous"
"D) Good. I can see having three of these. Not quite a session beer, but there's a reason these are sold in cases."
"Light body...thin texture. Probably over-carbonated for my tastes. This beer just isn't keeping me interested."
"The body is moderate and very easy drinking. Almost a session beer with more depth. The carbonation is good. The feel just has a more American Brown or Pale Ale feel with the fruit and hops to be really called a lager. Overall, this is a good gateway beer for new beer enthusiasts. A bit over showed or forgotten for the old school guys, but I am glad I can come back and review staples of the past."
"Sam Adams is amazing me in each beer i try... its quality guarantee"
"D: not bad. It has been ages since I have had a Boston Lager and I find myself enjoying it"
"D- One of my favorite session/bar beers. Love it."
"a crisp refreshing brew that wont leave you unfulfilled either. overall this an impressive beer with very little to complain about. samuel adams is an excellent choice for all different seasons, occasions, and pairings."
"Very good looking and smelling beer, with a taste that could be pure old school traditional lager, but also reminds me of some English pale ales. Extremely well balanced between the hops and the malt, with a fairly strong blast of both. Definitely a very drinkable beer. I'm sure quite a few could be downed with a great meal. I have to tip my hat to Jim Koch and his team for a job well done. Like many I'm sure, I first discovered Sam Adams in the early eighties along with a few other craft beers, and then began seriously sampling from there. Since then I've tried many different and amazing beers from all over the USA and the world. I recently decided to buy a case of Boston Lager on a whim, because i couldn't find anything else interesting I hadn't tried at the store i was in. I was really amazed at how much i actually enjoyed this beer. I have definitely bought more expensive "" high quality micro brews"" in the past that were not better than this mass produced lager. Of course I have also bought beers that were far superior to Sam Adams, but for the price they are charging i can't think of any. All in all , a very nice beer that i will probably get again."
"D: A classic that still holds up pretty well after 20+ years. It's not the best lager in America, but it is the best widely available one."
"Overall: Possibly the best Large-scale production beer on the Market today. Extremely versatile, I would place this in my top 5 ""gotta have"" brews."
"D: Highly sessionable. A great all-around brew that always works when you need something quick. Usually the best brew every grocery store carries."
"D: One of my gateways to ""good"" beer and still a very nice, well-balanced beer. I need to pick this up more often. Very true to style. Recommended."
"Palate is moderately carbonated, light to medium body. Very different from the bottled version I've had before - hops come out much more clearly in this one."
"Orange amber with tiny suspende particles visable and a fluffy light tan head that leaves some lace on the glass. Sweet biscuity malt and honeycomb with faint toasted grain. Tastes malty and rich with just enogh hop bitterness to balance. Medium bodied for the style with a sticky sweet finish."
"Can't believe anyone could give this beer a low mark. It seems almost perfect to me. Rich complexity, great taste, good aroma..there is a lot happening in a Sam Adams BL- you taste pine, maybe a very slight citrus, wonderfully hoppy and a nice strong beer taste, and with all that, it still is simply beer as beer was meant to be."
"Drinkability- One of the better examples to me of the lager style, very full flavored and delicious finish and balance which is rare in most lagers these days, as this being the first time I tried this I think it will be a pretty regular session beer in my fridge from here out and that says something since im usually way more an ale kinda guy, a good brew and a perfect session"
"Notes: Samuel Adams Boston Lager is one of those beers that you drink a lot of and rave about when you first get into craft beer but fades into the background as you experience more of what is out there. Regardless, it's still a wonderful lager and an absolute classic brew, and is debatably the beer that got the ball rolling for the American craft beer movement. I'll probably be buying it, but not very often."
"D - The balance of this beer makes is a great session beer while still maintaining flavor. For all of its popularity, I still like this beer."
"Light-to-medium bodied with lots of scrubbing carbonation. Nice and crisp. Boston Lager is drinkable by itself, but doesn't leave me wanting another by any means. If this is the only non-BMC product available at a restaurant and I want a beer I'll be happy to get it, but otherwise I'd pass. I'd say its most redeeming quality is its availability."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Pours a nice light copper amber color with a nice frothy head. The head stays for a while and leaves nice lacing all the way down the glass. The smell is sweet and not to hoppy. A hint of caramel comes out as well. The taste is great. Crisp and smooth and goes down pretty fast. I'll take a Samuel Adams any day, and the Boston Lager is one of my favorite offerings from them. Good beer all around."
"Very drinkable and a great option for a session beer."
"I never remembered this being very tasty back in the day and have not had one on tap in a few years. It is surprisingly quite tasty. A masterful malt blend of toasty burnt bitterness and sweet lighter base malt. German hops are flavorful and assertive without distracting from the overall refreshing lager feel. I like this much better on tap than in the bottle. Body is fairly light and carbonation is medium-high. A most solid quaffer."
"This beer reminds me more of an ESB than a lager. Maybe that is a sign of my own ignorance."
"I'm no expert on this style, but everything about this beer is pleasant to me. This is just a great, flavorful session beer that you can enjoy on any kind of occasion. I went from only drinking hop-bomb IPAs and DIPAs and resisting lagers, to really enjoying this style without much effort at all. It kind of surprised me how easy this style is to love, and Boston Lager is a great example of it."
"D - This beer is very easy to drink and highly sessionable. Very smooth and probably one of the better lagers you can find."
"Overall, one of the best lagers I've had to date. The only thing that prevents me from getting this more often is the price, but I'd be more than happy to accept another. The only down side is the fact that this is the only Sam Adams available around here. Wish I had the chance to try some more of there stuff."
"Overall, I have had this many times and I finally reviewed it. This is one amazing beer and it something that I will always buy and have stocked in the fridge. Very easy to drink. Great beer at a great price."
"D - This beer is very easy to drink and highly sessionable. A great choice if there are no other craft options and even then this is still an enjoyable and approachable brew."
"D,this beer is a classic ,one of my all time favorite lagers that i keep going back to, if your not drinking this beer your missing out on beer history ."
"Bright amber with a tidy 1cm head. Nice hop presence on the nose along with yummo caramel malt. Follows through with more of the same on the palate. Good low-med carbonation which helps it go down oh so easy. Reminiscent of a Vienna Lager in a class of its own. I never say no to one of these. It's just a little hard to come by fresh bottles in these parts"
"Pours a clear coppery amber with 2 fingers of foamy slightly off-white head. Good retention and some decent lacing. Smells of citrus zest, spicy and floral hops, toasted grain, honey, and a hint of herbs. Tastes of lemon, herbal hops, toasted malt and grain, caramel, buttered bread, and some dry spicy hops in the finish. Medium in body with pleasant carbonation, very balanced with a semi-sweet/semi-dry feel, smooth with nice crispness. Very easy to drink, a definite session brew that is pretty refreshing."
"Overall: Carbonation wasn't anything special and neither was the drinkability, however this is the best macro I've ever had. If put infront of me I would not have been able to guess it wasn't a craft. Well done Sam Adams."
"When this arrived at my table, it was obvious that the poor bartender had been careless with the pour as the head was gushing over the side of the glass. No matter. Once the head was cleaned up, it was a tall, proud white mass floating atop an amber throne. The head sticks to the glass the entire way down. This is a classic looking beer. The smell, is pleasant but nothing to buy a ring over. Nice sweetness from the malt, not much hop presence in the nose. Nice sweetness, bit caramel, well balanced by slight hop profile. Very nice feel on the mouth, smooth but light. This is such a great beer to kick back to, I am always amazed at how much I like these."
"still highly recommended."
"[Drinkability]: A bit harsh in the citrus dept. for me anyway. Worlds from the groovy brew I just recently had"
"Overall, Boston Lager has been and will continue to be one of my favorite lagers. It is a great introduction to anyone who has never had craft beer because of the balance of the flavors. Worthy of being session beer for any beer drinker."
"D: Went down nice and easy. Overcame the aftertaste by taking another drink..."
"D: This is one of my favorite American lagers. Easy to drink and thirst quenching. I can always go for a second."
"The mouthfeel is that of a medium bodied lager and the taste is sweet and bitter at the same time. Not much of an aftertaste. It really is one of the better quasi-crafts out there."
"Pours a clear dark amber, light orange hues, thick white head forms, quickly drops to a medium collar around the glass, some lace spots, looks pretty good. Smell is nice, more floral than I remember from the bottle, biscuit and toasty malts, some caramel sweetness, apricots, floral hops, basic but well done. Taste is similar, nice caramel and biscuit up front, toasty middle, light graininess, some floral hopping in the finish, almost a peach like fruitiness, solid bitterness. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with medium carbonation. A very well crafted lager, much better on tap than in bottles. Nice stuff, could drink this all night."
"Very drinkable. A very good lager."
"Good medium amber color and decent head retention. Smells a bit hoppy and sweet. This beer holds it down, and is a favorite of mine. However, it has a few misgivings that make it near the bottom of my list of beers I'd buy and keep on hand in my home. It is too sweet a beer, i dont know if that is indicative of all Vienna lagers, or just this one, but its too sweet. Carbonation is also a bit overwhelming, especially when its too cold, which is why you need to drink it at 40- 45 degrees, not the crazy freezing temperatures they would normally serve it at bars. That being said, this beer broke the way for commercially acceptable ""good"" beers. It deserves a place in history for that. A really good brew, not great, but good."
"Not a real filling beer. I like this beer it has alot of flavor, not too sweet, and ample bitterness."
"Not as in-your-face as other beer types, but this is a great example of Vienna lagers."
"Above average drink ability. Kinda boring flavors, wouldnt seek out this beer again but its decent and somewhat widely available."
"D: good for what it's trying to be, just not really my thing."
"An American classic! I like to think of this as one of the flagship beers of the US and am proud to live in a country where a beer of such caliber can be found in any gas station or corner store."
"Found a 2007 bottle in the back of my fridge and thought it might be fun to see how it aged. Poured a deep amber with a light orange-white head. A bit hazy, perhaps showing its age, but probably chill haze. Aroma was a bready malt with a hint of orange, still quite pleasant. Taste began with malt sweetness having a hint of caramel. A small spicy hop presence was detectable finishing with a moderate yeast flavor and little to no aftertaste. Mouthfeel was light to medium bodied having moderate carbonation. Overall, simple, but enjoyable. Light and refreshing."
"Great drinkability. A good beer that is always available. A great introductory beer to those new to craft beer. This was one of the first craft beers I tried and there was a bit of shock at how much flavor it had compared to macros. As my palate has expanded, I have come to appreciate it a lot more."
"Pours a deep rich copper/amber, medium head and Beautiful lacing. Lots of carbonation that holds throughout drinking. Looks very inviting! Smells of sharp & crisp grape with sweet but slightly burnt caramel malt. Floral spicy/citrus hops as well. Tastes of sweet, crisp rich roasted caramel, with a spicy roasted hop bitterness at the end. Hop bitterness lingers just a tad. A touch of citrus/pine as well. As it warms, more of a slightly burnt caramel flavor comes out Mouthfeel is light-medium bodied, with high carbonation. Great beer overall and a great session brew."
"D: Great session beer, this one goes down easy and is really flavorful. A good beer all around."
"Thats right. I said it."
"Overall a very well made American beer. Has the characteristics of an ale."
"D: Never again."
"D. Very drinkable beer. Great session beer and stand out among other highly marketed lagers."
"You can't go wrong with this one."
"If I were going to pick any nits I would say that it is a Fischer price beer so I can't justify a perfect score when it is intentionally less flavorful than it could be. Also the head retention is spotty. But that's about it. Great beer."
"cheers!"
"Poured a copper penny color with an initial finger thick head but it diminished quickly with minimal lacing (i read other reviews about a large head, it mightve been a result of my pouring skills from the bottle to a mug). A good balanced smell between all flavors as nothing really sticks out to me. Enters your mouth and the smell is what you taste, and it is a medium thickness which results in a medium drinkability. In comparison to macro lagers, it is a noticeably heavier beer. overall a good average beer for an average day. an easy daily drinker."
"Medium carbonation, right ABV level and not very filling, making for a very drinkable lager. A perfect transition beer as it was for me some time ago. Some people love to hate SA, but for me this is still a classic that I enjoy revisiting every now and then."
"Served right out of the fridge on a very warm February Texas afternoon. Pours a dark copper red from the bottle with around two fingers of head, which sticks around for a long time and leaves plenty of lacing. Smell is lightly piney and the taste follows suit with some piney hops and citrus up front, then pepper and some caramely sweetness in the finish. As I neared the end of the glass, the beer did become a bit watery, however. Mouthfeel is light and a little sticky, and this is a very drinkable beer. I need to get back to the basics like Boston Lager more often!"
"The original Sam Adams is without question my go-to beer whether I'm drinking at a party or with a few friends. The alcohol content is just right, and you feel great after a couple. There are few beers that are on-par with Sam Adams Boston Lager that I have ever tasted. When poured out, this beer has a rich, dark-reddish-brown color that just screams class. I cannot honestly say I have had any beers that match Boston Lager in overall quality, other than maybe Great Lakes Elliot Ness. Drink up!"
"D: This was the first beer I ever drank. Not a bad one to come in on! I continue to drink and love this beer today. If you have a friend that wants to try ""real beer"" this is a great one to start them on!"
"Solid beer that is well balanced. It is an excellent fall back beer when you end up in bars that this is the best they will offer. When it's between a Sammy or a Budweiser, the choice is simple."
"Very clean and rustic/coppery taste. Strong balance between the slightly roasty profile of the malts, and a bit of a hop bit at the end. Grainy, and a little biscuity. Little bit of caramel present. Medium body and refreshing. Not the biggest beer nor the most complex. This leads it to be a bit thin, but a very easy drink. As far as lagers go, you can definitely do worse. I'm not the biggest fan of lagers in general, but this is a New England staple for the warmer months."
"Cheers!"
"D - it's not anything special, but it's definitely one beer that I'd pick for a session beer. In terms of Vienna Lagers, Great Lakes Eliot Ness gets the nod, but I usually keep a few of these on hand should i feel the need to get hammered"
"Beer is a very clear amber-orange color. About three fingers of off-white head, good retention and excellent lacing. Smells are mostly of hops, a little earthy and floral. Taste is of hops, a bit of bitterness finishes it off, but it's not overwhelming in the least. Mouthfeel is a little watered down, but very crisp and clean at the same time. Overall, very drinkable and an excellent standby beer. Pairs perfectly with a fishing excursion or warm summer night."
"Drinkability: lately this has become a fallback for me since my local LCBO doesn't sell anything worth drinking. For such a widely distributed beer, it's quite impressive. Plenty of hops in the smell and taste, a pleasant mouthfeel, and a solid appearance. I think I'll have another!"
"M&D--Mouthfeel was only average as I felt it stung a little more, was a bit more astringent, than I would have expected. Drinkability is fantastic--an affordable, flavorful beer you could drink all night. This is the flagship for a reason."
"[two hundred and fifty character limit is crazy]"
"D - This was my first time having Boston Lager and I enjoyed it over all those cheaper beers...easily could be a session beer for me"
"Sure, it's been reviewed a million times, but what's one more? Still one of my favorites, a solid beer, great taste, never any complaints about it. It's a great 'go-to' beer when you're not quite sure what sounds good. It's just filling enough so that you're not tempted to drink way to many of them, but also good enough that you want more than one."
"An old standby that I usually order at restaurants or bars which have selections limited mostly to macros. Even places of limited selection usually carry the Boston Lager."
"Overall a very solid beer. I had it at a Boston hotel and it definitely tastes better here than it does at home in Texas."
"Very nice drinkability with low abv makes this and excellent fall-back/session beer or nice aperitif. Solid stuff from the folks at SA."
"Overall: The body is a lightly medium, with a slight creamy astringent flavor. The finish is bitter and dry, giving the beer a clean finish. I was disappointed to not see a persistent head. The beer is unlike European version where is drier and not sweet, thus giving the beer its own character. It is a very good American beer. This is my mainstay beer and I like to drink on a regular bases."
"Like most Samuel Adams beers I find this Lager a bit thin and with a mouth feel of a beer that costs much less; such as Yuengling Lager. The color is good and it head is OK; a bit more hops would help balance the malt sweetness. Like all Sam Adams I find this brew over priced for what it delivers."
"D: My go-to beer if there is nothing else available, or, sometimes, its just a great break from some the Quads/Trips, Doppelbocks & other bigger beers I have been going to."
"Drinkability- Enough of everything to want more and not so much that you couldn't have as many as you want. Sounds perfect for a session to me."
"Poured into my Sam Adams glass. Pours amber with a decent head to start that fades to a swirl of a cap and thin ring. Smells malty and clean with any adjunct aromas or wateriness. Clean and bready with a slight tang. The taste is equally firm and bready with a modicum of firm, earthy bitterness that carries through to the finish and marries well with the light sweetness of the malt and gets support from the firm baked bread flavors. Very well balanced and well made. This is more than just a ""gateway"" beer for emerging beer aficionados, this is a solid beer in its own right that plays not at all to the lowest common denominator. Firm in the mouth and very satisfying to drink."
"Samuel Adams Boston Lager pours a nice golden copper caramel copper with a nice head that dissipates relatively slowly. Looks like a beer a nice inviting brew. Smells like some malts and cereal. Tastes malty, hoppy, a little bitter, but nice balance of flavor. Mouthfeel is light, mild carbonation. I enjoy this nice, balanced, drinkable beer - and it's available nearly everywhere.. which is a definite plus."
"All in all, are pretty good beer."
"As such a popular beer it def. deserves to be respected for maintaining quality."
"A decent, but over-rated lager in my opinion. Usually the last choice in a pub for me (granted, if the others were Bud Lite & Corona, I'd embrace the Sam heartily though). Overall just a basic lager with too much hop to really express anything else. Simple beer for a basic drinking, not too complex and certainly more a pale ale than a lager to my palate."
"Can be powered down without a second thought, if that's what you're into; but can also be sipped and enjoyed. Good flavor and atmosphere. Overall, really good quaff."
"D - Very high drinkability coming in under 5% abv."
"This beer is easy to drink, goes down smooth and not as watered down as a lot of other more mass produced beers. The beer is well balanced, light to medium body and it is always a good choice if left with few options."
"A very decent beer. I'd prefer it to have a little higher abv content, and not quite as much malt, but that's just me."
"Overall - A good session beer that compliments many occasions and foods."
"Drinkability: I can have this as a session beer..I have really gained an appreciation for this beer lately. It is multi-faceted--bitter and sweet and is really becoming one of my favorite offerings from Sam Adams--not something I would have said ten years ago"
"Bottle pour into new Samuel Adams Lager Glass. Clear amber color with moderat off-white head. Aroma of caramel malts and hops, less evident than the malts. Very well balanced beer, and IMO at the top of its category, a premium lager. The more I drink this beer I appreciate it for what it is - a very good beer when often the only other choices are from BMC. Excellent session beer and like I said the more I give this beer a chance, the more it impresses me. Cheers!"
"This one pours out a nice copper color, with a head that sticks. Smells of hops, malt, and very fresh. Taste is very hoppy, and malty, and smoooth. I was surprised how smooth this was. Mouthfeel is nice and full, with just the right amount of carbonation. Drinkability, i would of given this a 5 but its a little on the heavier side, an after 2-3 i just don't want anymore. Dont get me wrong i really like this beer, i just dont see this as a session beer, but for savoring and just having a few, this is a solid beer. I wish Canada could mass produce beer like this. Well done."
"Flavor is at the top of the list for most of the lagers I've had. It fairly rich with malty tone that's more roasted than it's macro cousins. Sweetness is just rich with aspects of caramel. Hop bitterness is great and really wouldn't expect to mush more from a lager without crossing styles. Mouthfeel is medium, smooth, well balanced and just might have to have another. I has a high degree of drinkabiltiy. I should have listened to those commercials."
"Mouthfeel is extremly light, so drinkability as a session beer is good. For my German-inspired lagers, I think Ill stick to good German brew or Victory and Stoudts Pilsners."
"D- case worthy if you dont want to spend loads of money on micros. This would be a good tailgating beer for a concert!"
"D: Because of the good taste and lower abv, this one's a winner when it comes to easy of drinking. Isn't life-altering but it's a very good beer."
"Poured into a pint glass a lovely med tan with a frothy 1"" light tan head, left a nice series of rings as I emptied the glass. Great aroma with a strong hop presence. This hop presence followed thru into the flavor but is well balanced with malt. I can always drink a Sam Adams's, truly a well crafted lager"
"m&d: Decent mouthfeel, light to medium body. Extremely easy to drink, however, I think better beers can be had in a similar price range."
"This is a great go to beer. Looks a nice golden color with a white head that lasts the duration of the drink. Smells fresh, especially if you are used to adjunct lagers. Mouthfeel is great for a lager, much smoother than your average lager. Drinkability is great, as said before this is my go to session beer and is reasonably priced."
"5/5 for drinkability. Totally sessionable."
"D- Quite drinkable. Twenty minutes till my flight leaves... I'll have another"
"D- Easy to drink, but isn't something I would go and buy regularly."
"D - I wouldn't call this lager refreshing, but it's got a lot of flavor and isn't overwhelming. A great combination when were dealing with drinkability. This lager has routed the previous drinking habits of the dreaded bud and miller drinkers in my family, and I'm proud they've begun to move on."
"Pours a clear, light, brown color. 1/2 inch head with slight retention and little lacing. Smells mainly of hops. Fits the style. Tastes of bitter hops first, then the sweetness of some malt. It's a crisp, smooth, feel with a good blend of hops and malt. Average carbonation. Overall, easy drinking - good lager - and really smooth."
"Really drinkable. I could easily knock back a sixer of this."
"(rated Feb 8, 2007)"
"Dr -- Drinkable, certainly, but not too much to focus on."
"D: A big selling point of this beer. Highly quaffable."
"D -- Drinkability is average as the hop aftertaste starts to get a little cloying. Noble hops seem to do this when used in greater amount, I get the same effect with Pilsner Urquell. At 4.75%, this is would be a great session beer if you like heavy noble hop character."
"A great choice for a very good beer when there is nothing but macros available....heck, I'd take this even if there were some micros available."
"Overall impression: one of the better lagers, nice, refreshing and malty. Cheap too."
"Amber color with average head but some good lacing. My nose picked up on the hops right away. Same with the taste. A little too boring for my personal taste. Even though it is a great lager, maybe not my cup of tea."
"I did my best to give this an unbiased review, but I probably didn't. This beer always reminds me of home, and drinking beers with my family. So no matter where I am I always feel a little bit better drinking a Sam."
"A classic for a reason...one of the beers that got me into micros."
"this is a beer that i know i can always fall back on."
"D - A drinkable beer me and some college friends drink on regular occasions. I credit them for finally getting me to drink it."
"D-This is a most drinkable of beers. I can't imagine anyone not liking it, one heck of a lot better than Bud. SA built their business on it...nuff said. This is what I offer my non beer drinking friends who want ""a beer"""
"D- excellent! Just an excellent all around beer. I have and will continue to drink quite a few of these."
"Mouthfeel is a bit prickly for my taste. Carbonation could be more restrained."
"I love this beer. I crave it often, have it often, and think it is one of the better craft beers out there. It's safe...but very well brewed. Also goes great with most dishes. Go to a restaurant and this will almost always be there and it can pair with anything."
"D - I love this beer, and have no problem picking up a six anytime. I find SABL to be an extremely drinkable craft beer. This is a good beer if you plan on having a good amount, Sam does the trick everytime. A staple for me."
"Drinkability is high with just the right amount of bitterness at the end."
"This is a very good beer to enjoy on occasion if you don't mind the hops."
"Overall: Overrated."
"Not as flavorful as the winter lager, but hoppy enough to be considered a true craft lager."
"Out of the winter sampler pack, been a long time. Pours a clear light orange, sticky lacing down the glass. Smell: pale malt, vague grassy, spicy hops, and sweet caramel malt. Taste: light hop bitterness followed by sweet malt, a little 'musty.' As always, it's a good example of the style, sessionable, and omnipresent."
"The carbonation hit me before the taste which was a little surprising. Good bitterness keeps this from being too wussy of a beer. I think I'm drinking it a little warm which might account for it not being as deliciously malty and irresistable as I sometimes remember. Mouthfeel is a little bland. I always notice when the beer's water characteristics seem separated form the rest of the beer. Again, this might be the slight warmness of the beer but I'll crack open a fresh one later and update if it's too much."
"I'm not usually a big fan of lagers, but this one has just enough complexity to make it worthwhile. Definitely a good choice for long nights of drinking or for introducing friends to craft beer."
"very drinkable, I'd rather just try something else most times though"
"the go to beer in boston, its an institution. rather than have a natty bo or PBR, Henry's or Lone Star, we are fortunate enough in this city to have our local favorite be an absolutely great beer. Thanks so much Jim!"
"A very pretty amber color,with a sudsy white head. Aroma of spicy hops and sweet bready malt.Flavor is of roasted caramel and piny hops,a little spice.A little lacing,ok mouthfeel,crisp finish.This is not a huge big bad beer but it is consistantly good and avaiable,Very drinkable .Thanks Sam"
"Notes: Overall a bit expensive for what it is, but it's widely available, reliable, and tasty. Will definitely buy again!"
"Overall a pretty good beer. My only complaint is that it could be more balanced. Not something that would become one of my regulars, to me there are better beers out there for the price."
"Sweet, strongly citrus (lemon) nose on the beer right out of the bottle that gets me excited to taste the beer. Has a great look to it, golden brown with a white, frothy head that leaves a thick, solid lacing down the glass as I drink it. Taste is good but not as complex as a lot of other beers I've had. The hoppiness makes the beer, very strong hop flavor. Carbonation is present but not overwhelming. The strongest point of this beer is its availability- without it we'd be stuck with the token light beers at most mainstream restaurants. As a beer alone, I'd rank it in the lower threes. However, the Boston Beer Company gives me hope yet for macros- they have marketing on par with the watery, fizzy ""light"" crap produced by Coors, Miller, and Anheuser-Busch, but make a solid product that American beer drinkers can be proud of. That alone tilts the rating into the higher threes for me."
"D: Very drinkable. On the lighter side of Vienna style with light floral hopping."
"Drinkability : an average beer in the style American Lager."
"Pours clear amber with a short but thick off-white head. Malty, slightly acidic aroma reminiscent of sourdough. Sweet, carmael malt taste with a astringent finish not unlike an ESB. Very good lager that is always an option adn is popular enough to have when better beers are unavailable."
"Very drinkable."
"I'm surprised at how much I still like this beer. After all the many incredible, rare (and expensive) beers I've tried, it turns out one of the best is available at every store in America."
"6/4/6/4/13 (3.3/5)"
"Drinkability/Final thoughts - I could probably drink about 3-4 of these cause the carbonation is very filling. That being said, I absolutely love this beer! Wonderfully balanced, rich and chocolaty full flavored lager. I highly recommend you try this beer. Cheers!"
"Pours an amber-red color body, with a medium white head and some good lacing. Has a strong aroma of hops. A smooth, balanced flavor, some maltiness. Not too much flavor, slightly bitter finish."
"D - Great drinkability. A refreshing lager that goes down smooth and you could keep coming back to. The wonderful hop flavor makes it better than most american lagers, in my opinion, and the added flavor definitely adds to its drinkability. Really the type of lager you want to be drinking on a hot summer day with dinner, though could easily be enjoyed any time of the year!"
"Mouthfeel is smooth and crisp, not too much carbonation. Excellent session beer because of the excellent balanced but standard taste, and the great price. Drink this any day over BMC"
"Overall this was a beer I have had quite a few times in the past, I would not put it in the top of my list but It would not be the first beer I chose. I have a hit and miss relationship with sam adams. but tend to have a more hit relationship with them so this could be a good thing."
"D - This offering from Samuel Adams receives high marks from me by being one my favorite session beers out there, the taste will not floor someone looking for a ""Big Beer," but it is magnificent for what it is: a very tasty beer with enough alcohol to down several while watching the game"
"When I go out and the bar does not carry a great selection of beers this is an old reliable."
"I have never loved this beer. It has the bitterness of hops, but not all of the flavor benefits. However it still is a go to beer in a bad beer situation."
"Still has that soft spot, however, and all things considered, an important beer. ."
"Drinkability is, by far, the best I've had in a Sam Adams yet. Easy to drink and pairs well. In all fairness this is a good beer, hopefully I'll find more of Sam's that are like this."
"mid body. enough carbonation. good beer. i have enjoyed this beer for years and will continue to enjoy for years to come. would like to see them add an additional holiday beer to the sample 12 pack and leave this one out."
"This is what I get at bars that don't cater to beer dorks."
"A pleasantly tasty example of the prototypical gateway craft beer, and a lager to boot, which is infinitely more challenging a prospect. Fully satisfying, a little zingy, and worthy of its lore in American brewing circles. Now where's that clam chowda I'm suddenly craving?"
"Drinkability: IMHO an above average beer on the delightful hop flavor and aroma alone. I'd call the Boston Lager my Old Faithful. You know exactly what you'll get and it's accessible. This beer is always welcome in my fridge."
"You know, I used to be kind of a BL hater, but I can appreciate it now, as I think my snobbery has receded a bit. Boston Lager pours a nice amber orange color with yellow highlights, with a nice, big fluffy head that leaves some pretty chunky lacing down the glass. Aroma is slightly sweet and floral. Flavor profile is a nice balance between sweet malts and floral, herbal hops. Crisp clean mouthfeel, a perfect session beer. Solid as can be."
"This is a beer I have often and is one of the best beers to have with a meal as well."
"O: Overall it seems things have changed visually and aromatically, this is still a good beer, sweeter then i remember flavor wise, toasty, and crisp. Still easy to consume, refreshing and holds a special place in my heart . Not sure whats going with the ever changing style category but decent starter."
"Sam Adams Boston Lager is my Fall Back beer when I'm don't feel like takin a chance."
"It pours a deep copper color with fairly substantial white head. You can smell flowery hops and carmely malt. There are well balanced spicy hop to malt ratio with a light to medium mouthfeel. This is a highly drinkable beer. I would have to put it on my list of desert island beers along with Sierra Nevada Pale Ale and a few others."
"A well balanced lager with nice hopiness. I would agree with the other posts that it has an impressive quality for such a mass produced, readily available beer. I would really like to try more of their beers, but here only the lager, cream stout, cherry wheat, and seasonal offerings are available, such as octoberfest, winter lager, summer ale, and I think that's it."
"Drinkability: Samuel Adams' flagship beer is leaps and bounds ahead of other mass-produced American beers. Drinkable, but still full of flavor and highly enjoyable. Good hop flavor in a lager- especially one so common."
"Taste & mouthfeel: Opens with semi-sweet toasted malt flavors, flowery hops, citrus zest and hints of honey. Biscuity dryness takes over soon after, with fairly mild but pleasant bittering hops following. It's amusing to think that I found this beer intensely bitter only four years ago. An undertone of caramel appears mid-finish, balancing the bitterness to create a wonderfully smooth aftertaste. An exceptionally good session beer all in all, perfectly balanced but complex enough to remain interesting after a few pints."
"Drinkability - Could be a good session beer for some, although I'd rather have just one at a time. Probably one of the best beers in its class, but I find other Sam Adams beers to be better."
"Drinkability - The cereal grain taste starts to wear on your as you drink it, and the hop bite isn't as clean as it could be, but its not too bad for a lager."
"This is a very easy to drink beer. What I think is one of the better lagers out there."
"D= high, this is a great American lager, I really enjoy this one as an everyday beer. great balance and taste"
"Future outlook: Though I'm not wowed by this offering, as part of a solid Winter Classic mix pack, I'm sure that we'll meet again some sunny day...."
"Sam Adams Boston Lager is my ""Go-To"" beer. It's always good, always reliable."
"Drinkability: Easy and smooth. Best American lager we've come across."
"D: Easy to drink. Nothing wrong yet nothing outstanding. I never mind having a SA Lager."
"Nice medium bodied, fulfilling beer. It's nice to take a step back and appreciate this beer on a sip by sip basis, since most of the time I drink it by the pint and grumble that the bar has nothing better to offer. Perspective is everything, but this beer will always have a place in my house."
"I poured my Boston Lager into my SA pint glass. An attractive beer, clear gold with a hint of auburn. There us decent head formation with lots of lacing. The aroma is heavy with grain notes. Boston Lager is a slightly sweet smooth beer with a clean finish. Boston Lager is light bodied and very sessionable."
"Had on tap in a 23 oz. glass. Appears orange-copper in color with a once inch off-white head that sinks down to a skim and eventually to a ring. Leaves a bit of lace. Aroma is mildly sweet caramel malts with a nice toasty character that seems similar to an Oktoberfest with a bit more hops in the background that are spicy and earthy. Taste has an initial sweetness that fades into the finish, but it blends with some toasty and nutty flavors before doing so. It finishes with some spicy hops. Mouthfeel is medium-light, crisp and drinkable. Good stuff for the style, very drinkable. Always a solid choice when there is nothing else but macros, Guinness, and Bass around."
"D: Overall, this is a great beer to sit back and drink. Luckly, this beer happens to be almost everywhere so if I'm in a bar with a poor beer choice then I can always at least hope they have this beer. It is very easy to drink. I love the amount of hops in it, not too much or too little."
"Ok, now that I have that out of my system....Sam Adams you are good, especially with how you make your holiday porters and stouts. It is what I look forward to every winter. Thanks."
"The color was a rich reddish copper with plenty of tan creamy head. I was impressed by the head retention because it was on tap. Most beers don't retain the head character like this one. Smells like hops and caramel malts. Wow.... the hops come through. I liked this lager - it has the flavor of an IPA but this is definitely a lager. This is a unique beer with complex aftertones and very drinkable."
"It's hard to find anything wrong with this beer. Great session beer that is always consistent. This beer is easy to find even in rural Indiana. I always come back to it."
"D-Good drinkability. It's a clean and relatively refreshing lager beer. Won't fatigue one's tastebuds, and I'll be drinking more of this beer in the future."
"Overall this is a very easy-drinking beer and a good choice if you're in for the long haul, which is where I'll be Sept. 5 of 2009."
"An all-around good beer."
"This is actually one of my least favorite Sam Adams brew. It pours a medium brown with a decent head but I just do not like the taste. It has a bitter aftertaste that just stays with you. I like Sam Adams, but this is one of my least favorites by them. I would drink their light before this."
"Still, if there's a better amber lager out there, I haven't found it yet."
"The mouthfeel and drinkability are good, there are tons of beers I would rather have, and perhaps just as many I would rank below this lager. Again, when in a sea of doo doo...here is your life preserver"
"Light amber color. Head isn't much to speak about but the thin cap trails some nice lace. Smell of toasted malt and some light floral hops. Taste is pleasant enough. Nice maltyness with hops for balance. Overall a nice brew. I bought a case of this for some non beer enlightened guest who would never drink my normal beers. It fit the bill perfectly, not too bold for the BMC drinkers but enough flavor to satisy the craft beer drinker. Also a good fallback in many bars/restaurants that don't carry good beer."
"I could honestly drink this beer all day (and have on several occasions). It reminds me of the past and times forgotten. I can remember being at USMA and drinking this delicious beer at the officer's club while watching the Red Sox on the corner TV. I can remember drinking this beer at Christmas with my Dad. I can remember giving this beer to so many friends in an effort to ""convert"" them to real beer. Oh how this beer is a tasty memory."
"T - Tastes pick up a good balance of high hop with a malty aftertaste and a slight citrus taste that lingers."
"D-I could definitely knock back a few easily. Great session beer in my honest opinion."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink if you prefer this style, defintley a good choice at a bar to have something different then all these nasty Bud Light and Coors products. Perfect balancing from the appearance, taste and drinkability. Kudos to Jim Koch for making Boston Lager a true American beer we can be proud of!"
"There's definately some fun complexity in the flavor. More hops than average I'd say. there's the grainy and the malty, but it's well balanced with the bitterness."
"This was the first beer I ever had when I started drinking beer 4 years ago. Always has been a favorite."
"My second favorite lager in the world behind Brooklyn. Since its not as available Sammy has been my go to beer."
"D - Definitely a session beer, without a doubt."
"D. Easy to find this as its everywhere and a good session beer"
"I have always enjoyed SA. I have yet to rate it, but it is one of the very best high productions around."
"D--i can drink this beer all day long..at less than 5% makes this beer such a great session beer with a great amount of flavors...not a bad price either, just over 20 bucks for a case?count me in baby.."
"Pours a amber/golden color. Nice head with lots of nice lacing. Smells to me like a lot of bread smell. Not too much going on there. Drinkability is great. This beer is everything I want from a lager. Not a lot going on with this beer, but it is a very good lager that goes down quite nice. I could drink a lot of these."
"Medium carbonation that made this highly drinkable. This was an ok brew. I know this is the 'anchor' of the brewery, but they put out so many more good brews. This is better than most mainstream lagers, but I'll get something better in the future."
"The appearance is the best thing about this beer. Amber colored, with a decent head. No aroma to speak of, maybe a bit of malt, but not much. Taste is a metallic, slightly malty flavor, but just not much going on. This beer is maybe half a notch better than BudMillerCoors, but that's about all I can say that is positive."
"This is exactly what I look for in a Lager. Not weak, you can taste the hops, and the finish is dry. When I go out to eat and I want a beer to go with my food this is what I want, not some metallic watery beer that just doesn't satisfy. I like this beer a lot and will keep this in my frig since it's so easy to get."
"Poured into a chilled lager glass. They only had chilled so i waited until the beer warmed up. Poured a deep amber with decent head. Smell was light floral hops mixed with subtle malts. taste is why i reviewed this. I had been drinking budweiser all morning so this was beyond refeshing. The hops REALLY stuck out and were quite floral, I believe the keg was freshly tapped. gentle carbonation overall. I could session these all day long."
"3.5 M&4 D: Well-balanced lager with a soft malty mouthfeel throughout, though it could gain more assertive flavours from larger quantities of dark malts perhaps? Anyway, it's a refreshing lager and a solid brew by all means!"
"I've enjoyed this beer for years but only thought to review it recently. Always a pleasant and easy to drink lager."
"All in all, this is a great beer. Truly an American classic. I hope they don't change a thing about it in my life time."
"Taste is not very ballanced. Plenty of hops in these hop shortage times. But I don't taste anything to back it up. NOt much grain, yeast or malt behind it. This beer has a little carbonated bite. Best served cold from a tap when I can't find a decent alternative."
"Like many, this beer was my first into the craft beer world and I still love drinking it to this day. The caramel undertones in the taste and the overall appearance and drinkability make this one a big winner for me. Available anywhere at usually about $1 a beer... it's even at almost any bar you'll come across in the US.. not a bad thing at all."
"Review #300 is from the Sam Adams brewmasters 12 pack. Boston Lager is a well-made beer that is a decent stepping stone up from the macros. Not my favorite style or flavor profile, but I'll have it from time to time."
"Poured into a 12 oz glass, nice head with average staying power. Color a nice gold-copper-amber but lacks the metallic looking edge that some beers have being more like a burnished wood than a polished metal. The smell is of citrusy hops and light to medium malt notes that come through on the flavor with grapefruit notes and a quickly fading malt taste with dry citrusy finish. I've always liked this brew with seafood. Cheers."
"D- Ahh, here is where the rubber meets the road. This beer has some lace. It has some taste. It has a name (at least in America), with Sam Adams. It has JUST enough taste to make it a very GOOD session beer."
"Bottle / Artwork - Vintage Samuel Adams label that we've come to know and love... Blue with silver outline..."
"The taste ios light toffee with grain, a light pine bitterness that builds toward the end. The finish is pine, grain, and cracker. It's crisp yet fairly tasty, smooth and easy to drink, but doesn't have that much too it."
"D= Very drinkable beer and highjly sessionable. I don't know why others don't hop up their lagers as this one has everything they do not. Well balanced and well crafted."
"Pours a copper brown with about a 1/4 inch head. The beer smells of sweet malts and hops. The taste is a good balance of hops and malts sweet initially followed by the bitterness of the hops. The mouth feel is surprisingly balanced good combination of hop bitterness and malt. This is a very drinkable beer. Defiantly one I could have more than one of. I have found that the flavor of the beer is better as it warms. This is a good fall back beer that can be found almost anywhere in the Northeast."
"Taste is great. Its been a long time since I've had this beer, and forgot how good it is! A lot of hops, but not a punch in the face. Even maltyness. A great balanced beer. Why don't I drink this more? It's not a blow your socks off beer, but it is just really good!"
"This is - IMO - the best commercial American Lager available. When I first had it years ago I was much less experienced with beers, and couldn't stand it, because all I had been drinking was American Lagers. Since then, I've been able to expand my palate significantly, and have come to appreciate this for what it is - a strong, full-bodied lager that does a great job of balancing the hops and the malt. My favorite and old-reliable if I'm in a bar or restaurant where no craft or imports can be found."
"D - Moderate. Not bad in a bar full of Bud Light."
"d - one after another is easy"
"Refreshing and drinkable throughout an evening."
"a 3; s 3; t 2; m 3; d 2.5"
"Drinkability: Pretty good for this, its pretty common at bars and can be a frequent purchase. Its easy to drink. Good complex flavors overall. Well balanced."
"I've had bad examples of this beer at the local pubs here in my small town in Karlstad. It seems to be a standard beer at the pubs which is not a real ""beer pub", but still more sophisticated then the worst ones. This time the beer tasted good... and thanks to the beer gods for that!"
"D - this goes down pretty easily and quickly. Not a bad option for having several in a night."
"I remember my first Sam Adams. Working graveyard shift at an (in)convenience store, I would grab a sixer at random to relax with before passing out for the day. Brought home some Sammies. Thought they were the most god awful swill imaginable. Couldn't even drink a whole bottle. What a pathetic wuss I was. Fast forward 15 years and I think Sam Adams taste like sweet candy. Could drink 'em all day. And night."
"D. This is a fairly drinkable beer, and much better served and consumed cold. When it warmed up a bit I didn't enjoy it as much."
"A Really good beer on Draft!"
"D. A beer that uses subtle flavors, nothing too complex. I prefer Sam Adams Summer Ale, but enjoyed this enough to get it again. A good beer to play video games with if you like."
"D - This is the mother of all session beers. Always a good decision!"
"Dark golden transparent colored beer with a good, sticky white head. Aroma of grains, barley, faint hop bed underneath the malt, subtle sweetness also in the nose. Taste of barley, hops, greens, a nice sweet note that hits toward the finish and lingers refreshingly. This is steps above the yellow fizz that's around. All in all, smooth beer and light bodied, a fine beer of choice to reach for."
"Being originally from New England this was and still is a regular for me. Pours a copper color with a nice off-white head that leaves some lacing behind. Some bitter hops, slightly sweet and balanced by caramel malts. Not complex but enough flavor in there to make this quite enjoyable. A nice easy to find session brew."
"Solid brew for being so widely distributed. I'm glad to have it again."
"Aroma is toasted malts with a caramel and floral hint. The taste is smooth and is started by a long lasting malt that is finished by a good hop bitterness. The malt flavor stays on the tongue for sometime. Overall a very solid lager and is a good session."
"Very smooth and crisp as far as mouth feel goes. Medium light in the mouth. One heck of an easy drinker. Great for a stand by brew."
"Very good drinkability and an absolute quality session beer at a respectable price."
"There's a reason this is America's most popular ""craft"" brew: it's readily available, balanced, and flavorful enough to please the beer lovers out there when nothing better makes a show on the menu, though not too complex or strong for the uninitiated. Though not following the same style, I'm anxious to see how well the upcoming Budweiser American Ale compares to the quintessential Sam Adams brew."
"A great session beer for the cost. And it has saved me in many a crappy bar with no selection of beer so the rating is higher here because of that."
"Not too offensive and available almost everywhere, making it a very good introductory beer to the light beer drinker. Very well done, Sam Adams!"
"T: Taste was classic, as you expect it. Nice malty flavor up from with some hopps coming across the nose. very nice and quite drinkable."
"T: A very nice session beer. Good anytime. Not my favorite brew by Boston Beer, but certainly one I have come to enjoy more recently."
"D - Not my favorite beer but a good regular offering at many places with out craft bews."
"Pouring into pint glass created a massive head that soon settled to three fingers floating above a sea of light copper. Head retention seems better than average. Smells of floral and citrus hops with faint sweet toasted malts. Taste starts with nice hop notes balanced by sweet malt with a touch of caramel. Goes down like water after a 5 mile run! Overall a balanced and quality brew. Perhaps my tastes have matured, but in my youth I remember this being a bigger beer than it tastes nowadays. Still a damn good Vienna Lager built on quality ingredients. One of my favorites with spicy foods especially Mexican."
"What a terrific beer. Well-balanced, incredibly drinkable, yet still has very interesting qualities. As a bonus, easy to find anywhere. Definitely my ""desert island"" beer."
"A very nice beer and another quality brew from sam adams, something you can go back to and drink year round; and good with lots of food."
"I won't forget the first time I tried this and how I was blown away by it; it truly redefined to me what a lager beer can be. It's so lively and flavorful like many top-notch ales I enjoy. World class, and maybe the ultimate gateway beer into the craft beer world."
"Drinkability: Enjoyed many times over many years in various forms, Samuel Adams Boston Lager is always a tasty, light, refreshing lager easily within reach be it at concert venues, humble gas stations, or the dreaded Red Lobster."
"Taste is similar. Lager, but off a little. Surpassingly easy to drink. Not as good as my memories of it, & not what I want now, but it'll always be my old gateway beer."
"Had this one on tap a few times,but i think i like it better from the bottle,brownish amber with decent tan head that left sticky lacing,Nose was refreshing clean with the malts coming thru mild herbs and hints of pine,taste was not as good as it smelled but went down rather easily,the malts and spice's and a tinge of pine was all there but still it seemed flat and dull,nonethe less i kept trying this on tap and got the same results,i got a little more kick from the ones in bottles,had this one at ESPN in Disneyland and all the games on the tube helped this go down quite easily."
"Drinkability is fairly high. Low alcohol and decent flavor makes this brew easy to consume."
"Since the selection at Devlin's in Brighton Center isn't too great, I alternate between Long Trail and Sam. Last weekend, it was Sam's turn. Ordered a pint, and I am always surprised at how little head bartenders pour. Oh well. Reddish brown color with minimal carbonation. Kinda dry on the palate. This beer, though, has a nice balance of flavor and ingredients that of course has helped this brew become as popular and ubiquitous as it is. This lager is one of the better stand-by beers out there. When the selection sucks, you'll always find Sam Lager. Always comes through in the end. Could be worse I guess..."
"pours a nice golden color with a creamy white head fading but not gone. the aroma has some nice floral notes that compliment the lager esters quite nicely. the taste is a bit heavily weighted toward the malt, but the bitterness is still there a bit at teh end. the mouthfeel is a bit heavy, but still very drinkable. looks like it's right on as far as the style goes."
"One of the first ""real"" beers I ever tried. I'm not sure that there has been a time that this beer has not been in my fridge. Though many better beers have come along I'm not sure they would have had it not been for Sam Adams!"
"Sam Adams' flagship beer... Good stuff..."
"Great drinkability and a great session beer. This is always a welcome sight when there is nothing else better available. One of my earliest craft beers."
"Very good beer. Funny, when reading the reviews, people actually seem to be apologizing for liking this. It proves that mass-produced US beer can actually be good. Thank goodness for Jim Koch. You can travel the country and go where Bud is king and still find this as an alternative (i.e. ""Give me the darkest beer you've got""). Never disappoints. Funny, I find that I drink this less often than usual (I get it in restaurants, but don't buy 6-packs) because I want to try different brews. This is not a statement against the beverage, but rather familiarity. If you haven't tried it (and live in the US) -- well, what planet have you been on?"
"Great aroma and a memorable taste. I could just sit and smell this beer and be okay. I'm not one to write a detailed review yet (noob) but I know this is a great beer. This is the one I find myself craving during the day. It's is a unique lager and will be a go to beer for me. Great job Sammy A."
"All in all, a highly drinkable beer. It is light enough to enjoy in summer, but complex and robust enough to last into colder weather months without seeming light a lightweight."
"D- Drinks great, real easy drinking"
"Pours a basic light amber color and produces a decent head. The aroma is of sweet malts and even a touch of caramel malts. Although present the aroma isn't very strong which is fine by me. Overall great flavor with this lager. The sweet malts really stand out and provide a great drinking experience. This is one of my go to beers during a nice meal out or wherever since most establishments have it on tap."
"Tastes like flowery hops as well, balanced out by the malts, this isn't an overly complex beer, but it is excellent. I used to think this was the hoppiest beer in the world (that was before I ever tried an IPA). This is definitely one to be had on the tap as it is much better than the bottled version. I will admit that part of the reasoning behind my high rating is the fact that such a good beer can be found practically anywhere. It's definitely my fallback beer when nothing else is to be found, but even then it's one worth having when there are other options as I think it is quite good."
"Among beers that are widely distributed, easy to find, and inexpensive, Samuel Adams Boston Lager is almost impossible to beat. It has one of the best noses of any beer, with a superb floral hop aroma. The color is just right, the head is well structured, and thus the lacing on the glass is perfect. The flavor is bold enough, with just the right amount of bitterness at the end, to satisfy with a single mug; but, it is smooth enough and reasonably low in alcohol to function well as a session beer. That's why I generally drink it by the pitcher with friends."
"Bought of a twelve pack of this brew more so to get the bottles for my first home brew. I knew this was a fairly tasty beer at a fair price. It poured an amberish brown color with nice white head and had nice lacing. The smell was of a little hops. The taste was malty up front with a nice clean hoppy finish. Mouthfeel was medium to light with a good amount of carbonation. Drinkibility is very good on this beer, they slide down nicely."
"www.theviceblog.com"
"D: Refreshing but tasty. Nothing that blows you away."
"This is a rather ubiquitous beer. Though it is contract brewed it does a pretty job of remaining somewhat consistent, though there have been times I've noticed variation. I don't mind variation as long as it is for the better, not when a mediocre batch is mixed in with the good. For an American lager this beer has a great hop aroma that isn't found anywhere else for a beer this widely distributed. I love the amber color. The taste continues the hop theme though the malts make a balanced and tasty appearance. This is simply a good lager and one that I'm always happy to have."
"Overall this is an excellent flagship lager for the Boston Beer Company. It has honest to goodness flavor, it's hoppy without being overly bitter, and is a great way to introduce non-craft beer drinkers to the world of good beer. Nicely done."
"Drinkability: This is a session beer 100%, a reliable, affordable choice. A classic."
"Now ... I've got to get back to my pint; it's not going to drink itself."
"It's dependable, it's delicious, and sometimes, it's the gentle Hallertau wallop I need."
"This is a pretty good rendition of a Vienna Lager. I bought a 12 pack of this one because the price was right. I seem to have gotten a good deal on some great beer."
"Easy drinking beer. Always a good choice when the only other beer the bar serves is the big 3. Glad to see this on tap often."
"Definetly recommend this beer."
"I recommend this beer year round and will probably put it on tap this fall or winter as the lighter option."
"Smell is an impressive shot of Hallertau hops. Bready malt under notes. Taste is quite hoppy up front, with some tannic tea-like flavoring. Dry biscuity malt character. Clean finish and very enjoyable. It's no surprise this one does so well."
"D: I can and did have quite a few of these. Cheers to the craft brewer who sprouted from the homebrewer roots."
"Pours a clear amber with a medium tan head. Smells of piney hops. Taste is of caramelized malt, with a nice amount of piney, floral hop flavor to match. Impressive bitterness levels. Mouthfeel is smooth, carbonation levels somewhat high. Highly drinkable, a great beer to drink any time of the year."
"D: Very. Nice session beer that pairs well with food."
"Again, this is just tastier on tap. I could (and did) drink this stuff all night."
"D: Still a solid brew. I'll glaldy take it anyday over the average offerings at a sports bar or any place else that just gets the job done with their selection."
"D - As far as I'm concerned, there is a 3-way tie for the title of ""America's Beer"" - this, SNPA, and Anchor Steam. Basically a near-flawless, tasty lager, underrated due to its wide availability. I'm thankful for that, as Boston Lager tends to save the day time and time again. Always a good call."
"M/D - Very well carbonated, almost too much. Medium bodied and very crisp. A very drinkable beer."
"D: Average. Although this has been pretty well billed as a beer to drink year round, I remember drinking it outside during the summer once, and it felt very out of place. That bitter sharpness really limits its drinkability- I'd find it hard to quaff another with that kind of character."
"Reminds me alot of the Boston ale I just had minus the yeasty notes... this brew is a picture of summer drinking."
"Served into a frosted pint glass. Copper with a good amount of carbonation. Two fingered head, soapy with like a caramel swirl.The aroma has a spice/malt scent.The taste is sweet with a slight floral hop bitterness. As the beer warmed the flavors were not as good. Creamy but thin. Drink it cold and fast. Not bad but I would prefer something else."
"Appearance is light amber with a thin white head. It has a strong smell of floral hops and a hint of wheat. The taste starts off somewhat malty with just a hint of honey, and it ends up being bitter. Very carbonated, crisp. This is a drinkable lager that can go with almost any food. Typically the one craft beer available in a sea of macros at a lot of the more generic establishments."
"Not a bad Ale, though not my favorite beer either. Had a semi sweet malty taste to it with a slight rust finish with maybe a hint of cinnamon in there. The taste was also a bit less strong then I had hoped as well. Appearance was slightly red. The beer was fairly carbonated and the bubbles were noticeable. It was fairly drinkable though and I could drink a couple."
"I freakin' love it. Light amber color. Monster white head exploding with hop aroma. Perfectly nice zingy carbonation to carry that aroma up to you. Sweet maltiness balanced by plenty of hops. This beer just flat out kicks ass. Very satisfying, a little filling. My favorite is to get a freshly tapped one in a 22oz glass. Any day I get one of those babies is a great day."
"A rather hoppy vienna lager, I like it."
"D: A really nice beer, with an excellent aroma and a good balance of malts and hops. This is a perfect go-to beer."
"Over the years, I've found this beer to be a saving grace at weddings, airports, entertainment venues, and open-bars everywhere."
"Great American Lager."
"Not only is this a great beer to ween your friends off of the mass produced offerings, but its a great standby as its availability is very widespread."
"Much better, the malty goodness of a Boston lager. I like this better than their Boston Ale. Recently, I heard on a radio talkshow that people who order this beer at the bar are posers for some reason. One ,the person who said this is a moron. Two, Has he thought that people actually want to taste their beer rather than having alcoholic water like Carona, Budwieser, and Miller. Great Commercial Bee"
"Drinkability is off the charts; this is the #1 craft beer in America for a reason. It is smooth, yet complex; malt/hop balance accessible enough for all beer drinkers, whether new to craft beers, or seasoned veterans to all beer styles. Absolutely sessionable for any occasion."
"A beer that makes you want to take your time and enjoy the moment."
"Simply put, a good beer. I'll drink more."
"Finishes somewhat dry but could be crisper for the style and my tastes. All in all, I think it's delicious because of the sweetness of the malt and diacetyl, but I think the slightly syrupy finish hurts its drinkability. Better for a wintery session than a summertime BBQ, and I certainly prefer Brooklyn Lager or Dos Equis."
"Ah, Sammy, my good ol' stand by. It looks smooth, it pours smooth, it foams smooth, it goes down smooth, it just all around smooth. Plenty of hops give this brew an exceptional flavor that doesn't offend at all, perfect balance. And with it available many places nowadays, I'm happy to go to almost any pub."
"This particular bottle in front of me, however, is less impressive. Golden color with just a slight amber hue. Hop presence can be whiffed but isn't as present as before; subdued in the taste as well. As for the malts... The malts in this actually are skunky, grassy, with a little bit of popcorn minus the butter (odd I know) and actually remind me of a euro pilsner. Not happy with this one."
"Pours a burnt amber witha a nice three fingers of cream colored head that is chunky as it falls to a thin cap while leaving tons of stickyness.The nose is nice and sweet with hints of floral hops and subtle cinnamon.Boston Lager has some good flavors,not super complex,but,it helps with drinkability.This is malty/caramely sweet and mildly bitter with some spicy hops shining through helping to create a nice balance,I still detect some hidden cinnamon(almost cinnamon toast like,in a way).This is a great brew to keep around when you are in need of flavor and consumability."
"D: Boston Lager is a little bit heavy to be a highly sessionable, but it's a solid beer. There seems to be just a bit missing from the flavor, but it's still a good beer."
"a staple in the history of american craft beer"
"Notes: It tastes good even as it warms and can be a good beer for session. I have it from time to time and I enjoy it."
"Had this one about a million times, but figured I'd actually do a bottle review. Pours a copper color with a fine head that dissolves quickly down to nothing. Okay but not particularly impressive to look at. Nose is mild hoppiness, a bit of fruit and malt. Taste is similar; some light graininess, piney hops, and some crisp fruit in there as well. Body is solid, although nothing too impressive. Might have to experiment a bit more, but is seems possible that I prefer this one on tap, although it's certainly a solid brew (and better than all the BMC out there in a landslide) in the bottle as well."
"D - Could be a session beer, but there are better choices for this. A good beer overpowered by great ones."
"D = Very high. Extremely refreshing at the end of a long day. By American standards, a good session beer."
"D- Yes. Drinking this is always a good call. I remember my first boston lager and being blown away at how flavorful it was compared the the junk I was drinking back then."
"This brew pours a clear brownish color with a decent light tan head. The nose has some sweet grainy malts and faint hops. The taste also holds some faint bitter hops over a bed of mild malts. The body has good carbonation and an average lager body. A drinkable beeer, but a bit over priced."
"At this rate we'll have Sam Adams Boston Water by 2015. Bon Soir..."
"A real winner in the Sam Adams lineup."
"Cheers!"
"D- Incredibly easy to drink and easy to find."
"D: Drink it. For mass produced this is good stuff. Never a bad call as they say."
"I'm at a loss as to how this beer is so well loved. Maybe a bit richer than macrolagers, but not very appealing. A little bit boring and a little bit unappetizing. Excessive bitterness and a metallic mineral taste put me off quite a bit. BBC has much better offerings than this."
"I tried this beer on December 20, 2007 at ""Smokeless Joe's"" in Toronto. The beer poured a dark translucent gold colour with a 0.5 inch white head. The aroma was very weak with some barely discernable hoppy notes. The mouthfeel was medium bodied with some mild carbonation. The flavour was alright with no strong overpowering flavours. Very drinkable, but nothing special."
"I much prefer this beer on-tap."
"I could definitely drink a few of these."
"Easy to drink,well balanced with a fair amount of body and flavor. You can find on tap at about any bar now and it makes a good standby."
"Almost everywhere that does not serve micro craft or decent imports I can always look for Boston Lager and I'm satisfied."
"To sum it all up, I don't do lagers very often, but this is excellent. Flavorful and well-balanced... a world-class beer! I think my favorite American beer to date."
"What can I say, It's one of NE's best. This beer has a strong smooth body. The taste is of caramel malts, medium body hops, and a nice lightly bitter after taste. This amber-hued larger is an American classic. It saved America's pride in Germany when it won a gold medal, and it is a favorite of German execs visiting the states. (I heard one remark it's the only American widely-available beer they find palatable) From a German, that's saying something! Thanks Sam, for saving America's international beer pride!"
"With a low ABV and great flavor, this is an ideal session lager for any season."
"I've had this plenty of times over the years and would never complain about the choice, usually a welcomed selection. At the Fort lauderdale Airport I had a pint that poured a clear and lively amber color with a solid white creamy head and fair lacing. The aroma brings on some nutty malt and wheat, a little buttery perhaps. The taste is a clean wheat bread and touch of rye. There's a bit of bitter mash, tangy carbonation and nice body for a refreshing lager. Very drinkable with a minor dryness in the finish. Very solid lager, once again!"
"This is a simple but pleasant beer. I don't drink this all the time, but I have never been disappointed."
"Always a good choice. The Boston lager pours a beautiful golden amber color with great clarity. On top sits a thick white head that leaves good lacing on the glass. A wonderful floral and piney hops fills the nose and leads you to the first sip. The taste is full of these floral and piney hops from start to the finish. The malt character is bready, lightly roasted and hold the hops in perfect balance. The palate has medium body and a smooth texture with average carbonation. Sam Adams finishes with a nice hopy fade. Cheers!"
"Prost!"
"I have heard a lot about Sam Adams Boston lager and never quite got a chance to try it until recently. I did not love this beer although it seems to have a very dedicated following. While there are better American beers out there, I have no problem with Sam Adams representing the American market."
"This was the first beer I had on my trip to the USA last year - and the first of many excellent brews while I was there, and they told me that American beer was awful. Anyway, I had the opporunity to get my hands on some more when a friend went to Munich and picked me up a load. In the glass, the beer formed a beautiful head, about an inch thick which lasted right to the very last mouthful. Taste wise I think this beer is the dream ticket of Bohemian lagers, smooth and malty, like a blend of Plzensky Prazdroj and Budvar."
"This will be my default American Lager. I would gladly serve it to my European friends. An American beer that you can be proud of."
"Mouthfeel is effervescent and firm-bodied. Finish is very crisp. This beer gets kind of boring to me halfway through the glass, so I wouldn't use it to session."
"No glass particles encountered throughout. A shame S.A. got let down by one of their glass suppliers, but good on Jim Koch for doing the right thing and recalling the entire lot of jillions of otherwise very tasty beers. Cheers, Jim!"
"Good drinkability, easy to drink and fairly well balanced."
"Fantastically flavoursome, and an allround good beer. I will be buying this again, as I see it as very good value (although I'm sure it would be considerably cheaper in the US). I would probably choose this over any European lager or pilsener. Deserves to be popular in Australia."
"D: I like these for sure. I don't know if I could blast through a ton of them, but they are definitely a great change up from the norm. I like 'em"
"This is so well balanced, and possibly one of the best lagers the world has to offer."
"Bizarrely APAish for a Vienna, except for the spice. Still easy drinking and tasty though."
"D - An excellent beer, could drink it everyday, if I didn't want to try anything else that"
"Served in my Sam Adams Sensory Pint. Best before June notched on the label. Poured a translucent pale amber color with copious effervescence bubbling up through the glass. Half-inch off-white head dissipated within less than a minute leaving behind a thin ring of foam around the perimeter of the glass and a densely clustered swirl in the center. Bouquet of floral hops dominates with a wheat backbone. Taste similar to nose culminates in a clean, crisp finish with just a hint of wheat left lingering on the tastebuds. Lively mouthfeel and well-balanced throughout the mouth. In my opinion SA Boston Lager is one of the most sessionable and versatile brews out there."
"Drinkability- 4.5%, locally available at many bars, and refreshing.. can't complain."
"A great session beer and one that I can fallback on when I am stuck in a strange bar with little craft beer choices."
"Samuel Adams Boston Lager pours a clear, light amber color with a white head that quickly fades away to leave a bit of lacing on the glass. There is some nice caramel on the nose and some grassy hops. The taste is very clean, with sweet caramel and toffee notes up front, some light hop bitterness and breadiness afterwards. The mouthfeel is medium/thin. This is a very drinkable beer and always a good stand-by."
"Smells like sweet malt and bitter hops, the taste is much the same. ALL restaurants around my area have this beer available on tap, and ALL liquor stores around here sell it, so I guess ol' Sammy ain't doin' too bad."
"D - This is always a classic choice if nothing else is available. Usually find it your average restaurants. Make sure you pair it with the right foods though. This beer can easily over power a light dish."
"HV"
"D - Quite refreshing. Goes good with nearly any food you can think of. It could have a bit more presence, but it does just fine."
"An eminently sessionable lager, and an excellent flagship beer from Sam Adams."
"It's got that crisp, tiny bubble carbonation that tingles my tounge a bit. This was never one of my favorite offerings from Sam Adams, but it's really not bad."
"M/D: Very drinkable and I will definitely buy it again as a good sharing beer for doing work around the house. The feel is a little watery but good it helps the drinkability."
"When you're out at a big name grill or restaurant (applebee's, damon's, etc.) that doesn't have a lot of options in the brew category, Sam Adams is probably your best choice. Also, in comparison to other domestic lagers, i rank this slightly above the local favorite: yuengling."
"Recommended."
"D: A classic session beer. Relatively low ABV, good flavor and body. Definitely a drinkable beer."
"Smell is of malts and a little bit of herbal/floral tones. Taste is caramel with subtle but ever present hops; nice body, easy finish, mild bitterness."
"Great mouthfeel, there is a nice carbonation to this beer that makes it clean and sharp. There is nothing else getting in the way of the brew's flavors. An excellent anytime beer."
"D - Overall this is one of the more drinkable and widely available beers that is out there and is also one of the first steps that most people take from BMCs to the craft beers. This would be a beer that I think you should definitely have at a party for people to drink up with. I thought it was a bit thick to drink a ton of or with a meal but overall a tasty brew that I think you could always easily find and pickup whenever company is coming over. A good summertime beer for sure."
"D - Refreshing, but a bit on the light side, very easy to drink."
"Notes: Great choice at the bars that don't cater to my exotic taste."
"Very sessionable due to the 4.75% abv. Goes down easy. The satisfying finish makes it easy to pick up and have another sip. Better learn to like this one anyway, since it's the best beer at lots of lesser establishments, and sometimes the most adventurous your friends will get if you're getting pitchers. Also good to re-familiarize myself with this one since so many of the other SA beers have so much in common with the flagship brew. Worth revisiting on occasion."
"I'm glad I was given another shot at Sam Adams."
"Nothing not to like here. Readily available brew from a world-class company. Nothing extreme here, but you know what you are getting and it is hands down the best mass produced lager you will find in the U.S."
"Drinkability: Very high. Not the most complex or most delicious beer out there, but a very good beer. It's mix of nice flavor, lightness, and lower ABV make for a beer you could drink several of before you realized it. Very good beer, excellent lager."
"Drinkability is outstanding for any beer with the complexity of flavors that this beer has. Overall, I wouldn't recommend that it's easy for everybody to drink, but it's pretty close to a perfect lager. Outstanding as a one-of or a session beer, but has a few flaws that prevent it from being a truly exceptional beer in every sense."
"Mouthfeel is nice very smooth does not stick around to long, carbonation is a nice balance as well. Very drinkable, could easily have 3 more."
"Really drinkable. Low abv and a mild yet flavorful balance make it a great sessionable beer. Not overly attractive as a stand out beer, but extremely consumable for what it is, a staple on-hand beer."
"A bit too heavy for a lager for my taste with this taste profile"
"This is a lager I can actually drink."
"Again - don't consider this a Vienna - but avery tasty american lager."
"A clear, light amber colored brew waits patiently in the pint glass with decent head. The aroma is slightly toasted malt, sweetness, and a light dose of hops. Light and pleasantly carbonated, the flavors are slightly sweet, but definitely malty with a mild finish of refreshing hops. Overall a great, drinkable and classic brew."
"I can't really sip this beer. When one is presented in front of me, I have to drink and enjoy the flavor, repeat immediately."
"Overall, a pretty solid but not too interesting beer. One of the better lagers I've had."
"This sammy pours a bright clear golden orange with a pretty big, rocky white head. Malty nose, vienna toasted, with some herby floral hop sweetness. The taste is malty as well. Toasted, grainy, smooth, clean, a bit of sweetness, a bit of bitterness, a bit dry, a bit crispy, a bit watery. Definitely an enjoyable lager."
"D: A terrific session beer, more would be nice!"
"D: Drinkability is good. Anybody could session this one."
"D: Nice beer for a night of bar pool. The low ABV, balanced flavor, and low ABV make this a contender for a session beer."
"Extremely drinkable. A great session beer. Full bodied and flavorful, but not too filling."
"I'm gonna re-visit the aroma on this one. I poured another one into a larger mug and I gotta say the aroma is a knockout. For a beer that has this distribution, and sheer volume, this one has an awesome aroma."
"This is a great lager. It smells of sweet malts and floral hops. The taste is sweet, but also spicy and floral with a perfect lager finish. It's very drinkable, I could easily have many in one sitting. Very well-made, a new classic."
"On tap last night at dinner. Brought to me in a pint glass with just a touch of a sudsy white head resting on top of the hazy orangeish color body. Smell is of very sweet malty cookie like scent with some caramel and a little bit of spices. Taste is very sweet with just a hint of the hops coming through as well. Mouthfeeling is very smooth and light."
"While my tastes have evolved through the years, this beer doesn't do as much for me as it did upon first discovering better beer. That being said I still love the fact that it can be found everywhere from grocery stores, to bars.. to chain restaurants. Due to that one is assured of more often than not having access to a nice drinkable beer and sometimes one can't ask for much more."
" overall a very good , drinkable beer."
"I just love a fresh pint of this beer. The malts and hops are well balanced and always give off a clean crisp taste that makes the drinkibility huge. Just a perenniel favorite in my book and always a go to beer for me."
"This beer goes great with good friends and a fireplace. Interesting to see what type of pizza this beer goes best with. You know what? On second thought this beer might go splendidly with fish and chips. Don't forget the malt vinegar!"
"d - this is it right here. The beer that started it all for me. It's interesting to keep coming back to this beer as my palate gets more sophisticated. It continues to get better as I notice more things. It's widely available and so easy to drink. I don't think it gets any better for drinkability."
"A very good beer, but what is amazing is how good it is for a mass produced beer. Aroma is moderate toasted ceral malts as well as pine and citrus malts. Pour yeilds a frothy off-white head that has very good lacing for the market. The head stays around for a while. The flavor is still great, but a bit more watery than I remember. A bit over carbonated. By far my favorite common beer that you can get anywhere!"
"I like Sam Adams. When I was new to beer I really didn't like it. Nowadays it's a good go-to beer. I great lager."
"Drinkability is good. Not outstanding, but good. Just a nice, pleasant, all-around beer, and a classic that you should never be embarrassed to bring a sixer of to any party."
"This beer is very good, i prefer it on tap with a meal. I've had it with many types of food and have had no problems in pairing it with food."
"Bottle at Chilis in Sacramento. Nice amber color with a medium lasting white head. Tastes like an amber beer with a hoppy bitterness, and a bit of maltiness. Finish is a bitter bite that has a medium length. Overall a nice hop aroma, and overall beer with a slight hop and bitter bite to it. Very decent."
"Overall, this brew is good. Its cheap and has a nice flavor."
"Pours a nice copper color with a foamy, 2 finger head that settles into a thin lacing. Modest carbonation. Aroma is sweet & malty with hints of caramel. Taste is an almost perfect balance of malty sweetness mixed with piney, grapefruity hops all swirled together. The finish is dry & bitter, with the pine & grapefruit notes being dominant. Mouthfeel is a medium fullness. Overall, a very good beer. This is very much deserving of it's iconic status in the craft world. I can't understand why so many people want to put this beer (and the others in the Samuel Adams family) down. Why?? Because it's become so successful & mainstream? Because it's gone from a small, one man operation to a high volume player in the beer world, thereby becoming ""too big & macro-like""? Bullcrap!!! If the boys at the big 3 brewed something this good, the beer world would be 10 times better off!!! Give this brew, & this compamy, it's proper respect!!!"
"I drank this beer with some salty pasta and it was perfect. It cut the saltiness and seemed to enhance the flavor of the pasta. The aroma was lightly floral with a hint of maltiness, which also seemed to go well with the pasta. All in all, this is pretty good stuff and I really did enjoy it."
"The only thing I don't agree with is the commercial that says hops are to beer as grapes are to wine--that makes almost no sense to me--you don't ferment sugars from hops--only from barley. I would say grapes are more like grain--hops are the spice."
"D- It's a good beer at a restaraunt or bar... I prefer this brew on tap, and most places have it... I like Sam Adams' approach to brewing, and helping create a national movement towards REAL beer"
"D-Boston Lager can stand on its own, or accompany a wide array of foods. This is one of my favorite accompaniments when I eat anywhere that has a limited beer selection. That's why I love this brewery...they're small enough to make excellent beer, and large enough to be found anywhere."
"Notes: In my opinion, Boston Beer Company is the best nationally advertised beer company. They're not my favorite brewery by any means, but I don't think you'll find a better brewery that distributes nation-wide on such a large scale."
"A clear, almond color in the glass is quite inviting. A bitter and coriander nose draws you in closer, revealing a taste of bitter hops. Perhaps a bit one-dimensional, but it's a good dimension nevertheless. A smooth finish leaves you pretty satisfied. A great session beer."
"M: Quite crisp and refreshing, a nice 'dinner beer,' or something I would be quite satisfied with for watching a game, or lounging with friends, etc... good session beer, in less words. like a happy balance between some of the American macro breweries and the smaller scale craft brews."
"D - Very drinkable. A low ABV makes for a great session brew for beginner explorers into the world of endless choices!"
"Pours a copperish color with a minimal but frothy head that is constantly carbonating. A somewhat earthy, very hoppy smell that leaves some sweet malt like smell evident. It is hoppy and drying when it first hits the tongue but not overbearing like an IPA might be, and it does finish with some spice and smoothness from that carbonation. A creamy, heavy type body that fills the mouth, this can be a session beer but a few can fill you up. In this case that's a good thing, because I am using that phrase not to slam this beer but slam other beers that it takes a 12-pack to maybe break the seal. My ratings are a little biased because this beer is like a must-have beginner beer and disproves the old joke that American beer is like screwing in a canoe - not very good and close to water."
"Taste is very crisp, strong hop presence but is evened out from the malt. A very decent lager, one of the better commonly available lagers that populate beer stores, although not the first Sam Adams I'd reach for. This is typically the first resort of most restaurants that carry only BMC products, so I really appreciate this beer more than the score indicates."
"Taste is bolder and richer. Mouthfeel is a lot smoother."
"A nice fallback when there is little else to choose from. I'll have it again, but it's down my list of preferred beers and I can't remember the last time I bought a bottle."
"D - This is my beer of choice in dives if they have it. I will drink it all night long."
"i am not a huge sam adams fan, but i must say that this is quite a good beer considering its role in the US market"
"Final statement: What can I say, it's a legendary beer, and a beer all beer geeks should have at least once."
"D- I have got to buy a twelver of these, and try an all nighter. Looking forward to it. There was some effort to make this beer."
"Body is somewhat thin, though the crisp mouthfeel and quaffable texture make up for it. Not the best, but certainly a better option than your standard BMC stuff."
"A small group of us when through 27 of these over New Years, with me being no slouch. I never smelt any alcohol, but some fumes did reach me, especially right as the bottle is first opened. besides that, I can't think of much any fault. With the age of big beers upon us, this beer hasn't faltered at all. :)"
"IMO this beer is perfect for what it is. An easy to drink session beer, a great fallback beer, and a good gateway beer for my BMC buddies."
"D- I can drink a couple of these the only time I get it is when the only other choice is bud."
"This is my go-to beer when I'm at a restaurant that doesn't have much of a beer selection. Thank God BBC has been so successful with this beer so that there's almost always something good to drink at any bar or restaurant."
"Smell is lightly sweet from the malt and hops, not very overpowering. Taste is similar, very lightly sweet with a nice level of bitterness. Dry, light, crisp. Carbonation is moderate and keeps the light body from tasting watery. Can't really find anything wrong with this one, a great beer for pretty much anytime of the year, light, crisp, sessionable. Not my favorite, but very solid."
"Overall- This is a little above average and more than what I expected. This would be the perfect gateway beer for BMC drinkers and would also be a perfect session beer for tailgating or partying."
"Drinkability: Excellent balance, pleasant taste, good mouthfeel. What's not to like? Uncomplicated and approachable without being bland."
"Oh boy, this is the one that got it all started for me. I remember before my first sixer of this I thought Miller Lite had flavor. Getting started, i could only drink a couple of these at a time. I soon got accustomed to the rich flavor that was left on your lips after every delicious drink. This is a bold, flavorful beer with a rich malty flavor and good strong hops. I have tried many brands and types since, but this will probably always be my go to beer."
"I've tried to like this one for years. I still don't. Sorry."
"D: remember when this first really blew up and it was prized still. Great session beer when you are drinking with ""normies"""
"overall a great beer and something thats nice for a mainstay."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into a Sam Adams pint glass. Poured a clear amber with a large off white head. Left slight lacing down the glass. Aroma is of bread, malts, and a subtle nuttiness. Tastes is bready that flows nicely into the malts and ends with just a bit of hops. A well-balanced beer. Light bodied and nicely carbonated. A easily sessionable beer."
"This beer poured a light copper with gold highlights and a two-finger head. The nose is all malts with a tad bit of hops. The taste starts off with some sweet maltiness followed by some breadiness that is cut nicely in the finish by the hops. The mouthfeel and drinkability are average. This is nothing to write home about, but is a nice example of the style that is always worth a look. You don't need to rock the boat in order to be worth grabbing every so often, as this beer shows."
"Pours a crystal clear light amber color with a nice off white head with good retention. Smells very crisp, some malts, some bread, light hop spice. Taste is extremely crisp and refreshing. Toasted grains, good hop presence as well in the finish. Slight breadiness, light toffee/caramel. Light and crisp, good carbonation. Extremely sessionable."
"Soft snow-white inch-thick head in a lager glass; beatuiful Brussels lace on the tracings....body shifts in light from brown-orange to orange-yellow--affecting...for a lager, quite hoppy...the balance is attractive...full-bodied and effervescent body...outstanding mouthfeel holds the tongue and lays the flavor on...best compliment to a lager: you could down a 12-pack easily (in any month or season), but the taste makes you slow down in respect...Ive had this at parties too many times IN A BOTTLE, which sucked much of my ambition to drink it; in a glass, however, as a session beer, MUCH different--and my brother Jer tells me in the specially engineered glass Sam Adams sells, the bouquet and experience are multiplied exponentially...tough to believe after half a glass. And I NEVER call out others tastes, but after looking at the average rating on this site, I cannot imagine what other beer drinkers are looking for...I apologize to Mr. Koch and all his staff. Beautiful job, gentlemen."
"D - Very drinkable lager, a world class beer . A testament to Jim Koch's Grandfather's skill in recipe making. Very Quaffable, sessionable strength and easy drinking lager. This is one widely available beer that is actually worth drinking."
"Poured from bottle into pint glass. Pours a deep golden color, crystal clear with nice two-finger head and good retention and lacing. Looks like a good ""American"" beer. Smell is of hops mainly, some malt. Both smells are somewhat muted however and not too dominant (like an IPA for example). Taste is good I would say but does not stand out. When compared to a macro it is great, but compared to many crafts I find it somewhat bland. A touch of caramel and some hops, it leaves a somewhat hoppy and oily feeling in the mouth after each sip. Nice, light, and crisp, an easy drinker. While this isnt my favorite beer, it is a great alternative to many others and widely available."
"D - An excellent beer, could drink it everyday, if I didn't want to try anything else that is."
"Drinkability: Great with meals and great to have a couple during a ballgame, but it's quite heavy and can be a bit much if you're drinking in a full session. Really unsettles your stomach if you have more than a few, even spread out over time."
"D - One of the beers that first brought me into craft brewing. Ny usual go to beer when at a bar that doesn't carry many craft beer choices."
"Overall my favorite easily accessible craft beer"
"Sam Adams Boston Lager is (in my opinion) a great example of how a lager should drink. The color is is deep but clear. The beer pours well and when poured correctly the smell of hops is clean and crisp. When drinking it goes down easy but still tastes like a beer should. So whether it's out of the bottle for a session or on the tap at a local restaurant this is definitely a staple beer that can usually be found on tap when most other beers won't do."
"Overall: Clean and refreshing but there is not too much going on with this brew. However it is a good session beer."
"D - This is my cheap everyday beer. It's great for any occasion."
"D - Very Drinkable. A definate BYOB. Not too strong so it is something I could take to a get-to-gether as a Sixer."
"drinkability - My typical choice if I do out somewhere to eat. Goes with anything."
"pours into a sam adams boston lager glass a nice amber with a finger of frothy head leaving some nice lacing down he glass. The smell is light and balanced with malt grain and a hint of hops. The flavor is not complex, but subtle and pleasant with a solid grain and malt backbone, and some hops that linger long after swallowed. Mouthfeel is average for the size of the beer, and quite drinkable. At least this is a pretty good beer because it is available every where around here"
"Drinkablity is a about average. If I'm at some type of chain restaurant with limited selection, I'd just assume have a German larger for the same price, but it's light enough in body and ABV to be able to really throw them back with ease. But I've only ever done that when there wasn't much else, like a wedding or BBQ. Still, I give them credit for really ushering in the American craft brew revolution."
"Drinkability: Great brew. Perfect beer for when you just want a good, quality brew to enjoy. Consistently classic."
"I probably speak for a lot of people when I say this is the brew that got me into quality beers. If it wasn't for Sam Adams Boston Lager, I'd still be chugging macro lagers. If you're trying to get friends to appreciate better beers, this is a great introductory brew."
"This is a classic. A nice malty and toasty smell. Taste has roasted nutty malt flavors, supported by some hop balance in the background. Nice full smooth mouthfeel. Nothing earth-shattering, but quite solid and widely available, and often the best choice at many bars."
"D - Easy drinkable beer. Good for just chilling out when needed. Not something to overly enjoy, but easy enough to drink during a football game or some quick social event."
"Amber colored lager with a sweet bread aroma.Taste is also of sweet bread.This is a good lager that goes down smoothly and is enjoyable from first to last gulp.Moderate ABV ensures that you can comfortably drink a six pack! One of the most popular lagers around probably because both micro and macro drinkers like this stuff."
"D - Excellent. I could drink only this beer for the rest of my days and be content, if a little bored! Not overly alcoholic, so this makes a good session beer. Great all year round - a chameleon for every season."
"I love this beer, probably because it's the best beer I can get just about anywhere. Almost always get it in a pint glass, but pretty good out of the bottle as well. Great color and clarity that holds a decent head. Great smell with an excellent hop balance. Very tasty, but doesn't need to be quite so sweet. Very smooth, but could stand to feel a little heavier in the mouth. Still, it's a beer I enjoy getting pretty much all the timem"
"My first real memory of a beer that was brewed for all the right reasons. This has led me to try many different beers and ales (just joking). Although I had tried the Pilsner Urquell, Heineken, and other beers over the years (and I regret that I do not remember if any of them were ales), the marketing and smaller brewery explosion thankfully brought this to my attention."
"I'm not a huge fan of regular 'ol Sam Adams when anything else is really available, but it's a great session beer choice for non-BMC, non-adventurous beer drinkers. I'd have again if it were the best available."
".... WIlly"
"d: decent for what essentially is a macro lager but overall nothing special; though it could be a good session beer"
"my favorite all time sam adams style! one of the first beers i tried personally that wasnt steriotypical light american stuff. love hops? you will love this beer has a flowery aroma and a great hoppy taste. kind of reminds me of a weaker version of stones IPA ruination which isnt necessarily a bad thing because its about half as expensive too. i have yet to try all the sam adams styles but like i say this is the most consistant and as they say always a good decision! go get some"
"Drinkability - Very drinkable, nice, well balanced flavor and smell. Definitely something I could drink in multiples."
"Overall this is one of my favorite Vienna Lagers along with Negra Modelo...this beer is constant and true throughout the whole experience, highly recommended"
"An American classic. If there was such thing as a perfect beer this would be one of them."
"This is a nice lager. It pours a nice amber color from the bottle with a white head that sticks to the sides of the glass long after it's gone. It has a rich malty and hoppy aroma that is what a lager should smell like. The taste is no different. Excellent taste. Very smooth blend of the roasted malts and hops. It has exceptional mouthfeel and tastes good the entire experiece. A very good drinkable beer."
"D: I had a couple of the 22 ounces eating out the other night. I paired this beer with some really spicy jerk sauce sauteed shrimp with plantains. It was awesome and if I wanted to stay another half hour I would've ordered another one. Good beer."
"Poured into a pint glass pours a clear, copper color with a big off white head, some lacing down the glass. Smell is the sam adams hops with some bread, and caramel in the mix. Taste is bit hoppy with toasty malts. Mouthfeel is thin but easy to drink and a great session beer."
"The presentation is very good, a deep, clear golden color that almost has a tinge of orange. The head is two fingers thick, and laces the glass nicely as the beer is consumed. The taste is bold, hoppy and moderately carbonated, but smooth and easy to consume. It compares quite favorably with Molson Canadian Lager (which I find pretty decent) in terms of flavor and appearance. A very good steady, and great to come back to after several months away."
"I know some BA's knock this onw because its not rare or amazing but I love it. If I am in a bar that I don't think has a lot to choose from sam adams is the first word out of my mouth. Its avalible as convenence stores and gas stations. Its not too expensive and tastes good for what you pay. Its also a great session beer. Also we have a well known craft beer that I think is poised to give BMC a run for their money."
"Poured into a pint glass this has a rich amber color, as expected from a Sam Adams Lager. There was a 1/2in creamy white head that lasted for a while along with nice lacing. There is a very sweet caramel and spice smell to match the rich color. This beer has a medium body with lighter carbonation. There was a slight bitter after taste with a hint of yeast, but smooth. This is a very well made beer. I have been very pleased with all the Sam Adams I have been trying from my variety pack."
"I just can't session this thing. I appreciate its qualities. The hop aroma is awesome and the hop flavor is OK but I just can't drink it. It oddly fills me up very quickly. I can't explain it."
"STILL SOLID AFTER ALL OF THESE YEAR'S. GREAT JOB JIM. EVERY BAR IN AMERICA SHOULD CARRY SAM ADAM'S !!!"
"I do like this beer. Not the best out there but a good option."
"D - This beer is clearly intended to showcase malt and it does so quite well. I can't say it is a terribly interesting beer, or one that I would actively seek out; but I have to give it points for the countless times it has saved me in america's many craft beer deserts."
"poured amber-golden. a one finger, frothy, off-white head. smelled of apples. taste was bitter and fermented fruit. left a little lacing as it went down. finished slightly dry. good, mild carbonation. kind of watery. average drinkability. i expected something better taste-wise."
"d: this lager has a good balance of malt and hops and provides a refreshingly smooth beer that goes down easy, but has enough complexity to remain interesting."
"Drinkablity: Pretty good drinkability I could drink a number of these if I had the chance."
"The taste of sweet malt is highlighted with just a hint of hops. Not a complicated beer but it is well balanced and well made. Nice carbonation and finishes clean. Nothing really stands out about the beer but it can be found just about everywhere and with its low alcohol, it won't sneak up on you. I prefer several other SA offerings to this one."
"This is a very drinkable brew. I wasn't always a fan of this brew probably due to it's slightly watery quality but it has grown on me. Still, I think this brew is way over-hyped, just my opinion."
"This beer is incredibly well balanced and very easy drinking. There is nothing flashy about it, it's just a quality, good tasting beer. I am thankful that, no matter where you go, it seems you can usually find one of these. I will surely have many more."
"A dark golden pour is the appearance for this breweries' staple. With a rich, hearty smell of light hops and citrus, this is probably the most accessible beer from Sam Adams. Its crisp, light taste is not as typical as other forms of beer. Not that it is ""common"" beer; the beer's nice and simple balance gives it a winning formula. The beer has a strong presence while being very accessible to all beer tastes."
"While I am never hesitant to say that I don't like this beer, as a thanks to Jim Koch for the 2 free glasses, I figured I'd give the beer it was designed for it's fair chance in the glass. Pours a deep gold almost amber with a decent head that diminishes to a thin layer. A decent amount of sweet malt comes through even as the glass gets less full, but there's not much else to the aroma besides sweet malt. The taste is more of the same, with some citrus hops poking through from the background. The beer is light bodied and very crisp, but that does not make up for the lack of flavor. While I will admit, the glass does bring out more from this beer than I have noticed in the past, there still isn't that much to it in my opinion."
"the fourth sample of the collection pours a clear golden color w/ a slight white head that lasts, plenty of lacing ; huge hop nose w/ some faint malt aroma; plenty of hops here too, some malt flavor comes through w/ a faint diacytl undertone, not quite balanced, definitely too hoppy for a vienna; light-med body, a little thin for the flavor; not really something i could drink alot of.."
"Pours a dark golden color with an off white head that leaves lacing on my glass. The smell is of nutty malts. Taste is bitter and hoppy but not overwhelming. Good amount of carbonation good body. Overall this is a good beer not as good as the other beers in the collection. Its still a good beer thats widely available so its a good stand by beer."
"It's so good because not only is it refreshing and versatile, but it has a great amount of flavor to it. You can't go wrong with it."
"Drinkability- Not bad. This is the type of beer that can be a standard ""beer fridge"" beer."
"Another fairly simple beer that gets the job done with little fuss. Nice lighter golden amber pour with good carbonation and a decent head. Some lacing though a thin layer was formed within a couple minutes. Smell was great. Sweet malts and behind them a burst of hops. Taste is much of the same. Caramel malt flavor and the hops shine again. A little bitter and somewhat earthy hops along with citrus. Good, steady mouthfeel. Not a dry finish and sits very well. A good and drinkable brew here."
"To be honest, this was the first American beer I've ever had, and it was a pleasant surprise. I had low expectations considering its a mainstream lager, but it is something I would gladly have again. Would make for a solid session beer."
"The pricing of this, along with most of the other ""Sam Adams"" lineup, is abominable. We're looking at a mediocre to average beer that costs more than comparable, true ""craft"" offerings."
"An easy beer to put down and also a nice choice when out at bars or sporting events that have a limited selection. I think I had my first Sam Adams twenty years and figued I might as well review it."
"Could drink a whole lot of these, but they are a little heavy"
"Poured this beer out of a 12oz bottle into a pint glass, Poured a dark amberish color with a 1 finger creamy colored head. The smell was a bit hoppy with a hint of wheat. The taste was of hops, and very light mouth feel. Over all this beer was of good quality. I would definatly pick this one up in a pinch and drink it."
"Overall- A good medium bodied beer that is easy to drink during any season. A solid offering. Availability makes this a nice option at the chain restaurants and places not known for expansive tap lists."
"If I were going to go to the store and just pick up a six-pack of a basic lager, this would be the one! It was certainly good at my work picnic get-together from last night. It has a very nice color, ranging from a nice dark tan to copper, depending on the lighting. I very much enjoy its aroma, very strong without overpowering. although it goes down smooth, it's definitely not a chugging beer. It has a wonderfully complex taste and would be the perfect beer to convince your friends who make fun of craft/micro-brewery drinkers that they need to reevaluate their stance."
"Smooth and medium bodied. Lively carbonation."
"Had this on tap tonight. I'm not going to break this beer down..it's probably the backbone of most people's finer beer experience. This is in my opinion the best lager out there. It has a good clean, dry taste with just the right amount of maltiness and hoppiness that balances perfectly. This beer is the only logical selection to make at most resteraunts where it's this or BMC."
"One of my favorite lagers on the market today. I have to say I love this lager as much as almost any ale out there. It drinks well, it pours well, and it tastes great. It's available almost everywhere so make it a point to go out and pick up a six pack and enjoy!"
"The color on old Sammy was orange with a decent fluffy head. Smells faintly earthy, tastes muddy and also lager-like clean at same time. This is much better than macro lagers by far but I prefer ales so I would pass this up. Still, a decent beer if you are in a pinch."
"D - I love this beer and could drink it every day. It is hugely flavorful without being over the top in alcohol or hop bitterness."
"Pours a deep amber gold into the pilsner glass. Large bubbled, tightly packed creamy off-white head, leaving a little lacing down the sides of the glass. Aroma is very malty, but a pleasant grassy hoppy flavor does come through. Flavor is caramelly sweet and strongly of toasted malts. A nice floral/citrusey hop presence lasts through to the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is full-bodied and heavy at first, but surprisingly easy to drink. Overall its a decent brew, worth a try. I'm not a big fan of American lagers, but this brew is definitely a step above the commercially brewed American beers. Nothing like those ""other guys."""
"I've had Samuel Adams Boston Lager a few times. The first time I've tasted this brew it was probably my 10th beer of the night, so it was not a good judgment call, but I do distinctly remember it being really heavy, but I dismissed the thought as I figured it was probably because I had drank too much. Under sober conditions, I've found that the 12 oz. bottle pours out an attractive head. Nothing fancy, quite simple in appearance. The smell is strong spices and hops. The taste is quite good, reminds me of real earthy tones and spices, with a good blend of hops. But just like when I was hammered, this brew was filling as all hell. Quite thick and dense for a lager and really makes it hard to go through too many. Overall, I don't think this is Samuel Adams' best brew. They have such a huge selection that I think there's something for everyone, but this lager is just a starting point."
"D: excellent lager. great session beer. has always been a favorite of mine"
"Best before July 07. Got this one a little late but, the taste didn't show it. Poured in to a clear pint glass. Has a rich, deep golden color that most American lagers lack. Nice two finger off white foam head that disappated over time. I got a slight lacing from this beer. Smell is full of hops and barley. One of the hoppiest American lagers I have ever tried. Taste is full flavor that did not let me down. You can really taste the hops and a slight bitterness that blends together perfectly. The feel is about average but thats not the most important aspect to me. This is a very drinkable, well rounded beer. Very smooth. It has taken it's place as being my favorite American lager."
"This one is easy to drink. Used to be one of my favorites but has fallen due to some other beers."
"Not a bad lager at all. It doesn't make me very excited, but it's a good session brew."
"Oh yeah, it went real well with my bratwurst and sauerkraut. Wish I had another..."
"still, it's an easy-drinking classic, and for better or worse, a constant symbol of pride for new england."
"Looking forward to reviewing the rest..."
"Very smooth and very drinkable. One of my favorite session beers for it's drinkablity and balance."
"DA: All day long."
"Lagers are among my favorite types of beer so I may show some favoritism for Sam Adams. Nevertheless, this is a great beer. It pours a nice rich carmel color with a medium head. It smells like a beer that only uses good quality ingredients. Malty and hoppy with no other odors that aren't supposed to be there. No banana, orange, lemon, or any other fruit crap. Just pure beer taste. The taste is exactly what a lager is supposed to be. This is the beer that I compare all other Lagers to."
"D: One of my favorite lagers. Very good, thirst quenching taste that leaves you feeling good the next day."
"This is my go to beer and a bad beer bar so I thought I'd provide an official review. Pours an amber brown with a white head that retains a one finger white head that leaves beautiful sticky lacing throughout. Smells of floral hops with a strong malt backbone with caramel hints. Nothing stands out in its taste aside from a slightly hop bite finishing things out that fades. Malts don't have the caramel taste that I found in the nose. Mouthfeel is light as expected and this brew is extremely drinkable. Its a good tail gating / go to beer. I rarely buy this in bottles, but turn to it when my choices are limited when out with a few friends."
"Overall: I love this beer. Though I have ony started reviewing here, I have probably tried 50 or so different beers, and this one is currently my favorite. I usually get a 6pack of these after I have several unsucessful samplings of other beers. ""Always a good choice"""
"D: As always Sam Adam's always pulls through and this one is no different."
"Its a good choice if your looking for a something that everyone can like. It's a pretty average beer middle of the road beer. If complexity is what your looking for then this is not the one for you."
"Drinkability- A very good session beer, a few of these would be delightful."
"I have always thought Samuel Adams was a good all around beer, its available everywhere and makes for a good fallback brew when some of the more ""Craft"" types are unavailable. The flagship boston lager is my favorite offering from them."
"Drinkability - Certainly a good beer to drink when choices are limited. Simple amount of flavor puts other macros to shame. However, this is not nearly as good as I remember from my pre-Beer Advocate days. But its worth a bump for a good gateway beer."
"the boston lager or the flagship of sauel adams. I bought a case of the sam adams summer variety pack friday night and as exspected it was in their. poured an semi deep amber color. smell was of hops. taste was deliscious now this is what i call a beer. i could drink this beer all day. now i see why this beer wins metals year after year and claims bragging rights."
"D: A good lager, you can find it almost everywhere, this beer would be a good session choice, a quality macro-micro beer."
"Sam Adams, in my mind, is the consistently best brewery in America. Everything they seem to make is above average at best. Boston lager is the staple of the brand and is a great beer for all occassions. As Jim Koch states, this beer has an almost perfect blend of hops and malt. That blend creates an awesome aroma, very nice mouthfeel, and a very delicious taste."
"Overall: I can't -believe- I'd never tried this lager before. Just great."
"D- completely balanced, great carbonation, it's no wonder that boston lager is the top sam adams seller in my area. many fizzy yellow beer drinkers have been converted thanks to this beer. i know, because i'm the one that pushed it."
"Taste is of light caramel with a bit of green apple crisp tartness. Grass and hay and earth from the nobles round things off nicely. Again, very clean and enjoyable. Mouth is lightly dry and carbonation is medium. Medium light body, fairly soft.Very drinkable, uncomplex, and clean, just what the style dictates. Enjoyable brew."
"Boston Lager really is an amazing mix of good flavor and drinkability for what is essentially a macro beer."
"Had to come back and re-rate this. Poured amber with nice creamy head that it held for a while. Aroma of hops is immediately evident. Hops evident in taste as well. Good American Lager not like most American pale lager. Very drinkable. Just got it for 6.69/six-pack."
"Mouthfeel was medium in body with a snappy zip of carbonation."
"Pours a clear gold, trending toward (reddish) copper. Starts off with a dense, off-white one-inch head. This dropped down to about an eighth inch, but never went away. Great lacing. Nice signs of carbonation edging up from the bottom of the glass that kept chugging along even after a few minutes. In fact, they were still slipping up at the bottom of the glass. [N.B. This is without the new Sam Adams glass.] Smells initially of peach and caramel together (the fruit is light) with some hops backing up. Sweetness (but not oversweet) in the taste comes off like a combination of vanilla and light brown sugar. Hops fill in toward the end and in the aftertaste. Great creaminess to this and moderate carbonation. Very drinkable. While Ive enjoyed Sam Adams for a while, Ive never actually reviewed the Boston Lager until now. Two things strike me: first, its good to remind myself that lagers can have a depth of flavor (macro-lagers do lagers a disservice). Second, its nice to see that Sam Adams flagship brew is still a worthwhile beer."
"Light to medium body,creamy,grainy and slightly cloying. Very drinkable seems to please everybody,just a bit filling but it takes quite a few for me to reach that point. Classic beer must try tastes a lot different on tap than from the bottle try both see what you think."
"A fine lager and a fitting flagship beer. This shows that the Boston Beer Company produces some quality brews and is certainly no macro brewery."
"D. Good flavor and mouthfeel make this a good drink. It's also easy to come by and can be available on tap in less than suitable bars."
"this is a great beer that is reasonably priced that you can get virtually anywhere."
"The body is fairly thin and dry. Crisply carbonated. Very easy drinking. I'll be picking this up much more often when I am looking for a session beer. I can't quite comment on how much this glass really improves the beer since this is my first time trying it, but I still love the glass, whether or not it truly does what it is intended to do. Thanks again, Mr. Koch."
"I like this beer and I could drink a lot of it. I do think it's a tad pricey, though, and that's why I don't."
"Admittedly, this beer has never been my favorite, but it's always been a solid and reliable alternative to the macros and many other inferior craft beers on the market. It's available everywhere these days, which is probably why I don't drink it much, but I'll be glad to give her a go every now and then in the future simply because I have this funky new glass to pour it into. That's some crafty salesmanship right there, it is. But for a solid beer like this, what's wrong with that?"
"ADDENDUM: The one place where this glass really made a difference was in appearance. Secondly, it was very comfortable to drink from. The effect it has on smell is not really noticeable until the beer drops well into the bowl area, where the aroma becomes more concentrated. Nice glass!"
"D: A tasty Vienna lager, with more zest than others of its ilk, which proves to be standout and delicious. I'm glad this is a more common option for many American beer drinkers, as it certainly dwarfs the macro lager offerings."
"D: Quite drinkable and an easy pickup when nothing else is around, not mindblowing or tasty as other lagers but very solid notheless."
"One of the classics at this point, like many others this was one of the first micros I had back in the day. Poured a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Nice erythrean orange, golden body with a foamy 2 finger white head. Light steady lacing throughout the glass. Pretty solid malt and hops aroma, nice balance between the two. Taste is also a nice balance between hops and caramel malts, resulting in a rich flavor for a some what light ,medium bodied beer. Mouthfeel was pleasant, medium carbonation, pretty clean feel and a tad of dryness in the end. Overall a very good beer and a fail safe option."
""
"Clear orange/gold pour with a nice white head which leaves a nice amount of lacing on the glass. Floral hops in the aroma. Nearly perfect balance of hop bitterness and biscuit malt flavors, some sweetness in the malt too. I've had this beer so many times that it's hard to separate the occasions, but this is a consistently good beer. Easy to find, easy to drink, the perfect session beer in the good old US and A. I haven't had another Vienna Lager(including a couple in Vienna) that measures up to it in any respect."
"D- Of course. It's cheap, available everywhere, and quite good. Order this next time you go out for a steak. It's not disappointing."
"It feels thick like an ale, but with that ever-so-slight lager ""sting"" at the end. I must say, it's a very competent macro lager. It really does drink more like a thicker ale. Not bad."
"I should really come back to this one more often. Definitely a classic. And hey, why not support the ""locals"" (though that would be more rock-solid if I actually had any ties to Cincinnati)."
"Got this at the TGI Fridays in Glasgow. Apart from this the beer list was one which would have you drinking water with your meal, but this was a very pleasant surprise. A fine brew and probably the best lager I have tasted."
"This beer is usually hit or miss with me, but it is almost always the best thing available at most resturaunts in the area."
"D: While I'm not a huge hop-head, this beer has an excellent balance between hops, toastiness and cream. The cream makes it easy on the palate, while the hops give it enough backbone to stick up to a bar filled with cigarette smoke."
"This is a great every day beer. Its simple enough to be inoffensive, with just enough malt and hops to keep it interesting."
"D: Fair at best. It's not a bad beer by any means, but to me it reaks of mediocracy, and is rather forgettable. Just doesn't do it for me."
"Eminently quaffable, if somewhat forgettable... every time I forget just how delicious and solid this beer is, I take the time to re-examine and see the flaws... still, a stand-out fallback, and worth revisiting from time-to-time for nothing more than a hint of nostalgia (this was one of the first craft brews I was turned on to) and a reminder that even as beer profilerates it needn't be excessively bland and characterless."
"D - A nice beer that I wouldn't have any problems drinking lots of. The only problem is that $4.95 a bottle here that limits it somewhat."
"Not only is this a fine beer, it's a fine beer every time. Pours out a deep copper with lots of hoppiness on the nose. Taste is rather complex and seems to change depending on what temperature the beer is being served at. Colder temps (<45'F) gives a sharp refreshing brew. Temps above 50'F bring out the well balanced hops/malt flavors. A terrific beer that is readily available. Only downfall is that it has lost it's microbrew charm."
"I've had these glasses for a while, but this is the first Samuel adams that I got to try out of them. I am aware that this was not a scientific test but damn this was the best tasting Samuel Adams Boston Lager that I've ever had."
"overall, this is a decent lager. although it is technically a ""boston lager", which must be a bitter style, it is well crafted for what it is. worth a try."
"If this is THE BEST BEER IN AMERICA then I must be heterodox and say it is not."
"On-tap at Fridays. Same old goodness from draft as the bottle, except a touch better with the mouthfeel. Sometimes I think I overlook how good this stuff is as I'm trying different kinds of beer. A good decision when restaurants have a limited tap selection, but it's at its very best when coming from draft at a Boston bar, as it's overall flavor is much sweeter and carameley."
"D: I love this beer. It is good for any occasion and it is becoming available almost anywhere I go. I will defiantly be seeing more this beer in the future"
"overall this is a mighty fine beer"
"As far as Sam Adams beers go this is not my favorite but again it is a good beer. Theres just something about the way they brew their beer that gets you really nicely buzzed. If you like lagers then this is the way to go if youre in a supermarket. In a small liqour store you might a bit more selection depending on the season. For the SA's that are year round this is an overall good one if you prefer lagers like myself. If youre into ales theres always the Boston Ale but thats another review."
"Draft in a pint glass. Pours a darker golden color with a thick foamy lasting head. Light lacing. Aroma is fairly faint. Consists of caramel and a fairly sweet malt scent. Flavor is fairly subdued with hints of malts and a bit of light citrus. Body is light to medium with a heavy dose of carbonation. Leaves a bit of a hoppy aftertaste that is not present during initial consumption. A good session beer, but nothing more."
"I have had this beer alot and can't believe I have never reviewed my favorite session beer. Poured into a pint glass, pours a rustic brown orange with a fluffy head that leaves thick lace on the glass. Smell is pretty malty and just a hint of hoppyness added to this creation as well. Taste is pretty good I can taste a bit of bread and also some roasted barley and malt in the mix also a bit of bisquit that makes me quite hungry. This beer to me screams chewable, it litterly taste like I can chew it up which is why its one of my favorites, good job Sam Adams."
"Nicely done brew. An instant classics if my opinion counts."
"The Flagship of the Sam Adams brand is really very good; and the fact that you can find it just about anywhere means it is a ""go to"" selection. Great, dark amber color and heavy foam head with mild malt in the nose. Mouthfeel is surprisingly satisfying for a ""find it anywhere"" beer and the taste is very well balanced--biscuity malt with a touch of hops bitterness. Extremely drinkable. A great session beer for an evening out or a Saturday afternoon BBQ. An American classic."
"This is the beer that started me and many others to sample and seek ""beyond Bud", and after 23 years of consistency I've come to realize just how well Sam Adams goes with food of all types. This vienna lager pours amber, a very rare style in American craft brewing, but seems taken for granted of late. The aroma is alone in the beer world as it is an unforgettable recipe of noble hops. The taste is of balance, but when paired with food the caramel flavors work well with seared, grilled or roasted meats, fish and vegetables. The noble hop aroma and dry finish act as an herbal finish, thus complimenting anything from the main course to side dishes. In the New England area Sam Adams lager is found everywhere from sub shops to chinese restaurants and Italian restaurants and is established in many restaurant chains. In my experience this beer has even saved many dull meals that would not have been as enjoyable if I didn't have Sammy to wash it down. A Boston, New England, American, and now world classic."
"Taste is malty and the beer has a nice yeast profile, it appears to be kind of German with some sulfur and light bready notes. It is not a big taste explosion, and taste and smell are not strong, but for what it aims to be, it is a good beer. The beer is dry and pretty bitter, which balances the malt. Mouthfeel is nice and smooth. Drinkability is good."
"that puts macro lagers to shame"
"constantly keep on my order list. Hoping to try the other Sam Adams though."
"I used to like the beer a heck of a lot more about 10 years ago, and I'll swear the recipe has changed in that time. The beer still has the same smell and the pour is reasonably heady. The body is medium and color is still amber. The taste is different. I remember it as having a lot more balance, a lot less molasses/caramel malt flavor, and just more interesting hopiness. The aftertaste is also sweetish malt and caramel. It is just too imbalanced and overpowering for my tastes. Blah ... this is a beer I will only drink if it is around and nothing else is available, which is usually at cookouts and the like. It's okay, and I barely recommend it, hence the scores of 3, but it is barely squeeking by, and it might be for nostalgia's sake that I don't sink this one into the thumbs down category."
"Mouthfeel was a bit flat and watery, and the carbonation made this beer seem harsh and scratchy. Not recommended."
"The flagship brew pours a brilliant golden/light copper color into my pint glass with a thin white head. The aroma is moderately sweet, a low noble hob aroma, a bit musty, and metallic. The flavor is moderately sweet, and some spicy toasted grain emerges. The hop bitterness is medium-low, but provides enough balance. The swallow is smooth with a bit of hop flavor. The carbonation is moderate, body is medium-full, and mouthfeel is smooth. It had been quite sometime since I had this beer. Overall I was pleased with flavor and overall feel of the beer. The aroma left something to be desired."
"This is a good beer, a solid beer, and i was ready to bash it, not having consumed it in a long while. once i drank it again i realized sam adams has built up the way it has on the back of this solid beer."
"D: Very drinkable if not for the price -- there are many other beers where the extra buck per six-pack is well worth it."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light bodied, extremely well carbonated, and a pure joy to session. I really enjoy this beer. Overall, it's a classic. While the numbers may not reflect it, most would agree. It is the beer that prompted many of us to graduate to better beer. This is a staple for me. It is, and always will be, a classic."
"Got this on tap at a local resteraunt. Poured the expected clear amber with a quickly diminishing head with some islands of foam. Nice hop bitterness on a malt backbone. I thought I detected a bit of clean spice in the taste. Very short slightly bitter aftertaste. I enjoyed this simple beer."
"I think this beer is decent for what it is and if anything, it gives me incentive to drink more lagers."
"This is one of the best lagers that I have had. It has a taste complexity that I thought only an ale could have. Cheers to Jim Koch. The beer pours a very light yellow common to lagers. There is moderate head with no lacing. The smell is a very clean and intriguing one. This beer has a very clean and crisp yet complex taste with almost no lasting aftertaste to taint one's palate. Very drinkable."
"One of the best session beers, almost ubiquitous. Classic fall-back brew."
"Better than a macro, but really didn't come out and grab me. I'd drink it again in a similar situation, but won't go out of my way to order one."
"This is a very drinkable beer and a good intro to good beers for your friends that are stuck on the Bud Light vs. Miller Lite debate."
"Recommended. This is a solid beer that you can always count on. Seriously, if you haven't had this yet, get out from under your rock and try it. There's a reason that this is a well-respected beer. I've meet about three people who don't like this. Nearly everyone else does. It's also a great gateway beer for your friends that think Budweiser is all one needs."
"This is one different beer that you can get in any bar. This beer have a great taste a nice smell and feels very good in the mouth..The color of this beer is darker that any regular macro lager. This beer is great with appetizer especially if they are spicy.You can have one in boston or in any other part f the US and still will be great."
"Wonderful beer all around. Refreshing with nice blend of hoppiness, malt flavor, and not too much carbonation. The hops dominate the taste, but the overall blend of flavors make this worth drinking again and again. This has definitely become my ""stand-by"" beer when nothing else is worth drinking."
"a decent beer and ubiquitous enough to be found in even most shit bars and random restaurants. something i will drink lacking other options and better than most available lagers. light amber and crystal clear with a white head. floral, spicy hops and roasty caramel malts in the nose. very light malt sweetness quickly cleaned out by the vegetal hop bitterness and crisp carbonation, finishes quite dry. a sessionable beer."
"Well balanced and very easy to drink. Makes a good session beer."
"D Good session beer and the best option with only macros"
"D - This is a very nice beer. A good session beer."
"I would not go as far as calling this a classic, but it is a well-crafted beer and a good session beer."
"You might not love it, but you should appreciate it."
"I must say this is my go to beer when there are only macros on tap. I'll take this over a bud or yuengling any day. It pours nice and clean. The head is white and the carbonation is not nearly as high as other macros. Slightly malty taste which is not what I really want with my lagers. This is why I did not give it a bang up review. However, I have always liked that Sam Adams has noticably more hops than most of the other big guys. If you are new to the microbrewed beers, give this one a try. It won't send you over the top with flavor, but it is much better than Bud any day."
"This is a pretty basic Vienna. The taste, however is more present. Has a nice white head on it. Smell has a malt character to it. A decent sweet malt flavor with subtle hop bitterness. Overall pretty boring and dull. I don't purchase this too often because its priced the same as much better brews. This is very drinkable because it is unoffensive, refreshing, and enjoyable."
"all that's left is some chunky lacing. A good, basic brew."
"Great session beer, the best macro lager I've had. My go-to."
"The perfect beer to start a bud, miller, coors drinker on the right path to the ""better beer"" (I know, I did it!)"
"This is a pretty average lager. When poured the color was an amber brown with nice white foam. The taste of hops and malts with a hint of spice was evident. Nice thirst quincher on a warm afternoon. A pleasant surprise with this lager from Sam Adams."
"A very good session beer. Pours an amber brown with a two-finger white fluffy head, and a touch of lacing. Hops and malt are well balanced- some toasty hazelnut flavors, along with tobacco ash, carmel and others. Goes down clean with a slightly bitter aftertaste."
"This is a pretty ok beer. I'd call it good in a word. The appearance was pretty good. It poured nicely into my glass. The amber/oragne/yellow color was a nice tone. The smell had some hop to it. The taste was hoppy with a hint of sweet-esque malt. Mouthfeel was smoothish without much bite. Drinkability was just above average like a 3.2 really."
"I tried this in a bottle at the request of a BA user who said my first experience with Sam Adams Boston Lager (see a few reviews below) was most likely a fluke. The good news is, he was right. I got this in a mix a six and it was a whole different brew. The bad news is, it still seemed bland and boring. Maybe because it is simply a plain ol lager, a higher quality version of the stuff you bought in college. With so many other choices from Sam Adams, including my favorite the Double Bach, I don't ever see myself buying a sixer of this stuff, but I guess that's just my opinion."
"D: I seem to remember this beer having much more flavor. Everytime I drink this, it seems more and more like a BMC brew. Hopefully this is just a result of my palate becoming more sophisticated and not a dropoff in quality from Mr. Koch, but I fear the latter. Decent if there are no better alternatives, but at the establishments that I frequent, there almost always are."
"light mohogany colored with a healthy white head. Smell has not much to it, clean with a slight floral hop aroma. Taste is clean with a spicy hop punch. A light bodied lager that is not complex and and easy to drink, though there is a bitterness that sticks around in the aftertaste."
"Drinkability - An easy drinking beer, one that stands out amongst meager domestic offerings, but certainly doesn't stand up to the average craft brewer. Will drink again."
" A solid beer from Sam Adams and good regular to have when your out at a place with no Micro Brews."
"A good beer... could put a few away with no trouble."
"Not the first beer I reach for, as I generally prefer something thicker. That said, it's nice for the style."
"Poured a light brown with a thin white head atop. Smell was very malty with a presence of hops and slightly spicy as well. The flavor is a sweet carmel taste with a blast of hops right away which then takes a backseat to the malt sweetness again. A very crisp and well balanced beer. I can drink this one for hours."
"Had this on tap at the BW3's in columbus, and all i can say is wow. This beer is outstanding. The appearance was a nice dark amber color. The smell was outstanding, you can smell the presense of hops and a maltiness to it. The taste is great, that's all i can say. A beer i can definitely have for the rest of my life. Cheers Jim Koch!!! =)"
"Overall this beer is pretty unoffensive, for me it excels at bars where they don't have any microbrews."
"Quality product. Always good to have nearby in an unknown bar."
"Drinkability - This is just a classic, for East Coaster's this the beer that turns those of us who weren't raised with a great beer education but always looked for something more into Beer Advocates. To top if all off, after diving into the beer world, this bad boy still stacks up. Don't let the widespread availability fool you, this is still a top-notch brewsky."
"D - Okay for everyday drinking needs, nothing more."
"Opinion: This is a pretty good beer and one that would definitely be a good ""starter beer"" for someone getting into the craft brew scene. I don't buy this beer too regularly when it is available, but I pick it pretty often in airport bars and so forth when this is no doubt the best they have on tap. This beer is hard to classify, but IMO I would call it a German Pale Lager with an American Flair."
"Lives up to the hype..very drinkable."
"Caution: Check the freshness indicator on the bottle...freshness is everything to a malt forward unpasturized lager...my previous samples were bland and stale in the last 1/4 of their advertised shelf life...best before 3 months from botttling if you want fresh tasting beer."
"I've always enjoyed this beer, even though my tastes have move on a bit. This is often a salvation been because it is so widely available and often the best alternative. Boston Lager will always have a place in my fridge."
"Overall, I'm kind of ""meh"" on this one. On one hand, its not bad at all; on the other, there are far better lagers out there. One thing SA has going for it is ubiquity: even places that otherwise only carry macros will have Boston Lager, and for that purpose its great. That said, I don't think I'll be buying it to have at home."
"Drinkability: While this is a very solid brew, Vienna lagers just aren't my cup of tea. Regardless of the scores, I find Sam Adam's Light to be the more enjoyable widely available beer from Boston Beer Company."
"This beer is definitely a session beer and one that I'll call a ""staple"" for years to come!!"
"this is definitly now one of my favorites as far as widely available beer goes. this puts other large breweries to shame. the color is a nice copper like red. slight head retention, good lacing. the nose is appealing. dry grass like aroma. the taste is caramle sweet with a nice balance of hop bitterness. really nicely balanced. for whatever reason i've put this off in the past. finally gave it a try and will give it a try again real soon."
"Overall: A well balanced beer with an almost unique quality whereby the initial flavors are so well balanced that the individual components are suppressed, providing a harmonious gestalt. More than any other lager I have tried, this beer is the most like the homebrewed lagers that I have made. It is no wonder that this beer put the Boston Beer Company on the map."
"D: This is the session beer to end all session beers."
"My favorite of all the Samuel Adams beers. Extremely drinkable brew. Smooth, with a light hoppy bite. Great on a hot summer day or while sitting inside watching the snow pile up outside in the dead of winter. Puts the macro brews (bud, coors, miller) to shame! Sam Adams..Red Sox..Bruins...Celtics....I LOVE BOSTON!!!"
"Pour a clear golden color with nice white head that left soapy lacing all over the glass. I'm not picking up much on the nose, some light hops. There is a nice balance between the noticable hops and caramel malts, the result is that it finishes smooth. Well carbonated and crisp, light but not watery. A very drinkable beer and a good standby to fall back on now and again."
"Overall a great beer, easy to drink, nothing crazy and nothing strange, just an awesome session beer that tastes great and at $21 for a Costco 28 pack there is no beer than can compare for the price."
"Drinkability? I've had 2 out of my 12 pack, and I must say I could drink the rest in one (long) session if I had the time, so yeah, it is drinkable, but I feel with the taste of this beer, it would better serve as a companion with your favorite cut of steak rather than a session beer. I'm going to go fire up the grill."
"Drinkability: Excellent! Great session beer from the micro monster."
"Drinkability: A tasty lager, very drinkable and clean. No off flavors, or nasty steely macro lager garbage."
"Drinkablilty - I can drink a lot of these. I mostly partake at bars when I want something I don't want to think too much about, but still is very well rounded."
"Pours a very nice copper amber color with a classic and fluffy white head. Fine carbonation bubbles rise excitedly to the top of the beer. Nice but mellow aromas of malt and floral hops. Smooth flavors of caramel malt, nice and even display of hops, also a bit of citrus tang that is refreshing. All around an excellent lager and very sessionable. Also a great stand-by as it can be found even at most crappy beer bars."
"What a beauty. Say what you will about this one, but I don't see how anyone could dispute that this is one of the prettiest beers on earth. Transparent, yet rich golden amber, with champagne bubbles rising to the surface to fight for air. The head is rich and downright pillowy. The nose is treated almost as well, with a toasty caramel malt profile and a touch of hop bite. The taste doesn't disappoint, but doesn't quite live up to the aroma. Just a little thin on the finish, and ditto for the mouthfeel. Terrific little hop bite, though. Despite a recent trouncing on the forum, I still think that the character of this is similar to Anchor Steam, and I'm convinced that a similar yeast strain is the culprit. Anyway, that's one for the forum. Great drinkability, and a truly great beer that deserves it's status and prominence."
"A well rounded beer for sure. The best thing to order when you're at a bar that doesn't cater to the micro drinker!"
"Not bad. Boston Lager is a well tuned and tweaked brew. This is the quintessential craft brew, the proverbial snowball of the beer world, and it does taste good."
"Drinkability: Very sessionable beer. I've been drinking SA lager for over twenty years and enjoying it. It's always that go-to beer where some places serve it as the only alternative to BMC."
"D- its great not overly"
"Good session beer for sure."
"Mouthfeel is good, creamy and full bodied this is pretty much all you could want in a brew. As to the drinkability, I'd much rather buy Elliot Ness than this, its just so much better. This brew goes down easy enough, and makes a good session beer. I'll probably give it another go-round as this is their flagship beer, I'm beginning to think that it was a bad set of batches or something happened during shipping."
"Given the distance this beer has travelled, it has held up very well. A wonderfully balanced, extremely drinkable beer."
"pours the color of a bright copper penny and crystal clear with a three finger head that held for a short time with some lacing. roasted malt, slight citrus and toffee aromas. taste about the same. mouthfeel is light, smooth, lots of carbonation and nicely hopped. very nice beer, easy to drink, easy to find, and reasonably priced."
"In a lot of ways it's one of the world's best just because of the versatility behind it."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a copper-orange color with a huge frothy off-white head and a nice stream of carbonation rising from the bottom of the glass. Smell is an even combination of both sweet malt and grassy, earthy hops. The taste has an initial sweetness of caramel and amber malts but is quickly followed by a bitterness not found in your typical lager. Well balanced and goes down smooth. The mouthfeel is full-bodied and very creamy. This is a tasty, easy to drink lager that is readily available almost anywhere."
"An average style beer. I say this because the copper color is starting to become old. I don't like the misconception on how a ""darker"" styled beer always tastes good. This is a mildley hoppy beer that is slightly bitter and slightly sweet. A slightly stale aroma that has some corriander notes. Very well carbonated because it fizzes the entire glass, and has some bite in the mouth when consumed."
"Overall: This was my first foray into the world of craft beer, and was one of the only options (aside from Guinness) when I lived in the Middle East. The best thing about this beer is that it's mass marketed so most bars and restaurants carry it, leaving me with a decent fall back option when I'm in one of those places. For a beer that's as mass marketed as it is, this really is a good beer."
"Nothing extraordinary, but a balanced, extremely drinkable imbibement. Easy going hops linger in the dry finish. Always available and there's always room in the fridge for it. Just refreshing and just tasty enough."
"Cost: 14.99 for a 12 box"
"D: Easily one of the more sessionable beers that is readily available in the US today. A go to beer when other craft options aren't available. A major reason why many of us started to drink better beer in the first place."
"Though Samuel Adams is now a major brand, they still have a microbrew attitude, and it shows in this and their other beers."
"This beer has everything that my frat boy brews lacked. A head that lasted more than 3 minutes along with a smell I had not experienced...HOPS! It's color was as smooth as a penny and had great carbonation and mouth feel. I have not turned back. Mr. Koch is a great man!"
"taste is excellent. full in flavor, nicely balanced. a nice dry crisp taste. definitely a hoppy brew, but not so much as to overpower the great caramel malty taste. great balance to this. light crisp mouthfeel. one of the most drinkable beers i know of."
"I generally don't like lagers, but this is one I'll pick up every now and then. Frothy head with excellent lacing, the commercials are right when they say this is a hop-heavy beer. It still manages to be balanced, however. Remarkably full-flavored for the type, and one I'll be coming back to. I may start trying some of the other Vienna lagers recommended here."
"The old reliable. No matter what podunk gas station or dive bar you find yourself thirsty in, chances are you'll find SA Boston Lager. Availability aside it's a solid, very drinkable beer. The 12oz bottle poured into my pilsner glass to a light crystal clear amber. A small loose head left little lacing as I drank it down. A crisp hop smell, maybe some malt in there as well. Taste is a nice malty hop balance. The hops are a bit more bitter than the smell indicates. The brew feels crisp and refreshing in my mouth. A solid taste, but nothing overwhelming. I have always found this to be a strong session beer, very drinkable."
"D- Good all around beer. Perfect for just kicking back and not wanting to really think about what you're drinking."
"Standard pint glass filled with a 12 oz longneck. Pour created a one-finger, bubbly head with decent retention and some lacing. Beer was light amber in color and had live carbonation. The aroma had a pronounced bready and toast quality along with malt and a slightly fruity hop nose. The first sips of this beer produce a bread and toast-like flavor that is blended with some caramel sweetness and rounded out with a noble hop flavor. There is some bitterness to the finish, which is nice. As the beer warms up by mid-bottle, the hop flavors come out even more and have just as much presence as the malt. The mouthfeel was very creamy with a medium body. This is a great full-flavored lager which is very drinkable. A solid beer that can be found just about anywhere."
"I think this sets the standard for the American lager."
"Great ""eff'n"" Beer!"
"I'm always partial to Sam Adams Boston Lager...it was the beer that moved me away from watered down mass domestic and into the Better Beer spectrum. The body is always a beautiful clear amber. The awesome boutique of Bavarian Hops greets your sense of smell. Then the best part is the balance between the hops and malt - one does not overpower the other. I love how the taste dances on your tongue once you've swallowed. Still the best Lager available on the market today."
"This good looking beer came to me in a pilsner and was a deep amber color with a very little head and mild lacing. it really smells like a beer should; it reminded of cedar mixed in with malts and you could pick up a light alcohol scent as well. It has a mild sweet taste to it, it really warms up your mouth and its not very dry at all, but it does have a mild bitter/tart aftertaste thats semi-crisp; however, it does go down well."
"I was very impressed by this beer. Had heard about it all the time on TV, and how they love hops, and they were right! Hops were very present and rewarding at the end of an easy ""entry"" if you will upon first hitting your mouth. It was more than I thought it would be, and sparked my interest in the Boston Beer Company and cemented my respect for an obviously passionate brewing company."
" Very drinkable IMO and lagers are by no means my favorite style. This beer is readily available, reasonably priced, and far better than a lot of beers on the market today. Simply because of the quality for price alone, I will probably start enjoying this beer far more often."
"D: This beer is really more like liquidfied food than anything else. Nice beer with a lot of flavor. May not be the most complex beer but its anything but boring."
"Amber/copper color and fluffy white cap with pretty good stick. Nice balance in the nose with some floral hop notes, and earthy malty grains. Hop flavors are of mild pithy citrus and dry bitter character. Toasted pale malts, mild caramelized sugar sweetness, and some faint cocoa powder found in the back. The finish is more grainy with some slight spicy, piney character. Thin body and slightly thicker mouthfeel is a tad cloying. Nice head retention to the end and little lacing left behind. Very drinkable beer and nicely crafted for the style."
"Pours crystal clear deep amber with nice white head. Lacing abound with excellent balance in the carbonation. Smell is of mild malt with some sweetness. Mouthfeel is light and very refreshing. Hop and malt balance are 50/50 for me on this one. Hop aftertaste with smooth malt undertone. Great beer and you can get it anywhere. You can't go wrong with this one. Very well balanced when it comes to hops/malts so it doesn't offend those who feel a beer is too heavy or too bitter. ABV makes it very sessionable. A staple in my opinion. And I can't help but add a little to the review before me.... there is no adjunct or corn at all. I am wondering what beer was sampled. Miller and Bud products should not be used in the same sentence with this. There is no comparison."
"I always remembered this lager to be moderatly hopped with a smooth but firm malt base and clean finish. Also the color I remember being more of a solid amber, not the current light copper. BA has it labled as a Vienna, which it certainly isn't. While not as bad Miller or Bud, this is a disapointment"
"This beer has been a great step in convincing many people I know that craft beers are the way to go. Well made and constant. Positively a well known American beer icon. This beer pours a clean orangey brown hue. Light tanish cream colored head that dissipates very slowly. Presentation is very idealistic to what a beer should look like. Strong cling of lace down the whole pint. Smells sweet and floral. Nice mix of the hop aroma and the sweet flavors from the malt. Good nose that makes you want to take a drink. Taste is smooth and enjoyable. Sweet caramel malt tones in the start and then nice bitters from the dry hop finish. Well balanced and full bodied. I have enjoyed this beer for many years especially in bars that do not offer much choice. This beer has proven to be an enjoyable staple. Not a bad session beer either although it can be quite filling. Overall drinkable and well made."
"This could be a session beer but I would hope for a little more flavor."
"Drinkability- Very nice. Interesting enough to be interesting, but not complex. Easy drinking."
"Drank this from that familiar 12 oz bottle. Has a March 2007 best-by date. Pours a clear orange with a thin white head. A few fingers. Smells and tastes of sweet barley, toast, orange. Sharp fizz on the tongue. This is probably the ultimate in simple, drinkable beers. Flavors aren't too strong, but it's not watery and weak. Will gladly pick one of these up any time!"
"d - easily drinkable and a nice one that i can find regularly in alabama."
"Medium/light body with a nice amount of carbonation, this beer feels great and is utterly drinkable. This is the readily available, fallback session lager that even the most macro-oriented establishment is sure to have."
"Overall a very solid and enjoyable offering from Sam Adams. Nothing particularly spectacular, but there isn't anything bad about this beer either. On all points, this is certainly light-years ahead of other domestic beers of the same price & availability. Sam Adams manages to get it right time after time. A great choice out at a bar or restaurant, or just to bring home!"
"IMHO, this is the prototypical ""gateway"" beer here in the east for making the move from macro to micro. It pours a pretty amber color, with a frothy white head. aroma is quite hoppy, more so than I'd expect for a lager. Taste is a very nice blend of hops and malt, without one overpowering the other. Drinkability is outstanding; there have been many nights when this beer started and ended the night. Although I frequently forget about Sam Adams (instead blinded by the allure of big IPA's and tough to locate Belgians), I always end up coming back to Sam."
"I absolutely love Boston Lager. I can't go a few months without having one. Whenever I feel like drinking a great beer at a fair price, I always go for a BL (sorry, that's what we call them, not to be confused with Bud Light). If I find myself torn about which beer to drink either at a bar or going out to get a 6 or 12, getting BL's is always an easy choice. So much character, balance and body to such an all around great brew. This has been around a while and you know they have perfected it. This beer is what opened the door to drinking & appreciating microbrews."
"Update: Had another bottle of this recently and it tasted a lot maltier than the first time I had it with more of a caramel, malty smell and taste that was very good. The exact taste of this beer seems to elude my palate!"
"Well this is overdue. This is my goto beer in restaurants for a while. Always pours that nice amber brown with a decent head. Smells nicely hopped and the taste is there as well. This is one beer that you can drink all night when you can only get to the local gas station on vacation to pick something up. Would take it over any other macro any day. Will always be the go to beer when nothing else is around, well unless I can get Sierra Nevada :)"
"Slainte!"
"Pours a reddish gold color with chunky head that laces the glass all the way down. Smells slightly hoppy and floral, very faint, but pleasant. Tastes very hoppy, with a faint hint of grapefruit or passionfruit, and finishes kind of sour. Mouthfeel is very somewhat heavy and fizzy, especially at the tip of the tongue and on the back of the tongue. All in all, it's a drinkable beer, very good flavor and lots of it."
"Pours a light amber color with a nice two fingered white head into a pint glass. Aromas of floral hops and sweet caramely malt. Taste is more of the same and is balanced nicely. A very drinkable beer that makes for a great session is available almost everywhere."
"drinkability: not too bad. I could have at least a couple."
"This beer had a copperish color and a medium head that dissipated within time. The smell was of a bit of malt, but more noticeably hop aromas and a bit of fruit too. The taste was good and had a good full body for a lager. I believe that it has more hop flavor than most people are used to in a lager, but that is most definately not a bad thing. The bitterness was medium, and the beer was fairly smooth and easy to drink. Thee carbonation was medium for this beer. Overall, I felt that if you enjoy lagers with a full body and a good solid hop flavor, this is a good beer that you can find on tap at restaurants and some bars. I would reccommend it."
"The classic Sam Adams Boston Lager, I poured this one into my mug. The pour reveals a nice looking light copper colored beer with high clarity, a 1/4 inch off white head fizzes away fairly quickly with very light lacing on the glass. The smell is hoppy, a lot of citrus hops come through with a little light malt. The taste is nicely hoppy too, for a mass produced american lager the hoppy flavor is great, almost reminds me of a good pale ale, the hop flavor settles nicely on the tongue. The taste is also classic lager in that it is smooth, but it has more body than nearly any other lager. Some malt flavor is there but it is low. Good mouthfeel with a nice level of carbonation again this is really nice and smooth. This one is highly drinkable a great session beer and a great way to get somebody excited about good beer."
"B'ham UK"
"This offering from Boston Beer pours a pale amber color that leaves a creamy thick tan head that leaves as fast as it came. The aroma is barley, bready, acidic citrus hops, a straight forward lager that is crisp and flavorful. The taste starts a bit citrusy, bready, and a bitter snap that is held in check by a smooth malty backbone. This is one of the great gateway beers of all time I love to come back to this delight every once in awhile and reminisce about one of my first beer loves."
"Served in a mug, the Boston Lager pours a nice amber color with a good sized frothy long lasting white head. There's also a good bit of lacing. It smells like floral and citrus hops, and sweet malt. It tastes the same way to me, but with a caramel malt sweetness along with the hoppiness. There's also a hoppy bitter finish. The mouthfeel is light/medium, with a good amount of carbonation. Drinkability is good, it has a nice clean finish. It's a good solid beer, one that's available pretty much everywhere. Not a bad choice as a session beer either."
"The only way to describe this beer is to call it a damn good beer. This is a beer for every and any day. I've had it before and I will have it again."
"This is easily one of the best lagers available on the market in Central Texas. Poured from a 12 oz. bottle, with a freshness date of Feb.2007, into a pint glass. The beer is a deep amber, with a 1/2 inch head, that left lacing all the way down the glass. The smell is sweet, but pleasant. The mouthfeel is a little thicker than expected from a lager, which is a good thing IMO, with a good amount of carbonation. The taste is sweet, with a slight citrus flavor. Overall, this beer is very enjoyable, and a great session beer."
"This lager poured a clear copper /amber , with a medium sized offwhite head that left some nice spotty lacing. The aroma on this brew is of nice full caramel malt sweetness , and a definate hop note. The taste is of rich munich malt , some caramel sweetness, as well as some bisquity flavor , and an assertive floral hoppiness. Medium mouthfeel , slightly dry finish. A great beer to be able to get at most establishments. Lots of nice vienna lager flavor , with a hoppy american twist."
"i always get this instead of the same old macro brew will eating out.pours nice and has a nice creamy head.laces good down the side of the glass.you can taste the hops this is a good thing.a reddish color.need a opener for the the bottle the advantage is you can use the bottles for your own home brew.althought the freshness date is not on the bottle it is in plain easy to understand engish on the top of the case.taste good not a bad call."
"I probably have not had more than one or two other vienna lager's knowingly to compare this to in my life, but it is a very pleasant taste, with enough bitterness to keep the palate interested rather than shutting it down. Worth trying, and an excellent staple for when more varied beers are not available."
"Pours a nice transparent orange amber with a thick head that dissipates quickly, but leaves a nice foamy lacing throughout the entire time you're drinking it. It smells like a lager, with a slight hint of hops and malt. You can taste the hops much more than you can smell them though, and it's a step above most other lagers. Has a very nice mouthfeel, pretty carbonated and somewhat light. Very easy to drink. The beer you get when you don't get to pick the beer store, but still a good beer in its own right and especially for the style."
"A very clear, golden-orange amber pour. The finger's worth of off-white head broke down pretty quickly, still leaving light lacing. The nose is more assertive than I expected--pleasantly sweet, with grains somewhat muted, leaving room for a bit of hops. Taste is pretty average on the front side, with ho-hum grains leading the way. But the hoppy dryness in the finish is a pleasant surprise. Mouthfeel is reasonably clean, with the clinginess of the cops cutting through the lightly sticky malts. This is a dependable go-to beer at a party (at least one where I didn't pick out the beer)."
"On-tap at the Chili's in Syracuse. This beer is quite for my tastes, but its good nevertheless. A nice amber color with white head. Smells of sweet malt and earthy hops. In the taste, a little more fruit comes ou in the hops, while the malt comes off as a dry caramel. A well-made beer and obviously the best choice at Chili's."
"Pours a nice golden color with a two finger white head and nice lacing. Smell is predominantly of floral hops with some citrus fruits. Taste is good. Very flavorful with some faintly caramel malts upfront finishing with floral hops that don't overwhelm. Nice mouthfeel, good light to medium body, and a moderate amount of carbonation. Easy drinking lager with a good balance of flavors."
"cheers."
"Very good balance of malty sweetness and hoppy bitterness. Medium bodied. A great primer of what better beer can be for the newbies."
"D: This is a great micro-macro brew that surprisingly I never tried. I felt like drinking a beer tonight and decided to pick up the 1 pint bottle from my local store and I was not disappointed. I would recommend picking up this gem."
"It is easy to say that this is one of the most available craft beers around. You can go into any decent bar and order a Sam Adams. That said, this beer pours a brownish-gold wtih a moderate head. Lacing is present throughout. Smell is malty with a hint of hops. The taste is very clean, and while full bodied it is easy to drink several of these in one sitting. An ideal session beer if you are in the mood for this style of lager."
"The ubiquitous SA lager, probably the most well known of the craft beer industry. And it's that way for a reason. A solid brew for any time of the year and for any place."
"Amber body with thin offwhite head. Smells hoppy and malty in almost equal amounts. Malty sweet with a strong hop presence. Medium-bodied. Full flavored. Tasty and drinkable. Tastes better than I remember... A solid lager that's available pretty much everywhere."
"I'm not sure why I waited so long to try this beer. I guess since it's usually featured with traditional BCM, I figured it tasted similar. It's like a cross between a great marco (if there is such a thing) and an organic Pale Ale. Now I feel as though I have a tasty, solid option when I can't enjoy find any micro's available on a night out with friends. Definitely lives up to it's reputation as an ""American world class beer."" And certainly one that I would keep on hand on a regular basis."
"The mouthfeel is excellent combining the right body with good carbonation which, when factored in with the solid taste, makes for the quintessential session beer."
"This IS a great beer. Much better on tap in a cold mug than out of the bottle. A malt hit with chocolate undertones is skillfully wisked away by an incredible and pleasant burst of hoppiness. A beer that goes down EVEN better at times when you think you wouldn't want a beer. Stop in for lunch and grab a pint to remember what you forgot,...that this is an extremely good representation of an american brew. Seems dryer or less aromatic out of the bottle. Great flavor without being heavy. I like that! Im serious...cold mug...at lunch...you'll see."
"This is quite a tasty lager. Don't be fooled by how widley available or intensely advertised this beer is; it has little in common with other beers you'll find in commercials. The body is a very well balanced mixture of the noble hops and a caramel malt flavor. It goes down exceedingly smooth and has a pleasant aftertaste. A bit heavier than other lagers you'll find, but nothing too filling. Drinkability is high, and reccomended. This is a quality brew."
"This beer poured a deep golden clear color with a thick head with nice lacing. The smell is very malty and smells a bit like molasses. The taste is slightly sweet with a heavy malt taste. It finishes nicely with a hint of bitterness from hops. The mouthfeel is very full but accurate for what the beer is trying to accomplish. This is a very drinkable beer that goes down easy."
" A good and easy to drink brew. One of my favorite Sam Adams besides some of their season beers."
"This is one of the most balanced beers available. The flavor of the noble hops is distinct, but not overpowering. The bitterness of the hops is just enough to counter the sweetness of the caramel malt. The flavor is close to a mild IPA, but lacking the same degree of bitterness. The beer is incredibly smooth, but slightly heavy. It is not quite as drinkable as a typical lager, but is about average for an amber ale. Bottom line: you cannot go wrong with this beer."
"Pours a clear medium amber with a two-finger head that dissipates at a modest rate leaving at least a foamy coating on top. Balanced smell and taste with subtle hops following a smooth caramel malt presence. A drinkable brew, much better than their Scotch Ale."
"This beer was on-tap at the Pearl St. Pub in Oldenburg, IN. If you are in the area it is worth checking out."
"First thing i noticed when pouring this beer was the thick forthy head and great lacing this beer had. Also a nice color with the medium amber. Had a nice hoppy scent. Flowery hops rich in flavor with a little bite. Nice even carbonation. Fresh and easy to swallow. Very drinkable and after taste leaves you wanting more."
"Easy drinking and perfect with a variety of foods."
"Note: this was the beer that started it all for me -- moving me away from BMC into the whole craft beer scene back in the early 90s. I rarely purchase it any more (this bottle was left over from a friend's 40th birthday party), having found plenty of beers that I like better. But as a colorful lager with more taste, body and character than those fizzy yellow beers most people start out with, it's a nice transition beer into a broader world."
"A rather tastey lager. I poured from a 12 oz bottle to a glass and got a little head, with low retention, and even less lace. The only below average aspect of this lager was the smell, which wasn't bad, it just didn't have one. Don't drink and review."
"Macro, micro, who cares? The BBC brews exceptionally good beer. And for all of you that say an exceptional brew must be hard to find, you need to really give Sam Adams a try and think about why some ""micro breweries"" might not have their beers as widely available. While in Germany, I tasted great beers, but most of them were honestly right up there but not quite as good as Sam Adams. As for the tiny breweries, I have tasted some brews this good, but they were few and far between. This is the first beer I have ever given a 5 rating on taste. While I love Sam Adams out of the bottle, having this on tap is simply the best. I only wish more places here in central Texas would realize this."
"Pours a clear orangey honey color with moderate carbonation and a thick, rocky white head that leaves heavy clinging lace. There's a plateau like ""cookie"" in the middle of the head. Clean, toasty malt aromas mixed with herbal noble hops. Toasty malts back up a refreshing floral, herbal, and earthy hop character. Moderate body with some prickly carbonation. Might be a tad sticky on the tongue at times. Excellent drinker."
"D- Nice session beer."
"Notes - sometimes i find this beer at 5.49 a sixer like tonight...i always take advantage and buy a few..cant beat it. its usually 7.99. a good session beer for me..flavor full, not too high in alchohol and easy to drink."
"I poured this 12 ounce bottle into a pint glass, where it formed a slight head that dwindled slightly as I drank. A nice deep honey in color and piney in smell. Its taste was full with a citrus in the background. It has a nice mouthfeel, not too thin. This is a beer that you can sit back with along with the fellas and knock a few back."
"An old favorite and a standard order at restaurants that don't have a wide selection. It's also a beer that some of my macro-drinking friends will tolerate (probably because of brand recognition, because it really isn't a dumbed-down beer). Anyway, it's a classic and ""always a good decision."" Recommended."
"A ton of reviews on this already. Suffice to say my contribution will be - great fallback choice as it's widely available. Not my regular choice for personal spending and consumption but a great choice for session / general pairing with foods."
"Drinkability: Put'em down at will."
"This is a classic American beer and I am glad that so many restaurants and chains carry this along with the BMC crap. It has bailed me out many times."
"This is a light, hazy, orange-tinged beer with absolutely no head as it was served. Smells are very faint but lightly malty. Taste is prettymuch classic vienna lager I guess. It has a sweet and toasty malt base with a bitterness that only really shows itself toward the finish. Alcohol is barely apparent. Mouthfeel is probably just a little thicker and slicker than it ought to be. Something about this beer keeps me from wanting to drink alot of it. It feels a tad heavy I guess. It also reminds me exactly of a beer I homebrewed once which was kinda freakin me out. What can I say? This is a good beer with no real issues, but I guess I prefer Negra."
"Finishes nicely, clean and crisp. This would be a staple for me in the ""I just want a good, cheap six pack lager"" category."
"D: There was a time that I only drank BMC products. Then, I had my first taste of Sam Adams. I remember thinking, ""this is what real beer tastes like."" Ten years and many world class beers later I still find myself saying the same thing whenever I drink a Boston Lager. It's my fallback beer at many restaurants. It pairs well with most foods. The perfect session beer. I think many people put this beer down because of its availability. I recommend drinking it without any preconceived notions. It's a classic."
"This isn't widely available where I live, but I could definitely put back a bunch if I was in a place where it's on tap."
"If beer was music, S.A. Boston Lager would be Beethoven's 5th: powerful and flawlessly excecuted. I cannot stop praising this brew. It could perhaps be the finest lager available. Excuse me as I weep with joy."
"Samuel Adams Boston Lager was amber in color with good clarity. It had a nice white rocky head with good retention and left plenty of lacing. The aroma was a nice mix of sweet malt and hops. The taste was a little bitter, and had a nice hop flavor with plenty of malt to go with it. The mouthfeel was good with a medium body and good carbonation. The drinkability was good as well, a sixer will disappear before you know it. This is my fallback beer and is a regular in my fridge."
"Get my buzz on- Y"
"Drinkability-- great if you like it."
"Overall, in my humble opinion, the best mass-marketed lager on the american market, an serves as a great entry point to the world of beer to the unitiated cheap american pilsner drinkers."
"Sam Adam's lager is ubiquitous, and because you can find any where you go I've had it about a ga-zillion times and I'm a little tired of it. A good fall back beer when you're out at a restaurant with friends, in a less beer-friendly bar, or shopping for milk and eggs at WalMart and ""accidentaly"" stray to the beer aisle. Sammy is a popular fella."
" A deep amber with a nice head it is certainly a much more attractive beer than the megabrews and it has much more body and less soda pop fizz than the megabrews also significantly better in aroma, taste and drinkability. there is nothing all that remarkable about it but it's a very solid beer of its style."
"Poured to an amber color with medium thick off-white head and decent lacing.Hoppy aroma, but difficult to distinguish anything particular. Ditto with the taste. Palte was good and smooth, and overall, this wasnt a bad beer, especially for a macro trying hard to be a micro."
"Sam Adams is a nice, drinkable beer. It would be good for parties with lots of people especially if they are not all serious beer fanatics. There isn't really anything to complain about. It isn't the most exciting beer, but it is a solid contribution to the American beer landscape."
"This beer was just plain good all around. Good appearance, a bit darker than most macros with some decent head and lacing. Not a whole lot of smell, a faint hint of hops and a lot of dry malt. Taste is good and very similar to the smell, with just a bit more hop feel. Drinks easy and smooth with a bit of carbonation."
"D: I've found myself paying a lot more attention to lighter beers lately. The weather is hot and I'm more active and when I'm craving a beer while I'm outside at the river or something, a lighter beer just hits the spot and this is an excellent example. I really don't care for the Vienna lager style, at least the ones of I'vd had have been very bland, but this one packs quite a bit of flavor."
"This beer pours a golden brown with no head. It has a floral hops smell with a hint of caramel malts. The beer has a malt taste with hints of grain and a hops aftertaste with a spicy bite. A clean creamy texture with a crisp clean finish makes this beer very drinkable. You cant go wrong with a bottle of Sam Adams. Defiantly one of my favorite breweries and their flag ship beer is right on the money."
"Overall, a real nice, readily avaible beer that looks fantatic when properly poured and is very drinkable. I am always disappointed when a restaurant waitress brings out this beer in a pint glass filled to the tippy top with no head ruining the look. This scenario will also most likely play out with a frosted glass, uugh!"
"D: Could drink this all day/night anywhere. Frat house, ballgame, back porch, family reunion, night out, etc. Everyone knows and respects Sammy Adams."
"this is the Bill Clinton of beers, a moderate in every way, toally middle fo the road, and pretty well balanced. I could make an off color remark about the head, but I'll resist. It pours golden amber with an off white head, nearly tan. It looks clean, with good carbonation. It tastes of perfectly balanced malt and hops, with sweetness and bitterness living in harmony. This also has good carbonation to it, it finishes clean, with a little bitterness. I'm good for a few of these, highly drinkable."
" I have always enjoyed these, I finally got around to the review."
"A very nice amber appearance with a thick white head, though the head disappears very quickly. Smells mainly of hops with the slight scent of honey. Nice, enjoyable taste with a good bit of bitterness. Mouthfeel wasn't bad, but wasn't great either. A drinkable beer that I would definitely choose if the selection was limited."
"Drinkability is great, this beer has such a good flavor, but is tame enought to enjoy in almost any situation, great session beer."
"D-Goes down easy, tastes pretty good, and is widely available. These facts combine to make a highly drinkable beer."
"Drinkability is nice, still a more than average lager. I wish it had more of a pungent aroma, though."
"This could be the most trite review I've done to date. Nothing much to illuminate on his brew. Everyone knows it's strengths. This is usually the fallback beer of choice when selection is not available. Clear copper. Nice head. Crisp citric hop taste with malty grain backing. Clean and tasty, this brew serves it's purpose well."
"There is very little complexity in this beer (didn't expect otherwise), but it isn't half-bad for being macro-ish."
"I think the main thing to say about this beer is that it is good. I've had a limited number of Vienna Lagers but this one did not miss the mark. You get sweet caramel as expected and a small but pleasant hop bite. In the couple times I've had this on tap, the second time seemed a little to watery/uncarbonated for the style. It still wasn't that bad that time."
"A muscular blonde with serious density. Busty and thick legged with a heavy lusty swallow to it. A come hither lager that walks on its own and sits on your lap and stays for drinks after a show. You may even want to call it toots if you're brash and chauvanistic enough. But I'd just call it lunch or dinner if I was a better man."
"D=Very drinkable as most lagers are..."
"D - tasty beer, and the drinkability gets a small boost because it's always a safe standby. Don't recognize any of the other taps? SA Boston Lager is always a safe choice for a flavorful, well made beer."
"I just realized that I hadn't reviewed this one yet. Probably my favorite American beer at the moment. Ask me tomorrow and it might change. I just drank four and wish I had more. Highly recommended."
"Taste is full of pleasing caramel, tangy hops, and a bit of sweetness. It's too bad you can't find this in a plentiful amount in Seattle or I think I'd buy it often. Light carbonation tantalizes and pleases. Great drinkability in my opinion. A satisfying beer."
"Subjective notes: This is pretty versatile. It's nice and refreshing when served very cold (such as when you're given one at a party and it's been in a cooler), or when it's served slightly chilled, and it has more pronounced breadiness when you let it warm to not-quite room temperature. Is FAR better when it's served around 45 or so degrees F. I know there's a bit of hubbub about the micro/macro distinction, but I don't particularly care. I'm thrilled whenever I find myself in a McBar that has heavy BMC representation, and find this on tap. Plus, as vienna lagers go, it's pretty solid."
"Probably the pick-of-the-litter at a local seafood resturaunt that sells ok seafood for a rediculous price. They also sell beer that way too. Kinda disapointed with the SA Boston Lager. I often have this on tap, but from the bottle, it seemed to loose much. The maltiness never came through with the bready, toasty, rich character in flavor or texture. The taste was all spice, and the feel was almost prickly to the toung. Aromas were nice (after the beer warmed to above freezing), of American hop character--very Sierra Nevada Pale Ale-like. Finished with a (dare I say) grain-hull bite-ey-ness. Basically under-bodied, under-malted in comparison to what I'm used to in this beer. May have been past its prime."
"Light amber color with a nice head. Aroma is a light mix of malt and hops. Flavor is a nicely balanced, light malty-sweet taste with a bit of a hops finish. Good, but subtle. Mouthfeel is light. Drinkability is very good, as this beer is tasty but not very strong in bold flavors or alcohol."
"balanced, drinkable lager on tap. nothing fancy but doesn't fail at fancy games either."
"This poured a nice dark amber leaving a decent head that sat happily on the top, leaving some lacing. Smell is very hoppy, there is nothing offensive in the smell of this brew. The hops are well carried in the flavor, with a very pronounced bitterness that some may have a hard time handling. (I know I didn't care for this one much when I was younger.) Overall this is a well made, well hopped lager that I would most certainly invite to my fridge again."
"Poured a light copper color, with a moderate head. Smell was nice balance of malt and hops, as was the taste, although the hop flavor won out over the malt, resulting in a slightly bitter finish. Very refreshing and easy to drink."
"Drinkability: Very nice Vienna Lager: dry finish definitely helps drinkability, it's flavorful enough that you want to keep drinking, while light enough that you can. Where there aren't many other options, this is a great standby."
"D: good drinkability but most lagers tend to have that going for them"
"Drinkability - very good."
"The beer looks okay, but the smell and the taste are disgusting. Like it's infused with sulphur making it smell strange, also affecting the taste and the aftertaste. Drank a couple more two days later. No improvement. Gave it one last chance on tap at my favorite pub, still rotten."
"drinkability = very good session beer and goes down very easy."
"Nothing bad and the simplicity of the beer makes it very drinkable. Combine that with the fact that it's so frequently far-and-away the best beer available at bars and restaurants, and I thank the powers that be for Sam Adams Boston Lager."
"I will look for a fresh 6 pack, but only once in a while."
"This is a really good lager. I believe Sam Adams does truly represent a return to flavorful beer in the widely distributed and mass marketed beer varieties."
"Overall, a classic.A great beer you can always fall back on."
"If I would have discovered this brew early on it could have been the one to turn me on to craft beer (luckily I was introduced to Pete's). An easy drinking session brew."
"D - high drinkability, a great ice-breaker for the Bud-drinker into the world of craft"
"Sam Adams gets a bad rap because they have become commercial. But they should be commercial. This is a terrific, classic, microbrew (yes it is a micro). Sam Adam's beers are always full of flavor and always produces a creamy head, this one being no exception. Great summer beer! Nice micro smell and has a slight hop kickback. A terrific starter brew for those who have never had one."
"As many times as I've had this staple brew, have never reviewed it. S.A.B.L. pours an almost clear, light brown color, with minimal white head. Its smell is mostly roasted malts with a bit of citrus hops. There is also a nice sweetness to finish. A good, clean, crisp aroma. Taste is again dominated by malt and hops. Not terribly bitter or complex, but a pleasing swallow nonetheless. In the mouth, this beer isn't very full-bodied. But it does have a decent, crisp and sharp pull on the tongue. On the whole, this is a pretty classic American Beer. It has been much maligned and much respected by many B.A's all at once. I for one have always appreciated Sam Lager for what it is: a very fine and eminently drinkable--if none too complex--brew."
"A well done lager, and certainly good for large scale comsumption."
"Pristine copper gold with a thin, off-white, bubbly head. Aroma is mostly toasted malt, spicy german hops, and a light caramel sweetness. Firm, clean sweet malt flavor; crisp, earthy, spicy hoppiness. Medium body, solid bitterness has some bite to it...a little creamy in the finish. Great session beer all around."
"This beer is easy to drink, and you can have many in one night. This is a reliable fall back beer to get at a bar that has nothing good on tap, or a small bottle selection."
"Poured a medium golden color with large white puffy head. Smell is malrty sweet and very understated. Taste is initiallly hoppy but a suprisingly strong hop bitterness also presents itself. Very crisp and freshing. Nice crisp, refreshing mouthfeel that is very pleasurable. A very nice beer. I enjoyed it."
"While I like VERY dark and strong beers more, I would certainly take this over Sam Adam's Black Lager any day!"
"An extremely drinkable lager beer with just enough flavor to keep it interesting. A staple beer."
"This is one of my personal favorites that is available just about everywhere you go. As good as it is in the bottle, it is even better on tap. The hops seem to explode in your mouth and are enhanced much more than from the bottle. The appearance is amber with a decent head. Aroma is sweet with a salivating malt and hop aroma. The taste is sweet malt and caramel. I am not a huge hop fan, but the hops fit in very nicely with this brew and they do not seem out of place. This is a wonderful session beer and I almost always order it at a bar if it is available."
"Tried the draft version as this was the only non-Bud/Miller tap available at the sorts bar where we were watching the game. Nice dark amber color (OK, dark compared to the Buds and MGDs at the table). The head is thin but had good stability, thin creamy strings af lace slide down the glass. Some sweet smell of caramel malt, and nice floral hops aroma at the end. Lots of flavor, including sweet caramel malt and a nice spicy bitter finish. So good, I had to order another one. Now that I know, will search this one out when the draft selections are hurting."
"The mouthfeel has a medium body with decent cleansing. Overall, while not my favorite style of beer, this is a decent beer that I've had many times and will probably have many more times. Good session beer that goes well with a variety of beer food that you can get at most bars."
"Eric"
"D: Good, flavorfull, easy drinking beer"
"D: Very drinkable."
"Certainly a better beer than most macros, but better examples of the style are out there."
"Overall this is a beer that macro party folk who don't even know the treasure they hold in their hands could potentially enjoy, while drinkers that know what good beer is can also truly appreciate despite the mass availability. What I always wonder is, how did a beer with this much hops get so popular? I'm glad it did, but it amazes me. A revolutionary beer for the history and the world of microbrews, and it tastes great too."
"One of the true examples of craft beer pioneerism. Unfortunately an original recipe has been surprised by more aggressive, more intense, ultimately better beer/styles. I remember having this beer twenty years ago, good then, decent now. There have been so many reviews of this beer that whatever I say has been said before. A classic nonetheless."
"Cheers! :)"
"Pours a deep rich gold with a large white head. Not much smell other than hops and a bit of malt. The taste that is very smooth and interesting, and is quite a shock considering the lack of aroma. A bit more hoppy for a lager but really adds a distinct flavor that you can appreciate. This beer has a smooth and inviting mouthfeel, with a great balance and excellent carbonation. This is a beer that goes with almost everything and anyone can enjoy it. Another good beer from Sam Adams, a great price for the quality you get. Enjoy!"
"I really enjoyed this lager, all the way to the end. Creamy head, hoppy, low carbonation...works great for me. I have no problem getting this beer over and over again. It went down smooth, and I can see myself drinking a lot of these at one sitting just because of how good it is."
"D- This beer is well-balanced but crisp and clean. It was nice to see good strong flavors in a lager that really made this a nice session beer."
"My taste has come a very long way. A hell of a session beer. I may just have a new favorite."
"Judging from my drinking spots, this seems to be a popular beer right now. Ithink it's just OK. It is a nice amber color with a fairly thick head and some nice lacing. It has a sweet, roasted grain odor. It tastes good, but ordinary. Caramel, some nice hops. Decent body, and fairly drinkable, but nothing special."
"Drinkability - Beer wore on me. Too bitter with no other defined tastes. Other types of Sam Adams are much better."
"Revisiting this beer. I'm still impressed by its appearance: frothy head, good lacing, nice clear copper-gold color, and beading. The smell is faint, hinting at a crisp, slightly sweet maltiness and some noble hops. Flavor delivers just that: a very low sweet maltiness, along with potent carbonation and a good deal of spicy, leafy hop character. This is a decent beer, but I don't really prefer it much to something like PBR."
"O: A perfect change of pace when you are used to the Stouts and IPAs of the world. Vienna malt is evident and noble hops make this an impressive Premium American Lager. Sam Adams is NOT a Vienna Style Lager; it is an American Macro Lager with vienna malt and noble hallertau hops added."
"Could drink this beer all night long. Just an all around great original american micro."
""
"Bottle: Poured a deep copper color beer with an above average size foamy white had with good retention. Aroma is hoppier then expected with a good clean sweet malt presence. Taste is quite sweet with a nice mix between sweet malt and a clean crisp slightly bitter finish. With more character then expected, this is a quite good session lager."
"Anyway, the beer poured a beautiful clear coppery color that had a large bubbled 0.5 inch head. The head faded to a lace on the top of the beer that hung around to the end and tried to lace the glass (I was in a hotel room so proper glassware was not available unless a 8 oz tea glass is the new standard.) An aroma of toasty malts and floral hops. Mainly tasted of hop oils with a minimum of sweetness. The taste was more pale ale than lager. A little heavy on the carbonation and left the mouth a little drier than usual. Overall a very drinkable beer."
"I guess this is a session beer at heart. It competes with Great Lakes Dortmunder Gold in my refrigerator. I remember the Boston Ale as being more flavorful, but it's been a while."
"This is one of my favourites for session drinking. They've really done a great job creating a palatable microbrew that doesn't try to be a macro."
"D- maybe id drink it again, maybe not. depends on my options out there."
"I've been drinking this beer for years, but this review is written for the glass I had during the Sam Adams brewery tour in Boston. The appearance is a beautiful, clear darker amber color with good carbonation. The nose is mild (I would like to be able to smell more of the hops). Taste is very smooth, somewhat malty with very mild hops bitterness. The finish is also mild and lasts about 10 to 15 seconds."
"Color was somewhat dark and very full. Nice aroma as well. Taste lies in the middle of dark and light. It's a great beer that I highly recommend. It is one of the best beers I've ever had. There was obviously a lot of dedication and passion that went into this beer."
"Samuel Adams Boston Lager pours a dark golden color with a white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The smell is reminiscent of citrusy hops. Taste also is dominated by a citrusy hop flavor. Really a very sessionable beer. One of the best lagers I've tasted."
"Samuel Adams. Reddish-brown appearance, smells like toned down IPA, nice malt profile. Tastes like a toned down IPA, malty. Nicely carbonated, crisp. Great session brew. Before I had respect for beer, the first time I tasted this I yacked (I also thought Heineken was the best beer!) But then again I was only about 16."
"Basically, this is what I'll have if the other options are Bud and MGD. It's never going to blow me away, but it's a solid, decently flavourful option that is easy to find. You could do much, much worse."
"they say its a macro..but it tastes like a micro...gotta love it."
"Around here, most places have this beer as the only alternative to macros (if they have one at all) and it definitely seems to be to me the perfect transition from macro to micro, which is what has made Boston Beer Co. what it is today."
"It's all about the gulp! It seems like whenever I buy a six-pack of this it's all gone within 2-3 hours. Low enough alcohol to session, way enough flavor to session. Perfect."
"I think this beer is underappreciated but its really grown on me. In my pre BA days (or wanna be BA days) I thought it was too bitter, but now I recognize how balanced and delicious. It pours a golden copper with a nice healthy head and lacing. The aroma is slightly toasted bready malt with spicyhops in the background. The taste is a great balance between the bitter hops and slightly fruity maltiness backing it up. This is a great go to beer when the only other options are BMC."
"Overall impression: An American classic. Hard to find any flaws with this one. Not my favorite style but very approachable. A good place for people to start. Recommended."
"I could drink a good amount of these and still really enjoy them. It's a beer that's everywhere I'm more than proud to drink!"
"Poured from a bottle into a stein, it's a good looking beer. It's a crystal clear, coppery brew with a nice eggshell white head. Lacing could be better, but it's a very good looking lager anyway. The smell is nice, a mild malt and hop aroma. It could have a bit stronger nose, but it's pleasant nonetheless. The flavor is quite good. It's an excellent balance of hops and lightly roasted malt. It's a close call whether there's more malt or more hop flavor. All in all, it's a very nice, well balanced lager. The Boston Lager is a very easy to drink beer. A very solid session beer by any standard."
"The taste was also a surprise. I'll be honest, with my previous experiences in the American lager I wasn't expecting much from this, but I was very pleasantly surprised. The hops are very tasty but not too aparent. It's still a refreshing beer which isn't too heavy. Overall a great, great brew which is readily available (and for a decent price). A staple in the American beer market."
"First of the style for me and I am very pleased will be buying agian."
"This beer goes does easy and makes a great session brew. I have to say that this beer is kind of a sentimental favorite. It was the first beer that got me into better beers. My taste buds have grown but I still enjoy a Sams from time to time. It is an excellant beer to have if you just want to kick back and relax after a hard day. It isn't a complex beer that you have to pay a lot of attention too but it can also be pretty damn tasty. It's also a good BBQ beer."
"Pours a crystal clear golden amber color with a nice, thick white head that leaves excellent lacing. The aroma starts out with biscuity pale malt, caramel, along with some slightly spicy, floral hops. The flavor has a nice biscuity malt presence, along with some caramel sweetness, hop oils and spicy, floral hops along with some bread dough finish out the taste. The mouthfeel is medium with lively carbonation and a slightly bitter finish. An excellent vienna lager, extremely drinkable and complex enough to satisfy beer geeks."
"Have been purchasing this lager recently from my local Canadian Brewers Retail in small amount (6 pack here/6 pack there). Have been subject to some not too flattering remarks pertaining to me not buying a Canadian product, however my retort of quality over quantity hopefully hit home. Pours to a very rich amber colour (I followed the directions on the bottle). Ample lacing with serious retention. Had a very subtle well balanced hop bitterness that added to the experience. Have had many of these Vienna style Lagers over the years and was never overly impressed with the longevity of taste. Sam's Lager, however passed the test completely. A session beer if ever their was one."
"Pours a pleasing amber color with a good solid head that retains very well. Good lacing. Nose is well balanced, with noticable hop character and a solid malt foundation. The taste plays along with a good malty profile upfront, and a pleasing hop bitterness behind. This one tastes considerably better than ANY macro lager. Suprisingly complex and well crafted. Mouthfeel is light-meduim, with good carbonation and a substantive finish ... heavy on the hop dryness. I really genuinely like this beer, and I'm not a huge lager fan in general. Thank God for Sam Adam's and it's availability. It would be nice to have more of the SA collection available around here on tap, but I'm not complaining. I can always count on this one to be a solid, enjoyable beer ... and I count on it often."
"This is what I call my staple beer. It is perfect with everything and is always availible. This is everything a lager should be."
"Man it really hit the spot. As always, i thank God for Sam Adams, sometimes the only beer many places have other than BMC. There is simply no comparison. SA has come to my rescue many times, and i look forward to future rescue operations. Yum."
"from the bottle. poured a nicec amber with a white head that left some nice lacing. aroma. got the usual malts, hops, some spiceyness. flavor got the same malts, hops with a hint of caramel. for just drink without any high expectation this beer came through a very easy drinking beer went well with the pizza. this is the one to serve o your bud friends"
"Note: This was excellent with my grilled buffalo chicken sandwich. The spiciness of the buffalo sauce and the sweetness of the beer made for a nice flavor. I would highly recommend this with buffalo wings or sandwiches."
"This beer has been one of my favorites since it was introduced way back in the mid to late 80's. In many grocery stores and bars, this is the only craft brew that is available and that makes it a good fall back beer. On to my review. This beer pours a clear light amber color with a one inch head that dissipates slowly. The smell is malty, with a pleasing aroma of hops wafting from the glass. Taste is also malty and sweet, with a pleasant hop bitterness in the finish. This beer leaves a slight citrusy aftertaste in my mouth that blends well with the sweetness of the malt. I don't think this beer's character has changed at all over the years. Jim Koch continues to brew this beer as tasty as it was nearly 20 years ago. I'll take this any day over BMC."
"There is much more of a pronounced hop flavor and bitterness, which become the driving forces behind this beer's success. Crisp, robust noble hops combine with the lager's inherent snappiness to create a rather enjoyable, drinkable beer. There's still enough malt to provide some beef to go along with the hops but I feel that hop character is really what can seperate bottled Sam Adams from its draft counterpart. One slight knock, however, is that I feel this brew is just a tad overcarbonated, most likely to appeal to the expectations of the larger beer-drinking market."
"Possible the best macro-lager on the market. Makes a nice session beer if you're short on choices. Not only that, but it brings back good memories for me."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Superior. That is all. Slick, then smooth... a pleasure in the mouth. The balance here is so easy and effortless, it's no wonder this beer has stood the test of time. Possibly the greatest session beer in America."
"I've had a few Boston Lagers that seemed less inviting than this, but that was several years ago and perhaps it's my tastebuds that have changed. Flavor is wonderful, not too bitter, not too sweet, not very complex but full, with a slight bite (due more to bitter hops than alcohol, certainly, as this is low ABV). Hops profile is great, good caramel/malt character too. Round, creamy tone in the mouth. You can always depend on this one for daily drinkability."
"I have yet to have a bad Samuel Adams Boston Lager! Even if the date on the side has passed, it is still better tasting than 85% of mass produced American beers. This lager on tap is just amazing and from a bottle to a nice chilled mug is just as good.. From the color to the aroma to the taste to the last drop of your liter glass. This one never dissapoints."
"My condolences to the folks in Boston."
"I can dig it."
"Golden in color with a carmel color head. Decent lacing on the glass as the beer was consumed. Good amount of carbonation. Smells of hops and grain typical of a Sam Adams brew. Good balance of flavor and very drinkable. I'm sure that the growth of Sam Adams has bothered some, but I find that I can get this very decent beer almost anywhere in the States. For a good micro to grow into the mainstream is a positive any way you look at it."
"This is far from the first time I've enjoyed this brew, but this is the first time I've had did since becoming a BA. Poured a clear, slightly amber hued golden color with a foamy white one finger head before quickly falling away to light lacing. Smell is fresh and clean hops, faint sweetness of grain, somewhat citrusy. Tastes of crisp fruit, balanced well between hops and malt, a little hop spiciness present, leaves a hint of grain flavor in the aftertaste along with some malt as well. Would pair well with many foods, i.e. steaks, pizza, burgers. Mouthfeel is light and well carbonated, exceptional drinkability, could easily drink many of these in one night. Great session beer, would seek out again over any macro."
"What can be said about this SA? Whether from the bottle or on tap, this is always a solid beer. Had this on-tap at The Library in Farmingdale, NY. Nice amber appearance, light head, and nice subtle smell. Tastes great -- crisp but not too much carbonation. The mouthfeel is excellent -- really a beer you can spend all night drinking. Goes great with a nice steak or burger."
"This bottle was part of a Samuel Adam's winter mix pack. The code R 2445 14:13 4W is printed on the neck of the bottle."
"This beer is constant as the northern star, guiding all beer lovers to great taste. Shoot me now. hahaha"
"This is also a beer that offers an excellent example of how freshness improves a beer. I can usually guess it's expiration date within a few months from the first sip. On the occasion when you get a really fresh example with an expiration date a good 6 months out you can really tell what a difference it makes."
"Drinkability: Much maligned but nevertheless a decent beer, particularly if you are in a bar that has nothing else but macro lagers"
"The color is an amber/copper color, with frothy off white head. The scent of roasted barley and a toch of earty hoppiness comes through.The first intial thing in the taste is the barley and right the end is the hops. Lite and crisp in the mouth and the hops give it a nice dry finish. For a lager this a great flavor, which makes it incredibly drinkable."
"D - Well made. Easy drinking. Satisfying. Plenty of flavor."
"D - It is a drinkable brew, one of the best that Sam Adams offers. It is a good session beer (after the third I bet the alcohol is invisible to the tastebuds!) And would pair well with many foods. I would take this over a Yuengling, or a macro lager . . . that's about all though. Oh, except for of course any other Sam Adams offering."
"Overall: So strange that I never got round to submitting a Review for this well known beverage, in fact I was well into the 3rd bottle in my 6-Pack before I realized I had not done so. It may well be considered as the ubiquitous high-volume craft brew, and get slammed for that, but this beer alone has made many layovers in Airports and trips to crappy bars all over the US that much more palatable since I came to the States 4 years ago, it deserves a medal for that alone. Easy to slam this beer for all the wrong reasons, but for me, it is what it is and it does what it has to, Im sure as hell glad this beer is here and I continue to enjoy it for all the right reasons. Tends to be a little better from the bottle than on draft I find. Long may it be that well-exercised option that provides respite from the big-3."
"Drinkability: This is a great session beer. With that alone, it deserves a 5."
"The biscuity malt character of this beer and subtle hop profile make a highly enjoyable beer without needing extreme flavors or high alcohol. Nearly a perfect session craft beer because of it's relatively low price, high availability, and very consistent quality between batches. I always forget how good this is, then I order it at a bar and it never fails to impress me. An epitome of balance, this is just a great beer that has snuck into mainstream America..you can get this pretty much anywhere, and I thank God (and the Boston Beer Company) for that."
"This beer &SNPA set me on the road to redemption, Good session beer drinking that takes me back to the mid-90s, still satisfies. But never tasted one beer in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, or CZ that had this hops taste, weird"
"Drinkability: This beer is a very easy to drink treat. This will prove to be a reliable back up in the future."
"All in all, a very drinkable brew. Additionally, it's found nearly everywhere, and as such is a great fallback brew if nothing much more than BMC is available. A classic."
"Poured a 1 finger head that dissipated. Coppery color with active carbonation. Hops in the forefront and a little malt in the background. Taste is hoppy but very well balanced with the malt. Good solid beer. Pretty highly carbonated. A little thin, if it was a bit richer it would be even better. This is a great drinking beer. Its definitely a fall back beer when I can't decide what I want or nothing exciting is on the bar/restaurant menu."
"Hoppy but with strong balance, slight chocolate, moderate ""dusty"" flavor (?), very full-bodied. Good lacing. Orange/copper color with substantial foamy, gobby, thick head. Orange peel. A smooth and even-handed maltiness towards the back, followed by sweet, cloying backtaste that requires--nay, mandates by penalty of death!--another swig."
"Overall - An excellent beer.... Recommended..."
"Pours a clear burnt orange with a creamy thick white head, with very good retention. Smell was a wonderful waft of about piney noble hops, with some bready malt creeping in after a few swirls. Taste was an explosion of noble hops and slightly sweet malt, more bread, yet very well balanced and clean. This is a joy to drink, totally unexpected and easily one of the best lagers I've ever had. On tap I'd drink this all night."
"Note: My first Sam Adams. This brewery does not disappoint. Forget all the micro/macro controversy, this beer's quality speaks well for this brewery."
"I enjoy this beer. It is a nice medium dark lager, and I buy it fairly frequently, especially I the fall. Sam Adams Boston Lager is a good alternative to the mega-brews, but really nothing special."
"This is another of my favorite brews. Nothing unique here. Just a good lager that's really been done right. I've had this both on tap and in the bottle, but I chose a draft beer for this review because for me the draft works pretty well with this beer. The appearance is a rather dark tan, this is probably the darkest lager I've seen. The head is usually moderate but well formed and stable. I seem to recall this beer being pitched by floating the bottle cap on the head. Anyway appearance is pleasant and beerlike but not the least bit unusual. Really the color is just about typical of the beer I usually drink. Only the head is a little different, being a bit longer lived. Smell is also straightforward. Its a hearty mix of (surprise!) yeast and malt. Definately some caramel too, and in spite of the strength of the smell its still a very clean smell. As with pretty much every beer I've ever had, the smell was reflected in the taste. This is a relatively rich, sweet brew that is balanced by a strong hop presence. The famous ""two row barley"" (Boston Beer Co likes to remind you this is a high quality and expensive ingredient, but damned if I know its exact significance) makes for malt flavor that's deep and rich, but still very clean. The hops are one of my favorites ever. They provide a perfect balance, and though they're strong and pretty bitter they are also quite flavorfull and the bitterness does cross the line to become what I consider excessive. However, they don't suggest any specific ""notes"" that I can think of, just hops. In case you're as big a fan of the hops used in this beer as I am, samualadams.com tells me they are ""German Noble aroma hops"". Mouthfeel is a little on the thick side, but usually does not inhibit the drinkability. Sometimes a Sam Adams is exactly what I feel like, and then its really a beer to be savored. Sometimes it turns out to be a good session beer for me, other times it weights on me after a glass or two and I have to switch to something lighter. While Yuengling Traditional is my top favorite, this is one of my favorites. To me its sort of like Yuengling's older (in style, obviously not the age of the brewery) and heartier cousin. It has a bit more depth than Yuengling, and its thicker. Sometimes this is just what I'm craving, sometimes Yuengling's even easier flavor and superior drinkability make me reach for it first. Anyway, as many other people will probably tell you, there's nothing this isn't complicated, it isn't fancy, its not exotic. Its just a hearty lager that they took the time to really do right. If I had to offer a lager to a more experienced beer drinker who tends to turn his/her nose up at Lagers in general because they're too wimpy and don't have enough flavor I'd probably go with this even though its very unlikely I'd be broadening their horizons any."
" This is overall respectable and likable beer, although not overly exciting. Easy to quaff, and a good fall back option for swill bars that carry only the big name macros."
"The carbonation and body were really nice. It felt solid in the mouth at least. It's good that this is available as many places as it is because it makes a decent backup beer when the other selections suck. I wouldn't order this as my first choice, but that is mostly because I prefer a solid pale ale over anything else so the cleanness and lack of any fruitiness aren't my cup of tea."
"Drinkability: I never used to like Sam Adams Boston Lager, but it has grown on me (maybe there is something in their seasonals that has increased my appreciation). I still don't like it as a session beer, but I've come to appreciate it as a reliable, well made beer that is easily and readily available."
"Notes and Drinkability: Koch claims nothing beyond the German Purity Laws are used in this brew - which holds back from many robust flavours that you see in many popular ales these days. This is exactly what I look for in a lager, and this for me is the prime example of one. A great session brew, a backup beer that I have no problem turning to."
"After my last Sam Adams, I was hoping this one would be an improvement. I am happy to say it was. The beer pours out the color of sourwood honey. I was unprepared for the head on it. It had a thick head that was about two fingers. The head had the appearance of fresh fallen snow. The smell is similar to a good red beer. The taste is somewhere between a quality light beer and a red beer. The mouthfeel is exceptional. No bite whatsoever. As a result, I could drink these all night. This would certainly be a session beer. I think a 12 of these will come along with me in a couple weeks to the annual New Year's Eve bonfire. A good beer I will certainly drink again and again."
"To be honest, the first time I had Sam Adams was a bad experience, it was warm and skunked, so I chose not to review it then to be fair. I finally had the courage to try it again and was pleasantly surprised. The beer pours a nice copper color with a decent head. Fairly well balanced in my opinion and I could not find much I didn't like about this beer. This beer will not give you something new, but it will treat you to a solid beer that you can enjoy over the course of a night."
"Pours a copper orange with a sturdy white head. This is a robust, ""Old World"" smelling and tasting lager. Sweet, grassy, toasty malt profile, bready with a spicy kick and a hint of hop bitterness to round it out. Mouthfeel is full-bodied with biting carbonation. For being the standard lager of an almost macrobrewery, I was mightily impressed. An easy-drinking, rich and flavorful lager, that is worth its billing as solid fall-back beer for many a craftbrew drinker."
"This is a great beer. Not the greatest in the world by any means but this is what brought myself and others to the world of something else than BMC. Dark amber pour, fuzzy head that doesn't last too long. Nice malty taste with real noticeable hops. Finishes real nice. The best part of this it's found anywhere and when your stuck in a bar full of macros, this one is usually present too. Thank you Jim Koch!!"
"This is not the best beer, but it's probably the best beer you can get just about anywhere. An American classic, and one I've enjoyed for years."
"Cheers!"
"~Very drinkable beer, very enjoyable. Even though other categories are lower, drinkability scores high."
"Fantastic. I could down these all night long without getting tired. Yum"
"A nice enough lager, with good color, carbonation, and plenty of flavor. Malt presence is far from overwhelming and the hop balance is very subtle, so this beer is quite easy to enjoy."
"This beer came a very clear golden brown with a creamy, slightly tan, dry head that left a little lacing around the top few inches of the glass. Smelled like sour skunky corn chips with a hint of lime and a tiny bit of dryness. Tasted of smooth non-aggressive lager sourness, with some good wheat and oat flavors along with an apple and raspberry sweetness. This beer finished with a crisp hop dryness. The mouth feel was thick with playful small bubble carbonation. This beer is fantastically drinkable as its flavors are very subdued, and well done at the same time. Also, the mouth feel makes this a very easy beer to drink."
"Pours a light copper color with small white head that turns to a nice lacing. Smell is a nice balance between hops and malt. The malt tastes hits you up front followed by hops in the back end of the drink. The beer is smooth with some carbonation. This makes for a great session beer due to the low alcohol content and good taste."
"12 oz. bottle, best before March 2006. Clear golden-brown, moderate carbonation, pristine white and fluffy head with adequately sticky lacing. Nose is spicy hops and doughy yeast. Hallertau spice at the front of the tongue, impressive tasty biscuit middle, dry hoppy finish. Juicy mouthfeel, and very drinkable. Always a good option early in the day or when other, more ""special"" craft brews aren't available. Consistent quality despite growth gets BBC many props from me."
"Drinkability is good. You could drink this one all night if you favor the style. Again, it goes down smooth and is tasty. Low alcohol makes it a very good beer for parties. The prototypical cross-over for macro drinkers."
"This brew kicks arse"
"had this with my dinner last night after listening to a review on craft beer radio podcast. poured a very clear, golden and lightly-amber in a pint glass. nice 2 inch foamy slightly off-white head with good retention and lacing down the glass. sweet caramelly aroma with a very evident and surprising floral hop aroma. i didn't expect the hops from a sam adams lager. first sip is caramel malt. balancing lightly spicy hop flavor with good bitterness. nice balancing hop character. finishes a touch try with a light toastiness. light-medium body with good carbonation and a decent swallow that clunks just a tad. very drinkable session brew with good flavor and no apparent alcohol. i haven't tasted this in propbably 4 years or more until last night. excellent session brew if you're strapped for more flavorful options. one of my new non-micro favorites."
"The Boston Ale is good, the lager is a bad rep of a Vienna lager."
"Thanks Jim Koch!"
"The beer pours a nice amber/brown color with a gold sizeable frothy head that laces nicely. It smells of some good hops with some sweet malty smell. It tastes nicely sweet with some mixed in good bitterness. Basically a great flavor overall for this style. It feels moderately thick with some good carbonation. This is definitely one of my favorite lagers."
"As stated before, this is a fallback beer for me as I imagine that it is for most BAs. The thing that I appreciate the most about The Boston Beer Companies products is the fact that they are consistent. I dont rank this beer incredibly high, but I really appreciate the dependability of this brewer and its products."
"This would be a fantastic session beer , because it is so balanced and smooth , but it costs a premium ,so ,alas will be a special treat beer only"
"This beer pours a golden yellow with a white head. The head fades slowly, leaving few laces. This beer has a crisp refreshing aroma. It has a slight caramel aroma. It smells sweet. There is also a slight hop aroma. Not piney , just floral. This beer has a clean crisp taste. I can taste a caramel sweet flavor. The hop presence is light, but refreshing. It has a slight spicy finish. It goes down very smooth, leaving a malty sweet aftertaste. I think this beer would make an excelent session beer. It is refreshing, and it tastes good. Also, it is not high in alcohol. I usually have a six pack of this stuff in my second refrigerator. It is good to drink, and it is acceptable by those that do not yet like craft beer."
"Cheers!"
"What can you really say about this well known Boston creation. I personally am not a large fan of macrobreweries, however, I enjoy some of the high quality brews that Samuel Adams produces. With that being said, let me speak about the Boston Lager. I poured the lager into my Sam Adams pint glass, and noticed a very golden-like hue. At the top of the glass formed a very nice white head, which stayed througout my drink. The nose of the beer was full of fruits and some nice maltiness. The taste of the beer wasn't as good as the smell. I was expecting more of a sweeter taste, however, seemed a little bland with a little spice at the end. The mouth feel was average, and of course the drinkability is quite high. Must say that for an American macrobrew, it is enjoyable. Can put a few of these back easily during the course of a night."
"This beer, and brewery, demand respect."
"Pours an orange mahogany with perfect clarity. A creamy 1 1/2 finger head shows excellent retention and leaves good sticky lacing. American hop nose, with some toasted crystal malt. The taste is caramel and crystal malt upfront, then some sweet munich malts come out. The aftertaste is herbal american hops and leaves a semi-dry bitter finish with slight residual sweetness. Lightly carbonated,and medium in body with a mouthfeel that is both crisp and smooth. Hop flavor is more pronounced on-tap, and perhaps a bit stronger than appropriate, but the rich malt profile makes a nice balance. Full flavored and highly drinkable, it's no mystery why this wins awards."
"Pours a clear medium-dark amber with a small, slightly off-white, foamy head that quickly diminishes to a thin film. The smell is mild and bready with light herbal hops backing it up. Pleasant caramel aroma. It has a good balance of flavors: caramel, grain, citrus, and a little tea-like. It has a very nice dry, lightly citrus finish, a medium body, and soft carbonation. I forgot how good this beer is for being one thats so widely available. Its an all around satisfying and easy drinking beer, that was a great transition beer for me."
"This guy is solid. Great hops, through and through. It is dry but not bitingly bitter. The malt balances it with some sweetness but always a bite of dryness there. Through and through, a great beer, an excellent benchmark."
"Overall: This is really a nice little lager, and readily available most places. Definitely a good alternative to try."
"Overall: A very good to excellent lager. Not a premium beer, but definitely several cuts above most of what is usually available at the local sports bar."
"This is one fine session beer. The price to character ratio, makes this an ideal beer for supplying large thirsty groups. On-top of that it is not too great of a shock for macro-lager drinkers. Combine that with Jim Kochs recent spate of beer- drinker education propaganda on the labels and this makes a very effective conversion tool. Utility aside, this is one of the few lagers I drink by choice."
"Low ABV, big Flavor, not a combination you will find too often. This is the flagship beer from boston brewing company and it stands up to that label. The best of the standard offerings by a long shot."
"-Cheers2Beers"
"Though this is not my favorite style of beer, I must say that this is a much better beer than I remember."
"It's a perfect beer for drinking with the guys. Even ardent male BMC drinkers will have it (get the light if there are ardent female BMC drinkers. . . I found that out the hard way) and enjoy it, and ardent beer nerds will drink it without complaint. Good stuff. Good, good stuff."
"This would make an outstanding session beer. I could dispatch several of these without regard to my palate and its relatively low abv wouldnt have me at the dreaded I love you, man unless I emptied a crapload of bottles."
"The beer departs the bottle a deep copper color with perfect clarity and a finger of head that sits nicely over the beer, falling at a moderately slow pace. Nose is light toasty and toffee sweetness with a mild noble hop. I was not expecting that hop. Flavor is toasty and sweet...not caramel, but similar, with a moderate grainy finish, balancing out with a light bitterness that just lets you know there are some hops in there. Very tasty beer. I'm not as crazy about the grainy finish. Feel is moderate with a moderate carbonation. I really enjoy this brew. The grainy, hop, sweet balance is really nice. This is a beer I could keep around"
"A decent addition to the local (Dublin, Ireland) scene."
"A solid standby beer found everywhere. In a pinch, Sam Adams does the job."
"D: A first-class American lager, and a classic. The best widely available American beer in America."
"Overall impression: A very well made lager - when this is fresh it is hard to beat. Great gateway beer - most people have heard of it and even the BMC crowd can enjoy it."
"Overall, a pleasant surprise. This is the first one I have had fresh in a while. Usually I get something that has sat for a while at a BMC type place. Very good fresh. Could drink it all day and it would still stay interesting. If you purchase, check the best by dates. This one turns rather soon after the best by."
"Well I'm quite taken with this brew. For a strange reason it reminds me of a lighter version of a Wee Heavy. A definate recommended beer."
"Pours a rocky head that laces well, and keeps a nice collar throughout. It's a light golden color with absolute clarity. Smell is of sweet toasted malts and a touch of floral hops. Taste is sweet toastiness upfront, and remains so with hops gently edging into the picture and drying out through the finish. Very clean malt flavors and spicy, floral hops. Terrific balance. Mouthfeel is light with solid carbonation, and it is highly sessionable. A standby for when there is nothing else."
"This is a truly remarkable macro (Boston Beer Co. can hardly be labelled microbrewery) premium lager from the US ... pours a beautiful bronze colour with a small but firm head ... smell and taste are equally satisfying ... the interesting thing is it's very dry bitterness albeight in colour and taste barley is more present than the hops ... seems like the brewer was able to integrate the whole barley sweetness .... the result: an aperitif which stands competition with the likes of Pilsner Urquell or Jever ...."
"D - Highly drinkable. Definitely one I've had all night at the bar."
"Extremely enjoyable. I will buy this again."
"Great job Sam Adams."
"Pours a nice golden yellow, nice carbonation, nice medium head. Not a whole lot of lacing though. Scents of malts. Very nice taste a hint of something I cannot put my finger on though. Medium body. Very drinkable, makes a very nice session brew. Another nice beer from Samuel Adams."
"Also, my best friend's daughter is now a chemist employed by the Boston Brewing Co. She reports that Koch is just a lush and no longer has much to do with the brewing operation."
"Overall Impression: Theres a reason Sam Adams is a cornerstone of the craft beer market. This beer is well made, easy to drink, flavorful and enjoyable. No real flaws, but its a bit too carbonated for me, and while the flavor is straightforward, its somewhat bland. I was surprised to see I hadnt rated this classic before now. Its like the girl next door, you see her so often you dont notice how sweet she is because you see her all the time."
"Pours a nice deep gold with a big foamy head. Smell is malt and some nice citrusy hops. This is very tastey stuff very well balanced and nicely hopped. There's some sweetness at first which is perfectly balanced by the hops. Nice slightly bitter finish and a good medium mouthfeel. Very very drinkable. Good with food and very good commonly available beer."
"This is a very pleasant session beer that goes great with pizza or blackened chicken."
"Brewer and Patriot - Truth in Advertising."
"The smell is a combination of sweet, yet roasted malt, and bitter, but not floral hops. The taste is, well just as I remember it, even though its 8,000 miles away from where it was brewed. Upon entering your mouth, the back of your tongue senses the bitterness of some long-boiled hops, while the front of the tongue picks up a bit of malty sweetness. Somehow, my cheeks can taste this as well; Im just not sure how that works, biologically speaking. Mouthfeel is very nice, with a pretty good amount of carbonation, but not feeling soda-like. In summary, Im looking forward to getting Sam Adams back in the States for $6.50 a 6 pack. Here, in Australia, its AU$23 per 6. Thats about $18 per 6 in US dollars."
"the boston lager, despite the price, is easily the best american lager we can get in this country. you do pay thru the nose for it, fortunately its a beer worth handing over the hard earned for every once in a while."
"Overall this is a good beer that's very drinkable. Hats off to the Boston Beer Co. This is one of their best brews. I'd say check it out, but this beer is everywhere and you've already had it a million times, no doubt."
"This is a classic beer and a real pleasure to revisit from time to time."
"A enjoyable American micro-type lager."
"A very drinkable beer. Your average swill drinker might find this one to be too much taste, but I find it a pleasant change from a watered down lager."
"Mouthfeel: Creamy and smooth as it laps over you tongue and through youre mouth."
"Overall, this is a good fallback lager, and is enjoyable on its own merits."
"Dark yellow with a huge foamy head that stubbornly sticks around. Smell is mild malt, nothing else too exciting but nothing off. Taste is clean crispy lager with a tiny bit of hops. Mouthfeel is thin, but not too watery for the style. Drinkability is fine for this style. If this is offered, have one. Certainly better than the typical macro."
"Taste is ok a first (a bit sweet for a lager), but there is a slight mediciney astringent aftertaste. Plus this goes down watery in the last half. Not the best or worst lager i've had. Somewhere in the middle I suppose"
"As lagers go, this is a good one -- but lagers, for the most part, are just too one-dimensional to be very attractive."
"Pours a clear copper colour, with a thin white head and decent amount of lacing. A very pleasant aroma - sweet, floral, caramel and fruity. Taste was very nice - sweet, caramel and floral. Nice sweet malt balanced by a decent amount of hoppiness. Very bold and flavourful lager. Great session lager in my books."
"Mouthfeel is too thin for this type of beer. Needs more to back it up. Carbonation is particularly low, and it shows. However, it is full enough to drink a few of - if I could afford a six of this, I'd be content drinking it at a party or something. Overall, quite nice."
"Notes: This one will is and always will simply a great all around brew for any season. Still tastes as good as the first time I had it. A perfect fall back beer. Cheers!"
"This is my first Sam Adams beer and it was an overall good lager. I wouldnt drink this all the time but it is a good fall back beer."
"The beer arrived at the table a tad cold with little or no head. As I let it warm the aroma was hoppy with faint caramel malt. The taste was floral hops and some decent malt in the middle with a decent ""leafy"" finish. It was not a disappointment and I am willing to drink this stuff when there are no new taps to try or when there is nothing better available. Not a bad beer , I am just spoiled."
"Overall, a nice beer and a nice style."
"I would like to see this reviewed in a blind taste test. I think it gets downplayed because it's Sam Adams. This is a damn good Vienna lager. Recommended."
"Very drinkable and enjoyable. Enjoyed it alone for the purpose of the review and then paired it with some Hungarian Gulash. The bitterness and hop character of the beer were perfect in neutrlizing the spiciness of this dish and it made a great pairing."
"It ranks as one of my top five or so favorite lager style beers."
"From the tap at the ""Galley Yard"" (I think that was the name) in Boston, after visiting the USS Constitution. Amber in color with a thin creamy head and noticeable amounts of carbonation. Aroma was sweet, fairly fruity. mouthfeel was thin and fleeting. Taste was a bit fruity with some slight hoppiness. Fairly sweet and light. A good summer beer. Originally tried it out of a plastic cup (not my fault, all they had) so I tried it at home from a bottle with similar, but more favorable results."
"The taste is spicy for a lager. The body is full and filling with a nice carbonation. An attractive lager compared to all the rest."
"Pours a light amber with a light head that stuck around for most of my glass. Taste of sweet caramel malt, with a bite of hops that provided more bitterness than expected. Bitterness lasts through the finish. Really a very nice beer, easy for session drinking and versatile when paired with food. You really have to respect what Sam Adams has done for increasing beer awareness."
"Overall, this is one of my favorite ""swill beer bar"" brews. When in doubt, you can't go wrong with ""Sammy A.""."
"Beer is a copper/amber color. Nice head but quickly dissipated. Smell was neither inviting or repulsive and was fairly lacking. The taste however was different. Unlike most mass produced beer, could taste a small hint of hops which balanced well with the malt. Tasted crisp and clean on the mouth and was quite refreshing. A good, but not great beer and very drinkable. A nice backyard barbecue beer."
"While Samuel Adams Boston Lager is somewhat full in the mouth, this beer begs for repeated pours. Further, it can be drank anytime, summer or winter. I remember drinking a Sam Adams in early high school, and thinking it was the most bitter beer in the world, and I might not be able to finish a sip, much less an entire bottle. Ah how times change. Brewer, patriot, Samuel Adams. Cheers"
"Taste is also complicated- same soury citrusness, and some floralness going on. Tart, bitey. Mouthfeel is okay- a bit on the chewy side, and not too watery, with some bubbles bouncing around. But I kept getting a kind of... overdoneness sense at the end of a sip. Too much going on at once- I felt like I was drinking all kinds of beers at the same time. By no means a bad beer, but not my taste on the whole."
"The label claims that this is ""America's World-Class Beer", and if we limit ourselves to macros and mid-sized breweries, I'd probably argue that the beer lives up to the hype. It's easy for us to belittle a beer like Sam Adams, but this is probably the best beer available in many restaurants and grocery stores, and is an excellent intro to good beer for the unitiated. Now that my tastes have adapted a bit, I'll probably make this an always-have in my beer closet. Quite possibly my favorite of the Sam Adams line -- only the Cream Stout even competes."
"Notes: this beer is great at normal beer temperature, but it is also very refreshing at ice temp."
"Reminds me of Brooklyn Lager in some ways, but I prefer the Brooklyn version."
"Drinkability: An excellent beer that you can find anywhere. I would say, spend the extra money for this instead of getting a watery six pack of Bud or Miller. Keep up the good work Samuel Admas."
"Ut Vivat, Crescat, Floreat!"
"I just picked up a 6-pack of this at Kroger when I was grocery shopping, and I thought, what the heck, I'll try this. Everyone I know doesn't like Sam Adams, but they all drink cheap American beer-flavored seltzer water (I can't knock it if I ain't payin' for it though!!). Anyway, I opened the bottle and sniffed the beer. It has a sweet, flowery aroma and I then poured a little into a clear glass. It pours a reddish-amber type color with a brownish head that stayed there for a long while. I then tasted it. Wow, my relatives were wrong! I liked the mellow, sweet taste of Sam Adams. The taste was kinda nutty in the middle of the sip, and left a clean, crisp bite at the end of it, and the aftertaste was a little hoppy, then mellowed a bit. This beer is underrated, taking a backseat to the Big Three; however, I think I might get me another one or five... I'll definitely recommend this gem, and I will be buying this one again!!"
"Pours a light golden orange with a big white forthy head that sticks around all the way to the bottom of the glass. Nose is mainly of carmael malts, just a tiny hint of hops. Taste is pleasantly malty, gently hops finish, pretty well balanced. Medium bodied and a little creamy. This is a solid fallback beer than is becoming nearly as ubiquitous as the big 3."
"Well im not sure I can do this beer justice. It is a staple. Well...when I have money. It pours a nice orangey-amber with a nice creamy head. The smell is sweet and crazy floral hoppy. Anotherwords, it smells great. The taste includes a nice balance of hops and malts. Normally on tap tit has more of a nutty/wheaty taste to it but this time it was a blast of hops. Everyone knows about this beer, and it kicks ass. Note: do not be a dumbass and chug it then barf it into a flower pot."
"Drinkability: It is probably the best U.S. macro lager available on the market and it doesn't use adjunct! What a well-balanced and tasty lager. Some people might not like it, but it is one of my best reviewed products."
"overall, a very tasty brew, i am always happy to have one of these and almost always keep some on hand."
"Very good beer, probably my new official back-up beer, since you can find this beer at so many places."
"Drinkability: This is a quality beer. Although it is not a great beer, it is refreshing and great to drink while watching baseball during the dog days of summer."
"Drinkability: Wonderful session beer. Quenches thirst without being overly filling."
"Sam Adams really hit the spot when I was just sitting at the bar, waiting for friends. I could drink this as a session beer or a fall-back beer. I recommend it for anyone looking to get into craft beer, as well as anyone who wants to enjoy a nice, easy drinking lager."
"I enjoy this beer thoroughly. It is a regular choice of mine for meals of all types."
"A great session beer that is easy to find. My favorite for dinner parties. Goes well with just about any meal."
"Easy, tasty drinking but nothing too challenging for the senses."
"Light, candied sweet fleshy fruit (apricotish) aroma with a pinch of floral hops. Small cream colored head fades quickly to a think film, but leaves a good deal of lace. Not quite transparent copper colored beer with very little carbonation activity. Mildly sweet caramel/butterscotch and toasted malt flavor is enjoyable and balanced by some mildly bitter hops midway though. The bitterness drops back towards the end and the original flavors make a faint reappearance. Body is moderately light, and the mouthfeel is a bit fizzy in the middle, but generally soft. Most of the Boston Lagers I've had were not too bad, but a few, including this bottle, have been really good. It's more miss then hit, but sometimes it just hits the spot."
"Pours a bright bronze color with an average sized head. It smells of very sweet, carmelized malts. Maybe also a bit of hops as well. The taste is nice also. Very rich and malty with a wonderful smooth, clean finish. Great tasting beer. The mouthfeel is great, almost a perfect amount of carbonation in this one. The smoothness and great taste makes it a highly drinkable beer. If this was the only kind of beer left in the whole world, I'd be disappointed, but not sad by any means. Very good beer, especially for its common availability."
"This was my first real beer and my introduction into craft beer. I still like this beer and drink it everyonce in awhile. This is already a clasic beer. You can read my complete and detailed review of this beer at: http://pilgrims-pub.blogspot.com/2007/12/tasting-notes.html"
"Notes: When all they have is Coors, Bud Light and Sam, ALWAYS grab a Sam. In my opinion this is the best, most reliable beer in the US. Great job Jim!!!"
"Rarely does such a good beer shift so many units in this fine country America. Don't let its ubiquity scare you off."
"This is a nice session brew and one of my favorite Samuel Adams beers. Its better than I remember from maybe 2 years ago."
"After initial down pillow, a loose jail break of carbonation flies out to a trace/trance of frost hoar. Light orange to amber hue and crystalline to the point of a razors edge. Somewhat wishy-wash of malt on nose with just a scratch of hop and wafting honey. Slight buttery malt flavor hits right off the bat with an afterthought of grapefruit-like hop. This would be a good session libation."
"A very solid brew: its not overwhelmingly amazing but very, very good. A pleasantly malty brew that is balanced nicely by its mellow hop aroma and flavor. A very tasty brew that is not too much on the palate, and this combination makes it unusually drinkable. This would make a great beer to convert others to craft beer appreciation: it is widely available and is not too rich (which means those accustomed to flavorless macros wont be scared off by the taste of this one) and it is good enough to maybe, just maybe, open their eyes to a better world of beer. It may sound like Im getting a little carried away but I have used this particular beer to get a few of my friends turned on to craft beer! In any event, this is a slightly fantastic beer which I have returned to time and time again in the past, and will continue to do so in the future. Highly recommended."
"The mouthfeel had a lot more weight to it than I was expecting. Initially, I thought it was going to be harsh but it turned out to be smooth with just the right amount of carbonation. I didn't think it would be very drinkable but four more later, that also proved to be wrong. Overall, this was a beer I'm glad I didn't trust my initial reaction to."
"Definitely, one of the more flavorful lagers I have ever tasted. Although it may not be as easily drinkable as some beers, it holds its place as an ""Old Standby."""
"The beer poured a nice clear golden with a pretty white head. The aroma was basic: some malt overcome by hops. The taste was also pretty standard, but showed quality. It had a slight malt start and quickly moved to a hops finish that was not overpowering. The feel was nice and light and had a bit of effervesence. I bought this today by default. I had gone to a restaurant and this was the only reasonable choice. I was happy and now feel I will have a reasonable choice in these situations in the future. I was having fish and chips and it set well against them. The hops gave a nice clarifying bite."
"12 oz. with purchase before May '05 notched on the label. Pours into the imperial pint glass a copper color with an off-white 2 finger head that leaves lots of lacing and rings. The beer is low on aroma, but it smells of caramel malts and floral hops. The flavors are caramel with spicy/floral hops that leave a nice bitterness. There is a hint of fruitiness in the aftertaste. Feels smooth on the palate with a medium body. This makes a great session beer."
"12 oz brown bottle. Good through July 2005. One of my all time favorite beers. This beer has one of the best aromas out there. The floral hops aroma is perfectly balanced by the malt. Pours a light copper color with a light white head. Taste - Excellent balance between the bitter hops and sweet malt. A good, sturdy beer like our grandfathers enjoyed. It may not be America's best lager, but is probably America's best lager that is readily available. Cheers!"
"I was a little surprised how much I enjoyed this beer. It didn't make a huge impression on me years ago when I gave it a try, but it did this time. Sampled at a bar in the Pheonix airport."
"Notes: By far the classic American micro. The quality of the beer has remained unchanged, even through phenomenal growth and the blitz of marketing."
"A clean amber beer with orange highlights. Has a very small off white head, no lace. The aroma is very lightly sweet and has a hint of fruityness in the back. Very light mouthfeel, kind of watery. There is a hint of malt sweetness at the start of the flavor with a light hop bitterness just before the dry finish."
"Uncle Hamish says: ""Noine mare o' these and Oi' migh' actually feel ait!"""
"Many of us were introduced to better beer by Sam Adams. It is still a good brew to revisit, and often the only decent choice in my neighborhood. Boston Lager might not the best beer in America, but it is a good reliable session beer."
"Pours a clear amber color with a light white head. Many small bubbles are constantly making their way to the surface, lending to very good head retention. The smell is sweet with a nice hops bouquet. The taste is a good balance between malt and hops - neither one dominates the other. The finish is slightly bitter, a nice foil to the initial sweetness. There is also a hint of spice that adds some mystery to the experience. The overall taste is very crisp and refreshing. Although the taste is a little light, this really lends to the drinkability and is a nice change from the heavy beers I am used to."
"I aint a lager drinker really, this does its job though. an OK brew from samuel adams."
"Overall a good beer. Nothing special but it is found everywhere and can stand out at establishments with poor beer selections. Given its relatively cheap price and availability I would also have some in the fridge for routine consumption."
"This beer in my mind is the beer that set off the Microbrewing phenom. It has great taste, probably the best for a mass produced beer, and it is easily something that you can drink all night long. The flavor of a Sam Adams after a long day at work is always relaxing. I take my hat off to the Boston Beer Company for starting a wonderful movement in beer!"
"God Bless this beer! Truely a classic and a good friend! Pours a light amber color. Great head retention that sticks all over the glass. Spicy hops and carmel malt come out in the aroma. The taste is balanced. Enough sweet malts and hops to go around. I always enjoy this beer. You can never go wrong with it."
"Takes time to warm to if you've been drinking pale adjunct lagers, but one over that is eminently drinkable. Will make this my regular if stocks last :O"
"While not overly impressive, Sam Adam's Boston Lager is a solid choice for your widely available American beers. I won't go out of my way to find it, but as it is often a staple in bars and at parties due to it's affordability, it may surprise you in it's quality. Overall a very average beer, not too flavorful, but not offensive either. I think these qualities are what make it a staple social beer."
"Always a good decision? yes it is! I don't know why i didn't write a review for this earlier, but now i am. Sams is by far the best American beer. It has the perfect color for a lager, dark but not to dark. The taste is what a beer should taste like. It is also a good beer to ahve with, lets say a hamburg, steak, and/or a salad. You can also cook with it, pour it over your burgers on the grill and it will add real flavor. It never ever skunks up on you, so you can hold on it in the fridge for a while too."
"Orange/ copper pour with a nice white, moon-like crater head that laces down the sides of the glass. Slightly floral and hoppy with notes of caramel and citrus orange peel. The mouthfeel is consistant with the style. Tastes great just like the last one I had. I can always count on a Sam Adams lager."
"This beer pours a honey golden color and produces little head which leaves a ring about the glass. There are streams of bubbles rising from the bottom. Slightly sour malty smell is given off by the beer. Taste has a solid malt background and a sort of straw character to it. The Boston Lager is good sitting in the mouth and isn't as light as most lagers. I could definitely drink a couple of these....and I have too!"
"12 ounce bottle. Pours a very clear, light amber color with a half inch, white head. Sweet, malty aroma. Nice balance between the malt and hops, but not a whole lot of complexity to the flavor. Medium mouthfeel. Good drinkability, so it's not problem to drink several of these. A good simple beer that is the best available in many restaurants."
"Pours with a two-finger white head that fades slowly leaving a good lace. Clear amber color. Light-medium bodied. Slight hoppy nose. Light-medium carbonation. Starts with a mix of hops and sweetness, finish is hoppy, prickly but clean. 83¢ for a 12oz bottle from Market Basket Concord, NH."
"initially you should be able to taste the body and sweetness of the malt. This beer has real substance, it's not thin or watery. The sweet is followed up by some tartness, but has a very balanced flavor. The complexity is there but not too much a persone can taste the toffee, honey flavor, while moving into the citrus flavoring of the hops."
"Served on tap at Applebee's in Chino, CA. I've had this beer several times in the bottle but never on tap so I figured it's about time I review it. It was served in a tall pilsner glass with a nice, off white and creamy head on top of the golen hued beer. The aroma on this beer is nice and hoppy without being intimidating. The flavor is very good with an excellent balance of light malt flavor with floral hoppy flavor. The malt profile is not bready in nature, but more crisp and sweet. This is one of the better balanced beers out there. Very tasty with a soft, light to medium body. This is definately a great stand-by beer for places like Applebee's where they generally serve macro swill and don't tend to serve good beer."
"Nice clarity, a pale amber color with decent head. The aroma is nice, a hint of ""noble"" minty & woody hops along with a faint clear helping of malt and not much else. The flavor is good as well, not overpowering or awe-inspiring but solid from start to finish with a clean maltiness, a solid backbone of bitterness at the end, some more of that noble hop flavor (again, kind of wood-like to me, hints of cedar and spicy minty) and a little bit of caramel. Good mouthfeel. Samuel Adams is kind of maligned in that they aren't really a micro, but they make a solid product that is way better than BudMillerCoors and the ""imports"" like Heinekin. It was definitely the best choice I had at the convenience store this past holiday weekend (Christmas 2004) (although the Yuengling lager was my 2nd choice as I have never had it before, the green bottles just keep me away.)"
"Pours a medium amber with a good 2 finger head and good lace. Mildly smells of sweet malt with a faint hop aroma. Taste of immediate sweet malt that is quickly followed my the hop ""spicyness"". Not to overpowering - very well balanced. Crisp. I wouldn't call this a lawnmower beer but it is fairly flavprful for a ""average"" American lager and very drinkable. This is my standard when eating out because it usually goes well with all types of food."
"12oz single from my Holiday Sampler. Pours out with a body a perfect shade of amber similar to the Sam Light I had a few moments ago. The head is white, voluminous and robust. Im actually getting sheets of lace down the side of the glass and the head retention is pretty great as well. The nose is sweet toffee and biscuity malts with a faint sprinkling of earthy bitterness about the edges. As I swallow the first thing I notice is this is quiet a bit sweeter than I remember it being. Nice round toffee flavors up front accompanied by a mild fruitiness, the middle is grainy (in a good way) and is eventually accompanied by a well-balanced earthen bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel is light, but has quiet a bit more body than your typical Pale Lager. A great, well rounded beer, flavorful and with nice session appeal. I think I will find myself going to this one more often."
"Final thoughts: I seem to remember this beer as being more robust in flavor, and felt that this has been toned down (its probably been almost a year since I have had ANY Sam Adams products). A very good beer nonetheless. I forgot how mush I missed this, thanks to Scott, my college roomate who introduced me to this in the Fall of '95, and turned me on to better beer."
"Pours a very clear deep pale pumpkin orange color. Very carbonated for the style. Head is thick, white, and surprisingly long lasting. Clings to the side of the mug nicely. Taste is good. I can honestly say that this macro lager tastes better than some (repeat: SOME) of the craft lagers I've had. It shouldn't win any best of show awards either, but the fact that it is a decent beer in a market of fizzy yellow beers is something of merit. Quite sweet, hops are subtle, there are certainly no bold Czech hops here. Strawlike and sweet, then dry on the aftertaste. If forced to drink a macro as unfortunately some social situations demand, I will most likely ask for this."
"12 ouncer, with freshness indication on the label. Pours very clear, darker straw shade, clear, supports a snow white tiny bubble head, which exhibits respectable retention and leaves B+ lacing, fine ,segemented and dispersed. bready floral nose, this is crisp and snappy lager, widely available and a useful fallback brew at many ""bud-Miller-cooors light "" type establishments. finishes clean and drying, with a hint of spice. Nice"
"Notes: As many beer fans say, this isn't an interesting enough beer to drink if there's a choice of micros, but it's not bad and at many bars where it's the only ""choice", it can be quite a nice brew to have now and then."
"Out of all the beers that can be found in the average grocery store, this one is my favorite. It shouldn't even be compared to watery macrobrews like Budweiser and MGD- it's several steps above them with both the strength and the quality of it's flavor. The difference is clear as soon as the cap comes off the bottle. The drinker is greeted with a pleasant, malty aroma as soon as it's opened. The taste is smooth and a little sweet at first, followed by a hint of dry bitterness when swallowed. The body is very full and malty. It has alot of taste, but it's also very drinkable- a great stepping stone into the world of better beers."
"Pours out an orange color with very good clarity and a pretty decent off-white head. Retention is pretty good and the head leaves a little lacing down the side of the glass. Aroma is pleasantly fruity with hints of sweet malt as well. Taste is a nice balance between malty sweetness and a fairly decent helping of hops in the middle. Finishes a semi-dry with hop bitterness lingering. Very good overall. Mouthfeel is a tiny bit thin due to notable carbonation, but still very pleasant. Drinkability is probably the strongest suit for this offering: well balanced and flavorful without going overboard in any particular area. This is an excellent beer that opened my eyes to a wider world many years ago. Probably never going to make the top of the lists, but a solid beer for any occasion and worthy of a place in your refridgerator!"
"Presents just about everything I'd expect to see in a good solid lager. Hops are pronounced but well balanced and help promote the smooth mouthfeal. Perhaps not exceptional but I expect to see this in my fridge quite often."
"Mouthfeel is nice and easy to drink...a bit thin but that's to be expected. Drinkability is good here as this is a decent brew that is widely available and beats the hell out of the major macro choices."
"Pours medium golden, nice hue, looks a bit pissy though. Insane amount of carbonation with a huge foamy head, good retention. After being attacked by bubbles, the taste is dominated by bitter hops and a little bit of toasted notes. At the end, the bitterness lingers as does the carbonation. As with all the Sams I've had, a helluva decent beer for such a large brewery. But, I wouldn't get it again until I start to like this style."
"Pours a light golden color, which is very clear. Light shoots through the beer without any problem. A fairly thick rolling white head forms as the swirling carbonation rushes to the surface. A nice flowery aroma wafts up gently from the glass. A firm maltiness is shoulder to shoulder with the hops aroma. The hops embrace your tongue immediately, but quickly take a back seat to the semisweet maltiness. Now there's a slight caramel taste. This bit of sweetness fades into a nicely hopped finish, which is softly bitter. The aftertaste is refreshingly dry and on the bitter side. This is an easy drinking lager that will always have a special place in my heart. It's not the best beer out there, but like so many others, it was the first craft beer I ever drank regularly. For that, I'll always appreciate it and there will always be room for it in my fridge. It doesn't hurt that it's very tasty!"
"Boston Lager is a very nice brew and is definately one I will need to start having around again."
"Overall this is a pretty drinkable beer."
"This guy has a dark gold body, big head(well i poured it pretty damn hard, it had better), cream colored, lace follows it down to the bottom. Clean grain malt scent, light floral hops as well. Pretty much the same for the taste, grain malt up front with nice floral/bitter hop contrast. Full mouth. Pretty damn drinkable Id say."
"That said, I was a bit surprised at how... small this beer seems. I don't know if it's been dumbed-down over the years or I've just gotten used to bigger beers, but it's not the powerhouse I remember it being. It's still a good beer--great on tap, IMHO--and if nothing else, it did ween a lot of people, myself included, off the macro swill and onto bigger and much better things. That ought to count for something."
"Comments - This beer may have gone through some changes over the years, but in my opinion it is still a great brew. This beer is on my ""can-always-go-to"" list."
"The famous BBC's Boston Lager is truly a classic beer. I do remember it being a lot heartier in the old days, but maybe it is just my palate that has changed. Either way, I revisit it often and enjoy the beer immensely. It pours a nice amber color and has the trademark thick foamy head that you can float a bottle cap on. The aroma is a truly great mix of noble hops, Hallertau Mittelfruh and Tettnang Tettnanger, and wonderful sweet and malty. The flavor is every bit as good as the aroma and the floral hoppiness is in the forefront and the heavy sweet malty backbone melds the experience into a mind blowing taste nirvana... Ok, maybe that is going too far, but I love this beer and hold it dear to my heart, even though it has become a tad cliche. Once again I thank Jim Koch and the BBC."
"Clear golden brown body, light carbonation, and a decent white head. The smell is nice, crisp hops, mild roasted malt. Taste of medium roasted malt front. Mild hops finish. Caramel flavor transfer from beginning to middle. Drink ability is really smooth, overall balance is appealing and the mouth feel is smooth and a little oily."
"'The godfather' of american microbrews. I seem to enjoy this beer more each time I try it. I can't agree that I think the BBC are dumbing down there beers, because they all still taste great to me! Boston Lager is a nice reddish amber colour, with a pretty vigurous head that sticks around for quite a while. This smells wonderfully of malts and hops and tastes just like an American lager should taste. The hops and malts just blend in a perfect unison in this brew! The mouthfeel is medium bodied and just right and the drinkability is damn good as well."
"Its amazing that a beer this widespread and affordable is so full flavored and tastey. Excellent stuff, probably my favorite lager."
"Very drinkable beer that is found almost everywhere. I never pick it over any of the craft beers, but it will do versus the BudMillCoors menus of the world."
"Great bitter taste mixed with a sweet malt. Actually a pretty complex flaovor. Nice and full-bodied, refreshing in its fizziness and it goes down smooth."
"Pours easily, with a medium-weight tan-colored head that dissipates fast. Color similar to medium-strength iced tea. Not much aroma. Pleasant but weak flavor. I'd rank Samuel Adams Boston Lager just slightly above the middle of the Big Beer Bell Curve: A decent beer overall, but nothing special."
"Overall- a fine American beer what more can I say that hasn't already been said, plenty of hops, more complex than most others in it's class and it goes down well, perhaps a bit expensive but defintiely a good choice for any occasion."
"I have had this several times before, but simply never thought to rate it. It pours an orange amber like colour with a snow white head that quickly subsides into only a ring of lace. Laces the glass beautifully. The smell is bit too hoppy for me, as I do not care for the hoppy smell or taste. The taste is very nice. For what it is, anyway. It certainly isn't earth-shattering amazing, and it definately isn't anything close to awful. It's just good. A great beer to sit down with and drink four or five. Perhaps more. The taste has an ""allowable"" (to me) amount of hoppiness. Nice balance. There is a nice, almost dry, maltiness at the finish that I really enjoy. I would have to say this and the SA Light is to me what, dare I say, Bud and MGD are to most everyone else in the USA. Just a good beer to pound down either in a social setting, or to get totally loaded!"
"Excellent hop presence in both smell and taste. Well balanced. Great session beer. Always a good decision (sorry)."
"Pours a standard honey gold color. Smells a bit odd, like squash (!) or something. Taste is malty, a bit sweet, and for some reason a bit sour. Overall, this isn't the greatest brew. But, as it's a bit better than the average macro swill crap, it might be a good fallback brew..."
"Light, consumable, and can be found everywhere, but this is too boring of a lager to have more than one of IMO."
"I had this again 2.5 years later and it was drinkable lager, with some hop in aroma and in taste."
"Out of the bottle it's a decent amber color with a fluffy white head. Head stays for most the beer with a little lacing, but nothing special. Smells like your typical too malty lager. Very sweet smell. Altogether I didn't like the taste. When it hit my mouth it really tasted like it was stale. Finished not horribly with a nice hop taste but still stale and bland. I think it could be a lot fuller in the mouth. The thing that makes this beer better than most is it's very available, and compared to what else is available where Sam Adams usually is. So I gave it a 4 on drinkability based on it's the best beer readily available at most bars. A good one to fall back on."
"Final Thought: Read my review for the on-tap version; it tells the story..."
"Pours a nice head and lacing around glass. Amber color with little carbonation. This tastes fantastic from start to finish, though mouthfeel is far from sensational. Can count on a good Sam Adams here at most any restaurant around - - truly a better beer vs. most any other option outside of a brewpub or specialty place."
"-Oelergud"
"A pretty standard beer. Looks a bit reddish, amber, pretty dark for a lager, but still clear of course. No head on this one, no lacing. Smells of mellow maltiness, nothing too much sticks out as far as sent. Tastes pretty good, malty, a few hops in there somehwere, but a little watery perhaps, but tasty. Feels pretty smooth going down the hatch but there is a fair about of carbonation. A pretty solid beer, usually the best thing in crappy bars or other beer-lacking situations, but nothing special in my book. Their other beers tend to impress me more."
"This is an important beer in the history of American craft brewing because it helped many of us understand that there is more to life than Bud. This is a flavourful beer with a good hop profile and a dry finish. I can buy this almost anywhere and it is often on tap in the States where the next best offering is Miller . Respect is due for this beer as it is still very drinkable and fairly complex."
"Clear reddish copper color with little head (as served). Nice malty aroma, toasted and caramel, with a floral/earthy hop aroma. Nicely bitter flavor, with sweet malt balance, some hop flavor but not much and a touch of yeast. Good clean & dry finish. A good beer that that I can count on when Im in a craft beer oasis."
" the drinkability on this is probably not bad, I feel, an aquired taste,nice flavor overall, but I don't care for the dry hoppiness, maybe it'll take awhile, but not a bad beer!"
"Pours a lighter amber color with a thick white head that dies pretty quickly leaving sparse lacing. Aromas of grassy Hallertauer hops, bready malt and a light fruitiness. Astringent taste upfront, then moving caramelly malty and finishing dry with a bit of lingering husky maltiness. Rather thin tasting, but pretty good as a Plan B kind of beer in certain situations where lesser quality beer isn't available. I seem to recall this beer being a little heartier about 10 years ago, now it's kind of bland and adjuncted."
"Definitely worthy of drinking."
"Sampled many times both on tap & from a bottle. Pours a rich amber with a frothing off-white head that laced very nicely. Subdued aroma of toasty bread, doughy yeast, & mild spicy hops. In the mouth this initially hits with sweet malt and delicate cookie. Hints of toffee & moderate caramel linger and are complimented well by the tame, but spicy, peppery, & floral hop flavors. Actively carbonated and medium bodied. While this is not exactly my favorite style, this brew is well-crafted, consistent, and a fine example."
"Poured a light orange gold beer with a thick foamy white head that sticks around a while. Aroma is of toasty malts with a spicy noble hop accent. Flavor is reminiscent of Aromatic and Munich malts with a nice spicy hop finish. Mouthfeel has an average appeal as the carbonation lends a sharper flavor while maintaining a thick head. Overall this is a nice beer to have as it has a lot of flavor and a huge distribution means that you can get it almost anywhere."
"Drinkability  This is a good micro-macro beer."
"This beer is a staple on many accounts. It works well with many food pairings and can be a session beer for the night as well. Its availibility is plentiful around the Boston area. Many times this beer will compete with all of the major macros in bars and when thats the case, this is usually a solid choice. I have been drinking this beer for many years and I think that its not at the same level it was about 7 years ago, its still a good beer."
"The flavor is carbonated nicely with a sour apple and bitter hop taste. This is a good session beer whether on tap or from the bottle."
"Very drinkable. Next time, I'll buy a case."
"Mouthfeel is creamy, drinks well. Although not really exciting, this is still a pleasant drink."
"orange amber colored with a white head. the aroma is of light floral hops with a sweet malt background not very complex but certainly not bad at all. light hop flavor with some caramel malt sweetness. i've always noticed that this tastes more like a pale ale than a lager, maybe just me or something. light carbonation and a mediuum mouthfeel. this beer was meant to be highly drinkable and it delivers there. there's nothing to dislike about this beer it's very well rounded."
"This isn't my favorite SA beer, but as I've been drinking this well-nigh 15 years it still proves itself as a very good beer, beating most competitors, especially in comparitive pricing."
"I've occasionally kicked back with a 6er of this and enjoyed it and probably still could. Easy to drink and not hard on the head and pretty good to boot."
"Samuel Adams Lager lacks excitement, but it is a good beer that always delivers."
"Bottomline: this is the beer that got me to start liking beer. Perhaps I'm emotionally biased towards SA, but I really think its taste and balance are outstanding."
"When I first tried this beer, it introduced me to Micros and a whole other world of tastes to love beer for. It's still a good introduction to ""better than American lagers"". A good beverage when in the restaurant and all they have are lites and Bud."
"A soft fluffly head, with huge irregular bubbles. A nice although transparent copper color. The smell is nice, round dark malts and caramel with some hints of red fruits. The highlight of this beer. The taste is enjoyably malty, caramelized, almost chocolatywith some fruity flavors. The mouthfeel is decent for a lager, a bit creamy, not overly watery with a lasting hoppiness. Maybe not that drinkable, because of the citric grassy hoppiness. My first impression was definitely better than the one I have after finishing the glass."
"This brew is all about solid beer making, perfectly balanced without bells and whistles. Availability in even the most remote corners makes it a good fallback beer when you'd otherwise be staring at a night of Bud/Bud Light."
"Pours a slightly amber gold under a one finger off-white head that lingered well and produced some nice lace. The nose is a lovely combination of sweet malt and a crisp hoppy nose. Yeah, that's what Russian beers lack! The mouth is prickly, light and smooth. The taste presents a lovely chorus of malt and crisp hops, slightly sweet in the opening, solid flowery hop bitterness soon thereafter. Throughout, an excellent balance of sweet and bitter. The aftertaste lingers long with a hint of sweet amidst the bitterness. Oh, this is good. No wonder it revolutionized the American beer scene!"
"Have had this beer tons of times but this is the first review. This is definately a beer that I frequent when out to eat when the selection is slim pickings. There was virtually no head on this but the color was very nice. Nice crisp aroma. The taste to me just doesn't seem like a lager. Say what you will, but I honestly think this beer tastes similar to a pale ale, not a lager. Overall, this is a great mass-produced beer (one of the finest to be exact), and does the job when you find yourself in the midst of a macro swill swamp."
"nice beer to sit back and relax with at the end of the day. gives back without requiring too much from the drinker."
"Nice frothy 3/4"" white head with some staying power, which laced excellently. Copper hue to this brew. Aroma was kind of generic beer - light malts and hops aroma. Taste was as well somewhat generic, nothing bad, but nothing much stood out either. Mouthfeel was good, and drinkability was excellent, you could drink a bunch of it, but knocked down a bit because it may get somewhat monotonous. Sam Adams needs to add a little more excitement into this one..."
"Pleasant light amber appearance with a nice malt bouquet. Taste was malty but crisp. Light hop finish. Very easy on the drinkability scale...mouthfeel was medium, with a crisp finish. Could be a good summer session brew. Not a bog lager fan, but this one is worth a second (or third) bottle."
"For me this is just a solid all-around beer. No particular area stands out as the most noticible aspect of this beer, its just very good all the way through. This might be my new session beer, especially since it is priced right for the amount of quality it delivers."
"Now this is what a macro lager should be. Mass produced, but still a quality beer. This is a great session beer. One anybody can pound back while playing poker or pool. Anyways, Sam Adams poured a semigloss, almost dark orange. Wasn't really red, but it was nice. Head wasn't big, maybe 1/2 finger, but it stayed and it left alot of lace. Balanced smell leading towards sweet. Good dose of malt, bread, bit of hops to add a kick to the aroma. It was more of what I didn't smell that impressed me. No corn, no rice, no sugar. Ahh, what a taste. Light sweetness, with enough bittering hops to balance and let you know this is not an alcopop, this is a beer. Aftertaste is lightly sweeter, followed by a pleasant sourness. Excellent mouthfeel. It goes down easy, crisp and refreshing. Very drinkable, but with one flaw. Perhaps this only affects me this way, but for every Boston lager I drink, I let out one burp. I have to let it down a half point for that. Sorry."
"Beer Snobs, please set aside your elitism and look at this beer for what it is, despite its near ""macro"" status today."
"This is the perfect session brew. It has brought many people to the world of better beers, and I'm sure it will bring many more."
"Sam Adams Boston Lager is a classic, for good reason. Light copper appearance, hinting on red. One of the best American lagers I've tried. Starts off a bit sweet before a slightly spicy, hoppy kick and clean finish. Very drinkable and consistant. You can't really go wrong with this beer."
"This beer is extraordinary! Tastes great. Goes down smooth. An American classic. This is by far my favorite fallback beer. A bit pricey for a college kid as myself, but when I have a few extra bucks to spend, Sam Adams is always high my priority list."
"Pours a copper color clear liquid with a nice white foamy head. The head stayed for a long time, and the lacing on the glass was nice. The carbonation didn't seem quite right, as there seemed to be a lot of bubbles coming from the bottom of the glass. Smells a bit grainy, with a hint of an earthiness. Taste is sweet in the front, with a decent amount of hop bitterness, along with some astringency. Finish was quite dry, and slightly hoppy. Close to a medium body. This is a pretty decent beer. If all else fails, I turn to this beer. It has seemed to be consistant over the years. If there is not much of a selection, this could be a decent session beer."
"Very available and cheap, a great session beer"
"This is an old favorite, and a ""sure thing"". Pours a light golden amber with a sticky, frothy head that remains till the end. Aroma is very malty sweet with floral hops. Sweet hoppy flavor with hop oil. Ends somewhat dry and hoppy. A little bite to it. This is one of the best cases of a session beer. You can really never go wrong with it. Hopefully BBC won't screw with the recipe while they try to ""reach out"" to the unwashed masses."
"Poured into a glass, Boston Lager weaknesses become apparent. In such a serving it is an average beer at best. This seems to be a beer that is designed to be drunk from the bottle, which is fine in a club but not in a more relaxed setting."
"This is a very refreshing beer that I will buy again. I don't think it would be a good session beer, but it would go well with food."
"I have laughed about owner Jim Koch's huckersterism, stealing GABF medals, but he has kept his flagship brand pretty tight."
"This stuff isn't too bad, but it's not exactly a favorite either."
"For whatever odd reason, this beer always tastes like it has gone bad for me. I've been trying to acquire a taste for it because it is so readily available and people always seem to have it in their fridge, but I just cannot bring myself to really enjoy it. There's a slightly malty taste, but a more prevalent hops flavor that always comes off as tart to me. There's a slight head from the pour into the glass with hardly any lace."
"Poured from a twenty-two ouncer, this lager takes on a clear golden hue with some hints of red. Decent, white head and strong lacing.The smell is immediately floral with some nice caramel malt and a slight nod to the hop fiends. The taste is crisp and largely sweet with a dry hoppiness in the close, as well as a nice citrusy after-effect. Mouthfeel is good and chewy and makes for a nice meal-brew. Drinkability is fine, though I'm not sure how many I could deal with in one session. A fine brew quickly approaching classic status."
"A nice beer I hadn't thought about in a while, glad I did."
"The beer after disembarking from its 12 ounce brown bottle, takes up residence in my pint pounder, a transparent deep amber color with a bodacious creamy white head, the lace after desiccation of the head forms a tight girdle upon the glass. Nose is all sweet malt, fresh and pleasing to both the eye and the nose, start is thick with malt, sweet and the top middling in its feel to the palate. Finish has a brisk acidity, the hops pleasant and the aftertaste clean and wholesome, a quite nice beer actually, and one Im afraid I forget about in my quest for the Ultimate Beer experience."

"Sam Adams boston lager pours a dark brown with a frothy white head that just lasts and lasts. Lacing is superb as you drink from your glass. The smell is the downside of this beer, rather skunky but does have a very small hint of roasted malts. The taste however is a different story, taste is perfect mixture of malts and hops and a sweet and bitter ( good bitter) rear. Feels very dry but full and crisp in the mouth. My first experience with a Sam Adams was a good one, definetely a good beer for the summer ballgames coming up."
"I was surprised by the well balanced, drinkability of this one. It pours a clear, golden amber with a respectable, offwhite head that retains well before fading into patches and a few sheets of nice lace. Aroma is the low point, with a malty grain nose, and a hint of pine hops. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. There is a very pleasant feel of pine hops in the back of the mouth, toward the finish, that earns good marks here. Taste is well balanced, dominated by a caramel malt taste, some grain, a bit of pine cone, and even a hint of grapefruit. Supremely drinkable, with an enjoyable aftertaste of slightly bitter hops that even out the malt sweetness. Nicely crisp all the way through. A fine session lager."
"Sam Adams Boston Lager is very good beer and is my favorite lager so far. I love the fact that it's available locally and it's usually my 'go to' brew in local restaurants."
"Golden-amber color that is clear with good effervescence. Large, creamy, off-white head that is fairly lasting. Good lacing. Aroma is initially hoppy with a light herbal and slight evergreen scent. As it warms, aroma faintly smells like wheat bread. Initial flavor is a good mix of sweetness and bitterness. Longer than average finish that is slightly more bitter than sweet. Palate is medium body, semi-dry texture with lively carbonation and a light astringent finish."
"I tend to overlook this beer a lot, but it has many good qualities. The noble hop aroma is very nice. The malty body has some caramel sweetness in it and it finishes with a crisp bitterness. It is well balanced and it leaves you wanting more. After drinking one, it is like getting acquainted with an old friend."
"Might as well use my first review for the beer that introduced me to good beers. At one point in my beer drinking career this was the be all and end all of beer. I still appreciate its solid character and its omniprescense. The beer pours a solid orange with a cream head. There is a faint hop profile but I actually think of this beer as a malty lager. Drinkability is fairly good as one can down a few of these at any airport bar without tiring the palate. Though this introduced me to good beers, I am afraid Sam Adam's Boston Lager will always be my ""airport beer""."
"While this is one of my least favorite Sammy brews, I would still choose it over most average lagers. Splurge for the Boston Ale if you can..."
"It pours a light amber color almost orange with a medium white head that last for a long time and leaves intense lacing. It has a great hopy scent. On the tounge I detected hints of caramel and some citruss, as well as some sweet maltiness. It has a full bodied taste that engulfs your mouth. Very good lager; better than most."
"A great lager. Dark gold to amber color with medium cream head. One of the only american lagers I have smelled obvious hops on. Flavors of butterscotch, caramel malts with decent hop bite for a lager. Mouthfeel is good...not too heavy but not empty- what a lager should be. In this case, an american beer marketing slogan does not lie - this really is always a good decision."
"I enjoyed two of these in a restaurant with a seafood dinner. It complemented the food nicely. An excellent choice when everything else on the menu is a fizzy, yellow macro brew!"
"Light orangy-copper with a big creamy head that has good retention and lacing. Smell is big beautiful leafy hops - a bit spicy and a bit earthy. Diacetyl rounds out the aroma along with a slight sweet graininess too. Taste seems so simple, but so great. All of the flavors meld perfectly and the fresh hoppiness slowly fades for a wonderful finish that requires you to take another drink. Feel may be a little thin, and the carbonation could be smoother, but otherwise as close to perfect as a beer can be. An all-time great, this beer is truly world-class."
"Very enjoyable and drinkable. No amazing flavors but a nice blend of what's there."
"Thanks to this pleasant first experience, I'll be trying the Boston Beer Company's other offerings very soon..."
"The flavor is smooth malt with a slight hop bite. Very clean tasting beer that does not have a long lasting aftertaste. The noble hops are notable in the finish. High level of carbonation. Very well balanced beer."
"A viable alternative to macro lagers, as it is sold everywhere. Spicy hop aroma is distinct but not overpowering. Pale golden body is a bit thin, but mouthfeel improves substantially as the beer warms from the sub arctic temperature range. Aroma is faintly hoppy. This was my first entry many years ago into the wider world of beers beyond macro swill. It remains a solid lager, but has lost much of its exotic appeal. Something like this is what the major american beer companies should have been producing all along, but they sold out their conscience to the bottom line."
"This is a very good beer. Its appearance is an amber almost copperish color. The smell is not overpowering but you can detect a hint of caramel which is very detectable in the taste as well as a malty flavor. It has a bitter finish. I always seem to like this beer more with food. Its one of the best beers that is easily available to general US drinking population."
"It has a great, sharp scent which is accompanied by a slighlty hoppy bite in taste. There's also a noticeable amount of malty flavor. This is just a very reasonably priced, easy to find, good beer. What more needs to be said?"
"chesnut brown with a creamy white head, which does a good job of sticking to the glass. european noble hop aroma. full bodied for a lager, very smooth with a nice level of carbonation. toasted full grain flavor supremely balanced with a tobacco leaf, earthy hop bite. very well constructed. nice lingering earthy hop aftertaste, i have no problem putting down three or four of these in a row. without a doubt the most full bodied and flavorful mass produced american lager on the market, and is often an oasis in a desert of macro piss at establishments that do not take their beer seriously. how could you not like this stuff?"
"I sampled this beer fresh on tap at the Jamaica Plain Brewery. While its amber appearance and pleasant white lace are usually attractive, I'm never really impressed by the beer. This tasting was no different. The hops bouquet provides an interesting compliment to the flavors imparted by the lager yeast, but I continue to find the malt contributions to be rather bland. I tend to prefer the Mexican interpretations of the Amber Lager. The beer is quite drinkable, but rather unremarkable."
"Appearance: A nice-looking copper-golden color with a slight red glow, translucent with minimal carbonation and a slight head. Aroma: a pleasing, but simple armoa- nothing striking stands out. The taste is a nice, smooth floavor of malt, with a lesser (but nicely balanced) hops flavor towards the end. Alcohol is barely noticeable. A very drinkable beer."
"This is a good-looking beer. It pours an amber color with a light tan head that laces nicely. There is a caramel maltiness present in the nose, as well as slight citrus/floral notes from the hops. The taste is a bit biscuity with a slight malt sweetness which is balanced well with the bitterness from the hops. Higher hopped than most lagers, but not as tasty as their Boston Ale. This lager has more body than most with just the right amount of carbonation to make it refreshing to drink in the summertime."
"Overall: A great drinking expirieance one with smooth characters and a full body a stout strong beer with a backbone"
"Aroma is of light hops with some spice and light caramel malt. Taste is very complex and full bodied with a good hop bitterness throughout. Light malt flavors and slight citrus notes. A metallic character as well. Mouthfeel is good with a nice thickness for a lager but at the same time also very crisp and refreshing."
"The brew pours to a beautiful color of deep amber usually with a nice off white head. The smell is nice, a little light maybe but does have a malty smell to it. The taste is very nice, not overwhelming in any area but you can defiantly notice malt and then a slight hop bite that goes nice together, a perfect balance. Has perfect amount of carbonation and is just a very nice beer overall. This is a beer that can be had anytime of the year and will always be a old standby!"
"Pretty much a legend/classic in the craft brew world I suppose. Pours a light copper with a sticky white head. Smells of fruity malts with spicy, lemony hops. Taste is nice lightly toasted malt with a touch of sweetness. Lemony hops lead into a moderately bitter finish. More body than almost all other pale lagers (more hops too), but still smooth and very drinkable."
"Pours out amber with a vrey short quikly gone head. A so-so beer in my opinion. Meh. Drinkable, which is a plus in macro land, but nothing I'd ever buy for myself."
"A copper color that is not very indicative of a lager. Small white head. Not too much of a nose, faint hops, if anything. Full malty flavor, with a smooth finish. Another solid beer from Sam Adam's. A good lager, but not interesting enough to consider buying again."
"Medium-sized, cream-colored foamy head leaves thickish swoops of lacing above an orange/amber beer. Tangy, nutty nose. Malty, fresh front with some mild chocolate. Full, but light-tasting middle. Some chocolate malt. Toasty, roasty grains in the nicely bitter finish. This is just a tasty, fresh, light, amber lager."
"Too many seem to poo-poo this beer. With a nicely balanced, refreshing flavor, the overall effect determines the beer's exceptional drinkabilty. While perhaps not a standout in any one category, Sam is a fine standby, and a long-lived companion. There may be times when I'll daringly pick something else from an establishment's beer menu, but when I want to fall back to something I know I'll enjoy, I know I can never go wrong if I choose this beer."
"I don't know why, but this is the best bottle of Sam Adams Boston Lager that I've ever had. It's even better than the ones I've had on tap. I'll definitely have to get some more in the near future."
"I don't expect this beer to be this good when I order it in the future, but I will always remember this time I had it with fondness."
"Drinkability: There's been a few Sam Adams in my fridge for a long time. This is a really good beer that I don't have to make a special trip to get. Solid offering."
"Pours out clear orange-golden with a massive white head. Slight citrus hop aroma, along with a faint maltiness. Taste is a good mix of sweet malts and bitter hops, which seem to hit the taste buds all at once. There is a slight powdered sugar overtone here, sort of an artificial sweetness, yet it is not bad in any way. Mouthfeel is very slick and finishes slightly syrupy. For whatever reasons I find this not too drinkable - nothing i'd want to pound all night. A decent and fairly unique lager."
"Overall, this an excellent example of how an American-style lager should be done. This beer has an excellent reputation, and it's well deserved. It's a cornerstone beer, and it's one to introduce to your friends who are stuck in big-brand limbo. Sammy was one of the gateway beers for me, and I'll wager that it's introduced more than one beer drinker to a wider world of beer enjoyment."
"You can drink this stuff all night; it gets and stays smooth."
"The beer pours a dark golden color with a 1/4"" creamy white head. The aroma is clean with the scent of light malts. The taste is good. It's smooth and refreshing. It has a light caramel feel to it. The mouthfeel is fine. This is a low bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a great drinking beer. A good sessions ale."
"Delivered to me in a pint glass with some head. Was a nice reddish brown color. Smelled hoppy with a bread malt coming through. Some florals in the nose as well. Bitter hoppiness upfront, with a bready malt to balance. Grassy floral notes throughout. Medium body. Highly drinkable. This has been my session beer for quite sometime now. I love this beer."
"Definitely preferable on tap, my old standby never fails to disappoint. Amber pour leads to nutty malt aroma with a crisp hop presence. Taste is consistent with the smell, with a good hop/malt balance. Extremely drinkable and refreshing. goes well with a multitude of dishes - I love having one at Outback in a big frosty (that's right ya sissys, frosty) mug with a steak and cheese fries."
"This beer seems certainly seems more tame to me than it did when I first tried it. I remember it being the first beer with any significant hop profile that I had tried. Now, it seems so mild (but certainly better and more flavorful than the ""big three""). A well balanced lager (that seems more like an ale to me). Almost amber in color, crisp, with a dry finish. Nice with food, and occasionally it is a ""good decision!"""
"Drinkability: Good stuff."
"Just an average lager otherwise."
"This was the first good beer I ever had. It's still great as a session beer, and should be the best choice at any number of restaurants and bars. I don't get it as much as I used to - but these came in the winter pack. It's been passed by some of the beers BBC came up with later, and towers above some of the others."
"I have to render unto this beer its props for being, usually, the best choice you have available in most restaurant bars (although a fine Chicago pizza scarfin' establishment like Giordano's should know better than to use iced-over glasses). Has a nice dark gold color, darker than any megabrew, under the usual lager head. The malt is very evident, almost but not quite a caramel aspect, again better than megabrewed ""barley pop."" Hop flavor is nicely balanced, bitterness doesn't really assert itself until after you swallow. Many beer fans have kind of a love-hate relationship with Jim Koch, but this is still the beer that makes his rep."
"This beer is magnificent, the full flavors that don't overpower, the incredible balance. Highly underrated, probably due to it's availability and therefore loss of ""hipness"". This is one of the best beers in the world"
"As far as being a good beer, it certainly is. As far as being a good vienna lager, it isn't. Too fruity and too hoppy. I liked the beer, and probably will have one again when something more interesting is not available."
"Drinkability: Easy-drinking and a good transition from macros to micros. A solid brew."
"Still love this beer. It was my ""gateway"" beer to micros over 10 years ago. Probably still my favorite lager."
"The beer pours a nice amber color with a medium head. The aroma has some hops and fruitiness. The beer is medium bodied, very smooth, and nicely carbonated. The malt and bitterness are well balanced, and some fruit tones linger into the aftertaste. Extremely drinkable and satisfying. This usually ends up being my beer of choice when restaurants offer nothing beyond the usual macros and imports."
"Boston Beer Co is no longer a ""micro"". So what. This beer is definitely ""craft brewed"". How many times have you gone to a bar a restaurant and the only decent beer available was Sam Adams? I am thankful that it is around. This lager has a smooth profile and plenty of noble hops to wrap your toungue around. It's nicely balanced and consistenly good. Very drinkable."
"The aroma is hoppy, flowery, and spicy. The taste is hoppy and, to a lesser extent, malty. Boston lager tastes sweet at first, then finishes dry. And it leaves a dry aftertaste in the mouth, balanced equally between hops and malt. This beer's hoppy/malty characteristics make it an excellent beer to drink with many foods, particularly steak, beef stew, hamburger, or sausage. The taste of German hops are this beer's strongest asset. Caramel, spice, biscuits, and toasted malt flavors all contribute to the flavor and make this a beer to remember but the hops are what I remember more than anything when I sample this brew."
"(hey!, maybe that's the secret?) i don't know. it's just good!"
"Who hasn't had this beer? I think this is the staple for any beer drinker at any level. It is definately a good beer to have around at all times. It's wheaty, malty, and balances out with hops. I must say that this one is fairly reliable on taste. I really can't think of a skunky/watery/crappy Sammy A, that I have had. The color was arich amber with a creamy head that lasted a while. It's mouthfeel was ok, a bit bubbly, but then it went down so smooth. If you haven't had this one yet, then go get it now!"
"Nice malty aroma. Tatse is slightly sweet malts at the front followed by nice dry bitter hops that like to linger. Nice mouthfeel. A good drinkin' beer."
"very hoppy aroma, almost grassy...this has gotta be the only lager I've tried so far that has this much hop aroma and character. clean malty mouthfeel and taste followed by a spicey dry hoppy aftertaste that drys out the back of your throat. definetly a good session beer since it's available just about everywhere."
"Amber color, decent size head that stays around longer than I remember. Clean smooth malt with just enough hops to keep things interesting. Some spiciness and a good dose of carbonation make this one go down easy. One of the first micro brews I ever had and a good stand-by available at nearly every bar in the area."
"- Backdated tasting: I first reviewed this beer on 22AUG03, this post is based on notes from that review, and several tastings since. -"
"Pours an amberish color, nice strong fruit hop, aroma. The taste is full bold hop fruit and a sweet malt, there is a slightly sweet aftertaste. Nice lace on the glass. We should consider Mr. Koch and his beers a national treasure. A great quality beer like this, available almost everywhere. Many were the times I would have been stuck with macro pee water had it not been for SAB Lager also being there on tap."
"Amber/deep golden colour, good head. Smells and tastes like a cross-breed between an ale and a lager. Flowery perfumed aroma (not unpleasant), malty flavour (a tad too sweet), plenty of bitterness in the aftertaste - but COMPLEX is not the word I would use. Decent (and of course infinitely better than the BMC stuff), but I'm sure there are better American beers out there."
"Had this on tap at the local pub. Pours an amber color with a decent sized head and leaves a respectable amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma is not very strong, but malts and citrus are there. The flavor was mostly composed of the malt (caramel?) and hops. Very nice. The drinkability was very impressive - I could down these endlessly."
"Pours a nice light amber with a nice tight white head that lingers and laces well.. The smell is a bit of citrus hops with some nice malty backbone.. Its a bit odd the beer tastes maltier than i remember or that it maybe should. The hops definately come in at the finish to help quell the malt sweetness.. The overall mouthfeel is a bit heavy in my opinion. The drinkablity is good- would make for a good session beer albeit not a great one.. A good solid beer with no glaring weeknesses but nothing outstanding.. I always look at it as a safety beer when the choices are limited, as you always know its gonna be solid."
"Cheers"
"If you force me to drink lagers, I'll go with this one. It's everywhere, the quality is consistent, and it goes down easy. For a lot of beer drinkers this stuff is high falutin fancy beer."
"The second one I had seemed to go down smoother than the first, although it seemed less hoppy. This would go with a wide range of foods, from steaks, to turkey (or other poultry), and even Italian food. For a beer of such wide availability, this is an all-around good choice. It may be a simple lager, but it's done right."
"Pours out a nice copper to bronze hue, with a tall white head, wich does have some lace to it. Smells kinda sweet, malty with hops floating around as well. Tastes quite sweet, perhaps a little caramel in there, the hops are a bit subdued though, would like ot see more of them in here. A good macro beer, probably the best macro out there."
"On-Tap: Color is a amberish brown, almost dull copper-like, small whitish head thats loose with some retention and spotty and whispy thin strings of lace. Aroma is a dull toned breadish malt, lightly sweet of bagels and a touch of roastyness thats nice, hints of dried herbal hops as well. Taste has a very mellow easy malty roasty sweetness, kinda light breadish quality with a semi amount of dried herbal hops, almost spicy in some transitions of the crisp clean finish. Feel is lighter then medium, smooth and easy, nice touch of carbonation helps it a bit. A nice little lager. Been awhile since I had one of these, was a good choice to have with lunch over the usual macro."
"Big bready malt flavor, clean, with a subtle hoppy finish. Really would prefer this with more hops. Medium bodied crisp & clean. The old standby, when every other beer in the place isn't worth drinking."
"Light brown color, small white foamy head. Aroma is malty and sweet. .A nice malty and hoppy beer. Flavor is mild, full mouthfeel. Good balance. A simple beer, but well made. Nice beer. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is clean. Aftertaste is malty and slightly bitter."
"I keep coming back to this beer. I have tried dozens of pale ales, highly hopped like Hop Ottin, Flying Dog, etc. but Sam Adams beats them all. I know: it is commonly found everywhere, so how can it be exceptional? Don't beers have to be from microbreweries that are very hard to find and have to be ordered special from your local liquor store? Not for me. This beer has what I look for: drinkability. It goes well with food. The bouquet is very subtle. It doesn't overpower you with hops. It has a nice malty middle. A delicious but slightly bitter finish. Thumbs up, Sam!"
"It's been a while since I've had one, but the other day I was at an airport bar, and this was the best they had to offer, so I gave it another try. Still not impressed. Appearance was pretty good, with a healthy foamy off-white head that left a bit of lace. Light honey color. Aroma was light, a bit corny, not too much hops. Flavor was also pretty light, and unimpressive. Not much balance or character. Very faint light malt, teeny bit of hops, perhaps a bit of sweet corn and honey. Some cinnamon lingers, but a faint acrid note emerges in the finish."
"A nice mouthfeel with no excess flavours as one would desire see in a red lager. Nice buy."
"Notes: As so many before me have pointed out, a great ""fall-back"" beer. How many beer selling establishments would simply be intolerable without SA's Boston Lager? For what it's worth, I prefer this quite a bit to the Boston Ale."
"Basically it's just a great all around beer. No matter how much Sam Adams seems to sell out, the fact is... they continue to make an extremely drinkable flavorful beer. Easy drinking, malty, hoppy, you can't go wrong."
"This is one of the few american macro brews I like, and yet again it was from Samuel Adams."
"Drink up"
"Fairly pretty little color, and with a nice, lingering lace on the top. It's perhaps not exactly the smoothest Lager out there, but it's a fairly nice, thick brew. Taste is a bit unusual, and it's maybe a bit hoppier than I'd like, but that's a personal preferance thing. When you get down to it, it's a fairly solid beer, and if the opportunity came up, I think I could drink it again."
"Although a lot has probably been said about Sam Adams' Light and other mistakes, their flagship beer is still a great American beer. With this one available everywhere, this is a great back-up beer in places where other micros haven't yet penetrated."
"Probably what most people think a craft beer is. They're right for the most part. This beer is very well made and it does possess the adjunct like taste usually associated with macro beer. Deep amber in color with a little bit of lace. The hops in the aroma are apparent, but subtle. The taste is caramel and spicy hops. More sweet than dry."
"This brew pours a medium head of fine to medium sized white bubbles and a transparent amber colored body. The head lasted a long time. Its aroma was that of mild malts and hops. It had a bitter initial taste then finished more smoothly. It had a typical hop flavor."
"Sam Adams is a very respectable beer and one that I am glad to see people serve as an alternative to some of the other American macros. I believe it was the first ""good beer"" I had tried, and it did not disappoint me then as it does not now. The beer pours a clear deep red/light brown with a nice fluffy white head. The smell is of floral hops, a highly drinkable blend that Sam Adams is known for. The hops are present, not in the fashion of a pale ale, but moreso than in other lagers. There is a good malt base that gives this beer more prescence and a more fulfilling feel. Although I've branched out and found true happiness in the world of microbrews, I still enjoy a nice big steak with a tasty Sam Adams on occasion."
"The first American mircobrew I ever tried way back when (back when it was microbrewed as well). Pours out a good looking clear light amber, small foamy head, and some decent lacing. Nose consists mainly of floral hops, a bit of malt behind it. Flavour primarily spicy hops, some sweet malt to back it up. Creamy mouthfeel, but the whole deal seems to bite on the way down, doesn't sit well. Best before mark on the label says it's alright, yet I can't see this being a regular of mine, given the caustic side effects."
"Sam Adams Boston lager is a good beer that Bud and MGD drinkers usually appreciate, but don't buy because it is slightly more expensive. It's worth the extra cash as a regular session type beer. It has a nice deep amber color and pours with an attractive head that fades quickly and leaves a hint of lace on the glass. The aroma of the hops in this beer are good. You can taste the malt character, and the beer finishes very clean. This is a good beer to have around for your macro friends, because if they don't drink it all, you won't mind having it around. This was my first ""craft"" beer a decade ago, and I still like to have one every now and then. It does seem to get a little too sweet for my tastes now, though."
"Originally sampled on 7 January 2003. I am writing this review from my notes. This pours a clear amber color w/ a long lasting head. Very nice appearance. Good aroma. Very simple, typical lager flavor. I'm not big on lagers, but this one is palatable"
"The first of the ""American Micros"" I ever tasted. Back then, a revelation. Nice coppery color, good spice and hoppiness and still quite drinkable. While I certainly wouldn't turn one of these down, I won't go and search one out either..."
"One of the more well known ""micro brews"" Sam adams has gained alot of popularity. It isnt one of the best beers around, but it is still quite good. One of my favorite fallback beers, mainly because its available almost anywhere I go. The beer itself is very good, pours a nice copper color, with good carbonation and a thin white head, with a nice hop and spice smell. Hops and carmelized malts seem to be the most present flavors, with a hint of spicyness, and a very very small hint of fruit. The brew finishes very dry, and leaves you wanting more. Overall, for being so widely available, this beer is an excellent choice when the alternative is bud or coors. It is a mass produced beer that actually has flavor."
"The first real good beer I ever had. It is quite amazing how good an American macrobrewed lager really can be! A very smooth drink that goes down nicely. Nothing really stands out in this brew, maybe a little hoppy, but all in all a great beer that the people at Coors and Bud should try to emulate."
"This beer just struck me as being too bitter for my taste."
"I love that this beer has wiggled its way into being very well-accepted and commonly-carried. It makes the ideal beer for drinking when, frankly, there's nothing else worth drinking. It's a damn fine lager, dark amber but vibrant in appearance. Pleasantly pure grainy aromas with a sweet, malty flavor that finishes with a simple hop presence. Straightforward and to the point. And very easy going down. Doesn't get bad as it warms and can be a definite session beer if you need it."
"Overall great quality!"
"This Lage poured a medium white creamy head and it had good lacing on the sides of my glass. There was some carbonation observed rising to the top. This brew had a somewhat fruity aroma to it. It was bitter tasting and had an aftertaste that lingered."
"The taste here is also agreeable. I am a slow drinker, and this beer still sits before me after about an hour or so (please, no verbal attacs or terristic threats concerning my ""babysitting"" habbit) and the taste stays interesting and drinkable well into room tempature. I didn't expect it to. Decent beer, very available."
"This beer poured into the glass a light amber color that had red/orange highlights to it, it was very clear and well carbonated. The beer produced a decent head, white in color and semi lasting in nature. It was fluffy and sticky which was evident in the lace that it left behind. The aromas that came from the glass were of sweet malt, caramel, flowers, hops and a hint of citrus. The flavors were exactly the same, sweet malt, caramel, hops, citrus (light) and flowers. It left a semi hop finish that was light and semi dry. An all around smooth and quaffable beer, it is very easy to drink. A good staple to have around because of its balanced flavors, aromas and drink ability. A must for all those who want to step into the craft world."
"This beer poured an orange amber color and formed a nice foamy off white head that left latticed lace as it subsided. A small amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of malt and slight touch of hops is also present with some grain elements. A flavor of malt and caramel. The finish is light with a touch of tang to it. Lagers have ceased to be my beer of choice but in my old Bud days this beer easily would have replace it. Still would make a good session beer for drinking with friends still stuck on Bud or Rolling Rock."
"Sam Adams has a strong malt flavor with a light hop finish. Just enough carbonation to give it a fine mouthfeel, refreshing and crisp. Not the best beer in the world but very refreshing and satisfying."
"This is the beer that started it all for me some 15 or more years ago in Boston. Before Sam Adams I was not a beer drinker so I give credit to Jim Koch for introducing me to good beer. Although I no longer drink this one that often, I did have one with dinner the other night at a restaurant. On draught, clear light amber with very little head and only slight lacing. Decent hop presence for a lager but a little too watery which obscured the malt flavor I was looking for. I've been to the brewery in Jamaica Plain MA many times in the past, and I know what Boston Beer is capable of. I just think they've gotten too big to produce something better and more consistent."
"It's always a pleasure to enjoy a Sam Adams Boston Lager every now and then. It's always enough to please. It's most definitely one of the best fall-back brews out there. This is my choice when I'm at bars who have a shitty selection and think this lager is the best that they can supply. I love the darker appearance it has compared to any other beer you would drink at said bars. This is my sentimental value me talking now. But anyways, it has a wonderful balance, malty more in the start with a nice hop kick in the finish. And it's very refreshing and perfect for all night sessions. I have gone broke many a night spending 4 dollars a bottle on this stuff from 11pm-2am nonstop. But in all honesty, this beer was the very beginning of my crossover into ""craft beer world."" This started it all for me and I owe it hugely for that."
"This is often the only ""decent"" beer available at a lot of events and places and I don't mind having this as a choice. Beer probably gets bashed more than it should. It is a good reliable alternative."
"The beer pours a decent copper color, with a fair amount of head. I didn't try to float a bottlecap on it, however. Fairly decent maltiness and slight aroma of hops in the nose. Beer is well balanced to the taste. Some sweetness at the start, with a little bitterness at the end. I'd like to call Sam the ""Macro Micro"". Their beer is decent, available almost anywhere, and a great one to get people moving up the beer chain to better beers."
"NOTES i tatses this years ago and havent been bvack dont know why this is a great lager..well Im not the only one it got a Gold medal in England in 2002..says so under the cap..but pleeeze put Old Sam back on the label..pleeeeze"
"Clear, copper in color forming a beautiful sticky head atop small to medium-sized bubbles with excellent retention and lacing. Thick clusters of foam sit atop the head when it thins. Aroma is rich and satisfying with aroma of floral noble hops, pure water, roasted grains, and pale and amber malts. Fermentation is clean without much fruitiness aside from the hops. Carbonation is mild to moderate. Mouthfeel is excellent...soft, easy to drink, with a slightly dry finish making you want more. Taste begins with floral dry-hopped flavor with pleasant, balanced intensity...pale malts and what appears to be caramunich malts fill up the middle with a nice maltiness that balances out the excellent bittering hop finish. There is a very nice cookie-like sweetness towards the middle which nicely complements the bittering hops, reminding me of Rogue Dead Guy Ale. There is a subtle hint of chalk and husken grains towards the end with a smooth and soft mouthfeel. This is an excellent go-to beer that is reliable, easy to find, easy to drink, and has been a staple in my fridge for the last 10 years. BBC deserves applause for bringing better beers to the mass market, and this is an excellent transition brew for initiating your friends into the world of better beer."
"Poured from a 22oz. bomber, this one appears a copper amber hue with a frothing white head that looks amazing as the foam starts to settle out to form a trickled collar of lace around the edges of the glass. Aroma consists of a full malty almost bready aroma with a subtle hop aroma that diffuses very well into my senses. The hop aroma presents a slightly piney very aromatic aroma. Taste is predomanitely a buttery malt sweetness balanced by the bittering hops with a very solid all around good and refreshing flavor. Very smoothe mouthfeel that has a silky texture found in this medium to light bodied classic amber lager. I'm glad that Jim Koch found ol' gran dad's recipe, this beer has been the backbone of the Boston Beer Company. One great session beer that I am thankful for it's availability to have as a throwback beer in most cases. I can definitely enjoye this simple yet complex lager one right after another."
"This beer I tend to want to enjoy more slowly and get max flavor for my 12 ounce investment, the Boston Ale kind of invites you to guzzle a bit more. I suppose it depends on the setting as to which one I would prefer, but these days, with two kids and seldom an opportunity to sit down and enjoy a beer, the Lager gets the nod. All you young singles, or married folks without kids, take note - starting a family can wait, good beer has a limited shelf life. :-)"
"Color is a pale amber, and a thick white head tops it off. Aroma is fresh and clean, sweet and malty, with herbal hints. Malt texture is excellent. Hops are in short supply, but there are enough to provide a little play on the palate. This lager is really all about the malt, though and it's quite tasty, with a comfortable mouthfeel. Body is thoroughly on the thin side, and not 1/3 through the pint I'm feeling awfully bored. Not enough of what I like in a beer, but then I don't normally drink this style. Well-constructed, and worth it's popularity and prominence."
"Drinkability: An unwaveringly fine beer. Say what you will about the Boston Beer Company and Jim Koch, but many of us would not be here were it not for this beer. An excellent choice to introduce friends to the world of better beer."
"Pours a light amber, with a thin lacy head that will latch to the glass throughout. The smell of roasted malts and caramel is noticed right away. Initial taste of the same qualities, with just a touch of hops noticed on the palate. The strong roasted malt aftertaste is dominating. This is a great lager, and is widespread, a great beer to drink anytime, anywhere."
"Pours an Amber/ deep copper color with a thick off white head that thins out but does not disappear and sticks around till the last drop. Smells of malt and fruit come off the beer. Taste of malt and some fruit and hops. Mouthfeel is good, not a lot of carbonation and not thick slight crisp to this but just right. This has always been a good beer to fall back on when all else fails."
"This is Sam's signature beer and a very solid one at that. One of the most flavorful lagers on the market today. Nice amber color with a tint of red. Full bodied and loaded with fresh hops. Terrific fresh hop nose and one of the most enjoyable creamy lager heads on the planet. Many a blind taste testers might confuse this brew with an ale at first, but after sitting a while, the lager smoothness and balance emerge. Being a large craft brewer has not deminished the quality."
"This was a nice beer at a hotel bar when little else was available. It has a clear copper color with a head that is just a little off-white. The head was about 3/4 inch and lasted down the glass with strong lacing. The aroma was of malts and faint hops, with a slight sense of grass. The taste surprised me as it had real body that was full and robust. The hops taste was pleasant and left a nice bitterness in the aftertaste. Very pleasing overall and one I'll try from the bottle."
"Overall a decent lager but not what it use to be in the late 80's and early 90's. IMHO it seems to be less bold and assertive than it use to be. For me this is still a ""for when there is nothing else"" beer. I had it on Amtrak with a choise between Bud, Corona, Boston Lager, and Heineken."
"Drinkability is very good. It is a stand buy for when non BA drinkers come over for a brew."
"Overall, a good beer that fits just about any drinking occasion."
"This beer helped kickstart the microbrew revolution and with the wide availability now, I think this is close to not qualifying as a micro anymore."
"Good lager for the masses...decent for those that want more in a beer."
"I wonder if they have been fiddlin with the recipe?"
"Fine bubbles tumbling through a slightly opaque orange-gold body. Rich, dark oaky and hoppy aroma. Surprised at the fruitiness and creamy mouthfeel on a malty sweet palate. Lovely long lasting bitterness. I have just found my favorite lager. This is simply amazing."
"A decent lager, sweet Vienna style makes good company for pizza and other standard grub. Nothing special but a good fall back beer, at least for me. Have had on draft and of course bottled. Last place I had it on tap sucks and really diminishes any beer. Never order a beer in Chilis (Concord Ca.) They have no clue. I had this again recently and it went down well, I felt it deserved another review since I realize I had short changed it. One of my favorite beers of this style."
"Malty aroma with the hint of tea, which I assume is the hops character. Full tan head with dark gold liquid and good clarity. Interesting mix of malt and hops in taste, with some dryness. But overall very good blending and balancing. Very good mouthfeel, with a good sense of richness, but not excessive. The tea quality is too distracting for me, but otherwise a good beer."
"on draught, sam had a whole lot more hops than out of the bottle. it was an incredible difference. from start to finish, the hops dominated the flavor. it had a good balance of malts that would come and go as i drank it. smooth with a nice carbonation level, this one was a good choice out of the limited selection. it is definitely not an amazing beer, but it is a good solid drinker that you can never go wrong with."
"The beer is a nice copper color with very thin white foam. No lace on the glass. There was almost no aroma from this beer. The taste is pretty good, mainly dominated by hops (floral and aromatic). The mouthfeel is good, but not very full bodied. The finish is mostly hop bitterness. The drinkability is decent, but this is not one of my favorites. It does seem to taste better on-tap."
"Re-review 03/07/03: Although this bottles is no fresher (notched May 2003), it is much cleaner. There's definitely no ""background note of acetone"". It does have a slight hop flavor, but no more bitterness. Still, it remains very much the same."
"A beer that you won't have to worry about when ordering. Consistenly refreshing and flavorful."
"Cheers"
"Seems to have more of a hop presence than before, which is a good thing. A great beer indeed."
"a solid classic amongst micros. pours a medium amber colour. there is a nice malt/hop balance in the flavour here. nothing outstanding about the original SA, but well made all around, and it's available pretty much everywhere you go, so if friends drag you to a bar that serves mostly bud/coors/miller, etc, chances are you'll find SA there too, and it's always a safe, tasty choice."
"Golden amber hue with a fairly frothy off-white head. Head has some staying power and leaves a nice white lace. Smells well balanced but nothing extrodinary, slightly malty sweet and not too hoppy. Not bad...the flavor of the sweeter malts do dominate with a weak hoppy finish. Good introduction beer to wet someone's whistle to what lies beyond the world of the macros. Decent balance, medium carbontaion, medium body. Pretty good overall but not even close to what the true micros have to offer."
"It is easy to bash this beer. It's one of the original micro's, almost to the point of being an expensive macro. This is, however, a good well crafted American lager. The color, smell and thick head are excellent. Taste is of malt and prominant imported hops. Taste is heavy and sweet, almost overpowering in the later. The finish is clean and malty. This is a great beer. I don't drink it often because of it's heaviness, but this is a beer among beers!"
"I went to a steakhouse on Christmas Eve, and this was the best I could do. The last time I had this beer was at least 6-7 years ago, and I do not remember being impressed. But this is a good lager - I was pleasantly surprised. The color is not extraordinary, the smell is a balance of malt, hops, and lemon. The taste is more malt than hops in my book with some sweetness despite the citrus smells. There is a hoppy finish, with an aftertaste of something sweet that I could not place (caramel? molasses?). I am not the biggest fan of lagers, but this must be as good representation of the style as I have had. Obviously it is drinkable and the mouthfeel is good as well."
"Note:Tastes of honey noted recently.A long honey finish."
"pours out a clear, dark amber colour, with a big rocky head that sticks. a good bit of lace. a fine aroma of hops, spicy in nature with a nice malt background. tastes of light malts, contributing to a medium to light mouthfeel. the spicy hops add good deal of character to the overall flavour profile and add just a slight kick of bitterness in the back end. a nicely hopped lager that is tasty and quite drinkable."
"Pours with a large head that overfilled my pint glass. Amber in color which is pretty for a lager. Can't get much off the aroma. The taste is better than I remember. The hops flavor and slight bitterness are what make this beer for me. It makes it so much more interesting than other American lagers. It seems like I don't quite get the full hops flavor in many of these. The only reason I can think of is out of date beer. This one seems to have retained freshness. Leaves a nice ringing aftertaste of sweetness rather than the sour taste many lagers leave. Not a bad option when microbrews aren't around. Still their corporate ethics as of late have made me think twice before picking up a sixer."
"Extremely smooth, a near perfect mouthfeel. Malty and delicious. A true American standard."
"Pours to a light copper color with a white head that quickly dissipates. The aroma is of caramel malt, and spicey/floral hops. Again in the flavor I taste the caramel malts, but the malt flavor is balanced out by the slight hop bitterness. The hop flavor is in the background, but a slight floralness was tasted. It is a light-medium bodied beer, leaning more toward light. It is relatively clean, and finishes a bit sweet and smooth. Overall, a good, well balanced lager."
"My first review, but not my first ""good beer"". This brewski really hit the spot today! I keep licking my chops everytime I take a sip. Love the ""look"" and the smell is good. Lace a tad thin in my mug (considering the big head) but not objectionable. I will definately have this when it is ""on sale"" at the ole super market, my wallet (and my taste buds) are happy today!"
"I have had this beer many times but the time it tasted best was actually out of a keg using a pump tap at a rehersal dinner. I had had SA many times before this and can't figure out why it was so great this time. Maybe very fresh? Anyways, the smell blew me away as the hops were amazing. Balanced, smooth and very drinkable this is a beer that I fall back on many times."
"Its a classic and im proud to say thisone started it all for me. I love the appearance with its massive two-inch off-white head and top to bottom sticky lace. A good balance of slightly more hop bitterness while backed-up by a malty caramel sweetness. A great classic stand-by, of which I judge all others."
"One guy said this was ""The Godfather"" of the American Amber Lagers, and I totally agree. It poured a dark amber color with a white head that lasted about half way down. Taste was slightly bitter with a hint of sweet malts. Overall, very drinkable. Always a "" go to"" beer for me when I can't get to a decent liquor store."
"Pours a very clear golden amber color with a medium sized foamy white head. The aroma is sweet malts and grains with some floral notes. The taste is also sweet malts with a bit of spice and a pleasant hop bitterness. This was one of the first microbrews I ever triedI loved it then, and I still love it."
"A very good lager, somewhat darker than I anticipated as it was a very deep and rich amber. The head was nothing exceptional but it is the taste that gets you and holds you there. A burning sweetness is the only way to describe this expierience. Mouthfeel and drinkability are equal to the taste in this well rounded brew."
"Poured a clear amber with a nice foamy head about an inch thick. Aroma consisted primarily of hops. Taste is light bodied, but flavorful. Not much up front, but then a toasted flavor is introduced in the middle. Finish has a touch of bitterness and light caramel, followed by a pleasing return to a toasted hop finish. I tried this out of the Winter Classics sampler pack and I have to admit that this was one of the freshest tasting bottles of Sam Adams Boston Lager that I have ever had. Sam Adams was one of the first beers during the microbrew revolution in the mid 90's to get me to convert over to micros."
"This beer has become a standard in judging lagers for many people; I can see why. The appearance is relatively attractive: Color is an amber with very predominate colors of orange. Head poured is fluffy and it leaves a nice trail of lace down the glass. The bubbles of carbonation are tiny but produce a small head that lasts throughout the glass. Fragerance is balanced with a trace of hops. Flavor is good; its well balanced with mellow carmel-like malts with a nibble of hops that hits the tip of the drinkers tongue. Very pleasant brew to drink. Not my favorite, but a beer that I enjoy alot none the less."
"New label, but same good old taste, maybe even better this year than last."
"the beer that started it all for sam adams. this beer started a beer revolution. this is a dark beer in every respect, this is a true beer drinkers beer. sam adams boston lager is a good beer, but once you have tryed it you have to try the other variaties to truely enjoy all sam adams has to offer."
"While I had heard from many sources that this was a pretty excellent beer, I decided to see for myself if the buzz was truth or hype. The Boston Lager did not disappoint. Straight from a Sam Adams sampler case, the bottle poured a nice golden color with just the right amount of head and subsequent lace on the glass. An enticing malty scent greeted my nostrils, and the taste was everything I look for in a finely balanced, pure amber lager. A slight fizziness on the tongue was complemeted by a filling, creamy mouthfeel. This lager is very drinkable...luckily the sampler only had 6 in the case, or I'd be in trouble! Very enjoyable beer, and its reputation is well-deserved."
"Pours an amber hue with a thick white head, strong caramel maltiness with just the right amount of hop bitterness.  An old favorite of mine.  This was the first quality American beer I ever tried."
"A TRUE CLASSIC and good intro beer for BudMilCor drinkers.  As with most people, one of my first micros and led me down the beer-snob path."
"Great smell, great appearance, great taste...always a great choice."
"Clear copper-amber color topped off with a nice white head that stays just right and leaves a subtle lace. Nice floral hop aroma dominates the nose, backed by sweet and grainy malt. Hops and malt combine beautifully to create that classic unique Sam Adams flavor. Floral and slightly spicy hop character, a bit oily. Some would say metallic, but I would attribute this to the hops. Malt is again sweet and grainy, a great character. Exceptional balance and a great malt and hop pairing. Flavorful medium body that almost seems like a full body. Sweet and hoppy dry, crisp finish. This beer is a classic in so many ways. A crossover beer that converted many palates and created many beer advocates, as well as being a wonderful beer in itself and a great session brew. The world of micro/craft brewing owes a lot to this beer and this brewery. Appreciate it and enjoy it!"
"In the glass the beer is a light copper with a two finger off-white head that dissipates quickly.  The caramel maltiness of the past seems more restrained than what I recall.  Crisp hops are nicely balanced with the malt....but again, much less assertive than I remember with this beer.  It once had a signature hops bite that I really enjoyed, now just a shadow of its former self.  Still a decent brew but, imho, it is now being dumbed down for the masses."
"Was at a social event where this was the best choice of beer, Could not drink it from a glass, forced to drink it from the bottle. Peeking into the top of the bottle, it appeared to be golden. It tasted all right, I could make out the hops and the malts. Not bad for what I consider a semi-macro."
"Sam Adams hasn't been a ""micro"" for quite a few years, but they still produce a quality craft brewed product at a very reasonable price."
"Several years ago I had to resort to drinking this beer on tap in Chicago. It was gorgeous, so different from the version that we got in Detroit. I have to believe they were from different brewerys under contract to BBC. Now, after years, I open another Detroit sample. It looks great, with reddish gold color and a neat, concise head of off-white, tiny bubbles. Then there's the smell. Other than the dominating notes of brushed metal, it seems like there's quality here. I just have a problem with strong metallic notes in my beer. It appears on the palate as well, where otherwise creamy, fizzy flavors of buttered toast and clean, soft hops appear. I'm willing to bet that I could get used to the metal after a few of these."
"Pours a clear light copper color with a nice creamy head that laces the glass very well.  Nice caramel malt flavors are definitely present along with a fairly aggresive hoppiness as compared to the other beers I have tried in the style.  Smooth and not overly sweet caramel malt opens up the brew.  The malt holds up and supports the brew as the tangy hoppiness takes over at the end to provide a nice crisp finish.  Very full flavored, this medium bodied brew is creamy and nicely crisp with the hop twang at the end.  This beer has always served me well as a fall back brew and goes especially nice in the summertime."
"Pours with a good off white head that has staying power, settling over gorgeous clear deep golden liquid. Nose smells of light flowery hops with some malt backbone. Taste is fresh, slightly fruity, notes of subdued flowery hops & slightly biscuity malt. Finishes smooth and mellow, with nice hop and malt interplay on the palate...invites another swallow. A great session beer...although it seems to me that when this beer was first rolled out on a wider scale back in the mid-80's, it had a bit more balls in the hop dept. It seems the recipe has been ""tweaked""since then. Or maybe since it's made in a few different locations the final product varies slightly, I dunno. Still a damm good lager!"
"A good lager that you can always rely on. Gotta hate the new ""head-less"" labels though."
"Really bright mouthfeel and smooth clear finish. One of my all time favorites."
"Wow.  Anyone who says that American's can't make good beer have obviously never tried this.  There may be better American beers on the market, but none that are as widely avalibale this.  You can find it everywhere and it tastes great.  The hops are bold and crisp, but the finish is smooth.  Its not a chore to drink.  I love it and will continue to drink it, regardless of what is said about the management.  Cut the BBC a break.  They make a classic brew."
"Nice color and good 1/4 inch head.  Aroma is pleasant but could be a touch more pronounced.  Just excellent balance, creamy caramel malts, and a nice amount of sassy hot cinnamon hop.  In many ways, more Pale Ale-like than the Sam Pale Ale.  Medium mouthfeel, very refreshing.  History aside, and it shouldn't be -- this is a fine brew and an early ""ambassador"" for beerdom in North America.."
"I am like many others as this was one of my first forays into the microbrew world.  I have revisited it since it was my only choice of good beer in a small town.  I was not disappointed.  The amber hue and thick white head, although short-lived, were pleasing to the eye.  The smell was of hops that had overwhelmed its malty companion.  The taste went to the malt, however the hops were making a comeback at the end of the flavor.  The beer was smooth, yet popped on my tongue with carbonation and this is one of those full-flavored beers that can be consumed en-masse.  Excellent."
"The new labels on the bottle proclaim that Sam Adams ""has led a return to flavorful American beer.""  They're right, and beer aficionados everywhere have a reason to be grateful."
"Pours a nice amber color and has a beatiful long lasting head that leaves nice lace througout. Fresh hop nose accompanied by a gentle, but assertive, malt taste.Smooth and very easy to drink with a nice amount of bitterness. One of the best lagers that is mass produced in America."
"This beer pours a nice amber color with a fairly sizeable off-white head that sticks around. Tastes a bit sweet and fruity with a lingering hop mouthfeel. This one is very smooth and easy to drink. Certainly a classic American lager with which I can't really find any faults. Cheers to the Boston Beer Company for the widespread distribution of this quality product."
"The ultimate cross-over lager to bigger and better beers.  Still, it was the first ""national"" beer I can remember that decided that a brisk hop aroma was not a bad thing as the macro brewers had seemingly ordained.  Amber color with long-lasting medium head.  Dominant noble hop aroma over caramel maltiness-very nice.  Taste is malty sweetness followed by sharp and crisp hop bitterness.  The body varies somewhat between light to medium-perhaps based on the brewery from which it was contracted? A very drinkable American beer that is a great fallback when more unique beers cannot be found."
"I really enjoy Sam Adams, as it is a very easy to find, and very well made beer.  It's definately not your average lager."
"Clear, bronze-gold hue; fluffy, thick, white head, excellent retention chunky rings of lace are produced. The nose is mild with light caramel, grain, and hops simplistic and clean yet inviting. Tasty, straightforward palate the hops are the most noticeable aspect of this beer; the malt (with caramel hints) adds tremendous balance. Very drinkable enjoyable to quaff. Medium body. Ideal carbonation. The finish is short and clean with hops drying the mouth aftertaste is largely nil (only faint caramel). Sam Adams' Boston Lager might be the best easy-to-find beer on the market. This is a true classic and a must try for any beer drinker. We would be at a loss without this beer."
"This beer makes a great session beer.  Pours a beautiful amber-red color.  Balanced flavor of malt and hops with a medium mouthfeel.  It's also excellent on draught as well. This is one of the best lagers I've had imho. Easy to drink, and easy to appreciate."
"Re-review Thick white creamy head that stayed pretty decently and clings well, medium amber color with conservative carbonation. Minimal aroma, husky malt nose. German noble hops round out a husky but not offensive maltiness, hop bite at end is relatively neutral in flavor. Starts fairly smoothe but finishes with a bit of bite on the back sides of the tongue. This beer takes some hits but is a pretty flavorful lager (as lagers go)."
"A great beer. Dark amber with nice head, and lace.  Lace quickly dissapears though.  Deep and rich tasting with carmel like sweetness and nicely bitter hop floral flavor. Finishes somewhat sweet with lovely bitter bite. A great session beer. My current favorite"
"Very distinct flavor but my least favorite of the Sammy's line, as I much prefer their seasonal fare. Nothing to really complain about though, as it is an above-average lager."
"As common as Sam is throughout New England, I never get it draught.  I guess I just have so often otherwise.  But Man, Sam gets even better after a nice pull!  Its head ends up super creamy and sticky and keeps a full, thick cover straight through to the ends.  I got a healthy serving of tastey foam off the bottom.  A fantastic deep and rich balance of hop spike and rounding malts on the back of a silky smooth, medium body.  Perfect anytime.  Sam and Jim Koch and a great asset for all of beer.  Cheers to Sam and Jim!"
"A solid beer from BBC.  Amber body, with a thin, lacy head.  Malty caramel aroma, with some mellow hops adding a bit of spice.  Flavor is also malty.  Caramel and a biscuity flavor combine with a mild citrus hops taste for a very refreshing and drinkable beer.  Smooth, almost dry finish.  A bit too carbonated for my liking - made it a bit acidic on the tongue.  Overall, a good brew to kick back with among friends."
"Really, a decent beer.  The color is nice and copper and the head is apparent, but not annoying.  However, the tast was a little less than I expected.  I am really not catching anything out of the ordinary in here.  There is little if any hops in there, and it is not very alluring.  All in all, a very drinkable lager that is really not this sommelier's choice, but very do-able."
"Dark amber color with good head retention, malty nose, rich malty taste with hops in the back, finish was smooth with a few hops thrown in.  I agree with the others guys, this brew is the American standard micro lager.  Good bye Bud, hello Sam!  By the way I enjoyed this in a 24oz bottle which is new to Nashville."
"I gave this beer the top rating because it is by far my favorite all around beer. Tour the brewery once and you will realize how much time and dedication Jim Koch put's into his beer. I am sure most have had this so I wll save the description but I could drink this for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Stunning!"
"Nice looking beer showing off it's pale amber color and pouring a nice lumpy head.  The smell is fairly inviting, but actually a sleeper as it doesn't tell you what your about to drink.  For a common beer, the flavor is quite nice.  Has a nice hop bitterness that increases at the end.  The flavor is balanced quite nicely and leaves you wanting another.  Definitely a good all round beer.  Nothing too fancy, but usually found everywhere.  Ole' Reliable Cheers!"
"When you're out on the town and stuck for something decent to drink, you can almost always fall back on Boston Lager.  It's got a decent hop kick and more malt flavor than all the US macros.  I find it to be a bit cloying after a while, but not overwhelmingly so.  This is probably the biggest transition beer out there for people moving away from Bud/Miller/Coors and into something better."
"Deep gold. Medium light body. Mild bitterness. Medium hops. Mild malt. Dry fruity citrus flavors. Silky smooth texture and a rich finish."
"The Classic American, that has earned its respect."
"Another sentimental favorite for me. This is the first real beer I drank regulary before exploring everything. I think it is a great beer to introduce friends to the beer world. Nice copper color, fluffy head. Smell is just enough to remind you it's really a beer. Decent hops flavor to start and malty texture. Nice easy finish. I will always order this at restaurants when the only other choices are Bud and Miller, etc. Cheers to the Boston Beer Co. for making a good beer easy to get."
"Try this beer with full-bodied, spicey or acidic foods.  A big bowl of chili will do it for you, tomato-based Italian dishes or chicken marsala would all be quite good with this. The hops and the super-dry finish will help cut the fat of greasy food, so it's a natural  for 95% of all pub-grub."
"Crystal clear light amber with mild carbonation evident.  Really nice spicy hop tones with what seems like a deep bavarian malt aroma too.   A generous white puffy head that has great retention.  Really nice malt tones on the palate.  Good hop spiciness too (I'm guessing noble hops).  Has a firm body.  Goes down easy.  Great session brew."
"It has the hoppiness, bitterness and malt character that no other widely distributed and marketed beer in the US has. I can count on it being in most every decent bar and restaurant when I need a beer with real flavor. Because I have had to default to it so many times I have pretty much burned out on it. There are better beers to be had out there, but SABL is unique and reliable. As for taking it home, it is a bit pricey at the liquor store. there are better micros available for a lower price."
"Very pale golden color.  rich white head.  Bright fresh malt nose with a distinct hop presence.  Smooth mouth with malty flavor.  The finish leaves your mouth with excellent hop balence.  Much more complex that the average Lager.  It is great to taste a lager with real flavor.. this is a rare quality in an american lager."
"Should be called Old-Reliable.  You know exactly what you're getting with this beer.  A well-made and ubiquitous alternative to tasteless American-style pilsners, Sam Adams Boston Lager is nothing to shout about, but it is (thankfully) a solidly good beer.  It seems to be available everywhere now, and from bouquet to finish, this is a pleasant and enjoyable drink."
"This should be the base-line for lagers. It's a meal, a bit sweet, nice color and smell. Probably the first beer I enjoyed. Years ago. And an old favority with Daggs in MN over darts."
"The dense white head covers a bronze brew that displays excellent well - lagered clarity. The attractive foam lace left adds additional visual appeal.  There's a very strong floral Hallertauer Mittelfruh hop nose and the malt aroma is secondary, but mildly toasty Vienna and /or Munich malt notes provide for aromatic experience.  The mouthfeel oddly seems a bit oily.  The hop bitterness is mild, and the crystal malt sweetness is fairly high and the beer is thus on the sweet side. The pronounced, enjoyable and quinessentially floral and refined Mittelfruh hop flavor is very welcome.  The finish is slightly sugary, but with bready malt notes as well.  This is the best mass produced lager in America.  My only qualms are the lack of hop bitterness / malt sweetness balance and the ""oily"" mouthfeel."
"Makes a nice session, and come through in a pinch when nothing else is available."
"An excellent beer. Full flavored, refreshing and heads and shoulders tastier than most macros.  A bit pricey in my area $12.99-14.49 a twelve).  When fresh, this beer is excellent.  The hop taste on the finish gets you like a fish taking a hook.  Very enjoyable."
"This is good for a lager, the problem is that I don't really care too much for lager. And I hate trying to sound intelligent in my comments on these kinds of beers. It smells like a beer, tastes like a beer and looks like a beer. The only difference is that this tastes like a good beer instead of a bad beer. There's just no complexities that make this beer different enough from your typical lager taste to really talk about. It does have a darker color than most of the American lagers, so that's nice. For readily available American Beers, it's hard to beat."
"Best every day beer, best introduction to finer beer, best widely available lager, and goes great with a range of great food. I always have a twelve of Sam products on board, and so should you."
"Update 1/03: I hate to say it but this beer has definitely changed. Dumbed down, less hoppy, not nearly as clean tasting. Still some caramel goodness but mostly bland. I don't know if it's bottles produced at a certain plant or if every SA Boston Lager is as weak as the one I'm drinking, but I've noticed a consistent deterioration for quite some time now. Had a keg on Memorial Day last year; that's the last time I remember the beer being as pleasurable as it was when I first started drinking it. It's a real shame and I hate to be fickle, but I'm finished with this beer, a disappointing shadow of its former self."
"I was reminded how bad the state of beer in America is with a visit to the local chain restaurant. They even have the nerve to recommend Bud Light with the chicken wings. Yeah, just in case you get a bone stuck in your throat, have some water to wash it down. A big, hearty thanks to Boston Beer Co. for giving us BEER drinkers a choice."
"nice balance of hops and malt,I believe the best readily availabale lager u can get,great with all foods."
"I've always found this beer fascinating because it seems to me to have a strong ale character, body-wise and in its use of hops.  Is this what early lagers were like?  A great beer to have out there in the market - you can find it at most outlets and social events, and it keeps you from having to drink the other crap they happen to have on hand."
"Great beer, malty kind of flavour, with a very ale-like quality, i'd happily sit down with a sixer of these and its not too expensive either."
"If I'm not drinking Yuengling and I have a 6 or 7 bucks extra to spend on a case, I usually pick the Boston Lager.Copper/almost amber color to the body w/ a avg. head at the pour. A nice hop presence is there, but it doesn't overshadow the lovely toasted flavor of the malt, which had a small hint of sweetness & bitterness to the finish.Overall a fine session brew."
"8"
"I think this is vastly underrated. There are few lagers that can compare."
"When is doubt, drink this.  It has become a staple here in the Northeast, that you can always fall back on it.   I try to only order this on tap; great balance of hops and malt with enough flavor to drink alone or with food."
"Sweet n' Malty.  Very slight hops presense here to keep the malt in check.  Sweet caramel on the nose.  Available everywhere, an enjoyable brew."
"Light golden color, strong white head and lace until the end.  Clean maltiness nose with just the right amount of hops.  Slightly sweet, malty, nicely hopped flavor with a somewhat dry finish.  Medium body and rich, creamy mouthfeel.  Medium carbonation.  A very good tasting and refreshing  Classic American Pilsner.  Prosit."
"The new Classic.  Availability is probably its greatest attribute.  You can be at a mom-and-pop restaurant in the middle of nowhere and cahnces are they'll have a Sam for you."
"One of the best American made lagers. A good fallback when choices are limited."
"Notes: A very well crafted brew, enough hops to go around yet still very balanced. Soon to be a classic (first brewed in 1984), an excellent fall back or session beer also."
"Not bad.  Not nearly as good as their seasonal beers, but better than most American (non-microbrew) beer."
"Solid and widely available."
