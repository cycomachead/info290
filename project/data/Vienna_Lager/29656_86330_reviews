"Poured into a pint as a cloudy deep amber, with a thin finger of creamy head. Smells light and toasted. Tastes toasted and light. Caramel. Malts. Fairly smooth, but lacking distinct flavor and any memorable characteristics. Mineral. Ends a bit dry."

"Clear dark amber pour with a dense off-white one-finger head. Somewhat sweet aroma of caramel and toasted malt. Medium bodied with a creamy mouthfeel. There's a bit of grassy hops in the initial taste balanced with bread, caramel and grain malt flavors. Finishes dry with a mild lingering grassy bitterness."

"Adequate, but not the best beer from their lineup."

"Overall: Simply, WOW. I've never had a beer like this, and I want more and more. It's a terribly wonderful complex mix of flavors I've not had elsewhere. Though it's only got 25 IBU, I think the Noble hops here shine enough to keep the tartness noticeable and a wonderful counterpoint to the sweet caramel, but then there's a roasted, bbq-ed something in there that is lovely and hits the nerve endings that crave salt and umami. The mouthfeel is also a lovely contradiction of sensations: thick creamy loveliness with crisp dry tartness. The mouth can concentrate on one flavor, one mouthfeel, and then the other, then the next, and keep going back and forth into a focused point where they all become one unique flavor. This is a really unique, WOW beer. I haven't ever had anything like this and I absolutely love this beer. And it certainly feels like a beer that's got a lot more alcohol than it says on the label, by which I mean it feels like a Doppelbock or 6% Märzen. It veers into Märzen beer territory, then becomes a liquid bbq, then a Pils in it's tartness, and then back, and then whisky notes. Again, WOWOW beer, and a 4.8 of 5. I certainly didn't expect this beer to knock my beer-wow-meter off kilter, and I'm so happy it did."

"O: quite disappointing ... a well-made lager is generally crystal clear, whereas this thing is muck; it's possibly quite old, but with no dating on the bottle, how could you know? just a sweet muddled mess. i definitely won't try this one again unless I know it's fresh."

"Summary - Not bad. I had this with pork tacos. It went well with the meat, but once I hit a spicy pocket, the beer clashed with it. I'd recommend this with a burger or pizza - something not spicy."

"Still, this does seem like a respectable effort from this newer Texas brewery and it does have enough going for it to recommend. I plan to offer some bottles to friends tomorrow, just to see what they think. It isn’t outstanding, but I predict most everyone who tries it will find it worthy of a second bottle."

"On tap at Garland mall. Pours dark amber with long lasting, fluffy white head. Aroma is of caramel malt and hops. Body is medium and crisp. Taste is of grapefruity hops and caramel malt. Finish is long, citrusy. I would prefer noble hops in this brew."

"A good lager for the most part. Not among the better lagers available from Texas breweries, but still very enjoyable. One of my favorite styles, and I am glad to grab a sixer."

"Light-medium bodied crisp beer. I guess this a good replacement for BMC if you live in Dallas. I would drink pretty much every other beer Lakewood makes over this though."

"Taste has alot of the toast but it is balanced by a sweet doughy caramel. Hops are still pretty non-existent but there is a light drying bitterness on the finish, a little leafy even. Its a fairly good lager, one I would be happy to order on tap at a restaurant, but it really doesnt do a whole lot to distinguish itself from the pack of vienna lagers. If I had the choice Id rather grab a Penn pilsner, Firebrick or Elliot Ness."

"The beer pours an orange-copper color with a white head. The aroma is very malty with some biscuit and bread notes, as well as some toffee and a bit of sugar. The flavor is also very malty. There is good toffee and caramel in the flavor, as well as some sweet biscuit malt. There is also a hint of grass. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
