"Good and drinkable for the money.  Much better than comparable beers at this price."

"The taste is also grainy and malty up front in a moderate way with a light bite at the end to balance it all off. It is fairly easy to quaff."

"I'll admit I thought this would be a drain pour but it wasn't that bad, it wasn't that good either but drinkable"

"Final Grade: 3.18, a C+."

"I have seen this beer before. Pale straw with a white head that drops and does not lace. Smells of corn. A sweetness in the body that is clearly not from malt. Some vegetal and creamed corn flavours play on the palate. Surprisingly clean finish on the palate with no substantial off flavours (nor hop bitterness). For what it is, not bad... What I want? Not so much..."

"Extremely drinkable, but not a whole lot of flavour."
"drinkability wise you could suck these down all night. i know they used to make splits my father used to pound down when he was my age. i believe this paticular bottle is a canadian reuseable bottle. i would never buy this (i was given a 12pack as a tip), but its worth atleast one try."
"Painfully mediocre beer with no redeeming factor other then being easy to drink. Got a bottle of this at a bar because I would never buy a six pack and wanted to get it over with."
"Sweet toasted grain and corn flavors. Mouthfeel is kinda thin and watery, but drinkable. Medium carbonation too. Best served cold."
"Nothing special here, just as dull and somewhat off-putting as the rest of the Molson/Carling 'premium lager' products. My Dad was bang-on in his one gulp assessment - ""It tastes like yer average beer from back then."" The times, they haven't changed."
"""O.V", as my seatmate inspired me to try. Wow, did I ever get a solid two fingers' worth of fluffy, bone-white head off of that pour! Nose had the distinct lager-sweetness. Color was a medium golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Mouthfeel was medium with a honey-like sweetness on the tongue. Yowf! I was not expecting that! Finish had a lingering sweetness. Enough."

"This was refreshing enough while fishing up in Canada this past weekend, but not something I'd be likely to turn to on a regular basis."
"Standard Canadian macro presentation--fairly thick white head on a light to medium golden body. Little to no lacing on the mug. It doesn't flatten, thankfully, but it's hardly a looker. Corn malt, corn malt, corn malt--that's the smell and taste in a corn malt nutshell. Fairly sweet, typically bland--anything but complex. Smooth when cold, but embarrassingly thin texture. This is fine if your well-intentioned neighbor hands you a cold one over the fence after cutting the grass on a hot day. Even then, I'd be inclined to pass and grab a real, and good, brew from the fridge. Avoid."
"Drinkability - for a beer that's been sitting in a Cleveland basement for a year or more, I'm impressed. Kudos to Molson for brown bottles and light-blocking boxes, eh? I was initially struck that this reminded me in a distant way of a bottle of Avery Samael, a 14.5% monster I had last night. Obviously there is a world of difference, but the grain sweetness has a similarity that just made me think of it. This is like an ""OFest Extra Light"". I' m happy to have received a half-case of these and hope my return toss of a Young's Double Chocolate 4-pack will be equally enjoyed (you *know* it will...hell yeah!). Here's to beer and the people that enjoy them. Thanks Lori! ;-)"
"This is one of the old Carling O'Keefe products (Carling O'Keefe's Ol' Vienna Lager) that was popular in the late 70s and early 80s complete with television commercials. It pours a weak yellow colour with little head. The aroma was very skunky (every time I have tried this). The taste is rather skunky as well, not a friend to the mouth at all. Strong carbonation, and very little discernable maltiness."
"This is the best beer i've ever drank hands down. I like it even better than molson export. It's probably the absolute smoothest beer around. Exceptional taste and mouthfeel. I really could drink this beer forever, its so smooth. Drinkability is awesome. Just a classic beer. This beer is great anytime of the year, especially in the summer it can be quite thirst quenching, its a little malty and somewhat sweet, but it's just got a classic taste thats hard to describe. This beer is pretty popular with the elders, and pretty well known around wny."
"THE BLOODHOUND FACTOR: Both muts were mildly interested in this one, but the sweetness seemed to turn them off."
"Like I've mentioned twice before in this review, this beer is what it is, which is nothing specacular. Will not be buying again."
"The beer bottle is prettier than the beer. Pours a clear yellow with no head. None. Their is a very thin ring of white bubbles around the rim of the beer. That's it. No lace. Smells of corn, grain, and grass. Tastes weak, but alright. Bit of bread, corn, and grain husks. Slightly overcarbonated mouthfeel. Thin and watery. Not very drinkable. Not very good."
"Strange beer, sold for a dollar at the local hot-spot. I expected a flavorless beer, but it actually had something to it. There was definite maltiness in this one, something along the lines of a light bock, no kidding. Bready, toasted flavor even though it was masked by a watered down, carbonated, awful watery flavor. There was something to this but not a whole lot. I'm impressed that it had any flavor at all, considering the place that I frequent has basically nothing decent but Yuengling. A cheap and effective beer."
"Poured from a can, pale clear and yellow, a splash of white head at first, but no retention. The smell is of sweetish corn and grain husks, with a bit of a sharp bite, either from hops or chemicals, it is difficult to tell. Flavour is raw and husky, with an underlying sweet undertow. The mouthfeel is about average, but it has a caustic burn texture to it, from the adjuncts or other unmentionable additives. If you're gonna drink it then drink it ice cold and straight out of the can, it eases the pain a bit. Otherwise skip it completely."
"Thin white head that disappeared rather quickly. Clear, pale, straw-yellow. Mild smell with little in the way of hops or malt, but with noticeable corn aroma. Corn sweetness dominated the weak flavour, with a mild sourness at the finish. Very thin body on the edge of being watery. I'm glad I tried this one for free."
"If you've got the extra $5, then go Canadian. But if you don't, then why not OV?"
"Not up to par with other Molson products. Pours pale golden yellow with no head. Corn in both the aroma and in the taste. It is smooth going down. I don't know about buying this again. It was not true to the style. I was dissappointed by the whole thing."
"Not a really memorable beer but it has been a staple in Canadian beer stores for 50 years so It must have a following among older Canadian beer drinkers."
"Simply put, O.V. is flat golden straw water that has no discernable similarities to any good interpretation of the Marzen style. Aromas of corn and adjuncts dominate the smell. Most qualities are similiar to a cheap macro pale lager. Its fizzy, yellow, and smells like Busch."
"This is slightly better than average for a Canadian beer. All aspects of this brew meet criteria with one exception...Where's the Head??? Appearance is weak due to the fact that it looks like apple juice. Put two fingers of lasting foam on this puppy and you have a contender."
"Properly cooled, OV was quenching and marginally drinkable but boring.  Lawnmower or ""give to your non-ba friends"" beer...not up to par with Ex or Canadian Ale in the cheapie case department.  Will not be purchasing this again."
