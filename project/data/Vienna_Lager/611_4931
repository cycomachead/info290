3.18,-4.2,3.5,3,3,3.5,3.5,"Out of a bottle this beer was a clear copper color with two fingers of head that quickly faded. The aroma was of caramel malt and nuts. The flavors were of caramel malt, sweet malt and a bit of nuts. It was very simple and though not bad it wasn’t much to talk about. The mouthfeel was average, the body medium and the carbonation a bit high.","thekevlarkid","Oct 05, 2010"
3.13,-5.7,3.5,3,3,3,3.5,"D: Decent drinker, but a tad sweet to have more than 1-2. A nice unoffensive brew. Got as a 6-pack mixer.","soju6","Oct 02, 2010"
3.88,16.9,4,3.5,4,4,4,"There is a pretty smooth finish with some mildly assertive carbonation. It was another decent brew from Wagner Valley from whom I've never had a dud yet. Good job.","cooch69","Jun 01, 2010"
3.3,-0.6,3,3,3.5,3,3.5,"D- very drinkable, seems to be a solid amber lager but I'm not sure I'd go out of my way to have it again.","Franz4","Feb 11, 2010"
3.26,-1.8,4,3,3,4,3.5,"Overall, I'd say it's a pretty decent beer. At first, the initial sweetness was off-putting to me, when I've taken the time to enjoy it, I actually like the balance of flavors. The six-pack I picked up will come in handy as a nice refreshment for a summer day.","JDH2000","Jan 29, 2010"
3.51,5.7,4,3,3.5,3.5,4,"A straight-forward, malty, easy drinking Vienna Lager.","jwc215","Dec 18, 2009"
3.8,14.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"I like this beer. I tried it for the first time on tap at the brewhouse and got a mix a six pack with two of these. I must say I liked it better on the tap, but this was still pretty decent. Poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint Glass. It pours a nice hearty amber color, with excellent clarity. It has a nice frothy foamy head that initially looks great, but the beer provides no lacing or glass retention at all, I'd probably give it another full point on the appearance scale if that was the case, plus it clears up completely in maybe 2 minutes. The smell is pretty good too, very malty. Smells caramelized and toasted. The taste is much like the smell, generously malty and great on a cold night. The taste is initially sweet, roasted and caramelized malts. There's an additional sweetness that I can't quite put my finger on, maybe like a brown sugar or some type of brown sugar extract, pretty nice and well balanced though.***Let this beer warm up a little if it's in the refrigerator or don't refrigerate it at all. The flavor is dulled quite a bit when cooled off, more so than other beers I've tried*** I really can't taste the hops, but there is a bitter feel at the end so it's clearly noticeable as an ingredient. The mouthfeel is good, pretty full bodied and smooth. A very drinkable beer. I gotta say I was really in the mood for a malty beer when I drank this. So go for it if you're in the mood for a nice malty lager, but at the same token, avoid it at all cost when you're looking for something hoppy.","AndyAvalanche","Jun 06, 2009"
2.71,-18.4,4,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Reviewed on 8/11/09. Bottle. Pours a dark, clear brown with a small light tan head. Aroma of roasted malt, bready malt, toffee, and caramel. Flavor of cola, sweet bready malt, some vegetal notes as the beer warms. Thin, watery, grainy body. The aroma/flavor composition are more like a doppelbock than a vienna to me. The flavor gets worse as you drink it. Not a fan.","LilBeerDoctor","Mar 18, 2009"
3.31,-0.3,4,3,3,3.5,4,"this beer pours a pretty amber color with a tall white head that recedes to lace. the aroma presents some light sweet malt and just a touch of those bottom feeders. the taste once again is just a bit of light sweet malt at the start, the odd citrus hop selection and the dry lager finish. the light body and aggressive carbonation make this a pretty easy drinker, but not nearly as good as the oatmeal stout...","almychristopher","Mar 09, 2009"
2.58,-22.3,3.5,3,2,3.5,2.5,"I was expecting a little more from this beer and it just turned out weird and offsetting. This was the first of a mixed six pack I got as a gift from this brewery so I'm hoping the rest are a little better.","wiseguy142","Oct 12, 2008"
3.33,0.3,4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Pours a clear dark brown. Candy nose. Flavor brings a bit too much of the same. Too much cotton candy sweetness. Too much tang. No balance. None of the earthy character I would hope would be delivered. Feel is slick and smooth on liquid. Carbonation is middle of the road, but what's there nips at the mouth. Too sweet. Too tangy. Pass.","RblWthACoz","Jun 17, 2008"
3.26,-1.8,4,3,3,4,3.5,"Drinkability: so-so as this is a bit thin. Low alcohol gives this a bit higher nod, but overall this is a bit dull.","Gavage","Jan 07, 2008"
2.5,-24.7,3.5,3.5,2,2.5,2,"It's a shame, because Wagner does some awesome brews, especially the Sled Dog. And maybe I got a bad batch. But overall, I'm not going with this one again.","Newsman","Nov 13, 2007"

4,20.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Anyway... Without doing a horizontal tasting... It seems to be right along the lines of the sled dog - just on the lighter side. And that's fine. I'm sure I be drinking more of these - their prices are very reasonable for what you get.","charlesw","Dec 14, 2006"
3,-9.6,3,3,3,3,3,"Pours medium-dark mahogany amber with a light beige foamy head, quick dissipation, decent carbonation. Smells slightly like dried raisins or prunes with some malts and a bit of 'oldness'. I think it was sittin' in the bottle a bit too long. Taste followed well, medium maltiness, lightly sweet, and a good punch of hops. Rather well balanced but again tasted a bit outdated. Overall, OK, but better on tap.","aquatonex","Aug 26, 2006"
3.8,14.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"An all around enjoayble beer. Very middle of the road.","tgbljb","Jun 07, 2005"
3.57,7.5,3.5,4,2.5,4,5,"D - I finished this before I realized it. It is an ideal session beer. Great with food. It other characteristics are average for the most part, but it is the sort of beer you will drink five of before realize it.","mrasskicktastic","Apr 07, 2005"
2.9,-12.7,3,3,3,3,2.5,"Decidedly brown in colour with a medium amount of carbonation. Its got a nutty / malty aroma with little hop influance. The caramel malt is the dominant flavor, along with some minor notes of vienna and munich malts and some clean bitterness. Still, it's a little too cloying to have more than one of these. Its fairly average stuff.","fisherman34","Beers"
4.2,26.5,4,4,4,4,5,"12 oz bottle. Brownish orange, thin white head. Clean malty aroma, somewhat nutty. Flavor is very malty and clean. Nice munich carmel notes. Decent mouth feel. Light and drinkable, with plenty of flavor. This is very well done, and right to the Vienna style. Could use a bit better head retention, though.","vladtheimpaler","0"
3.88,16.9,1.5,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Explodes out of bottle with a 5+ finger light brown head but fades quickly leaving only traces of lace. Murky brown/amber with a ton of chunky bits, ugliest beer I've seen in a while. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Nose is raisin and yeast. Starts with sweet raisin & plum, there is a hint of yeast in the background, finishes smooth and is actually very drinkable. $1.00 for a 12 oz bottle from Hoosick Street Discount Bev. Troy, NY.","jdhilt","Sep 04, 2004"
3.52,6,3,3.5,3.5,3,4,"Vienna maltroastednutty qualitieslightly hopped aroma. This beer is a mildly aeromatic, but very pleasant to smell. Subtle and understated, but very nice. Its a dark, nearly ruby, reddish-brown color. The hue is more deep than what Id call amber. It has no appreciable head. Moderately sweet up front with a nice bitter and lingering hoppiness by the finish. Enjoyable and average local brew.","Suds","Aug 19, 2004"
3.13,-5.7,3.5,3,3,3,3.5,"Poured in an imperial pint glass, forms a 1/2"" creamy light tan head, which laces ok. A copper hued brew, with a prevailing aroma of slightly nutty malts. Taste is follows the nose, but just seems to be lacking in the flavor department. Mouthfeel is thin, and drinkability is okay. Not bad for a session, hanging-around-with-the-guys-watching-football brew, if that's what you're looking for.","ppoitras","Jul 01, 2004"
3.5,5.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"The beer after dislodging itself from the 12-ounce brown bottle sets in the glass an amber color with a modest off white head that is frothy in texture as it dissolves the lace forms a fine curtain to drape the glass. Nose has a sweet malted grain aroma, crisp and fresh to the senses with the start lightly sweet and pleasingly malted, the top is middling in its feel to the palate. Finish is middle0of-th-road as far as acidity goes, the hops delectable in their spicy bite, the aftertaste dry, and a nice change of pace.","Gusler","Jun 11, 2004"
3.03,-8.7,3.5,3,3,3,3,"Nice and smooth with a smoked aspect to it. Sweetens by midsip, and ends with an off bitterness to it. Probably the weakest offering from Wagner I've encountered.","cbl2","Apr 15, 2004"
3.75,13,4,4,3.5,4.5,3.5,"The beer pours a dark amber color with a thick frothy off-white head. The aroma is good. It has a dry toasted aroma with a malty scent created with the use of pale, crystal, and vienna malts. The taste is decent. It has a bitter, dry, and toasted flavor that goes down easy, but leaves a grainy aftertaste. It has a nice malty core and suttle hop flavor. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good drinker lager. It has a strange taste, but it's growing on me. It has a bit of an unsavory metal flavor.","WesWes","Feb 11, 2004"
3.12,-6,2.5,3,3,3.5,3.5,"I want to love these guys. I really do. Anyone who both brews beer and wine is worthy of everyones respect. I wish I have had a good beer from them. When I was there the other day, I bought a sixer of everything they had. This was your perfectly average lager. Amber in colour it was. A moderate head. The smell was light all around. Mild hops and mild malts. a little caramel. The taste was exactly the same. I don't know. It's just your middle of the road lager.","CBFanWish","Sep 26, 2003"
3.32,0,3,3.5,3.5,3,3,"12 oz. bottle: Yes, it is amber in color, just like the name. It pours pretty clear, with a little head. The aroma is malty sweet, with some caramel. The taste contains some roastiness to balance the sweetness. Some hops there in the background. Not too bad. It gets better with each sip.","Boto","Jul 26, 2003"
2.85,-14.2,3.5,3.5,2.5,4,2,"Where is the malt flavor? A mediocre vienna lager.","nomad","May 27, 2003"
1.54,-53.6,3,1.5,1.5,1,1.5,"I've tried many amber lagers in my day but none quite like this one. There was so much carbonation that, blindfolded, I might have thought I was drinking some strange type of soda pop. While the beer didn't gush out of the bottle, it poured mostly foam into the glass. The bottle says it's a Vienna style lager but, to me, it gave off an unpleasant taste of sweet caramel - very raw and unbalanced as if the product was bottled before its time. I'm amazed it could have passed any quality control test before leaving the brewery. No question the beer was fresh- too fresh, I'm afraid. Unfortunately, I bought a 6-pack as I've had several other Wagner Valley products, particularly the Sled Dog Dopplebock, which impressed me. Guess their quality isn't consistent from product to product.","Greenlabel","Mar 07, 2003"
3.73,12.3,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"A pleasing if somewhat raw beer. I had no problems with gushing or overcarbonation. Head rose high and lingered with lace over a maple syrup/sap colored amber, a very attractive lager. Nose fruity with strong hints of maple and brown sugar. Beer is not as sweet as all that, although the caramel underbelly is certainly sugary (and tasty). Bitter, piney hops and musty, fruity yeast do a nice job of evening out the woody flavor. An enjoyable beer although novices may be put off by the strong, unrefined flavor. Not me. Amber lagers are versatile with many different foods, but why not try this in the morning alongside a tall stack of flapjacks?","Thrasher","Feb 03, 2003"
3.55,6.9,3,3,4,3.5,3.5,"The taste is by far its strong point with a mild malt background and a slight hint of caramel. Full bodied and impressive once you get by its heady weakness.","Shiloh","Jan 01, 2003"
1.49,-55.1,2.5,1,2,1,1,"Thanks to Davo for the sample.","Bighuge","Jul 16, 2002"
2.58,-22.3,3,2.5,2.5,3,2.5,"For a Vienna style, this had a rather faint, roasted malt with a rather odd, smokey aspect. Perhaps it is the yeast strain being used here, but the beer had an off flavor that threw the beer out of balance. Not bad, but I do not find myself wanting another.","Brent","Beers"
4,20.5,4,4,4,4,4,"A solid offering in what generally is a rather uninspried catagory IMHO. This has some similarities to SA Boston Lager, but kicked up a notch or two. The malts are balanced nicely with spicey Hallertau and Tettnang. Finishes clean and beckons you drink more.","John","0"
