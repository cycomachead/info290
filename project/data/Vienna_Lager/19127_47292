Has a nice wheat scent mixed with some floral and citrus hints. Has a slightly dry start with a crisp and clean finish. The finishing taste was a lot better than the beginning taste.

3.55,-6.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Another beer I'm trying for the first time after passing it by all the time at the store. It pours a clear light brass topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises buttery caramel, very light lemon zest, flowers, and light sweetgrass. The taste holds notes of toffee, very mild cocoa, flowers, grass, greens, and what seems like some toasted malts. The body is a hefty light, with a very light moderate carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, a fairly solid Vienna, though the nose is pretty weak and the flavors just don't seem to meld all the way (if that makes any sense anymore).","TMoney2591","Apr 22, 2011"

4.26,12.7,4.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"O -- This beer just about nails the Vienna Lager style -- in fact, I'll probably revisit this review in a couple days, after I've sampled a couple more, because it could be just about perfect, but for the low aroma characters. The flavor of the beer is complex and mellow at the same time -- very much as you'd expect in the style.","steveh","Apr 08, 2011"
4,5.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a clear copper color with enough lacing for the duration of this session. Toasted bread and a faintness of caramel in this immaculate nose. Refreshing crispness reaches new levels here; a wonderful mouthfeel. Uniform toastiness, on the dry side, though there is a quick touch of caramel in the middle. Hops have a quick sting of bitter- ness with some raw herbal flavors. Dry, toasted-grain ending. A solid brew, very easy to drink with a smattering of well-placed complexities to make it interesting.","BeerAdvocate","Mar 23, 2011"

3.53,-6.6,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Overall: Likes it's brother, Krankshaft, I would describe this beer as "clean." It had an "every man's beer," quality - or "woman's".

3.56,-5.8,4,3,3.5,4,4,"The beer pours the vienna lager traditional orange red color with a white half-finger of foam. The smell was a bit bready and corny for my liking. It didn't make it foul it just seemed similar to an adjunct aroma than a barley aroma. The taste was decent, there was a bit of bready earthiness that was pleasant, but there was really no hop flavor to help assist in the flavor, it left me wanting. The mouthfeel was good nothing overly exciting. It is drinkable, I think it's just a regular old lager, nothing bad to say about it, but nothing really good to say about it.","Vdubb86","Nov 21, 2010"
3.78,0,4,3.5,4.5,4,2.5,"I saw this beer was a new arrival at my local lousy liquor store and bought it because it was fresh, and the it had NO freshness date. It pours out a well, copper color into my Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass. Nice deep rich copper, a shade richer than your more familiar vienna lager, with a kinda thin quickly fading head. Some light lacing. The smell of this beer is clean, like a good lager should, with accents of spicy/herbal German hops and some toasty caramel malts. It isn't quite as floral as some which slightly disappoints. Nice toasty, almost caramel maltiness and some slightly herbal, drying hops in the aftertaste. So well balanced, and goes down very easy. This is well crafted beer, a nice departure from the infinite malt bombs / hops bombs out there. I would like to buy more of this beer and feel fortunuate it is available in my area, but I willl likely shy away in the future because the freshness will always be questionable. There are no categories for "freshness", so I guess I will take it off of drinkability, even though my fresh sample is extremely drinkable ;-(","Star80","Nov 04, 2010"
4.07,7.7,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"The mouthfeel pairs a light to medium body with light carbination. The aftertaste is sweet caramel that lingers and teases me to take another sip.

I happened across this gem in a biker bar in Chicago and fell instantly in love with it. It is perfectly balanced and quite flavorful. It feels so smooth and tangy, which i realize are conflicting adjectives, and yet the Dynamo can pull it off. If this beer were a country I would go to war and die for it. If this beer were a band I would be its roadie, groupie, and number one fan. As it is with all beers there is something in the body that is lost in translation from tap to bottle, but the Dynamo still tastes and feels great regardless of the medium by which it is consumed.

3.68,-2.6,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"clear amber with a nice creamy head. lightish nose is caramelly, bready, with grassy, spicy hops underneath. taste follows suit, with the lightly sweet malts gently washed out by the supporting smooth hop bitterness. nice frothy carbonation helps with mouthfeel and drinkability. light-bodied and sessionable.","MrMcGibblets","Aug 12, 2009"
3.93,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,"very happy that one of the biggest cities in the US is finally on the map for beer. i just don't liike the fact that each brewery has to find a niche to become palatable to the general public in this city... but i suppose they are just starting out. look forward to some different styles. i really respect the fact that they are going through the act of making a beer that is accessible to the public that isn't easier to produce... whereas most are 'craft beer' typical that steers away from drinkable and are more preoccupied with making the ultimate hop geared beer. i look forward to their ventures.","rtepiak","Aug 03, 2009"

4,5.8,4,4,4,4,4,"I poured this copper colored lager into a pint glass. There was a medium head with a little bit of lacing. The nose is mostly caramel with a little bit of nuttiness. The taste is refreshing, not too sweet, well balanced. Mouthfeel is fairly viscus for a lager, pretty smooth. I could drink quite a few of these in a sitting, seems like a good shoulder season drinker. I think this a good example of a style rarely brewed by American craft brewers. That said, I don't know if I would pay $10 for a six pack of this too often.","littlekidlover","Jun 26, 2009"
3.89,2.9,3,4,4,3.5,4,"D: Good, I like Flywheel better, but it's nice to see a brewery focus on lagers, not something you see much of these days, especially in American brews.","bluemoonswoon","Jun 08, 2009"
3.77,-0.3,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,"D= I like ales better than lagers, so for me this was a great lager because it didn't meet the style guidelines very well. All that aside, it was easy drinking and sessionable, and tasted good enough to want more than one.","spointon","Jun 07, 2009"
3.8,0.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,"Ring of foam atop a hazey rust and copper colored amber brew. Faint spicey hops mix with toasted malts that give gariny carameled bread aromas. Toasty, vibrant malts dance on the tip of the tongue. Dry as well as sweet malt flavors balanced with Hallertau hops and their touch of spice. Dry ad malty palates make for a flavorful session lager.","scruffwhor","May 19, 2009"

4.2,11.1,4,4,4,4,5,"Whoa. A massive amount of foam (about half a half-liter mug) with this one. Pours a brilliant copper, almost red color. The foam settles, leaving behind little sticky bits on the sides of the glass. It's difficult for me to pin down what this beer smells like; fresh grain is sort of buried under another aroma, perhaps toasted marshmallow? It's not huge, but I think it's there. This one drinks like a Marzen: it's all about caramel and toasted malt that almost gets a bit tawny in the finish, which has probably just the right amount of hearty malt and bitter hops in the finish. Quite tasty, fresh and ridiculously drinkable.","marcobrau","Apr 01, 2009"
3.53,-6.6,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This lager goes beyond mass market lagers, in that it has actual good flavor, characterized by actual malt and real hoppiness. It's higher in alcohol than most lagers, and that's good.Other than that, it's not really a big beer.","mrquartetman","Mar 26, 2009"
3.45,-8.7,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"D: In a style that is quite drinkable, although not the best tasting variety that I've had. It's nice to support a local up-and-comer, and I really like the idea of the lager-only brewery, so I'll probably go with this one from time to time.","Thorpe429","Mar 09, 2009"

3.06,-19,4,3,3,3,3,"Nothing really special about this beer. Drinks like an immature Lager. I think it may be a bit misnamed. Thought it would have a bit more color for a copper lager. It drinks easy and pours with a nice head and lacing. Simply an average beer both inn mouth feel and drinkability. There are so many other, better beers available to drink.","DownDaHatch","Feb 01, 2009"
