4.5,22.6,,,,,,"Cloudy amber colored pour with a small off-white head. Great malty aroma with hints of caramel, yeast and toast. Taste follows the nose with caramel and bready malt flavors upfront. Slightly sweet taste that also has a nice cereal grain presence with just a hint of hops. Light to medium bodied and drinks really easy. Very well done beer.","Karibourgeois","Sep 03, 2014"

I loved it all the way through and a perfect diversion from the hop-crazy landscape out there right now; just enough sweetness for taste but not enough to overpower the good toasted grain notes. i will definitely be drinking this one again.","Premo88","Mar 01, 2014"
