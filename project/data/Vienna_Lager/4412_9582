Smell is of malt, spice, and scented baby wipe aromas. Taste is much the same with malt and spice flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an above average beer with an odd smell but the taste is decent enough.","UCLABrewN84","Aug 11, 2013"

Regardless, this stuff pours a clear pale sunset brass topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises mild biscuit and very light flowers. I think I get some hard water, but that may be from the glass (my apartment's water is harder than bricks). The taste brings in more of the same, along with a few drops of honey-like sweetness peeking through from time to time. The body straddles the line between hefty light and light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda drying finish. Overall, a nice, if nondescript, little beer, nothing worth sneezing at, and nothing bad enough to wipe your nose on. Worth a go, at least.","TMoney2591","Jul 29, 2013"

Bitter flavor with some malt backgrounds. no real detection of the floral aromas I was getting in the taste. Defiantly lingers on the palette with a pungent flavor. This is a good strong lager but doesn't have any thing too interesting about it other than the box it comes in. Not a bad little beer but a little to pricey for the novelty when it is a pretty standard brew.","bamojr","Jun 07, 2011"

Toasty malts in the taste, grainy, woody, with some caramel sweetness. Some hop bitterness comes in towards the end, leaving a dry and somewhat bland aftertaste.

3.48,3.3,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,4,"Well I'm not sure if I'm board in calling this a "Euro Pale Lager." Definitely seems to be closer to a marzen or Oktoberfest to me, given the fairly deep amber color and strong malty flavors. In any case, got it cause it was cheap and I hadn't tried it before (although quite honestly I should have gone with the SN Celebration for a dollar more). Pours an amber color with a smallish big bubbled head that dissolves fast. Nose is mild malt, a touch of graininess. Flavor is much better, if still fairly mild. Sweet and slightly spicy malt, graininess, and a bit earthy. Some light fruity flavors. Body is light with fairly sprightly carbonation. Overall, not terrible, although definitely nothing too exciting. Either a weak marzen or a good Euro pale lager.

A dark orange, seethru body with one finger head that died quickyl. A slightly hoppy smell with some citric and flower notes, along with hints of sweet malt. A bit of malt taste along with light floral hops in the taste, mixed OK and rather faint. Has some crispness in the medium body too, like sour apple, and a semi-dry backbite.

4.35,29.1,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Tasted again for the first time. Something I've tried before, but hadn't had it in a long time. A friend said he tried it at the Firkin Festival and it was one of his favorites--even among all the dozens of others available on tap. So I bought some again. Poured nice amber/gold in the glass with a hint of haze and a short head of foam that dissipated quickly. Definitely smooth and slick with a moderate body and light carbonation (nailed the "lager" profile right on the head). Hint of sweet malt in the nose with a rich German-style pale roundness. Not much in the way of off flavors and just a hint of hops (offering a nice balanced bitterness on the back of the tongue) so extremely drinkable. Very nice indeed. And very fresh tasting (since it's made locally). Glad I tried it. I'll have to take some to tailgate at the Ravens game next week!","tugdriver7","Jan 13, 2007"

4.22,25.2,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,4.5,"Poured a cloudy red with a foamy head that quickly dissipated. Smelled toasty and a little sweet; well-balanced aroma. Initially, a slightly hoppy kick with a warming-sweet flavor going down; a roasted-maltiness in the aftertaste. Very drinkable - this could be a great everyday beer.","JohnnyM2002","Sep 17, 2006"
4.08,21.1,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"Drinkability - Very drinkable, very solid for a macro. This is certainly a step-up from Budweiser, and considering the extra buck and half in price for a six-pack, I think its certainly worth it.","palffyfan","Jun 26, 2006"
4.3,27.6,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Poured a crystal clear medium copper color with modest slightly off-white puffy head. Nice lacing as the head slowly fell to a thin ring.Smell is a pleasant combination of maltiness and sweet fruit. Taste has a frim malty character with a nice balancing amount of hops. Full creamy mouthfeel. Very drinkable. An excellent macro lager. This is what they should all taste like.","tgbljb","Jun 12, 2006"
3.55,5.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,4,"Pours a nice clear copper with an off-white head. Aroma is mainly sweet, bready malts with a slight hint of hops. Flavor is along the same lines...mostly malty with faint, fruity hops trying to make their presence known. Mouthfeel is ok...nothing spectactular. Average lager that goes down easy sums this one up.","Imstillthegman","May 19, 2006"

3.36,-0.3,4,3,3.5,4,3,"Sampled this at a festival, which is the only place I ever see this beer. Pours a clear golden orange with a good bit of carbonation visible and a full finger of head. Nose is weak and uninteresting, malty with the unpleasant corn aroma of an adjunct lager. Taste was simple but good--strong malts with hints of caramel and just the faintest bit of hops bitterness, which surprised me. The mouthfeel is soft and smooth and it finishes with a light malty aftertaste. As someone who swore off beer for years because I had only tasted American lagers and despised the taste, I must say that this is far and away the best of the style I've ever had a taste of. That being said, there are still a lot better, more flavorful beers, out there and I won't be buying this any time soon.","cubedbee","May 14, 2005"
3.44,2.1,2.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Mouthfeel was smooth with a light crispness at the start and finish. The caramel tones lingered softly on the tongue. Drinkability is decent. Not a beer to go searching for, but not a bad offering at a bar that only has other macros.","Gavage","Jan 19, 2005"

3.88,15.1,4,3.5,4,4,4,"I've seen this beer in 6-packs during prior trips to Virginia but it never looked fresh and the bottles were not dated. This month I saw it in cases at a Total Wine store and was able to read a date on the case. My 6-pack lived up to that dating - it was definitely fresh and refreshing. Nice color, good head and lace, soft mouthfeel and pleasant malty aftertaste. I doubt this product sells in much quantity as it's a limited contract brew. Nonetheless, I thought it to be a very acceptable session-type lager and will be happy to purchase it again on a future trip if I can find another fresh 6-pack. Have never seen it outside of Maryland and Virginia.","Greenlabel","Feb 28, 2004"
3.85,14.2,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"This beer is contract brewed at the Clipper City Brewing Company in Baltimore. It pours a clear, deep-amber body with an orange cast. Steadily rising bubbles can clearly be seen adding to the foamy white cap that holds well and maintains a thin surface covering throughout the first half of the glass. The nose delivers a sweetish caramel malt that's infused with lightly floral hops. The body is medium and it's smooth in the mouth with a very fine, moderate carbonation that gently tingles the tongue. The flavor offers a rich, sweetish malt that indicates the use of Munich, and perhap crystal, malts. It's balanced by a firm bitterness and infused with lightly floral hops; and finishes soft and smooth with some residual malt and a light touch of hop flavor.","NeroFiddled","Sep 23, 2003"
