"No good tastes like liquid tree."
"A little yeasty and dry on the back pallet. Maybe a bit too effervescent."
"Solid beer to drink, like yuengling"

"I had this served to me on tap at harpoon Larry's.  Dark amber with no head to speak up, minimal lacing.  Smell is faint wheat and malts.  The taste was slightly floral, with some hoppiness on the tongue, but it didn't hit me with the same bang that Eliot Ness did a while back.  The mouthfeel is pretty solid, with medium body and a decent bite on the back of the tongue.  Overall, this is a slightly above average Vienna."
""
""
"Yup. If enjoyability was a catagory....or a word....it would be a 5."
"The is the ultimate Vienna Lager.  The great taste is memorable and this is the one I measure all other Vienna lagers against."
""

"Light carbonation with a great flavor."
""
""
""
""
"Good dark red lager. Low ABV, so really nice on a work night."
""
""
""
""

"O: The smell and taste are pleasant and this beer is quite drinkable. A little lacking in the appearance but otherwise good."
""
""
"Smooth and very drinkable. Makes me hoppy"
""
""

"Pint at County Grill in Yorktown with family and Ronnie & Donna."
"Smooth Vienna lager that's one of my go-to beers to have in my kegerator, as it's not too dark nor too light for guests."

"Overall, this is good stuff whether on its own or with a meal, and seems to pair better with food compared to the other Vienna-style lagers I've tried so far--I'm not sure what makes the difference there (maybe the particular variety of hops used in each one, or maybe my taste buds just like these kinds of beers more with fish & chips rather than with spicy chicken tacos?), but it was definitely appreciated at lunch today."
"Smooth and refreshing malty lager. Just what I'm looking for in the style."
"wife always picks a good beer on her away from fl and she know nothing about beer , just a copper color beer thats a crisp taste but also some hits of hops taste ans carmel smmoth so drink another"

"Can't believe I hadn't ever reviewed this!  Great color and light beige head. Smells lightly of caramel and crisp yet not overpowering hops. Sweet caramel pops just before a bitter taming from the hops comes around. Smooth and slightly light mouthfeel. Finish is clean, no cloying sweetness in aftertaste. Great all around drinker for almost any situation and fantastic gateway beer for your macro friends."

"Hot damn, I can see why this has garnered a couple GABF medals. It holds a rich, deep malt character over a crisp dry body. It's deeply delicious and satisfying, and also oh so drinkable. The barley brings a sweet caramel note, with toasty bread crust, smooth husk, and a hint of fruit juice in the finish. Great beer, go find it."

"would definitely try again"

"Thought that this was an ok beer.  Nothing too much exciting about it--malt sweetness is about it, with muted flavors otherwise.  However, it doesn't offend either, which is better than many beers.  Very drinkable, with a low ABV, and if I ran into again, I would consider it.  There is a place in the world for good, yet boring, beer."
""
"Not a lager fan, generally, but this is about as good as lager gets in my opinion."

"I am on a work trip in VA, so I am devoted to drinking as many hard to find breweries as I can.  Went to the Tap Room in Reston, and Shawn the bartender recommended this - he was reaching as the Loose Cannon was all gone.  Anyways, had this since it was a low ABV.  Need to be responsible.  Especially since the next 3 beers may not be as kind.  Anyways this beer was a little wispy.  No head, golden amber color.  Not a hop to be found. Crispy and wet.  I will give it that.  If there was a fire, I would immediately think to get this beer.  My dislike has more to do with the vienna Lager style I think.  This was just ok in my mind"

"T: Clean, balanced beer with notes of grass, honey, wheat bread crust, and toasty-ness"
""

""
""
"I wasn't terribly impressed with this beer.  It pours a dark amber with a 1 "" foamy head that dissipates VERY quickly to nothing.  No real lacing left along the glass as you finish.  Smell is malty, with a touch of sweetness, but nothing really stands out apart from the malt.  There are slight hints of caramel, but overall the taste is VERY thin.  Just not much to it.  By the end of one, I was ready to try something else."

"One of the better examples of the style I have had in a while.  Nice and malty I would get a six pack of this if I saw it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not a lot of hops detected, but finishes with just enough bitterness to balance out the predominantly sweet, malty flavors.  Overall, a very drinkable beer that most will likely find to be non-objectionable, but not a revelation."
""
"Its delicate and malty-dry finish is medium-light and never challenges the palate. Its high drinkability and soothing texture develops into an herbal bitterness to finish that's only intense enough to offset the trailing malts, revealing a near minty flavor and feel in its wake."

"My aggro pour created a pseudo-cascade that formed a brief finger of tawny head that quickly exhausted itself and became wisps. Color was a deep-amber (SRM = > 13, < 17) with NE-quality clarity. Nose was very sweet with notes of maple syrup and clover honey. Mouthfeel was on the thin side, very soft on the tongue. The taste was much like the nose - quite sweet with notes of syrup and honey along with molasses and brown sugar. Finish was semi-sweet, not quite as cloying as I might have expected. Once again, this was more of a curiosity for me than anything else and now my curiosity (and thirst) was satiated."

"Flavor: Liquid bread is the correct description of this beer. The bready malt is the primary flavor but adds some caramel malt sweetness and a nice hop bite for balance. There is a ’burnt toast’ bitterness that seems to be common in Vienna style lagers that I have tried."

"Overall - I am NOT a Vienna Lager fan, but this beer is quite tasty. Glad I got it as an extra in a trade!"

"My beer guru sent this one to me to try. It was a great pour, carbonated but and overly sized head, the head stuck around and clung to the glass. I normally do not care for a clear beer but liked the appearance of this one. Nothing interesting in smell. Decent tasting beer, especially from someone who is typically ""meh"" about Lager. Overall a pretty good beer that I enjoyed. One I would enjoy again but not seek out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not bad. It's a respectable lager lacking in pizzazz. I wouldn't buy again, but it would make a solid go-to in a place with mostly just BMC."

"Overall- Nice take on the Vienna Lager style. I maintain that GLBC's Elliot Ness is a better representation, but this is certainly a very solid take on the style."

"O: A friend told me about stumbling upon the Devil's Backbone brewery/restaurant during his travels, and spoke well of it. When I saw a bottle of this beer I had to try it. I'm not the world's top lager fan, and this one didn't convert me, but it's a very drinkable (i.e. sessionable) beer, and for the price I'll be buying a few more to pair with meals."
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer is probably one of my favorite lighter colored beer. I have introduced it to several friends and family. They all do a double take at the beer and a mental note for their shopping list. Devils Backbone for me came out of no where and have been producing a great product."
""
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a caramel color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, some light malts. Taste is crisp, some toasted malts, a bit of grains, a refreshing and sessionable beer. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a pretty good brew."
""
""
""
"Overall - Meh. I don't even think it's that good for a Vienna."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Its one of those beers that you can drink, but really not thinking about it."

"A nice German style lager made in the Mid-Atlantic. I do remember draft versions being more malty and fantastic, so it is possible that the bottled version (or at least the one I got) isn't quite as good."

"O-a very good Vienna lager"
""
"Clean and crisp with a spicy hop bite that lingers over the yeast, pale malt and light fruit notes into a spicy, dry finish.  Slightly peppery with crisp earthy hops.  Somewhat floral with dank pine needle and grass followed by bread,  biscuit, pilsner malt and light fruit notes.  There's some nice apple and pear sweetness comlimenting the biscuit malts and crisp hop bitterness.  Nicely balanced and easy to drink.  Nothing too out of the ordinary but surprisingly flavorful and quite drinkable."

"The beer is copper to amber colored with a half inch of head. The aroma brings lager character, yeast, a touch of fruit, sweet breads, grain. A tad sweet, countered to a small degree by a touch of bitterness. Pretty light in body with moderate carbonation. A nice complement to the bratwurst and sauerkraut."
""
""
""
""

"Overall, a decent lager that isn't Sam Adams and worth getting just for some variety."

"3.5/5"
"Devils backbone Vienna. Pours light rusty amber see thru some foam. Very humble nose only malt. Taste is a sweet solid caramel malt firm carbonation and slight hop to close. Crisp finish. Nutty hints. Quite good. 4 35 4 425 4"
""
"o: a nice, simple vienna lager, a little sweet and undercarbonated for my personal taste, but one I’ll likely go back to as it’s strong overall"

"Tasted this at the Ebbitt Grill BrewHaHa during DC Beer Week 2013; this is a well made lager that balances malt and a sufficient amount of hops. Good balance and decent body makes for a superb sessional beer. Hope to grab one in a more relaxing setting next time."

"O- sessionable and full of flavor, reminiscent of SA Boston Lager. Tastes even better when served fresh from the tap"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - A very drinkable beer. At 4.9% it's got some great flavor and even better drinkability. The malts used have a lot of flavor packed in this vienna lager for sure. I only had one bottle from a trade, but I wish I'd had another to follow up!"

"Poured a golden body with a slight amber hue with good head and carbonation that die quick with little lace on top of a light aroma, not much there, but pick up some bitter hops and touches of caramel sweetness. Light bodied, easy to drink, and hitting the spot, there's not much at all going on with this beer but it is enjoyable. Not as bitter or dry as I am accustomed to, a good balance is in here from the dry, floral hop notes to some sticky sweet caramel. As said, not too much going on here but not a water light beer either and I can't complain."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this was the second beer I have had from this brewery, and this beer came with alot of hype but as very good. It will be purchased again and it is worth a try.Another good transition beer for thos looking to expand beer horizons."
""
""
""
""
"Very clean and goes down well, very well. One of the better American lagers I've sampled in recent months."
"Overall, a real disappointment. I had never heard of this brewery but was hoping I might find a hidden gem. Alas it was not to be."
"Poured into a becker a clear rich bronze with a well defined half finger white head that was pretty quick to fade.Aromas mainly of caramel doughy malt,flavors start out with caramel malt notes along with a whiskey-ish element to it,a decent smattering of spicy hops in the finish.A solid vienna lager not overly sweet with a nice amount of hops.A good beer for yard work and opening day Tiger baseball!"
"O: I can see why this beer has done so well in numerous competitions -- it layers bready, light caramelly maltiness with a solid crisp hops bite and light-medium feel. While I like SA Boston Lager, this beer crushes it -- SABL is very heavy-handed without much subtlety unlike DB Vienna Lager which layers a complex number of clean, malt characteristics with a crisp hops finish. I feel lucky to have this type of high-quality beer available in my backyard."

"Medium bodied, with good carbonation. Very well tempered and really good drinkability. Mellow enough to serve with near any meal. No overpowering or lingering hop presence. Just enough bitterness to balance out the sweetness and esters."
""
"Mouthfeel: Soft smooth, chwey mouthfeel. Super drinkable. Well-balanced. Excellent. No complaints here. Nothing pushing the envelope.Exactly what it should be."

"O: No major flaws, recommendation is a tighter, longer head. The nose could be stouter, a little more sweetness could happen and less bite."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Devil's Backbone Vienna Lager is a malt-forward classic rendition of a great German style. Soft and smooth with a well-balanced malt sweetness, the beer is easy drinking, delightfully simple, but filled with understated complexities."
""
"O- A refreshing beer, I've gone back to it a few times. An easy drinker but nothing amazing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer has grown on me. It's not spectacular, and not as complex as the beers I'm used to drinking, but it makes for a very pleasing session."
"A long draught reveals some mild but stubborn hoppiness tight wiring up against the sweetness of the caramel malt. Plenty of carbonation but this is still an easy to drink, fairly refreshing beer. Simple in nature, it makes the most of this style and leaves you satisfied. I could drink these all day, particularly as the fall progresses."
"Overall – While rather simple in its flavors, it is quite delicious and refreshing. A fantastic session brew."
""
""
""
"The palate opens with a blend of earthy hop bitterness, a little calcium/chalky mineral character and a toasty malt character. A little bit of burnt sugar, toffee, toast and bread are also present, all excellent flavors in great balance. What this beer does lack, however, is a little bit of body to carry these flavors, as it is a little watery on the mid-palate. Drying, mildly bitter (herbal, leafy) on the finish, with a light mineral character, this beer is light (too light) in body and has a medium-high level of carbonation. Solid stuff, definitely worthy, but I think the Sam Adams Boston Lager is a better alternative."
"O: A very drinkable beer, well balanced and tasty."
""
""
""
"O: As they say, very sessionable and enjoyable beer. Nothing groundbreaking here but they've done it right and I would likely purchase this from time-to-time if I lived w/in the distribution area. Til then will have to convince the sis-in-law to bring me more samples from this brewery."
""
""
"This beer is a nice, clean example of the style and it makes a good choice for those who want a good introductory Vienna lager and are not sure where to start. The taste is not as full and rich as some of the best in its class, but this is still a good example of this style and one worth trying if you happen to find yourself in Virginia and want a nice, fresh, unoffensive craft beer to sample."
""
"Overall it's actually pretty decent but sort of tuned down I think a little too much. THe sweetness comes a little more noticeable as it warms up. It's alright."
"Clean and crisp with a semi-dry finish. Medium to slightly light bodied with medium carbonation. Decently refreshing. Not bad at all but also not particularly exceptional; might be just a touch too sweet for my liking. Easy drinking."
""
"Extremely balanced for a malt-forward beer. Very clean. A real treat to enjoy. And having had only a handful of Vienna lagers before, this one really stands out and I can see why it earned a gold in its category at the World Beer Cup this year."
""
""
""
"Really good. Has a very unique toasty flavor, quite intense. Maltiness is toned back, allowing the toastiness and hops to shine. Awesome."
""
""
""
""
"My first time having this was at the Gloucester, VA Brew Jam. It was mighty tasty in the warm weather. I would definitely session this beer."
"overall - There is a reason this beer took home gold medal at the 2012 beerworldcup. Its a fine tasting beer by any measure."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Finishes dry, moderate carbonation, and thin to medium body. And it's SUPER easy to drink! Defiantly would be a go-to session ale if I could buy it locally (ahem)."
""
""
"D: i actually found this to be a little bit of a miss for me. there is just something missing in both the malt and hop departments. ive had this on draft at the brewpub a few times and i remember it being much better than this. hmmm, not sure if there is substantial difference in the water between the brewpub and production brewery location but that is the only flavor affecting factor i can think of."
"O - Devil's Backbone has made a very good lager here. The Vienna Lager is a classic example of the style and a very drinkable brew. It may not be the best of the style (that honor belongs to Great Lakes' Eliot Ness), but it is one of the better ones. Quite sessionable."
"Another winner from Virginia. Easily recommended."
"Smell is of crisp malt. Taste is slightly fruity, maybe apple, malty but smooth. Slightly heavy and thick, but slightly above average accross the board. Ok brew, not worth seeking out."
"O - Overall, this is a pretty tasty Vienna lager that's super drinkable and great for drinking in numbers. Though the taste is fairly sweet, it's not too overpowering and provides enough Noble hops to create a well rounded flavor. I'm glad this beer is now being distributed in six packs and look forward to picking up some more in the future."
"I'm very impressed by this beer from a new Virginia brewery. At 4.9%, it is highly sessionable, and I will definitely be buying multiple 6 packs of this this summer."

"Pours a clear copper color with a single-finger white head and a ring or two of lacing on the way down. The nose brings some slight notes of bread and caramel and a faint hop presence. The flavor is mostly bread crust and a touch of caramel with light hops toward the finish, providing a nice bitterness. Light body and good carbonation. Another winning lager."
"Overall a nice beer thats easy to drink and tasty enough that a beer love would appreciate this."
"Na'zdravi!"
"Beer is wet and medium to light in body without being watery. Strong malt presence props this beer up nicely. The finish isn't dry or grainy, no apparently acidity just a nice finish. I'd have this beer again."
"Drinkability: superb sessionable beer as this went down quickly and the alcohol level is low. Great flavors make this one a must try while at the brewpub."
"D - Reminds me of an Octoberfest. Easy to quaf but not my favorite combination of flavors but I'm rating it good for the style. I'd rather have a good Pils."
"Do they drink a bunch o' similarly-styled brews in good ol' Osterreich? No matter, this one pours a clear pale amber topped by a finger of quickly-dying white foam. The nose comprises tofee, buttered biscuits, and a dab o' honey. Honestly, this is sweeter than I imagined it would be. The taste is not as sweet, holding notes of light caramel, light honey, rye bread, and a bit o' citrus zest. The body is light, with a light carbonation and a decently smooth feel. Overall, a slightly above average Vienna, nicely drinkable but not much beyond that."
"Poured into a pint glass from a growler. Malty bready aroma. No Hops detected. clear Deep copper. Plenty of head that doesn't stick around. Moderate amount of lacing. Slightly sweet with the bitterness creeping in at the end. Medium to full mouth feel. Overall it is a very enoyable lager. This is the one that stood out for me in the sampler enough to want to take home in a growler."
"On tap at brewery. A great session beer; I echo the other reviews when I say this is one of the best Vienna style beers I have ever tried in USA. Deep ruby color; rich mouthfeel, malty body. I could drink this by the gallon. Too bad it's only avilbe at the brewpub or in to go growlers."
"This is my go to beer when at the brewery, outside of some German offerings, this is hands down the best Vienna Lager I have had produced in the states. The beer is very well made and is consistent every time I go here. I would love seeing this bottled."
"Drinkability: Another solid beer. It's not over the top or mindblowing, but it's definitely sessionable, low in alcohol, crisp and refreshing, and a solid addition to DB's repertoire. Can't wait for the outside seating here to get finished - this seems like a summer/outside on the patio kinda beer."
