"Overall, a good beer to try if you want to sample lagers that aren't made for heavily-advertised mass consumption. Otherwise, not a personal favorite."

"Cloudy amber colored pour with a small off-white head. Great malty aroma with hints of caramel, yeast and toast. Taste follows the nose with caramel and bready malt flavors upfront. Slightly sweet taste that also has a nice cereal grain presence with just a hint of hops. Light to medium bodied and drinks really easy. Very well done beer."

"A very well made lager. I enjoy this more and more with each sip. I love the style, and am glad there is a good readily available Texas option."
"O: fantastic six-pack! I loved it all the way through and a perfect diversion from the hop-crazy landscape out there right now; just enough sweetness for taste but not enough to overpower the good toasted grain notes. i will definitely be drinking this one again."
