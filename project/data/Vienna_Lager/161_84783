3.49,14.4,3.5,3.25,3.5,4,3.5,"Overall- A solid lager with bright citrus flavors and a nice malt backbone of caramel sweetness and toasted grains.  Slight clash in flavors with the citrus and toasted grains, but its a minor flaw.  If this beer was in my neck of the woods I'd gladly buy this on occasion as its a step up from lagers like yuengling and it makes for a nice food pairing beer. (81/100)","CTbrew32","Oct 15, 2014"

2.78,-8.9,3,2.5,3,2.5,2.75,"Pours a medium straw color with a short lived head. Cracker like aroma, some bread and floral as well. In the taste, grainy and malty but fairly clean. Inoffensive and easy drinking at the least, and cleaner than many lagers I've had. The body is medium somewhat heavy for the style. Overall, a decent Vienna lager, not great.","Stinkypuss","0"

The flavor is full of cheap grains reminding me of Busch or Genuine Draft but this is a little better tasting. Very simple and plain as it’s nothing out of the ordinary other than a basic local beer.","Lemke10","Mar 20, 2013"
