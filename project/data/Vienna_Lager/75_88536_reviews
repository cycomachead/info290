"A corona in a larger version with amber bottle that protects the beer, better than usual corona in a transparent bottle."

"Quite delightful."

"Pretty watery and light on any kind of flavor."

"O:  This is a step up from Corona, but that's not saying much.  Not a bad beach beer, but definitely nothing to write hope about."

"I was sitting in a Mexican grocery, eating a tripe and tongue taco and noticed this in the cooler. I figured I would enhance the experience by drinking a ""real"" Mexican beer. No glass to serve it in, I drank it straight from the 32 ounce bottle, hence the higher score in appearance. The nose and flavor is straight rice with a hint of barley graininess. After I poured a little lime juice in it, the flavor did improve but the base beer is poor and weak. It served the purpose as its light character helped to extinguish the habenero spiciness but I wouldn't bother to drink it again."
"Pours a golden yellow in color and is darker than they regular 'Corona Extra' that you see all the time. Has a good 1-finger white head that settles down quickly to just around the sides of the glass. Some spotty lacing is seen but not a lot. The aroma is typical of a Mexican beer with just some grains and hops. Nothing that stands out really. Tastes pretty much like a regular ""Corona Extra' with a higher alcohol content with a sweeter slightly dry finish. Overall all is was OK."

"Overall: Looks and smells like Corona Extra. This beer, however, as a slightly harsher taste than the Extra. This brew is inferior to Corona Extra."

"Overall: pretty darn drinkable. The lack of adjunct off-flavors makes me think this isn't a normal adjunct lager (although, again, it's *definitely* not a Vienna lager). For beers that you buy at the gas station in a quart bottle, it's actually not bad."

"Fine for what it is. Was an adequate beverage to go with that greasy burrito de pollo.."
"There is some debate about the difference between Corona Extra and Familiar so I had to try a bottle. Although it does taste fresher, it does not taste like a Vienna style lager and the brown bottle could impact the flavor. The label did state 6% abv, but according to the local distributor website, Origlio Beverage, Familiar is 4.6% abv, the same as Extra packaged in a larger bottle (http://www.origlio.com/crown.php). Since I am an organic chemist with access to analytical techniques I checked it out in the lab and found it is in fact a little less than 5% abv, not 6% as listed on the bottle and here at BA. Thus it is most likely the same product as Corona Extra. In any case it does taste fresher than Extra but comes at a price higher than I am willing to shell out for a beer of this level of flavor. I will likely never buy it again."

"Overall: Actually, despite the low rating, this is pretty drinkable compared to Corona Extra. It's certainly no worse than any other Adjunct Lager out there."

"My go-to refreshing brew, no lime necessary."
""
"Overall it has a bit more flavor than the Extra. Still works well with some limes which I added on the 2nd half."

"Taste was full of corn and metal, like some cheesy band with a fake scary flyer. I think if you take a regular corona, some mineral water, and a sam adams light, blend them together, you get this beer. I think you can get a little more alcohol taste to it, its better than any other Corona I've ever had, and hey, you don't have to drink as much of it to get a buzz. Lawnmower or memory road stuff at best."
"Overall, this is a good thirst quencher. Yet, I'd choose Bohemia or some other Mexican beer if I'm needed a fast cold one on a hot day."
"O: much better than Corona Extra, brown bottle keeps the skunk out"
""
""
""
"O - Overall, It was alright. Definitely not a vienna lager. But it's better than regular corona by a long shot!"
""
""
""
"I really thought that this was regular Corona in a really cool quart-sized bottle, and I bought it purely for the novelty factor. Turns out that this is like Corona-plus. A more medium bodied and much more flavorful lager. Maybe should be under the Vienna Lager style here on BA?"
""

"I think it might be Corona Extra just stored in the brown bottle changes the taste. Its not bad will have again."
