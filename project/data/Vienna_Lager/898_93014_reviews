"A heavy hitting everyday beer"
"A good beer but nothing jumping out to rate it any higher.  Amber color with a decent head and a good malt flavor."

"Taste like my number rating"

"The body was a step or two on the light side of medium for the style, and had a slightly sweet finish. Drinkability was good, the beer was gone quickly, and I suspect one could slide several of these down in short order. Overall, a solid, if unspectacular, example of the style. Worth trying if you see it."

"Oddly estery, finishes thin and fizzy. Some hard water, Burton-on-Trent feel. Little hop character on either end."

"On tap at Rattle n Hum, NYC. Tons of malt & near perfect sweetness. I getting a touch of banana/peach on the tongue. Not much head or lacing but I really like this & at 5.2% I`m in for the long haul."

"I've never found any big ""treasure"" with Heavy Seas but the booty has been pretty consistent over the years. I like this brewery and the bulk of their lineup is at least respectable and more often pretty damn good. Cutlass, I happen to think, is fantastic. There aren't many truer, better examples of the Vienna style currently brewed stateside."

"O: Not very tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a solid beer to drink for a long time if you’re in the mood for the style."
""
""
"O: Almost as good as EliotNess or Sam Adams. Sessionable. Must try"
""
"Overall: I would love to support this local brewery, but beyond Loose Cannon and maybe Small Craft Warning (Imperial Pils), most beers are underwhelming. The draft versions around town (especially what I have had at OPACY) have all been much, much better than the bottled versions."
"Overall: This is a very, very solid lager. Great session beer, full of flavor, nicely balanced and extremely drinkable. I’ll certainly get this beer again."
"This is a decently well rounded and smooth crowd pleasing type of brew."
""
"Beer of the month club. Pours clear copper with a small quickly receding head. Sweet malt and standard lager aroma. Malt extract with some additional sweetness and a bit of wet dog. Metallic flavor. Medium carbonation and light mouthfeel. Have yet to like any beer from these guys."
"O: This is a pleasant take on a Vienna lager from Heavy Seas. It's definitely no Eliot Ness, and it's not exactly a Boston Lager, but it's still enjoyable."

"O-a nice amber lager. Nice, if understated, flavor."

"Very drinkable brew. Malt character is pleasant. If the estery and metallic notes weren't present, this would score higher."
""
"O: This beer is nice and malty and tastes like a true representation of the style."

"Awesome session beer, reminds me of Boston lager,  very fresh tasting and clean, well made classic 4.25"

"Not bad, easy to drink, lowish alcohol, mostly a non-aggressive sessiony kind of beer that would go with any occasion."
""

"Notes: Very drinkable with such a nice dryness and can be enjoyed anytime of year. Cheers."
""
"Overall - An ok sessionable lager beer, but flavoring is not up to Clipper City's usual standards."
