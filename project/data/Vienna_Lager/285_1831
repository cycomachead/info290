It's very subtle and hard to pick out. The flavour has a bit grain with slight fruit in the finish, maybe apricot. Like the nose the whisky barrel is very subtle.

At first glance, and based on the reading on the bottle “whiskey malt red beer” it makes me think of some American ambers, but this one is way more complex with the whiskey character. I understand the classification “Vienna Lager” but personally would not like it to be placed in that category. A malt whiskey beer, with a Scottish name Nessie, brewed in Austria, makes me think this one is a style in its own right. Reminds me of buying Nacho chips that are a European brand on the train in Sweden, or a Chinese version of western food at a high end restaurant in Toronto. Cool bottle, great concept.","patre_tim","Feb 09, 2013"

There is a distinct sweet aroma, slightly reminiscent of rye/whiskey, bread maybe? I'm not crazy about the flavour: there's a sharp metallic taste that doesn't belong, and unfortunately there aren't really any other flavours potent enough to mask it. There are some bready notes, and the whiskey malt adds some complexity, but there just isn't much here. The finish is very clean, but weaker than I was expecting.

The aroma is nice, but the flavor is very thin, tastes almost watered down. Body is light and uninspiring.

The nose is earthy and grassy at first, but becomes sweet and fruity with hints of caramel and a touch of whiskey. Lots of toasted malt and caramel in the taste along with some nuttiness, grass, vanilla, and a touch of oak. Nice dry but slightly syrupy mouthfeel. Kept waiting to taste some whiskey, but sadly it never appeared. And since the label says it's known as the "Whiskey among the beers", I think it's a pretty epic failure.

3.28,-0.3,4,3.5,3,3,3.5,"It's not really red, but it is a golden color with a slight hint of red. Which is nice enough with what they were going for as it is the color of many a nice whisky. The head is really pretty, tight and fluffy with some heavy lacing. I'm catching a lot of nice floral clean german malt character from the aroma, along with a good bit of honey and a tiny bit of paint thinner alcohol. The smoke is very subdued here but it's nice none the less. All in all the aroma reminds me of a nice enough Maibock, which may or may not have been what they were going for here. The smokiness shows up a lot more in the flavor of this beer and clashes a bit with the herbal bitterness on the sides of the tongue, which is very different from the malty sweetness that dominates the flavor of the beer. Seeing as how this is retired the bottle is at the very least a year old, if memory serves me correctly that sweetness was better balanced with smokiness in it's younger age. There are some chocolate and earthy tones that peek their head out of the water every so often when drinking this as well. The palate seems sharp on the sides of the tongue while almost rich and almost syrupy on the top, not in the way many Barley Wines or Imperial Stouts can get syrupy, but more like in a cheap imitation maple syrup kind of way. This thing is likely not nearly in it's prime but I sort of like where it's going. I might have to pick up a few more bottles just to see what the future has in store for them.","BieresDesMoines","Apr 27, 2010"

3.35,1.8,3.5,3.5,3,3,4,"Surprised to see this beer listed as a Wee Heavy. Doesn't seem to fit the style, but is a nice brew. The Scottish notes are present in the peat-malt aroma and flavor; lightly toasted, pungent, and campfire-ish. The malt sweetness is very powerful and works well with the alcohols, taking on a thinning, sweet, honey-like flavor. Hopped with traditional, earthy, German hops (saaz) contribuiting to the pungent earthy flavors. Never musty or dirty. The pour is a crystal clear, honey colored brew with mild carbonation that disipated in 5 minutes. Lightly carbonated, which adds to the weight of the brew. Very sweet, but dries up very late in the finish with a lingering hop / malt pungent note. Clean for being so sweet. Well balanced, but no real hop flavors or aromas. A nice beer, but unlikely to go out of my way for again. Probably is best characterized as a Scottish Ale, but not a Wee Heavy. Just does not have the molassas malt character or strong peat flavors / aromas; otherwise, the strength and sweetness makes sense.","BEERchitect","May 16, 2007"

After a while, I realize its one of my favorites. The subdued yet somewhat unorthodox mixture of flavors is really a treat. Id imagine that if you crossed a smooth, malty Vienna-style lager with a rich and mildly smokey Scottish ale, this is what you get. Word of warning though: Tasty, yet restrained flavors and an incredibly drinkable smoothness + an extremely well hidden alcohol content = me quickly putting away two bottles of this brew and writing this review with a firm buzz. Highly recommended (the beer, not the buzz).","arguemaniac","Oct 03, 2006"

The nose is mild, with a touch of malt, but this doesn't strike me as any different than any other beer malt. The mouth is pretty light and a bit on the prickly side.

It has a bland and boring pale malt flavor that is strong, but lacking real character. There is also a distinct lack of hops in the taste. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is an average wee heavy. It lacks complexity and drinkability. This is a forgetable brew.","WesWes","Jan 21, 2005"

Aroma is on the sweet malty side, with lots of caramel and a hint of noble, floral hops. Mouthfeel is average, with a light body and medium carbonation. The taste is very nice, though a bit on the sweet malty side of the scale. Munich malt seems to be present, and there is a definite breadiness. Floral hops add a bitterness that compliments the malts quite well. Castle Eggenberg is an excellent brewery, but this effort, though acceptable and tasty, seems out of place. This is not a Red Ale, in any sense of the word, or style. Nevertheless, I enjoyed this and can't wait to find another.

The body is medium-light and it has a moderate carbonation level. The flavor follows the aroma with a rich, floral, sweet, caramel, and  toasted malt backed by a minimal hop bitterness. The balance teeters on the edge of falling towards sweetness... but it never really falls. It's never cloying and it finishes moderately quickly with a semi-dry character, leaving some toasty sweetness. An exceptionally enjoyable and unique beer. Well worth seeking out.","NeroFiddled","Aug 02, 2002"
3.92,19.1,4,4.5,3.5,4,4,"Crystal clear golden use topped by a moderately thick, but persistent white head that leaves intricate lace.  The aroma is comprised of buttery toffee, caramelized fruit melanoidins, vanilla and rich sugar, along w/ a healthy dose of toasty Munich malt.  Smells and looks much more like a helles / Maibock!  Trace floral perfumy Hallertauer Mittelfruh hop nose is perceptible.  Very enticing aromawise.  Although not as deeply flavored as the aroma would suggest, the flavor profile consists of a round caramel sweetness, buttery malt & an expected toasty Munich malt foundation.  Hop bitterness partially offsets malt sweetness, but the overall sweetness is skewed towards sweetness.  The apparent low attenuation leaves plenty of residual dextrins allowing for a full body & mouthfeel.  Finishes w/ brown sugar - like sweetness on the tip of the tongue and quickly fading toastiness.  Seems to be more of a helles bock than a Scottish export... There's a lot of Munich malt character here... Anyway, Nessie is a tasty brew.","marc77","Beers"
