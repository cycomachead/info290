"O-I don't know what it is with Sun King and their lagers, but they are really good. This and the Oktoberfest I was worried about both greatly exceed my expectations."

"A dark lager, thin head. Dark golden brown color. Not cloudy at all,very solid. Decent aroma, nothing potent. It is a little lacking in the taste but makes up for it with a solid showing in the mouthfeel department. Not bad, but not great. Pretty drinkable, pretty decent, good local Indianapolis beer to support."

"The mouthfeel is excellent -- by far the best aspect of the beer. It's almost medium in body with perfect carbonation. The result is a smooth, hearty satisfying feel. Overall a decent beer, but not one of Sun King's best. I fully intend to buy this many times at ""ballpark prices"" this summer, but won't be picking up any more $12 four-packs in the near future."
""
"It pours a light bodied clear and bright copper with a soft and creamy two finger bright white head. The nose consists of pale malt, light Munich malt, slightly candied malt and has a general creaminess, ala their Oktoberfest. The flavors are light and fresh, featuring pale malt with lager yeast and a mild bitterness, on point for the style. It's definitely built for outside, and summer especially. It's light in body and easy to drink, both refreshing and flavorful. This is a nice representation of the style. I like it."
