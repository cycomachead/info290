"Nice taste, refreshing, do it"

"Good on draft, goes well with a meal.  Nothing outstanding, but not bad at all."
""
"Smooth, great taste, one of my favorites"
""
"Bottle.  Started 45 degrees.  Looked pretty good with a decent whitish-tan foam head that hung around a little while.  Not much smell.  Light grain?  Tasted crisp enough, a little on dry side but touch of sweetness.  A small lingering something, wouldn't exactly call it bitterness on tongue.  Mouthfeel seemed light almost watery.  But to be fair, I've been drinking stouts and porters lately.  Overall a good Vienna, but not sure I would choose this over, say, a lighter porter such as Anchor."

""
""
"AT  Good, remains me something sweet or ice cream."
"Boring. Thin body, not much flavor."
"Alright beer, in the ranks of Budweiser to me possibly a step up."
""
""
"Basic Amber.  Nothing special.  Actually drinking it in NOLA."
"Kind of watery with a funky aftertaste."
"Basic amber. Nothing stood out. Not bad. Not good."
""
"On tap at Ardmore Music Hall, Ardmore, PA during the NMO show. Anders Osborne and fresh Abita - nice."
"Pours a really nice color, smells good and just an all around good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Smooth taste. Easy to drink with no lingering aftertaste. A great beer for one or several."
"Would purchase again. Pretty enjoyable."
""
""
"Not an exciting beer.  No real taste and didn't enjoy the beer at all"
"Not much exciting with this one. A predominately bitter taste with slight malt character to mellow it a bit."
"Don't understand why this beer scores so low!  It is a great example of the style and, for a low ABV brew, has great body and flavor."
""
""
"I find brew. Good taste, less filling. Great session beer"
""
"O: Alright. You could buy Yuengling for much cheaper."
""
"O: [3.50] This is a beer you could transition someone from BMC to craft with.  It has a mild lager taste but is slightly more complex than a standard AAL.  It is not fantastic - but it is decent for what it is."
""
""
"Pours clear Amber cola color, smells of bready maltiness and yeast, tastes of bread yeast malt with slight hop overtones, smooth lasting finish."
"First tried this beer while I was in New Orleans.  I love these kind of beers. Although I didn't give it such a high rating, I do have to compare it to other similar style beers. This lager is refreshing and goes down well when it's at its prime temp.  Once it warms up a little, the bitterness really starts to set in. I continue to drink so it can't be all bad."
""
""
"Excellent lager.  Smooth and tasty"
""
"Is it exceptioanlly unique? Well, no. But Abita Amber is an outstanding, refreshing, easy-to-drink beer that you can swig back while enjoying. Those are becoming harder and harder to find. Tastes bready and lacks the awful chemical taste of many macro lagers and ambers. I'd drink it any day. If you are looking for hoppy or complex though - look somewhere else. Cheers!"
""
""
"Draft in NOLA.  Pours amber with white head.  Aroma is of caramel and bready malt.  Body is medium and slightly crisp.  Caramel malt, herbal hops and some grapes fill the mouth.  Finish is medium, semi-dry.  Not bad on tap."
""
"Great beer for sipping with dinner."
"I never bought this beer before simply because I felt there was nothing good about a beer from Louisianna.  I take that back; this is a nice all-around beer.  It goes down smoothly and I must admit I am a fan of German-style beers, and this one fits the bill.  I'll buy it again and will try some of the brewery's other styles."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a beautiful crystal clear amber.  Nice head, fades to a ring.  Spotty visible carbonation adds to the appeal.  The smell could easily lead me to believe I was drinking a German Marzen.  Bready with a touch of caramel sweetness.  The flavor is much the same, although the sweetness ramps up a touch more than the aroma would indicate.  Again, flavors are wonderful.  Feel falls a little flat, but it's clean and refreshing.  I may not even be rating this beer well enough.  Quite a pleasant surprise."

"02/14/13 On tap at Rattle n Hum, NYC. Abita is all over town this week for Fat Tues./Mardi Gras. I find this on the cloying side. Leaves both an aftertaste & 'residue' on the tongue that wears out it's welcome. I guess my expectations of a beer are based on the definition of a good guest; nothing should be left but pleasant memories. This one needs a chaser. No need to ""release the hounds"" but a cool glass of water would be in order."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a light mostly clear amber. A white head burns off quickly leaving just a thin disc in parts. The aroma is light, with nice fruit and biscuit notes. The Taste has nice malt tones, with light fruit and bread showing some nice depth. It has a light weight and a thinner feel."

"Drank this in NOLA draft and it was outstanding.  Drank it again in Gulfport with a couple dozen crawdads.  Beer is an excellent amber color, pours coppery has a good nose and mouth feel.  No backbite, a very good Amber."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Crisp and east to drink. Nice balance between an ""all day"" beer and a ""dinner beer"""
"Nice US take on the Style. It is a refreshing Vienna Lager, all the right flavors are there; it would be perfect if they were more intense, though."
"Pours a pretty amber in color with close to a 1-finger foamy white head that settles down to a thin layer on top. Some spotty lacing is seen. The aroma is very nice and consists of caramel malts and yeast, like freshly baked french bread. The taste is pretty much the same with good malts and the bread flavor. Very smooth and tasty. Goes down very easy with no bitter or harsh aftertaste at all. Medium bodied with perfect carbonation. Really liked this one as well as other brews from them."

"This is the first beer I have tried from Abita other than the over popular Purple Haze. A valiant effort for this amber. Nice head, very creamy and retains satisfactorily. Flavor is of malt and goes away rather quickly. Overall, a nice amber and a job well done !!!"

"2.9/5: A bland lager, sure, but not an irredeemable one"

"The Abita does look nice, I really like the colour. Everything else is just average, except the price."

"This is a well crafted, smooth and simple beer, and there's nothing wrong with that."

""
"Taste / Palate: The flavor has an easy drinking malty character with mild sweetness through out. It matches the aroma with light nutty toasted and bready notes with a touch of light hops for balance."
""
"Pours a golden amber hue with a wispy one finger head and sporadic lacing,the smell is butterscotch,toffee and hints of fruit,the mouthfeel is medium bodied with above moderate carbonation just a little too much for me with tastes of butterscotch and toffee malts and finished with a herbal hop earthiness and overall yeah its alright but pretty pedestrian cheers."

"This is a very nice example of the style. Aroma is lightly toasted malt. No hops or yeast. Color is a beautiful light amber. Sparkly. Medium light body wit moderate carbonation. Taste is grainy rich and malty while staying light and not overly sweet. Finish is a little sweet - should be a little dryer. Refreshing but not boring."

"Amber pours an Amber color with not much head. The aroma is rather weak, but some pale malts come through. The taste is much of the same, pale malt flavors, no hops, and very weak and light flavor. Carbonation is okay, but overall weak flavors. Overall it's pretty boring and average."

"O - solid Amber - drinks like a light beer, but has good flavor."
""
""
""

"Overall: A crisp, clean, delicious lager. There’s something to be said for a straightforward lager. This would be a good go-to beer in bars, if it was widely available on draft in New England."

"Poured this Vienna Lager from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Poured a clear amber color, produced a nice off white head, decent retention and left behind excellent lacing. The aroma consisted of toasted and caramel malt. Medium in body, a foundation of malted grain, hints of caramel and some spicy hops. Overall, very nice example of the style."
""
""
""
"O- Though I normally don't enjoy this style, there's enough flavor to keep me interested and certainly doesn't turn me off.  In a way, it's the perfect flagship beer for a Louisiana brewery since the craft movement still hasn't fully matured there in the way many other states have.  It has a moderately body, a pleasant smell and a solid but unobtrusive taste resulting in high drinkability.  Really not much to argue with here."
"Any craft beer drinker in the New Orleans area knows that if you go to any run of the mill bar, Abita Amber is going to be the one craft beer on tap. It was hard rating this beer because I partly think the taps down on Bourbon street are disgustingly dirty so maybe that is why it doesn't taste that good, but then again I've had this beer from bottles and it still doesn't taste that good to me. I always get it because it is either this or drinking the watered down mainstreams. Each time, however, the story is the same. I take the first sip and I'm like ""wow, this beer is pretty good"". Tastes like any other generic craft beer lager, but as it gets warmer in your hand that's when it starts tasting like dirty feet."

""
""

"Simple lager here, but the flavors are clean and balanced nicely."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Mild, smooth, hint of biscuits and lightly toasted grains. Touch of Euro hops in the finish. A decent example of the style. Otherwise, though, there's not too much going on here. Kind of run of the mill with a very basic malt and hop profile, but drinks easy."

"Taste-Pale malt, caramel note, nice soft mouthfeel, clean finish. A nice, casual lager, sessionable, and a step up from your macro-lagers. a nice 'gateway' brew for those just entering the craft beer scene."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"I can't get over how brilliant this tasted. I had it on tap at a bar because it was cheap and ended up hooked after my first glass. I really hope I can find it back home away from Louisiana."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Pretty mediocre. you get some maltiness but not a lot. It's a cheap beer for a reason and not worth drinking unless it's a very hot day."

""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall, I feel the flavors in this beer are too subdued compared to Boston Lager or Great Lakes Eliot Ness. All of the right components are here but need to be bolder. Nonetheless it is an easy drinking lager and very sessionable."

"Overall, just an average amber for me, somewhat watery and metallic if anything."
""
""
""
""
"Medium bodied, light effervescence overall though a bit of sharpness up front. Finish is fairly clean though a bready/malt note lingers a bit. Nothing to really recommend this this. Sorry."
""
""
"O/D-Another yawner. In terms of a Vienna Lager, Boston Lager blows this one's face off. One bottle is enough for me."
""
""
""
""
""
"A very boring offering from Abita. I thought I was buying an Amber Ale and got a Vienna Lager. Very sessionable and easy drinking. Not bad, just boring."

"12 ounce bottle into pilsener glass, best by 9/30/2012. Pours lightly hazy orange copper color with a small 1 finger fairly dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Small amounts of spotty lacing on the glass, with a bit of carbonation streaming up. Aromas of caramel, toffee, apple, pear, toast, nuttiness, herbal, and floral. Nice aromas with good balance and strength; pretty typical Vienna lager aromas. Taste of caramel, toast, nuttiness, biscuit, pear, pepper, and herbal spiciness. Lingering notes of caramel, toast, nuttiness, biscuit, pepper, and herbal spiciness on the finish for a short bit. Very clean tasting with a good balance of flavors; but it feels a bit watery. Medium carbonation and body; with a very crisp and smooth mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with pretty much no warming present on the finish as expected. Overall this is a good Vienna lager. Some good flavor balance and very smooth to drink. Quite enjoyable and very sessionable."
"Overall it's not bad but doesn't really stand out in my mind as a ""must buy."""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear light brown with a foamy tan head that fades to nothing. No lacing on this one. Smell is pretty mild with some malt/grain and slight caramel aromas. Taste is of toasted malt, caramel, and some mild herbal hops on the finish. There is a slight bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer flavor wise but the smell is lacking in my opinion."
""

""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"O-a perfect beer for LA. Easy to drink with a nice malty sweetness. A very approachable beer. A must when I visit new Orleans!"
""
"very smooth with low carbonation. semi-sweet dark fruits, butterscotch and caramel, with a clean English hop finish. lingering semi sweetness. highly drinkable and delectable. A bit too much dark fruit though (and by a bit i dont mean alot, simply overpowers some of the flavors only a tiny bit but that could be from the age of it) overall very good though."
""
""
""
""
"Overall- It is very light and easy to drink with a nice not too sweet, but sweet roasted flavor. A brew that makes for a decent session beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste follows...a very non-offensive, easy drinking, light abv brew with much more taste than your typical bmc. The slightly caramel flavor, mild spices, and medium carbonation make it quite easy to put several of these back in a hurry on a hot day in New Orleans...or where ever you may reside."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - A decent lager. Disappointing body. What's there is good, but it's not very flavorful. In the very least, it's easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This was my first Abita product, and is one of my favorite beers. It was paired with a muffaletta sandwich at the world-famous Central Grocery in New Orleans. It has a good balance of malty flavor with just a hint of hoppy bitterness. The rich amber color looks great in a glass, and it pours an ideal (in my view) head. It is a full bodied beer that feels velvety-smooth in the mouth and has a clean finish."
""
"This was an ok beer. I’m afraid that Boston Lager may hold a slightly higher rating than this one in my opinion. Regardless, very high quality and true to the style."
""
""
""
"Lovely beer. If this is Vienna lager, then I am a fan of the style."
"Overall a pretty straight forward Amber Lager with a great drinkability and a pleasant taste..."
"Overall-Not a bad amber, good summer time beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very nice brew. Good balance of crisp flavors with the malts and very light bittering at the end. Would def like to try it on tap."
"Pours a copper color with a good head that fades to nice lacing. Mild aroma of roasted malt with some caramel and fruit. Bit of spice and grain. Flavor of caramel sweetness, bit of fruit and spice. Mild bitterness and a clean finish. Fairly medium body, smooth and somewhat creamy. Decent beer, goes down pretty easy and has you asking for another after a bucket of spicey crawdaddies!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"Average head over amber colored beer. Sweet, malt dominated smell. I can't smell any hops. Smooth, sweet caramel taste. Typical for the style. Average mouthfeel, pretty standard carbonation and density. An average beer, nothing special. Probably my favorite offering from Abita though."
""
""
"I CAN remember one industry professional telling me that ""Ambers are dead."" By Gar, I hope not! Ambers take many forms and knowing how difficult it CAN be to work with a lager yeast, I am duly impressed that this is not a red ale. I got a rocky finger of tawny head off of my pour and it hung around as long as it could in the humidity of the evening. Color was a beautiful orangish-amber with NE-quality clarity. Nose was very malty, but also very clean. Mouthfeel was full, nearly thick and the malty sweetness reminded me of hot cereal, oatmeal or cream of wheat. Finish was semi-sweet, sweet, but not cloying by any means. It was very pleasant and would be a nice beer to have in the cooler on a hot day or during a visit to the beach."
"O - Not impressive, but not bad either, a nice easy drinker with a burger or some barbeque."
""
"This is an easy drinking Vienna Lager. It has decent flavor and good body. It's worth a try."
""
""
"O - For what it is, this is a solid choice. I've enjoyed a few of these in the Crescent City, and some local cajun restaurants."
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a easy drinking vienna style lager, not hoppy but full of malt flavor and more complex than you would expect. With so many better options that are just as easy to get and in my opinion much better, I doubt that I would ever return to this one."
""
""
""
"O: Decent beer, goes down pretty easy. Good for a couple."
""
""
"I had been led to believe that Abita beers were better than this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The lacing was the best I had viewed in some time. I would like to do this beer again as I did have a small cold going, but was still very enjoyable."
""
"Poured from tap into pint glass. Pours no head or lacing. Nice slightly fruity malt aroma. Taste is similar with a slightly fruity malt flavor and ever so slight hop. Easy drinker, tastey and refreshing. Seems to be a nola staple and I can see why. Its nice after a hot humid day. Good brew but not amazing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not a bad Vienna, a bit sweeter than I would like but a solid example of the style"
"O: very sessionable. Doesn't have the astringent aftertaste of many Abita styles. One could drink this all day...and they did at the festival; oh man, did they!"
""
""
""
"O-A boring and slightly off-putting beer. I was hoping for more and this was a let down."
""
"O - Abita Amber is a very solid and enjoyable Vienna-style lager. An enjoyable offering!"
"O - Just a little better than your mass produced Viennas. Not really worth another purchase at 9.99 a six pack."
""
""
""
""
"The taste is very good and it goes down extremely smoothly. This is a wonderful Munich style lager and I would highly recommend it to anyone."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A decent Vienna lager. Hops could stand to be more assertive."
""
""
""
""
""
"This stuff is good. I don't know why but it made me think of Negro Modelo and Sam Adams Boston lager, taking the good elements of both. Has a nice amber color (obviously) and a good looking off white head. The malty breadiness are prevalent and its got a clean grassy aftertaste. Worth getting for sure."
"Certainly looks the part. Amber color. Problem is the head dissipates to nothing quickly. Better than average taste. Good mouthfeel and carbonation. Overall, this is a very good representation of a macro-craft beer. I bought it because the on other thing on draft was the terrible OMB copper."

"Overall: very drinkable and refreshing but not overly flavorful. Simple and one dimensional but appeases the standard beer drinker."
""
"D: Easy drinking & reasonably pleasant enough. No major flaws, but quite unimpressive. Not really good as a Munich or a Vienna lager. Alright for washing down some food or as a hot weather thirst solution."
"Overall Drinkability: Like I said, I need to give this one another shot."
""
""
"O: It’s very ehh. It’s kind of like a C- student; it gets the job done, but you wouldn’t want to copy off him when it counts. I wouldn’t break out the first-class hors d’oeuvres to go with this beer, but a small bag of chips will do ya. Cheers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I had this on tap. It had the sort of amber color you'd expect from something called amber. It had a white head and lacing was left on the glass during consumption. There was a light aroma of malt, but not much else. The taste was fairly mellow. There was a malty taste that was dry and crisp. It has a light mouthfeel. Overall, this is an average beer that is still very popular in Louisiana."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"~Overall, great Amber. Only runs you about 7 dollars for 6, or around 13 for 12. A great session bier that goes phenominaly with spicy gumbo and shrimp; really brings out the seafood and vegetable tastes."
"Abita amber pours an appropriate amber and very clear color with minimal head retention. It's pleasant aroma consists of mainly sweet caramel graininess. The flavor follows suit with a mellow, pleasing caramel malt backbone, which is well balanced and not cloying. The body is a touch on the thin side, and the beer finishes pretty clean and dry. Very drinkable, perhaps not as rich and lingering as some Viennas however. I liked it."
""
""
""
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a ale mug. Rich amber color. Quite clear. Head is decent on pour, but dissipates quickly. Not much left on the sides of glass. No bubbles from bottom after pour . Malty, buttery aroma, with some copper notes. Taste is quite sweet and a bit of bitterness from the hops at the end. Very light mouthfeel. Not very carbonated."
""

"Poured from a bottle at Wing Central in U-district. Aroma...well...I can’t really smell any unfortunately. It’s still better than smelling cheap hard alcohol, or skunky main stream lagers, but there’s nothing good about it for sure. Appearance is just as boring. Dark orange to amber with no head to speak of. Hazy. Taste was bland. It’s not a BMC but I don’t think it’s a craft beer either. The only flavor that I think I can pick out is the faintest hint of caramel. Palate might be the acceptable quality of this beer, mainly because it is carbonated and drinkable. Overall not something I would ever plan on picking up again. There’s no flavor to it, and no other redeeming qualities. It’s just a lost cause."

"Tastes light, thin bodied, again no hops, but yet still a pronounced bitterness, metallic, grainy, alcohol seemed pronounced for its actual level, could feel it (or some off flavor) as I exhaled. The sweetness that was lacking in the aroma shows up when drinking. Tastes like a sweeter brown ale. There's nothing terrible about this beer, but nothing to justify its almost $10 a 6er price. Crystal and Vienna malt all the way on this beer."

"This beer pours a clear, orange color with 1/2 inch head and no lace. It's aroma is of bread crust, honey, and grass. The flavor has notes of honey, dough, nuts, and sweet malt. The mouthfeel is light. Abita Amber is a good beer, smooth, refreshing, and very drinkable. A great session beer. Recommended."

"O: This is a decent Vienna lager, but is not all that impressive. Compared to some other takes on this style, Abita Amber offers nothing new or exciting."
""

"Not a bad beer overall. It was either this or Miller Lite on the riverboat and of course I stuck with the Abita Amber. It also felt right drinking this on the Mississippi."

"D - Inoffensive, and perhaps a little bland, but the base flavor is good enough to let most of it's simplicity slide. Overall very enjoyable."
"Not a good example of a Munich lager (as advertised)."
"This beer has potential but it loses me with the finish. Clearly it is a lighter beer and it is good to have on hand if you have friends over who aren't big into craft beers. I'd much rather drink a few Abita Ambers left over from a party vs.something from the majors. I think of it as an entry level craft. OK but not great."
"A well balanced beer that is appealing and easy to drink."
"Overall: I don't know if I'd call this a Vienna Lager, but it's quite pleasant and a decent session beer."
"Nice balance, but nothing stands out."
"In keeping with the Louisiana theme (or, more accurately, drinking with friends who just returned from New Orleans) I can see this being a second or third-tier choice, depending on my options."
"It's a great ""lighter"" beer that you can drink all day in the smoldering LA heat. A nice caramel malt flavor. I've had it both in the bottle and on tap for many years, but this in one that I actually drink straight from the bottle (gasp). Flavorful AND refershing, a great combo!"
"As far as mouthfeel, it felt a bit bready."
"Disappointing, I was hoping for more from an Amber."
"Overall, there are much better Vienna lagers out there to try than this one."
"Mouthfeel is pretty light-bodied with average levels of carbonation. Finishes on the dry side and is fairly drinkable. Overall, nothing impressive here, just an average brew that would be good on a hot day, but not something to seek out."
"Color is amber (duh) with a moderately-sized off-white head that fades fairly quickly, but there are several nice lacing rings down the glass that make for a very nice looking beer. The scent is a very pleasant combination of caramel/bready malt and fruity citrus. The taste follows the nose, with a nice balance of malt and hops - slightly sweet caramel and bread notes up front, with a nice touch of citrus bitterness in the background. This doesn't have the grassy flavor that may other lagers have, which is a positive in my book. Mouthfeel is okay, but not great. I'd be glad to have one of these again."
"Overall: I like this beer as a go to beer, great for BBQs and crawfish boils. It is not a hoppy beer or super malty beer, but a good basic drinker that would appeal to a lot of folks."
"The liquid was a hazy amber/ copper color with a thin filmy white head. The aroma consists of sweet roasted nuts and caramel candy. I could taste mostly sweet malt with toffee and a slight earthy bitterness. It has a light medium body with sharp carbonation and a dry finish. I thought this was a good amber but it is a little on the sweet side."
"Pours a nice typical amber with a small white head. Aroma is sweet malts some yeastyness and frruity notes. Taste is same as aroma. Palate is a medium body with moderate carbonation. Finish is malts with a bit of roastiness, some yeast. Overall flavor and aroma were a bit bland and subdued. There are better lagers"
"It's beers like this that give ambers a bad name - so basic and boring in look, smell and flavor that you might as well be drinking a macro."
"Good beer from Abita...."
"The Rest: Body is medium; this one is just Ok. The dishrag taste on the finish reminds me of a lot of not very good brewpub beer. This one is just meh."
"As I said if you're looking for a dark, heavy amber this isn't for you. I'd almost classiy this as a summer ale."
"Sorry, amber beer family, you’ve taken a step backwards with this one."
"D: in my opinion just a bit too much sweet/darker malt that takes it to a sweet lager versus a malty/balanced vienna."
"Not much here, but it's strong an original microbrew, and it gets a lot of love. When in NOLA, have yourself a damn Abita!"
"Overall not one of the better beers I've had. Just left a lot to be desired. Not a bad beer, but just not enough flavor for me and maybe too much carbonation as well. Just tasted too fizzy."
"OVERALL: The Abita Amber is on the lighter side, but still an interesting beer. If you're in the mood for something light and refreshing, this would be a good call. If you prefer a little more body, however, it might not be the right brew."
"This beer poured out with a pretty nice looking amber color, the head was cream colored and fizzy. The smell had a slight hoppiness with some caramel malts in there. The taste was too mild in my opinion, I couldn't really pin point any real specifics here other than some malts and a minimal hop bitterness. The mouthfeel is on the light side too. Overall not the most impressive Amber Ale really."
"O: I'd be happy drinking an Abita Amber on a hot day, cook out, canoeing or most anything out doors. It's refreshing without being totally void of taste and smell."
"I know Ambers are supposed to have a reddish look and a malty flavor... this was more nutty... and kind of bland, but once again, I like things to bite me.."
"Good flavor for a weak beer. Good porch-sitting or grill-out beer. I would think this beer would do great with BBQ."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass, the beer is a slightly hazy, bright, orange-amber color with a light, foamy, fluffy white head that starts around three inches and quickly disappears into a managable half-inch head. Great lacing just from the head recession. Aroma is a tangy caramel with a slight hopped spice towards the end. Flavor is a little watered down, but a decent blend of caramel and hopped bitterness. The caramel is a little roasted, which balances nicely with green and pepper from the hops. Tasty. The body is light and crisp, and the aftertaste is roasted and slightly sour, with a dry finish. Pretty decent, and a very easy drinker."
"This beer has a nice drinkable feel and goes down easy. There is a nice juicy feel that goes down easy."
"Crisp and clean, simple but well-made. Nothing too exciting, but certainly good."
"Great to have another Vienna out there. This one is worth your while."
"Mouthfeel gains some ground but can't possibly overcome the shortage of flavor. Medium bodied with a sizzle of carbonation gives this beer an almost chewy feel. Not bad and very drinkable but shocking that the nose is so different from the taste"
"D- Very refreshing beer with great flavor and great balance between the sweet caramel malt, spicy notes, and mild hop bitterness. Could be a go-to session beer of mine, but I have never seen it in six packs around here."
"I didn't realize this was a lager until now when I tasted it and saw it's classification, you learn something new everyday."
"Drink- It's okay as I mentioned, a little watery and sweet. Probably won't have this again."
"Overall this was a good local beer in Louisiana. I wouldn't mind having another one, but I wouldn't rush back for another."
"This is a very easy-drinking, minimal but delicious brew which could pair wonderfully with warm days and so many different styles of food. It pours a brilliant orange with a quickly disappearing white head and smells of orange blossom honey, caramel and walnuts. The palate is clean, crisp and minimal- light bodied with light caramel notes and a general freshness from the hops, which lead to a shorter but still tasty finish."
"Poured into a pint glass this brew has a standard amber color for the style, semi translucent in the light with a 1 finger white head. The aroma was strong of bread and malts. The flavor was mild and had a nice balance of hop spice and malt. Medium body, moderate carbonation. Nothing special but certainly better than the normal big box brews you get to chose from at a wedding."
"D. No mistake about it - this is a sessionable beer that would be best drunk in the summer given its lightness and low alcohol."
"Light amber in color, a good looking beer with nice lacing and high carbonation. Smells of belgian yeast and some caramel sweetness. Taste is the same with a slight bite and the end. Mouthfeel is light and drikablity is moderate. Decent beer, not great but ok."
"D: The beer is drinkable, but nothing really sets it apart to make me want to have another of these."
"D: Yeah, it is drinkable, but it doesn't make me want to find it again."
"D: Probably won't try this one again. I bought mainly because I wanted to try something different."
"If you can get past no taste, you can actually have at this all day. It's relatively low in alcohol and has a neutral taste."
"Amber in color with a creamy head that has good retention and leaves sheets of lace on the glass. Caramel aroma and little else. The aroma more taps you on the shoulder than slaps you in the face. Caramel flavored without being too caramelly. A hint of spiciness. It's a good beer, not overly interesting but good none the less. Smooth yet thin mouthfeel. This is a good session beer, cross over beer, or something to turn to when you're bored with SA Boston Lager."
"Conclusion: for a beer that is readily available, this was fairly solid. I would put this into the same category as Sam Adams. I would even go as far as to say it was better than a Boston Lager. This would make a good, ""go to"" beer if I was faced with a limited selection at a store or bar."
"Drinkability - This is a solid brew. Nothing too complicated or exotic. This is a working mans beer in my opinion. Would be an excellent Fall session beer. Could easily set a few of these back without even thinking about it. Goes down easy and without fuss."
"Drinkabbility: Very drinkable and sessionable. While it's not an outstanding in flavor beer - it is very well balanced to the point that it goes fast and is just good enough that you don't mind having another. It's mild flavor profile makes it go very well with a lot of foods, I think. I think it would be outstanding with BBQ, burgers, and a variety of meaty dishes."
"Poured a clear amber with a nice two fingered off white head with some light lacing. Light malty aromas with a just hint of hops. Crisp and neat on the palate with just touch of hoppy bitterness. This was for the most part a desent enough of a brew from the folks at Abita."
"A nice chalky finish caps of a a smooth medium bodied beer. I'm drinking this one on a full stomach and it's still going down nicely."
"12 ounce stubby bottle. Abita bills this as an amber but it pours a little more gold in color. Pretty decent head with a nice amount of foam. Smell is slightly skunky with an unmistakable lager smell. Beyond the skunk smell there's a decent amount of caramel and cereal in the nose with some mineral notes as well. Light mouthfeel, a little heavy handed in the carbonation. Wish there was more to the body of this beer. It just doesn't really stand up, and seems like it's missing ... something. The caramel taste comes rolling in but washes to the sides of the palate and is chased by water. I get that Abita is proud of their water, I'm just not sure if showcasing it in your beer is the way to go."
"It has a light amber colour and a head that dies very quickly and no lacing. The smell is weak and all I got was some yeast and hops. This beer starts out malty with hints of apple and some hops. Quite nice. It has some carbonation and so is reasonably ok in the mouthfeel department."
"Good drinkability in this one, easily a session beer."
"This ale rates a 12 on the SRM beer color chart, with a less than one finger head after pour, which fizzled down to a thin ring of lace in less than thirty seconds. My nose detects an aroma of roasted corn, wheat, and sweet malt. Nothing extra about the taste, but not a bad blend of flavor. Taste of sour dough bread, yeast, corn and sweet malt. Little to no bite in the initial taste or finish. Feels sort of watery in my mouth, but I do detect a little fizz buzz. This is a beer that is hard to find unless your are in the brewing area (Louisiana), and it is a little pricey compared to similar ale. I am glad I had the chance to sample one, but I would not go out of my way to have another."
"EDIT: Since this review was posted, BA has changed the style of this beer on their site to a Vienna Lager. My new score indicates this change."
"Pours a clear light golden/orange color. Nice fluffy very slightly off-white head. Nice scattered carbonation. Smell is of mildly pungent malt and hops. First taste is light and airy, then a nice and big malt presence sits down on the bottom - it just kind of sneaks up on me, like a ninja. Very tasty and clean, definitely on the malty side. Nice, I like it - good session beer and would pair well with food."
"Its a decent brew. The flavors are pleasant and mellow. It's pretty standard and doesn't stand out but is still drinkable and refreshing."
"A decent example for this style. Abita is usually hit or miss but this beer is just right."
"O: surprised to find I liked this Abita so much, mainly due to the very flavorful version of this oft boring style."
"This is a solid Maerzen style lager, it may not be called an oktoberfest but it does fall in line with the style"
"Drinkability is relatively high. The beer is easily sessionable at 4.5% ABV, and the flavor profile is simple but pleasing. I enjoy simple and clean beers more and more each day."
"This beer has a very nice color with a small and creamy head. I find the aroma underwhelming and am surprised to pick up more of a bright and lively smell than I anticipated for an amber. I don't feel much carbonation and the beer goes down very easily. The taste is unoffensive and has little to no hoppy characteristics that I can pick up on. An easy-drinking amber that can be enjoyed year round."
"D: I find this good, but for an amber or Oktoberfest, ehh not so much. wouldn't turn down, but again wouldn't seek out."
"I love cheap singles. We need more of them at more stores, I tells ya! This one pours a clear, well, amber (how very appropriate) topped by a finger or so of white micro-foam. The nose is heavy on the buttery biscuits, as though company was expected; some light caramel and nutmeg finish off a strange olfactory experience. The taste also has a good amount of biscuits, but they're not as buttery as before. Some mild wheat, light caramel, and, following the theme, very mild hoppy floral and citrus notes round out the kinda lackluster flavor. The body is pretty light, with a light carbonation and a semi-crisp finish. Overall, an okay brew, nothing special, nothing objectionable. Easy to down, though."
"Abita Amber Ale had a real classic beer look to it. It was a very clean, clear brown with just a hint of redness. The head is mostly white and leaves little to no lacing on the glass. I don't have much experience with amber style beers so the the nose is fairly new to me. The nose follows right on the palate. I definitely get a malty sweetness. Maybe that sweetness is a little bit of wheat. I barely get that bready grit feeling on the back of my tongue on the second sip. The finish is short, leaving just enough sweetness in my mouth to want to try another sip. Overall it's nothing to get too excited about but still a pleasant, easy drinking beer."
"MF & D - Not much going on here. Light and rather crisp. Again, nothing special here."
"Drinkability: A pretty average beer overall, and not something I would be getting too excited over. Not bad, but still far from great."
"D- pretty drinkable. Flavors aren't huge. Pretty mild and uneventful"
"Drinkability- pretty good, I would drink it again. Abita made a pretty good solid one wiith their Amber."
"A solid bottle-drinking beer. Great for hot weather despite being a little darker. A good gateway beer for people trying to ""get into"" craft beer. FFO Brooklyn Lager, Sam Adams Lager, Long Trail Ale, Otter Creek Copper Ale, etc."
"Abita makes some delicious brews and this is definitely one of them. Poured a nice dark amber color with a nice head that lasted a few minutes. Smell was nice and clean with some hints of hops and grains. First taste was crisp and clean, I really noticed the grain taste in this beer, normally I'm not a grain kind of guy, sometimes reminds me of crappy beers but I really enjoy it in this beer. Finish was also full of grain for me with a little hop and a hint of caramel type flavor. Really enjoyed this one. This is my first review! Hope I did this beer justice."
"I like this beer. Poured with a nice off white head and a little lace. Color is a clear medium amber. Aroma is malty caramel toffee and a bit of fruit. Flavor is where this stands out- not outstanding but very serviceable. Lots of slightly roasty dryish malt with a bit of caramel and toffee. Not too sweet. Good body and carbonation. Finish is like flavor and tapers off in a short to medium lenght. Easy drinking session beer."
"Overall a nice light marzen with a supeusingly dry finish."
"A very good amber that's pretty much like a very tasty version of a Bud, but much better. A good beer session beer that I could drink all night."
"Very pleased with this beer and would probably go for it again. It's pretty light and I would personally like a bit more body, but it is very drinkable. A good year round Marzen (one of the few)."
"Notes: Honestly, I was hoping for an amber ale as I popped this top. But then I saw that it is classified as a Marzen/Oktoberfest. Also, I had this beer a bit earlier in the week and noted some metallic off-flavors."
"D - While this isn't the best beer out there it's a good session beer I drank a number of these while grillin with some friends it won't blow you away but it's worth a try"
"D: Very inoffensive middle-of-the-road brew. The flagship beer of Abita and one that will appeal to all, but be the favorite of none. Still a big step up from the BMC's. Can generally be purchased very fresh and cheap in Louisiana. It's okay, but I'm not going out of my way to purchase. I'd rather get something more interesting."
"D - Well, this beer is certainly easy to drink, mostly from it's quite subdued flavor. Still, it's certainly refreshing and pleasant to imbibe. It just doesn't pack the same ""Oktoberfest"" feeling as other more developed Märzens."
"D- A well made amber ale that drinks just fine. Boring though..."
"D - More please! Really one of the best Märzen's I ever had and more affordable than the others as well!"
"It pours a really light straw yellow color with some foam. The best part is that you can really taste the spring water in it."
"D-not a bad beer. Fairly straighforward. I would drink this beer again if had limited choices."
"D: A very drinkable beer. Nothing outstanding here, just a really solid brew from one of my favorite breweries."
"Taste is really crisp and smooth with a nice malty backbone and some light noble hops. Really tasty beer, not like most Oktoberfest but very tasty!"
"A good session brew, easy to drink. I could do several of these in a session, and have in the past. A good solid offering from Abita, and an excellent gateway beer for your average BMC drinker."
"D: Could be a bit more balanced, but still easy to drink."
"Now, this isn't to say that this beer is bad. It's not. Abita is a damn solid brewer and wouldn't release crap. It's just, kinda there. There's some fruitiness in the aroma and flavor. A teeny weeny bit of bready beeriness. But that's it. It's not bland, it's not flavorful, it just is."
"This beer has clear reddish brown color with an off-white head which did not setup very thick. The beer lacks a very distinct aroma. I may have had a slightly under-carbonated bottle which could explain the weak head and lack of aroma. The flavor was also fairly bland with a forward malty sweetness and a mild hop finish. The beer is fairly smooth and easy to drink, but it lacks much of a distinct flavor."
"A good beer, worth a shot more often than just when New Orleans is doing something significant."
"Overall, not a bad representation of the style, but also not my favorite."
"Orange amber with blonde highlights and a pillowy eggshell head of foam that melts slowly forming soft peaks. Toasted caramel and chocolate with a touch of something off, like dishwater maybe? I can't put my finger on it. This beer tastes better than it smells for sure. Toasted pale malt and caramel with mild, minty hop notes. Medium light bodied with seltzery carbonation. An average to above average domestic Oktoberfest, not bad beer but fairly ordinary."
" ~ This is a unique amber brew. That being said I have to admit it is also one of the better ambers I've had. I think Abita has a solid foundation down in Louisiana. Especially since this brew seems to be one of the brewery's staples. (My thanks go out to Drizzam for sharing.)"
"Very drinkable, nice brew."
"well done and easy to drink ,nothing crazy going on here just simple and refreshing beer..cheers..."
"RJT"
"This might be o.k. on a scorching day where there is no other craft substitute."
"Thin bodied, an odd sweetness up front followed by a clean finish with no aftertaste. There really isn't much of a flavor overall. Overall, its kind of a boring marzen but a decent effort. A lot of marzens are unremarkable but this one is slightly above average. Drinkability is good."
"Similar in character to other Festbiers but lighter and easily quaffable compared to its richer cousins. Another 'Craft Lite' from Abita; nicely done and easy on the palate without being too challenging either."
"D - A very drinkable offering from Abita."
"Overall, I'd suggest this for you to try, but not to go crazy over. Cheers."
"Drinkability: Not a terrible beer, but it was rather forgettable."
"I think it's pretty nifty that Abita chose a Maerzen as a flagship. Hooray beer."
"Notes: This brew still holds its ground as a classic among the many ""micro brews", a down right tasty lager."
"Pretty drinkable. With the ABV it could be sessionable. However, there are better examples of the style out there. Still a good beer."
"great drinkability. this is usually my go to beer down here in new orleans, as i do prefer to drink local."
"D - Very easy drinking...flavors are subdued and blend together nicely. Good easy drinking beer for cool fall days...a fall lawnmower beer."
"Is this properly classed as a marzen? The strenght is a bit low so I wonder if this should really be classed simply as a vienna."
"Pours a clear, red color. 1/3 inch head of a white color. Great retention and decent lacing. Smells of pale malt, sweet malt, and yeast. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of pale malt, slight sweet malt, and yeast. Overall, easy drinking, but not much else."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has an amber color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, some sweetness. Taste is a bit hoppy, more than usual for a marzen. Feels light in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall this is a pretty ordinary brew."
"D- When I read that this was Abita's flagship brew, I expected something extremely common and boring. This beer somewhat exceeded my expectations"
"Easy to drink but to be honest a little dry and bready, leaves with a near cottonmouth finish and a slight alcohol burn, very slight"
"D) An alright beer. The aroma throws it off just a little bit - like smelling baby food applesauce and then drinking soda water - just weird."
"Mouth is nicely carbonated and incredibly smooth but I think it works against this beer. Sometimes smoothness isn't the best. Drinks easy and I could really slam a few down on a warm day. Not bad but I would be streaching to reach for it again."
"Although for the style, I'm not exactly sure how it fits into that particular style. Seems a bit off for that."
"D: ehh, average. not horrible but nothing to seek out. Part of an Abita mix pack (Turbodog, Pecan, Purple Haze, Jockimo) definitely one of the weaker beers in the pack."
"Pours a clear orange/tan with a medium tan head. Smells of ripe fruit, and a hint of sulfur. Taste is light, biscuity malt, a hint of earthy hops in the finish. Low bitterness levels. Leaves very little aftertaste. Mouthfeel is watery and thin, carbonation levels are average. Drinkability is pretty good, this is a very easy drinking beer that appeals to the masses. That said, it isn't particularly flavorful, but its an OK beer for after mowing the lawn or something."
"D: Beer-y recollections aside, this didn't have anything close to the 'magic' I'd hoped for. In the relative wasteland that is 'craft beer' in the South, I suppose this still holds up, but it's nowhere near as good as several dozen others of the style I've had in recent years. Good to try again as a reminder of how far my palate has come, and still easy enough to drink. Session-worthy strength."
"Drinking this one right now. Poured a deep copper with caramel head that faded quickly and left little lacing. Smelled of malts and a tiny bit of hops. Tastes malty, fruity and nutty. Pretty smooth. Could drink a few, but I used to really like this beer and now it's just kind of eh..."
"This is the most watery beer I have ever had. I would rather drink Budweiser."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: The beer has a light body with light carbonation. This is a beer I could throw back several of in an evening."
"drinkability- not bad, but i won't be buying more. Didn't really taste like an amber, good to see its classified as an octoberfest, makes more sense now."
"D - This beer is more boring than it is bad. I could drink a couple but wouldn't really enjoy any of them."
"Overall, this is a really nice, drinkable Marzen and the my favorite Abita so far. I could easily have a few of these."
"Toasty, nutty malts are about all I can find here with a slight palate scrubbing of carbonation and mild hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is definitely on the thin side and the beer tastes a bit watery. I typically enjoy most of Abita's offerings, but this one does not do much for me."
"Drinkability: This is drinkable with lunch or to have a second one during a post-lunch chat, but I'll not be going out of my way to find this beer again."
"Had this at Blarney's in Philly. Poured a dark amber brown with a light, off-white head. Smell was bready and malty. Taste was light for my liking, though some good malty notes, very earthy. Smooth mouthfeel with light carbonation. Not bad at all, just nothing too interesting about it, taste of a good session beer."
"This just isn't a very flavorful beer. Totally bland. It's really hard to even try to enjoy this. It seems that the best beverage Abita produces is their Root Beer."
"Really this is a basic beer that's not done all that well. The flaws really come out and shine when the flavors are so muted. I could drink this beer again, but I'd never purchase it for myself."
"I'll never drink this again. What astounds me are the claims they make on the label saying ""quality before quantity"" and that they ""don't use additives or preservatives. Each batch is handcrafted..."" Maybe those hands weren't properly washed beforehand."
"I would play beer pong with this stuff."
"D- Easy to throw these back. However, the metallic taste can be bothersome and takes away from it."
"drinkability is up there. it's malty and amber yet clean and refined."
"D 3.0 - I dig Abita, good memories and always have decent brews. They are not the best, but always usually good! However this beer is not one of my faves from their offerings."
"Drinkability: As an american amber, I believe I would score this a C+, as a marzen, there are so much better. The flavor is faint at best. I will not be looking for this again."
"Nikki"
"D: if you can get past the peppery aftertaste, this beer is drinkable. When I drink this beer, I find it easiest to get used to the taste by only drinking this beer for the night. The second beer should be enough."
"Color is nice amber, not a pleasing smell compared to the Turbodog. The taste is very clean, possibly owing to the spring water mentioned on the cap. Could drink a few of these."
"Mouthfeel was medium to light in body. Low to moderate carbonation. Easy to drink, a nice lager."
"Easy to drink, a fine alternative to BMC products for drinkers new to the craft scene...This is basically the beer I rely on when I get dragged out to a bar in NO that doesn't have much in the way of beer but is bound to have something by Abita because its local. Other than that I don't feel the need to go out and pick this up, but not a bad beer otherwise."
"To me, this is a nice well-rounded quaff. Nice atmosphere, with a distinctive nose. Simple, but quality flavor. Does leave a little to be desired in the feel, but not a major drag. Light, and refreshing makes for good drinkability. Very nice quaff."
"Nicely drinkable, perfectly balanced and a fine representation of the style, which is quite a nice accomplishment for a year-round brew. Thanks to Abita, it's Oktoberfest all year long."
"Highly recommended beer, would love to have it again. Got to be up there as one of the best lagers."
"You can find this an draft all over New Orleans. It is a richly amber colored beer without a a lot of hops, but a very nice malty smell and taste. It doesn't go down as easily as the American standard stuff, but requires a relaxed drinking pace of which I am a fan."
"Cheers..."
"Drinkability is good, would like to try it fresh on tap."
"D - This is an okay brew. Nothing too fabulous but drinkable."
"D- An ok beer, but not one I'm going to reach for to satisfy my Oktoberfest need. I originally bought it thinking it was an amber ale and I it was the best thing I could find to satisfy my brown ale need- but in the end I can deal with this."
"D - I guess this one is a ""sessionable"" beer, but to me this one leaves a lot to be desired, a weak and watery beer in my opinion, but still better than a macro, given the option of quenching my thirst, I would choose this"
"My expectations where not met."
"The aroma is toasted malt, hay, paper, and chocolate. The appearance is amber as advertised and the head is small but foamy. The flavor is toasted malt, nuts, a little salt, and a sour taste that is hard to define. The palate is watery. Overall it's drinkable but that's about it."
"Mouthfeel: Kinda thin, but it's appropriate for the light refreshing flavor."
"Notes from and tasted on 9/11/07"
"Pours an amber brown color body, clear. Big foamy nearly white head, good lacing, but quickly diminishing. Strong malty sweet aroma, some birch or something. A little licorice on the back. Roasty malty flavor, sweet middle taste. Clean somewhat dry hoppy aftertaste. A hint of some licorice sweetness. Medium body, fizzy. A little bit on the malty side for me."
"taste is a bit harsh to be exact.I think its too carbonated.it is, thats really is dominating this beer."
"Edited: 3/24/11"
"Pours a dark amber / orange with dense off-white head, clingy lacing. Smell: caramel, toasted malt, quite restrained. Taste: pale malt, a little caramel flavor, predominant toasted flavor, slight earthy hop in the background. A little thin in taste and mouthfeel, but drinkable and nonoffensive."
"I'm not going to lie either... this one gets higher than usual ratings due to some sentimentality..."
"This beer pours a copper color. I guess the brewer thinks I am too stupid to know what amber looks like. The head is half an inch in height, and recedes within seconds into nothing. The aroma is of malty vomit. The taste is like the aroma. The mouthfeel is light bodied, and over carbonated. Overall, this is a horrible beer, that I will never drink again."
"A fairly run of the mill oktoberfest. Not a bad choice to pick up of you see it."
"Mouthfeel is ok. Slightly watery but very smooth. Overall, not a terribly complex brew, but very solid and drinkable."
"Well abita has done it again with another solid session beer. Pours a nice looking amber color with a good ammount of pleasing carbonation, the small head disappears quite quickly. There is a pleasing aroma with it as well i just don't know how to describe it. Its a nice smooth malty brew you can enjoy all night. A very solid offering in my opinion."
"The beer pours a clear, moderately carbonated, amber color with a whitish head that doesn't hang on that long. The aroma is caramel, floral, maybe a touch musty. The taste is pleasant, easily drinkable, and fairly simple and uncomplicated. There is a chewiness to the beer in the finish, and as the beer settles in, it becomes less sweetish malty. A nice beer, I just don't agree with how BA labels this beer."
"D: Very drinkable really. Light body doesn't slow you down. Decent beer just not real special."
"All in all, an extremely easy to drink, pretty decent session beer, which pairs well with most foods. (As a matter of fact, this has been my go-to session beer since i can remember)"
"D: I'm very indifferent about this beer. It just did not a have a whole lot of taste but there was nothing objectionable about it either."
"Almost like a Marzen Light... not in a bad way. Very drinkable, could satisfy a lot of different palates."
"D: A nice session beer. Not particularly complex, but pretty good."
"Very good brew. Easy crossover for the inquisitive palates. Very smooth and one of the better marzens I've had in awhile."
"I find it to be well balanced and quite enjoyable to quaff. This is an easy drinker and a very good one for introducing macro-swillers to the world of craft brews."
"Good mouthfeel with an even better level of drinkability... Not bad at all..."
"Colour, well, amber of course. The smell was that of graham, iron and evenly-balanced malts. The taste was fine, definitely typical for what they refer to on the label as an amber lager, but lacked a mid-palate as well as a finish for my taste. Overall, the beer was extremely drinkable, especially to quench ones thirst, but with a few components lacking to name it an incredible brew."
"D: Pretty drinkable. Thin enough not to weigh on you too much and has a good taste and smell complexity for an everyday type of beer. This beer is what it is and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that."
"next to no head, crystal clear amber. I actually like how this smells, sweet malts, caramel, some metallic. reasonable color. Very watery and malty, nice malts, actually. Not as dusty tasting as some. decent hop character. Only problem I have is that it is very watery and uneventful."
"I enjoyed this bottle and would have another."
"Very straightforward-- not very challenging, requires little commitment and offers much in return. Nice medium-dark amber color with a light head that disappears quickly. Some fruitiness in the aroma, but mostly a nice light malty smell with a bit of bitterness. Same in the taste. Relatively low alcohol and light in the fizz. Great for a hot day."
"D - A nice easy drinking lager. Simple and straightforward easy drinker."
"http://jbojangles.blogspot.com/2008/05/twelve-pack-review-abita-party-pack.html"
"The Abita Amber has a dark amber (obviously) appearance with a light golden head. There is not much of a smell to it, mainly a hint of malts. It tastes a lot like wheat bread with a subtle honey flavor. The mouthfeel is clean with low acidity. This is a highly drinkable beer. I typically have it as my standby because its flavor is so subtle and most guests think it goes down easy. It goes very well with almost any meal from hamburgers to salad to fish."
"So I was unaware this beer is considered a Marzen. If that is the case they better stick to American style because this taste no where close to a good German Oktoberfest. Served it chilled in a pub glass. Poured close to a Marzen color, red hued, clear, bubbley, nothing really special. Smell....well it just wasn't there. Still searching for the caramel slightly hopped aroma of a good Maren and alas, nothing. Taste faint, still struggling with the ingredients here. Thin, barely malty, minute hops. Alright, where is my Hacker Pschorr??"
"The flavor is full and still tastes great and slightly warmer temperatures."
"Smell is malty with caramel notes and a tart sweetness. Pours to a light amber with a foamy off-white head. Taste is very light with sweet caramel malt flavor and a very slight bitterness only in the background. Carbonation seems high, but is needed to give this brew some substance. This brew is so light it's almost watery. I expected more. However, this would have to be a great and most flavorful lawnmower beer. Highly drinkable."
"Pours a darker amber color, white head dissipates quickly. It has a strange aroma, not sure how to describe it, but its malty. Flavor is bread like, almost toasty malts. No significant hop flavors. Medium mouthfeel. This would make a nice session beer, good flavor but nothing too exciting."
"The kind of bottle that should be served to the patron who goes to the bar and says ""I'll have a beer."""
"Enjoy this beer with some raw oysters and peeled shrimp!!"
"D - This is a below average amber ale that suffers from lack of character or real flavors. Not all bad...could be a good amber ale for a macro-lover."
"After having this several times, I have changed my tune on this. This is a very simple, but enjoyable session beer. I wish more lagers were like this."
"This brew pours a burnt-orange amber, and clearer than other Abita labels, producing a rich slightly off-white head with decent retention. The foam leaves moderate rings as I sip this down. The aroma is moderate and of warm sweet malt - no noticeable hop aroma. This brew is medium bodied and enters the palate with roasted maltyness, progressing to a bit of sweetness and bread-like toast notes. There's something a bit off towards the end of the flavor profile, somewhat sharp and metallic in flavor. Bitterness is present and meets the residual malt sweetness, but seems to be more from the roasted malt than hops. Finishes clean and dry though. This brew is definately palatable but I don't think I'll go out of my way to get any more. Not bad...worth a try anyway. Strangely enough though, I think this beer shows more characteristics of a Marzen/Octoberfest brew than does the Abita Fallfest."
"Amber color with one finger head which dissipates to thin film leaving decent amount of lacing. Not much of an aroma, seemed fresh enough. The taste reminded me of apple juice more than anything and I couldn't really pick up any malt flavor. I don't know if the marketing hooked me with the ""distilled Artesian water"" line on the bottle but the texture was very silky smooth, very refreshing. Due to this the drinkability was good but just a little fruit juicy for me. Just not my cup o' beer so I doubt I will purchase it again."
" This was good on an unseasonably cold winter night in Seattle so I could only imagine what it's like on a hot Louisiana day."
"This is not terrible, but is just kind of off somehow."
"Honey colored pour. SLight haze with a creamy offwhite head. Some skunky malt smell. Taste was a bit lemony, light, sweet and creamy malt. Surely better when fresher than what my bottle was, but still not too bad. SStill, not a repeat buy for me, however."
"Appears a pale copper amber, with a large egg shell tinted white head forms fizzy thick head that rises above the glass and then quickly fades away to form bands of scattered lacing with each sip. Aroma slightly metallic with mild faint caramel and nut notes mild flowing sweetness and a kiss of herbal hops. Flavor is light with specialty grains just slipping through the fizzy beer flavor, but it works with a mild caramel, nut, and slightly creamy edge with faint hops arising with each sip. Mouthfeel is light bodied as it gets in the craft realm but a nutty dryness does stay on the palate with carbonation tickling the throat. Drinkability is sessionable but damn I want more flavor at this level in the game. I still give props to these Abita beers being early on influences in beers exploitation of myself."
"D: A decent session beer"
"Overall, a pretty drinkable beer. Not overly complex or the greatest thing ever, but certainly solid."
"The smell is hops but a very mild version. Honey in there as well. Not bad but not good, really. The taste is decent but somehow a bit too standard American beer-like. Sort of tastes like a macro that's had a makeover. The mouthfeel is spot-on, though. It has nice body, and a great carbonation balance. The drinkability is mixed. The mouthfeel says ""yes"" but the macro hop aftertaste says ""no"". Basically, this beer falls into my ""good standby at a place with lousy selection"" category. Like Shiner Bock, I'll drink it at a party but probably won't buy it for the house. I much prefer their turbo dog."
"Once it hits your lips its smooth sailing."
"D- This is a great beer that has a great taste. I definetly recomend a 6 pack of this. If you like amber beers this might be one to try."
"Poured a golden orange color with a sweet caramel nose and some citrus. The nose had a light citrus hopping to it with some light caramel. The initial flavor was malty and a tad thin, with a watery lemon/citrus juice flavor that was sharp and pronounced in the beginning. Has a lemony flavor that faded subtly in the finish and ended with a lemon tang. Overall a decent amber with a nice maltiness and drinkability."
"Although i wouldnt seek this one out again if it were in my fridge during the summer it would make an adequate lawnmower beer in the arizona heat as it is thin and light with very mild flavors. sort of refreshing in a sense."
"D: A mediocre beer, IMO, but better than a macro, I'd take this over a Bud any day, but nothing really making want to buy this again, though it's light character makes it easy to drink as a refresher, might try this again in the summertime."
"Pours a clear amber with a crème head. Nose is like a pile of wet grass from yesterday that I let sit out on the front yard since then. Nasty. Over time calms down to a mere wet grass stink, but still... Flavor seems to be heavily influenced by a straw character. Feel is decent at best. Nice level of carbonation and a good liquid feel, but the flavor just kills any possibility of a positive experience here. Overall just a weak beer. Nothing at all good about it from my point of view. Avoid."
"that style profile. A nice easy drinking brew."
"This beer pours a clear dark gold - amber with a fizzy white head that holds decently reducing to a thin film leaving slight traces of lace. The smell is mild with touches of toasted and caramel malts. The taste is pleasant with much of the same characteristics as the smell. There is a malty sweetness, but not too sweet, as it is kept in check by mild bitterness. Munich, toasted and caramel malts dominate with a slight adjuct flavor that I can't quite pin down but seems a bit off. The moutfeel is light-medium and a bit slick, not too dry. Overall, a drinkable beer. Nothing mind blowing but it is thirst quenching and satisfying when you are looking for something malty."
"Nice pale copper color. Big head as a result of an aggresive pour. Thin random lacing... not much. Not a lot of retention either. Toasted malt smell. Not much else in the nose. Smooth biscuity malt taste. A good classic Munich lager. Go southern brews!"
"Pours a nice amber orange color with a generous head of white with nice lacing, pretty long lasting too. The aroma lacks in volume or character, a bland toasty malt, lackluster. The taste is slightly better, more character out of the malts, more flavor, the caramels and toastiness more developed and appealing. The mouth is about right, body is medium, carbonation medium, the ending is short and sweet, literally, a bit of a bite toward the back of the tongue. In all, not a bad beer, and as it warmed finally took the shape of the marzen its labeled to be (I'd still call it an amber, whatever it may actually be), and is an easily drank beer."
"d - easily drinkable and a nice session beer."
"Drinkability: Not very impressive. I didn't enjoy this one at all."
"D-Biggest complaint is the mouthfeel....just not enough substance...aroma is decent enough...but overall this doesn't impress."
"Drinkability: Abita Amber is one of my favorites and is easy to drink, a perfect welcome to micro beer for any macro drinker out there. Goes well with most spicy dishes."
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a cloudy amber color with a small white head that quickly turns into a thin lace around the edges of the glass. The aroma is rather faint for the style but does posses some nice toasted malt and hop flavors. The taste much like the aroma is pretty subdued with some biscuity malt and a touch of hops in the finish. The mouthfeel is light and fizzy from the carbonation. Overall, this is a pretty average amber that does not really stand out in any way. It is pretty drinkable, but it lacks in the flavor department."
"Pours a golden amber color with a smaller, quickly dissipating head with no lacing (poured from a pint glass into a mug). Has a sweet, fruity malt aroma to it, with a sniff of hops towards the end. A very malty taste to it. Fruity, Caramel tones, too. Slight hop taste. Has a light-moderate mouthfeel to it, with a good amount of carbonation. Overall, a decent beer worth trying out, but not something I would want to drink all the time (like most Abita beers)."
"Drinkability- I likd it."
"Kind of a disappointment, as Abita has some beers that I really like. Clear amber pour with white head that doesn't last for long. Slightly sweet beer that tastes of caramel. Thin mouthfeel that is a bit watery. Malty aroma that isn't very strong. Drinkable, but not great by any means."
"Note: If I were to describe this beer in one word it would be ""underpowered."""
"This beer can be described as a better version of those cheap lagers. It's got a goldenish color to it, fairly clean, and an okay taste. But what sets it apart is that it's a better quality beer, it has a better mouthfeel and is simply better than the lighter/weaker beers. If you need a standard beer for a party, and you don't want something stronger, this is your beer."
"Drinkability-This is a great beer. This beer goes well when you're having a crawfish boil!!"
"Pours a two finger white head that fades quickly leaving traces of lace. Clear amber color. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Smells like hay. Flavor is malty, smooth but nothing special. Clean finish. Best by Oct 23. (gift) 12oz bottle from somewheres in New Orleans."
"Poured a bottle of this into a glass mug. The body had a nice, dark amber color with an ok head. Not much to the retention, but slowed to a nice lacing that held. The smell was pretty malty. The taste was malty and coppery. It kind of reminded me of a cider beer. The mouthfeel was pretty full-bodied and smooth. Overall, I'd say that this beer was drinkable. Nice malts and smooth character made it pretty good."
"D: Average. Goes down pretty smooth."
"It has a very creamy mouthfeel with an interesting malt/hop combo. The brew is tongue-coating with a very nice toasted malty sweetness. This is a good lager with a heavier meal, but gets more watery towards the end. I have had this all over south Louisiana and is very predictable. Abita beers can fluctuate from batch to batch and year to year."
"Not impressive. I had a few with some gumbo, they seems to pair well. This is better to drink with a meal, rather than solo as a wonderful bottle of enjoyment."
"I really like the smooth amber color, very befitting of the name. Kinda mild and malty smell but there is some funk in it on first sniff. I got over the smell by sipping it. The taste is as smooth as the color but still not my favorite oktoberfest. Where is the sweeter malt I am use to in marzens? It is a very good beer and i still recommend it but not as a marzen, perhaps a dunkel lager that only made it halfway. This beer is a bit carbonated but it would be a good session beer on a summer day, just no complexity."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, its a good beer to stick with for an evening even if it may not quite be a true O-fest, maybe more of a Munich Dunkel or Helles Lager maybe, but still a good beer."
"Pours out a nutty, orangey amber with a steady stream of bubbles, a constant head, and nice lacing on the glass. Smell is some caramel malt, faint faint hops, and a little too much grain. Again, with the flavor is caramel malts, some iced tea, toast, and grain. Mouthfeel is moderate with a pleasant carbonation. Drinkable enough for me to order more than one of these. This is way off from an Oktoberfest. I'd call this a straight-up amber lager with a little too much grain in the mix."
"Abita Amber pours a light copper color with a thick white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is okay, kind of malty. Quite nice biscuity flavor. Doesn't really compare to a really good German Oktoberfest, kind of a dumbed down version imho. Worth a try, might make a good session beer."
"I poured this beer from the bottle to a 50 degree tumbler. The beer had a orange golden color with a white creamy head. The smell of this beer was fresh biscuits. The taste of this beer was nice and refreshing, light with a slight toffee hit that gave it a nice bonus. I will buy again."
"This is an easy drinker with a smooth slightly thick mouth. I was luke warm on the bottle version, but the draught is a fine session type red."
"Poured a slightly hazy amber with a frothy head that diminished. The aroma was of some malt but not much else, rather weak. The taste was also rather bland. Some malts and citrus hops, but not much. The beer was light and crisp, but I could not get over the bland taste. This beer was a major letdown."
"While I am partial to amber beers, this is one I will not search out again since it is not in the same class as even Amber Bock. I'll hang on to the rest of the six pack to serve to my sons-in-law while watching basketball this weekend."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle with a best by date on the back label. Got as party of sampler. It had a amber color with a small head that quickly went away. The smell was kinda like a pile of wet grass clippings in the Texas sun. The taste was OK but didn't really make me want another anytime soon. This is the 1st time that I've bought it outside of Pappadeaux's restaurant where I usually get it. It taste a lot better there but they also keep it ice cold so maybe there is best at 30's instead of mid-40's where I had it. (3, NA, Tie, O)"
"The taste is similar to the aroma, with roasted malt providing the backbone but doesn't get too sweet which is a plus. Mouthfeel is watery but not terrible. This is a reasonable marzen, even if it is brewed year round. Better than average compared to the rest of Abita's brews, I would drink this in a pinch."
"D: Average. Not a bad amber, but this is more of a lager with a dark coloring to me than anything else. Worth a try."
"Poured an amber color with a very small white head that disappeared quickly. Very little lacing. Smells slightly sweet with some roasted almonds maybe. Tasted a little sweet but nothing really stands out. Just above average as it's quite thin. It's not great, but it'll do."
"Pours a clear, well what do you know, Amber color with a modest head of off white bubbles. Aroma is almost all sweet caramel candy with just a hint of hops. Taste is somewhat surprising. Nice and roasty. I expected this to be too sweet from the nose. The caramel is still there, but a healthy dose of toasty Victory or Biscuit malt offsets it. Very nice. Aftertaste is mildly bitter and does not linger. Medium body. Great beer."
"Nice deep gold color with super carbonation. Quickly disappearing head with no lacing. A nice thick honey/buttery taste that leaves quickly. Slight maltiness that is sweet, but also kind of flat. However, It is about right I suppose for a Vienna type lager. An acceptable beer, however still quite bland."
"Mouthfeel has a dry finish. Would not try this again."
""
"Drinks alright, not a bad one to have with some pizza, but so-so as marzens go. Might taste better at 90 degrees with 90% humidity. If I had to guess at the abv, I'd say about 4.7%. That's probably the biggest knock on this beer, too thin/light for the style"
"Pours a darker amber color, white head dissipates quickly. It has a strange aroma, not sure how to describe it, but its malty. Flavor is bread like, almost toasty malts. No significant hop flavors. Medium mouthfeel. This would make a nice session beer, good flavor but nothing too exciting."
"the fourth beer from the abita party pack. a good quarter inch head that quickly disapates.no lacing down the side of the glass.kind of a reddish color.not bad mouthfeel and doesnt taste to bad but for the price id stick with a good american macro brew."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle, into a pint glass. The beer poured a deep caramel, forming a 1 inch head, that left medium rings of lace on the glass. The aroma has a nice sweet caramel smell. The taste is much the same. Light sweet malt thickness, caramel flavor, and a hint of hop presence at the finish. Medium smooth mouthfeel. Overall, a significant difference between the first time I reviewed, and the second. I'm hoping that this second time is how the beer is supposed to taste, but I wont know until I try it a third time;)"
"Pours an amber color with a minimal head. The aroma and flavor are mainly sweet malt. The flavor has a hint of hops, a little grassy, but nothing too strong. The body is good. It's pretty average for the style. No major flaws, but nothing astounding either."
"I got this 12 ounze bottle from an Abita Party Pack, and poured into a giant 20/24 ounze glass. It didn't produce much head and what it did produce had fast retention. The lacing was there but very sporatic. The aroma was hoppy. The taste was fruity or sweet. The mouthfeel was kind of unrefined. Pretty drinkable, but not awsome. Don't drink and review."
"Drinkabiluty: Easy enough to drink but no particularly memorable"
"Good beer. I also liked how it had a best before date on it. I wish all brewers would do that."
"Pours a hazy golden-copper hue. Head quickly settles into a thin semi-dense cap which stays the duration of the rest of the beer. Fairly nice lacing along the glass. Taste is very weak, watery and thin. Notes of honey, bread and watery grain. Not at all balenced. Very weak finish (if at all.)"
"Notes: I've had many Marzen's this year and last year. This one does not even warrant attention. Pass."
"D-not very drinkable given the off flavor"
"I could see having these as a change up or even drinking a few at a poker game. Nothing really special, but well rounded for flavor. A typical craft beer."
"I like the malt flavor, but it's there one minute and gone the next. Leaves you thinking it was underpowered. Worth a try, though."
"Overall- This is bad! Has a cheap macro flavor with the corn/ grain taste and heaps of sugar. Avoid!!"
"Poured a very slightly hazed brownish orange , with a fair amount of carbonation and a small of white head. The aroam is a bit roasty , malty , some caramel and a tad bit of raisin. The taste is also roasty , nice crystal maltiness , with just a small amount of balancing hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is clean and crisp. A very quaffable brew , well worth a try. Would make a good keg around October."
"D: Banish all beers with a grainy aftertaste. It drives me crazy."
"Overall, only the color hints that this is an attempt at an amber beer."
"Sorry, but this beer did not do anything for me. Appearance was flat, the olden orange pour had a head that immediately diappeared, and there was absolutely no lacing. Aroma was sour hops, at best, flavor was like drinking a macro lager, and the finish was nothing to write home about. Ive had some good Vienna beer, but this aint one of em."
"Overall, a decent, generally typical, unremarkable example of the style."
"As an aside, this beer is outstanding with spicy foods...which is very appropriate, given the location of its brewery."
"Overall: This brew comes across like a sweet amber ale, pretty good overall but whats up with that odd metallic taste at first? Average-plus."
"Taste is malty and biscuity. Some faint hops. Lightly sticky mouth. Pretty basic, pretty standard amber lager (OK, maybe a bit maltier than your average amber) but very tasty and well crafted. Abita never knocks it out of the park but they are always solid. This one is no exception."
"This beer poured a clear amber color. It had a nice head that persisted for a few minutes. The smell is a bit malty. It has a very malty taste with a bit of a bite that stays with you after the beer is swallowed. It has a full mouthfeel, but not thick. As far as drinkability goes....there's nothing wrong with this one!"
"This is a solid Oktober, and the only point deduction was from the ultra fast dissapating head. Regardless, this is tasy and one of the finest Oktobers I have tasted recently. I definitely reccomend this one."
"This is a decent session brew and somewhat of an easy find in the area, as most bars seem to have at least either the Abita Amber or Turbodog available. Certainly a nice alternative when your choices are Bud, Miller, Heinieken, etc."
"Clear , medium amber with a small, white, foamy head that slowly goes down to a film sticks around for a while. Smell: sweet, bready roasted malts, butterscotch, light floral hops. Taste: More sweet, moderate strength, balanced malts. Caramel, yeast, light hop bitterness late on the finish. It has a medium-light body, slightly oily texture and moderate-lively carbonation. Not bad. Nothing special, but a good session beer."
"This is a very pleasant Marzen with some fruity notes complimenting the lager flavors in the grain and hops. Very drinkable and it would make a good ""go to"" beer for an evening out..."
"Nice clear amber pour with a pillowy white head resolving quickly to a lid of foam. Smells sweet, toffee-ish, with a huge nutty aspect. Very, very slight floral hop aroma around the edges. The taste is sort of towards the caramel/toast end, with a slightly metallic bitter at the end of each sip. The body is perfectly light, almost to the point of being too thin... the degree of nutty breadiness just isn't quite right with the thin body."
"Hazed amber. Moderate amounts of carbonation are noted. Thin ivory white head. Lace is minimal. Pretty nice aroma. Real nutty. Caramelly and malty as well. That taste has a real heavy nuttiness as well. Mixes with a bit of toasted malt and caramel malt. Decent enough taste. Medium-full body. Moderate amounts of carbonation."
" I will buy this beer again, and again. This is a great American beer. This was a vey good surprise. I just picked this up one day, never having even heard of it. My brother and I both were in awe over this one and we usually have different taste in beers."
"I first had this on-tap in New Orleans on a very hot, humid day and remember being refreshed. So, when I recently saw it in bottles at a local store, I decided to try it. I took notes on it, but also remember it vividly because of its lack of anything but decent water. I must have been very thirsty in New Orleans. It poured a very light amber with a bubbly thin head that VERY quickly disappeared. It didn't smell like anything. Maybe some attempt at a floral aroma, but it took a deep smell to get even that much. The most obvious part of the taste was the water. It tasted like very good spring water, so the water they use is very good. I'm being too harsh - it has a thirst-quenching quality."
"I probably could have downed a few more but we were having a quick on-the-run meal. Someone said that I could buy this at a beer-seller a few doors down, and I came home with a six-pack which I am now enjoying. My feelings haven't changed about this beer, since the first sip. Very drinkable, very enjoyable."
"D - higher only due to its wateriness, easily chuggable, not a good thing"
"At points while drinking this I was reminded of a light beer. Must have been the dry finish and light mouthfeel."
"D&N: Not a bad beer, but I was expecting a little more from a marzen. Highly drinkable as a session beer, would be uber picnic fodder."
"Overall. This beer is my go to beer at local restaurants that dont have anything else. Nothing too special, just an easy drinkin beer that tastes pretty good."
"Pale copper color and had a quickly-disappearing head. The smell turned me off a little...the other Abitas gave off a pretty good aroma, so I was a little disappointed. I rated it a good taste, but here's the deal: at first, I didn't like it - there was a lingering old-hops aftertaste. But then I drank it with food, and it was instantly better. Felt ok in the mouth before, but with a burger in the other hand, this beer got much better."
"Pours a clear amber slash light copper color mix. The head is pretty sparse and leaves no film on the surface of glass. Very scattered hazing.Smells a little toasty with a few biscuit notes. The flavor was pretty good. Starts out with some subdued hop bitterness but then leads to some well defined toasted malts. Mouthfeel was pretty light but still had some toasty balls of flavor. Something that I could drink all night."
"This poured a very clean amber with a small airy fizz head that does not last long at all. lear, pale amber coloring. Kind of a veggie chem smell, kinda bad but all the abita beers smell like this. Kinda sweet and malty but not enough flavor to say so. Very crisp feel, kinda watery though. Not very drinkable."
"Sweet in the taste, but balanced out fairly well with a hoppy finish - which start to dominate by mid-bottle. This one would go well with the spicy Cajun chow."
"However, the beer is good for what it is. It is a smooth, refreshing drink and while the body is thin and the taste is light, what little taste there is, tastes great. Were it not for the colouration, I'd say this would be a fine pale lager. Well, even those need malt. Yeah, refreshing, but not amazing. Maybe if I tried it in the summer."
"This pours a honey color with a nice head that disappears quickly.The smell is very nutty with some roasted malt and spices.The taste has a nutty quality to it,and taste of carmel.It's pretty good,but hard to describe.There is a little roastyness and almost no carbonation.The m/f is not really well balanced and light and even a little watery.This is an OK beer,slightly better than average."
"Good, quality lager, this."
"Notes: average (at the best) brew"
"Overall, this is pretty much dead average. I don't hate it, I don't like it. Probably won't buy again."
"Overall - This is an exceptional beer. My first ""local"" (and probably only local beer sadly) beer from the southern region. Will buy again and try the other types they have. Great job Abita!"
"12 ounce bottle. Abita Amber pours out a clear, light copper color with a rapidly diminishing head. Carbonation appears to be very low. This is a strange beer in that it has almost no aroma. There is a perhaps a hint of sweetness, but almost without aroma. Clean, toasted maltt flavor. Not too sweet. Some mild hop spice in the finish. Creamy mouthfeel. No noticable alcohol. Good drinkability. The flavor of this beer is very simple, but it is still enjoyable. Worth a try."
"Pours a clear amber with very little head. Aroma is mainly carmel malt with some breadiness. Flavor has very little bitterness, just a touch of spiciness from the hops. Subdued malt flavor. Thin but fizzy mouthfeel. Very smooth with a clean finish. Rates high on the drinkability scale. Not bad, but not nearly as good as Abita's Turbodog."
"On-Tap in NYC and NOLA on several occasions. My preference being the big ole' 24oz plastic cups that you can snaggle away for $1 on rue bourbon. Damn you Katrina, damn you! Anyway, on to the brew. A dark amber colour with a small off-white head that dies pretty quickly and leaves not much lacing to behold. Aromas are sweet malts and light hops in a nice bready unison. Taste is similar and not too complex, but verycold, crips, refreshing, and thirst-quenching. A good macro-micro if ever there was one. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and nice, drinkability is decent. I miss New Orleans! :-("
"A surprising beer. The pour was rather unimpressive. Very flat, no head and a tired looking amber hue. Nose is slightly biscuity. Flavor is a very nice toasted graham cracker flavor. Some fresh biscuits too. Hints of apples. Fairly light body and slightly crispish. Very easy drinking beer."
"Very drinkable, went down well with pizza."
"Good carbonation, medium bodied. Very drinkable. I was impressed by this beer. My throat was parched after a long day and this did the trick. At 4.99 a six, I would put this up against many amber ales at 2 bucks higher any day."
"The taste is nothing to jump about, it isnt bad, but it isnt spectacular. It's obvious that Turbodog is the Abita Flagship. It has a good hops sense, but the butter cream is watered out. As a session beer goes, this is as mild and tepid as it gets, a good landmark Louisiana Brew, but jump for Turbodog first."
"Not a bad example of the style, but I would like a little more. This is what Yuengling Lager would taste like if it was all malt."
"Pours a clear amber-copper color that is topped by a frothy, almost creamy, light tan colored head. The aroma is fairly bland with hints of crystal malt, and perhaps just a wisp of spicy hoppiness. The taste is soft and smooth, quite light and it has an up front light caramelized sweetness. The finish is lightly spicy and a bit bitter with a balancing hoppiness. This is really a rather bland Amber Ale, not really much to say."
"Compared to the previous beer I ordered, this one came back to the basics of a good Amber. Nice copper color with light hops, sweet and refreshing. Okay lacing, head, and carbonation. Better than the other Abita products that I've tried. Easy enough drink as a session beer."
"poured a clean deep amber color with slightll off-white puffy head. Smell is a pleasnt mix of malt, nuts, and caramel.First taste is very enjoyable with a mild dryness left in the mouth. Taste continues on wiht a slight sweetness. An easy drinking beer, but nothing spectactular."
"A rather bland and boring version of the style. Drinkable but really just a waste of time to drink another pint. Just my second encounter with Abita and I am not impressed."
"Slight sweet and malty aroma, less than I prefer. Lightly brown apearance lessened by the carbonation. Flavor and body seem to be a bit too weak, both of style and preference. Too sweet and tacky to be refreshing; too weak to be flavorful or balanced. Finishes also sweet and a bit tart for style."
"Overall impression: Last time I was in New Orleans I think I consumed my weight in Abita Amber. Many of the bars have 3 for 1 happy hour specials on this local brew. Thanks to BigLove, I got the chance to finally review it. This is a great gateway beer, and incredibly drinkable. Maybe not the most exciting beer out there, but a great stand-by that is a readily available alternative to the macros that dominate New Orleans."
"appearance is amber (duh) with a respectable head of foam and some bubbles. some. aroma is light roasty malts. taste is a heavier malt kick (not HEAVY by any means) with a distinct hop bitterness and sugary caramel notes leading to a tart finish. strongest in the abita series of generic beers, excluding TD and PH... which means nothing since it's still somewhat watery. a good summer beer and enough flavor to supercede the lightness of body. very drinkable, just not turbodog."
"Poured a light orange-amber with a nice head that did not sustain. Smell is grainy sweet nut smell, very interesting. Taste is very malty to start with a sweet nutty finish. Mouthfeel is a bit thin but clean in the finish. Overall drinkability is good. Unfortunately I do not have any more to sample!"
"Clear orange-amber color with a bubbley white head. Smells like roasted malts and caramel. Biscuity malts, caramel and some taosted grainy finish. Very clean finish and light to meduim body that makes for great drinkability. Very tasty lager I must say!"
"This lager from New Orleans pours a rich amber-orange color. Quite smooth and malty. Not a lot of hop bite in this one. When friend asked me about this beer, I told him it was like a KIllian's which isn't far from the truth. A bit more complex than that however - a little smokey, nutty. Made by a small microbrewery in Louisiana, has a character that is sort of unique but still nothing extraordinary."
"These things are pretty smooth and highly drinkable. The first time I tried Abita, about 4 yrs ago, I thought it might be a little too sticky or too malty to make it quaffable in larger quantities. I think it has improved in this regard."
"This beer pours a hazy golden amberish color. Medium sized tan white head. Aroma is odd, almost adjuncty with corny notes and corn sugar sweetness. Reminds me of a macro at first but then I get some nice toasty notes in there. Flavor is not adjuncty at all though. Nice vienna malt sweetness with an underlying toasty caramel base. Mild spicy hop prescence eases the sweetness and makes this beer really drinkable. Medium bodied and easy to down, this was a nice little beer. Recommended."
"Poured with a slight haziness. Deep golden orange in color and topped with a thin head of eggshell foam. A pungent bouquet of sour grains is evident when brought up to the nose. Also detected some zesty sweet caramel like malts and dark chocolates. The taste is sweet, smooth and tangy. Light in body that gives up hints of malt texture. This is a drinkable beer and brings a pleasant orangey fruitiness in the finish - along with touches of bitterness. Not bad. Enjoyable."
"This beer is average in the bottle. On tap it does taste a bit better."
"This beer is definitely not an Oktoberfest, but it is quite tasty. Also, I admit that I just happen to love nutty beers."
"Another arrival in the Confederate BIF package courtesy of BigLove. The beer poured clear golden amber with a thin fleeting head. The aroma was slightly sweeter than water and the taste was grainy and a bit sour. No character whatsoever in the mouthfeel. No aftertaste."
"I also had this beer on tap. I must say that having it from a keg is nicer than the bottle. I hope that I get stuck in NO for a few weeks again so that I can get it on tap."
"Comments  Thanks to BigLove for sending me this above-par offering of a nice German Märzen."
"This is a good winter beer. It is a little on the sweet side but not oppressively so. Has a nice copper color and decent head and lacing. Just enough of a hop presence to offset the carmel malts that likely give it much of its sweetness and color. The yeast gives it a nice fruity/doughy taste and aroma. A decent beer. Not Abita's best IMHO, but a good one none the less."
"On the plus side, it would be very drinkable on a sticky Louisiana night."
"Abita Amber is a garden-variety Oktoberfest that makes no horrible missteps, but neither does it impress. It's drinkable as long as one is otherwise engaged and doesn't want to bother with anything even remotely interesting. I drink for flavor though, and by that standard this beer falls noticeably short."
"A very drinkable beer. I didn't know it was a Marzen, but somewhat appropriate that I picked it up now. Tasty, and not too heavy. Easily a session beer."
"The mouthfeel was as uneventful as the color but I found it very easy to drink. I felt an odd burning sensation in my diaphram after I drank it, but that could be the pizza from earlier."
"A nice tasty beer has a nice full flavor."
"One inch of fizzy, foamy, cream-colored head. Clear, clear, copper-amber beer. Tiny spots of lacing. Peanuts in the nose and front with some tangy caramel. Tangy, malty, sweet middle and a peanutty, bitter finish with a little fruit and a little alcohol. It's ok. Typical Abita peanuts, some decent caramel malt that's really quite sweet. But it's not a great beer."
"This beer is available locally both in the bottle or on tap. The color is a clear honey amber. This is not a heavy ale and is highly drinkable on a hot summer day. Nothing truly distinctive or enjoyable about the aroma. Has reasonable body for this type of beer. Taste is slightly sweet and malty, little hops note. Beer finishes dry with a slight earthy aftertaste that some may find to be offputing. I have noted that the quality is slightly variable or perhaps it is me, but this can be a really enjoyable beer or not so enjoyable. It is a decent alternative to the mass market beers when eating spicy foods and on hot days. Like most beers it is almost always better on tap than in the bottle."
"Clear, coppery amber in hue, the color is attractive but a lack of animation in such a translucent beer is sad. A slightly off-white head of a half finger topped off the beer; the head retention was fair as it faded quickly to a weak cap. The subsequent lacing was spotty and it didnt cling well. The nose is malty but not domineering, somewhat sweet with caramel hints, toasty, earthy at the back. The potency is modest and the aromas are simplistic. It does suggestion German origins but I dont know if Id call it a true Märzen. Inviting by default really. Well, the nose didnt lie. It tastes as simplistic as the bouquet indicated. There is no begin or middle or end, taste-wise. Everything is lumped as one. It is malty sweet with a fair amount of caramel. Pleasantly earthy too, from the hops I assume, mildly bitter. Again, this beer shows its German roots. The more I drank the more biscuity and dry it became. The palate is respectable; while it is plenty tasty it is also very straightforward. Some of this can be expected, as the style dictates. I would image this would be a good beer for beginners, i.e., a crossover beer. The carbonation was a little too stiff and I thought that really hurt the mouthfeel. It was too fizzy, especially considering the smallish frame, medium/medium-light in body. I will say this beer is plenty drinkable, I am sure it would be easy to kill a six-pack and I bet it would work nicely with BBQ dishes. It is not available locally so, thanks to Morris729 for the bottle!"
"A very odd brew. Not a good amber. Weak, artificial, and unimpressive. Pass on this crossover brew and stick with yer Michelob dark."
"Not my favorite for an amber, but it was worth the try."
"This is what I would call a ""Why Bother?"" beer. Why did they bother brewing something so bland? And why bother drinking it?"
"This has ""conversion"" brew written all over it. Either that or ""Yawwwnnn""."
"Dr-3"
"Abita Amber is easy to come by anywhere in New Orleans proper. If you can get it, try it on tap. I had it at the Abita Brew Pub in Abita Springs, and along Bourbon Street. I'm not sure what hops they use, but would call this an Americanized version of the Oktoberfest style. It's a malty, sweet, amber beer (as it should be). This is one I could, and did, drink a lot of."
"Beer is good. Happy Nawlins Beering."
"This is pretty much an average, American amber ale, as opposed to a Marzen. Stick to Abita's Turbodog. It's far better."
"This stuff is omnipresent in New Orleans. It's a great old standby in this town. I wish the establishments near me would carry the local stuff as reliably. Pours a dark amber color with a beige head that lingers and leaves a fine cap and thick lace around the glass. Aroma is a chewy, biscuity, malt smell, and the flavor matches it fairly well. A smooth and creamy mouthfeel makes this one easy to sip for hours. Very tasty, well-balanced, and easy to drink."
"Head quickly dissipates, leaving a sheer tracing around the rim. Smells subtle but wonderful: bread, yeast. Taste -- altogether an It ale. Forward but balanced flavors of malt, caramel, and dried pears. Strangely, about two-thirds through comes a nice hoppy bite but it is quickly recaptured by the overall malt/caramel again to the finish. What I find especially charming in this beer is that it's big on flavor, but you can drink quite a bit, not often the case with beers that are so tasty that they demand your full attention, and that can be exhausting when you just want to hang."
"Nice amber color, head was gone as soon as it poured and stayed as a light film. Slight scent of oranges, lemon rind. Very light tasting, slight bite in the aftertaste. Bit of citrus in there somewhere, grapefruit. Very light feeling and smooth, leaves that grapefruit rind taste. Good session beer."
"This is a nice lager, very refreshing and certainly more than I expected. I will have this again."
"This beer poured a clear amber with a firm, nice white head that retained its thickness for a long time. A mild swirling is all that it took to bring the head back to life. This was truly the best part of the beer. The aroma consisted only of malt. It was subtle and I could not detect the hops. The more I drank of this glass and swirled its contents, the more I enjoyed the maltiness of the brew. The taste began a little chocolaty and finished a little sweeter than I would have liked. There was a little bitterness but no hop flavor. The balance of this entire beer is toward the malt so follows style. The mouthfeel was a little light for my preference. It needed to be a little more full. The carbonation did play a slight bit with my tongue and made up for a lack of body. When asked about Abita, my response has always been, they make a mighty fine root beer. I will have to include their amber as a good beer. I would recommend this as a good session beer."
"Poured into a pint glass, a 1/2 inch head formed, which retreated to a layer of foam over the slightly cloudy amber brew. Malty, yeasty nose, reminds me of bread. Good, full mouthful of malts, with hops that complement and do not detract from the grain flavor. This one sort of caught me by surprise, wasn't expecting to enjoy this one as much as I did."
"Pours an interesting shade of amber that is almost tan with a loose head of foam that settles rather quickly. Slgiht bready aroma and flavor. Nice delicate toasted malt flavors. Finishes dry. The mouthfeel is fairly light. This is a rather delicate ale. A very balanced drinkable beer that goes well with food. I like the toasted malt flavor and the dryness of this brew. It's not that exciting, but has some nice delicate flavors, and is quite clean. I would drink this again when I am in the mood for a lighter beer."
"Not a brew with a whole lot of depth. Nothing I'd go out and buy in a sixer, but something decent for a pint at the pub. Probably more geared towards folks that don't seek out beer to kick their asses with, just something to enjoy while hanging out with friends. A pint for when you don't really want to concentrate on your beer, and just enjoy yourself in some company."
"This is a fairly average beer as it is a bit lighter bodied than anticipated, but the flavors in this beer are pretty good and it is quite drinkable (I wouldn't mind having a few of these on a hot day). Not as memorable as Turbo Dog, but good nonetheless."
"This is one of those beers I enjoyed but looses points because its not to style. If its a marzen it needs more malt. If its an amber it needs more hops and an ale yeast. Its like an American Amber Ale with a lager yeast. That being said, its very refreshing and reminds me of some of my other favorite amber ales but with a cleaner finish."
"This is a light-medium bodied beer and carbonation levels were good. The aftertaste was fairly clean. There is nothing that really sticks out to make this anything other than an average beer."
"The beer pours a light amber color with a thick white head that quickly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a slight malty scent with nutty undertones and a breadlike finish. The taste is good. It has a bit of malty flavor with a nutty accent. It finishes clean, but with a little watery aftertaste. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low/medium bodied beer with good carbonation. The beer drinks well; a good sessions ale."
"Nice deep amber color with a head that faded quickly. The initial taste that hits your mouth is very watered down but the flavor intensifies as it heads down your throat. The finish was pretty dry but the mouthfeel is very balanced. Personally, I enjoy a nice amber and this one, though not my favorite, is we rounded and would satisfy all types of beer drinkers."
"I have found this beer to by highly drinkable with pizza, burgers and most anything else, or just while watching a game on TV."
"I was expecting this dark amber color, but got a light orangey color instead. Big frothy very light tan colored head. The head died out after a few short minutes to a laceing that stood the whole time. Smell was very strange to me. I got citrus, burned malts, and burned nuts. It was very weird how it went in stages. The taste was strange too. First, there was no taste at all, almost watery. Then it went to a short burst of light citrus mixed with wheat. Finally, it went to the strange taste of burned malts/nuts. The complexity of it was shear brilliance to me, thus the high score. The mouthfeel was creamy and bubbly all at once. This was another one of those great beers to sit and drink for a while. I wouldn;t want to spend my Fall nights any other way."
"I was slightly disappointed. I really wanted this beer to be better than it was. I'd like to try it again, just to see if I maybe got my hands on a bad bottle. For now, I'll move on and try some of Abita's other brews."
"An amber color, if a touch light. A touch hazy. The aroma is fairly weak. There are hints of malt to the nose, but not much else. A bit of malt sweetness to the taste, but not much else. Actually a hint of sourness in the aftertaste. Low carbonation and a medium-light body make this drinkable, but I'll stay with Yuengling as my choice for this type of beer. Also I have now had it on tap. No real difference. Fizzy head that goes away quickly is the only major difference in the two."
"Not too bad. Just another megabrewed dark beer, kinda like my first Schlitz Dark. Short head actually hangs around a little while. Slightly caramelly taste with hint of corn. I got this in New Orleans in a ""to go"" cup to wash out the taste of a $1.50 Skyy Blue (I swear they must be making these with NutraSweet!), so it filled a need. The sad thing is, in the touristy French Quarter, this is the closest you're going to come to finding a microbrew on tap. All else is just Bud, Bud Light..."
"Had this one on tap at the local pub. It pours a light amber color with a decent sized head and quite a bit of lacing on the glass. The aroma was very weak, but a little maltiness was present. The flavor seemed a bit weak to me as well. Slightly sweet tasting, but rather boring. The aftertaste is really dry. There is a bite in the flavor that did not seem to be caused by the alcohol, maybe it was just a bad pitcher."
"Notes: Largely forgettable."
"Amber reddish beer that is very smooth.. Low alcohol content makes this a very drinkable beer.. as well as a nice malt balance.. sweet in the nose taste of caramel and hops in the glass as this beer reaches its highest point at the end of the bottle. Nice light amber beer that is thirst quenching and good for a beginning beer for any converts to micros."
"When I poured this beer into my glass, it poured with a quick dissolving white head.There was fizzy carbonation observed with this beer. The hue of this beer is amber.There was no lacing on the sides of my glass with this beer. This beer in my opinion has a bit of a sour taste to it that I did not care for."
"This beer came to me with a nice amber color and an average sized head which lasted for almost half of the beer. It was a smooth beer that went down well. The aroma didn't really stand out to me, but the flavors were present and created a nice mouthfeel. The drinkability of this beer was great!"
"If you are an amber drinker I say give this one a try. It has simple but tasteful qualities."
"This brew poured a large head of fie to large sized off white bubbles that soon disappeared. It had a nice transparent amber color with no carbonation evident. It had a very mild malt aroma. Now the real interesting part of this review is the brew's flavor. It is smooth with a complex flavor of many interesting notes. There's nut, malt, spice, caramel, and butter in the flavor."
"This beer poured into the glass orange/brown in color that was crystal clear and well carbonated. It produced a thick, foamy and creamy head that was beige in color. Lace was stretched inside the glass that was creamy and sheety in places and spotty and non-existent in others. The aromas that came from the glass were fairly simply stated, malts (toasted and sweet), caramel, and a hint of hops (slight). The tastes were also simple in nature, light floral and herb hops, sweet malt and toasted malt, and a leafy dryness near the end. It had a medium to light medium body. Over all it was crisp and light, malt was the lead ingredient. It was watery and quenched my thirst. Not the greatest beer I have had (personally and according to style) but it was above average. A good beer for those who want to try the craft beer experience but are used to the macro beer world."
"This is a stand-by at my house. My in-laws live near Abita and bring it to me when they come here, or have it at their house when I go there. They could get better beer for me, but I'm not gonna complain about it, because they could do a whole lot worse. They know I like to visit the brewery when I can so I guess they think its my favorite. Anyway....12 oz brown twist-off is the only way to get it, other than out of a tap. This is Abita's most popular, and I think a very good representative of the style. It pours am amber color without much head. If you really try you could end up with none, pour hard and what you get won't last very long. The aroma is sweet, roasted malts..toffee/caramel. Medium body, smooth mouthfeel. They didn't forget the hops, as there is some bitterness, but not much. If I have any complaint its that there seems to be a slight sourness in the finish. I think its a good beer to use to convert your BMC friends to something better, because it certainly has a lot more character than the similarly priced American lagers sitting next to it at the grocery store."
"I rated this amber so high based on the adherence to the style and the taste relative to what an amber should be. There are much better tasting beers IMHO per my tastes, but as for an amber I haven't found much better."
"A good easy drinking beer for all occasions. Not perfect but enjoyable. This beer must be great on draft. Out of the bottle it pours to a very thin white head and orange/amber color. Aroma is predominantly pale malt and a bit of carapils and/or Munich malt witha bit of crystal (caramel) malt thrown in. The taste confirms the aroma's suggestion: pale maltiness fortified with a little Munich and or some other darker carmelized malts. Mouthfeel is smooth and bubbly. Very quaffable stuff. I'll have another."
"This must have been an out of date bottle because it was flat and didn't raise a head. I had a sense of a fine beer that was overaged. The look was a cloudy bright copper with virtually no head or lacing. The flavor seemed good despite the flatness of the mouthfeel. Nice aroma of caramel malt with a hop edge. Nicely balanced flavors seem to blend malt sweetness and hop bitterness. Dry finish. Sure would like to have one fresh on tap."
"Pours a clear orange amber color with a thin white head that fades into a sticky lace. Nose is sweet malts, light caramel, and a touch of fruit. Medium in body and fairly smooth. Taste is sweet toasted malts and caramel at first followed by some bready and biscuity notes. Some mildly bitter hops and a dry cracker-like flavor come through in the finish. I cant think of anything in particular that stands out in the beer, but its an enjoyable brew nonetheless."
"Clear copper in color with a thin head. Aroma is grainy, somewhat reminiscent of wet dog. The body of the beer is mildly malty, with a light grainy taste and some very vague hints of fruit. Overall a bit too insubstantial in body and flavor for my tastes, and not up to the standard of some of Abita's other beers."
"The flavor is dominated by the malts, and it does not really resemble the octoberfest style to me. It has the rich body, and the crisp to smooth body of a traditional vienna, but it just seems more like an ale than a german lager. As you go through it, it becomes more welcomed as a lager beer, but it still does not seem like a vienna or oktoberfest. It seems more like a rich version of a traditional munich or vienna lager. It is very easy to drink, and it is a good beer for the unexperienced to try. If you are not yet into the stout and dark beer scene, this is one you really should try."
"Amber in color, obviously, with a thin, quickly dissipating head. Aroma and taste are consistent. Light malt. Effervescent and refreshing. A little thin for my taste but not a bad beer. An easy drinker probably more suited to consumption in the summer as opposed to a cold February evening."
"I got a six pack of this down in Baton Rouge, and I'm glad to be using it as the first part of a no-doubt long New Years Eve session of beer drinking!"
"Medium Amber color, medium head. A medium bodied amber ale. Malty and slightly hoppy, with a nice malty flavor. Good taste. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean. Aftertaste is malty and slightly bitter."
"pours out an orange-tinted amber color. slight head left no lace, minimal carbonation makes for an uninteresting looking amber. a medium body is host to a number of sweet grain flavors...honey, with bready and toasted malts adding some life to the flavor profile. a crisp, raw finish lets you know that the sweetness just won't cover up the grainy astringency. a crossover brew at best."
"On the pour dark amber color, the head indifferent in size, the texture frothy, the lace in lumpy sheets to coat the glass. Nose is sweet, malt dominates, clear and crisp. Front is cloyingly sweet, the top skinny with a middling carbonation and pleasant hop bite. Abitas makes some decent session beers, but they lack the fullness of mouth feel that I prefer."
"Pours a clear copper color with a medium off-white head. Smell of a somewhat nutty and malty aromas are a nice starter for the palate motor. Nice blend of flavors from a nutty/grainy blend with a medium blend of hops and finishes with a light caramel and alcohol. Pretty darned drinkable in this light bodied beer. Cheers!"
"Copper colored with a rather thick head. Faint malt aroma. The flavor was unfortunately rather bland and there is no risk of it offending anyone. I like to be challenged a tad more by a beer that touts being a micro-brew on their label."
"Amber being Abitas biggest selling beer, it is not overly surprising that the hop character is understated, to say the least. The wide popularity of the beer may also account for its lack of roasted-grain flavor and aroma."
"An amber gold appearance with fruity malt aroma.Medium body with little hop bitterness and a clean dry finish. I was not very impressed with this beer at all. There are a lot better amber brews out there."
"""Expires 7-24"" I assume 2002. Lighter than I expect for a Vienna/red/amber lager. The aromas are a chunky arrangement of caramel, toasted grain and roux. Light-bodied and dry, it delivers perfunctory notes of peanuts, caramel and toasted wheat bread. Not bad."
"Pours a nice crystal copper color with a smallish tan head that runs away quickly and leaves no lace.  Husky, toasty malt is big in the aroma of this one and dominates over all else.  The huge toastiness of this brew carries over into the taste as the brew gets so much towards the toasty end of the malt spectrum that it almost turns smoky.  The toasty aspects of the malt balancenicely because of the lack of a real sweet malt quality and a bit of hops that can be detected in the background that do just enough.  The great toasty malt qualites of this brew leave it surprisingly crisp for this style and help to make it awesomely drinkable.  This would certainly make on hell of a session beer if I could only get it in six packs in my area."
"I was introduced to the Abita product on my first trip to NOLA. I was impressed. This is a very good product that accompanies the NOLA cuisine quite well. The pour, aroma, taste and after glow are excellent."
"A slightly hazy copper body is topped by a full, foamy off-white head that holds well and maintains a thin surface covering throughout the glass. The aroma is slightly fruity and offers the toasty and lightly sweet maltiness of Vienna malt. The flavor follows the aroma with a well-balanced, bready & toasty malt. Some of the Abita house flavor is present but it doesn't stand out as it does in some of their less malty beers. The body is medium with a very fine and moderate carbonation. The creamy mouthfeel helps to accentuate the maltiness. The malt gives way to a dry finish with a touch of hop bitterness and a lightly lingering biscuity note. One of Abita's better beers and a good crossover beer for those starting to look for more flavor. This beer should be enjoyed at 45-55F to experience it's complete maltiness."
"Pours a clear medium amber with a slight off white half finger head,some caramel and toast in the nose with a light smattering of leafy hops.Slightly sweet flavors with some caramel and breadiness,some drying in the finish.Easy drinking and food friendly,nothing to complain about."
"This is the only beer I have tried from Abita so hopefully the others are much better.  The color didn't impress me but the taste and drinkability impressed me even less.  To me this was well just a very bland brew.  I know Emerril LaGasse swears by this beer or does he have a contract with them? But I have heard Turbo dog is very good so will give Abita another shot....................CHEERS"
"Abita Amber:  It is the impact of Beer Advocate, I used to be impressed with this beer, but now was very under whelmed (I’ve had lots better since I joined).  Nice looking bronze color, clear white head.  Pale taste, slightly nutty, with hints of malt.  I can recommend this as a transition beer, but not further than that."
"Lovely copper color with a thick white head of quite compact bubbles, good head retention with lots of sticky lace.  Malt and caramel aromas with a quite subtle spice note.  Quite smooth taste, roasted malt flavors vie with spicy hops and herbal flavors, with the hops imparting a mildly bitter finish.  A quite nice amber."
"Had this on draught while down in Ruston LA, at a little place called Patchetolues (can't spell).  Nice amber color, with moderate head. NIce malt character with good blend of hops. More bitter than sweet, had somewhat of an ale like character."
"On tap in various places in New Orleans. Nice deep amber color, no appreciable head. Smells clean, slightly malty. Taste is smooth and refreshing, mildly nutty, a little sweet, and with a touch of bitterness in the finish. Though not one of my favorite styles, this is a fairly good interpretation of it."
"Notes: This brew still holds its ground as a classic among the many ""micro brews", a down right tasty lager."
"I remember that this was the only beer I drank while in New Orleans and I had it on draft and it was good. Then I tried it again in the bottle back in Atlanta and it was only ok.
