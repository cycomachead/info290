If only the body was a bit thinner and carbonation a bit higher than this would have been very enjoyable for the flavors and style.

The overall impression is it is pretty decent for a german style lager pretty expressive and very full of flavor but I consider it more helles so it doesn't fit the style to a T in my opinion...but very drinkable nonetheless.","Slatetank","May 21, 2013"

With a hoppy Hallertau bite that's rather more of a nibble, this brew could easily be considered a Vienna lager, rather than a true pils.

All around solid brew. The taste was so fresh, crisp, and refreshing. I wish I had more to share (but the cost for an extra 12 pack is just too much).

Toasted grains on the tongue up front followed by more of that sweet malty goodness. A minor metallic flavor is hidden underneath all the sweetness which I could do without.

I believe there is some slight skunking in this bottle. Having tried SA Imp Pils, I know what Hallertaus should taste like, and this one doesn't give too much of the flavor or aroma of them. A medium light bodied lager, this one has just a touch of sweetness with the lightly toasted malts taking over.

Hit the spot so to speak. There was barely any head, I don't know enough yet to know if there should be for this style. :( It felt great in the mouth and I feel would be a good summertime beer. It was pretty drinkable because it wasn't too heavy in the mouth or stomach.

Incredibly fresh taste and oh so smooth that it goes down with food or as a session drink. In this case, it's lack of complexity is actually a benefit, as you can really enjoy the drink.

It's a barely transparent dark gold. The nose is actually quite weak, with only a slight sweet grain aroma. The taste is close to what I expect from a Dortmunder, with less pronounced hop taste, but more body and "kick" than a helles. There's really not much to it.

Noticable hop, not bitter, just tasty. Probably not Saaz as I guess in the smell, it's more likely Hallertauer. A hint of frutiy, which isn't to style, rides along with the chalky character of the Vienna malt. Mediuim mouthefeel, a nice example of the style.","mentor","Mar 10, 2005"

A little more amber color than a pilsner usually is, but it just looks delicious in the glass. The smell is staightforward malt and hops. Taste is outstanding. Perfect balance to my taste. Bready malt flavor balanced nicely with hops that are not overpowering, bitter or dry. Just right. Mouthfeel is good. Not thin, not thick. Carbonation is right on. Very, very, very drinkable.

When I drink a pilsner, I expect a more carbonated, light-bodied beer with a pretty light taste and a crisp finish. If you had handed me an unmarked glass of this brew I would have guessed it was an amber ale and would have said lots of very complimentary things about it - it's a complex, well-balanced brew.

The sweet malt backbone is well balanced by the bittering and aromatic Hallertau hops which lend considerable bittering. This one finishes clean and dry. This may be the best Pilsner I've ever sampled. Certainly, the best American pilsner I've had.

Head becomes spotty and quickly fades; clings slightly before sliding down edges of glass. Aroma has a soft, cookielike malt basis--shortbread?--with slightly fruity hops rounding out. Good, clean lager flavor, although as the color would suggest, a bit bolder and nearer to a pale lager than most of the other pilseners I've had. Flavors are nicely balanced, though: bread-and-buttery maltiness finishing with slightly lemony hops. Mouthfeel not quite as light and refreshing as other pilseners--again, a pilsener leaning towards pale lager; still, this has a smooth, medium fullness to the body which is consistent from start to finish. Highly drinkable; mellow flavor combined with satisfying body. One of my staple beers... a good beer for everyday drinking.","NearerMyBeerToMe","Nov 26, 2003"
3,-16.4,3,3,3,3,3,"Medium amber color. Small head. Aroma is malty and slightly sweet. A medium bodied pilsner. Darker colored and very malty and hoppy for a pilsner. Perhaps it supposed to be a cross between a Pilsner and an amber? Malts are nutty and slightly sweet. Hops are citrusy. Touch of orangish flavor in the taste. I'm not sure what this beer is supposed to be, it not a pilsner and not an amber or Vienna. Its somewhere between the two and gets sort of lost somewhere along the way. Its drinkable but lacks any sort of identity. Mouthfeel is round. Finish is dry. Aftertaste is slightly bitter.","beerguy101","Sep 13, 2003"

A slight chill haze is evident. The aroma has a noticeable malt component backed by the crisp yet spicy hallertau hops. The taste shows a bit of malt sweetness up front, with excellent hop levels in the mid, which results in good bitterness on the finish. The aftertaste is comprised of the lingering hops, but a bit of the malt sweetness reappears after a few seconds. The mouthfeel is solid for a pilsner, with just enough carbonation to lend a crispness to the palate. The drinkability is also very good, as this balanced beer is very enjoyable and goes down smooth.

I was again surprised by this beer and its interpretation of a pilsner style...only small bitter notes and not too much sharpness or crispness. The mouthfeel was good; lighter body, with good prickliness on the tongue. While this was definitely a new pilsner experience for me, I was impressed by its honest, easy-drinking, and quality taste.
