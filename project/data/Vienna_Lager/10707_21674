3.54,2.3,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.75,3.5,"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a medium coppery amber with a one finger ivory head kept intact by constant carbonation. Aroma of sweet caramel malt with a touch of toasted malt, mildy spicy. Flavor is biscuit and lightly toasted malt, starts semi-sweet but turns somewhat dry, light grassy hops and hints of wheat and grain. Finishes with earthy malt and light vegetal notes. Medium bodied with nice carbonation. A satisfactory example of a traditionally laid back style. Nothing too exciting here, but it is what it sets out to be, a decent budget Vienna lager. Finish is slightly off, but otherwise a pleasant accompaniment for a meal or sessioning.","LiquidAmber","Dec 13, 2013"

Interestingly, this ends up being a good thing, tasting pretty...tasty. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a smooth feel.

3.97,14.7,3.5,4,4,4,4,"TJ's Vienna Lager. I can see there's a little bit of slightly yellowed tan to the creamy one-finger head. Nice. The body is clear with a deep-amber/copper color. Pretty good head retention. Decent lacing. The aroma is solid, with a clean, distinctly grainy maltiness that's nutty and subtly caramelish. I don't find any hops, but they are there in the flavor - floral and spicy - backing the toasty maltiness. It's rich, but I don't want to say rich, I don't want to give the impression that it's bigger than it is. There's just the right amount of maltiness to it! And there's just enough Vienna malt in the grain bill that it's toasty, nutty and delicately caramelish with an almost fruity side as well. (Don't ask me to explain that, I can't, I don't know where it comes from but I find it in quite a few Vienna lagers/Maerzens where the grain bill has enough Vienna malt to do it). As usual, it's really well rounded with a malt focus and hop-spice accent; and it's perfectly balanced by a stiff bitterness that allows the malt to shine but keeps it from becoming cloying. It finishes dry, but with some residual malt and hops lingering behind. This can be a hard style to do because it's easy to go too light or too full, but they've nailed it. I'd even prefer this to some of the more watered-down versions coming out of Germany for Oktoberfest these days. Really nice! Worth trying!","NeroFiddled","May 15, 2009"

Taste is mostly mildly sweet malts, not too sweet but a nice balance for drinking with food. Mouthfeel is pretty good although it's a little clingy. Very drinkable and could be sessioned. Excellent beer for less than $1.","Duster72","Apr 09, 2007"
3.56,2.9,4.5,3.5,3,3.5,4.5,"So, yeah, a nice quaffable beer with a good malt presence. At less than a buck a beer, I can't complain, but I can get better beers for that price. I grabbed a single of their Weizen while I was at the store, and I am wishing that I had bought a sixer of the Weizens and a single of the Vienna. But I'm not unhappy with the sixer of vienna -- and I rarely buy beers by the sixpack. So, take that as you will.","shbobdb","Apr 01, 2007"

Nothing special but decent bang for the buck and could easily be sessionable if one were so inclined.","daliandragon","Feb 26, 2007"
3.85,11.3,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Highly transparent amber, with an ok head, but not so good retention. The nose is malty and unremarkable, the taste is the same, but very well balanced, and quenching. The mouthfeel is predictably smooth, and the drinkability high. Great session beer, not terribly special, but very well done.","jeffjfindley","Feb 21, 2007"
3.6,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Clean, medium-copper body with light golden edges. Small, filmy, off-white head. Nose is caramel cookie malts, cooked veggies, and spicy, if a bit mild, hops. Toasted, slightly hoppy flavors up front. Solid cookie dough malt follows. Gets more vegetal, spicy, and caramelly. Finish shows mild hop bitterness and lasting caramel cookie dough. Not bad. Moderate body with a slightly soapy feel. Another decent cheap brew from TJs.","alexgash","Feb 06, 2007"
3.52,1.7,3,3.5,3.5,3,4,"Throws a rich, golden copper color; stringy, well disciplined white bubbly head. The nose quickly reveals malts, clean hops and traces of toasted rye bread. Caramelized, sweet dark malts, dry roasted peanuts on the initial quaffs. Medium bodied, twangy, bubbly carbonation. Underlying yeast gives way to some notes of wheat crackers and kisses of bitter hops. A bit metallic and a sweet, gummy, fresh bread finish. Pretty good stuff.","GeoffRizzo","Jan 16, 2007"

3.53,2,3,2.5,4,3.5,4,"Bronzed straw with a slightly copper/amber color, clear, average appearance. When poured into a pint glass the head is a lightly golden cream color. The aroma is dominated by a sweet honey character, with an underlying maltiness. There's also a slight hoppiness to the aroma, and a bit of funk. Somewhat offputting at first. On the palate it starts off sweet, with the honey coming on first. This turns into a pleasing malty flavor, with toasted grain and a light kiss of hops, and finally finishes clean and dry. Not much lingering flavor besides a pleasant grain-like aftertaste. Quite good for the price, though I don't know the style well enough to comment on this beer's particular adherence to a Vienna Style Lager.","pietro9","Dec 11, 2006"
3.86,11.6,4,3,4,4,4.5,"The score seems high to me, too, but I'm reminded that we review beer with style in mind. The Vienna style isn't something that has much of an elite quality to it but the ""Trader Joe's"" (like many BA's, I know who brews this stuff) version is quite solid. Exceptionally drinkable, flavorful and a beer I can imagine pairing with a good number of cuisines.","malcontent","Dec 08, 2006"
3.65,5.5,2.5,2.5,4,4,4.5,"Pours a tawny orange with stunning clarity. One and 3/4 finger head of medium density and moderate retention and produces almost no lacing. Mild toasty nose with hints of dextrins. Sweet pale malt and wheat hit the tounge first, followed by toasty Vienna and Crystal malt. Dry aftertaste exhibits spicy saaz and tettnanger flavor, as well as some dextrionous, grainy character. Medium bodied with an even carbonation that allows a slightly crisp mouthfeel while keeping the rich malt notes alive. Finishes with mellow Crystal and Vienna toastiness and pale malt/wheat malt residual sweetness. Lasting noble hop flavor also provides a magnificent balance and promotes the high drinkability. Not outstanding, but it is well-made, inexpensive, and a great example of the style.","PBRstreetgang","Nov 17, 2006"

Aroma of toasted caramel malt, some light adjunct malt, German lager yeast, and just a touch of hops, along with some notes of bread and light caramel. Palate is sweet and malty, with a nice biscuity character. Aftertaste is slightly astringent. Body is nice and substantial for a lager. The noticeable alcohol prevents this beer from becoming an all-day session type, but it's still quite drinkable. For the price at TJ's, it's difficult to beat in its category.","ElGordo","Apr 18, 2006"

3.53,2,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours with a brilliantly clear deep copper almost amber color. It is topped by a frothy, approaching creamy, tan head that comes about from a slight carbonation. The aroma is almost non-existent, but for a lightly toasted biscuit type maltiness and a suggestion of spicy hoppiness. The taste is lightly sweet up front with malty notes of caramel. The finish is lightly spicy with a hint of balancing bitterness that comes to dominate the finish, but in a good way as it makes you want to take another sip. This is a simple brew, it is nice and refreshing, but is lacking a depth of flavor that I would like to see in a Vienna Lager.","Gueuzedude","Mar 22, 2005"

It is a mellow sweetness, which is good, and also why I probably can't figure it out. Some malt in that sweetness and just noticeable hops. The aftertaste is one of the better ones for a beer. It stays there and subtley reminds you to take another pull if you wait too long. Not an overpowering beer but solid in a lot of ways and did its job while I prepared stir-fry for dinner.
