"Overall: Iv said it before and ill say it again. Great Lakes makes some of the best lagers i have had from this country. I think a lot craft beer enthusiasts get lost in the double and imperial beers and cant appreciate a well crafted lager. For what this is, its pretty amazing and the benchmark for an amber lager in my opinion. Great balance between malts and hops, yet light enough so you know its a lager. Along with Dortmunder Gold, this is my go to lawn mowing, bbq lager of choice. That's all folks"
""
"Overall: I remember why I fell in love with this beer - my first microbrew back in 2002.  Perfectly satisfying interplay between malt and hops with a slight tilt toward malt.  It's a solid, reliable favorite that I will return to again and again. (Although perhaps not quite true to style)."

"Great example of what an amber lager should be like! Slightly hopped, and with some pleasant spicy overtones, it almost makes driving to West Virginia (where I got it) worth it! Nice head as well despite a lousy poor on my part. Good stuff here!"
""
"By far the most complex Vienna-style I've ever encountered. Points for uniqueness. Heavy biscuit on the front leads to a surprising floral-esque finish. Quite boozy for the style at 6.2% ABV - and it can be felt as the beer is much heavier than say Boston Lager. As far as this style goes, I wish this one was lightened up a little bit. All in all it is a fantastic unique beer. Cheers!"

"Very drinkable beer.little bit of malt balance with a spiced dark fig finish. Good beer always inth mix pack"

"It's been a while since I've had the Eliot Ness as I have been in the bubble of IPAs and DIPAs for some time and all I can say is that this beer put a huge smile on my face and delighted my taste buds. This is sweet and candied and has a super nice perfume like finish...which is amazing! I forgot how good this beer is and how nice it is to step out of the IPA haze and appreciate a style that is different but equally satisfying. This is more malty and is not very bitter. A very delicious beer that I will be drinking more of!"

""
""
"My first Bee, and a beer that I will never forget. A strong dark taste, very special. I could see this being off setting for light beer drinkers, but if you want a full on dark beer look no further."
""
""
"This is a solid, very flavorful lager. I don't particularly like the mouthfeel, and it comes across a little dry on the flavor, as well, but it's a good brew to pair with food."
""
""
"An interesting year round beer from GLBC"
""
""
""
"Overall this is a fantastic lager by Great Lakes..this beer definitely doesn't lack on flavor and is one you can drink and not get tired of. I'll definitely be pickin this up more often"
"Very bitter pale aftertaste. Good Amber but a lot better out there."
""
"Clean, refreshing, and flavorful. A well done Amber Lager."
""
""
"Overall: A fantastic beer, looking to find more by this brewing company."
"Rich, clear dark amber color. Solid head retained throughout. Excellent rich malt flavor with just the right amount of hoppy tang. An excellent lager, with the Dortmunder Gold a very close runner up!"
"Overall: A little bit sweet at first, with caramel and toffee notes, hint of nut flavor. Solid and smooth feel to it. Just a really good brew."

"Just an average amber ale."

"Malty sweet with caramel after the initial assault of grapefruit hops which is uncharacteristic of the German version. The hop settles down as the caramel malt and sweetness predominate. Perhaps this should be a new style: ""Americanized Vienna Lager"". There is also a bitter hop note in the finish but overall an excellent example of the style. As a fan of Negra Modelo and Dos Equis I had to try this based on the glowing reviews here at BA."
""
""
""
""
"Definitely a very flavorful beer. There's a lot to like here, easily one of the best lagers I have ever tried. Another great beer from Great Lakes."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: just an awesome example of what an American brewed Vienna lager can be. It's very refreshing but still complex and refeshing. You have no idea it's over a 6abv drinking it. It's follows German purity law and still has great flavor and great refeshment. Just a really good brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Dark red/amber in color, caramel/nut/malt flavor.  Mild bite aftertaste but not offensive at all.  Very smooth and drinkable, goes well with meat and potatoes or just some potato chips."
"Overall: Quite a nice beer, reminds me a bit of a good German lager. Well done, Great Lakes!"
"The World Class flavor profile is intense, complex and a masterpiece in balance.  It begins with creamy blend of toffee and caramel against a slight sweetness that has a cracker character.  In the middle, a nice noble hop flavor emerges over a mild bitterness.  Against a fading bitterness, a nice spicy hop character emerges that is a bit tart, a bit clove like and has a pepper aspect - outstanding.  The finish is a bit dry, but also has a sweet biscuit component.  A slightly tart note lingers for a bit over a receding caramel and biscuit sweetness leaving the tongue with a slight pucker."
"Overall, I would make this a regular in my fridge to offer to any and all! And I would score points with the wife too. ISO!!!"
""
""
""
""
"Medium malt with a faint roast but a high boozy finish"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Deep reddish brown hue, very little head, lots of bubbles throughout. Slightly fruity, slightly spicy hop presence on nose... clean malt profile, slightly bready. Crisp and clean with some nice bite (bit of rye?)...Smooth flavors overall. Malt forward yet nicely balanced. Bit of grassy hop on the finish. Light to medium viscosity, nice bready aftertaste (light). Excellent lager (and I'm not crazy about lager). Great Lakes keeping it classy."
"My next go-to amber lager"

"Good amber lager, pretty smooth"
""
""
""
"Overall: Crisp, clean, well balanced, with a nice mouthfeel"
""
""
""
""
"Looks beautiful with a deep amber body and tan head. No suspended yeast or floaties makes for a very polished look. Scent is in the background, nothing pronounced other than a malt blend. Taste begins with mostly malts, then gives way to hops. Notes of red apple were also present. Mouthfeel is soapy and carbonated with significant, and a surprising amount of alcohol warmth for a 6.2% ABV lager. Overall, a solid anytime beer. Great first impression with Great Lakes!"

"What Yuengling was when it was cool."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- A unique and memorable lager. This is a good one to sip on as it is not super light but has plently of flavor. Not the everyday lager for sure. A great beer to try to divert oneself from the norm. Another Great Lakes home run."

"I prefer their Dortmunder Gold, but this is an extremely well-made and clean representation of a Vienna Lager. Sweet, bready malts, a bit of honey, and a crisp, clean finish. This is on par with Devil's Backbone's Vienna."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  This is the way lagers should taste.  The macro-brews obviously have nothing on this.  I was very impressed with it overall, and the fact that it was on draught made me a very happy man.  I would definitely get this again (and probably will)."

"O: [3.50] This beer is what really opened the door to craft beer for me.  It has a special place in my heart.  It made me realize not everything is BMC swill.  I finally decided to review it (after reviewing 100 other beers).  This is a great gateway beer for BMC drinkers.  It has some added depth and complexity while not being ""scary"".  The flavor profile is nice and the body, and lack of presense of the alcohol, make it a great lawn mower beer."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is an excellent V. Lager...probably sets the bar for this side of the pond.  A very fine beer...another winner from Great Lakes."
""
""
"O: Nothing to complain about. Very good overall and worth buying anytime but strong for me at over 6% ABV. GLBC rocks!"
""
"O: I have yet to encounter another Vienna lager that's comparable to this one. It's virtually everything I could look for in this style, from the complex malt profile to the slight hop presence and the silken mouthfeel. This is a staple of my beer enjoyment."

"Serving type: bottle."
""

"O- Excellent take on the style, as I would expect from GLBC and their tradition of brewing excellent lagers. Why I never reviewed this before, I'm not sure, but I ought to get around to reviewing their other offerings as well! [4.25]"

"Deep, rustic red in color with a light haze. Poured with a creamy, rich, off-white foam that left a ladder of sticky lacings on the glass. Sweet, earthy grain and light herbal hop aromas. Medium bodied with rich, creamy smooth carbonation and a crisp, light tangy hop bite near the end. Sweet toasted caramel malt flavors up front with toffee and herbal hop notes into the middle. Tangy, earthy, crisp hop flavor through the middle that transitions back to sweet caramel and toasted malt. Finished cleanly with a bready, very sweeytoasted malt aftertaste. A generally neglected and underappreciated style that leans to that sweet, maltier side."

"Overall: This beer is good and better than most in its category, but it really isn't anything too special. It's extremely drinkable but there are beers that ought to satisfy you just as much for much cheaper. Look for Grain Belt Nordeast if you want a similar experience for much less."

"Poured into a pint glass, this is a walnut-colored beer, which developed a good half-inch of persistent foam on top. Good malt aroma--rather bread-crusty with a caramel hint. I expected more malt in the taste--it's there, but the moderately high bitterness cuts into it a bit. Not much hop flavor, and it's very clean, yeast-wise. A quite drinkable beer, but the taste isn't all that interesting."

"Great Lakes Brewing Elliot Ness pours a murky Amber/Brown...Virtually zero aroma~ Just a touch of yeast and bread on the nose~ mouthful is medium, not to heavy not to watery~Great Lakes balances this 6.2 ABV very well, good hop tones, good malt tones~ Tart, a bit of sweet fruit, a bit of bread, some honey, a touch of caramel, a touch of apple and a touch of citrus~ It's complex, yet no one flavor really is over barring~ clean crisp and smooth~ Just a good smooth beer built for quantity drinking~ Overall: 9.1"
"O - excellent example of Vienna Lager."

"O - Very tasty beer. I would pair it with some fried chicken and waffles."
""
"Overall: It was fair, but for a similar style I would pick Yeungling all day over this, its half the price and you can session the hell out of them. To me a lager is meant to be consumed in quantity, maybe they were shooting for quality, but if I go to a lager, its a warm/hot day and I want to drink at least a six pack. This one I could not do that with."

"O: This beer has 'it' - it just seems to have more pizzazz than other examples of the style. Basically, it's the best Vienna I've ever had. The complexity of this really caught me off guard, too. I contemplated buying a 6-pack of this beer - and honestly, I really should have. This one bottle I got isn't enough."

"Poured a deep clear amber with a thick creamy white head. The head has great retention and leaves great lacing. The aroma is rich and malty, with bread and burnt sugar. The taste is equally rich, with nice caramel malt flavors and just a hint of hops on the finish. It has a great mouthfeel and is all around a top notch amber lager."
""
"O-another solid lager from Great Lakes. this is very drinkable, looks great, smells great, and tastes great. I've been a big fan of GL's Dortmunder Gold, but this may surpass it. might have to have a few more before I make that official. either way a highly recommended amber lager."

"East to drink lager that won't offend anyone. An acceptable amount of character here, but I'd personally prefer a bit more vibrancy. Worth checking out if you're in the market for a session beer that won't weigh you down."
""
""
""
"Dark amber with a thick tan head. Good retention throughout and nice lacing. Hoppier than most lagers but not overbearing. Taste is awesome. bold malt profile balanced with an almost sour hop profile on the back end. Mouthfeel is perfectly smooth with a great aftertaste. Overall this is the best lager out there today. This beer is what Sam Adams is trying to be, Great beer!"

"Overall/Comments: Another awesome brew from GLBC that is an excellent example of the style and a world class must try offering. Has an excellent flavor profile that is just complex enough to keep you coming back for more! Classified as a Vienna Lager @ 6.2% ABV. Consumed 8/13/2013."

"Pours out translucent brown in color with a small white head that dissipates quickly. Smell is of sweet malt, definitely some caramel in there, really smell sweet. Taste is really nice. Taste is definitely sweet with everything in the nose but a SLIGHT bit of bitterness from the hops that I didn't notice in the nose. Mouthfeel is fairly thin as one would expect from a lager. Overall I really like this beer. Definitely one of the better lagers I have tasted in a long time."

"O: Not my favorite GLBC brew, but a great, solid lager."
"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a bright, vibrant, rich, amber coloring with a slow flow of carbonation bubbling and a filmy, wispy, low profile, off-white head. Looks fantastic. Aromas of rich caramel and nut, blended and balanced very well. Roasted notes throughout. Flavors are roast forward, with nut and toffee all over the forward tongue. Subtle hops bitterness in the tail end of the palate, with an overall tangy sweet feel. The aftertaste is roasted and tangy sweet, with highlights of sugary caramel. Smooth, light, and slightly crisp body, with a slight cloying linger in an otherwise clean finish. Great beer."

"That is not to say this is a bad beer. I find it less bitter than some amber beers I've had (although they may be more ales). In comparing this to Devil's Backbone version of a Vienna Lager, I enjoyed DB slightly better (granted, I had the DB from tap, not bottle, and sadly, didn't rate here to compare). In both cases, I think the complexity is minimal, which might make these beers more appealing to a larger crowd."
""
""
""
""
"Full bodied, flavor really lingers nicely for a while. Great carbonation level and not really much of a bite anywhere. Starts smooth with a subtle bite at the finish. Great drinkability on this one. This is something any beer lover could regularly have in their fridge. I understand why this is a year round brew from Great Lakes, great beer on in what my opinion is a fairly under appreciated style."
"Overall: Another great brew from Great Lakes. Full of flavor and does not disappoint!"

""
""

"A first class Lager. Maybe the best. I have about 8 types of Lagers in my fridge and I think the others will have to wait. Great Lakes hit it perfect."

" The taste is great a good bready quality which has the toastiness of vienna malt with a slight flavor of caramel backing and the malt is balanced well by an herbal hop flavor. The sweetness is a little more noticeable than when I tried this on draft, but I didn't check the bottled on date either. I like this beer a lot it is perfect for a single beer to sip or for pairing with food a very good representation of the style with plenty of flavor."

"Pours a dark brown/mahogany color with a foamy off-white head that stays for a while. Slight amount of lacing is left behind. Sweet smell of malt, raisins, molasses -- really nice. Taste is also slightly sweet with a raisin aftertaste. Very robust and ""thick," but still easy to drink. Could see this as a great Thanksgiving brew."
"Nice ruby red color with small light tan head and moderate, messy lacing. Aroma has strong maltiness with a bit of deep fruity, vinous notes. Flavor is all malts with a sweet finish. Mouthfeel is light and crisp. This is so refreshing and easy to drink- really great overall."

"Tied with Samuel Adams Boston Lager as my favorite Vienna-style lager, which is my favorite non-seasonal beers style (although double/imperial IPAs are catching-up). Yes, I am quite biased in favor of Great Lakes Brewing Company because one of my best friends worked there for nine years and I've spent many a fine afternoon/evening at the place. But my preference for GLBC beer is primarily because the beers are almost always outstanding. Cheers!"
""
""
""
"This is my favorite Great Lakes regular offerings. It's a good fallback beer to have if nothing else is available that piques your curiosity. It is an almost perfect combination of malt and hops and is good on all but the most oppressively hot days."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is string, rich caramelised toast, strong woody herbal hop, toasty, peppery, woody herbal bitterness. It has frim balanced character, complexity, a warm winy-toasty-dried fruit malty sweetness to round out the hop."

"As reviewers wrote perhaps the best in the Vienna lager style, but in the end I prefer Kolsch and IPA. Great brewery."
"From its beautiful amber color and thick, rich head, to its smooth taste and solid mouthfeel, this is a superb lager. Just the right amount of sweetness and maltiness, and good balance of alcohol and flavors. It's easy to see why this is the top-rated Vienna Lager on BA. I found this thoroughly refreshing and fairly complex for such an easy drinker. Very satisfying."
""
"Dare I say....a near perfect beer. I think that Great Lakes does some great work provided the experience I have had with their brews (which isn't a whole lot.) This is a beer that I could enjoy any time of the year and it would seem perfectly fitting. To be honest, I can enjoy any beer any time of the year, but this one would seem appropriate in each location and season. It is light in flavor yet rich at the same time. Chewy yet would be very easy on someone who doesn't like a heavy and viscous brew. I tend to lean towards a hoppier beer for everyday drinking (APA, A-IPA and E-IPA) and I also drink a lot of stouts and porters, but this a great lager. I hold this beer on the same pedestal as I would place Victory Prima Pils...another near perfect brew."

"Overall: I could easily see myself grabbing a few sixers of this every single time I'm out of New England. Actually, I might single handedly try to get Great Lakes to distribute to New England. What an awesome brew and at 8-9 bucks a sixer for such a premium beer is pretty much unbeatable. Wow."
""
""
"This beer has a malt sweetness which reminds me of Sam Adams Octoberfest, however it also has a hop bitterness which comes through unlike the Octoberfest. This beer gives me flashbacks to the better bodied, sweet and malty Octoberfest style beers I tried (like the Sam Adams) but with a hop character added in. The malt character is very good, and the hop component is tasteful. Overall a great beer!"

"Pours a perfect amber with a 2 finger khaki head, not sure if its the beer or my pour but wow, that looks amazing. As the head resides lacing is clinging to every inch. Smells sweet with a bit of a grassy tone. Taste is top notch, not too sweet or malty, balanced through and through. I've never been a huge fan of this style but this is a hell of a beer. Quality is the key word here. Where i live you can find this in just about every store that sells beer, huge plus. It's also as reasonably priced as craft beer gets at around 8 bucks a sixer. This is a wonderfully crafted and brewed beer that should be tried by anyone who can get their hands on it."

"A hazy, dark orange-amber colored brew with a huge eggshell colored head and decent lacing. The aroma offers a somewhat cider-like malt and maybe a touch of raisin-nutmeg. Nice. The flavor is mnearly identical to what i smell, malt being dominant but some dark fruit hints and a pleasant spice quality. It's a smooth, medium-light bodied brew with vibrant but tasteful carbonation and a fairly lush feel for a lager. Overall an impressive lager, one of the better ones of the new breed of unique lagers in the new craft beer world."

"o: A tasty, highly sippable amber ale. I'd definitely buy this again, although it is perhaps less a summer brew than IPAs, Pilseners or lighter Lagers."

"Pours clear and copper, when held to the light exhibits a ruby hue. Scant finger of foam that fell fast to a thin ring and light dusting on top. Leaving lace though. Nose is outrageous. Lager nose, good malt, bread, grain, sweet toffee. Lightly sugary. Hops are floral elegance with hints of strawberry that remind one of sunshine. Grass, apple and faint spice. Taste is heaven. Really good bread and a deep but light sweetness. Fruits and pale malts dancing with one another on the palate. Hops take the finish with just the right amount of earth, bitter and oil plus a delightful touch of honey for a luxurious aftertaste. Nectar. Carbonation is medium, mouthfeel is thin. It drank simply and light. Honestly one of the best beers I have ever had."

"O: A very satisfying brew, exactly what you would expect from GLBC. This beer pairs very well with food and is quite versatile. This beer really doesn’t have any flaws actually."
""
""
""
""
"O: Not many good Vienna Lagers out there but this is one of the good ones. Perhaps the best, I'd prefer this to a Sam Adams Boston Lager, myself. Lighter, smooth and malty beer with just a hint of hops. Pretty much exactly what you'd expect, just well executed and tasty. Very drinkable to boot."
""
""
""
"D: I remember this being slightly more hoppy and that probably has to do with freshness. while this brew is within its shelf-life, it has definitely lost a bit of hop aroma and bite. otherwise, pretty outstanding example of an American made Vienna lager."
""
""
""
""
"A-"
"Overall, a solid everyday brew. A little darker and heavier in flavor than most lagers of its type, but still a beer to drink regularly."

"This brew absolutely blew me away. Normally lagers and and amber lagers are good, but never really exciting. This is it. The sweet, excellent smells are mirrored so well by the taste. It's been a long while since my expectations were surprised this much. In my opinion this is the best lager available. I will definitely get it again."
""
""

"Overall - Really, one of my favorites go-to brews. Drinks so easy. I like the honey/sweetness because there is substance to it but it could be too much for some."

""

"O- I have not had many Vienna Lagers, but this is the best one I have had. Wish I could get this by me. Well balanced, flavor is not overpower, but it is not weak or watered down."

"O - Very nice lager. Much more flavor than I was expecting. The malt profile was very nice and well balanced. The hops was noticable on the finish."
""
""
""
"Overall a really good lager. I am more of an ale guy, but this one is really solid and may cause me to give more lagers a look."

"The visual appearance of this beer was a light brown or amber color. The smell of it was very rich and had a slightly malty smell to it. The taste was sour and rich with possibly a little bit of bitterness. This beer overall was just O.K. to me. It did have a very nice aroma to it especially right out of the bottle."

"12 ounce bottle into lager glass, best before 3/4/2013. Pours slightly hazy orange copper color with a 1-2 finger dense cream colored head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with moderate streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of caramel, pear, apple, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, floral, and herbal earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance of malt and fruity notes with good complexity; good strength as well. Taste of caramel, pear, apple, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, floral, light pepper, and herbal earthiness. Lingering notes of caramel, light fruit, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, floral, and herbal earthiness on the finish for a bit. Great balance of malt, hops, and fruity ester flavors; with a nice amount of robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and lightly creamy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with almost zero warming after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic Vienna lager! Great balance of malt and fruity ester flavors with good robustness; and very easy to drink. A highly enjoyable offering."

"Poured a gorgeous ruby-amber color with nice carbonation that resulted in a fluffy 1/2 inch head. Don't smell much that pops out in a good or bad way so I'll take that to mean this is gonna taste ""safe"" at very least. Nice, crisp, slightly malty, just a pinch bitter, understated. The beer is crisp, a touch watery and goes down easy leaving the touch just a little bitter after all is said and done. This one is really good if you are looking for something in the amber part of the spectrum. Can't imagine this every wearing on me."
""
"Overall: I think this is one of the best beers being made in the United States. Complexity is off the charts. I love that I can get this beer at most places in my area. This is one of the beers I always recommend to those looking to have a great beer without having much beer knowledge. Simply fantastic."
""
""
"It doesn't really taste like a lager to me, at least as far as the usual German lagers go. It tastes like.. well.. cardboard. My girlfriend said it after taking a sip, and I was amazed, because that same description was in my head the instant I tried it. It tastes like a combination of watered-down whiskey and cardboard. I hope something was wrong with the tap at that place, because it's hard to believe this is the beer that's getting such excellent reviews. The color seems to match though - a dark amber. So, it's definitely ""unique"" but I won't be drinking it again."
"I've been to Munich, Germany and Great Lakes is the next best thing in the U.S. for the greatest lager out there. Perfect, delicious lager and it follows the beer purity laws. This is high quality stuff right here. Highly recommended. The variety pack is a great place to start for Great Lakes wide array of excellent offerings."

"I love this beer. Great Lakes is an awesome brewery, I love that they're actually trying to do something for the environment/be sustainable/etc. and are still making great beer. This is the best lager, hands down. All-around great, highly recommended."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the nice blending and balance throughout the flavoring, with emphasis on spice and phenols from front to back. This kept things fresh but deep, but made the hops work extra hard for the final mix. The soft slurp was nicely contributory to the experience. This beer stays nice to the style and is easy drinking, making it perfect for a relaxing night watching the game."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: Great Lakes does not mess around with their year round beers. This is another beer that is unbeatable for the price. I haven't had a lager that competes with this one lately. An easily sessional beer that is enjoyable won't break the wallet"

"M/O - Light body, satisfying and highly sessionable brew."
"I am not a huge fan of pilsners or lagers. Jesus Christ, this lager is so good, it has more bite than a Paulaner, but is still so smooth. I enjoy this beer with a carb rich dinner or lunch. The honey after taste is what really makes me indulge when I start drinking these. I understand why this beer is a stand out across the world, even in Germany."

"QUITE GOOD; GRAB A BOTTLE!"

"This poured out as a beautiful clear amber color with an off white head on top. The retention and lacing were very nice on this beer. The smell is malty sweet with some mild earthiness. The taste of the beer is malty with a subtle sweetness and a very mild bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel is soft and creamy with a decent carbonation. Overall it's a really good brew, very surprised with this one... Disappointed I didn't try this one sooner."

"Mouthfeel is fantastic- medium bodied, light to moderate carbonation. This is a great amber lager. Same style as Boston lager but way more flavorful."
""
""
""
"Eliot Ness pours a nice rich amber color with a rosy hue. There is an off white head which leaves a little bit of lacing. The clarity of this beer's appearance allows one to see the constant effervescence. The aroma is clean and crisp with bready notes. There might also be a hint of fruitiness, but the doughy bread is the overwhelming scent. The first sip reveals the rich biscuity caramel notes in addition to the breadiness. The malty notes are balanced with just a hint of bitter hops and there is a lingering boozy alcohol taste at the end. The mouthfeel is crisp and medium bodied with a mild carbonation. It finishes clean with no stickiness. Although Vienna Lagers are not among my favorite styles of beer, this is a great example of one. It is very flavorful and well balanced. I wish I could get this one more frequently."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- a great lager, not quite awe inspiring but definitely recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is an excellent beer and one of my favorites."
""
"The beer is transparenty and amber colored with over an inch of dense, soapy, tan head. The aroma offers malt, lager yeast, fruity notes. The flavor is sweet, with a pronounced lager taste and lingering fruity malts. Biscuits and perhaps some crackers. Light to medium bodied. A bit heavier than your session type lagers. Well done and flavorful, though the sweetness, while not overbearing or cloying, per se, does limit my consumption. A solid beer."
""
""
""
"Wow, this beer really surprised me, although I shouldn't be surprised - I've been very happy with most of GL's brews. Nice mix of hops and malts, not too overpowering on either. Great, crisp finish all around, and certainly one of the best lagers to cross my palate in some time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: Pretty good, but not one I would search out GLBC for. Either too sweet or not enough hops to balance the sweetness."

"Overall a tasty lager that is a smooth and drinkable blend. Isnt overpowering and I think most people could drink and enjoy this beer."

"I thought Dortmunder Gold was one of the best lagers I have had. This is just as good if not more enjoyable for me because the toasted grains are so amazing. One of the best. I can't recommend this enough."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Never been a huge fan of amber lagers, but it’s very nice, biscuity, and clean."
""
""
"Pours a semi-clear amber with good head that fades to a thin lacing. Some very small particles can be seen floating in the light. Smells nice and malty with brown & crystal malts, some caramelization, and a hint of chocolate. Very clean lager aroma. Tastes malty with brown & crystal malts and again with light notes of chocolate at the end. Feels medium and nice assertive bitterness at the front & back end of the malts. Hops don't lend themselves noticeable aroma or flavor, assuming hops were mostly for bittering or they just plain faded in this bottle. Overall, a very well designed & executed beer. GL is quickly becoming a favorite brewery as I try more & more of their beers."

""
""

"Smooth feel. Good carbonation level. Clean and simple is the order of the day with this one. Mild bitterness from the hops, but they don't just add bitterness. They impart a nice flavor as well. A bit of pale fruits round it out, giving this a well balanced profile. This is a nice simple beer that I think is the perfect beer to pair with any food. Glad I got this one."

"O - Honestly, this beer did not meet my expectations. It lacks depth in my opinion, and Samuel Adams Boston Lager is the clear winner when it comes to this category. I'd have another if handed it, but I wouldn't buy it again."
"Very pure and surprisingly hop-forward for the style. I can understand why it's at the top of the pack."

""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I regret that time ran out at last-call and I didn't get to order another!"
""
""
""
""
"A bit more balanced in flavor than indicated by the nose. Some sharp citrus hops cut through the malt to make their presence felt. The malt flavors match the nose with the addition of burnt and alcohol notes. Rich, bold, and flavorful. May not be to everyone's taste, but this is quality stuff from a brewery that knows theirs."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall, I'm glad I randomly picked this up in a mix-a-six at the store I was at. I was glad to see these ratings when I got home, and even happier when I poured the glass and took a sip. This is even MORE enjoyable to me considering I've had a lot of super hoppy beers/IPAs recently. It's nice to have something a bit malty after so much of that. All-in-all, a great beer. Some may be turned off by its sweetness, but that's what I think I love about this beer. The sweetness and bitterness just works very well. Would definitely get this one again."
""
""
""
""
""
"D: High, dangerously high. If I lived in Ohio I'd be buying this by the six pack."
""

"I do greatly enjoy Great Lakes Edmund Fitzgerald Porter as well as Dortmunder Lager. I'm not afraid to say however that my opinion of the Elliot Ness Amber Lager greatly differs from the common opinion of the experts..who like it a lot. I don't care for it very much."

"Had this from a bottle back in Michigan. A deep brown amber color with super creamy white head. Aroma of toffee malts, caramel, fruits. Flavor follows with a beautifully sweet fruit-caramel combination. Extremely smooth mouthfeel with medium carbonation. What an incredible lager this is. Finishes clean, fills the mouth with flavor. Wow."
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: I'm not sure why this beer is so highly acclaimed. It doesn't really live up to the hype for my tastes. I probably won't seek this one out in the future. Although, it gets props for being the best amber/vienna lager I've had."
""
"Overall: This is a great beer all around. Summer is here and this is a solid option when it gets hot."
"O - For the style, one of the best I've ever had. My first chance at Great Lakes and this did not disappoint at all."
""
""
""
"O - a very solid sweet lager light and crispy"
""
"A picture of this beer should be found in the dictionary under “lager.”"
""
"Pours a medium amber, with a quickly disappearing cream colored head. Scent of toasty malts, caramel, biscuit, and a touch of hops. Taste follows nose with prominent notes of sweet toasted malts, toffee, and a fresh doughy taste. Well balanced mouthfeel with somewhat delicate carbonation rounds out this brew. Another solid beer from Great Lakes."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Although a tad higher ABV than most lagers, well worth the exchange for the entire flavor this Vienna Lager has. A lingering sweet malty finish is what I enjoyed the most. I could easily see myself buying another 1/6th keg of this. This quasi-session beer could easily steer me to having a few in one sitting. A great all year round brew from Great Lakes. The Edmund Fitzgerald Porter is still my favorite from this brewery but this one sure comes in a close second. Well done!!"

""

""

"12 oz bottle. Pours amber with a long lasting white head and nice lacing. Aroma is of caramel malt and noble hops, hints of cherries. Body is medium and slightly crisp. Taste is of caramel malt in the beginning followed by herbal, earthy hops. Finish is long and dry. Nicely balanced excellent brew."
""

"O: a nice complex refreshing lager, awesome."

"Pours a rich, deep amber color, with a modest beige head on top. The aroma is subdued but comforting, with a combination of musty hops and a light bready sweetness. The flavor is much more potent, with big notes of fruity, sweet, and nutty malts being balanced by a dull, musty, earthy character. These flavors are bold and complex at first, but the flavor becomes muddier as the beer opens up, with just a bit of an uncomfortable astringency and an alcohol burn (either that or this beer just pairs miserably with goldfish crackers). The texture is a bit resinous and almost syrupy, which is less desirable than the crisp, clean character that is the hallmark of most lagers, but it goes down fine. Overall, this rich, flavorful lager has some flaws, but I still wouldn't hesitate to buy it again."

"T: Begins with dark, sweet malt, and then a grassy hops enters. Very crisp. A good amber lager, but nothing adventurous. Very well balanced."
"O: Kind of ""meh"" for me. One of those good and bad beers. When I drink a lager, I want something that's crisp, and this beer doesn't have that. Decent flavor, but falls a bit short elsewhere."
"Appearance is a copper color with two fingers of head, that with a couple sips turns to a nice ring of lace. Its` nose has bread, caramel and some fruit. The taste has toasted malts, fairly sweet, very nice in general. Mouthfeel is medium and has a crisp finish. This is tasty beer, wish we had distribution of this in CT."
""
"O - A very well balanced red lager. Its not my prefered style, but it is very very good if you are into this type!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours cloudy copper to an ambered brown with a small light brown rocky head. Sweet malted barley with sugary notes and a hoppy nose with vanilla hints. Warm and sweet creamy caramel flavor greets your tonue with the first draw and leaves you with a creamy hoppiness. Medium-bodied and creamy/fizzy palate."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I've never been a big fan of Vienna Style Lagers, but this was pretty good! It's got just the right amount of sweetness combined with a rather simple flavor and that's good enough for me."
""
""
""
""
"O- this is a solid amber lager. I'd drink this over Yuengling every day of the week, but I think I prefer Boston Lager overall"
""
""
"O: Who said lagers can't be amazing? Great Lakes has been churning out some of the best in the land...between this and Dortmunder Gold, you should never want for an excellent lager again. A great treasure in this bottle."
"Rock on!"
""
""
""
""
""
"I do not know if I can criticize this beer at all. Just get some and enjoy!"
"O - Great Lakes may have the best ""regular"" line-up of any beer available in my area. The Eliot Ness is a fantastic Vienna Lager and one of the best lagers I've ever had."

"Pours deep amber, bordering on mahogany, with a small head that quickly dissipates into a few lonely islands and a ring around the outer edge. Smells sweet and malty with caramel and toffee right up front, giving way to floral notes with a hint of licorice. Full bodied for a lager. Starts a bit thin but then warms up into a medium mouth feel. Sweet up front giving way to malt complexity and perhaps some spices, such as all spice or coriander, which stays on the palette long after the sip has been swallowed. No bitterness in the finish. Extremely well-balanced. Hits every sense a beer is supposed to."
""
"Overall, pretty well balanced."
""
"O: I'm really starting to become a Great Lakes fan here lately and I'm so happy we now get their stuff here in NOVA. Eliot Ness is another great poolside sipper indeed!"

"O- First I've had from Great Lakes and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Will buy again."
""
"O- a nice well rounded lager"
"This is a really decent beer. It's balanced, flavorful, and drinkable. I will definitely have this again."
""
"The beer poures a solid opaque browm, just a bit dark for an amber. The aroma was a bit malty but nothing special. The taste is slightly malty with a bit of alcohol burn no additional flavors stand out. The feel is medium and wet. Overall an above average beer but nothing special."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a rich, clear copper color with a cream-colored head that lingers just long enough to appreciate. Aroma is mild and slightly sweet. Almost honey-like malt dominates the flavor profile. Hops are faint but noticeable. A little too sweet for my tastes, and not much to offer in the way of complexity. Not bad, but I'd be perfectly fine not having it again."

"This is by far one of my favorite Amber Lagers as well as one of my favorite beers period. I'm a big fan of almost over the top hoppy Lagers and this takes the cake. As soon as you pour this beer the combination of the smell and the red amber appearance make your mouth water. This is one of those craft beers that goes down like an American Light beer. I could have 6 done and not even realize it. Fantastic."
""
""
""

""
""
""
""

"O - A combination of complex flavour and complete refreshment, and the taste lingers surprisingly long in the mouth. At less than $8.00/6 pack this is a mind-blowingly good deal. With 6.2% abv it's a bit robust for a session beer, but my glass is empty and damned if I'm not going to have another."

"I find Eliot Ness to be simply one of those ""fridge"" beers one can enjoy anytime... Definitely a Go To, Everyday beer that's quite drinkable and doesn't kill one's palate. A nice brownish-amber color, crisp somewhat malty nose and a pleasant, smooth taste.. Probably, my favorite lager..."

"It says amber lager on the label. Well, it's amber (and very pretty), and that they say it's lager is a hint that the fermentation is not a top fermentation. You get a very nice malty taste that goes beyond most lagers. It can sometimes have a nasty aftertaste and that's why it is no longer one of my favorites, but it is an exceptional beer."
"Notes: Not much of a palate around Vienna Lagers, so maybe this is closest in my memory to some Marzens… different floral finish maybe, but a nice offering in any case. Overall these are not typical styles I go to, so this might be a review a bit more skewed than usual."

"O: No surprises here: just another incredibly solid beer from Great Lakes. They deliver a beer that has deep favor, a nice balance, and is dangerously drinkable."

"Overall - One of the better examples of the style. It's very drinkable and has the perfect balance of sweet/bitter. Happy I had the chance to try it fresh on tap."
"O: A decent beer with food. Leaves me wanting a little more depth from the malts and some dry hopping with noble hops would be nice for aroma."

"a delicious amber ale thats slightly unconventional. has a very rich earthy smell, while lacking that sugary malt character usually indicative of ambers. the taste is great, featuring a layered malt flavor with a hidden hop presence in the background. a very sessionable amber and one of my favorite brews from great lakes. goes great with a bowl of chili"

"A very good lager from Great Lakes, definitely worth a try."
"Strong golden/amber color with about a finger of white head with little retention. Crisp herbal hop character in the nose along with fresh cracked two-row sweetness and the Vienna toasty caramel. Flavor carries a lot of the malt from the nose. The sweet caramel and rich, lightly toasty malts are smooth and clean. Finishes with herbal hops that have a subtle earthy twist. The toasty grains also carry to the finish melding well with the hop character. Smooth and clean body with a moderate amount of carbonation. Extremely pleased the offerings I have been able to sample from this brewery."
"Great Lakes with a spot on style again. I love a good Vienna lager from time to time and anytime I'm in Ohio or MI I usually grab some of this."
"I should also note that the ""consume by date"" on the sampler case I bought was Nov 7 2011. Today is Nov 1 2011. I was concerned when I saw the date...but the beer is still very fresh and perfect. This tells me that Great Lakes has excellent quality control and really know their product!"
"O: This is a very distinctive Vienna lager, and should be particularly appealing for those who like their lagers on the strong side."
"O) Another very solid offering from Great Lakes Brewing Co."
"O - This beer reminds me so much of a barleywine. It has all the aromas and flavors of a barleywine, but much lighter bodied. Excellent beer."
"O - A wonderful beer. Great balance. Super tasty."
"Light body with a zesty active carbonation that is crisp on the tongue but isn't overly prickly. Easy to drink lager, with a good amount of flavor."
"There is nothing wrong with this beer . . . perfect for the season too. I wish more brewers took the time to construct lagers like this -especially in ""Ale America"". Great job. I really, really liked this beer and could easily put it in regular rotation."
"O- Really, really well done. Again, flavorful without being over the top."
"O- tough to make a call on this one. it looks amazing and feels great but the taste is kind of lame and I detect little to no smell. I probably won't get this again but it's enjoyable in the sampler pack I purchased"
"Quite a nice beer for colder weather and activity. It somewhat reminds me of a british winter warmer, but with the lightness and drinkablity of a lager."
"Overall: Very good brew overall; this is one of my favorite beers around. Not many things to pick at, it has a great mixture of flavor, color and aroma"
"O: Interesting -- a nice beer. I might not drink another, but I suppose I'd tentatively recommend it."
" Pours cloudy copper to an ambered brown with a small light brown rocky head. Sweet malted barley with sugary notes and a hoppy nose with vanilla hints. Warm and sweet creamy caramel flavor greets your tonue with the first draw and leaves you with a creamy hoppiness. Medium-bodied and creamy/fizzy palate."
"Overall: One of the best Vienna Lagers I have had. This one starts like a malt bomb, then surprise the hops rush in. I wish this was around here. I could have several of these."
"Feels lights, but the grain lingers."
"The beer has a medium body and very good carbonation. This has to be one of the smoothest and easiest to drink beers that I have ever had. Overall, defiantly one of the best Vienna Lagers that I have ever had."
"O: Another great beer by Great Lakes Brewing Company. You can just tell by tasting this beer that it is made with quality ingredients"
"O: An extremely well done lager. I very much enjoyed this."
"Overall- First time trying this style so I wasn't sure what to expect. I'ts a pretty well rounded and smooth beer."
"O - An outstanding Vienna lager. One of the best lagers I've ever had and definitely the best Vienna style I've had. Very smooth and refreshing and combines a nice portion of solid flavors. To me this brew was like a meal in a bottle. Great Lakes Brewing Co claim that, ""their flagship beer is more like a fleet", stands true. This is another great year round brew from GLBC."
"Medium body, decent carbonation, a bit prickly on the tongue. A solid drinker, the fruit tones add a nice edge, and I enjoyed the balance of flavor."
"Overall: Easily the best Vienna lager I've had to date."
"Overall: this is a smooth, creamy, tasty and eminently drinkable beer. I just wish Great Lakes were available here in Washington."
"This was a pretty good beer overall. The appearance was pretty unimpressive, but everything else was great. Could see drinking this anytime of year for any occasion."
"Eliot Ness Amber Lager is a very flavorful easy drinking Vienna Lager – well done Great Lakes."
"O: Solid brew however not my favorite. Good to sip on and try but wouldn't go out of my way to find it"
"D/O- Definitely thirst quenching. I'd rank this one a notch lower than Boston Lager on the tastiness scale. Great Lakes Brewing Company, consistent!"
"Another solid brew from Great Lakes. As hearty as a non-bock lager as you're ever going to find!"
"Enjoy!"
"O: really enjoyable brew, drinks smooth, not terribly complex but has a great depth"
"O-this is a pretty well put together lager. its very different in the tastes than any other lager i've had which i really appreciate. its easy drinking as well...though it might not be something i could drink a lot of at one time. the only other vienna lager i've had has been Sam Adams Boston Lager...which seems to be in the amateur league compared to the Eliot Ness."
"Mouthfeel is like with nice carbonation. An easy drinker, I just wish I could buy this in VA, but perhaps that day shall come."
"A really great beer overall. Full-flavored and smooth. Glad I got to try it. Compared to the other popular Vienna lager--Sam Adams--this one is more malty, less hoppy, and overall a bit more flavorful."
"Clear amber gold pour with a nice one inch head initially. Slight orange tinted in color, and once it settles it leaves a good solid quarter inch and little bits of lace behind. Aroma has that yummy Vienna lager grainy, chewy, caramelly scent that I always like. Light Czech. hops add a refreshing edge to it. Taste is smooth with toasty, roasty and nutty grains and carbonation is fine and prickly. Nice balance between bitter and flavor/aroma hops too. Mouthfeel is sliiightly chewy and mostly slick with a touch of grainy texture. Nice array of textures. Overall I like this. I would be happy to have several more...great session beer."
"O: A very tasty beer, I was surprised at how much I liked it, but not really sure why (I was surprised that is). Another solid beer from Great Lakes. Extremely easy drinking."
"Pours a clear, reddish amber under a frothy, lasting off-white head. Sweetish, toasted German malt and nuts aroma...leafy/spicy hop and clean lageriness. Toasted caramel, nutty malt flavor. Earthy, herbal notes with some grassy bitterness and spice. Medium-light and slightly creamy. Another pleasant lager from Great Lakes..."
"O - Very unique. There is a level of deepness to this beer that is just terrific and I feel as though I didn't capture all there is to capture in this one. This is a really good beer, very sessionable, just all around a real pleasure."
"I definitely like this better than the Dortmund which is not to say the Dortmunder is not a very good beer. I like the maltiness that comes through on the Ness. I know that this beer is often compared to Sam Adams Boston Lager. I drink Boston Lager by the yard but I think this might be a little better. At 6.2 ABV this one could sneak up on you and take you down pretty easily."
"O: A really good beer that I would love to taste at the brewery as I bet it's a knockout fresh. A really stout malty body with a great balance of sweetness and noble hopping."
"I poured this beer into a pint glass. It has a amber color body with a nice foamy head that retains quite long. The smell is nice and malty with some spice. The taste is like the smell, malty, sweet, i taste a little spice and some hops. The mouth feel is nice and smooth and goes down very easy. Overall this beer is great."
"O: A good beer, and a shining example of the style. Recommended."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a snifter. Pours a very clear amber color. It's looks remind me of a Red Ale. About a finger of a creamy off white head. Sweet caramel malt really stands out in the nose. Lots of sugar and a small amount of hops also come through. Taste is mainly sweet malt. Reminds me a lot of an overly sugary fruit punch. Light bodied with a low level of carbonation. An interesting Lager but not my kind of beer."
"O- An awesome example of the style and it's very easy to drink"
"O- I was really surprised by how good this lager is, the number one rated Vienna lager for a reason."
"O: The beer is very easy to drink and goes down smoothly."
"Pours a copper/amber with some off-white head, that falls to some bubbles and a bit of foam. Some sediment in the body. Nose hold some bread, cracker, light caramel malt and light hop character. Some slight red apple notes. Taste is crisp initially with a good hop bite, some fresh bread, a solid pale malt base, slight grassiness. Good clean and refreshing feel, with a moderate lingering bitterness. On point for a Vienna lager, just how I like 'em. Absolutely crushable."
"O: yet another wonderful beer from Great Lakes. This brewery exudes quality and good taste."
"Gotta try this again and again. I think I rushed through this most recent sipping - too good."
"O - really excellent beer; very sessionable; plenty of interest; Great Lakes hits another 4-bagger"
"drinkability: high quality lager that one can definitely appreciate, with a higher than usual abv for a lager to go with it, very on-point."
"I am not the biggest GLBC fan but this is perfection. Bravo."
"all that being said, this is perhaps the best lager i have ever had."
"O - Really nice beer and one that I would pick over Yuengling anyday in a bar (can't believe I just said that). Refreshing while giving you a clean malt bill that makes this a solid beer."
"With all the great reviews on this beer, I expected more from it. To me (and my probably undeveloped tastes), this was nothing spectacular. It's good for sure, but nothing I would rave about. The appearance was for me the best part, as it pour a deep amber and white head."
"Poured clear, reddish-brown with a small white head. Caramel maltiness aroma with some light nuttiness. Simply caramel malt smoothness in the taste, with a hint of light hops for balance. Bready, with just a touch of fresh cut grass. Light-medium body and easily drinkable."
"Overall, a fantastic, brood-worthy beer, a very hearty lager"
"Ah, pours a clean brownish red, with a 2 finger head that lays on top of the glass and almost looks like cream as it slimes to the side walls. This fuckers got a big lager scent with a note of spice. Caramel malts, bready, alcohol, cloves, ginger, and a wiff of bittering hops on the end. Sweet and smooth caramel on the tongue, again with the breadiness, nuts and whole grains. Sweet throughout the whole sip until the end, then the hops come into play and give a big biterness on the finish that would otherwise go unoticed. Hearty but not too much, about a medium feel, maybe a light to some, medium carbonation that tickles the tongue, and dry on the finish, pairs fantastic with a big dead animal on your plate. What can i say? Great Lakes cant lose, and this is a home run, cheers!"
"Final note: Unfortunately I can't give this 5's across the board due to the slightly unbalanced flavor profile, which might benefit from a slightly heavier dose of hops. But it's damn close to perfect. Grab this whenever you see it available."
"Overall its good. Very nice and easy drinking."
"overall - nice lager at a nice price - call me crazy but i think i would take a boston lager over this"
"Taste is malty, with some toffee tones up front and a hoppy twang at the finish. Enjoyable."
"Very Sam Adams lager like with much bolder flavors. Also more malty and less hoppy than SA lager. But overall, just fantastic and the best Vienna lager i've ever had."
"Draft to imperial pint glass. Looks good, amber with malty expectations. Smell is its weakest asset. It's almost nonexistent. Tastes good; malty, yet crisp. Goes down nicely. Could make for a good session beer. I enjoyed it overall, although I prefer more of a bitter beer in general. Think of it as Killian's on steroids."
"Very nice beer and an outstanding example of the Vienna Lager style. I'll admit I'm a fan of Sam Adams. This is a nice alternative. An excellent beer. Easy to drink and easy to enjoy. I'll buy this again. It would go perfectly with pizza, pasta, chicken, just about anything."
"O - Very high drinkability. Yet another excellent Great Lakes beer."
"O - A great beer, I really enjoyed it. I could easily session this beer."
"O: To me, this beer is what the big companies wish they could make. Light, refreshing, tasty, and highly drinkable. Worth a try and a great beer for lounging around during the warmer months."
"This is more enjoyable to me than SA Boston Lager. Very solid all around."
"Pours a dark orangish red with just a little bit of foam in the Sam Adams perfect pint glass. Tastes of slightly sweet caramal malts, with a breadie like finish. For a lager, i'm not used to having one that doesn't have a bad aftertaste. This is quite drinkable. Wish lagers like Great Lakes, were availabe here."
"Overall: A very good version of a lager."
"O: I was really impressed by this beer. I'm not the hugest fan of Boston Lager so I didn't have high hopes for this one, but I must say that I would drink this often if it was available to me. Thanks again Jay for a great brew!"
"O - This is one of the best lagers I've ever had. Absolutely delicious and a joy to drink. Can't go wrong with this beer."
"O: Overall, a pretty good example of the style and a good beer for when you don't want something extremely heavy or light."
"M - Smooth, nice carbonation, with a little bite, very pleasant"
"Very enjoyable beer, just like pretty much everything else made by Great Lakes. I've been drinking this for years and I won't stop any time soon."
"Pours a clear reddish orange, one finger of off-white head, spotty lacing. Smell: toffee, buttery, lightly toasty with a light floral hopping. Taste: toffee, toasted grain, a little fruity - yeast not as clean as expected. Fairly sweet with light floral and grassy hopping. Not special but works for the style. Best by 5/7/11."
"This one let's the balance of malt to hops stand out. No hop aroma. Tastes like crystal 40-60L. Good beer all around."
"Its hard to get excited about standard issued lagers...if it was a Marzen then maybe I could talk about the history or the amount of time and craftsmenship that went into making it, or how all the malts create this perfectly smooth, sweet, complex brew. This isn't a bad beer, and as far as lagers go it is everything I'm looking for. Pours smooth, amber color with white head, sweet flavor and clean finish...and when it was done I ordered something more exciting...Burning River. I would say this is a good transition beer when you're going from one style to the other: like going from porter to ipa? I like Great Lakes as a brewery and I'm really impressed with the diversity of the styles they release and the quality of each beer I've tried. Some of those styles, like american pale ale, I point to Great Lakes as a gold standard example (Burning River). So its hard to get worked up over Eliot Ness because Great Lakes has so many other beers that are better."
"O: Goes down easily, tasty, not too filling, mild kick, nice representation of style. As my palate has changed, this would be a one and done for me, but those enjoying a sweeter beer, this is easily one to sit with for a long time."
"When we first tried this beer years ago, a buddy of mine made it seem that he was among the Untouchables as well...in that you couldn't bribe him enough to willingly drink this again. Let's see if my tastebuds have evolved since then. This stuff pours a clear copper-amber topped by a half-finger of off-white foam. The nose comprises caramel, toffee, and some very mild and light orange zest. The taste brings the orange forward, mostly in terms of the peel, with the caramel and toffee coming in later. In the end, though, is a short but sharp stab of harsh bitterness. This is probably what turned my buddy and me off so long ago, and not much has changed (though my reaction now is decidedly less vitriolic). The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta dry-ish finish. Overall, an okay brew, but not something I really wanna go for again."
"Pours a clear amber red with a thin bubbly light tan head. Nice looking body, semi lacking head. Nose is sweet hops, some caramel malt and bread. Taste is similiar to the smell, good balance between the hops and other classic ingrediants. Very well crafted. Medium bodied mouthfeel. A real easy drinking ale. Great balance of the abv. Smooth, tasty and enjoyable. A deserving and well made beer."
"Very drinkable beer a nice smooth lager, not my favorite from Great Lakes, however, it was an enjoyable beer over dinner."
"Doesn't do much for me. Decent alcohol, but that's about it. I just don't care for lagers and this one is nothing special."
"Overall this is a great session ale if your looking for something for the long haul or this would definitely go well with summer grill-ables."
"This was a very simple, ""down to the basics"" type of brew. For a Vienne/Amber Lager this was chalked full of flavor. There was a caramel toasted malt flavor but it wasn't so over powering as to distract from the hops. The hops lent a slight bitterness and dryness that gave this beer a great balance. Like many beers from Great Lakes this one would be a solid choice for any occasion."
"D: Yet another excellent beer from Great Lakes. This brewery definitely knows how to make their lagers. This is an excellent example of a vienna style lager. Lots of malt flavor, but at the same time restrained enough to be very drinkable. One of the best examples for the style. A must try if you like good lagers."
"excellent, thanks to radioscooter for the sample"
"D: Solid beer from Great Lakes; I'm enjoying this one more after revisiting it a couple of times. I had this bottle from a 12-pack sampler that I bought to revisit some of their beers, but it's tempting me to try this on tap when I get a chance. If you're looking for a beer with strong malt flavors that isn't too sweet, this one's a great bet."
"I don't generally like lagers, with a few exceptions. But this beer really wowed me, and will definitely become a staple for me. It's a wonderful golden amber lager, very refreshing, with a smooth but sparkly mouthfeel. Flavor is mellow but surprisingly complex. Clean, crisp, and malty, almost perfectly balanced. Simply Delicious. A fantastic summer session beer."
"Pours a rich amber color with an impressive white head. Has a malted aroma almost like a Killians Irish Red on steroids (both being vienna lagers). Has nice carbonation and a good mouth feel. Taste is remarkable. Goes down smooth. I'd recommend this beer. I'd like to go have it on tap straight from the brewpub."
"I would absolutely buy a 12 pack and Great Lakes has proven to make very tasty beers at an affordable price."
"D: This was a delicious and crisp Vienna Lager, but has a slight bitter aftertaste, but not as bad as other Vienna's Ive had. The alcohol is well hidden in this lager. Would be exceptional in the summer and in the heat (though, admittedly dangerous with the 6.2 ABV"
"D -- Very nice offering. I have to be honest, I tried a bottle previous to this review and it was off. I'm not sure if it was coded or just a bad seal or what, but I'm happy I tried again. Solid brew."
"Verdict - I have had this beer a couple times before and have not once been disappointed with it. My favorite beer from Great Lakes."
"Very tasty beer. Exceptional color and smell, and pretty easy to drink despite its slightly heavier appearance. I would definitely recommend this beer to even a casual beer drinker welling to expand their beer horizons and try something different and interesting."
"Probably 19/20 beers I have are ales, and Eliot Ness is a pleasant reminder that there's something to be said for a truly well-made lager. Highly recommended."
"Easily masked abv, could pound these back with much fun, another great tasting brew from Great Lakes."
"Poured a clear amber with an enormous yellow head that has awesome retention and leaves excellent lacing. Spicy rye aroma with some strawberries, All-Bran cereal, cream of wheat, caramel malt, cornbread, brown sugar....very earthy. Taste is good: massive hop backbone with rye toast, earthiness, buttered biscuit. Good carbonation and medium mouthfeel."
"D - Somewhat more bitter than the typical lager, although the rather muted taste profile fits the style. Not as clean and/or crisp as I like my lagers and a tad too bitter for my tastes, although I can easily see how this beer would appeal to those who want a recipe that leans in favor of hops without the tastes being sharp. The trade-off seems to be between cold/hops and warm/malts."
"Update: Each bottle increases the realization that this is just about the best lager I have ever had. Other than Celebrator....I can not think of another lager beer I enjoy more. An Amazing beer that will always be in my fridge."
"M/D. The mouthfeel is a smooth soft crisp clean finish that has a pleasant light to medium body feel that gives it a nice drinkable feel. A six pack of this would be more than satisfying while watching a sporting event or to make Eliot Ness proud while watching a police related tv show."
"Very light and drinkable. You most certainly could have a few of these masked abv wonders. All around a great lager."
"Thanks to Agold for this extra from our trade. Poured into my Dfh snifter, a deep amber colored pour, very little foam or lacing. Smell- I get a dark apple juice aroma, some pear and breads flavors as well. Taste- the apple juice flavor hits first, followed by some breads taste, finished by some dark spice, maybe cinnamon at the end. Mouthfeel- nice carbonation, appropriate thickness. Overall, this is a good session beer, I was glad to taste it. Would have it again if in the Midwest."
"D- This is a decent brew however i'd like a little more of a hop kick to balance it out."
"Drinkabilty - The alcohol is good %, the beer is smooth and mild, I can see pounding down a 6-pack no problem. A fine beer again from great lakes."
"Maybe at Capone's."
"3.5/3.5/4/4/4"
"D - The crisp finish makes this beer an easy drinker."
"Great example of the style. Great Lakes went right for authenticity it seems."
"D - Well I love Great lakes and this beer is good but not something I would seek out again. Much smoother and better tasting on tap. Still a very good brew."
"This is definitely the best I've had for the style, although I suppose it's not my favorite. Nonetheless, Great Lakes excels with beers like this. If you're looking for a well crafted lager, or just a change of pace, look no further. Recommended."
"Notes - Probably the best from this brewery (haven't had black out yet) Oddly enough, this beer taste very well in the bottle as well, comparable to when poured."
"One reason why I miss Ohio so much is this wonderful brewery. Please Great Lakes distribute to MA soon."
"Drinkability - This is a nice little beer. A complex beer in my opinion in both aroma and taste. It seems to be rather sweet, so that may get to me after a while, but I could set a few back with relative ease."
"I dig it. It's different than Boston Lager but just as well crafted. Sure wish Great Lakes was available somewhere in these parts."
"D- decent this kind of beer is not really my forte but overall I was impressed with this beer."
"D -- Great drinkability if you're looking for malt backbone. Good enough hop bitterness to let you know it's there, but the malt is the king in this beer."
"Drinkability - Found this to be a fantastic beer and could have a few. The beer itself is nice and full bodied."
"Poured into a 12oz pint glass. Looks very clean, the way a lager should. Nice head retention and lacing down the side of the glass. Smells of yeast and malt. Very crisp and refreshing but also complex enough to add intrest. Another great brew by GLBC."
"12 oz into snifter. Nose reeks of lager yeast mainly. In a wonderful way. Head is frothy and gorgeous over a ruby red very clear and very clean lager. So neat and crisp, with a malty fizzle on your tongue. Really a wonderful example of the style, highly recommended."
"Full grain fullness hits the mouth first, followed by malty caramel sweetness, finnishing dry and bitter with the fresh herbal grass notes. Quite a fine beer."
"Pours a lovely ruby copper with a thin off white head. very good clarity. Nose- biscuit, grains. Taste-Very malt forward, layers of grain. Caramel, nuts, toast. Hops take the background here, but do add some balance to the malts and show up on the finish."
"Drinkability: Pretty tasty, the ABV on this though inhibits the ability to put more than one or two down on any given occasion atleast for me."
"An extra note: Someone purchased this for me, and in the time that it took him to complete the rest of his grocery shopping, all of the Great Lakes products sold out except for the porter."
"1/4 off-white head resulted in a thin broken ring of head around edge of glass, quick dissipation but with significant lacing. Clear medium amber body, minimal carbonation rising from bottom of glass. Nose is malt forward, mainly caramel but some roast and breadiness, very malty, minimal hop presence in the nose. Taste is sweetish caramel up front and a surprisingly hoppy finish, noble bitterness, nice balance. Medium mouthfeel, not a lot of effervescence, a bit sticky. Very drinkable. I thought this was an outstanding beer, I wish I could have this more often."
"This is a super drinkable beer and another great offering from Great Lakes. Making solidly brewed and clean beers seems to be there specialty, and I am excited to try the rest of their portfolio."
"D: Not my normal beer style, but goes down easy. Pretty well balanced."
"This beer is a very clear, rich copper color with a faint head. It presents a wonderful malt nose. Toasted malt, with a very pleasant bread-crust scent. Some herbal hops are present in the aroma, but, again, the malt dominates. The taste is slightly sweet and malty, but overall quite balanced. Clean, crisp, malty, and very satisfying. Balanced and easy to drink."
"Despite the nose, I can definitely drink more than one of these."
"This is a fantastic lager. I'd recommend it to anyone. Really a nice showcase of crystal malts."
"Overall: A great Vienna lager. Supremely well balanced and world class drinkablility. This would be a great introduction to craft beer."
"D - Very drinkable beer could definitely have a few of these in a sitting perfer this Vienna Lager to Sam Adams Boston Lager in that style category."
"Summary: Great Lakes always delivers a well rounded version of whatever is advertized on the bottle, case in point. I don't have a lot to say about this beer, however. I don't love lagers, amber lager being my least favorite. This could be a crowd pleaser for non-hop lovers. It's available in the mixed 12 pack, and tolerable in that capacity."
"This beer is low in abv and certainly sessionable. While not my personal GLBC favorite, I would never object to sharing a sixer of this with my best friend."
"Drinkability: Not a complex beer, but not a bad beer. It's a session beer or a beer you'd have to complement your meal. This beer would be great with some wings. Of all of the beers that I've had from Great Lakes this is my least favorite, but it is good for the style so I can't be too harsh."
"This is a pretty solid Vienna Lager, with a nice amber color and two-finger head which left lasting lacing. It smells like spicy hops and a bit of caramel malt and is very clean tasting, with toasty malt, a bit of graininess, some spicy but definitely subordinate hops, a little bit of a bite at the end, and fine carbonation which makes it a good drinker. Not incredibly exciting but certainly an excellent beer."
"This could be one of the beer session beers I've had in a long time. Extremely well balanced, flavorful and drinkable."
"Pours a deep brown color with ruby highlights and a light brown head and nice lacing. Smells of vanilla, roasted barley, and malt. Tastes like malted barley, roasted barley, biscuits, and sweetbread. Mouthfeel is great with a thick texture. Drinkability is high."
"d- okay, this is a solid amber ale, easy to drink, and a nice offering from great lakes."
"Cheers.."
"Pours a clear amber color with a frothy tan head that retains well and leaves nice lacing. The aroma has some hay and biscuit notes upfront, along with caramel and toffee, herbal hops, raw honey and some alcohol...intriguing if not particularly complex. The flavor is classic vienna lager, with nutty and biscuity malt notes initially, along with treacle and caramel, brown sugar, hay and must, herbal hops and some alcohol. The mouthfeel is medium but really smooth and drinkability is good but limited by the alcohol presence. Very solid lager from Great Lakes, like a higher octane oktoberfest."
"Pours a bronze-brown with a medium sized tan head with fair retention and lots of lacing properties. Aromas are predominantly toasty, with an interesting nutty element that's almost as strong, and a bit of wood as well. There's a tinge of alcohol on the nose as well, but not enough to detract from the main aromas. Flavors are remarkably complex, with tons of toast and pecans up front, followed by toffee and tea on the mid-palate, and a mostly sweet and slightly woody finish. Medium body is perfectly carbonated. A thoroughly delicious beer. Hands down the best of its style."
"Pours a deep, amber orange, clear, with a thin beige head. Smell is a little hoppy and yeasty and alcohol-y. First taste is subdued hops, with a nice finish of fruit-like fresh bread. Kind of a one-dimensional hops/malt taste, but good and very smooth. Finish is short with some bitterness. A solid, easily drinkable lager."
"End Beer Musings: Again not to harp but when considered by style this has to be an A example in my book, maybe a very good rating overall (B+) but this definitely trumps Sam Adams lager and I can hardly think of any more examples of Vienna lagers that come close. Anyone? Bueller? Bueller?"
"D: great brew, very drinkable, nice balance. I would recommend this to anyone who thinks lagers are boring because there's nothing boring about this."
"Best served closer to room temperature due to the alcohol content"
"I wouldn't necessarily want to pound these, but i wouldn't mind either"
"Light bitter finish. Very easy drinking and well crafted. Nice session brew."
"D- Exceptional drinkability, great depth of flavor, definitely malt forward but finishes with a crisp light bitterness to balance it out. Fantastic beer, great representation of the style."
"D: Good drinkability. Easy to drink, well balanced."
"Pours a deep amber, like a dark brandy. Head sticks around for a while with good lacing on the glass. The smell is a sweet, not quite caramelish. The taste is a little prickly but mostly sweet, with the consistency being rather syrupy. It's alright, and I could probably drink a few before the sweetness overpowered my taste buds, and I generally like sweet beers."
"Not as bad as I thought it might be."
"O: Could have been so much better. I'm going to give this one another try in a few weeks and see if I got a bad batch."
"pretty drinkable and seems to fit the style well. not my favorite from glbc, but certainly a solid beer. worth trying if you haven't had it."
"D-Incredible. The type of beer that commands you drink only one and drink it slowly--appreciating it's nuanced flavor."
"D - Excellent. ABV is a little high to make it a session (at least for me--I like something in the 4-5 range for a session), but the taste and the craft make it very easy to have 3 or 4 of these. Fantastic work by Great Lakes, one of my favorites."
"Drinkability: Very good beer, but a little strong (in taste and ABV) to drink more than 1 or 2 per sitting."
"D: This beer is delicious. I love malt, but even if you are not a huge fan, I still think this beer is very drinkable. Has enough bite for you HOP DEVILS but enough smooth, sweetness for us malty types I can't wait to try another from my GL variety pack."
"The mouth feel is creamy and built on a medium body."
"D: Great drinker, much better than I ever expected. Goes down very easy. Requested another wihout hesitation."
"Drinkability-I could drink this all night"
"Poured into a pint glass, appearance is darkish orange , think Texas Longhorns Burnt Orange, (only extra burnt), smell is hoppy, citrusy, floral, amazing taste, among the best I've had in a long time. The mouth-feel is amazing, just the right balance of bitter and hops and drinkability is awesome. This is a great beer, regardless of your preference and the season, I think this could be a long-term staple of my collection..."
"I'm a fan of this beer. I like the malt/hop balance, and the dry finish makes it drinkable. I haven't had many beers in this style, but I'm impressed."
"The Eliot Ness did not dissapoint. It was a little heartier than I normally like but overall an excellent choice and I will definately put it on my list of recurring purchases."
"D - Not hard to drink and keeps you wanting another."
"Awesome color. The brightest amber I've ever seen in a beer. Good head, minimal lacing. Decent but one dimensional aroma. Just some stale bread and an idea of hops. Flavor is a big improvement. Sweet and chewy malts dominate. Only drawback is a bit of an annoying floral characteristic like a maibock. Goes down easy and would make a good session beer even thought the abv is a little high."
"A good session candidate and so easy and smooth going down. Nothing about this beer makes it niche or novelty. It's not a showstopper, but it's hard to imagine anyone not enjoying it."
"Pours a clear, amber color. 1/3 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and decent lacing. Smells of sweet malt, pale malt, yeast, slight pine, and slight hops. Fits the style of a Vienna Lager. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of hops, pale malt, sweet malt, hint of yeast, and hint of roasted malt. Overall, good body, blend, and aroma."
"Pours an amber color with about 1/2 inch head...one of the better great lakes beer's having tried a lot of them..Has a little bite but once get first down you get used to it..Won't drink this every day but would recommend buying a six pack to see if you like it..I tried Fitzgerald but did not like it as much as this one..."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has an amber color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, some hops. Taste is good, malts with some hops, a tad bitter at the finish. Well balanced. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this is a good quality beer."
"I would not mind having this again. It is definitely a very well made beer and im looking forward to having it again and trying some of Great Lakes other brews."
"D: Despite the limited smell, this beer is well balanced and worthy of a session."
"D: Eliot Ness has more character than just about any other Vienna Lager I have tried. Solid through and through, I will be seeking this one out again. Despite it's 6.2% ABV, it's very easy to drink, and one of these is not enough."
"Edit - I had to go back and review this again after drinking it a second time, and it was even better than before. I really like this beer, and at $7.50 for 6 it's an unbeatable value."
"D: I can pretty much drink this all day no issues. This is just a great beer. By the way this stuff is potent!"
"Overall: The most unique beer in this style. Thumbs way up."
"D: extremely drinkable. This most recent batch i'm having might be a little bit old. This used to be one of my favorite GL beers. The Cleveland water permeates all of the GL beers and it is noticeable in this beer - not necessarily as bad as you'd think though."
" Scary how drinkable this one is, never had a single person bitch or complain after handing them on of these babies, GREAT stuff to have on hand at all times, if not just for yourself, NICE!!!!"
"D - Would have another one in a heartbeat."
"D - This is my go to beer when it comes to Great Lakes! It never gets old and I always enjoy it. I am primarily a DIPA drinker, but Eliot Ness never disappoints!"
"D: very drinkable"
"D- A fine beer. Good for the style. Not super memorable, but it gets the job done."
"D - Very drinkable brew, medium bodied good blend of caramel and malt, I can easily have more than one of these in an evening and I recommend this brew"
"Overall this is an amazing beer. Full-flavored and easily drinkable yet fairly light. My idea of a good Vienna up to this point had been Sam Adams or Leinie's Red... compared to those two this is in a league of its own. If anyone ever tells you a lager is flavorless, give them one of these."
"Pours a pretty true copper with a nice white head. Nose is faint but has whisps of dark fruits, barley, and very light hops. Taste is all malts as expected but is fairly one note. I've found vienna lagers to be a difficult style to make good, they are either boring or a mess. This one falls more in the former."
"D: This is for sure a quality brew. A bit on the chewy side and not smooth as others, but the tastes do rival. The quality shines through and that keeps me coming back."
"Go simple, but give me yum! For an example of a truly good Vienna Lager, I'd take a try at Schell's Firebrick. Pedestrian at best."
"I really thought this was an amber ale until I decided to write it up. I even had one as little as two days ago under that assumption. Turns out it's not. Hmmph. Amber lager/Vienna lager. I guess paying a bit more attention to the malt characteristics reveals this. It's a style I would like to sample more widely, as it really is a category-defying brew. At least Eliot Ness is. Now go watch 'The Untouchables.'"
"Mouthfeel is pleasant, if not a little wan. While my preference is for bigger beers, this one is good as a session beer, though be careful - at 6.2%, it will catch up on you. Another winner from Cleveland's Great Lakes Brewing Company!"
"This beer pours a luscious dark amber, kind of like a maple syrup. It has a mild-hoppy, but floral aroma with some various spices coming through as well. This beer has such a clean finish on your palate.. with zero bitterness lingering at all; simply unbelievable. I definitely get some residual sweetness coming through the malts here, very nice. This is just a fantastic beer all-around, and I wouldn't mind having this one everyday with lunch or dinner perhaps. Cheers!"
"An excellent beer. Great Lakes beers have been in the Washington, DC for a few months and have taken the place by storm. I intend - I hope - to try as many of their brews as possible. I enjoyed drinking this one. I bet that Elliott Ness would probably have throw down his axe had it been available during Prohibition."
"Great Lakes Eliot Ness amber pours a finger of foam over a deep amber brew. Carbonation is spritzy, the nose clean fruity malt with a note of spicy hops. The flavor is, again, sweet, bready malt up front, with a nice subdued herbal/meadow kind of hop off the back. Leaving a lot of sticky lace behind on the glass, the brew has a light but round mouthfeel dried out just a bit by those spicy hops. Long mellow herbal tea aftertaste. Altogether a really solid, drinkable beer."
"D: I have another and I'm looking forward to enjoying it. I always think highly of Great Lakes' lager output, and this is an outstanding example of why."
"This was my first beverage from GLBC and this was well done, I would revisit this as well as try some of their other offerings"
"Sweet malt and light hop bitterness are also prominent in the flavor. Light bodied, decent carbonation, and pretty good drinkability. This is not as good as August Schell Firebrick in my opinion, but is stilll a nice beer. I wish this beer was a bit sweeter, and had a little less hop bitterness."
"medium light body, moderately creamy and pretty easy to drink. Moderately high to high carbonation could be a touch lower which would increase the drinkability to absurd levels."
"Overall, its a solid beer that I will drink more of since I bought two mix twelve packs of Great Lakes beers."
"D: Good, if you can get over the popcorn taste. I don't know that I can. Still, a worth while beer"
"D--type of beer you can drink one after the other, tasty enough for craft drinker but great entry for macro lover"
"O: From the look and smell I thought it was going to be a real treat, but it just didn't blow me away. The malt character is outstanding, but the dryness of the finish made it hard to get a full grasp of the malts."
"D= Yes I have tasted play doh and yes this beer smells and somewhat tastes like it. I dunno what's going on here. I'll try this beer another time to sure just to make sure it's not a fluke but if this is what the beer actually tastes like I don't think I'll be having much of it."
"pours an amber tan color with a minimal head but has a nice fresh beige ring..the smell is toffee and caramel some toasted bread and roasty malts with a little sweetness as in fruit or molasses..the taste is toffee and malt mixed with some hops and toast.molasses and honey round things out..the mouth feel is medium its creamy and smooth with well balanced malts and some crisp hops..this one is tasty and easy to throw back a few ..i like this one"
"D- High. I wish I had access to this one, a stellar example of a craft lager. I much prefer this to Sam Adams Boston Lager. And that's not a knock against Sam... just a testament to the awesomeness of this beer. Would be a go-to if I had it around in my stores."
"D- I could drink a few of these with some good food and company. I would love to have this on tap. Good beer and a good price."
"Over all pretty good."
"A very good beer that has to be the benchmark for the style. Nicely balanced, this one will please most beer geeks."
"D- A good looking beer that falls a little short. Decent taste but a little on the sweet side for my liking. I would probably stop after two of these."
"Drinkability: This is a massive Vienna Lager, almost seems like a Bock version of one. Very tasty and complex, but not the easiest drinking Vienna out there."
"D: a great brew for sure. It is somewhere between a Munich dunkel and a Vienna. Great Lakes calls it an amber lager, and that is what it should be listed as. despite this, EN is very well made, being both refreshing and rich at the same time. I highly recommend this brew to any beer drinker."
"Pours a dark amber color with a large off-white head that had excellant retention before settling to a thick cap. Moderate amount of spotty lacing is left on the glass. This is one good looking lager. Faint hop aroma to compliment the unbaked bread malt profile. Aroma overall is relatively weak. The flavor likewise is weak, even for the style. Slightly sweet malt with just a hint of spicy hops in the finish. Finishes clean and semi-dry. A good lager body. Feels substantial and smooth. A good drinker and high quality lager."
"Great Lakes just came to Minnesota, I started with the one I figured I might not like. Unfortunately my guess was true. This is a decent vienna lager, it just focuses on the tea-like hops a little too much. Not my favorite beer flavor. Decent beer, just not for me."
"Excellent drinkability. Though the ABV apparently is or is not above the cut-off level for what constitutes a ""session"" beer, this seems like a perfect ""session"" beer."
"Drinkable, but a little pricey."
"Drinkability is great. It goes down easy and smooth and is pretty refreshing. Great choice for a session beer and I plan to have it again. Nice example of the style. I do like Sam Adams lager, but I'd say I'd take this over that if I had the choice."
"D - very refreshing, extremely easy to drink"
"Great brew!"
"D - Pretty easy to drink but in general I don't care much for lagers. This beer is OK but nothing fantastic. It beats BMC easily but I don't really see much reason to seek this one out again."
"D: Refreshing for a Vienna Lager. One of my favorites of the style. Would be a good session beer."
"D: This is a six pack beer, great for sessions, very crisp and flavorful. Not too heavy to put you on your ass."
"Pours a nice clear dark amber color with a nice one finger head that gives way to some lacing. The aroma is of caramel malt and a little toastiness. The taste is of a caramel malt backbone with some bread notes present, and a slight hop bite that is undistiquishable. The mouthfeel is very carbonated. Overall it is a good solid beer terribly complex, but an easy drink."
"Like I said, a little more carbonation than I like. So the mouthfeel is not perfect. Even with the plethora of bubbles, I could drink a lot of these easy; very drinkable."
"Drinkability: The beer is not as easy of a drinker as I would expect, but it is a solid beer that I really enjoyed."
"EDIT -- did not fill out BeerSpy... location I got it in isn't listed, as it's not all that great (Ledo's pizza, Morgantown, WV)"
"Price is very reasonable as well. If you haven't tried the style and happen across a sixer or even a case I highly recommend giving it a try."
"This is still a very nice brew from Great Lakes and one that remains consistent on tap or out of the bottle."
"Morey's Bottom Line: I'm an Ipa (ale) guy, but every so often I'll try a new lager, and this one is without a doubt the best one that I have ever had. Great Lakes Dortmunder is the second. I really enjoyed this beer."
"Drinkability: Another offering from GLBC I'd be more than happy to drink all day; I love warm flavors and I think this is a great spring and autumn beer as it's a little heavy, but the ABV is pretty moderate at 6.2% and none of the flavors are harsh or overwhelming to the palate. Cheers to Great Lakes!"
"F: Some bitterness starts to hint, with a little spicy and grassy hop presence. It dries quite a bit but leaves a strange syrupy sticky sweet caramel flavor. More lager lingering flavors. A slight toffee and roasted flavor lingering too. A strange amber lager, but tasty."
"You get a little less than finger's worth of head, dark tan, loosely knit foam, not a great deal of lacing. Reddish orange hue like a fire's embers, some brown in there, more transparent than translucent but not crystal clear. Maple syrup, caramel and molasses endow the nose with some sweetness, this helps as there's definitely a metallic, iron fleck aspect to it, minimally processed whole grain bread, caraway seeds trump the slighter peach, pear fruit, while not a lot of scent diversity, penetrates like a mortar shell. Medium-bodied with a fine, if active, carbonation which gently prickles the tongue. Has much more of a mineral water, spritzy feel to it and the metallic flavors fit in better with the fizz to back it up. Sourdough and grains, pepper, orange citrus, emphasis on hoppiness until near the end where caramel, brown sugar, honey calm the nerve endings. Touch more presence in the apricot, peach, pear fruit too. A beer that is much more enjoyable taken as a whole than dissected, good distinct personality but not hard to drink."
"Pours a deep translucent burnished copper color, Very Sweet/malty aroma when cracking the bottle, Nice head at first, then subsides quickly making me think maybe it will be flat, boy was I wrong. Big malt up front, riding on just enough hops to carry it through. Well carbonated, Final kick of mild hops really makes this drinkable."
"A: Solid half inch of thick creamy head off an easy pour, amber to copper in color, significant lacing - 4.00, S: Lots of grain on the nose, some dry herbal hops - 3.50, T: Slightly sweet, medium hop bite, some mild grapefruit zest and earthiness, significant caramel - 4.50, M: Nice mouth feel, quite creamy - 4.00, D: An exceptional lager, nicely crafted, extremely drinkable - 4.50"
"Notes: One of the most full-bodied lagers I have ever had. Perhaps decoction mashing is used. My favorite Vienna lager when compared to Penn Pilsner and Sam Adams."
"not bad, especially considering how old the bottle is."
"D - Not bad drinking, but doesn't stand out as particularly special."
"This is a good beer. It is definitely one that you can sit back and relax with."
"Pours a magnificent deep amber / ruby red, with a light beige head that dissipates pretty quickly. This brew is crystal clear. Aroma is dominated by sweet malts and breadiness - there's also a touch of hop spice, as well as a tart and fruity (yeast?) character in the nose. Taste is of light caramel malt sweetness, with a touch of toastiness - finish is super clean and noticeably doughy / biscuity. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied, and a touch oily / viscous - zingy carbonation. Overall, a pretty good brew and a nice change of pace - although, its a little too sweet for my taste."
"Easy to see why it won a gold medal at the World Beer Championships. BBQ baked beans and brats a natural pairing."
"All in all, if you like hops, this is an interesting brew to try at least once. Otherwise, this is a brew to avoid."
"This is a very, very drinkable brew. Could easily drink this year round by the case. Taste is great, look is great - a great brew. Hands donw the best Vienna Lager I have had. Great Lakes is a new favorite brewery."
"Notes: Amazing; one of my favorites. I enjoy this one a bit more than their Dortmunder Gold. One of the tastiest lagers made; reminds me of an offshoot of an Octoberfest beer."
"Flavor profile actually has a bit of an ""off-putting"" character in the finish. However, this is relatively complex and with lots of layers."
"Great one for my 100th review."
"Easily sessionable and an easy choice of caseworthiness."
"You can taste the malt backbone in this beer, even with the sweet finish. Very drinkable and this is a very solid beer that you could drink with almost anything."
"D - Great Lakes never fails to deliver quality brew. Very much a fan of the Eliot Ness. Wonderfully crafted with plenty to offer."
"The beer pours an amber color with a cream-colored head. The aroma is lots of biscuit malt. The flavor is toffee, caramel, biscuit malt and some fruit. The beer is slightly sweet. The mouthfeel is medium and the carbonation is medium."
"D: Over the top. Best Vienna Lager I've ever had. Perfect springtime or early Fall beer, IMHO. And it went well with homemade pizza."
"D- This beer has amazing drinkability. I couldn't be more happy with this beer than when I had it over and over again. Lower ABV makes it a craft lover's session beer. I would recommend this to a lot of people...both craft and BMC drinkers."
"D-by far one of the best lagers I've had to date. this goes down so easy and smooth, what a texture and great flavor! grab a bunch and get your drink on!"
"pint at the Big Hunt, DC, in the midst of a blizzard"
"D-Very much so."
"D- This is one of my favorites in the Great Lakes sampler, behind Edmond Fitzgerald of course."
"D- Very enjoyable and easy drinking beer. This was one of my gateway beers and it remains a favorite standby in my fridge."
"Pretty good, but I have to say, not quite as impressive as I had imagined.. Did not live up to it's mini hype for me."
"Drinkability: Supremely easy to drink. The only thing that hurts this is that its 6.2% abv. Otherwise I could easily drink these all night."
"I probably shouldn't have expected a lager to be flavorful. I like this and it pairs well with many food items."
"Beer is medium bodied and smooth. No real aftertaste but there is a slight bitterness at the back of the mouth. Good connectivity, slight sour from the carbonation, nice bitterness, clean tasting and really smooth. I would order this again."
"I don't if lagers are supposed to be this hoppy tasting but damn do I like it."
"Poured from 12 oz. bottle into pint glass. Dark burgundy color, taupe 1 finger head. Malt aroma with lots of spice. Light fruity hops bready malt and caramel flavor. Nice balance bewteen the malt and hops. Slightly bitter hop finish. Moderate carbonation. Overall a very blanced, very drinkable beer."
"D-Damn! This one starts out subtle but the more you drink the more you appreciate this brew and the better it gets. Simply an outstanding example of the style. So crisp and flavourful this brew never gets boring. A masterful beer that could go down bottle after bottle."
"Great Lakes Brewing Company rarely disappoints as this was a delicious Vienna."
"D - A very tasty and enjoyable lager... Well balanced... I would enjoy one of these any day, but I'm not sure this lives up to all the hype..."
"Overall a very drinkable strong lager."
"By far the best selection for the style I have ever had."
"D: Really enjoyed this beer. Sam Adam's drinkers should all try this. Not quite as hoppy but much more complex."
"D: I could (and will) session this. It's very comparable to Boston Lager and probably even a little better. Well done."
"Cheers!"
"Overall this is an excellent lager that I just love. I drank up my keg in record time (only one I drank faster was Two Hearted) and everyone that tried it, loved it. Another great brew by Great Lakes, they got it going on. I will no doubt be drinking another keg of this in the future."
"D - This is one nice lager...the flavors of caramel really stand out and the addition of the hops at the end are great...the beer never became too sweet and has a lower ABV which makes this sessionable"
"D: Great year round beer...defintely hides the high ABV"
"This beer pours nicely from the bottle leaving a good head. A good dark appearance but not cloudy. An amazingly smooth taste that goes down with ease. It sits nicely on the palate being not to heavy or light. I truly enjoyed this beer from the beer sampler I bought."
"drinkibilty is really up there and liked this one very much."
"I like this beer and would recommend it."
"One of the best beers I've ever had. A personal favorite, and I could never turn this beer down."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low to medium carbonation. Great Lakes has really nailed relatively low ABV beers with a whole ton of flavour."
"Aroma is sweet with notes of caramel and roasted malts. Taste follows the nose with lots of caramel sweetness with some roasted malts and bread notes. Medium bodied with nice carbonation. Very drinkable, enjoyed the only one I have thoroughly."
"D- Pretty easy to drink, I could see having a sixer at a party."
"Drinkability: very high"
"Excellent beer. I highly suggest having this at some point in your life. Or, better yet, get a six-pack & a few friends and have a big healthy meal of roasted pork chops, green beans, parsley and garlic potatoes, and an apple tart or crisp for dessert."
"Great Lakes must have as many gold medal winning beers as they do employees. This brewery has a record of consistency for turning-up quality, delicious, true-to-style beers that I doubt could ever be broken (if such records were kept). The town of Cleveland should build a Craft Brewing Hall of Fame and make these guys the inaugural inductees."
"D- A tasty lager; very smooth and drinkable."
"Great Lakes has yet to disappoint!!"
"good drinking vienna, very clean but on the full side of the style."
"One of few lagers (aside from doppelbocks and such) that I would recommend not drinking too cold, and in fact, with barely a chill. This is great. If Eliot Ness (the beer, not the dude) is to be lumped together in the same league with Dos Equis or Sam Adams Boston Lager, I feel sorry for it. Not that those are terrible, but seriously, this is one uncommonly excellent lager. Thanks to kels for the hook-up!"
"Cheers Eric!"
"This is a medium amber/caramel color with light head. Pretty light and fizzy appearance. Slightly sweet aroma.. I pick up some odd grains like rice. Hops are very prevalent in the flavor, much more than I expected from the smell. Delicious and well balanced, this is sweet at first but hops bite at the back end. There is a lot of flavor here, but light bodied with low alcohol presence and excellent drinkability. Great beer!"
"Drinkability: this is a superb session beer that can be quaffed all night long. Absolutely a must if on tap."
"Drinkability - I'm glad I bought a six-pack of this. This is a beer for enjoying with a meal or by itself at the end of the day, and even going back for another later on. It's a solid high quality beer for both routine and special drinking occasions in my book. I think I'd feel spoiled if I got to have this all the time...and yet I can if I want."
"Hard to knock this one. A really nice fall drinker, enough heft to combat the cool evenings without going to something overly heavy like a RIS or barleywine. Really tasty."
"Mouthfeel is ok, but I couldn't drink more than 2 sips before I had to dump it."
"D - At 6.2 ABV, the drinkability is great. Not alcoholic tasting at all. Very hearty. Hoppier than most Vienna lagers, and the hop aftertaste slowed down my consumption."
"Very nice brew by a very good brewery. Looking forward to trying more by this brewer."
"Very glad to have tried this one."
"indeed be good."
"D - Mildly high ABV makes this a fun bottle to session and the flavors mature into the 3rd to 4th helping."
"Deep amber pour with 2 fingers of slowly receding head. Smell is musty malts mostly, which is mirrored in the taste. Almost has that expired-IPA feel, with the mustiness and crayon wax flavors. Just not something I really can enjoy. Perhaps if this was in the 4-5% ABV range I would like it more, but at higher than 6 it just isn't worth it."
"Very nice for the style. Drinkable and well worth a try. Possibly my favorite out of the stuff I've had from this brewery so far."
"I could drink this beer all day and all night long. I need to find a case of this as soon as possible."
"Overall- this is a good solid staple beer but nothing spectacular. this one would be one for a friend who's a bud drinker and you wanna show him/her that there's beers out there that aren't to crazy but really smooth and good."
"D: Oh yeah."
"The mouth feel is right on, smooth and clean, yet big and almost creamy. Very drinkable and very enjoyable. Not only is this beer spot on for style, its also damn good."
"Pours a rosy copper that is easily seen through with a light layer of foam on top. Aroma is faint (as mentioned on the label) but not absent. Lightly pungent hops and grainy malts are balanced, whereas in the flavor, the malts step up to the hops giving this beer a pleasant sweetness that is never cloying. There is an herbal quality that reminds me of iced tea, along with the earthy hops and a touch of fruit. Finishes bitter. Well crafted. Great Lakes is batting 1.000 with me so far."
"D: Great body and flavor balance."
"D- this is a style geared towards drinkability, and this beer has it. the style calls for a fairly low hops presence, so for some people it might be too sweet/malty, but that's the style, and it is well done."
"Pours a deep ruby/amber color with a huge bubbly beige that leaves lots o lace on the way down the glass. Smell is a sweet fruity malt aroma with a hint of earthy floral hops. Taste is sweet with malts. Burnt sugar caramel fruity and bready with just enough of a hop bite about midway through to keep the sweetness in check. Crisp carbonation, medium body, Oily almost creamy sensation in the mouth. It's been a while since I've had a great Lager. This is one. Easy drinking smooth sessionable brew."
"D - Goes down so smooth, I finished before I finished thinking about the review. Good taste. I could drink a few of these."
"(Review from tasting notes dated 07 aug 2009)"
"This beer poured a red-tinged amber with a small head. The smell is candy sweet with a bit of burnt sugar. The taste starts off with a bit of solid malt that's cut by some interesting hop bitterness that seems to give way to even more malt and a bit of nuttiness. The mouthfeel is slightly thick with some moderate carbonation. This is an interesting beer and an uncommon style, it's worth grabbing if you can find it."
"Notes: One of my favorite beers I've had and especially for this style. Awesome flavor, I wish I could get this all the time, I could easily see this becoming a regular in my fridge if I could get it."
"D - It's heavy enough for a Vienna that it has some kick, but I could do a few of these pretty easily."
"Pours a dark amber with reddish tint and has a respectable head that fades quickly. I am unable to get much on aroma. Some malty sweetness and a slightly earthy flavor. Mouth feel is about medium bodied with a little carbonation over the top of the tongue. Very drinkable, this one could go the entire night. Overall, the taste was not something I expected in a lager, although it was good, just surprising. A little heavier than most lagers, but it did have lager's trademark drinkability."
"Mouthfeel was tremendous - which I find hard to say for most lagers. This one encourages large mouthfills, and goes down crazy smooth with no harsh aftertaste. Simply refreshing."
"Hoppiness seems a bit americanized, which is fine. Impacts the aroma less than flavor (when it takes some from malty juicieness). Nonetheless, seems no freshness issues. Drinks well. Goes well with my steak salad with blue cheese."
"Taste: Very balanced between the hops and malts. Slight toastiness. Finishes with a modest bitterness. Great example of the style."
"Notes: This is an outstanding Vienna Lager!!! The balance of sweet, toasty and hops is spot on. Well done Great Lakes!!!"
"Might be the best drinking lager on Planet Earth."
"a notch."
"Poured into a pint glass. Appears a copper color with a medium size head. Aroma of mostly caramel with some very light citrus. Taste has more of caramel and also some maple syrup. Very smooth and creamy to drink. Leaves a very nice sweet aftertaste. This is the best Vienna lager I've had. Excellent - also a great session beer."
"Slick and silky mouthfeel. Really nice, medium bodied with some hop in the after taste. Goes down so easy and with so much flavor it could only be called a beautiful beer."
"D - Move over Sam Adams, there's a better Vienna Lager in town. Very refreshing, though at 6.2% it's just on the border of being sessionable. Nonetheless, it's great to taste an amber with some complexity, that still manages to retain a high level of drinkability."
"D - Easy drinker, nothing too extreme in any way, good balance and ample flavor."
"I received this beer as a gift not really knowing what it was and I was wonderfully shocked. This beer has one of the best flavor combinations for a lager that I've had plus the texture of this brew is awesome. Must find more ASAP!"
"Great drinkability, really nails this style! Well done Great Lakes!"
"3.5 D: Really good, but a bit cloying."
"D- Smooth, tarty and zesty makes for some nice flavors and some nice drinkability."
"This went down before I noticed it was gone. A nice beer for a style that is generally uninteresting."
"O: A good beer. The alcohol starts to peek out from behind the malt flavor in the middle of the taste, which is a little distracting. I'd have one or two, but then I would have to move on to something else (and there is plenty to choose from if you are in the GL Brepub)."
"The best Vienna Lager I've ever tasted and likely ever will taste. My go-to beer, as it complements most any food or situation. The only thing better than a bottle of Eliot Ness is Eliot Ness from the keg (review soon to come)."
"Drinkabilty: Great beer too have at any time, anywhere, with anyone. Just a high quality lager."
"Drinkability: Another very good beer from Great Lakes."
"notes: not my favorite GLBC beer but it was top 3."
"One finger cream head on a deep amber body. Head retention seems weak on first glance as it drops lower and lower before even the first sip. Sweet nose, sour taste. Alcohol is noticed right off. Almost a vinegar flavor there, tempted to throw a lime in. Great thick lacing trails the glass while the head has pretty much stuck at a shallow constant crown. Vinegar is telling me this one might be bad, I'm pretty sure this wasn't what it was intended. Though from all appearances it looks fine. First beer of the day and the Drain was fed."
"Overall, this is an eminently drinkable and enjoyable beer. Very balanced and very refreshing. A bit too high abv-wise to be a session beer, but to my mind a slightly shorter session of GL Eliot Ness would not be a bad night."
"Drinkability- One of my favorite session beers. Good year-round."
"D: you can't have just one, this beer has great drinkability about it. wow, this is good!"
"Eliot Ness is plenty likeable. Great for washing down tacos and pizza. Doesn't entirely stand out as a beer to seek out, but I'm more than happy to keep this around as a ""go-to"" lager on a hot summer day."
"D - yeah, I could get into this all day."
"Drinkability: One of my favorite beers to drink when I'm back in western Pennsylvania, since you can't get Great Lakes in the South. A bigger, bolder beer for a Lager, but one to sip and savor, and yet one that I can certainly session and love live for it."
"The best I've had in this style and possibly the best American lager I can recall off the top of my head."
"Very good beer! Enjoy this one anytime!"
"I very much enjoyed this beer. Very clear copper/gold color. Very malty caramel smell with a thin tan head. Taste is slighly metallic but sweet. Hint of a grain aftertaste. Moderate mouthfeel. Overall, one of my favorite from Great Lakes to have a sixer of."
"Na Zdravje!"
"Future outlook: Vienna Lagers don't rank close to being amongst my favorite styles, but like all Great Lakes beer, this one is still very solid. Probably won't ever seek this one out, but I'll be happy to have it again if the appropriate situation arises."
"This was a great overall beer and very drinkable."
" Thank you GLB , nice work !"
"Light brown in color. Fruity character to the nose that is consistent with the initial attack of the flavor. Something about it makes me think ""raspberry."" The fruitiness to the flavor is complemented by some sour notes. The finish is a little bitter or sour with that carrying through to the aftertaste."
"Pours out a deep amber/copper color. About a finger of creamy white head, decent lacing and head retention. Smells are of sweet malts, a bit of hops and spices also. Taste is relatively sweet. A bit of a bite from the hops, but the sweetness seems to dominate, a bit of alcohol and spices finishes off the flavor. Mouthfeel was smooth and light-medium bodied, a great lager. Definitely drinkable."
"D- Nice malty brew that is easily sessionable and full of flavor."
"D: One of the best lager beers that I have every tried. Outstanding in almost every way. This is one brew that I wouldn't mind having around all the time. Another top notch offering from a superb brewery. Well done Great Lakes!"
"Drinkability - I could probably drink these all night."
"This is an outstanding amber lager. Tons of body, tons of flavor, not overly bitter and far from bland. Yum."
"D: Definitely drinkable. A little heavy for a lager though. maybe I just wasn't feeling this one last night, I'll have to try it again soon."
"I really like drinking these great lagers; it is a great change of pace"
"This is a nicey, for sure. But doesn't seem to stand out to me too much. I don't know if this will become a fave."
"D: I could drink this all day everyday, but either the brewery would run out of beer or my liver would give out. Either way things don't look very good on that front. Its a great beer and very drinkable."
"Have had this beer in bottles and on tap at the brewery. It pours a reddish amber color with a nice white head. It smells very breadlike and grainy. It taste very smooth and malty. You can taste caramel, bread, hops, and malts. It is extremely well balanced. I can drink this beer all day every day. This is my favorite Great Lakes beer, and quite possibly my favorite all around beer. I can't say enough about this. I wish I could give this a perfect 5, but I that's something I can't see myself ever giving. Please try this beer if you haven't. I will keep this in my fridge until the day I die!"
"D - The carbonation gets a little heavy by the end of one bottle, which would limit the session possibilities, and for me it's just not a style that I'd keep wanted to revisit. But hey, if you like Vienna lagers, this might be as good as it gets."
"D: Very drinkable, damn tasty."
"This is about as good as an American session lager gets, seriously."
"D: Decent. A good beer that I could have a couple of. I wonder if it was better fresher?"
"A fine beer, no doubt about it."
"Overall a distinguished brew that I will absolutely drink when given the opportunity."
"Supremely drinkable. This is one I'd keep going back to."
"Clean mouthfeel, medium bodied to light with a sharp carbonation."
"Drinkability: So high, as good as it gets. It's good alone, it's good with food, it's good when it's hot outside, it's good when it's cold outside, it's good when...well it's always good."
"The feel is smooth but with a gritty, rougher texture at the swallow. A solid amber. Balanced, earthy, bitter and flavorful."
"Very nice amber color. A bit darker than expected. Very nice malty smell, not very complex in smell but nice. Reminded me of the Lazy Mag Amberjack a bit. Very good flavor with malty goodness and just a touch of hops for a smooth bittering. It didn't feel overly impressive in the mouth, pretty standard. But the taste was good and this beer was very nice to drink. I could've had a couple of more if the time was right and the beer was available."
"Wow another spectacular brew from Great Lakes. Nothing too overpowering here. Nice balanced, dark taste with hints of caramel and citrus. Decent head retention, about two fingers. The smell is my favorite characteristic of this beer. Very complex and just plain good. Good mouthfeel as well. Just a well rounded beer. Also great with food, I like it with steak."
"D: Hard to find much to complain about here."
"D: Very drinkable, if I had a 6pack of this and if I could get this around here, it would be one of my go-to beers for sure."
"A very basic style that Great Lakes has brewed quite well."
"Poured this into glass and formed a a shortlived 2 finger head over a coppery gold body with lots of carbonation apparent. Very nice appearance. The smell is sweet with caramel and fruit and a bit of flowery hops. The taste is light caramel, bread with a touch of orchard fruit and an assertive bitterness from the hops that I'd call just slightly citrus. The mouthfeel is very nice and yet not overly full with a finish of light citrus preceded by a quick slug of the sweet malt. Nicely balanced with a nod towards the hops more than the malt. Very drinkable and this ain't even my favorite out of the sampler pack."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied, though slightly heavier than I would like with a good amount of carbonation."
"D: Top notch lager all the way. Recommended to the fans of the style for a must try."
"M/D - nice and smooth, easy drinking with nice carbonation and flavor. I'd definitely recommend this one."
"Overall it was one of the best vienna lagers I've had."
"wow, 430 reviews as of this writing. amazing how many well known beers there are across the US that I don't get up here in NH. This one is a solid ambered color beer with a nice white head, bready malts and good light piney hops. Drinks quite well and when paired with a mild turkey chilli it went perfectly! Yes, I'd have another."
"Drinkability is great. This is a fantastic beer and very top notch. Easy drinkability combined with great flavor makes this a keeper. I'll be buying a few six packs to store up, and hopefully my store will continue to carry this."
"This would be a nice beer if it wasn't for the feel and that strange chemical/plastic/rubber flavor. As it is I'll still drink it, but I won't buy it again. This is the third beer I've had from this brewery and I'm still waiting to be impressed. They're not bad, but nothing to rave about in my opinon."
"Great Lakes Eliot Ness poured a nice deep full amber with a small tan head. The smell was of caramel and citrusy hops. Taste was full of sweet malt and caramel. Followed by a slight hop finish. Mouthfeeel was nice. Drinkability was pretty good, almost goes down to easy for 6.2ABV. Overall this was a very nice beer and spot on for the style. Will look for this beer again."
"This is a rather full bodied beer and really goes down smoothly. This is definitely a pleasant brew to drink. While nothing truly stands out, it is solid in all categories. Well worth a go."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable, the best lager I have ever had. That being said I would rather have a Burning River Pale Ale. At 6.1% ABV it was higher that I expected, but you cannot tell when drinking it, another great beer from Great Lakes."
"A pretty good Vienna lager from Great Lakes. Not great, but very easy to drink and enjoy."
"Another solid offering from the brewmasters at Great Lakes"
"Pours a somewhat murky dark red/brown with a lace ring down the glass. A mix of roasted and sweet malts dominate the nose. Medium-to-full body with a thick syrupiness making up its texture. A fruity taste along with sweet malts dominates the mouthfeel for a balanced beer that passes sweet and then has a minor drying backbite. Not a complex beer but a very enjoyable one."
"Drinkability: A fine Vienna lager, and one of the better American interpretations I've had. If you like the style, you'll love this beer - it's balanced, highly quaffable, of a reasonable alcohol level, and authentic. A definite session brew."
"D: I am new to lagers but if this is indicative of a Vienna Lager, I'm in! I could session this in a heartbeat. Very nicely done. Another cracking Great Lakes beer."
"D - Refreshing lager with an easy-drinking crispness. I could take a second glass but would look for another beer afterwards."
"D: Good beer. Not the best in the world, but very good. This is a reliable sixer whenever you need something good that will please multiple palettes."
"Note: After enjoying this beer, I noticed that it was three months past its freshness date. Eh, it was still pretty damn good."
"D) No real problems here. It's held up well past it's best by date, no off flavors. Malty, clean, easy drinking."
"Delicious amber ale from those Ohio guys (must be all them Germans out there!). Having some family out in Columbus definitely creates some anticipation on family visits, to say the least. A soft, dark-honey pour with unexpected bubbly carbonation that led to a minimal head with just slight lace retention. A sweet hoppy malt with mild hints of nuts was apparent both in the aroma as well as in the tasting. A good, decent ale that could lead to many more. I just wish to get it on draught next time."
"Thanks to Brian for sharing this at the Brick Store Pub. What a well crafted, very nice beer! Pours a beautiful reddish amber with a great head that's off-white and that hangs around. Smells grainy and even crackery with a nice dry, malty snap. The taste is beautifully balanced, being both malty and rich up front, but dry and with a crackery finish. Great for the style. Rich in the mouth but finishes crisp. I haven't enjoyed a beer of this style so much in a long time, if ever. Excellent."
"(D) A good, drinkable beer."
"date consumed: 14 Oct 2008"
"D- This is a nice beer to sip on while relaxing or socializing"
"(rated Nov 28, 2008)"
"What a balanced and tasty brew; much like everything that comes from GLBC. If you are looking for a session beer or you want to give your taste buds a hop break, look no further. Smooth."
"D: This is one of my favorites - big, tasty malt flavors to be had. Great mouthfeel and all around a very strong beer."
"Pours brown in color with ruby brown highlights around the edges. Nice frothy inch of head forms on the pour. Smell is all malt and some sweetness. Very metallic/off flavor in the taste. Gets a bit cloying as well. First beer I've had from Great Lakes that has been subpar."
"Overall, one of my favorite beers, ever. I'd love to try this with a meal and see how well it complements certain foods. I plan on keeping this on stock from this day forward. Bravo, Great Lakes!"
"Thanks, rhinos00, for the opportunity"
"Drinkability - Very nice. Try to savor the well crafted flavor. This beer obviously had a lot of attention put into it."
"D: Very drinkable; malt and hops in good balance with refreshing carbonation."
"Drinkability: The cloying flavor is a bit of a down note for this beer, but overall this is a decent amber and worth a taste for those who are fans of the style. It'd probably pair well with food, or it would be a decent beer for a get-together."
"I really enjoyed this beer. I would drink often if it was avalible in my area!"
"Lagers are usually one of my least favorite types of beer, but Great Lakes has two that I buy on a regular basis in this beer and their Dortmunder Gold. Both are great session beers which I highly recommend."
"This is a great Vienna Lager. Another great beer from the Great Lakes Brewing Company. Keep up the great work."
"D - easy to drink and very refreshing."
"Wow, what a colro pallete, deep copper amber to mild mahogany stain. Great two finger head after the pour, that very slowly recedes to nothing. The aroma is a beautiful toasted malt that makes me think of toasted biscuits with just a tocu of raw honey. The taste has an aire of peaches mixed in with the lovely toasted, biscuity malts. Fruits and bread in this viennese take on lager. Great sessionbility if they could jus lower the abv a touch."
"D: Overall fantastic beer, definetly the best Vienna Lager and likely the best Lager that I've had period. I actually thought this was an Amber Ale at first and I was even more impressed when I found out what it was. Big thumbs up, this would be one of those always on hand brews if the brewery was closer. Definetly need more Great Lakes!"
"M/D - Medium bodied and very crisp. Excellent carbonation."
"D- 6.2% alc, isn't terribly sessionable, but it's a nice Vienna."
"D: Very, very high. I could down these all day and night."
"What can I say, it's pretty damn good for an amber lager. It's one of those that you could start drinking and keep drinking all night. Alas, Great Lakes, why must you skip Indiana on your way to Illinois?!"
"D= All I can say is wow. This is the first lager I have been truly pleased by in years. Very beautiful, very flavorful. Highly recommended!"
"Notes: if you enjoy ambers or anything related to ambers than you owe it to yourself to try this. As with other Great Lakes Brewing Company beers I do recommend that it is enjoyed from the tap."
"d: very flavorful; a great blend in an amber lager"
"This lager truly deserves the gold medal: no hype here. The best Vienna lager I have tasted; you can sip on this substantial brew all evening."
"Yet another wonderful beer from Great Lakes. This lager pours a rich amber color and is topped with a thick creamy tan head. Mild carbonation and minimal lacing, this beer simply looks smooth. The aroma primarily consists of sweet malts, I am not able to catch the faint hop nose that is promised on the bottle. The flavor is outstanding for this style. The sweet malts are dominant, the hops although minimal do make themselves present in the taste. Maybe Mr. Ness just needed to warm up a bit. Thick creamy mouthfeel with a smooth finish. Excellent"
"As lagers go, this one is phenomenal."
"D - I'm not a huge fan of most lagers, but this was one that I didn't want to put down. It is very tasty and easy-drinking."
"Opinion: This is a pretty good with no noticeable flaws. A lot like a Sam Adams Boston Lager being a hop-led Amber Lager. I think that the flavor is more balanced with this one. This is a pretty nice beer and I think that I would drink it again."
"Drinkability: High on the drinkability scale, I picked a helluva time to get into good beers, but to think; I've had some of the best beers in the world on an unemployed wage. Beer is the working class' drink. But back to the point, I now think that, the 10$ price tag for this sixer is cheap, it's a change of mind state."
"D: The alcohol is a bit higher than most Vienna Lager's but not by too much and is completely hidden. Regardless of ABV, this is a great brew for any time of the year and probably an even better intro beer. Keep up the fantastic work, Great Lakes."
"Nice light orange amber color & off white head. Sweet roasty caramel taste invites you to keep sipping right off the bat. Very smooth and drinkable for how sweet it is. Could be more bitter to balance the sweetness, but it has a certain cripsness that keeps the sweet in check. I can't always find this but usually scarf up a 6pack when I do see it. Please start marketing in WI. I would love to find this one on tap."
"Great Lakes Brewing Company does classicly awesome stuff. Best Vienna Lager that I've ever had."
"I'm usually not a big fan of beers that gear towards the malty side but the balance and body of this really kept the drinkibility good for me. A very nice offering form Great Lakes."
"D- totally dude."
"Eliot Ness pours a clear ruby color and will change to rustic brown when held up to the light. A frothy small tan head sits upon this estically pleasing beer. Upon first smell I get tons of the malt scent hitting upfront with the earthy hops coming into play right behind it. I normally don't think of a beer style like this having this nice of a nose on it. As the beer warmed I got more scents of sweet caramel with toasted grains. The flavor profile is a perfect match when compared to the nose. The toasted grain comes through first with a bit of caramel sweetness to it as well and ends with a slight touch of hops in the finish. The mouthfeel is very smooth with great balance and the medium carbonation. The drinkable is very good on this offering and I would like to replace some IPA's in my rotation with this beer."
"Glad to experience this one again, in full glory. I guess the recent failed experiences came from bad kegs or something. I know Fatheads does a great job maintaining their stock, but perhaps the turnover isn't as high on EN as it is for the more exotic fare. Anyway, these fresh bottles were quite nice."
"D - I wish this was more readily available around here! This is a great beer."
"D : Easy to drink. Another fine beer from Great Lakes"
"D = Very good drinkability. Flavorful, well-balanced, refreshing. A very nice Vienna lager."
"Notes: Thanks Mike, really enjoyed this one."
"paired with clara's black n bleu burger (which was fantastic), they matched nicely as the black n bleu was cajun seasoned meat"
"D - It would be easy to drink if I liked the taste. I would normally say I would not revisit it but may to see if by any chance I had an off bottle."
"Mouthfeel was good, again I think for this beer balance seems to be the way to think. This is a highly drinkable beer and one of a nice field of offerings from great lakes."
"I was honestly supprised by this one. This is a great example of the style. Plus, it has complexity yet it is very approachable."
"D: Really easy to drink several in a sitting."
"I've had this offering from Great Lakes numerous times and have just never gotten around to reviewing it. Each time it continues to impress. The only constructive criticism that I have is that it's too light on the nose. Other than that, it's a hell of a fine beer. My hat's off to Great Lakes....once again."
"D- One of favorite Great Lakes. Easy to put these away."
"Drinkability is good. Tasty, light crisp balanced. A nice session beer."
"Appears dark amber with a thin white head. Very smooth lager. There a hint of vegetl DMS in the aroma with bready and light caramel malts. The flavor has a dry bread crust note and finishes with a mixture of balancing hops and juicy candy sweetness. This is so nice and sweet, it's almost like a sugar cookie with a touch of caramel."
"I've had this many times but never reviewed it, it's one of the reasons I love Great Lakes so much. Never a bad choice in any number of restaurants in OH."
"The body feels light but still has a lot of sweetness. Although does not have that unattenuated feel more with an under balance of bittering hops. To me, not a Vienna. Maybe fermented cold but nice amber."
"d-this beer is my go to since i live about 1/2 hour from the great lakes brewery. the beer is an amazing balance of flavor, feel, and taste and it can be had for sub $10 for a six. the taste is extremely pleasant, sweet but not too sweet, just a great blend. straightforward beer that delivers great balance and taste. highly recommended for anyone that appreciates good beer. 6.2% abv so you can enjoy a few. very pleasant any day beer."
"D_This is a very nice lager, sweeter than Sam Adams or Brooklyn but well balanced. I would drink this a lot if it was around more often. Thanks to Pimpp for the sample."
"Pours a dark amber with 1 finger head. Smell is grains and malt. Taste has a nice sweet grainy flavor with caramel malt and finishes smoothly with a little dose of hops. Mouthfeel was smooth and pleasant. Drinkability is good with a 6.2 abv. I'm not a lager guy, but this one has made me wonder. Best lager I've ever had. Cheers!"
"D: Great, I think I could drink these all night. The price is reasonable, but I think for the money, trader Joe's Vienna Style Lager is a better bet"
"I love this beer, It is a lager but rprised it was a lager.gain, sureally reminds me of a micro ale. A bit of a burned carmel te color is medium, the taste is burnt carmel but lighter than say Rouge ead Guy Ale. Again, surprised it ws a lager. Great Lakes won't stand out as the best brewery ever but, you can trust what they put out as great quality and true to style."
"I could drink this all night long. I am thankful for a great amber ale. Great Lakes has a lot going on, I need to visit their facility."
"D-Very easy to drink. Not a favorite of mine, but a worthy beer that merits a try."
"M&D: Mouthfeel is moderate with and creamy. The carbonation is moderate and persistent. The finish has a bit of levity to it that makes you want to take another pull. I think I could drink these all day! Very nice."
"D: This is very drinkable, I like this a lot, it is a nice change from an APA and would be a great session beer if the alcohol was a little lower. Likely to be a great ""gateway"" beer to introduce a friend to the wonders of good beer. Highly recommended. I love Great Lakes."
"Have to say I'm surprised at the scores for this one. I wasn't impressed at all. Pours a maroon transluscent color with a medium head. Smell is a bit sour, slightly skunky, and metallic tart maltiness. Not terrible, but not inviting...Taste is not crisp at all, but rather sour smooth caramel. While drinkable, I wouldn't recommend it. If this as as good as the style gets, maybe I just don't like Viennas as much as I though I did.."
"Looks acsolutely stunning in a glass. It's hard not to want to put the glass on the windowsill as a permanent fixture to your home; but doing so would be denying yourself the pleasure of tasting this brilliant brew. The aroma is intoxicating, the perfect blend of hops and barley; the flavor is full of malty goodness. Goes down easy, a real pleasure. One of the best beers out there. Makes me glad to live in Ohio where these are readily available."
"I can't say enough about Great Lakes Brewing Company. The beers I've tried have been outstanding, and this one is no exception. It poured a beautiful red-caramel color and the head stuck around throughout its entirety. Its nose was sweet and toasty, a hint of coffee. I really liked the taste, very smooth on the way down and just the right amount of carbonation. Full of malt, spice, caramel with a hint of chocolate. This was a complex tasting brew, but was refreshing at the same time, very drinkable."
"Notes: Definitley one of the best examples of a session brew that I've ever tried. Very balanced and very delicious. There's really nothing wrong with this beer; at least nothing wrong enough for me to write. If you want a great session beer then you know what to try."
"i looked forward to having this one ; pours a clear brownish-copper color w/ a thin, slightly off-white head which dissipates quickly leaving moderate-little lacing in my pint ; a mild malty aroma w/ lightly toasted caramel notes, very faint dark fruit detected as well ; a rich, grainy, full malt flavor, a profile much better than most vienna's i've had, a bit of a nutty, date-like undertone mid-way ; a med body, but drinks a bit fuller w/ the co2 giving it a creamy effect ; this is an exceptional brew, i regret only getting 6..."
"Pours a clear darker brown/amber with a nice off white head that falls and leaves a lot of lacing. Nose is minor leafy and earthy tones. Not much going on. Very minor touch of caramel and apples. Flavor has a tangy sweet tone to it, adding to an earthy profile. Just a slightly lower carbonation sits with a good liquid touch. This is easy to drink. I'd be interested to see this on cask."
"D: Very nice the first drink almost took me aback but as I gathered my taste buds i was able to ascertain the yumminess of this brew. The first Vienna Lager I've had. Very nice indeed!"
"D- This is another one that I have had available to me since I started craft beer and didn't try until now. It's wonderful-the perfect balance of citrus hops and caramel malt. Both Eliot Ness and Dortmunder are excellent lagers from Great Lakes."
"I've had quite a few of these before without much note; however, rating it has opened my senses to appreciate it more for what it is. It's a solid, high-quality versatile beer that could cheerfully be sipped, pounded (responsibly of course), or accompanied with most foods."
"Very, very drinkable. I could drink these all night. They go down very easy and arent overpowering by any means. And a bit bigger abv than many."
"Overall this was good I was very happy to see it on tap and it was defintily very nice going with dinner. I would not say this was excellent, however it was still a fine brew non the less. I would say it was a good call in a pinch."
"D-Defintiely up ther, I could drink all night or even woth the 6.2%, which really isn't all that high."
"Pours clear rustic amber hue with a one finger off-white head that slowly dies down to a thin layer of bubbles. Stickiness is damn good. Flowing lacing all over the sides. Musty caramel malt aroma up front with a leather like smoke scent. The faintest smell of pine hop in the nose as well. Salty wood flavors with a molasses sweetness up front on the tongue. Honey sweetness with a pepper spice too. Aftertaste is soft roasted oak. Pretty heavy for a lager, but enjoyable. Smooth carbonation on the tongue. The 6.2% was a shock, this is a damn good beer."
"Another great beer from Great Lakes. Could easily drink a good bit of these but the only downfall would be that it is a little heavy and that could get old after more than 2. Yet, still a beer I would go back to."
"Drinkability: A very lovely Vienna. I would have had another right this very minute if I had one chilled and ready. I would have been GLAD to!"
"Chicago"
"Buttery and smooth texture. Light carbonation and very velvety. Smooth and decadent finish. Really well constructed. Creamy and appetizing. Another awesome selection from Great Lakes."
"This appears to be a multi dimensional beer as it is not only a good thirst quencher but one you could also allow to be consumed at a slightly warmer temperature to bring out the nuances of the malt. Well crafted lager."
"Clear dark amber with a frothy beige cap with good retention and eventual nice lacing. Roasted barley, lightly fruity, and a very soft floral, faint pine hop character in the aroma. Very balanced flavors of roasted malts thats semi-dry and nutty with a slight dark chocolate bitterness and matched by fruity, bitter, faint peppery hop notes, and a very slight smoky, woodsy flavor at times. Nicely consistent from beginning to end. Smooth mouthfeel with a frothy to creamy carbonation."
"D - This is definitely a drinkable lager that has a nice balance of malts and noble hops. Decent, solid session beer with some nice flavors."
"Cant say that I am familiar with Vienna Lager as a style but I like this beer. It has a pleasant bready malted barley aroma balanced by a subtle European hoppiness. It has a clean dry taste with a rich full mouthfeel. I could drink these one after another and in fact have had three of them today."
"This is a very interesting beer. Good flavors but slightly different from most other beers of this style. The label states it as an amber but it's actually a vienna lager. Over all good beer in my opinion."
"Pours a clean copper color, with an off-white/ tan head. Aromas of a dry earthiness, and just a hint of sweetness. In the taste, malty with a dry end, kind of sticky-sweet too. A smooth mouthfeel and a dry maltiness in the aftertaste. Kind of Oktoberfest like, easy to drink and nice earthy malt."
"First things first I don't drink this beer nearly enough anymore, it used to be available throughout my area of WV brought in by Wine and Beverage Merchants of Weirton. Sadly someone down state decided to turn him in for selling beer above the 6% alcohol law that are fucked laws here in the DUB VEE endorse. Yes a beer at 6.2% alcohol by volume has been off the shelves for a couple years now, due to some asshole in my state. Now that I got to vent, here goes Eliot Ness ruby caramel vibrant bright crystal clear body with a large beige head forming thick in my 1/2 liter mug lacing is even and simply clings to the sides of my glass. Aroma here has it all with roasted nuts toffee/caramel slightly burnt brown sugar flow going on with spicy German hops a flowing in the background. Also a mild air of citrus peel floats around what a great spicy hop profile, thank god I'm living in Ohio at least alcohol laws are in check. Now I have to start convincing stores to carry a selection and get Cavalier Distributing involved in this region of the state. Flavor has a pronounced funky hop flow with spicy herbal edges and tangy citrus peels flowing with mildly bitter darker roasted malts bringing out a touch of dark chocolate melted over one of your favorite toffee or caramel filled candy bar think Heath sans as much chocolate. Mouthfeel is so nice carbonation is perfect creamy layers divide on the palate with slick hop oils also gracing my palate overall beautifully crafted medium bodied micro brewed beer at it's best. Drinkability is butter, it caresses you. The best Vienna style lager I've come into contact with thank god I understand this style due to a single beer because there's not many great representations out there."
"Simple and pleasant, a good Vienna lager, perhaps a tad more hopped than the average."
"Pours a nice copper color with a thin white head. Not much retention,but good lacing. Aroma is of sweet bready malts. Medium bodied, this beer has little carbonation. Taste is of sweet,breads,and fruit, but there is a touch of hops.Full flavored,yet light,and refreshing. Excellent."
"This is a very tasty, easy to drink example of an amber lager. extremely drinkable. I found some of this in Ohio and brought it back to NC. I'm already scheming to find a reason to go back."
"A. Looks the type as a typical Amber Lager. S. Has a bit of a subdued smell, not very powerful or round like most Amber. T. Just an average taste, kind of let down as all Great Lakes beers are generally superior, has a true microbrew taste but not overwhelming, a bit acidic, lingering aftertaste. M. Solid mouthfeel, a nothing remarkable. D. goes down nice, decent beer, would prefer draft to bottle on this one in particular."
"Overall, a really solid amber lager. Worth investigating if you haven't tried it."
"I give this beer an overall score of 4.4 out of 5."
"The beer pours an amber color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great. It has a creamy, pale, Vienna, and crystal malt scent. It's smooth and sweet with a slightly dry lager yeast aroma. The taste is awesome. As far as lagers go, this is one of the best around. It's got excellent malt character as well as a smooth, creamy finish. It goes down easy with a slight breadlike quality in addition to a lager dryness. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn good lager. It's full of malt flavor and is easy drinkable; a real gem of a beer."
"Drinkability: I like this beer, but would let the Dortmunder edge it out overall. A great beer."
"Really great beer and a credit to Great Lakes."
"Into a pint glass, pours a lovely dark orange copper tone with a solid inch of off-white head, decent retention, down to a nice filmy foam in a few minutes, lacing in falling sheets and thick webbing. The aroma is kind of forgettable, but lots of bready caramel malts wafting about, Noble spicy hops swirling about. The taste follows suit, with a more defined hop spice and the malts start off bready then roll over caramels, quite delicious. The mouth is over medium, somewhat creamy but also nicely carbonated, pretty solid. In all, its a beer that'd make me a lager lover, and thats saying a lot."
"This is a beer that I would recoment to someone thats trying to get into better beers. I could see myself saying, ""here's a good example of a good ole american amber lager!"""
"Drinkability: I was sorry to see the bottom of the glass here. Another would be magic on a lazy afternoon or evening."
""
"Pours a nice red amber color with a nice head and great lacing. The nose is high on malt, with a touch of grain. Flavor is fairly similar; lots of caramel, dried fruit, and a touch of strawberries in there too. Feel is solid, full bodied, and good on carbonation. This one was a tasty surprise in a Great Lakes variety pack. Definitely check it out."
"I had an Elliot Ness right after having a Dortmunder Gold. While both are great, Im going to go for the Elliot Ness first when Im at this bar. Its an incredibly flavorful brew, with excellent drinkability, even on a hot Ohio summer night."
"Very good beer by my standards."
"12 ounce bottle with a best by date of 8/14/07. The beer pours an amber/red color with about an inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both good. It smells like toasted malt, some grassy hops and some caramel. The taste starts off with malty sweetness, and then has a good hoppy bitter finish. Good, full flavor with this beer. Mouthfeel is medium, it's a little bit creamy and slick with just the right amount of carbonation. It has a coating finish which sticks around in my mouth for a while. Drinkability is pretty good, it goes down smooth and easy. Great choice for a session beer. I'd recommend it to anyone to try."
"Drinkability is high with decent balance and nothing overpowering."
"Drinkability: This is yummy, but it's not one I could session with."
"All in all a very good beer but the overall taste was a bit off, at least compared to the other ambers I've tried. Would pick this up again but check the freshness date next time."
"Thought I'd get around to reviewing this beer, because I enjoy it. Pours a clear dark rusty color with a sizable tan head that casually fades. Nose is malts and cereal grains, with some hops, and nice deep molasses sweetness. Like those candies grandma used to chew. Taste is biscuity sweet malts up front, then hops and a honey-sweet finish. Mouthfeel is good and full, very nice. Drinkability is quite high. Great brew."
"Drinkability: I recommend this fine beer from GLBC. Time for another..."
"D - Overall a good beer, definitely better than boston lager. Crisp and clean tasting with a good solid flavor. Definitely worth the effort."
"d - overall a nice beer but i was disappointed in the appearance."
"On its own, or paired with pizza, this is a real gem and stands out for its style."
"This is a very tasty beer. Good example of the style and very enjoyable; another great beer from Great Lakes."
"Altogether a great brew and one of the best lagers Ive ever had."
"The Elliot Ness pours from a 12 oz. bottle to a ruby copper liquid. A bubbly head leaves nominal lacing. Smell is malt with a caramel sweetness. Taste is a again the malty caramel with some sweet fruit as well. Complex. Just enough hops to keep it from being too sweet. For a complex lager they go down very easy. Nice balanced brew."
"this is just a solid beer and i may have appreciated it more if i had in in solitude. tried it at the venerable hopleaf between many other tasty beers. pours a deep red/amber with great clarity and a tan, off-white, creamy head. great lacing. smell is dominated by the caramelly, toffee-ish malts and some vegetal, floral european hops. nice malt sweetness at first in the mouth somehow balanced by the underlying, supporting hops with an almost dry, crisp finish. medium bodied and great mouthfeel. i could have had several of these but there were more beers to try. went great with the mussels and pommes frites."
"This is a truly awesome lager. I've never had one quite like it. I limited myself to one last night but it left me wanting more. Great Lakes makes some of the best lagers around. I have never disliked any of their products. A must try!"
"Pours a nice reddish amber color with a off white one finger head with fair retention and lacing. Aroma is all sweet malts. Smooth malts with hints of sweetness. Some orange present. Very bready. Mouthfeel is smooth and refreshing. Very drinkable. Great session choice."
"Poured out a honey brown color with a creamy off white head, medium lacing. Nose was a funkadelic, with some green malt and other fresh smelling notes. The taste was like a straight up lager. This came accross like MGD to me. Mouthfeel consisted of a medium body and low carbonation. Not a challenging drink, but not an enjoyable one either. Translation: easy drinking, but who would want to?"
"Mouthfeel is smooth due to the ample, balanced carbonation. Would be a great choice for a summer session."
"Just as good as I remember. Great Lakes worst beers are simply very good, and this one is definitely above that. An outstanding beer and great example of the genre. This would pair exceptionally well with a grilled steak, a marinated beef, spicy pork, cheddar cheese...a very versatile food beer. Highly recommended....again!"
"D: The beer's malty sweetness fits nicely in the style. Frankly, regardless of the style, this beer is a good drink."
"All told, this is a solid, pretty tasty lager and drinkable as hell."
"Has a nice lager flavor, with chocolate malt, hints of caramel and very sweet finish. Some spice too I cant finger. Very drinkable and well balanced all the way around."
"D: Very tasty, goes down very easily, not very filling, good kick, very good representation of style, this is a very good beer that I could drink for a whole evening, yet another excellent beer from Great Lakes."
"Drinkability: This is a great lager - anyone who thinks lagers are boring should sit down and have one of these. Sessionable for sure. Not surprising to see it's the highest rated Vienna Lager."
"Poured into a pint glass. Very nice, very clear reddish brown look with bit of head that goes away fast leaving very little lacing - no stickiness on the sides of the glass either. The smell is sweet and toasty - honey is definitely present. Taste is very rich - roasted malts, honey sweetness, and a nice crisp & dry finish. Mouthfeel is good - some decent carbonation melds well with the malty creaminess. This is an easy drinking/great tasting beer. Easily something you could sit down with and drink a 6 pack with friends; would be a nice beer to marinade with, I'd bet. Highly recommended."
"This really is an exceptional beer. So smooth and perfectly balanced, I could drink it all night. Fantastic. Maybe the best lager I've ever had the pleasure to drink."
"Cheers!"
"A solid, tasty, easy to drink lager that you can't go wrong with in your fridge."
"Overall a very good and drinkable beer. Very refreshing and easy to drink but still complex and rewarding."
"Very nice session beer."
"D: You pay for the lack of adjuncts. It's damn good, but when I get a 24 of the Y for $17 (in cans) and this would be $28, well...see my point? Who cares. This is excellent. If this was thier signature beer and was in every bar like Dortmunder, I'd be a happy camper."
"A somewhat inbalanced beer with a too strong hop bitterness that klingers in the mouth."
"solid beer....Yum"
"This is definitely an easy drinker. My first beer from Great Lakes and if they are all as well done as this, I look forward to tasting them. I really dig this beer."
"Taste very nice caramel malts with a nice hop balance. More malty than hoppy. This had a crisp mouthfeel as well. I love these beers because they give a malt fix and a hop fix without being over bearing and are very sessionable. A great beer to start the night with or to make a session with."
"Mouthfeel was smooth but there was some zestiness from the carbonation. Nice overall."
"Mouthfeel is extremely substantial for a lager, and feels appropriate. I found this beer to be very drinkable."
"Pours a clear dark amber color, nice carbonation, small fizzy head that leaves quickly, some lacing afterwards. The nose is of sweet malts, hops, and caramel. The taste follows the nose, sweet and malty, nice touch of caramel. Light-Medium body. Drinkable, a nice offering from Great Lakes."
"Nice Vienna in this taste of Great Lakes Day."
"On the palate the beer is creamy and carbonation doesn't get in the way but is high enough to notice without focusing on it. Definitely better on tap than in the bottle. Overall a great brew that hits the spot in the late fall and srping."
"This beer poured a red amber color no too dark but dark enough. It had a creamy off-white head. Had a storng aroma of roasted malt and hops and some coffee to it. It tasted very malty and it finished witha a very nice hop induced bitterness that was refereshing. Oeral a very attractive beer that reminded me a bit of Dead Guy Ale and was equally attractive to me."
"There is a slight astringency that I am getting on the finish that is keeping the mouthfeel down a bit. Still, for the flavor and the overall enjoyment factor I still have to count this as extremely drinkable."
"I found this to be more of an American red ale than a vienna lager, although it is maltier than a red, way maltier but deeper than a vienna. That being said this is like the big brother of an Oktoberfest. Pours a tight creamy head, leaving tons of lacing down the glass. Tasted great with pork and sauerkraut! Has slight burnt chocolatey notes and some plumy fruit, caramelly crisp as well. Nice thick body and pours a nice red amber color. A great session brew and another top notch, great lakes brew!"
"Ordered this on-tap at a small concert venue. Quick possibly the definition of an ""easy"" craft beer: you know you're getting good quality beer, but it's not terribly complex and very simple to enjoy. Pour a clear medium brown - small head on it with a bit of retention. In terms of smell and taste, it's a good balance of lightly toasted grains and floral hops. No really significant flavors stood out, but the mix of flavors again made this an easy beer to enjoy. Medium mouthfeel - a tad watery for my taste. Very, very drinkable. As I said, easy to enjoy."
"Pours copper with a small head with lots of tiny carbonation bubbles. the beer leaves behind a fair amount of lace. The aroma has lots of sweet malt and floral hops. The flavor is medium-heavy hopped and a good amount of bitterness. Body is medium-light. A good beer. The is only the second Great Lakes beer I've tried. The first was a dissapointment, so this is a pleasent surprise."
"Drinkability: one of my favorite year round glbc beers. 6.2% abv makes it very drinkable."
"The drinkability is good, Nothing wrong here. Prosit MK"
"drinkability is great. nice and refreshing and well balanced."
"Autumnal red and gold body with a solid finger of dense, sandy head. Very nice looking beer for the first day of fall. Caramel covered fruit nose with toasted vegetal pepper spice and soft cookie dough malt. Caramel-soaked cookie dough malt flavors up front gain a toasted, slightly rummy sweetness before vegetal spice bitterness does an excellent job of balancing it all. Long, enjoyable finish. Medium bodied, with a creamy feel. Very easy drinking. Viva this Vienna!"
"Overall a wonderful brew. Easily sessionable, excellent flavor and complexity, very smooth."
"GLBC has far better offerings then this, especially in the lager department. A pass in my book."
"Drinkability- Very easy drinking."
"D: Definately reminiscent of an Oktoberfest. Not bad."
"Well-rounded and full of flavor. It's proof that prohibition was a crime against nature."
"Hat's off to Great Lakes!"
"D: Not the best tasting beer, I wonder if I got a bad batch"
"Mouthfeel is clean and crisp, slight increase in heaviness towards the finish. A bit more interesting than its stylistic peer negra modelo, but would be just at home paired with spicy mexican food. Very solid 4's across the board."
"The pour into my Spaten becker glass raises a fast-falling light tan head with large bubbles, over a deep, dark ruby copper body. The lacing is substantial. The nose is very mild, just hints of sweet caramel and graininess come to me, along with a distinct suphury smell that adds a lot. Perhaps there are some English malts in here. The taste is really subdued, but quite nice. There's a perfect, light balance between the malty goodness and bitterness. Caramel is definitely present. The mouth is medium, with fine carbonation, which I've noticed already in other GL beers. Very smooth, yet still refreshing. This is a very well crafted, balanced beer that is a joy to drink. It would possibly convert macro drinkers well, too."
"Eric"
"D - About as good as it gets. This is a very drinkable, very flavorful beer. This one could easily become my everyday drinker."
"Slainte!"
"Drinkability is very good here. I like this beer but not as much as the Edmond Fitzgerald."
"Beer pours out a nice amber/reddish color, with a nice two finger head. There is good retention and lacing as well. Smell is fairly mild, with some nice malt, caramel/toffee, and some hoppy aromas. Taste is excellent, with a nice sweet body, again dominated by malt and caramel/toffee, but balanced with just enough bitterness. Very nice full mouthfeel and goes down smooth. Great brew!"
"The Eliot Ness holds a special place in my heart. I had been drinking what I thought was 'better' beer for awhile. (Guinness, SABL, etc.) But, the first time we went to the store and picked out something totally random we ended up with Eliot Ness."
"D-This is a nicely balanced, easy drinking beer."
"A great Vienna. A favorite lager."
"The moderate carbonation and medium-heavy body meld nicely to give this a crisp, creamy mouthfeel. I found this to be very enjoyable all around. This is something I could easily drink on a regular basis. Well done and nicely balanced."
"Oh yes. This poured a nice ruby brown color with a 1 inch high frothy tan head. There was a low amount of carbonation. The aroma is really malty and dark fruit-like. There is a hint of caramel alcohol. The taste is malty but also nicely hopped. The caramel is there too but overall this tastes kinda like a belgian, im not sure why though. This was slightly warming to the belly after the 1st sip. THe mouth was dry, crisp and sticky. I could drink quite a few of these even though the alcohol is detectable. There is loads of flavor here. Nicely balanced."
"Smooth, tasty and easy to drink. I would love to have this as a regular in my refrigerator."
"Be very careful with nessy though.... this is undoubtedly the smoothest 6+ abv on the planet, and could get the average sessioner in quite a bit of trouble if he/she loses count/track of time."
"Moderate mouth with crisp carbonation. This could make a great dinner beer. Solid fours all around."
"The mild spiceness and balance of hops and malt make this a great beer to go with just about any savory dish one could image-I enjoyed it with pizza, but looking forward to new combinations."
"Drinkability is good. The beer is a little too complex and carbonated to serve as a summertime hot weather beer though. This is more of a go to the bar and shoot the shit type of beer."
"Bright amber color with medium tan head that lingers thru half glass and good lacing. Aroma was apples and bananas, with a hint of grapes. Initial flavor was the fruits, some hops and malt. At mid-glass, taste became more malty, and alcohol, though only 6.2 ABV, was more noticeable. A good smooth warming finish. I had heard there were freshness and dating questions with these Great Lakes Brews, but Ive had no complaints so far with this or Dortmunder."
"I had this on tap at the Great American Ballpark during a Reds game and was impressed. This poured a deep amber with a medium tan foamy head that looked almost perfect. The smell is very malty with a sweet carmel aroma to it. The taste is a nutty,chewy malt filled, explosion. The malt really is the star of the show here,but there is a creamness to this that's very good. The m/f is medium with the flavors balancing very well. This is an excellant beer and kudos to the Reds for having this on tap."
"I really liked everything about this beer. The color was a very nice, clear amber/reddish with a bit of tan colored foam at the top. The smell was pleasant and not overwhelming, but gave off the scent of hops and some toasted malts, much like the taste. I was very impressed by the taste and how smooth this beer was. I definitely caught a bit of toffee/caramel somewhere in there, which was a nice surprise. Overall drinkability is very very high on this one..."
"drinkability: good"
"This is a very drinkable beer and is one I will definately be frequenting after this one."
"Who knew that a Vienna Lager could taste so good. From the bottle, the beer smells like fruit cake without all of the plastic-y and potpouri flavors. Simple and pure. Rich in dark (dehydrated) fruits of dates, figs, nuts,... Sweet fruits are structured with a big bready flavor and aroma. Full and round in the mouth. Not too sweet or heavy. Finishes very clean for such sweetness. A little added alcohol keeps the beer interesting. Seems to give a little in the body and roundness compared to the tap version. Still, a best-of-Style contender."
"A fair offering. Pours out to a reddish amber color with a short lived head of off white orange foam, and rings of uniform lace. Lower carbonation. Aromas of roasted rich malts, bread, yeast notes, some earth. Not bad. Taste is medium bodied yet still rather rich. Flavors of rich malt and a touch of alcohol are first noted, and then the beer kind of goes away. Hints of bitter hops and biscuts are noted, but not much else. Mouthfeel is bland and unexciting. Drinkability is average. Worth trying, but GLBC has better offerings."
"Great American lager...one of my favorites."
"Drinkability: A great Vienna lager that goes down easy and would match perfectly with chicken."
"This is a clean, balanced beer. It starts sweet, but bitterness comes in at the end. Don't expect to be overpowered by hops though. Eliot Ness doesn't stray from it's german roots. It's an impeccable vienna style lager."
"It has ben over 2 years nice I have had this got in in a trade with LeopoldStoch. poured a nice dark amber, with a light tan head that left some lacing.aroma brown sugar, malts a little sourness. flavor a nice sweet malt with a caramel kick to it followed by a touch of hops. just going to tweek the rating just a bit.4/30/04amber with nice lasting head nice copper color nice smooth malty with a little fruit with a touch of bitterness . GOOD BEER"
"Drinkability - goes down fairly easy, the diacetyl is the hang up here for me. Still, it's a good beer in spite of it. In fact, I really liked the first part of the taste before the diacetyl finishing part...oh well, I'd have a couple of these in a session on occassion."
"Pours a beautiful dark amber with a medium head. The smell had a malty aroma with a hint of caramel to it. The taste was full of malty body with a medium hop bitterness to it. I didn't believe that the slightly higher alcohol content had any adverse effect on the taste.The mouthfeel was smooth with a medium carbonation and went down easilly. This is an excellent dark lager that is easy to drink and enjoy, and is now one of my favorites. I would highly reccommend it."
"Eliot Ness pours with a minimal head atop a beautiful, crystal clear body with a red-tinged amber color. The aroma is pretty thin, with just a touch of sweet, toffeeish malts present. That trend doesn't hold up for the taste, though, which is full and deep while maintaining a quintessential lager smoothness. There's a sweet, tea-like character first off, which morphs into toasted malts and caramel. Really well done. The beer is smooth throughout, and the carbonation is perfect for the style. This is an interesting, pleasing beer, one that makes you want to drink more. One of the best American lagers I've had."
"D: Very drinkable."
"Clean finish, crisp and dry  just a tad thin. The 6.2% make it a little tough for a session brew, but a good performer nevertheless."
"A touch of sweetness and bitter tree bark lingers after the sip. The aftertaste is quite long, and quite good. However, it keeps this from being a session beer."
"GLBC always seems to make beers that are a good benchmark for whatever style they are offering."
"Poured a dark, reddish copper, very dark, yet very clear body with a thick, fluffy head that laced the entire glass. The nose was very malty, biscuity, with a citrusy, piny nose with the slightest floral. The taste was sweet maltiness, a little caramelly, waxy hop that finished grassy. Very good drinking beer, it is a clean drinker. Had this with an egg and cheese sandwich on bagel with spanakopia, went very well."
"Very drinkable but will re-review from bottle for the smell of this beer. One I can pour."
"Overall: Excellent brew! Definately a staple in my fridge and one of the best brews I've had in a while. I've never been dissapointed with a brew from Great Lakes and this does nothing to change my mind. It looks like Great Lakes brews are starting to monopolize my fridge. An awesome brew from an awesome brewery."
"A very easy to drink beer which is pretty much what lagers are all about in the first place. Tasty yet easy to drink this is a great choice for a session beer."
"D: I haven't had too many brews in this style, but I imagine that it would hang with the best of them. Great taste and mouthfeel make this an excellent session beer."
"D- I could probably get through 2 or 3 of these before switching to something else. The sweetness and lack of hops gets to be a bit much for me to consider this a session brew. But I'm the same way with SA Boston Lager."
"O--Its got malt, so you'd better like malts, but have no fear, just enough hops to finish. Well worth a try. I found it simply awesome. This is in regular rotation. Great Lakes has always impressed me with their traditional tastes and they are right on here."
"Drinkability is good, but not great."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: This is a medium beer with a very nicely creamy texture. Dam this beer is tasty. Bring me some more."
"Bright amber with sufficiently frothy off-white head. Bit of hop spice aroma on an inviting caramel malt base. Sweet (but not too sweet) maltiness with just the right amount of hop bitterness at the finish and a wonderful biscuity aftertaste. Light-medium body with a juicy mouthfeel. Easy to put several of these back. Solid brew, yet again, from Great Lakes."
"D- This is a smooth soft lager but it has nice depth and good qualities that give in more dimension."
"Drinkability couldnt be any better."
"The first sip reveals an average body with rolling fine carbonation, the beer glides across my palate. Flavor is sweet, as the nose advertises, with caramel and toffee again and a roll to some slight roasty graininess. The beer is smooth and enjoyable with no hint of alcohol. Not an overly robust beer but tasty nonetheless."
"The taste of this was pretty good, not great though. Detected some hops and some caramel. Similar to a Sam Adams Boston Lager, but not as sweet. Overall, a good beer though."
"Here's the deal. It's a beer that I would love to have in a keg at a party, but I would never pay for it myself again in a bottle, in a keg, or at a bar. It beats macro lagers and some poor micro brews, but that's it. I love that it goes down smooth and has 6.2% alcohol, but it's not worth it because it doesn't taste good."
"very drinkable no matter the weather, great with burgers, veggie burgers"
"A very good drinkable brew."
"Overall: Another great one from GLBC, just a supremely-crafted clean lager. I like it a lot."
"This is an amazing malty treat. Very nice. I will be returning to get more of this brew."
"The taste was very sweet, with a hop-bitterness undertone. It got slightly more complex as it warmed, but still was a little much on the sweetness. It was clean and crisp with little carbonation and I could easily see myself having a few of these, but only a few. The sweetness might get a bit much, and also I could see it masking a decent ABV. However, overall an good suprise from GL."
"Notes: A great representation of the style."
"The taste is definitely sweet, though thankfully not nearly as much as the aroma might expect. There are fruity notes of raisins and again a hint of cherry. The hops have a nice, though subtle, contribution here that is lightly spicy, every so slightly herbal and a nice balancing bitterness in the finish. As the beer warms up the sweetness picks up a bit, at times it becomes a bit too much. Most of the time it is held in check by the hopping levels and the under-current of dry maltiness; like notes of biscuits and lightly toasted malt. This beer certainly blows most examples of the style out of the water, but I can't help but think that this would be that much better if it had not finished a little bit drier; it would be a bit more in balance and all that much more quaffable."
"another winner from a very fine brewery."
"Poured a light amber colour with a beige head that slowly melted down to a thin layer of bubbles. Only traces of lacing in the glass. Smooth malt flavour to start but finishes rather dry with a bit of a spicy bite that lingers until the next sip. A very delicious and drinkable beer."
"Cheers!!!"
"Drinkability- Truthfully, I'm not sure what a Vienna Lager is supposed to taste like, but it's a pretty tasty brew. The sweetness works good with the malt flavor. Not really a session beer for me, but a nice chance of pace beer for sure. Thanks for the sample Biglove!"
"-UF"
"Ok an American amber that is called a Vienna lager. I guess I dont know the style too well. No matter what style, this is still pretty good. Amber as described on the bottle. Malty smell and taste. Slight sourness on the finish. A fine amber beer. Pretty basic but good."
"another great one from GLBC"
"Deep amber colored body with a perfectly proportioned beige head made this a very attractive looking beer. The beer was well carbonated, but not fizzy. Aromatically clean and unobtrusive, the beer had a malty, floral, sweetish smell. The taste was also pleasant, with a toffee like sweetness, spicy hops, and a touch of mandarin orange sourness. There was not much hop bitterness, but the well attenuated beer did not suffer much because of it. Very clean and easy drinking beer with a simple but flawless construction typical of classic German styles."
"Pours a clear bright red color. The head is huge, creamy, and white with reddish hues. The aroma is malty and fruity. The taste is sweet with some cherries, but some how lacks complexity. The mouthfeel is light bodied, and slight over carbonated. Overall, this is far from being a bad brew, but I would choose Sam Adams Boston Lager over this one any day."
"This would be one hell of a session ale if it didn't pack such a kick. It still goes down like fruit juice, though."
"An excellent full bodied lager. Very complex taste, filled with an almost fruity, yet deep and sophisticated body. Deep amber color, but a bit light on the head, and the smell was a little weak (though it is tough to be too critical on this point as it taste damn good). The mouthfeel is near perfect. One of the best beers I've had in a long, LONG while. You will not be dissapointed. Be sure to note, my few objections with this beer in the end don't matter a bit, it's damn near perfect."
"Pours a magnificent shade of red amber, with a two fingers of tan foam crowning over streaming carbonation; leaves delicate patchwork of lace. Medium bodied and nearly translucent. Excellent head retention. Smells of sweet toasted malt, german and floral hops. Marvelous balance of toasted malt and Noble hop flavor. Very smooth with a sweet but mostly clean finish. If you are in the Cleveland area, be advised it is well worth the trip to the brewery for the freshest beer possible."
"Drinkability: very well balanced; makes a fine session"
"For United States microbreweries Great Lakes ranks close to Victory in quality of lagers and this beer alongside their Dortmunder are prime examples. I struggle to find top-end lagers that are domestic and fresh, and this is one. I will note, even more than ales, a lager like this must be found fresh and due to geography I'm blessed to do so. When I used to get Great Lakes bottles in Philadelphia they were most often toast."
"Drinkability: This beer would make an excellent choice for a session beer and summer beer. To me this was a little bit better than their Dortmunder. This a beer that I would buy again and easily found in theses parts."
"This beer poured a copper/amber color with a light tan head that held it's own for several minutes, and then hung around the rim for the length of the beer. the aroma is of a watered down hops and slight wet paper and caramel. The taste is of toasted malt and caramel. the bitterness leaves it it dry in the end and quite ""bitey"". Its light bodied which is good, but really slight on the all-around flavor. It's a nice summer time beer."
"A real creamy feel in the mouth and easy to sit and enjoy. A great brew with food or alone."
"A fine lager to enjoy with a meal, or anytime."
"Taste: Very very sweet, but a good hop bite to counter. There's an aftertaste I wasn't thrilled about at first, but it grew on me."
"One of my favorite from Great Lakes and quite an interesting style. This would probably be the one I would order a second and study (and enjoy) more carefully. Nice lacing and head. Creamy with caramel and toffee scents and tastes. Dances on the tongue. Pretty easy to drink, but not all evening long."
"Drinkability: A very well executed German lager style, with excellent taste. Enjoyable drinkability."
"Overall, a good, drinkable lager - one that I'll certainly come back to (and could certainly make a decent session beer)."
"Drinkability: Good. Not spectacular overall, but a very interesting beer nonetheless. No problem drinking them. This will not become a preference for me though."
"Pours a beautiful amber color, with a minimal head. Aroma is rich and carmelly. Taste is strange, I get a funky, almost lactic acid taste. Perhaps it's the hops that I'm pick up, but it's odd. Crisp enough, but not floral hops, it's spicy. Some toasty notes from the malt, but this is a hop driven brew. I need more sweetness and malt in my Viennas. Mouthfeel is adequate, crisp and nice there. Overall, not an awful beer, but there are much better ones from Great Lakes."
"Slàinte!"
"Hazy, dark honey colored, thick looking. A half inch of thick beige foam rises up and then just sits there, not moving. Inviting aroma of banana and butterscotch, sweet malt and honey. Flavor is rich and chewy, heavy malt and caramel, some tangerine in the back of the mouth, followed by a mild hop flourish, and a bitter orange peel linger. Mouthfeel is thick and full, moderate carbonation. Really good beer, very drinkable."
"Strongly recommended."
"Bottle: Poured a mid-brown color beer with an above average white foamy head with good retention. Nice malty aroma with some roastiness and some nuts. Taste is quite malty with a smooth creamy taste and light bitterness at the end. Body is fuller then expected and probably fuller then most Vienna I tasted before. Overall, this is real good stuff."
"This beer pours out an attractive clear amber color with a foamy head and lots of bubbles. Strong grain aroma, a little like hay, along with nuts and spice. Nice malt flavor up front with some caramel. Nutty in the body. The finish comes with some slightly spicy hops. Medium mouthfeel. This is a highly quaffable beer, and it's no trouble drinking several. Another good beer from GLBC. They are becoming one of my favorite American breweries."
"This beer is certainly due any and all glory. One that you will want to rerun over and over. A must try for your ""folder"" from that notorious Cleveland gang."
"This is a hell of a lager! I think I just found a great summer beer. Shit, it doesn't even have to be summer, it would be top notch any time."
"All said this is a nice lager, something that would make a good session drink. Many thanks to Praneel for bringing me this beer from Ohio."
"Pours a beautiful caramel-copper color, with a thick and creamy tan head. Smells of caramel, toasted nuts, and spicy hops. Taste is biscuits, roasted nuts, caramel, all in all, just very malty and delicious. The hops balance this beer out perfectly. The mouthfeel of this beer is very creamy smooth. I would have no problem putting down six of these. Now to find this stuff on tap."
"Pours a clear amber/reddish color. Thick foamy off-white head. Good retention and lace all about on the glass as I finished. Big rich toasted malt aroma, slightly herbal. Good chewy toasty malt flavor, along with some caramel malt flavors. Slightly sweet in the finish. Very clean flavors, balanced by just a good touch of herbal hops with slight bitterness. Light to medium body, good amount of carbonation. This is top-notch for a vienna lager. Another solid winner from GLBC."
"Drinkability: Well, this is a fine brew that sits easy with spicy food and certainly can be a session beer for me! Lots of character in this brew and that is what GLB seems to do so well in all their offerings. Bravo!"
"Overall: An excellent brew. I wish I lived closer to Ohio so I could enjoy it more often."
"Pours a nice burnt umber color with a creamy two fingers of head. Excellent head retention down to the last with some good lacing. Great estery aroma, with some caramel and roasted scents coming up as well. Slightly sharp up front going into a nice toasted flavor. The hops balance this well, but do not overpower. It stays smooth the whole way through. It finishes dry with little aftertaste."
"It pours a gorgeous deep red amber with a generous ivory white head. The smell is a sweet malty aroma without a hint of bitterness, though that may be slightly misleading. The flavor is a perfect balance of caramel malt and earthy hops. At 35 IBU, its certainly not an aggressively hopped brew. The experience finishes with a bittersweet chocolate espresso aftertaste."
"Pours a nice amber copper color with a good two finger head that leaves nice lacing on the glass. The smell is good but very subtle. Mostly sweet malts. The taste is absolutely wonderful. Malty sweet with a little more hop flavor than I was expecting, but it worked very nicely. Very tasty and easy to drink. The hop bitterness along with the carbonation makes this beer feel alive in the mouth. I really enjoyed this."
"Tasted: 01/11/05"
" Overall I enjoy this lager , dispite the slight hop bitterness overwhelming the malty flavor and body."
"Pours a dark amber color with a tall and creamy tan head that slowly gives way to a nice lace. Nose is roasted malts and grains with some underlying notes of chocolaty cocoa. Fairly full-bodied with a slightly chewy texture. Taste begins with sweet malts with notes of dark caramel and toffee followed by a bit of bread dough and a hint of roasted pecans giving way to some mildly acidic hops towards the finish to help round out the maltiness. A definite winner."
"This brew has a clear, dark amber colored body, with a big khaki foam head. The scent is clean, lagered sweet malts. Tastewise, mainly clean vienna malts, caramel with bits of chocolate. A nice bitter hop flavor tries to dominate. Nice smooth mouth. This is about as good as it gets for this style."
"This amber lager was quite sturdy. A nice brownish reddish amber color, with a nice bit of tan head that rests on top and retains itself pretty far down the beer. Lacing on a lager? I'm impressed. Smells of light but sweet toasted malts and yeast. Taste is very floral and well balanced with the malts and the hops teaming up to create a nice smooth and sweet boquet of goodness. Nice and wheaty too. Great smooth medium mouthfeel and a pleasure to drink. A great session beer in fact, but get the sampler if available because the other beers are pretty awesome too."
"I was quite impressed with this little guy. A nice amber lager with lots of character. The beer has a nice head that doesn't last long but leaves a nice lacing. The smell is a little off...some kind of vegetable in the nose. The taste is great. Lots of biscuit-type tastes in the malt profile. Hops are good...they seem to mask a bit of a smoky taste in this lager. Moving to the middle I can detect some raisin and fruitcake flavors. Almost reminiscent of a barleywine. This is an amazing Amber Lager. Check it out, y'all!"
"Pours a two-fingered white head that fades slowly leaving some lace. Cloudy amber color. Hoppy nose. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Starts with a mix of hops and malt with the hops dominating, some sweetness, finish is clean and hoppy with some bitter after taste. $1.49 for a 12oz bottle from Liquor Barn Lexington, KY."
"Clear reddish amber in color, with a good white head that left some lace. The aroma is malt, reminiscent of pistachios, and spicey yeast similar to a bock, with a light floral hop fragrance. Taste is smooth toasted and nutty malt with some bitterness, this beer is clean and crisp. There is a nice balance of body and carbonation. A perfect beer for drinking all evening."
"12 ounce bottle. I expected more from this beer, the appearance was killer, but the flavor was not quite there."
"Hazy bright reddish-copper color with a nice light tan head that last, leaves great lacing in my glass. Toasted nut and brown sugar aromas, nutty caramel flavors, medium bodied with a full and creamy mouthfeel, perfect carbonation, finishes clean with some sweetness. I believe this is the best amber lager I have ever had."
"Crisp, medium body with sharp stickling carbonation. A decent beer and would be easy to drink with any good reason."
"The beer finishes with the light hops. It was crisp and clear after a slight wave of acidity. Again, like everything I’ve tasted from these guys, it was well worth a few and very well done."
"2 inch deep sand colored sticky cap after a hard pour. Beautiful deep copper-red hue. Nose is of toffee-caramel sweet graininess, slight wisps of spicy-mustiness. Nice substantial chewy malt delivery up front...silky mouth feel...malt sweetness is kept in tow with woody, rustic hop departure leaving a light toasty- toffee and fresh cut maple impression. Finish is moderate with the hops coming forward and leaving a musty sweet toasty taste. Damn fine rendition of the Vienna style....I wish this was available in Ontario, It would be my favorite Fall quaff."
"Another well crafted brew from Great Lakes. It wasn't quite what I was expecting but very good nonetheless."
"Even though I'm not an amber lager (or ale) type of guy, this one is pretty darn good (glad I have another bottle), and the fact that it's past due doesn't seem to have affected the taste (but maybe the smell). If only it was available locally..."
"12 oz. bottle dated best before 9/20/2004. Pours a clear reddish amber with big beige head. Husky grain aromas and a fair dosage of grassy hops. Big Vienna malt taste that is biscuity, bold and aggressive; astringency from the malt complements the botanical finish of the hops. Toasty as opposed to roasty in the malt. Decent carbonation keeps it burpy and drinkable. A mighty fine lager. We have a lot of Yuengling drinkers here in Western PA, and I always suggest this as a better, heartier alternative to those that are adventurous enough to try out a different ""amber lager""."
"Above average drinkability. Another solid effort from Great Lakes."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable beer for the style. Vienna Lagers can sometimes get a bit too malty or toffee sweet for me, but the hop character balances this nicely and would have be coming back for more."
"Since when should a Vienna lager reek of citrus pith and fir trees? It's dry, prickly and more of a chore to drink than I would want or expect from a ""malty"" beer. Perhaps I've been spoiled by a few too many good lagers lately, but I couldn't see this beer holding up against more balanced versions of related styles."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed 1/2"" of beige head over the reddish-brown brew. Dense head shows good staying power, with heavy foamy lacing. Aroma is lightly of sweet malts. Taste is chewy for a lager, with a malty sweetness that reminds me of a good honey pilsner. Also has a crisp, tart close-out that leaves me smacking my lips for more. Mouthfeel and drinkabilty are excellent, hard to beat in my book."
"ng"
"Drinkabilty: Pretty easy to drink, but I can't seem to want another after I finished one."
"Sampled on tap at the brewery. Poured a deep amber with a light tan bubbly head. Fantastic aroma of dense malts - caramel, toffee, & toasted bread with hints of floral hops & subtle smoke. Light bitterness in the mouth with a ton of big sweet malts overpowering deliciously fresh spicy hops. Somewhat acidic with a monstrously rich caramel flavor, this brew has a beautifully creamy & active mouthfeel. One of the best I've had in the style, which is not typically a favorite."
"Final Thought: GLBC has a great mix and diverse tasting beer lineup, and this one never disappoints from start to finish..."
"720"
"After having this one, the Dortmunder Gold, and Edmund Fitzgerald, I am considering moving to Ohio."
"Drinkability: This is a perfectly cromulent beer, but I suspect I'd grow bored with it in short order. It's *good*, but not *interesting*."
"Slick dinkability and huge flavors make this one of my favorites from GLBC."
"my first great lakes brew....thanks go out to both zap and bighuge for setting me up with this winner."
"A good looking beer, amber with golden highlights. A nice head, and good carbonation. Fairly hoppy on the nose, with a few other more earthy scents coming through as well. Nice and smoothly malted, with a hop tang at the end. Tickles the tongue a little bit as you drink it, but not in an unpleasant way at all. Very easy to drink, and delicious. Time to get more!"
"I'm feeling all of the 6.2% ABV, but it's a smooth, comfortable brew. If I had another, I'd have another."
"Drinkability is very high. Very nice amber could drink a lot of these on the patio with a cigar."
"And an extra cheers to tavernjef for procuring this first sample for me!"
"Without a doubt, an amazing beer. A fantastic example of the style, and an all-around well made brew. Great Lakes never disappoints."
"Great Lakes Eliot Ness is only the fourth Vienna lager that I have ever had... and it's easily the best. There will undoubtedly be many more in my craft beer future, but it's doubtful if any of them will surpass this one for across-the-board quality and drinkability. Simply put, this is beautiful beer."
"The beer after seceding from the bottle pours a deep translucent burnished copper color, the head cyclopean in size, the texture spumescent and the color a resplendent light tan with the lace a glutinous sheet to eclipse the glass. Nose is a slightly musky with a big malt sweet backing and the start mildly sweet with a pleasing malt presence, the top moderate in its feel to the palate. Finish is pesky in its acidity, the hops bountiful and pleasing in their spiciness, droughty aftertaste that lingers long on the palate, a great beer from a great brewery."
"Clear coppery-amber hue, it is a lovely color; the tan head reached two fingers in height on a soft pour, that is impressive. The retention of the foamy mass was very good; it took a long while before it dissipated to a cap. The subsequent lacing was organized and very widespread. The nose has that typical Lager cleanliness to it, no complains as it is appropriate for the style, behind this feature are notes of toasted caramel-grain and nuts, a faded hint of hay, there also seems to be a kiss of hops spice. The potency is small but workable, the aromas are inviting. The first sip of this beer sold me on its merits, the palate was well blended with toasty caramel malts, hints of grain, hay, and husk, the maltiness is plenty deep, at the finish is a good bite of hops. The hoppines might be a bit much for a Vienna, maybe. Still they work well in this offering and that is all that is important frankly. The finish is clean with just enough of a suggestion of the beer Ive been quaffing. The body is medium-full and quite impressive in its fullness, the carbonation is moderately low, as a whole the mouthfeel is very pleasing and more noteworthy than most beers. It is tremendously drinkable. Eliot Ness is a great beer, sometimes life can be so simple now I will sit back and savor this dandy. Thank you, PhantomVodoo!"
"Solid rust/coppery color with a slight chill haze, medium, softly topped yellowy chicken meat colored head that sits a good while before settling to a favorable skim and thin, speckled curtains of lace sticking as we go. Aroma starts a tad light on the nose with some light toasty grains and bread with just a bit of sweetened fruitiness. As it warms a nice smokey-like dryness of multi whole grains, roasty hazelnuts, and hard caramel appear in the nose making it much nicer and even a bit stronger. Taste is mild but eagerly built with some f*ckin' great malts! One of the best profiles of bready/grains ever encountered, wow! Has an easy start that remains in some mixed maltyness of slight sweetness and light toastyness, but that gains with a gradual presence of uniquely thick seven grain pancake-like, toasty wild rice roundness. Spectacular malts! Perfectly milding light grassy spice and hops poke through. Add in the teriffic finish of smokened grains and malts slightly drying and lifting into the finish with mixed roasty nuttyness. Very intriguing flavors indeed, well put together with a delicately rich and smooth body that keeps convalescing. A true showmanship of the meaning behind hand crafted. Wow, what a recipe, great stuff! Try it and see, you'll be impressed no doubt! Absolutely drinkable to the fullest! My new Vienna/Marzen to keep around at all costs! Yum times ten!"
"A Sean Connery Untouchable Thanks to BigHuge for this one!"
"Mouthfeel is relatively thick for the style, while the drinkability on this beer is excellent, very smooth. I'd label this beer a perfect candidate for 'bridging the gap' between macro and micro drinking, it's not as overwhelming as many micros, yet has more than enough character to keep your palate interested."
"It poured a nice reddish orange topped with a beige-orange head that was fluffy and thick, it seemed to last. I've had this beer on tap as well as in the bottle, but I'm reviewing bottle. Anyway, starts with a definite hoppy taste. The hop is somewhat earthy but mostly floral. It finishes with a nutty malt. I just love the nuttiness afterwards."
"Drinkability: So far, I've really enjoyed everything from Great Lakes Brewing, and this is no exception. This is a very easy beer to drink, not too much going on to overwhelm my still-in-training beer sensors, but good enough that I'll be picking up a few more on my next trip to D's."
"Pours clear deep amber, with a small tan head that slightly lasts, and leaves a very small bit of lacing. Aroma strong on sweet caramel, lightly nutty, and some toasted grains. Flavor starts with caramel spread on some toasted whole grain bread, ends with a slightly spicy hop finish. Medium body, very drinkable."
"Aaah, the taste, features an early roasted malty caromel with a gentle bitter hop back to finish. Great balance."
"Poured a rich, deep, dark amber that built to a decent pillowy off-white head. Good lacing. Aroma of malts greet you immediately with fruitiness through the middle and mild hopping in background. Taste is also heavily malted and a bit of a raisin presence. Nice and mellow feel with a slighty hoppy and wet finish."
"I have never had a bad brew from this legendary brewpub. Clear freshness dating appreciated. Too bad its not available in Canada. This is a very good German style beer. Goes well with food, perfect for appetizers. Well balanced. Two to three people to finish a six-pack."
"A very easy drinking brew, you could easily consume a lot, but it does nothing to set itself apart from the field."
"On draught at Winking Lizard. Lovely amber color with a medium thick off-white head. Thin lacing Nice aroma of malt, caramel and nuts. Medium-bodied and smooth with a blend of roasted nuts, caramel, cinnamon and malt working well together. The finish is mostly sweet malt with a lingering hops bite. Great beer."
"Malt drives this one start to finish. Some breadiness, a hint of fruit, and just enough hops to keep it from becoming cloying. Medium bodied, moderate carbonation."
"12 oz bottle at MikeyW's house. Deep, shiny copper color. Glowing. Off-white sticky head. Bubbly. Laced the glass to the bottom. Full toasted carmel malt smell. Perfectly rich taste of toasted malt, very full malt taste. Lots of sweetness, and snap, sticky, quick hop kick. Very balanced, and full flavored. Solid medium bodied, but super easy to drink. Dru finish, but toasted flavors linger on the tongue. I thought this was vienna lager, not a marzen, but there probably isn't really a difference. Whatever category you place it, it was a very impressive beer and worth any efforts to try it. I waited a long time to try it, and it exceded my expectations. A ""wow"" beer."
"Nice rusty-red color with a nice mediun bodied head. Good balance of malt and hop with a slight floral tinge to it. Smooth and eminently drinkable, with a little caramel edge to it at the back end. I'd love to have a keg of this stuff at a party.."
"This marzen-style lager poured a nice copper colour with an off-white head. The aromas were of malts and hops in a nice perfect harmony. The taste is malty of course, a bit fruity, fresh, floral and hoppy. The mouthfeel is a bit light on the tonuge, but heavy enough to slightly coat the throat on the way down. The drinkability is pretty excellent as well. Another good brew from the folks at GLBC!"
"Deep Amber red color with an off white head. Head retention is good, traces of Belgian lace down the side of the glass. A nice balance of noble hop and caramelized malt give this beer a good taste. Very drinkable beer considering the alcohol content."
"Did not even realize this was an Okto beer, thought it was more of a brown ale (but that's a compliment). A nice creamy head, alost stoutlike. Had a good beery smell with a touch of fruitiness that led me to think this was an ale. A complex hop taste that I thought had more American hops that the normal German ones. A delightful brew that stands out at any autumn party,"
"What a great session beer for the chilly fall months. Nicely warming and comforting. I will be getting more of these for the fall/winter."
"Review date 8/29/03. Drink by date on bottle is 7/18/03. Deep amber in color Poured with a thick tan head that lasted for quite a while. Nice lace. Smell is predominately sweet malt with just a hint of hop presence. Taste is quite good. Malt sweetness with a nicely balanced hop finish. Perhaps a bit more the malt side, but still very nice. The hoppiness has a nice finish that is to say it doesn't hang around long, which is what I like. Mouthfeel is Better than average. The malt and hop flavors are very distinctive and seperate, it would be nicer if they were mixed together a bit more so that they compliment and help balance each other better. this is a very drinkable brew, not one to get drunk on, but one to kick back and enjoy several of."
"The flavor has a pronounced graininess, with some caramel and toasted malts rising to the fore. It is crisp for a marzen with a decent hop spice. Medium body that finishes a tad dry."
"Dark Amber color, medium head. Aroma is malty and slighlty sweet. A full-bodied Vienna Lager. Big malty flavors, caramel and slightly nutty. Nice hop bite. Well balanced. Great tasting beer. Smooth taste. Finish is clean and slightly dry. Aftertaste is slightly sweet."
"An odd note is that this was given to me by a Canadian innkeeper who has guests bring this up from Cleveland."
"Just one of the fantastic beers out of Great Lakes. As much as it pains me to say it, coming from the Pittsburgh area, something from Cleveland isn't really all that bad at all!"
"Wow, what a gem, if you're a Marzen / Oktoberfest fan. Pours a clear deep reddish amber with a thick luscious creamy light tan head. Sweet malt aroma seems almost bock-like, but consists of caramel and raisin. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with just a touch of carbonation. Taste has a real nice sweet rich chewy malt flavor that also consists of dark fruit (raisins) and caramel (this seemed evident from the nose). Hallertau hops provide a mildly dry bitter middle. They provide a good balance to the sweet malt finish. Being a big fan of Oktoberfest beers, this was a real treat."
"A 'thank you' goes out to 'Realale' for the bottle."
"This was some amazing stuff! Never before had I had a vienna like this and I'd be hard-pressed to find another vienna that was this high quality. It definitely had a sweet caramel malt that dominated the flavor but was not overbearing. Soothing tea-like hops came in to balance and add to complexity. More flavors ensued but I could not pick up on what exactly they were, they were good though. The beer's finish tasted exactly like the bread I buy from my local bakery. Light honey nut wheat bread that is superb! This one's a classic."
"Pours a beautiful tawny color, and sports a creamy, light golden head-I bet this would make a great color for a lense on a pair of sunglasses! Take a look through the glass towards your favorite light source. The nose is almost that of something sweet baking away in the oven, loads of baking spice here, as well as some caramelized vanilla sugar in the background. Now that I've been smelling this beer, sipping, and enjoying its color there does not appear to be enough to give a proper flavor analysis. I'll open another. Ahhhh! There you go, rich and malty, bordering on syrupy until a spattering of hops clean things up. Alternate malt, hop, vanilla sugar, spice, gulp-repeat as desired. Taste-T stuff!!"
"Very well-balanced in the mouth with the malt, hop and carbonation all forming a lovely coherent whole. Touch too much caramel flavor in this one, but the sweetness of the malt is well-balanced. Great bottle-conditioned mouthfeel and medium weight. Finishes with a hint of calcium/sulphur."
"A nice red copper brew sits in my glass with a slightly yellowish head that is thick initially but quickly dies down to about 1/4"". Sweet malts come to the nose, with the hops, spices, and hints of fruitiness coming through. Tastes kinda like a sourish sweet malt flavor, with an apple like fruit presence. This beer has an odd complexity that I can't quite put my finger on, seems to be more like an amber ale at first but then finishes with the lager. A different brew."
"This brew pours a glowing amber color with a creamy, off-white head. Nose is mostly sweet and fruity, although some earthy-spicy hops peek their collective heads out to let you know they're present, too. Caramel malt is the featured flavor here, although some red apple fruitiness and spicy hops linger behind. Mouthfeel is somewhat carbonated, but quite smooth overall. This is a very drinkable beer, and one that I find pairs particularly well with Mexican cuisine. If you're a fan of Vienna-style lagers, this one is about as good an American sample as I've come across."
"This is very similar to Bell's Amber Ale with more earth, plus a more intense hop finish. One of the best Amber Lagers out there (Vienna-style or not). Another excellent brew from Great Lakes. They can do no wrong."
"As I have tried all of GLBC's brews to date, I must say this is my least favorite. Having said that, it is STILL a great beer - it's just a little different that what I really like. However, if you like a malty, semi-sweet finishing brew that is slightly heavier than a typical lager and has alot more taste, this one should appeal to you. Personally, I feel it has a lot of carbonation, and it kind of takes away from the overall impression. Not my style, but I can appreciate it for what it is."
"The Eliot Ness pours a clear red amber color with a very thick, fluffy, off-white head. The smell is fairly mild, some malt is present as is an almost bourbon or whiskey type aroma. The taste is somewhat spicy. The primary flavors seem to be those of malt with a bit of hops. The finish leaves an oaky taste and a hint of the bourbon that came through in the smell. A relatively smooth, medium bodied beer. The drinkability has improved since the first time I had it, although it noticeably drops as the beer warms up. I've given this beer several tries at different times, thinking that I should like it more, but never seem to."
"This beer pours an amber color with tons of carbonation on the sides of the glass and a small head that oddly centers itself in the center. The aroma is not very strong but I can sense home hints of fruit and light malts. The taste is amazingly smooth and enjoyable. It's a little sweet and the carbonation makes it more interesting. The aftertaste is sweet, but reminescent of something earthy - can't pinpoint it. Very good beer. I could drink this one all night long."
"Originally sampled on 10 November 2002. This pours a beautiful amber color w/ a 2"" (5cm) head. Crystal clear w/ a big malt nose & well balanced flavors. In my humble opinion, this is a very good example of what an Oktoberfest beer should taste like."
"This beer poured out a clear and deep copper/iced tea color and had a foamy off white and creamy head. This one is deliciously bitter and malty at the same time. Nice pairing of the malts and hops. The alcohol is well hidden here. Theres some caramel sweetness to it, also. An excellent amber lager with a weighty body to it. Highly drinkable and very enjoyable."
"this is just about my favorite beer, definately my favorite lager. it was a very deep red color and had a warm roasted smell. tastes very smooth. warms the mouth with a slightly nutty taste. would never guess the alcohol content from the taste, it is definately hidden well. it was just so good i think i'm gonna have to have another"
"Clear, deep red amber color with a thin head and minimal lace. Aroma was sweet and smelled somewhat of bready yeast. The taste started out with a sweet, well pronounced carmel flavor, and some bread flavors coming out as well. Mildly hoppy with floral hops, but not enough bitterness to balance out the malt sweetness. Overall a tasty beer, but a little off balance."
"I had this brew in a 12oz. bottle poured into a spaten oktoberfest glass. The color is a deep red with a large off-white head, which really sticks around, leaving good lacing. The smell is almost a sweet caramel aroma. The taste is a bit sweet and malty. Could use a little bit more hops. The mouthfeel is a little oily. This is a very drinkable lager that is very refreshing."
"I'm glad I decided to grab a sixxer of this instead of a single. This fine beer pours a deep copper red with a thick tan head that quickly recedes to a thin film. The aroma is sweet and malty just like the taste begins. efore the sweetness gets a hold the hops kick in (just a touch too much for me) and balance it out very well."
"Pours a clear amber with a fairly persistent cream colored head. Does manage to leave behind some lace, and a thin layer of foam sits atop the beer. Aroma is malty, with caramel, toasted malt, and a touch of herbal hops. Flavor is sweet and fruity, some hints of bread mixed in with caramel. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, with moderate carbonation, and it has a medium body. I would personally like a touch more bitterness in the finish, but this is a very solid Marzen style beer."
"A very complex brew, but another good one from GLBC. It pours a very nice cranberry like amber with an off white head just under an inch. Lace is good and plenty through-out the drink. The aroma is floral and of toasted grain. Taste is smooth but with a bite. A malty caramal with a spicy hop flavor. The mouth is left with a hop aftertaste. Like I said, its complex. Alot going on with thisone but in good GL quality manor. I only had one sitting with this, i'd like to try it again now that I know what to expect."
"Yet another superb offering from GLBC. Rich reddish hued brown color and off-white/biege head. Very aromatic--malty and earthy herbals scents hit the nose. Flavor is a touch bitter but rich and mellow in malts. I detect a touch a light 'nut' taste as well. The body sits heavy on the tongue and carbonation is nearly non-existent. It finishes with a silky feeling down the throat and a dry feeling in the mouth. Extremely drinkable and the best Vienna I have yet had."
"This beer pours a slightly hazy medium dark golden red with a large dark tan head. The mouthfeel is very firm. The smell is cookie-like and very slightly herbal. The taste is roasted malt with a very soft pleasing hoppy finish. This is a very smooth drinkable vienna style lager."
"I tried this recently on tap and it seemed consistent with the bottled version, although the head lingered longer. Combined with a roast beef on Kaiser, the combo topped off a Friday evening in great form. Does life get any better?"
"(source: PremierGourmet; Buffalo, NY)"
"Good malty-spicy beer,smelled like bread rising,went great with pizza nice high alcohol content went well with the spiciness of the pizza.I honestly havent had a bad beer from Great Lakes yet.Best brewery in the midwest,with Kalamazoo(my beloved Bells)not far behind."
"Another great beer from what I feel is one of the finest breweries around. Pours a beautiful copper red. Great head that sticks sparingly throughout. Tase is total sweet malt with a hint of caramel. A slight hop taste hits you in the finish. Mega-smooth. Highly recommended!"
"A slightly hazy, beautiful reddish-orange body is topped by a frothy one-fingered light tan head that holds really well. The aroma offers softly sweet toasted malt with a light touch of background hops. Very clean. The body is medium/full with a fine, median carbonation that's lightly crisp and then creamy in the mouth. The rich, full flavor of lightly sweet toasted malts is balanced by a solid bitterness which dries out the long lingering malty finish. It's not complex, but quite full. This version really presses the limits of the style, but in a good way!"
"Clear dark copper color, head of 1/4 inch and light in color. A lot of caramel and a little toffee to the aroma. Nicely aromatic brew. Boldly malty for a Vienna, hops are barely evident. Very smooth with a full mouthfeel with tastes that follw the smells closely. I liked the flavor a lot but would probably pinch a few more hop flowers into the brew kettle, myself. Leans more toward a Bock in some aspects, rather than the toasty characters of most Vienna Lagers -- so I thinks its a little off the typical aspects of style. Still, another nice one from a standout brewery..."
"Pours a nice light brown, reddish hue, with a off white head. Nice malty aroma. Tastes great, the first Vienna style lager I have ever tried. smooth maltiness, with a little bit of hops thrown in to balance things out. Great Lakes simply makes great beers, I can't say I have ever tried one I didn't like."
"Pours deep red with a real beefy head. Nice blend of hops and malt providing both an enjoyable smell and even better taste. Enjoyable all the way round."
"Nothing wrong with this one highly recommended for this style!!"
"This is my first sample of any Great Lakes brew and I must say I'm quite impressed. It pours a deep reddish brown in the glass with a tan head that maintains a slight cap. The smell is mostly the signature light-medium toasted malt so evident in any good Vienna lager, with some grain lingering in the background. The taste is malt dominated with a praline-like sweetness but there's ample hops to provide a crisp, slightly herbal bitter finish. Personally, I'm partial to hoppy brews, but I know quality when I taste it. Thank You Great Lakes for an outstanding brew. I look forward to rest of my GL sampler pack."
"Re-review with side by side comparison with Sam Adams Vienna Style: more red in appearance than Sam Adams. The most noticeable difference from the Sam Adams is the extra spicy hops kick in the Eliot Ness. Sam Adams seems a little flat in comparison."
"This is a good beer for those who like a lot of malt flavor.  As I believe to be true with Vienna-style lagers, this beer is predominantly malt aroma and flavor, with enough hops to clean up the finish.  At warmer temperatures, this beer exhibits a wonderful sweetness.  But it's difficult to let it sit long enough to warm.  Not much of a head to speak of, but that is just a minor detraction from the initial impresion of this beer.  A good beer, but possibly the third or fourth best from Great lakes.  Try it if you see it, it won't disappoint."
"dated 21NOV02. Deep copper with crimson core. Powdery, fluffy, sand-colored head. Deep aromas of baked apples, tree bark, and subtle, sweet spices. Rich, creamy mouth with flavors of toffee, roasted nuts, cocoa, honey, and hoppy bitters, the latter making it all clean and dry. Yum."
"Incredibly built."
"Well, this concludes my mini-tour of Great Lakes thanks to the great effort put out by my sister in nabbing some of this stuff on her trip recently.  I've got to say, after sampling 4 styles from them, they are very impressive."
"When they list Vienna Style in the dictionary, there better be a picture of this next to it. I can't imagine anyone makes a better Vienna. I thought Schell's Firebrick was a fine example of the style(and it is), but that is triple ""a" ball..this is major league material...all-star major league material. Brick brown in colorwith a very soft but small lace....nice aroma of toasted malt...Excellent mouthfeel...malty, with caramel and toffee notes...but also some nutty characteristics...it is accentuated by a small, but tantalizing spicy/herbal hop finish....finishes sweet, but not oversweet...a lot of character in this brew...I love Vienna's and Octoberfests and this is one of the best I've had....I WANT MORE!!"
"Nice amber color and slight aroma to it.  Light head that doesn't hold very well. Nice taste to it, lighter and slightly tangy.  Prefer this to Bell's"
"The Great Lakes Brewing Co. is on equal par with Bell's for me. We are blessed in the midwest to have these two breweries. The Elliot Ness is a very, full flavored lager and is smooth as silk."
"Notes: Indeed a awesome brew ... high quality and oh so flavourful, very hard to find anything wrong with this beer. A definite BeerAdvocate pick!"
"Although it is a lager, the body was more ale-like.  Sweet/tangy front with a mild, delayed hops finish.  If I had not seen the bottle, I might have thought it a Scottish ale."
