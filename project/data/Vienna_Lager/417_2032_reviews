"Overall: OMG, I could easily make this my go-to session lager if only it were readily available on the East Coast."
""
""
""
"Overall - Gross? I won't be trying this again. I'm sure this beer is great for its style (300 beer reviewers can't be wrong?), however it is definitely not one I'll be coming back for. A class ""A" nominee for drain pour."
""
""
""
"Overall: Well done, August Schell."

"Overall: Schell’s did a good job with this malt extravaganza. If you’re looking for something else from the hop-forward IPA’s that characterize craft beer, this is a good change of pace. FireBrick is a nice, very approachable beer to introduce to your non-BA friends."

"Poured on tap at a rochester honkers game. Pours reddish amber with a small white head. Smells of some dark roasted malt but not much else. Tastes of some dark roasted malt with a slight berry aftertaste. Beer is light bodied nice carbonation very crisp. Overall, an above average beer."
""
""
""
"FireBrick pours a dark reddish color with a decent sized head. The aroma is non-existent. The taste has a harsh malt backbone and finishes with a very grainy taste. Nice body, unusual flavors. Overall its a bit harsh, and has some adjunct like flavors."

"Pretty good lager here, as Schell's is known for. I hadn't had any of their beers in a while, and this makes me want to try more."

"Overall: Good solid light bodied malty style lager, though may not be right for those who do not enjoy the malty sweetness."

"Its a lovely amber with a solid sheet of toasted cream on top. Smells sweet with some nougat, some pale malt, some biscuit and a bit of tea. Flavor is malts, sweet, some banana, some more tea (sweet tea in the south), some bits of orange peel. Medium on full bodied with fine, creamy carbonation and a wet finish. Decent beer, nothing I'd be likely to slam repeatedly."

"This is really, really nice. There is just a touch of hops to make you happy, but the malt is so fantastic and well balanced throughout. It's just miles and miles of smooth malt. It's just a nice, silky mouthfeel, too!"

"Thanks to fLax for this one!"
"O: Good drinkability. If you like malty lagers, this is for you. Better than Sam Adams Boston Lager. Another great lager from Schells."
""
""
""

"Didn't enjoy it the first time I tried it, this time though, it was very enjoyable."
""

"Final Thoughts: The best thing about this beer was the lovely coloring it had in the glass. However, if you are looking for a more flavorful alternative to a macro lager for drinking on your porch as the sun sets, this beer would do the trick. It's nothing complex, but that makes for an easy drinking experience. Also a good transition beer for someone interested in craft beer but afraid of some of the darker or hoppier beers out there."

"Bottle poured into pint glass. Clear golden appearance with white head, nice retention, minimal lace. The nose features some hop character up front and a touch of skunky character. Notes of bread and grain come through. Not sure if this has been skunked or if it is intentional. The taste is full flavored and is very malty. None of the skunk quality comes through on the taste. Decent balance, minimal hop character. The mouthfeel is light and refreshing with appropriate level of carbonation. Overall, this is a nice Vienna lager. I'm assuming the skunk character is unitentioal and is a result of the storage at the place I purchased the bottle. For that reason,, I am not factoring that into the smell score. It wasn't much of a detractor in the first place."
""
""
""
"Easy drinking. medium mouth-feel, and medium carbonation. Yum!"
"Assessment - This beer was once a snowstorm winter beer that august schell decided to make available all year round. I personally wouldn't sit and savor the beer, but could definitely throw a couple down in a short amount of time."
""
""
""
""
""
"Very similar to SA Boston Lager. I get it if you're drinking this, you're not looking for massivity and complexity, and this beer delivers in that regard. There are no off flavors, its just a middle of the road beer with mild smooth malt additions, minimal hops and mild yeast."
""
"Drinkable and pleasant."
"Appearance: This was a 22-oz pour. Was coppery brown, clear, with an inch of light foam that receded leaving no lacing. Smell is lightly toasted malt and a light sweetness. Taste is very malty, caramel, biscuit, slightly sweet, nutty, enough balance to keep the finish relatively clean. Too low carbonation, maybe a function of the tap.. 22 oz was too much, its better from a bottle."

"Medium bodied with modest carbonation and a light sweet aftertaste. I could easily drink this beer all the time, and do have it pretty often. I was surprised to find out I had not reviewed this beer in a bottle yet. I thought this was as good a time as any to do so."
""

"Serving type: bottle"

"O: nice beer. Simple, well rounded and flavorful. Easily could have a few of these."
"Overall - I enjoyed it, it's one of those beers you could either sit down and drink or chug down after working outside on a hot summer day."
"On the low end of medium bodied with fairly light carbonation, the mouthfeel is decent and it's easy to drink. Not a bad little brew."
"Overall - It's not a bad beer but not really my style."
"Overall: A very drinkable beer that is decent overall and could pair well with a variety of foods."
"O- I like it. One of August Schell's better efforts. Splendidly drinkable and plenty of flavor. Roughly on par in the style with Boston Lager."
"Slightly cloying on the aftertaste knocks the mouthfeel down a peg. Overall, a good beer worthy of the style."
"12 oz bottle: Aroma is sweet grainy malt, hay, toasted, very light malt backing poking through with a grassy note but way in the background. Appearance is a clear amber with a thick off white head that diminishes after a few minutes. Taste is nicely malty, slightly metallic, and a lot mellower than the aroma. Aftertaste has the more of the roasted, toasted an caramel note of the malts. OVerall, Decent to Average. Cheers!"
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, it’s a decent beer but there are others in the style that I would pick first."
"Easily sessionable."
"Overall: A very solid lager from Schell's. Easy drinking and flavorful."
"Overall, a beer that is simple and easy drinking, yet flavorful. Would be nice to see a few more versions of this style done this well."
"Poured down the center of the glass that resulted in a big head. Head was offwhite in color. No lacing going on. Beer itself was cola colored. Light smelling. Just a slight sweet smell,light malt, and biscuits. Tasted light also. Had a slightly bitter aftertaste. Also notes of caramel and hops. I thought the carbonation was good. Felt good in the mouth. I enjoyed this beer. I think it would be a good session beer."
"Not something to search for, but not to be turned away either."
"O - Firebrick is an excellent lager. Great malt flavor, pleasant hoppy finish, and very refreshing. Certainly worth a try."
"Overall- A very tasty brew. If I were to pick apart anything, I wish it had a stronger smell and a little more flavor on the finish. But that really is nitpicking a very tasty lager. By all means try it!"
"Overall: Another winner from the Schell Brewing Company. I think this one would be a great winter beer."
"Overall better then I thought it would be. This was actually fairly decent and i would not turn it down if offered."
"Cleanest purest Vienna lager your going to get. Gold standard."
"D: Overall an interesting beer. Very malty at times, a bit hoppy at times. Rich and malty at times, but a tad watery at others. Overall, a decent representation of the style. Not quite on par with Sam Adams, but very close."
"Schell's Firebrick was orange-amber in color with good clarity. It had an off-white head with good retention and lacing. The smell was toasty malt with some floral hops. The taste was toasted malt upfront with some earthy and spicy hops and enough bitterness to balance. The finish was dry with some residual spicy hop and malt flavors. The mouthfeel was good with a medium body and medium carbonation. The drinkability was good as well. This is a tasty and refreshing lager that would pair well with grilled or smoked meat."
"D: I always like a lager that steps out with strong flavor profiles. I love this. Could easily session."
"My pour resulted in just better than a finger of foamy eggshell-white head with decent retention. Color was a coppery-amber with NE-quality clarity. Nose had a rich caramel sweetness to it. Mouthfeel was medium with a very malty sweetness initially, but giving 'way to a slight grassy hoppiness on the tongue. Finish was incredibly smooth, very pleasant to drink, with an intermingling of the malt and hops that made me wish for more. I would certainly put this beer in my imaginary cooler that has become my basis for a ""drinkability"" score."
"Good beer for a good price. One could easily drink several of these. I'll be buying this more often."
"Drinkability: Nice balance of flavors and not a too complex mouthfeel combined with a light ABV can make for a nice drinkability."
"This Vienna Lager from Schell's is a good one. It pours a dark copper color and has a slight scent of malts. As you drink the carbonation tickles your mouth but it finishes nice and smooth to the point that you don't even notice you were just drinking a beer. A nice find for a colder night."
"Unusually dry feel, which adheres itself to the palate in an offensive fashion. The flavor profile isn't terrible, but the feel wraps itself around the tongue and refuses to leave."
"Roasty, caramel and toffee maltiness are the main show here and are pretty powerful for a lager of 5%. Light hopping combines with a bit of toast to give more than enough bittering power on the back end. Mouthfeel is decent and the carbonation is perfect. Little bit of cooked veggies and light astringency are the only complaints I have here. I would be happy to take a sixer of this to a tailgate or cookout. Good brew."
"pours a very nice copper color with a staying 1/2 finger head also some nice lacing..smell is malt and bread with citrus and hop ,,taste is malt forward with a sweetbread taste then some hops and a slight roasted caramel hit in the background..mouth feel is smooth and creamy with some good flavors ....its medium and good...its drinkable not over the top just refreshing and well made... schells is a solid brewery that makes some great brews"
"It's been a long time coming and I finally had this one. Firebrick is an excellent all around beer that I really should drink more of. This would make a nice session beer and I have some friends that would really enjoy the hell out of this as well. I will be getting more of this from now on."
"Not bad. Average beer."
"The mouthfeel was not too thin. A couple of these are fine and then I would switch to something. This beer from August Schell is decent. When it comes to Vienna Lagers I do prefer Great Lakes Eliot Ness though."
"Drinkability: A good session beer here. Nothing extraordinary but still quite satisfying."
"Pours a copper color with a thin head that disappates quickly with no lacing. The aroma is of caramel malts and maybe a hint of hoppiness, the aroma is kinda faint and hard to get to. The taste is of caramel malt backbone and a little toastiness, along with a slight hop bite. The mouthfeel is very carbonated and fizzy. Overall the drinkability is okay, you could have a couple, but there are better beers in this style out there. A little faint in the aroma and taste department."
"D: Somewhat above average. This isn't an uber heavy drink that will leave you with a gutache if you approach it as a beer to drink for flavor. Would be refreshing as a hot weather beer. If you tried to down six of these, you would have a gutache, but then you wouldn't be reading BA either."
"Pours a clear, copper color. 1/5 inch head of a white color. Slight retention and poor lacing. Smells of sweet malt, yeast, slight hop, and grain. Fits the style of a Vienna Lager. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, yeast, slight hop, and slight grain. Overall, an average blend, weak aroma, and slightly weak body."
"Overall, I'm very pleased with this offering from Schell BC. Had plenty of their stuff before, but never really took time to review any of it. I'll definitely be looking to do so in the future."
"This is a caramelly lager - a bit too sweet, but a decent lager if you're in a caramelly sweet mood."
"Very drinkable. A great beer overall; goes down quite easily."
"As Vienna lagers go, Firebrick ranked right up there with the best of them."
"d - A decent everyday lager. While it is no where near the best, it is pretty good and I could see this being a beer you could drink several of or in a session. Solid beer."
"D-This is a good beer and it would please many palates."
"Poured from the bottle into a Pilsner glass, Firebrick is a clear, rusty amber brown color with a thin, carbonated off-white head. The nose is all but absent; I may have served this a little too cold. The taste is all malt; sweet caramel, toasty bread and a touch of molasses. There is a slight metalic tinge too. The mouthfeel is on the lighter side with the carbonation also leaning that way. Overall, not impressed. Not a bad beer but very generic and un-memorable."
"D - Another good local from Schell. A really good tasting brew that I can easily have more than a couple. I highly recommend this local brew if you haven't tried yet!!"
"Mouthfeel is just right. Nice and creamy, leaves an interesting, though not unpleasant, residue feeling on the palate."
"D - A fantastic Vienna lager I wish I had a six-pack of. Very delicious and smooth. An easy drinking beer that begs to be both actively inspected and passively enjoyed!"
"#5 of 6 from the variety pack. No losers here, they just keep getting better and better. I recommend this one as a representative for the brewery and the style."
"D= Another very drinkable, highly sessionable beer from Schell Brewery."
"Very drinkable beer, I could finish many of these in a session."
"Drinkability: Refreshing beer that actually works for all seasons. Fantastic Vienna overall, and this is what I compare all other Viennas to. SA Boston Lager is great as well, but not a true Vienna."
"Over all, an easy to drink beer. Not as light as most lagers, I like the litte bitterness it has. Sting in the tail boys."
"Pours a nice light red-tinged copper color with a bit of initial head, that goes away quickly, and no lacing. Nice scent, a light malty sweetness, although not strong at all. Good taste, good malt attributes with a nice noble hop finish in it. A good beer, nice and refreshing with some decent tones, but nothing fantastic."
"Firebrick appears red with a thick white head and vigorous carbonation. One of the prettiest lagers I have seen. The aromas are slightly fruity, followed by a crisp hop character. The flavors are similar to the smell, but more intense. Fruity at first, with mild notes of caramel and toast. It finishes crisp and dry, with a nice bitter hop bite. This beer is light to medium bodied, and has a very clean mouthfeel. It's very drinkable, and may be my personal favorite brew Schell's has to offer."
"D: A good not great beer that is refreshing and solid in craftsmanship."
"well my 4th out of the schell sample 6er and they are 2-4"
"Wouldn't pass one up if offered but wouldn't seek it out again as it is pretty tame."
"D-I've got a history with this one (as with many/all of the other Schell's brews), which may influence my preference. Regardless, this brew is very drinkable. A lighter-feeling brew with an adequately-complex flavor and aroma profile."
"D: This is a nice unassuming beer. The low ABV makes it an easy drinker. I'm glad I picked it up."
"At first, I found myself wanting more flavor, a la Boston Lager, but the mouthfeel and resulting drinkability really brought things back up for me in the end."
"This came out of a sampler six pack and I've found this brewery to be top-notch so far. No frills just kick ass brews."
"Notes: If you like toasted malt flavors, this is the beer for you. What it lacks in hops, it makes up for with malty goodness. A nice year-round beer, but probably better in fall and winter. Very nice."
"D: A decent drinker."
"A decent, but not spectacular vienna lager, though eminently sessionable. The flavours don't blow you away, but its the sort of beer I could easily drink at the end of a hard day, or while I'm watching the game."
"I liked this one more and more as I drank it and really began wishing I had more than one. Easily sessionable and worth a try."
"Drinkability is fairly high. It's certainly sessionable, and the flavor profile is decent. It's a bit boring overall though."
"My first Schell's offering, and let me just say I am looking forward to the other five beers of theirs I have to try. If I had this available to me I have a feeling it would be one of my main session beers."
"D -- Drinkability is, as marked, exceptional. A very nice quaffer."
"This beer is incredibly drinkeable, at 5% I could have several. Great sessioner without pallette destruction."
"D: Easy, a good more flavored beer for a warm day. A great transition beer for the BMC drinker."
"D: Its drinkable but needs to tone down the body some. If it was local, would love to give it a go on tap, I strongly think it would do it better justice."
"D: Can definitely drink plenty of this. This is one of the better examples of this style. Not the best in my opinion but far better then the many who miss the mark on this one."
"Thanks to jjanega08 for the extra!"
"D: Nice beer to make a night out of. Low ABV makes it possible, without sacrificing any flavor."
"Overall a drinkable Vienna lager. Worth a try. I would prefer a more robust and complex flavor."
"D= not too great. I wanted to like it. maybe I just had a bad sixer???? not too great"
"I think I might have had my expectations too high for this beer as I'm a fan of other Vienna lagers like Bohemia and Sam Adams Boston Lager."
"Finally: I do like this one and it is quite drinkable that might be its strongest point even. This may become an IN STOCK item at my house. Not very unique but Very Good!"
"Fairly drinkable. Not the best beer in the world, but another quality offering from Schell's."
"Overall this beer is easy to drink and could be a wonderful session beer. It is a great beer, however the taste becomes more and more of a typical lager after a while, and I am more of a fan of ales."
"Worth having a few ith avalible."
"Would love to get a can of Firebrick for my collection (only ever saw bottles)."
"HV"
"Shell's....you have made better but I won't hold this against you. Keep up the great work. Fantaistic that Minnesota has the 2nd oldest family brewery in the USA."
"The taste is similar to the aroma,with grain, whole wheat, old dry leaves, and a hint of baked apples. However, it's all muted and muddled, has with an oddly light body, weak flavours that degrade, and a light grain aftertaste. It has only a little sweetness and bitterness, tending toward the former. It's ok, but not at all interesting."
"D-Very good, refreshing, and sessionnable."
"D - Very drinkable, solidly malty brew."
"Frankly, I'll take this as a session beer at a non-craft beer bar any day. And I'll confess that I had another, in a different bar, later, by choice. Good beer."
"D - This is a very good Vienna Lager. A nice standard in the August Shell lineup."
"D- I would probably grab a Sam Adams Boston Lager before this, but this is a solid Vienna."
"so traditional in a sea of flavors, but very well done - a good brew."
"Tasted on 4/2/08."
"Very sessionable but just a tad boring."
"Drinkability: An easy enough drinking beer. Low ABV, and inoffensiveness makes this a potential session lager. A tad low in flavors IMO, I might get bored when sessioning. However, I may search out a full six pack some time."
"M/D - Above average carbonation gives a crisp feel. Medium bodied and very drinkable."
"D: It is a wonderful session beer, meant for drinking during a summer visit to a beer garden or a long night of playing pool at your favorite pub. Balanced flavors, light body and light ABV."
"I decided to get the sampler pack and decided to try the beer I figured to like the least first. Not a bad beer, I'm just not into it. Decent mildly sweet taste but nothing that really stands out."
"Overall a great brew from New Ulm!"
"Overall a drinkable beer."
"Good mouthfeel on this one as it isn't thick but it has a good level of carbonation to it. This is an extremely clean drinkable beer and I could easily sit down with a sixer of this on a nice weekend day."
"Looked good - an oaken amber with a frothy ivory head. Aroma was a weak bread in a pilsner glass. Not enough dough in the quaff, and not enough malt for balance. But, it does drink well and is one I could drink a few of - but the price (over a buck a bottle) may push me to other brews."
"Creamy but somewhat thick mouthfeel. Nice carbonation and a solid medium body. Not a bad session beer and for the price definitely worth keeping a 6-pack around."
"Drinkability: A middle-of-the-road vienna."
"This is my favorite Schell beer. It's one of the easiest to drink; it's excellent in the summer heat, or the winter cold. We have plenty of both here in MN."
"Poured a beautiful amber color with approximately one finger of head that dissipated pretty quickly. Aroma is a light roasted scent. Taste is also malty and good. Mouthfeel is very soft. Very crisp and smooth. Easy drinking. Nice beer. I would definitely have again."
"The saving grace of this beer is that it's served on Northwest Airlines domestic flights, and it got me over my worst turbulence nerves going out and coming home. At $5 a can I was hoping it would deliver and at 5% alcohol it does the trick."
"an interesting beer, but not really my style. it is very drinkable, though, and im glad that i took the opportunity to try it out."
"my second beer by schell's, and while it is an improvement on the first--the caramel bock--it too is a bit of a cipher: looks good (amber-red in a pint glass, with a very quickly dissipating head), has a better aroma than the bock, but on the palate it is a bit of a nothing. nothing complex about the flavours or the finish. nice mouthfeel and quite drinkable but completely middle of the road. i don't know much about vienna style lagers, which this purports to be, so can't say if it is a good example of the style. i would drink it again, but i would not buy it to stock at home."
"This beer is thick and syrupy with a little carbonation. It's refreshing and very easy to sip. Good stuff!"
"This is a really nice beer, probably hoppier and maltier than others I've had in this style. It's not a huge tongue-blasting flavor, but it's bolder than expected and can definitely hang with the best in the style. Easily the best of the 5 Schells that mnwags hooked me up with on a recent visit. Unknowingly I saved the best for last. Thanks Nick!"
"D: Very refreshing."
"Drinkability- Not bad. I would get it again."
"The can really does wonders for this beer. The hops are much fresher and the malt is much crisper and all around it's just a better drinking experience. Great session ale, nice to drink on the 4th!"
"A style that I dont see enough and rarely find alot of quality in,poured into a stein a deep bronze color with a thinner slight off white head there was a slight chill haze to it.Nice aromas sweet caramel and toasted grain with a light leafy hoppiness a full aroma for sure,well rounded and food friendly flavors starting off with a big caramel buttery sweetness with an underlying firm toastiness with a small dose of spicey/herbal hop that lingers nicely in the finish.I think a very appetizing vienna lager its just good I cant find any real faults to it really."
"D: This is nice but I think I'll stick with a Sam Adams or Eliot Ness."
"Overall: This is an awesome session beer. I had trouble describing the smell and taste because it's very light, but it's very balanced, making it hard to separate the individual flavors from the overall taste. I just came back from a softball game, and this really hits the spot as a thirst-quencher. People often put down lagers for being too boring, but this is a great example of how simple can be wonderful."
"yet crisp. A really good, balanced lager- eminently quaffable."
"Drinkability: Anyone who thinks lagers are not as flavorful as ales should try this beer. Hell, I usually think that. This beer is full and complex. Nice and refreshing. So many thinks. I like it a lot."
"overall this is a very enjoyable beer and i do believe that i will pick this up again"
"Big thanks to Chad for bringing some Schell beers back from Minnesota for us!"
"Overall a nice and drinkable lager. Another solid beer from Schell. Thanks to bulldogsturge."
"On OK beer, but not something I would re-visit."
"Found this at a local grocery store that has a great selection of beers of all types. Purchased as part of a six variety six pack from Schell brewery. This poured a brilliant golden amber color with a 1 finger head that dissipates into some nice sticky lacing. I thought the taste was lightly malty but sweet with a caramel flavor that dominates. I found it to be pleasantly creamy and not overpowering, one that could definately be a session beer. I have heard that this beer is fantastic when tried on tap."
"Color is a brilliant golden amber. Medium-firm pour and produces a rocky, two-fingered medium-pale tan head - good duration and moderate lacing. Nose is fairly malty, with caramel and light honey notes and a lightly metallic tang. There's also some biscuity malt and a slightly herbacious character in the mix. Mildly sharp from the outset, with a nice tanginess dominating. Sweet/sour, but in a fairly light, refreshing sense. Mouthfeel is good, light and cleansing but not due to brisk carbonation. Light notes of green apple, orange, and honey on the palate, with interesting aromatics: bubblegum, clover honey, and light black pepper. A touch of alohol comes through, but it blends well with the biscuity malt experienced on the nose. A fairly lighter bodied lager but *wow*! No lack of flavor here. Hop use is very restrained and the bitterness is very mild - it doesn't linger nearly as much as the tangy malt does. More fruity notes (pear!) a this warms a bit. Finish is clean and dry. Firebrick's appeal has grown on me more and more with each encounter: a lighter bodied full-flavored lager, it's the sort of thing Killian's drinkers would enjoy if only it had a better distribution. A great session beer, and great with light grilled fair in the summer. Firebrick in a can is also one of the best canned beer experiences I've ever had!"
"After going down, there was a predominant bitter dry aftertaste, much like an import pilsner. A decent beer if you have a meal to go with it."
"Poured from the bottle to an orange-amber color with good carbonation, a medium white head that disspates fairly quickly, and leaves okay lacing. Try as I might, I could not detect anything but the slightest aroma, of malt, and very little taste. This was not a bad beer, and actually had a nice smooth finish, but just lacked the aroma and taste normally found in Viennas."
"This beer isn't going to blow you away with its complexity, but it is damn drinkable."
"M&D - smooth and sweet, a rather bood beer, blended and balanced nicely with a great mouthfeel and aftertaste, will try this brewer again whenever possible"
"Very easy to drink like most Vienna Lagers, but nothing really special here."
"Originally reviewed on September 24, 2005. Poured from a bottle on the Beer Train. Orange-amber pour, with white head. Stinky malt aroma. Dry dusty old malt flavor. Finish doesnt exist. This beer has no value, as it's full of off-notes, corn fusels and water. In theory this is worse than some swills, because it's overrated and falls flat on it's face for the style."
"Leaves the mouth clean and fresh."
"Pours a three finger light tan head that fades quickly to a ring leaving some lace. Nearly clear amber color. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Slight malty nose. Starts sweet, hoppy and smooth, then sweet and finishes slightly bitter. $1.39 for a 12oz bottle from John's Grocery Iowa City, Ia."
"D- Easy and nice, very refreshing. Overall a nice easy to approach beer that is also complex."
"received as an extra in a trade with jhammerly"
"Overall this is a decent beer. It's a bit sweet for my personal taste to have to regularly though. I'm not as familiar with the (true) Vienna style as I'd like to be, but this seems to fit within those boundaries well enough."
"A nice, drinkable Vienna lager. Easy to kick back with this one while watching some NCAA football..."
"Drinkability-- too boring to drink much of this. It's fairly drinkable but .... not worth the time."
"I had tried this with the Sample pack and wasn't too impress with it or any of the Schell beers for that matter. I went to New Ulm for the Oktoberfest they have and while I was there took the tour of the brewery. While most of the samples were bottles still, they just had a better feel to them. I hit the abrs and the beer tent at the fest and WHAM! I had never seen that big a difference between bottle and draft before but Firebrick was just exceptional on tap. Great color and body. Starts malty with carmel and nut flavor. I agree with other posters that the hops hide a bit of the other toasty, bready flavors associated with this style. I really enjoyed this brew and would recommend it if you can find it on tap, skip the bottles unless they are really fresh."
"The appearance on one was good, decent head, beautiful color but minimal lacing. Smell was good as well, sweet malt hit me first and than a bit of hops. The taste was pretty similar to the smell, but it just didn't flow right. And it also wasnt very full flavored. Tough to explain but it just wasn't quite right. Mouthfeel was above average, still a bit foamy but easy to swallow. Drinkability was average..."
"A pretty tough beer to get just right. This beer starts off promising with good copper-rust color, great clarity, and withstanding head retention. Smells moderately malty with a light underlying caramel hint. Slightly hopped for interest. Bready, lightly toasty, and lightly yeasty. The flavor are less successful than aroma. The toasty, bready flavors don't come through the same. Hopped a little higher than the malt can support causes the delicate bread and yeast flavors to subside a little too much. The body falls a bit watery, but the alcohols make a bold presence without becomming too hot. A little dry in the finish, but clean despite a lingering graininess. Decent beer. I appreciate the attempt."
"Drinks about average, pretty mundane example of a vienna IMO"
"As my number ratings might suggest, I think this is a good beer. Nothing special, but probably the best of the sampler pack I got from Schells. This would be a great beer for a cold, snowy winters evening. Nice rust color, with an off-white head that doesn't retain for long. Sweet caramel like smell. Initially there is a sweet, slightly roasted caramel and red malt flavor, followed by a fruity finish.Decent mouthfeel and drinkability, all in all a pretty solid beer."
"Drinkability is overdone on this brew, it has been emasculated."
"Pours an amber copper, slightly hazy, with a nice foamy white head, and lots and lots of lacing, sticky, bubbles down the glass. Aroma is sweet malts, slightly toasty, though nothing special, though my nose might be off. Taste is pretty good, sweet caramel malts with bready, grainy notes, finishing with a nice smooth hop finish. Good body and carbonation, and smooth finish. One of Schell's best selections for sure."
"The body is light and really deters the taste. Overall its a boring brick house."
"Sweet caramel malt aroma, but something sour about it. Maybe the bottle's old. Smooth malty taste, finishing with a little bitterness. Flavor has elements of caramel and roasted/smokey barley. Easy drinking, pair with some ham, or just have a couple during the summer. Not the best vienna lager I've had, but an easy and nice alternative to adjunct lagers."
"Deasy to drink, a nice sweet and smoky brew, but nothing outstanding. A good session brew IMHO."
"This bottle poured transparent, redder than orange, which a decent head. There was no hop aroma, but detectable malt character. The taste was lightly sweet with just a bit of hop. Body is slightly fuller than the average craft brew. Nice session brew."
"An easy drinker, but it felt more like soda than beer. Honestly, I don't know how I feel about this one. I feel like the imbalance is kind of understandable, since the bittering/ hopping of these beers often feels like a forced issue. It is at least an interesting beer and I finished mine off pretty quick."
"Golden-orange color..initial foamy head dies quickly..very little retention or lacing. Heavy diacetyl..buttery, metallic taste. Somewhat smooth going down, if you can get through the somewhat off-flavors. Fairly light mouthfeel, with a finish that can do the job of quenching your thirst, but fails to impress."
"A beauty, this beer is not. A conversationalist, this beer is not. However, it is a drinker; I found this very easy to quaff. Im not wowed enough with the taste to really want to run out and buy more. I took a stab with a six-pack; I like the name and the style what the hell. I got a stand up double, not every beer is a steroid filled slugger. If you are looking for a friendly crossover type beer, try this. I purchased my sample in Council Bluffs, IA. Try one."
"This beer pours extremely clear and copper/red in color with a dense, off-white head that fades quickly. The aroma is severely lacking. I don't smell anything here that I might not smell in a macro, unfortunately. I detect faint grassy tones and perhaps a bit of corn, despite the fact that this is an all-malt lager. The taste isn't bad, but isn't as good as it could be, either. Hints of roastiness and spice work well with the flavor, but it's far more diminished than I would hope for. The mouthfeel is weak and watery. If the bitterness weren't there, I don't think I'd want to drink this. Overall, not as good as what I've come to expect from Schell, but still better than most macros."
"This beer pours a bright caramel gold with a fluffy tan and yellow head. Smells of caramel malt, cotton candy and a light citrus. Very refreshing and enticing. Tastes of creamy caramel malt, salty corn chips and a roasted sour finish. Mouth feel is thin with medium carbonation."
"If it weren't for all that ester, this would be a really nice brew."
"Pours a clear red color with a small cream white head. The aroma is thoroughly unimpressive. Faint malt tones can be detected through a cardboard backbone, but only if you concentrate extremely hard. The taste is a lot like the smell, but without the cardboard. It's mildly sweet and very wet. The mouthfeel is far too thin for a vienna lager. Overall, I'm not enjoying this beer. It is smooth and goes down easily, so I can see how certain demographics could find it enjoyable."
"If I had to describe the tatse I would say it had subtle maltiness combined with a hint of hoppy taste. Overall very malty and unique in taste definatly a very hearty drink to be enjoyed after dinner maybe. I would definatly recomend this beer and not because its a Minnesota beer and I am a Minnesotan, but because of its unique character in taste and smell."
"Awards: Bronze medal at the 2002 Great American Beer Festival."
"Drinkability: Not very sessionable, a bit too boring for me, but still fairly refreshing. Im not sure what was missing, but it didnt impress me."
"Thanks Tastytaste for the tasty beer!"
"Mouthfeel is on the thin and light side, easy to drink. Fine carbonation keeps it lively and clean. My favorite so far from this brewer. Many thanks to TastyTaste for the chance to try this one."
"Thanks to tavernjef for shipping this to me."
"Drinkability and Overall: This is a solid German-style lager for sure, but it lakes depth and complexity. Nothing about it stands out. It's still a good beer, but not one I'd conciously want another of."
"Tastes much like it smells. Solid, cookie dough malts up front, followed by balancing, spicy hops. Nice bite to it too. Finish is malty with a bitter edge. Nice malty lager, with a medium-body and slightly chewy feel. One of Schells better beers, in my humble opinion."
"Almost oragne colour, medium white head that didn't stick around all that long.Taste was wonderful, displaying flavors mixed smooth malt, earthy salts and a touch of sweetness. Malty and slightly bitter finish. A highly recommended beer for those partial to Vienna Style lagers, or those who expect a bit more in depth flavor in their brews. High drinkability, this could be a good place to start your friends who are stuck in Macro-World on the trip to Realbeerland. Recommended."
"Drinkability is fine, nothing bad to say about this beer other than it just falls a little short in the flavor department"
"Pretty good brew here. I prefer Great Lake's Elliot Ness, but since that isn't available locally, I'll have to live with this one. Not that that's a bad thing..."
"Drinkability and overall: Pretty good. It was an interesting brew for me and my first crack at a vienna lager. Not sure I'll re-visit anytime soon but one more to add to the memory banks."
"Drinkability: A decent, clean drinking lager that I'd probably get if it were local. Seems like an ideal brat beer to me. I snagged this while on a layover in the MPLS airport hoping for a rauchbier (faint hope), but wasn't displeased with what I got."
"More props to the BadMonk for shipping this Lager West!"
"Crystal clear ruddy copper hue. Frenetic carbonation supports a tall, steadfast, cream white head that yields frothy lace. Understated toasty Vienna malt with a medium caramel fringe dominates the aroma. Subdued herbal hops and a trace metallic twang are secondary. Lacks the intangible melanoidin presence of a prototypical Vienna, but is clean and well rounded, albeit tame, aromawise. In flavor, prevalent in malt backbone is a stately toffee and caramel sweetened light toast impression. Malt sweetness does not become cloying, due to both the functional hopping and ample attenuation. Becomes slightly savory as it warms, with lightly buttery, slightly salty biscuit hints arising. Moderate in body, with a suitably dextrinous, but brisk mouthfeel conducive to easy quaffing. Hop bitterness augments over time, thus drying the overall flavor profile agreeable. Finishes immaculately clean, with a combination of herbal Hallertauer and simple maltose sweetness fleeting quickly. A well crafted, albeit prosaic Vienna. Perhaps it was brewed with domestic malts? Regardless Firebrick is well rounded and superbly drinkable. Thanks to Mr. FMonk for the delivery!"
"FireBrick could stand to have a great deal more complexity, but it's still a decent, drinkable Vienna Lager."
"Hat off to the Minni Minister of beer, feloniousmonk for the sample."
"This beer is a copper colored brew, with a small cream-white head to top it off. The scent is all malts. That is true of the taste too. Completly dominated by malts, hops are very small and tough to notice. The bottle claims its an all malt brew and i would agree. Pretty good beer."
"Taste is pleasant. medium bodied with decent malt character. a little bit bready but barely. a little spicy hop zing in the back but nothing major. decent."
"Well done."
"Listed here as a Marzen/Oktoberfest, but the bottle states it is a Vienna, and which I think better fits the flavor profile. As such, a very good example of the style (which a lot of folks only know from Dos Equis). Sweet malt flavors take center stage, as they should. Some light fruit flavors, which blossomed as the beer warmed up a bit. Drinking this too cold is really missing its personality. Great session candidate. Thanks to tavernjef for a chance to sample this beer."
"Dark red orange color with two fingers of white head. Smells of citrus, vanilla, and malt. Nice balance of malt and hops, with a moderate amount of carbonation. Finishes very clean. Maybe a little too sweet, however. Tasty and refreshing, a good year-round beer."
"Sweet malty nose with a slight hint of vanilla. Dark peach color to the carbonated look. Decent white head on the pour mellows to a white sheen. Nutty rich malt taste dominates the tongue. Lively carbonation on the tongue followed by some smooth malt and a dry tongue. Solid and well rounded. A malty one..."
"Overall: I wont be stocking my shelves with the stuff!"
"The pour is a translucent copper color with a minimal head that is semi-creamy in texture and a light tan color as it evaporates, the lace forms a fine sheet upon the glass. Nose is crisp and clean and malt sweet as is the start with the top light to moderate in feel. Finish is austere in its acidity; the hops are pleasant in their spicy presence, desert dry aftertaste and a nice drinking beer that would hit the spot on a hot Arizona afternoon."
"Appearance: Is an amber copper tone with a cream colored nice sized head leaving specks of lace as it dwindles down. Aroma: Slightly metallic with a roasted malt nut tone and an underlying hop bitterness they're very mild there is no fragrance jumping out at me. Taste: Taste is a clean sweeping amount of toasted caramel malts and bitter sweet tones, nicely balanced a little mild seems mass produced but still tasty overall. Rather uninteresting compared to some Vienna styles but this one beats out the Sam Adams lineup even though this one is lacking compared to Elliot Ness overall not a bad throwback. Mouthfeel: Thin highly carbonated not much texture to speak of. Drinkability: I could put down a few without being filled up, but I wouldn't really yearn for too many of these, they're not challenging my palate seems run of the mill and for the mill I don't run."
"Easy and simple with close to medium body in feel with a quick creamy start and gaining some bolder qualities as it reaches the midway point and through to the clean crispy lightly dry finish. Quite a nice little brew, the finish is my favorite, and once it warms a bit is very nice and very drinkable. One of the better Schell's brews IMO."
"Pours a crystal clear copper color with a massive but thin off-white head with a million tiny bubbles racing to join the fluff. The smells of malted earthy grain and very light hops are seeping from the head. The taste repeats with the earthy grain with a lightly sweetened background a very faint hops. This light-bodied brew drinks down very easy with a watery-like characteristic and finishes just barely dry and an astringent taste. Not bad, but not great either. Rather weak in the flavor department, but still goes down nicely in this Texas heat. Thanks to budgood1. Cheers!"
"A frothy off-white head holds well over a slightly hazy and deep-amber body with a reddish cast. Some nice lacing adds to the appearance, although it doesn't stick to the glass for very long. The aroma displays a clean, gently sweet and mildly toasted malt that's quite welcoming. The body combines a firm maltiness with a gently crisp carbonation for a smooth and lightly creamy mouthfeel. The flavor delivers the rich Munich/Vienna maltiness that the nose promises; well-balanced by a firm bitterness. It's clean and fresh with the malt dominating the bitterness and just a touch of hop flavor at the tail end. It ends with a surge of sweetish, toasty malt followed by drying bitterness in a long and enjoyable finish. It's not complex; nor is it supposed to be. It's quaffability we're looking for here! Very nicely done and quite enjoyable. This beer appears to contain all of the aspects of a brilliant Vienna-style lager and I'd highly recommend it as a perfect companion to grilled and barbecued foods during the summer season."
"I really liked this one. The copper orange color and decent white head made for a nice appearance. The aroma was fine with malt, hops, and citrus. The taste is very well balanced, the sweetness of the malt held in check by by the light hopping that it finishes with. Medium to light bodies, I found this to be a very drinkable beer. You won't get tired of it."
"Nonetheless, Firebrick's a winner."
"Notes. Picked this up as a single, very drinkable brew."
"While not a powerhouse, flavor-wise, this is a decent version of a vienna-style lager. It pours out to a reddish-brown in the glass with light aroma of malt. Taste is that of malt with a light caramel and toffee also present. Not as flavorful as Sam Adams offering and not as good as the Great Lakes Brewing version. However, it is a good beer and worthy of drinking on occasion."
"I thought this beer was better than most beer advocates did.  The appearance was hazy copper with a short lasting head.  The aroma was big malt, then faint spicy hops.  The flavor was spiced malt, with a hop presence that was appealing.  The beer was smooth with a long lasting flavor.  Pretty good, though I don't have much experience with this style."
"This is a very light, refreshing session beer.  It has an amber color with an off-white head.  There is just a slight maltiness to the aroma and taste.  The hop presence was really unnoticable.  I find it odd that this beer just took a bronze metal at the GABF for the American-Style Amber Lager when August Schell sells it as a Vienna-Style Lager.  I do find that it fits more into the style of American-Style Amber Lager than a Vienna-Style Lager."
"Nice copper/orange hue with a minimal beige head that recedes to an edging in mere seconds.  Lace is negligible.  There's some slight maltiness on the nose.  Body seems lighter than it should be, mabye medium at best.  There are some slight toasted characteristics.  Also some slight nutty tones.  Hop contributions are minimal.  Better than average, but not great."
"Schell FireBrick:  If this beer’s not flat, then it’s the least carbonated beer I’ve ever had. Name is dead on, however, this is a fire brick red beer in appearance.   Malt aroma is very apparent, and there is a malt sweetness to this beer, but there is an unpleasant sourness as well.  Not worth your while."
"This is a beer that the more I taste it the more I like it. Well balanced, with some nice subtle qualities. Good with food or as a session brew."
"Notes: Very drinkable with big malt complexities. If you like sizeable malty lagers this will be a treat for you. Big enough to pair up with some schnitzel and kraut."
"One of the most drinkable of the malty beers.  And I like that this style is still around.  Its quite orange in color and pours with little head at all.  There's a slight bready quality to the mid mouth impact, but the flavor is balanced and lessens evenly as its swallowed.  I don't look for a lot of bite or chewy mouthfeel in Vienna Lagers, so I'm pretty happy with FireBrick."
"This is one of my favorite easy drinking beers...I struggle to get much aroma, and there is very little head to this beer after the initial pour.  Orangish is color.  This beer is kind of an Octoberfest light...It has some nice semi- sweet tones to it, but is considerably thinner than most Octoberfests..I think this beer would appeal to the beginner conniseur as well as the experienced beer lover.  It is very smooth..has very little hopping, and has a nice malty, but not overly sweet taste to it.  At one point I thought this was on a par with the better Octoberfests...But, me and my brother did a blind taste test with 15 Octoberfests last fall (talk about a challenge at 6 ounces each) and this was not nearly as tasty as the true Octoberfests..I just bought a six-pack, and the memory remains the same...A nice well made easy drinking malty beer...I could drink a lot of these..."
"this beer is presents a challenge to review because i perceive it as so balanced and smooth nothing stands out.  but maybe that's the beauty of it.  it looks like a red and has a medium body and light smooth creamy mouthfeel of roasted caramel malt.  very muted nose of malts and hops....and a very lightly hopped finsh.  so easy to drink which i would think would appeal to many beer drinkers in general because what it lacks in complexity is made up because of quality."
