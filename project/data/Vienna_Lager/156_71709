3.74,16.9,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,"But that maltiness isn't overwhelming in the taste. Nice balance with that and noble hops, grassiness. Easy drinking, nice light weight feel and good carbonation fizz. Would go well with many menu items, or as a beginner in a flight.","Mebuzzard","Jul 14, 2013"

3.02,-5.6,3.5,3.25,2.75,3.25,3,"Sure, but when am I gonna finally get my hands on an Innsbruck-style amber lager...? Anyway, this stuff pours a clear copper-amber topped by a finger of off-white foam. The nose comprises dried maple syrup, straight barley, light biscuit, and a hint of lemon pepper. Didn't see that last one coming... The taste brings in more of the same, along with some very light sweetgrass and a thick veneer of some strange, vague fruitiness, one with a bit of vinosity buoying about every now and again. It's a kinda odd combination, really, and it has me vacillating between bemusement and very minor disgust. It's hard to explain... The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, a sub-standard Vienna lager, one that just comes across as off-the-mark to me.","TMoney2591","Mar 12, 2013"
3.06,-4.4,3.75,3.25,3,2.5,3,"Problematic on many fronts, the beer in extremely very few ways resembles a Vienna Lager. If this is the style you seek, then you'll find great favor in Samuel Adams Lager, Negra Modelo, and Flying Dog Old Scratch. But if you want a real delight, Great Lakes Eliot Ness is a must-win choice.","BEERchitect","Mar 05, 2013"

3.32,3.7,3.5,3.25,3.25,3.75,3.25,"O: This beer seems to be a little too malty and sweet for the style; it could use a little more bitterness from the hops. It's easy to drink but I'm not sure if I would have another one of these.","metter98","Feb 21, 2013"

3.92,22.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Plays a hazy, copper/red color. 1/3 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of alcohol, sweet malt, hops, slight floral notes, hint of citrus, and a hint of caramel malt. Fits the style of a Vienna Lager. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, slight caramel malt, slight hops, hint of bread, hint of citrus, and a hint of floral notes. Overall, good appearance, decent body, blend, and aroma.","Tone","Oct 24, 2012"

3.41,6.6,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Conclusion: This isn't a bad lager, but it seems to lack a clean crispness that the best of this style have. Amber lagers can be quite tasty under the right conditions. The flavors I can taste are good, but they don't mesh as well as they could.","allforbetterbeer","Aug 04, 2011"
