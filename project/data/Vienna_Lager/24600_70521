3.49,-5.4,3.75,2.75,3.75,3.5,3.75,"quality lager here, and the vienna style never really does much for me, but this one never gets sweet, and relies more on a special red type malt than the same generic medium crystal we always see, and the yeast character adds a lot to a beer that usually has very little of it. frothy looking light amber brew, to call it red is a stretch, but it has great clarity and it holds its head. the nose on it s really muted, almost stale and with a wet cardboard thing, it doesnt smell real nice at all honestly, but the taste is lovely. dry but still malty is hard to do, refreshing in the finish with a light dried fruit character and the lager yeast. hops arent robust, but the beer is well balanced. light enough to drink a ton of, good in all seasons, and finally an example of a vienna lager that i would buy again.","StonedTrippin","Dec 14, 2014"

3.91,6,2.5,4,4,4,4,"Pours a clear copper with a foamy bone colored head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, caramel, and some slight metallic notes. Taste is much the same along with some herbal hop flavors. There is a mild hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is drinkable but pretty basic.","GRG1313","Jun 15, 2012"

4.17,13,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Great color, head retention, and lacing. Brilliant amber colored, thick rings of lace around the glass, and a head that lasts forever. Not so much is the aroma, which is mostly a mild toasty sensation (no rhyme intended). However, the taste is an improvement, where the toasty malt is more intense, some bread crust is thrown in, and is a little fruity. Light bodied, crisp, refreshing. Reasonable beer, like a beefier version of Yeungling.","BeerManDan","Feb 18, 2012"
4,8.4,,,,,,"The color was a medium reddish brown with a medium amount of white foam and some lace. The smell of lightly roasted malts and the aroma of soft hops was evident in to aroma. The taste was one of the best Danish Reds i've ever had. Nicely balanced in aroma and flavor. Suttle and not overly bitter or sweet. What a pleasant surprise.","Rau71","Jan 11, 2012"
