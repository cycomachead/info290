The flavor has a slightly nutty character with the caramel malts, but it also tastes like a there's a little adjunct (corn, I think) mixed in. Overall, this kind of tastes like a slightly darker Yuengling lager. Saranac makes better beer. I'd stick to with the Black Forest.","tempest","Dec 01, 2012"

Taste is tolerable, little slippery for a nut brown but the flavor is right on with the aspects of the style (hops play well too). Moderately carbonated which is very nice, abv nonexistent in the wash down, little thin in texture sums it up nicely. Drinkability? Sure, why not.

Feel of the beer is medium, and the carbonation is not overdone. Drinkability is good on this lager, though it is geared toward the malty side, there is some dry bitterness that comes in and keeps it in check. A pretty solid beer year to year from Saranac and a winner in the winter 12-pack.","kkosmoski","Jan 07, 2009"

The aroma is piney hops, nuts, toffee and caramel. It tastes like toasted and bready malt, nuts, toffee, and piney hops. There's a slight bitter hoppy and nutty finish. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it has good carbonation which works well with this beer.

3.5,1.2,4,4,3,4,3.5,"""Nut Brown Lager."" Wtf. Ok I guess I'm excited, sounds pretty tasty and unusual. Just noticed the nice artwork on the label which I don't think I've been appreciating when it comes to the rest of Saranac's beers. Pours a nice amber brown.. maybe a little too similar to their ESB if they're trying to differentiate the two based on color. But good head and good lacing. Aroma is great, very perfume-y and piney, but it's either how it mixes with the rest of the malt or something else that makes it unique. Taste is a huge kick in the malt bone, if there was one. Astringency is very noticeable though, which seems to be a problem for Saranac's beers. The complex roasted malt flavors retain their integrity in the face of the lagering process, which was what I was worried about. I was worried it was going to be like the Indian Brown Ale and taste nothing like a brown anything, but it definitely pulls through. Unfortunately, the astringency is a huge flaw and affects my score significantly. Mouthfeel benefits form the overall malt character- medium to full body and really pleasant to drink. Probably a tie with the ESB for my favorite in the mix pack. Just fix that astringency, apply it to the other beers in the pack and I'd be really happy.","wiseguy142","Nov 18, 2008"

Basically like drinking a lager with a touch of nutty malt flavors. There is a strange finish to this, which I picked up in their Chocolate Amber Lager as well, that is hard to put words to.

3.66,5.8,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,3,"While my least-favorite of all styles, this is decent as far as a nut brown ale (ahem..lager) goes. It has the traditional characteristics, and like I said, the yeast that normally pollutes their other beers with diacetyl is appropriate here. I wouldn't want to drink this again, but I would recommened it to people who like nut-browns...but then again, who really does?!","Mitchster","Sep 10, 2004"
3.71,7.2,4,3,4,3.5,4,"Matt's seasonal lager displays a clear chestnut body with a reddish cast and golden-orange highlights beneath a short but long-lasting head of creamy ivory froth. Some minor lacing about the glass adds nicely to its appearance as well. The nose is typically restrained for a dark lager, with only some mild malt coming through. The body is medium and it's fine-bubbled carbonation bristles gently on the tongue. The flavor is well-balanced and straightforward throughout with a bit of rich, caramel-kissed maltiness backed by a solid bitterness and some delicately spicy and floral hops. It finishes dry with some of its nutty maltiness and floral/spicy hops lingering amidst a dull bitterness. It's not complex, but it satisfies, and this is a well-crafted holiday seasonal that doesn't need to depend on any fruits, spices, or gimmicks to warrant attention and a place on your holiday table. Well done!","NeroFiddled","Aug 30, 2004"

3.5,1.2,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"It has a crytal clear copper color. It leaves decent lace on the glass even though I was not impressed with the head. It has a toasted nut aroma with some hop character that comes off as grassy/hay like. It is medium bodied with toatsed nut flavors and a dry, bitter finish. My major quibble is that Saranac's best beers are not year round.","ark57","Feb 24, 2004"
4.1,18.5,4,4,4,4,4.5,"A very good beer that is much more hoppy than most dunkels. I lean toward hops. If I was grading against style, I'd probably dock this one.

2.86,-17.3,4,3,2.5,3,3,"Pours a dark, deep amber-brown color with a respectably solid head. Small tufts of foam cling to the sides of the glass. Aroma is toasty, nutty, and slightly malty with a distant backbone of alcohol. Nice aroma hop profile for the style. Taste is caramel and a little vegetal. It has medium body and is a bit grainy and rough. Moderate carbonation. Finishes with a lingering, and not particularly pleasant bitterness.something of a burnt graininess. I cant say that it impressed me.","Suds","Feb 01, 2004"
3.08,-11,3.5,3,3,2.5,3.5,"Thin, tan head atop a dark reddish brown pour. There is a hefty lacing that coats the glass. Definitely a nutty brew. This is my first Nut Brown Lager. The mouthfeel is very dry. The taste is strong with alcohol. The hops don't stick out too much. Seems like there is a ton of malt. Drinkability is good and it seems like a good session ale. Not sure about the ABV. A good holiday ale!","Maestro","Jan 15, 2004"

3.85,11.3,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"This beer pours a light brown/red color with a small head that sticks around. The aroma is just as the name states - roasted nuts and malts with some sweetness.

2.53,-26.9,3.5,3,2,3,2.5,"It's definitely ""full flavored", but the flavors that are full aren't particularly pleasant.

3.72,7.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Appearance: Ruby copper red with a nice fluffy cream colored head leaves little lacing not too impressive. Aroma: Full on toasted nuts this one is very similar to the Erie Railbender in my opinion not bad at all they do a nice job, I'm not sure what they are talking about the bottle as far as Belgian malts in a nut brown lager but whatever floats their boat. Taste: Nice rolling toasted nut tones not overly sweet nice earthy hop bitterness in the finish, simple but nice. Mouthfeel: A bit overcarbonated is the only thing bad about the texture, other than that a lighter to medium bodied amber colored lager not bad. Drinkability: Pretty tasty I could picture myself enjoying a couple of these very nice toned down compared to beers I have had as of late.","WVbeergeek","Dec 06, 2003"

3.43,-0.9,4,3.5,3,3.5,4,"Crystal clear garnet, with a distinct bister tinge. One fingered, persistent off white head leaves frothy, sparse lace. Sweet biscuit, along with a nutty, sugary marzipan like impression dominates the aroma. Bitter chocolate and woody hop tones timidly arise as the brew warms. Akin to a dunkel / English nut brown ale hybrid in aroma. Gentle dark toffee sweetness initially in flavor is ensued by mild toasted grain notes. Hop flavor is more herbal than expected from the aroma, with definite green, Hersbrucker hints. Hop bitterness is above the norm for a dunkel, but remains gentle and pleasantly drying. Once tepid cocoa eeks in mid palate, the flavor remains static, with little change other than trace salty cracker notes that emerge in the finish. Well attenuated, but sufficiently dextrinous and smooth in mouthfeel once the initial carbonic bite subsides. A relatively tasty dunkel, with an innocuous, one dimensional overall character. Impressively clean, well brewed and drinkable, though.","marc77","Nov 25, 2003"
3.67,6.1,3,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Hm, a nut brown lager? Decided it would be worth a try. Pours deep copper with a medium-sized head that dissipates rather quickly. Rich, malty nose. Quite enjoyable on the palate - malty, nutty, a hint of brown sugar or molasses. Gives a slight warming feeling down the throat, too. It's a bit like Newcastle, only slightly darker and a bit fizzier. I have to say I like it.","ElGordo","Nov 18, 2003"

3.41,-1.4,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Foamy pale tan head had decent staying power, and left some nice lacing. The beer is clear, and dark chestnut in color. The aroma is all malt, maybe a bit much for a nut brown, but since this is a lager and not an ale it makes a little more sense. The flavor is a lot more balanced, nice nutty maltiness is replaced a dry hop bitterness in the finnish. I haven't had too many nut brown lagers, but this is a decent beer.","HappyHourHero","Nov 14, 2003"
3.48,0.6,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,4,"A little syrupy even, I'm not sure what to make of this. The sugars are felt rather than tasted; I wouldn't want to tackle more than one of these in a sitting.

Nice backround of sweet malts, and the hoppiness is there as well. A touch of caramel at the start, and then it drops out of the way for a bit of bitterness. A nice flavorful brew. It is not a world class brew, but it is very drinkable and tasty. Well done on this one.","ElGuapo","Oct 27, 2003"
