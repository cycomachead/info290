"O: a quite respectable version of the style, even ignoring the low cost."

"Overall - Pretty good Vienna here if you aren't expecting the world, and there'd be no reason to considering the price. Bargain deal from Trader Joe's. I'd consider buying it again, though if I'm being honest it wouldn't even be close to my first choice at TJ's."

"O: Pretty good example of the style and easy to drink - nothing outstanding but certainly well worth the very reasonable price. Definitely a malty brew but that was to be expected with the style."
""
""
"O- This is my first time buying beer brewed by TJ's and it was not as disappointing as I thought it would be. Pleasantly surprised actually. I am drinking this one to do homework on a recipe I plan to brew. The recipe is a Vienna malt IPA, think it might work? We'll find out! In the meantime, if you want something different yet vaguely familiar, check out this brew."

"Got this as part of a Josephsbrau 12 beer variety pack for 9.99. Pours a dark amber color with an attractive head. Taste is mostly hops, pretty expected taste of this style of beer. Definitely better than some other red ale/amber lager style beers that I've tried."

"Overall the beer is very tasty, and I can see myself picking up a sixer of this next time I'm at trader joe's. Very good job on this one."

"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a medium coppery amber with a one finger ivory head kept intact by constant carbonation. Aroma of sweet caramel malt with a touch of toasted malt, mildy spicy. Flavor is biscuit and lightly toasted malt, starts semi-sweet but turns somewhat dry, light grassy hops and hints of wheat and grain. Finishes with earthy malt and light vegetal notes. Medium bodied with nice carbonation. A satisfactory example of a traditionally laid back style. Nothing too exciting here, but it is what it sets out to be, a decent budget Vienna lager. Finish is slightly off, but otherwise a pleasant accompaniment for a meal or sessioning."
"Will grab this one again."
" I like the balance of malt and hops. A beer that I would repeat at $6.99 a six pack. Might even keep in the beer fridge. A Nice little beer."

"Vienna Style Lager's confused flavor profile is utterly disappointing. The ingredients are obviously fresh. The yeast strain doesn't leave any unwanted flavors. It's got a lot of potential, but fails to deliver. I won't revisit this one."

"O: This beer is nice and malty but is also rather drinkable. It's a pretty good representation of the style."
"Overall: Not a bad beer especial if is ice cold. If I was in mood for this style of beer I would buy it again. The price is right too!"
""
"The taste is too sweet and malty for my liking. Some folks may like that. Caramel and toffee notes up front. Low to played down bitterness at the end."
""
"O: This beer manages to be better than the sum of its parts. The flavors do not stand out in any way, but something about it is slightly better than average. Looks good apart from the lack of head and its easy to drink."
""

"notes: too sweet"
""
""
""

"O- A decent lager, probably won't get again."
""

"The dms and astringent characters detract from the experience. Good melanoidin flavors, though."

"Taste is caramelized toast with a dollop of creamed corn. Not really a good example of the style, or a beer for that matter. But it does not really taste all that bad...I have a soft spot in my heart for diacetyl in ambers so this is somewhat enjoyable for me. Mouthfeel is fairly full for the style due to the sweetness, and the carbonation is ample. Not too bad despite all the flaws, but I am ok with just having this single."
"A decent take on the style, better than most mass-market lagers utilizing the name (along with an excess of adjuncts) while ignoring the traditions associated with it."
""
"O: a nice beer from TJ's - perhaps the best of the Joseph's Brau line; extra hops would make it perfect."
""
""
""
"O: Good Vienna Lager. Just not a fan of Vienna Lagers, per se."
"Very good representation of the Vienna lager style. Pours with nice foamy white head and biscuity aroma characteristic of the style. Color is a rich amber hue. Taste is enjoyable with carmel biscuit malt favor reminicient of fresh bread, perfect for fall. Body is medium, but matches what I would expect for this style. I tried this by only purchasing two bottles. I will easily pick up a 6-pack next time at Trader Joe's. Good brew."

"O: I don't know how much I paid for this, but I know it was cheap. So it's got that going for it. Inoffensive, but nothing memorable."
""
""
"O: These TJ beers seem to be doing a great job of lowering my rAvg (their Oatmeal Stout notwithstanding), but truth be told, this is decent enough. Nothing special at all, but like the other TJ beers, its price point help mask its deficiencies somewhat."
""
"Not a bad beer overall. The smell is the only thing that held it back."
""
"I guess it's a matter of taste whether you like this flabby style of lager. I suppose I should try some of the better examples of Vienna Lager so I'll know what it's supposed to taste like. 12 oz bottle from TJs."
""

"This Vienna Lager is simple to the point and tasty! And at a damn good price!"
""
""
""
"Poured a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. This Vienna Lager poured a clear amber color, produced a white head, average retention and it left some lacing on the glass. The aroma consisted of malted grain, and caramel. Medium in body, this brew had a nice toasted malted barley base and a kiss of hop flavor. Excellent mouthfeel, very nice example of a Vienna Lager - Some of the Macro Brews could take a lesson from this lager. Prost!"
""
""
""
"Pours a clear copper color with a 1 inch foamy orange-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Thin rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is malty and slightly metallic as well. Taste is malty and slightly fruity. There is a mild bitterness that quickly fades after each sip. This beer has a light level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty average lager that’s not too bad but I wouldn’t buy this one again. Cheap enough though at $1 for the bottle."
""
"O: Overall this is a good value - a nice easy drinking lager. I'd seek this out again from Trader Joe's."
"O: This beer's only downfall is that it is one dimensional. You have a big malt backbone, and distinct caramel, chocolate, barley and muncih, but it lacks the balance, that would make it a true top beer. I really did like this beer, in fact, im probably going to go buy some more today, and i recommend you do the same."
""
"Not real great, might be oxidized, but is several months before the best buy date, so its not due to age."
"1.5 finger head which rapidly dissipates on a hazy amber with golden hues body. Nice lace. Very malt heavy aroma, almost like you are smelling it in the brew tank. A little musty. Flavor is also a thick sweet caramel malt flavor. Nothing watered down about this one. I actually really like this flavor. It's very cereal like. Medium to full body for the style and moderate carbonation. Very drinkable."
""
"Overall, I think this is a very easy drinking lager with a great taste. I enjoyed it a lot."
""
""
"O - Despite a few minor flaws, it's a decent beer for the price of Budweiser, which is always welcome in my book."
"The taste was a little malty, with some good spices, it just wasn't to my liking. It's caramelized very well, but something else was holding it back for me."
" Didn't like this one at all. Avoid."
"M: The feeling is nice pleasant, starting with some sweetness and a little bitterness ending."
"O: A very well made beer to style. The flavour is right where I need it to be. At $5.99 a sixer this is a steal."
"D-I wish I had known this was made by Gordon Biersch, because it tastes exactly like their Marzen, which isn't exactly my favorite Marzen."
"Dr: It's very drinkable, decently priced, and of pretty good quality. I'd have it again, especially if it were on draught."
"smooth mouthfeel: just right and extremely drinkable. Excellent beer as an amazing price ($5.99 for a sixer). Very good beer, nice as we easy into autumn."
"Here's a little shocker to come out of Trader Joe's. And what has been mentioned many times over, as a bonus, the price is tough to beat."
"T: Roasted malts come out first and there's a slightly bitter quality to them. Almost like they were overroasted a bit. Slight bit of breadiness creeps in with some faded hops on the finish. The final taste is slightly off with a hint of aspirin."
" The carbonation was good too, and it wasn't until I worked my way down my glass that I was able to pick up any of the alcohol. It's present but not enough to detract from having more than one in a session. If more of the Trader Joe's carried alcohol, I'd certainly get this again. For a cheap beer, this is about as good as it gets!"
"Overall: A decent lager that tastes a lot like a marzin. Very malt forward but still good."
"Taste is very nice toasty bread & grain, caramelly nuttiness, light sweetness with balancing light spicy-peppery-toasty bitterness. It has a nice, firm well-rounded character with good balance and some complexity. Overall, it’s an excellent Vienna."
"D - A good all-around beer"
"Poured a rich amber color with an average amount of white foamy head on it. Doesn't look like a ton of carbonation throughout the glass. Smells like malt, not much else coming through. Taste is decent. Nothing spectacular, kind of bready or grainy. Light-medium mouthfeel. Reasonably drinkable - wouldn't be my first choice, but it's not bad."
"Overall: It was a nice, sweet, inexpensiv beer. But it was just too sweet for me, good honey taste."
"D - This is decent vienna lager. Very easy to drink. At 5.99 a sixer...serious consideration to have on hand as a flavorful session option. Still better than most macros."
"Drinkability: A dollar won't get you much these days, but what it will get you is a decent, sweet, cost-effective brew for these tough, bitter times."
"Prosit!"
"D: There is nothing really remarkable about this beer, but it is very drinkable."
"The beer is a beautifully clear amber color with an off-white head and some moderately ok lacing. There is sweet toasted malt in the aroma and a hint of caramel that is inappropriate for the style but inviting none the less. The initial flavor is sweet toasted malt, but the sweetness is not at all overwhelming. The flavor immediately transitions to a slightly bitter finish but overall stays very balanced. The flavor could use some more complexity, but it is quite good. An average Vienna Lager, but the quality to price ratio of this beer are more than enough reasons for me to recommend it to anyone."
"overall not terrible, just an average beer, that was about it."
"Pours a slightly cloudy amber body with a one inch white head. Smells initially malty (caramel) prior to a hoppy bite. Slight EtOH in the nose. Tastes pretty much the same as the smell, somewhat bready and a good hop complimentation to support the caramel malt backbone. Feels somewhat slick but not too much to make this beer off-putting. Overall, a great TJ beer and the best of the three TJ's I have had so far!"
"All in all, this is a real solid Vienna style lager. It's sweet and malty, with just a hint of hops in the after taste. The beer pours an crisp amber color, with little head and just a little bit of lacing on the glass. It's not a go to style for me, but this is a session lager that I'd go to instead of a macro offering."
"12 oz. bottle. Pours copper in color with a nice, lacy, white head. Not much carbonation. Aroma is malty, bready but very weak. Watery on a palate with a caramel malt upfront and week spicy hoppy finish. Not the best Vienna, but very drinkable and inexpensive."
"I wonder if a Chicago-style lager would be thick... The brew pours a clear amber-orange topped by a bit less than a finger of white foam. The nose comprises caramel, buttery biscuits, some crumbs of rye bread, and a touch of orange. The taste butters everything up, literally, while simultaneously increasing the orange flavor. Interestingly, this ends up being a good thing, tasting pretty...tasty. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a smooth feel. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised with this beer. After being underwhelmed with the look and smell, things turned for the positive. Always nice to have a happy ending (insert massage parlor joke here)."
"Easy enjoyable with good drinkability."
"Overall this is a choice brew. Definitely my favorite in the style that I've tried - yes, even better than Sam Adams. Especially for the value, this makes a great ""standard"" brew to keep around, is both enjoyable enough for me to appreciate it, and ""simple"" enough for non beer-loving friends to enjoy. Also, certainly the strongest in the Trader Joe's line of these apparently german-inspired brews. Will continue to pick this one up."
"Pours a light copper color with a bit of an off white head that has a bit of staying power but then does not leave behind too much lacing. Served into a pilsner glass. The nose is light with some bread and a bit of caramel malt. Not too much involved. Maybe a bit of yeasty dough. Light to medium mouthfeel with decent carbonation. Average drinkability--nothing wrong with it but nothing good about it either."
"I got a bunch of the German Style beers and assumed that the Vienna lager, i.e. Corona, Dos Equis, would be mundane and uninteresting. I was looking forward, however, to the Pilsner. The opposite is what happened. I loved the Vienna. Very good color, flavor, aroma and balance. Very good and I'll have it again. The pilsner, however, is not so great."
"Drinkability: Not a bad brew to sip and relax, without having much complexity to think about here."
"Pretty good beer...a little light in the mouthfeel department, but a decent hop profile without the malty syrupyness I sometimes find in so-called ""Vienna""-style beers. I think Trader Joe's does a much better job than Costco with their in-house brand beer (although I have not tried all of TJ's offerings)...I think it's great that mass-market retailers are finally trying to make beers like Vienna. The price is good, too, and TJ's is a good shopping experience (with no Whole Foods attitude)."
"Refreshing but a little underattenuated and thick, nit a bad beer."
"There's just not much to say. It really wasn't anything in the way of interesting. oh well..."
"Drinkability: This is a decent representation of its style, though even Sam Adams Boston Lager is better. Still, this is vey cheap and cheaper than even BMC beers (at least here in NYC) so is definitely something worth buying, even more than once."
"This is really light and wonderful with a nice drying and only a mild citrus aftertaste. I could definitely drink these all day and will be buying more...especially at under $6 a 6'r at Trader Joe's."
"Taste: Starts out with a nice sweetness that leads into a slight bitterness. Nothing outstanding but still pretty good."
"Biscuity and bready with some sweet caramel malt, the flavor is crisp, clean and light. A slight hint of floral hops lends a little bit of bitterness to this fairly well balanced beer. Medium/light bodied and well carbonated, this is really a nice light lager that is very easy to drink. Unfortunately, I think it falls short of what a good Vienna Lager should be, but it is a decent, enjoyable lighter beer"
"Drinkability: A nice example of a great style. I could easily drink this all day long as it goes down real smooth and has a bit better of a flavor profile than many of the Mexican versions. Add to that the $6 price tag and this one looks like a winner."
"Overall: Thumbs up to Trader Joe's here. A well-than-above-average brew."
"The mouth has a decent heft for the style and I think it is pretty easy to drink. Would go great with Oriental chicken wings, pork chops and/or corn on the cob."
"Oh and the most important part - the price. In Manhattan a six pack goes for $1-2 less than a sixer of bud light."
"Short, off-white head doesn't last very long. Transparent, amber colored beer holds a few streams of slowly rising bubbles. Mild aroma of spicy noble hops. Faint malt flavor up front. Crisp carbonation washes it away making for a mild bittnerness goes well with the dry finish. Although the abv is low there is just a hint of warming alcohol. Overall a crisp, clean, malty beer that goes down quite easily for a 5.7% beer."
"I really like this , especially for the price."
"This is the best beer from Trader Joe's that I have tried. For the price you can't go wrong here."
"Mouthfeel, remains constant, doesn't develop any nuances throughout. Gets some drinkability props for being cheap."
"Great session beer, not terribly special, but very well done."
"12 ounce bottle poured into a pint glass. Clear amber color with a fading white head. Aroma is sweet toasted grains and toffee, with a whisper of bubblegum and red fruit with warmth. Toasty grainy flavor, seems pretty similar to an authentic Vienna lager but without the earthy hops. Sweet and a little sticky for a low gravity lager. Could stand to be crisper. Medium/light body with ample carbonation."
"Drinkability: Went excellent with a meal - in this case a pork BBQ sandwich and fries. Could have another if I was having a big meal."
"D: Honestly, I could drink these all night, and they're probably no more than 5.99 per six pack. Could get dangerous."
"An above average lager with good taste and a great price tag of $5.99. Will return."
"D - Far from perfect, but for the price ($5.99 for a six pack of bottles) I am not complaining. The kind of nasty aftertaste fades away quickly, and becomes less noticable as a bottle goes on. Not bad, not good - I might buy it again just for the price, and because I really like Vienna Lagers."
"Pours a clear dark amber, rather typical but still appealing, with a fairly thick and persistent off-white head. Aroma is malty but not strong, nothing special but not bad either. Flavor is malty and has just a hint of fruit and a touch of caramel. Texture is fizzy and tingly. Overall, not too shabby."
"Hey it is worth a try and for the price it is a pretty good deal."
"Drinkability: VSL is very drinkable, though it's not a hot day, tailgate brew. It's a high quality choice for a lager, on par with its neighbors in South Germany."
"Extremely tasty but bitter. I could see this being a once in a while kind of brew, and drinking too much is not recommended due to the imbalance between the sweetness and bitterness...but very decent indeed."
"Drinkability: This beers mouthfeel doesn't really make it an incredibly drinkable beer for me due to the carbonation. However, it is not a bad beer by any means especially considering I am typically not a huge fan of lagers."
"D- for the price this is fantastic. easy to finish and something different that's pretty sessionable. ill check this one out again, and try some of the others in the Trader Joe's line."
"Nice clear amber with a decent head and very minor lacings. Aroma is mild malts. Taste is sweet dark malts with a Pilsner like bitterness to the hops. Pretty well balanced. Mouthfeel is good carbonation level alright. Slightly dry finish. Quite sessionable for a lager. Good value as well."
"TJ's Vienna Lager. I can see there's a little bit of slightly yellowed tan to the creamy one-finger head. Nice. The body is clear with a deep-amber/copper color. Pretty good head retention. Decent lacing. The aroma is solid, with a clean, distinctly grainy maltiness that's nutty and subtly caramelish. I don't find any hops, but they are there in the flavor - floral and spicy - backing the toasty maltiness. It's rich, but I don't want to say rich, I don't want to give the impression that it's bigger than it is. There's just the right amount of maltiness to it! And there's just enough Vienna malt in the grain bill that it's toasty, nutty and delicately caramelish with an almost fruity side as well. (Don't ask me to explain that, I can't, I don't know where it comes from but I find it in quite a few Vienna lagers/Maerzens where the grain bill has enough Vienna malt to do it). As usual, it's really well rounded with a malt focus and hop-spice accent; and it's perfectly balanced by a stiff bitterness that allows the malt to shine but keeps it from becoming cloying. It finishes dry, but with some residual malt and hops lingering behind. This can be a hard style to do because it's easy to go too light or too full, but they've nailed it. I'd even prefer this to some of the more watered-down versions coming out of Germany for Oktoberfest these days. Really nice! Worth trying!"
"I'm getting a bit of carmel, slight hops, some malts. Overall I'd say this is good, very drinkable. Again this is another beer that I don't find all that complex, but easy to drink. Would buy again."
"Not bad at all, pretty spot on for the style."
"A definite session beer and a good example of the style. Buy one for a buck at Trader Joes."
"D: High. Not too flavorful before it warms a bit. I thought Boston Lager and maybe Brooklyn lager were vienna lagers, and so I expected this to taste more like those, but this really tastes nothing like those; for example I can't say I detected hops at all in this. Very much on the malty side. But it's cheap, so it's worth trying in case you like it."
"D - This is an okay vienna lager. Very easy to drink and very affordable."
"Drinkability: An overall mediocre beer. The fresh grain smell and flavor is impressive and refreshing, but not much else going for it. My first and last of this one."
"D: One of the better of the Trader Joe's offerings. Along with Winterfest Lager and Trinity Ale, I'll be bringing back some of these in 6'ers to take to poker night in the future. A solid amber lager that I actually enjoy more than SA Boston Lager for its mellowness."
"Pours a clear amber color with decent head. Poor head retention and little lacing. Smells of lager cleanliness and some grass. Sharp, rather sour aftertaste that lessens with more drinks. Stronger than average carbonation. Rather bland characteristics plus the sour taste makes it hard to recommend this brew."
"D: A good beer to have with a meal (Thai is what I had) or over a game of cards, but nothing amazing."
"thanks John"
"Drinkability: Not bad for the price I suppose, and it can be sessioned, but more flavor and a bigger body would do a lot for this brew."
"FYI - you can fill any sixer with any 6 beers to form a sampler at Trader Joe's."
"D - Pretty good, solidly malty lager."
"Pours a nice amber copper color with a medium head. Some lacing on the surface. Aroma is muted herbal and grassy hops. Taste is mostly caramel and toasted flavors. Becomes a little sweet then finishes with a slight bitterness. Some herbal hops. Medium bodied, not overly carbonated. Quite drinkable. Overall a pleasant malty beer."
"Edit: Tried again Jan. '09. Smell is lighter, taste is flatter and offers lighter carbonation. Dinged the taste .5 as a result. The dumbing down continues I guess."
"D- A pretty average vienna lager. For the price it's worth it, especially if someone offers you one. I wouldn't go out of my way looking for this brew though."
"The Vienna lager is one that is not brewed as much as it should be in my estimation. To me, this style is an excellent first beer for those unfamiliar with craft brewing. This particular take on this style is well done. Sweet, malty and crisp, there is nothing objectionable here. The mouthfeel is a little sticky, but overall this is a well made lager that is very easy to drink. Recommended."
"Poured true to style, bright amber with a red hue. Nose is bit weak. The mouthfeel is very limited, watery. Lacks complexity and charachter of the style. This brew needs some TLC and I wont buy again or recommend. However, if you're looking for a cheap brew to down this is it."
"You could definately do worse than this beer but nothing really stands out about it either."
"1/24/11 - Unwittingly re-reviewed and came to nearly the same conclusion, but I gave the drinkability a 4. Still a great value."
"Pretty good representation of the style and well worth the sub-$6 price tag."
"Pours a clear darkish amber with a large tan head that leaves good lacing. The smell is nice with sweet malt and bread yeast. The taste is crisp with sweet malt,bread yeast,and some vanilla? The m/f is light and well balanced making a good drinker,not great,but not bad either."
"It has a dark color and a decent head. It is very malty and reminds me of Sam Adams with less hoppieness (Not a good thing), but this makes it more aproachable than a more highly hopped version of this style. Great starter beer for the less adventurous but currious beer drinker."
"If Heineken made an amber, it would be just like this."
"Sampled at the Odds and Ends Tasting II on 10/19/07: Clear copper color with a medium off-white head that lasts a bit. Biscuity malt and caramel in the nose. Light, smooth body with sweet malt, caramel and grassy hops flavors. The finish is short and malty. Pretty bland and forgettable overall."
"It is not a bad beer, but it is not a good beer. It has a nice pour and a rich color, but the taste is nothing to be admired. It tastes like a cheep super market beer, except classy-er because it was purchased at Trader Joes. It is good for a cheep night before pay day, but I would not purchase it again."
"Pours a rich amber color with a thick cream colored head. Smell is malty caramel with some minor hop aroma coming through. Taste is solid, with a strong malt backbone and soft caramel flavors. Medium-bodied and smooth finish. A good beer to have around."
"Undistinguished Vienna lager. Clean, with clear coppery color, and weak, evanescent head. Very little maltiness, which is what brings me pleasure with this style. Bitterness was in balance, but no detectable noble hop flavor or aroma. The only plus was the $4.99 price on a six-pack, but if you like this style, I'd spring an extra buck or 2 for a six-pack of Negro Modela."
"One of many good but not great, well-priced beers from TJ. You could do a lot worse for less than $6/six pack. A very smooth, drinkable, malt-oriented lager."
"D - Very easy to drink and very satisfying for this style. Even if you don't know the style, this is a smooth and drinkable beer. I've always called this style a sort of Oktoberfest light, this beer epitomizes that, wonderful stuff."
"This all leads to a finish which is slightly stale and of medium duration. Not really much to this beer."
"Appears a bright amber/orange color, with a one-finger head that thinned out quickly but did leave some very faint lace. Smells nice and malty with some slightly fruity esthers and floral scents as well. Nothing overwhelming in the aroma, but quite pleasant. I almost pick up some trace hints of vanilla and caramel as well. The taste is also pleasant. Simple, malty, with some fruitiness in the finish, and easy drinking. A bit watery, though, which is too bad. But overall it's not a bad-tasting beer. Mouthfeel is a bit weak, but it's certainly not an undrinkable beer. I've definitely had worse lagers before. They could up the malt characteristics of this one for sure, but the folks at Trader Joe's have made a decent beer here."
"There was quite a bit of fizziness in the mouth but I usually like that, and it was more full-bodied then the Mexican versions of this styly usually offered. The unpleasant after-tastes might be broken up with the right food pairing here to allow the initial flavors a chance, but even at Trader Joe's below-a-buck-a-bottle price makes it hard to recommend."
"Pours a clear red amber with a one finger head and little retention or lacing. Aroma is all malts, mostly sweet and no hops. Taste is mostly mildly sweet malts, not too sweet but a nice balance for drinking with food. Mouthfeel is pretty good although it's a little clingy. Very drinkable and could be sessioned. Excellent beer for less than $1."
"So, yeah, a nice quaffable beer with a good malt presence. At less than a buck a beer, I can't complain, but I can get better beers for that price. I grabbed a single of their Weizen while I was at the store, and I am wishing that I had bought a sixer of the Weizens and a single of the Vienna. But I'm not unhappy with the sixer of vienna -- and I rarely buy beers by the sixpack. So, take that as you will."
"Drank a little above average for the ABV, I didn't pick stale or oxidized characteristics up. This was dissapointing"
"Drinkability- Pretty drinkable."
"bottled 11/27/06"
"Honey is again present in the taste along with roasted flavors in the malt. Late, mild bitter touch of hops. Light touch of metal is the only real downer. Goes down smooth and easy. Unpretentious, inoffensive, and cheap are good attriibutes to have for a lager like this. Nothing special but decent bang for the buck and could easily be sessionable if one were so inclined."
"Highly transparent amber, with an ok head, but not so good retention. The nose is malty and unremarkable, the taste is the same, but very well balanced, and quenching. The mouthfeel is predictably smooth, and the drinkability high. Great session beer, not terribly special, but very well done."
"Clean, medium-copper body with light golden edges. Small, filmy, off-white head. Nose is caramel cookie malts, cooked veggies, and spicy, if a bit mild, hops. Toasted, slightly hoppy flavors up front. Solid cookie dough malt follows. Gets more vegetal, spicy, and caramelly. Finish shows mild hop bitterness and lasting caramel cookie dough. Not bad. Moderate body with a slightly soapy feel. Another decent cheap brew from TJs."
"Throws a rich, golden copper color; stringy, well disciplined white bubbly head. The nose quickly reveals malts, clean hops and traces of toasted rye bread. Caramelized, sweet dark malts, dry roasted peanuts on the initial quaffs. Medium bodied, twangy, bubbly carbonation. Underlying yeast gives way to some notes of wheat crackers and kisses of bitter hops. A bit metallic and a sweet, gummy, fresh bread finish. Pretty good stuff."
"Taste is a bit sweet with a decent bite to it, not a whole lot going on that's extremely noteworty. Definately not my style of choice, but not a huge knock on the beer... After all, it's fucking beer... Not much aftertaste, kind of disappointing finish. Definately drinkable at thsuch a low price, might try again."
"D - Except for the appearance, everything about this beer reminded me of olde english malt liquor. Easy to drink and the price was right."
"Bronzed straw with a slightly copper/amber color, clear, average appearance. When poured into a pint glass the head is a lightly golden cream color. The aroma is dominated by a sweet honey character, with an underlying maltiness. There's also a slight hoppiness to the aroma, and a bit of funk. Somewhat offputting at first. On the palate it starts off sweet, with the honey coming on first. This turns into a pleasing malty flavor, with toasted grain and a light kiss of hops, and finally finishes clean and dry. Not much lingering flavor besides a pleasant grain-like aftertaste. Quite good for the price, though I don't know the style well enough to comment on this beer's particular adherence to a Vienna Style Lager."
"The score seems high to me, too, but I'm reminded that we review beer with style in mind. The Vienna style isn't something that has much of an elite quality to it but the ""Trader Joe's"" (like many BA's, I know who brews this stuff) version is quite solid. Exceptionally drinkable, flavorful and a beer I can imagine pairing with a good number of cuisines."
"Pours a tawny orange with stunning clarity. One and 3/4 finger head of medium density and moderate retention and produces almost no lacing. Mild toasty nose with hints of dextrins. Sweet pale malt and wheat hit the tounge first, followed by toasty Vienna and Crystal malt. Dry aftertaste exhibits spicy saaz and tettnanger flavor, as well as some dextrionous, grainy character. Medium bodied with an even carbonation that allows a slightly crisp mouthfeel while keeping the rich malt notes alive. Finishes with mellow Crystal and Vienna toastiness and pale malt/wheat malt residual sweetness. Lasting noble hop flavor also provides a magnificent balance and promotes the high drinkability. Not outstanding, but it is well-made, inexpensive, and a great example of the style."
"Pursue the purchase of this one only if you're on a restrictive budget."
"Drinkability: For the price, a good bargain, vs. the style, not so good."
"Overall-run of the mill....malting load doesn't seem to fit (Pilsner, dark and carmelized dark malts according to the label) the style...and it tastes that way...more of an amber ale..."
"Clear bronze. Very little carbonation evident. Thin beige head. Lace is underwhelming. A mix of biscuit and toasted malts on the nose. Pretty light overall though. On the buds, the toasted malts wrap around a bready center. A little caramel as well. Fairly full flavored. Mouthfeel is lightly carbonated. Gives a somewhat creamy mouthfeel. Medium bodied. Decent enough. And drinkable. But that's about it."
"Pours a crisp looking bread crust amber color. Some even, mild bubbling. A decent foamy film for more than half the beer. Some crisp lager like malt smells protrude from the glass. As well as some pellet hops. Taste is a very amber lager flavor. Hints a flowers and croissants. The Palate is very fresh and crisp. A good lawnmower or whistle wetting beer."
"Not a complicated beer, a bit crisp for an amber lager but still has a good flavor. For the price ($4.99/6 pack) not bad at all."
"Pours an orange-amber hue topped by a wisp of off-white head that doesn't have much staying power. Aroma of toasted caramel malt, some light adjunct malt, German lager yeast, and just a touch of hops, along with some notes of bread and light caramel. Palate is sweet and malty, with a nice biscuity character. Aftertaste is slightly astringent. Body is nice and substantial for a lager. The noticeable alcohol prevents this beer from becoming an all-day session type, but it's still quite drinkable. For the price at TJ's, it's difficult to beat in its category."
"Drinkable. A good beer.And, for $.89 a bottle or $5.29 a six....a no -brainer if you have access to a TJ."
"from the bottle. poured a amber with a off white head and left no lacing. aroma a nice sweetness, malts, fruit, caramel, some hops. flavor caramel and honey, fruit juice, malts and hops. smooth went down easy. not a bad beer could drink a few of these."
"D- Very easy to drink. Perhaps the best to come from this Trader Joe's brand, I definitely recommend it if you like malty lagers and @ 5.29 a 6-pack it is a steal."
"Overall, the price is right and this is an average/slighty above average stab at this style."
"Hey what do you know!, straight across the board 3's. This is the epitomy of average. Thats not a bad thing at all. Lager's will rarely blow me away but if it hits the key points like this one did and have something unique about it than its worth the time."
"Drinkability: I really enjoy drinking this beer. It's light, but has a hearty and complex flavor that doesn't get old too quickly. I imagine I could knock back quite a few of these at a barbecue."
"Drinkability  I dont find this beer compelling and I could not recommend it."
"Decent, and the price makes it all the more drinkable!"
"Mouthfeel is rather nice with a chewy body that has a creamy profile. An easy drinking beer that doesn't require too much thinking. Refreshing and under 6 for a sixer. I'd say it's a good crossover beer and I'll pick it up again if the mood strikes me."
"Very drinkable and a good try at a vienna..nice, i would have again."
"Overall impression: Not a bad beer, but not a great one either. Not bad for cheap beer from the supermarket, but I won't be seeking it out again."
"Moderate to thin mouthfeel, but fairly smooth. This is a drinkable beer, I guess. But not really exciting, and not my favorite example of the style by a longshot."
"An average beer, but for 5 bucks a 6 pack I'm not too dissapointed. This is basically Gordon Biersch Marzen, as GB contract brews for TJ's. Notice the logo for GB and TJ is the same except the lettering."
"Pours with a brilliantly clear deep copper almost amber color. It is topped by a frothy, approaching creamy, tan head that comes about from a slight carbonation. The aroma is almost non-existent, but for a lightly toasted biscuit type maltiness and a suggestion of spicy hoppiness. The taste is lightly sweet up front with malty notes of caramel. The finish is lightly spicy with a hint of balancing bitterness that comes to dominate the finish, but in a good way as it makes you want to take another sip. This is a simple brew, it is nice and refreshing, but is lacking a depth of flavor that I would like to see in a Vienna Lager."
"I assumed this was a GB beer since brewed in San Jose - other's notes suggest this is true. For $4.99, not a bad starter beer for macro converts."
"Drinkability- Nothing special here. Just a run of the mill lager. It tastes exactly like a Gordon Biersch beer should. No need to try again."
"An OK drinking beer. Not great but it will do for a watching TV beer. Not my favorite of the Trader Joe beers, but if this and Heineken were my two choices I would grab this. Like all the other TJ beers it is a good value for the price."
"Overall: well, nothing stunning here but not a drain-pour either. TJ's Vienna Lager would work as a decent intro beer for a macro-lover but it won't set a long-time beer enthusiast's pulse racing."
"The beer is smooth in your mouth with that sweetness (what is it? Some type of berry?) there. It is a mellow sweetness, which is good, and also why I probably can't figure it out. Some malt in that sweetness and just noticeable hops. The aftertaste is one of the better ones for a beer. It stays there and subtley reminds you to take another pull if you wait too long. Not an overpowering beer but solid in a lot of ways and did its job while I prepared stir-fry for dinner. I'll get this one again."
"Overall: Not much happening in this one, far from awful but not one that I would buy again."
