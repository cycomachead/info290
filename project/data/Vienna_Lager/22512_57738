Aroma of light cereal notes with light caramelized malt notes. Taste is a mix of light medium-sweet caramel malt with some cereal and grainy notes. Body is light with good carbonation. Nothing earth shattering here but well balanced and easily drinkable.","Phyl21ca","Jul 08, 2013"

4.35,15.4,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"I suspect this is the last one of these I'll have for a while. The Trapp beers come in quart (whoops - liter) flippies which is a format homebrewers like. The Vienna is a toasted hazy gold in the glass and the head was pretty sturdy. Initial smells seem subtle but inviting and get better. It's that first wonderful soft so balanced lager taste that wins every time for this beer and its brewery. An absolute Olympic gold medal winner.","BeerIsland","Jul 19, 2012"

It had a decent smell; thought it might have been a little more malty though. Its taste was average at best, nothing spectacular. Overall, a good beer, but again I was looking for something a little more special. I will have to try a different brew next time. I am definately not giving up on this brewery yet.","jsouza","Apr 13, 2012"

4.13,9.5,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Poured clear with a good frothy head. Good retention. Smell is sweet malt with a very faint caramel/cotton candy aroma. Taste is moderately sweet malt, commanding but not cloying. There is a faint burnt caramel edge that doesn't quite fit in, and this affects the otherwise near perfect mouthfeel. Very drinkable, would be an A+ if the malt was a little smoother.","skivtjerry","Jun 23, 2010"
