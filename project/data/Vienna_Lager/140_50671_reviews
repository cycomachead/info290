"Let's gander at that label copy: ""This amber lager is one of the world's most balanced beer styles. Nuanced flavors drift from semi-sweet,  bready malt notes to a floral and spicy kick from whole cone European hops."" And more: ""Vienna style lairs were on the brink of extinction until American craft brewers helped revive the style. It's a good thing they did. These delicate beers lean on light and bready malt flavors, but walk a fine, balanced line with whole-cone European hops contributing a dry finish."""

"Overall: One of the few Vienna beers that I have had. The sweet bready taste is nice and different than a normal beer. It grows on you as you drink it."
"O-very delicious beer. wish I had tried it sooner"
""
""
""
"Best in style out there. Excellent combo of hop and malt with nose following taste. Make it year round SN!"
"Very nice lager with a hoppy finish"
""
""

"D:  Superb drinkability in that this has a ton of malt flavor with a great body to balance.  Seems fairly traditional to the style and rather well done to me.  Not sure what the purists think but I enjoyed this quite a bit and would take it over a Sam Adams any day of the week."

"Nice and clear orange copper in color with a bit of a frothy head that provides a bit of lace.  The aroma is a bit thin but does seem right for the style. I get biscuity grain with a good bit of sweet caramel there is also a dose of grassy flowery hops as well.  The caramel and malt are the focus in the taste however a good deal of bitterness is in there as well without much in the way of specific hop flavor that is.  The finish is pretty neutral as the sweet character of the beer is only just surpassed by the bitterness to leave just a slight hop tingle on the tongue.  Overall this is good but maybe not as good as some others in the style."

"An excellent take on a classic style."

"OVERALL:  this is my favorite from the SN Fall Pack, I'm not a huge lager guy but I would definitely buy this again, SN can do no wrong, even beer styles I do not normally like are good when they make it (see Black IPA), SN brew masters are like rock stars of the craft beer world."
"O: I wanted to like this beer. I really did. I love Vienna lagers, to the point that the GLBC Eliot Ness is one of my favorite beers of all time. But when you take a Vienna lager and do your utmost to transform it into an Americanized hop monster version, you lose me completely."
""

""

""

"Overall it's a fine beer. I wouldn't rush to the store to buy a 6 or 12 pack if that was available for this beer. But it's just slightly above average. The hop profile throws me off a little in something this malty. But that's just me. I'd say get the Fall seasonal pack of Sierra Nevada beers if you still see it in your area and give it a try for yourself."

"DATE TASTED: October 12, 2014... GLASSWARE: Weihenstaphaner pokal... OCCASION: Happy sixth birthday, Michael... APPEARANCE: handsome dark amber body; reasonably effervescent; thick, rich three-finger off-white head that settles into articulate Cyrillic arcs and arches ... AROMA: slightly smoky; superior caramel malts; some pepper and peppercorn; some oats and dough late--a burnt toffee ending... PALATE: medium-bodied, slightly creamy; slightly crunchy, with  clean finish....TASTE:sweet, tempered toffee malts meld with spirited hops--bright and slightly floral--to develop a symbiotic sip... OVERALL: a crisp, malty/hoppy lager that delivers a sweet toffee reward; a good appreciation of the genre...."

"Pours out a bright, clear, copper body with a white head.  Smells of fresh whole grain bread, grain, and grape nuts.    Tastes of whole wheat bread with honey, caramel, toasty grains.  Mouthfeel is moderate with a light stickiness and a prickly carbonation.  Really good example of a Vienna lager."
""
""
"Overall (3.79) : This Vienna is a pretty decent beer. I'm not gonna say it's the best beer I've ever had, or even the best Vienna (that goes to Sam Adams' Boston Lager), but it is a good beer. On tap I'm sure this beer would kill. It's a good combination of malt and hop and though I wouldn't go out of my way to buy a six pack, I would have it again in a single."

"O-  This is one of the best vienna lagers I have ever had.  Very well balanced, great aroma, and a very smooth mouthfeel."

"From bottles dated 07/08/14, part of 'Fall Pack Seasonal Sampler' 12-pack: A pleasantly sweet malty lager with notes of lightly toasted grain and dark honey.  The sweetness is balanced by a crispness and rather mild bitterness from the hops.  If I recall correctly, the hop presence is lighter here than in Great Lakes' Eliot Ness Vienna Lager, which is one of my favourite brews.  A floweriness comes to the fore in the finish.  Carbonation seems nearly perfect, if erring on the low side.  A superb accompaniment to salted pretzels, with potent mustard and cheese.  —Reviewed 26 October 2014"
""
"Not a bad take on the style but I found it to be pretty mediocre. Sierra Nevada did a good job hopping up this brew but this is a style I prefer to lean towards the malts rather than the hops. Definitely not a waste of my time or money but not something I would run out and buy again."
""
""
""
"O-A bland an boring beer, not much in the way of flavor. But there is nothing bad about it."
""
""
""
"Taste is toasty and malty up front, with a nice citrus hop zing at the finish. Light, balanced, and very well done. Enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is probably the best part.  Nice medium body so it's not too light or heavy, yet it possesses a nice full flavor.  While it's buttery, it's still clean and pretty smooth.  Carbonation isn't too strong, but I wouldn't describe it as modest either, it's perfect for the style.  Hits both the sweet and bitter parts of your tongue in a big way and balanced perfectly.  Starts sweet yet gets a nice buttery and spicy (somewhat) dry finish.  Crazy drinkable, could be a year round beer for anyone who likes beer.  Really solid brew."

"O. Pretty good I’m not a big fan of the style of beer but still pretty good. Give it a try. Hard ass buzz for 5.3% ABV. 3.75"
""
""
""
"The Rest:  Great looking, excellent body and carbonation, this is a stand-out lager."
""
""
""
"Clear, amber, nice head.  Aroma is roasted malt, some grassy-like hops. Taste is much like the smell, some sweetness from the roasty malt, and a very nice hop bitterness.  The mouthfeel is very crisp, almost full-bodied, not like a normal lager.  Overall, I really liked this beer a lot.  It is a very refeshing and well-crafted beer - but that's what you've come to expect from Sierra Nevada, and they deliver nicely."
"O- Nice beer. Really drinkable, crisp and flavorful. Love the balance of toast, sweet, and hop bitterness."
"Much darker in hue than your average lager this displays a proud foamy cap. The nose is a touch bitter and piney but it leads with a biscuity, bready and tea leaf maltiness. The flavor is malty at the front end with a finish of sweet caramel malt. The front presents a grain, biscuit and bready malt with an almost amber like toast. It finishes rather dry and bready."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Amber with a small, sticky head that plasters some lacing on the glass and leaves a thin covering on the surface.  Toasty, nutty aromas meet up with some light noble hops.  Flavor starts out with nutty, biscuity, brown malts that are balanced with a nice tea and grassy/spicy hop character that lends a decent bitterness.  No standout lagery flavors and the sweetness is kept very much in check.  Medium bodied, appropriately carbonated, and super drinkable.  I’d love to see this in 6-packs."
"3.66/5.00"
"Flavor: medium roasted barley and tangy, pungent hops combine nicely with some toasted bread and biscuit notes."
""
""
""
"Overall 3.75: Good, solid Pilsener-type lager.  Not overly hoppy, but hoppy enough to be very refreshing.  Light malt, but not like a lager in its flavor profile at all.  This beer would stand up to heavy foods and still be a palate cleanser.  Another quality product from Sierra Nevada."

"O: Flavorful and easy to drink, plus it fits the season very well. Somewhat comparable to SABL, but different enough to be worth a purchase (plus the whole 12-pack is pretty much spot-on for the season). Great job by SN"
"Pours a pleasant looking medium copper orange with a significant off white layer of foam. Aroma is subdued but features nice clean malty notes with some grassiness in background. Nothing overpowering in the taste, just nice medium maltiness with an appropriate level of hops lurking in the background. Mouthfeel is nice with a very nice level of carbonation. Overall, a very pleasant and drinkable take on the style, and one I would hope Sierra Nevada revisits in the future."

"Just picked up the fall 12 pack, and I was a little leery of the whole October fest style so having been a fan of the pale ale already, I decided to try this one first. I must admit it's better than I anticipated. It's a dry lager, very bready and not as malty as some other fall beers. It's got a light crisp taste and a good amount of carbonation. The hops are ever present as with most Sierra Nevada brews, which I love. I don't know if I would pick this over Torpedo but I definitely would revisit it."

"Poured a lovely clear amber body with a thin cap of foamy white head. It looked like a classic Vienna lager, quite nice. Scents of lager yeast, soft, bready malt, rich German malt, and a low Noble hop aroma. A caramel aroma is also present, though it should not be in this style. Overall impression of aroma is of a wonderfully crisp lager that is quite malt forward, though not quite so much as an Oktoberfest. It suffers only from the caramel aroma which is not unpleasant but is untraditional. Flavor begins nicely sweet, with bready malt, biscuit, and a light level of floral Noble hops and a low level of hop bitterness. In the middle low levels of Noble hop flavor and bitterness continue, along with bready, biscuit and slight toasted flavors. Finish is semi-dry with notes of Noble hops with medium-low hop bitterness and hint of toasted malt. Aftertaste is grainy malt and a slight lingering bitterness. Overall impression of flavor is of a nice Vienna lager that balances malt and hops quite well. It is malty upfront, but gains a nice Noble hop character in the middle and finish to form a balanced whole. Mouthfeel light bodied, with medium-high carbonation, a smooth and creamy feel and a light crispness on the finish. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a wonderfully true to style Vienna lager. Overall this is a very nice Vienna lager. It has an excellent aroma, if not brought down just a hair by the caramel and a fantastic flavor and mouthfeel. It is wonderfully drinkable and quite pleasant to drink. Recommended."

"3.31/5: The quality is there, but the X-factor is not"

"An solid lager from a remarkably consistent brewery. A versatile beer to pair with food. Highly recommended."
"A great lager from Sierra Nevada.  Bready / biscuit malt accentuated by crisp, leafy hops.  Probably one of my favorite SN brews...  Hoping for continued availability after the Fall 12 packs go away."
""
""
"Overall: A marvelous lager from Sierra Nevada, and one that I hope they move into seasonal or permanent six packs. This beer would be perfect with Mexican food, and is a step above other common Vienna Lagers (Negra Modelo), as it is considerably smoother and less earthy than the Mexican examples. Very impressed, and would definitely recommend."

"O:  if it didn't have that slight rubbing alcohol medicinal note, it would be at least a half-point higher ... as it is, it's still not bad with some flashes of good toasted barley and plenty of sweet grain and light sweet malt"
""
"Cheers!!"
""
"10/30/13 On tap at Rattle n Hum, NYC. Malt & caramel are prevalent here. Pretty assertive, actually. I find it more like an Oktoberfest/Marzden than a lager but I prefer my lagers to lean to the pilsner side of body & carriage. But hey, that's just me."

"Overall, this is a great beer. More people need to make good Vienna lagers and they need to taste just like this. Light but complex and astonishingly well-balanced. Beers like this are why Sierra Nevada will always take my money."

"Golden colored with reddish hues, low head sizzles away quickly.  Aroma of sweetish malt and corn, some buttery notes.  Corny malty flavor, finishes sweet.  Slick mouthfeel."
"Overall:  A great lager with a good hop bitterness with an underlying malt backbone and finishes clean.  Refreshing, enjoyable, and balanced."
"O - finally! These are the SN bottlings I've been waiting a long time for. This is an instant top 5 Vienna Lager and a great addition to their New Fall Variety pack. Perfect weather. Perfect brewery. Perfect Vienna Lager. Hopefully it's released every Fall."

"I pour one and a half bottles into a becker with a nice rich copper color and tightly formed bone white half finger resulting,a very good pour.Some leafy hops and German malts in the nose,it has a light iron/metallic note to it wich is spot on.Dry and bready on the palate with a good smack of herbal/leafy hops in the finish.This is a great Vienna lager,one of the better true to form ones out there."
""
""
"12 oz bottle.  Pours brilliant amber with long lasting, foamy white head and nice lacing.  Aroma is of grassy hops and bready malt.  Body is medium and smooth.  Herbal hops, some caramel and biscuit malt fill the mouth.  Finish is long and hoppy.  Nice, tasty brew."

"Respectable!"

"O - A very pleasant, but not particularly memorable, beer."

"A spot on lager, and up there with Great Lakes Eliot Ness as one of the better versions made in America.  I just love the toasted malts along with the overall simple character here.  Really well done."
""
""
"Clean, bready lager with a touch of spicy hop bite in the finish. Malty, slightly sweet. Balanced. Tasty with pretzels. As usual, Sierra Nevada is a reliable bet for the money."
""
"8/24...pours light amber, see through, fluffy white foam. Mild caramel toasty nose. Light taste, malty nuance, slight bitter connects the dots. Bready for sure, chewy. Real good."

""
""
""

"Clear light copper colored pour with an airy one-finger white head. Aroma of caramel malt and floral hops. Taste has a lot of bready and toasted malt upfront backed by a light hop bitterness. Also has a nice sweet caramel and nut flavor. Light bodied and finishes dry and crisp."
""
""
""
"Overall, a great shot at a Vienna from Sierra Nevada. A little hoppier and fruitier than most others in the style but it works well here."

"This is a solid, sessionable lager with some good aroma and a very comfortable mouthfeel.  The flavor threatens to be papery but all in all, it manages to come across as above average.  For a style that is typically pretty specific in its range of characteristics, this manages to represent it well and still set itself apart a bit.  It isn't superb, but memorable enough that it could draw you back, and I could see this becoming a budget favorite of mine among German-influenced domestic lagers."

"This here wedding is winding down, and there's some Sierra Nevada at the hotel.  Let's get some, eh?  This stuff pours a clear bronze-copper topped by a finger of off-white foam.  The nose comprises sweet biscuit malt, light dried honey, a twang of mild sweetgrass, and sweet flowers.  The taste brings in more of the same, the relatively mild sweetness of the malt balancing very nicely with the floral, lightly-grassy hops.  The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry-ish finish.  Overall, a very strong Vienna lager, one that's far too easy to drink for its own good (or, rather, mine).  Quite the pleasant cap to a wonderful day."

"This is a nice example of the style by Sierra Nevada. They stay true to style and present a traditional example of the style."

"Taste is bready malt and nuts with a slick yet dry herbal bitter finish. This is a solid drinkable beer. It is tasty, crisp, and refreshing, yet it lacks the wow factor. I could drink lots of these, but there are more flavorful alternatives."
"Solid attempt at this classic style. Not as fulfilling as those I have had in Europe, but still quite good. I would say that Great Lakes' Eliot Ness is still the standard bearer for U.S. interpretations of this style."

"Very sessionable, perfectly balanced. a- caramel malt/lager yeast. decent head, dissipates quickly, amber color(as expected for the style). t- very well balanced, bit of a hop bite for the style-i expected this, but very balanced, malt finish is extremely smooth, medium-bodied, a little more full bodied than, I think, is expected of the style. Very good. I hope SN will continue to brew this, i would buy sixers of this all year."
""

"-Bottle- Pours a clear, almost bright orange color with a creamy head. He head leaves curtains of lacing. Aroma is of crisp, sweet grain and light lager yeast. Toasty and sweet. First sip brings forth toasted flavors and caramel along with caramel sweetness. Soft bitterness. Lighter bodied. Smooth carbonation. A pleasantly simple brew? I would like to try this next to Boston lager. I enjoy is style of beer. It's always agreeable to me. If eel like Sam Adams has captured the entire market for this brew, so when I see someone else try it I am usually pretty eager to try it."
"Overall, this is something I could drink all day long."
"12 ounce bottle into lager glass, bottled on 7/18/2014. Pours fairly crystal clear golden orange color with a 1 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, toast, biscuit, nuttiness, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of bready malt, earthy hop, and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of caramel, toast, biscuit, nuttiness, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Light earthy/spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, biscuit, nuttiness, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice robustness and balance of bready malt, earthy hop, and yeast ester flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Incredibly clean in flavors as well. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice Vienna lager! All around great robustness and balance of bready malt, earthy hop, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"pours a rich orange amber color one finger head and a light lace. smells sweet and fruity. fruity salty malty taste with a dry finish. light to medium mouthfeel and good carbonation. very tasty and balanced would buy again."
""
"The fruity notes detract somewhat, but this is easy enough to drink.  Purchased as part of the Fall variety 12 pack for about $13.50."
"O 3.5 - good malty flavor profile, sessionable, but I'm not sure how often I'd buy this even if it was available in 6 packs. However, it is a perfect fit for the mixed fall pack - that I may buy again this fall/every fall."

"Taste / Palate: The flavor is well balanced leaning just towards the malty sweet side. Like the aroma it has a very nice malty sweetness with light toffee and nougat like sweetness that is delicately balanced by Noble hop spice. It has a medium body and a smooth easy drinking feel. The drinkability of this beer is crazy good."

"A very well done Vienna lager. Solid malt base with just enough hop character to keep it tasty."
"Poured into a Sierra Nevada pint glass with a slight white head.  Beer is a copper color with slight amount of bobbles.  Smells sweet, bready malty and a hint of some type of earthy hop.  Toasty malt taste with slight bitterness and spice taste.  Pretty smooth with a good amount of carbonation and well balanced with a good body.  Overall this is a pretty good lager.  I'm not usually to much of a fan of lagers but I think this is pretty good."

"O -- The great combo of light, bready malts and spicy noble hops is well done.  I've had Mandarina hops in other beers, but never used quite as well IMO.  I may have been hoping for a less bitter, more rounded malt character in this beer, but the balance SN has achieved is very nice."
"O - Nicely crafted in almost every facet and surprisingly good. Beats Sam Adams flagship brew at it's own game."
"Overall I thought this was a nice beer and I thought it was a good example of a Vienna Lager, I don't drink this style too often simply because there isn't a lot of them available to me, but I know enough about this style to be able to pick out a good one and I can tell that this is what a Vienna Lager should be like.  This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth, clean, crisp, not filling and the taste did a nice job at holding my attention, I could see myself drinking a few of these without getting bored with it and I think it would make for a nice Lager to enjoy during the fall.  What I liked the most about this beer was how true to style it was, it had everything that I've come to expect from the style and nothing seemed out of place or unnecessary.  What I liked the least about this beer was nothing, there isn't anything that I disliked or would change about it.  I would buy this beer again and on it's own, I think a six pack for the fall would be pretty nice.  I would recommend this to people who like the style or anybody who's looking for a nice easy drinking beer with a little bit of flavor to it.  All in all I was happy with this beer and it's just what I want from the style, Sierra Nevada did this style justice.  This isn't my favorite beer from Sierra Nevada, but it's got to be one of the best Vienna Lagers I've had.  Nice job guys, keep up the good work."

"O: Super drinkable lager, and with the extra body in it this is definitely a nicer light drinking beer for crisp autumn days. A bit less malty than your average oktoberfest, but still hearty nonetheless. Awesome to see a new autumn seasonal from Sierra Nevada. This is the first of the Fall Variety pack I've had, but so far it's 1/1."

"I'd say this beer's best quality is that it's very easy-drinking and lends it self to drinking many at a time. There's nothing that really shines in this beer, it's more of a low-key, subtle offering."

"In terms of the malt forward Octoberfest styles, this one is better than average. Right amount of sweetness and smoothness, but far from being insubstantial in any regard."
""
"I would pass by a Sam Adams Boston Lager to drink this example of a Vienna Lager in a heartbeat."
"Not bad. Poured a clear golden yellow with a finger of foamy white head that receded to a thin layer of bubbles. Grainy aroma with notes of caramel malts. Same with the taste: grainy, lightly toasted caramel malts, grassy, but a little bit of a stale aftertaste. Light-medium body and pretty non-threatening and drinkable."
"Overall a tasty lager. Clean and nicely hopped."
"It's a light spicy taste with a some grainy barley and wheat. Hops are slightly metallic, but otherwise add a nice crispness. Sweet and grassy. This brew was true to style, and on the scorchingly hot day, when there was a wait for table yet the entire patio was empty, this brew really hit the spot as my favorite of the sampler and I ended up with a half pint of it. Very good lager!"
"Drinkability: I'm not a big fan of this style, and this one wasn't anything special. For me, the high carbonation causes to much mouth-numbing and bloating (is that a word?). On top of that, the flavor is light and kinda boring. A decent beer for the style, but I'd rather go for something else (especially at the brewery)."
