"As somebody who prefers lagers, to have this brewery dedicate itself to Germanic styles, including lagers, elevates it above other Chicago craft breweries. I enjoy the thick, slighty chewy malt notes in here. Hops are present, but they only support, not dominate. When I go out, I try to find a venue that has this beer, especially on tap. I should have this beer more often."

"Overall: Metropolitan is certainly a premier brewery if you are looking for lagers. Impressive flavors produced with that cleanliness I always look for in a lager. Great stuff."

"This is an easy beer to session and very easy to pair with food. Perfect beer to give someone who says they donâ€™t like lagers."
"I don't really drink a lot of lagers but this beer is fantastic. Very sessionable but has a lot going on with hops, malt, tad sweetness that balances out. The Vienna really shines. Local too."
""
""
"They do a good job of consistency, which helps. I know I can always trust in buying a solid beer from these guys."
"Overall: Pretty typical for an Amber Lager; too sweet for my palate with minimal bitterness; I really enjoyed the crisp mouthfeel, however"
"O=Not a horrible beer, but not nearly comparable to a Boston Lager or Sprecher Amber. Won't buy again."

"For all you extreme ale drinkers out there (me included), this is a great lager to bring you back to earth - very refreshing and a reminder of how interesting a lighter beer can be."
"Overall: This is one of the few lager styles that Americans seem to do pretty damned well. Hoppier versions like SABL are on one end; this is on the other. It relies on perfect balance and expert malt development to deliver the flavour. No room for flaws in this beer, and there really aren't any at all."

"Bottle poured a clear tarnished gold with a small lasting white head. Aromas of honey, straw and a hint of spice. Palate was light bodied and smooth with a watery finish. Flavors of honey, straw and light earthiness with a smooth watery honey finish."
"Poured a clear pale golden yellow. Since this was brought out to me by a waitress there was no noticable head or lacing left by the time it got to my table. Has a nice wheat scent mixed with some floral and citrus hints. Has a slightly dry start with a crisp and clean finish. The finishing taste was a lot better than the beginning taste. I had completly forgot I had tried this beer before out of a bottle. I'm always one to say beer is better on tap but in this case I really didn't think so."
"O: A solid enjoyable beer, could drink several in one setting. A good lager."
"Overall this is one of the best American lagers I have had. It is clean, crisp, flavorfull, and easy to drink. Miller and Bud wish they tasted this good."
"Another beer I'm trying for the first time after passing it by all the time at the store. It pours a clear light brass topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises buttery caramel, very light lemon zest, flowers, and light sweetgrass. The taste holds notes of toffee, very mild cocoa, flowers, grass, greens, and what seems like some toasted malts. The body is a hefty light, with a very light moderate carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, a fairly solid Vienna, though the nose is pretty weak and the flavors just don't seem to meld all the way (if that makes any sense anymore)."
"D: A light, clean, user-friendly beer, presumably brewed for the macro cross-over drinker. A quality beer that I found enjoyable, though not overly memorable."
"O -- This beer just about nails the Vienna Lager style -- in fact, I'll probably revisit this review in a couple days, after I've sampled a couple more, because it could be just about perfect, but for the low aroma characters. The flavor of the beer is complex and mellow at the same time -- very much as you'd expect in the style."
"Pours a clear copper color with enough lacing for the duration of this session. Toasted bread and a faintness of caramel in this immaculate nose. Refreshing crispness reaches new levels here; a wonderful mouthfeel. Uniform toastiness, on the dry side, though there is a quick touch of caramel in the middle. Hops have a quick sting of bitter- ness with some raw herbal flavors. Dry, toasted-grain ending. A solid brew, very easy to drink with a smattering of well-placed complexities to make it interesting."
"4.0 D: Easy going down and refreshing. If this was meant to be super flavorful and complex, then they screwed up, but if this was meant to be a good thirst quenching beer, then they did just fine."
"The drinkability on this is decent for me as I found the flavor of this beer to be very intriguing and fun."
"Overall: Likes it's brother, Krankshaft, I would describe this beer as ""clean."" It had an ""every man's beer," quality - or ""woman's"". It was good, and while I probably wouldn't purchase a 6pck, I would definitely have this at a bar, especially towards the end of the night."
"Drinkability is pretty good - feels like a bigger beer than it is, which is neither bad nor good really; certainly nice to that full in flavor, but it's got enough presence that you really notice it. Quite enjoyable, a great beer to keep around the fridge if it was available in my area consistently - holds up well to the benchmarks in the style (Brooklyn, Sam Adams)."
"D - Pretty good little session beer. Well balanced and approachable for the newbie. Well crafted - not going to have the hardcore craft drinker running to the brewery, but a solid offering that I could easily go back to again."
"I had to try this beer one for I live in Chicago and I believe in drinking local. Two I have had their Pils and loved it but this lager was average at bests. Poured a finger head with some lacing. Smell of some sweet malts and lemon. I thought at times I was drinking a Miller Light! Nothing about this beer blew me out of the water."
"Nothing special here and nothing worth buying unless you want something just a small step above an 18 rack of Miller."
"The beer pours the vienna lager traditional orange red color with a white half-finger of foam. The smell was a bit bready and corny for my liking. It didn't make it foul it just seemed similar to an adjunct aroma than a barley aroma. The taste was decent, there was a bit of bready earthiness that was pleasant, but there was really no hop flavor to help assist in the flavor, it left me wanting. The mouthfeel was good nothing overly exciting. It is drinkable, I think it's just a regular old lager, nothing bad to say about it, but nothing really good to say about it."
"I saw this beer was a new arrival at my local lousy liquor store and bought it because it was fresh, and the it had NO freshness date. It pours out a well, copper color into my Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass. Nice deep rich copper, a shade richer than your more familiar vienna lager, with a kinda thin quickly fading head. Some light lacing. The smell of this beer is clean, like a good lager should, with accents of spicy/herbal German hops and some toasty caramel malts. It isn't quite as floral as some which slightly disappoints. Nice toasty, almost caramel maltiness and some slightly herbal, drying hops in the aftertaste. So well balanced, and goes down very easy. This is well crafted beer, a nice departure from the infinite malt bombs / hops bombs out there. I would like to buy more of this beer and feel fortunuate it is available in my area, but I willl likely shy away in the future because the freshness will always be questionable. There are no categories for ""freshness", so I guess I will take it off of drinkability, even though my fresh sample is extremely drinkable ;-("
"The mouthfeel pairs a light to medium body with light carbination. The aftertaste is sweet caramel that lingers and teases me to take another sip. The only thing is I'd love just a touch more carbonation. This beer is very drinkable. This is the second beer I've had from Metropolitan and they're now on my list of beers to try. If you can make these simple styles so fresh, pleasant, and true to style you're A-OK in my book. Nice job!"
"drinkability: good"
"Great Vienna lager. Sessionable easy going flavors, but flavor still present."
"Pours a clear, copper color. 3/4 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and good lacing. Smells of sweet malt, yeast, slight grain, and a hint of pale malt. Fits the style of a Vienna Lager. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of slight hops, sweet malt, yeast, hint of pale malt, and a hint of alcohol. Overall, good appearance, body, and blend."
"Drinks well and smoothly in hot weather."
"D-A totally solid, pleasurable drinking with nothing fancy going on beer. This would be an excellent local go to beer to have on hand at all times."
"D: this is a great beer on its own or with a wide variety of food. Perfect session brew."
"Drinkability is good, this is a very tasty Vienna lager. A little more snap to it on the finish and a touch more hops would make it perfect."
"Overall I thought this was a well made Vienna Lager. I hate to post the exact same score as Kegatron, who I received the bottle from, but I felt exactly the same way about this beer. It's pretty easy to drink, I don't taste any alcohol and the flavor is easy-going and malt-dominant."
"Wow, another solidly crafted Lager from these guys, with its well balanced flavors and smooth body really helping out with drinkibility of this. Well done."
"D - easy to drink, its a unique flavor that makes it interesting to drink, i'll have to try another."
"Insanely drinkable and enjoyable beer from the folks at Metro. My first glass was empty in about ten minutes."
"D-Easy drinking yet full-flavored lager that I could see being a summer staple."
"Thanks again Frank for giving me the chance to try these two Metropolitan beers."
"Drinkability - Kick up the BBQ grill, throw on the brats, break out this beer. A nice drinker. Wish it was available in SC."
"Color is a light caramel amber. A finger of foam rises and fades, leaving a ring and skim across the top. Lightly sweet and bready, with a mild hint of fruitiness. Toasty grain an apricot hints. Very smooth and malty, some honey and bread in the aftertaste. Easy to drink and not overly sweet. Versatile with food, a sixer always disappears too fast. Always a solid option on tap around Chicago also..."
"The body is light to medium with plenty of carbonation to keep it lively. I could drink lots of these."
" D- This beer has a great freshness and a nice depth while still remains a smooth rich lager. It has just enough sweetness and dryness to really make it fresh and give it a good depth. Great for a session brew aswell."
"Not a standout but a good solid beer. Pretty true to style I believe. Thanks to Pudge43 for this one."
"Drinkability: sessionable"
"This might just be my all-time favorite beer. I normally tend to favor ales over lagers, but something about the Dynamo commands my respect-- no, my reverence. I happened across this gem in a biker bar in Chicago and fell instantly in love with it. It is perfectly balanced and quite flavorful. It feels so smooth and tangy, which i realize are conflicting adjectives, and yet the Dynamo can pull it off. If this beer were a country I would go to war and die for it. If this beer were a band I would be its roadie, groupie, and number one fan. As it is with all beers there is something in the body that is lost in translation from tap to bottle, but the Dynamo still tastes and feels great regardless of the medium by which it is consumed. I only wish i could replace my blood with it."
"I will abide."
"D - I have to say, I really like what Metropolitan has done here. I find myself liking this beer more with every sip. I would gladly have another... or several more."
"Overall impression: Just a bit too sweet, but not a bad basic session beer."
"Medium-light body with a good amount of carbonation. I found this beer to be fairly tasty, but too sweet overall almost as if it were under attenuated."
"Overall it's solid, but not great. Was excited to just stumble onto this on tap, but felt a little let down."
"clear amber with a nice creamy head. lightish nose is caramelly, bready, with grassy, spicy hops underneath. taste follows suit, with the lightly sweet malts gently washed out by the supporting smooth hop bitterness. nice frothy carbonation helps with mouthfeel and drinkability. light-bodied and sessionable."
"very happy that one of the biggest cities in the US is finally on the map for beer. i just don't liike the fact that each brewery has to find a niche to become palatable to the general public in this city... but i suppose they are just starting out. look forward to some different styles. i really respect the fact that they are going through the act of making a beer that is accessible to the public that isn't easier to produce... whereas most are 'craft beer' typical that steers away from drinkable and are more preoccupied with making the ultimate hop geared beer. i look forward to their ventures."
"(From tasting notes on 25 Jun 2009)"
"D: Decent enough flavor and goes down easy makes this a solid drinkable beer...just nothing that really sticks out and makes this stand out."
"I poured this copper colored lager into a pint glass. There was a medium head with a little bit of lacing. The nose is mostly caramel with a little bit of nuttiness. The taste is refreshing, not too sweet, well balanced. Mouthfeel is fairly viscus for a lager, pretty smooth. I could drink quite a few of these in a sitting, seems like a good shoulder season drinker. I think this a good example of a style rarely brewed by American craft brewers. That said, I don't know if I would pay $10 for a six pack of this too often."
"D: Good, I like Flywheel better, but it's nice to see a brewery focus on lagers, not something you see much of these days, especially in American brews."
"D= I like ales better than lagers, so for me this was a great lager because it didn't meet the style guidelines very well. All that aside, it was easy drinking and sessionable, and tasted good enough to want more than one."
"Ring of foam atop a hazey rust and copper colored amber brew. Faint spicey hops mix with toasted malts that give gariny carameled bread aromas. Toasty, vibrant malts dance on the tip of the tongue. Dry as well as sweet malt flavors balanced with Hallertau hops and their touch of spice. Dry ad malty palates make for a flavorful session lager."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied and smooth with good carbonation."
"If you want to taste what I image most Lagers should taste like, try this beer. Even though I am not a fan of Lagers in general, I would get Dynamo again."
"Whoa. A massive amount of foam (about half a half-liter mug) with this one. Pours a brilliant copper, almost red color. The foam settles, leaving behind little sticky bits on the sides of the glass. It's difficult for me to pin down what this beer smells like; fresh grain is sort of buried under another aroma, perhaps toasted marshmallow? It's not huge, but I think it's there. This one drinks like a Marzen: it's all about caramel and toasted malt that almost gets a bit tawny in the finish, which has probably just the right amount of hearty malt and bitter hops in the finish. Quite tasty, fresh and ridiculously drinkable."
"This lager goes beyond mass market lagers, in that it has actual good flavor, characterized by actual malt and real hoppiness. It's higher in alcohol than most lagers, and that's good.Other than that, it's not really a big beer."
"D: In a style that is quite drinkable, although not the best tasting variety that I've had. It's nice to support a local up-and-comer, and I really like the idea of the lager-only brewery, so I'll probably go with this one from time to time."
"D- nice to see another chicago brewery with bottles on the shelves, but this one isnt anything spectacular."
"Nothing really special about this beer. Drinks like an immature Lager. I think it may be a bit misnamed. Thought it would have a bit more color for a copper lager. It drinks easy and pours with a nice head and lacing. Simply an average beer both inn mouth feel and drinkability. There are so many other, better beers available to drink."
