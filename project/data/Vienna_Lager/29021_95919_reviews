"I can understand why it won a GABF medal in 2013"

"Pours copper in color with a large, pillowy head that diminishes pretty quickly. Great clarity. Toasted malts and caramel in the aroma with some light noble hops cutting through. More toasted malts in the flavor, very rich, but with a good hop bite as well. Finishes dry and super smooth. Medium bodied and clean. A really nice lager from Neshaminy Creek. Pairs well with grilled meats and veggies."

"Like it better than Brooklyn or Sam Adams. As well as a Lakefront."

"Right out of the can but it looks amber to reddish. Malty spicy smell. Tastes like how it smells. Malty. Spicy. Medium feel. It was like a better yuengling. I like this. But most likely for a while would not buy again but I do enjoy almost every beer I've had from this brewery."

"O- Very solid. Nice toast and rich malt character. But still light and clean."
"First sip reveals a very clean and crisp textured beer with very fine tingly carbonation.  Flavor is sweet caramel and some husky grain.  I do get a little spicy hops on the finish that linger with some bitterness.  Actually dries my palate out pretty well on each sip.  The beer goes down very easy and is simple and decent.  No flaws anywhere but not overly complex or bold anywhere either."

"12oz can. Pours dark amber with a small off white head. Aroma and taste is mild toasted grains, grass, hay, some yeast and mild fruity notes. Palate is a medium mildly crisp body, moderate carbonation. Finish same as taste with some lingering yeast and toasted grains. Overall a ok drinking brew."

"For winning a medal I was expecting more. A little spicy not your typical lager in a good and bad way."

"Jeremy Myers was the first microbrewer putting his beers in CANs to explain to me why brimful is the rule - it cuts down on the possibility of any oxygenated headspace before the lid is seamed on! Of course, this one was brimful when I Crack!ed it open. An inverted Glug netted me not quite two fingers of dense, tawny head that slowly fell, leaving sticky lacing in its wake. Color was a solid ... Amber (SRM = > 7, "
""
"Pour is dark hazed copper with a good bit of tight light tan head and a thick lacing.  Nose is heavy caramel and grainy malt. A bit doughy, faint herbal hops.  Taste is sweeter, more caramel, a bit less grainy.  Chewy stale malts, herbal hops, moderate bitterness."

"A big thanks to woodychandler for yet another canned beer. Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a dark golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is, well, faint. Several large whiffs resulted in just a few faint malts. Taste is malts, some sweetness, bready, a touch of hops. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a decent beer but nothing special."

"12 oz bottle. Pours amber with tall, long-lasting, fluffy white head and nice lacing. Aroma is of grassy, herbal hops and caramel malt. Body is light and smooth. Grassy, herbal hops and caramel malt fill the mouth. Finish is long and dry. Just OK brew."

"Amber in color with a honey yellow hue. Slight chill haze at first pour but cleared beautifully in a few minutes. Poured with a thick white foam that reduced to a healthy cap and left rings of wet sticky lacings on the glass. Earthy, grainy, toasted malt with sweet caramel malt and earthy hops in the background. Medium bodied with a pleasantly smooth, delicate feel. Fresh, clean, toasted and caramel malt flavors throughout with earth, herbal flavors emerging through the middle to the end. Finished crisply and cleanly with a pleasant herbal tanginess followed by a sour bread aftertaste. Crisp, clean, drinkable and refreshing. "
"Overall – A rather refreshing and quite flavorful lager. Very drinkable."

"Overall I am very impressed. Extremely tasty. I recently had Brooklyn Lager which is rated very high for this style and I most say Churchville Lager is every bit better in all aspects. It has the looks, the taste , the body and just that overall enjoyiness. A must try. This could possibly be NCBC's best beer to date !"
