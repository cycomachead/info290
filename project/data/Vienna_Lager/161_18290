4.03,23.2,3.5,3,4.5,4,4.5,"I think this beer may have been defunct for a while; maybe not, but I haven't seen it around in a few years. The brew pours a rich brassy golden hue and is capped with an inch of moderate-lived white head that settles to a covering film. Spotty lace is deposited. The nose doesn't do much except avoid offense and comply with style norms; there is not a tremendous amount of character expressed int the aroma. The flavor, however, is explosive by comparison; it is also very tasty. This bottle must be fairly fresh because it has a good deal of sublime and dynamic hoppiness; herbal and grassy notes are initially observed on the palate but they turn to piney and cannabis-like on the finish. The malt is very pale and mineral-y at first (AKA @ ~55Â°F) despite the relatively rich hue; as it warms and airs out notes of caramel and ripe fruit come through. The feel is light and refreshing, offering soft carbonation and medium-light body. Overall, I am stunned by this brew, as I did not expect it to be anything better than mediocre at best based on my recollection. It is pretty close to everything I would want from a straightforward lager, excepting the vagueness of the aroma, and it is definitely a case of the whole being better than the sum of its parts.","ktrillionaire","Jul 09, 2011"

Anyway, the beer was good, but I'm not going to go out of my way to get it. I would like to try some of their other beers on another trip to Tampa.

The lacing that sould have been left was absence. On top of this, there was no aroma, reminisecent of a macro lager. The taste had hints of hops and a tinge of malt undertones.

Smell is mainly of the malts, toasty ,vienna/munich malt and also a fair amount of hop scent , quite nice. Taste is also malty. Some distinct hop bitterness to balance. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with a slight crispness to the carbonation. I found this to be very tasty and drinkable american amber lager , brewed in the german lager style.

Interesting story about the history of the brewery, its transformation from Cuban cigar factory, and its storied past. Great label that includes a chart of its color, taste, and body (considered above average in darkness, maltiness, and body). A bit lighter for a nut brown.

3.38,3.4,4,3.5,3.5,3,3,"Pours a brilliantly clear copper color and is topped by a thin pale cream colored head. The aroma has a nice toasted biscuit malt note, a bit of sweetness that seems a bit fruity (which is atypical of a lager), in fact it smells a bit like grapes in the finish. The taste has a light malty sweetness to it up front, which continues through to the finish and is in fact the dominant note of this beer. There is a nice light bitterness in the finish as well that lingers for a bit. The beer also has a nice toasted malt taste to it and a bit of thin astringency to it. This is a really easy drinking, light and simplistic.","Gueuzedude","Sep 11, 2005"
3.32,1.5,3,3.5,3.5,3,3,"A pretty good bee considering the style. Pours a nice clear golden-copper color with a little more carbonation than expected. Somewhat fizzy head that faded to a film. Holds nice aromas of barley malt, caramel, apples, bread, and a pleasant yeast souring. Tastes are similar, throw in sweet wort-like flavors with a nice dosage of bittering and flavoring hops (the American way). Feels light to medium on the palate, waters a bit in the finish leaving an abrupt hop residual flavor. A pretty good beer, although a but raw or green.","BEERchitect","Sep 01, 2005"

Soft bready malt and lightly toasted grain along with a mildly herbal and floral noble hop nose.  A snap of moderate hop bitterness quickly yields to mellow grainy sweetness and a persistent toasted malt note.  An herbal hop flavor then emerges and provides contrast.  Lightly bodied, but just full enough in mouthfeel to prevent overall weakness.  Finishes clean, w/ just a hint of light caramel malt.  Ybor Gold is a no frills brew with more than sufficient overall character to facilitate excellent drinkability.  Very quaffable.","marc77","Oct 08, 2002"
