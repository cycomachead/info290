"Aroma of caramel and other sweet malts. The sweet malt flavors are right up front. Not much bitter or hop flavor, but they're not necessary here. The mouth feel is substantial and not watery at all. This is a really good lager. I could drink several of these tasty beers with no problem."
"Reviewed on 2/13/2010. Bottle. Pours a clear mahogany with a thick light tan head. Aroma of sweet caramel malt and residual sugars. Flavor is sweet malt and cardboard with a weak palate and some sweet grains. Not very tasty at all. This is just bad..."
"D. I wouldn't mind picking this up every once in a while."
"D-Pretty drinkable, if slightly unremarkable brew."
"Another entry in the winter sampler from the post-DLD death march. The pour results in a clear tawny amber with a half-finger of cream-colored foam that lingers for quite a while. Moreover, a thick bit o' lacing is formed as the head glacially recedes. The nose is toffee, walnut, and a light mixture of wheat and tallgrass. The taste shows a similar profile, with notes of toffee, caramel, butter, walnut, and sweetgrass. Though I prefer the smell, the taste ain't all that bad in its own right. The body is light, with moderate carbonation and a feel that is smooth, crisp, and slightly watery. Not the best of the box, but pretty good nonetheless."
"Clear copper with a creamy tan head that leaves filmy lace on the glass. The nose is faintly caramel with a whiff of noble hops. Ths flavor is mostly sweetish caramel with an earthy hop bitterness but not really well balanced or particularly flavorful. Medium bodied with gassy carbonation. Not the best tasting example of the style."
"Out of a bottle this beer was a copper/bronze color with good retention of the one-finger beige head. The aroma was of bready/biscuity malt and a little sweetness from some caramel malt with a touch of herbal hobs and vanilla. The flavors were similar with the caramel malt sweetness coming forth clearly with the herbal hops remaining in the background. A little butter, hints of nuts and brown sugar but overall rather bland. The mouthfeel was average, the body medium and the carbonation right on. Ok, but forgettable."
"Notes: For the style it seems just a little on the light side but everything is in good balance for the style. Once again Saranac has brewed another decent easy drinking beer."
"Overall a nice little lager, nothing really earth shattering, but nice and clean."
"As Vienna lagers go, this one was only fair, nowhere near as flavorful as other some of the other Viennas I've had."
"Lingers in the mouth perhaps a bit too long, but otherwise a great and easy to drink beer."
"D - easy to drink, nicely balanced but for the most part kind of bland, nothing earth shattering"
"Throughout, this one manages to cling on to ""mediocre"". Steely caramel dominates, and has a certain fizzy thinness."
"Pours a clear amber color with an offwhite head. Decent retension and a nice amount of lacing. Aroma of caramel malt, bit of grain, little bit of hops and sulfur in the end of the nose. Taste follows suit with much the same characteristics . Picking up on a bit of caramel sweetness but balanced well with the hop bitterness. Very crisp finish. Light feel and moderate carb. Nothing super exciting but overall not bad."
"This beer poured a dark brown with a two-finger head. The smell is a mix of sweet biscuity malt with a smattering of spices. The taste is a pretty good reflection of the smell, I should have paid more attention to the label on the bottle to figure out exactly what kind of spices they used but it was a nice addition without turning the beer into something that's like drinking potpourri. A nice solid beer that's probably one of the better ones in the Winter holiday pack."
"I liked this brew a lot and could see myself drinking several of these..."
"D: A light winter lager? Yeah, that's what this one feels like to me. Good interpretation of one, but watered down. Even so it could certainly be a session brew, and even beer rookies might enjoy this one."
"Drinkability: A very easy drinking Vienna lager. I do prefer this to some of the more commercial ones out there. However I do find the roasted malts a bit distracting and not true to style. It maybe kinda suited as a ""winter lager"". If they bottled this year round it might make a good addition to Saranac's line up. Overall not a great brew, but worth trying and worth drinking if its around. However this is only available in the 12 beers of winter."
"My pour resulted in two fingers' worth of eggnog-colored head with decent, if not great, retention. Color was a deep coppery-amber with NE-quality clarity. Nose had a rich, malty sweetness - somewhat caramel-like in its intensity. Mouthfeel was medium with a light caramel taste in the mouth. Finish had a light hoppy bite. Score another one for the Saranac variety pack!"
"Cheers!"
"VW"
"RECOMMENDED!"
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle part of the winter variety pack. Deep copper, amber color. About an inch of head, with lots of carbonation. Sweet malts aroma, mild yeasty smell along with sweet spices. Carmel, some wheat and yeast flavors, almost like a biscuit. For a winter lager I would expect more of a robust flavor. Mouthfeel is okay, and drinkablility is high."
"This is a really good Vienna Lager. Too bad it's called ""Winter Lager"" because this would make an excellent addition to their year round offerings."
"From the winter sampler case, this beer is a brilliantly clear copper-amber color. The head is a little slim, with white wisps. Nice aroma...barley, a bit of caramel, cereal, mildly toasted malts. Not bad. The taste is quite good, with a lot of malt and sweetness. Fairly medium-full in body, this could be a great session beer. Firm hop bitterness in the finish, although malt is centric in this brew. Very enjoyable."
"pours a clear copper color with a light tan two or three finger head depending on the pour. head holds well and leaves a nice sticky lace as you drink. smells of fresh malt and very slight spice. taste is subtle, sweet strong tea thats lightly spiced comes to mind, slight lingering after taste that not unpleasant. mouthfeel is light and a medium carbonation that fits well with this beer. easy to drink and subtle taste make it very enjoyable."
"Nice appearance, clear, with nice white foamy head. Goes down smooth. Not much of an aroma to it. Overall it is an average beer when put up against other Winters."
"12 ounce bottle poured into a Unibroue tulip. Off-white head lasts for a just a short period and than disappears, leaving mild lacing. Aroma is hoppy and spicy with a malt base. Taste is slightly sweet and nicely hopped. Body may be a bit thin, but overall a pretty decent winter brew."
"Overall a fairly nice winter lager that definitely warms you. However the odd bitterness and lack of balance seems to detract from my desire to seek this out."
"Poured into a pilsner style glass. Nice copper color with a head the quickly turns into a film. Sporatic lacing. Hint of caramel in the finish. Not a bad beer by any means but strangely non-discript. One of the weaker beers in the Saranac Winter sampler, which I highly recommend picking up."
"Copped as part of a twelve-pack Winter sampler... One of the better brews in the bunch but still, nothing to write home about... Pretty bland and nondescript in terms of overall flavor profile... Not enough substance in the mix... Hints of bread, butter, and caramel struggle to be noticed... not recommended..."
"D - Very enjoyable. Well balanced brew ... across the spectrum."
"D - Though not particularly complex, the flavors are well-balanced and definitely capture the spirit of the winter. A good after-work beer for the colder months."
"Drinks okay, but a bit weak & uninteresting, maybe one of the most disappointing Saranac beers I've had"
"Part of a case version of their twelve beers of winter (double the enjoyment for the holidays, nice). Longneck was poured into a tall, slender German lager glass. A hard pour produced a couple healthy inches of cream-colored head on top of a darker than expected amber colored liquid. Very lively carbonation working its way up through. Smells of golden brown toast, some cooked vegetable, and sweet malt. Flavors include lightly toasted malt, some light caramel sweetness, cooked vegetable, and a metallic bitterness in the finish. Feel in the mouth is medium with a bright carbonation. This is a pretty easy drinking beer for the season that is dominated by heavier, stronger ales. This lager is close to being very good, but falls a little short compared to some of their others I think. A nice mix up to the winter pack."
"Drinkability: nothing stands out about this beer, but it is tasty nontheless. i'd drink it again."
"Mouthfeel is of a rather light body but very crisp. Overall an enjoyable refreshing brew; very easy to enjoy several of these at once."
"Cheers!"
"D: The fuller malts add a great deal to the body, strengthening it up significantly. Another good lagerbier from Saranac."
"Part of the Saranac twelve beers of winter pack.Poured aclear bronze with a tight one finger bone white head that left decent lace as it settled pretty slowly.Not much in the aroma,some lingering spice and caramel bit its really light.Flavors are much of the same,lightly sweet caramel and some toasted malt, but really thats about it.Eh pretty ho hum,not a real Vienna lager in its true form by any means."
"Drinkability: This is an above average attempt at the style that is easy to session. I could have six of these while watching a game, but it is not anything I would get too excited about. Still a very solid effort."
"12 Beers of Xmas 2009, this one pours a deep caramel ruby color crystal clear visuals. Light beige head forms thick and dwindles slowly. Aroma has some slight caramel malt sweetness with herbal German hops in the background. Flavor has a nice rounded caramel sweetness with slight roasted nut edges. Clean mildly hopped finish with a mineral edge. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied for a lager carbonation is decent just not as soft as it should be. Overall tasty Vienna style not the best but a solid approachable beer for any of the in laws during the holidays."
"This was a pleasant beer -- not especially big, assertive or unusual. Just a really nice, balanced malty lager. Rich & enjoyable to drink."
"Overall, a nice winter lager is what this beer is. Very drinkable and to the style. Thanks Jason for this extra! I am glad I got to try it."
"D: Nice, if not mild winter lager. Very drinkable."
"From the newest Saranac winter sampler pack... pours a nice semi see through brown color, little wisp of head.. some lacing. For a winter lager, this is definitely on the light bodied side.. not the typical hearty/heavy winter seasonal. Still pretty drinkable though, not too much there flavor wise. If this is a vienna lager I'd much rather have Boston Lager.. that one has a lot more pronounced flavors than this one. Not bad, but I've had a lot better ones from this brewery.. rest of their winter mixed pack is better."
"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle (2009 batch) marked 2649-0834. Sampled on Nov 11, 2009. The pour is a darker amber color with a lot of bubbly carbonation flowing upward to a thin off-white head. The lacing is limited. In the aroma I note some muted malts and hops with something a bit fruity and grassy. The mouthfeel is thin. The taste has a bit more to offer than the aroma with a hint of caramel bitterness with a slightly bolder hoppy finish. But overall it is quite average, although easy to drink, but with the character of a cheaper winter lager for a slightly larger dollar."
"Overall- My 1st from this years Winter variety pack and a decent offering. A good 1 to start off the night with."
"It would probably go alright with burger and fries."
"Pours a crystal clear amber color with a tight egg-shell colored head that settles into a light ring. The aroma is of a light caramel malt, a bit bready with hints of copper. The taste is of caramel malt, a little doughy, light spice, and a touch of grassy hops. All of the flavors are rather light. The feel is light but not watery, plenty of carbonation, well balanced; finishes with an ever so slight bitter hop. This is a darn refreshing beer. Very clean flavors and very crisp. No off-putting flavors. Not the most flavorful brew but its very drinkable. Great to session."
"Not what I was expecting, more of a lighter Octoberfest (can't say I am familiar with the Vienna style lager before this one). Still, it is done well. Well balanced albeit a bit uninteresting, I tend to go for darker ales in the winter."
"Overall a decent lager. The strange sweetness adversely affected the experience for me."
"12oz bottle purchased as part of a seasonal 12-pack at Shaw's in Windham, NH. Pours a crystal clear amber to red body with a good inch of short-lived off-white head. Smells slightly caramel malty with a bit of a soapy quality. Tastes malty, with caramel, chocolate and a slight fruity. Medium in both body and carbonation. While the aroma was a bit discouraging, the flavor was pleasant and balanced, and as good as any other Vienna I've had."
"D- very drinkable, prob. one of the better Am. brewed viennas out there, i wish they had 6'rs of this"
"Nice (good) beer with an overall malty taste that releases more malt flavor and taste as it warms up and goes down easy. Not exceptional flavor, but quite drinkable."
"Very nice! I could swear that it's a clone of the SA version. Very easy to drink and tasty. Definitely one of the better beers from Saranac."
"Cheers"
"D. Alright not my favorite from the 12 beers of winter pack. A little thin and not as flavorful as it could be."
"Saranac Winter Lager is a clear, amber beer with a fluffy, off white head that has decent retention. It smells slightly sweet, malty and peppery. It's medium-light bodied and the finish is a little gritty. It has a peppery twang that's balanced well with a green, botanical bitterness that lasts through the finish. There's nothing really stand-out here."
